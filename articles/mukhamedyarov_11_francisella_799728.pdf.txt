Francisella RNA polymerase contains a
heterodimer of non-identical a subunits
Damir Mukhamedyarov1, Kira S Makarova2, Konstantin Severinov1,3 and Konstantin Kuznedelov1*

Abstract
Background: All sequenced genomes of representatives of the Francisella genus contain two rpoA genes, which
encode non-identical RNA polymerase (RNAP) subunits, a1 and a2. In all other bacteria studied to date, a dimer of
identical a subunits initiates the assembly of the catalytically proficient RNAP core (subunit composition a2bb’).
Based on an observation that both a1 and a2 are incorporated into Francisella RNAP, Charity et al. (2007)
previously suggested that up to four different species of RNAP core enzyme might form in the same Francisella
cell.
Results: By in vitro assembly from fully denatured state, we determined that both Francisella a subunits are
required for efficient dimerization; no homodimer formation was detected. Bacterial two-hybrid system analysis
likewise indicated strong interactions between the a1 and a2 N-terminal domains (NTDs, responsible for
dimerization). NTDs of a2 did not interact detectably, while weak interaction between a1 NTDs was observed. This
weak homotypic interaction may explain low-level transcription activity observed in in vitro RNAP reconstitution
reactions containing Francisella large subunits (b’, b) and a1. No activity was observed with RNAP reconstitution
reactions containing a2, while robust transcription activity was detected in reactions containing a1 and a2.
Phylogenetic analysis based on RpoA resulted in a tree compatible with standard bacterial taxonomy with both
Francisella RpoA branches positioned within g-proteobacteria. The observed phylogeny and analysis of constrained
trees are compatible with Francisella lineage-specific rpoA duplication followed by acceleration of evolutionary rate
and subfunctionalization.
Conclusions: The results strongly suggest that most Francisella RNAP contains a heterodimer with a minor
subfraction possibly containing a1 homodimer. Comparative sequence analysis suggests that this heterodimer is
oriented, in a sense that only one monomer, a1, interacts with the b subunit during the a2b RNAP subassembly
formation. Most likely the two rpoA copies in Francisella have emerged through a lineage-specific duplication
followed by subfunctionalization of interacting paralogs.

Background
Bioinformatics analysis reveals that two paralogous rpoA
genes, each encoding non-identical proteins homologous
to bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) a subunits, are
present in the genome of Francisella tularensis [1]. The
bacterial RNAP core enzyme has subunit composition
a2bb’. Variations including fusion of the largest subunits, b and b’, in Helicobacter and Wolinella genera
[2,3], and split the largest subunit in some cyanobacteria

[4] have been reported, but overall, the subunit composition of RNAP core is conserved. The a subunit homodimer initiates bacterial RNAP assembly. The a subunit
monomers dimerize through their N-terminal domain
(NTD) [5,6]. The C-terminal domain (CTD) is connected to NTD through a flexible tether [7]. The aCTD
is not required for assembly but is involved in transcriptional regulation [8-10]. The aNTD homodimer provides a platform for interaction with the two large
RNAP subunits [11,12]. Determinants in a important
for interactions with b and b’ subunits have been localized by mutagenesis and hydroxyl-radical footprinting
studies [5-8,13-15]. Substitutions at positions 45 and 48

partially (L48A) prevented formation of the a2b RNAP
subassembly [16]. Two point substitutions at positions
86 and 173, and two-amino-acid insertions at positions
180 and 200 of E. coli a caused defects in b’ binding
without affecting the a2b assembly formation [16,17].
RNAP containing oriented E. coli a heterodimers have
been prepared both in vitro, by reconstitution from
recombinant subunits, and in vivo, by co-expression of
genes for recombinant subunits, by using one a subunit
lacking the R45A substitution and one a subunit having
the R45A substitution [18,19]. Functional analysis of
RNAP containing oriented a heterodimers confirmed
that asymmetrical arrangement of a leads to non-identical functions of each monomer in transcription regulation [18,19].
RNAP core enzymes from archaea and eukaryotes
contain homologs of each of the bacterial RNAP core
subunits. However, rather than having two identical a
subunit homologs, they contain two different a-like
polypeptides (RPB3 and RPB11 in the case of eukaryotic
RNAP II) that form a heterodimer, which serves as a
platform for RNAP assembly [20].
The presence of two different genes (rpoΑ1 and
rpoΑ2) in the genome of Francisella suggests that up to
four RNAP core enzymes differing in subunit composition could be present in the cells: two enzymes containing a homodimers, (a1) 2 bb’ and (a2) 2 bb’, and two
enzymes containing a heterodimers, (a1a2)bb’ and
(a2a1)bb’ [1]. The heterodimers could differ from one
another with respect to which a interacts with the b
subunit of RNAP and which a interacts with b’ [18,19].
Promoter recognition properties of RNAP holoenzymes
formed from these different core enzyme molecules may
differ, since CTD of a1 and a2 may be capable of different protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions during transcription initiation [18,19]. Further, if
holoenzymes containing RNAP core enzymes of different composition indeed respond differently to transcription factors and elements, then F. tularensis may
regulate the spectrum of expressed genes by altering the
relative ratio of core enzymes with different a subunit
composition, which would be a novel paradigm of transcription regulation in bacteria.
Evidence of that both a1 and a2 subunits are incorporated into F. tularensis RNAP has been reported earlier
by Charity et al. [1]. These authors demonstrated that
RNAP affinity purified from F. tularensis strain expressing the b’ subunit with fused TAP-tag contained both
a1 and a2. These experiments clearly show that both
rpoA genes are active and their products are components of RNAP but do not inform about the actual subunit composition of F. tularensis RNAP. Based on
predicted dimerization determinants in other bacteria
[21], Charity et al. hypothesized that a1 and a2 might

exclusively form either homodimers or heterodimers [1].
In the present study, we describe the results of in vitro
analysis of assembly of RNAP from F. tularensis subspecies novicida. Our results indicate that RNAP core containing an a heterodimer is the main, perhaps the only,
species of RNAP in this organism. We further present
results of phylogenetic analysis that provide a plausible
scenario for the appearance of two paralogous rpoA
genes in the Francisella lineage.

Results
F. tularensis a heterodimer but not homodimers
efficiently assembles in vitro

To experimentally address the ability of F. tularensis
RNAP a subunits to form homo- and heterodimers, we
investigated the ability of recombinant F. tularensis a
subunit proteins with C-terminal His6-tags to pull down
untagged counterparts during ion metal affinity chromatography. As shown previously, F. tularensis RNAP a
subunits have different electrophoretic mobilities, with
a1 migrating significantly faster than a2 [1]. In addition,
His6-tags alter electrophoretic mobility of both a1 and
a2 enough to separate tagged and untagged a subunits
of the same kind (Figure 1).
Therefore, because each of the four proteins used in
the pull-down assay has a characteristic electrophoretic
mobility, it is possible to detect the efficiency of both hetero- and homodimer formation. Various pairwise combinations of a subunits were mixed at denaturing
conditions (6 M guanidinium chloride), the denaturing
reagent was removed by dialysis at conditions favouring
bacterial RNAP assembly from isolated subunits [22],
and reconstitution reactions (labelled “L” on Figure 1)
were loaded on Ni2+-affinity columns. Flow-through (F)
was collected and retained protein was eluted (E) with
different concentrations of imidazole in the buffer. Aliquots of each fraction were next analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
As can be seen from Figure 1 (top panel), no co-immobilization of untagged a subunit in reactions that contained
tagged and untagged versions of subunit of the same kind
was detected. In contrast, heterodimers were readily
detected when either a1His 6 or a2His 6 were used as
“baits” for co-immobilization of, respectively, a2 or a1
(Figure 1, bottom panel). We conclude that F. tularensis
RNAP a subunits do not appreciably form homodimers,
at least at the conditions of in vitro RNAP assembly.
a1NTD and a2NTD efficiently interact in bacterial 2hybrid system

RNAP a subunit is a two-domain protein, with its Nterminal domain being primarily responsible for dimerization and interaction with large RNAP subunits, while the
C-terminal domain, CTD, which is connected to NTD
through a flexible linker, is primarily responsible for

interactions with transcription factors and DNA upstream
of the -35 promoter element [23]. Weak dimerization of
isolated aCTD has been reported and may be of regulatory significance [7]. To independently study dimerization
of various domains of F. tularensis a subunits, we used the
bacterial two-hybrid system [24]. Eight two-hybrid plasmids expressing bait and prey fusions of each a domain
were constructed and 16 pairwise combinations were
tested. The results are presented in Table 1. As can be
seen, in agreement with in vitro co-immobilization data,
strong interactions between aNTDs of different kinds
were detected. aCTDs did not appreciably interact with
each other or with aNTDs. The level of homotypic interaction between a1NTD was above the background, potentially indicating formation of a1NTD homodimer, while
the level of a2 homodimer formation was at the background level.
Formation of the a2b subassembly in vitro

RNAP assembly follows a conserved pathway, whereby
the b subunit interacts with the a dimer, leading to the

formation of a 2 b - a stable intermediate of RNAP
assembly that can be observed both in vivo and in vitro
[11,16]. We performed in vitro RNAP assembly using
His 6 -tagged F. tularensis a subunits and untagged

recombinant F. tularensis b. The results indicated that b
was most efficiently immobilized when both a subunits
were present in the assembly reaction (Figure 2A, lane
12). Only trace amounts of b were co-immobilized in
reactions containing a2 (Figure 2A, lane 8) and thus
likely represented non-specific binding (note that an
excess of a2 was used in this reaction). The amount of
b co-immobilized in reactions containing a1 (lane 4)
was higher than the background but clearly less than
that observed in reactions containing both a subunits.
We conclude from these experiments that b interacts
most efficiently with a heterodimer. Detected

interaction between b and a1 can proceed through a1
monomer or, alternatively, the b subunit may stimulate
formation of the a1 homodimer.
In vitro transcription by recombinant F. tularensis RNAP

To validate data obtained using two-hybrid analysis and
a dimer/a2b RNAP subassembly in vitro reconstitution,
in vitro RNAP assembly and transcription experiments
were performed. Three in vitro RNAP assembly reactions contained recombinant F. tularensis b and b’ subunits and a1, a2, or both a1 and a2 (the ω subunit was
omitted from assembly reactions as it is not essential for

RNAP basic function [25,26]). Assembled RNAP reactions were passed through a gel-filtration column, fractions that eluted at retention times expected for RNAP
core elution were collected and tested for transcription
activity on a nucleic acid scaffold shown in Figure 3A.
Nucleic acid scaffolds mimic the conformation of
nucleic acids in transcription elongation complexes.
RNAP complexes with nucleic acids scaffolds are catalytically active and serve as a convenient tool to study
transcription elongation properties of the enzyme [27].
Reactions were combined with NTP, and elongation of
radioactively labelled 8-nt RNA component of the scaffold ("RNA8“) followed. The results are presented in Figure 3B. As can be seen, most efficient elongation of the
RNA primer was observed in fractions obtained from
RNAP assembly reaction containing both a subunits.
Fractions of RNAP assembly reaction that contained a2
only were completely inactive. Fractions of RNAP
assembly reaction containing a1 only demonstrated low
but detectable transcription activity. We therefore conclude that F. tularensis RNAP assembles efficiently
when both kinds of a subunits are present; a2 alone is
unable to promote RNAP assembly; a1 alone supports

Evolution of RpoA in Francisella

To gain insight into the evolution of two paralogs of
RpoA in Francisella, we retrieved all RpoA sequences in
all of the 1055 completely sequenced bacterial genomes
available in the RefSeq database. We found that in addition to Francisella, two rpoA genes (rpoA1 and rpoA2)
are present in several other genomes, namely in three
Chloroflexus species (C. aggregans DSM 9485; C. aurantiacus J-10-fl; C. sp. Y-400-fl), in Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680, in Psychromonas ingrahamii 37, and in
Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo bovis L550 (see
also Additional file 1). In the latter two cases the two
rpoA copies are identical and are apparently the result
of very recent genome segment duplications that also
include a number of other genes.
In order to address an alternative possibility, that one
of the RpoA paralogs in Francisella could have been
horizontally transferred from a distant bacterial (other
than g-proteobacteria to which the Francisella genus
belongs) lineage instead of arising through gene duplication, we reconstructed RpoA phylogenetic tree for a
representative set of bacteria including those that contain rpoA duplications listed above (Figure 4A). The
resulting tree is generally very well compatible with bacterial taxonomy, which is not surprising considering the
fact that RNAP subunits are among the best phylogenetic markers [28-30]. The position of both RpoA
branches corresponding to Francisella within g-proteobacteria is confidently supported by bootstrap analysis
(bootstrap probability of 0.93). Thus, it is unlikely that
any of the Francisella rpoA genes were transferred from
outside of the g-proteobacterial lineage. Branches leading to both Francisella RpoA proteins are extremely
long, which might cause an artefact of the long-branch
attraction, making the Francisella RpoA positioning
unreliable. To test hypotheses for an alternative position
of Francisella RpoA branches, we used RAxML [31]
program to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree for g -proteobacteria with b-proteobacteria outgroup (Figure 4B),
made constrained trees and compared the maximum
likelihood values for the best tree (Figure 4B) and constrained trees. The first constrained tree was designed to
test a hypothesis of monophyly of two RpoA paralogs of
Francisella; the second tree was designed to test a
hypothesis of monophyly of both Francisella RpoA and
of homologs from Coxiella, Legionella, and Thiomicrospira - species that are the closest taxonomic relatives of
Francisella (Additional file 2). The analysis showed that
none of the hypotheses could be rejected, suggesting
that the positioning of RpoA at the root of g-proteobacteria could be explained by long-branch attraction

artefacts. Thus, we conclude that the two RpoA copies
in Francisella most likely emerged through a duplication
followed by acceleration of the evolutionary rates of
both paralogs.

Discussion
Representatives of the bacterial genus Francisella are
unusual with respect to RNAP composition, in that
they contain two different a subunits encoded by two
paralogous genes rpoΑ1 and rpoΑ2. The presence of
two different a subunits in affinity-purified RNAP preparations [1] suggested that as many as four different
species of RNAP core enzyme could be present in the
single cell. Here, we studied Franicella RNAP by
means of in vitro assembly. Our results show that Franicella a heterodimer (a1a2) efficiently assembles in
vitro from fully denatured state and homodimers are
not detected. Bacterial two-hybrid analysis indicates
that in addition to efficient a heterodimer assembly,
some dimerization of a1 may also occur. Thus, the
efficiency of a dimerization is clearly a major factor
that should affect subunit composition of Francisella
RNAP. As was determined from crystal structure analysis, the main structural elements of the a dimer
interface of E. coli are two a-helices, H1 and H3,
orthogonally oriented to each other [21]. These helices
from one monomer participate in a coiled-coil-like
interaction with their counterparts in the other monomer. Within these helices, Kannan et al. [32] identified
a cluster of amino acids stabilizing interactions at the
E. coli a dimer interface, with residues 35F, 38T, and
39L emanating from one a monomer and residues 46I,
50S, and 227Q from another. Of particular interest are
three of them, namely, 35F, 38T, and 46I, point mutations at which partially (a-T38A) [16] or completely
(a-F35A, a-I46S) [32] prevented the dimer formation.
As can be seen from Figure 2B, amino acids at these
positions are conserved (identical) between E. coli and
Thermus, while amino acids in many of the corresponding positions in both a1 and a2 subunits from
Francisella differ. Since these positions are critical for
the dimer formation, it is reasonable to assume that
some amino acids at these positions of Francisella a
subunits, for example, a1-36M, a1-39I, a2-33V, and
a2-47T, may be unfavourable to the assembly of
homodimers. However, in the absence of crystal structure or systematic mutagenesis data, it is currently not
possible to identify structural reasons for hetero- and
homodimerization of Francisella a subunits.
During RNAP assembly in organisms where a subunit
forms a homodimer, the b subunit is free to interact
with either a monomer to form the a2b subassembly.
The situation must be different in the case of F. tularensis, where a heterodimers form preferentially. In E. coli,

Page 7 of 11

an evolutionary conserved a subunit residue Arg 45 is
critical for b subunit interaction with the a dimer
[16,18,19]. In F. tularensis, the corresponding position
in a1 also contains an arginine (Arg46), while in a2 this
position is occupied by glutamine (Gln 42 ; Figure 2B).
Thus, it appears that b subunit in F. tularensis will be
specifically interacting with the a heterodimer through
a1. That a1 contains determinants for interactions with
b also follows from results of the a 2 b subassembly
reconstitution and in vitro transcription data, since
Francisella RNAP containing a1 homodimer is functional and formation of an (a1)2b intermediate can be
detected in vitro, albeit with low efficiency. The latter
result suggests that b may stimulate a1 dimerization.
An alternative possibility would be b interacting with
one a1 monomer, followed by association with another
a1 and b’, or the a1b’ complex. Be that as it may, our
data suggest that bacteria of Francisella genus produce
a major form of RNAP containing an oriented a1a2
heterodimer, and a minor form containing a1
homodimer.
As shown earlier by hydroxyl-radical-mediated proteolysis [14], the segments of E. coli a most strongly protected by b correspond to amino acids 30-55 and 65-75,
and the segments of a most strongly protected by b’
correspond to amino acids 175-185 and 195-210. Single
alanine substitutions of E. coli a Lys86 and Val173 and
two-amino-acid insertions at positions 180 and 200 of E.
coli a cause defects in b’ binding without affecting the
a2b assembly formation [16,17]. To evaluate the ability
of Francisella a1 and a2 subunits to interact with the b’
subunit, we compared sequences of E. coli a subunit
involved in interaction with b’ [14,21] to those in F.
tularensis a1 and a2 subunits (Additional file 1). The
results reveal that a lysine at a position corresponding
to E. coli a position 86 is present in both a polypeptides
from Francisella, while amino acids corresponding to E.
coli a Val173 are, respectively, a valine and a leucine in
a1 and a2. Similarly, the site of one two-amino-acid
insertion that destroys b’ interaction with a2b in E. coli,
Val180, has as its counterpart a valine in a2 and an isoleucine in a1 of Francisella. These conservative changes
are unlikely to affect the efficiency of b’ binding by the
a polypeptides. Interestingly, the site of the residue at
the site of the second insertion affecting b’ interaction
with a2b in E. coli, Lys200, is conserved in Francisella
a2 and a subunits from other bacteria (see Additional
file 1), but is substituted with threonine in a1. The
results thus implies that Francisella b’ interacts with a2.
Further experiments will be needed to prove this
conjecture.
Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that none of the
Francisella rpoA genes was transferred from outside of
the y-proteobacterial lineage. In fact, both genes most

Mukhamedyarov et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/50

likely emerged through duplication of an ancestral single
gene followed by acceleration of evolutionary rate of
both paralogs. Acceleration of rpoA evolutionary rate
after the duplication apparently was accompanied by
subfunctionalization of Francisella a subunits, ultimately
leading to accumulation of substitutions in residues
responsible for homodimerization and involved in the (b
and b’ subunit interaction.
Similar events, albeit on much longer time intervals,
must have led to formation of two very different a-like
subunits in eukaryotes and archaea. The large a-like
subunit (RPB3 in eukaryal RNAP II, AC40 in RNAP I
and RNAP III, Rpo3 (also known as RpoD) in archaea)
heterodimerizes with its much smaller counterpart
(RPB11 in eukaryal RNAP II, AC19 in RNAP I and
RNAP III, Rpo11 (also known as RpoL) in archaea)
[33-36]. Crystallographic and functional analyses indicates that large a homolog makes interaction with the
second-largest (b-like) subunit through a surface that
contains residue homologous to E. coli a Arg45 [35,37],
and is thus formally similar to Francisella a1. The smaller a homolog of eukaryal and archaeal RNAP thus corresponds to Francisella a2. One should not take this
analogy to far though, since in eukaryotes and archaea,
the a heterodimer is not sufficient for recruitment of
large RNAP subunits in the complex. Eukaryal RPB10
and RPB12 and their archaeal homologs Rpo10 (also
known as RpoN) and Rpo12 (also known as RpoP) form
a stable complex with all four polypeptides playing an
essential role in assembly and stability of the RNAP
complex [36,38,39].
Evolution of the rpoA duplication presented here is
one of the best demonstrations in support of the
Lynch’s subfunctionalization scenario where both copies
are subject to relaxed selection and acceleration of the
evolutionary rates but rarely develop a new or specialized function [40]. The fact that bacterial RNAP a subunit functions as a dimer should make it particularly
prone to duplication/subfunctionalization. Indeed, while
the impetus for our study came from an apparently
unique situation with two different a subunits in Francisella, bioinformatics analysis revealed additional
instances of rpoA duplications, some fairly recent, like
in S. avermitilis, others more ancient, like in Chloroflexus species. Despite the fact that these RpoA paralogs
are being ancestral for the Chloroflexus species, no drastic substitutions in regions responsible for dimerization
and/or b/b’ interactions have accumulated, suggesting
that in contrast to the situation observed in Fransicella,
the two a subunits of Chloroflexus may still be functionally equivalent. It is likely that many more instances of
rpoA duplications and subfunctionalization will be
found in the future.

Conclusions
The data presented here support the following conclusions: (1) only Francisella a-heterodimer (a1a2) can be
efficiently assembled in vitro; (2) strong direct interactions between a1NTD and a2NTD only have been
detected in the bacterial two-hybrid system; (3) b interacts more efficiently when both of a1 and a2 presented
in the reconstitution mix; (4) interaction between a1
and b subunits was observed to be stronger than interaction between a2 and b; (5) based on phylogenetic analysis, two rpoA copies in Francisella most likely must
have emerged through a duplication followed by acceleration of the evolutionary rates of both paralogs.
Methods
Bacterial strains

E. coli NovaBlue Singles competent cells (Novagen) were
used for initial cloning and plasmid propagation. E. coli
BL21 (DE3) cells were used for protein overproduction.
Reporter E. coli strain FW102 F’OL2-62 [41] was used
for bacterial two-hybrid experiments.
Cloning and expression

Francisella tularensis novicida genomic DNA has been
provided by Dr. Michael Ibba (Ohio State University).
Primers for PCR amplification of rpo genes were
designed using Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida
(FTN) strain U112 genome sequence data [GenBank:
NC_008601]. The primers allowed cloning of amplified
FTN rpo genes in pET series E. coli expression plasmids
between the NcoI and EcoRI (or XhoI to express C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged a subunits) restriction sites.
The plasmids pET28-FtnA1His, pET28-FtnA2His,
pET28-FtnA1, pET28-FtnA2, and pET28-FtnB, pET30FtnC overexpressing, respectively, C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged alHis6 and a2His6, and untagged a1, a2,
and b, and N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged b’ subunits, were constructed using routine cloning methods
and verified by sequencing of entire rpo portions for
each plasmid. BL21 (DE3) cells harbouring the pET28arpo-gene plasmids were grown in 500 ml of LB medium,
supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin, at 37°C until
an OD 600 of around 1 was reached. Then the culture
was induced to express an RNAP subunit by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
and allowed to grow for 2-4 hours. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation and stored at -80°C before use.
Protein purification

Frozen cells were thawed and lysed by sonication in a
buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl,
10 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-ME. The lysate was clarified
by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g, and

supernatant was supplemented with ammonium sulphate to precipitate soluble proteins (a2, a1His 6 ,
a2His 6 ). Pellets containing insoluble proteins (a1, b,
a1His6 , a2His6 , His 6-b’) were resuspended in 40 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 M KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.2% Nadeoxycholate to prepare inclusion bodies as described
before [22,42]. Ammonium sulphate precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet, containing
untagged protein (a2), was dissolved in 40 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM 2-ME,
0.1 mM PMSF and loaded onto a 1 ml HiTrap Heparin
HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same
buffer. The bound protein was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (from 0.1 to 1.0 M) in the same buffer. The
pellet containing a1His6 or a2His6 was dissolved in 20
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 2 mM 2-ME, 0.1
mM PMSF, 5 mM imidazole and loaded onto the 1 ml
HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) charged
with Ni2+. The column was washed and bound protein
was step-eluted with 20, 50, or 100 mM imidazole. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled and dialyzed
against two changes of 500 volumes of 40 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM 2ME, 10% glycerol, concentrated by ultrafiltration using
Microsep (PALL, Life Science) centrifugal device, and
stored at -80°C.

100 mM imidazole; a2bb’ RNAP core assembly reactions
were fractionated by gel-filtration on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) in the buffer containing 40 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1
mM 2-ME. Superose 6 fractions were checked for transcription activity on a nucleic acid scaffold. For this purpose, nucleic acid scaffold containing radioactively
labelled 8-nt RNA primer (Figure 3A) was added into
10 μl of the target Superose 6 fraction to obtain artificial
transcription elongation complexes and transcription
was initiated by the addition of NTP and Mg2+. Reaction
products were resolved by denaturing 20% PAGE and
revealed by autoradiography.
Bacterial two-hybrid assays

Gene fragments encoding Francisella a1NTD (residues
1-244), a2NTD (residues 1-242), a1CTD (residues 227323), a2CTD (residues 226-318), were cloned in the
plasmids pBRaLN and pAClcI to gain fusions with E.
coli RNAP aNTD and bacteriophage l cI proteins
respectively [24,43,44]. FW102 F’OL2-62 reporter strain
cells were co-transformed with every possible pairwise
plasmid combination. Individual transformants were
selected and grown in 2 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 25
μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 0.1 mM IPTG. b-galactosidase assays were performed as described earlier [43].

In vitro protein interaction experiments

Purified proteins were mixed together in pairwise combinations of untagged and his-tagged proteins. Before
mixing, proteins in inclusion bodies were solubilised in
denaturing buffer containing 6M guanidine-HCl, 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 μM ZnCl 2 , 1 mM
EDTA, 10mM DTT, 10% glycerol. Coupled proteins
were mixed in 0.5-1 ml of denaturing buffer at equimolar ratio and adjusted to 0.2-0.5 mg/ml total protein
concentration. Refolding of denatured molecules was
achieved by removing guanidine-HCl from reaction mix
through one-change dialysis against 500 ml of reconstitution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 M NaCl, 10
mM MgCl 2 , 10 μM ZnCl 2 , 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM
DTT, 20% glycerol). Precipitate formed during dialysis
was removed by centrifugation. Then supernatant was
diluted 4-fold with start buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0,
0.5 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM imidazole) and loaded
on 0.5 ml His-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma) column
equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed
with start buffer, and proteins were eluted with three
steps of start buffer containing 20, 100, 200 mM imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie-staining.
Reconstitution of a 2 b, and a 2 bb’ was performed as
described above. The a2 b subassemblies were stepwise
fractionated on Ni 2+ -affinity column with 10, 50, and

RpoA comparative analysis

For comparative analysis of two RpoA paralogs in Francisella we retrieved the RefSeq database (NCBI) containing 1055 completely sequenced bacterial genomes on
March 2010. A set of 368 RpoA sequences from 355
representative genomes was aligned with MUSCLE program [45], and the maximum likelihood tree for 246
informative aligned positions was built using FastTree
program [46]. RAxML program [31] was used for reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree for g-proteobacteria
with b-proteobacteria as an outgroup. The same program was used for comparison of the maximum likelihood values for the best and constrained trees. The
evolutionary model for tree reconstitution (WAG [47]
with gamma-distributed evolutionary rates) was selected
with ProtTest program [48].
