Abstract
Background: Genome comparisons have made possible the reconstruction of the eutherian ancestral karyotype
but also have the potential to provide new insights into the evolutionary inter-relationship of the different
eutherian orders within the mammalian phylogenetic tree. Such comparisons can additionally reveal (i) the nature
of the DNA sequences present within the evolutionary breakpoint regions and (ii) whether or not the
evolutionary breakpoints occur randomly across the genome. Gene synteny analysis (E-painting) not only greatly
reduces the complexity of comparative genome sequence analysis but also extends its evolutionary reach.
Results: E-painting was used to compare the genome sequences of six different mammalian species and chicken.
A total of 526 evolutionary breakpoint intervals were identified and these were mapped to a median resolution
of 120 kb, the highest level of resolution so far obtained. A marked correlation was noted between evolutionary
breakpoint frequency and gene density. This correlation was significant not only at the chromosomal level but
also sub-chromosomally when comparing genome intervals of lengths as short as 40 kb. Contrary to previous
findings, a comparison of evolutionary breakpoint locations with the chromosomal positions of well mapped
common fragile sites and cancer-associated breakpoints failed to reveal any evidence for significant co-location.
Primate-specific chromosomal rearrangements were however found to occur preferentially in regions containing
segmental duplications and copy number variants.
Conclusion: Specific chromosomal regions appear to be prone to recurring rearrangement in different
mammalian lineages ('breakpoint reuse') even if the breakpoints themselves are likely to be non-identical. The
putative ancestral eutherian genome, reconstructed on the basis of the synteny analysis of 7 vertebrate genome
sequences, not only confirmed the results of previous molecular cytogenetic studies but also increased the
definition of the inferred structure of ancestral eutherian chromosomes. For the first time in such an analysis, the
opossum was included as an outgroup species. This served to confirm our previous model of the ancestral
eutherian genome since all ancestral syntenic segment associations were also noted in this marsupial.

Background
By comparison with other vertebrates, mammals display a
high degree of karyotype variability. Chromosome numbers vary considerably, ranging from 2n = 6 in the Indian
muntjak [1] to 2n = 102 in the red viscacha rat [2]. Despite
this numerical variability, conserved (syntenic) chromosome segments have been successfully identified by
means of comparative cytogenetics [3]. A conserved
genome framework, initially concealed by inter-species
karyotypic divergence, was first revealed by comparative
gene mapping, but became readily apparent with the
advent of comparative chromosome painting. The application of these methodologies has served to confirm the
presence of a limited number of chromosomal segments
which have been evolutionarily conserved across a variety
of mammalian species [4-7]. Taken together, these
approaches have allowed the reconstruction of synteny
maps of a number of ancestral mammalian genomes [812].
Recently performed comparisons of entire genome
sequences have extended our understanding of the evolutionary history of mammalian genomes by revealing the
presence of a limited number of syntenic segments with
highly conserved gene orders, termed 'conserved linkage
groups' [9,13-16]. These segments can be used, almost as
if they were pieces of a giant jig-saw puzzle, to compare
extant genomes as well as to reconstruct ancestral
genomes. Both comparative chromosome painting and
genome sequence comparisons have indicated that the
human genome possesses an organization which is highly
conserved evolutionarily and which displays considerable
similarity to the postulated ancestral eutherian karyotype
[10,12,17] dating from ~105 million years ago (MYA)
[18].
Ancestral genome models deduced from comparative
cytogenetic analysis exhibit marked differences when
compared to reconstructions of ancestral eutherian
genomes based on whole genome sequence alignments
[19,20]. Recently, we devised a simplified method of comparative genome analysis based on the comparison of
gene order in different species. By focussing exclusively on
the relative positions of genes instead of aligning large
contigs of genomic DNA, this method reduces the complexity of whole genome alignments thereby facilitating
the identification of conserved syntenic segments. This
technique was used successfully to identify the evolutionary origin of the mammalian X chromosome from three
distinct ancestral chromosome building segments [21]
and has also made possible the reconstruction of a vertebrate protokaryotype from 450 MYA [22]. Since this
methodology relies upon in silico gene order comparisons
using genome sequence data from different species, an
approach reminiscent of comparative chromosome paint-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/84

ing, the in silico approach has been termed 'E-painting'
(electronic chromosome painting) [22].
Estimates of the number, location and extent of evolutionary breakpoint intervals vary owing to methodological differences, and this variation has helped to fuel
considerable controversy. Recent comparative genome
sequence studies have been interpreted as indicating that
evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements are non-randomly distributed across mammalian genomes and that
the associated breakpoints have often been 'reused'
[9,23,24]. The resulting 'fragile breakage model' of
genome evolution has therefore presented a direct challenge to the now classical 'random breakage' model of
Nadeau and Taylor [25].
In this study, we have performed an in silico genome-wide
analysis of synteny (E-painting) in order to improve our
understanding of the organization of the ancestral eutherian genome. Our analysis employed genome sequence
data from human [26], mouse [27], rat [28], dog [29],
cow
http://aug2007.archive.ensembl.org/Bos_taurus/
index.html; B_tau3.1, and opossum [30], genomes which
have all been sequenced with at least 7-fold coverage. The
chicken genome sequence [31] was also included in our
comparison since previous studies have shown that
chicken genome organization displays a remarkable
resemblance to that of eutherian mammals [9,21] despite
its evolutionary divergence about 310 MYA.

Results
Establishment of syntenic relationships and reconstruction
of ancestral karyotypes
A previous comparative synteny analysis of about 3000
human genes and their orthologues in 5 other vertebrate
species permitted the first reconstruction of an ancestral
vertebrate karyotype [22]. In this study, we have extended
this comparative approach to identifying syntenic segments of orthologous genes and included all those
human genes for which orthologues have been annotated
in the genomes of mouse, rat, dog, cow, opossum (a marsupial) and chicken. Beginning with 28197 human genes
(Human Genome Assembly 18, NCBI build 36), the
number of orthologous genes in the studied species identified by the program BioMart ranges from 12591 in
chicken to 17796 in mouse (Table 1). The maximum
number of orthologous genes identifiable in a given species (by comparison with human) was recruited on the
basis that the higher the number of genes employed in the
analysis, the more precise would be the identification of
the breakpoint intervals. Had we considered only those
genes for which a one-to-one orthology relationship was
identifiable in all species under investigation, this would
have resulted in a considerable decrease in the number of
genes to be analysed and hence a substantial decrease in

the degree of resolution possible. Instead, the genomewide coverage attained by using the maximum number of
orthologous genes identifiable between human and the
other studied vertebrate species served to optimize the resolution of the mapping of the evolutionary chromosomal
breakpoints.
The dataset from human, representing the best characterized vertebrate genome to date (as well as one of the evolutionarily most conserved karyotypes among eutherian
mammals), provided the reference against which segments of conserved syntenic genes could be identified in
the genomes of the other species under investigation. In
principle, blocks or segments containing syntenic human
genes were sought which are also present as blocks of syntenic genes in the other species under study. Conversion
of the syntenic segment associations into colour-coded
ideograms rendered the conserved syntenic segments
(and at the same time, the breakpoint intervals) readily
identifiable (Figure 1; Additional file 1). The colour code
employed in Figure 2 was used to indicate the orthologous relationships of syntenic segments in a comparison
of the different species with human, as depicted in Figure
1, Additional file 1 and Figure 3. For example, the region
of human chromosome 1 between positions 1.27 Mb and
67.23 Mb is identifiable as a continuous (syntenic) segment on rat chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 4
(Figure 1). During our analysis, we considered as evolutionary breakpoints those disruptions in gene order (synteny) that resulted from (i) interchromosomal
rearrangements in an ancestral species as deduced by
comparing human with one of the other six species under
investigation and (ii) intrachromosomal inversions that
occurred in the human lineage where both breakpoint
regions could be identified. If the breakpoint region of an
interchromosomal rearrangement, identified by comparing the human genome with that of another species, was

found to coincide with the breakpoint of an intrachromosomal rearrangement in any one of the other species, this
intrachromosomal breakpoint was also considered as a
break in synteny.
Employing these criteria to define evolutionary breakpoint intervals, a total of 526 such intervals, with an average size of 290 kb and a median size of 120 kb, were
identified (Table 2; Additional file 2). To visualize all syntenic breakpoint intervals, chromosome ideograms were
drawn up such that all breakpoints were arranged equidistantly, with the precise positions of the breakpoint intervals being demarcated by the genomic coordinates of the
flanking genes (an exemplar is shown in Figure 1 for
HSA1, whilst all ideograms from chromosomes 1 to 22
are depicted in Additional file 1). The orthologous relationships between the analyzed genomes served to identify a total of 38 different ancestral syntenic segments
which are indicated by a colour code in Figure 2. The ideograms in Figure 1 and Additional file 1 are equivalent to
a reverse chromosome painting dataset of the six analyzed
species onto human chromosomes at high resolution. The
precise positions of the genes flanking all identified breakpoint intervals are listed in Additional file 2.
The graphical compilation of syntenic disruptions shown
in Additional file 1 indicates that 7.6% of the evolutionary
breakpoints (N = 40 of 526, highlighted by stippled green
lines) have been 'reused' i.e. breakpoints were found in
the same genomic intervals in at least three species from
two different clades (reused breakpoints are marked in red
in Additional file 1). The assignment of the species under
investigation to different clades within the mammalian
phylogenetic tree is indicated in Additional file 3 (during
this analysis, chicken and opossum were considered as
two different clades). Taking all autosomes into consideration, 218 breakpoint regions were identified in a com-

parison of the chicken and human genomes whereas 153
breaks in synteny serve to differentiate the human and
opossum chromosomes. A total of 27 breakpoints were
found to be shared between chicken and opossum but
were not observed in any other species, suggesting that
these constitute evolutionary breakpoints that occurred in
the eutherian common ancestor (Additional file 2). A
comparison of the gene orders exhibited by both murid
species with those of humans, revealed 106 breaks in synteny (Additional file 2). However, only 4 breaks in synteny were specific to the rat whereas 17 were specific to the
mouse. The many murid-shared breaks in synteny (N =
85) as compared with humans is clearly a reflection of the
extended common phylogenetic history of mouse and rat,
which only became separated into distinct species 16–23
MYA [32,33]. The two ferungulate species, dog and cow,
only share 14 breaks, with 65 breaks being restricted to
the canine lineage and 114 breaks confined to the bovine
lineage [34]. The much higher number of lineage-specific
breaks in these two species, both of which belong to the

Laurasiatheria, is indicative of the longer period of time
that has elapsed since the evolutionary divergence of the
carnivores and artiodactyls ~88 MYA [18].
The version of the cow genome used for our analysis
(Btau_3.1) may contain some local errors caused by intrachromosomal misplacement of scaffold. These intrachromosomal inconsistencies are not however relevant to the
tests we have performed since we were primarily interested in analysing interchromosomal rearrangements
between the human and bovine genomes.
Several breaks in synteny were identified in mouse, rat,
dog, cow, opossum and chicken that are common to all
six species (Additional file 2). The most parsimonious
explanation for this observation is not breakpoint 'reuse'
but rather that these were primate- (or even human-) specific breaks. Some 63 such primate lineage-specific breakpoints were identified and these are indicated by stippled
red lines in the ideograms (Fig. 1A, Additional file 1).

The reconstructed ancestral boreoeutherian karyotype, derived from synteny analyses of human, mouse, rat,
cow, dog, opossum and chicken genome sequences, and based on the identified orthology blocks, is depicted in
Additional file 1. The ideograms represent the 22 autosomal syntenic groups of the ancestral genome as well as the ancestral
X chromosome. The orthologies to the human genome are given for entire chromosomes below each chromosomal ideogram
and to the right of the ideograms for the individual conserved segments. For conserved segments representing portions of
human chromosomes, the positions of the boundaries of the orthologous segments in the human genome are listed above the
ideograms in Mb. Boundaries in agreement with previous findings, and based on comparative cytogenetics, are given in black
whereas the boundaries refined in this study are indicated in blue. The sizes of the chromosomal ideograms reflect the approximate size ratios of the euchromatic orthologous segments in the human genome. The association of the segment orthologous
to HSA10p with segments orthologous to HSA12 and HSA22 is based on comparative chromosome painting data from carnivores [61], hedgehog, several afrotherian [10,60] and xenarthran [55,56] species as well as the opossum genome sequence
[30]. The comparative chromosome painting data for afrotherian and xenarthran species further indicate that the syntenic
groups of the ancestral boreoeutherian karyotype are identical with those of the eutherian karyotype.

Most of these breaks appear to have been caused by primate-specific inversions (N = 22, Table 3). Proportional
to its length, HSA17 is especially rich in such primate-specific inversions. A disproportionate number of these
inversions were also noted in the orthologous segment of
HSA19p in the lineage leading to rodents, in the orthologous segment of HSA20p in the lineage leading to chicken
and in the orthologous segment of HSA1 in the canine lineage (Additional file 1). The remaining primate-specific
breakpoints may be attributable to chromosome fusions
and insertions of small segments.
Employing the previously described method of concatenating overlapping conserved syntenic segments [34], the
eutherian mammal genome data permitted the seamless
assembly of conserved segments into ancestral chromosomes. Ancestral associations between conserved syntenic
segments are identifiable by virtue of the presence of
shared orthologies between mammalian chromosomes
from at least three different species. The resulting model
of the ancestral boreoeutherian genome (Figure 3), with a
chromosome number of 2n = 46, describes the karyotype
of the last common ancestor of primates and rodents
(superorder Euarchontoglires, Additional file 3) as well as
of carnivores and cetartiodactyls (superorder Laurasiatheria).
Chromosomal sites of syntenic breakage
High precision syntenic breakpoint mapping permits the
evaluation, at least in principle, of whether or not these
evolutionary breaks coincide with potential hotspots of
chromosomal rearrangement such as fragile sites or cancer-associated breakpoints. Fragile sites are classified as
either rare (spontaneously occurring) or common (inducible) [35]. Altogether, some 89 common fragile sites have
been mapped at the cytogenetic level [36] although only
the 11 most common autosomal fragile sites have been
precisely characterized at the molecular level [35,37-49].
A comparison of these 11 precisely characterized fragile

sites with the positions of the evolutionary breakpoints
identified in this study indicated that only FRA4F and
FRA7E, which span distances of 5.9 Mb and 4.4 Mb
respectively, partially overlap with evolutionary breakpoint regions (Table 4). For none of the other 524 evolutionary breakpoints was any overlap with a fragile site
observed. Under a random model, we estimate that
~1.23% (37.9/3093) of the 526 observed breakpoints
intervals would have been expected to overlap with one of
the 11 fragile sites. Since only 2/526 breakpoints (0.38%)
were found to display an overlap with a fragile site (p =
0.11), we concluded that there was no evidence for extensive co-location.
A second class of chromosomal breakage hotspot is represented by recurring cancer-associated breakpoints.
Although the majority of such breakpoints have been
assigned to cytogenetic bands, they have not yet been
mapped with any degree of precision. A variety of genes,
with actual or potential roles in tumorigenesis, nevertheless reside at or near these breakpoints. We therefore identified the exact genomic positions of 387 annotated
cancer-associated autosomal genes using the Atlas of
Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology
http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org. For the purposes of this
analysis, only well-established cancer-associated genes
were included (for convenience, these are listed separately
in this database). Other genes in this database that have
not yet been convincingly implicated in cancer were not
included in this analysis. Of the 387 cancer genes, only 13
mapped to evolutionary breakpoint intervals identified in
this study (Table 5, Additional file 2). Since the 526 evolutionary breakpoint intervals together comprise 151.7
Mb of genomic sequence, we estimate that some 20 cancer-associated genes might have been expected to occur
within the breakpoint intervals by chance alone. We
therefore conclude that genes occurring at cancer-associated breakpoints are not disproportionately represented
within regions of evolutionary breakpoints.

These 3 inversion breakpoint regions were deduced, from the human genome sequence, to harbour the second breakpoint of the respective
primate-specific inversions. They were, however, not evident as such in the sequences of the 6 species under investigation (mouse, rat, dog, cow,
chicken and opossum) and hence are not indicated in Additional files 1 and 2.

a: Evolutionary breakpoint intervals are indicated with respect to their position on the orthologous human chromosome.
b: Data on cancer-associated genes were extracted from the Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology http://
atlasgeneticsoncology.org.

The question then arises as to the location of these evolutionary breakpoints in relation to genes and other DNA
sequence features. As mentioned above, a total of 66 primate-specific breaks in synteny were identified in this
analysis. Remarkably, 78% of these breakpoint intervals
coincide with segmental duplications (SDs) in the human
genome (Additional file 2) despite the fact that SDs comprise only 4–5% of the human genome sequence [50-52].
Colocalization with copy number variants (CNVs) was
also observed in the case of 76% of these breakpoints
(Additional file 2). Thus, primate-specific breakpoint
regions would appear to be highly enriched for both SDs
and CNVs.
Those human chromosomes that are known to be genedense also appear to contain significantly more breakpoints than gene-poor chromosomes (Table 6). Indeed, a
strong correlation was noted between protein-coding
gene density and the number of evolutionary breakpoints
per chromosome (r = 0.60; p = 0.0031). When the genedense chromosomes HSA17, HSA19 and HSA22 were
directly compared with the gene-poor chromosomes

HSA13, HSA18 and HSA21, the gene-dense chromosomes
exhibited nearly three times as many breaks per Mb as
gene-poor chromosomes.
We further observed a correlation between transcript density and breakpoint occurrence (r = 0.62, p = 0.0029). To
calculate this correlation coefficient, we used the Human
Transcriptome Map, based on the draft human genome
sequence as provided by the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Project http://genome.ucsc.edu/, which includes all
transcribed sequences except processed pseudogenes
(according to Versteeg et al. [53]). The correlation noted
between transcript density and breakpoint occurrence
became even stronger when chromosomal regions were
considered rather than entire chromosomes. The evolutionary breakpoint regions identified here exhibited a
1.54-fold increase in transcript density for the central 1
Mb of syntenic breakpoint regions as compared to the
genome average (Additional file 4). When this analysis
was further restricted to the 144 most precisely mapped
breakpoint intervals of <40 kb, the transcript density
attained a value some 2.9 times that of the genome-wide

intervals assigned to individual evolutionary lineages
indicated that the breakpoint regions identified in both
chicken and opossum lineages displayed very high transcript densities corresponding to 3.7 times the genomic
average (Table 7).
Random breakage or non-random location of evolutionary
breakpoints
In order to ascertain whether the evolutionary breakpoints identified in this study occurred randomly or were
instead preferentially located in certain genomic regions,
we performed simulation experiments. To avoid consideration of breakpoints that did not result from independent
breakage (and which could have been identical-bydescent), we selected only breakpoints that were present
in mouse, cow, opossum and chicken, respectively. Breakpoints in rat and dog were excluded from this analysis in
order to avoid consideration of breakpoints that could
have been identical-by-descent and shared either by
mouse and rat or by dog and cow. For example, breakpoints present in mouse and rat (as compared to human)
could have been identical-by-descent yet would have been
counted twice in our analysis. Thus, only breakpoints in
mouse and cow were considered (and not those in rat and
dog) in order to avoid the potential double-counting of
some evolutionary breakpoints. Those 63 breakpoint
regions observed in all 4 species (mouse, cow, opossum,
chicken) compared to human, and which were thus specific to the primate lineage, were also excluded (indicated
in yellow in Additional file 2). Finally, a total of 519
breakpoints were considered that were evident in four
species (N = 132 in mouse, N = 143 in cow, N = 89 in
opossum and N = 155 in chicken; Additional file 2). These
519 breakpoints occurred in 410 genomic regions, 324 of
which contained a breakpoint observed in only one species (as compared to human), whereas 63 genomic

regions contained breakpoints in two species, and 23
genomic regions contained breakpoints in three species.
By means of a simulation with 100,000 iterations, we
then estimated the proportion of the genome in which
these 519 breakpoints would have been expected to occur,
by chance alone, given a certain specified number of
genomic regions available to harbour evolutionary breakpoints (Additional file 6). For these simulations, the
human genome was partitioned into 10,000 regions, each
0.3 Mb in length (the average length of the observed
breakpoint regions). Assuming a random breakage model
for the entire genome, partitioned into 10,000 equal-sized
genomic segments available to harbour breakpoint
regions, the 519 evolutionary breakpoints would have
been expected to occur in between 500 and 516 regions
with 99% probability (Additional file 6). In other words,
given random breakage, a maximum of 19/519 (3.7%)
breakpoints might reasonably have been expected to colocate by chance to the same regions at the 1% level of
probability. In practice, however, we have noted that the
519 observed evolutionary breakpoints were confined to
only 410 breakpoint regions. According to our simulations (presented in Additional file 6), this number of
breakpoint regions would be expected if only 7–10% of
the genome (i.e. 700–1000 of the 0.3 Mb regions) were
available to harbour evolutionary breakpoints. Thus,
according to our model-based simulations, the observation of 519 breakpoints being located within 410 out of
10,000 genomic regions is most plausible when the occurrence of breakpoints is confined to only 7–10% of the
genome. Even if we were to assume that some 20% of the
genome could harbour evolutionary breakpoints, the
observed distribution has a <1% probability of occurring
under the model of random breakage. We therefore feel
confident in rejecting the null hypothesis that these breakage events occurred randomly. We instead conclude that

Page 14 of 24

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:84

they occurred preferentially within certain genomic
regions.
Among the 519 breakpoints considered in the above mentioned simulation analysis were 27 breaks in synteny that
occurred in the same genomic interval in both chicken
and opossum, but not in mouse or cow. These breakpoints shared by chicken and opossum could however
have been identical-by-descent and would thus have
occurred only once in the eutherian common ancestor,
not twice as we implicitly assumed in the previously
described simulations. In order to avoid double counting
of some breakpoints, we repeated the simulations, this
time considering only the breakpoint regions in mouse (N
= 132), cow (N = 143) and opossum (N = 89). A total of
41 breakpoint intervals were found to be shared by these
species, whereas 323 breakpoint regions were unique to
the species considered. During these simulations, the
genome was subdivided into 10,000 bins, each of length
0.3 Mb (potential regions for a breakpoint), and the 323
mammalian breakpoints were distributed between these
bins. The simulation experiments served to demonstrate
that the breakpoint positions are incompatible with a random model of breakage. The expected number of breakpoint regions under this model was calculated to be
359.7; in none of the 100,000 simulation runs was such a
low number of breakpoint intervals noted as that actually
observed (N = 323; two-sided p-value approximates zero).
When the model was relaxed to 2000 selected bins (special candidate regions for breakpoints), 342.6 unique
breakpoints would have been expected (two-sided p =
0.00002). On the other hand, a model with 1000 bins, i.e.
one using ~10% of the genome, appears to be compatible
with the observed values: expected number of unique
breakpoints = 322.3 (p = 0.92).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/84

ancestral eutherian genome organization constructed
from such genome sequence alignments display considerable differences with respect to the assignment of ancestral syntenic groups, when compared to models derived
from
comparative
chromosome
painting
data
[12,19,20,59].
E-painting (electronic chromosome painting) [22] was
introduced in order both to overcome the inherent limitations of comparative cytogenetic approaches and to
reduce the complexity of direct whole genome sequence
alignments. This in silico technique is based on the comparative mapping of orthologous genes and the identification of conserved syntenic segments of genes instead of
comparative alignments of large sequence contigs containing intergenic sequences as well as genes. The advantage of E-painting over comparative genome sequence
analysis is that the former reduces the complexity of
genome alignments to easily manageable conserved syntenic segments comprising orthologous genes. Its limitation, however, is that it cannot be applied to the
investigation of telomeric, centromeric or non-genic
regions that could have nevertheless played an important
role during karyotype evolution.
In the present study, E-painting was used to reinvestigate
the previously proposed boreoeutherian protokaryotype
[8,10,12,54]. The resulting model of the boreoeutherian
genome (Figure 3) closely resembles those models previously derived by means of comparative chromosome
painting. Indeed, our data derived from E-painting analysis not only confirmed all major syntenic segment associations proposed in previous studies [8-12] but also served
to refine the model by accommodating short syntenic segments orthologous to portions of chromosomes HSA7,
HSA10, HSA12 and HSA22 (Figure 3).

Discussion
Refining the structure of boreoeutherian ancestral
chromosomes
Comparative genome maps, based on more than eighty
species of eutherian mammal, have previously been generated by chromosome painting. Such analyses have
revealed the pathways of mammalian genome evolution
at the chromosomal level [6-8,10-12,54-57]. However,
comparative chromosome painting is inadequate to the
task of comparing the genomes of species which have
been separated for more than 100 million years. This is
due to the lower hybridization efficiency of probes consequent to increased sequence divergence. Thus, reports of
successful hybridizations of eutherian probes onto marsupial chromosomes are confined to a single chromosome
[58]. To overcome this limitation, comparative genome
sequence analyses based on direct genome alignments
have been performed with the aim of reconstructing precise ancestral gene orders [9,14-16]. However, models of

The improved definition of ancestral eutherian chromosomes by E-painting achieved in this study is particularly
evident in the context of the evolution of chromosomes
HSA12 and HSA22. A common feature of previously proposed protokaryotypes has been the presence of two different protochromosomes displaying associations of
HSA12 and HSA22. As is evident from the colour-coded
ideograms in Fig. 3, the larger protochromosome, 12p-q/
22q, comprises an extended 12p-q segment stretching
from HSA12pter to a point 106.67 Mb from 12q and
includes the terminal segment of HSA22q (31.10 Mb
toward 22qter). Further, we have identified a third proximal 2.7 Mb segment from HSA22q (14.4 Mb to 17.03
Mb) that bears the same colour code in all analyzed species (Figure 4) and which must therefore also form part of
this large protochromosome. Additionally, the E-painting
indicated that the ancestral chromosome orthologous to
HSA10q should be extended by a 1.5 Mb-sized proximal

E-painting results for chromosomes HSA10, HSA12 and HSA22
E-painting results for chromosomes HSA10, HSA12 and HSA22. The stippled red lines indicate regions of primate-specific breakpoints. Black lines within the ideograms represent the positions of breaks in synteny which were probably caused by
inversions. Unique colour codes link the HSA12q distal segment (Mb 107.03–132.00) and the central 22q segment (Mb 17.14–
30.83), representing the smallest eutherian chromosome [10,12] (12b-22b in Figure 2), as well as the segments 12pter-12q (Mb
0–106.67), 22q proximal (Mb 14.4–17.03), and 22q distal (Mb 31.11–49.60) representing a medium-sized eutherian chromosome (12a-22a in Figure 2). In dog and cow, the HSA10p orthologous segment (Mb 0–37.45) bears a colour code that is different from the HSA12 and HSA22 orthologues and hence does not provide any evidence for an evolutionary association.
However, the shared synteny on opossum chromosome 8 confirms previously performed chromosome painting data
[11,56,60], strongly suggesting common ancestral HSA10p/12pq/22q orthology. The E-painting data from the murids are not
informative in this regard.
portion of its p-arm (Figure 4). The existence of this extension was supported by both eutherian and chicken
genome sequence data and indicates that the breakpoint
is located in a region orthologous to 10p rather than
within the centromere (Figure 4).
Importantly, E-painting using the opossum and chicken
genomes indicated an HSA10p/12/22 association (Figure
4). These findings, taken together with recent comparative
chromosome painting data supporting the 10p/12/22
association in the Afrotheria and in some Xenarthra
[10,11,56,60] and carnivores [61], strongly corroborate
an ancestral 10p/12/22 chromosome as part of the ancestral eutherian karyotype. Furthermore, this 10p/12/22
association is compatible with an ancestral eutherian
chromosome number of 2n = 46 (Figure 3).
The extensive agreement between ancestral genome
reconstructions based respectively upon comparative
chromosome painting and E-painting is strongly supportive of the validity of the E-painting approach. Further, the
E-painting analysis performed here has confirmed the previously proposed ancestral eutherian chromosome associations, 3/21, 4/8, 7/16, 10/12/22, 12/22, 16/19 and 14/
15 [8-12], since all these associations are readily identifiable in the opossum genome. However, the 3/21 association in the opossum involves a different set of genes as
compared to the 3/21 association in the eutherian species,
thereby indicating the presence of additional rearrangements involving the corresponding chromosomal regions
in marsupials.
Recent comparative chromosome painting studies performed with several afrotherian [10,55,60,62] and xenarthran species [11,56,63] have indicated that their
karyotypes display a remarkable degree of similarity to the
previously proposed ancestral boreoeutherian karyotype
[12]. The chromosomal associations 1/19 and 5/21 seem,
however, to be specific to afrotherians [55,56,62,64] with
no xenarthran-specific chromosomal rearrangements having been identified as yet [11,56].

Our findings indicate that none of the afrotherian-specific
rearrangements are evident in the opossum genome. This
finding, together with the observation that the above
mentioned ancestral eutherian chromosome associations
are also present in the opossum, suggest that the ancestral
boreoeutherian karyotype is very similar to the ancestral
eutherian karyotype (see Additional file 3 for an overview
of the phylogenetic relationships among the major placental groups, according to Wildman et al. [65]).
Chromosomal distribution of evolutionary breakpoints
The comparative synteny analysis presented here has succeeded in defining evolutionary chromosomal breakpoints with a considerably higher degree of resolution
than has previously been achieved. For example, the
length of the median breakpoint interval in this study is
only 120 kb (Table 2). Furthermore, the average length
(290 kb) of the breakpoint intervals assigned here is about
a quarter of that reported by Murphy et al. [9]. Ruiz-Herrera et al. [66], in a second related study, included data
from Murphy et al. [9] but added further species with even
less precisely defined breakpoint data. The present study
has avoided the uncertainty inherent in matching up
cytogenetic band information with genome sequence
data. The assessment of the spatial correlation between
evolutionary chromosomal breakpoints and DNA
sequence features such as gene density, GC-content, segmental duplications and copy number variations (as well
as cytogenetic features such as fragile sites and cancerassociated breakpoints), promises to yield new insights
into mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangement whose
relevance may well extend beyond the confines of evolution and into the sphere of genetic disease (and particularly
tumorigenesis).

In this study, a total of 526 evolutionary breakpoint intervals were identified. Knowledge of their respective
genomic positions then allowed us to address the question as to whether evolutionary breakpoints co-locate
with cancer-associated breakpoints and/or common fragile sites, an issue which has been quite contentious over
the last few years [23,67]. The original 'random breakage

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:84

model' of Nadeau and Taylor [25] has been challenged by
Pevzner and Tesler [68] who favour an alternative model
in which at least some evolutionary breakpoint regions
are prone to repeated breakage in the context of diseaserelated rearrangements. Inherent to the latter model is the
prediction that evolutionary breaks will frequently overlap with fragile sites and cancer-associated breakpoints
[9,66,69,70]. The precise mapping data presented here are
not however compatible with such a physical overlap of
breakpoints. When considering fragile sites, rare and common sites must be clearly distinguished [35]. Rare fragile
sites are less frequent and, at the DNA sequence level, are
associated with expanded repeats. In some cases, such
sites are associated with a specific clinical phenotype [36].
By contrast, common fragile sites (numbering 89 according to Debacker and Kooy [36]) are observed in different
mammalian species [71,72] and may be spatially associated with large active gene clusters [35]. In our analysis,
we focussed exclusively on the 11 common fragile sites
that have been well characterized at the DNA sequence
level [35,38-49] but only two of these sites were found to
exhibit partial overlap with an evolutionary breakpoint
interval (N = 526) identified here (Table 4). We cannot
however make any statement with respect to a potential
overlap between the evolutionary breakpoints and those
common fragile sites that are hitherto poorly mapped and
remain uncharacterized at the DNA sequence level.
A second class of common chromosomal breakpoint is
represented by those breakpoints associated with tumorigenesis. These cancer-related breakage events frequently
generate fusion genes that are commonly characterized by
gains of function [73]. To refine the DNA sequence positions of known cancer-associated breakpoints, we utilized
the known sequence coordinates of 387 cancer-associated
genes. These were then cross-compared with the 526 evolutionary breakpoint intervals identified in our analysis.
However, no evidence was found for the known cancerassociated genes (and hence their associated breakpoint
regions) being over-represented within regions of evolutionary chromosomal breakpoints.
A word of caution is appropriate here. Although it may
eventually prove possible to identify unequivocally the
positions of many evolutionary and cancer-associated
breakpoints, there is no a priori reason to suppose that
these breakpoints should occur in precisely the same locations. Indeed, there is every reason to believe that, even if
we were to focus our attention upon those breakpoints
which colocalize to the extended regions characterized by
segmental duplication, these breakpoints would probably
occur in heterogeneous locations with respect to the various genes present within the unstable regions. This is
because, in order to come to clinical attention, somatic
cancer-associated gene rearrangements must confer a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/84

growth advantage upon the affected cells or tissue, usually
via gene deregulation or through the creation of a fusion
gene. Evolutionary rearrangements (which must, by definition, be heritable and hence occur in germ cells) represent the other side of the coin: they could not have
become fixed had they been disadvantageous to individuals of the species concerned. It follows that the rearrangements derived in these two quite different contexts (i.e.
somatic/cancer-associated versus germ cell/evolutionary)
are likely (i) to have affected the structure, function and
expression of different genes in different ways, (ii) to have
been subject to quite different 'selective pressures' in these
different contexts and hence (iii) would have been most
unlikely to have occurred in precisely the same genomic
locations. In agreement with these predictions, a different
regional distribution of cancer-associated and evolutionary breakpoints has been noted by Sankoff et al. [74]
whilst Helmrich et al. [47] failed to detect any overlap
between fragile sites and evolutionary breakpoints.
Our E-painting data do however provide some support for
the postulate that evolutionary breakpoints have been
'reused', sensu lato [9]. Indeed, 7.6% of the identified evolutionary breakpoint intervals identified here contain two
or more breakpoints. By computer simulation, we confirmed that the distribution of the 519 observed breakpoints into only 410 different genomic segments is best
explained by non-random breakage with only ~7–10% of
the genome harbouring evolutionary breakpoints. This
proportion is somewhat lower than that previously
reported (20%) for the 'reuse' of breakpoint regions [9]
but this could be due to the higher resolution breakpoint
mapping achieved here. Recently, breakpoint 'reuse' has
also been noted in the case of a recurrent inversion on the
eutherian X chromosome [75] and in a comparison of
chicken chromosome GGA28 with orthologous syntenic
segments in human, fish (Fugu), amphibian (Xenopus),
opossum, dog and mouse [24]. Taken together, these findings are quite compatible with the fragile breakage model
of chromosome evolution first proposed by Pevzner and
Tesler [68] and sustained by the more recent analysis of
Alekseyev and Pevzner [76].
Our data confirm and extend previous reports of associations between segmental duplications (SDs) with evolutionary rearrangements [77,78]. SDs comprise 4–5% of
human autosomal euchromatin [50-52] whereas the primate lineage-specific breakpoint intervals comprise
0.86% of the euchromatin. This notwithstanding, some
78% of the evolutionary breakpoint intervals colocalize
with known SDs whilst 76% coincide with regions of
known copy number variation (Additional file 2). These
proportions are significantly higher than those reported
from comparative analyses of evolutionary breakpoints
between the human and murine lineages [51,78]. This dif-

Page 18 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:84

ference is probably due to the focus in the present analysis
having been placed upon primate lineage-specific breakage.
Turning to the sites at which evolutionarily fixed chromosomal breaks have occurred, we have previously mapped
at the DNA sequence level the breakpoints of eight inversions that serve to distinguish the human and chimpanzee
karyotypes [79-81]. None of these rearrangements is as yet
known to be associated with either the activation or inactivation of genes at or near the breakpoint sites. The
present study indicates that, at least in the primate lineage,
the evolutionary breakpoints are enriched for SDs whilst
overlapping to a similar extent with sites of known copy
number variants. This concurs with recent findings from
comparative studies of syntenic disruptions between gibbon and human chromosomes [82,83]. Indeed, nearly
half of all gibbon-human breaks in synteny occur within
regions of segmental duplication in the human genome,
thereby providing further evidence for the evolutionary
plasticity of these regions which has clearly been responsible for promoting a significant proportion of the chromosomal breaks in primates [51].
Our analysis has revealed an even stronger correlation
between high gene density and evolutionary fragility than
that previously reported [9]. Although the evolutionary
breakpoint regions identified here display about 3 to 4
times the transcript density of the euchromatic genome
average (Table 7), it would seem rather unlikely that evolutionary breakpoints have frequently disrupted gene coding regions. Intriguingly, a study of chicken chromosome
GGA28 [24] has revealed that evolutionary breakpoint
regions, identified through the analysis of human-chicken
synteny, are disproportionately located in regions with a
high GC-content and high CpG island density rather than
in gene-dense regions per se. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that at least some of these evolutionary breakpoints,
particularly those occurring in gene-associated CpGislands, could have contributed to functional changes in
mammalian gene structure or expression [24].

Conclusion
In summary, we have presented an approach that greatly
reduces the complexity of comparative genome sequence
analysis and which is capable of providing valuable
insights into the dynamics of eutherian karyotype evolution. The gene synteny analysis data yielded high definition evolutionary breakpoint maps which have
significantly improved the resolution of existing maps
derived by chromosome painting [84]. Correlation analyses with similarly well mapped cancer-associated breakpoints and fragile sites however failed to provide any
evidence for an association with evolutionary breakpoints. We nevertheless noted a higher than previously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/84

observed positive correlation of evolutionary breakpoints
with gene density and also corroborated the reported
association of segmental duplications with evolutionary
breakpoints in the primate lineage. The ancestral eutherian genome, reconstructed through E-painting, displays a
high degree of agreement with that derived from the much
larger comparative cytogenetic dataset. The inclusion of a
marsupial genome in this comparison, which has not
hitherto been attempted, suggested that the ancestral
boreoeutherian karyotype was probably very similar to
the ancestral eutherian karyotype.

Methods
Gene synteny analysis
The synteny comparisons across different vertebrate species were carried out in silico by means of reciprocal BLAST
'best-hit' searches using the ENSEMBL database; http://
www.ensembl.org. Only genomes with at least a 7-fold
sequence coverage were included in the analysis (human,
mouse, rat, cow, dog, chicken, opossum). Data mining for
established protein coding genes was performed using the
program BioMart (http://www.ensembl.org; ENSEMBL
release 46). Orthologous gene location data were
retrieved from the genomes of rat, mouse, dog, cow, opossum and chicken, and were arranged by reference to the
human gene order (NCBI Build 36). For the purposes of
this analysis, a syntenic segment was defined as consisting
of a group of contiguous genes in humans as well as in the
other species under investigation (mouse, rat or dog etc).
We have included in these gene order comparisons all
those human genes for which orthologues have been
annotated in the genomes of mouse, rat, dog, cow, opossum and chicken. Only segments with three or more consecutive syntenic genes were considered in order to avoid
annotation errors or the inclusion of pseudogenes and retrotransposed genes. To aid visualization, the syntenic segments were individually identified by differential colour
coding according to the colour code given in Figure 2.
Breakpoint intervals were defined by the last gene from
the proximal syntenic segment and the first gene from the
following more distal syntenic segment of the respective
species (summarized in Additional file 2). Gene positions
are given in Mb according to the human genome sequence
http://www.ensembl.org. The data analysis was otherwise
performed as previously described [22,34].

Gene density calculations were carried out using Stata
software (StataCorp, College Station, TX) based on the
transcriptome data presented by Versteeg et al. [53] with
updates available through the Human Transcriptome
Map http://bioinfo.amc.uva.nl/HTMseq.
The diploid chromosome numbers of the species investigated are: N = 40 in mouse; N = 42 in rat; N = 60 in cow;
N = 78 in dog; N = 18 in opossum; N = 78 in chicken. The

assembly of conserved syntenic segments into ancestral
chromosomes was used to model the ancestral boreoeutherian karyotype with a chromosome number of 2n = 46.
Bovine genome versions
At the time of writing, the bovine genome sequence
remains unpublished although a near complete version
(B_tau3.1) was made available to us for the purposes of
this study B_tau3.1 http://www.ensembl.org/Bos_taurus/
index.html. B_tau3.1 has recently been replaced by the
latest version B_tau4.0. The only major differences
between the two versions of the bovine genome sequence
resulted from scaffolds being misplaced within chromosomes BTA6, 19 and 29, respectively. These errors could
however only account for the misclassification of intrachromosomal rearrangement breakpoints. Our synteny
comparisons were, by contrast, largely based on the identification of interchromosomal rearrangements (syntenic
genes in humans being located on two different chromosomes in the species under investigation). Nevertheless,
re-examination of our data allowed us to conclude that
our original results were not affected in any way by the
occasional intrachromosomal misplacement of scaffolds
on the BTA chromosomes in version B_tau3.1. All six
intrachromosomal breakpoints (involving BTA chromosomes 6, 19 and 29) were found to coincide with breakpoints identified in other species (Additional file 1).
Indeed, four of these 6 intrachromosomal breakpoints
coincided with breakpoints in two or more additional
species. It therefore follows that the removal of these
B_tau3.1-derived 'breakpoints' from our analysis would
not have resulted in any reduction in the overall breakpoint number.

Simulation experiments
To assess whether the positions of the breakpoints identified in this study would fit best with a model of random
or non-random chromosomal breakage during vertebrate
karyotype evolution, 100,000 simulation experiments
were performed. Depending upon the number of
genomic regions of length 0.3 Mb available for evolutionary breakpoints, the expected number of different breakpoint regions assumed to harbour a total of 519 observed
breakpoints (N = 132 in mouse, 143 in cow, 89 in opossum and 155 in chicken) was estimated under a model of
random breakpoint selection in each species. The deduced
relationship between the number of genomic segments
available for chromosomal breakage and the expected and
observed numbers of genomic segments used by 519
breakpoints has been graphically depicted (Additional file
6). Additionally, the '99%-probability intervals' were
determined to provide an indication of the ranges over
which the different breakpoint regions are situated with a
probability of 99%. The expected numbers of genomic
segments were then directly compared with the observed
number of 410 regions actually used. Thus, for example, if
1000 segments (corresponding to ~10% of the genome)
were available to harbour evolutionary breakpoints, some
427 would have been expected to be used by 519 breakpoints. The probability that <409 or >445 segments
would contain a breakpoint was calculated to be only
~1%.

Assessment of overlap between evolutionary breakpoints
and common fragile sites
The χ2-goodness-of-fit (exact version implemented in
SAS) was applied to test whether the overlap between
autosomal fragile sites and evolutionary breakpoint intervals is non-random. The genomic region covered by 11
selected fragile sites is 34.6 Mb, as summarized in Table 4,
amounting to 1.12% of the autosomal genome (assuming
it to be 3093 Mb). Since the average extension of a breakpoint interval is 0.3 Mb, it is on average sufficient for an
overlap that the midpoint of a breakpoint interval lies
within the borders of a fragile site ± 0.15 Mb, an area
which amounts to 34.6+11 × 0.3 = 37.9 Mb. Thus, under
a random model, ~1.23% (37.9/3093) of the 526
observed breakpoints intervals would be predicted to
overlap with a fragile site. Since only 2/526 breakpoints
(0.38%) were found to display an overlap with a fragile
site (p = 0.11), there was no evidence for significant colocation.
