between dissimilar genes to create new recombinant genes
(see, for example [4,5]). We here choose to call only this kind
of recombination gene shuffling, excluding, for example,
duplication of domains within a gene. In such a gene shuffling
event, the parental genes may be either destroyed or preserved [6]. Gene shuffling is clearly the most potent of the
three causes of functional innovation because it can generate
new genes with a structure drastically different from that of

information

How do genes with new functions originate? This remains
one of the most intriguing open questions in evolutionary
genetics. Three principal mechanisms can create genes of
novel function: point mutations and small insertions or deletions in existing genes; duplication of entire genes or domains
within genes, in combination with mutations that cause functional divergence of the duplicates [1-3]; and recombination

interactions

Conclusion: The incidence of gene shuffling is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the
incidence of single-gene duplication in eukaryotes, but it can approach or even exceed the geneduplication rate in prokaryotes. If true in general, this pattern suggests that gene shuffling may not
be a major force in reshaping the core genomes of eukaryotes. Our results also cast doubt on the
notion that introns facilitate gene shuffling, both because prokaryotes show an appreciable
incidence of gene shuffling despite their lack of introns and because we find no statistical association
between exon-intron boundaries and recombined domains in the two multicellular genomes we
studied.

refereed research

Results: We have studied shuffling in genes that are conserved between distantly related species.
Specifically, we estimated the incidence of gene shuffling in ten organisms from the three domains
of life: eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaea, considering only genes showing significant sequence
similarity in pairwise genome comparisons. We found that successful gene shuffling is very rare
among such conserved genes. For example, we could detect only 48 successful gene-shuffling
events in the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster which have occurred since its common
ancestor with the worm Caenorhabditis elegans more than half a billion years ago.

deposited research

Background: Among three sources of evolutionary innovation in gene function - point mutations,
gene duplications, and gene shuffling (recombination between dissimilar genes) - gene shuffling is
the most potent one. However, surprisingly little is known about its incidence on a genome-wide
scale.

either parental gene. Laboratory evolution studies show that
gene shuffling allows new gene functions to arise at rates of
orders of magnitudes higher than point mutations [7,8].
Much is known about rates of point mutations [9] and of gene
duplications [10,11]. In contrast, the rate at which gene shuffling occurs is relatively unexplored, despite the importance
of shuffling for functional innovation. To be sure, anecdotal
evidence suggests that successful gene shuffling occurs and
that it creates genes with new functions [4]. In particular,
proteins are often mosaics of domains that are characterized
by sequence and structural similarity [12-19]. Many domains
occur in multiple proteins of different functions, suggesting
that new proteins can arise through the combination of
domains of other proteins, a process requiring recombination. In addition, many studies have systematically identified
one subclass of gene-recombination events - gene fusions
[20-24]. These studies count gene fusion events in a genome
of interest relative to multiple, often very distantly related,
species. Because fused genes often have similar functions,
identification of fusion events can aid in inferring gene functions. Here we address a question that goes beyond the above
studies: how frequent is gene shuffling in comparison with
other forces of genome change, such as gene duplication?
This problem is difficult because of the many possible outcomes of recombination events. These outcomes fall into
three principal categories, gene fusions, domain deletions,
and domain insertions (Figure 1a). To identify these outcomes systematically on a genomic scale is computationally
intensive, which has limited our analyses to a modest number
of genomes (Table 1).
One can identify gene-shuffling events either from protein
sequence information or from information about protein
structure. Structure-based approaches [12-15] have the
advantage of being able to detect recombination events where
sequence similarity between a recombination product and its
parents has eroded beyond recognition. However, because

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/6/R50

two very distantly related structural domains can also have
arisen through convergent evolution [25,26], identifying
common ancestry of two domains based on structure alone
can be problematic. As a further limitation, structure-based
approaches can only identify recombination events that
respect the boundaries of protein domains, whereas some
successful recombination events may occur within domains
[27-29]. In addition, structural information is not available
for all genes. For example, the Pfam database of protein
domains [30] contains no structural information for more
than 40% of proteins in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Structure-based approaches may thus miss many
shuffled genes. Because of these issues we chose a sequencebased approach which allows us to search for shuffling events
without making restrictive assumptions regarding their
nature. Essentially, our search imposes no restrictions on
shuffling except that it must merge in a single gene two protein-coding sequences that were previously a part of two different genes. We thus avoid assuming that shuffling occurs
only at domain boundaries or with certain recombination
mechanisms without precluding either possibility. Our analysis can also account for gene-duplication events in either
parental or recombined genes.
We here identify gene-shuffling events that have occurred in
a 'test' species T since its divergence from a reference species
R1. A gene in the test genome whose parts match more than
one gene in the reference genome is a candidate for a geneshuffling event that has occurred since the common ancestor
of the two genomes. Our analysis also uses a third genome
(reference genome R2) to prevent gene fission or gene loss in
the reference genome R1 from resulting in spurious identification of gene shuffling events. Because R2 is an outgroup relative to T and R1, it allows us to detect such events in R1 (see
Figure 1b). Like any comparative sequence-based approach,
our analysis depends on detectable sequence similarity
among genes. In other words, our analysis excludes rapidly
evolving genes.

information

In addition to raising problems, the comparison of distantly
related genomes also has one advantage: such genomes are
more likely to be annotated independently from each other
than are closely related genomes. In a group of closely related
genomes, the first sequenced genome may often be used as a
guidepost to annotate the other genomes, which may lead to
errors (for instance, by misidentifying a shuffled region as an
intron).

interactions

Mosaic proteins are not rare in most genomes, which suggests
that successful gene shuffling might be frequent on an evolutionary timescale. We thus searched four closely related
genomes for shuffled genes. These genomes fit three essential
criteria for this analysis: close taxonomic spacing; availability
of complete genome sequence; and, most important, reliable
gene identification. (Gene identification is notoriously unreliable in higher organisms because of their complex gene structure.) These species were the four yeasts Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. bayanus and S. mikatae [31],
which diverged from their common ancestor between 5 and
20 million years ago (Mya) [31]. We found multiple candidate
genes for shuffling in different T-R1 pairs of these four species. However, almost all of these candidates proved spurious
for a variety of reasons: First, some of them occurred in two

from T.

deposited research

Has shuffled gene
Has non-shuffled gene

Because our analysis of yeast genomes suggests that gene
shuffling may be rarer than one might expect, the need arises
to study more distantly related genomes. This raises two principal problems. First, such an analysis will miss events where
either parental or shuffled genes have diverged beyond
sequence recognition since two genomes shared a common
ancestor. We thus emphasize that our analysis applies only to
'core' genomes: genes so well conserved that their homology
even among distantly related species is beyond doubt. The
incidence of shuffling among more rapidly evolving genes
may be different and cannot be estimated with this approach.
In this regard, we also note that our analysis cannot simply
use multiple outgroups for a given test genome [20-24] to
solve this problem, because doing so has the potential to
misestimate shuffling rates by making wrong assumptions
about the most parsimonious placement of such events (especially among prokaryotes, where horizontal transfer of shuffled genes may occur). For the remainder of our analysis, we
chose ten distantly related genomes (Table 1) that best met
the joint requirements of well known phylogenetic relationships and reliably annotated genome sequences (which is
often problematic for the higher eukaryotes).

or more species in a manner inconsistent with these species'
phylogeny, or they matched more closely a single reference
species gene than their two putative parents. Both observations make recent recombination an unparsimonious explanation for a gene's origin (Figure 1b). Second, the putative
shuffled domains in some candidate genes had a synonymous, or silent, nucleotide divergence from their parental
domains that differed by a factor of two or more. However,
the recombined parts of a shuffled gene should show equal
sequence divergence to their respective parental genes,
because they have identical divergence times (namely the
time since T and R1 shared a common ancestor). We used
silent nucleotide substitutions as an indicator of sequence
divergence because such substitutions are under little or no
selection and thus accumulate in an approximately clock-like
fashion [32]. Use of amino-acid changing (nonsynonymous)
substitutions (Ka) as an indicator led to similar conclusions.
After exclusion of all such spurious genes, only two potential
shuffled genes remained in our analysis, which indicates a
low incidence of gene shuffling.

*Note that to obtain shuffling events/per gene/Ks = 1.0 (Table 1) we divided the average Ks by 2.
This was done because Ks is a pairwise distance, meaning that it gives the sum of the divergences from the common ancestor to T and from the
common ancestor to R1. The same was done for the Ka analysis.

gene-shuffling events among the 5,800 genes considered
(Table 2) may have been preserved in Caenorhabditis elegans
since its common ancestor with Drosophila melanogaster,
which lived around 600 Mya [33]. Similarly, only four surviving recombination events (out of 2,300 genes) may have
occurred in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
since its split from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe more than 300 Mya [34]. We emphasize that all these
numbers refer to shuffled genes that have 'survived': extant
genome sequences alone are insufficient for estimating the
frequency of the recombination events themselves, since the
products of these events often will not become fixed in populations.
One further observation indicates the rarity of gene shuffling:
most shuffled genes contain at least one domain of low
sequence similarity to a parental gene. The above analysis is
based on identifying sequence domains as homologous in a
parental and recombined gene if they show more than 35%
amino-acid sequence identity. Increasing this identity threshold to 40% can reduce the number of candidate shuffled genes
dramatically (see Table 2). For instance, it removes 28 of 48
shuffled fruit fly genes and half of the shuffled fission yeast
genes. This observation underscores that shuffling is rare
among highly conserved genes: otherwise we would see
higher sequence similarities among parental/recombined
domain pairs.
Figure 2 shows representative examples of shuffled genes,
illustrating some of the types of recombination diagrammed
in Figure 1a. For example, Figure 2b shows the budding yeast

his4 gene, which is involved in histidine biosynthesis. This
(apparent fusion) gene appears to combine the functions of
the two fission yeast genes his7 (a phosphoribosyl-AMP
cyclohydrolase) and his2 (a histidinol dehydrogenase) [35].
Figure 2c shows the fruit fly gene Aats-tyr, a tyrosyl-tRNA
synthetase [36]. This gene is a likely recombination product
of a predicted worm methionyl-tRNA synthetase gene mrs-1
[37] and a second worm gene Y105E8A.19 of unknown function. A list of all shuffled genes identified in these ten
genomes is available in Additional data file 1.

Gene shuffling and structural domains
Because our approach is based on sequence domains, we
wished to find out whether the recombined regions of shuffled genes match structural protein domains. If so, this would
indicate that successful recombination events - events preserved in the evolutionary record - occur mostly at structural
domain boundaries. To address this question, we used the
Pfam database [30,38] of protein domains to identify
domains in our shuffled genes that were significant at E ≤ 105. These Pfam domains were compared to the sequence alignments that we used to identify shuffled genes in the first place.
As Figure 3 shows, the boundaries of recombined sequence
domains and Pfam structural domains tend to coincide (P <
0.001 using a domain randomization approach, see Materials
and methods). However, Figure 3 also suggests that not all
successful recombination events occur at structural domain
boundaries. Experimental and computational work on
individual proteins [27] supports the notion that successful
recombination occurs preferentially, but not exclusively, at
structural domain boundaries.

the sequences in question. However, contrary to these expectations, we found no tendency for our shuffling boundaries to
associate with exon-intron boundaries (P > 0.1, domain randomization test; see Materials and methods).

The incidence of gene shuffling
We cannot estimate the incidence of gene shuffling in absolute (geological) time, because divergence dates for most of
our test species are unknown or highly uncertain. In addition,
the rarity of gene-shuffling events further complicates such
estimates. However, we can obtain order-of-magnitude estimates of the incidence of gene shuffling relative to the

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R50

information

The exon-shuffling/introns-early hypothesis [39-41] predicts
that exon-intron boundaries delimit functional domains and
hence that recombination events that preserve exons would
be more likely to yield functional recombinant proteins. Long
introns also increase the probability of a DNA-level recombination event preserving exons (since in this case the number
of possible DNA-level recombination events leading to the
same recombinant protein may be quite large), a further reason to expect an association of shuffling boundaries and exon
boundaries. The two multicellular eukaryotes (Drosophila
and C. elegans) have a sufficient number of introns to allow
us to test this prediction by comparing the boundaries of

We then used this ratio to estimate the ratio of gene-shuffling
events per gene duplication event (Table 1). To do so, we first
had to estimate the number of gene-shuffling events per gene,
which we obtained by dividing the number s of gene-shuffling
events in a test species T (Table 1) by the average number h of
genes in T or R1 with detectable sequence similarity to genes
in the other genome (Table 2). This approach of estimating
the number of gene-shuffling events per gene compensates
for the reduced ability to recognize gene homology in distantly related genomes. The ratio of shuffling events per
duplication can then be calculated as (s/h)/(d/g). Figure 4a
compares this ratio for the organisms we studied. The bacteria analyzed share with the archaeans a high incidence of gene
shuffling relative to duplication, while the eukaryotes show a
much lower incidence. The Bacillus species (B. anthracis and
B. cereus) have a much higher relative incidence of gene shuffling than any other species pair we studied.

incidence of other mutational events important in genome
evolution. One such event is gene duplication, whose incidence has been estimated previously [10,11].
To compare the incidence of gene duplication to that of gene
shuffling, we cannot rely on the silent nucleotide divergence
among duplicate genes to estimate the rate of duplication, as
is commonly done [10,11], because several of our study
genomes are very distantly related. We thus estimated the
rate at which gene duplications occurred in a test species T
since its common ancestor with R1 using the following
approach. We identified, for each test species T, all genes that
had only a single homolog in the reference species R1. We
denote the number of these reference species genes as g. Second, for each of these genes i we determined the number ni of
test species genes homologous to gene i. If this number ni is
greater than 1, then the test species homolog of gene i underwent one or more duplications since the common ancestor of
T and R1. We estimated the (minimal) number of duplication
events necessary to establish a gene family of size ni as

di =  log 2 ( ni )  . The total estimated number d of gene


duplications for the g reference species genes then calculates
g

as the sum d = ∑ i =1 di . Values for g and d are shown for each
reference species in Table 2. One can view the ratio d/g as the
per-gene incidence of gene duplication.

Other mutations useful to calibrate the incidence of gene
shuffling are nonsynonymous (amino-acid replacement) and
synonymous (silent) mutations on DNA. Synonymous substitutions are an indicator of divergence time between two genes
or species because they are subject to few evolutionary constraints and thus may change at an approximately constant
(neutral) rate [32]. We estimated the incidence of gene shuffling relative to synonymous substitutions by first determining the average fraction, Ks, of synonymous nucleotide
changes per synonymous nucleotide site for 100 orthologous
genes in a T-R1 species pair. We then simply divided the
number of gene-shuffling events per gene (s/h) by this average Ks (Figure 4b). The evolutionary distance of two of our
species pairs (E. coli vs Salmonella and B. anthracis vs B.
cereus was sufficiently low to allow us to directly calculate the
average synonymous divergence for 100 pairs of randomly
selected single-copy orthologs in the test and reference species (see Materials and methods). For the other species pairs,
most synonymous sites are saturated with substitutions [32].
In these cases, we thus extrapolated the value of Ks between
R1 and T from that observed between either of these species
and a third, closely related species (see Materials and methods for details). We emphasize that this procedure would be
unsuitable to make evolutionary inferences for any one gene,
because it introduces considerable uncertainty into our estimates. It is, however, adequate to identify the approximate,
genome-wide patterns we are concerned with.
Finally, we also estimated, completely analogously, the
number of gene-shuffling events per unit amino-acid divergence (Ka = 1). These results are summarized in Table 1 and
Figure 4c. The incidence of gene shuffling relative to silent
and amino-acid divergence varies less systematically among
the domains of life than that of gene shuffling relative to
duplication. However, it is again apparent from these analyses that successful gene shuffling is very rare for conserved
genes. For some species, crude estimates of the absolute geological time needed for two sequences to accumulate a

Several lines of evidence show that successful gene shuffling
is very rare for genes conserved between the distantly related
genomes we studied. For the single-celled yeasts - currently
the only group of very closely related eukaryotes with
sufficiently reliable genome annotation - shuffling appears
rare in the genome as a whole. In most of the genomes we
analyzed, gene shuffling is much rarer than other important
kinds of mutations affecting gene structure, such as gene
duplication. For example, in the time that it takes to accumulate Ks = 0.01 synonymous substitutions per synonymous site,
other research indicates that ten fruit fly genes and 164 worm
genes undergo duplication [10]. In contrast, each lineage has
only a 50% chance of undergoing a successful gene shuffling
event in the same amount of time (if one assumes our estimates can be applied to the entire genome). We note that our
estimates of duplication rates are more conservative than
those of others [10], partly because we limit ourselves to single-gene duplications. The fact that we still see a lower

A multidomain protein may include both distinct and
repeated structural domains [13]. Multidomain proteins with
repeated domains raise a special problem for identifying
gene-shuffling events: a shuffling event followed by domain
duplication might lead us to miss a shuffled gene because our
local alignments of that gene to its parental genes would only
include one copy of the duplicated domain and hence might
reveal less than the 50% of alignable amino-acid residues we
require (see Materials and methods). To assess whether this
problem would substantially bias our results, we examined
candidate shuffled genes that had been excluded by our criterion (that is, those having between 10% and 50% of their residues alignable). We asked whether a failure to account for
domain duplication was responsible for their exclusion. After
adding potentially duplicated domains to the aligned regions
of these genes, we found that only a handful of them (two
genes in Drosophila and three in C. elegans) met our 50%
alignability threshold. Failure to account for domain duplications internal to a gene is thus not the reason for our low estimates of the incidence of gene shuffling.

pairwise divergence of one silent nucleotide substitution per
silent site are available. In the fruit fly this amount of time is
approximately equal to 64 million years [32]. During this
period of time, we would expect only 5,864 × 2.8 × 10-3 = 16
gene shuffling events to occur (Tables 1 and 2; 5,864 is the
average number of fruit fly and worm genes in our core gene
set). By way of comparison, even using our very conservative
method of counting duplicate genes, we would expect 146
gene duplications in this period. Similarly, in the yeast S. cerevisiae, where Ks = 1 synonymous substitutions accumulate
every 100 million years [42], one would expect three shuffling
events during this period of time (2,365 × 1.3 × 10-3), as compared to 200 gene duplications. We emphasize that these are
order-of-magnitude estimates that mainly serve to underscore the rarity of successful gene shuffling.

incidence of shuffling than duplication (Figure 4) is thus all
the more remarkable.

Discussion

The rarity of gene shuffling relative to gene duplication has a
simple potential explanation. A gene duplication creates a
copy of a gene while preserving an original that is able to exercise its function. In contrast, unless a recombination event is
accompanied by gene duplication, the original (parental)
genes disappear in the event. An organism may survive a
recombination event only if neither parental gene was essential to its survival and reproduction or if the recombinant
gene(s) can carry out the function of both parental genes. This
rarity of successful gene shuffling stands in stark contrast to
the frequency of DNA recombination itself, which is a ubiquitous process accompanying DNA replication and repair. This
suggests that the vast majority of recombined genes have deleterious effects on the organism, which may be particularly
true for the highly conserved genes examined here.
We emphasize that the rarity of gene shuffling we find is not
in contradiction with earlier studies that have identified multiple gene fusions - a special, simple case of gene shuffling - in
fully sequenced genomes [20-24]. These studies identified
prokaryotic gene fusion events in one test genome relative to
multiple, often very distantly related, reference genomes. Any
such approach may find many fusion events even if such
events are rare. Our data also do not rule out the possibility
that shuffling played an important role in forming the conserved eukaryotic core genome, because the pertinent geneshuffling events would have occurred before the divergence of
the eukaryotic species pairs we examined. (The identification
of such ancient shuffling events may require an approach
based on protein structure.)
Furthermore, our results are not in contradiction with anecdotal evidence for the abundance of gene-shuffling events in
some functional categories of genes [32]. The reason is that
our results pertain to the average incidence of gene shuffling
among conserved genes. Some genes may be shuffled at a
much greater rate. Indeed, structural studies of multidomain
proteins tend to find a few domains which co-occur with a
wide variety of other domains (indicating the common shuffling of such promiscuous domains), whereas many other
domains co-occur with only one or a few other domains (rare
shuffling) [43]. Similarly, a lack of reliable genome
annotation made it impossible to reliably identify gene-shuffling events in vertebrate genomes, where gene shuffling may
be more frequent overall [44].
Perhaps the central caveat to our results regards sources of
ascertainment bias. The comparison of distantly related
genomes alone introduces a powerful source of ascertainment
bias: we can only analyze gene-shuffling events for genes that
have been sufficiently conserved to be recognizable in both

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/6/R50

genomes. However, shuffling might be more common among
rapidly evolving genes. An additional possible source of bias
is that after a successful gene-shuffling event the rate of
amino-acid substitutions may be elevated as a result of directional selection on the newly created gene. Such a bias would
cause us to underestimate shuffling frequencies in distantly
related species even for conserved genes. Nonetheless, our
results from the four closely related genomes argue against
such a bias, because shuffling also appears rare in these
genomes.
Another caveat is that our ability to identify successful geneshuffling events depends on the continued presence of both
parental genes in the reference genome. Genomes, however,
occasionally lose genes. For instance, recent work has suggested that S. cerevisiae has lost roughly 10% of its genes
since its last common ancestor with S. pombe [45]. If gene
loss in other organisms occurs at comparable rates, our
approach may slightly underestimate the number of recombination events in a lineage. However, note that gene loss
affects our estimates of gene shuffling and gene duplication in
similar ways, thus compensating for any such bias.
We used a second reference genome R2 to be able to exclude
gene-fission events in reference genome R1. Such events can
lead to misidentification of recombination in the test species
and have been documented in several organisms [20]. Unfortunately, this approach fails if the same recombination event
occurred twice, once in the lineage leading to reference species R2 and once in the lineage leading to test species T. Such
a case of parallel evolution or homoplasy would lead us to
misidentify a recombination event in T as a gene-fission event
in R1. However, because successful gene shuffling is very rare
in general, and because the required recombination event
would have to occur at exactly the same position twice, this
possibility is probably not a major confounding factor in our
analysis.
A fourth caveat lies in the possibility that some of our recombinant genes may result from two independent recombination events. Our algorithm can identify such genes, but given
the high sequence divergence of recombinant domains it may
often be impossible to resolve the order of the individual
recombination events. The generally small number of recombinant proteins implies that genes produced by two or more
recombination events would be extremely rare. Indeed,
among 203 identified recombinant genes, a mere 16 show
matches to more than two parental genes, making these the
only cases with indications that more than one recombination
process was involved in their creation.
Finally, our approach to estimating the rate of gene duplication identifies only duplications of single-copy genes in the
reference species. Multicopy genes may undergo duplication
more frequently. We may thus have underestimated the
number of gene duplications. As a result, the incidence of

information

Our analysis of gene shuffling has left many open questions,
most notably about the association between the rate of
sequence evolution and the rate of gene shuffling. To arrive at
firm answers for this and other questions, we must be able to

interactions

A second qualitative observation is that the incidence of gene
shuffling is not elevated in higher organisms relative to the
rate of nucleotide substitutions. (The higher incidence of gene
shuffling relative to gene duplication in prokaryotes from Figure 4a may be a consequence of the lower rate of gene duplication in these taxa.) This is consistent with the hypothesis
that the fate of most shuffled genes is driven by natural
selection rather than genetic drift. In other words, most shuffling events may not be neutral. This is again plausible if one
considers that most gene-shuffling events change a gene's
structure drastically. A corollary of this hypothesis is that preserved shuffled genes have been preserved for a reason - the
benefit they confer to an organism. While rare in number,
shuffled genes may thus be of great importance in organismal
evolution.

refereed research

A nonhomologous recombination event that gives rise to a
shuffled gene occurs in only one individual of a potentially
large population. Does a shuffled gene typically rise to high
frequency and become fixed through natural selection or
genetic drift? To answer this question, one could in principle
study the relationship between the rate at which fixed shuffled genes arise and population size (taking account of differences in nonhomologous recombination rates among
species). Three possibilities exist in principle. First, there may
be no relation between population size and the rate at which
fixed shuffled genes arise. This would be the case if most
gene-shuffling events are strictly neutral [46] or if they have
very large beneficial effects. Second, there may be a positive
relation between the rate at which fixed shuffled genes arise
and population size. This would be the case if most shuffling
events are mildly beneficial. The reason is that in this case
selection favoring the fixation of a shuffled gene has to overcome the effects of genetic drift, which are weakest in large
populations. Finally and perhaps most likely, there may be a
negative association between population size and the rate at
which fixed shuffled genes arise. This would be the case if
most shuffling events are mildly deleterious. Such a negative
association has been observed for several indicators of

deposited research

Natural selection or drift?

Despite such insufficient data, we can make the qualitative
observation that the observed incidence of shuffling does not
follow a simple pattern: For example, S. cerevisiae has a relatively high effective population size (Neµ is approximately
half of that for E. coli [47] while µ is actually higher than that
of E. coli [9]) and a high homologous recombination rate
compared to C. elegans or E. coli [48-51], and yet it shows the
lowest incident of gene shuffling of any of our taxa. In the
slightly deleterious scenario above, we would instead expect
yeast to show an incidence of shuffling greater than that of E.
coli, while in the slightly beneficial scenario we would expect
it to show an incidence greater than that of the multicellular
eukaryotes.

reports

Unfortunately, insufficient data are available to distinguish
rigorously between these possibilities. First, estimates of
effective population sizes Ne, based on estimates of Neµ [47]
and the mutation rate µ [9], exist only for three of our five
pairs of genomes (E. coli-Salmonella, S. cerevisiae-S. pombe
and D. melanogaster-C. elegans). Second, we have insufficient information on recombination rates (whose variation
among genomes needs to be taken into account). Specifically,
although estimates of homologous recombination rates are
available for a few of our organisms [48-51], gene shuffling
occurs strictly by nonhomologous recombination, whose rate
need not have a simple relationship with the homologous
recombination rate. A third difficulty is that recombination
rates and mutation rates are conventionally measured per
cycle of DNA replication, whereas we would require per-year
estimates as well as estimates of absolute divergence times
between our taxa of interest to make appropriate
comparisons.

Our findings speak to a long-standing debate in molecular
evolution, a debate that revolves around the origin of introns.
Introns are stretches of DNA that do not code for proteins and
that separate exons, the protein-coding regions of genes.
According to one point of view, introns originated early in the
evolution of life, perhaps as early as the common ancestor of
prokaryotes and eukaryotes [39-41]. According to this perspective, introns may have acted as spacers between exons
and thus greatly facilitated recombination among exons to
create new proteins. The opposite point of view is that introns
arose late in life's evolution, perhaps as late as eukaryotes
themselves [28,29] and thus had no role in gene shuffling earlier in life's history. Genes in two of our test genomes have a
sufficient number of introns to test the hypothesis that
introns facilitate gene shuffling. Neither of these genomes
showed an association between gene-shuffling boundaries
and exon position. In addition, neither of these genomes
showed an elevated incidence of gene shuffling. Although
based on a small number of genomes, this finding casts doubt
on the importance of introns for gene shuffling, and it suggests that other aspects of genome architecture may be more
important. One potential example is the organization of functionally related prokaryotic genes into operons. The close
proximity of such genes may facilitate their reorganization
and the generation of new functions, whether through simple
fusion or fission or through more radical change.

study shuffling rates not only for conserved proteins but also
for rapidly evolving proteins. Such studies will require closely
related genome sequences with reliable gene identification
derived independently for each genome.

Materials and methods
Identifying shuffled genes
Our method identifies shuffled genes in a test genome (T) relative to a reference genome (R1). Table 1 shows the ten test
genomes - two archaeal, six prokaryotic, and four eukaryotic
genomes - we used in this analysis. Every pair of genomes R1T occurs twice in Table 1, because one of two genomes can be
used either as the test or the reference genome. To exclude
spurious recombination events that reflect gene loss or fission
in R1, the method also employs a second reference genome,
R2. The two archaeans in our analysis were Pyrococcus
horikoshii [52] and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii [53].
The R2 species for these archaeans was Archaeoglobus fulgidus [54]. The bacterial genomes we analyzed were those of
Escherichia coli [55], Salmonella enterica [56], Bacillus
anthracis [57], and Bacillus cereus [58]. The reference species R2 were Bacillus subtilis [59] for the B. anthracis-B.
cereus comparison and Haemophilus influenzae [60] for the
E. coli-Salmonella comparison. Our four eukaryotic genomes
were budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [61], fission
yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [62], nematode worm
Caenorhabditis elegans [63] and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [64]. We used the genome of Neurospora crassa
[65] as the R2 genome for all these eukaryotes.
To identify sequence homology between all genes in these
genomes we used the Washington University implementation
of gapped BLASTP [66,67], followed by exact pairwise local
alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm [68] with a
gap-opening penalty of 10 and a gap-extension penalty of 2,
and the BLOSUM 62 scoring matrix [69]. We excluded from
further analysis all gene pairs with BLAST E-values greater
than 10-6, fewer than 50 aligned amino acids, amino-acid
identity in the alignment of less than 35%, or alignments consisting of more than 50% low-complexity sequences as determined by the SEG program [70,71].
The requirement of 35% sequence identity may appear to bias
our estimates of shuffling incidence between distantly related
taxa. However, because we calculate these values relative to
the total number of genes with the same (35%) degree of
sequence identity between the test and reference genome (h),
this bias is most likely to be small.
The result of this procedure is a list of partially or fully matching genes in the two species T and R1. We used this list to
identify shuffled genes in the test genome T. Specifically, for
each gene in the test genome T we searched for pairs of genes
in the reference genome R1 that matched the test species
gene, but in nonoverlapping or minimally overlapping

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/6/R50

regions. (To account for edge errors in local alignments, we
allowed regions to overlap by a maximum of 20 residues).
After having identified any such gene, we verified that it did
not also have full-length homologs in the reference genome,
because otherwise gene shuffling would not be the most parsimonious explanation of the gene's origin. We developed a
special-purpose algorithm for this search [72], which identifies, for any one gene, the combination of local alignments to
genes in the reference genome that covers the maximum
number of residues in the shuffled gene. This algorithm can
identify shuffled genes (genes to which two or more reference
species genes contributed), but it will also return only a single
alignment if this alignment is longer than any combination of
non-overlapping alignments.

Three criteria for validating shuffling events
We used three additional criteria to validate candidates for
shuffled genes. First, we computed the proportion of a shuffled gene's amino-acid residues that could be aligned to its
(parental) reference species genes. If this proportion is small,
a gene may be too highly diverged for us to confidently ascertain that it is a recombination product. We excluded genes
where this proportion was smaller than 50%. This requirement may appear restrictive, but additional analyses show
that our conclusions hold even if it is completely eliminated.
For example, eliminating this criterion increases the number
of shuffled genes by a factor ranging from 1 (no increase, E.
coli) to 4.2 (C. elegans), but the eukaryotes surveyed still
show an incidence of shuffling smaller than the duplication
rate, while the prokaryotes show similar frequencies of shuffling and duplication. We have maintained the 50%
requirement throughout our main analysis to err on the side
of caution: Putative shuffled genes with very short alignable
regions to a parental gene are more likely to be false positives.
They also do not belong in the set of genes conserved between
T and R1, which is our focus here.
To motivate our second validation criterion, we note that in
the eukaryotic test genomes some shuffled genes had undergone duplication. We identified gene duplicates as gene pairs
with amino-acid divergences Ka< 1 using a previously
described and publicly available tool [73]. We counted each
gene family of shuffled genes only once to avoid doublecounting duplicates of shuffled genes.
A third indicator of true recombination is the divergence of
different sequence domains within a putative shuffled gene.
The recombined parts of a shuffled gene should show equal
sequence divergence from their respective parental genes, if
these parts have diverged in a clock-like fashion. The two
principal indicators of DNA sequence divergence are the
number of silent nucleotide substitutions at synonymous
sites (Ks) and the number of non-synonymous substitutions
at amino-acid replacement sites (Ka) [32]. We used the methods of Muse and Gaut and Goldman and Yang [74,75] to estimate these divergence indicators for our putative shuffled

We then related this number of gene shuffling events per gene
to the number of gene duplications in T since its common
ancestor with R1. Because our test and reference genomes are
only distantly related, we could not rely on the silent nucleotide divergence among duplicate genes to estimate the rate of
duplication, as is commonly done [10,11]. We thus used the
following, alternative, method. First, for each test species T,

interactions

We estimated the incidence of gene shuffling relative to two
other frequent kinds of evolutionary events - gene duplications and nucleotide substitutions. To do so, we first needed
to account for differences in genome size among our study
species. We thus estimated the number of gene shuffling
events per gene. This estimate poses a problem that stems
from the different (and highly uncertain) times since common ancestry of our different T-R1 species pairs. The longer
the time since common ancestry, the fewer genes (shuffled or
not) with recognizable sequence similarity two species will
share. Thus, when simply dividing the number of shuffled
genes s by the total number of genes in a test genome, one
may wrongly estimate the number of gene-shuffling events
per gene. To account for this problem, we divided the total
number of gene-shuffling events s by the number of recognizable homologs h shared between species T and R1 to obtain
the number of gene shuffling events per gene, s/h. To obtain
h itself, we determined the total number of genes in T with at
least one homolog - using the criteria outlined earlier - in the
genome of R1, the total number of genes in R1 with at least
one homolog in T, and averaged these two numbers.

refereed research

genes. Silent substitutions are subject to much weaker selection pressures than amino-acid replacement substitutions,
and their rate of accumulation is thus more clock-like [32].
For our analysis of four closely related yeast species, we calculated the distance (Ka or Ks) between each sequence domain
of a shuffled gene and its counterpart parental gene. We
excluded candidate shuffled genes from further analysis if
these distances (Ka or Ks) differed by more than a factor two
between the different domains. For our highly divergent species (Table 1) we could not use synonymous divergence Ks
because most domain pairs had become saturated with silent
substitutions. The (unavoidable) disadvantage of using only
amino-acid divergence Ka is that natural selection on aminoacid changes can cause non-clock-like evolution of domains.
However, even with this caveat, our approach identifies true
recombination events. Otherwise, our shuffled genes would
not show the highly significant statistical association in
amino-acid divergence Ka we observe between sequence
domain pairs (Figure 5; Pearson's r 0.47, Spearman's s 0.45,
P < 0.0001 for both). Note that we did not exclude shuffled
genes from our analysis of distantly related genomes based on
unequal Ka estimates.

Internal domain duplications could cause a shuffled gene to
fail the first of the three test criteria above - 50% alignable residues with its parental genes - which would cause us to miss
such genes. To assess how serious a problem such missed
genes might be, we relaxed the first of the above test criteria,
requiring only 10% alignable residues between a test gene and
two or more potential parental genes. For test species genes
that met this criterion, we then excised the portion of the test
species gene that aligned to a reference gene, and recomputed
a local alignment between this trimmed gene and the reference gene. If the test-species gene contained internal duplications of the reference gene, the trimmed sequence should still
align to the reference gene. We added any new alignments
found in this way to the original alignment combination and
assessed whether the resulting combination of alignments
met the required threshold of 50% alignable residues. For
alignments that met our other prescreening criteria for
candidate shuffled genes (50 amino acids in length and > 35%
amino-acid identity) we iterated this excision procedure to
determine the total number of repeated domains. This analysis identified only five additional shuffled genes (see above)
and led us to conclude that internal duplications are not a
major confounding factor in our analysis.

we identified all genes which match only a single gene in R1 at
a BLAST threshold of 10-6 and had 70% or more of their
sequences aligned to that gene. The number of unique reference species genes matching one or more test species genes
gives a baseline number g of genes before duplication. Second, for each such unique reference species gene i we identified duplicate pairs of test species genes that showed a
pairwise amino-acid divergence Ka which was less than either
gene's amino-acid divergence from the putative ortholog i.
For many genes i, more than one pair of test species genes fulfilled these criteria. Such genes represent families of ni duplicates of gene i. We estimated the (minimal) number of
duplication events necessary to establish such a gene family
of size ni as di =  log 2 ( ni )  . The total estimated number d of


gene duplications for the g reference species genes then calculates as the sum d = ∑ di . Genes in very large families are
more likely to undergo duplication than genes in smaller families [76]. For this reason, we excluded reference species
genes i with more than ten duplicate genes from this analysis.
Including such genes would tend to increase our estimated
rate of gene duplication, meaning that the results shown in
Figure 4a are conservative estimates of the excess of duplicates relative to shuffled genes. To estimate the rate of gene
shuffling events relative to gene duplication events, we then
divided the number of gene shuffling events per gene (s/h,
obtained above) by the number d/g of gene duplication
events per gene.
We also estimated the number of gene-shuffling events per
unit of silent substitutions Ks that accumulate in a gene. Two
of our species pairs (B. anthracis-B. cereus and E. coli-S.
enterica) allowed us to estimate synonymous divergence Ks
directly. For these two species pairs, we first identified 100
pairs of single-copy genes in each genome that are unambiguous orthologs [32,77]. We then divided the number of shuffled genes per gene by the average synonymous divergence Ks
of the orthologs with unsaturated synonymous divergence (>
97 for both species pairs) to obtain an estimate of the number
of gene-shuffling events per unit change in Ks.
For the three other genome pairs, this approach was not feasible because of their mostly saturated synonymous divergence. We thus had to estimate the average synonymous
divergence Ks between T and R1 by extrapolating from the
synonymous divergence between T and a more closely related
species. This approach relies on previous work [10] which
indicates that the genome-wide average ratio Ka/Ks of aminoacid divergence to synonymous divergence approaches an
asymptotic value for large numbers of distantly related genes.
For each of the three T-R1 species pairs, our approach to estimating Ks in this way consists of two steps. We first estimated
the average amino-acid divergence Ka between 100 randomly
chosen unique single-copy orthologs of a T-R1 species pair.
For the second step, we first identified an organism C with
fully sequenced genome that is closely related to either T or

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/6/R50

R1. The genome of C should be sufficiently closely related to
estimate Ks reliably, but sufficiently distantly related to reliably estimate the asymptotic ratio of amino-acid to silent
divergence. This organism was Saccharomyces paradoxus
for S. cerevisiae; Pyrococcus furiosus [78] for P. horikoshii;
and Caenorhabditis briggsae [79] for C. elegans. For each of
these closely related genome pairs, we chose at random 100
single-copy gene pairs that were unambiguous orthologs. We
calculated the average ratio Kac/Ksc for these orthologs. We
then used this value to extrapolate the average fraction Ks of
synonymous substitutions between genes in T and R1 as Ks =
Ka/(Kac/Ksc). This is the estimated average synonymous substitution rate between a T-R1 species pair. We then related the
rate of gene shuffling to this extrapolation of Ks. Specifically,
we estimated the number of shuffling events per gene per one
Ks as (s/h)/(Ks/2). (The reason for dividing the average Ks by
2 is that our approach estimates the number of gene-shuffling
events only for one of the two species of a T-R1 species pair.)
We are well aware of the shortcomings of this approach,
which averages heterogeneous substitution rates and
assumes that the ratio of amino acid to silent divergence is
constant within the taxonomic group considered. However,
we emphasize that we use the approach here only to arrive at
order-of-magnitude estimates of the incidence of gene shuffling. We also note that although we have not explicitly taken
codon usage bias into account, the use of codon position-specific nucleotide frequencies (which partially account for such
a bias, at a cost of larger estimate variances) increased all of
our estimated average Ks values without changing the
patterns seen in Figure 4. Thus, the values in Figure 4 are conservative in the sense that the actual incidence of shuffling
relative to Ks may be lower than shown.
Third, and finally, we also estimated the number of geneshuffling events per unit of amino-acid replacement substitutions Ka that accumulate in a gene. To do so, we divided s/h as
above by one-half the average amino-acid divergence (Ka/2)
of 100 unambiguous orthologs in a T-R1 species pair.

Comparison of identified domains to Pfam database
Because our analysis was sequence and not structure-based,
we used the Pfam database of structural protein domains
[30,38] to evaluate how well the recombined sequence
domains we identified matched structural domains. To do so,
we queried all shuffled genes against the Pfam database and
retained identified Pfam domains with E ≤ 10-5. We then compared the location of these structural domains to the location
of the sequence domains in the shuffled genes. Specifically,
we calculated the distance between each alignment domain
and its closest Pfam domain. For the starting (As) and ending
positions (Ae) of the alignment, and for the starting (Ps) and
ending positions (Ps) of the Pfam domains found in the shuffled
gene,

a large extent. Parametric tests are not appropriate to evaluate the statistical significance of this association. We thus
applied a gene-randomization procedure that created new
alignment domains within each gene, domains whose starting
and ending positions are uniformly distributed but cover the
same proportion of the gene as did the original domains. Each
randomized gene possessed the same number of simulated
domains as observed domains, but with different positions
and lengths. We then calculated D for the simulated alignment domains and compared its distribution to the empirically observed values of D. We applied an analogous approach
to test whether exon/intron boundaries and shuffling boundaries are associated in our two multicellular eukaryotes (C.
elegans and Drosophila). This approach substituted the closest exon for the closest Pfam domain and applied the same
randomization procedure.
