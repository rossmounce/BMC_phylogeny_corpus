Abstract
Background: Succinate is produced petrochemically from maleic anhydride to satisfy a small specialty chemical
market. If succinate could be produced fermentatively at a price competitive with that of maleic anhydride,
though, it could replace maleic anhydride as the precursor of many bulk chemicals, transforming a multi-billion
dollar petrochemical market into one based on renewable resources. Actinobacillus succinogenes naturally converts
sugars and CO2 into high concentrations of succinic acid as part of a mixed-acid fermentation. Efforts are ongoing
to maximize carbon flux to succinate to achieve an industrial process.
Results: Described here is the 2.3 Mb A. succinogenes genome sequence with emphasis on A. succinogenes’s
potential for genetic engineering, its metabolic attributes and capabilities, and its lack of pathogenicity. The
genome sequence contains 1,690 DNA uptake signal sequence repeats and a nearly complete set of natural
competence proteins, suggesting that A. succinogenes is capable of natural transformation. A. succinogenes lacks a
complete tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as a glyoxylate pathway, and it appears to be able to transport and
degrade about twenty different carbohydrates. The genomes of A. succinogenes and its closest known relative,
Mannheimia succiniciproducens, were compared for the presence of known Pasteurellaceae virulence factors. Both
species appear to lack the virulence traits of toxin production, sialic acid and choline incorporation into
lipopolysaccharide, and utilization of hemoglobin and transferrin as iron sources. Perspectives are also given on the
conservation of A. succinogenes genomic features in other sequenced Pasteurellaceae.
Conclusions: Both A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens genome sequences lack many of the virulence genes
used by their pathogenic Pasteurellaceae relatives. The lack of pathogenicity of these two succinogens is an
exciting prospect, because comparisons with pathogenic Pasteurellaceae could lead to a better understanding of
Pasteurellaceae virulence. The fact that the A. succinogenes genome encodes uptake and degradation pathways for
a variety of carbohydrates reflects the variety of carbohydrate substrates available in the rumen, A. succinogenes’s
natural habitat. It also suggests that many different carbon sources can be used as feedstock for succinate
production by A. succinogenes.

Background
Actinobacillus succinogenes is a Gram-negative capnophilic bacterium that was isolated from bovine rumen as
part of a search for succinate-producing bacteria [1].

Succinate is an important metabolic intermediate in the
rumen, where several bacteria obtain energy by decarboxylating succinate to propionate, which in turn serves
as a nutrient for the ruminant [2,3]. Succinate is used as
a specialty chemical in food, agriculture, and pharmaceutical industries, but it has a much greater potential
value for augmenting or replacing a multi-billion dollar
petrochemical-based bulk chemical market [4,5]. Succinate production by fermentation of renewable feedstocks

is both economically and environmentally attractive. A
further environmental benefit is that fermentative succinate production uses CO 2 , a greenhouse gas, as a
substrate.
A. succinogenes is one of the best succinate producers
ever described, but it also produces formate and acetate
in high concentrations. Flux distribution between succinate and alternative fermentation products is affected by
environmental conditions. For example, higher succinate
yields can be obtained by increasing the available CO2
and a reductant (e.g., by supplying H2 or by using carbon sources that are more reduced than glucose) [6].
Optimizing the environmental conditions is not sufficient to achieve a homosuccinate fermentation, though.
Engineering A. succinogenes’s metabolism for homosuccinate production will be most effective if based on an
understanding of the enzymes and mechanisms controlling flux distribution. Deciphering the A. succinogenes
genome sequence is thus invaluable for defining, understanding, and engineering A. succinogenes metabolic
pathways.
There is also much knowledge to be gained by comparing the A. succinogenes genome to its closest relatives. A. succinogenes is a member of the Pasteurellaceae
family, which contains thirteen named genera as well as
candidates for new taxa [7]. The best known genera are
Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella. At least
thirty-two Pasteurellaceae genome sequences (complete
and draft) are publicly available, fifteen of which are
from different H. influenzae strains. While most Pasteurellaceae are studied for their pathogenic traits, A.
succinogenes and its closest relative, Mannheimia succiniciproducens [8], collectively referred to as “succinogens” in this paper, are studied for their industrially
attractive metabolic trait of succinate production. It will
be important to confirm lack of pathogenicity in these
succinogens before they are recommended for use on an
industrial scale. Because A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens have never been reported in association
with any disease, searching their genome sequences for
Pasteurellaceae pathogenicity genes is a logical starting
point to assess their potential for non-pathogenicity.
Here we present the first detailed analysis of the A.
succinogenes genome sequence with a biotechnological
perspective. The A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens genome sequences are also examined for known
Pasteurellaceae virulence genes.

Methods
Chemicals, source strain, growth conditions, and genomic
DNA purification

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). A. succinogenes type strain 130Z (ATCC
55618) was obtained from the American Type Culture

Page 2 of 16

Collection (Manassas, VA). To identify the A. succinogenes vitamin auxotrophies, A. succinogenes was grown
in the defined medium, AM3 [9], and then transferred
(1:100 dilutions) in parallel into ten tubes containing
fresh AM3 medium, each tube lacking a single vitamin.
A. succinogenes was considered prototrophic for a vitamin, if growth was maintained for three consecutive
transfers in its absence. To confirm the minimal vitamin
requirements, A. succinogenes was grown through seven
transfers in AM3 containing only the required vitamins.
To determine A. succinogenes’s ability to grow on various carbon sources, cells were grown anaerobically in
Medium B (g/L: NaH2PO4·H2O, 8.5; K2HPO4, 15.5; bactotryptone, 10.0; yeast extract, 5.0; and NaHCO 3, 2.1)
supplemented with a single carbon source (1 g/L). The
initial pH was adjusted to 7.0-7.2. A. succinogenes was
considered able to grow on a carbon source when cell
yields (absorbance at 660 nm) were higher in medium B
supplemented with that carbon source than in non-supplemented medium. Growth data were recorded after
each of two serial transfers of three biological replicates.
For genomic DNA extraction, A. succinogenes was
grown in 100 mL of tryptic soy glucose broth (Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, MD) with 25 mM NaHCO3 in a 160mL anaerobic serum vial at 37°C. The culture was harvested in log phase (~7.7 × 1010 cells) and washed twice
in 45 mL of phosphate buffer (g/L: K2HPO4, 15.5; NaH2PO 4 *H 2 O, 8.5; NaCl, 1). Genomic DNA was purified
using a Qiagen genomic tip protocol with a Qiagen
maxiprep column (Valencia, CA) as described in the
QIAGEN Genomic DNA Handbook.
Genome sequencing and assembly

Sequencing was performed by the Department of
Energy’s Joint Genome Institute (JGI). The genome of
A. succinogenes was sequenced using a combination of
three Sanger genomic libraries: 3 kb pUC18c, 8 kb
pMCL200, and 40 kb fosmid libraries. All general
aspects of library construction and sequencing performed at the JGI can be found at the JGI website
[10]. 41,370 Sanger reads were assembled using PGA
assembler (Paracel Genome Assembler 2.6.2, Paracel,
Pasadena, CA). Possible mis-assemblies were corrected
and gaps between contigs were closed by custom primer walks from sub-clones or PCR products. A total
of 2,986 additional reactions were necessary to close
gaps and to raise the quality of the finished sequence.
The completed genome of A. succinogenes 130Z contains 43,200 reads. The error rate of the finished genome sequence is less than 1 in 100,000. Together all
libraries provided 11× coverage of the genome. The
genome sequence of A. succinogenes strain 130Z
is available in GenBank under accession number
CP000746.

Automated annotation

Automated annotation was performed by the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory [11]. Open reading frames (ORFs)
were identified using three gene caller programs: Critica,
Generation, and Glimmer. Translated ORFs were subjected to an automated basic local alignment search
tool (BLAST) for proteins [12] against GenBank’s
non-redundant database. The translated ORFs were also
subjected to searches against KEGG, InterPro (incorporating Pfam, PROSITE, PRINTS, ProDom, SmartHMM,
and TIGRFam), and Clusters of Orthologous Groups of
proteins (COGs).
Manual annotation

The ORFs described in this paper have also been manually annotated. BLAST alignments were examined to
assess the correctness of the start codon. DNA
sequences upstream of each ORF were examined for a
ribosomal binding site (at least 3 nt of the AAGGAGG
sequence, 5-10 nt upstream of the start codon) using
the web Artemis tool [11]. To assign product names to
each ORF, results from BLAST, HMM (i.e., PFAM and
TIGRFAM), and domain and motif searches were considered. Most importantly, efforts were made to find a
citation of biological function for a homologous gene. If
a translated ORF was at least 75% identical to a protein
of known function over 75% of the length, or if it
belonged to a TIGRFAM equivalog, it was given the
associated product name. If a translated ORF was less
than 75% identical to a protein of known function, the
product name was modified as follows: 60-75% identity
over 65% of the length, putative product; 40-64% identity over 40% of the length, probable product; 25-39%
identity over 25% of the length, possible product. If a
translated ORF was at least 60% identical to a protein of
unknown function, it was named a conserved hypothetical protein. If there was no adequate alignment with any
protein (less than 25% identity or aligned region is less
than 25% of the product length), the translated ORF
was named a hypothetical protein.
Other genome analyses

To compare their gene contents, the A. succinogenes and
M. succiniciproducens genomes were re-annotated using
the fully automated, prokaryotic genome annotation service, RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) [13]. Pairwise BLAST comparisons of protein
sets encoded by A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens genomes and predictions of the number of subsystems were performed using the sequence-based
comparison tool available in RAST. Orthologous protein-coding genes in the two succinogens were manually
compiled by comparing gene order, gene orientation
(forward/reverse), features of intergenic regions, and

Page 3 of 16

protein similarity (minimum 25% identity at the protein
level).
NUCmer and PROmer [14] whole-genome alignments
were performed using an online Synteny plot tool [15].
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPR) and spacers were identified using the
CRISPRs web service [16-18]. Spacer sequences were
then aligned against the A. succinogenes genome
sequence using BLAST. 16 S rRNA phylogeny was
determined using the Michigan State University Ribosomal Database Project tools [19,20]. Hierarchical clustering of Pasteurellaceae genomes was done using tools at
the JGI’s Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) website
[21,22].
Uptake signal sequence (USS) 9-mer cores [23] were
counted, and their surrounding sequences were reported
using our perl script, 200804USS.pl. The output was
pasted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to calculate
the frequency of each nucleotide occurring at each position, upstream and downstream of the USS core. A
search of A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens
genomes for Pasteurellaceae virulence genes was performed by compiling a list of known Pasteurellaceae
virulence genes based on the literature, then using a
custom Python script to align their sequences against
the two genomes using BLAST and report the data for
the top hit.

Results and Discussion
General features

Even though it is one of the largest Pasteurellaceae genomes sequenced to date (Table 1), A. succinogenes’s genome is relatively small (2,319,663 bp, GenBank accession
number CP000746). A total of 2,199 genes have been
annotated in the genome, of which only 2,079 are protein-coding, a desirable feature for metabolic engineering. General features of A. succinogenes’s genome are
compared to those of fifteen other Pasteurellaceae genomes in Table 1.
The A. succinogenes genome is most closely related to
that of its succinogen relative, M. succiniciproducens [8]
(additional file 1: Figures S1 and S2). M. succiniciproducens was also isolated from a bovine rumen, albeit on a
different continent, and it shares many metabolic traits
with A. succinogenes (see below). Based on genome reannotations performed with RAST (2,223 proteinencoding genes, total), the two succinogens’ genomes
have 1,735 ORFs (78%) in common, 442 ORFs are
found only in M. succiniciproducens, and 488 ORFs are
found only in A. succinogenes. Of 2,081 automated
KEGG comparisons [24], 1,861 (89%) A. succinogenes
genes were most similar to other Pasteurellaceae genes,
with 1,252 (60%) being most similar to M. succiniciproducens genes. However, A. succinogenes and M.

Data based on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genome summary pages.

succiniciproducens are among at least twenty-four misclassified Pasteurellaceae species that will likely be
renamed, as they do not cluster with properly classified
species in phylogenetic trees based on Pasteurellaceae
16 S rRNA, infB, rpoB, or atpD gene sequences [25].
The two succinogens are often clustered together using
phylogenetic approaches, but not closely enough to suggest that they belong to the same genus [25]. Hierarchical clustering of gene function categories also places the
two succinogens in a clade separate from other Pasteurellaceae (additional file 1: Figure S2). To better gauge
how closely related the two organisms are, we performed whole genome NUCmer and PROmer alignments of the two succinogens with each other, as well
as with eight other Pasteurellaceae (additional file 1: Figure S3). NUCmer plots show little to no conservation of
genome structure at the nucleotide level between A. succinogenes and any other Pasteurellaceae. PROmer plots
reveal that A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens
are more related to each other than to other Pasteurellaceae. Overall, though, the PROmer plots show that drastic changes in genome structure have occurred as A.
succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens evolved divergently from their last common ancestor, and that the
two succinogens are more distantly related than their
functional traits would suggest.
Prophage

A 39,489-bp prophage genome is encoded in the
Asuc_1205-58 region. The presence of a prophage has
biotechnological relevance for two reasons. First, it
raises the possibility of using phage-based genetic engineering. Second, it suggests that A. succinogenes may be
susceptible to phage lysis in an industrial bioreactor; if
so, steps should be taken to eliminate this prophage
from the host genome. This prophage has an organization similar to that of the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans phage, AaF23 [26], and it contains a DNA
N-6-adenine-methyltransferase (Asuc_1221). The A.

succinogenes prophage differs from AaF23, though, in
that the integrase gene (Asuc_1258) is located at the
opposite end of the phage genome from its location in
AaF23. Despite sharing a similar organization, many of
the A. succinogenes phage proteins are not found in
AaF23, and they are conserved in only a few Pasteurellaceae genomes. For example, the Asuc_1233-44 proteins are not well conserved among Pasteurellaceae, but
they include such crucial proteins as both terminase
subunits (Asuc_1235-6), a portal protein (Asuc_1238), a
prohead protease (Asuc_1239), a major capsid protein
(Asuc_1240), a protein with possible DNA-packing function (Asuc_1241), and a putative head-tail adaptor
(Asuc_1242). Two sets of addiction module killer and
antidote proteins are also encoded (Asuc_1211-4).
Another interesting feature of the A. succinogenes phage
is that Asuc_1219, encoding a homolog to replication
protein O (which, along with the P protein [Asuc_1220],
initiates lytic replication), has an internal frame shift. It
is unclear at this point whether this prophage corresponds to a functional temperate phage. Growth experiments in the presence of mitomycin C showed that 0.1
μg/mL mitomycin C started inhibiting growth after 3 h,
1 μg/mL mitomycin C inhibited growth starting at 90
min, and no growth was observed at 10 μg/mL mitomycin C. These results are similar to those observed for
phage induction in E. coli K12 [27]. More work (beyond
the scope of this paper) would be needed, though, to
demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of mitomycin C is
associated with the release of phage particles in the culture broth.
A set of CRISPRs (located between Asuc_1293
and 1294) and a set of CRISPR-associated genes
(Asuc_1284-93) are located thirty-four ORFs downstream from the prophage. Together, these CRISPRs
and CRISPR-associated genes can provide resistance
against phage [28]. Homologs in the 30% to 75% identity
range to A. succinogenes CRISPR-associated genes are

McKinlay et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:680
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/680

found in M. succiniciproducens and Mannheimia haemolytica, but they are not found in other Pasteurellaceae.
Short fragments of five of the ten A. succinogenes CRISPR
spacers matched short sequences in A. succinogenes
prophage genes. One spacer sequence showed similarity
to a gene encoding a phage integrase family protein
(Asuc_0030). This gene is accompanied by only one
other phage gene encoding a probable capsid portal protein Q with two internal frame shifts (Asuc_0029, 58%
identical to an M. haemolytica phage FMHaA1 protein
and 73% identical to a phage protein found in several H.
influenzae genomes). These two genes may be the last
remnants of an ancient phage integration-excision event.
A. succinogenes, M. succiniciproducens, and nine other
Pasteurellaceae species contain a homolog of Escherichia
coli LamB (Asuc_0322, 54% identical), the maltoporin
functioning as receptor for phage lambda. In both succinogens, the lamB homolog is part of the maltose transport operon (additional file 2: Table S1). This gene is
likely functional in A. succinogenes, since A. succinogenes
grows well on maltose [1]. This result suggests that A.
succinogenes may be susceptible to infection by lambdarelated bacteriophages.
Natural competence

All Pasteurellaceae genomes contain USS repeats that
feature a conserved 9-nt sequence [29]. In most Pasteurellaceae the conserved 9-mer is AAGTGCGGT (i.e.,
USS1), whereas ACAAGCGGT (i.e., USS2) predominates in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, H. ducreyi, H.
parasuis and M. haemolytica [29]. Each USS is followed
by a conserved AT-rich region, and USS2 is additionally
followed by GCAAA(A/T) 20-nt downstream of the 9mer [29] (additional file 1: Figure S4). The only function
yet demonstrated for USS repeats is in natural competence [30]. Under certain conditions (e.g., starvation or
the presence of elevated cAMP levels) many Pasteurellaceae preferentially internalize USS-containing DNA, perhaps being recognized as self-DNA [29,31]. Uptake of
USS-containing DNA is facilitated by a number of competency proteins, resulting in transformation frequencies
that can be as high as 10 -3 to 10 -2 transformants per
CFU [31] and in homologous recombination with chromosomal DNA. This DNA uptake mechanism works
best with linear DNA, making it well suited for strain
engineering, since constructs can be easily generated by
PCR and double recombination events are needed to
integrate the linear DNA into the chromosome. Genetic
tools for A. succinogenes are currently limited to expression vectors [32,33]. The ability to replace chromosomal
DNA with engineered DNA is invaluable for making
gene knockouts (e.g., to block unwanted fermentation
pathways) and knock-ins (e.g., of a modified promoter
to affect enzyme expression).

Page 5 of 16

We examined the A. succinogenes genome sequence
and all other complete Pasteurellaceae genome
sequences for USS occurrences (as of September 2009).
All Pasteurellaceae favored either USS1 or USS2, but
not both. In all cases, USS sequences were roughly
equally distributed between each DNA strand. A. succinogenes has a USS density of 0.73 USS/kb and contains
1,690 USS1 repeats; only Aggregatibacter aphrophilus
and A. actinomycetemcomitans had more (Table 2). As
in other Pasteurellaceae (additional file 1: Figure S4), the
A. succinogenes 9-mer core is usually preceded by an A
and followed by an AT-rich region (Figure 1). One outstanding difference is that the A. succinogenes 9-mer
core is immediately followed by a C in 71% of the USS
repeats. The frequency of C in this position ranges from
27% in Histophilus somni to 51% in A. aphrophilus for
USS1, and from 36% in H. ducreyi to 57% in A. pleuropneumoniae for USS2 (Table 2).
A regulon of twenty-five competency genes is known
in H. influenzae [31]. The A. succinogenes genome contains homologs of all of these genes except for two,
HI0660 and HI1631, which encode hypothetical proteins
in H. influenzae. Seven of the A. succinogenes competency proteins are less than 40% identical to their H.
influenzae homologs (additional file 2: Table S2). In
addition to twenty-three competency genes, the A. succinogenes genome also encodes the master regulator of
the competence regulon (the cAMP receptor protein,
Asuc_0008) and the essential competence regulatory factor, Sxy (Asuc_0283). It also encodes proteins that are
not competence-induced, but that are known to participate in DNA uptake or recombination (i.e., RecA, TopA,
AtpA, and DsbA, additional file 2: Table S2) [30]. The
abundance of USS repeats in A. succinogenes and the
possible presence of the necessary machinery for natural
competence suggested that A. succinogenes could be
naturally competent. Recent experiments in our laboratory demonstrated that A. succinogenes could uptake
DNA by natural transformation. These transformations
led to the construction of two gene knockouts (Joshi et
al., manuscript in preparation).
Metabolic reconstruction
Central metabolism

A complete inventory of A. succinogenes’s metabolic
machinery is crucial for understanding and engineering
the pathways that are involved in succinate production. A.
succinogenes’s metabolism has been studied using fermentation balances, enzyme assays, and 13C-metabolic flux
analyses, primarily in glucose-grown cultures [6,9,34,35].
These studies indicated that glucose uptake
takes place both through a permease (followed by
glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase) and
through the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent

phosphotransferase system (PTS). Glucose-6-phosphate is
then catabolized to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) via glycolysis, with little involvement of the pentose phosphate
pathway. PEP is then converted into fermentation products via the C3 pathway (leading to formate, acetate, and
ethanol) and the C4 pathway (leading to succinate), with
malic enzyme and oxaloacetate (OAA) decarboxylase
forming reversible shunts between these pathways. These
studies also showed the absence of glyoxylate and EntnerDoudoroff pathway fluxes. The enzymes of central metabolism encoded in the genome are summarized in Figure
2 and additional file 2: Table S3. While the A. succinogenes
genome encodes the EI, Hpr, and EIIA components of the
PTS (Asuc_0994-96), it does not encode a homolog of E.
coli EIIBC (PtsG). PTS-dependent glucose uptake in A.
succinogenes might take place, instead, using the mannosespecific PTS proteins ManXYZ (Asuc_936-38). The PTSindependent glucose uptake mechanism is believed to be a
major factor explaining A. succinogenes’s ability to produce
large amounts of succinate, but the genes involved are not
characterized at this point. The genome encodes a sugar
transport protein (Asuc_0496) that shows 40% similarity

to the Zymomonas mobilis glucose facilitator protein, as
well as possible sugar kinases (Asuc_1504, 0131, and
0084). In agreement with previous studies [6,34], genes
encoding all of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes are present, whereas those encoding glyoxylate pathway enzymes are absent. While the gene
encoding the Entner-Doudoroff enzyme phosphogluconate
dehydratase is not present in the genome, three possible
genes encoding 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate
(KDPG) aldolases were identified (Asuc_0152, 0374, and
1471). These three genes are part of operons encoding
possible glucuronate or galacturonate degradation pathways. Because A. succinogenes did not grow on these two
substrates in the conditions tested (see Materials and
Methods), the functions of Asuc_0152, 0374, and 1471
remain unknown. These aldolases likely break down
KDPG originating from yet unknown growth substrates
rather than from the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. M. succiniciproducens was reported to have a complete EntnerDoudoroff pathway [8], which would be a significant difference between the two succinogens. However, the purported M. succiniciproducens phosphogluconate
dehydratase (MS2219) is more likely the dihydroxy-acid
dehydratase (IlvD) involved in branched-chain amino acid
synthesis. In fact, BLASTP searches using the E. coli IlvD
or phosphogluconate dehydratase (accession number
NP_416365.1) as the query sequence identify the same top
hit in most Pasteurellaceae proteomes. E. coli IlvD shares
at least 75% identity with the top hit in each Pasteurellaceae species, while phosphogluconate dehydratase shares
at most 30% identity with the same top hits. It is therefore

unlikely that any Pasteurellaceae sequenced to date–
including M. succiniciproducens–has a full Entner-Doudoroff pathway.
All the genes encoding C 4 pathway enzymes were
identified in the A. succinogenes genome. In contrast to
M. succiniciproducens, which contains both a PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) and a PEP carboxylase [8], PEPCK
is the only PEP-carboxylating enzyme in A. succinogenes
(Asuc_0221). The other C 4 pathway enzymes (i.e.,
malate dehydrogenase [Asuc_1612], fumarase
[Asuc_0956], and fumarate reductase [Asuc_1813-6])
make up an incomplete arm of a reductive tricarboxylic
acid cycle (TCA) that also includes succinyl-CoA
synthetase (Asuc_1564-5). Unlike M. succiniciproducens
[8], A. succinogenes lacks the TCA cycle enzymes citrate
synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, but it does have
an a-ketoglutarate (aKG) dehydrogenase (Asuc_1566-7
and 0944) and a citrate lyase (Asuc_0305, 1194-6 and
1198). Similar to the genome organization of E. coli
[36], the A. succinogenes aKG dehydrogenase E3 subunit
(i.e., lipoamide dehydrogenase) is also the pyruvate
dehydrogenase E3 subunit, and it is encoded in the pyruvate dehydrogenase operon (Asuc_0942-4).
Most of the C 3 pathway enzymes were identified,
including pyruvate dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase (Asuc_1261-6) (Figure 2). Fluxes through these
two dehydrogenases were shown to be important
sources of reducing power for succinate production and
for anabolism when coupled with transhydrogenase
activity [34,35]. A single predicted membrane-bound
transhydrogenase was also identified (Asuc_1021-22).
The only uncertainty in the C3 pathway is the mechanism by which ethanol is produced from acetyl-CoA, but
the genome contains a number of aldehyde and alcohol
dehydrogenases. Among them, Asuc_0403, 0591, 1136,
and 1955 belong to the iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase protein family. Asuc_0591 is a good candidate
for ethanol production. It is probably a multifunctional
aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase [37], and it is 47% identical (66% similar) to E. coli AdhE (GenBank accession
no. P0A9Q7), the enzyme responsible for ethanol production. Asuc_0067 encodes a class III alcohol dehydrogenase. A class III alcohol dehydrogenase functions
primarily as a formaldehyde dehydrogenase (E.C.
1.1.1.284), but it can also produce ethanol [38]. Even
though M. succiniciproducens is not known to produce
ethanol, it has homologs of all the A. succinogenes alcohol dehydrogenases mentioned above. Thus, these proteins are either not functional for ethanol production in
M. succiniciproducens, or they are not involved in ethanol production in A. succinogenes.
Metabolic flux distribution between the C 3 and C 4
pathways is known to be influenced by CO 2 and H 2
concentrations. Malic enzyme (Asuc_0669) and a

Page 8 of 16

sodium-pumping OAA decarboxylase (Asuc_0301-3),
which are responsible for large reversible fluxes between
the C 3 and the C 4 pathways [34], are encoded in the
genome. Carbonic anhydrase (Asuc_1199), which interconverts CO2 and HCO3-, was identified, and it could
be important for making CO 2 available for succinate
production in environments with different pH values. A
single membrane-bound hydrogenase (Asuc_1277-83)
was also identified.
In contrast to M. succiniciproducens, A. succinogenes
does not produce lactate [6]. The A. succinogenes genome encodes a single lactate dehydrogenase, Asuc_0005,
which is 60% identical to the E. coli enzyme (EC
1.1.1.28) that couples lactate oxidation to amino acid
and sugar transport [39]. Asuc_0005 is therefore
expected to oxidize, rather than generate, lactate. In
contrast, the M. succiniciproducens genome does not
encode an Asuc_0005 homolog. A. succinogenes was
grown anaerobically in AM3 with 100 mM NaHCO 3-,
50 mM glucose, and 25 mM D, L-lactate, but no lactate
consumption was observed (data not shown).
A. succinogenes is also capable of gluconeogenesis,
since it can grow by anaerobic respiration using H2 or
electrically reduced neutral red as an electron donor
and using fumarate or malate as the carbon source and
electron acceptor [6,40,41]. The genome sequence
encodes a putative type I (Asuc_1073) and a type II
(Asuc_0394) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, but it does not
encode a PEP synthase. As a result, A. succinogenes
must rely on gluconeogenic flux through PEPCK to
make PEP from malate and fumarate.
Auxotrophic features

Production of succinate in a chemically defined medium
can decrease downstream costs in product purification.
A. succinogenes is known to require glutamate, cysteine,
and methionine to grow in a defined medium [9]. Glu
auxotrophy is due to an inability to synthesize aKG
from glucose [9], which is now explained by the absence
of genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase in the genome sequence. aKG cannot be synthesized from succinate because of the unidirectional activity of aKG
dehydrogenase from aKG to succinyl-CoA (ΔG°’ =
-30,000) and because the A. succinogenes genome does
not encode the reductive-TCA cycle enzyme, aKG ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Surprisingly, A. succinogenes
encodes all the enzymes required to synthesize Cys
(additional file 2: Table S4). Since both Cys and Met are
sulfur-containing amino acids, we wondered if these
auxotrophies could be due to an inability to assimilate
sulfate, the only mineral sulfur source in AM3. Indeed,
the A. succinogenes genome does not encode adenylsulfate kinase (additional files 1 and 2: Figure S5 and Table
S4), which is required for assimilatory sulfate reduction.
A. succinogenes grew normally in AM3 once sodium

McKinlay et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:680
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/680

sulfide or sodium thiosulfate was added in place of Cys,
confirming that the Cys auxotrophy is due to an inability to reduce sulfate. Met, however, was still required for
growth in the presence of reduced sulfur compounds. A.
succinogenes is missing several genes necessary to
synthesize Met through the L-homocysteine pathway,
and it would require a source of methanethiol to produce Met from O-acetyl homoserine (additional files 1
and 2: Figure S5 and Table S4).
We determined that nicotinic acid, pantothenate,
pyridoxine, and thiamine are the only four vitamins
required by A. succinogenes. The A. succinogenes genome sequence is missing several genes involved in the
biosynthesis of these vitamins (additional files 1 and 2:
Figure S6 and Table S4). Even though it is missing
several genes involved in biotin synthesis (e.g., bioA,
bioF, and bioW), A. succinogenes grows repeatedly in
the absence of biotin (five consecutive transfers in
AM3). However, A. succinogenes grows more reliably
in AM3 supplemented with biotin when inoculated
from frozen stocks or from rich medium. Biotin can
therefore be considered non-essential, but stimulatory,
for the growth of A. succinogenes, a feature shared
with M. succiniciproducens [42]. One mechanism that
could explain the growth of A. succinogenes in the
absence of biotin despite the absence of a full set of
biotin biosynthetic genes is that A. succinogenes might
be able to use thiamine as a precursor for biotin
synthesis, as has been observed with the fungus,
Humicola, strain 16-1 [43]. The A. succinogenes gene
encoding a putative biotin synthase (Asuc_1132)
seems to be co-transcribed with the thiamine ABC
transporter genes (Asuc_1229-31).
Similar to A. succinogenes, M. succiniciproducens is
auxotrophic for Cys, Met, nicotinic acid, pantothenate,
pyridoxine, and thiamine, and the genetic bases underlying these auxotrophies are the same as those identified in A. succinogenes [42]. A. succinogenes and M.
succiniciproducens differ in one respect, though. M.
succiniciproducens is not auxotrophic for Glu since,
unlike A. succinogenes, it has genes encoding a citrate
synthase (MS2371) and an isocitrate dehydrogenase
(MS2370). Although the two succinogens have an
incomplete assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway,
they, along with various A. pleuropneumoniae strains
and Actinobacillus minor NM305, have the most complete assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway among all
other sequenced Pasteurellaceae. The inability of A.
succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens to carry out
assimilatory sulfate reduction is likely an adaptation to
their natural environment. The rumen flora produces
hydrogen sulfide [44,45]. Both succinogens encode a
serine acetyltransferase (Asuc_0384 and MS2212) and
a cysteine synthetase (Asuc_2108 and MS1770) that

Page 9 of 16

may allow them to synthesize L-Cys from H 2 S produced in the rumen.
The insights into A. succinogenes’s auxotrophies
obtained by genome analyses have allowed us to modify
our original defined medium. Whereas Glu and Met are
two of the least expensive amino acids (~$1/kg),
cysteine is more expensive (> $10/kg) [46]. Using inexpensive inorganic reduced sulfur compounds (such as
thiosulfate in place of cysteine) and eliminating several
nonessential vitamins are expected to significantly
reduce the cost of defined growth medium.
Dicarboxylic acid transporters

As a producer of the dicarboxylate succinate, it is interesting to note that A. succinogenes encodes twelve possible anaerobic dicarboxylate transporters (additional file
2: Table S5). Nine of them are similar to the tripartite
ATP-independent periplasmic transporters (T.C. 2.A.56)
encoded by dctPQM [47]. These transporters have been
characterized in Rhodobacter capsulatus and Wolinella
succinogenes for their roles during fumarate respiration,
where fumarate is transported by proton symport
[47,48]. The other three anaerobic dicarboxylate transporters are related to DcuA, B, and C (T.C. 2.A.13).
These transporters have been characterized during
fumarate respiration by E. coli and W. succinogenes
[48-50]. They operate by exchanging an intracellular
dicarboxylate (e.g., succinate) for an extracellular dicarboxylate (e.g., fumarate, malate, or aspartate). DcuA and
B may also transport Na+ in symport with the dicarboxylates to avoid dissipating the proton motive force [48].
DcuC may have preferential succinate efflux activity,
since a dcuC,- E. coli strain has increased dicarboxylate
exchange and fumarate uptake activities [51]. During E.
coli mixed acid fermentation, glucose did not repress
dcuC expression, suggesting that DcuC plays a role in
succinate excretion [51]. A microarray study examining
changes in H. influenzae gene expression during competency induction suggested that DcuA and B are important for Pasteurellaceae fermentation or fumarate
respiration [31]. In that study, 151 genes showed > 4fold increase in transcript levels as H. influenzae became
competent, including transcripts for the C 4 pathway
enzymes aspartate ammonia-lyase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, fumarate reductase, and a single dicarboxylate transporter. This H. influenzae transporter is 84%
and 44% identical to A. succinogenes’s putative DcuBtype transporters, Asuc_0142 and 1999, respectively. A.
succinogenes dcuA, B, and C are therefore candidate
genes to investigate the importance of dicarboxylate
transport during fumarate respiration and succinate
fermentation.
Sugar transporters

A. succinogenes grows on a wide variety of industrially
relevant sugars including glucose, fructose, xylose, L-

arabinose, mannose, and sucrose [1]. Figure 3 and additional file 2: Table S1 summarize the sugar uptake and
degradation pathways that were identified in the genome
sequence. Phosphotransferase systems (PTS) were identified for glucose, fructose, mannose, sorbitol, mannitol,
sucrose, and b-glucosides (e.g., amygdalin, aesulin, arbutin, cellobiose, gentiobiose, and salicin). Galactose, maltose, arabinose, ribose, and xylose are taken up by ATPdependent transporters. Xylose can also be transported
by a H+-symport mechanism involving a separate transporter (Asuc_0496). After transport, L-arabinose is converted to ribulose by arabinose isomerase (Asuc_0494)
and then phosphorylated by ribulokinase. Interestingly,
the enzyme believed to be ribulokinase (Asuc_0493),
based on its location in the arabinose operon
(Asuc_0489-94), is only 20% identical to the E. coli
enzyme. Facilitated transporters were also identified for
lactose, gluconate, idonate, 5-ketogluconate, glucarate,
galactarate, pectin or pectate, and glycerol. A.

succinogenes was recently shown to grow on glycerol as
its sole carbon source with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
or nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor (Schindler
and Vieille, manuscript in preparation). Accordingly, the
A. succinogenes genome encodes a glycerol uptake facilitator (Asuc_1603), a glycerol kinase (Asuc_1604), and
an anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(Asuc_0205-3). It also encodes a DMSO reductase
(Asuc_1524-1521), a periplasmic nitrate reductase
(NapFDAGHBC, Asuc_2040-35) and a periplasmic
nitrite reductase (NrfABCDEFG, Asuc_0704-11). In contrast, M. succiniciproducens contains only a truncated
homolog of Asuc_1521 and lacks the other ORFs for the
DMSO reductase complex.
Many sugar transport and degradation proteins have
associated regulatory proteins (e.g., for L-arabinose, maltose, ribose, xylose, lactose, sorbitol, mannitol, glucarate
and galactarate, and glycerol; additional file 2: Table S1).
The ORFs putatively encoding sugar transport and

McKinlay et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:680
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/680

degradation pathways encompass all the sugars A. succinogenes is known to use, except arabitol [1,6]. Homologs
of the E. coli arabitol transporter and arabitol dehydrogenase were not found in the A. succinogenes genome.
The genome also encodes transporters and degradation
pathways for carbon sources A. succinogenes was not
known to metabolize (e.g., ascorbate, pectin, glucarate,
and galactarate). In the conditions tested, though, we
were able to detect growth on galactarate and ascorbate
only. Growth on ascorbate was surprising because the
ascorbate PTS transporter encoded by Asuc_0235-40,
appears to be missing a component. It is not clear
whether this missing component is encoded elsewhere
or whether another PTS system shares some specificity
for ascorbate. The absence of growth on pectin was surprising, since A. succinogenes contains three separate
operons encoding a full pectin degradation pathway
(Asuc_0145-58, 0366-74, and 1467-75). Three of A.
succinogenes’s ten possible tripartite ATP-independent
periplasmic transporters (Asuc_0146-48, 0156-58, and
0366-68) are found in these operons. Several other operons appear to have a role in sugar transport and degradation, but the identity of the sugars is unknown. For
example, one of the four proteins that show similarity to
an idonate, a gluconate, or a 5-ketogluconate transporter
is in an operon that encodes enzymes to degrade an
unidentified sugar (Asuc_0119-30). Also, Asuc_0585-8
encodes a fructose-like PTS system and a protein that
might be a sugar kinase.
Explanation for lack of pathogenicity

The natural Pasteurellaceae ecology is in association
with a host [52]. The host is usually mammalian, with a
few exceptions [7], such as P. multocida colonizing
birds [52] and possibly even amoebas [53]. Most Pasteurellaceae can be isolated from healthy hosts and are
considered part of the normal flora. However, in circumstances such as host stress, many Pasteurellaceae
cause disease and are considered opportunistic pathogens. Most Pasteurellaceae are isolated from the respiratory tract and cause pulmonary diseases [52]. Others
have been isolated from the oral cavity (e.g., A. actinomycetemcomitans, which causes periodontitis), the
genital tract (e.g., H. ducreyi, which causes sexuallytransmitted chancroid), and bovine rumen (e.g., A. lignieresii, which causes wooden tongue) [7]. Virulence is
an undesirable trait for an industrial organism, and the
relatedness of A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens
to several pathogens cannot be ignored. With no reports
of disease caused by the succinogens, their genome
sequences are a convenient and logical starting point to
assess their potential for lack of pathogenicity.
Many Pasteurellaceae virulence factors have been
characterized. We manually compiled a list of 341

Page 11 of 16

Pasteurellaceae virulence proteins (with some functional
redundancy), including and expanding on those compiled
by Challacombe and Inzana [54]. We then aligned their
sequences against the A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens protein databases (additional file 3: Table S6). Our
comparison focuses on gene products having functions in
toxin production, synthesis of cell surface structures, and
iron uptake (additional file 3: Table S6). We excluded
from the comparison virulence factors in the categories of
amino acid transporters, purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes, and enzymes for anaerobic metabolism.
While these metabolic activities may affect host health
[55-57], they are also necessary for nonvirulent processes.
The major findings from our alignments are summarized
in this section with more details available in additional file
4: Supplementary text. Raw data from the alignments are
reported in additional file 3: Table S6.
Toxins

Repeat toxins (RTX), including leukotoxins, are produced by many Pasteurellaceae, including A. pleuropneumoniae [58], A. actinomycetemcomitans [59], M.
haemolytica [60], and P. multocida [61]. A. actinomycetemcomitans uses a cytolethal distending toxin that is
encoded near a characteristic virulence-associated region
[62]. Neither succinogen genome sequence encodes the
components necessary to produce leukotoxin or cytolethal distending toxin. Additionally, neither succinogen
encodes a homolog to the H. ducreyi hemolysin [63].
Cell surface structures

Cell surface virulence factors used by pathogenic Pasteurellaceae include pili, adhesins, lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), and capsules. Adherence to respiratory epithelial
cells is the first colonization stage by respiratory Pasteurellaceae pathogens. It involves a number of cell surface mechanisms [64]. Both succinogens have possible
homologs to OapA and B and all components of a type
IV pilus (pilABCD), which is involved in host surface
binding in H. influenzae [65,66]. Because type IV pili are
also part of the H. influenzae competence regulon [31],
and because A. succinogenes was recently shown to be
naturally competent (Joshi et al., manuscript in preparation), type IV pili might not be related to virulence in
the succinogens. M. succiniciproducens has probable
homologs of the A. actinomycetemcomitans pili needed
for tight adherence (flp and tad loci) [67], whereas A.
succinogenes does not. Both succinogens have several
large ORFs that could encode HMW adhesins, including
gene clusters that may be involved in hemagglutinin
production (Asuc_1006-12 and MS1162-9). However,
Asuc_1006 and 1008 have internal frame shifts. It is currently not known whether either succinogen makes an
adhesin. It is also possible that the succinogens use this
feature for survival in a competitive rumen environment,
rather than to cause disease.

McKinlay et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:680

Nontypeable H. influenzae strains are able to evade
host immune defenses by incorporating host sialic acid
and choline into their LPS, thereby mimicking host cell
surfaces [68,69]. The succinogens’ genome sequences
contain many genes involved in LPS synthesis and modification but key genes for choline and sialic acid incorporation are not present. None of these genes contain
variable number tandem repeats, suggesting that the
succinogens are not capable of LPS phase variation.
A. succinogenes has several LPS glycosyltransferases
not found in M. succiniciproducens (e.g., Asuc_0524,
1375), suggesting that its LPS could be more complex.
The two succinogens’ LPSs might also differ in sugar
composition. A. succinogenes is one of only four Pasteurellaceae that encodes the L-rhamnose synthesis pathway.
L-rhamnose is a common component of the LPS Oantigen [70,71], and the A. succinogenes L-rhamnose
biosynthetic pathway (Asuc_0826-32) is encoded just
downstream of the LPS biosynthesis genes (Asuc_082124). Because LPS O-antigens are mostly studied in
pathogenic bacteria, it is unclear how often non-pathogenic bacteria contain rhamnose in their LPS. For this
reason, the possible presence of rhamnose in A. succinogenes LPS is by no means indicative of a virulence trait.
In contrast, M. succiniciproducens encodes proteins
likely involved in L-rhamnose transport (RhaT, MS2326)
and catabolism (RhaBAD, MS2327-29), as well as the Lrhamnose-dependent regulators RhaS (MS2322) and
RhaR (MS2323). None of these genes are found in A.
succinogenes. Thus, the two succinogens have evolved
completely different L-rhamnose pathways–a biosynthetic one in A. succinogenes and a catabolic one in M.
succiniciproducens.
P. multocida, A. pleuropneumoniae, M. haemolytica,
and typeable H. influenzae produce a capsule that is
important for virulence [72-76]. Both succinogens have
possible homologs to, at most, two of the four capsule
biosynthesis and export proteins, suggesting that they
are not capsulated bacteria. However, non-typeable H.
influenzae are non-capsulated but they are still virulent.
Iron uptake mechanisms

Iron acquisition is a common trait in most bacteria,
making it difficult to associate iron uptake with virulence. Nonetheless, some insight can be gained from the
form of iron transported. Some pathogenic Pasteurellaceae can use the mammalian iron sources, transferrin
and hemoglobin [72,77], but the succinogens have possible homologs to only a few of the proteins required for
transferrin, heme/hemopexin, or hemoglobin uptake. A.
succinogenes does not have homologs to the hemin
receptor HemR or to the heme utilization protein Hup
[66], while M. succiniciproducens has possible homologs
of each. Still, BLAST searches show that both succinogens can assimilate other forms of iron, including iron

Page 12 of 16

bound by various siderophores and that they contain
the heme biosynthetic pathway from L-glutamate [78]
(additional file 3: Table S6). In both succinogens the
potential hemagglutinin production system mentioned
above is encoded alongside genes involved in ferrous
iron transport, including feoAB. FeoA and B are not
encoded in any sequenced Pasteurellaceae other than
the succinogens and A. minor NM305, but they have
been implicated in more distantly related bacteria in
virulence and colonization of mammalian intestines
[79,80]. This genetic region may be a worthwhile target
for deletion, provided it does not contain essential genes
for growth and succinate production.
Other virulence proteins

Both succinogens have a putative homolog to the inner
membrane protein, ImpA, involved in autoaggregation
[59]. Some Pasteurellaceae have a urease, which is a
known virulence factor of gastroduodenal and urinary
tract pathogens [81], but the succinogens have no urease
homologs, and A. succinogenes tested negative for urease
activity [1]. There is also no homolog in either succinogen genome sequence to the H. influenzae Iga protease,
which cleaves immunoglobulin A1, helping H. influenzae avoid host defenses at mucosal surfaces [82,83].
We want to stress that nonpathogenicity cannot be
concluded from the analysis of a genome sequence.
Most Pasteurellaceae species cause respiratory diseases.
The virulence factors associated with a hypothetical
rumen succinogen-caused disease would likely be different. For example, the FeoAB iron uptake system, which
is important for the virulence of some intestinal pathogens, is unique to the succinogens among the thirty-two
partially and fully sequenced Pasteurellaceae, with A.
minor NM305 (part of the pig respiratory tract normal
flora) an exception. This system, though, could also be
important for a commensal relationship with the mammalian host.

Conclusions
Sequencing of the A. succinogenes genome confirms
many of our earlier results based on growth experiments, enzyme assays, and metabolic flux studies
[6,9,34,35]. For example, A. succinogenes lacks a complete TCA cycle as well as a glyoxylate pathway, and
PEP carboxykinase is the only PEP-carboxylating
enzyme in this organism. The genes missing in the glutamate, cysteine, and methionine biosynthetic pathways
represent possible positive markers that can be used in
genetic engineering strategies. The fact that the A. succinogenes genome encodes uptake and degradation pathways for a variety of carbohydrates reflects the variety of
carbohydrate substrates available in the rumen, A. succinogenes’s natural habitat. It also suggests that many different carbon sources can be used as feedstock for

McKinlay et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:680
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/680

succinate production by A. succinogenes. The abundance
of USS repeats in A. succinogenes and the possible presence of the necessary machinery for natural competence suggested that A. succinogenes is naturally
competent, a feature that was recently demonstrated in
our laboratory. It is encouraging that the succinogens’
genome sequences lack a considerable number of the
virulence genes used by their relatives, and that there
are no reports of disease caused by A. succinogenes or
M. succiniciproducens. The lack of pathogenicity of
these two succinogens is an exciting prospect not just
for industrial purposes, but because comparisons with
pathogenic Pasteurellaceae could lead to a better understanding of Pasteurellaceae virulence.

were performed using the mummer software package [15]. These plots
give overviews of the rearrangements that have taken place at the
genome level between two bacterial species. Red lines from the bottom

species. Blue lines from upper left to lower right indicate sequence
conservation but with sequence inversion between the two species.
NUCmer and PROmer comparisons of A. succinogenes with H. influenzae
KW20, H. influenzae 028NP, H. somnus, H. ducreyi, and A.
pleuropneumoniae JL03 were also performed, but are not shown in this
Figure. The NUCmer plots show little to no conservation of genome
structure at the nucleotide level between A. succinogenes and any other
Pasteurellaceae. PROmer plots reveal that A. succinogenes and M.
succiniciproducens are more related to each other than to other
Pasteurellaceae. The PROmer plot of A. succinogenes vs. M.
succiniciproducens shows that drastic changes in genome structure have
occurred as A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens evolved divergently
from their last common ancestor, indicating that the two succinogens
are more distantly related than their functional traits would suggest.

lists all the A. succinogenes transporters, enzymes, and regulatory proteins
potentially involved in sugar transport and assimilation, based on our
manual annotation of the genome. Annotation criteria are described in
the materials and methods section. The ORFs putatively encoding sugar
transport and degradation pathways encompass all the sugars A.
succinogenes is known to use, except arabitol. The A. succinogenes
genome also encodes transporters and degradation pathways for carbon
sources A. succinogenes does not metabolize (e.g., pectin). Table S2: A.

the H. influenzae competency genes and their A. succinogenes homologs,
with the likeliness that the A. succinogenes homologs have the same
function. A. succinogenes homologs are considered putative if they share
60-75% amino acid identity with the query sequence, probable if they
share 40-59% amino acid identity with the query sequence, and possible
if they share 25-39% amino acid identity with the query sequence. NA
indicates that no suitable homolog was identified in A. succinogenes
either due to insufficient alignment length (less than 25% of the query
sequence length) or to no hits retrieved from the BLAST search. Table

of A. succinogenes genes encoding enzymes of central metabolism with

pathways present in A. succinogenes for amino acids and vitamins

cysteine, methionine, biotin, nicotinic acid, pantothenate, and pyridoxine
biosynthetic pathways that are present in A. succinogenes. Enzyme names
are based on our manual annotation of the genome, using the criteria
described in the materials and methods section. This list confirms that A.
succinogenes contains an incomplete assimilatory sulfate reduction
pathway, but that it is able to synthesize cysteine from sulfide or
thiosulfate. It also suggests that A. succinogenes is unable to synthesize

Met from L-homocysteine. Table S5: A. succinogenes dicarboxylate
transporters. A. succinogenes excretes large amounts of succinate as well
as smaller quantities of fumarate, but the succinate and fumarate
transporters are unknown. Table S5 lists the twelve possible anaerobic
dicarboxylate transporters identified in A. succinogenes. Transporter
names are based on our manual annotation of the genome, using the
criteria described in the materials and methods section. Percent identity
to experimentally characterized transporters is indicated in parentheses.
Nine A. succinogenes transporters are similar to the tripartite ATPindependent periplasmic transporter (T.C. 2.A.56) encoded by dctPQM
[47]. The other three are related to DcuA, B, and C (T.C. 2.A.13). DcuA, B,
and C operate by exchanging an intracellular dicarboxylate (e.g.,
succinate) for an extracellular dicarboxylate (e.g., fumarate, malate, or
aspartate). DcuA and B may also transport Na+ in symport with the
dicarboxylates to avoid dissipating the proton motive force [48]. Based
on studies performed in E. coli and H. influenzae (see manuscript for
references), Asuc_0142, 1999, and 1063 are likely candidates genes for
dicarboxylate transport during fumarate respiration and succinate
fermentation.

known Pasteurellaceae virulence factors and their top BLAST hits in the
A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens genomes associated with the
best BLAST hits in A. succinogenes and M. succiniciproducens. Virulence
factors are listed by category: cell surface structures, iron acquisition,
toxins, and other. Each virulence factor (i.e., query sequence) is identified
by its protein name, accession number, PubMed identifier (PMID), source
organism, function, and length. Each A. succinogenes or M.
succiniciproducens hit is identified by its accession number, locus number
(only for A. succinogenes), length, E value, alignment length, percent
identity, percent similarity, alignment length in percent of the length of
the hit, validity of the hit (i.e., hit and reason columns), and product
name in GenBank.
