Abstract
Background: The natural habitat of wild P. ginseng is currently found only in the Russian Primorye and the populations
are extremely exhausted and require restoration. Analysis of the genetic diversity and population structure of an
endangered species is a prerequisite for conservation. The present study aims to investigate the patterns and levels of
genetic polymorphism and population structures of wild P. ginseng with the AFLP method to (1) estimate the level of
genetic diversity in the P. ginseng populations in the Russian Primorsky Krai, (2) calculate the distribution of variability
within a population and among populations and (3) examine the genetic relationship between the populations.
Methods: Genetic variability and population structure of ten P. ginseng populations were investigated with Amplified
Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The genetic relationships among P. ginseng plants and populations
were delineated.
Results: The mean genetic variability within populations was high. The mean level of polymorphisms was 55.68% at
the population level and 99.65% at the species level. The Shannon's index ranged between 0.1602 and 0.3222 with an
average of 0.2626 at the population level and 0.3967 at the species level. The analysis of molecular variances (AMOVA)
showed a significant population structure in P. ginseng. The partition of genetic diversity with AMOVA suggested that
the majority of the genetic variation (64.5%) was within populations of P. ginseng. The inter-population variability was
approximately 36% of the total variability. The genetic relationships among P. ginseng plants and populations were
reconstructed by Minimum Spanning tree (MS-tree) on the basis of Euclidean distances with ARLEQUIN and NTSYS,
respectively. The MS-trees suggest that the southern Uss, Part and Nad populations may have promoted P. ginseng
distribution throughout the Russian Primorye.
Conclusion: The P. ginseng populations in the Russian Primorye are significant in genetic diversity. The high variability
demonstrates that the current genetic resources of P. ginseng populations have not been exposed to depletion.
Background
Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Renshen, Asian ginseng) is a
representative species of the Panax L. genus which is a
relic of the Araliacea family [1]. Their natural stocks are
over-exploited because they have the highest biological
activities [2]. At the beginning of the twentieth century,
wild P. ginseng spread over a vast territory including the
Russian Primorsky Krai, Korea and China. Currently, wild
P. ginseng can only be found in Russia; however, its populations are extremely exhausted and restoration is needed
[1]. P. ginseng is listed in the Red Book of Primorsky Krai
as an endangered species [3].

Analysis of the genetic diversity and population structure of an endangered species is a prerequisite for conservation [4]. Genetic variability is critical for a species to
adapt to environmental changes and survive in the long
term. A species with little genetic variability may suffer
from reduced fitness in its current environment and may
not have the evolutionary potential necessary for a
changing environment [5]. Knowledge of genetic diversity within a population and among populations is important for conservation management, especially in
identifying genetically unique structural units within a
species and determining the populations that need protection.
A high level of polymorphism of a marker is a basic
condition that must be assessed population genetics studies [6]. A study using allozyme analysis found a low level

of polymorphism (7%) in wild ginseng [7]. Multi-locus
DNA markers, e.g., Random Amplified Polymorphic
DNA (RAPD), Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) and
Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)
would potentially produce higher values of polymorphism than allozyme analysis because non-coding DNA
sequences, which mutate at a higher speed than coding
sequences, would also be characterized [8]. RAPD polymorphisms in wild ginseng populations are low [7,9].
Results with RAPD markers corresponded with the lack
of genetic variation demonstrated by isozyme gene loci in
red pine [10]. In contrast, polymorphism in RAPD loci
(about 46%) is high in cultivated P. ginseng [11].
Allozymes and RAPD markers are highly variable in populations of Panax quinquefolius (Xiyangshen, American
ginseng) [12-16]. There are 62.5% polymorphic loci in
populations of P. quinquefolius in the United States [16].
P. quinquefolius population from Ontario, Canada, has a
polymorphism level of about 46% estimated with RAPD
analysis [14].
As a reproducible and robust technique, AFLP [17]
generates a large number of bands per assay and is best
suited for analyzing genetic diversity. The fluorescencebased automated AFLP method demonstrated the highest resolving power as a multi-loci technique [18-20]. An
automated DNA fingerprinting system utilizing fluorescently labeled primers and the laser detection technology
associated with the automatic sequencer allowed the resolution of fragments that were undistinguishable by other
methods. In a previous study, four fluorescently labeled
AFLP primer pairs and 20 RAPD primers generated 645
and 170 polymorphic markers respectively [18]. In a
study to characterize Miscanthus, three fluorescently
labeled AFLP primer pairs generated 998 polymorphic
markers, as opposed to only 26 polymorphic markers
produced by two ISSR [20].
The present study aims to investigate the patterns and
levels of genetic polymorphism and population structures
of wild P. ginseng with the AFLP method to (1) estimate
the level of genetic diversity in the P. ginseng populations
in the Russian Primorsky Krai, (2) calculate the distribution of variability within a population and among populations and (3) examine the genetic relationship between
the populations.

Methods
Sampled populations

One hundred and sixty-seven (167) P. ginseng individuals
were collected from the ten administrative areas of Primorsky Krai (Figure 1) and transferred to a collection
nursery. The study populations were coded with the
names of the areas. Twenty (20) P. ginseng individuals
were collected from the Chuguevsk area (Chu), 19 from
the Spassk area (Spa), 16 from the Ussuriisk area (Uss), 13

from the Dalnerechensk area (Drech), 16 from the Dalnegorsk area (Dgor), 15 from the Olginsk area (Olg), 15 from
the Pozharsk area (Pozh), 24 from the Nadezhdinsk area
(Nad), 19 from the Partizansk area (Part) and 10 from the
Yakovlevsk area (Yak).
DNA extraction

Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaf tissue
according to Echt et al. [21]. The extracted DNA was
purified according to the Murray and Thompson method
[22].
AFLP procedure

AFLP genotyping was performed according to Vos et al.
[17] using EcoRI and MseI restriction enzymes. Preamplification reactions utilized AFLP primers with two
selective nucleotides. EcoRI and MseI selective amplification primers contained three and four selective nucleotides, respectively (Table 1). AFLP adapters and primers
were purchased from Syntol (Russia). All the EcoRI-NNN
selective primers were labeled with fluorescent 6-carboxy
fluorescein (6-FAM) at the 5' end. The AFLP fragments
were analyzed on an ABI Prism 3100 automated capillarity system with GeneScan Analysis Software (Applied
Biosystems, USA). All unambiguous peaks including
monomorphic peaks between 50-500 base pairs (bp) were
analyzed and the scoring results were exported as a presence/absence matrix.
Data analysis

Parameters of genetic variability and genetic mutual relations of populations were calculated with the POPGEN32
(POPGENE v. 1.31, Centre for International Forestry
Research, University of Alberta and Tim Boyle, Canada)
[23] and ARLEQUIN (Arlequin v.3.11, Excoffier L. Zoological Institute, University of Berne, Switzerland). As
AFLPs were dominant markers, Shannon's information
measure (IS) [24] was used to quantify the degree of the
within-population diversity. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [25] was conducted to calculate the variance components and significance levels of variation
within a population and among populations. AMOVA
derived genetic differentiation values (FST) between pairs
of populations (analogous to traditional F statistics) were
calculated. Gene flow between pairs of populations (Nm =
(1-FST)/4FST) was calculated from FST values [26]. We
reconstructed the Minimum Spanning tree (MS-tree)
between representatives of P. ginseng and populations
from a matrix of squared Euclidean distances using
ARLEQUIN (Arlequin v.3.11, Excoffier L. Zoological
Institute, University of Berne, Switzerland) and NTSYS
(NTSYS-pc v.1.70, Applied Biostatistics, Inc, USA)
respectively.

Results
Nine (9) AFLP primer pairs were tested, namely
Eco(ACG)/Mse(CCTC),
Eco(ACG)/Mse(CCTT),
Eco(ACA)/Mse(CCTG),
Eco(ACA)/Mse(CCGG),
Eco(ACA)/Mse(CCAC),
Eco(ACT)/Mse(CCGA),
Eco(ACT)/Mse(CCTA), Eco(ACC)/Mse(CCAG), and
Eco(ACC)/Mse(CCGC). Using two of the primer pairs
Eco (ACA)/Mse(CCTG) and Eco(ACA)/Mse(CCGG)
(Table 1), we detected polymorphic bands among the various samples of P. ginseng in this study. Among the scored
282 fragments, 281 were polymorphic across all ten populations (Table 2). Genetic variability was high within
populations (Table 2). The highest genetic diversity values (approximately 70%) were obtained in the Chu, Nad,
Olg and Pozh populations, whereas the lowest values
(approximately 40%) were found in the Uss and Dgor populations. The mean level of polymorphisms was 55.68% at
the population level and 99.65% at the species level. The
Shannon's index ranged between 0.1602 and 0.3222 with
an average of 0.2626 at the population level and 0.3967 at
the species level. The intra-population genetic polymor-

phisms ranged from 38.65% (Uss) to 69.15% (Chu) with
an average of 55.68% (Table 2).
All pair wise FST between populations, obtained with
AMOVA, were significant (P = 0.0000) and varied from
0.09180 (Pozh-Nad) to 0.60506 (Drech-Uss) (Table 3).
The non-hierarchical AMOVA analyses revealed that
35.54% of the total variation was attributed to the variability among the populations, whereas 64.46% was accumulated within the populations (Table 4). The average
number of migrants (Nm) between populations based on
AMOVA (FST = 0.355) was 0.45.
The MS-tree showed the genetic relationships among P.
ginseng plants (Figure 2). Calculated in AMOVA on the
basis of Euclidean distances, the length of the lines connecting the representatives inside the populations and
between the populations reflects the intra- and interpopulation genetic distances respectively (Table 5).
According to values of genetic distances, all of the studied ginseng plants on the MS-tree formed two groups
(Figure 2, Table 5), the first group consisting of the Drech
and Chu populations and the second group the Part, Yak,

Olg, Nad, Pozh, Uss, Dgor and Spa populations. These
two groups were divided by a genetic distance of 50 units
of Euclidean distance (Figure 2, Table 5). The Spa, Uss,
Dgor and Part, Yak, Nad, Pozh populations formed two
subgroups divided by a genetic distance of 33 Euclidean
distance units. The plants of the Olg population were distanced from the Part, Yak, Nad, Pozh subgroup by 35
Euclidean distance units (Figure 2, Table 5).
The location of a P. ginseng on the MS-tree was dependent on the population it belonged to; however, such
clustering was not strict and some populations partially
overlapped (Figure 2). For example, some plants of the
Pozh population were grouped with those of the Olg population while some plants of the Spa population were
with the Dgor and Drech populations. The plants of the
Nad population were partially mixed with those of the
Part and Pozh populations. Moreover, the plants of the
Chu population were mixed with those of the Uss, Drech
and Dgor populations.
The arrangement of the populations on the MS-tree did
not always correspond to their geographical areas. For
example, the Pozh population was geographically distant
from the Nad and Part populations but was genetically
close to them (Figure 2 and 3, Table 5). By contrast, popu-

lations that are geographically close, such as Uss and Nad,
were genetically distant and therefore belonged to different subgroups (Figure 2) or groups (Figure 3).
The Uss population was characterized by the smallest
average value of Euclidean genetic distances between
plants (17.33 units), whereas the Olg population was
characterized by the highest value (36.5 units). The average value of Euclidean genetic distances between the
plants of different populations (28.78 units) was higher
than that of intra-population genetic distances (26.35
units) (Table 5).

Discussion
P. ginseng populations located in Primorsky Krai have a
low level of genetic polymorphisms (approximately 7%)
by allozyme and RAPD [7,9,27-29] which means effective
conservation strategies would be difficult to implement.
High genetic variability in P. ginseng was revealed by the
AFLP method. While genetic diversity is theoretically
higher in large populations, the Uss population was small
in size but appeared to have suffered from the loss of a
genetic diversity more than other populations. Several
populations (Spa, Pozh, Nad, Chu and Olg) were distinguished by having higher levels of variability. For these

populations, the average value of polymorphisms was
65.39%. At the species level, the percentage of polymorphisms was 99.65%. The high level of variability may be
due to cross-pollination; however, P. ginseng's capability
for cross-pollination is yet to be established [30]. A large
number of the insects visiting P. ginseng inflorescences

are potential pollinators [1]. In Panax notoginseng, four
pairs of fluorescently labeled AFLP primers produced 312
fragments, of which 240 (76.9%) were polymorphic [31].
In Panax stipuleanatus, the same primers revealed 346
loci, of which 334 (96.5%) were polymorphic [31].

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of the AFLP
data showed a significant population pattern of the wild
Russian P. ginseng. FST, estimates of inter-population variability, varied from 0.09180 to 0.60506 (Table 3), indicating that all populations may be different from each other.
The partition of genetic diversity with AMOVA suggested that the majority of the genetic variation (64.5%)
was within populations of P. ginseng. The inter-population variability was approximately 36% of the total variability (Table 4). The value of gene flow (Nm) was 0.45;
therefore, wild P. ginseng has a relatively high genetic differentiation value among populations and a relatively low
level of gene flow. In cultivated P. ginseng, inter-population RAPD variability ranged from 1.77% to 42.01% [11]
and was 31% in another study [32]. The fluorescencebased automated AFLP method demonstrated that over

40% of the genetic variation of wild P. stipuleanatus was
among the populations [31]. P. ginseng' FST values are consistent with estimates of inter-population variability,
which were obtained with AMOVA and AFLP markers
for plant species with mixed type of propagation (FST =
0.35) [33]. According to Nybom [33], P. ginseng is a species with mixed type of propagation. The ability of P. ginseng to produce seeds via autogamy, out-crossing or
agamospermy without pollination was demonstrated earlier [30]. The high level of genetic variation and high proportion of variation within populations in P. ginseng
suggest that human activities (e.g. overexploitation, habitat destruction, urbanization, pollution) are the major
contributor that threatens the survival of the wild P. ginseng populations.
Six populations (Uss, Part, Olg, Yak, Dgor and Drech)
clustered together and four populations (Spa, Chu, Pozh
and Nad) were partially mixed with other populations
(Figure 2). We believe that the spread of wild P. ginseng
seeds by humans, animals and birds is the main factor
contributing to the population re-mixing.
The MS-tree arrangement of populations did not
always correspond to their geographical areas, which may
be due to converging common selection forces in geographically disparate populations [34]. Future research
with greater numbers of AFLP loci coupled with other
high variable markers (SSR) is warranted to confirm the
factors that shaped the genetic structures of P. ginseng in
Russia.
The finding that the average value of inter-population
genetic distances is higher that of intra-population
genetic distances (Table 5) is consistent with the AMOVA
conclusion that reveals the population genetic structures
of wild P. ginseng.

Zhuravlev et al. Chinese Medicine 2010, 5:21
http://www.cmjournal.org/content/5/1/21

The Uss population was characterized by the least average value of genetic distances between plants (Table 5),
which was consistent with the low parameters of variability calculated in POPGENE for this population (Table 2),.
On the other hand, the Olg population demonstrated the
highest genetic distances (Table 5). The Olg population is,
therefore, the most genetically diverse population according to the MS-tree, suggesting that it should be conserved
first.
The central node position on the MS-tree is occupied
by a plant (No. 6) that belongs to the Uss population and
the genetic communications spread to the Spa and Dgor
populations, and to a cluster of the rest of the P. ginseng
populations (Part, Nad, Yak, Olg, Chu, Drech and Pozh),
suggesting the ancestral status of the Uss population. The
Part population, also at the central position on the MStree, may have the same ancestral status as the Uss population (Figure 2); Nad and Spa populations may be ancestors as well (Figure 3). The absence of a strong Spa
population cluster on the MS-tree (Figure 2) may be evidence for its ancestral origin.
The MS-trees suggest that the southern Uss, Part and
Nad populations may have promoted P. ginseng distribution throughout the Russian Primorye. This result supports the assumption that Sikhote-Alin was re-colonized
by P. ginseng when thermophilic plants spread from the
south to the north during the early Holocene warm
period [27].
Future studies may focus on (1) using AMOVA to
investigate whether genetically differentiated regions
exists for P. ginseng and whether P. ginseng is adapted for
heterogeneous conditions; (2) whether a positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances among
P. ginseng populations may be established; and (3) using
the multi-locus mating system program (MLTR) to estimate the level of inbreeding and cross-pollination in wild
P. ginseng populations.

Conclusion
The P. ginseng populations in the Russian Primorye contain a significant level of genetic diversity and are essentially differentiated. The gene flow of the populations was
less than one (Nm = 0.45) which indicates continued
divergence among populations [26]. The current high
level of variability demonstrates that the genetic
resources of P. ginseng populations have not been exposed
to depletion.
