Abstract
Background: A number of studies have shown that peptidases and in particular cysteine
peptidases constitute major pathogenicity factors in Entamoeba histolytica. Recent studies have
suggested that a considerable number of genes coding for proteolytic enzymes are present within
the E. histolytica genome and questions remain about the mode of expression of the various
molecules.
Results: By homology search within the recently published amoeba genome, we identified a total
of 86 E. histolytica genes coding for putative peptidases, including 46 recently described peptidase
genes. In total these comprise (i) 50 cysteine peptidases of different families but most of which
belong to the C1 papain superfamily, (ii) 22 different metallo peptidases from at least 11 different
families, (iii) 10 serine peptidases belonging to 3 different families, and (iv) 4 aspartic peptidases of
only one family. Using an oligonucleotide microarray, peptidase gene expression patterns of 7
different E. histolytica isolates as well as of heat stressed cells were analysed. A total of 21 out of 79
amoeba peptidase genes analysed were found to be significantly expressed under standard axenic
culture conditions whereas the remaining are not expressed or at very low levels only. In heatstressed cells the expression of 2 and 3 peptidase genes, respectively, were either decreased or
increased. Only minor differences were observed between the various isolates investigated, despite
the fact that these isolates were originated from asymptomatic individuals or from patients with
various forms of amoebic diseases.
Conclusion: Entamoeba histolytica possesses a large number of genes coding for proteolytic
enzymes. Under standard culture conditions or upon heat-stress only a relatively small number of
these genes is significantly expressed and only very few variations become apparent between
various clinical E. histolytica isolates, calling into question the importance of these enzymes in E.
histolytica pathogenicity. Further studies are required to define the precise role of most of the
proteolytic enzyme for amoeba cell biology but in particular for E. histolytica virulence.

Background
The faecal-oral spread protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica is an important human pathogen. Normally, this
parasite resides and multiplies in the large bowel and can
persist there for months and years causing only an asymptomatic luminal gut infection. However, occasionally E.
histolytica penetrates the intestinal mucosa, which leads to
ulcerative colitis or it disseminates to other organs, most
commonly to the liver, where it induces abscess formation. Cysteine peptidases are considered to play a major
role for the pathogenicity of E. histolytica as suggested by a
large number of in vitro and in vivo studies [1-9]. Most convincing are results from infections of laboratory animals
indicating that E. histolytica trophozoites that have
reduced cysteine peptidase activity are greatly impaired in
their ability to induce amoebic liver abscesses [8,9]. In
addition, overexpression of cysteine peptidases led to an
increase in cytopathic activity, measured by in vitro monolayer disruption, as well as to a significant increase in
amoebic liver abscess formation in laboratory animals in
comparison to matching controls [10]. Furthermore, the
discovery that amoeba cysteine peptidases possess interleukin-1β converting enzyme activity suggests a novel
mechanism of these enzymes in amoebic virulence [11].
Homology searches based on the conservation of active
site regions revealed that the E. histolytica genome contains a multitude of at least 50 genes coding for cysteine
peptidases (reviewed by Clark et al [12]). Of these, the
majority is structurally related to the C1 papain superfamily, whereas a few others are more similar to family C2
(calpain-like cysteine proteinases), C19 (ubiquitinyl
hydrolase), C48 (Ulp1 peptidase), C54 (autophagin), and
C65 (otubain), respectively [12].
Phylogenetic analyses of the 37 C1-family members
revealed that they represent 3 distinct clades (A, B, C),
each consisting of 13, 11 and 13 members, respectively
[12]. EhCP-A and EhCP-B family members are organised
as classical pre-pro enzymes with an overall cathepsin Llike structure. They differ in length of the pro regions as
well as of the catalytic domains and have specific
sequence motifs within the N-terminal regions of the
mature enzymes. In addition, most members of the EhCPB contain hydrophobic stretches near or at the C-terminus
[12,13]. The primary structure prediction of the 13 EhCPC members indicated a hydrophobic region located 11 to
28 amino acid residues apart from the N-terminus, which
is predicted to form a signal anchor. As there is no example of a structural related cysteine peptidase corresponding to the EhCP-C subfamily, any function of this group
of molecules remains to be determined.

identified within the genome (EhCALP1 and EhCALP2).
These molecules are involved in several cellular processes
including signal transduction pathways, remodelling of
the cytoskeleton and membranes and apoptosis [14].
Another 4 genes were identified coding for enzymes with
homology to the peptidase family C54 also termed
autophagins (EhAUTO1-4). The process of autophagy has
initially been described in other eukaryotic cells as a rescue mechanism that is induced upon starvation or oxidative stress. It is a process by which cells digest parts of their
own cytosolic material. This allows the recycling of molecules under conditions of nutritional limitation and
remodelling of intracellular structure for cell differentiation [15-17].
Four other genes putatively encoding cysteine peptidases
in E. histolytica show homology to members of the C19
and C65 families. These two groups of enzymes are
known to be involved in ubiquitin degradation. In addition 3 genes with homology to Ulp1 peptidase (C48 family) were found. Ulp1 is a member of a family of
peptidases that control the function of SUMO a small
ubiquitin like modifier protein [18].
Only preliminary data are available for other peptidase
family members in E. histolytica. So far, a collagenase [19],
a high molecular weight proteinase [20], a serine-metallo
proteinase [21], a tripeptidyl peptidase I [22] and a serine
protease [23] have been reported.
In this study we have analysed the genome of E. histolytica
for the presence of additional peptidases belonging to the
aspartate, serine and metallo peptidase families. Furthermore, the expression profile of the amoeba genes for the
various proteolytic enzymes was assessed in 7 different E.
histolytica isolates as well as under heat stress conditions
using an oligonucleotide-based microarray and quantitative real time PCR.

Results
Peptidase genes in E. histolytica
Homology search within the E. histolytica genome
revealed a total of 86 genes coding for putative peptidases.
These comprise 50 cysteine peptidases of various families,
all of which belonging to clan CA. In addition, 4 aspartic,
10 serine and 22 metallo peptidase genes were identified
(Figure 1, Table 1). Structural details of the various E. histolytica cysteine peptidases have been described recently
[12].

Primary structure prediction of the other 3 groups of proteolytic enzymes are as follows:

In addition, two genes encoding for putative cysteine
peptidases of the family C2 (calpain-like proteases) were

Table 1: Peptidases of Entamoeba histolytica (Continued)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:170

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/170

Summary of the peptidase gene families identified within the Entamoeba histolytica genome
Figure 1
Summary of the peptidase gene families identified within the Entamoeba histolytica genome. The identified enzymes were
grouped into the corresponding peptidase clans and families according to the MEROPS nomenclature.

Aspartic peptidases
The 4 aspartic peptidases (EhAsP22-1 to EhAsP22-4)
share 30 to 40% sequence identity and are homologous to
intramembrane-cleaving peptidases (clan AD, family
A22). All of them have the specific active site residues
TyrAsp and GlyLeuGlyAsp and contain 7 or 8 transmembrane domains but only EhAsP22-1 and EhAsP22-2 have
recognizable signal peptides, whereas EhAsP22-3 contains a predicted signal anchor motif. EhAsp22-1, -2 and 3 have significant homology to signal peptide peptidases
of various organisms including Trypanosoma cruzi and Arabidopsis thaliana and in addition, EhAsP22-1 and
EhAsP22-3 contain the signal peptide peptidase-specific
motif GlnProAlaLeuLeuTyr [24,25]. The primary structure
of EhAsp22-4 revealed highest identity (35–40%) to putative presenilins of various organisms including Dictyostel-

ium discoideum, Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens, but
a signal peptide or signal anchor is absent.
Serine peptidases
Of the 10 E. histolytica genes coding for putative serine
peptidases, 5 are predicted to belong to clan SC, family S9
(Figure 1, Table 1), with the active site residues Ser, Asp,
His. According to the amino acid residues adjacent to the
active site Ser (GGSYGG), EhSP9-1, -2, and -3 can be
grouped into subfamily C. The sequences of EhSP9-1 and
EhSP9-2 are identical except for a 12 amino acid insertion
present in EhSP9-2. In contrast, EhSP9-3, -4 or -5 share
only 20% sequence identity with EhSP9-1 or EhSP9-2.
The active site residues of EhSP9-4 are not conserved and
for EhSP9-5 only a partial sequence of 102 amino acid residues is available. Thus, a reliable assignment of these two

Page 6 of 15

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:170

enzymes to a specific S9 subfamily is not possible. Signal
peptides were identified only for EhSP9-1, EhSP9-3 and
EhSP9-4, respectively.
Another 3 enzymes were classified into clan SC but represent most likely members of family S28 of serine peptidases (EhSP28-1, -2, -3), which are also known as
lysosomal Pro-Xaa carboxypeptidases. All 3 molecules
have a predicted signal peptide and are of similar size
comprising betwen 457 and 480 amino acid residues.
EhSP28-1 (EhSp1) and EhSP28-2 (EhSp2) have been previously characterized [23]. Both are highly similar as they
share 89% sequence identity, but only 35% to EhSP28-3.
Two other serine peptidases (EhSP26-1 and EhSP26-2)
have homology to members of the signal peptidase family
S26B (clan SF) containing the catalytic dyad Ser and His.
EhSP26-1 has a calculated molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa and contains 2 hydrophobic regions
located near the N- and C-terminus, respectively.
Sequence similarity to other members of this family is
approximately 45%. In contrast, EhSP26-2 shares only
20% sequence identity with members of the S26 family.
Moreover, it does not contain predicted transmembrane
regions and the active site is not conserved.
Metallo peptidases
A considerable number of 22 E. histolytica genes are predicted to encode putative metallo peptidases. These are
relatively diverse and can be attributed to 7 different clans
and 11 different families (Figure 1, Table 1). Six of the
enzymes group into clan MA, with the characteristic zinc
binding-motif consisting of two histidine residues encompassing the sequence HEXXH. One member is assigned to
family M1 (EhMP1-1) and two others to family M3
(EhMP3-1, EhMP3-2). The latter are known as Gluzincins with the third Zn-binding site being a glutamate
residue.

Another two clan MA members (EhMP8-1, EhMP8-2) are
homologous to metzincins, which are characterized by a
C-terminal His residue being a third zinc-binding site. The
two enzymes share 34% sequence identity and both contain a predicted C-terminal transmembrane region but
only EhMP8-1 has a signal sequence.
A further clan MA member belongs to family M48
(EhMP48-1) and contains a predicted signal anchor and 6
additional transmembrane domains. The structure of
EhMP48-1 is homologous to ste24, an endopeptidase
from yeast. Like the yeast enzyme, the amoeba molecule
contains the conserved HEXXH zinc-binding motif,
located between the fourth and the fifth transmembrane
domain.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/170

Another putative metallo peptidase was assigned to clan
ME, family M16C containing the characteristic zinc-binding motif HXXEH. Members of this family are falcilysin
from Plasmodium falciparum, eupitrilysin from Homo sapiens and CYM1 peptidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A group of 6 enzymes (EhMP24-1 to EhMP24-6) was predicted to constitute metallo peptidases of clan MG, family
24, which usually represent cytosolic exopeptidases that
require co-catalytic ions such as cobalt or manganese.
Another 6 peptidases were identified, with homology to
metallo peptidases of clan MH. Of these, 2 constitute
most likely aspartyl aminopeptidases belonging to family
M18 (EhMP18-1, EhMP18-2). They share 40% identity
and approximately 35% with members of this family
from other organisms. The other 4 amoeba enzymes of
clan MH were attributed to family 20 (EhMP20-1 to
EhMP20-4). In general, enzymes of this family hydrolyse
the late products of protein degradation to complete the
conversion of proteins into free amino acids.
The deduced amino acid sequence of a further amoeba
gene revealed homology to clan MK, family 22 of metallo
peptidases. The only enzyme belonging to this family
known so far is the O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase
from Pasteurella haemolytica. At present, the nature of the
active site residues is unknown [26]. Like the amoeba
homologue, the bacterial peptidase does not possess a signal peptide.
In addition, one E. histolytica enzyme was identified
belonging to family M49, clan M. The mammalian homologues are cytosolic dipeptidyl peptidases, which sequentially release N-terminal dipeptides [27]. Moreover, an
enzyme designated EhU48-1 were annotated, which is
similar to EhMP48-1. Like EhMP48-1, it contains a signal
anchor sequence and six transmembrane domains. Nevertheless, homology search grouped this peptidase into the
U48 family. However, the specificities of the two families
are overlapping but not identical [28,29].
Peptidase gene expression of various E. histolytica isolate
under standard axenic culture conditions
To allow detailed expression analyses of the various E. histolytica peptidase genes, a small microarray was designed.
This array contains 86 specific oligonucleotides representing 4 different E. histolytica houskeeping genes, 3 peptidase-inhibitor genes as well as 79 of the 86 identified
peptidase genes. Genes coding for the serine peptidase
EhSP9-4 or for the cysteine peptidases EhCP-A7, EhUBP,
EhUCH, EhUlp-1, EhUlp-2 and EhUlp-3, respectively,
were not included because it was either not possible to
design a specific oligonucleotide or they were identified
after the array was already spotted. In a first attempt,
labelled cDNA from the widely used laboratory strain

Gene expression profile of selected peptidases in E. histolytica isolate HM-1:IMSS.
For microarray analysis nine independent experiments were performed. The signal intensity is indicated in pixel. For real time PCR analysis all
primer sets were run in duplicates. Two biological replicates were investigated. The expression of actin as normalizer was set to 1. The relative
expression of the peptidases were related to actin.

HM-1:IMSS was hybridized to the array (Figure 2). The
results from multiple experiments using RNA preparations from cells grown under standard axenic culture conditions were highly reproducible and indicated that only
3 peptidase genes were expressed at high levels (mean
spot intensity >8000), all of them encoding cysteine proteinases (EhCP-A1, EhCP-A2, EhCP-A5). A set of 17 peptidase genes revealed intermediate expression levels (mean
spot intensity 800 to 3000). This group comprised the
genes for the cysteine peptidases EhCP-A6, -A10, -A11, B2, -C4 and EhCALP1, the aspartic peptidase EhAsP22-1,
the serine peptidase EhSP9-2 and the metallo peptidases
EhMP1-1, 16-1, 18-1, 20-3, 20-4, 24-1, 24-2, 24-6 and 481, respectively. All other peptidase genes were expressed at

levels below the detection limit of Northern blots (mean
spot intensity <700). The reliability of the results obtained
by array hybridization was confirmed by qRT-PCR using a
set of 22 pairs of primers amplyfing cDNAs of the 3 highly
expressed genes as well as a representative number of the
intermediate or low expressed peptidase genes (Table 2).
In order to determine the extend of inter-strain variation
in the expression of peptidase genes, HM-1:IMSS was
compared with 6 different E. histolytica isolates all of them
cultivated under axenic conditions. These isolates originated from different parts of the world and were obtained
from patients with different forms of amoebic disease or
in at least one case from an asymptomatic E. histolytica car-

rier. Pairwise comparison of the various isolates with HM1:IMSS revealed only minor differences in the expression
of the various peptidase genes (Table 3). Three isolates
including the one from an asymptomatic carrier showed
no differences and two isolates differed only in the expression of one gene. In isolate HK-9, expression of the of the
gene for cysteine peptidase EhCP-A5 was decreased by 2.3
fold and in isolate DRP expression of the the gene for the
metallo peptidase EhM48-1 was increased by 5.2 fold. The
only exception was isolate EGG, which revealed differences in expression for 4 peptidase genes. This isolate was
obtained from a patient who simultaneously developed
amoebic colitis and liver abscess. Compared to HM1:IMSS isolate EEG showed decreased expression of the
genes for the cysteine peptidase EhCP-A1 as well as for the
metallo peptidase EhMP20-3 by about 2 fold, and an
increase in the expression of the genes for serine peptidase
EhSP9-2 and for the metallo peptidase EhMP20-1 by
about 2.8 and 8.6 fold, respectively.
Peptidase gene expression in response to heat stress
Previous studies have suggested that the level of expression of a number of cysteine peptidase genes is sensitive
to heat shock [30,31]. To further characterize the influence of heat stress on the expression pattern of the various
E. histolytica peptidase genes, amoeba were cultured at

42°C for 4 hours and compared with amoebae cultivated
under standard culture conditions at 36°C. The results
indicated that only 5 of the 79 peptidase genes investigated were differentially expressed upon heat shock. The
amount of RNA for the highly expressed genes ehcp-a1 and
ehcp-a2 was found to be decreased by about 6 and 4 fold,
respectively, whereas the expression of ehcp-a5, ehcp-a6 or
ehmp8-2 was increased by approximately 2 fold (Table 4).
Similar results were obtained by qRT-PCR. However, there
were no significant differences in expression for the
remaining 74 peptidase genes.

Discussion
In an attempt to annotate all E. histolytica peptidase genes,
a total of 86 putative or known proteolytic enzymes were
identified within the E. histolytica genome. Such a great
number of peptidase genes is not unusual for protozoans.
So far, 110 annotated peptidases were found for Plasmodium falciparum and 70 for Giardia lamblia. Entamoeba,
Plasmodium and Giardia contain aspartic peptidases of the
A22 family. In addition, P. falciparum contains genes
belonging to the A1 family known as plasmepsins. Of the
various cysteine peptidases, the autophagin-like as well as
the OTU-like enzymes are only present in E. histolytica. On
the other hand, several cysteine peptidase families found
in P. falciparum, such as C2, C12, C13, C14, C44 and C56

have no counterpart in Entamoeba. Regarding the serine
and metallo peptidases no striking differences between
the families of Entamoeba, Plasmodium and Giardia became
obvious, except 10 additional peptidase families, that are
peculiar for P. falciparum. The leishmanolysin-like peptidases of the M8 family are specific for E. histolytica and
absent in P. falciparum and G. lamblia, respectively.
Since only a fraction of the 86 putative amoeba peptidases
have been biochemically and functionally characterized
so far, the function and localization of most of the molecules can only be predicted from the deduced primary
structure.
All four aspartic peptidases identified within the Entamoeba histolytica genome may belong to intramembranecleaving proteases, which usually perform downstream
functions such as cell signalling, regulation and intercellular communications [32]. So far, three families of peptidases are known to promote intramembrane cleavage.
These are metallo peptidases represented by the human
site-2 protease [33], serine peptidases represented by Drosophila melanogaster rhomboid-1 [34], and aspartic proteases including human presenilins [35], as well as signal
peptide peptidases [24]. Within the Entamoeba genome,

homologous to only the presenilins and signal peptide
peptidases have been found.
One of the amoebic aspartic peptidases (EhAsp22-4)
shows highest identity to presenilins. So far, the physiological function of presenilins is not fully understood.
Presenilin is one of the subunits that form a multiprotein
complex called gamma-secretase [36]. Homologues are
found in various organisms of different origin such as
Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and even
plants [37,38]. It has been shown that mutations within
this protein are associated with Alzheimer's disease [36].
However, homologues to other subunits of this complex,
such as nicastrin have not been identified within the Entamoeba genome. EhAsp22-4 contains seven putative transmembrane domains. Interestingly, the active site residues
were found within one predicted outside loop of the protein. This is different to the other known presenilins [39].
The 11 identified serine peptidases can be grouped into 3
families. The two amoeba serine peptidases characterized
so far, belong to family S28, previously designated EhSP1
and EhSP2 and now renamed EhSP28-1 and EhSP28-2
[23]. Biochemical analysis revealed that these peptidases
prefer the substrate Suc-AAF-AMC. This enzymatic feature

is identical to that of the E. histolytica tripeptidyl serine
peptidase purified by Flockenhaus and colleagues [22].
Unfortunately, no sequence of the purified tripeptidyl
peptidase is available. In addition to these two described
serine peptidases, one more serine peptidase gene belonging to family S28 has been identified. Microarray analysis
indicated that EhSP28-1, EhSP28-2 and EhSP28-3 are not
expressed or expressed at a very low level, which is in contrast to the results of Barrios-Ceballos and colleagues [23].
They postulated that the identified peptidase activity corresponds to EhSP28-2 and that this protein is associated
with the trophozoite membrane. Using bioinformatic
tools, no hydrophobic stretches or transmembrane
domains could be deduced within EhSP28-2. Due to these
controversial results, the amoeba serine peptidases
require further investigation.
The function of the two S26 family serine peptidases identified within E. histolytica is unknown. Peptidases of this
family are usually membrane proteins and their function
is the processing of newly synthesised secretory proteins.
They remove the hydrophobic, N-terminal signal peptides
as the proteins are translocated across membranes [40].
Four genes belong to the S9 family (homologous to
dipeptidyl-peptidases). One peptidase (SP9-2) shows the
highest expression of all serine peptidases analysed in this
study. However, the function of these enzymes in E. histolytica remains to be determined.
It is likely that some of the E. histolytica serine peptidases
might play a role during the encystation process is it was
shown for E. invadens, the in vitro model organism for enand excystation [41]. Unfortunately, the serine peptidases
involved in the E. invadens encystations processes have
not been identified so far.
A total of 22 genes were identified encoding metallo
peptidases, which are predicted to belong to 11 different
families. The members of two of the identified metallo
peptidase families contain transmembrane domains.

These are the leishmanolysin-like peptidases and the
CAAX prenyl peptidases. EhMP8-1 and EhMP8-2 are
homologous to leishmanolysin found in kinetoplastids.
Leishmanolysin occurs mainly as a heavily-glycosylated
protein that is attached to the outer membrane of Leishmania promastigates by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
anchor. It has been demonstrated that leishmanolysin
plays a role in resistance of promastigotes to complementmediated lysis and in receptor-mediated uptake of the
parasite by phagocytic host cells [42]. There are other
eukaryotes, including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
melanogaster and Homo sapiens that have homologues of
this protein. Nevertheless, highest degree of sequence similarity to the classical leishmanolysin is found for the
enzymes of E. histolytica and Dictyostelium discoideum.
However, the proteins of these two organisms have not
been characterised so far.
Interestingly, under standard axenic culture conditions
only a relatively small number of peptidase genes is significantly expressed. The results are in agreement with a
recent study by Ehrenkaufer et al., in which the expression
pattern of 38 of the 50 different cysteine peptidase genes
were analysed in the standard laboratory E. histolytica isolate HM-1:IMSS [43]. However, in contrast to the results
presented here, Ehrenkaufer et al., found differences in the
expression of a considerable number of peptidase genes
when recent clinical isolates were compared with strain
HM-1:IMSS. The discrepancy between the two studies is
most likely due to differences in the culture media used.
In the study presented here, all E. histolytica isolates were
grown under axenic conditions in a monophasic medium,
whereas Ehrenkaufer et al. cultured their recent clinical
isolates xenically using a diphasic medium and compared
the results with HM-1:IMSS grown under axenic condition in a monophasic medium. As proteolytic enzymes
are considered to be involved in nutrition uptake and
digestion, differences in the composition of the culture
medium and in particular the presence of microorganisms
should considerably influence expression of petidase
genes in Entamoeba.

However, questions remain about possible functions of
all the different peptidases present in E. histolytica. At least
some of them may be involved in encystation- or exystation processes, as described for E. invadens or for a cathepsin C like peptidase of G. lamblia, which is involved in
processing of cyst-wall specific proteins [44]. Aggressive
and invading Entamoeba trophozoites should be endowed
with adequate mechanisms that ensure their protection
against host defence strategies. In this study, the trophozoites were exposed to a temporary heat stress, which
partly mimics the situation during tissue invasion. Heat
stressed amoebae revealed downregulation of the genes
for EhCP-A1 and EhCP-A2 and elevated expression of the
genes for EhCP-A5, EhCP-A6 and EhMP8-2, respectively,
which is in accordance with a recent report by Weber and
colleagues [31]. As EhCP-A6 and EhMP8-2 are expressed
at very low levels during in vitro cultivation, these enzymes
are obviously not essential for parasite growth at least at
standard culture conditions. It has been postulated that
the upregulation of the gene for EhCP-A6 during heat
stress is due to its potential role in the degradation of
damaged proteins [31]. Recently, in few other studies, regulation of peptidase expression in response to various
conditions has been described. In HM-1:IMSS clone L6,
which is deficient in virulence, phagocytosis as well as
cysteine peptidase activity, expression of the genes for
EhCP-A1, EhCP-A2 and EhCP-A5 was significantly
decreased [45]. In contrast, during intestinal colonisation
expression of the genes for EhCP-A1, EhCP-A4 and EhCPA6 was found to be increased [46]. This further highlights
the importance of peptidases for E. histolytica pathogenicity.

Conclusion
Under standard culture conditions only a relatively small
number of at least 86 identified peptidase genes is
expressed and only very few variations become apparent
between various clinical E. histolytica isolates. Nevertheless, here and in few other studies, it was shown that the
peptidase expression can be regulated in response to various conditions. Therefore, further studies are necessary to
understand the role of all or at least most of the peptidases
in the biochemistry and especially for the virulence of E.
histolytica.

Methods
E. histolytica isolates and parasite culture
Seven E. histolytica isolates were used in this study. Strain
HM-1:IMSS was isolated in 1967 from a patient with
amoebic dysentery, strain NIH:200 was isolated in 1949
from a patient with colitis, strain HK-9 was isolated from
a patient with amoebic dysentery (year unknown), strain
DRP was isolated in 1985 from a patient with an amoeboma, strain EGG was isolated in 1988 from a patient
with colitis and amoebic liver abscess, strain 452 was iso-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/170

lated in 1983 from an asymptomatic carrier. Origin of
strain 32 is unknown. HM-1:IMSS, NIH:200 and HK-9 are
standard laboratory strains obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. They were original isolated in
Mexico, India and Korea respectively. All other strains
were isolated in Brasil and kindly provided by Prof. E. F.
Silva, University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brasil.
Different genotypes of the E. histolytica strains were confirmed by PCR-based genotyping based on variation in
the numbers of short tandem repeats that are linked to E.
histolytica tRNAs [47]. Trophozoites of the various isolates
were cultured axenically in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 10% adult bovine serum [48]. Cells were
harvested by chilling on ice and subsequent centrifugation at 430 × g at 4°C for 5 min. The resulting pellet was
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (6.7 mM
NaHPO4, 3.3 mM NaH2PO4, 140 mM NaCl, pH7.2). For
heat shock experiments incubation temperature of cultures was shifted from 36°C to 42°C for 4 hours.
Identification of peptidase homologous of E. histolytica
Conserved domains of cysteine-, serine-, metallo-, or
aspartic-peptidases were used for homology search [49]
against the E. histolytica genome as provided by The Sanger
Centre and The Institute of Genomic Research [50-52].
With the help of MEROPS [53] the identified enzymes
were grouped into the corresponding peptidase clans and
families.
Microarray design
For microarray experiments a 60-base oligonucleotide
array was designed containing probes for 79 of the 86
identified putative peptidase genes. The various oligonucleotides contain similar GC-contents of 35.5% and an
average Tm of 71.6°C, with a standard deviation of 1.17
(range 66–74°C). The oligonucleotides were designed
and synthesized by Eurogentec. Each oligonucleotide was
printed in quadruplicate on glass slides (Advalytix Epoxy
AD100) in a concentration of 50 μM. The spotting procedure was done in cooperation with the University of Marburg
(Genomic
Solutions
OmniGrid).
The
oligonucleotide sequences are listed [see Additional file
1].
RNA isolation, microarray hybridization, sample labelling,
and visualization
Total amoeba RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent
(InVitrogen) according to standard protocols. For microarray analysis 5 μg of total RNA was used. Two biological
replicates including dye swap experiments were performed. The reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was
performed according to the Atlas Superscript Fluorescent
Labeling Kit (TaKaRa) followed by indirect labelling.

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:170

The cDNA labelling was performed with the Cy3- and
Cy5-monoreactive dyes (Amersham). In a typical oligoarray the control cDNA was labelled with Cy3, while the
experimental second cDNA was labelled with Cy5 (and
vice versa for dye swap experiment). Prehybridization and
hybridization was performed using standard protocols.
Microarray data analysis
Each array was scanned at 550 nm (Cy3) and at 650 nm
(Cy5) at a resolution of 5 μm. Calculation and output of
the data was done using ScanArray software, version 3.0
(PerkinElmer). For calculation, the mean signal intensity
(pixel) minus local background (pixel) of each spot was
used. Flagged spots were eliminated. Two methods for
normalizing the data were applied. i) normalization
among the totality of genes and ii) normalization among
housekeeping genes. For the first normalization method,
the signal intensities of each spot of the experiment as
well as of each spot of the control were totalised. The sum
of the experiment over the sum of the control gives the
normalization factor. In order to normalise the control,
the signal intensity of each spot of the control was divided
by this normalization factor. For housekeeping normalization, the calculation was performed in the same manner
as described above but on the basis of the housekeeping
gene spot intensities of the control. Spots with a signal
intensity (pixel) = 300 were excluded from data analysing.
Genes with a ratio of more than 2 and less than 0.5 were
considered as differentially expressed.

Quantitative RT-PCR
In order to validate the results obtained by microarray
analyses, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
by random sampling. Sense and antisense primers were
designed to amplify approximately 100 base pairs [see
Additional file 2]. These primers were designed independently from the oligonucleotides used on the microarray.
Thus, they represent different regions of the same gene.
cDNA synthesis was carried out with SuperScriptIII
Reverse Transcriptase (InVitrogen). In a final volume of
20 μl, 1 μg of RNase-free DNase-treated total RNA was
mixed with 5 × First-Strand buffer, 500 μM dNTPs, 500
nM OdT-T71 (5'-GAG AGA GGA TCC AAG TAC TAA TAC
GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GAT24), 2 mM DTT, 40 U RnaseOut (Invitrogen) and SuperScriptIII (200 U/μl). Incubation was performed for 1 h at 42°C. Quantitative
amplification was performed in a Rotor-Gene (Corbett)
using RealMasterMix (Eppendorf) SYBR Green kit. 1 μl of
the synthesized cDNA was mixed with 2,5× RealMasterMix/20 × SYBR, 5 pmol/μl of the respective sense-primer
and antisense-primer to a final volume of 20 μl. Amplification conditions were as follows: 35 cycles at 95°C for 15
s, 58°C for 20 s and 68°C for 20 s and an adjacent melting
step (42°C–95°C). Two biological replicates were analysed in triplicate. Relative quantification was carried out
