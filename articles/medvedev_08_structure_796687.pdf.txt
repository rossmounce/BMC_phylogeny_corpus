Abstract
Background: Oct4 is a POU-domain transcriptional factor which is essential for maintaining
pluripotency in several mammalian species. The mouse, human, and bovine Oct4 orthologs display
a high conservation of nucleotide sequence and genomic organization.
Results: Here we report an isolation of a common vole (Microtus rossiaemeridionalis) Oct4 ortholog.
Organization and exon-intron structure of vole Oct4 gene are similar to the gene organization in
other mammalian species. It consists of five exons and a regulatory region including the minimal
promoter, proximal and distal enhancers. Promoter and regulatory regions of the vole Oct4 gene
also display a high similarity to the corresponding regions of Oct4 in other mammalian species, and
are active during the transient transfection within luciferase reporter constructs into mouse P19
embryonic carcinoma cells and TG-2a embryonic stem cells. The vole Oct4 gene expression is
detectable starting from the morula stage and until day 17 of embryonic development.
Conclusion: Genomic organization of this gene and its intron-exon structure in vole are identical
to those in all previously studied species: it comprises five exons and the regulatory region
containing several conserved elements. The activity of the Oct4 gene in vole, as well as in mouse,
is confined only to pluripotent cells.

Background
The transcription factor Oct4, known also as Oct3 and
Oct3/4, belongs to class V of the POU (Pit, Oct, Unc) transcription factor family. The POU family includes transcription factors containing the POU domain and
regulating transcription via binding to an octamer motif
located in the promoter or enhancer regions of target
genes [1,2].

An important role of Oct4 factor in sustaining pluripotency of preimplantation embryonic cells and mouse
embryonic stem cells (ES cells) has been convincingly
demonstrated using the directed mutagenesis and RNA
interference [3-5]. Embryos homozygous for Oct4 gene
mutation die during implantation because of the inability
to form the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst [3].

ference induces cell differentiation into trophectodermal
derivatives [4].
The mouse, human, and bovine Oct4 orthologs have a
highly conserved nucleotide sequence and genomic
organization [6-8].
Oct4 gene expression in preimplantation mouse embryo
is confined exclusively to pluripotent ICM cells [9]. After
the implantation, Oct4 expression in somatic tissues
reduces and remains only in primordial germ cells. In
addition, expression of Oct4 is characteristic of embryonic
stem (ES) cell lines, embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells, and
embryonic germ (EG) cell lines [2,10]. Unlike mouse, the
Oct4 expression in human, cattle, and swine preimplantation embryos is not restricted to ICM, but is also observed
in trophectoderm cells [11-13].
Oct4 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by
cis-regulatory elements located in the 5' region of the gene
[14-16]. Analysis of LacZ reporter gene expression, controlled by a fragment of the mouse Oct4 genomic locus,
revealed two elements essential for regulating the cell-specific expression of Oct4 gene. These elements were named
as proximal and distal enhancers. The studies have shown
that distal enhancer is active in ICM, ES, EG and primordial germ cells, whereas the proximal enhancer is needed
to activate Oct4 gene in embryonic ectoderm and mouse
EC cells [15]. So far the structure, expression and regulation of the Oct4 gene have been studied comprehensively
in mouse, human, and cattle [7,17,18]. In this work, a
genomic copy and cDNA of the vole Oct4 gene were isolated and cloned as well as its exon-intron structure and
expression were studied. Nucleotide sequences of the coding and regulatory regions of vole Oct4 gene were compared to the corresponding sequences of six mammalian
species, including mouse, rat, human, chimpanzee, cattle,
and dog. Use of luciferase reporter constructs allowed

demonstrated that individual elements of the regulatory
region of vole Oct4 gene were functionally active in mouse
pluripotent cells. This fact suggests a high conservation of
the system regulating this gene in mammals. A comprehensive study of the genes involved in maintaining
pluripotency such as Oct4 in voles will make it possible to
obtain new information about the species-specific features of their structure, expression, and regulation, and
thereby enhancing optimization of the experiments on
obtaining of vole ES cells.

Results
Nucleotide sequence, exon-intron structure, and
expression of M. rossiaemeridionalis Oct4 gene
Clone containing genomic sequence of vole Oct4 was isolated via screening of the M. rossiaemeridionalis genomic
phage library. Overall, 10315 bp were identified, where
five exons and the regulatory region of Oct4 gene were
conditionally mapped based on the homology to mouse
Oct4 gene sequence. The coding region contains no stop
codons, and canonical splice sites are present at the putative exon-intron boundaries. The minimal promoter, as
well as proximal and distal enhancers were identified
within the regulatory region on the basis of comparative
sequence analysis. Repeated DNA sequences were found
in introns and in the 5' and 3' regions. These repeats are
represented mainly by SINE elements (Figure 1). The
sequences located 3' to exon 5 of vole Oct4 gene, which
were sequenced only partially, displayed a similarity to
the major histocompatibility complex.

To verify the exon-intron structure of vole Oct4 gene, 3'and 5'-RACE experiments were performed. Preimplantation embryos of M. rossiaemeridionalis were used as a
source of RNA. Comparison of cDNA clones obtained by
RACE with the genomic sequence confirmed that vole
Oct4 gene contained five exons corresponding to the Oct4
exons of other mammalian species studied (Figure 1). The

Analysis of the Oct4 gene expression in the embryogenesis of vole M. rossiaemeridionalis by 3'-RACE
method. 3'-RACE products: RNA sources for the experiment: vole embryos at the stage of 2 cells; morulas; blastocysts; 8.0 dpc embryos; 12.0 dpc; 14.5 dpc; 17.0 dpc ovary;
17.0 dpc testis.

splicing sites of vole Oct4 gene transcript are conserved
and follow the GT/AG rule. The detected transcript is 1357
nt long and encodes for a protein with a length of 354 aa.
The 5' UTR is 71 bp long; 3' UTR, 224 bp. Relative to
mouse, the transcription start site of vole Oct4 is located
23 bp farther upstream falling within an 8-bp insertion,
specific to the vole minimal promoter. The polyadenylation signal of vole Oct4 has a species-specific sequence;
the 3' boundary of the gene is located 7 bp upstream of
the mouse gene. In all investigated samples, 2-cell
embryos, morulas, blastocysts, primordial gonads of postimplantation embryos on day 8–17dpc, adult organs
(liver, kidney, spleen, intestine and testicles), cultures of
R1 trophoblast stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm
cells no products of alternative splicing were found for
vole Oct4 gene.

putative regulatory region into mouse ES cell line TG-2a,
mouse EC cells P19, and vole trophoblast stem cells R1.
An empty vector pGL2-Basic has been used as a negative
control. In pluripotent mouse TG-2a cells, pDEH6 plasmid, containing promoter and both enhancers (-2186/
+106) in a direct orientation with respect to luciferase
gene, displayed the highest luciferase activity, which
exceeded the background level (compare to luciferase
activity of empty vector pGL2-Basic) approximately sixfold (Figure 3). Similar, if not even more pronounced
effect was observed when the same construct was transfected into mouse EC cells. Deletion of the distal enhancer
(p DE1, -1895/+106) almost completely abolishes the
promoter activity in TG-2a cells, however it does not have
any effect on the activity in P19 EC cells that demonstrate
equally high luciferase activity as a complete construct.
This observation is in line with the data obtained for
mouse which indicate the crucial role of distal enhancer
for Oct4 activity in ES cells [15].
Deletion of proximal enhancer (PE 1A, pDEH6K4) or
both distal and proximal ehancers (pDEH6S7) reduce the
promoter activity 2–3 folds, demonstrating that the vole
Oct4 promoter is capable of promoter activity in pluripotent cells by itself, but at significantly lower level (Figure
3). The lowest activity comparable to the background was
observed in the case of constructs pDEH7 and pDE2. The
promoter and proximal enhancer in clone pDEH7 were in
the opposite orientation to the gene, and this region (1895/+106) was deleted in clone pDE2. Consistent with
the lack of Oct4 expression in trophoblast cells, no luciferase activity was detected when constructs were transfected into vole TS cell line R1. The data obtained in this
experiment indicate that, similar to mouse, vole Oct4 regulatory elements are necessary for efficient and cell type
specific expression of the gene.

3'-RACE allowed us to detect the expression of vole Oct4
gene during preimplantation development at the morula
and blastocyst stages (2.5–4.5 dpc) and in genital ridges of
postimplantation stages from 8 dpc up to 17 dpc (Figure
2). Transcription of Oct4 gene was undetectable in the
organs of adult voles (the liver, kidneys, spleen, intestines,
and testicles), trophoblast stem cells, and extraembryonic
endoderm cells (data not shown).

Comparative sequence analysis
Vole Oct4 nucleotide sequence was aligned with Oct4
sequences of mouse, rat, human, chimpanzee, cattle, and
dog, obtained from GenBank (Figure 4 and Table 1).
Overall nucleotide sequence homology varies between
81% (vole v. dog) and 89% (vole v. rat), however the
homology is much higher for the exons 2 and 3, encoding
for DNA-binding POU domain in all pairs of species compared (Table 1). The homology is lower (55–70%) in
intronic as well as 5' and 3' UTR regions, especially where
species-specific mobile elements are localized (Figure 4).

Analysis of the activity of vole Oct4 promoter
To analyse the role of putative regulatory elements of vole
Oct4 gene, we have used a luciferase reporter assay (Figure
3). Pluripotent ES cell lines have not been derived for vole
species, therefore we transiently transfected luciferase
reporter vectors containing various elements of vole Oct4

Comparison of the Oct4 amino acid sequences demonstrates relatively high similarity level for the POU-specific
domain for all species under study (encoded by exons 2
and 3, see Figure 1 and Table 1). Surprisingly, the highest
homology is observed between vole and cattle (95%) and
the lowest, between vole and mouse (91%). Thus, the

homology between the amino acid sequences of POU
domain from evolutionarily more distant species (volecattle, vole-human, vole-chimpanzee, and vole-dog)
appeared higher as compared to the pairs of evolutionarily related species belonging to the same order (volemouse, vole-rat). When comparing the total homology of
Oct4 proteins, we found that vole and rat are the most
similar (87%). It is of considerable interest that mouse
Oct4 protein demonstrates the least amino acid homology with closely related vole (81%), as well as with all
other species studied (data not shown). Such a low similarity between mouse and vole Oct4 proteins contrasts
with much higher nucleotide homology (87%) between
Oct4 genes in these species.
Next we compared the regions important for Oct4 gene
regulation and function (Figure 5). Previously it was demonstrated that three motifs (GGGAGGG in the proximal
enhancer, CCCTCCC the distal enhancer, and

GGGGGCGGGG in the minimal promoter) represent
transcription factor binding sites in mouse ES and EC cells
[19]. Treatment of undifferentiated ES and EC cells with
retinoic acid causes loss of transcription factor binding to
these motifs, thereby suppressing Oct4 gene expression
and leading to cell differentiation. Therefore we have analysed the conservation of these three motifs as well as several other motifs located in the regulatory region.
The homology between the minimal promoters varies
between 83–98% in different mammalian species. In vole
and other mammals, the GGGGGCGGGG motif (positions -126/-117 in vole) within the minimal promoter is
the most conserved (Fig. 5C). It is a potential transcription
factor binding site for the factors of Sp family, partially
overlaps the hormone responsive element (HRE) (positions -119/-101 in vole), is sensitive to retinoic acid, and
is recognized by some nuclear receptors [8,14,15,19,20]
(Fig. 5C). However, not all the elements of Oct4 gene

basal promoter exhibit similar conservation. The GGGTGGG motif (-98/-92) is 100% homologous in all the species except for dog. The CCCACCC motif (-159/-153) is
identical in mouse, cattle, and dog; but it is different in rat,
human, and chimpanzee. The GGGAGGG site (positions
-76/-71 in the mouse sequence) identical in the six species
compared but is partially changed in vole, being represented by GGGAAGG sequence. At a distance of one
nucleotide from this site in the vole sequence, another

GC-rich site is located, GGGCGGG (-79/-73); this site is
absent in the sequences of other species (Figure 5C).
Upstream the basal promoter, the two motifs display a
high conservation, namely, CCCTCCC (-2125/-2119),
which is identical in all species except for dog, and
GGGAGGG (-1176/-1170). These motifs are located in
the distal and proximal enhancers, respectively. In addition, several other GC-rich motifs of CCC(A/T)CCC and
GGG(A/T)GGG types with different levels of homology to

the sequences of other species were detected in vole. Two
overlapping GGGAGGGGTGGG sites are located at positions -1176/-1165 of vole Oct4 gene regulatory region; the
site GGGAGGG (-1176/-1170) from this region displays a
100% homology in all the species compared. As for the
site GGGTGGG (-1171/-1165), it is completely homologous only in vole, rat, and mouse. Superposed GGGTGGGGTGGG sites are also located at positions -2031/2020. Both parts of this superposed site are changed in
other species; however, in the site with positions -2026/2020, all the species except for vole contain the substitution of thymine for with adenine. This results on formation of GGGAGGG site, which is also potentially
functional (Figure 5A, B and Table 2).
Five so-called E boxes, having a 5'-CANNTG-3' consensus
and being potential binding sites for transcription factor
Mash-2 [21] were detected in the 5' region of vole Oct4
gene (-2547/-1). The most conserved E box is located at
positions -332/-327 and -978/-973 of the vole Oct4 gene
regulatory region; it retains the consensus in the four species compared (no data are available for dog). The E box
at positions -978/-973 is identical to human, chimpanzee,
and bovine sequences, but differs in mouse and rat. The E
box at positions -479/-474 displays a 100% homology to
human and chimpanzee sequences and is absent in
mouse and rat sequences. Potential binding sites for transcription factor Pem, with an ATTA consensus, were
detected in the regulatory region of vole Oct4 gene at positions -665/-662, -1899/-1894, -1995/-1992, -2254/-2251,
-2373/-2370, and -2541/-2538. The ATTA site located at
positions -1995/-1992 displays an absolute homology in
all species; the site at positions -2254/-2251 shows a
100% homology to human, chimpanzee and bovine
sequences; and at positions -2373/-2370 is identical to the
mouse sequence.
In the 5' region of vole Oct4 gene, an autoregulatory composite site was detected, containing potential binding sites
for transcription factors Oct4 (5'-AGATGCAT-3') and
Sox2 (5'-GACAAAG-3'). Electrophoretic mobility shift

assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
indicate that transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2 bind
directly to the composite Oct4/Sox2 elements in Oct4 and
Sox2 genes in mouse and human ES cells [22,23]. In vole,
this site is located at positions -2081/-2067 and displays a
87–93% homology to the sequences found in regulatory
regions of other mammalian species (Figure 5A and Table
2).
The sequences located upstream of the Oct4 minimal promoter are not conserved; their homology reflects the
degree of evolutionary relationship of the species compared. Nevertheless, the short sequences corresponding to
site 2A of the distal enhancer and sites 1A and 1B of the
proximal enhancer are distinctly detectable even in the
evolutionally distant species. The homology between vole
and the species taken for comparison varies from 81 to
94% in the region of site 2A of the distal enhancer; in the
region of proximal enhancer site 1A, from 68 to 89%; and
in the region of proximal enhancer site 1B, from 88 to
96% (Table 2).

Discussion
In this work, an ortholog of the vole M. rossiaemeridionalis
gene encoding transcription factor Oct4, which is involved
in sustaining the pluripotent cell state at the early stages of
embryogenesis, has been isolated and studied. Genomic
organization of this gene and its intron-exon structure in
vole are identical to those in all previously studied species:
it comprises five exons and the regulatory region containing several conserved elements. A tight coupling with the
major histocompatibility complex is typical of the vole
Oct4, as well as of its orthologs in mouse, cattle, and
human [7,17,18].
Comparative analysis of nucleotide sequences and the
experiments with transient transfection of Oct4 gene promoter and its regulatory regions within reporter constructs
demonstrate once again the conservation of these
sequences and their functions. Individual substitutions
and insertions in this region detected in the vole Oct4 do

not prevent transcription of this gene in the pluripotent
mouse cells. The element that is absolutely necessary for
the activity of this gene is the region of minimal promoter
(-527/-1); the other elements cannot provide the transcription by themselves and are only able to modulate its
level. Moreover, the activation and modulation of transcription depend not only on the presence of certain elements, but also on their correct orientation relative to the
transcription start site. In addition, the results obtained
demonstrate that Oct4 regulatory regions function in different types of pluripotent cell. A lower activity of the construct with deleted distal enhancer in TG-2a cells versus
P19 line cells supports the idea that the distal enhancer is
a key element providing a high activity of Oct4 gene in
embryonic stem cells [15].
The comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences of
Oct4 orthologs in seven mammalian species demonstrated a high conservation of the genomic organization,

coding region, and the main elements (minimal promoter, distal, and proximal enhancers) of Oct4 gene regulatory region. Phylogenetic sequence analysis of the
promoter regions showed that the most conserved elements in this region are the sites for transcription factors
of Sp1 family and the hormone-responsive element,
which retain high similarity and similar organisartion. In
addition, a high homology of GC-rich motifs and autoregulatory Oct4/Sox2 site was observed, whereas the homology of other elements in the regulatory region, in
particular, the sites for transcription factors Mash-2 and
Pem, is rather limited. This fact may suggest that the GCrich motifs and autoregulatory Oct4/Sox2 site are the elements that are most essential for the regulation of Oct4
gene expression.
Note that Oct4 is the most conserved among the genes
involved in sustaining the pluripotency. For comparison,
the Nanog gene of mouse and human shows a 58% similarity on their nucleotide sequence in the gene coding
region [24]. However, despite the conservation of these
sequences, considerable interspecific differences in
expression of this gene are detectable in ontogenesis.
Expression of this gene in vole is detected at the early preimplantation (morula, blastocyst) stages and also in the
genital ridges of postimplantation embryos. Presumably,
the expression of Oct4 gene in postimplantation vole
embryos depends on its activity in primordial germ cells,
the gamete precursors, as was shown also for mouse [25].
Expression of vole Oct4 gene is undetectable in the organs
of adult animals and somatic cell lines, unlike the human
Oct4, which is detected in adult tissues [17,18]. The vole
Oct4 transcript shows no alternative variants of splicing,
which is characteristic of human [18]. Since the expression of this gene was not found in the trophoblast stem
cell lines and extraembryonic endoderm lines of M. rossiaemeridionalis, this suggests that, at the stage of late blastocyst, this gene in vole, as well as in mouse, is expressed
only in epiblast cells. Conceivably, the epiblast cells in
vole late blastocysts retain the pluripotent state at least up
to the start of implantation, which allows expecting a successful obtaining of ES cells in this species.

Conclusion
In this study, we cloned, sequenced and an alysed vole
ortholog of Oct4 gene. A special attention was focused on
studying the regulatory region of Oct4 gene using reporter
constructs and comparative sequence analysis. The comparison involved a large number of species (seven, including the vole sequence that we determined) belonging to
various families, which allowed us to detect the most evolutionarily conserved elements in the regulatory region
containing the potential transcription factor binding sites.
Using the reporter constructs, we have demonstrated that

the enchanter element and promoter of vole Oct4 gene are
active in mouse pluripotent cells. We analysed vole Oct4
gene expression in early preimplantation embryos, genital
ridges of postimplantation embryos, adult tissues and
stem cell lines precursors of trophoblast and extraembryonic endoderm. We have found expression only in preimplantation embryos and in genital ridges, containing
primordial germ cells, consistent with Oct4 being
expressed specifically in pluripotent cells.

Methods
Microtus rossiaemeridionalis genomic library screening
Lambda DASH II genomic library of vole M. rossiaemeridionalis [26] has been screened according to a conventional
method [27] using vole genomic PCR fragment as a probe.
The PCR fragment has been amplified with the primers
Oct2F (5'-ccaagctgctgaagcagaaga-3') and Oct5R (5'-tttgaatgcatgggagagccca-3') designed from the most conserved region of mouse and human Oct4 exons 2 and 5.
Sequence analysis revealed that amplified 631 bp vole
fragment is a processed Oct4 pseudogene, since its
sequence shows homology to the mouse Oct4 transcript,
does not contain introns and includes several stop
codons. The screening gave several clones from which the
clone containing full Oct4 gene with surrounding
sequences was selected by PCR analysis. The nucleotide
sequence of the clone was determined according to the
protocol ABI PRISM BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Perkin-Elmer Corporation) in an ABI PRISM 377 automated sequencer
using universal and gene-specific primers. Sequence data
has been processed using SeqMen program (DNASTAR
Inc.). The clones, carrying Oct4 pseudogenes were not
used in the further study. The genomic and cDNA
sequences of M. rossiaemeridionalis gene Oct4 is deposited
with the GeneBank under accession numbers: EF032593
and EF030115, respectively.
Cell cultures and media
TG-2a mouse ES cells were cultured in GMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS;
Autogen Bioclear, UK), 1% non-essential amino acids, 1
mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 0.1
mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 103 U/ml ESGRO (Chemicon). P19 cells were grown in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and 50 U/ml penicillinstreptomycin. Vole trophoblast stem cells (R1) were cultivated in the medium containing 40% DMEM (Invitrogen), 40% F12 medium, 15% FCS, 1% nonessential
amino acids, 50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mM Lglutamine, nucleotides (0.03 mM ATP, 0.01 mM TTP,
0.01 mM GTP, and 0.01 mM CTP), and 1000 U/ml vole
leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The cells were grown in
gelatinised flasks.

Reporter vector construction
To obtain a reporter construct containing distal enhancer
of the vole Oct4 gene (pDE2) fragment of regulatory
region (-2186/-1895) was cloned into pGL2-Basic vector
(Promega) in BglII-HindIII sites at the 5' region of luciferase gene. To produce a construct enclosing all elements
of the regulatory region a (-1895/+106) fragment, containing proximal enhancer and promoter region of vole
Oct4 gene, was cloned into plasmid pDE2 at HindIII site
(pDEH6 construct). The (-1895/+106) fragment was also
cloned into pDE2 in an opposite orientation (pDEH7
construct). In addition, a fragment (-1895/+106) alone
was cloned into pGL2-Basic vector in both orientations
relative to luciferase gene (constructs pΔDE1 and pΔDE2,
respectively). Deletion of 1A site in proximal enhancer
was achieved by KpnI digestion and following self-ligation
of pDEH6 plasmid, producing pDEH6K4. pDEH6S7 plasmid, containing only the promoter region (-603/+106) of
vole Oct4 gene, was obtained by excision of SmaI fragment from pDEH6 plasmid.
Transient transfection with reporter vectors
TG-2a mouse ES cells, P19 mouse EC cells, and R1 vole
trophoblast stem cells were plated into six-well plates
(Nunc) at 0.5 × 106 cells per well and cultivated for 24 hrs.
Each reporter construct (4 μg/well) was transfected into
cells using Lipofectamin2000 (Invitrogen). Cell lysate was
prepared 48 hrs after the transfection; luciferase activity
was detected using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
Transfection of the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) without
insertion was used as a control of the basic level of luciferase activity. Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate.
RNA isolation, RT-PCR, 3'- and 5'-RACE
Vole preimplantation embryos were collected in 50 μl of
sterile PBS (1.7 mM KH2PO4, 5.5 mM Na2HPO4, and 150
mM NaCl). RNA was isolated from morula, blastocysts,
and primordial gonads of postimplantation embryos on
day 8–17dpc, from adult organs (liver, kidney, spleen,
intestine and testicles), cultures of R1 trophoblast stem
cells and extraembryonic endoderm cells using TRI-REAGENT (Sigma). RNA samples were treated with DNAse to
eliminate DNA contamination (TurboDNA-free kit,
Ambion). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 5'- and 3'-RACE were
performed with BD SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification
Kit (Clontech). Gene-specific primers used for Oct4 RACE
were oct4_3'RACE1: (5'-tggagaagtgggtggaggaagccgacaaa3') and oct4_5'RACE2 (5'-ggttgggggtcacgccgttctcaat-3');
strandspecific primer for β-actin cDNA synthesis was: Bass
(5'-acacgcagctcattgtac-3'), PCR primers for β-actin were:
BA11 (5'-gatatcgctgcgctggtcgt-3') and BA2 (5'-agatcttctccatgtcgtcc-3') [28]. Vole genomic DNA was used as RACE
negative control. The RACE products were cloned into

pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence
of clones was determined in both directions with universal primers.
