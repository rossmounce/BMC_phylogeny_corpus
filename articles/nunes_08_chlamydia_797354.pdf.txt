<p>Analysis of 15 serovars of <it>Chlamydia trachomatis</it> reveals an evolutionary arms race in pathogen-host interactions.</p>
Evolution of pathogen tropism

Abstract
Background: The genomes of pathogens are thought to have evolved under selective pressure
provided by the host in a coevolutionary arms race (the 'Red Queen's Hypothesis'). Traditionally,
adaptation by pathogens is thought to rely not on whole chromosome dynamics but on gain/loss
of specific genes, yielding differential abilities to infect distinct tissues. Thus, it is not known whether
distinct host organs differently shape the genome of the same pathogen. We tested this hypothesis
using Chlamydia trachomatis as model species, looking at 15 serovars that infect different organs:
eyes, genitalia and lymph nodes.
Results: We analyzed over 51,000 base pairs from all serovars using various phylogenetic
approaches and a non-phylogenetic indel-based algorithm to study the evolution of individual and
concatenated loci. This survey comprised about 33% of all single nucleotide polymorphisms in C.
trachomatis chromosomes. We present a model in which genome evolution indeed correlates with
the cell type (epithelial versus lymph cells) and organ (eyes versus genitalia) that a serovar infects,
illustrating an adaptation to physiologically distinct niches, and discarding genetic drift as the
dominant evolutionary driving force. We show that radiation of serovars occurred primarily by
accumulation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in intergenomic regions, housekeeping genes, and
genes encoding hypothetical and cell envelope proteins. Furthermore, serovar evolution also
correlates with ecological success, as the two most successful serovars showed a parallel evolution.
Conclusion: We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism-based tissue-specific arms race for
strains in the same species, reflecting global chromosomal dynamics. Studying such tissue-specific
arms race scenarios is crucial for understanding pathogen-host interactions during the course of
infectious diseases, in order to dissect pathogen biology and develop preventive and therapeutic
strategies.

Background

When two species interact with each other, such as a pathogen and human, a never-ending reciprocal and dynamic

adaptation process takes place. Whereas the 'goal' of the
human being is to try to avoid, solve or minimize the infection, the 'goal' of the pathogen is to deal with this constant

host environmental and immune pressure, through genomic
evolutionary changes, in order to win this arms race [1-4].
Typically, genome evolution within same-species strains of a
pathogen has been studied mainly in the light of horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) at specific chromosome loci [5,6], as for
Escherichia coli [7,8], Staphylococcus aureus [9], Streptococcus pyogenes [9], Salmonella enterica [10], Shigella
flexneri [11], and Pseudomonas syringae [3]. An extreme
example is provided by the well-studied E. coli, where strains
K-12 and O157 differ by more than 1 million base pairs [12],
and same-serovar strains were found to present profound differences in gene content [13,14]. Globally, these targeted HGT
events reflect different pathoadaptation processes for microrganisms with reversible genome size-plasticity; depending
on the transitory 'cassette-genes' carried at any specific time,
the pathogenecity or ability of these microrganisms to infect
different tissues may vary [7]. Thus, generally, these processes rely on gain/loss of virulence/colonization factors
rather than reflect whole chromosomal dynamics, the evaluation of which remains complex. Indeed, assessment of tissuespecific adaptive evolution at the whole genome level
demands that same-species strains of a pathogen specifically
and non-transitorily infect different tissues. Therefore, on
behalf of the arms race theory assumed by the evolutionary
Red Queen's Hypothesis [15,16], one question arises: do distinct host organs differently shape the genome of the same
pathogen? No microrganism is more suitable than Chlamydia trachomatis, the most prevalent sexually transmitted
bacterial pathogen worldwide, to test this hypothesis, as the
species comprises several serovars with a wide range of specific human tissue tropism. This pathogen is mainly classified
into 15 serovars based on the differential immunoreactivity of
the major outer membrane protein (MOMP), constituting
three disease groups [17]: serovars A-C and Ba are commonly
associated with ocular trachoma; serovars D-K infect the epithelial cells of genitalia and are normally found in non-invasive sexually transmitted infections (where serovar E
represents about one-third of all infections, and together with
serovar F constitute up to 50% of them); serovars L1-L3 are
also sexually transmitted but are invasive and disseminate
into the local lymph nodes causing lymphogranuloma
venereum (LGV). However, in the context of this classification system, the evaluation of adaptive evolution becomes
enigmatic because there is no correlation between it and C.
trachomatis tropism nor with the ecological success of the
different serovars, as strains with different organ specificities
are placed within the same classification group.
As occurred for Mycobacterium leprae [18], Rickettsia prowazekii [19], and the aphid endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola [20], the first stages of Chlamydia evolution consisted of
a massive genome reduction upon becoming an obligate
intracellular parasite [21,22]. However, comparative genomics over the few currently fully sequenced C. trachomatis
genomes [20,23-25] revealed that gene decay is not involved
in the more recent evolutionary stages. Indeed, contrary to

Volume 9, Issue 10, Article R153

Nunes et al. R153.2

most pathogens, the core- and the pan-genome [6] of this
microrganism are near identical, indicating that the factors
involved in the differential organ specificity among serovars
are not acquired by gene transfer [24].
To evaluate if distinct arms races occur between different
infected human organs and this pathogen's serovars, we performed high-scale concatenation-based phylogenomics,
using about one-third of all chromosome single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). So far, in contrast to the ocular
group, only one strain from the epithelial-genital and LGV
groups has been fully sequenced [20,23-25], making our multiple-loci scrutiny of all 15 serovars the ideal tool to track the
evolutionary diversity of a microrganism characterized for its
distinct infection niches. Here, we show a matchless model of
SNP-based adaptive evolution of same-species strains to each
infected cell-type and organ that relies on whole chromosome
evolutionary dynamics, unlike previous reports for other
pathogens focused on specific gene gain/loss.

Results
Evaluation of the degree of polymorphism for the
selected loci
Considering that the strain radiation yielding the present-day
chlamydial serovars likely occurred over millions of years
[26], the use of reference strains is an accurate strategy as
they were isolated only a few decades ago. Thus, in this evolutionary survey, we used the traditional reference strains that
represent all 15 C. trachomatis serovars. We selected 51 polymorphic loci (approximately 51,000 bp) dispersed throughout the chromosome (Figure 1; Additional data file 1) that
represent the following loci categories: 16 intergenomic
regions (IGRs); 16 genes encoding cell envelope proteins
(CEPs); 13 housekeeping genes (HKs); and 6 genes encoding
hypothetical or unclassified proteins (HPs) (Additional data
file 2). In order to evaluate the degree of polymorphism of
these loci in comparison with the whole chromosome, we
used the data generated from two of the five fully sequenced
genomes, A/Har13 (ocular) [23] and D/UW3 (epithelial-genital) [21]. We observed in the studied 51 loci a global mutation
rate 14.3-fold higher than in the remaining chromosome
regions (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001). Moreover, we found
1,099 SNPs in these 51 loci between A/Har13 and D/UW3,
which is greater than 200-fold more than what has been studied to date through concatenation [27], and comprises about
33% of the whole chromosome SNPs, indicating that our
results could be scaled up to the full-chromosome level.
Additionally, a global overview of GC content revealed a mean
value for all loci categories (data not shown) that is similar to
the total mean GC content of approximately 41% observed for
the fully sequenced genomes [21,23-25] with a standard deviation of 2.9%, which is not indicative of any putative HGT
event.

marked on the figure.

Correlation of individual loci with tissue-specific strain
radiation
We used phylogenomics to correlate each individual locus
with tissue-specific strain radiation. Only four (25.0%) CEPs
(incD, incE, pmpF and pmpH) and one (6.3%) IGR (incD/
incE) comprehensively grouped the strains according to their
cell-type/organ appetence (that is, revealed a larger evolutionary distance between strains with different niche appetencies than between strains infecting the same niche; Figure
2a). This clustering seems to be associated with loci revealing
a higher p-distance-based polymorphism (Mann-Whitney P
= 0.025). A full segregation by cell-type/organ appetence was
not seen for most of the remaining CEPs due to the heterogeneity among the genital strains, where serovars E and F frequently form a separate cluster for 62.5% of CEPs (Figure 2a).
Globally, 77.6% of loci belonging to different functional categories grouped strains that invade the lymph nodes as an
individual cluster (LGV cluster), and the clustering of strains
infecting the ocular tissue (ocular cluster) was also frequent.
As above, we identified a significant association between a
higher absolute number of SNPs and both the occurrence of a
LGV cluster and an ocular cluster for each locus (Mann-Whit-

ney P = 0.037 and P = 0.045, respectively). Interestingly,
from the loci that better illustrate adaptation to lymph nodes,
80% of HPs and 53% of CEPs, compared with only 29% of
HKs, show >50% non-synonymous SNPs (Figure 2b). Considering the DNA replication process, all SNPs on one strand
that may imply strain segregation will also have the same
impact on the other DNA strand. However, from the 51 loci
that we used, only 4 pairs of loci overlap and the overlapping
region never exceeds 10 bp (data not shown), which makes
this effect negligible. Overall, these results suggest that the
distinct genetic variability of strains infecting a specific celltype/organ likely reflects an evolutionary adaptation process.
By performing intra-locus analysis, we observed that three
HPs (CT049, CT144 and CT622) and two IGRs (rs2/ompA
and ompA/pbpB) revealed distinct domains in which SNPs
are concentrated, instead of being randomly distributed, and
are associated with strains that infect a specific cell-type/
organ (Figure 3). For these HPs, the SNP domains correspond
to clusters of amino acid changes in the protein sequence
(data not shown), mirroring the previous findings for some
polymorphic membrane protein genes [28]. Unfortunately,

there is no assigned role for these open reading frames, which
rules out any speculation about the functional implications of
these specific clustered amino acid alterations. Nevertheless,
this tissue-specific amino acid clustering points to a targeted
fixation of mutations that may reflect the host-pathogen specific interaction within each organ.

Genomic analysis of the concatenated loci
We evaluated the nucleotide sequence variation in each concatenated loci category (Table 1). We highlight the multi-loci
concatenation approach as a powerful tool to generate robust
phylogenomic inferences, even when individual loci have
evolved with different substitution patterns [29-31]. Overall,
the HPs exhibit the highest number of variable sites (10.3%),
whereas the HKs are the least variable (3.3%), which is supported by the mean p-distance values. Curiously, the IGRs
show polymorphism similar to the CEPs. Globally, concatenation of all 51 loci yielded a 'super' sequence of up to 51,074
bp for each of the 15 reference strains, showing a mean of
1,032.1 (standard error (SE) 17.2) nucleotide differences.

Evolutionary history of C. trachomatis
Due to the speed and efficiency of the neighbor joining (NJ)
method in inferring large phylogenies [32,33], we used this
approach on concatenated data. The NJ phylogenies inferred
from the four concatenated loci categories (Additional data
file 3) are consistent with most of the respective individual
loci trees. Although only the CEP category clearly segregates
strains by the disease they cause, the other categories show a
notable segregation of at least one disease group, suggesting
that heterogeneous loci categories are involved in the arms
race process. The global phylogenetic tree presented in Figure
4 (where each taxon is represented by about 50,000 bp)
reveals the putative final picture of C. trachomatis's evolution, showing strain grouping according to the cell-type (epithelial and lymph cells) and organ (eyes and genitalia) that
they infect. These distinct segregations are supported by maximum bootstrap values (99-100%) in the nodes that separate
disease groups, reinforcing that the targeted and distinct fixation of nucleotide changes on strains infecting a specific celltype/organ are likely adaptive and barely the consequence of
genetic drift. In fact, the genetic distance matrix (Table 2)
shows that all strains that preferentially infect the eyes

sively seen for any individual loci (except for the CEPs pmpF
and pmpH; data not shown) due to the separation of E and F
strains. Indeed, the latter has a mean genetic distance of 673
(SE 16) nucleotides to the other epithelial-genital strains
(Table 2). Similar NJ tree topologies were obtained for the
three models used to estimate evolutionary distances
(Kimura 2-parameter (K2P), Jukes-Cantor or Tamura-Nei)
as well as for the maximum parsimony method (data not
shown), with only slight variations in the bootstrap values,
which supports the robustness of these distinct arms race scenarios.
We also highlight the loci that most contribute to the final tree
topology (Figure 4), as they may be relevant for the evolutionary adaptation to each specific niche. Among these loci, we
have found either highly conserved or polymorphic loci for
strains infecting the same cell-type/organ. The former may
represent a step forward in the evolutionary process by
revealing the final stages [1] of this tissue-specific adaptive
evolution, while the latter may also be involved in pathogenic
differences between strains infecting the same tissue [25].
The most extreme case is given by the CEP pmpF, where all
the strains that infect the lymph nodes are 100% similar but
show a mean distance of 312 and 421 SNPs to strains infecting
the epithelial-genital and ocular tissues, respectively. In contrast, the epithelial-genital strains reveal up to 129 SNPs
among them (data not shown). Although less markedly,
CT049 is polymorphic among the LGV strains but near 100%
identical among the ocular strains.
Additionally, we identified loci that do not seem to have influenced adaptation to each niche, since they generate an incongruent strain-radiation (Table 3), and whose polymorphism
may thus be a consequence of genetic drift. However, previous results have demonstrated the involvement of some of

these loci (CT622, tsf, rs2 and pbpB) in the pathogenesis of
trachoma [25]. As expected because of the serovar multiplicity, the epithelial-genital group revealed a higher number of
polymorphic loci, and, overall, these loci belong to different
categories. In contrast, strains infecting the lymph nodes constitute the most homogeneous group.

Impact of small insertions/deletions (indels) on tissuespecific strain radiation
In order to have a more complete picture of the evolution of
the serovars, we studied the chromosomal occurrence of
small insertion/deletion (indel) events, which are non-phylogenetic parameters. We observed 84 small indel events (from
1-43 bp) inside the global concatenated loci for all strains,
which mainly occurred within the IGR and CEP categories
(Additional data file 4). None of these events was found to disrupt the coding sequence of the respective loci, indicating the
absence of gene decay in the studied regions.
For the global concatenated data, we estimated the evolutionary distances using the indel-based parameter γ [34], which
computes the number of gap nucleotides per nucleotide site
between those sequences, while SNPs are not considered. The
γ-distances (Figure 5a) are highly concordant with phylogenomic analyses, showing high heterogeneity within the epithelial-genital strains, and remarkable homogeneity among
the LGV strains. Also, they revealed a segregation of strains
by their cell-type/organ appetencies, which supports the tissue-specific arms race scenario.

Evolutionary inferences on the ecological success
Analysis of the global phylogenetic tree (Figure 4) also shows
that the two most prevalent genital serovars worldwide, E and
F, are closely related and separated from the other epithelialgenital strains. This segregation is observed for the majority

of loci, with the exception of the HPs (Figure 2a). From all
these loci, 70% of CEPs show an amino acid replacement for
>50% of SNPs, compared to only 20% of HKs (Figure 2b).
Curiously, the most remarkable segregation of E and F was
seen for two IGRs (rs2/ompA and yfh0_1/parB) and three
HKs (karG, tsf and rs2) (Figure 4). Furthermore, for the still
unclassified protein gene CT622 and for the IGR rs2/ompA,
we observed a non-random distribution of SNPs that are
present in serovars E and F but not in the other epithelialgenital strains (Figure 3c,d). Finally, the mean γ-distance
from any epithelial-genital strain to serovar E or F was from
3.4-fold (between G and E/F) to 4.7-fold (between I and E/F)
higher than the distance between E and F (Figure 5b), which

supports this close relationship between the two most ecologically successful serovars.

Discussion

We have hypothesized that distinct arms races may occur
inside the same host when the same pathogen is able to infect
different organs. In contrast to free living bacteria, where
HGT is strongly associated with a pathogen's adaptive evolution [3,5-11], Chlamydia has been characterized by genetic
isolation and, while cumulative studies suggest that HGT has
almost certainly occurred in Chlamydiaceae [35-37], there is
no report to date of transferable mobile elements in C. tra-

models are appealing approaches. However, C. trachomatis
is genetically non-tractable and, except for the cynomolgus
monkey (accurate for studying the trachoma pathology) [25],
no suitable animal model exists for the three types of C. trachomatis disease. Also, there is no in vitro model, such as cell
culture, that mirrors the chlamydial infection in vivo, and it
has been previously demonstrated that intensive serial passaging of chlamydial strains yielded no mutations on the most
variable chlamydial gene (ompA) [38]. Furthermore, it would
be inconceivable that these approaches could represent millions of years of chlamydial evolution.

that preferentially infect the eyes, the epithelial-genital cells

It is believed that the LGV biovar was the first to diverge from
a common C. trachomatis ancestor when new primate hosts
evolved after the dinosaur extinction, whereas separation of
genital and ocular serovars might have occurred with the
appearance of early humanoid primate hosts [26]. The skill to
colonize different organs and cell-types likely developed
through indel events and SNP accumulation on virulence/colonization factors. So far, chlamydial putative virulence factors, such as the type III effector tarp [23], the cytotoxin gene
[39], and especially the tryptophan operon [40,41], are the
best candidates for providing that skill. In particular, while
the first of these factors differentiates the LGV strains from
the other groups, the other two differentiate the strains colonizing the genitalia from the strains colonizing other niches.
For example, it was clearly demonstrated that only strains
possessing a functional trpBA operon are able to colonize the

genital tract [41]. With respect to type III effectors, although
their role in C. trachomatis tropism is not clear, it was shown
that evolutionary genetic diversification of the type III effector HopZ family, via horizontal transfer, had clear implications for Pseudomonas syringae host specificity [3].
However, none of the chlamydial putative virulence factors
fully explain the existence of the three major tropism groups
made up from the different serovars. Also, the putative emergence of tissue-specific adhesins cannot be discarded.
With regard to our results (Figure 4), strain radiation within
each disease group likely occurred because of accumulation of
mutations throughout the chromosome caused by environmental and immune pressure in each niche, giving rise to the
contemporary serovars. Within the genitalia, the higher serovar multiplicity and radiation of epithelial-genital strains
compared to the LGV strains would be unexpected in the light
of the earlier evolutionary divergence of the latter [26]. However, besides the different host immune responses in those
niches, the epithelial-genitalia environment presents pH and
hormonal fluctuations that are variable among individuals,
and also an abundant nutrient-competing flora, which could
have strongly influenced the evolutionary pathway of the
infecting strains. In support of this, nutrient-competing flora
were shown to be a major factor in the successful pathoadaptation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to the
intestinal tract, as the inflammatory process induced by this
pathogen was shown to make a negative impact on mainly the
other colonizing microrganisms and, thus, a positive impact
on its arms race with the host [42].
Globally, we have observed that the loci that most contribute
to strain segregation by cell-type/organ are spread throughout the chromosome (Figure 1) and belong to different functional categories, suggesting that this dynamic evolutionary
adaptation is a general trait of the entire genome. Whereas
the contribution of CEPs is likely associated with putative
structural, antigenic or host-adhesion roles, no assumption
can be made for the HPs. However, we found that HPs were
the most variable among the serovars, with an overall polymorphism 2.2-fold higher than the CEPs (Table 1), which suggests a higher involvement in chromosomal dynamics. With
respect to IGRs, we speculate that their contribution to strain
segregation may be associated with recombination events
that may promote genetic variability, as we recently described
[43]. Nevertheless, the high variability of IGRs was surprising, as they commonly involve regulatory regions that are
expected to be conserved; thus, the existence of random
genetic drift may also be considered for IGRs. Finally,
although the HKs are involved in strain segregation, the vast
majority of them showed <50% non-synonymous mutations
(Figure 2b), which is consistent with their role in essential
biological functions.
It is known that in populations without HGT and with bottlenecks, as is the case for C. trachomatis, random genetic drift

Volume 9, Issue 10, Article R153

Nunes et al. R153.9

can play a major role in evolution, being responsible for the
fixation of unfavorable mutations [44]. However, our results
suggest that chlamydial strain segregation according to tropism properties occurred mainly through an adaptive evolutionary process and not through dominant genetic drift.
Several arguments point in this direction: the statistical association found between most polymorphic loci (number of
SNPs/loci and p-distance/loci) and the strain clustering
according to their tissue specificity; Chlamydiae presents a
relatively high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous
changes when compared, for example, to E. coli and Buchnera [26], further supported by our findings where the majority of HPs and CEPs involved in the segregation of the LGV
strains showed >50% non-synonymous SNPs (Figure 2b); for
at least eight loci (CT049, CT144, CT622, pmpE, pmpF,
pmpH, rs2/ompA IGR and ompA/pbpB IGR), we observed a
non-random fixation of SNPs exclusive of same niche-infecting strains (Figure 3), corresponding to specific clusters of
amino acid changes in coding sequences; the extremely
robust global phylogenetic tree with maximum bootstrap
support (99-100%) in the branch nodes where strains are separated by their cell-type/organ specificity (Figure 4); 20 out
of the 22 loci that contribute to the segregation of strains that
preferentially infect the eyes are also involved in the segregation of strains that colonize the lymph nodes (Figure 4) by
presenting a dissimilar and specific SNP pattern; and finally,
the well-known differences in environmental and immune
pressure as well as competing flora and physiological specificities between ocular, epithelial-genital and lymph node tissues.
Within all the loci that are more likely to be involved in the
adaptive evolution to each specific niche, we have found
either highly conserved or polymorphic loci among strains
infecting the same cell-type/organ (Figure 4), where the most
remarkable examples are pmpF and CT049 (see Results). We
hypothesize that pmpF and CT049 may be good representatives of a final stage of the adaptive evolution to the lymph
nodes and the eyes, respectively, considering their extreme
conservation among the corresponding strains. On the other
hand, these genes may be responsible for pathogenic differences among epithelial-genital and LGV strains, respectively,
based on their strong polymorphism among the corresponding strains. While PmpF has been implicated as a potential
target for the host immune response, as it contains several
putative major histocompatibility epitopes [23], biological
information for CT049 is lacking.
Additionally, we found several loci that are polymorphic
among strains infecting the same cell-type/organ that seem
not to have been involved in the adaptation to each niche, but
which may have been involved in the pathogenesis of trachoma, genital infections or LGV disease (Table 3). Indeed, 4
of these loci (CT622, tsf, rs2 and pbpB) belong to a pool of 22
genes that are responsible for profound differences in viru-

lence among two C. trachomatis ocular strains in nonhuman
primates [25].
Interestingly, we also observed a clear evolutionary co-segregation of the two most ecologically successful serovars (E and
F). This is intriguing as there is a 15% difference between
them in the gene coding for the major antigen (the major
outer membrane protein (MOMP)), which constitutes about
60% of the membrane dry-weight [45] and is a putative
cytoadhesin [46]. Although it is not known why serovars E
and F are the most prevalent worldwide, their ecological success seems not to be associated with intracellular multiplication rate [47], indicating that it is likely defined at the host cell
adhesion and entry steps. However, the existence of E/F specific virulence factors or adhesins cannot be addressed in this
study. Even so, tarp is the unique virulence factor that distinguishes serovar E from the other epithelial-genital serovars
(including F), as it presents fewer repeat motifs in the 5'
region [23], but its phenotypic consequences are not known.
Moreover, a more successful host immune evasion could also
be speculated for serovars E and F considering the wellknown different antigenic profile among epithelial-genital
serovars [48].
Regarding the loci that most markedly contribute to the segregation of serovars E and F, we highlight the IGRs tsf, rs2
and rs2/ompA (Figure 4). The first two of these may be
involved in hypothetical differences in strain growth [25],
while the last involves the regulatory region of rs2. This IGR
includes specific domains where most SNPs are exclusive of
strains E and F (Figure 3d), suggesting a potential impact on
the rs2 regulation and, thus, on strain growth. Also, the IGR
rs2/ompA is a recombination hotspot for the generation of
mosaic structures within chlamydial strains [43], suggesting
that recombination may contribute to the ecological success
of the two serovars. However, as most SNPs of the CEPs
involved in the E/F segregation confer amino acid replacements (Figure 2b), we suggest that the positive selection for
the membrane proteins may also be a driving force for the E/
F evolutionary divergence, likely through antigenic variability.

Conclusion

It is not surprising that bacterial populations that evolved in
different ecological niches have different profiles of genetic
variability. However, contrary to all previous reports for other
pathogens focused on HGT events and gene decay, we present
evidence of SNP-based, tissue-specific evolutionary adaptation relying on whole chromosome dynamics, as a consequence of the occurrence of dissimilar arms races between the
pathogen and diverse host organs. Answering the proverbial
question of 'which came first' (tropism or SNPs), the scenario
presented here suggests that while some SNPs, on very few
and specific loci, are likely responsible for tropism differences, the vast majority of SNPs throughout the chromosome

Volume 9, Issue 10, Article R153

Nunes et al. R153.10

are a consequence of different tissue tropisms and are
expected to be involved in maintaining organ appetence, as
per the Red Queen's Hypothesis. Mirroring bacterial virulence [6], we present evidence that a 'one size fits all'
approach cannot be applied to adaptive evolution. This phenomenon is illustrated by a pathogen believed to infect 140
million people, where the incidence rate can be as high as
30% among adolescent females [49]. We believe that grasping a pathogen's genetic trends with regard to its interaction
with the host will be an essential tool in deciphering the
molecular genetic aspects of infectious diseases.

Materials and methods
Culture of C. trachomatis reference strains
We used the most common reference strains representing the
15 C. trachomatis serovars: A/Har13, B/TW5, Ba/Apache2,
C/TW3, D/UW3, E/Bour, F/IC-Cal3, G/UW57, H/UW4, I/
UW12, J/UW36, K/UW31, L1/440, L2/434 and L3/404.
McCoy cell culture of all strains plated in T-25 cm2 flasks was
performed as previously described [50]. At 48-72 h postinfection, elementary bodies were harvested, and DNA was
extracted using QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serovar confirmation of each reference strain was performed
using ompA genotyping with BLAST comparison of the available GenBank sequences.

Selection of loci
A GenBank search was performed to look for genomic regions
that had been sequenced for at least one C. trachomatis reference strain from each of the three disease groups. Up to 93
loci were found, comprising about 84,000 bp of the chromosome, and involving IGRs, HKs, HPs and CEPs. Only nonconstant loci were selected (51 of the 93; Figure 1; Additional
data file 2) for sequencing the other reference strains if their
sequences were not available yet. Automated sequencing was
performed as previously described [28]. The DNA sequence
data have been deposited in a public database ([GenBank:
EU239694-EU239702], [GenBank:EU239705-EU239712],
and [GenBank:EU247618-EU247753]). Primer sequences are
given in Additional data file 5. For all strains, five types of
concatenated sequences were created in a head-to-tail fashion: one for each loci category (IGRs, HKs, HPs and CEPs)
and a global concatenated sequence involving all loci
(approximately 50,000 bp for each taxon).

Polymorphism significance
We used data from the fully sequenced genomes A/Har13 and
D/UW3 for this evaluation. Thus, considering the 3,354 SNPs
identified between these two genomes [23], we evaluated
whether 1,099 SNPs restricted to the 51,074 bp analyzed in
this study are overrepresented relative to the 2,255 SNPs
found in the rest of the chromosome. We framed this as a contingency table (Table 4) with a restricted sequence of
1,519,042 bp for each strain (corresponding to the length of

the D/UW3 chromosome), and we estimated P-values using
the Fisher's exact test as well as the odds ratios with a 95%
confidence interval.

Genomic analysis
For all individual loci and concatenated sequences, alignments of all strains were generated using LaserGene (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA) and MEGA 3.1 [51]. MEGA 3.1 was
also used to create matrices of pairwise comparisons and to
estimate the number of variable sites, the number of parsimony informative sites and overall mean genetic distances.
The pairwise-deletion option was chosen to remove all sites
containing missing data or alignment gaps from all distance
estimations, only when the need arose and not prior to the
analysis.
In order to search for distinct regions that may be associated
with strains belonging to a specific disease group, SimPlot
3.5.1 [52] was used on all 51 loci. For each similarity plot,
serovars were grouped according to the cell-type/organ that
they infect, and nucleotide pairwise distances were calculated
using the K2P method (gaps excluded; ts/tv of 2.0) in a sliding window size of 160 bp moved across the alignment in a
step size of 10 bp. Additionally, for all loci where serovars E
and F clustered apart from the other epithelial-genital serovars was observed, a SimPlot analysis was also performed to
evaluate if the E/F nucleotide differences compared to the
other genital serovars were clustered in specific domains of
each locus.
To evaluate the existence of foreign genetic material [53],
SWAAP 1.0.2 [54] was used to calculate the percentage of GC
content for all sequences of each taxon.

Phylogenetic analysis
Prior to the phylogenetic reconstructions, and in order to
select the appropriate evolutionary models, we evaluated the
homogeneity of substitution patterns between sequences by
calculating the Monte Carlo test-based Disparity Index per
site [55]. This gives the probability of rejecting the null
hypothesis that sequences have evolved with the same pattern
of substitution. The NJ method [56] was used with K2P [57],
Jukes-Cantor [58] and Tamura-Nei [59] models to generate
phylogenies. For the concatenated sequences, in order to
examine the accuracy of the major conclusions reached from
the NJ analysis, trees were also constructed under the maxi-

mum parsimony criterion [60], using the max-min branchand-bound algorithm.
Considering that recombination disturbs a phylogenetic signal since the two parts of the recombined region may have different evolutionary histories [61,62], one locus (ompA) was
excluded from the phylogenetic concatenated analysis, as its
highly recombinant nature has already been demonstrated
[48,63]. The use of outgroup sequences was discarded in the
present study because no rooted trees were needed to achieve
the objectives defined above. Also, the most suitable strain for
use as an outgroup, C. muridarum (MoPn strain), has several
loci that vary greatly in size and diverge from those in the C.
trachomatis strains, which would entail the removal of a huge
portion of the sequences being analyzed.

Evolutionary γ-distance
We used a non-phylogenetic method for estimating the evolutionary distance between each pair of homologous DNA
sequences, which is given by the parameter γ [34]:
γ = -2logeP
where
P = nxy/√nxny
where nxy is the number of nucleotides shared by the two
sequences, and nx and ny are the number of nucleotides of
each sequence. For comparative purposes, we used the same
set of loci as for the phylogenetic concatenated analyses, that
is, we excluded the recombinant ompA gene. The γ variability
was estimated by Monte Carlo using the alignments of each
individual locus through the statistical platform R 2.5.1 [64].
Each time, 20 loci were randomly selected with replacement
and γ-distances were calculated by repeating this procedure
50 times.

Statistical analysis
The statistical association between genetic and phylogenetic
variables was performed using the ANOVA test by comparing
groups' population means. We considered as genetic variables the overall mean values of percent GC content, p-distance and absolute SNPs obtained for each of the selected loci.
The phylogenetic variables were: clustering of strains according to tropism properties; co-segregation of E/F strains; segregation of a LGV cluster or an ocular cluster; and the 'weight'
of each locus in the final concatenated tree. The homogeneity
of variances was tested using the Levene's test. Whenever the
hypothesis of homogeneity of variances was rejected, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare distributions among groups. A P-value of 0.05 or less was considered
significant.
