Extensive intron gain in the ancestor of placental
mammals
Dušan Kordiš

Abstract
Background: Genome-wide studies of intron dynamics in mammalian orthologous genes have found convincing
evidence for loss of introns but very little for intron turnover. Similarly, large-scale analysis of intron dynamics in a
few vertebrate genomes has identified only intron losses and no gains, indicating that intron gain is an extremely
rare event in vertebrate evolution. These studies suggest that the intron-rich genomes of vertebrates do not allow
intron gain. The aim of this study was to search for evidence of de novo intron gain in domesticated genes from
an analysis of their exon/intron structures.
Results: A phylogenomic approach has been used to analyse all domesticated genes in mammals and chordates
that originated from the coding parts of transposable elements. Gain of introns in domesticated genes has been
reconstructed on well established mammalian, vertebrate and chordate phylogenies, and examined as to where
and when the gain events occurred. The locations, sizes and amounts of de novo introns gained in the
domesticated genes during the evolution of mammals and chordates has been analyzed. A significant amount of
intron gain was found only in domesticated genes of placental mammals, where more than 70 cases were
identified. De novo gained introns show clear positional bias, since they are distributed mainly in 5’ UTR and
coding regions, while 3’ UTR introns are very rare. In the coding regions of some domesticated genes up to 8 de
novo gained introns have been found. Intron densities in Eutheria-specific domesticated genes and in older
domesticated genes that originated early in vertebrates are lower than those for normal mammalian and
vertebrate genes. Surprisingly, the majority of intron gains have occurred in the ancestor of placentals.
Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence for numerous intron gains in the ancestor of placental
mammals and demonstrates that adequate taxon sampling is crucial for reconstructing intron evolution. The
findings of this comprehensive study slightly challenge the current view on the evolutionary stasis in intron
dynamics during the last 100 - 200 My. Domesticated genes could constitute an excellent system on which to
analyse the mechanisms of intron gain in placental mammals.
Reviewers: this article was reviewed by Dan Graur, Eugene V. Koonin and Jürgen Brosius.

Background
Spliceosomal introns are one of the major eukaryotespecific genome components, and their evolution has
been studied extensively during the last decade [for
recent reviews see [1-11]]. The availability of numerous
eukaryotic genomes has enabled genome-wide studies of
the intron loss and gain dynamics [reviewed in [2,4,5]
and [12]]. These studies have been limited mostly to
comparisons of intron positions across highly conserved,
orthologous or paralogous genes from often very distant

species. Two main approaches - maximum parsimony
(MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) - have been used
for inferring intron evolution from the patterns of intron
position conservation [reviewed in [4]].
Maximum likelihood reconstruction of intron gain and
loss in eukaryotes has revealed a significant excess of
losses and a nonuniform distribution of gains and losses
[2,4,5,12-14]. A substantial excess of intron gains has
been detected only for those intervals of eukaryotic evolution that are associated with major evolutionary innovations, such as the origin of eukaryotes and animals
[5,12-14]. It appears that intron losses, although rare,
occur at a measurable rate in most eukaryotes

[2,4,12-15] whereas intron gains, at least in the last 100
- 200 Myrs, appear to be restricted to specific taxonomic
groups [5,12-14,16-21]. Overall, many more loss than
gain events have been inferred and documented
[2,4,12-14]. The large-scale comparisons of the evolutionary dynamics of introns have demonstrated surprising evolutionary stasis in the intron dynamics over the
last 100 - 200 My [13,14].
In some large taxonomic groups, such as in vertebrates and especially in mammals, no intron gain was
observed in the genome-wide comparisons [15,22,23].
Large-scale intron studies in orthologous mammalian
genes have indicated that very little intron turnover has
occurred, with convincing evidence only for loss of
introns [15,22]. Similarly, the analysis of a few fish genomes and the fish-mammals comparisons identified only
intron losses and no gains, indicating that intron gain is
an extremely rare event in vertebrate evolution [23].
These genome-wide studies suggest that most of the
introns in the extant vertebrates are likely to be of
ancient origin [15,22-24], and that the intron-rich genomes of vertebrates might not allow intron gain [23].
Such absence of intron gain in »recent« evolutionary
history might be real, but could also be artefactual, the
consequence of inadequate taxon sampling or inadequate comparisons, since only the »old« orthologous
genes have been compared. To test the claims on the
absence of intron gain in some taxonomic groups such
as mammals [15,22] and in recent evolutionary history
(in the last 100 - 200 Mya) [13,14], we need a quite
simple and robust »gene model« that is independent of
the inference procedures about intron gain. If the
ancestral intron state is definitely known, as in the
cases of horizontally transferred bacterial genes into
Entamoeba [25] or of plastid genes into the nuclei of
plants [26], where the ancestral intron state was
intronless, the intron gain can be easily recognized.
Such an approach, coupled with the known ancestral
state (intronless), has been used in this study for evaluation of the hypotheses on the absence of intron
gain in the recent evolutionary past [13,14], and especially in mammals [15,22].
Domesticated genes [27-31], originating from retroelements or from DNA transposons, constitute an ideal
system for testing the hypothesis on the absence of
intron gain in mammals. Since single copy domesticated
genes [29] originated from the intronless multicopy
transposable elements (TEs) [32], the ancestral intron
state for domesticated genes is zero. Therefore, any
intron present in these genes will constitute a de novo
gained intron. The prerequisite for recognizing the origin, extent and timing of de novo gained introns is reliable and wide taxon sampling [33]. In the past few years
a quite large and dense collection of vertebrate, and

Page 2 of 18

especially mammalian, genomes has been accumulated.
For some of these taxa a number of well annotated genomes and genes exist, human and mouse genomes and
transcriptomes being especially useful, with the fulllength mRNAs that enabled reconstructions of the complete gene structures in these species [34,35]. By using
annotated human or mouse introns we can trace their
origin in mammals through genome wide comparisons
of orthologous genes in placentals, marsupials and
monotremes.
In this study a phylogenomic approach [36] has been
used to analyse all domesticated genes in mammals and
chordates that originated from the coding parts of TEs.
The aim was to look for evidence of de novo intron gain
in domesticated genes of mammals from an analysis of
their exon/intron structures. The location, size and
amount of de novo gained introns in domesticated genes
of mammals and chordates have been analyzed. Surprisingly, a burst of intron gain was found only in domesticated genes of placental mammals. De novo gained
introns shows clear positional bias since they are distributed mainly in 5’ UTR and coding regions, and rarely in
3’ UTRs. Up to 8 de novo gained introns have been
found in the coding regions of some domesticated
genes, with intron density of 4 introns per kb. Surprisingly, the majority of intron gains have taken place in
the ancestor of placentals. None of these cases of intron
gain have been observed in any of the previous genomewide analyses [15,22] as a consequence of biased comparisons of a limited number of evolutionarily younger
placental species that belong only to the superorder Boreoeutheria [37-39].

Results
The ancestral intron state in domesticated genes is
known and is intronless

In the majority of previous genome-wide studies of the
intron gain there was a remarkable degree of uncertainty
concerning the ancestral intron states. Single copy
domesticated genes originated from multicopy TEs,
their parts or from their remains [27-31]. Since the TEs
are without introns the ancestral intron state for domesticated genes is known and is intronless. Therefore any
intron found in domesticated genes will have been
gained de novo, either in the coding or untranslated
regions of the gene. An extensive phylogenomic analysis
of all domesticated genes in chordate and mammalian
genomes has therefore been made. The exon/intron
structures of domesticated genes were studied in detail
throughout mammals, vertebrates and chordates. The
most important part of this study was to find the transition point where and when TEs were transformed into
domesticated genes, allowing de novo gain of introns to
be precisely pinpointed in these genes.

Phylogenomic analysis of domesticated genes in
chordates and mammals

The rich collection of numerous mammalian genomes,
belonging to all three major extant mammalian lineages,
Eutheria (placentals), Metatheria (marsupials) and Prototheria (monotremes), is a major advantage in studying
the origin and evolution of domesticated genes. In the
placental mammals, genomes of four superorders
(Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires) are well represented. In addition to the mammalian genomes, all other available vertebrate and chordate
genomes were analyzed in order to find the transition
point from TEs to domesticated genes. Until now only a
few studies of TE-derived domesticated genes have been
published [27-31], but due to the limited availability of
genome data at the time of study, the origin of domesticated genes in the vast majority of cases has remained
unknown.
By the phylogenomic analysis of all available domesticated genes in mammalian, vertebrate and chordate genomes, unequivocal data about their origins (when and in
which taxonomic group they originated) and numerous
gene-related data (exon/intron structure, genome location, chromosomal position etc.) have been obtained.
Crucial information about the transition points from
TEs to domesticated genes has been obtained in this
study. Even more importantly, the gene structures of

domesticated genes has provided direct evidence for
extensive intron gain in placental mammals. An extensive phylogenomic analysis of these genes will be presented elsewhere (Kokosar and Kordis, manuscript in
preparation).
The majority of mammal-specific domesticated genes
contain de novo gained introns

The analysis of all known domesticated genes in chordates and mammals (Additional file 1, Tables 1 and 2)
shows that both retroelement- and DNA transposonderived genes contain introns. In the case of retroelement-derived genes the exon/intron structures are simple, since in these cases the process of gene fusion or
exon shuffling to the pre-existing »normal« genes is
almost always absent (one such exception is the
SCAND3 gene).
However, the situation in the case of DNA transposonderived genes is more complicated, since these genes
can originate by three different routes: a) from the
entire DNA transposon, b) by a complete DNA transposon being fused to the »normal« gene in the form of a
single long exon that is 3’ end located, and c) the most
prevalent case, by gene fusion or exon shuffling of DNA
binding domains (DBD) of DNA transposons with »normal« genes (where the exonization is necessary before
the gene fusion). Therefore, in the case of DNA

transposon-derived genes, intron gain can be recognized
easily only in the first case, while the second and a third
cases are much more difficult for inferring intron gain
in these genes. In the majority of the cases of fused
entire transposases or just the DBDs, the newly
recruited exons remain intact as very long or relatively
short exons, but they are mostly without any intron.
Therefore, in the case of DNA transposon-derived
genes, these fused transposases and DBDs have been
excluded from the analysis of intron gain. Progenitors of
novel domesticated genes were from diverse DNA transposon superfamilies, such as from Tc1/mariner, Transib,
hAT, P-element, PIF/Harbinger and from piggyBac
[29,31].
Of the 36 analyzed orthologous DNA transposonderived genes, only 11 have been used for the inference
and timing of intron gain (POGK, ZBED1, ZNF862,
Buster3, PRKRIR, THAP9, Harbi1, Naif1, PGBD1,
PGBD2 and PGBD5) (Table 1). In these cases the number of newly gained introns varies from 1 to 7, and they
are located in the coding and 5’ UTR regions.

The situation regarding intron gain in retroelementderived genes is definitely much simpler and less problematic, since no fusion genes have originated from retroelements (except SCAND3). 34 orthologous
retroelement-derived genes were analyzed and intron
gain was found in 27 genes (Table 2). Among cases
without intron gain are RTL1 and LDOC1 genes that
originated from the gag gene of chromoviruses
[27,28,40-42]. The number of gained introns in these
cases varies greatly, from 1 to 8, their prevailing locations being 5’ UTR and coding regions, with only three
cases with 3’ UTR locations of gained introns (PNMA5,
RGAG4 and ARC).
The burst of intron gain in domesticated genes was in
the ancestor of placental mammals (Eutheria)

The analysis of all domesticated genes in chordates and
mammals has shown that by far the greatest amount of
intron gain occurred in the ancestor of placentals (Table
3). 20 intron-containing domesticated genes originated
in the ancestor of placentals, 18 of them being

retroelement-derived and only 2 DNA transposonderived genes. Interestingly, a recent study reported that
11 retrogenes with newly gained 5’ UTR introns also
originated in the ancestor of placentals [19]. In the case
of retrogenes they found 18 intron gains, 17 into the 5’
UTR and a single gain in the 3’ UTR. In the case of
domesticated genes, I found 49 to 57 cases of de novo
gained introns in the ancestor of placentals. In retroelement-derived genes 42 to 50 cases of intron gain have
been found, while in DNA transposon-derived genes
only 7 cases were found. Collectively, the 20 domesticated genes and 11 retrogenes provide evidence for at
least 50 to 70 cases of intron gain in the ancestor of placentals. This finding contrasts strongly with previous
studies [15,22], in which no intron gain could be found
in mammals.

Although these genes represent a very small proportion of placental gene innovations, the observed extent
of intron gain most probably represents just the tip of
the iceberg. Regardless of the situation with the normal
mammalian and vertebrate genes (»old genes«), there
was a large scale gene origination in the ancestor of placentals (evolutionarily young genes), at least in some
classes of transcription factors (e.g. in C2H2 ZNFs). To
test the extent of intron gain in some other placentalspecific gene families I analyzed the presence of intron
gain in KRAB and SCAN ZNF genes [43,44], especially
in those orthologous genes that originated in the ancestor of placentals (>150 orthologous genes were analyzed). The analysis shows that the amount of intron
gain in these genes is not as high as in the case of TEderived domesticated genes and retrogenes, but a

Kordiš Biology Direct 2011, 6:59
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/59

Page 6 of 18

number of cases with intron gain can, even so, be recognized. The ancestral state for KRAB-ZNF, SCAN-ZNF
and SCAN-KRAB-ZNF genes can easily be reconstructed, and is 1 intron in the coding region of SCANZNF, 1 - 2 introns in the coding region of KRAB-ZNF
and 2 - 3 in the coding region of SCAN-KRAB-ZNF
genes. In those genes SCAN, KRAB and ZNF domains
are encoded as single exons (or sometimes in two
exons, in KRAB domain only). Therefore any serious
deviations from these numbers of introns in coding
regions most probably represent newly gained introns
(Additional file 2).
Characteristics of de novo gained introns in domesticated
genes: numbers of introns per gene, intron densities,
sizes of introns and preferred locations of de novo gained
introns
a) Numbers of gained introns per gene

The numbers of de novo gained introns in domesticated
genes vary greatly. In the case of DNA transposonderived genes (Table 1), three orthologous genes exist
with a single intron gain, either in the 5’ UTR (ZBED1,
Buster3) or in the coding region (NAIF 1). Two cases
show from 1 to 6 introns per orthologous gene (Rag1
and PGBD1), while the other genes (PRKRIR, Thap9,
POGK, Znf862, PGBD5) show stable numbers of introns
in orthologous genes that range from 4 to 7 gained
introns. In the case of retroelement-derived genes the
variability in the numbers of gained introns is smaller,
with the majority containing 1 to 2 de novo gained
introns in their 5’ UTR or coding regions (Table 2). In
the case of gag-derived genes, the number of gained
introns reaches up to 6 gains per gene at most
(ZCCHC16). In the case of integrase-derived genes, up
to 7 (Gin1) and 8 (NYNRIN) introns have been gained
de novo.
b) Intron densities

They were calculated separately for Eutheria-specific
domesticated genes and for much older domesticated
genes that originated early in vertebrates (Figure 1). A
major difference between these older and younger
domesticated genes is in the position of introns. In
older genes they are located mainly in coding regions,
but in younger genes in 5’ UTRs. In both cases the
intron positions are conserved. The average intron densities for Eutheria-specific domesticated genes are 4.01
intron per kb of 5’ UTR. Intron densities for older
domesticated genes that originated early in vertebrates
(e.g. Gin-1 and PGBD5) are 4.09 intron per kb of CDS.
This comparison shows that intron densities are similar
in domesticated genes, the major difference however,
being in the position of introns. Intron densities in
Eutheria-specific domesticated genes and in older
domesticated genes that originated early in vertebrates

Figure 1 Intron densities in domesticated genes compared
with vertebrate, mammalian and human normal genes. The
intron density is given as the number of introns per kb of coding
sequence for vertebrate, mammalian and human normal genes,
values were taken from literature [13]. The intron density of old
domesticated genes is given as the number of introns per kb of
coding sequence (introns in CDS) while the intron density of young
Eutheria-specific domesticated genes is given as number of introns
per kb of 5’ UTR sequence (5’ UTR introns).

are therefore lower than the intron densities for normal
mammalian and vertebrate genes [13,14].
c) Size of introns per gene

The sizes of the gained introns in domesticated genes
are highly variable (Additional file 3). They mostly range
from a few hundred to a few thousand base pairs. DNA
transposon-derived genes contain longer introns than
retroelement-derived genes - it is also evident that older
domesticated genes (e.g. originating in the ancestor of
chordates) contain much longer introns than evolutionarily younger domesticated genes that originated in the
ancestor of placentals. Surprisingly, the longest introns
exist in the gag-derived ZCCHC16 gene. The human
ZCCHC16 gene contains two introns, the first of 47.8
kb and the second of 323.3 kb. Both introns are located
in the 5’ UTR region. In the mouse genome, this gene
contains 6 introns, where they are again located in the
5’ UTR. The second intron in the mouse ZCCHC16
gene is also the longest intron observed in the chordate
domesticated genes, being longer than 410 kb. This
gene resembles the mammalian retrogenes with very
long introns that are restricted to the 5’ UTRs [19].
d) Preferred locations of de novo gained introns

In all the orthologous domesticated genes analyzed, the
preferred locations of de novo gained introns are the 5’
UTRs and the coding region, while newly gained introns
in the 3’ UTR locations are very rare (Tables 1 and 2).
These preferred intron locations are similar to those in
the »normal« chordate genes [45]. However, the

Kordiš Biology Direct 2011, 6:59
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/59

Page 7 of 18

preferred locations of de novo gained introns in domesticated genes differ from the recently reported case of
mammalian retrogenes, in which newly gained introns
are located preferentially in the 5’ UTRs [19].
Intron positions in domesticated genes are highly
conserved

The extensive data on intron position conservation (Additional file 4) has been collected from the genomic alignments for all placental-specific intron gains. Such an
approach has the advantage over the presentation in a
table or figure, since one can readily see the genes and
their exons and introns compared at the nucleotide level
over quite large evolutionary distances (at least 80 - 100
Myr) and, what is surprising, to see the remarkable level of
conservation at the nucleotide level. The human orthologous gene was always aligned with at least one representative of the placental superorders Afrotheria, Xenarthra,
Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires. In such a way a
direct insight into the extent of conserved intron positions
can be seen as well as in the several cases of highly conserved introns. Genomic alignments have shown that the
vast majority of intron positions in placental-specific
domesticated genes are highly conserved. All or the vast
majority of gained introns in domesticated genes have
been fixed in the eutherian ancestor, as demonstrated by
their presence and sequence conservation in all eutherian
superorders (Additional file 4, Table 4).
Alternative splicing in domesticated genes

In the ASTD database (Alternative Splicing and Transcript Diversity 1.1) [46] I have checked all domesticated

genes for the presence of alternative splicing and several
examples have been found (Table 5). It is interesting
that DNA transposon-derived genes possess a larger
amount of alternative splicing than the retroelementderived genes. In some genes (e.g. in the human
PNMA2 gene) up to 14 alternative splicing events have
been documented in the ASTD database. It is interesting
that the majority of these alternative splicing events are
found in humans. Alternative splicing events can be
traced only in a limited number of mammals (human,
mouse and rat), since for any other placental lineage no
data are available. There are many possible causes of
alternative splicing events, from weaker splicing sites to
diverse intronic and exonic splicing silencers or enhancers [47]. It has been demonstrated that Alu SINEs can
generate alternative splicing in humans [48]. Since most
of the alternative splicing events in domesticated genes
are limited to humans the involvement of Alu SINEs is
among the most interesting possibilities. The presence
of alternative splicing events in humans indicates that
these events might be quite recent. Genomic alignments
of orthologous genes can provide the precise timing of
these events (Additional file 5). In the case of PNMA2
gene such data has shown that the intron containing
several Alu repeats is highly conserved in Simiiformes,
but not in the tarsiers or prosimians. Alternative splicing
has also been included in the intronization model of
intron gain [6,7], however, this model does not appear
to explain the observed situation. Although the gained

indicate very recent, and probably regulatory, adaptations in the human or primate lineages.
Ongoing gain and loss of introns in domesticated genes:
evidence from comparative genomics of mammals

The availability of RefSeq genes [34,35] and numerous
mammalian genomes (at NCBI WGS site and at the
Ensemble site) has enabled the conservation of intron
positions and numbers to be analyzed. Even comparison
of the well studied genomes of human and mouse has
shown differences in the locations (5’ UTR or coding
regions), sizes and numbers of introns in orthologous
genes (Additional file 6). Some older orthologous genes
(e.g. Gin1, PGBD5), show stable numbers of introns per
gene throughout chordates, and only the intron sizes
differ greatly between orthologues. In contrast, evolutionarily much younger placental-specific domesticated
genes show diversity in the numbers and positions of
introns in orthologous genes (Additional file 6). This
indicates that some introns have not been fixed yet, or
that the intron gain was more active in some species.
Comparative genome data therefore provides evidence
for ongoing gain and loss of introns in domesticated
genes of placental mammals. For example, while human
ZCCHC16 gene contains two introns, the same gene
contains 6 introns in the mouse genome.
Sequences of de novo gained introns are highly
conserved in placental mammals

Although the positions of many introns are highly conserved in evolution, their sizes and nucleotide sequences
are generally not conserved. I examined whether de
novo gained introns were evolutionarily conserved in
mammals. The intron sequences of all human domesticated genes were compared to sequences obtained from
WGS genomic sequences from the representatives of all
placental superorders. Surprisingly, intron sequences
were highly conserved between human and Afrotheria
in only 9 out of 19 retroelement-derived genes, showing
an overall conservation of 70 - 75% between the representatives of all four superorders of placental mammals
analyzed (Additional file 7). These genes are RGAG1,
ZCCHC16, ZCCHC5, RGAG4, ZCCHC12, PEG10,
LDOC1L, PNMA2, and PNMAL1. The first five are
located on the X chromosome, while the others are
autosomal genes. To find out whether such conservation
is restricted to de novo gained introns alone, the
sequence conservation of the entire domesticated genes
between humans and representatives of all placental
superorders has been examined. In addition to the conserved de novo gained introns, a high level of sequence
consevation in the whole domesticated genes has been
found. The analysis of intron conservation in other randomly selected genes indicates that intron sequences

Page 8 of 18

between humans and the representatives of all placental
superorders may be more highly conserved than generally acknowledged (Additional file 7).
Lineage-specific enrichment of intron sequences with TEs
in diverse placental superorders

Searching for TEs in the long introns with RepeatMasker has shown the presence of species-specific repeats in
the analyzed species (Additional file 8). Up to 50% of
the intron sizes can be occupied by diverse TEs. Different species of placental mammals (e.g. human, mouse,
cow, elephant and sloth) show unique lineage- or species-specific TE content in these introns. This finding
indicates that these TEs have been inserted in the particular lineages (e.g. Afrotheria, Laurasiatheria, Rodentia,
Primates, etc.). It is evident that the majority of intron
origination events in domesticated genes have occurred
in the eutherian ancestor, but that they were later independently bombarded with lineage-specific TEs in all
three eutherian sister groups Afrotheria, Xenarthra and
Boreoeutheria. Independent TE bombardment of introns
occurred also inside Boreoeutheria, as evidenced by the
large differences in TE repertoires in these introns
between Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires, as well as
between rodents and primates.
The number of de novo gained introns in domesticated
genes is among the highest in eukaryotes

The analysis of placental-specific domesticated genes,
retrogenes and placental-specific transcription factors
(~200 were analyzed) has shown that numerous intron
gains occurred in the ancestor of placentals and that
intron gain is still ongoing in mammals. At least 50 - 70
cases of intron gain can be documented from the analysis of >30 domesticated genes and retrogenes, and a few
more cases can be documented also for placental-specific transcription factors (KRAB-ZNFs, SCAN-ZNFs and
SCAN-KRAB-ZNFs). Up to 100 cases of intron gain are
recognized from the analysis of ~200 orthologous genes.
These intron gains have occurred at different time
points of placental evolution, the vast majority of them
in the ancestor of placentals and the others in diverse
lineages or species of placental mammals.

Discussion
This study provides clear evidence for extensive intron
gain in the ancestor of placental mammals. Vertebrate,
and especially mammalian, genomes contain a number
of genes that have originated from transposable elements (TEs) or their remains [27-31]. Since vertebrate
retroelements and DNA transposons do not contain
introns [32], the ancestral state for TE-derived genes is
intronless. During the transition process from a multicopy TE to the single copy domesticated gene, intron

Kordiš Biology Direct 2011, 6:59
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/59

gain can occur, meaning that any intron present in the
domesticated gene will constitute a de novo intron gain.
The availability of numerous mammalian and vertebrate
genomes was crucial for tracing the origin of these
genes, the origin of specific exon/intron structures and
for determining the extent of intron gain.
It has been shown that intron losses outnumber intron
gains in eukaryotic orthologous genes [13,14]. Genomewide comparisons of closely related species in numerous
intron-rich lineages have shown that recent intron gains
are indeed very rare [13,14,16,25]. Comparison of orthologous genes from mammalian genomes failed to reveal
any gains at all, suggesting that all introns currently
contained in mammalian genes were already present at
the time of radiation of mammalian orders [15,22].
However, in contrast to previous observations, this
study has demonstrated (based on the analysis of >200
orthologous genes) quite extensive intron gain, mainly
in the ancestor of placental mammals. The placental
mammals can therefore now be added to the list of
taxonomic groups with significant amounts of intron
gain arising in the relatively recent evolutionary past
(100 - 200 Mya).
Rates of intron gain in the past tens to hundreds of
million years in diverse eukaryotes have been very low
[4,12-14]. Studies of closely related species have shown
that diverse eukaryotic lineages experienced surprisingly
few intron gains in this period [reviewed in [4] and 12].
The highest rate of recent intron gain yet observed in
genome-wide ortholog comparisons was in Oikopleura,
where 4260 newly acquired introns have been detected
[49]. As this study shows, the extent of intron gain in
chordate, lower vertebrate, amniote, mammalian and
therian ancestors has been much smaller. The domesticated genes have finally provided evidence for the
numerous intron gains in the ancestor of placental
mammals, more than 160 My ago [50,51]. At least 50 100 cases of intron gain have been observed in this
ancestor. This extent of de novo gained introns is similar
to that reported in diverse eukaryotic lineages
[12,16,17,20]. The comparative genomics of eutherian
domesticated genes show differences in the numbers of
introns, indicating that intron gain is still ongoing.
An extensive phylogenomic analysis of all the domesticated genes in chordate and mammalian genomes has
provided crucial information as to where and when TEs
were transformed into domesticated genes, allowing de
novo gain of introns in these genes to be pinpointed
precisely. The number of gained introns in these genes
varies greatly, from 1 to 8. Domesticated genes in placentals and chordates accumulated a large number of
introns, such that their density in these genes has
become close to that in »normal« genes [10]. The average intron density for Eutheria-specific domesticated

Page 9 of 18

genes is 4.01 intron per kb of 5’ UTR. Intron density for
older domesticated genes that originated early in vertebrates (e.g. Gin-1 and PGBD5) is 4.09 intron per kb of
CDS. This comparison indicates that intron densities are
similar in domesticated genes, the major difference however being in their position. Intron densities in Eutheriaspecific domesticated genes and in older domesticated
genes that originated early in vertebrates are therefore
lower than those for normal mammalian and vertebrate
genes [13,14]. The emerging pattern of evolution of
eukaryote gene architecture is simple: whenever an
intronless gene is added to an intron-rich genome via
any route, it is rather quickly saturated by introns until
an intron density close to that in “old” genes is reached.
In this respect the results of this work extend and generalize the previous observations on chloroplast-derived
genes in plants [26]. The selective and/or neutral factors
affecting this saturating insertion of introns remain
unknown and appears to be of great interest, as are the
molecular mechanisms of intron insertion.
The sizes of the gained introns in domesticated genes
are highly variable, ranging from a few hundred to a few
thousand base pairs. DNA transposon-derived genes
contain longer introns than retroelement-derived genes,
just as evolutionarily older domesticated genes contain
much longer introns than evolutionarily younger domesticated genes. Surprisingly, the longest introns exist in
the gag-derived ZCCHC16 gene, and the second intron
in the mouse (~410 kb long) is also the longest intron
in the chordate domesticated genes. This gene resembles
mammalian retrogenes with very long introns [19]. The
preferred locations of de novo gained introns in domesticated genes are the 5’ UTRs and coding regions, while
3’ UTR locations are very rare. These preferred intron
locations are similar to those of the »normal« chordate
genes [45]. However, the preferred locations of de novo
gained introns in domesticated genes differ from the
recently reported case of mammalian retrogenes, where
newly gained introns are preferentially located in the 5’
UTRs [19].
The extensive information on intron position conservation collected from the genomic alignments for all
placental-specific intron gains has shown that the great
majority of intron positions in placental-specific domesticated genes are highly conserved. The great majority of
gained introns in domesticated genes have been fixed in
the eutherian ancestor, as demonstrated by their presence and sequence conservation in all eutherian superorders. From the genomic alignments we can readily
trace the genes and their exons and introns compared at
the nucleotide level over quite large evolutionary distances (at least 80 - 100 Myr) and, what is surprising,
see remarkable level of conservation at the nucleotide
level.

Kordiš Biology Direct 2011, 6:59
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/59

The rate of sequence divergence in introns is very
high, therefore many introns are less conserved in
sequence between organisms than their associated exons
[4,52]. The sequence conservation of de novo gained
introns has been analyzed, and a striking conservation
of the intron sequences in their entire length was found
in 9 out of 19 retroelement-derived domesticated genes,
showing 70 - 75% nucleotide identity between humans
and Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Laurasiatheria. Comparison of the entire domesticated genes between human
and the representatives of all placental superorders also
shows ~75% nucleotide identity between humans and
Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Laurasiatheria. Conservation
of intronic sequences has been observed in some other
Boreoeutheria genes [52], however only several short
regions were shown to be highly conserved. Most of the
unusually conserved introns are located in the 5’ UTR
regions. It is possible that some of these introns are so
highly conserved because they may have some conserved
regulatory role in enhancing expression, in mRNA localization, stability or efficiency of translation [47,53]. It
has been demonstrated that some of the domesticated
genes are evolving under negative selection [27], therefore the level of unusual conservation is not limited to
the exons but may also include the introns. Some of
these genes are located on the X chromosomes, which
may cause unusual patterns of evolution, such as lower
mutation rates than on the autosomes [54]. The mutation rate on human X chromosome is indeed low and
X-linked genes evolving mainly under negative selection
are therefore evolving slowly [54,55]. The analysis of
intron conservation in other randomly selected genes
indicates that intron sequences in all placental superorders may be more highly conserved than is generally
acknowledged. Such a high level of conservation of
intron sequences may reflect their functional significance for the expression and regulation of domesticated
and some other genes [47,53].
The analysis of domesticated genes in ASTD database
has shown the presence of alternative splicing. Up to 14
alternative splicing events can be seen per domesticated
gene. It is interesting that more alternative splicing
events can be seen in human than in mouse orthologous
genes. Alternative splicing in domesticated genes may
have originated by mutations in splicing sites (evolution
of weaker splice sites), by sequence changes in the intronic and exonic splicing silencers or enhancers (generating lower or higher densities) or by accumulation of Alu
SINEs that can change the mode of splicing of the
flanking exons [47,48]. Comparison of the orthologous
introns in placental superorders has shown the presence
of species- or lineage-specific enrichment of TEs and
highly dynamic evolution of TE content in placental
mammals. These findings indicate that introns in each

Page 10 of 18

species are under constant bombardment with TEs
[56,57]. By such accumulation of lineage-specific SINEs
they may influence the alternative splicing of the flanking exons in some species [47,48].
The presence of ~100 intron gains in placental mammals is remarkable, and clearly represents just the tip of
the iceberg, the number of de novo gained introns in the
ancestor of placental mammals probably being much
higher. This study pointed to the serious problems arising from comparison of orthologous introns in coding
regions only and from sparse taxon sampling in the genome-wide analyses of intron gain [15,22,23]. None of the
cases reported here were observed in the previous studies
of closely related (human, mouse, rat and dog as an outgroup) [15] or distantly related (fish vs mammals) species
[23]. In the closely related mammalian species analyzed
[15,22] intron gains occurred before those species originated. In comparisons of distantly related vertebrate species [23] only »old« orthologous genes have been
compared, and evolutionary novelties were excluded
from such analyses, however the neglected intron gains
occurred after the analyzed species originated. Therefore,
as this study shows, the overall extent of intron gain in
eukaryotes could be much higher than reported in previous studies. The solution to the above problems is to
analyse the highly neglected evolutionary gene novelties
at particular time points (like in the ancestor of placentals). This study provides a further cautionary example in
using only closely or distantly related species and sophisticated statistical methods in directionalizing intron loss/
gain events, and underscores the importance of using
appropriately selected taxa and evolutionary gene novelties for accurate inferences of genome evolution. All
future studies of intron dynamics should be made in a
correct taxonomic context in order to infer the real
extent of intron gain during eukaryotic evolution.
To obtain a genome-wide insight into the extent of
intron gain in placental mammals, highly accurate exon/
intron structures (including 5’ UTR, with 5’ UTR
introns) of genes from marsupials and platypus are
needed, as well as from the key Afrotheria (African
mammals) and Xenarthra (South American mammals)
species. The major problem in comparative genomics of
mammals is the quality of sequence data for just 2×
genome covered species [58]. Therefore, for the large
scale genome-wide based analysis of intron gain in
mammals, the key basal placental taxa should be compared with the marsupials and platypus. Such data could
provide a definitive answer to the real extent of intron
gain in placental mammals.

Conclusions
The first evidence for intron gain in the ancestor of placental mammals has been provided. A phylogenomic

Kordiš Biology Direct 2011, 6:59
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/59

analysis of domesticated genes in mammals and chordates has provided evidence for de novo intron gain
from the analysis of their exon/intron structures. De
novo gained introns show clear positional bias, since
they are distributed mainly in 5’ UTR and coding
regions, while 3’ UTR located introns are very rare.
Large numbers of de novo gained introns have been
found in the coding regions of some domesticated
genes, reaching as many as 8 introns per gene. Surprisingly, the majority of intron gains have occurred in the
ancestor of placentals, more than 160 Mya. None of
these cases of intron gain were observed in earlier genome-wide analyses of limited numbers of evolutionarily
younger placental species. All previous claims for the
absence of intron gain in mammals, or in the last 100 200 My of eukaryotic evolution, were the consequence
of inadequate taxon sampling and the comparison of
only the »old« orthologous genes. Thus, as this study
has demonstrated, adequate taxon sampling is crucial
for the reconstruction of intron dynamics and evolution.

Methods
Data mining

The databases analyzed were the Ensembl http://www.
ensembl.org and the nonredundant (NR), EST, GSS,
HTGS, WGS, as well as the diverse taxon-specific
(mammalian, chordate and metazoan) genome databases
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Comparisons were
performed using the diverse BLAST tools [59] with the
E-value cutoff set to 10 -5 and other parameters to
default settings. Domesticated genes, as well as diverse
gag, integrase and transposase domains, have been used
as queries. DNA sequences were translated using the
Translate program http://www.expasy.org/tools/dna.
html. The reference set of human representatives of the
domesticated genes is available in Additional file 1.
Orthologs of domesticated genes were identified in
Ensembl and WGS.
Phylogenomic analysis of domesticated genes and
establishment of their exon/intron structures

The locations, sizes and numbers of de novo gained
introns in domesticated genes of mammals and chordates have been analyzed. The availability of RefSeq
genes [34,35] and numerous mammalian genomes (at
the Ensembl and the NCBI WGS sites) has enabled the
conservation of intron sequences, positions and numbers to be analyzed. The use of annotated human or
mouse introns has enabled their origin in mammals to
be traced by genome-wide comparisons of orthologous
genes in placentals, marsupials and monotremes. The
comparison of orthologous human and mouse genes has

Page 11 of 18

shown differences in the locations (5’ UTR or coding
regions), sizes and numbers of introns.
Phylogenetic analysis

All the nonredundant representatives of the gag-, integrase- and DNA-transposon-derived domesticated genes
have been included in the analyses. Protein or nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W2 [60]. All
the available correction models were tested, but the
complex ones were outperformed by the simple correction models. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
using the neighbor-joining (NJ) [61] and maximum likelihood (ML) methods [62]. The reliability of the resulting topologies was evaluated by 1000 bootstrap
replications. Diverse representatives of the Metaviridae
and DNA transposases were used as outgroups. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the programs
MEGA5 [63] and PhyML 3.0 [62].
Conservation of intron positions

The extensive information on intron position conservation has been collected from the Ensembl genomic
alignments for all placental-specific intron gains. By this
approach the genes and their exons and introns can be
compared at the nucleotide level over quite large evolutionary distances (at least 80 - 100 Myr) and a remarkable level of conservation at the nucleotide level can be
demonstrated. The human orthologous gene was always
aligned with at least one representative of the placental
superorders Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria and
Euarchontoglires. The intron density of a gene is given
as the number of introns per kb of coding sequence
(introns in CDS) or as number of introns per kb of 5’
UTR sequence (5’ UTR introns).
Alternative splicing in domesticated genes

All domesticated genes have been checked in the ASTD
database (Alternative Splicing and Transcript Diversity
1.1) [46] for the presence of alternative splicing. Alternative splicing events can be traced only in a limited number of mammals (human, mouse and rat); no data are
available for any other placental lineage.
Lineage-specific enrichment of intron sequences with TEs
in diverse placental superorders

TE content was analyzed using the RepeatMasker web
site http://www.repeatmasker.org[64].

Reviewer report 2

Eugene V. Koonin, NCBI, NLM, NIH, United States of
America
Kordiš reports apparent gain of a large number of
introns in “young” vertebrate genes, primarily in genes
that evolved from domesticated transposable elements.
A burst of intron insertion is mapped to the origin of
placental mammals. Clearly, this is a very interesting
and important finding that runs against the numerous
published observations of the (near) lack of intron gain
throughout the evolution of mammals or even the evolution of vertebrates.
Author’s response: I agree with the above statement.
However, the “refutation” of the intron stasis scenario
should be taken in perspective. This entire study
involves approximately 200 “young” genes, and not all of
them have gained many introns. However interesting,
this finding pertains to a small fraction of genes in any
given animal genome, so quantitatively this is a small
correction to the stasis picture. There is no need to
over-dramatize the revision of the existing views. This is
not to deny the importance of the result. To me, the
emerging pattern of evolution of eukaryote gene architecture is simple: whenever an intron-less gene is added
to an intron-rich genome via any route, it is rather
quickly saturated by introns until intron density close to
that in “old” genes is reached. In this respect the results
of this work extend and generalize the previous observations on chloroplast-derived genes in plants (Ref. 26)
The selective and/or neutral factors affecting this saturating insertion of introns remain unknown and seem to
be of great interest, and so are the molecular mechanisms of intron insertion. One has to agree with the
author of the article that domesticated genes are an
excellent model to study these fascinating and fundamental problems.
Author’s response: I really don’t like to refute your
intron stasis scenario and to overdramatize the revision
of the existing views about the extent of intron gain. As
this study pointed out, in the previous genome-wide analyses of intron gain (e.g. in mammals or in vertebrates)
the serious problem was the comparison of orthologous
introns in coding regions only and the sparse taxon sampling. None of the cases reported here were observed in
the previous studies of closely related (human, mouse,
rat and dog as an outgroup) or distantly related species
(fish vs mammals). In the closely related mammalian
species analysed, intron gains occurred before those species originated. In comparisons of distantly related vertebrate species only »old« orthologous genes have been
compared, and evolutionary novelties were excluded
from such analyses, however the neglected intron gains
occurred after the analysed species originated. Therefore,
as this study shows, the overall extent of intron gain

Page 12 of 18

could be much higher than reported in previous studies.
As this study demonstrated, the solution to the above
problems is to analyse the highly neglected evolutionary
gene novelties at particular time points (like here, in the
ancestor of placentals). This study therefore provides a
further cautionary example in using only closely or distantly related species and sophisticated statistical methods in directionalizing intron loss/gain events, and
underscores the importance of using appropriately
selected taxa and evolutionary gene novelties for accurate inferences of genome evolution.
The article as it stands now presents many omissions
and lost opportunities some of which seem to be a must
for revision whereas others are extensions of the work
done that perhaps could be postponed until subsequent
publications. Here are several specific areas where the
submitted manuscript appears to be amiss. The information on intron position conservation probably should be
much more detailed and specific and should be presented in the main paper not in an additional file, probably in the form of a table or figure.
Author’s response: As requested I have added the
extensive information on intron position conservation in
a large supplementary file that contains genomic alignments for all placental-specific intron gains. This has the
advantage over presentation in a table or figure, since
one can readily see the genes and their exons and introns
compared at the nucleotide level over quite large evolutionary distances (at least 80 -100 million years) and,
what is surprising, see the remarkable level of conservation at the nucleotide level. The human gene is always
aligned with at least one representative of the placental
superorders Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria and
Euarchontoglires. In this way a direct insight into the
extent of conserved intron positions can be seen, as well
as the several cases of highly conserved introns. It should
be noted that most of the mammalian genomes are now
available as low-coverage (~2×) assemblies. Sequencing
errors in some of these genomes can still have surprising
effects for apparent lineage-specific insertions of introns.
A careful reinspection of such a data is always needed to
exclude sequencing errors.
The inferred number of gained introns should be
given specifically, claiming a “remarkable number” is not
enough.
Author’s response: This suggestion is accepted and the
inferred numbers of gained introns are now given
specifically.
In the same vein, I believe that specific numbers
should be presented on intron densities in the domesticated genes (per kilobase not per gene) and compared
to the intron densities in other genes.
Author’s response: I calculated intron densities for all
Eutheria-specific intron gains as well as for some cases of

Kordiš Biology Direct 2011, 6:59
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/59

older intron gains that occurred during the evolution of
vertebrates. I also compared these data with the intron
densities in other genes. The requested figure showing the
histograms of intron densities in gained introns compared to other genes has been added to the MS.
Further, it is unclear to me why not performing a formal, maximum-likelihood reconstruction of the history
of intron gains and losses in the analyzed genes; this
can be easily done using the COUNT software (Csurös
M. Count: evolutionary analysis of phylogenetic profiles
with parsimony and likelihood. Bioinformatics. 2010
Aug 1;26(15):1910-2). Such a reconstruction would yield
a more robust and more informative evolutionary
scenario.
Author’s response: I have added genomic alignments
for all placental-specific intron gains. These data clearly
demonstrate that the massive intron gain has occurred
only at the particular time point, namely in the ancestor
of placental mammals. The numbers of additional intron
gains or losses are indeed very small and are restricted
to the particular species or to the small taxonomic
groups. Therefore maximum likelihood analysis was not
practical because of the small number of potential intron
gains and losses.
This suggestion also brings up the issue of illustration.
The current manuscript contains no figures which is
strange considering the subject. For example, it is easy
to imagine a figure showing the phylogenetic tree of vertebrates with the ML estimates of intron gains and
losses in the analyzed genes mapped to specific
branches.
Author’s response: I know that it is strange that the
current version of manuscript contained no figures. As
explained above the requested phylogenetic tree of vertebrates with the ML estimates of intron gains and losses
in the analyzed genes mapped to specific branches was
not practical because of the small number of potential
intron gains and losses. This MS clearly demonstrates
that the only case of massive intron gain in the domesticated genes occurred only at one particular time point,
namely in the ancestor of placental mammals. However,
outside this evolutionary time point the additional intron
gains or losses are very small and are restricted to particular species or to small taxonomic groups.
Other figures are easy to come up with as well, for
example, histograms of intron densities. Some interesting possibilities are not pursued at all, e.g. comparing
the structures of the splice sites for the new and older
introns.
Author’s response: The requested figure showing the
histograms of intron densities in gained introns compared to those in other genes has been added to the MS.
Intron densities are indeed not as high as in the typical
mammalian genes, but still they are remarkable with 4

Page 13 of 18

introns/kb of exonic sequence. I checked also the structure of the splice sites for the new and older introns but
no differences in the conservation of splicing signals can
be found, as already reported for some other cases of
intron gains. All gained introns use canonical splice sites
without any deviations.
Also, do any of these genes undergo alternative splicing? Knowing this could provide a clue to the evolutionary factors behind intron saturation.
Author’s response: In the ASTD database (Alternative
Splicing and Transcript Diversity 1.1) I checked all
domesticated genes for the presence of alternative splicing
and found several examples of alternative splicing. It is
interesting that larger amounts of alternative splicing are
observed in DNA transposon-derived genes than in the
retroelement-derived genes. In some genes (e.g. human
PNMA2 gene) up to 14 alternative splicing events have
been documented in the ASTD database. It is interesting
that the majority of these alternative splicing events can
be found only in humans but not in mouse. Alternative
splicing events can be traced only in a limited number of
mammals (human, mouse and rat) - no data are available for any other placental lineage. There are numerous
possible causes of alternative splicing events, from the
intronic silencers or enhancers, exonic silencers or enhancers, to the diverse repetitive elements. In humans, it has
been demonstrated that Alu SINEs can generate alternative splicing. Since most of the alternative splicing events
are limited to humans the involvement of Alu SINEs is
among the most interesting possibilities. The presence of
alternative splicing events exclusively in humans indicates that these events are indeed quite recent, but the
absence of comparative data cannot provide their precise
timing. However, since human and mouse belong to the
same eutherian superorder Euarchontoglires, the timing
of these events can be more restricted to the primates or
to the younger lineages within primates (e.g. to Hominoidea). Alternative splicing has also been implied in the
intronization model of intron gain, however, I believe
that this model cannot explain the observed situation. As
is evident, all (or the vast majority) of gained introns in
domesticated genes have been fixed in the eutherian
ancestor, as demonstrated by their presence and
sequence conservation in all eutherian superorders. But
the alternative splicing events can be found, in the
majority of cases, only in humans. This may indicate
very recent, probably regulatory, adaptation in the
human lineage.
Finally, I find the conservation of the actual sequences
of introns illustrated in Additional File 8 extremely
unexpected, almost to the extent of being shocking. A
more careful discussion of this finding in light of the
current knowledge of the rates of neutral sequence evolution seems necessary.

Author’s response: The requested discussion of the conservation of the intron sequences has been added to the

Reviewer report 3

Jürgen Brosius, University of Muenster, Germany
This is an interesting approach towards detection of
relatively novel events of intron generation. The author
is using genes that were derived from, by nature intronless, transposable DNA elements or transposed retroelements. This has the advantage that events that occurred
over the past 100 to 200 million years could be detected.
My main problem with the current version is the terminology of intron gain. Looking at the events, it turns out
that in many cases no novel sequences actually were
gained but existing sequences converted to introns. Perhaps the term intronization would fit better and I would
recommend the author to search PubMed using that
term. There are 10 matches and the first use of the
term intronization is from Gromoll et al. (2007). The
paper merely describes the disuse of one of the exons in
the LH receptor type I and type II genes. A second early
and relevant paper describes an Alu element induced
intronization and could be cited as well (Sela et al.
2007).
Author’s response: From the literature data we can
only see a few cases of intronized sequence in the normal
gene that already contained introns (Irimia M, Rukov JL,
Penny D, Vinther J, Garcia-Fernandez J, Roy SW. Origin
of introns by ‘intronization’ of exonic sequences. Trends
Genet. 2008 24:378-81.; Roy SW. Intronization, de-intronization and intron sliding are rare in Cryptococcus.
BMC Evol Biol. 2009 9:192). All such introns were quite
short (~50 bp) in both Caenorhabditis (Irimia et al.,
2008) and Cryptococcus (Roy 2009). For me it is highly
unlikely that several quite long introns in domesticated
genes have been generated by the intronization of coding
sequences. The main reasons for this are the sizes of the
ancestral gag and integrase domains, which are in the
range of 250-400 amino acids. The sizes of the domesticated genes are in the range from ~100 (contraction) to
~2000 (expansion) amino acids. Therefore it is highly
unlikely that existing sequences have been converted to
introns in domesticated genes. It was estimated recently
(Roy 2009) that intronization may not be a major overall
contributor to modern day gene structures and that
intronization is unlikely to explain a large fraction of
modern introns. I think that nonsense-mediated decay
(NMD) is the more likely mechanism to enable intron
gain.
In several parts of the manuscript the author mentions
a “significant amount of intron gain” or the “remarkable
number of de novo gained introns etc. This is relative

Page 14 of 18

and it would be better to provide at least approximate
numbers instead.
Author’s response: This suggestion is accepted and most
cases were changed into the approximate numbers.
At the end of the background section the author mentions studies restricted to the superorder Boreoeutheria.
The original publication concerning the classification is
Springer et al. (2001).
Author’s response: This suggestion is accepted and the
original citation has been added to the MS.
How can the author rule out that young genes with
introns in fact encode non-protein coding RNAs that
acquired introns or simply feature insertions that are
not being removed by splicing? It would be useful to
provide information on how many of the transcripts are
supported by bona fide messenger RNAs, or at least
ESTs, or even better by protein sequence data. In additional file 4 entitled “ongoing gain and loss of introns in
domesticated genes” I detect very little information concerning messenger RNAs; one of the few examples
where such information is given, refers to the
ZCCHC16 gene.
Author’s response: All these domesticated genes are
protein coding genes and a few may also encode non-protein coding RNAs. Domesticated genes are also highly
expressed in particular tissues (e.g. placenta, brain, testis,
etc.). Rich collections of EST/expression profiles for all
these genes are present in the literature as well as in the
NCBI Genes section, at the Gene Expression Atlas and in
many additional transcriptomic databases. In any case,
for the annotation of the well covered taxa (such as
human and mouse) numerous ESTs and cDNAs exist
and helped before in establishing their exon/intron structures at the Ensembl and NCBI Genes as well as for the
recognition of some cases of alternative splicing events.
The frequently mentioned fact that novel introns can
be quite large is not surprising. Once an intron had
been generated, the floodgates are open for constant
bombardment with transposed elements (Brosius, 1999)
potentially increasing the sizes of such introns to a great
extent over the past 100 to 200 million years.
Author’s response: I agree with this statement. Some of
the gained introns are indeed large or even huge. I
checked the TE repertoires of some of these introns in different species by RepeatMasker. Up to 50% of the intron
size can be occupied by diverse TEs. Different species of
placental mammals (e.g. human, mouse, cow, elephant
and sloth) shows unique lineage- or species-specific TE
content in these introns. This finding indicates that
introns in each species are indeed under constant bombardment with TEs.
In general, it would be interesting to obtain information as to the origin of the sequences that now are

Kordiš Biology Direct 2011, 6:59
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/59

being used as introns. My guess is that most of the
sequences will be derived from pre-existing sequences at
the corresponding loci previously serving as exons or
intergenic regions. As mentioned above, one would
expect additional TEs that were inserted after the initial
intronization. Should the initial intronic sequence be
derived from sequences outside the genes’ loci, one
might obtain clues about events including mobile element insertions that contributed to such novel introns.
Author’s response: Despite a rigorous search I could not
identify homologous parental origin for any novel intron
elsewhere within the placental and marsupial genomes,
consistent with the other studies about the intron gain.
Homology searching has shown just orthologous introns
in placental mammals, but the sources of these sequences
are still unknown. Searching for TEs in the long introns
with RepeatMasker has shown the presence of speciesspecific repeats in the analysed species. This means that
these TEs has been inserted in the particular lineages (e.
g. Afrotheria, Laurasiatheria, Rodentia, Primates etc.).
Regarding the current division of Eutheria into three sister groups Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria it is
evident that the majority of intron origination events in
domesticated genes has occurred in the eutherian ancestor, but they were later independently bombarded with
lineage-specific TEs in all three eutherian sister groups
and also inside Boreoeutheria in Laurasiatheria and in
Euarchontoglires (as evident from the big differences in
TE repertoires in these introns between rodents and primates). I agree that it is possible that some intergenic
regions might also serve as a source of introns. This will
be more extensively explained in a separate MS (Kokosar
and Kordis, MS in preparation) by the analysis of conserved synteny in Eutheria-specific domesticated genes. It
should be noted that by homology searching with introns
of domesticated genes in three marsupial genomes no
homologous sequences can be found. Since these genes
originated in the LCA of placental mammals no orthologs (except a few cases: e.g. PEG10) can be found in
marsupials. Knowing the limits of nucleotide homologysearching for unconstrained sequences it is impossible to
infer the origin of intron sequences in domesticated genes.
In any event, as mentioned before, the terminology
“intron gain” leads to the expectation that there is perhaps a general mechanism in placental mammals leading
to the de novo generation of intron sequences. A more
thorough investigation will probably show that most
events will be due to “bricolage” or tinkering (Jacob,
1982) via random mutations including small or large
indels leading to jury-rigged outcomes including
intronization.
Author’s response: It has been demonstrated recently by
the Lynch group (Li W, Tucker AE, Sung W, Thomas
WK, Lynch M: Extensive, recent intron gains in Daphnia

Page 15 of 18

populations. Science 2009, 326:1260-1262.; Catania F,
Lynch M: Where do introns come from? PLoS Biol 2008,
6:e283.; Catania F, Gao X, Scofield DG: Endogenous
mechanisms for the origins of spliceosomal introns. J
Hered 2009, 100:591-596.; Gao X, Lynch, M: Ubiquitous
internal gene duplication and intron creation in eukaryotes. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2009, 106:20818-20823.;)
and others (e.g.: Farlow A, Meduri E, Dolezal M, Hua L,
Schlötterer C: Nonsense-mediated decay enables intron
gain in Drosophila. PLoS Genet 2010, 6:e1000819.) that
the cellular surveillance systems have played a crucial
role in the endogenous origin of introns throughout the
eukaryotes. I think that these explanations are more
appropriate than those suggested by the reviewer.
In the paragraph titled “ongoing gain and loss of
introns in domesticated genes: evidence from comparative genomics in mammals” the author refers to the
great diversity in the numbers and positions of introns
in younger orthologous placental specific domesticated
genes and states that this indicates that some introns
have not been fixed yet. This would agree with phylogenetic studies using transposed element insertions showing that during periods of rapid speciation of placental
mammals such markers can be polymorphic (unfixed)
and phylogenetically unreliable due to incomplete lineage sorting (Churakov et al., 2009).
Author’s response: I agree with this comment.
Often it is mentioned that the majority of intron gains
have occurred in the ancestor of placental mammals
(see also Table 3). This bias could well be due to better
gene annotations and much more transcriptome information in that group.
Author’s response: I think that this explanation is not
appropriate. Even if we have 1 monotreme and 3 marsupial genomes they are mostly without the domesticated
genes, that are indeed specific for placental mammals.
Even in the other potential cases of intron gain the problem still persists since monotreme and marsupial genomes are not as well sequenced and annotated as the
human and mouse genomes. For the majority of gene
structures in these more basal mammals the 5’ UTRs
and 3’ UTRs are not known due to the incomplete nature of their cDNAs.
There are more precise numbers concerning the dating of the common ancestor of placental mammals
namely after the therian divergence 148 million years
ago as shown in Figure 1 of Warren et al. (2009).
Author’s response: Very recently (Luo ZX, Yuan CX,
Meng QJ, Ji Q: A Jurassic eutherian mammal and divergence of marsupials and placentals. Nature 2011,
476:442-445.) a fossil of a Jurassic eutherian mammal
(Juramaia sinensis) was found. This fossil is 160 My old
and provides new estimates for the divergence of marsupials and placentals. It extends the first appearance of

Kordiš Biology Direct 2011, 6:59
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/59

the eutherian-placental clade by about 35 Myr from the
previous record, it also has reduced and resolved a discrepancy between the previous fossil record and the
molecular estimate for the placental-marsupial divergence. Because Juramaia is unambiguously placed on the
placental side of the marsupial-placental divergence, the
marsupial-placental divergence must have occurred
before Juramaia. Therefore this new fossil serves to reset
the minimal age at 160 Myr for the basal-most diversification of marsupials and placentals. This new eutherian
fossil age is now similar to the age of placentals at 160
Myr with 95% posterior distribution from 143 to 178
Myr by the latest molecular estimate.
The tables in the main section need further explanation: for example, what is the significance of a range for
intron numbers such as 5 to 13 for the POGZ gene etc.,
Table 1? In Table 2 under location of introns, the entry
often says “5’ UTR or coding”. I presume the precise
location is unclear which would call into question the
precise annotation of the corresponding genes and/or
transcripts.
Author’s response: Intron numbers are variable in some
genes or in some species, this is connected to the loss or
additional gain of introns. »5’ UTR or coding«: precise
location is always clear, either in 5’ UTR or in coding
region. These genes in human or mouse have been really
correctly annotated (at the Ensembl or at the NCBI
Genes), but in some other low coverage genomes erroneous annotations can still be found. Explanations:
-5’ UTR/coding: introns are present both in 5’ UTR
and in coding region (for example: Homo RGAG1 gene
contains 2 introns in 5’ UTR and one intron in coding
region),
-5’ UTR or coding: introns are present either in 5’ UTR
or in coding region (for example ZCCHC12 gene: in
humans three introns are present in 5’ UTR while in
chimp 5 introns in coding region were reported (erroneous annotation that was corrected very recently),
-5’ UTR or 3’ UTR: introns are present in one species
in 5’ UTR and in the other species in 3’ UTR (example:
PNMA5 gene: in human 5’ UTR intron, while in mouse
intron is located in 3’ UTR).
The fact that introns are readily being generated in
the 5’ flanking regions of retrogenes has been discussed
as early as 1992 by Brosius and Gould. This could be
cited.
Author’s response: This reference has been added to the
MS.
Where the author mentions that “the highest rate of
recent intron gain yet observed in genome-wide ortholog comparisons was in ascomycetous fungi” he could
add the publication of Denoeud et al. (2010) on massive
intron gain in the tunicate Oikopleura dioica.

Page 16 of 18

Author’s response: The citation about the massive
intron gain in Oikopleura genome has been added to the
MS.
Also, recent work on the SCAN domain, which is
derived from the C-terminal portion of the gag capsid
(CA) protein from the Gmr1-like family of Gypsy/Ty3like retrotransposons could be cited (Emerson and
Thomas, 2011). This paper and others (Baertsch et al,
2008) show that parts of retrogenes contribute to
novel protein domains to existing genes, giving an
alternative explanation to some of the “intronization”
events.
Author’s response: The requested reference has been
added to the MS.
The last part of the last sentence of the first paragraph
in the results section is unclear and should be modified.
Author’s response: The unclear sentence has been
clarified.
