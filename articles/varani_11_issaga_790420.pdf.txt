ISsaga is an ensemble of web-based methods for
high throughput identification and semiautomatic annotation of insertion sequences
in prokaryotic genomes

Abstract
Insertion sequences (ISs) play a key role in prokaryotic genome evolution but are seldom well annotated. We
describe a web application pipeline, ISsaga (http://issaga.biotoul.fr/ISsaga/issaga_index.php), that provides
computational tools and methods for high-quality IS annotation. It uses established ISfinder annotation standards
and permits rapid processing of single or multiple prokaryote genomes. ISsaga provides general prediction and
annotation tools, information on genome context of individual ISs and a graphical overview of IS distribution
around the genome of interest.
Background
The growing number of completely sequenced bacterial
and archaeal genomes are making important contributions
to understanding genome structure and evolution. Annotation of gene content and genome comparison have also
provided much valuable information and key insights into
how prokaryotes are genetically tailored to their lifestyles.
The rate at which sequenced prokaryotic genomes and
metagenomes are accumulating is constantly increasing
with the development of new high-throughput sequencing
techniques. The resulting mass of data should provide an
unparalleled opportunity to achieve a better understanding
of prokaryotes. High quality genome annotation together
with a standardized nomenclature is an essential requirement for this since most proteins identified from these
sequencing projects will probably never be characterized
biochemically [1]. Unfortunately, expert genome annotation is fast becoming a bottleneck in genomics [2].
A crucial example of an annotation bottleneck concerns insertion sequences (ISs), the smallest and simplest autonomous mobile genetic elements. These
contribute massively to horizontal gene transfer and
play a key role in genome organization and evolution,

but are seldom correctly annotated at the DNA level.
ISs are transposable DNA segments ranging from 0.7 to
3.5 kbp, generally including a transposase gene encoding
the enzyme that catalyses IS movement. Many (but not
all) ISs are delimited by short terminal inverted repeat
(IR) sequences and flanked by short, direct repeat (DR)
sequences. The DRs are generated in the target DNA as
a result of insertion. ISs are classified into about 25 different families on the basis of the relatedness of transposases and overall organization (ISfinder) [3]. They are
often present in significant numbers in prokaryote genomes and, indeed, transposases are by far the most
abundant and ubiquitous genes found in nature [4].
Available annotation programs do not provide an
authoritative IS annotation. Correct annotation must
include both protein and DNA. These features are characteristic for each IS family and provide information concerning their mechanism of transposition and their
possible roles in modifying the host genome. At the protein level, transposases are often mislabeled as ‘integrase’,
‘recombinase’, ‘protein of unknown function’ or ‘hypothetical protein’. Moreover, IS-associated accessory (often
regulatory) and other passenger genes are rarely correctly
described. At the DNA level, features such as the IRs and
DRs, whose presence can indicate whether the IS is potentially active, are generally missing. Partial IS copies are

even more rarely annotated. Partial IS copies are important because they represent scars of ancestral recombination events and, as such, can provide information
concerning the evolution of the host replicon.
Additional IS-related genetic objects, such as miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs),
mobile insertion cassettes (MICs) and solo IRs [5], are
also missing from the majority of genome annotations.
Some of these structures, although not encoding their
own transposase, can be activated by a cognate transposase from an intact related IS also present in the genome and therefore can impact on genome evolution.
More recently, IS copies including additional passenger
genes unrelated to transposition (transporter ISs) have
been identified, confounding the frontier between ISs
and transposons [6]. Although ISs are relatively simple
genetic objects, they are sufficiently diverse in sequence
and organization that their annotation is not simple and
presents some major hurdles for automatic annotation
systems. The failure to accurately annotate ISs in publicly available prokaryote genomes severely biases studies
attempting to provide an overview of IS distributions
related to prokaryotic phylogenies or ecological niches.
To overcome the present annotation limitations, we
have developed ISsaga (Insertion Sequence semi-automatic genome annotation), which provides comprehensive computational tools and methods for rapid, highquality IS annotation. This is integrated as a module into
ISfinder, the prokaryote IS reference centre database [7]
and IS repository, which includes more than 3,500
expertly annotated individual ISs from bacteria and
archaea and also provides a basis for IS classification.
ISsaga is part of the ISfinder ‘Genome’ section, which
also includes ISbrowser, a genome visualization tool for
ISs, which at present contains more than 40 expertly
annotated genomes (119 replicons). The ISsaga platform
has been designed to maintain common standards for
high quality IS annotation used in ISfinder at both protein and nucleotide levels. It is a web-based service that
includes an ensemble of methods for IS identification
and is freely available to the academic community.
We have successfully tested this new software suite
using several genomes available in the public databases
and find that it provides a significantly more complete
picture of each of these genomes than is presently available. The annotation quality obtained with ISsaga
approached that which ISfinder experts obtain with our
manual methods [6].

What is ISsaga?

ISsaga is designed specifically for use with the ISfinder
database and leads the annotator simply through the

annotation process in a sequential manner. A flow chart
describing the system is shown in Figure 1. The annotation process requires a user quality control, which is
described in the ISsaga manual (Additional file 1) or can
be supplied by expert ISfinder annotators on request.

Figure 1 Flow diagram of the ISsaga pipeline. The figure shows
how the different ISsaga functions are assembled. Following loading
of the appropriate genome file, the system identifies ORFs using the
ORF identification module. Module (a): if the file is pre-annotated, the
protocol performs a BLASTP (filter off and e-value 1e-5) analysis
followed by BLASTX (filter off and e-value 1e-5) to identify any ORFs
that may have been overlooked. If the file is not annotated, an
automatic Glimmer annotation is performed prior to BLASTP and
BLASTX. Identified ORFs are included in a candidate ORF list. The
replicon is then subject to BLASTN (filter off, word size 7 and e-value
1e-5) analysis, which yields an IS prediction and generates a webbased annotation table. If no ORFs are found, BLASTN is performed
against the ISfinder database and any candidate ISs are fed into the
IS prediction step. This step identifies partial ISs without ORFs. In a
second module (b), ISs that have been identified and are already
present in ISfinder are automatically fed into an IS report that must
then be validated (module (c)). These modules are linked to the web
interface (module (d)), which permits annotation management and
provides tools for identifying and defining new ISs.

ISsaga is a semi-automatic system in which all automatically generated results must be validated by the user.
The user must also identify any new IS elements not
already present in ISfinder using the toolbox provided
by the system. These procedures are explained in detail
in the user manual.
Although the system is provided freely to the academic community, its use requires registration. This
step protects the data of individual users and ensures
that correct annotation standards are used. The fact that
transposases are the most ubiquitous genes found in
nature [4], together with the number of incorrectly
annotated genomes we have encountered in the public
databases (in which errors are often widely propagated
and difficult to correct a posteriori), makes this constraint essential. In opening an annotation project in
ISsaga, the user has the choice of retaining the final
annotations in a private section (where they will be
retained for 6 months before transfer to ISfinder and
ISbrowser) or including it directly in the public databases. Note that each addition to ISfinder increases the
efficiency of annotation of subsequent genomes and the
database therefore depends on contributions from
the community.
The semi-automatic annotation system uses the Blast
[8] algorithm in two modules: protein and nucleotide
annotation. Each module consists of a group of programs written in BioPerl [9], Bourne Shell and PHP languages and executed in the http Apache manager
(version 2.2.12), together with a database implemented
by MySQL (version 5.1.37).
Examples of a completed genome annotation and a
genome ‘in progress’ performed using ISsaga can be
found on the web site without registration. Selected tabs
that are important for understanding the description
below are indicated in the accompanying text in the
form: (Tab/’Link’). A complete manual can also be consulted online or downloaded as a ‘.pdf’ file (see also
Additional file 1).
Genome file format and loading

ISsaga accepts pre-annotated GenBank files (.gbk), the
recommended format, and FASTA nucleotide files
(.fasta). It will also accept FASTA protein files (.faa) but
only together with the corresponding FASTA nucleotide
file. It performs automatic IS-associated ORF identification using IS-associated transposase and transpositionrelated (for example, regulatory) gene models (provided
by ISfinder) for ‘.fasta’ input files. The recommended
genome input file for ISsaga is the GenBank format
because this file format normally includes pseudogene
annotations. The system can be used to annotate ten
replicons concurrently in a single project (that is,
including several chromosomes and plasmids that may
constitute the genome of interest).

IS-associated ORF identification

The first step in the ISsaga pipeline is identification of
IS-associated ORFs. This is performed by the ORF identification module (module (a) in Figure 1), which identifies IS-associated ORFs within a given genome and
attributes them to IS families defined in ISfinder.
With a single genomic nucleotide FASTA file (.fasta)
the platform will automatically predict all IS-associated
ORFs using Glimmer3 [10] with an optimized gene
model derived from the ISfinder dataset. If provided
with the corresponding ‘.faa’ file, the system will consider this as an annotated file and will not perform the
initial ORF identification step.
To verify that all ORFs of potential interest have been
identified, a BLASTX analysis is then performed.
A web-based interface will show the predicted number
of ISs and families and distinguish partial from full
copies. This serves simply as a guide to aid the user
through the nucleotide and validation modules. An
annotation table (Annotation tab/’Annotation Table’) is
also generated (Additional file 2). This will be gradually
completed during the annotation process. It includes the
ORFs identified, their family attribution, and similarity
with ISs in ISfinder as well as their genome coordinates.
It also contains fields concerning the subsequent
nucleotide annotation (Additional file 2).
If a member of a new family exists and its transposase
has been annotated as such in the source GenBank file,
ISsaga will provide it with a tag ‘putative new family’.
Clearly, ISsaga will not automatically identify ISs that
are very different to those in the database and whose
transposases have not been previously annotated. For
example, those ISs that transpose by different chemistries to the classical aspartate-aspartate-glutamate catalytic domain (DDE) transposases will not be found unless
a copy is included in ISfinder. Contributions from the
community obtained from direct identification of ISs
from individual transposition events (for example, insertional mutation of cloned genes) is important in improving IS identification and extending the accuracy of
annotation. The probability of not identifying ISs will
decrease with the increasing use of ISsaga to supplement
the ISfinder database.
IS nucleotide sequence annotation

The nucleotide annotation module (module (b) in
Figure 1) automatically identifies ISs already present in
ISfinder. It generates a list of ISs present in the genome
(Semi-automatic tab/’List Annotated IS(s)’) and a report
for each IS, including details of each individual copy.
These must be validated by the user and will then be
automatically added to the annotation table.
If an ORF does not correspond to the transposase of
an IS present in ISfinder, the corresponding IS must be
defined by the user. This will be the reference IS, which

Varani et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R30
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R30

Page 4 of 9

will be added to ISfinder. ISsaga includes a tool box
(Tools tab) with a detailed explanation for this purpose.
Once the program has estimated the number of new
ISs, ISfinder will, on request, attribute a block of names
(one for each new IS) using the standard nomenclature
system. The user should submit the new ISs to ISfinder
for verification using the direct IS submission tool (Validation tab/’Submit IS to ISfinder’). These will then be
included automatically in ISfinder (either in the public
or private sections, as initially chosen by the user when
opening the project). The new ISs will be added to the
list of ISs present in the genome and a report generated,
which, after validation, will be added to the annotation
table (Additional file 2).
Prokaryotic genomes often carry intercalated IS clusters in which one IS is interrupted by insertion of additional ISs. ISsaga includes a tool in the annotation
report to resolve such structures and to reconstruct the
associated ISs.
Following annotation progress

During the annotation process the user can generate a
series of graphic representations of the annotation status
(Annotation tab/’Annotation Status’), including a pie
chart and histograms as well as a circular representation
of the IS distribution using an integrated CGView tool
[11] (Annotation tab/’ISbrowser Preview’) This is only
accessible from a ‘replicon page’, not from the ‘project
page’ (see manual). This feature, integrated into ISbrowser [12], is dynamic and, together with a summary table,
provides a continuous snapshot of progress of the annotation. This can be compared directly with the results
obtained from the automatic prediction (Annotation
tab/’Global Annotation Prediction’).
ISsaga output

At the end of the annotation process (when all lines in
the annotation table are complete), the identified IS(s)

and the annotation result can be retrieved in a spreadsheet format or as a new GenBank file (Annotation tab/
’Extract Annotation’). The possibility of extracting a new
and correct GenBank file (Figure 2) will facilitate replacement of partial or badly annotated files and reduce
subsequent propagation of errors to other genomes. The
corrected file can be exported to applications such as
Artemis [13] and Gbrowser [14] for further analysis.
It will also be possible, in the near future, to export
the results to ISbrowser. For this, the completed annotation must first be validated and curated by ISfinder.
Testing ISsaga reliability
Rapid estimation of IS content

In many cases, a user does not necessarily need an accurate annotation but would simply like to obtain an estimate of the number of ISs (both complete and partial
copies) and the number of different IS families in a given
genome. This can be obtained using Annotation tab/
’Replicon Annotation Prediction’. The prediction is automatically generated in the initial step after loading the genome file. We have introduced a number of rules that
operate automatically to remove many of the major annotation ambiguities encountered due to the diversity and
complexity of ISs (for example, the presence of more than
one ORF in an IS, overlapping reading frames, programmed translational frameshifting, and so on). These
rules are not exhaustive. They have been defined from our
present experience with IS identification but, as more such
cases come to light, additional rules will be added.
Comparison of ISsaga prediction with available annotated
genomes

We have tested the ISsaga prediction tool using eight
bacterial chromosomes chosen to represent different
types of IS population, including high and low IS density,
intercalated clusters of ISs and a wide variety of IS

families (both as complete and partial copies). We compared the results obtained with the prediction tool, those
obtained by expert annotation through the standard
ISfinder procedure as described by Siguier et al. [6] and
the original annotated GenBank files. The genomes
analysed were Clostridium thermocellum, two strains of
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, two strains of Anaeromyxobacter sp., two strains of Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans and Aquiflex aeolicus (Table 1). Clearly, the
annotations included in the original GenBank file
severely underestimate both the number and diversity of
the IS population in each of the chosen genomes compared with those identified using manual ISfinder annotation. Where annotations exist in the GenBank files,
these generally only concern proteins that carry a tag
‘transposase’ with no indication of IS family. If an IS
family is attributed, it is often incorrect (for example,
‘mutator’, a eukaryote transposon, instead of the prokaryotic IS256, or IS4, which is attributed to a large proportion of classical transposases). In addition, it is even more
common that no nucleotide annotation is included.
The number of predictor-identified ORFs approaches
that obtained by manual ISfinder annotation [6]. In certain
cases, however, the predictor provides an overestimate.
When investigated individually, these were found to be of
two major types. The first class includes proteins similar
to accessory proteins of the IS91 and Tn3 families, such as
tyrosine or serine recombinases (integrases and resolvases,
respectively). The second class contains proteins that
share a domain with an accessory IS gene (that is, not a
transposase), for example, the ATP binding domain of the
IS21 ’helper’ protein, IstB. Although we have included filters to eliminate some of these, we have voluntarily set the
filters at a level that retains a small fraction. This ensures
that we do not eliminate real but distantly related IS-associated ORFs. Another reason for over-estimating the total
number of ISs is that ISsaga will consider an interrupted
IS ORF (relatively frequent events) as two or more occurrences. We cannot supply filters for these unless the IS is
included in ISfinder, and the user must reconstruct the
sequence manually.
Although many false positives are removed from the
predictor results, they are included in the final annotation table. This permits individual examination and
manual deletion or validation in the final annotation.
In spite of the limitations of the predictor, we emphasize that it remains the most reliable available software
for automatic IS prediction and its reliability will evolve
with time and experience.
Exploitation of ISsaga
Genome context

One useful feature of ISsaga is that it supplies the genome context (that is, flanking genes) for each annotated

Page 5 of 9

IS, allowing identification of IS-induced gene disruption
and rearrangements. For example, the DRs flanking an
IS are generated by insertion into a specific site. If a
particular IS does not exhibit flanking DRs but other ISs
of the same family do, it is likely that this IS has been
involved in a rearrangement either by transposition or
by homologous recombination with a second copy. The
individual IS report (Semi-automatic tab/’List Annotated
IS(s)’) (Figure 3) presents a list of IS target sites together
with the flanking regions, including DRs (when present).
Inspection of this can often reveal the presence of one
DR copy associated with one IS while the other is associated with a second IS in the list. This indicates where
recombination has occurred or, alternatively, the point
of insertion of a composite transposon (in which a segment of DNA is flanked by two similar ISs in direct or
inverted relative orientation). In the example given, the
distance between the two ISs concerned is too great for
a composite transposon, implying that an IS-mediated
rearrangement has occurred. It is also possible that the
analysis will provide evidence of IS-mediated synteny
interruption between two closely related strains (for
example, [15]).
Additionally, inspection of flanking genes or gene fragments can uncover a variety of local genomic modifications: genes interrupted by the insertion; insertional
hotspots relating to target specificity; intercalated or tandem ISs; and IS-driven flanking gene expression (for
example, formation of hybrid promoters) [3].
The ability to identify partial IS copies, intercalated ISs
and IS derivatives, such as MITEs, MICs, and solo IRs,
as well as more complex structures, such as ISs with
passenger genes and new potential compound transposons, is important. Their inclusion gives a significantly
more accurate interpretation of the spread and distribution of ISs and provides information about the evolutionary history of the host genome. This topic
periodically receives attention but, since the analyses are
generally based on extremely limited, incomplete and
inaccurate data sets, most of the published results have
very limited utility.

Discussion
Machine-based genome annotation, when coupled to an
expertly curated reference database, represents a powerful combination for providing high quality data, especially when subject to expert human inspection and
validation. The numerical importance of transposases in
nature [4], and presumably, therefore, the genetic
objects on which they function, makes their correct
annotation imperative. However, although ISs are arguably the simplest autonomous transposable elements,
their diversity and complexity probably exclude the
development of an entirely automatic annotation

The table shows a comparison of IS annotations of eight bacterial genomes
contained in the corresponding GenBank files (GB) with those obtained by
manual annotation (Manual) and using the ISsaga predictor with two different
IS reference databases. In one database (-IS) the reference ISs contained in the
genome under test were removed while in the other these ISs were included
(+IS). The total number of IS-associated ORFs (Total IS ORF) are divided into
four categories: Complete ORFs, Partial ORFs, Pseudogenes and Unknown. The
category ‘Unknown’ includes all examples that cannot be distinguished by the
predictor as complete or partial due to the absence of sufficient numbers of
closely related examples in the reference database. The categories ‘Total IS’
and ‘Different IS’ are based on nucleotide predictions. In these predictions the
number of ORFs carried by the IS are taken into account. For example, if an IS
includes two ORFs, this will be counted as two examples in ‘Complete ORF’
but as a single IS in ‘Total IS’.

procedure. While ISsaga is only semi-automatic and
requires some user input and expertise, it permits accurate and relatively rapid IS annotation. Moreover, as the
ISfinder database is enriched, the automatic step of IS
identification and annotation will steadily improve by
reducing the user input and the time necessary to define
uncharacterized ISs in the genome.

ISsaga can also assist genome assembly in sequencing
projects. Complete genome sequencing involves assembly of ‘contigs’ into a complete replicon. Due to the limitations of assembly programs, the presence of repeated
sequences such as ISs, often located at the contig ends,
complicates the assembly procedure. A knowledge of IS
context resulting from accurate annotation of individual
contigs can assist in genome assembly.
The increased sequencing capacities now available
have also led to a more pragmatic approach for rapid
comparison of sets of closely related strains in which

Figure 3 Part of the individual IS report. This example shows the four complete copies of ISAcma18 from the genome of Acaryochloris
marina. The top section shows the genome coordinates of each IS. Note that copies 2 and 3 are at some distance from each other. The lower
section shows the flanking 49 bp and the corresponding DRs. Note that the left ‘DR’ of copy 2 (marked in red) is present as the right ‘DR’ of
copy 3 (marked in red) whereas the right ‘DR’ of copy 2 (marked in black) is present as the left ‘DR’ of copy 3 (marked in black).

contigs are simply mapped to a common scaffold rather
than assembled into a definitive genome [16]. Again,
since many contigs are terminated by repeated
sequences, IS context obtained from accurate annotation
can provide strong support for assembly of the scaffold
for synteny studies.
Metagenomes

Increased sequencing capacity has also resulted in a
paradigm shift from genome-centric to gene-centric
approaches with the advent of metagenomics. ISsaga
can contribute fundamentally to such studies in two
ways: firstly by enriching the ISfinder database by high
throughput annotation of completely assembled and
scaffold-based genomes; and secondly by direct analysis
of the metagenomes themselves. Although typical
sequence runs in metagenomic analyses are short,
enough information can be present to identify a particular IS from fragments at the DNA or protein level.
Again, IS context provided by ISsaga could assist in
small assemblies but, more importantly, it will provide
identification tags for ISs whose distribution is limited
and that may be used to determine some of the genera
and even species present in the original sample.
Genome evolution

Another advantage provided by a complete genome IS
annotation is that it permits a detailed basis on which
to compare strains and species. An excellent example is
that of the Bordetellae [17], in which IS activity has had
a profound effect on the structure and size of several

different species in a process that can be correlated with
pathogenicity.
Other mobile genetic elements

ISs and IS derivatives represent only a proportion of all
prokaryotic mobile genetic elements. It is hoped that
ISsaga will be extended to other mobile genetic elements such as transposons, integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) [18] and integrons [19].
It is expected that the ISsaga pipeline and its future
development will provide the scientific community with
a significantly more accurate way of annotating their
own set of this type of mobile genetic element and in
sharing the expertise of ISfinder through the web
service.

Materials and methods
ISfinder annotation procedure as used in ISsaga

ISsaga uses a semi-automatic procedure based on the
methodology for identification of ISs in the public databases described in [6].
ISsaga has a semi-automatic and manual modular
architecture described in detail in Figure 1, in the user
manual (Additional file 1 and [20]) and largely in the
body of this article. The modular construction allows
the annotation process to be broken down into three
interconnected steps: protein (IS-associated ORF identification); nucleotide; and validation steps.
For the web interface ISsaga uses PHP [21] in the http
Apache manager (version 2.2.12). The execution procedure in each annotation module was written in

Varani et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R30
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R30

Page 8 of 9

BioPerl [9] and Bourne Shell languages and executed
with a database implemented by MySQL (version
5.1.37). Both use a set of open source software described
in the user manual.
The protein and nucleotide steps are entirely based on
sequence similarity comparison using BLAST [8] software against a daily updated version of the ISfinder
database. The protein step, includes determination of the
IS-associated (complete/intact or partial/fragment) genes
and the transposase family, optimized by the BlastP and
BlastX parameters (similarity threshold of more than
97%, word size of 3, e-value 1e-5 and the complexity filter
disabled). ISsaga scans the input genome annotation for
IS-associated ORFs. All ORFs inside the blast threshold
are considered as potential IS regions.
For unannotated genomes (fasta file input), a prior
ORF prediction is automatically made with Glimmer3
using a specific IS-associated gene model constructed
with the ‘build-icm’ program (provided by the Glimmer3
package) with the training set provided by the ISfinder
protein sequence database. The results of this step are
included in the annotation table (Additional file 2).
The IS ORF prediction (complete, partial or uncategorized) uses both global (Emboss stretcher) and local
(Blast) alignment procedures against the ISfinder protein
dataset (Figure 4).
For IS nucleotide prediction, ISsaga takes into account
the characteristics of each IS family (as defined on the
ISfinder website) to identify the regions that could contain an IS. For example, for an IS composed of two
ORFs, ISsaga will extract the nucleotide sequence starting from the coordinates of the beginning of the first
ORF to the coordinates of the end of the second. All
nucleotide candidate IS regions are grouped by

Blastclust program (parameters: -p F -S 90 -b F -L 0.0)
to determine the number of different regions.
The nucleotide step includes identification of the IRs
or IS ends, and the insertion site with DRs of each ISassociated ORF previously identified, and for putative
partial ISs that do not contain ORF products, using the
optimized BlastN parameters: identity threshold >95%,
word size = 7, e-value = 1e-5 and complexity filter disabled. ISsaga scans the input genome fasta sequence for
previously annotated ISs in the ISfinder database.
For ISs not in the ISfinder database, the user must
submit the newly identified ISs so that they can subsequently be semi-automatically annotated (detailed
instructions can be found in the user manual in Additional file 1. For each IS identified in this step, ISsaga
creates a validation report, to be further analyzed by the
annotator in the validation step.
The validation step processes the result generated by
the previous steps, and exports each predicted IS identified in the nucleotide step to the annotation table. This
is an entirely manual procedure, where the annotator
must verify each IS prediction result. This requires
some IS annotation expertise, which is detailed in the
user manual.
Open source programs used in Issaga

Open source programs used in Issaga are: BioPerl, used
to run the annotation, generation of the IS validation
report, context map and validation [9]; BLAST (Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool) [8]; EMBOSS, the EMBO
Open Software Suite [22]; MySQL, a relational database
management system (RDBMS) [23]; and phpMyEdit, an
instant MySQL table editor and PHP code generator
used to generate the annotation table [24].
