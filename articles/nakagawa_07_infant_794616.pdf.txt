Abstract
Background: The anti-saccade task, when people must respond in the direction opposite to a visual
stimulus, has been used as a marker of operation of the frontal cortical oculomotor area. However, early
development of oculomotor control has been little studied with the infant anti-saccade paradigm, and a
few studies did not recognize anti-saccades in infants in light of the results of adult anti-saccade. Since the
characteristics of infant eye movements are little known, applying the criteria used in adult study is by no
means the best way to study infant anti-saccade. As it is indicated that coordinated eye and head
movements often enable infants to control the direction of their gaze, head movements should be
examined as an infant orienting response. The aim of this study was to address how infants used eye and
head movements during the anti-saccade paradigm. To distinguish infants' responses, we also investigated
eye and head movements during a task for an inhibition of return. Inhibition of return, in which delayed
responses occur in the direction to which attention had previously been oriented, has been thought to
mark activity of the superior colliculus. Since the superior colliculus is thought to develop much earlier in
life than the frontal lobes, we thought it useful to compare these task performances during infancy.
Methods: Infants were divided into three groups according to age. Anti-saccade and inhibition-of-return
tasks were given. Their eye and head movements during tasks were independently recorded by the corneal
reflection method in the head-free condition.
Results: Younger infants tended to initiate eye movement less than older ones in both tasks. In the antisaccade task, responses opposite to the cue tended to show longer latency than responses to the cue.
Infants made faster responses toward the side opposite the cue when it was to the right than when it was
left of fixation. Regarding the comparison of responses toward the side opposite the cue between two
tasks, the leftward eye movement was faster than the leftward head movements in the inhibition-of-return
task, while no difference of latency was observed between eye and head movements in the anti-saccade
task. A qualitative analysis of the trajectory of these responses revealed that head movement trajectories
were steeper in the anti-saccade than in the inhibition-of-return task.
Conclusion: Younger infants move head and eyes together, with head movements frequently starting
first. On the other hand, both the leftward latency difference between eye and head and gentle trajectories
of head in inhibition of return indicate that eye movements are more predominant over head movements
in the inhibition-of-return task than in the anti-saccade task. This would suggest an earlier developing
inhibition-of-return mechanism.

Background
A crucial marker of eye movement is the ability to suppress saccades toward a suddenly appearing peripheral
stimulus (pro-saccade), while making a saccade in the
opposite direction instead (anti-saccade). In an anti-saccade task, subjects are instructed not to look at a flashed
cue, but to make a saccade in the opposite direction [1].
That requires the willful inhibition of a strong drive to
reflexively orient one's gaze to an abrupt visual stimulus.
Using pro- and anti-saccade tasks, Munoz et al [2]
revealed that children and adults diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactive disorders (ADHD) have great difficulties in suppressing unwanted saccades and
voluntarily controlling their fixation behavior. They
pointed to how the known fronto-striatal pathophysiology producing the symptoms of ADHD can damage the
development of oculomotor control. There is a growing
interest in oculomotor control in developmental disorders.
Both Johnson [3] and Scerif et al. [4] tested infants' ability
to inhibit saccades with an infant anti-saccade paradigm.
Infant saccades were investigated by manipulating the
spatial relationship between central and peripheral stimuli and the location where attractive stimuli appear. A
similar presentation sequence (Figure 1a) was used in the
present study. Giving verbal instruction to a young infant
to look to the side opposite the cued side is impossible.
Instead, one must encourage them to look at the second
stimulus (the target) more than the first one (the cue) by
making the second stimulus more attractive than the first
one. After a number of such trials, Johnson [3] observed
the decrease in responding to the cue, which predicted the
appearance of attractive stimuli at a contralateral location.
However, he concluded that 4-month-olds did not produce anti-saccades toward the target location in light of
the results of adult anti-saccade (e.g., [5]). Scerif et al. [4]
also did not recognize anti-saccades in infants, as they
classified subjects' responses following the criteria used in
adult study [5]. Thus, previous infant studies used adult
criteria to classify infant responses in the anti-saccade task.
However, saccade characteristics themselves in young
infants have been little studied systematically [6]. For
example, as a methodological issue, it is not easy to
restrict head movement and calibrate each subject, both
of which are requisite for quantitative eye movement
study. Thus, since the characteristics of infant saccades
were little known, applying the criteria used in adult study
was not by any means the best way to examine infant antisaccade. Or infant responses during the task should be
investigated before applying the criteria or being classified. While neither Johnson [3] nor Scerif et al. [4] recognized "anti-saccade" in early infants, by 4 months of age,

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/3/1/5

infants can reportedly be trained to make saccades at particular spatial locations [7,8].
In a few cross-sectional studies [9-11], pro- and anti-saccades of subjects more than 5 years old have been examined in the general head-restrained condition to cancel
out the effects of head movements. The characteristics of
the saccades in the head-free condition may vary according to head movements. For example, a primate's saccades
occurring in a head-free condition showed slower velocity
or a depressed velocity-amplitude slope, relative to saccades occurring with the head fixed [12]. In order to differentiate between head-fixed and head-free saccadic eye
movements, they have been termed eye saccades and gaze
saccades, respectively.
Meanwhile, little is known about the infant head-free saccadic eye movements. Infant head movements have been
mainly examined during visual pursuit in tracking of visual stimuli in order to study development of eye-head
coordination [see [13]]. Johnson [3] and Scerif et al. [4]
investigated infant oculomotor control with no specific
concern as to its relationship with head movement.
Although Regal et al. [14] noted that coordinated eye and
head movements often enable infants to control the direction of their gaze, no one has studied how head movements are used by infants during an anti-saccade
paradigm.
Until now we have attempted to quantify infant eye
movements in the head-free condition, measuring eye
and head movements independently at the same time
[15]. In the present study, in applying our quantitative
method, we examine the infant look toward the second
stimuli (target) in the absence of response toward the first
stimuli (cue) in an anti-saccade task (Figure 1a). These
responses to the target were compared with their
responses to the cued side. In each trial we measured both
eye and head latencies, respectively. In their infant study
regarding the coordination of eye and head movement in
order to capture peripheral visual stimuli, Regal et al. [14]
pointed out that the pattern according to which infant
head movement precedes their eye movement is not
found in adults.
Moreover, to distinguish infants' responses toward the
above-mentioned non-cued side in the anti-saccade task,
we also compared them with their responses during the
task for an inhibition of return. The function of inhibition
of return is to bias the subject to orienting toward novel
objects and locations and away from previously inspected
ones [16]. To be specific, in a spatial cuing paradigm for
inhibition of return (Figure 1b), peripheral cues facilitate
the processing of targets at cued locations for approximately 300 ms. However, with longer latencies between

cue and targets, a spatial cue draws attention to that location reflexively, inducing an inhibition of saccades toward
the cued location. In that covert method, a peripheral cue
is presented so briefly that a saccade is not initiated.
Therefore, inhibition of return seen from a covert paradigm using spatial cuing can also be called a reaction
toward the opposite side from where the cue stimulus is
given. However, these responses in the inhibition-ofreturn task are thought to be exogenously-driven automatic responses and to mark activity of the phylogenetically ancient superior colliculus [17]. On the other hand,
those in the anti-saccade task are thought to be endogenously controlled and to require more computational
resources [3]. To our knowledge, no one has yet made a
quantitative comparison of eye and head movements during anti-saccade versus inhibition-of-return tasks. We
want to see if the inhibition of return shows signs of maturity well before the anti-saccade task, since it is based on
an older neural system which develops earlier.
The main purpose of the present study is to determine
how infants used eye and head movements toward the
side opposite the cued location, and to examine the characteristics of such movements during an anti-saccade task.
Since anti-saccade task has emerged as an important tool
for investigating not only normal brain function, but also

dysfunction in various disease conditions [18], the early
development of responses during that task is worth studying. Preliminarily, we also attempt to conduct a quantitative analysis of amplitude, velocity and latency of infant
eye and head movements, in the head-free condition, during anti-saccade and inhibition-of-return tasks.

Methods
Subjects
Twenty-nine infants, ranging in age from 3 to 11 months
(mean = 7.6 months, median = 7 months), were recruited
through local maternity groups. All gave informed consent from their parents before the experiments. The study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nagoya City
University (No. 2) and accorded with the ethical standards specified in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Infants
were divided into three groups by age: eight 3- to 5month-olds (4 male, 4 female), ten 6- to 8-month-olds (4
male, 6 female), and eleven 9- to 11-month-olds (6 male,
5 female). Criteria for admission into the study were: no
known birth defects or other kinds of complications, full
term (more than 37 weeks gestation), and normal birth
weight (2500 g–4000 g). The data from another 4-monthold, two 5-month-olds, two 9-month-olds, and one 11month-old were excluded because they were able to complete less than half of the inhibition-of-return or anti-sac-

cade task trials. And one 11-month-old was dropped
because he refused application of a sticking plaster to his
forehead, which is explained in the following eye movement section. Even if infants completed enough trials, at
times, we entirely failed to track the eye or head movements by the X-Y tracker as in the following section. Thus,
owing to the insufficiency of the contrast in video images
of infant faces, the X-Y tracker could not detect the brightest (or darkest) portions of the CCD sensor. Therefore, the
data from one 5-month-old and two 6-month-olds were
also excluded.
Each session, which consisted of inhibition-of-return and
anti-saccade tasks, was scheduled for approximately 30
min during the infants' most alert time of day. If the infant
was in a bad mood or not alert, the session was rescheduled. Upon arrival at the session room, the experimenter
explained the general procedure while a research assistant
handed the infant some warm-up toys to play with. After
the infant seemed adjusted to both the room and the
research assistant, the infant and mother were escorted to
a semi-dark area surrounded by a blackout curtain. After
completing one of two tasks, the infant and mother were
escorted outside of the semi-dark area and the infant was
soothed by the mother or the research assistant. Then they
were taken back into the semi-dark area for the other task.
During the experiments, the mother, though out of sight,
was never far from the infant. At the end of the session, the
mother was given the Infant Behavior QuestionnaireRevised (IBQ-R Japanese version) and asked to complete
and return it.
Eye movement recording
The infant sat in an experimental baby chair 65 cm away
from the color monitor of an AV tachistoscope (IS-702) in
a semi-dark area. The experimenter outside the semi-dark
area monitored the subject's eye movements through a
low-angle CCD near-infrared video camera (ELMO
CN43H) set in front of the infant, and controlled the stimulus presentation on the monitor by means of a microcomputer (FMV-S167). The stimuli presented were
superimposed synchronously on video images of the eye
movements by a digital image processor (FOR-A, MF-310)
and recorded on videotape (SONY DSR-11), which was
then used for off-line video coding (Figure 2). The central
fixation stimuli appeared on the color monitor, while the
peripheral stimuli were reflected in a first-surface mirror
on the left or right side to maintain an appropriate distance from the central fixation of approximately 30 deg.
Since head movements seldom occur in response to stimuli of target eccentricities of less than 20 deg [12], localization at the above eccentricity (30 deg) could be
accomplished with saccadic eye and head movements.

Eye movements were recorded by the corneal reflection
method. To measure infant head movements, a small
chrome steel ball bearing (4.75 mm) was stuck to around
the middle of the subject's forehead (Figure 2) and its
reflected image was also recorded (SONY DSR-11). Beams
of invisible infrared light (LED: SLR-938C) were directed
at the subject's eye from the upper right. The reflected
images of corneas and the chrome ball bearing were
caught by a near infrared CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, C3077-78) which was set up on the subject's lower
left (see Additional file 1). The TV signal was digitized to
a two-dimensional scale by an XY-tracker unit (Hamamatsu Photonics, C3162) off-line. This digitizer converted
some of the brightest (or darkest) portions of the CCD
sensor to digitized data with an absolute accuracy of 5118
× 3864 pixels at each 33.3 ms of sampling time. The performance of the left eye was analyzed.
Calibration
An exact method of calibration has not yet been found.
Since it is difficult to communicate verbally with infants,
they can not be expected to follow orders involved in a
calibration procedure. However, we applied the experimental tentative calibration method of Koga et al. [15],
which employs the analysis of distribution of data of the
landing position for gaze and head to determine the most
likely frequent landing position. This approach relied on
the eye and head movements during an experiment rather
than in a separate calibration session. It is based on general assumptions about human eye and head movements
in peripheral vision. Thus, since an infant's eyes and head
are both initially fixed on a central point, both are in the
straight-ahead position (0 degree). Next, when a target is
shown approximately 30 degrees right or left in the field
of vision, the eye is first directed to it. A head movement
follows, as a result of which the eye is positioned over the
target. To compensate for this overshoot, the eye moves
backward in relation to the head. As a result, the eye eventually returns to its primary position with both eye and
head together facing the target. Besides, in some trials,
peripheral stimulus localization was accomplished
almost exclusively with the eyes, while the head moved
very little.

The calibration method of Koga et al. [15] makes the XYtracker values – the second most frequent outputs – correspond to a visual angle of 30 degrees. Then, using these
values, the so-called calibration scale factors, the XYtracker outputs were linearly transformed into a visual
angle. Here, it should be recalled that the result of the
transformation is an absolute, not a relative, value.
Because in our research the infants can move their head
freely, the eye position detected through the corneal
reflection is an amalgam of the eye position in the orbit

and the head position in space. To obtain the eye positions in the orbit or relative to the head, we subtract the
head position outputs (which are a reflection of the
chrome ball on the infant's forehead) from the corneal
reflection outputs. The XY-tracker's outputs were linearly
transformed into visual angles in terms of both the eye
positions relative to the head and the head positions relative to space. Then, to compute the eye position relative to
space (gaze) in a visual angle, the eye positions relative to
the head and the head positions relative to space were
added. As a result of these operations, we found the point
in space where the eye gazed, and that position represents
the amplitude of the gaze in a visual angle.
Anti-saccade task
The procedure in the anti-saccade task (Figure 1a) followed that of Johnson [3]. The centering fixation stimuli
were composed of brightly-colored moving abstract figures and subtended 5 degrees of the visual angle. The
stimuli were accompanied by synchronized sounds.
While the infant looked at the fixation, the experimenter
pressed a key, which triggered presentation of the cue, a
yellow triangle (3 degrees in width), on one of the two
sides. The peripheral cue was presented for 100 ms
together with the central fixation. Following the offset of
both the central and cue stimuli, there was a 400-ms gap
before presentation of the target on the side opposite that
on which the cue had appeared. The target was composed
of colored shapes moved in synchrony with simple
sounds. The experiment consisted of a total of 32 trials,
with 16 left and 16 right targets in pseudo-random order.
The training phase consisted of the first five trials, after
which the test phase of the experiment began.
Inhibition-of-return task
The inhibition-of-return task procedure (Figure 1b) followed that of Butcher et al. [19]. Each trial began with the
presentation of attractive centering fixation stimuli simi-

lar to those used in the anti-saccade task. As before, after
the key was pressed, a peripheral cue appeared to the right
or left of the fixation stimuli. The cue, a yellow triangle (3
degrees in width), was presented for 100 ms without the
central fixation. As the cue disappeared, the central stimulus reappeared for 900 ms. Following offset of the central
stimulus, the bilateral target was presented. The target was
composed of moving colored abstract shapes associated
with auditory signals, the two sides of which were always
identical. The experiment consisted of a total of 32 trials,
with 16 left and 16 right cues in pseudo-random order.
Latencies
In the present study, only the horizontal component (xaxis) was analyzed from the two-dimensional coordination (horizontal and vertical outputs) produced by the XY tracker, allowing us to examine latencies, amplitudes
and velocity.

We defined latency as the elapsed time between the sampling time at the cue presentation and the time at the maximum acceleration for each trial of each infant. We used
latencies to investigate whether a head movement precedes an eye movement in younger infants.
The maximum acceleration is obtained through a series of
calculations. First, to ascertain the velocity (vi) of a horizontal eye movement at the ith sampling time, we should
know the gradient of the horizontal outputs (xi) at the ith
sampling time. This gradient was computed by the formula (xi+1 - xi-1)/(2/30). Here, 2/30 stands for the elapsed
time from the (i - 1)th sampling time to the (i + 1)th one.
This operation is equivalent to the first differential of the
horizontal eye movement with respect to time. Next, by
differentiation of the derived velocity, i.e., through the
equation (vi+1 - vi-1)/(2/30), we obtain the acceleration.
That series of operations is equivalent to the second differential of the horizontal eye movement with respect to

Behavioral and Brain Functions 2007, 3:5

time. Finally, we determine the maximal acceleration for
each trial of each infant, and subtract the sampling time at
the target presentation from the one at the maximum
acceleration. As the calibrated data are a linear transformation of the raw data, it does not matter whether the
latency is based on the calibrated data or the raw data for
comparison of an intra-infant. We opted to compute
latency based on the raw data.

Results
Trials for analysis
We mainly analyzed those trials in which the infant's gaze
moved directly from fixation on the target locations, i.e.,
the side opposite the cue or the cued locations. Trials in
which the gaze deviated from the direct line to those locations were not included in the analysis. Only responses
occurring after the cue onset in the anti-saccade task and
after the target onset in the inhibition-of-return task were
included. Based on the videotape in which the stimuli
were superimposed on video images of the eye movement
(Figure 2), two observers not directly involved in the
experiment judged whether or not the trial was adequate
for our analysis. The coefficient of agreement between the
two coders was .88. In some trials which were judged to
be adequate, we failed to digitize the eye or head movements by the X-Y tracker and had to exclude them.

For the infant anti-saccade paradigm, to separate visually
triggered eye movements to the target from ones that are
prepared based on the cue, we tentatively established one
criterion, i.e., responses were excluded when both eye and
head latency were longer than 1100 ms. Namely, it is up
to 600 ms post-target onset, which was defined based on
the average of each infant's mean latency of responses
toward the cued side (755.3 ms ± 146.6). Here the latency
of each trial was defined as either a faster latency of the eye
or head. That is, 600 ms is about the average latency
minus 1 SD. Then, when either the eye or head latency
was less than 1100 ms, we considered it not to be visually
triggered.
After taking the steps mentioned above, the following
numbers of responses were analyzed for each of the age
groups. The average numbers of responses, which were
directed to the side opposite the cue in the anti-saccade
test phase, were 7.8 (SD = 2.4) for the younger-age group,
6.6 (SD = 4.1) for the middle-age group, and 10.5 (SD =
6.3) for the older-age group. The average numbers of
responses, which were directed to the cued location in the
anti-saccade training and test phases, were 9.1 (SD = 5.4)
for the younger-age group, 10.6 (SD = 6.1) for the middleage group, and 7.8 (SD = 4.4) for the older-age group. In
the task for inhibition of return, average numbers of
responses directed to the side opposite the cue were 13.6
(SD = 6.7) for the younger-age group, 8.0 (SD = 1.4) for

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/3/1/5

the middle-age group, and 8.4 (SD = 3.6) for the older-age
group. The average numbers of responses directed to the
cued location were 8.8 (SD = 3.3) for the younger-age
group, 9.8 (SD = 5.5) for the middle-age group, and 7.0
(SD = 4.6) for the older-age group. In any event, for each
trial, it was difficult to obtain completely digitized data
whose sampling time was 33.3 ms all in one trial round.
Looking toward cued side vs. non-cued side in anti-saccade
paradigm
The latencies of each condition are presented in Table 1
during the anti-saccade task. Average reaction times for
each experimental condition were subjected to a four-way
repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the
following factors: side (non-cued, cued), organ (eye,
head), direction (leftward, rightward), and age (younger,
middle, older). Only the main effect of the side was marginally significant (F(1,11) = 3.72, p = .08). Hence, the average latency to the target side (846.0 ms, SD = 228.8) was
longer than the average latency to the cued side (741.5
ms, SD = 121.8). The interaction between side and direction was significant (F(1,11) = 8.77, p < .05). Responses
which were directed to the side opposite the cue occurred
earlier toward the right (788.5 ms) than toward the left
(934.3 ms), while the latencies of the responses directed
to the cued location were 703.1 ms to the left and 780.6
ms to the right.

As a result of the ANOVA mentioned above, the main
effect of the organ was not significant (F(1,11) = .349). Consequently, we defined the latency of each trial as either a
faster latency of the eye or head and conducted a threeway repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
the following factors: side (non-cued, cued), direction
(leftward, rightward), and age (younger, middle, older).
These data were plotted in Figure 3. The main effect of the
side was not significant (F(1,11) = 1.32). However, the
interaction between side and direction was significant
(F(1,11) = 10.95, p < .01). This interaction means that
infants made faster saccade toward the side opposite the
cue to the right than to the left (F(1,21) = 12.32, p < .01),
while there were no significant differences between the
saccade to the cue to the left and to the right (F(1,21) =
0.636). A similar asymmetry was reported with regard to
the anticipatory responses of infants [20].
To ascertain the tendency of early age to initiate head
movement fast, we categorized the responses of three age
groups both to the non-cued and cued sides into three
kinds according to the latencies of eye and head of each
response: eye-first, head-first and same time. We applied a
log-linear model to the age (3) × side (2) × organ (3) contingency table. As a result, the model including both an
age × organ interaction and an age × side one best fits the

age × side interaction indicates that frequency of movements to the non-cued side is different from that to the
cued one according to the age group. The age × organ
interaction shows that the frequency of eye-first responses
among the younger-age group is less than that in other age
groups.
Anti-saccade paradigm vs. inhibition-of-return paradigm:
trajectories of eye and head movements
With regard to the reaction time data of the inhibition-ofreturn task (Table 2), ANOVA was applied with the following factors: side (non-cued, cued), organ (eye, head),
direction (leftward, rightward), and age (younger, middle,
older). The effect of side approached significance (F(1,12) =
4.09, p = .066). Thus, the average latency to the non-cued
side (586.2 ms, SD = 81.2) was faster than the average
latency to the cued side (660.1 ms, SD = 120.8). Based on
these data, we considered ourselves able to observe inhibition of return in our subjects. The interaction between
organ and direction was significant (F(1,12) = 5.14, p < .05).
Toward the left, eye movements occurred earlier (605.8
ms) than head movements (651.0 ms), while the latencies
of the movements directed to the right were 618.2 ms for
the eye and 610.5 ms for the head. The faster leftward eye
movements than head movements was specially observed
in the response to the non-cued side, as the side × organ ×
direction interaction was marginally significant (F(1,12) =
3.75, p = .077). That is, regarding the response side opposite the cue, eye movements occurred earlier (580.5 ms)
than head movements (652.8 ms) toward the left, while
the latencies of the movements directed to the right were
560.7 ms for the eye and 534.0 ms for the head. As for the
responses to the cued side, the latencies of movements
directed to the left were 631.1 ms for the eye and 649.3 ms
for the head, while these toward the right were 675.7 ms
for the eye and 686.9 ms for the head. The age × organ ×

direction interaction was also significant (F(2,12) = 5.01, p
< .05).
As for amplitude, the issue is where the eye and/or the
head are inclined in space. Thus, to obtain the appropriate
amplitude of the eye relative to space (gaze) and the head
relative to space in a visual angle, calibration factors for
each infant must be found through the calibration procedure [15]. However, for some infants, we could not obtain
the calibration factors, because the second most frequent
landing position was ambiguous. Consequently, one 6month-old, one 7-month-old, one 10-month-old and one
11-month-old were excluded from analysis of amplitude
after the calibration.
At each sampling time, for the eye relative to the head
(eye), the head relative to the space (head) and the eye relative to the space (gaze), we calculated the harmonic
mean of all available data of the infants whose calibration
factors were determined. Figure 4 and 5 illustrate the harmonic mean of the eye, the head, and the gaze movements during task for anti-saccade and inhibition of
return as a function of sampling times by age group,
respectively. That is, y-axis in a visual angle stands for the
amplitude. These saccades of both tasks are those which
occurred in the leftward direction, opposite the cue, in the
available trials.
In Figure 4 and 5 these movements begin around the sampling time for the target presentation, i.e., the 27th sampling time for anti-saccade and the 43rd for inhibition of
return. From these target presentation times, the amplitude of gaze, head and eye continue to increase. Then
these amplitudes appear to stabilize at around the 61st
sampling time for the anti-saccade and at about the 81st
sampling time for the inhibition of return. On the basis of
Figure 4 and 5, we could assume steeper head movement
during the anti-saccade task compared with those evoked

during the task for inhibition of return in the youngest
two age groups.
In Table 3 and 4, the maximal amplitudes of gaze, head
and eye are presented by age group during two tasks,
respectively. These amplitudes correspond to each fixed
amplitude after the target presentation in Figure 4 and 5,
although the data illustrated in Figure 4 and 5 are only for
saccades occurring in the leftward direction. Hence, in the
anti-saccade task, the mean amplitudes between the 61st
and the 90th sampling time were calculated, while the
mean value between the 81st and 110th sampling time
were calculated for inhibition of return. Table 3 and 4
indicate that the youngest two subjects had smaller head
movements in the inhibition-of-return task compared
with those evoked in the anti-saccade task, while 9–11

To explore the mean speed of gaze, head and eye from the
sampling time at the target presentation to the one at the
maximal amplitudes, we calculated a linear regression
equation between amplitude and the sampling time and
found a regression weight (or slope), which we take to
represent the mean speed or velocity. In Table 5 and 6, the
velocity of gaze, head and eye is calculated by age group
during two tasks. In the task for anti-saccade, velocities
were based on data between 27 and 60 sampling times,
while for inhibition of return they were based on data
between 43 and 80 sampling times. Table 5 and 6 also
indicate that in the inhibition-of-return task the youngest
two subjects showed smaller velocity of head movement
compared to those in the anti-saccade task, although the
head velocities of 9–11 month infants did not differ
between the two tasks.
The relationship between eye and head movements during these tasks was also discussed in light of the categorical data mentioned above. We categorized the responses
of the three age groups to the non-cued sides during the
two tasks into three kinds of responses: eye-first, head-first
and same time. Then we applied a log-linear model to the
age (3) × task (2: Anti-saccade vs. Inhibition of return) ×
organ (3) contingency table. As a result, the model including both an age × task interaction and an age × organ inter2
action is deemed to best fit the table ( χ L = 2.46, df = 6, p

= .8727; AIC = 2184.51). The age × task interaction is
beside the point, because it shows that each age group has
a different sample size. The age × organ interaction indicates that the frequency of eye-first responses among the
younger-age group is less than that among other groups,
and that the frequency of head-first response among the
low- and middle-age groups is higher than that of the
older-age group.

Discussion

son is made to determine whether the inhibition of return
shows signs of maturity well before the anti-saccade task,
since the superior colliculus involved in the inhibition of
return is thought to develop much earlier in life than the
frontal lobes.

The present study sought to investigate the characteristics
of infant eye and head movements during an anti-saccade
task. For this purpose, first, we compared the responses
toward the side opposite the cue with the responses to the
cued location in the anti-saccade task. Second, we
attempted to a quantitatively analyze infant eye and head
movements toward the side opposite the cue during tasks
for anti-saccades and inhibition of return. The compari-

latencies of eye and head, younger infants less often initiated eye movement. These findings are consistent with
previous infant data [6,14,21]. On the other hand, human
adult subjects sometimes reportedly move their head in
the direction of the target before the gaze shift begins. This
might be a distinguishing feature of the "predictive" mode
of gaze shifts [22], whereas generally head movements
should follow saccade onset [23]. However, the present
infant results are convincing from a phylogenetical point
of view in that a combined eye-head movement may represent an older system, which is designed to change the
direction of gaze, but not to foveate any particular targets,
while the eye saccade could be a more recent system
designed to bring a visual target onto the fovea [12].
Ontogenically, eye-head gaze emerges in an early stage.
Animals, like the rabbit, who have no fovea to align with
the visual target, rarely make saccades without making
head movements [24]. Also in the cat, eye and head movements are closely related, as gaze control in the cat is finer
than in the rabbit [25].
Infant responses during anti-saccade task
In the present study of the anti-saccade task, to exclude the
measured movements to the non-cued side of visual guidance, we employed our own criterion without using the
conventional adult criterion (i.e., for a response longer
than 100 ms after target presentation). Thus, we regard

responses longer than 600 ms post-target onset as visually
triggered responses. There are two reasons for this criterion: 1) The method used to measure the response time
and perform calculations in this study differed from the
conventional research approach with adult subjects, in
which the head of the participant is stabilized or electrooculography is applied. In head-free condition, variations in latency between eye and head movements, which
is dependent on target eccentricity, predictability etc.,
have been shown in human [26]. How gaze control is
allocated into separate commands for eye and head movement is still unclear [27]; and 2) Describing the response
dynamics of infants was the key objective of the present
study. We thus sought to analyze reactions other than
those that were clearly visually triggered. As a result, the
latencies of responses toward the side opposite the cue
were marginally longer than those of responses toward
the cued side, as found in previous infant [4] and adult
studies [1,5,10,11]. This difference in latency is possibly
attributable to the responses toward the cued side, being
an exogenously driven response, whereas the anti-saccades are endogenously controlled and require more computational resources [3]. Hence, an infant might compute
the goal of his/her movement not from the visual trigger
but from an internal source. This is consistent with the
previous study that 4-month-old infants readily make
anticipatory saccades [20,28]. As for the asymmetry of the

anticipatory saccades of infants, our findings corresponded to those of Csibra et al. [20], i.e., the response
was fast toward the right. Fischer et al. [9] and Munoz et
al. [10], investigating anti-saccade task performances
between ages 8–70 years and 5–79 years respectively, also
noted the same trend in asymmetry.

return task. No such difference was observed between eye
and head movements in the anti-saccade task. Since we
found that younger infants tend to move their head before
their eyes, the difference between the two tasks mentioned
above could suggest the faster development of inhibitionof-return performances, and this would confirm the idea
of inhibition of return being a phylogenetically ancient
midbrain mechanism [17,29]. Previous study showed
that inhibition of return reaches near-adult levels by 6
months [30], while the number of anti-saccades increased
greatly during the toddler years [4].

To confirm that these are really anti-saccades and not saccades toward the target, we should include the latencies in
a comparable task with no cue. And the experiment using
the same condition should be applied to the same infants
except that the cue-target time interval is increased, following Guitton et al. [5]. Scerif et al. [4] chose 700 ms for
the cue-target time interval with reference to Guitton et al.
[5], and on the basis of 800 ms (to be specific, up to 100
ms post-target onset) distinguished between anti-saccades
and reactive saccades, which are stimulus driven, rather
than anticipatory. Although almost half of target looks
were classified as reactive saccades in Scerif et al. [4], these
may well include infant anticipatory responses.

Based on Figure 4 and 5, infants in all three age groups
made steeper head movements in the anti-saccade task,
while in the inhibition-of-return task we observed smooth
head movements especially in the younger two ages. In
other words, infants with the younger two ages made gentle head movement in the inhibition-of-return task,
although they could shift their head sharply with large
amplitude. First, we thought that it could be related to the
differences in the target condition. That is, in the inhibition-of-return task, subjects were given targets in both the
right and left visual fields, while in the anti-saccade task, a
target was presented only on the side opposite from that
in which the cue had appeared. In this regard, in the study
of the developmental course of inhibition of return in 3and 6-month-old babies, Clohessy et al. [30] examined

Performance during anti-saccade paradigm vs. inhibitionof-return paradigm
When we compare the responses toward the side opposite
the cue during the inhibition-of-return task with anti-saccades, one of the findings is that infants tend to move eyes
before their head towards the left in the inhibition-of-

the effect of whether the display had only one unilateral
or bilateral target. They noted that although there are
some differences of reaction and movement times
between the unilateral and bilateral trials, these differences are quite small. Movement time was defined as the
time between the subject's initial response and the time at
which he or she was fixated on the periphery. As this
movement time could be related to the gradient of movements in Figure 5, investigators' results suggest a rather
small effect of unilateral or bilateral target on the present
difference observed in head movement.
Another difference of experimental conditions could be
whether there is gap before the target presentation. Thus,
in the anti-saccade task, the fixation and cue disappeared
400 ms before the appearance of the eccentric target. On
the other hand, in the inhibition-of-return task, the central fixation was replaced by targets. In infants, gap conditions produced the fastest saccadic latencies compared to
the no-overlap and overlap conditions [8,31]. Thus far,
since no one has noted the gap effect on the head movement, it is not worth discussing observed differences
along this line.
Next, we speculate on the difference of neural substrates
between anti-saccade and inhibition-of-return tasks.
Cowie & Robinson [32], using electrical stimulation of
Macaques, demonstrate that both the superior colliculus
and gigantocellular reticular nucleus mediate head movements during gaze shifts. The collicular head movements
were predominantly associated with gaze shifts, while
stimulation of the medullary reticular region produced
ipsilateral head movements with no shift of gaze. It is supposed that head movement from the medullary reticular
site plays a role in several forms of head movement, such
as those which are concerned with postural reflexes,
started volitionally, and/or oriented to external events. We
speculate that present head movements in the inhibition
of return might correspond to the collicular head movements with the gaze shifts, since inhibition of return could
be strongly linked to the eye movement system of the
superior colliculus [17,29]. On the other hand, in the
anti-saccade task, the medullary reticular site contributes
more to the head movements than in the inhibition-ofreturn task. Signals which emerge from the medullary
reticular region lead to fast and reproducible movements
of the head [32]. Hence, although the oculomotor system
for anti-saccade is late-maturing, unlike in the inhibitionof-return task, from early infancy a direct command to the
head is possible. Thus, it would seem surprising if an
infant of a younger age were to show sharp head movements when shifting gazes. One view is that young children (< 8 years of age), who reportedly have difficulty in
the anti-saccade task [18], might accomplish anti-saccades
more easily in company with head movements.

Left/right asymmetry
Lastly, we comment on the left/right asymmetry effects
observed in turning behaviors. Anti-saccades occurred
faster towards the right than the left, while in the inhibition-of-return task the infant made faster leftward eye
movements than head movements in the same direction.
The observed asymmetry during the anti-saccade task
could be compatible with the physiological rightward bias
in triggering eye movements [33-35]. For example, Sheliga
et al. [33] found that the trajectory of the saccades deviated contralateral to the hemifield of stimulus presentation, and this deviation was larger to the right. On the
other hand, the leftward bias of eye movements observed
during the inhibition-of-return task could be related to
the right lateralized ventral frontoparietal network, which
might involve reorienting of attention to an unattended
location or a shift of attention from a cued location to an
uncued one [36]. Moreover, decreased performance was
observed only when transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) was applied over the right frontal eye field and only
when the cue was invalid, namely, when attention had to
be disengaged and shifted to the opposite hemifield [37].
Here, it is speculated that TMS over this region might
cause the disruption in shifting attention similar to the
way it disrupts eye movement preparation. This speculation and the functional asymmetry observed for interference with shifts of attention might support the present
leftward bias of eye movements in the inhibition-ofreturn task. The reason for these evident asymmetries
remains unknown.

Conclusion
We attempted to quantitatively examine the infant's eye
and head movements in response toward the side opposite the cue during the anti-saccade and inhibition-ofreturn tasks in the head-free condition. In the anti-saccade
paradigm, based on the response in accord with our criteria, the tendency was to a greater latency with a response
to the non-cued side. Moreover, these responses were
faster toward the right, which is a result consistent with
previous studies in children and adults.
We confirmed that younger infants move their head and
eyes together, often starting with the head in both tasks.
However, regarding the leftward movements during inhibition-of-return task, the latency of eye was smaller than
that of head. This kind of difference in latency was not
observed between eye and head movements in the antisaccade task. Besides, head movements of responses
observed in the anti-saccade task looked steeper than
those observed in the inhibition-of-return task. We consider that these differences between the two tasks were
because inhibition of return is based on an old, earlier
developing neural system. However, our discussion is

quite speculative in the development phase, so further
research is warranted to verify these preliminary findings.
