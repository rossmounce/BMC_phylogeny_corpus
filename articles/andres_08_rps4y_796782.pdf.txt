Abstract
Backgound: The RPS4 gene codifies for ribosomal protein S4, a very well-conserved protein
present in all kingdoms. In primates, RPS4 is codified by two functional genes located on both sex
chromosomes: the RPS4X and RPS4Y genes. In humans, RPS4Y is duplicated and the Y chromosome
therefore carries a third functional paralog: RPS4Y2, which presents a testis-specific expression
pattern.
Results: DNA sequence analysis of the intronic and cDNA regions of RPS4Y genes from species
covering the entire primate phylogeny showed that the duplication event leading to the second Ylinked copy occurred after the divergence of New World monkeys, about 35 million years ago.
Maximum likelihood analyses of the synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions revealed that
positive selection was acting on RPS4Y2 gene in the human lineage, which represents the first
evidence of positive selection on a ribosomal protein gene. Putative positive amino acid
replacements affected the three domains of the protein: one of these changes is located in the
KOW protein domain and affects the unique invariable position of this motif, and might thus have
a dramatic effect on the protein function.
Conclusion: Here, we shed new light on the evolutionary history of RPS4Y gene family, especially
on that of RPS4Y2. The results point that the RPS4Y1 gene might be maintained to compensate gene
dosage between sexes, while RPS4Y2 might have acquired a new function, at least in the lineage
leading to humans.

Background
RPS4 genes encode for the ribosomal protein small subunit 4 (29kD; 263 amino acids), a protein involved in
mRNA binding and located at the 40S/60S subunit interface of the small ribosomal subunit [1]. The RPS4 protein
is well-conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which

suggests strong functional constraints on structural evolution [2].
RPS4 is found on autosomes in all vertebrates except
mammals, which all have an X-linked copy (RPS4X).
Fisher et al. [3] found a Y-linked copy (RPS4Y) in humans,

and Omoe and Endo [4] postulated that RPS4Y was primate specific. However, this study was performed using
only great apes and rodents. Moreover, Jegalian and Page
[5] found a Y-linked copy in a marsupial species, the gray
short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica), and Skaletsky et al. [6] found this gene in the first X-degenerate block
suggesting that RPS4Y1 was present before mammalian
radiation. Recently, another Y-linked copy has been discovered on the human Y chromosome and has been
named RPS4Y2 [6] in order to distinguish it from the first
copy, which is now called RPS4Y1. The existence of two
paralogous copies is a unique feature of human RPS4
compared to other ribosomal proteins [3], and the presence of three copies is even more surprising. This characteristic is also present in Pan troglodytes, based on Ensembl
information [7]. The maintenance of RPS4Y copies in the
genome is unexpected as it would destroy the equimolarity among ribosomal proteins described by Meyuhas et al.
[8]. These authors showed that the expression of ribosomal protein genes must be regulated in a coordinated
way in order to ensure the correct assembly of the elements of the ribosomal complex.
RPS4Y1 is ubiquitously expressed and it is located in position p11.31 [3]. Watanabe et al. [9] demonstrated that
this gene is functional and functionally interchangeable
with RPS4X and, despite the lower expression level of
RPS4Y, both copies appeared to be necessary for correct
development [10,11]. Thus, RPS4X and RPS4Y proteins
are both found in primate male ribosomes while primate
female RPS4X genes escape inactivation. Bergen et al. [2]
found an increased substitution rate in great ape RPS4Y1
than in the X-linked copies, showing fewer functional
constraints on the Y genes.
RPS4Y2 shows a testis-specific expression pattern in
human lineage [[6]; Rozen, personal communication]
and it is located in position q11.223, a region associated
with infertility (AZFb). However, nothing is yet known
about RPS4Y2 essentiality, or about its functionality,
expression pattern in non-human primates, or the mechanisms associated with its survival. It might be possible
that RPS4Y2 gene had accumulated mutations that would
have improved an extra-ribosomal function already
present in the gene since it has been described that ribosomal proteins can perform other functions in addition to
their role in the protein synthesis [12]. In fact, Fisher et al.
[3] suggested that haploinsufficiency in RPS4 could contribute to Turner syndrome. This, in turn, led Wool [12] to
postulate that RPS4 could be involved in the regulation of
development.
Here we describe the evolutionary history of RPS4Y genes
in primates. The study was conducted by analyzing DNA
sequences from different species covering the entire pri-

mate phylogeny. Our aim was to elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms operating in the retention of these genes
and the possible role of positive selection in their evolution. We also estimated the age of the duplication event.
Finally, we have discussed the functional implications of
RPS4Y2 protein evolution.

Results
Genomic sequences from RPS4X, RPS4Y1 and RPS4Y2
genes were obtained from Ensembl. Surprisingly, human
and chimpanzee RPS4 genes on the Y chromosome were
approximately 5 times longer than RPS4X (fig. 1), which
is extraordinarily extended for a ribosomal gene (25 kb);
Yoshihama et al. [13] showed that RPS4Y is, in fact, the
largest ribosomal protein gene in the human genome.
Despite these differences, all three RPS4 genes had the
same number of exons and these were exactly of the same
length. The described protein domains -S4, ribosomal-S4e
and KOW- were also conserved. Length variations among
RPS4 copies were explained by different repeat content in
intronic regions. When Repeatmasker was applied, RPS4X
evidenced hardly any interspersed repeats (< 1.3%), while
for RPS4Y1 and RPS4Y2, about 30% of the sequence corresponded to repeat elements (Fig. 1). Long introns cause
a reduction in the level of expression since transcription
cost increases, therefore purifying selection serves to
maintain intron length [14,15]. A possible reduction in
expression levels might explain why only 15% of the RPS4
proteins found in male ribosomes are from the RPS4Y1
gene [10]. Besides RPS4 genes, a RPS4Y retrotransposed
pseudogene, containing the 7 exons but disrupted by stop
codons, was also detected on both human chromosome
16 and its chimpanzee homologue (Fig. 1).
We were able to amplify the RPS4Y1 and RPS4Y2 introns
3 and 6 in all great apes analyzed (Pan troglodytes (Ptr),
Gorilla gorilla (Ggo), Pongo pygmaeus (Ppy)) and Old
World monkeys (Macaca fuscata (Mfu), Mandrillus sphinx
(Msp)). New World monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis (Sbo),
Callithrix jacchus (Cja), Callicebus moloch (Cmo)) and
strepsirrhines (Eulemur fulvus (Efu), Eulemur macaco
(Ema)) produced sequences from only a single copy. This
pattern was supported by FISH analyses as two signals
could be detected in great apes and OWM Y-chromosome
while NWM Y-chromosome presented hybridization signal in one single site (data not shown). The phylogenetic
tree from concatenated DNA sequences of introns 3 and 6
showed two different well-defined clusters, one for each
duplicated gene copy, suggesting the independent evolution of RPS4Y1 and RPS4Y2 after the duplication event.
NWM and strepsirrhine RPS4Y copies stayed out of the
clusters (Fig. 2). When we analyzed intron 3 and intron 6
independently, we obtained similar results. In addition,
from the synonymous substitutions of the intronic
sequences we estimated that the duplication event proba-

bly took place about 35 million years ago, which fitted in
with the time between NWM and OWM divergence, estimated at between 25 and 40 million years ago [16]. All
these results therefore indicate that RPS4Y duplication
should have been generated after the divergence of NWM
(Fig. 3).
Pseudogene sequences were identified in great apes,
OWM and NWM, but not in strepsirrhines. These findings
suggested that the RPS4Y pseudogene was generated after
the divergence of strepsirrhines but before the divergence
of NWM. Since NWM presented these sequences, it can be
inferred that the pseudogene derived from the ancestral
RPS4Y copy.
RPS4Y1, RPS4Y2 and RPS4X GenBank cDNA sequences
from great apes and OWM produced a phylogenetic tree
with 3 distinct clusters (Fig. 4). When we included pseudogene sequences from this study in the analysis, a phylogenetic tree with 4 well-defined clusters was generated;
RPS4X sequences constituted a distantly separated cluster

while pseudogene sequences were included in RPS4Y1
group (data not shown).
We conducted a number of relative rate tests to detect
putative deviations from the molecular clock expectations. For cDNA sequences, the results suggested that,
using RPS4X sequences as the outgroup, only combinations involving pseudogene sequences produced statistically significant results (p-value < 0.04). With respect to
intronic concatenated sequences, macaque was the only
lineage to generate differences when comparing RPS4Y2
sequences and using NWM sequence as the outgroup (pvalue < 0.04). The same results were obtained after the
FDR correction for multiple tests (data not shown).
To determine the effect of natural selection on coding
gene regions, we applied a number of maximum likelihood codon models implemented in the PAML software
package [17]. To control the false discovery rate for multiple tests we applied the method described in [18].

was too short. Boostrap values (10,000 replicates) are shown on each branch.

Branch models
We applied the one ratio (M0) model -which assumes the
same ω ratio for the complete tree- and the free-ratio (FR)
model -which allows for different ω ratios across treebranches. We compared the two models using likelihood
ratio test (LRT) to determine whether our data was compatible with homogeneous selective pressure across the
branches. Whenever RPS4Y2 sequences were considered,
FR fitted the data significantly better than M0. Yet for
RPS4Y1 and RPS4X, the M0 model could not be rejected
(Table 1). When human sequences were not considered in
the analyses, M0 fitted the data better than FR, even when
RPS4Y2 sequences were included (Table 1), showing that
the human RPS4Y2 lineage has evolved under a different
ω ratio. To confirm this result, we also applied the tworatio model (M2b) -which allows for different ω ratios in
selected branches of the tree- and compared this with M0
model. We chose human and macaque RPS4Y2 as possible foreground branches based on the exclusive amino
acid substitutions of each protein observed in the protein
alignment (see Additional file 1) and the distribution of
non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions shown

in Fig. 4. M2b fitted the data better than M0 in both analyses (data not shown). However, only ω value for human
RPS4Y2 was greater than 1 (ωHsa could not be estimated
since there were no synonymous substitutions), showing
the action of positive selection in this branch. Macaque
RPS4Y2 has evolved at a greater ω than the other branches
(0.6147 and 0.0581, respectively), except for human
RPS4Y2, which could indicate a relaxation of purifying
selection in this branch (data not shown).
Site models
Site-specific likelihood models [19,20] make it possible to
detect variable selective pressures across sites. Three
nested models were performed: M1 (neutral) and M2
(selection); M0 (one ratio) and M3 (discrete); and M7
(beta) and M8 (beta&ω). None of the LRT tests was significant; we therefore found no evidence for sites evolving
under positive selection across the different species.
Branch-site models
If positive selection only affects certain sites of specific lineages, previous models would probably not have been

able to detect them. We therefore applied the more realistic branch-site models A and B [21], which allow ω ratio
to vary among sites and lineages. Test 1 for Model A compared this model with the site-specific model M1 (neutral); test 2 compared model A against null model A.
Model B was compared with the site-specific model M3
(discrete, K = 2). As above, we chose human and macaque
RPS4Y2 as foreground branches. We found that models A
(test 1) and B only fitted the data significantly better than
simpler models when human RPS4Y2 lineage was used as
the foreground branch (Table 2 for model A); this indicates that positive selection acted on some sites of the
human RPS4Y2 gene. Test 2 confirmed this result when
RPS4Y1 and RPS4Y2 sequences were considered.

as positively selected sites. When RPS4Y1 sequences were
also analyzed, only amino acids at positions 70 and 185
were chosen as positively selected. Finally, when all the
sequences were considered (RPS4Y1, RPS4Y2 and RPS4X)
the same 5 positions plus amino acid 104 were identified
as putative targets of positive selection (Table 2). All positions were still significant after the correction for multiple
tests (data not shown). Positions 70 and 185 were identified in all sequence sets and had the highest posterior
probabilities; moreover, these two positions were corroborated by conservative test 2. Amino acid replacements in
the human RPS4Y2 lineage involved all 3 RPS4 protein
domains (S4, Ribosomal-S4e and KOW) (Table 3; see
Additional file 1).

to determine the putative correlation expected under the
neutral model. We did not found significant differences
between RPS4Y1 and RPS4Y2 (Fisher exact test, p = 0.54),
although the two Y-linked RPS4 copies evolved at different rates than the X copy (p < 0.0005).
To study in more detail the evolution of the human lineage we estimated the nucleotide divergences between
human and chimpanzee RPS4Y1, RPS4Y2 and RPS4X
cDNA, intronic and pseudogene sequences (Table 4). It
should be highlighted that the Ka/Ks ratio of RPS4X was
zero due to the absence of non-synonymous changes; this
was a result of the strong functional constraints in this
gene. As far as RPS4Y1 was concerned, the increase in both
the Ka/Ks ratio (ω = 0.062) and Ks (0.0270) with respect to
RPS4X pointed to a relaxation in purifying selection. This
relaxation could also be observed in the intronic
sequences, as the intronic divergence estimate (Ki) was
higher for RPS4Y1 (and similar to RPS4Y2 and pseudogene, with Ki values of 0.0142, 0.0152 and 0.0181, respectively) than for RPS4X (Ki = 0.0076). Finally, and as
expected, RPS4Y2 exhibited a Ka/Ks ratio larger than 1 (ω

= 2.9477) due to the elevated Ka value (0.0129) since the
Ks value (Ks = 0.0044) was similar to that of RPS4X (Ks =
0.0038). These results could not be explained by a relaxation in purifying selection (i.e. by a reduction in functional constraints) and pointed towards the action of
positive selection in human RPS4Y2 reinforcing the
former PAML analyses.

Discussion
First efforts to describe mammalian RPS4 phylogeny suggested that RPS4 moved to the X chromosome before
mammalian radiation while RPS4 Y-linked copy was primate specific [2]. However, the discovery of a Rps4 Ylinked copy in the non-primate species M. domestica [5]
and the location of human RPS4Y in an X-degenerate
block [6] suggest that RPS4X and RPS4Y were present in
the ancestral mammalian sex chromosomes but were lost
in the Y-chromosome of most lineages during the mammalian evolution [22]. Here we have demonstrated that
species along all primate phylogeny maintained the
RPS4Y1 gene and that the second Y-linked copy was originated from the duplication of the RPS4Y1 gene after the

divergence of NWM but before the radiation of OWM
(Fig. 3 shows a scheme of RPS4 evolution in mammals).
The loss of RPS4Y1 gene in most mammals is a result of
the degeneration, in both size and gene content, of the Ychromosome during evolution. It seems that most of the
genes retained are related to male-specific functions [23].
Then, the maintenance of ribosomal proteins in primate
Y chromosome is unexpected and the mechanisms operating under their retention are still unknown. Since it has
been demonstrated that RPS4Y1 maintains the ribosomal
activity and it is essential for viability, a possible explanation for its preservation might be the compensation of
gene dosage between sexes. Since genes on the X chromosome are inactivated to overcome sex differences, ribos-

omal proteins on the X chromosome need a mechanism
to achieve equimolarity with other ribosomal proteins. In
non-primate mammals, the active RPS4X in females and
the sole RPS4X in males therefore need to be more fully
expressed than autosomal genes. The existence of a functional Y-linked copy in primates has led RPS4X to escape
inactivation, as RPS4Y entails gene dosage compensation.
In fact, in humans, the other three ribosomal X chromosome protein genes (RPL10, RPL36A, and RPL39) achieve
equimolarity by using functional processed copies
(RPL10L, RPL36AL, and RPL39L) elsewhere in the
genome [24]. However, this hypothesis could not explain
the maintenance of the RPS4Y2 gene.

Gene duplication is a major force for the rise of new gene
functions in evolution. The average rate of gene duplication is 0.01 per gene per million years [25]. However, the
most common fate of duplicate pairs is that one of the
copies becomes a pseudogene by the fixation of deleterious mutations, and will finally be lost in the genome.
Half-lives of duplicated genes that finally disappear tend
to range from 1 to 17 million years [25]. We have shown
that RPS4Y2 emerged in the primate phylogeny between
the divergence of NWM and OWM. Despite the fact that
the expression pattern of RPS4Y2 in non-human primates
is still unknown, the absence of stop codons in the open
reading frame suggests that the gene is still active, at least
in Mfu and Ptr. We can therefore undoubtedly discard a
pseudogenization process since the gene has remained in
the genome for approximately 35 million years.
On the other hand, duplicated genes can be retained in
the genome after neofunctionalization – when a completely new function is acquired [26] – or subfunctionalization – when either the two genes become specialized in
different tissues or at different developmental stages [27]
or when the ancestral gene had several functions and the
duplicates become specialized for certain of these functions. It has been found that positive selection plays an

important role in duplicated gene retention in mammalian genomes [28] and is active in both events. The testis
and prostate-specific expression found in human RPS4Y2
points to a subfunctionalization event. This hypothesis is
supported by the fact that the human RPS4Y2 promoter
presents the oligopyrimidine tract as being disrupted by a
mutation (data not shown). This tract is the only feature
present in all ubiquitously expressed human ribosomal
proteins [13] and its disruption would account for the
specificity of RPS4Y2 expression in humans. Interestingly,
the oligopyrimidine tract of the promoter in chimpanzee
RPS4Y2 has remained untouched, which would suggest
ubiquitous expression in this species. Studies of RPS4Y2
expression patterns in all primate lineages are needed to
elucidate whether this expression is testis-specific as in
humans or ubiquitous as suggested by our observations
relating to the chimpanzee RPS4Y2 promoter. If humanspecific testis restricted expression is confirmed, RPS4Y2
would compile all the characteristics mainly associated
with human speciation – testis-specific expression and
human-specific expression pattern and function [29].
However, the detection of positive selection and the relaxation of purifying selection suggest that RPS4Y2 copy has
either undergone a neofunctionalization process or been
subjected to a functional specialization, at least in the
human lineage. We found that model A (test 1) pointed
to six positively-selected positions, while test 2, which is
more powerful, but very conservative, confirmed positive
selection in only two of the amino acid positions. Since
current statistical methods are very conservative at the
moment of detecting weak positive selection, some of the
other positions identified by test 1 may also have been
affected by positive selection.
It is not clear which specific activity of RPS4Y2 could be
affected since the six positively-selected amino acids
involve all of the protein domains. There were three
amino acids in the S4 domain (amino acids 68, 70, 87),
two in the ribosomal_S4E domain (104, 108), and one in

the KOW domain (185). All changes in the S4 domain
were conservative, while changes in the ribosomal_S4E
and KOW domains were radical. Moreover, the amino
acid affected by positive selection in the KOW domain of
RPS4Y2 is the only residue conserved in the KOW motif –
a glycine in position 11 – [30]. In human RPS4Y2, this
invariable glycine residue has been replaced by an
arginine, and so the function of the domain may be dramatically affected. Mutations in human RPS4Y2 gene,
therefore, may have improved an extra-ribosomal function that was already present in the ancestral gene. On the
other hand, RPS4Y2 location in the azoospermia region
AZFb – where large microdeletions have been described to
cause azoospermia, even if the genes responsible for this
phenotype have not yet been identified [31] – and its testis-specific expression pattern point to a possible connection between RPS4Y2 and fertility. These features suggest
that RPS4Y2 may have acquired a new spermatogenesisrelated function in human male lineage; this would be
consistent with the observed excess of sperm-specific
genes affected by positive selection [32]. In order to elucidate the putative effects of the amino acid changes on the
protein function, its interactions within the ribosomal
complex, and the binding to RNA, it is necessary to carry
out further functional and biochemical studies. It is especially interesting to elucidate if RPS4Y2 maintains the
ribosomal protein function. If so, this is the first time that
positive selection acting on ribosomal protein is unambiguously demonstrated. Only one recent study [33] suggested that three ribosomal protein genes (one in the
human genome and two in the chimpanzee genome)
might be positively selected, but signs of positive selection
were weak and it was not possible to distinguish between
positive selection and a relaxation of selective constraints.
Complementation analyses of a rodent Rps4 knockout
mutant with human RPS4Y2 gene would help to elucidate
if this gene still conserves its original function or whether,
according to the evidences presented in this work, it has
acquired a functional specialization related to an extraribosomal function or even a new function. Moreover,
studies to correlate testis histopathology with different
combinations of loss of genes located in AZF regions
would reveal if RPS4Y2 has acquired a fertility-related
function.

Conclusion
In conclusion, using comparative sequence analyses, we
were able to establish the genealogy of RPS4Y genes in primate phylogeny, corroborating the preservation of the
first RPS4Y gene in all primate infraorders and dating the
origin of RPS4Y2 as occurring between the divergence of
NWM and OWM. RPS4Y1 maintenance seems to be the
result of a mechanism for compensating gene dosage
between sexes. On the other hand, we detected that the
human RPS4Y2 gene evolved under positive selection.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/142

The results and evidences presented here point to the
acquisition of a non-ribosomal function -an extra-ribosomal or a completely new male-specific function- of the
RPS4Y2 in the human lineage.

Methods
Samples
Samples of Homo sapiens (Hsp), great apes -Pan troglodytes
(Ptr), Gorilla gorilla (Ggo), and Pongo pygmaeus (Ppy) -,
Old World monkeys (OWM) -Macaca fuscata (Mfu), and
Mandrillus sphinx (Msp) -, New World monkeys (NWM) Saimiri boliviensis (Sbo), Callithrix jacchus (Cja), and Callicebus moloch (Cmo) -, and strepsirrhines -Eulemur fulvus
(Efu), and Eulemur macaco (Ema)- were provided from the
INPRIMAT sample collection. For tissue and blood samples DNA was extracted using the Qiagen tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's
instructions. Initial amounts were 25 mg for muscle tissues and 100 μl for blood samples. DNA from cell lines
was also provided by INPRIMAT DNA collection (see
Additional file 2).
Amplification and sequencing
Intron 3 and intron 6 of RPS4Y genes were found suitable
for amplification, since they allowed the location of both
forward and reverse primers on exonic sequences to
amplify the full intron (Fig. 1). Primers were designed to
be male specific and to distinguish between RPS4Y2 and
RPS4Y1 in different primate species. We also designed
another pair of primers to amplify a complete 7-exon
mRNA RPS4Y pseudogene (Fig. 1). The names and
sequences of the oligonucleotides are shown in Additional file 3. We have described the PCR conditions, fragments resulting from the use of different primer
combinations, and species specificity in Additional file 4.

PCR products were purified using the GFX PCR DNA and
Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences UK
Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK). Both strands were
sequenced from the purified products using forward and
reverse PCR primers (sequencing conditions are described
in Additional file 4).
Sequence analysis
Genomic sequences and information concerning human
and chimpanzee RPS4 genes were taken from Ensembl
[7]. We used the RepeatMasker v3.1.6. program [34] to
detect interspersed repeats in Ensembl genomic
sequences.

We handled DNA sequences from this study and protein
and cDNA sequences obtained from GenBank (see Additional files 5 and 6 for accession numbers) with BioEdit
v6.0.7 [35]. Multiple alignments were obtained by Clustal

W [36] or DiAlign2 [37] and subsequently manually
edited to minimize the number of gaps.
Once aligned, we applied Gblocks [38] to eliminate
poorly aligned positions and divergent regions of our
intronic sequences in order to obtain reliable blocks that
were suitable for phylogenetic analysis. We used DnaSP
v4.0 [39] to estimate nucleotide diversity and descriptive
statistics to examine the different sequence sets.
For each alignment, we selected the nucleotide substitution model that best fitted the data among 56 different
evolutionary models based on the Akaike Information
Criteria approach using Modeltest 3.6 [40]. We constructed a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) based on the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [41], using PAUP*v4.0b10 [42].
Confidence in the resulting relationships was assessed
using 10,000 bootstrap replicates [43]. We also performed
relative rate tests on the trees by applying the RRTree program [44], which compares substitution rates between
lineages of DNA sequences, relative to a particular outgroup. TreeView [45] was used to visualize trees.
Analysis of the impact of positive or negative selection on
DNA coding region was conducted using Phylogenetic
Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) v3.12 [17] and
DnaSP [39] software. We applied the different codon substitution models implemented in codeml (Branch Models, Site Models and Branch-Site Models). We applied a
FDR correction for multiple tests in all analyses.
We estimated the time of the duplication event (Td) from
the mean number of synonymous substitutions per site
( K s ) among all paralogous combinations. For each paralogous copy, the synonymous substitution rate (r) was estimated for all possible pairs of species, as r = Ks/2*Ts,
where Ks is the number of synonymous substitutions per
site and Ts is the divergence time for each pair of species.
For Ts, we took the minimum and maximum values from
Goodman et al. [16]. Average rates (ř) for both the minimum and maximum values were obtained from the slope
of a regression analysis. We then applied the equation Td
= K s /2*ř to find the estimated duplication time range.
