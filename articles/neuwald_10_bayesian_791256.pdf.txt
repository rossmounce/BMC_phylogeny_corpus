Bayesian classification of residues associated with
protein functional divergence: Arf and Arf-like
GTPases
Andrew F Neuwald

Abstract
Background: Certain residues within proteins are highly conserved across very distantly related organisms, yet
their (presumably critical) structural or mechanistic roles are completely unknown. To obtain clues regarding such
residues within Arf and Arf-like (Arf/Arl) GTPases–which function as on/off switches regulating vesicle trafficking,
phospholipid metabolism and cytoskeletal remodeling–I apply a new sampling procedure for comparative
sequence analysis, termed multiple category Bayesian Partitioning with Pattern Selection (mcBPPS).
Results: The mcBPPS sampler classified sequences within the entire P-loop GTPase class into multiple categories
by identifying those evolutionarily-divergent residues most likely to be responsible for functional specialization.
Here I focus on categories of residues that most distinguish various Arf/Arl GTPases from other GTPases. This
identified residues whose specific roles have been previously proposed (and in some cases corroborated
experimentally and that thus serve as positive controls), as well as several categories of co-conserved residues
whose possible roles are first hinted at here. For example, Arf/Arl/Sar GTPases are most distinguished from other
GTPases by a conserved aspartate residue within the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) and by co-conserved
residues nearby that, together, can form a network of salt-bridge and hydrogen bond interactions centered on the
GTPase active site. Residues corresponding to an N-[VI] motif that is conserved within Arf/Arl GTPases may play a
role in the interswitch toggle characteristic of the Arf family, whereas other, co-conserved residues may modulate
the flexibility of the guanine binding loop. Arl8 GTPases conserve residues that strikingly diverge from those
typically found in other Arf/Arl GTPases and that form structural interactions suggestive of a novel interswitch
toggle mechanism.
Conclusions: This analysis suggests specific mutagenesis experiments to explore mechanisms underlying GTP
hydrolysis, nucleotide exchange and interswitch toggling within Arf/Arl GTPases. More generally, it illustrates how
the mcBPPS sampler can complement traditional evolutionary analyses by providing an objective, quantitative and
statistically rigorous way to explore protein functional-divergence in molecular detail. Because the sampler classifies
the input sequences at the same time, it can be used to generate subgroup profiles, in which functionallydivergent categories of residues are annotated automatically.

Phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) GTPases bind to guanine nucleotide via amino acid residues that show up at
the sequence level as highly conserved motifs [1]. These

motifs include: (i) a Walker A (Gx 4 GK[ST]) motif [2]
corresponding to the P-loop [3], which binds to guanine
nucleotide phosphate groups; (ii) a Walker B (DxxG)
motif, the conserved glycine (G) and aspartate (D) of
which (respectively) sense the g phosphate of GTP and
bind (via a water molecule) to the Mg++ ion that coordinates with guanine nucleotide phosphate groups; and

threonine residue that likewise coordinates with the
Mg++ ion.
An important subgroup of P-loop GTPases is the Raslike superfamily [4] (termed here the Ras-like GTPases),
members of which function as signaling pathway on-off
switches. A key characteristic of eukaryotic Ras-like
GTPases is their association both with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which turn them on by
mediating the exchange of GTP for GDP, and with
GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which turn them off
by promoting the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. GAPs and
GEFs typically occur within multi-domain proteins that,
together with Ras-like GTPases and other associated
proteins, function as integrated circuits [5] to orchestrate cellular processes in response to environmental
and developmental signals. When Ras-like GTPases are
activated in response to appropriate upstream signals,
they associate with various ‘effectors’ that propagate signals to downstream components of the pathway; when
deactivated these signals are terminated. The GTPase
on- or off-state is communicated to downstream components through conformational changes within the socalled switch I and II regions, which detect the presence
or absence of the g phosphate of bound guanine nucleotide (Figure 1A). Three major subgroups of Ras-like
GTPases are (i) the Ras, Rab, Rac/Rho and Ran
GTPases, (ii) the Arf, Arf-like (Arl), and Sar GTPases,
and (iii) a subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins [6].
The existence of mysterious, as yet unidentified molecular mechanisms associated with Arf/Arl GTPases is
suggested by the fact that they strikingly conserve specific residues whose functions, thus far, are completely
unknown. Often such residues are shared by GTPases
that have diverged from a common ancestor more than
a billion years ago and that vary in their interactions
with other cellular components, in their kinetics and
localization, in their cellular functions and other properties–suggesting that the roles of these residues transcend
functions or properties specific to a particular protein
and instead reflect general mechanisms shared by otherwise dissimilar proteins. P-loop GTPases have diverged
into multiple ‘functional states’, each of which is subject
to somewhat different selective pressures due to their
specialized cellular roles and mechanisms. Hence, the
conservation of certain divergent residues within each
subgroup reflects important structural or mechanistic
distinctions between these subgroups.
Here a new Bayesian statistical approach is used to
infer, from patterns of sequence conservation and divergence, various categories of co-conserved residues associated with Arf/Arl GTPase functional divergence. This
approach is based upon an earlier procedure, termed
Bayesian Partitioning with Pattern Selection (BPPS)
[7,8]. The BPPS procedure partitions a multiple

structural features shared by Arf/Arl/Sar GTPases. In yellow are the
side chains of six residues that are highly distinctive of Arf/Arl/Sar
GTPases and that, within the GTP-bound state, often form the
network of interactions shown. Within the Switch I region is shown
a threonine residue (magenta side chain) that is conserved in the
TRAFAC subclass of P-loop GTPases and that coordinates with the
Mg++ ion associated with bound GTP. The structure shown is that
of Arf1 bound to GTP (pdb_id: 1o3y; 1.50 Ǻ resolution) [57]. The
Switch I and II regions (red and orange backbones, respectively) and
the a3 helix (dark yellow backbone) are indicated. (B) Schematic
representation of a contrast alignment, which reveals the sequence
features distinguishing one group of proteins (termed the
foreground) from related, evolutionarily-divergent proteins (termed
the background). Red and gray horizontal bars represent sequences
belonging to the foreground and background, respectively. Black
vertical bars represent residues that are conserved in the
foreground and white vertical bars represent corresponding nonconserved positions in the background. The histogram above these
columns indicates the relative strengths of the selective constraints
associated with evolutionary divergence of the foreground
sequences from the background sequences. (C) Correspondence
between a phylogenetic tree and a hyperpartition. A rooted tree is
shown both as a graph and as a hyperpartition. In the
hyperpartition, each column corresponds to one node in the tree
such that the ‘+’ rows in that column correspond to that node’s
subtree, which serves as the foreground, whereas the ‘-’ rows in that
column correspond to the rest of the parent node’s subtree, which
serves as the background; the remaining (non-participating) nodes
in that column are labeled with an ‘o’. Internal nodes (shown in
blue) correspond to ‘miscellaneous’ subgroups, that is to sequences
that are assigned to a subtree (e.g., a family), but not to a leaf node
(e.g., a specific subfamily).

sequence alignment into two, functionally divergent subgroups by identifying a pattern that is conserved in one
of the subgroups (termed the foreground), but that is
non-conserved in the other subgroup (termed the background). In principle, it does this by first arbitrarily partitioning the input sequence alignment into foreground
and background sub-alignments and by choosing an
arbitrary pattern associated with the foreground
sequences. (In practice, heuristics are used to speed up
the procedure by finding a more meaningful starting
point. Moreover, in order to focus on a particular protein of interest, either one sequence or a few closelyrelated sequences are pre-assigned to the foreground
partition; such seed sequences serve a role analogous to
that of the query in a database search.) Next an iterative
strategy, called Gibbs sampling [9], is used to reassign
sequences to either the foreground or background partition and to add or remove pattern residues with probability proportional to the degree to which such changes
improve the underlying statistical model [7]. This process continues until convergence on an optimum or
nearly optimum ‘partition-pattern pair’, which corresponds to two groups of proteins that have diverged
from each other at pattern positions, as is shown schematically in Figure 1B.
The procedure used here generalizes this single category BPPS sampler into a multiple category (mc)BPPS
sampler by introducing the notion of a hyperpartition,
which consists of an N × M table of symbols and
which is best understood by converting a phylogenetic
tree into the corresponding hyperpartition, as is illustrated in Figure 1C. From this phylogenetic perspective: there are an equal number of rows and columns
(i.e., N = M); each row (i) or column (j) corresponds
to a specific node of the tree; and the table’s symbols
indicate the phylogenetic relationships between nodes.
If node i belongs to the subtree starting from node j,
then the cell in row i and column j contains a ‘+’; if it
belongs to a sibling subtree, then the cell contains a ‘-’;
and if it is somewhere else in the tree, then the cell
contains an ‘o’. In other words, for each column, the
‘+’ rows correspond to a clade that shares a most
recent common ancestor with the clade or clades indicated by the ‘-’ rows.
From the mcBPPS sampler’s perspective, however, the
N rows correspond to N distinct subgroups, and the M
columns to M distinct BPPS analyses, where each analysis assigns each of the N protein subgroups either to
one of two functionally-divergent groups–that is, to a
foreground (’+’) or background (’-’) partition–or to
neither group–that is to a third, ‘non-participating
sequence’ (’o’) partition. Based on these assignments, the
sampler optimally assigns the input sequences to the N
subgroups (the rows) and, at the same time, finds M

Page 3 of 17

patterns that optimally differentiate the foreground from
the background (based on the hyperpartition specification) for each of the M functionally-divergent categories
(the columns).
Although the phylogenetic relationships between subgroups typically are used to create a hyperpartition,
strict conformity to a phylogenetic tree is not required.
Subgroups of proteins from different clades can, in principle, share certain biochemical properties inherited
from an ancestor of both clades, but lost in other members of both clades due to a relaxation of selective constraints upon them. Thus the hyperpartition allows
arbitrary comparisons between groups, as long as certain
restrictions are met–such as that each row (i.e., subgroup) includes at least one foreground assignment, that
no two rows share identical foreground assignments,
and that M ≥ N.
Each subgroup is associated with a ‘seed alignment’
consisting of one or more sequences (typically no
more than a dozen) that are known to belong to and
that thus help define that subgroup (by serving as
Bayesian priors). The seed sequences are required to
remain in their assigned subgroups while the sampler
iteratively reassigns the remaining sequences to subgroups and adds or removes pattern residues with
probability proportional to the degree to which the
evolving patterns distinguish the foreground from the
background sequences for each category. At the same
time, it automatically removes sequences that otherwise tend to obscure an analysis by explicitly modeling
miscellaneous categories and aberrant sequences (i.e.,
pseudogene products and other non-functional homologs). The mcBPPS sampler thus sets up a stringent
competition between the multiple categories of functional constraints imposed on the input sequences to
thereby more precisely define both those co-conserved
residues most distinctive of and those sequences
belonging to each subgroup. Given our focus here, this
identifies key residues associated with Arf/Arl GTPases
functional divergence.

Results and Discussion
The mcBPPS analysis that is described here is based on
the P-loop GTPase hyperpartition given in Figure 2. For
each row (subgroup) of this hyperpartition, the mcBPPS
procedure outputs ‘contrast alignments’–one alignment
for each column in that row that is assigned to the foreground (’+’) partition. The full set of contrast alignments
that were generated by the sampler in this way and that
are most relevant to Arf/Arl GTPase functional divergence are given in Additional File 1. In the following
sections we explore and interpret these alignments in
the light of available structural and biochemical
information.

Features that Arf/Arl/Sar share with other P-loop and Raslike GTPases

The Arf1 contrast alignments shown in Figures 3A-B
reveal (previously identified) co-conserved residue patterns
characteristic of two major P-loop GTPase categories
(within which are included Arf/Arl GTPases), namely
transcription factor related (TRAFAC) [4] and Ras-like
GTPases. The TRAFAC patterns [1] include the Walker A
and B motifs (G-K-[ST] and D-x-x-G), a guanine binding
loop motif ([NT]-K-x-D), and the switch I threonine residue (Thr48Arf1) that coordinates with a GTP-bound Mg++
ion. The Ras-like patterns include: (i) a switch II glutamine
residue (Gln71Arf1) involved in GTP hydrolysis [10]; (ii) a
glycine or alanine residue (Gly69Arf1 in Figure 3B) within
the Walker B motif (D-x-G-G); (iii) a glycine residue
(Gly50Arf1) bordering the switch I region that may function as a hinge for switch I conformational change; (iv)
five residues (Arg19Arf1, Leu21Arf1, Trp66Arf1, Tyr81Arf1
and Phe82Arf1) that, though dispersed in the sequence,
mutually interact near the switch II C-terminal region and
that, within Rab and Ran GTPases, can form a “chargedipole pocket” configuration that is associated with formation of an unusual, outward-oriented switch II a-helix
[11]; and (v) a glycine or alanine residue (Ala125Arf1) that
directly precedes the guanine binding loop ([GA]-[NT]-Kx-D). These patterns provide a sequence and structural
context within which to better evaluate the following Arf/
Arl functionally-divergent features.
Features distinguishing Arf/Arl/Sar from other P-loop
GTPases

Figure 3C highlights the conserved residues that most
distinguish Arf/Arl and Sar GTPases from other P-loop

GTPases. For this category, heterotrimeric G protein a
subunits were omitted because they share some, but not
all Arf/Arl/Sar characteristic features [6] (see below),
which thus tends to obscure the analysis. These features
correspond to about a dozen residue positions, five of
which typically form–within the GTP-bound state–a
network of salt bridge interactions (Figure 4A-F) centered on an aspartate residue within the P-loop
(Asp26Arf1 in Figures 3C and 4A) and on the Walker B
glycine residue (Gly70Arf1).
An Arf/Arl/Sar salt bridge network

The previously noted [12-14] conserved P-loop aspartate
(Asp26 in Figure 4A) appears to be a key residue within
the Arf/Arl salt bridge network. Within Ras GTPase,
this residue position corresponds to a P-loop glycine
(Gly12 in H-Ras), mutation of which to any other amino
acid except proline inhibits GTP hydrolysis and thus
leads to a constitutively active GTP-bound state [15]
that promotes oncogenesis by continually up-regulating
downstream pathways. Moreover, a glycine to aspartate
mutation is one of the most frequent oncogenic mutations associated with the K-ras gene in humans [16,17]
and, indeed, is the most frequent mutation found in
human tumors [18]. Rho, Ran and Ga family GTPases
also typically conserve a glycine at this position and,
among all P-loop GTPases, aspartate very rarely occurs
at this position outside of the Arf, Arl and Sar families–
a notable exception being the dynein light intermediate
chain family. Less than 0.1% (224 out of 258,895) of the
remaining P-loop GTPases identified in this analysis
harbor an aspartate at this position.
Within many crystal structures of Arf/Arl/Sar
GTPases (Figure 4A-F), the P-loop aspartate forms
hydrogen bonds with two co-conserved arginine residues–one in the Switch II region and another associated
with the a3 helix (Arg75Arf1 and Arg99Arf1, respectively,
in Figure 4A). Each of these arginine residues, in turn,
forms hydrogen bonds with two other co-conserved
acidic residues, both of which occur within or near the
a3 helix (Asp96Arf1 and Glu106Arf1, respectively). The
switch II arginine residue (e.g., Arg75Arf1) also typically
hydrogen bonds to the backbone oxygen of the Walker
B (D-x-x-G) motif glycine residue (e.g., Gly70Arf1); this
glycine senses the g-phosphate group of bound GTP via
its backbone NH group. A co-conserved tryptophan
residue within the Switch II region (e.g., Trp78Arf1) likewise forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen of
another co-conserved glycine residue (Gly69 Arf1 ); the
backbone C = O group of this glycine participates in a
peptide bond with the g-phosphate-sensing backbone
NH group of the Walker B glycine. The tryptophan also
packs up against the Arf/Arl/Sar Switch II arginine and,
in many GTP-bound structures, appears to form two
CH-π interactions with it. These three co-conserved

Figure 3 Contrast alignments showing distinguishing sequence features of Arf/Arl GTPases. This is the mcBPPS program output file
corresponding to the Arf1-related subgroup (second row in Fig. 2); the sequences shown correspond to the seed alignment, which consists of
Arf1 GTPases from distinct phyla. (A) Conserved residues distinguishing the TRAFAC subclass of P-loop GTPases from non-GTPases (column 3 in
Fig. 2). (B) Conserved residues distinguishing Ras-like from other TRAFAC GTPases (column 6). (C) Conserved residues distinguishing Arf/Arl/Sar
GTPases from other P-loop GTPases (except for Ga subunits)(column 12). (D) Conserved residues distinguishing typical Arf/Arl GTPases (i.e.,
excluding Arl6 and Arl8) from Sar and Ga GTPases (column 13). In each alignment, the Arf1 seed sequences are shown explicitly, whereas
directly below these only the most conserved residue patterns in the foreground (relative to the background) are shown. Directly below this the
corresponding weighted residue frequencies are shown (denoted by ‘wt_res_freqs’). Weighted frequencies are given in integer tenths, where an
‘8’, for example, indicates that the corresponding residue occurs in 80%-90% of the (foreground) sequences. Below this the conserved patterns
and their weighted frequencies for the background sequences are shown (in gray). The selective constraints imposed on the foreground (relative
to the background) at pattern positions are indicated by the histograms above each alignment.

Figure 4 Structural features associated with co-conserved residues that are distinctive of Arf/Arl/Sar GTPases and that form a network
of salt bridges. Arf/Arl/Sar GTPases features correspond to column 12 in Fig. 2 and to the contrast alignment in Fig. 3C. See the legend to Fig.
1A for side chain and backbone color schemes. Shown in gray are the side chains of residues at an (unclassified) position within the a3-helix
that weakly conserves an acidic amino acid which also participates in the Arf/Arl salt-bridge network. (A) Arf1 + GTP (pdb_id: 1o3y; 1.50 Ǻ)[57].
(B) Arf6 + GTP + Cholera toxin (not shown) (pdb_id: 2a5d; 1.80 Ǻ) [36]. (C) Arl1 + GTP + Golgin-245 Grip domain (not shown) (pdb_id: 1upt; 1.7

residues (i.e., the tryptophan, glycine and arginine) and
their structural interactions were noted previously [19].
Finally, the side chain of a co-conserved leucine residue
(Leu25-Arf1 in Figures 3C and 4A) that directly precedes the P-loop aspartate packs up against the two
arginine residues and against the glutamate and tryptophan residues–suggesting that it may facilitate the

associated hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions
by helping to position these residues sterically. Thus a
common theme shared by all of these residues is that
they converge on regions that are in close proximity to
the g-phosphate of bound GTP.
Notably, a mcBPPS analysis of the retinitis pigmentosa
2 (RP2) gene product (Additional File 2), which

Neuwald Biology Direct 2010, 5:66

functions as a GTPase-activating protein for Arl3
GTPase [20], suggests that interactions between RP2 coconserved residues and residues of the Arf/Arl/Sar-salt
bridge network within Arl3 may help stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis.

modification implicated in membrane association and a
feature required for the biological function of Arf
GTPases. Given tryptophan’s inherent affinity for the
lipid bilayer [23-25], this residue might play a role in
membrane association.

Similarities with Ga subunits

The switch II tryptophan-arginine residue pair characteristic of Arf/Arl/Sar GTPases is also conserved in heterotrimeric G protein a subunits. In Ga these residues
also form similar structural interactions within the
GTP-bound state [6] (Figure 4G). Likewise, Ga subunits
conserve the a3 helix arginine residue, though not the
P-loop aspartate residue that, within Arf/Arl/Sar
GTPases, interacts with this arginine. Instead, Ga subunits conserve the P-loop glycine that is conserved in
Ras, as well as a P-loop glutamate residue that directly
follows (in sequence) this P-loop glycine and that can
form a salt bridge interaction with the a3 arginine.
Thus Ga and Arf/Arl/Sar GTPases both conserve the
potential for forming a salt bridge between a P-loop
acidic residue and an a3 helix arginine residue.
The a3 helix salt bridge network versus a ‘glycine brace’

Within Ran, Rab and Rho GTPases, the a3 helix and the
loop preceding it lack the characteristic Arf/Arl/Sar coconserved residues and instead are associated with a
different set of co-conserved residues: two aromatic residues (Phe91Rab11 and Trp105Rab11 in Fig. S1C of Additional File 1) that form CH-π and NH-π interactions
with two putative glycine hinge points for the P-loop
and for the guanine binding loop, and an aspartate residue (Asp19Rab11 ) within the P-loop region that, along
with a co-conserved serine/threonine residue
(Thr98 Rab11 ) and a buried conserved water molecule,
form a network of interactions between the two aromatic residues. This configuration was termed a glycine
brace whose proposed role is to stabilize the guanine
nucleotide binding loops [21]. Thus the analysis here
indicates that Arf/Arl/Sar and Rab/Ran/Rho GTPases
exhibit distinct structural motifs–a salt bridge network
and a glycine brace, respectively–that establish interactions linking the region preceding and including the a3
helix to regions that directly interact with bound guanine nucleotide. It is worthwhile noting in this context
that a weak distinguishing feature of Arf/Arl/Sar/Ga
GTPases (which requires a low contrast setting to show
up) is an aromatic residue (Phe90 in Arf1) that, within
some structures, appears to form a CH-π interaction
with the glycine residue (Gly24Arf1 ) corresponding to
one of the glycines stabilized by the brace.
A possible membrane-associated tryptophan residue

An Arf/Arl/Sar co-conserved tryptophan within the Cterminal end of the GTPase domain (Trp172-Arf1 in
Fig. S2C of Additional File 1) is located structurally near
the N-terminal myristate moiety [22]–a posttranslational

Distinguishing sequence features of Arf/Arl versus Ga
and Sar GTPases

The mcBPPS analysis also identifies sequence features
that most distinguish Arf/Arl from Ga and Sar (column
13 in Figure 2; Figure 3D) (this comparison excludes
Arl6 and Arl8 GTPases because they lack many features
typical of Arf/Arl GTPases; see below). Among the most
strikingly divergent residues is a tryptophan (Trp66Arf1)
that is also categorized as a Ras-like co-conserved residue (Figure 3B); it shows up in this category as well
because within Arf/Arl this residue is nearly always a
tryptophan, whereas Ga and Sar nearly always conserve
the smaller aromatic residues, phenyalanine or tyrosine,
instead. Within available structures of GTP-bound Arf/
Arl GTPases, this tryptophan packs up against and may
form a CH-π interaction [26] with the valine or isoleucine residue of a N-[IV] motif (Val53Arf1 in Figures 3D
and 5A), while the asparagine of this motif (Asn52Arf1)
forms a side-chain hydrogen bond with the Walker B
aspartate (Asp67 Arf1 in Figures 3D and 5A), which is
sequence-adjacent to the tryptophan (i.e., the Walker B
region conserves the pattern W-D-x-x-G).
However, for Arf/Arl GTPases in the GDP-bound
state, the b-strand containing this tryptophan and the
adjacent Walker B aspartate is typically displaced by
two residue positions relative to the adjacent b-strand
(Figure 5B), which lead Pasqualato et al. [19] to propose an ‘interswitch toggle’ device for front-to-back
communication from the N-terminus to the nucleotide
binding site in Arf/Arl/Arp/Sar GTPases. Moreover,
Pasqualato et al. proposed that movement of the
aspartate of the DxxG motif mimics the charge of the
g-phosphate of GTP to thereby prevent binding of
GTP. Thus, the side chain interactions between the
residues of the W-D and N-[IV] motifs within the
GTP-bound state may help counteract the tendency
for this region to toggle forward. Indeed, it is the backbone b-strand interaction between residues of the W-D
motif and the N-[IV] motif that is shifted by two positions when the interswitch region toggles, and, in the
GDP-bound toggled state, the interactions between the
N-[IV] motif residues and the tryptophan and aspartate
residues are completely disrupted. Arl6 GTPases are
atypical inasmuch as they conserve neither the tryptophan nor the N-[IV] motif, and, unlike typical Arf/Arl/
Sar GTPases, they conserve a serine instead of a glycine with the Walker B motif (D-x-S-G; Ser71 Arl6 in
Figure 4E).

Figure 5 Structural locations of Arf/Arl co-conserved residues. (A-C) Conserved residues (green side-chains) distinguishing Arf/Arl from Sar
and Ga GTPases (column 13 in Fig. 2; Fig. 3D). (A) The structure of Arf1 bound to GTP. The region shown corresponds to a b sheet adjacent to
the Walker B region. Note that the asparagine of the N-[VI] motif (Asn52) forms a hydrogen bond with the Walker B aspartate (Asp67), whereas
the valine (Val53) packs up against a tryptophan (Trp66) that directly precedes the aspartate. An Arf/Arl-conserved isoleucine (Ile74) packs against
the backbone connecting the switch I threonine residue (Thr48) to the switch I glycine (Gly50; unlabeled in figure). (B) The structure of Arf1
bound to GDP. Note that the b-strand corresponding to the Walker B “W-D” motif has shifted to the left by two residue positions due to Arf’s
interswitch toggle and that the N-[VI] motif interactions are disrupted. (C) The structural location of the Arf/Arl conserved glutamine (Gln128)
and alanine (Ala125) residues associated with the guanine binding loop (the NK-x-D motif). The glutamine may stabilize this loop by forming
hydrogen bonds with backbone oxygen atoms on either side of this loop, as shown. (D-E). Structural locations of residues (blue side-chains) that
are conserved in and distinctive of Arl8 GTPases (column 16 in Fig. 2; Fig. S4D in Additional File 1). Residue side chains corresponding to the
N-[IV] motif (of Arf/Arl GTPases) are shown in green. Note that Arl8-specific conserved residues form alternative interactions in the two forms,
suggesting that they play a role in the interswitch toggle. (D) A non-interswitch toggled form of Arl8-GDP (pdb_id: 1zd9; structural genomics
consortium). (E) An interswitch toggled form of Arl8-GDP (pdb_id: 2 h18; structural genomics consortium).

Another feature distinguishing Arf/Arl from Ga/Sar
GTPases is an isoleucine or leucine residue (Ile74Arf1 in
Figure 5A) the side-chain of which, in the GTP-bound
state, packs against the switch I backbone residue that is
located between a conserved glycine residue and a conserved threonine residue. The glycine residue (Gly50Arf1)
is conserved within Ras-like GTPases and may function
as a hinge point, whereas the threonine residue
(Thr48Arf1) coordinates with the Mg++ ion associated
with guanine nucleotide phosphate groups. This conserved isoleucine or leucine residue is sequence adjacent
to the switch II arginine (Arg75Arf1) that is conserved in
Arf/Arl/Sar (and Ga) GTPases and that, in the GTPbound state, forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone

oxygen of the Walker B glycine residue which senses
g-phosphate. Thus, one possible explanation for coconservation of this isoleucine/leucine residue with the
N-[VI] motif is that they cooperatively stabilize the nontoggled GTP-bound state.
Sar GTPases also exhibit an interswitch toggle but fail
to conserve any of these features (as was expected inasmuch as Sar GTPases were assigned to the background
in column 13 of Figure 2). Moreover, unlike Arf/Arl
GTPases, Sar GTPases lack two Ras-like canonical residues that are located near the g-phosphate of bound
GTP, namely (i) the Switch I glycine residue (Gly50Arf1
in Figure 3B) that may function as a hinge point; and
(ii) the catalytic glutamine residue (Gln71Arf1 in Figure

Neuwald Biology Direct 2010, 5:66
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/66

3B) near the N-terminal end of the Switch II region.
Indeed, what most distinguishes Sar GTPases from Arf/
Arl and Ga GTPases (column 14 in Figure 2; Fig. S3D
in Additional File 1) is the conservation of histidine
instead of the Arf/Arl canonical residues at both of
these positions and of a proline residue directly following the switch I histidine. This proline directly precedes
the residue position that, within Arf/Arl GTPases, harbors the asparagine of the N-[VI] motif and that, within
the non-toggled GTP-bound conformation, forms two
backbone hydrogen bonds with the Walker B-aspartate.
Taken together, this suggests that certain aspects of
Sar’s catalytic and toggling mechanisms fundamentally
differ from that of typical Arf/Arl GTPases.
Alternative contexts for the guanine binding motif

Ras-like GTPases, with the exception of Ga subunits,
conserve a glycine or alanine residue (Ala125Arf1 in Figure 3B) directly before the guanine binding motif (i.e.,
[GA]-N-K-x-D). Ran, Rab, Rho and most Ras family
GTPases conserve a glycine residue that appears to be
stabilized by one of the two aromatic residues of the
proposed glycine brace [21]. Sar GTPases also conserve
this glycine, though they lack the conserved aromatic
CH-π interaction. Arf/Arl GTPases conserve a (less flexible) alanine residue at this position. Notably nearly all
other P-loop GTPases harbor larger residues at this
position, suggesting that a small residue may be functionally necessary for Ras-like GTPases (other than Ga).
Furthermore, at the x-position of the N-K-x-D motif,
Arf/Arl GTPases (other than the atypical Arl6 and Arl8
GTPases) co-conserve a glutamine (e.g., Gln128Arf1 in
Figure 5C), the side chain of which can form hydrogen
bonds with the backbone oxygen of the co-conserved
alanine preceding this motif or of a residue near the end
of the guanine binding loop or of both. Thus, these Arf/
Arl residues (as well as the corresponding glycine brace
residues) may help modulate the flexibility of the guanine binding loop and consequently its nucleotide affinity in response to upstream regulatory signals.
Arl8 is an atypical Arf/Arl GTPase

Among Arf/Arl GTPases, the Arl8 subfamily (also
termed Arl10B,C [27]) stands out as lacking several of
the canonical residues characteristic of both Ras-like
and other Arf/Arl GTPases (Figs. S4 in Additional File
1). (i) Arl8 GTPases lack the canonical [RK]-x-[LIV] Nterminal motif characteristic of Ras-like GTPases and,
instead, conserve an [ED]-x-[TS] motif–a pattern that
other atypical Ras-like GTPases lack. (ii) They currently
are the only Ras-like GTPases for which a conserved
cysteine substitutes for the second aromatic residue of
the Y-[YF] motif within the switch II region. (iii) Instead
of harboring an isoleucine/leucine residue prior to the
Arf/Arl/Sar switch II R-x-W motif, Arl8 conserves (as

Page 9 of 17

do many non-Arl/Arf/Ga/Sar GTPases) a phenylalanine
(Phe77Arl8 in Figs S4D and 5D); this residue appears to
form a CH-π interaction with the conserved glycine
residue (Gly53Arl8) bordering the switch I region of Raslike GTPases–thereby perhaps stabilizing this potential
glycine hinge point. (iv) Arl8 GTPases conserve a glutamine instead of the P-loop aspartate typical of Arl/Arf/
Sar GTPases and fail to conserve the arginine residue
with which the P-loop aspartate interacts (not shown).
And (v) they lack the conserved glutamine and alanine
residues that are associated with the NKxD motif within
typical Arf/Arl GTPases. For these reasons, Arl8
GTPases are very likely to differ mechanistically from
other Arf/Arl GTPases and thus are perhaps best placed
into a distinct category. Nevertheless, Arl8 GTPases do
conserve certain Arf/Arl features such as the asparagine
of the N-[VI] motif and a tryptophan directly preceding
the Walker B aspartate.
Further insight into Arl8 divergence is obtained by
examining available crystal structures. Even though a
structure of Arl8 GTPases bound to GTP is not yet
available, both interswitch toggle conformations are
observed within available structures of Arl8 bound to
GDP (Figures 5D, E). One of these corresponds to the
form normally associated with the GTP-bound state
(Figure 5D) inasmuch as the b-strand associated with
the D-x-x-G motif forms the same hydrogen bonds with
the adjacent b-strands (these bonds are not shown in
Figures 5D, E). In this form, the Arl8 residue corresponding to the second position of the Arf/Arl N-[VI]
motif, namely Met56, packs up against the tryptophan
residue directly preceding the D-x-x-G motif, as does
the corresponding isoleucine or valine within typical
Arf/Arl GTPases (when in the GTP-bound state). However, unlike typical Arf/Arl GTPases, the indole amine
of the tryptophan forms a hydrogen bond with the side
chain oxygen of the Arl8-conserved glutamate residue
(Glu21 in Figure 5D) that replaces the basic residue normally found at this position in Arf/Arl (and in other
Ras-like) GTPases. At the same time, the Arl8-conserved
phenylalanine residue (Phe77Arl8 in Figure 5D) appears
to form a CH-π hydrogen bond with the putative switch
I glycine-hinge (Gly53Arl8 in Figure 5D).
However, in a second, interswitch-toggled conformation (Figure 5E) the b-strand in which this tryptophan
occurs is shifted toward the guanine nucleotide binding
site by two positions and forms a hydrogen bond with a
threonine residue (Thr23) that again is specifically conserved within Arl8 GTPases. The indole amine of this
tryptophan may also form a NH...S hydrogen bond with
a cysteine residue (Cys85) that likewise is specifically
conserved within Arl8 GTPases. Although the atomic
coordinates are slightly outside of the ideal range for NH...S hydrogen bonds [28] (and the electron-density

Neuwald Biology Direct 2010, 5:66
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/66

map is unavailable), previous studies support a propensity for the indole amine of tryptophan to form N-H...S
hydrogen bonds [29,30]. Thus the threonine and
cysteine residues may be conserved due to an Arl8-specific interswitch toggle mechanism.

Conclusions
Here a mcBPPS analysis of Arf/Arl/Sar GTPases has
provided clues regarding various co-conserved residues
whose functions are currently unknown. Although by no
means determining their functional roles, this provides
guidance by generating plausible hypotheses for experimental follow up. For example, The N-[VI] motif asparagine within Arf/Arl GTPases could be mutated to an
aspartate (a relatively minor replacement of the sidechain -NH2 group with an oxygen atom) to explore the
influence of the -NH2 group on the interswitch toggle
device and, as a result, perhaps on GEF or GAP activity.
Mutation of non-canonical residues back to the canonical residues for atypical Arf/Arl GTPases could also be
informative (and seem unlikely to introduce dramatic
structural perturbations given their prevalence within
typical Arf/Arl GTPases). For instance, mutation of the
Switch II cysteine within Arl8 to the canonical tyrosine
or phenylalanine may impair the ability of this GTPase
to toggle if a potential NH...S interactions with the
Walker B tryptophan is functionally important. Alternatively, replacing this cysteine with a serine (which never
occurs at this position within available Arl8 family
sequences) merely replaces the larger sulfur atom with a
smaller oxygen atom.
Likewise, consider the Ga GTPase conserved arginine residue that is structurally homologous with the
a3 helix arginine residue that forms a salt bridge with
the P-loop aspartate within the Arf/Arl/Sar families.
This Ga arginine likewise forms a salt bridge with a Ploop glutamate residue suggesting potential mechanistic similarities (and differences) with the Arf/Arl/Sar
GTPases. Mutagenesis of the P-loop glutamate within
Ga either to glutamine (thereby replacing its carboxylate side-chain group with a carboxamide group) or to
aspartate (thereby shortening its sidechain by one carbon atom), seems likely to have subtle (and hence
interpretable) effects that may provide insight into the
role of this salt bridge interaction within Ga GTPases.
A possible membrane-association role for the highlysurfaced-exposed tryptophan residue near the N-terminal myristate moiety (Trp172Arf1 in Figure S2C) could
also be explored through mutagenesis. Of course, these
are but a few examples of the Arf/Arl/Sar divergent
residues identified by the mcBPPS sampler that could
be explored in this way.
More generally, this study illustrates how the mcBPPS
sampler complements traditional evolutionary analyses

Page 10 of 17

by characterizing protein functional-divergence objectively and quantitatively, as opposed to “eye-balling”
divergent residues within a few, manually-selected representative sequences. Several advantages of the sampler
in this regard are worthwhile pointing out: It can reveal
detailed molecular distinctions between divergent subgroups from multiple perspectives. It can be applied to a
vast number of sequences. It precisely classifies the
sequences into subgroups based on the multiple categories of differentiating patterns that it identifies. And it
can automatically eliminate pseudogene products, unrelated sequences, and other non-functional or functionally impaired proteins by sampling them either into a
‘rejected sequence subgroup’ or into miscellaneous subgroups. Moreover, the sampler can compute predictive
probabilities for sequence membership in various subgroups (and, by implication, for protein function).
Finally it can be used to generate subgroup profiles, in
which the various functionally-divergent categories of
residues are annotated automatically. Version 1.0 of the
mcBPPS program is freely available at http://www.chain.
umaryland.edu/mcbpps.

Methods
Multiple category Bayesian Partitioning with Pattern
Selection (mcBPPS)

Here a conceptual description of the mcBPPS sampler is
provided. Mathematical and algorithmic details regarding the sampler, the distinctions between it and other
methods, and an evaluation of its performance will be
published elsewhere (Neuwald, submitted). The mcBPPS
program requires three input files: (i) A (typically) large
number of multiply aligned sequences belonging to the
protein class of interest. (ii) An N × M table (termed a
hyperpartition) that specifies which subgroups are
assigned to the foreground and background for each of
M ’functional constraint categories’. And (iii) a ‘seed
alignment’ for each of the N-1 subgroups modeled by
the hyperpartition (a seed alignment is not required for
an N-th subgroup, which consists of random sequences).
Given this input, the mcBPPS sampler runs (in parallel)
multiple BPPS procedures (one for each constraint category) both to optimally assign the input sequences to
the subgroups (and, by implication, to the foreground
and background partitions for each category) and to
define, for each category, a pattern that optimally differentiates the foreground from the background sequences.
The sampler outputs a set of ‘contrast alignments’ that
reveal the co-conserved residue patterns characteristic
of each subgroup; it also outputs those input sequences
that have been assigned to each subgroup.
Input multiple sequence alignments

Multiple alignment of available GTPase sequences was
accomplished using a previously described strategy [11]

Neuwald Biology Direct 2010, 5:66
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/66

that iterates between sequence detection and alignment
using the MAPGAPS program [31]http://mapgaps.igs.
umaryland.edu. This yielded an alignment of 258,895
sequences. Sequence fragments and nearly-identical
sequences (those sharing more than 98% sequence identity) were removed, yielding a final alignment consisting
of 66,386 sequences. Seed alignments, which serve as
Bayesian priors to help define each sequence set, were
obtained by selecting from the main sequence alignment
a few well-characterized proteins belonging to each of
the major P-loop GTPase subgroups and to each of the
largest Arf/Arl subfamilies. For certain subgroups, consensus sequences were used as seeds.
The hyperpartition

The relationships between distinct sequence subgroups
within a protein class are specified using a hyperpartition, which consists of a N × M matrix that assigns N
sequence subgroups to the foreground, background or
non-participating-sequence partitions for each of the M
functionally-divergent categories to be modeled. As
described in the Introduction, each foreground partition
consists of sequences that share certain co-conserved
patterns and that have diverged from the background
sequences lacking those patterns; the non-participatingsequences are excluded from the comparison. The
hyperpartition defined here is given in Figure 2. The
choice of which subgroups are assigned to which partitions for each category is, in some sense, arbitrary
depending on what questions are being asked–though
the mcBPPS procedure will reject categories that lack
empirical support (i.e., that lack differentiating sequence
patterns). Most often categories are defined to reflect
the phylogenetic relationships between protein
sequences (e.g., Arf subfamilies will be classified
together as having diverged from a single ancestral Raslike GTPase; Ras-like families will be classified as having
diverged from a single ancestral P-loop GTPase; et
cetera)(See Figure 1C).
Structural analysis

Structural analysis of sequence features was performed
using routines that have been implemented within the
CHAIN program [32] and that were used to generate
RasMol [33] scripts for each category of co-conserved
residues identified by the mcBPPS program.
Sequences and structures used in the analysis

Sequences were identified within the NCBI nr, env_nr
and translated EST databases; only translated EST open
reading frames of at least 100 residues in length were
used. The pdb identifiers corresponding to the proteins
structures shown in Figures 4 and 5 are: Arf1_human,
1R8SA [34]; Arf2_yeast, 1MR3F [35]; Arf5_human,
2B6HA (Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC));

Reduce program [42] was used to predict hydrogen
atom positions within structural coordinate files; this
step is required for automated detection of hydrogen
bonds using the CHAIN program [32]. Molecular
images were created using Rasmol [33].

Reviewer’s comments
Reviewer 1: Frank Eisenhaber (together with Sebastian
Maurer-Stroh), Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for
Science, Technology and Research, Singapore

Reviewer 1
Using an extension of his Bayesian classification algorithm, the author identifies and describes residues that
differ among various GTPase families with particular
focus on Arf and Arl-like GTPases. The analysis and
method strongly depend on prior subfamily knowledge
and alignment of pre-classified seed families which
would make the same approach less easily applicable to
other families, at least in an unsupervised manner.
Author’s response: When used in conjunction with the
original, single-category BPPS sampler, the mcBPPS sampler can readily be applied to unclassified protein superfamilies. Seed sequences serve a role analogous to that of
the query in a database search: they allow the user to
ask specific questions regarding proteins of interest.
Reviewer 1
The seed dependency is not a major problem for this
manuscript since the selection of pre-classified GTPase
subfamilies is in good agreement with the literature in this
field but simplifies the evolutionary scenario for some of
the subfamilies, e.g. Galpha proteins, which could be
further split into smaller families as was done for the different Arf/Arls. Maybe the difficulties reported when comparing Ga to Arf/Arls could be overcome with more
attention given to detailed pairwise subfamily similarities/
differences. In general, it would be interesting if the seed
grouping and group relations could be automatically
derived and weighted, for example from phylogenetic
trees. If the author prefers probabilistic sampling, BEAST,
would be an option to fit into the Bayesian framework.
Author’s response: I have performed additional comparisons along the lines suggested, but–because this
added little to the overall analysis and to keep the
manuscript readable–these were left out. The mcBPPS
program includes a routine to convert a phylogenetic tree
into a hyperpartition. Thus, a phylogenetic tree could be
used as suggested–though I have not fully automated
this process.

Reviewer 1
The input alignment used cuts out both N- and C-termini of the proteins which may have appeared messy in
the large alignment due to strongly differing terminal
extension lengths. However, besides having different
lengths of linker regions, these termini are actually also
characteristic for subfamilies. For example, several of the
Arf/Arl subfamilies are either N-terminally myristoylated
or acetylated which dramatically alters their cellular
context and function. Similarly, some but not all Galpha
subfamilies are also myristoylated, while Ras, Ran, Rho,
Rab etc. have different subfamily-specific patterns of farnesylation or geranylgeranylation. A possible solution to
the problem of aligning termini to be included in this
analysis would be to assume that the respective motifs
for posttranslational modifications are recognized as
extended peptides followed by some linkers of varying
length. The terminal portions of the alignment could,
therefore, simply be assumed to be gapless while the linkers of varying lengths between the termini and the
globular structure (current alignment) can be more or
less ignored.
Author’s response: There are, of course, various ways
in which this sort of analysis could be performed. My
inclination would be to perform a separate analysis of
such N- and C-terminal extensions. One could do the
same both for the large insert regions that occur in certain GTPases and for interacting protein domains.
Reviewer 1
The Bayesian classification method used is not well
described but builds mainly upon previous publications.
For easier understandability, a few sentences could be
added to give a bit more detail, especially on how conservation was initially derived/defined. For example, the
manuscript mentions the importance of detecting
positions fully conserved in the foreground but not conserved in the background set. However, subfamily-specific positions that are different between families may still
be conserved within their respective subfamilies which
makes them even more interesting for functional specificity but they will be different in terms of probabilities
for drawing the same distribution by chance compared
to random background sequences (e.g. one position with
“all Lysine in Arf1 but all Glutamate in Arf2” would be
different from “all Lysine in Arf1 and no conservation at
all in Arf2”).
Author’s response: I have written a detailed description of the statistical formulation and algorithmic
procedure within a separate, methods- and evaluationoriented paper. This methods-oriented paper explicitly
defines sequence conservation (mathematically) and provides biological justifications. My aim here was to introduce the sampler to a biology-oriented audience, for
whom such details cannot be described in a few

Page 12 of 17

sentences. Nevertheless, the short answer to your specific
question is: The sampler does not down grade a conserved foreground position due to the specific nature of
(divergent) background residues at that position.
However, it can, at the same time, model the fact that
the background subgroup conserves certain residues at the
same position simply by including that subgroup in the
hyperpartition. Note too that the sampler by no means
requires fully conserved foreground pattern residues.
Reviewer 1
The fact that the most common consensus background residue in Figure 3A is leucine which is also one
of the most common residues in databases would indicate that this background set approaches database composition for the most general comparisons while this is
not the case for all other examples.
Author’s response: This occurs because the background for this category is (mainly) represented by random sequences whose compositions are based on the
overall distribution of amino acids within proteins.
Reviewer 1
The lack of displaying representatives from the other
subfamilies in the output alignment makes it difficult to
verify the predicted status of subfamily-specific conservation. Since the seed alignment is curated and consists
of only few members, it should be suitable to be displayed in the output as well as the main manuscript as
figures including the annotation for positions with explicitly discussed subfamily-specific conservation. For
example, the program Jalview allows conservation coloring based on group selections to highlight subfamily
differences.
Author’s response: I am not sure what the referee is
requesting. Several subfamily alignments are given in
Additional File 1and the seed sequences are those explicitly shown in the alignments. Interested readers may
download the GTPase input files and the mcBPPS sampler from my website to generate and examine all of the
output alignments.
Reviewer 1
While the structural part of the manuscript focuses on
intra-molecular interpretation of the importance of the
identified residues, the complexity of regulation through
protein-protein interactions of various GTPases by other
proteins is only marginally mentioned although it should
play a major role in determining subfamily-specificities.
Author’s response: I too more or less expected this.
However, instead of driving an analysis via preconceived
notions about what ought to be found, it seems best to
allow the data itself to reveal its most striking properties.
In this case, this appears to have led us in certain unexpected directions. One explanation for the scarcity of
pattern residue interactions of the sort that you might
have expected is that residues involved in specific

Neuwald Biology Direct 2010, 5:66
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/66

protein-protein interactions have substantially diverged
within these GTPase subfamilies; this is not so surprising
considering that these subfamilies diverged from a common ancestor one to two billion years ago.
Reviewer 1
The argumentation of functional roles of residues based
on existence of hydrogen bonds to known important residues is qualitatively interesting but several more residues
in the vicinity that were not highlighted in the manuscript
may fulfill the same criteria which raises the question if
such arguments are truly specific. At the same time, the
author goes into great detail to highlight the agreement
with previous biochemical and structural studies which
make this part of the description of the used dataset valuable as benchmark for comparison with other methods.
Author’s response: I would be very surprised if other
residues are not playing important roles. Many residues
in the seed alignments are conserved across distinct
phyla and thus presumably perform important functions.
The purpose of a mcBPPS analysis thus is not to prove
that these residues are the most important, but rather to
obtain statistical clues regarding their biochemical roles.
There are, of course, additional comparisons that could
have been performed to help characterize other residues;
this analysis is not intended to be exhaustive.
Reviewer 1
Identification of subfamily-specific residues has been
attempted multiple times by several different groups
before and the manuscript would greatly benefit from
mentioning different existing approaches. The list of
references appended at the bottom of this referee report
shows the broad spectrum of available methods and
could be useful to any interested reader. To check
robustness of the presented results over different methods or otherwise to highlight possible advantages of his
approach, it would be good to apply 1 or 2 of the more
successful alternative methods to the same dataset. It
may be of interest to compare to results from methods
that do not require a priori classified examples but
rather calculate initial groupings from a phylogenetic
tree to showcase advantages and disadvantages of different approaches on the GTPase dataset. Also, the question whether the enormous amount of aligned
sequences is necessary to arrive at similar conclusions
with methods that do not depend on large sample sizes
could be addressed. Many of the observations may
already be visible even in the seed alignment.
Author’s response: I have added the references
[43-54], as suggested. In addition, the forthcoming
mcBPPS methods paper cites 16 such references, comments on the distinctions between the sampler and other
methods, and evaluates the sampler’s performance. Keeping the focus here on the sampler’s biological application
avoids both overlap with this companion paper and a

Page 13 of 17

lengthy discussion of the important distinctions between
the sampler and other methods. For example, many of
these methods seek to identify conserved residues directly
responsible for substrate specificity. The sampler
addresses a different computational problem, namely to
identify (concurrently) both the most strikingly co-conserved residue patterns and the corresponding protein
subgroups conserving those patterns–regardless of the
biological functions of those residues. The goal is to
obtain statistical clues regarding uncharacterized biochemical phenomena as an aid to biological discovery
rather than to predict new instances of well understood
phenomena. Statistical analyses are often used in this
way to obtain preliminary information regarding biological processes that thus far have evaded detection due to
inherent experimental limitations. For example, the
hypothesis that components of tobacco smoke cause lung
cancer in humans is (for obvious ethical reasons) still
merely indirectly supported by statistical analyses.
Reviewer 1
Overall, despite the above mentioned shortcomings
that could be addressed in a revision, this manuscript
provides a detailed view of functionally divergent residues in Arf/Arl GTPases and may become a good starting point for further studies, both in terms of the
biology of GTPases as well as for improvement of computational methods to identify such residues.
Author’s response: none required.

Reviewer 2
While a number of semi-manual approaches have been
used by different researchers in identifying functionally
relevant residues in alignments of large superfamilies, the
method developed by Neuwald stands out in terms of the
ability to use very large datasets (i.e. sequence alignments). This paper provides a powerful illustration of the
automated Bayesian classification approach being applied
to the Arf/Arl GTPases. The paper characterizes the
mechanistic determinants of the interswitch toggle (i.e.
the N-[VI] motif that is conserved within Arf/Arl
GTPases). Further it goes on to attempt an explanation
for the deviation from this pattern observed in the Arl8
GTPases. In the opinion of this referee the article is a
very useful addition to our current understanding of
GTPases and will certainly help future experimental studies on this important class of proteins.
Author’s response: none required.
Specific comments

Reviewer 2
-(p4) “An important subgroup of P-loop GTPases is
the Ras-like superfamily [4] (termed here the Ras-like

Neuwald Biology Direct 2010, 5:66
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/66

GTPases), members of which function as on-off switches
within eukaryotic signaling pathways.”
Given that the Ras-like superfamily exist in bacteria
and archaea it would be advisable to make this statement more general to include them. The precursors of
the Arf-like clade discussed here had already emerged in
the bacteria.
Author’s response: I have revised the paper
accordingly.
Reviewer 2
-(p8)” Indeed, less than 0.1% (224 out of 258,895) of
the remaining P-loop GTPases identified in this analysis
harbor an aspartate at this position–which is so low that
it could be due merely to non-functional open reading
frames and/or sequencing errors.”
This statement that minority which harbor aspartate
at this position may be non-function ORFs or sequencing errors does not seem to be entirely warranted. At
least a few known to this referee seem to be good ORFs.
It might be better to quickly check if these might belong
to a particular distinct clade.
Author’s response: I checked this, and you may be
right; I have modified the text accordingly.
Reviewer 2
-(p9-10) Is the P-loop glutamate truly equivalent to
the aspartate of the Arf-like GTPases? I entirely accept
the Ga-Arf-clade connection, and the fact that the
Ga-Arf clade is defined among other things by the
shared arginine in helix-3. However, the P-loop E in
the Gas appears to have emerged independently of the
D in the Arfs. Thus, it is convergent similarity between
the two. I suspect that this distinction between the two
which might actually result in subtle mechanistic differences between them. This probably relates to the
fact that the G#s have an in-built arginine finger
whose function would be affected by the Arf-like
condition.
Author’s response: My main point was that both
groups harbor a rather similar salt bridge between the
P-loop and the a3 helix. I agree that the differences
between the Ga and Arf/Arl salt bridges might reflect
significant mechanistic differences. I have toned down
the text accordingly.
Reviewer 2
-(p13) “Arl8 GTPases conserve a glutamine instead of
the P-loop aspartate typical of Arl/Arf/Sar GTPases and
fail to conserve the arginine residue with which the Ploop aspartate interacts (not shown).”
Does this relate in any way to the differences in the
Arl8 GAPs? What are the interaction partners of this Q
residue?
Author’s response: These are good questions, but there
is not yet a structure of Arl8 bound to a GAP that could
provide definitive answers.

Reviewer 3
The submitted manuscript titled “Bayesian classification of residues associated with protein functional divergence: Arf and Arf-like GTPases” describes a novel
Bayesian classifier for both the semi-supervised partitioning of a large multiple sequence alignment into a
number of prespecified sub-groups (families with a protein superfamily, etc) as well as the classification of
functionally divergent sites that maximally differentiate a
group (foreground) from the rest of the sequences
(background) in contrast alignments. This multiple category Bayesian Partitioning with Pattern Selection
(mcBPPS) method is an extension of earlier published
work of a BPPS classifier to a case of multiple categories
instead of just two (foreground and background). The
work demonstrates the utility of this method by analyzing a large multiple alignment (over 65,000 sequences)
of P-loop GTPases, focusing particular attention on the
Raslike superfamily and in particular on the Arf/Arl/
SAR family and G-alpha subunits. A number of differentially conserved residues are identified that, based on
further structural evidence and analysis based on the
author’s CHAIN method, seem like good candidates for
explaining the functional differences between different
functional sub-types.
Author’s response: none required.
General comments

Reviewer 3
This work should be broad appeal to molecular biologists and importantly is able to handle a very large number of sequences. In earlier work the author points out
that this is important to get away from potential sampling biases when performing analyses of functional
divergence. While this is true I would suggest that
breadth of phylogenetic sampling has perhaps the highest impact on these types of analyses and that a large
number of sequences in this dataset are likely highly
redundant, coming from very closely related taxa. While
the seed alignments are claimed to be phylogenetically
diverse, constituting representative sequences from different phyla, the large number of sequences that make
up the final optimal alignments for each group from
NCBI sources may give false impressions of the level of
sequence conservation at a given site due to sampling
bias in the databases themselves. Certain very highly
studied groups and organisms are over represented in
sequence databases.
Author’s response: The issue of sequence redundancy
was dealt with in two ways: First, nearly identical
sequences (as well as sequence fragments) were removed;
this pruned the input alignment from ~259,000 down to

Neuwald Biology Direct 2010, 5:66
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/66

~65,000 sequences. Second, sequences in the alignment
are down weighted for redundancy using the weighting
scheme used by PSI-BLAST. These and other mcBPPS
methodological issues are discussed in previous publications and in the statistically- and algorithmicallyoriented methods paper to be published separately.
These measures also address to some degree the issue of
sampling bias–which is also addressed by performing
multiple comparisons from various perspectives and
using various input alignments either that were constructed independently or from which significant numbers of sequences were randomly removed. The
forthcoming methods paper includes such evaluations.
Reviewer’s post-revision remark: Author’s response
addresses my concerns regarding comparisons to other
programs. Would personally prefer some information in
supplementary material only because the methods paper
is not yet accepted/in press, but focus on the biological
findings is appropriate.
Reviewer 3
Visualizing the phylogenetic context of these subgroups, families, and superfamilies would help clarify
the discussion of conserved/non-conserved residue positions in the main body of the work. While the hyperpartition in Figure 2 gives some indication, showing the
Arf/Arl/SAR group located within the Ras-like superfamily for instance, no real indication of the relationship
of groups within this family is given (Such as the relationship between Arl6 and Arl8 with the rest of the Arf/
Arl/SAR family for instance). I would highly suggest a
schematic tree representation that corresponds to the
hyperpartition shown in Figure 2 showing these phylogenetic relationships. Some indication of the number of
sequences in the seed alignment for each group, as well
as the total number of sequences after the optimal partitioning scheme is determined, would also be helpful and
clarifying. What phyla are represented in the seed alignments (perhaps as supplementary material) would also
be helpful.
Author’s response: As is clear from reference [4], there
is considerable uncertainty about the precise phylogenetic
relationships between various P-loop GTPases. Hence,
the validity of such a phylogenetic tree is questionable. I
have added to Additional File 1the requested information regarding the numbers of seed sequences and the
phyla they represent.
Reviewer 3
While the basis for this method has already been published, in general when new methods are proposed
some level of comparison to other existing methods
would be ideal. While this Bayesian classifier handles a
much larger number of sequences than most functional
divergence prediction programs can (this dataset in particular), why should molecular biologists use this

Page 15 of 17

particular method as opposed to others that have been
published such as DIVERGE [55], GroupSim [48],
Multi-RELIEF [56], or similar? The answer is obvious
for some of these in that the new method does semiautomated partitioning of sequences and can handle a
very large number of sequences. But does this method
predict any critical residues in this dataset that are
missed by other programs? Does it produce fewer likely
false-positives? Some sort of comparison would be helpful in convincing the reader that this proposed method
would be the most useful for them and that it provides
high quality predictions.
Author’s response: See my response to Reviewer 1’s
similar comment above.
Reviewer 3
Overall I think that this analysis is very thorough and
that the introduced method will be useful to a broad
segment of the molecular biology community.
Author’s response: none required.
Specific comments

Reviewer 3
I would recommend that the discussion of the Bayesian method (Introduction starting in paragraph 4) be
restructured somewhat to indicate from the initial discussion that seed alignments will be used (paragraph 7).
For a general molecular biology reader this description
could be streamlined a bit more as further information
is provided in the appropriate references.
Author’s response: I have added a comment regarding
the use of seed sequences, as requested. Referee 1’s suggestion to add a few more methodological details appears to
conflict with this referee’s streamlining suggestion. Nevertheless, I have streamlined this section somewhat for
clarity.
Reviewer 3
In discussions of residues differentially conserved
within, for instance, the Arf/Arl/SAR group versus the
rest of the Ras superfamily it would make discussion
clearer to remind readers of this nested superfamily/
family structure. “Residue X is conserved within the
Arf/Arl/SAR GTPases while in the rest of the Ras-like
GTPases it is Y...” for instance.
Author’s response: In most cases, a variety of residues
are conserved in the background sequences; however, I
have made an effort to include such statements when
pertinent.
Reviewer 3
Features Distinguishing Arf/Arl/Sar from other P-loop
GTPases paragraph 5 (Similarities with G-alpha subunits). This section would be clarified in terms of interpretation somewhat with the addition of the proper
phylogenetic context as discussed above since the Galpha subunits conserve this glycine residue that is putatively the ancestral state for all Ras-like GTPases.

Neuwald Biology Direct 2010, 5:66
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/66

Mentions a conserved P-loop glutamate immediately following this glycine, what is this residue in the other Arf/
Arl/Sar sequences? Is it just non-conserved?
Author’s response: As mentioned above, the precise phylogeny of these GTPases is uncertain, as is the ancestral
status of the P-loop glycine. Although the Ras, Rho, Ran
and Ga families conserve a glycine at this position, the Rab
family, which best conserves the Ras-like canonical features,
most often conserves a serine at this position. The residue
corresponding to the Ga P-loop glutamate is typically an
asparagine in Arf/Arl/Sar GTPases. Taking the analysis
deeper in this and numerous other ways would no doubt
be informative, but seems best left for future studies.
Researchers working on these proteins may download the
sampler and the data in order to explore those questions
most relevant to their research.
Reviewer 3
Paragraph 6 of same section. Salt Network versus Glycine Brace discussion. Mention a distinguishing feature
(Phe90) that only shows up under low contrast settings.
What are these contrast settings used in the regular analysis and what is the reduced setting used to have this feature show up? How many other putative distinguishing
features/functionally divergent sites show up under these
more liberal conditions? Some brief discussion of the contrast settings would be appropriate in the description of
the method earlier in the manuscript, perhaps with
expanded detail in supplementary material. Similarly a
brief description of the quantified “evolutionary constraint” that appears as histogram above sequences in
Figure 3 with ref to Neuwald et al, 2003 for further details.
Author’s response: Detailed information regarding the
contrast setting is found in Appendix 1 of the CHAIN program user’s manual, which is available at http://www.chain.
umaryland.edu. Briefly, the contrast setting determines how
many of the most discriminating pattern residues are highlighted in the output alignment. The histograms in Figure
3merely provide a qualitative measure of the relative constraints, and thus cannot be described quantitatively. The
mcBPPS sampler outputs a pattern information file which
provides quantitative measures corresponding to these histograms. This measure corresponds to the contribution (in
nats) of individual pattern positions to the underlying statistical model’s posterior log-likelihood ratio.
