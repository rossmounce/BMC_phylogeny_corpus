Abstract
Background: Increasing evidence suggests that overlapping genes are much more common in
eukaryotic genomes than previously thought. In this study we identified and characterized the
overlapping genes in a set of 13,484 pairs of human-mouse orthologous genes.
Results: About 10% of the genes under study are overlapping genes, the majority of which are
different-strand overlaps. The majority of the same-strand overlaps are embedded forms, whereas
most different-strand overlaps are not embedded and in the convergent transcription orientation.
Most of the same-strand overlapping gene pairs show at least a tenfold difference in length, much
larger than the length difference between non-overlapping neighboring gene pairs. The length
difference between the two different-strand overlapping genes is less dramatic. Over 27% of the
different-strand-overlap relationships are shared between human and mouse, compared to only
~8% conservation for same-strand-overlap relationships. More than 96% of the same-strand and
different-strand overlaps that are not shared between human and mouse have both genes located
on the same chromosomes in the species that does not show the overlap. We examined the causes
of transition between the overlapping and non-overlapping states in the two species and found that
3' UTR change plays an important role in the transition.
Conclusion: Our study contributes to the understanding of the evolutionary transition between
overlapping genes and non-overlapping genes and demonstrates the high rates of evolutionary
changes in the un-translated regions.

Background
Overlapping genes are known to be common in viruses,
mitochondria, bacteria, and plasmids [1], but are thought
to be rare in eukaryotes. This view is changing because
recent studies have suggested the existence of many overlapping genes in eukaryotic genomes, including human
[2-5], mouse [6], rat [7], fish [8], and flies [9,10].

There are two principal types of overlap: (1) the samestrand overlapping type in which the two genes involved
are transcribed from the same strand and (2) the differentstrand overlapping type in which the two genes are transcribed from different strands. Most of the recent largescale analyses in higher eukaryotes have been restricted to
different-strand-overlap genes, which are potential senseantisense gene pairs in which the overlap can affect the
regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription,

mRNA processing, splicing, or translation [11]. Samestrand-overlap genes have been largely neglected, but a
number of such genes have been shown to be functionally
important [12,13].
It is important to have a broad comparison between the
two types of overlap. In this study we have compiled a list
of orthologous gene pairs in human and mouse and identified overlapping genes in both species. We examined the
respective frequencies of the two types of overlap and
compared the lengths of overlapping regions in the two
types. Finally, we studied the evolutionary conservation of
overlapping relationships between human and mouse
and the possible mechanisms of transition between the
overlapping and non-overlapping states.

Results and Discussion
Frequencies of different types of overlap
Table 1 shows the statistics of overlapping genes in the
human and mouse genomes. Among the 13,484 pairs of
orthologous genes, there are 669 (54+615) and 554
(57+497) pairs of overlapping genes in human and
mouse, respectively. Because some large genes overlap
with multiple genes, the numbers of unique genes
involved in overlap in human and mouse are not 2 × 669
= 1338 and 1108 but are only 1219 (1219/13484 = 9.0%)
and 1004 (7.4%), respectively. These are likely underestimates of the actual number of overlapping genes because
we considered only 13,484 pairs of orthologs in the two
genomes. To see whether the frequency of overlapping
genes is significantly higher than random expectation, we
randomly selected the same number of genes on each
chromosome as the observed number, computed the proportion of overlapping genes, and found that only about
0.07% and 0.04% are expected by chance in human and
mouse, respectively.

Different-strand overlaps are clearly more common than
same-strand overlaps (Table 1); indeed, ~90% of the overlapping pairs are on opposite strands. Interestingly, the
pattern is opposite in prokaryotes. A study of overlapping
genes in 198 microbial genomes revealed that ~84% of
the overlapping genes are on the same strand [1]. There
can be multiple reasons for the drastic difference in the
prevalence of the two types of overlaps between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It has been shown that in prokaryo-

tes, same-strand overlaps (aka. tandem overlaps) are
mostly in the +1 (2 + 3n shared bases) and +2 (1 + 3n
shared bases) reading frames, whereas different-strand
overlaps (aka. antiparallel overlaps) are evenly distributed
in the three reading frames [1]. The pattern has been considered to be the product of the intensity of selective pressure on different types of overlaps and the level of
independence derived from the plasticity in nucleotide
sequence while maintaining a given amino acid sequence
[1,14]. Compared to the prokaryotes, most eukaryotes
have introns and thus tend to have larger genomes. The
more abundant different-strand overlaps in eukaryotes
might be a joint effect of more complex gene structures
and the role that these overlapping genes play in the regulation of gene expression.
Based on the relative orientations of the genes involved in
overlap, overlapping genes can be further classified into
divergent (←→), convergent (→←), and embedded
forms (one gene is completely contained in the other) for
different-strand overlaps, and embedded and not-embedded forms for same-strand overlaps. Table 2 shows that
the majority of same-strand overlaps are embedded
forms, accounting for ~89% and ~79% of overlapping
genes in the human and mouse genomes, respectively.
Different-strand overlaps show a different pattern: in both
species, convergent is the most common type (~50%), followed by embedded (~29%) and divergent forms
(~21%).
We found no previous estimates of the frequencies of different types of same-strand overlaps. On the other hand,
there have been some estimates on the proportions of the
three types of different-strand overlap. For example, Veeramachaneni et al. (2004) found that ~54% are convergent, ~30% divergent, and ~16% embedded in a sample
of 774 different-strand overlaps in human. A similar pattern was observed in mouse for a sample of 542 differentstrand overlaps with ~54% convergent, ~37% divergent,
and ~9% embedded forms. Shendure and Church [15]
reported that ~72% of 185 different-strand-overlap genes
in human and mouse are convergent, ~22% are embedded forms, and only ~6% are divergent. Lehner et al. [16]
and Yelin et al. [17] also examined the frequencies of different types of different-strand overlaps. A most recent
study estimated 25–27% for the convergent, 27–30% for

the divergent, and 43–48% for the embedded types of
overlap [18]. Therefore, estimates of the frequencies of
different types of overlap differed considerably among
studies. The differences can be due to a number of reasons
such as small sample sizes, different computational methods used to identify sense and antisense genes, different
criteria used to filter out spurious different-strand gene
pairs, and different experimental data used for the evidence of transcription.
We also examined whether genes involved in overlap
share coding regions or not (Table 1). There are no samestrand-overlap genes that share coding regions; therefore,
in the same-strand overlaps, one gene resides in another
gene's introns. Moreover, there are only 51 genes (51/615
= 8.3%) and 28 genes (28/497 = 5.6%) that involve exonexon overlaps on opposite strands in human and mouse,
respectively. The dearth of genes that share coding regions
suggests at least two possibilities. One might be selection
against overlap in coding regions. Since there is no selective pressure for a compact genome in eukaryotes (unlike
the case of prokaryotes) and since selection on genes sharing coding regions can be strong because overlap may
cause interference in transcription, it is preferred that
genes do not overlap with each other in coding regions.
The second, perhaps the major reason, might be that the
majority of overlapping genes evolved from non-overlapping genes, so that they originally had independent coding regions and merging of coding regions rarely occurs.
Compared with previous estimates, our estimates of the
number of overlapping genes in coding regions are relatively low due to our stringent criterion of requiring that
all genes studied here need to be one-to-one orthologs in
human and mouse (i.e. the ortholog assignment must
have strong phylogenetic support), which eliminates
many genes in multi-gene families that have ambiguous
ortholog assignments between human and mouse.
Lengths of overlap regions
Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution of overlap
lengths. The two species show very similar patterns. The
overlap lengths of the two genes in different-strand overlaps tend to be much shorter than those for same-strand
overlaps. For example, ~43% of the overlap regions of different-strand overlaps are shorter than 1 kb, whereas less

than 2% of the overlap regions of same-strand overlaps
are shorter than 1 kb. For the majority of same-strand
overlaps, overlap regions account for 90–100% of the
shorter gene but less than 10% of the longer gene, consistent with the observation that the majority of same-strand
overlaps are embedded forms (Table 2). For differentstrand overlaps, in ~37–46% of the cases the overlap
regions account for less than 10% of the length of the
shorter gene, and in ~30–34% of the cases the overlap
regions account for 90–100% of the length of the shorter
gene.
The distribution of lengths of overlap regions seems to
reflect the degree of selective constraints on the length of
overlap regions. The selective constraint appears to be
stronger in different-strand overlaps than in same-strand
overlaps. The length of overlap regions and the location of
overlap regions in the genes (i.e., 5' UTR, introns, exons,
or 3' UTR) may determine the types of expression regulation or correlation between overlapping genes. For example, it has been shown that genes on different strands that
overlap in their 5' UTRs tend to have coordinated gene
expression [19], whereas genes that overlap in their 3'
UTRs seem to be mostly implicated in sense and antisense
interaction that causes a negative association between
genes' expression [11]. Recently, it has been shown that
the lengths of overlap regions can significantly influence
the degree of transcriptional interference between cis natural antisense genes (cis-NATs) – the longer the overlap
region, the greater the transcriptional interference in cisNATs [20]. The study of the role of overlap in gene regulation is still in its infancy and much remains to be done to
understand how overlapping genes interfere with each
other's expression and function.
We calculated the ratios of the lengths of shorter and
longer genes for overlapping gene pairs and compared
them with the ratios of the lengths of the non-overlapping
neighboring genes (shorter vs. longer genes) in the sample
of 13,484 genes (Figure 2). The permutation tests show
that genes involved in the same-strand overlaps have
much lower length ratio than neighboring non-overlapping genes (Figure 3, p-value << 0.001 for both species).
This makes intuitive sense because most of the samestrand overlaps are in the form of one gene residing in the

other gene's introns. For different-strand overlaps, this
restriction on gene lengths appears to be not as pronounced, because the vast majority of different-strand
overlaps are not embedded forms. However, in differentstrand overlaps the length ratio is still significantly lower
than the ratios in non-overlapping neighboring genes (pvalues < 0.01).
Gain and loss of overlapping genes
We examined the shared overlapping relationship
between human and mouse. We counted the cases where
one gene overlaps with multiple genes as single overlaps.
For same-strand overlaps, only 6 pairs of overlapping
genes are shared between human and mouse, 31 pairs
show overlap in human but not in mouse, and 34 pairs
show overlap in mouse but not in human. In contrast, for
different-strand overlaps, the proportion of shared overlaps between mouse and human is much higher: 215 pairs
are shared between the two species, 335 pairs show overlap in human but not in mouse, and 236 pairs show overlap in mouse but not in human. Therefore, different-

strand overlaps are three times more likely to be conserved in the two species than same-strand overlaps (27%
vs. 8%). A similar observation was made earlier in a comparison of overlapping genes in human and fugu where
~23.3% of different-strand consecutive relationships were
found to be shared between human and fugu, though
only 13.5% of the same-strand gene pairs were found to
be shared between the two organisms [21].
An interesting question on the evolution of overlapping
genes is, "how many overlap gains and losses have
occurred in the human and mouse lineages since their
divergence"? To address this question, we also examined
the overlapping states of the orthologous genes in three
other completed mammalian genomes, Rhesus macaque,
rat, and dog. We required that both genes of an overlapping pair have one-to-one orthologous relationships to
the genes in the three additional species, which is a very
stringent criterion and reduces greatly the number of gene
pairs for our analysis. But it also ensures the confidence in
our inference. Using this criterion, we were left with 325

pairs for this analysis (Table 3). We found that there have
been 15 and 18 gains of same-strand overlap in the
human and mouse lineage, respectively. For differentstrand overlaps, there have been 154 gains of overlap in
human, of which 50 occurred in the ancestral lineage of
human and macaque, 121 gains of overlap in mouse, of
which 20 gains occurred in the ancestral lineage of mouse
and rat, 13 losses of overlap in mouse, of which 10
occurred in the ancestral lineage of mouse and rat, and 4
losses of overlap in human, of which 3 occurred in the
ancestral lineage of human and macaque.

Caution must be taken in interpreting the results.
Although we took steps in minimizing impact of annotation errors on the analysis, we can not guarantee absolute
accuracy. It is well-known that the annotation of UTR is
difficult, especially with 5' UTRs. Therefore, it is likely that
some of the gains and losses of overlaps seen here are
actually annotation artifact. In addition to the annotation
problem, incomplete sequencing can also contribute to
some of the non-conserved overlaps.
Mechanisms of the nonoverlapping-overlapping transition
The observation that less than 30% of the overlaps are
shared between human and mouse suggests fast gain and/

two genes overlap; N: two genes do not overlap.

or loss of overlapping genes. However, could the low
extent of shared overlapping relationships between species be in part due to inaccurate ortholog assignment?
Imagine, for instance, gene A and gene B overlap in
human, gene A is correctly assigned to its mouse ortholog
gene A', whereas gene B is mistakenly assigned to mouse
gene C. The observation that gene A and gene C do not
overlap in mouse can mislead us to conclude that the
overlap is not conserved between species. Therefore, it is
important to make sure that the two genes involved in
overlap in one species both have correct ortholog assignment in the other species. Since we only used the ortholog
prediction in Ensembl, it is likely that some of them are
wrong. We therefore cross-validated the Ensembl humanmouse ortholog prediction using 6 additional ortholog
prediction databases including HGNC [22], Homologene
at NCBI [23], Inparanoid [24], MGI [25], PhIGs [26], and
Treefam [27]. These databases, together with Ensembl,
have independent methods of ortholog prediction and
rely on information extracted from either sequences, phylogenetic trees, chromosomal synteny, or some combinations of these aspects. Therefore, the more databases
predict an ortholog assignment, the higher confidence we
have for the assignment. We found that in 163 of the 636
pairs that show non-conserved overlap relationships, the
ortholog assignments of one or both genes in a pair have
no other database support except Ensembl; the remaining
473 pairs have both genes whose ortholog assignments
have multiple database support; in fact, the majority of
the 473 pairs have more than four databases predicting
the same ortholog assignment (see supplementary materials). Therefore, the majority of our ortholog assignments
are likely accurate and incorrect ortholog assignment
likely contributes little to the low extent of conserved
overlaps between human and mouse.
Then what is the cause for the low extent of shared overlapping relationships between human and mouse? In
other words, what could be the mechanisms for the fast
evolutionary switches between overlapping and non-overlapping genes? One likely mechanism for the switch
between overlapping and non-overlapping states is
genome rearrangement. It might explain the situation

where the two genes under study overlap in one species
but are on different chromosomes in the other species. For
example, 2 mouse pairs that are orthologous to the
human same-strand overlaps are located on different
chromosomes and 19 mouse pairs that are orthologous to
the human different-strand overlaps are located on different chromosomes. However, these genes amount to less
than 4% of the non-conserved gene pairs. Therefore,
genome rearrangement is not a major cause for the transition.
A more likely mechanism for the switch is UTR change,
because the majority of the non-conserved overlapping
cases are such that the genes that overlap in only one species are located on the same chromosome in the other species. As indicated in Figure 4, for two genes that are
neighboring on the same chromosome, the transition
between overlapping and non-overlapping states can be
simply a matter of gain or loss of either 5' UTR, 3' UTR, or
both. For example, a gain of convergent different-strandoverlap genes is fairly simple. The disappearance of a transcription termination site will elongate the RNA transcript
and the transcription may run into the 3' of the neighboring gene, so that the two genes become overlap in the 3'
end. This may also apply to the case of parallel samestrand neighboring genes, that is, the elongated transcription of an upstream gene may run into the 5' end of the
neighboring gene. On the other hand, a gain of divergent
different-strand-overlap genes can occur when the transcription start site (TSS) of a gene moves in the 5' direction, so that it includes the TSS of the neighboring gene.
Similarly, the loss of convergent different-strand overlaps
is simple, namely, the move of a transcription stop site in
the 5' direction will shorten the transcription and the
overlap may thus disappear. The same comment applies
to the case of a parallel overlap.
Given that UTR changes seem to be the major mechanism
for the evolutionary switch, we asked the question: what
are the relative contributions of 5' change and 3' change?
Here we were able to computationally determine whether
the switch between overlapping and non-overlapping
states is due to 5' change or 3' change by taking advantage

Different scenarios for how two genes A and B may switch from non-overlapping to overlapping, and vice versa. The solid
boxes, empty boxes, and empty boxes with arrows are coding exons, 5' UTRs, and 3' UTRs, respectively. Genes A and B are in
red and blue, respectively. Cases a-d denote same-strand overlapping genes, while cases e-h denote different-strand overlapping genes. From a non-overlapping state to an overlapping state: (a) Extension of the 3' UTR in gene A due to loss of the transcription stop signal results in extension of gene A into gene B. Here the extension creates only a partial overlap, but a large
extension may cover the entire gene B. (b) Emergence of a new 3' UTR exon in gene A results in the complete embedment of
gene B within gene A. Unlike case (a), case (b) requires the creation of a new exon, so that it is less likely to occur than case
(a). (c) Emergence of a new transcription start site extends the 5' UTR in gene B to partially cover the 3' UTR of gene A. If the
extension is long, it may entirely cover gene A. (d) Emergence of a new 5' UTR exon in gene B upstream of gene A results in
the embedment of gene A completely inside gene B. (e) Extension of the 3' UTR in gene A due to loss of the transcription stop
signal results in extension of gene A into gene B. Here the extension creates only a partial overlap, but a large extension may
cover the entire gene B. (f) Emergence of a new 3' UTR exon in gene A results in the complete embedment of gene B inside
gene A. (g) Extension of the 5' UTR of gene A in the 5' direction creates a partial overlap of gene A with gene B. (h) Emergence
of a new 5' UTR exon in gene A results in the complete embedment of gene B inside gene A. The opposite scenarios to the
above would create a transition from the overlapping state to a non-overlapping state of two neighboring genes.

of the orthologous gene set and comparing the chromosomal arrangements between overlaps and non-overlaps
in human and mouse (see Materials and Methods for
details). For the same-strand overlaps, the majority of
transitions (~64%) were due to 3' end change and the
remaining due to 5' end change (Table 4); the chi-square
goodness-of-fit test for equal proportions of 5' and 3'
changes is marginally significant (χ2 = 3.27, p-value =
0.07). For the different-strand overlaps, the majority of
transitions (~60%) were due to 3' end change; the chisquare goodness-of-fit test for equal proportions of 5' and
3' changes is highly significant (χ2 = 20.93, p-value = 4.8e6).
Several previous studies examined the transition between
overlapping and non-overlapping genes in eukaryotes.
For example, Shintani et al. [28] studied the evolutionary
origin of TCP1 and ACAT2 that overlap in their 3' UTR on
different strands and suggested that the overlap arose during the transitions from therapsid reptiles to mammals
and has been retained for >200 million years. They proposed that the two genes were brought together and
became overlapping during a chromosome rearrangement. Dan et al. [29] examined the origin of the overlapping genes of Mink and Chrne and found that the two
genes overlap in some mammals but not others owing to
different usages of alternative polyadenylation sites.
Besides these studies that examined individual cases of
overlapping genes in eukaryotes, there have not been any
systematic investigations of the causes for the transitions
between overlapping and non-overlapping genes, especially for same-strand overlaps. Here, our results on ~600
pairs of overlapping genes in the two mammalian
genomes indicate that 3' UTR evolution (gains or losses of
3' transcriptional stop signals) plays a major role in the
transition. This seems to be consistent with the recent
finding that at least half of all human genes encode multiple transcripts with alternative 3' termini [30]. The
higher frequency of transition contributed by 3' UTR
changes than by 5' UTR changes implies that it is easier to
capture and utilize a downstream alternative termination
signal than an upstream alternative start signal. We can get
a rough estimate on the respective rates of the two UTRs'
evolution. Under the assumption of 80 million years for

the divergence time between human and mouse, and the
observations that among the total of 857 overlapping
gene pairs, there are at least 355 pairs that have gain or
loss of 3' UTR and 236 pairs that have gain or loss of 5'
UTRs, we estimate that the transition due to 3' UTR
change occurs at a rate of ~2.6 per gene pair per billion
years and that due to 5' UTR change occurs at a rate of ~1.7
per gene pair per billion years. Thus, rates of gain or loss
of UTRs are only somewhat lower than rates of point
mutation.
These estimates should be taken with caution as they are
crude; although they tend to be conservative, their accuracy can be only as good as the annotation quality of
UTRs. Another word of caution is that the higher rate of 3'
UTR evolution than 5' UTR could also be partially due to
more accurate 3' UTR annotations. Since annotation of
UTRs relies to a large extent on ESTs (expressed sequence
tags) and since ESTs are biased towards the 3'end of a
gene, it is expected that 3' UTRs are better annotated than
5' UTR; thus, alternative usage of 3' UTRs in genes will be
more frequently recognized than that of 5' UTRs.

Conclusion
When gene structure becomes better annotated, we might
discover that many genes have multiple alternative 5' or 3'
UTRs for transcription, so that two neighboring genes may
become overlapping with each other in certain transcribed
forms. Thus, it is likely that overlapping genes are even
more common than estimated in this study.

Methods
Compilation and classification of overlapping genes
We obtained the dataset from Ensembl (version 44) using
the data mining tool Biomart. We limited our analysis to
protein-coding genes. We did not consider alternative
splicing forms of a gene to be overlapping genes (broadly
speaking, they may be considered as a special kind of
overlapping genes). Because we are especially interested in
addressing the evolution of overlapping genes, we require
that all genes in our study have strict orthologs between
human and mouse genomes. Ensembl contains allagainst-all BLASTP results for these two species and the
pairwise species comparisons. A gene was added to the list
of putative orthologous genes only if the gene in human

has a unique best reciprocal hit to a gene in mouse and the
ortholog relationship is also supported by a phylogenetic
analysis [31]. With these criteria, we identified 13,484
pairs of orthologous genes. These genes were then
checked for possible overlaps using the Ensembl gene
annotation. According to the annotated start and end
positions on chromosomes, two genes were considered to
overlap with each other if they share a region longer than
50 base pairs. The overlapping gene pairs were then classified into (1) the same-strand overlap type if the genes
involved were on the same strand or (2) the differentstrand overlap type if the genes were on opposite strands.
Length ratio computation
The length comparison was done by computing the ratio
of lengths of the shorter and the longer genes in the overlapping gene pair. We considered the same- and differentstrand overlaps separately. In addition, we computed the
length ratios of the shorter and the longer genes of nonoverlapping neighboring gene pairs in the 13,484 genes
under study. Here a non-overlapping neighboring gene
pair refers to, in the collection of the 13,484 genes, a pair
of genes that do not overlap but are next to each other on
the same chromosome. In human, there are a total of
4831 such non-overlapping neighboring gene pairs
located on the same strand and 4950 pairs on opposite
strands. In mouse, there are 4742 such non-overlapping
neighboring pairs on the same strand and 4864 pairs on
opposite strands. A simple permutation test was performed to formally compare the length distributions
between different types of genes. Specifically, for each
sample, we randomly picked length ratios with replacement from the length ratios of the genome until the sample contained the same number of length ratios as the one
under study. We repeated this procedure 10,000 times to
create 10,000 samples. The mean of the length ratios in
each sample was calculated and used as the metric for the
test. The significance level of the test for same- or different-strand overlaps was determined as the frequency of
observing a mean less than the observed mean of length
ratios for the respective type of overlap. Note that the Wilcoxon rank sum tests show that the distribution of the
lengths of the 13,484 genes is not significantly different
from the distribution of the lengths of the overlapping
genes (p-values > 0.3), which satisfies the requirement of
the permutation tests.
Models of transition between non-overlapping genes and
overlapping genes
Theoretically, two neighboring genes can switch from
non-overlapping to overlapping through a 5' change (e.g.,
gaining a new upstream start signal), a 3' change (e.g.,
gaining a new downstream termination signal), or a combination of both mechanisms (Fig. 1). Similarly, one can
also imagine a switch from overlapping to non-overlap-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/169

ping by a change in the 5' UTR, in the 3' UTR, or a combination of both.
However, it may be difficult to determine computationally whether the transition is due to a 5' or a 3' change
alone or a combination of 5' and 3' changes. Fortunately,
we can take advantage of the fact that most of the overlapping genes on the same strand are embedded forms and
can decide for these cases whether the transition was
caused by a 5' or a 3' change using the idea illustrated in
cases b and d of Figure 4. Specifically, we compared the
order of start positions of a gene pair of embedded samestrand overlaps with those of their orthologous gene pairs
in the other species (the dog and rat genomes were also
used to reduce annotation errors) that do not overlap but
are on the same strand of the chromosome. If the orders
of the start positions are the same in the two species, the
cause of transition between overlapping and non-overlapping states was due to 3' change (case b); otherwise, it was
5' change (case d). For different-strand overlaps, if the two
genes are in convergent orientation, transition between
non-overlapping and overlapping states can be due to 3'
change in one or both genes (cases e and f). If the two
genes are in divergent orientation, the transition can be
due to 5' change in one or both genes (cases g and h).
Gain and loss of overlapping genes
An interesting issue is the gain and loss of overlapping
states. To address this question, we also examined the
overlapping states of the orthologous genes in three other
completed mammalian genomes, Rhesus macaque, rat, and
dog. We determined gain and loss of overlaps using the
maximum parsimony principle [32] and the species tree.
We limited this analysis to gene pairs for which both
genes have one-to-one orthologous relationships to the
genes in the three additional species. The Ensembl
ortholog assignment is based on the comparison between
the gene tree and the species tree and is thus expected to
be more accurate than the assignment of simply reciprocal
best hits. Specifically, the one-to-one orthology refers to
the case where a gene tree is consistent with the species
tree and there is no duplication in the interested species
after speciation [31]. This criterion of requiring a one-toone orthologous relationship in all the additional species
is very stringent and reduces greatly the number of gene
pairs for our analysis. But it also ensures the confidence in
our inference.
