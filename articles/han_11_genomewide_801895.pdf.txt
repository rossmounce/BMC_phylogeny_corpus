Abstract
Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of sequence variation among
plants and are often functionally important. We describe the use of 454 technology and high resolution melting
analysis (HRM) for high throughput SNP discovery in tetraploid alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), a species with high
economic value but limited genomic resources.
Results: The alfalfa genotypes selected from M. sativa subsp. sativa var. ‘Chilean’ and M. sativa subsp. falcata var.
‘Wisfal’, which differ in water stress sensitivity, were used to prepare cDNA from tissue of clonally-propagated plants
grown under either well-watered or water-stressed conditions, and then pooled for 454 sequencing. Based on
125.2 Mb of raw sequence, a total of 54,216 unique sequences were obtained including 24,144 tentative consensus
(TCs) sequences and 30,072 singletons, ranging from 100 bp to 6,662 bp in length, with an average length of 541
bp. We identified 40,661 candidate SNPs distributed throughout the genome. A sample of candidate SNPs were
evaluated and validated using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. A total of 3,491 TCs harboring 20,270
candidate SNPs were located on the M. truncatula (MT 3.5.1) chromosomes. Gene Ontology assignments indicate
that sequences obtained cover a broad range of GO categories.
Conclusions: We describe an efficient method to identify thousands of SNPs distributed throughout the alfalfa
genome covering a broad range of GO categories. Validated SNPs represent valuable molecular marker resources
that can be used to enhance marker density in linkage maps, identify potential factors involved in heterosis and
genetic variation, and as tools for association mapping and genomic selection in alfalfa.

Background
DNA pyrosequencing using 454 sequencing technology
enables sequencing millions of high-quality DNA bases
per sequencing run [1,2]. This method has been used
successfully for transcriptome sequencing and identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in many
plant species including maize (Zea mays L.) [3], sugarcane (Saccarum spp.) [4], eucalyptus (Eucalyptus
grandis) [5], and the model legume and close relative of
alfalfa, M. truncatula [6]. The M. truncatula genome is
one of three legume genomes including Lotus japonicus

and soybean (Glycine max) that have been assembled
and annotated [7,8]. SNPs are the most common
sequence variation among plants and are often functionally important. SNPs can be converted into genetic markers that can be inexpensively assayed using highthroughput approaches [9]. Traditionally, molecular
markers have been used to determine genetic relatedness between plant materials, to assist in the identification of novel sources of genetic variation, to study
evolutionary relationships, to confirm the pedigree and
identity of new varieties, in population structure analysis
and association genetics, to locate quantitative trait loci
(QTLs) and genes of interest, and for marker-assisted
breeding [10]. The value and uses of DNA markers have
been shaped in large part by innovations in marker
technologies that increase throughput and reduce costs

per data point [11]. A large number of molecular markers can be used in high-throughput genotyping platforms in association mapping studies to dissect complex
traits and in molecular breeding approaches at the
whole genome level [12].
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is one of the most important
forage legume species worldwide and the third most valuable crop in the USA ($8 billion per annum). Alfalfa is a
high yielding perennial species that requires little or no
nitrogen fertilizer because of its ability to carry out symbiotic nitrogen fixation and can be harvested multiple
times during the growing season. Therefore, it has been an
important component of sustainable agricultural systems
for many years and has recently been promoted as a
potential bioenergy crop [13]. Cultivated alfalfa is tetraploid (2n = 4x = 32) and displays tetrasomic inheritance
[14]. Alfalfa is partially self-incompatible and populations
are extremely polymorphic due to their high degree of
outcrossing. Inbreeding severely depresses plant vigor and
fertility in tetraploid alfalfa due to the loss of complementary gene interactions [15,16], preventing the development
of inbred lines. A significant level of sequence conservation was reported between alfalfa and M. truncatula [17]
allowing estimates of marker colinearity between the two
species [18]. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed from M. truncatula and some alfalfa sequences are
currently available [19-21]. Alfalfa like many other crop
species, lacks validated SNP markers which are required in
large numbers for map-based gene isolation, association
genetics and genomic selection approaches [10].
High-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis has
proven to be a highly sensitive method for mutation discovery and SNP genotyping [22]. Nucleic acid melting is
tracked by monitoring the fluorescence of the samples
across a defined temperature range generating highresolution melting profiles that are used to identify the
presence of sequence variation within the amplicon [23].
Base-pair mismatches shift the stability of a duplex by
varying amounts depending on the particular mismatch,
the mismatch position, and neighboring base pairs [24].
HRM was successfully implemented to assay SNP variation in diploid and tetraploid alfalfa [25].
We describe the generation of thousands of alfalfa
ESTs (expressed sequence tags) obtained using 454
sequencing technology and the first iteration of genome-wide SNP identification in tetraploid alfalfa, a nonmodel plant species that currently lacks a sequenced
genome. A sample of candidate SNPs were experimentally validated using a HRM platform.

Results
Sequence assembly and annotation

Root and shoot samples were collected during progressively developing water stress from clonal propagules of

each alfalfa genotype. RNA was purified and a pooled
sample for each genotype was used to construct 454
Titanium cDNA libraries. The two libraries were
sequenced on separate 454 half-plates that generated
(after trimming and removal of reads less than 100 bp)
155,120 reads with a total length of 57.5 Mb from genotype Chilean and 177,871 reads with a total length of
67.6 Mb from genotype Wisfal (Table 1). The raw
sequences were clustered and assembled separately for
each genotype and also as a combined set using TGICL
clustering utility [26]. The combined sequence assembly
with the two genotypes resulted in 24,144 TCs and
30,072 singletons ranging from 100 to 6,662 bases, with
an average length of 541 bases. Alfalfa transcriptome
sequences were submitted to the short read database
and transcript assembly database in GenBank (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and were assigned the accession
numbers [Genbank: JL866457-JL881209], [Genebank:
JL881210-JL898333], [Genbank: SRX040822], and [GenBank: SRX040823], respectively for Wisfal short reads,
Chilean short reads, Chilean assembly, and Wisfal
assembly. For the purposes of annotation, the combined
alfalfa transcript assemblies were located on the Medicago truncatula Gene Index (MtGI) Release 10.0 maintained by the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (http://

compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=medicago). A total of 41,350 alfalfa unique sequences
(76%) had a blastn hit to 24,358 MtGI sequences (cut
off E value 1e-10). For the 41,350 sequences with hits in
the MtGI database, Gene Ontology (GO) categories of
their best match were assigned to each sequence. The
proportion of alfalfa 454 sequences in each category follows the same general trend as the MtGI (Figure 1),
indicating sequence coverage of a broad range of genes
in the alfalfa 454 sequences.
Alignment of alfalfa sequences to the M. truncatula
genome

The available M. truncatula genome sequence was used
as a scaffold to align the alfalfa transcript sequences.
Under stringent conditions using Blat, including a
threshold of 95% identity and 90% coverage (Figure 2),
20,067 (10,911 TCs and 9,156 singletons) unique
sequences (37%) were mapped to the MT 3.5.1 genome
sequence assembly. Among these, a total of 20,270 candidate SNPs were identified in 3,491 TCs mapped to the
M. truncatula genome (Table 2) and their likely map
positions inferred. To identify the number of distinct
loci represented in the alfalfa transcript assemblies, they
were searched against the M. truncatula v 3.5 pseudomolecules annotation. At the nucleotide level, 32,606
(60%) of the alfalfa 454 sequences had a blastn (cut off
E value 1e-10) hit with 15,932 M. truncatula CDS. We

essentially obtained the same result at the amino acid
level, in which 35,791 (66%) of the alfalfa 454 sequences
had a blastx hit (cut off E value 10-5) to 15,870 M. truncatula predicted proteins.
When combined with the MtGI results, 46,086 (85%)
alfalfa sequences had a blastn or blastx hit in MtGI and/
or MT3.5 databases. Of the remaining 8,130 alfalfa
sequences, 992 of them had a blastx hit (cut off E value
1e-5) with 763 proteins in the soybean Glyma1.0 high
confidence gene protein database [27] and 732 alfalfa
sequences had a blastx hit (cut off E value 1e-5 ) with
572 L. japonicus proteins [28] further supporting the
notion of shared sequences among legumes. Only 12 of
the remaining 7,057 alfalfa sequences without a match
in any of the aforementioned databases had a hit in the
Arabidopsis TAIR 9.0 protein database (cut off E value
1e-5). The remaining 7,045 sequences represent a total
length of 2.3 Mb (8% of the total sequences post-assembly), did not have a significant match when blasted
against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database
suggesting they may be miss-assembled or novel
sequences.
SNP discovery and validation

Candidate SNPs were called based on sequence alignments within and between the Chilean and Wisfal genotypes. A total of 40,661 candidate SNPs were identified
in 7,342 TCs within or between the two genotypes. The

SNPs were assigned to four Categories based on their
allelic composition (Figure 3). Candidate SNPs in the
first three Categories have only two variants and include
97% of all candidate SNPs identified. Category 1 SNPs
are between the two genotypes and homozygous within
each genotype (e.g. Chilean = A, and Wisfal = C). Category 2 SNPs are heterozygous within one genotype and
homozygous in the other (e.g. Chilean = A/C and Wisfal
= A, or Chilean = A and Wisfal = A/C). Category 2 is
the most abundant type of SNPs and constitutes 60% of
all candidate SNPs; Category 1 is the second most abundant type with 21% of all candidate SNPs. SNPs in Category 3 (16%) are biallelic and heterozygous within each
genotype (e.g. Chilean = A/C and Wisfal = A/C). Category 4 SNPs have more than two variants (e.g. Chilean
= A/C/G or/and Wisfal = A/C/T) and account for only
3% of all candidate SNPs identified. We focused on validating Category 2 SNPs due to their suitability for mapping in tetraploid alfalfa based on their segregation
patterns in this population. Category 1 SNPs are heterozygous in all F1 individuals from the mapping population resulting from a cross between two homozygous
genotypes and thus not suitable for mapping. In this
study, candidate SNPs represented in Categories 3 and 4
were not considered for validation or mapping due to
the complexity of their segregation patterns in this autotetraploid outcrossing species.
A subset of 192 candidate SNPs (MSSNPV001 to
MSSNPV192) identified in the alfalfa transcriptome
were used to design primer pairs (Additional File 1) for
SNP validation through PCR amplification and HRM
analysis. The majority of SNP primers (176) were
designed to target Category 2 candidate SNPs and 16
primer pairs targeted Category 1 candidate SNPs (Additional File 2). A Category 1 SNP is homozygous within
each genotype but different between the two genotypes.
The anticipated HRM profile for a Category 1 SNP
includes two different and distinct HRM peaks, each of
which corresponds to a different homozygous allelic
state. Category 1 SNP marker MSSNPV002 (Figure 4A),
results in a melting peak for Wisfal (AAAA, shown in
black) and a melting peak for Chilean (GGGG, shown in
red). Two of the 16 Category 1 candidate SNPs were not
validated and resulted in overlapping melting peaks
between the two genotypes, as shown for MSSNPV001
(Figure 4D). The melting curve peak from Category 2
SNP MSSNPV072 corresponding to Chilean, the heterozygous genotype, is shorter and wider than the peak
corresponding to Wisfal, the homozygous genotype (Figure 5A). The HRM profiles from the remaining 13 Category 1 candidate SNPs were complex, indicating the
existence of additional SNPs within the amplicon
sequence that were not predicted by 454 sequencing
(Figure 4B and 4C). Results from the HRM evaluation

of the 176 Category 2 candidate SNPs indicate that 119
of them displayed the anticipated Category 2 SNP profile (Figure 5A), 49 showed complex profiles indicating
the presence of additional SNPs not predicted based on
the 454 sequences (Figure 5B and 5C), and eight candidate SNP were not validated (Figure 5D) based on overlapping melting curves and amplicon sequencing (Figure
5D). Sequencing of the PCR amplicon obtained from
MSSNPV072 confirmed a single SNP at position 37
between the two genotypes (Figure 5A). A total of 120
SNPs were validated, while 62 SNP primers (32.3%)
resulted in the identification of additional SNPs. For
example, the predicted Category 1 SNP for MSSNPV008
at position 68 (G vs. C) was confirmed by sequencing
and additional SNPs were identified at position 48 and
position 99 (Figure 4B). The predicted Category 2 SNP
at position 94 for MSSNPV075 was confirmed, and
additional SNPs were identified at position 42 and position 48 (Figure 5B). In the case of SNP MSSNPV032,
the predicted SNP at position 85 was confirmed, and
three additional SNPs were also detected (Figure 5C).
Variation in depth of sequence coverage was observed
for the SNP-containing sequences between the two genotypes. Both genotypes were represented in at least 46
sequence reads in the case of validated SNP

MSSNPV002 (data not shown). In contrast, candidate
SNP MSSNPV001 had less than five sequence reads
representing each genotype. Overall, validated candidate
SNPs had higher depth of 454 sequence coverage than
non-validated SNPs in both Category 1 and Category 2
SNPs.

Discussion
SNP markers have a broad range of applications and a
large number of markers are needed to implement association genetics approaches and genomic selection in
plants with low levels of LD [12,29]. Large scale SNP
discovery efforts in a wide range of crop plants are currently limited to a few species. Previous SNP discovery
approaches in other species include sequence comparisons between the Arabidopsis ecotypes Landsberg and
Columbia [30] and subspecies of rice [31]. Although
alfalfa is the most widely cultivated forage legume, it
lacks genomics resource development compared to
other crop species, partly because it is an autotetraploid,
perennial outcrossing species. Thus, a whole genome
SNP discovery effort is among the most critical endeavors to develop the necessary tools and integrate molecular breeding approaches in alfalfa. In this study, we
utilized 454 sequencing for genome-wide SNP discovery

between and within two genotypes from M. sativa
subsp. sativa (Chilean) and M. sativa subsp. falcata
(Wisfal), which have contrasting phenotypes for water
stress tolerance. Sequencing and SNP discovery based
on transcriptome sequencing of water stressed plants
increased the likelihood of having sequence coverage in
genes relevant to water-stress and identification of allelic
differences in these genes between the two alfalfa genotypes evaluated in this study.
Sequence assembly and alignment to M. truncatula

The close phylogenetic relationship between M. truncatula and alfalfa, same basic chromosome number (x =
8), high degree of sequence similarity and marker co-linearity [17,18] facilitated using the M. truncatula genome

sequence as a scaffold to align alfalfa transcriptome
sequences. Despite the size and complexity of the alfalfa
genome, alignments of alfalfa 454 sequences throughout
the M. truncatula genome were apparent (Figure 2).
The M. truncatula genome sequence project targeted
the euchromatic region and available data indicate that
66% of the genes captured in the current pseudomolecules and 24% of the genes in M. truncatula captured in
the fragmented Illumina assemblies are found within the
euchromatin. Therefore, the M. truncatula genome provides a valuable resource for gene annotation of alfalfa
sequences. The identification of some alfalfa sequences
without alignment to the M. truncatula genome is not
unexpected considering that M. truncatula is a selfing,
annual diploid species and alfalfa is an outcrossing,

perennial tetraploid species with a considerably larger
genome. Additionally, non-alignment of alfalfa
sequences to the M. truncatula genome could occur in
regions where there have been authentic genome rearrangements between the two species. We demonstrated
the feasibility of using genomic resources from model
species to quickly assemble transcriptome sequences
from related species. These alfalfa resources can also
facilitate opportunities to further understand legume
genome structure and evolution.
SNP discovery and validation

454 sequencing is a high-throughput approach to identify sequence variation and was utilized successfully here
to identify SNP variation in tetraploid alfalfa. Alfalfa is
genetically very diverse and the existence of heterosis

between M. sativa subsp. sativa and M. sativa subsp.
falcata was previously reported [32,33]. Because Chilean
and Wisfal are highly heterozygous outcrossing lines,
transcriptome sequencing of alfalfa genotypes enabled
the identification of gene-associated SNPs within and
between genotypes covering a range of gene functions
and location in the genome. Reports that 454 sequencing technology may be susceptible to indel-type errors
[1] prompted us to consider only base substitutions (i.e.
SNPs) with stringent SNP prediction criteria.
The HRM platform proved to be a suitable method
for validation and genotyping of a large number of candidate SNPs. The HRM melting curve profiles enables
identification of homozygous and heterozygous SNP
genotypes [34]. We report a 62.5% rate of validation of
single candidate SNPs (120 out of the 192) indicating

Han et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:350
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/350

that transcriptome sequencing of a crop legume with
economic value and assembly of those transcript
sequences using the genome of a closely related model
species is a viable strategy for genome-wide SNP discovery efforts. Studies in eucalyptus reported a 83% rate of
validation from the candidate SNPs [5]. Additional SNP
in alfalfa were detected using HRM that were not predicted based on the bioinformatics analysis from the 454
sequences. These findings were partly due to our efforts
to minimize the false discovery rate in sequences with
low depth of sequence coverage. Therefore, the challenge for SNP discovery using 454 sequences in a highly
heterozygous species such as alfalfa resides in limitations
from the depth of sequence coverage rather than
sequencing errors. In contrast to a diploid species, tetraploid species have four homologous chromosomes and
therefore deeper sequence coverage is needed to accurately ascertain the SNP variation within and among
genotypes. Although an increase in the rate of SNP prediction can be obtained using less stringent SNP parameters, it also increases the likelihood of false positive
SNP calls. The discrepancy between SNP detection and
validation could also be the result of preferential allele
expression or allele silencing in the pooled cDNA sample that was used because the initial SNP identification
was based on cDNA sequencing whereas validation was
made using PCR fragments amplified from genomic
DNA. The identified SNPs complement our current
work identifying genomic regions associated with water
stress tolerance in backcross populations developed
from the same two genotypes used for 454 sequencing.
Previous efforts to identify sequence polymorphism in
alfalfa include array hybridizations that identify single
feature polymorphisms (SFP) using M. truncatula Affy
Chips [35]. The approach described here enables the
discovery of SNPs within genes that may not be present
on an array developed for the model M. truncatula.
Additionally, SNP discovery efforts based on transcriptome sequencing in a crop species may result in the
identification of SNPs with functional relevance to agriculturally important traits such as persistence, likely not
present in an annual model system.
The large number of candidate SNPs with potential
functional relevance identified in this study provides a
valuable tool for comparative genomic studies between
M. truncatula and alfalfa, and potentially to other forage
legume species including white and red clover. Evaluations of SNP variability, frequency, and distribution, as
well as estimates of linkage disequilibrium in alfalfa are
now attainable research targets. Applications of croprelated SNP discovery efforts include genetic diversity
analysis, increasing the marker density of genetic maps
to support high-resolution association and linkage mapping of target traits, facilitation of future genome

assembly of this highly complex genome, integration of
genetic and physical maps, and increasing the feasibility
of integrating marker-dense molecular breeding
approaches such as genomic selection in this important
forage legume.

Conclusions
In order to enhance crop productivity, we need to
improve our understanding of the genes involved in
plant growth, development, and adaptation to a changing environment including suboptimal soil conditions
and biotic and abiotic stress conditions. The 454 ESTbased SNP discovery and validation pipeline described
here focused on two tetraploid alfalfa subspecies with
contrasting water stress tolerance provides a platform
for the discovery of agriculturally-relevant genes and
corresponding SNPs. The availability of a large number
of validated SNPs is a valuable molecular marker
resource for genetics, high-resolution linkage and association mapping, and molecular breeding approaches
using genomic selection, for practical and agriculturallyrelevant improvements in alfalfa which are not feasible
using model systems.
Methods
Plant materials

Two tetraploid alfalfa genotypes (sampled from M.
sativa subsp. sativa var. ‘Chilean’ and M. sativa subsp.
falcata var. ‘Wisfal’ [36] were clonally propagated and
grown in metromix and sand mixture (4:1 v:v). Plant tissue was sampled at seven time points during a progressively developing water deficit including: well-watered,
three, seven, nine, 11 and 14 days after withholding
water, and one-day re-watering on day 15. Roots and
shoots were sampled separately. Two to four clonal propagules of each genotype were sampled at each time
point. For each genotype, cDNA was prepared from
shoot and root tissue of each clonally propagated sample
grown under either well-watered or water-stressed conditions, and then equal amounts of cDNA from each
sampling point were pooled for sequencing using 454
sequencing technology.
cDNA preparation and sequencing

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol® (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations, digested with DNAseI (Ambion, Austin, TX),
column purified with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-100 (NanoDrop Technologies, Willington, DE). Total RNA integrity was assessed
using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
Messenger RNA (mRNA) isolation was performed using
Poly(A)Purist(tm) MAG (Magnetic mRNA Purification

Kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). For the first strand cDNA
synthesis, three microgram of mRNA was used with
Oligo (dT)12-18 and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase
followed by a second cDNA synthesis (dscDNA) using
Superscript First and Double Stranded cDNA synthesis
Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Double stranded cDNA
from roots and shoots from the same genotype was
pooled and deep sequenced using Titanium 454 technology at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) with each
genotype occupying half of a 454 sequencing plate.
Sequence analysis

The raw sequences were assembled for each genotype
separately and then combined (Table 1) using TGICL
clustering utility [24] with The Paracel Transcript
Assembler instead of CAP3 and a modified version of
the TIGR Gene Index pipeline. The blast searches were
performed using TCs and singletons from the assembly
with the two genotypes combined (Table 1). All TCs
and singletons were blasted against the MtGI 10.0 database using Blastn with e-10 as a cut-off expected value.
The TCs and singletons were assigned to the GO categories based on their top hit.

a LightScanner 384-well system (Idaho Technologies,
Salt Lake, UT) and a melting cycle was performed by
increasing the temperature at 0.1°C s-1 from 56 to 95°C.
Melting data was analyzed and visualized with the LightScanner Software with CALL-IT 2.0 (Idaho Technologies, Salt Lake, UT) using the small amplicon module.
Re-sequencing PCR amplicons

The PCR amplicons from twenty candidate SNP primers
were cleaned using Exo/SAP-IT PCR product cleanup
kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix, Inc., Cleveland, OH) and directly sequenced using a
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using both forward
and reverse primers. The amplicons were analyzed using
an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (PE-ABI, Foster City,
CA). The sequence data was analyzed and aligned for
SNP discovery with Sequencher 4.8 (Gene Codes).

SNP discovery and validation

Candidate SNP calls were predicted using Perl scripts to
parse the transcript assembly files and requiring a minimum coverage of at least two 454 reads for each form
of the SNP at the variant position. A confidence score
was generated based on the percent of nucleotides
matching the surrounding regions of the location of the
SNP. Low confidence regions with less than 90% identity
where a SNP was called were not included in the final
SNP predictions. SNPs were quality controlled by
remapping the 454 reads back onto the assembly and
checked against the ACE alignment files. Indels were
ignored and the process was biased towards getting
good quality SNPs vs. getting all the SNPs at the
expense of false SNP calls. Primer3 was used to design
primers targeting candidate SNPs. Criteria for primer
design include a predicted annealing temperature (Tm)
of 59°C to 61°C, primer length ranging between 18-24
bp and PCR amplicon lengths of 40 to 200 bp. All PCR
reactions were performed in 384-well plates using a
9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) using a total volume of 5 mL per well. The
PCR reaction mixture consisted of 5 ng of genomic
DNA, 0.25 μM of forward and reverse primer, 1X LightScanner High Sensitivity Master Mix (Idaho Technologies, Salt Lake, UT, USA) and 10 mL mineral oil. After
an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 95°C, 45 PCR
cycles were performed with 30 s of denaturation at 94°C
and 30 s at the target annealing temperature, followed
by a final hold at 4°C. Samples were then transferred to
