Abstract
Background: While studies of non-model organisms are critical for many research areas, such as
evolution, development, and environmental biology, they present particular challenges for both
experimental and computational genomic level research. Resources such as mass-produced
microarrays and the computational tools linking these data to functional annotation at the system
and pathway level are rarely available for non-model species. This type of "systems-level" analysis
is critical to the understanding of patterns of gene expression that underlie biological processes.
Results: We describe a bioinformatics pipeline known as FunnyBase that has been used to store,
annotate, and analyze 40,363 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the heart and liver of the fish,
Fundulus heteroclitus. Primary annotations based on sequence similarity are linked to networks of
systematic annotation in Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) and can be queried and computationally utilized in downstream analyses. Steps are taken
to ensure that the annotation is self-consistent and that the structure of GO is used to identify
higher level functions that may not be annotated directly. An integrated framework for cDNA
library production, sequencing, quality control, expression data generation, and systems-level
analysis is presented and utilized. In a case study, a set of genes, that had statistically significant
regression between gene expression levels and environmental temperature along the Atlantic
Coast, shows a statistically significant (P < 0.001) enrichment in genes associated with amine
metabolism.
Conclusion: The methods described have application for functional genomics studies, particularly
among non-model organisms. The web interface for FunnyBase can be accessed at http://
genomics.rsmas.miami.edu/funnybase/super_craw4/. Data and source code are available by request

Background
Investigating patterns of gene expression using mouse and
human microarrays has produced insights into cancer
[1,2], cardiac diseases [3-6], and metabolic disorders [712]. These and many other functional genomics studies
rely on full genomic sequence to establish well-annotated
databases. Yet, microarrays based on EST collections are
increasingly being used for diverse species, from honey
bees to fish [13-20] and including simple diploblastic
organisms [21]. These studies within a diversity of organisms provide insights not provided by 'model' species
(species that are genetically well defined or with annotated genomes [22]). For example, 'non-model' organisms
have provided insight into the natural variation in gene
expression [23], social castes among bees [24,25], hypoxia
[26], and physiological responses to variation in the thermal environment [27,28]. To investigate adaptive variation in gene expression we use the teleost Fundulus
heteroclitus (killifish) [23,29].
The killifish Fundulus heteroclitus are distributed along the
eastern coast of North America which has one of the steepest thermal clines in the world: northern populations have
environmental temperatures more than 12°C below
southern populations across 12 degrees of latitude. Migration among populations is sufficient to minimize random
genetic drift [30] but not frequent enough to extinguish
local adaptation [31,32]. Populations are large (>10,000)
and affected by historical, demographic and selective constraints, providing a framework for the partitioning of variation in gene expression within and among populations.
Additionally, the well-established phylogenetic relationship among Fundulus species can be used to discern adaptive changes [23,33,34]. These characteristics make F.
heteroclitus an ideal species to investigate adaptive variation in gene expression.
Microarrays from diverse EST collections offer opportunities to address many biological problems, but to effectively use this information often requires a locally
generated bioinformatics approach. Tools like the TIGR
Gene index [35] and Unigene [36] provide significant
information on many species, yet these databases do not
meet the needs of functional genomics projects for many
non-model species. Currently, TIGR and NCBI provide
gene indices for 28 and 23 animal species, respectively.
Yet, there are 63 animal species with more than 10,000
ESTs [37]. The number of species with ESTs >10,000 has
continued to grow, and there was approximately a 20%
increase in the preceding three months. While annotation
from these resources can be accessed through web-based
homology searches, for many laboratory collections of
ESTs it is difficult to use existing tools to achieve a systems-level view of gene functions and relationships.
Rather than simply browsing functional information over

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/96

the web for a different group's project, laboratories that
produce novel EST collections and microarrays require
customized databases providing access to integrated functional annotation as expression data are being analyzed.
We have developed FunnyBase to meet these functional
genomics needs. FunnyBase provides functional information for >40,000 ESTs from the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus, provides the means to quickly process, evaluate,
and store annotation based on similarity searches of public resources, and integrates these data with species-specific clustering and microarray analysis. Perhaps
ironically, the greatest challenge for functional annotation based on similarity searches is an overabundance of
data. There are a number of databases to chose from, and
often the single best hit from a given database search is
not the most informative. FunnyBase implements a strategy to make maximum use of systems-level functional
information from Gene Ontology (GO) [38] assignments
and membership in metabolic pathways as defined by the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [39].
Specifically, several sequence databases are queried and
results integrated to maximize the number of annotated
sequences. Alignments and scores for all homology based
associations are tracked, allowing further evaluation and
statistical studies.
Microarray data using genes annotated in FunnyBase can
be systematically analyzed in the context of biological
functions. We present a case study to illustrate how assessment of systems-level annotation can identify statistically
significant functional differences among sets of genes.

Results and discussion
FunnyBase (Fig. 1) is divided into 3 modules: Sequence
Pipeline, Hierarchical Annotation, and Microarray Production and Analysis. The Sequence Pipeline takes
sequences and quality output files from the sequencer,
applies vector screening, quality trimming, clone tracking,
and clustering (described below) to produce a set of
unique sequences that are deposited in the 'Sequence
Data' and 'Cluster Data' tables. Notice "unique
sequences" are a combination of singletons (single
unique ESTs) and clusters of overlapping sequences.
The Hierarchical Annotation module uses the consensus
sequences from the clusters or singletons, and integrates
primary annotation such as gene name and description
with associated pathways and systems-level functional
annotation. This may include gene function (e.g., enzyme
catalyst), metabolic or signal pathway (e.g., oxidative
phosphorylation), or biological function (e.g., protein
translation). Sequence data from the first module and
functional annotation from the second are matched using
database similarity searches (BLASTX and BLASTN). E-val-

microarray production and analysis. Database tables are shown in cylinders, arrows are data flow, and dashed lines indicate the
integration of data from multiple sources.

ues, bit scores and local alignments are stored in the 'Similarity Data' table for all significant matches. One of the
strengths of FunnyBase is the use of different sequence
databases (SwissProt [40], NCBI UniGene [36], and NCBI
non-redundant NR [41]) to provide separate annotations.
Although these databases are not completely independent, the three separate annotations provide verification of
gene names.
The third module, Microarray Production & Analysis provides a list of unique genes to be printed and integrates
expression data from microarray experiments with the
Hierarchical Annotation module. This provides func-

tional annotation for expression data. FunnyBase annotation is accessible through the web or through local SQL
queries and data-mining scripts.
EST isolation and sequencing
The overall strategy used to isolate and sequence thousands of Fundulus cDNAs was (1) generate a high quality
unidirectional cDNA library, (2) normalize the library,
(3) randomly pick colonies and amplify by PCR the cDNA
within the vector, (4) sequence and identify PCR products, and (5) after approximately every 1,000 clones, subtract these from the normalized library and repeat steps 3–
5. Details for all protocols are provided at http://craw

Functional Genomic course at Mount Desert Island, ME

We sequenced 46,433 ESTs and 40,043 of these are available in the dbEST database at NCBI (dbEST identification
numbers: 23,480,307 to 23,515,306; 23,520,047 to
23,525,409 and 24,320,128 to 24,320,184) as of June 26,
2004. Sequences in FunnyBase are identified by a number

and

(example:
23434_125_001_H04). The remaining 6,966 un-submitted sequences failed to meet one of the sequence quality
parameters. Two criteria are used for defining "good"
sequences: 1) >100 bp of sequence with Phred score >20
or 2) form an overlapping cluster with other sequences.
Of the 19,937 sequences processed with the current version of FunnyBase, 17,893 (90%) passed one of these
quality parameters. In earlier iterations of FunnyBase, visual inspection and later a sequencer-specific quality measure equivalent to a Phred score of 15 were used as filters
resulting in 3,603 of the first 5,760 sequences (63%) and
13,922 of the next 15,168 sequences (92%) meeting quality standards, respectively. Re-sequences account for
5,668 sequences, and 4,625 of these were submitted.
Controls
One of the most important steps for producing microarrays from cDNA libraries is being able to associate the bacteria containing the cDNAs of interest with the EST
annotation. High-throughput procedures are highly
prone to tracking errors including: loading plates into an
automatic sequencer in the wrong order, orienting symmetric plates in the wrong direction, or mislabeling of
plates. The ability to identify these types of mistakes
requires controls for identifying plates and plate orientation. The FunnyBase system has a number of integrated
quality control steps. First, a Ctenophore cDNA (NCBI:

accession number: CN992733) that is unlike anything
else in GenBank is used as a control. Controls are placed
in 96-well plates in wells corresponding to the plate
number and two orientation wells (A5 and F9). Sequences
from 96-well plates are automatically scanned for these
controls so that the identity and orientation are confirmed
and a report is generated for manual review. Secondly, all
clones used for microarray production are re-sequenced.
This is necessary because individual cDNAs are cherry
picked, re-grown and re-amplified, and each of these steps
has the potential to introduce or magnify an error. For
example, for a 6,000 gene array, a 5% error rate would
result in 300 incorrect clones. Re-sequenced array plates
are compared using pair-wise BLAST [42] against previous
sequencing results so that the identity of printed microarray spots are verified.
EST clustering
EST projects generate a number of redundant sequences
due to the random selection of cDNAs from tissue libraries (Table 1). Clustering redundant sequences is a critical
first step of analysis in order to identify genes to target for
subtraction. The program CAP3 by Xiaong Huang [43]
was used to cluster EST sequences with a 30 bp overlap
and 75 percent similarity.

FunnyBase contains a total of 40,043 EST sequences from
F. heteroclitus heart and liver. Clustering with CAP3 yields
3,776 clusters that contain 30,688 ESTs (77%). The
remaining 8,991 ESTs (23%) are singletons. By storing the
results of clustering with annotation, FunnyBase easily
identifies these genes and aids in the selection of genes to
be used for library subtraction with the goal of picking less
common transcripts.
The 10 annotated clusters with the most sequences are
listed in Table 1. In microarray experiments these genes
tend to be highly expressed and the fluorescent signal

The frequency of the number of ESTs in each cluster is shown for Fundulus heteroclitus (Killifish: total number of clusters 3,779), Oryzias latipes (Medaka: total number of clusters 7,401), Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow Trout: total number of clusters 11,405) and Danio rerio (Zebrafish: total number of clusters 14,714). For example, the first
bar indicates that approximately 1,000 clusters contain 2 ESTs in all four teleost fish. Clusters for other species (not F.
heteroclitus) are based on NCBI UniGene.

tends to saturate the photomultiplier tube. These genes
also serve to verify microarray printing because the predicted spots for these genes have the strongest signal.
The distribution of the number of clusters with two or
more ESTs is depicted in Figure 2. Although most clusters
(2,581 or 68%) in FunnyBase have two or three-to-four
sequences (Fig. 2), a small number of highly expressed
genes form clusters with a large number of ESTs. For
example, there are three clusters that contain 512 to 1,024
ESTs and ten clusters that contain 256 to 512 ESTs (bottom two bars for killifish in Fig. 2). This distribution is
similar to other teleost fish EST collections (Fig 2). Notice,
as more ESTs are added, clusters tend to get larger (more
ESTs per cluster) rather than new small clusters growing in
frequency. Of the 3,779 killifish clusters, 14% have more
than eight ESTs, yet of the 14,714 Medaka clusters, 48%
have eight or more ESTs. These distributions suggest that
adding more EST sequences has diminishing returns.
One of the objectives of EST projects is to isolate most, if
not all, genes expressed in a tissue or organism. The
increasing size of larger clusters with more sequencing
efforts indicates that strategies to increase the probability
of isolating new genes need to be employed. We used two
strategies. First, we normalized the library to reduce the
differences among expressed genes to less than 10-fold
among rare and abundant mRNAs [44,45]. Using this
technique we were able to reduce redundancy in annotated genes from 33% in the non-normalized library to
11% after normalization. Second, we targeted specific

sequences for subtraction: annotated cDNAs with high
frequencies were targeted in order to focus effort on picking new, rare sequences. Through subtraction we were
able to increase the rate of discovery of new annotatable
sequences from 24% to 36%. However, analysis of these
results indicate that a set of highly expressed sequences,
some of which were not subtracted because they were not
in the set of annotated genes, still make up much of the
EST library and should be the focus of future subtractions.
Gene annotation
Of the 12,776 unique ESTs (3,776 clusters and 8,991 singletons), 3,877 (30%) were annotated. The distribution of
e-values for these annotations is shown in Figure 3. Most
(84%) of these ESTs have e-values less than 10-5. Among
the clusters, 2,265 of 3, 779 (60%) were annotated as
compared to 333 of 1,131 (30%) of confirmed high quality singletons. The lower percent of annotated singletons
suggests that these are either rare fish-specific genes, or
represent otherwise divergent, likely non-coding (5' or 3'
UTR), regions.

Annotations for ESTs are based on similarity using
BLASTX or BLASTN [42] to sequences in one of six-public
databases: Swiss-Prot, Human UniGene, Danio rerio UniGene, Oncorhynchus mykiss Unigene, Oryzias latipes Unigene, or GenBank NR. FunnyBase includes locally parsed
copies of these databases in a relational format. Thus, all
searches are done locally and annotation features beyond
the FASTA description can be queried. Consensus

probability of random sequence similarity, are shown as the negative log value (e.g., 10-5 = 5).

quality single unique sequences (singletons) are used as
query sequences for BLAST searches against these public
databases. The use of consensus sequences, when available, allows sequences that do not contain regions of significant similarity with known protein (e.g., 5' or 3'
noncoding regions) to be annotated if they are members
of an annotated cluster. All hits with e-value less than
0.001 and their associated alignments are stored in the
database and tracked with any associated functional
annotation. Users can specify a custom level of significance when assessing the validity of homology based
annotation. This record, which goes beyond storing a certain number of 'best hits', is critical because in many cases
additional results may have a negligibly lower alignment
score, but provide much more useful functional data.
The use of multiple databases increases the total number
of annotated ESTs (Fig. 4) as compared with any one
source and provides opportunity to compare annotation
between all three sources for 1,841 (47%) sequences.
GenBank NR provided the most number of annotations,
but these tend to be less informative (see systematic functional annotations below). Human Unigene provided an
additional 311 (8% of total) annotations. SwissProt provided an additional 32 annotations (1% of total) with 743
fewer annotated sequences than the NR. However, SwissProt is uniformly well annotated as compared to NR
where informative functional annotation can easily be
buried by numerous uninformative hits at similar e-values. Besides increasing the number of annotations, comparing the annotations from multiple databases ensures
that mistakes in the curation can be detected and information such as alternative gene names can be compiled from
multiple sources.

In conjunction with performing similarity searches by

of public databases such as SWISS-PROT in a relational
database format. These databases provide additional
information that cross-references other public resources
such as GO, KEGG or OMIM [46] that are not available in

common KEGG pathways. The KEGG pathway name and
number of distinct sequences (clusters or singletons) from
FunnyBase are presented. There are more distinct sequences
than enzymes in a pathway because many enzymes have several

encoding the same subunit (e.g., NADH dehydrogenase, a

the single FASTA description line returned by BLAST
search.
KEGG [39] is a unique tool that represents metabolic and
signal-transduction pathways both visually and computationally. FunnyBase links annotated genes to enzymes in
KEGG pathways based on enzyme commission (EC)
numbers. These pathway associations are stored and queries can readily identify genes from a given pathway that
show specific patterns of expression. For visual inspection
of the pathway, the web interface http://genom
ics.rsmas.miami.edu/funnybase/super_craw4/
links
directly to the graphical KEGG pathways in which a gene
occurs.
Of the 3,877 annotated ESTs in FunnyBase, 588 (14%)
participate in one or more pathways defined by KEGG.
These 588 ESTs represent 105 different pathways. Table 2
provides a breakdown of the number of ESTs in FunnyBase
for the 10 pathways associated with the largest number of
distinct sequences (contigs or singletons). The extent that
a given pathway is represented in FunnyBase can be used
to identify metabolic differences among tissues [47] or in
different species.
The Gene Ontology project (GO) has produced a structured vocabulary in the form of an acyclic directed graph
that biologists can use to annotate genes in a systematic
manner [38]. FunnyBase includes two non-trivial steps to
make the best possible use of GO terms. First, many GO
annotations are lost if only the single 'best hit' from a
homology search is considered because GO annotation is
applied most often to a few model species such as human

that may not appear as the single 'best hit' in a list of
BLAST results. FunnyBase identifies the gene name associated with the 'best hit' BLAST result and then uses all GO
annotation associated with hits from the complete BLAST
results that have the same gene name as the 'best hit' and
an e-value of e < 10-12. The goal of this approach is to identify annotation associated with a single 'best hit' gene
based on results that may come from multiple species
(orthologous genes) and therefore may have varying
degrees of sequence similarity due to phylogenetic distance, but to avoid the problem of selecting an inconsistent set of GO terms arising from gene families that share
regions of sequence similarity but may have different
functions.
Secondly, GO annotation in public databases tends to
annotate sequences with only the most specific GO term
available, for example RNA polymerase II transcription factor
activity, enhancer binding (GO:0003705) rather than the
more general parent term transcription regulator activity
(GO:0030528). However, in functional genomic analysis,
significant patterns of expression may exist at the more
general level of functional description. FunnyBase takes
advantage of the connected parent-child relationship of
GO terms provided by using the relational database version of GO available for download at http://www.geneon
tology.org to identify such relationships. These data are
used to extract the tree of more general GO terms related
to those provided by public databases. A FunnyBase script
then re-annotates genes with this more complete set of
GO terms.
Of the 3,877 annotated genes, 1,912 (54%) are assigned
one or more GO terms with a total 6,728 GO assignments
being made directly based on information in public databases such as SwissProt. Using parent-child GO term relationship backtracking, an additional 34,112 GO term
assignments were made, resulting in a final count of GO
assignments of 36,024 excluding the most general terms
that divide GO into three categories. Thus, on average, 19
GO terms are assigned to each of 1,912 annotated genes.
Gene scaffolding: clustering of clusters
Humans have approximately 30,000 expressed genes, yet
there are over 1,000,000 human UniGenes (NCBI).
Clearly, these clusters of cDNAs greatly overestimate the
number of unique genes. Similarly, FunnyBase has multiple clusters for the same gene: 15 apolipoprotein I, 10
cytochrome oxidase I, and 53 vitellogenin clusters. To
provide a more precise estimate of the number of unique
genes, consensus sequences were queried against the
27,695 sequences from the Human RefSeq [48] database,
then grouped by identical gene symbol. Of the 2,376 Fundulus clusters that were similar to a sequence in Human
RefSeq (e-value < 10-10), 1,818 (76%) had distinct gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/96

annotations. This method of clustering clusters by similarity to well-annotated reference sequences provides a
method to more accurately define the number of unique
genes represented by an EST set.
Case study: using functional annotation for microarray
analysis
As a case study in how functional annotation in FunnyBase
can be integrated with microarray data in a rigorous manner, we used a data set based on a microarray of metabolic
genes printed from ESTs annotated in FunnyBase [47]. Statistical analysis of this set of 363 metabolic genes identified a set of 62 genes that showed statistically significant
regression between gene expression levels and temperature along the Atlantic coast. That is, among individuals
collected from different locations along the thermocline
and then acclimated to common physiological conditions
for at least nine months before analysis, 17% of the metabolic genes had a linear relationship between the
amount of mRNA and the environmental temperature
these animals evolved in. Our hypothesis was that this set
of 59 genes represents a functionally different set than
those genes that do not show regression with temperature.
To test this hypothesis we examined the frequency of

genes annotated with a given GO term in the statistically
significant gene set versus the non-significant genes. Figure 5 shows the relevant proportions in each set for GO
terms that are represented by 5 or more ESTs in the significant set. For example, the GO term Amine Metabolism
(GO:0009308) is assigned to 14% of the 62 statistically
significant genes but only 3% of the non-significant genes
(those that do not show significant regression with temperature). A Fisher-exact test indicates these frequencies
(14% vs. 3%) represent different underlying distributions
(p < 0.001). Specifically, genes involved in amine metabolism are overrepresented in the set of genes that show
regression with temperature as compared with the
remaining sequences. This significant increase is found for
two other non-mutually exclusive GO terms: amino acid
and derivative metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (p <
0.05). Other GO terms show a reverse trend although
none were statistically significant. For example, ion transport (p = 0.08) and cell growth (p = 0.16) had few genes
with a clinal variation in expression. These data suggest
that the functions of genes influence whether they are
affected by ecologically interesting patterns of expression
(Fig 5).

Distribution of significant and non-significant genes relative to GO terms. The relationship between gene expression from
"common gardened" fish and the environment they evolved in was statistically analyzed and grouped by GO terms. Black bars
represent genes whose levels of expression has a significant regression with the environmental thermal cline among populations (p < 0.05). Hatched bars represent the set of genes with no significant relationship to the thermal environment.

Web interface
The web interface http://genomics.rsmas.miami.edu/fun
nybase/super_craw4/ provides public access to the FunnyBase system and dataset. Searches can query by keyword in
annotation, gene name, GO term, metabolic pathway,
clone or plate id, and BLAST homology search. All data
including raw sequences, cluster memberships, cluster
alignments, and alignments with homologous sequences
are provided for the user to examine the source of annotations. Links associated with each annotation are made to
external resources such as GO's AMIGO browser, KEGG
pathways, SwissProt, and NCBI records.
Other Fundulus sequences
FunnyBase was constructed to annotate sequences for the
analysis of gene expression. It provides identification and
annotation for genes in the Crawford laboratory with a
primary goal of identifying clones useful for the construction of microarrays. As such, other Fundulus sequences in
Genbank are not included. However, FunnyBase forms the
basis of the TIGR Killifish gene index http://www.tigr.org/
tigr-scripts/tgi/T_index.cgi?species=killifish that includes
publicly available F. heteroclitus sequences.

Conclusions
Customized species specific EST databases are available
for many species [17,18,21,49-56]. FunnyBase provides an
integrated method to annotate ESTs with the most biologically relevant set of associations and provides several
innovations for the production of ESTs for microarrays.
Control sequences are identified in each 96-well plate so
that mislabelled or inverted plates are automatically
detected. Annotations are based upon several different
public databases. The multiple annotations provide
greater assurance about gene description and greater frequency of annotation than any one database. The most
functionally informative innovation of FunnyBase is the
process of culling through numerous primary similarity
search results in order to identify links to systematic
functional databases in GO and KEGG. These provide a
discrete set of terms that can be analyzed statistically and
that are organized into networks that represent biological
knowledge of higher-level functional and pathway associations. The range of databases queried by similarity search
and the tracking of homology beyond a single 'best' hit
maximizes the opportunity to obtain this annotation. A
richer set of GO terms is achieved by using all hits with evalues less than 10-11 that represent the same gene as the
'best hit'. Additional GO terms that represent more general functions than those found in public annotation are
derived through the parent-child relationship of the Gene
Ontology. EC numbers provide links, via KEGG, to metabolic pathways and these stored terms can be used to
investigate the relationship between gene expression in
specific metabolic pathways including cardiac metabo-

lism [57]. To provide a more accurate accounting of the
number of unique genes, consensus sequence from clusters of ESTs were queried against the Human RefSeq database and those sequences sharing the same gene symbol
are grouped based on this scaffolding information. These
approaches use publicly available bioinformatics tools
(BLAST, CAP3, Phred, Cross-Match, Perl, and the MySQL
database management system). The application of theses
tools in an appropriate framework as outlined in FunnyBase can be used to create a systems level functional
genomics annotation system useful for EST databases to
study biological processes among a rich diversity of
organisms.

Methods
Organism
The animal protocols used in the present study have been
approved by the University of Miami Institute Animal
Care and Use Committee. The teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus used for ESTs were collected from two sites: Scorton
Creek in Sandwich, MA, and Stone Harbor, NJ. These
populations are in the central portion of the thermal cline
and have relatively high levels of heterozygosity [32].
These fish were subjected to the following environmental
regime before tissues were harvested for mRNA extraction:
kept in controlled temperature and aeration conditions,
and acclimated to common conditions (20°C, 15 ppt
salinity) in re-circulating aquaria for at least nine months
before experiments. Following this common acclimation
a subset of fish were subjected to one of several stresses:
4°C, 34°C, hypoxia, or a complex mix of hydrocarbons.
cDNA library
To effectively isolate and sequence thousands of cDNAs
for the production of microarrays, a unidirectional cDNA
library with few non-recombinants was required. We created four cDNA libraries: heart libraries from non-stressed
and stressed fish and liver libraries from non-stressed and
stressed fish. The non-stressed F. heteroclitus cardiac and
liver libraries were provided by Drs. S. Karchner and M.
Hahn, WHOI [58] and were constructed using the UniZap
λ cDNA Gigpack Gold cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA, USA). The cardiac library was produced from 27 fish
hearts (both sexes) sampled from Scorton Creek in
Sandwich, MA. The cDNAs in these libraries are oriented
such that the 5'end of each cDNA is ligated to EcoR1 and
3' poly A is ligated to XhoI. These libraries had less than
1% non-recombinants, i.e. 2 of 300 random clones from
a non-normalized library had no inserts. The stressed
libraries included 4 fish subjected to the four stressors
(above) and 4 non-stressed individuals. Unidirectional
heart and liver libraries were constructed such that the
5'end of each cDNA is ligated to EcoR1 and 3' poly A is
ligated to XhoI of the plasmid vector pSmart (Lucigen,
Middleton, WI, USA). The pSmart-cDNA vector was

designed for EST work. The vector expresses kanamycinresistance and has a terminator on both sides of the cDNA
insertion site preventing expression of cDNA. These two
attributes (non-expression and Kan-resistance) increase
the stability of different genes in the library versus cDNA
libraries in Amp libraries with Lac promoters (Crawford,
unpublished). These libraries had less than 1% nonrecombinants.

onds; then 32 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds followed by
70°C for 5 minutes; then 72°C for 15 minutes). PCR
products were purified manually in 96 well format using
Sephadex G-50 in a deep well plate with a 0.2 microfilter
(Millipore, Billerica, USA) or robotically using AmPure
(Agencourt, Beverly, MA, USA) and EvolP3 96 pipetting
liquid handling system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.,
Boston, MA, USA).

Normalization of cDNA libraries reduces the differences
among expressed genes to less than 10-fold among rare
and abundant mRNAs [44,45]. Normalized libraries were
produced by isolating cDNAs from approximately 1012
plasmids. The cDNAs were isolated using PCR amplification with vector specific primers immediately 5' and 3' to
the insertion site (EcoRI and XhoI sites). These PCR products (PCR-cDNAs) were denatured and hybridized to single stranded plasmids from the cardiac cDNA library.
Taking advantage of Cot values, the most abundant
cDNAs were annealed to the more abundant PCR products and were removed selectively by hydroxyapatite-column chromatography. The single-stranded plasmids in
the flow-through were converted to double strands using
the Sequenase DNA polymerase (Amersham, Piscataway,
NJ, USA). DH10s E. coli (BRL) were transformed with
these double-stranded plasmids by electroporation. The
number of recovered plasmids and the resulting complexity of the normalized library depended on the duration of
hybridization or Cot values. Two normalized libraries
were made using either a 12 or 24 hour hybridization. The
library from the 12-hour hybridization yielded 250,000
plasmids. The library from the 24 hour hybridization
yielded 3,000 plasmids and had a greater representation
of rare mRNAs and greater frequency of non-recombinants.

PCR products were sequenced from the 5' end (relative to
the mRNA) on an ABI 373 or ABI 3730 sequencer using
ABI "Big Dye" reaction mix. We typically used 1/16 the
amount of reaction mix, yielding 300 to 400 unambiguous bases. Sequences were purified using biotin primers
and streptavidin coated magnetic beads (for the ABI 373)
or Agencort CleanSeq (for the ABI 3730).

Isolation and sequencing of cDNAs
Characterization of cDNAs (growth of individual bacterial
colonies containing plasmids, PCRs, purification of PCR
products, sequencing reactions) used 96 well plates and
octopipettes. To characterize cDNAs, 96 individual bacterial colonies from the normalized library were randomly
chosen, and each was grown in 1.25 ml of Superbroth in
2 ml-96 well plates. After 18 hours of growth, two 250 ul
bacterial glycerol stocks were made and stored in 96 well
plates at -80°C. One microliter of these bacterial growths
was used for PCR reactions using forward and reverse plasmid specific primers: (PucF = CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACG, PucR = GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAA).
PCR reactions had 0.2 mM dNTPs, 10 pmoles of each
primer, 1 unit of Promega Taq (0.2 ul), and reaction
buffer with detergents and DMSO (final concentrations:
50 mM Tris HCl, pH 9.2 (25°C), 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2.25
mM MgCl2, 2% (v/v) DMSO, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Twostep thermal cycle conditions were used (94°C for 10 sec-

Validation
We used three procedures to verify that the correct
sequence was associated with each cDNA. 1) Each 96-well
plate had three wells with a "marker cDNA" (Ctenophore
cDNA #5, a random cDNA with no similarity to any
sequence in GenBank). Two wells (#40 and #67) always
contained the marker cDNA, and thus any misloading or
mislabeling of sequencing lanes was identifiable. The
third marker cDNA was placed in a well that corresponds
to the plate number (e.g., plate 2 had the marker in well
2). 2) After the production of 12 plates, one row (8 wells)
from each plate was re-sequenced. Thus, 8/96 or ~8% of
all sequences and their locations were confirmed. 3)
cDNAs used for microarrays were re-sequenced. These
measures are important to ensure that the correct and
known cDNAs are printed.
Subtraction
The complexity of the normalized library was reduced by
subtracting the characterized cDNAs previously isolated
from the normalized library. Subtraction greatly reduced
the probability of isolating the same cDNA and thus
improved the efficiency of screening the library for unique
clones. Subtraction used a 100-fold molar excess of
biotin-labeled antisense cDNAs produced by PCR using
all the characterized cDNAs as substrates and vector-specific primers in which the 3' primer was labeled with
biotin. These PCR products were hybridized to the cDNA
libraries in the presence of oligo-dA and vector-specific
oligos (that prevented non-specific hybridization to oligodT or vector sequences). After a 24 hour hybridization,
genes in the library that bound to these biotin-labeled
PCR products were removed with the use of magnetized,
streptavidin coated beads. DH10s E. coli were transformed
with the subtracted library by electroporation.

Microarrays
Microarrays were printed using a select 384 cDNAs from
F. heteroclitus cardiac library encoding essential proteins
for cellular metabolism isolated from over 40,000
expressed sequences http://genomics.rsmas.miami.edu/
FunnyBase/super_craw4/. These 384 cDNAs were amplified with amine-linked primers and printed on 3-D Link
Activated slides (Surmodics Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA)
using GeneMachine OminGrider, and blocked following
slide manufacturer protocols. The suite of 384 amplified
cDNAs was printed as a group in four spatially separated
replicates. Four hybridization zones of these four replicate
arrays were printed per slide, with each zone set separated
by a hydrophobic barrier. Samples were hybridized twice;
once with Cy3 and once with Cy5 resulting in overall technical replication of 8-fold per sample.
Sample preparation and hybridization
RNA was extracted from tissue homogenate in a chaotropic buffer using phenol/cholorform/isoamyl alcohol
and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bio-
