Abstract
Background: Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes exhibit an endophilic, nocturnal blood feeding
behavior. Despite the importance of light as a regulator of malaria transmission, our knowledge on
the molecular interactions between environmental cues, the circadian oscillators and the host
seeking and feeding systems of the Anopheles mosquitoes is limited.
Results: In the present study, we show that the blood feeding behavior of mosquitoes is under
circadian control and can be modulated by light pulses, both in a clock dependent and in an
independent manner. Short light pulses (~2–5 min) in the dark phase can inhibit the blood-feeding
propensity of mosquitoes momentarily in a clock independent manner, while longer durations of
light stimulation (~1–2 h) can induce a phase advance in blood-feeding propensity in a clock
dependent manner. The temporary feeding inhibition after short light pulses may reflect a masking
effect of light, an unknown mechanism which is known to superimpose on the true circadian
regulation. Nonetheless, the shorter light pulses resulted in the differential regulation of a variety
of genes including those implicated in the circadian control, suggesting that light induced masking
effects also involve clock components. Light pulses (both short and long) also regulated genes
implicated in feeding as well as different physiological processes like metabolism, transport,
immunity and protease digestions. RNAi-mediated gene silencing assays of the light pulse regulated
circadian factors timeless, cryptochrome and three takeout homologues significantly up-regulated the
mosquito's blood-feeding propensity. In contrast, gene silencing of light pulse regulated olfactory
factors down-regulated the mosquito's propensity to feed on blood.
Conclusion: Our study show that the mosquito's feeding behavior is under circadian control.
Long and short light pulses can induce inhibition of blood-feeding through circadian and unknown
mechanisms, respectively, that involve the chemosensory system.

Background
The circadian clocks, or oscillators, that influence a variety
of activities of an organism are regulated by a range of
external environmental factors, such as light, temperature,
humidity, food and social interactions [1-5]. Genetic and

molecular analyses in a range of evolutionary distant
organisms, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,
have revealed a striking degree of conservation of these
oscillators and their underlying molecular mechanisms,
many of which involve transcriptional feedback loops

[6,7]. Timeless (tim) is one of the crucial factors that connects the endogenous clock with the external environment such as light [7]. When light pulses are applied early
in the subjective night (soon after the lights have gone off)
a phase delay is produced. Conversely, when light pulses
are applied just before lights would have come on, a phase
advance is produced [8]. Food is another potent clockentraining cue, and the D. melanogaster takeout (to) gene
has been shown to act as a molecular link between the circadian rhythm and feeding behavior [9,10].
Despite the essential role of circadian clocks in the regulation of vector behaviors that enable disease transmission,
little is known about the molecular control of the hostseeking and feeding behavior of mosquitoes. It has been
shown that the A. gambiae flight activity peaks during the
night time and during the twilight [11]. Light has also
been shown to inhibit A. gambiae flight activity and to reset the rhythm by delaying it; however if the light phase
begins early, it has a phase-advancing effect [12,13]. The
host-seeking and feeding behaviors of many hematophagous insects exhibit rhythmic biting activity [14]; reaching
peak levels in mid-night and are largely controlled by several circadian and chemosensory systems [15,16] involving a variety of odorant binding proteins (obp) and
odorant receptors (or) that are linked to downstream signaling cascades [17,18]. In D. melanogaster antennae, the
chemosensory components have been shown to be regulated by peripheral circadian oscillators [19].
Here we have initiated a detailed dissection of the delicate
interactions that occur between the mosquito's light-sensing system, the circadian oscillators and the host seeking
and feeding systems. Several studies have reported the
influence of light on the flight activity of mosquitoes [1113,20,21], while there is no comprehensive information
available on the regulation of the mosquito's blood-feeding behavior by light, at least at the molecular level. We
show that light pulses can induce changes in A. gambiae
blood-feeding behavior and in the mosquito's global transcriptome, including transcripts that are regulated by
blood feeding. We have functionally characterized
selected genes that respond to the light stimulus by RNAi
mediated gene silencing and have shown that they can
moderately influence the mosquitoes' blood feeding
behavior. We show that this modulation of the mosquitoes' blood feeding behavior is dependent on light pulse
duration and occurs both through clock entrainment
mechanisms and by clock independent masking effects
[22-24] that may occur in a phase dependent or independent manner [25]. The light pulse stimulated alteration of mosquito feeding propensity implicates circadian
factors that appear to down-regulate components of the
chemosensory system.

Results and discussion
The blood feeding behavior of A. gambiae is under
circadian control
To test whether A. gambiae blood feeding behavior is
under circadian control we performed a time-course analysis of blood feeding propensity during a normal LD
12:12 light/dark cycle (12 h light, 12 h dark) and during a
DD (dark-dark; continuous 48 hours) cycle to see whether
the blood feeding propensity pattern would persist in
absence of light (Figure 1A). We were interested in assessing the blood-feeding behavior of mosquitoes when kept
in DD for 48 consecutive hours. In LD conditions, blood
feeding propensity peaked during late night, at around 5–
6 h after the light-off transition, and was low during the
daytime. The persistence of this pattern even after a 48 h
DD condition suggests that blood feeding propensity of
mosquitoes is under circadian control. We also performed
an experiment where mosquitoes were maintained in a
DD condition for 6 days prior to feeding at a day and
night time, to assess whether a free-run condition could
be reached. These mosquitoes showed feeding behavior
that did not correlate with the zeitgeber time-points (as in
Figure 1A) and displayed a similar feeding propensity at
both ZT19.30 and 28.30 hours, suggesting a free-run condition (data not shown); this finding further validates the
circadian nature of blood-feeding behavior [26,27].
Light pulse-induced alteration of A. gambiae bloodfeeding behavior
A series of assays were performed to address the effect of
long and short light pulses on the mosquito's blood feeding propensity. We investigated the effects of short (5
min) and long (2 h) light pulses, applied during the dark
phase at 19.30 hours, on the blood-feeding pattern of
mosquitoes in both LD and DD conditions (Figure 1B and
1C). A short light pulse of 5 min resulted in a transient
inhibition (~30–50%) of blood feeding propensity in
mosquitoes, in both LD and DD conditions (Figure 1B
versus 1A). This observation suggests that the shorter light
pulse did not evoke a behavioral phase shift, and the inhibition of feeding propensity is likely to reflect a masking
effect [22]. On the contrary, a longer 2 h light pulse
resulted in an immediate inhibition (~50%) of the blood
feeding propensity along with a phase-advance (by ~3–4
h) in mosquitoes that were maintained at both the LD and
DD conditions (for 48 h), compared to the non-light
pulse stimulated mosquitoes (Figure 1C versus 1A). Earlier studies have shown that an early initiation of the light
phase results in a phase-advancing effect on mosquito
flight activity [12].

We then performed a series of assays to better understand
the mechanism mediating the inhibition of blood feeding
propensity by shorter light pulses. Light pulses of equal
duration (2 min) were applied at different durations (120,

The blood feeding behavior of A. gambiae is under circadian control. A. A time course study of blood feeding propensity of mosquitoes maintained at normal conditions (LD 12:12) and at DD for 48 h. Blood was provided every 3 h, for 10 minutes and the percentage of mosquitoes that fed was plotted over time. The LD conditions of light on (ZT0) and light off (ZT12)
are indicated with the white and black boxes, respectively at the bottom of the graph. The DD mosquito groups were maintained in darkness throughout the study. B. The blood feeding pattern for 24 h after mosquito was exposed to light pulses for

90, 60 and 30 min) prior to blood provision and light
onset (at ZT 0) (Figure 2A). In separate assays, light pulses
of different duration (5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 secs) were
applied at a constant duration (-30 min) prior to blood
provision and light onset (at ZT 0) (Figure 2B). The first
set of assays (Figure 2A) showed a negative correlation
between the duration prior to feeding and the behavioral
change as a measure of feeding propensity; the shorter the
time between the light pulses and blood provision, the
larger the decrease in feeding propensity. Mosquitoes
maintained in constant light for 2 h prior to blood provision displayed the same degree of blood feeding inhibition to those exposed to a 2 min light pulse at 30 min
prior to blood provision (less by ~55–60% compared to
the continuous dark control) (Figure 2A). Interestingly,
even a 2 min light pulse at 120 min prior to the light phase
significantly decreased the mosquitoes' feeding propensity when compared to those not exposed to light. The second set of assays (Figure 2B) to examine the influence of
the light pulse duration on feeding behavior showed that
the light pulse duration was positively correlated with the
induced behavioral change: the longer the light pulses, the
larger the decrease in feeding propensity. A more detailed
figure (non-fed, partially fed and fully fed mosquitoes) is
presented in Additional file 1 and their corresponding values, standard error and the p-values (T-test) are shown in
Additional file 2 . The light dosage and phase dependent
fashion of blood feeding propensity modulation further
supports the implication of a phase dependent masking
effect rather than a phase advance when mosquitoes are
subjected to the two minute short light pulses [22,23].
For these blood feeding studies we chose an experimental
design involving an artificial membrane feeding system
(Parafilm M) with commercial human blood because of
the difficulty in standardization and replication of parameters associated with the use of a mouse or a human arm,
as it will be subjective to different individuals. Similar artificial membrane-feeding assays were also performed with
close proximity (1–3 cm) to human hands and continuous human exhalations. These results showed an apparent
insensitivity of the mosquitoes to the applied light pulse;
the mosquitoes' feeding propensity was largely unaffected
by light pulse after this chemosensory over-stimulation
(data not shown). However this does not mean that the
mosquitoes' feeding behavior upon direct stimulation
with a human is not regulated by circadian oscillators that
can be manipulated through environmental cues. The
exposure of mosquitoes to a human arm or hand and
exhalations at a 1- to 3 cm distance is an extreme condition providing maximal concentrations of chemosensory
and heat stimulants, while in nature mosquitoes have to
sense the human host at a distance of few hundreds to a
couple of yards, at conditions that are very likely to be bet-

ter simulated by a membrane feeding system that only
allows for limited chemosensory stimulation [28].
It has been shown that the taste receptors in mosquitoes
can be induced by phagostimulants such as adenine
nucleotides [29]; thus the blood feeding behavior in mosquitoes is a complex process that is regulated by a variety
of factors. Host seeking, and hence the blood-feeding propensity of mosquitoes, has also been shown to be stimulated by various cues emitted by the host, such as CO2,
lactic acid, 1 octen-3-ol, heat and color [30]. In order to
better understand the basis of the mosquitoes' attraction
to the blood in the membrane feeding system, which may
be regulated by the blood-specific odor, temperature and
color, we designed a series of experiments that suggested
that the mosquitoes were mainly attracted to a blood-specific chemosensory stimulant through the membrane
feeding system (Additional file 3), and thereby supports
the validity of our experimental design.
Relationships between the light pulse and blood feeding –
induced transcriptomes
To identify candidate components of the molecular circuits that mediate the interactions between the light stimulus and the mosquito's host seeking and feeding
machinery, we used a microarray-based genome expression approach to assay differences in the mRNA abundance of genes under different light-stimulation (2 min
and 2 h) and feeding conditions in whole mosquitoes and
the head of both male and female mosquitoes (array-plan
design in Additional file 4). An earlier observation that the
A. gambiae host-seeking is inhibited for at least 24–36 h
after a blood meal [31] was confirmed in our experimental system (data not shown) and was used as a basis for the
selection of a 6-h post-blood-feeding time point for global
gene expression analysis of blood feeding-induced gene
regulation. A complete list of genes showing regulation
after a light pulse and blood feeding are listed in Additional file 5.

A light pulse stimulation for 2 min at 30 min prior to RNA
harvest (arrays "b" and "c"; see Additional file 4), resulted
in the regulation of 345 genes in the total mosquito (274
up-regulated and 71 down-regulated) and 374 genes in
the head (124 up-regulated and 250 down-regulated) of
females (Additional file 4). Mosquitoes exposed to continuous light for 2 h (array "a"; Additional file 5) showed
regulation of 188 genes (146 up-regulated and 42 downregulated) in whole female mosquitoes. The regulated
genes represented a variety of functional classes, of which
the most abundant were metabolism, immunity, oxidoreductive processes, and transporters (Figure 3A and Additional file 4). Of particular interest were the genes with
predicted functions related to the mosquito's circadian
clock, chemosensory and blood-digestive systems (Table

Light pulse-induced alteration of A. gambiae blood-feeding behavior. A. Mosquitoes were exposed to light pulses for
2 min at 120, 90, 60, and 30 min prior to the switch to the light phase and blood provision (ZT 0). Mosquitoes were allowed to
feed for 10 min and the percentage of fed mosquitoes in each category was scored and plotted. Among the controls were one
set that was not exposed to light (continuous dark) and another set that was exposed to continuous light for these 120 min
prior to blood provision. B. Mosquitoes were exposed to light pulses for 5, 15, 30, 60 or 120 sec at 30 min prior to light onset
and blood provision (ZT O) for 10 min, after which the percentage of fed mosquitoes were scored and plotted. Error bars
indicate the standard error. Significant data points with respect to continuous darkness control set are marked with an asterisk.

Light pulse and blood feeding induced transcriptome
Light pulse and blood feeding induced transcriptome. A. Venn diagrams showing the number of genes regulated by light
pulse (left, grey circle), blood feeding (right, black circles) and both stimuli (light grey shaded area in centre) in each of the different functional classifications: CIRCADIAN; CHEMOSENSORY; PROTEOLYTIC DIGESTION; IMMUNITY; METABOLISM;
CYTOSKELETAL AND STRUCTURAL; REDOX/STRESS; REPLICATION/TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION; TRANSPORT; DIVERSE and UNKNOWN. The number of genes regulated in each sub-section is mentioned. The relative mRNA
expression pattern of seven circadian/chemosensory genes at three different time-points of LD (12:12) conditions: in A. gambiae female head (B) and in the remaining body (C). The mRNA level at Day1CT2 was taken as 1 and the relative mRNA level
at other time-points were calculated accordingly with respect to Day1CT2. [Day1CT2 = 2 h after light on stage on day 1;
Day1CT14 = 2 h after light off stage on day 1; Day2CT2 = 2 h after light on stage on day 2].

1). The robustness of the microarray data was validated by
qRT-PCR (Additional file 6).
Circadian clock-related genes
Light pulse regulated six circadian genes in the head or
total mosquito: a casein kinase and the tim genes were upregulated in the total mosquito, while the transcript abundance of two putative to homologs and two circadian controlled precursor genes were down regulated in the head
(Table 1 and Additional file 5). Casein kinase and tim
have previously been shown to be involved in regulating
the circadian rhythm in response to light pulse stimulation in various organisms [7]. The mRNA abundance of
the four major circadian genes: period (per), clock (clk),
cycle (cyc) and cryptochrome 1 (cry1) was below threshold
detection levels for microarray analyses (data not shown)
at the assayed conditions (light on/off time-zone).

The to gene is involved in regulating the feeding behavior
of D. melanogaster and has been shown to be up-regulated

upon starvation [9]. A similar study in A. gambiae with
sugar feeding has shown up-regulation upon sugar starvation (see later section). The down-regulation of two putative to transcripts (AGAP004263 and AGAP012703) by
light pulse stimulation, which may account for the
decreased feeding propensity (Figure 2), is intriguing
when related to the RNAi gene silencing of to genes that
results in an increased feeding propensity (see later section). This is likely to reflect other functions of these
genes, as has been found in D. melanogaster [32]. A
detailed phylogenetic study of the A. gambiae to genes with
other homologues is discussed below. Two to transcripts
(AGAP012703 and AGAP004262) were up-regulated in
the carcass compartment after blood-feeding.
Chemosensory genes
As many as twelve genes with putative chemosensory
functions were exclusively regulated by light pulse stimulation; three were exclusively regulated by blood feeding,
and three by both stimuli (Figure 3A and Additional file 5

). Nine obps were down-regulated after light pulse stimulation in the female head; this pattern is likely to be
related to the lower blood-feeding propensity of the mosquitoes after light pulse stimulation (Figure 2). The obp49
gene showed significant up-regulation in female mosquito head after blood feeding; this increased activity may
indicate a specialized function for this gene, such as mate
seeking or oviposition site finding. Another interesting
feature was the significantly lower expression of several
obps (15, 17, 19, 26, 4, 47 and 7) in light pulse-stimulated
female versus male heads, while a direct comparison
between the gene expression in non-stimulated female
and male heads showed a higher expression of three obps
(19, 22 and 26) in the male heads. Female obps play
major role in host seeking and blood feeding, while the
male obps are involved in pheromone binding for mating
and nectar feeding and may not be regulated by lightentrainable host-seeking behavior in the same way as the
female genes. A specific obp can play multiple roles in
sensing different types of complex odors, since the odor
sensing is dependent on several obps that are part of a specific odor code [33].
A D7 related 3 protein which is distantly related to obps, was
up-regulated in the head by both light pulse stimulation
and blood feeding, and was down-regulated in the carcass
after blood feeding (Table 1, Additional file 5). Proteins
belonging to the D7 family has been shown to be
expressed in the salivary glands and were injected into the
host with saliva during blood feeding [34]. Among the
other genes that showed regulation after light pulse stimulation includes a putative gustatory receptor, which was
up-regulated in the female head when compared to the
male head; and two pheromone binding proteins, of
which one was up-regulated and the other was down-regulated in the female head (Additional file 5).
Blood digestive enzymes
As many as 23 genes involved in proteolytic digestion
were regulated by blood feeding and 15 genes by light
pulse stimulation, while 11 genes were regulated by both
the stimuli (Figure 3A). The majority of these genes (17
out of 23) were up-regulated upon blood feeding; a finding that is consistent with the fact that this functional class
plays a role in blood meal digestion. The carboxypeptidase
genes were shown to follow a cyclical blood-inducible
expression pattern with a peak every 3 h post blood meal
[35], and in our assay two carboxypeptidase genes
(ENSANGT00000016098 and AGAP011435) were upregulated in the carcass after blood feeding, however
AGAP011435 was down regulated in female head after a
light pulse. Two chymotrypsin genes (chymotrypsin 1 and
2) have been shown to be induced in the midgut epithelium after blood feeding [36], and in our assay one chymotrypsin gene (AGAP010731) was similarly induced with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/8/23

feeding in female body, though it was down-regulated in
female head after light pulse. In agreement with the
down-regulation of two serine proteases in female body
after blood feeding in our analysis, the gut-specific serine
protease (AgChyL) has been earlier shown to be downregulated during the peak hours of digestion (12 to 24 h)
after a blood meal [37], although one of the serine protease (AGAP011477) showed up-regulation with light
pulse in female head. An angiotensin converting enzyme
and two aminopeptidase genes were down-regulated after
blood feeding in the rest of the female body; however they
were not regulated with light pulse. This finding is particularly interesting in light of a study that showed that A.
gambiae aminopeptidase N (AgAPN1) was involved in
blocking the development of Plasmodium ookinetes in several mosquito species [38].
Other functional gene groups
In D. melanogaster, a variety of physiological processes
have been shown to be under circadian control and to be
associated with periodic oscillations in gene expression
patterns [39,40]. A. gambiae genes regulated by light pulse
and blood feeding which are involved in other functional
groups like immunity, oxidative stress and redox,
cytoskeletal and structural, metabolism and other housekeeping genes (Figure 3A and Additional file 5) are discussed below. A larger number of genes were regulated by
light pulse: immunity (50 genes), metabolism (55 genes),
cytoskeletal and structural (32 genes), redox/stress (53
genes), RTT (42 genes) and TRP (41) functional groups,
compared to those regulated by blood feeding (36 genes,
43 genes, 6 genes, 29 genes 10 and 41 genes respectively).
In the "diverse" functional category, there were 159 genes
that were regulated exclusively by light pulse stimulation,
63 exclusively by blood feeding and 20 by both stimuli.
Of the genes whose functions were unknown, 333 genes
were regulated exclusively by a light pulse, 179 exclusively
after blood feeding and 36 by both stimuli (Figure 3A). A
significant number of light pulse- and blood feeding-regulated genes were most likely not identified in these
assays because of limitations of the microarray methodology to detect mRNA of lower abundance. These major
changes in gene expression are indicative of the highly significant impact that a light pulse can have on mosquito
physiology, at least partly by modulating circadian oscillators.
Immunity-related genes
As many as 50 genes with putative roles in the mosquito's
innate immune system were found to be regulated by light
pulse stimulation and 36 genes with blood-feeding exclusively. Thirty genes were regulated by both stimuli (Figure
3A) which adds up to 116 immune genes being regulated
by the two stimuli (Additional file 4). These included
genes encoding pattern recognition receptors (fibrinogen

rel1 and rel2), antimicrobial peptides (cecropin, gambicin,
lysozyme, and defensin), and other functionally diverse proteins [41,42]. It was recently shown in Drosophila that disruption of the circadian rhythm is often correlated with
increased susceptibility to infection [43]. The circadian
regulation of the mosquito's innate immunity factors is
particularly intriguing, since many of these molecules can
modulate resistance to the malaria parasite Plasmodium
[41]. Interestingly, blood feeding alone up-regulated several immunity genes such as cecropin, fibrinogen immunolectins, leucine rich repeat protein, peroxidase precursor,
thioester containing proteins as well as TOLL precursors and
serpins. Bacterial proliferation occurs in the gut after a
blood meal and this is likely to result in immune gene
induction [35,44]. Several immune genes were also downregulated after blood-feeding and those includes among
others; c-type lectin 8, fibrinogen immunolectin 38, a scavenger receptor protein and spaetzle 4 [35,45].
Oxidative stress and redox genes
A variety of oxidoreductive and stress-related genes were
found to be regulated upon light pulse stimulation (Figure 3A). Genes in this group included those encoding cytochromes, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), oxidoreductases,
dehydrogenases and heat shock proteins. Most of the detoxification-related genes (18 genes); such as the cytochrome
P450, GST and DNAJ genes, were down-regulated after
light pulse stimulation in the female whole mosquito and
head. These genes have been linked to insecticide resistance [46]. Light pulse stimulation can change the redox
state by generating several ions/molecules, resulting in
up-regulation of several of these genes, including those for
oxidoreductases, mitochondrial carrier proteins, heat
shock proteins, and several dehydrogenases [39]. It has
been shown earlier that several detoxification enzymes are
up-regulated after blood feeding, as a result of the release
of reactive oxygen species during the digestion of heme
[45]; a similar pattern observed in our assay, with most
enzymes being up-regulated after blood feeding.
Cytoskeletal and structural genes
Thirty two genes encoding components of the cytoskeleton and those involved in structural maintenance, such as
those encoding actin, myosin, tubulin, kinesin, tropomyosin,
cuticle proteins and dynein, were mainly up-regulated (with
few exceptions) by light pulse stimulation in both head
and whole mosquitoes (Figure 3A). Six genes were regulated with blood-feeding exclusively and 4 genes were reg-

ulated by both stimuli (Figure 3A); hence 42 genes were
regulated by both stimuli (Additional file 4). Many of
these genes have previously been shown to be differentially expressed after blood feeding [45], and some play a
role in the Plasmodium parasite's traversal of the midgut
epithelial cells and the repair of the midgut epithelium
after this invasion [42]. Of particular interest are the peritrophin precursor gene, which is up-regulated in female
head after both light pulse stimulation and blood feeding,
and an annexin gene which was down-regulated in female
head after light pulse stimulation. An annexin protein has
been previously shown to be up-regulated by light pulse
stimulation and serotonin in the eye circadian system of
Aplysia species [47].
Metabolism and other housekeeping genes
As many as 55 genes encoding a variety of enzymes
involved in a range of different metabolic pathways were
differentially regulated upon light pulse stimulation; 33
were up-regulated and the remaining 22 were down-regulated in both whole female mosquitoes and in their heads
(Figure 3A). A variety of replication-, transcription-, and
translation-related genes (42 genes) were regulated by
light pulse stimulation and to a lesser extent after blood
feeding (10 genes), in both the head and whole mosquito
Additional file 5. A variety of metabolic processes are
tightly controlled by circadian oscillators, since these
processes need to exhibit different activity levels during
the day and night phases [39,48]. Genes related to transport processes (41 genes) were also regulated (mainly up
regulated in total mosquitoes) with light stimuli; this
finding is consistent with reports that light entrainment is
associated with adjustments in several photoreceptor
molecules, and several ions, solute factors, and bio-molecules may need to be transported to other cellular compartments [39].
Circadian expression of the clock and chemosensory genes
in A. gambiae
The regulation of several clock and chemosensory genes
by a short light pulse stimulation (Figure 3A) which, however, was not capable of inducing a phase advance was
intriguing (Figure 1B), and we pursued further characterization of selected genes (tim, per, cry 1, clk, putative to 1,
obp4 and obp22) with regard to their mRNA abundance
at successive time points over a LD 12:12 cycle to test for
their circadian regulation (Figure 3B and 3C). This analysis showed some interesting features that may suggest that
the circadian system of hematophagous insects share certain commonalities. All seven genes showed a higher
expression pattern in female head at the night-dark phase
(CT14), similarly to what has been observed in D. melanogaster [39]. The expression pattern of these genes
(except cry 1) showed a quite different expression pattern
in the rest of the body where their mRNA abundance dis-

played the lowest level during the night-dark phase
(CT14). A similar observation has been shown for the
blood sucking sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis, where several
clock regulated genes were regulated in an opposite manner in female head and body [49].
Determination of RNAi knockdown efficiency and
expression analysis of selected circadian and
chemosensory genes
To identify putative components of the molecular interactions between the mosquito's light sensing system, light
pulse-entrained circadian oscillators and its host-seeking
and feeding systems, we selected 10 genes for RNAi gene
silencing assays in adult female mosquitoes to assess their
potential influence on the mosquito's blood-feeding
behavior. Seven of these genes (tim, putative to1, to 2, to3,
obp4, obp22, and obp26) were selected on the basis of their
expression patterns (Additional file 5), and the remaining
three (per, clk1 and cry) were included as representative of
previously identified circadian clock factors. A series of
assays were first carried out to determine the silencing efficiencies tissue specific expression specificities of the targeted genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/8/23

were collected at 4 hr intervals over a 24-h period (at CT0,
4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24) and then pooled for analysis of tissue-specific expression. The tim and per transcripts and all
three putative to transcripts were detected at equal levels in
all body parts, while cry 1 and clk showed slightly lower
expression in the antennae than in the other body parts
(Figure 4B). The three obps obp4, obp22, and obp26 were
expressed only in the head and antennae and not in the
rest of the body, consistent with previous reports
[50,51,53].

RNAi-mediated gene silencing assays in adult mosquitoes
depend on direct injection of dsRNAs into the hemolymph, which resides in the insect's open circulatory system. The dsRNAs are then taken up by various tissues and
cell types. It is reasonable to expect that some tissues, such
as the antennae, are less accessible to this dsRNA and
would be less susceptible to RNAi-mediated gene silencing because it is more difficult for the double-stranded
RNA to diffuse into these body parts from the thoracic
hemolymph. Some of these genes are known to be
expressed in specific tissues, where they are most likely
regulated by peripheral circadian oscillators; others would
be expected to display a more general mRNA abundance
in multiple tissues. For instance, the obps are known to be
mainly localized in the antennae, proboscis, maxillary
palps and head [50,51]. The RNAi-mediated gene-silencing efficiency was highest in the remaining body parts for
the majority of the tested genes (ranging from 90% for
putative to1 to 20% for clk), while the head and antennae
displayed lower silencing efficiencies (10 – 20%) (Figure
4A and Additional file 7). However, even a relatively low
gene-silencing efficiency, as determined by a decreased
abundance of mRNA, may still produce a significantly
altered gene knockodown phenotype, as has been shown
previously in A. gambiae [52].

Modulation of blood-feeding behavior through gene
silencing of light-pulse regulated circadian and
chemosensory factors
We used an RNAi-based gene silencing approach to test
some of the light pulse regulated genes for implication in
the molecular interactions between the mosquito's light
cue sensing systems and its host-seeking and feeding systems. The feeding propensity of the tim, clk, cry 1 and putative to gene-silenced mosquitoes was increased by ~10 –
20%, whereas silencing of obp4 decreased the feeding propensity by ~20%, and silencing of per, obp22, or obp26 had
no apparent effect on the feeding phenotype when compared to the GFP dsRNA-treated control mosquitoes (Figure 5A and Additional file 8). The statistical analysis (Ttest and Mann Whitney [41,54]) showed that tim, clk, cry
1, three putative to and the obp4 gene-silenced mosquitoes
had a significantly increased feeding propensity (Additional file 8) compared to the GFP dsRNA treated control
mosquitoes. The mRNA abundance of all ten circadian
genes used for RNAi gene silencing assay are shown at
some of the light on/off time-zone assayed conditions by
both microarray and qRT-PCR assay (Additional file 9).
The increased feeding propensity in tim-cry1- and clksilenced mosquitoes may be explained by an effect on the
circadian clock, causing a delay in reaching the light-onset
phase when feeding propensity is normally low (Figure
1A). The increased blood feeding propensity in to silenced
mosquitoes suggest that these genes influence feeding
behavior in the mosquito, similarly to what has been
observed in the fruit fly [9]. The decreased blood-feeding
propensity of obp4-silenced mosquitoes supports a role
for this chemosensory factor in host seeking. The low level
of feeding inhibition that was produced by depletion of
two other obps (obp22 and 26) is likely a result of the inefficient RNAi silencing of these genes in the antennae. The
fold difference in feeding inhibition (% non-fed of gene
silenced divided by % non-fed of GFP) is shown in Figure
5B.

The transcript abundance of these genes was assessed in
the antennae (including proboscis and maxillary palps),
the head, and the remaining body of 4-day-old female
mosquitoes (Figure 4B). Since the circadian clock components have a rhythmic cyclical expression, RNA samples

and food status-related information into feeding-relevant
metabolism and activity [9,10]. Two A. gambiae takeout
genes (AGAP012703 and AGAP004263) identified earlier
in the antennae, [55] and one Aedes aegypti to gene
(AAEL011966) have been shown to be orthologs of the D.
melanogaster takeout protein [56]. In a separate study,
based on sequence similarity searches using the Aedes
takeout protein sequence (AAEL011966), another 25 Drosophila and 13 Anopheles homologs have been identified
[50]. Of these, only two Drosophila proteins (CG11853,
CG11854) and one Anopheles protein (AGAP004263;
AgTOL-2) displayed all the conserved features of a takeout
protein; the others contained only the conserved secretory
juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP) domain. We
used the A. gambiae putative takeout (AGAP004263; AgTOl-2) protein sequence in BLAST searches to identify two
additional members, AGAP012703 and AGAP004262,
both of which also showed differential regulation by light
pulse and blood feeding in the microarray analysis (Table
1). We have designated the three genes AGAP004263,
AGAP012703, and AGAP004262 as putative takeout1,
takeout 2, and takeout3, respectively. The three A. gambiae
putative to genes were analyzed in terms of their potential
sugar starvation-dependent regulation and showed a 1.5to 2.5-fold up-regulation after a 24-h sugar starvation
(Figure 6A). These transcripts returned to the pre-starvation levels of abundance after a 10% sugar solution was
provided; as previously shown with re-feeding in D. melanogaster [9]. Phylogenetic analysis of the six insect protein
sequences (three from A. gambiae, two from D. melanogaster, and one from A. aegypti) indicated that A. gambiae AGAP004263 is more closely related to Aedes
AAEL011966 and Drosophila takeout proteins (CG11853,
CG11854) than are the other two A. gambiae takeout proteins (AGAP012703 and AGAP004262) (Figure 6B). The
down-regulation of three putative to genes in the head and
up-regulation in the rest of the body with blood feeding
(Additional file 5), further support differential functions
of these factors in different parts of the mosquito in
response to assorted kind of feeding (sugar versus blood).

Conclusion
Our study has established an important role for the light
modulated circadian and chemosensory oscillators in the
regulation of the mosquito's blood feeding behavior, and
consequently its capacity to transmit blood-borne pathogens. While previous studies have described the A. gambiae flight activity during the night time and during the
twilight [11,12], here we provide insight into the molecular components and mechanisms that regulate the blood
feeding behavior. We have shown that the mosquito's
blood feeding behavior is under circadian control, with a
peak during the late night (Figure 1). A short 2 minute
light pulses can momentarily decrease the mosquito's
blood-feeding propensity in a non-circadian fashion,
while a longer light pulse of 2 hours can induce a phase
advance phenomenon in the mosquito's feeding behavior, similarly to what has been shown for the circadian
regulation on flight activity [12]. The short 2-min light
pulse can cause a profound change in the mosquito's transcriptome that reflected a modulation of a variety of physiological systems, including those that regulate the
mosquito's vectorial capacity. We have mainly focused on
transcripts that influence mosquito's feeding behavior;
future studies are needed to more clearly define the specific ways in which light can contribute to the regulation
of the mosquito's anti-Plasmodium defense system and its
resistance to infection. The overlap between the light
pulse- and blood feeding-induced transcriptomes encompassed a variety of genes, some of which represent molecular links between the mosquito's light sensing and
feeding systems. The dosage dependent effect of the short
2-minute light pulse on feeding propensity (Figure 2) over
time suggests it may represent a masking effect which
however involves several clock factors (Figure 3A). Further
detailed studies are required to better understand the
impact of a masking mechanism on the mosquito's
blood-feeding behavior, and whether this is a phase
dependent or independent system. The circadian expression pattern and down-regulation of several obp transcripts after light pulse stimulation (Table 1), in
conjunction with the gene-silencing phenotypes observed
for these genes (Figure 5), establishes them as essential

factors in the mosquito's host-seeking system and further
supports an important role of the mosquito's chemosensory oscillators in the regulation of host seeking and feeding behavior [15,16,33]. Future work should focus on the
characterization of these links since a detailed understanding of these interactions can lead to the development
of novel malaria control strategies based on interference
with the mosquito's host-seeking behavior.

Methods
Rearing of A. gambiae mosquitoes
A. gambiae Keele strain mosquitoes were raised at 27°C
and 70% humidity, and adults were maintained on a 10%
sucrose solution according to standard rearing condition
[57]. The insectary room was equipped with a Philips 25watt T8 fluorescent lamp (3500K; daylight spectrum) having an intensity of ~800–1000 lux.

The blood feeding behavior of A. gambiae adult
mosquitoes and the light pulse treatments
Each type of blood-feeding assay was repeated at least
three independent times; with three replicas (of ~20 mosquitoes each) every time. In all assays, the 37°C blood
meal was provided by standard artificial membrane feeding system (Parafilm M) for 10 min. The females were first
entrained to the 12-h LD cycle of the insectary for 5–6
days before any assays were carried out.

For the time course study of mosquito blood feeding
behavior; three mosquito cups (for 3 replicas) were given
37°C blood meal for 10 min, every 3 h (Figure 1). The set
that was kept in constant DD, three cups for each set were
kept in airtight plastic containers covered with aluminum
foil for 48 h before the experiment was conducted. Every
3 h during the assay, one box was opened and the mosquitoes were given 37°C blood meal in dark for 10 min. For
mosquitoes that were given light pulses (Figure 1B and
1C), mosquito cups for each set were kept in separate airtight transparent plastic container (3 replicas for each)
and maintained in DD or LD conditions. At or before
19.30 hours, light pulses were given (for 5 min or 2 h),
after which blood meal was provided for the next 24
hours, every 3 h. The DD or LD conditions were maintained even during blood-feeding time for all the assays.
For the light pulse assays in early morning hours (Figure
2); the night before the assay, each plastic container (containing 3 mosquito cups) was covered with aluminum foil
just as the light went off for the night (light intensity in
dark was ~1.5 lux). The following day prior to light phase
initiation, light pulses were given at different time points
and for different durations to each set (Figure 2A and 2B);
by removing the aluminum foil and the cover of the
respective boxes. After the light pulses, the boxes were covered with aluminum foil and returned to their original
room, which was still in dark. The mosquitoes were given
a 37°C blood meal for 10 min, when the light went on in
the insectary (ZT 0). After feeding, the mosquitoes were
sorted according to the amount of blood they had
ingested: those that had not fed at all (non-fed), those
with a fully stretched abdomen (fully fed) and those with
a small quantity of blood in the abdomen (partially fed)
(Figure 2 and Additional file 1). Statistical analysis Students T-tests were done and the p-values are shown in
Additional file 2.
In all the assays, care was taken not to disturb the mosquitoes and to minimize their exposure to other external
stimuli during the light pulse treatments: the experimenter wore a lab coat, double gloves, and a face mask.
The light pulses were given to each set in a different room,
so as to avoid the unnecessary exposure of any other
experimental boxes to the light. In addition, all the differ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/8/23

ent mosquito groups were always contained in their
respective airtight plastic containers to reduce the exposure of other mosquito sets when working with one particular set.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
RNA was extracted and quantified (in triplicate) either
from whole mosquitoes or separately from the antennae
(also including the maxillary palps and proboscis), the
head, and the rest of the body, using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA). The qRT-PCR assays were
performed as previously described [41] and the ribosomal
protein S7 gene was used for normalization of the cDNA
templates. The fold differences in expression levels or
gene silencing efficiency (see below) were calculated
according to the standard EΔΔCt method [58].
RNAi gene-silencing assays in adult mosquitoes
RNA interference (RNAi) assays in adult female mosquitoes were performed using established RNAi methodology [59] injecting ~200 ngm dsRNA per mosquito. To
silence the obp genes in head and antennae; at least 7–8
times more dsRNA (~1400–1600 ngm per mosquito)
were injected to get a better silencing efficiency in these
body parts, where diffusion of dsRNA through hemolymph would be less accessible. Three independent RNAi
gene-silencing assays were performed for each gene with
two replicas each time (~30 mosquitoes in each replica).
The sequences of the primers used for making dsRNA are
provided in Additional file 10. The gene silencing was verified by qRT-PCR, 4 days after injection of the dsRNA, and
the A. gambiae ribosomal protein S7 gene was used for
normalization of the cDNA templates [58]. The primers
used for silencing verification are presented in Additional
file 11. To study the blood-feeding behavior of the mosquitoes after RNAi gene silencing; 4 days after dsRNA
injections the mosquitoes were blood-fed at the time of
light onset in the insectary (described earlier) and were
scored for blood-fed mosquitoes versus unfed. For statistical analysis, Students T-tests and Mann Whitney tests
were done and the p-values are shown in Additional file 8.
Microarray analysis
RNA was extracted (in triplicates) from total or head of the
mosquitoes (as described earlier) of light pulsed and
blood fed mosquitoes. The control samples were nonpulsed and unfed mosquitoes respectively. Sample preparations and microarray hybridizations were performed as
previously described [41] with the experimental samples
being labeled with Cy-3 and control samples being Cy-5
labeled. Scanning and data analyses were performed as
previously described with a signal cut-off intensity of 100
to remove low-intensity/poorly hybridized spots from the
analysis. Loc-Fit normalization (LOWESS) was performed
independently for each data set through MIDAS (available

online, TIGR). The TMEV software (available online,
TIGR) was then used for SAM analysis with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Only transcripts that had signal values
above or below the log2 cutoff value of ± 0.80 were used
for further analysis as previously described. The expression data generated by the microarray were validated
independently by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)
for some of the genes and plotted (Additional file 4).
There was a high correlation (best-fit linear regression, R2
= 0.76; slope of the regression line, m = 0.91) between the
log2-transformed values for the microarray and qRT-PCR.

The influence of blood gustatory, temperature and color parameters on the
mosquito blood-feeding behavior. A. Mosquitoes were allowed to probe
and feed for 10 min on either 37oC blood (warm blood), 24oC blood
(cold blood), 37oC cell line MEM medium (warm red solution), or 37oC
water through artificial membrane feeders. The number of mosquitoes
probing the membrane was counted every 1 min for 10 min and plotted.
The error bars indicate the standard error for six replicate assays. B. The
total number (calculated by adding the numbers for each individual
minute for 10 min) of mosquitoes that fed on 37oC blood, 24oC blood
(cold blood), 37oC MEM medium, or water.

Relationship between the light pulse and blood feeding regulated A. gambiae transcriptome. A. The experimental design for the light pulse and
blood feeding regulated transcriptome studies. The assays were subdivided
into two categories: light-pulse treatment (with further subdivision of total
mosquitoes and head samples) and blood feeding (further subdivided to
head samples and the remaining body). In the light pulse category, six different assays were done (labeled as "a" to "f") and in the blood-fed category, two assays were done (labeled as "g" and "h") and the details of the
experimental and control samples/conditions are described. For each
assay, the arrowhead points toward the experimental sample (Cy3 label)
and the other side refers to the control sample (Cy5 label). B. Pie chart
showing the total number of genes (in brackets) that were regulated by
both light pulse and blood feeding in different functional groups [CIR: circadian; CSR: chemosensory; PROT/DIG: proteolytic digestion; IMM:
immunity; MET: metabolism; CS: cytoskeletal and structural; RED/STR:
redox/stress; R/T/T: replication/transcription and translation; TRP: transport]. C. Validation of microarray gene expression data by qRT-PCR. The
log2 transformed values generated by microarrays and qRT-PCR were
plotted and showed a significant co-relation between the two assays.

Blood-feeding propensity of mosquitoes after RNAi gene silencing Ten circadian/chemosensory genes were individually silenced in mosquitoes, and
the mosquitoes were allowed to feed on blood at the light-on stage in the
insectary. The percentages of mosquitoes that did not feed (non-fed) were
scored and are shown along with their standard error values. The P- values
from statistical analysis; T-test and Mann Whitney Test are also shown.

The light pulse and blood feeding regulated A. gambiae transcriptome.
List of genes regulated by both light-pulse and blood feeding, along with
their previous and recent transcript IDs. Note that the recent AGAP-R IDs
for some transcripts are missing in ENSEMBL and so they are left blank
in column 2. The list includes only those genes that showed a significant
(above the threshold of ±0.8; log2 1.75) level of regulation in at least one
of the eight assays ("a" to "h"). The non-significant values (if any) of
these genes in other assays are also shown. The gene list is sorted according
to the functional groups (discussed in Additional file 4 legend). The eight
different assay types ("a" to "h") are listed in the first row.

Determination of RNAi knockdown efficiency of the 10 circadian/chemosensory genes in A. gambiae female mosquitoes after dsRNA injections.
RNA was extracted from different body parts of gene silenced mosquitoes
and the GFP dsRNA treated control mosquitoes, and the relative mRNA
levels were determined for each gene in both samples. The mRNA level in
GFP mosquitoes was set to 1.0, and the corresponding % silencing was
determined by qRT-PCR. The AgS7 gene was used for normalization. The
standard error values are shown.
