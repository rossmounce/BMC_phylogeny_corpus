Abstract
Background: Despite the improvements of tools for automated annotation of genome sequences,
manual curation at the structural and functional level can provide an increased level of refinement
to genome annotation. The Institute for Genomic Research Rice Genome Annotation (hereafter
named the Osa1 Genome Annotation) is the product of an automated pipeline and, for this reason,
will benefit from the input of biologists with expertise in rice and/or particular gene families.
Leveraging knowledge from a dispersed community of scientists is a demonstrated way of
improving a genome annotation. This requires tools that facilitate 1) the submission of gene
annotation to an annotation project, 2) the review of the submitted models by project annotators,
and 3) the incorporation of the submitted models in the ongoing annotation effort.
Results: We have developed the Eukaryotic Community Annotation Package (EuCAP), an
annotation tool, and have applied it to the rice genome. The primary level of curation by community
annotators (CA) has been the annotation of gene families. Annotation can be submitted by email
or through the EuCAP Web Tool. The CA models are aligned to the rice pseudomolecules and the
coordinates of these alignments, along with functional annotation, are stored in the MySQL EuCAP
Gene Model database. Web pages displaying the alignments of the CA models to the Osa1 Genome
models are automatically generated from the EuCAP Gene Model database. The alignments are
reviewed by the project annotators (PAs) in the context of experimental evidence. Upon approval
by the PAs, the CA models, along with the corresponding functional annotations, are integrated
into the Osa1 Genome Annotation. The CA annotations, grouped by family, are displayed on the
Community Annotation pages of the project website http://rice.tigr.org, as well as in the
Community Annotation track of the Genome Browser.
Conclusion: We have applied EuCAP to rice. As of July 2007, the structural and/or functional
annotation of 1,094 genes representing 57 families have been deposited and integrated into the
current gene set. All of the EuCAP components are open-source, thereby allowing the
implementation of EuCAP for the annotation of other genomes. EuCAP is available at http://
sourceforge.net/projects/eucap/.

Background
Accurate and consistent annotation of genomes presents a
challenge that can be partially solved by automated and
semi-automated annotation methods. Improvements in
the structural annotation of gene models can be obtained
through training of ab initio gene finders and, for eukaryotes, through empirical transcript support in the form of
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and, more critically, fulllength cDNAs [1-3]. In addition to structural annotation,
in large-scale genome annotation projects functional
annotation is performed in an automated manner and on
an individual gene basis (using sequence homology and
domain searches), and would greatly benefit from manual
inspection. Indeed, comparative analysis of related genes
can provide important clues for the structural annotation
of related proteins and assist in generating a homogeneous naming scheme at the family level.
The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Rice Genome
Annotation database (hereafter referred to as the Osa1
Genome Annotation database) contains the structural
and functional annotation of the Oryza sativa L. ssp.
japonica cv. Nipponbare genome [4]. It is the product of a
mature pipeline that integrates ESTs and full-length
cDNAs with the FGENESH ab initio gene predictions,
using the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA
[2]) for structural annotation. Functional annotation is
achieved through BLAST and domain searches (see details
in [5,6]). Despite the availability of over 1.1 million ESTs
and 33,000 full-length cDNAs [7], 28,006 of the total
51,286 non-transposable element-related gene models
predicted in the rice genome have no or partial experimental support for their structure. Given the lack of experimental evidence, it is likely that some of these models are
mis-annotated at the structural level. Additionally, some
genes are probably undetected by our pipeline, as suggested by Massively Parallel Signature Sequence (MPSS)
data [8].
Since the sequencing of the human genome, 'open annotation' or reaching out to biologists with expertise in an
organism of interest or in particular gene families has
been recognized as a powerful way to improve the automated annotation of sequenced genomes through manual review [9]. In addition, participation by the
community helps maintain up-to-date sets of models after
the end of an initial annotation project. Several
approaches have been used to solicit community involvement including 1) 'jamborees' where annotation is performed by a select group of experts gathered in the same
location for a short period of time as for Drosophila [10]
and mouse [11], 2) organized, dispersed efforts that are
limited in time as done with honeybee [12], or 3) ongoing dispersed submissions from the community (Arabi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/388

dopsis [13], Caenorhabditis elegans [14], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [15]).
Participants in the Rice Annotation Project (RAP) manually annotated 28,540 protein-coding genes supported by
full-length cDNA from rice or other monocots [16] using
the second approach. However, open-reading frames
(ORFs) were assigned functions on a gene-by-gene basis,
similar to our automated pipeline. In addition, only genes
with EST or cDNA evidence were annotated. In Arabidopsis, several hundred genes predicted exclusively by ab initio
prediction programs or through comparative alignment
with Brassica have been experimentally validated [17-20],
suggesting that many low-expression genes or genes with
very circumscribed expression patterns may be missed by
the RAP effort.
To improve the quality of the rice genome annotation, we
have developed EuCAP (Eukaryotic Community Annotation Package), a portable and flexible system for 1) the
submission of structural and functional annotation of
genes by dispersed Community Annotators (CAs), 2) the
evaluation of CA contributions by Project Annotators
(PAs), and 3) the incorporation of CA contributions into
our ongoing annotation effort.
Most approaches for the management of community
input have aimed at "bringing annotation into the mainstream" and consists of developing tools for members of
the community to annotate models de novo through a web
interface (such as yrGATE [21], PeerGAD [22] or ASAP
[23]). Although this gene-by-gene approach has its benefits, it is ill-suited for the direct integration of previous
knowledge by the CA and it requires that the CA be comfortable weighing the experimental evidence presented to
him/her. Like PseudoCAP, which was designed for the
annotation of P. aeruginosa [15], EuCAP has the advantage
of also accepting cDNA sequences as input. This feature
allows the CAs to directly submit models annotated previously by their method of choice. In addition, the ability to
input sequence makes the EuCAP pipeline coordinateindependent, and allows researchers using rice pseudomolecules (virtual contigs representing the 12 rice chromosomes [6]) built at different time or by different groups
to submit their annotations without the difficulty of converting coordinates. EuCAP aims to make the submission
of pre-determined gene structures as simple as possible
while also allowing, if desired, the visualization and modification of these models in the context of available evidence.
The EuCAP pipeline relies on two MySQL databases. The
EuCAP Gene Model database is populated with structural
and functional annotations provided through the EuCAP
Web Tool or via email to a PA. The Osa1 GFF database

contains the Generic Feature Format (GFF)-formatted
models of the Osa1 Genome Annotation (Figure 1). Customized Perl scripts facilitate the population of these databases and the generation of web pages displaying the CA
model and any overlapping models from the latest release
of the Osa1 Genome Annotation. Upon acceptance by the
PA, the CA model is integrated into the Osa1 Genome
Annotation [24]. As of July 2007, over 1,000 models have
been contributed and approved for incorporation in the
Osa1 gene set.

(containing feature coordinates of Osa1 models) and the
EuCAP Gene Model database, a customized web page is generated for each family. After review of the model by the PA
and approval of the pages by the CA, the web pages are
made public, the CA models are added to the Genome
Browser and used to update the Osa1 Genome Annotation
database.

Implementation
EuCAP Gene Model database
The EuCAP Gene Model database is a MySQL database
that stores the functional and structural annotation submitted by the CAs. The schema consists of six tables: Users
(CA information), Family (gene family information),
Superfamily (optional information linking gene families),
Loci (submitted functional annotation), Structural_
annotation (submitted structural annotation stored in
GFF), and Sessions (a utility table for CGI session management). A file with the SQL commands needed to set up
the database tables is included in the package available on
sourceforge or in additional file 1.
Osa1 GFF database
The Osa1 GFF database uses the BioPerl Bio::DB::GFF
schema and is loaded with GFF-formatted annotation
from the current version of the Osa1 Genome Annotation
database [24]. It is used by the EuCAP Web Tool and the
web page generation scripts described below. It is also the
backend for the Osa1 Genome Browser.
EuCAP Web Tool
The Web Tool, available for testing at [25], is composed of
a server side Perl CGI script, the EuCAP Gene Model database, and client side Javascript. The web pages are stored
as templates and can therefore be customized and integrated into the style of an existing website. They are
dynamically completed using HTML::Template. The
Class::DBI module is used to provide an Object Relational
Mapper (ORM) layer for database access. Session management is provided by the CGI::Session module. User
authentication is provided by the Authen::Passphrase
modules. Several BioPerl modules are used to access the
Osa1 GFF and EuCAP Gene Model databases, generate
images, perform BLAST searches, and parse BLAST output.
Handling of email submissions
Input for the EuCAP pipeline consists of a cDNA sequence
for each CA model and of an Excel spreadsheet containing
functional information for the CA model(s). The first step
of the pipeline is to determine the Osa1 locus identifiers
(LOC_OsXXgXXXX) with which the CA models overlap.
This is done by searching the cDNAs against the rice pseudomolecules using GMAP (the Genomic Mapping and
Alignment Program, [26]). A Perl script parses the GMAP
compressed output and searches the mapped coordinates
against the Osa1 Genome Annotation Database to identify the Osa1 models overlapping with the CA models.
The spreadsheet, complete with the Osa1 locus identifiers
or mapping coordinates if no Osa1 model is defined at
that locus, are loaded into the Loci table of the EuCAP
Gene Model database. The cDNAs of the CA models are
aligned to the rice pseudomolecule twice using GMAP
with different set of options. Output of the -S -n 1 -T

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:388

options contains alignments truncated to the largest open
reading frame and, by comparison to the full alignment
output (-S -n 1 options), allows the calculation of the
untranslated regions (UTRs). The two alignments are
parsed and a GFF output of the models' structures is created. The GFF file is loaded into the Structural_annotation
table of the EuCAP Gene Model database. The Superfamily, Family, and Users table of the EuCAP Gene Model
database are populated based on information provided by
the CA in the spreadsheet.
Display of the Community Annotation
Once the functional and structural annotation for a gene
family is loaded into the EuCAP Gene Model database,
Perl scripts generate the web pages using a HTML template
and the BioPerl Bio::Graphics interface to create the
images of the Osa1 and CA models.
Incorporation of the CA models to a new release of the
Osa1 Genome Annotation
CA models are first evaluated against the most recent
release of the Osa1 Genome Annotation. When a new
release is launched, the models predicted by our automated pipeline are substituted with the adopted CA models. In the fall of 2006, our automated annotation pipeline
was run in preparation for Release 5 of our annotation.
Perl scripts were used to compare the CA models to the
new gene predictions based on their GFF-formatted coordinate information. In cases where the Osa1 model differed from an accepted CA model, the coordinates of the
Osa1 model were adjusted in the Osa1 Genome Annotation database to the CA model using Neomorphic's Annotation Station [27]. Models missed by the automated
pipeline were also incorporated in the final release
through Annotation Station. The CA functional annotations (in the form "gene name-gene description") were
used to overwrite the automated annotation in the Osa1
Genome Annotation database. Afterward, a copy of the
EuCAP Gene Model database was made. The locus identifiers and the functional annotation of the locus linked to
the CA models were changed in the new database when
different from the previous release. This new database was
used to make CA web pages reflecting the changes in the
Osa1 Genome Annotation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/388

protein or nucleotide sequence to identify the gene or
locus to be annotated. Once the corresponding Osa1
model or the locus is found, the CA provides the name
and description for the gene. Additional functional annotation such as source (publication, website, etc...), criteria
used to determine the function, CA comments, putative
subcellular localization, primer sequences, accession
numbers of supporting evidence, or mutant lines can also
be entered.
Structural annotation can also be performed by the CA
(Figure 2). The submitted model can be visualized alongside the Osa1 model(s), Rice Transcript Assemblies
(which are clustered assemblies of ESTs, full length
cDNAs, and mRNAs [29]) as well as full-length cDNAs
aligning in the same region. In this interactive page, coordinates of the exon features of the depicted evidence and
models are available through hyperlinks. New exons,
updated coordinates and UTRs can be added to the CA
model, and viewed in the light of the available evidence.
Links to the Osa1 Rice Genome Browser [6], the Manatee
page in which structural and functional evidence such as
protein domains and BLASTP search results are collated
[30], the Iowa State Web AAT server [31], and the genomic
sequence are provided to assist the CAs in refining their
annotation. Upon submission, the coordinates of the contributed model are stored in the EuCAP Gene Model database.
While on-line submission is well-suited for a small
number of genes, or in cases where the CA would like to
edit online his/her models based on the current Osa1
model or experimental evidence, it is tedious for large
families and redundant when the gene model structure
has already been established by the CA. Therefore, we
have developed an e-mail-based submission process
thereby providing CAs the option of emailing the models'
cDNA sequences (or just the Osa1 model identifiers if the
CA models are identical to current or previous Osa1 models) along with a preformatted Excel spreadsheet containing the gene names and descriptions, a brief description of
the annotation methods used, and supporting cDNA or
protein accessions. These data are then readily used to
populate the Loci and Family tables of the EuCAP Gene
Model database using a simple script.

Results and Discussion
The submission and curation process
Annotations can currently be submitted to the project in
two ways to provide maximal ease and participation of
CAs. The EuCAP Web Tool was constructed for the CA to
contribute structural and functional annotation of genes
and gene models via a web-based portal [25,28]. In the
first page of the EuCAP Web Tool, the user is prompted to
enter a model or locus identifier, or alternatively, perform
a BLAST search against the rice pseudomolecules using a

Automated display of alignment of the CA model
Alignment of the CA-provided cDNA sequences onto the
rice pseudomolecules and prediction of the ORFs in the
cDNA are performed using GMAP [26]. The alignments
are converted to GFF and loaded into the
Structural_annotation table of the the EuCAP Gene Model
database. Graphical views of the CA models and Osa1
models (if annotated) are generated through a Perl script
that retrieves the coordinate information of the CA and of

web page featuring these graphical representations and all
the information relevant to the CA models and the family
(i.e. name of the annotator, criteria used, etc...) is then
automatically generated (Figure 3). Hyperlinks of each
locus to the Osa1 Genome Browser allow the visualization of the experimental evidence aligning at that genomic
location.
Review by Project Annotators
Prior to the public release of the community annotation,
the CA-generated structural and functional annotation are
reviewed by a PA. This review has three goals: 1) to ascertain that the intellectual contribution of the annotator is
represented as intended in the CA webpage, 2) to communicate differences between the CA and the Osa1 models to
the CA, and 3) to decide whether the CA model should be
adopted and integrated into the Osa1 Genome Annotation or whether it should be rejected.

If differences exist between the structure of the CA model
and that of the Osa1 model, all supporting evidence is
evaluated and weighed to determine the best structural
annotation of the locus, and whether the Osa1 model
should be modified according to the CA. Accepted guidelines for manual curation are followed for this evaluation,
namely a full-length cDNA is more trustworthy than an
EST which itself is more trustworthy than a protein alignment followed by a gene prediction [32]. When no evidence is available, or when the evidence is contradictory,
the CA model is favored. The final decision regarding the
structure of the Osa1 model resides with the PA and is
shared with the CA. However, the CA is free to represent
his/her model within the CA gene family web page regardless of whether the model will be incorporated into the
Osa1 Genome Annotation. The gene name and description given by the CA is adopted for the Osa1 model unless
gross structural differences exist between the two models.

the Osa1 models (in blue) is shown. Gene name and function provided by the CA, accession(s) for the genomic, cDNA and/or
protein sequence(s) and other information of interest are listed and hyperlinked to further web pages.

Integration of the CA annotation into the Osa1 Genome
Annotation
As of July 2007, 1,114 genes contributed by 18 CAs were
evaluated against the Release 5 models predicted by our
pipeline for incorporation into the Osa1 Genome Annotation. A total of 1,094 CA models were adopted. The
structural and/or functional annotation of the 457 genes
reviewed and adopted before January 2007 was incorporated into Release 5, while that of the 637 genes reviewed
later will be integrated in the next release. Altogether, we
found that 885 or 79% of the genes contributed were
structurally identical to the Osa1 models (notwithstanding the UTRs) (Table 1), indicating the high quality of our
automated pipeline. A total of 64 (5.7%) CA genes, with
no corresponding locus identifiers, were "missed" by our

annotation pipeline and were added to our set of models
(see an example in Figure 4). In addition, 78 (7%) models
had their internal structure modified (see an example in
Figure 5), and 12 alternative splice forms were added
(Table 1) according to the CA models. Twenty (1.8%)
contributed models that either contradicted available evidence, or were most likely the product of truncated
cDNAs, or contained non-consensus splice sites, were not
adopted.
A total of 72 (6.5%) of the models were annotated as
pseudogenes by the CAs. These genes are thought to be
non-functional due to the presence of premature stop
codon(s) interrupting the reading frame, and are currently
not annotated as such by our automated annotation pipe-

line. Seventeen of the 72 CA pseudogenes were annotated
as genes by our pipeline, while 25 overlapped with annotated genes but had different boundaries or internal structure. Thirty were not annotated. Pseudogenes are difficult
to identify in an automated manner. They are best recognized by comparison to functional members of the family
which allows the detection of frameshifts and premature
truncation. The CA platform is therefore ideal for their
identification.
The most important contribution of the community effort
has been toward functional annotation. Through annotation of entire families, CAs provide a nomenclature that is
uniform at the family level and which is current with the
published literature. We updated the functional annota-

maize and Arabidopsis tracks represent the percent sequence homology with rice. The CA model is supported by sequence
homology of exons in Arabidopsis, maize, and sorghum.

tion of 1,094 loci from the Osa1 Genome Annotation
from the annotation assigned through our automated
pipeline with the functional annotation provided by the
CA.
To reflect the convergence of the community and the Osa1
models, the CA web pages and the Osa1 Genome Browser
CA track were updated in January 2007 with the final
Release 5 locus identifiers, model structures, and functional annotations. These overall changes were possible
by the storage of the CA annotation in a dedicated database. We anticipate conducting a similar integration effort
with models contributed in 2007 in the next release of the
Osa1 Genome Annotation.

Use of community annotation for the improvement of the
automated pipeline
In order to identify areas for improvement for our automated pipeline, we examined cases of "missed" or wrong
predictions by our pipeline in comparison to models provided by the CAs. Occurrences of missed genes resulted
almost exclusively from the absence of FGENESH models,
while misannotated genes resulted from inaccurate
FGENESH prediction with no or partial EST support. At
these loci, CA models were supported primarily by protein alignments from Arabidopsis or by aligning assemblies from maize or sorghum (Figures 4 and 5). This
reflects the fact that most CA models were identified by
homology to fully-characterized proteins in rice or other

plants, or by phylogenetic analysis [33-35]. The incorporation of protein evidence into the automated prediction
of ORF could improve the final model in such cases. To
that end, we are currently evaluating the performance of
Evidence Modeler [36], an algorithm incorporating ab initio gene predictions, cDNA and protein evidence into the
gene model.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/388

tists that have made their data public to participate in the
community annotation process. We expect that the full
sequence of additional plant genomes, in particular maize
and sorghum [40], will stimulate the use of phylogenomics approaches for the annotation of gene families in the
Grasses and thereby provide more high-quality annotations to incorporate into our community annotation
project.

Conclusion
We have designed EuCAP, a package for the incorporation
of structural and functional annotation from the community into an on-going annotation effort. Sets of simple Perl
scripts allow the PAs to quickly enter the information in a
database, integrate the CA annotation in the current
project annotation and generate web pages. These pages
represent the community models, credit the CAs, and provide a centralized repository for their annotation.

During the course of designing and validating the pipeline, we have learned that shifting the burden of the data
processing from the CAs to a few trained PAs with a set of
custom scripts at their disposal greatly enhances the efficiency of the submission process and stimulates greater
CA participation. CAs do not have to abide by strict data
format constraints but are able to simply provide
sequence files. For this reason, most CAs have chosen to
email their data rather than submit it with the EuCAP Web
Tool.
In our experience, soliciting contributions is essential to a
dynamic community annotation project. Direct requests
to the authors of relevant publications, presentation of the
project at meetings and announcements on our website
generated the majority of the contributions. In just one
year, we have successfully obtained over 1,114 manually
curated genes (57 families) from members of the rice and
plant community at large, incorporated this annotation
into our annual update, and displayed all of the CA annotation on individualized web pages. By comparison, The
Arabidopsis Information Resource lists 8,331 genes in
996 families annotated by the community [37]. However,
it should be taken into consideration that the Arabidopsis
genome was completed in 2000 [38], five years before the
rice genome [39] and that the Arabidopsis community is
larger than the rice community. To avoid the waning of
interest and participation observed by other community
annotation projects after their initial efforts, we are committed to maintaining a proactive strategy to solicit scien-
