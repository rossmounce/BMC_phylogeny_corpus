Abstract
Background: The neotropical butterfly Heliconius heurippa has a hybrid colour pattern, which also
contributes to reproductive isolation, making it a likely example of hybrid speciation. Here we used
phylogenetic and coalescent-based analyses of multilocus sequence data to investigate the origin of
H. heurippa.
Results: We sequenced a mitochondrial region (CoI and CoII), a sex-linked locus (Tpi) and two
autosomal loci (w and sd) from H. heurippa and the putative parental species, H. cydno and H.
melpomene. These were analysed in combination with data from two previously sequenced
autosomal loci, Dll and Inv. H. heurippa was monophyletic at mtDNA and Tpi, but showed a shared
distribution of alleles derived from both parental lineages at all four autosomal loci. Estimates of
genetic differentiation showed that H. heurippa is closer to H. cydno at mtDNA and three autosomal
loci, intermediate at Tpi, and closer to H. melpomene at Dll. Using coalescent simulations with the
Isolation-Migration model (IM), we attempted to establish the incidence of gene flow in the origin
of H. heurippa. This analysis suggested that ongoing introgression is frequent between all three
species and variable in extent between loci.
Conclusion: Introgression, which is a necessary precursor of hybrid speciation, seems to have
also blurred the coalescent history of these species. The origin of Heliconius heurippa may have
been restricted to introgression of few colour pattern genes from H. melpomene into the H. cydno
genome, with little evidence of genomic mosaicism.

Background
Homoploid hybrid speciation, in which a hybrid lineage
becomes established as a novel species without a change
in chromosome number, is thought to be rare and has
only been well documented in a handful of plant and animals species [1-7]. Indeed, most of what is known is based
on detailed studies of just one group, the Helianthus sun-

flowers. Notably, the species Helianthus anomalus has a
clearly hybrid genome in which large blocks of the
genome are derived from one or other of the parental species, Helianthus petiolaris and Helianthus annus [8]. The
most convincing evidence comes from the fact that synthetic hybrids between the two species show a similar
genomic composition and some ecological characteristics

of the natural hybrid lineage [9]. This work has led to a
view of homoploid hybrid speciation in which the
derived hybrid lineage has a genome comprising similar
proportions of the two parental genomes [4].
Nonetheless, this is not the only way in which hybridization might contribute to speciation. In cichlid fishes and
Darwin's finches for example, it has been suggested that
adaptive radiation might have been facilitated by evolutionary novelty generated through hybridization [10,11].
There is also strong evidence for gene flow at adaptive loci
in the Hawaiian silverswords and in smelt fishes [12,13].
Thus, novel traits that directly affect adaptive divergence
and/or reproductive isolation might become established
as a result of introgression [14,15]. If the traits also have
pleiotropic effects on reproductive isolation (i.e. 'magic
traits' sensu Gavrilets 2004 [16]), hybridization could
make a direct contribution to reproductive isolation of a
novel lineage and hence, to speciation [5,17]. Under this
scenario, if establishment of the hybrid trait involved
many generations of backcrossing, then the genome of the
novel hybrid linage could be predominantly derived from
one of the parental species [17]. Regions of the genome
not under selection might also be subject to gene flow
through occasional ongoing hybridization between
hybrid and parental species [18,19]. In Heliconius butterflies, Müllerian mimicry is common, often between
related but non-sister species [20,21]. This implies
repeated parallel evolution of shared colour patterns from
an ancestral phenotype [20]. However, an alternative is
that similar colour elements might be homologous and
transferred between species through occasional hybridization and backcrossing events [20]. Natural hybrids show
that 27% of species have inter-specific hybridization and
that backcrosses are fairly common [20]. Thus, Heliconius
pattern diversity could be facilitated by the movement of
pre-established colour pattern adaptations [20,22,23].
Heliconius heurippa appears to have speciated via the
hybrid origin of its novel colour pattern, which shares elements derived from both H. melpomene and H. cydno [2326]. When H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene, subspecies
that occur near the current range of H. heurippa on the
eastern slope of the Colombian Andes are crossed, a virtually identical colour pattern to that of H. heurippa can be
created in the laboratory after just three generations [26].
Crosses between H. heurippa and these artificial hybrids
show that the pattern breeds true implying genetic homology between the different forms, although this remains to
be proven at a molecular genetic level [26]. Heliconius colour patterns are aposematic and often mimetic, such that
rare colour pattern hybrids are selected against by predators [27,28]. Thus, divergent colour pattern probably contributes to post-mating isolation between the species. In
addition, behavioural experiments show that the com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/132

bined hybrid colour pattern of H. heurippa is critical for
mate recognition [26]. Removal of either the red element
derived from H. melpomene, or the yellow element derived
from H. cydno, results in the pattern being less attractive to
H. heurippa males. These data therefore provide strong evidence that the Heliconius heurippa colour pattern is a
hybrid trait that causes reproductive isolation.
Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether H. heurippa arose
via a hybrid founding of the genome, similar to Helianthus
anomalus, or through introgression of a few H. melpomene
colour pattern alleles into the genome of H. cydno. In
between these extremes, a variety of intermediate scenarios could be envisaged with varying levels of ongoing gene
flow during speciation. Ecological and genetic studies
indicate that H. heurippa is most closely related to H.
cydno. Ecologically, H. heurippa is a geographic replacement of H. cydno, with similar habitat and altitudinal preferences. Crosses show female hybrid sterility between H.
heurippa and H. melpomene, but complete compatibility
between H. heurippa and H. cydno [24]. However, microsatellite data show that H. heurippa is a distinct species and
not simply a geographic race of H. cydno; H. heurippa is
considerably more differentiated than any other geographic populations of H. melpomene or H. cydno sampled
in Panama, Colombia and Venezuela [26]. Additionally,
H. heurippa had an intriguing pattern at two nuclear loci
(invected and Distal-less). In both H. heurippa shares haplotypes with H. melpomene and H. cydno [26,29]. Here we
examine the incidence of gene flow in the speciation history of H. heurippa, using sequences of these genes and
fragments of five additional genes.

Results
Description of gene regions
We sequenced a mitochondrial region of 1572 bp representing 799 bp of CoI, 62 bp of the tRNALEU and 711 bp
of CoII from 11 individuals. Including sequences from
GenBank, the alignment had 1572 nucleotide sites examined from 69 individuals, of which 155 (10%) were variable. We obtained 584 bp of the Z-linked Triose
phosphate isomerase exon 3 (31 bp), intron 3 (430 bp)
and exon 4 (123 bp), for 11 alleles from 11 individuals.
Including sequences from GenBank the total alignment
had 25 alleles from 22 individuals. Identity was confirmed by comparison with reference sequences for H. c.
chioneus (AF413788) and H. m. rosina (AF413790).

The four autosomal regions were portions of nuclear loci
initially chosen for their potential role in the development
of butterfly wing patterns [30]. Three of these, Distal-less,
invected and scalloped, are transcription factors [31-33],
while the fourth, white, is member of the ommochrome
biosynthesis pathway that generates the yellow, orange
and red pigments in Heliconius [34]. However, linkage

mapping has shown that none of these genes are linked to
the switch genes that control pattern divergence in Heliconius [35,36], so there is currently no evidence that they are
involved in pattern evolution. We included 558 bp of Distal-less, corresponding to exon 4/5 (175 bp), intron 5 (333
bp) and exon 6 (50 bp) of Drosophila (NM166689- intron
4 is absent in Heliconius) for 32 alleles from 20 individuals; 439 bp of invected exon 2 (67 bp), intron 2 (265 bp)
and exon 3 (107 bp) for 42 alleles from 23 individuals.
We obtained 499 bp of white exon 4 (49 bp), intron 4
(397 bp) and exon 5 (53 bp) for 25 alleles from 17 individuals; 483 bp of the scalloped gene from exon 7 (13 bp),
intron 7 (334 bp) and exon 8 (136 bp) for 22 alleles from
12 individuals.
Species relationships and population genetic parameters
None of the three species formed a monophyletic group at
all of the genes sampled. In the phylogeny derived from
mitochondrial DNA, individuals of the three species fell
into three well-supported monophyletic clades (Figure 1):
1) an eastern melpomene clade; 2) the cydno clade including all the H. cydno and H. heurippa sampled and seven H.
m. melpomene from the eastern Andean foothills; 3) a
western melpomene clade. Within the cydno clade, the H.
heurippa haplotypes form a monophyletic group with five
fixed differences from H. cydno (0.92% net divergence).
Genetic diversity in H. heurippa was the lowest of the three
species (Table 1). Tajima's D was not significantly different from zero (Table 1), suggesting that a small but constant population size rather than a recent bottleneck is
more likely to explain the lack of variation in H. heurippa.
Interestingly Tajima's D estimates were significantly negative for two of the three populations of H. melpomene (H.
m. rosina and H. m. mocoa) included here for comparison
(Table 1), possibly reflecting a recent bottleneck or
mtDNA selective sweep.

both species. At Dll, H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene
(Figure 2B) are separated by 10 fixed differences (3% net
divergence) and share three polymorphisms. Similarly at
inv, H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene have ten fixed differences (4.6% net divergence) and two shared polymorphisms (Figure 2C). At w, one allele of H. m. melpomene
was shared with H. c. cordula (M6-1; Figure 2D), such that
there was only one fixed difference (2% net divergence)
and eight shared polymorphisms. Nonetheless, estimates
of FST between H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene were
high for all three loci (Dll, 0.621, inv, 0.593 and w, 0.327).
In contrast, H. heurippa did not have any fixed differences
with either H. c. cordula or H. m. melpomene at any of these
three loci. At Dll, H. heurippa was more similar to H. m.
melpomene (net divergence 0.41%) than H. c. cordula (net
divergence 2.28%). At the other two loci, H. heurippa was
more similar to H. cydno, with inv showing 0.56% and
2.76% divergence with H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene
respectively, while w showed 0.024% and 1% for the same
two comparisons. Estimates of FST supported these observations, with Dll showing H. heurippa not significantly differentiated from H. m. melpomene but strongly
differentiated from H. c. cordula (Table 3), while inv and w
showed the opposite pattern with H. heurippa more similar to H. c. cordula (Table 3).
In contrast with the patterns observed in the other five
loci, the sd locus showed no fixed differences among any
of the three species (Figure 2E). H. c. cordula and H. m.
melpomene had seven shared polymorphisms and net
divergence of 0.62%. H. heurippa shared 14 and ten polymorphisms with H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene respectively, representing net divergence of 0.10% and 0.5%.
Genetic diversity was generally high in all three species
(Table 2). Tajima's D was significantly negative in H. c.
cordula (Table 2). FST values showed that H. heurippa was
more similar to H. c. cordula than to H. m. melpomene
(Table 3).

Among the five nuclear loci, the sex-linked locus Tpi was
the only marker that clearly separated all three species. H.
c. cordula and H. m. melopomene alleles formed distinct
clades separated by five fixed differences and one shared
polymorphism, with 1.3% net divergence (Figure 2A). H.
heurippa alleles also formed a distinct cluster (Figure 2A)
separated by five fixed differences from H. m. melpomene
(1.3% net divergence) and by six from H. c. cordula (1.4%
net divergence). In concordance with the network groups,
FST values showed the species as three distinct populations, with H. heurippa showing greater differentiation
from H. c. cordula (FST = 0.791) and H. m. melpomene (FST
= 0.719) than that observed between H. c. cordula and H.
m. melopomene (FST = 0.498 P < 0.05; Table 3; Figure 2A).

Recombination analysis and IM input files
In order to select the 'basic' dataset required by the IM
software, indel-free alignments were investigated to search
for evidence of recombination for each species pair comparison [37]. In the H. cydno – H. melpomene comparison,
recombination was only detected at Dll with its maximum
significant breakpoint found between sequences C6-2 and
M5-2 (p = 0.007) between 16th and the 17th sites, as was
indicated using the maximum chi-square method. A
recombination free block of 206 bp was selected in the 5'
to 3' direction from the site of probable recombination
(Table 4).

Three of the autosomal loci, Dll, inv and w, show a striking
pattern in which H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene are
clearly differentiated, but H. heurippa shares variation with

In the H. cydno – H. heurippa comparison, inv had recombination (p = 0.015) with the most significant breakpoint
found between sequences H3-1 and C8-2 between 52nd

and 53rd sites. A non recombining block of 250 bp preceding the sites involved in the recombination was selected,
in the 5' to 3' direction (Table 4). In this comparison, sd
also showed significant recombination between
sequences H1-1 and H4-1 with the most significant breakpoint at the 16th and 17th sites (p = 0.0001). For this locus,
a 308 bp region (5' to 3') lacking recombination was
included in further analysis (Table 4). In the H. melpomene
– H. heurippa comparison, the only locus with recombination was inv in which, the exchange was between the
sequences H7-2 and M7-1, with the most significant
breakpoint between 12th and 13th sites (p = 0.005). A 125
bp 5' to 3' region after the sites involved in recombination
was selected for the IM analysis (Table 4).
History of divergence between H. melpomene and H.
cydno
Isolation-Migration model [38] was used to infer the population history of H. melpomene melpomene and H. cydno
cordula. The IM program uses a coalescent model to estimate effective population size, time since divergence, and
ongoing migration parameters from multilocus sequence
data sampled from two sister species. Here, H. cydno cordula was estimated to have a two-fold greater population
size compared to H. melpomene melpomene (Table 5). This
result is consistent with other studies involving different
H. cydno and H. melpomene geographical races [37,39].
The ancestral population size was 1.23 × 106 (0.76 × 1061.98 × 106) individuals and the speciation event probably
took place around 2 million years ago, similar to a previous estimate using a different dataset [37]. However,
because of the weak scalar estimation for this parameter,
this estimated time is a very approximate value (Table 5).

Two loci (mtDNA and w) showed evidence of gene flow.
In both cases it was asymmetric (Table 5). All remaining
genes had estimates asymptotically near to zero in both
directions (Table 5). The estimated migration rate from H.
c. cordula to H. m. melpomene (m1 = 1.32 × 10-6 per generation per locus) was high at mtDNA, as was expected from
the pattern of shared variation seen in the mtDNA tree.

Gene flow estimated in the other direction was nearly zero
(Table 5). The w locus had a 0.61 × 10-6 per generation per
locus migration rate in the same direction, a result that is
consistent with the presence of the M6-1 H. melpomene
haplotype in the H. cydno allele cluster.
Isolation-Migration model including H. heurippa
The IM model was then used to compare H. heurippa with
each of the parental taxa. The estimated H. heurippa population size was similar (0.27 – 0.30 × 106) in each comparison and smaller than those estimated for the other
species (Table 5). Unlike the comparison between H. m.
melpomene and H. c. cordula, both comparisons involving
H. heurippa failed to yield precise estimates of either the
ancestral population size or the divergence time. The likelihood surfaces obtained for these parameters were either
flat or rising over the parameter range investigated.

More importantly here, was the incidence of gene flow
observed at several loci between H. heurippa and the other
species, the only exceptions being mtDNA and Tpi, where
the migration rate was not significantly different to zero in
both directions (Table 5). At all other loci migration
parameters were significantly greater than zero in at least
one direction, with evidence for gene flow both from
parental species into H. heurippa and vice-versa (Table 5).

Discussion
Genealogical pattern and introgression
Heliconius heurippa was initially identified as a putative
hybrid species based on its intermediate colour pattern,
which shows a striking similarity to phenotypes produced
after just a few generations of hybridization between H. c.
cordula and H. m. melpomene [26]. The sequence data presented here provides independent evidence that hybridization has played an important, and ongoing, role in the
evolution of the H. heurippa genome. All four autosomal
loci showed a pattern in which H. heurippa shares similar
alleles with both H. m. melpomene and H. c. cordula. At
three of these loci (inv, w and sd), H. heurippa was most
closely related to H. c. cordula, while at the fourth (Dll) it

hybrid genome as has been demonstrated in other examples of hybrid speciation.
Gene flow between H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene
The comparison of H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene
under the IM model indicates ongoing introgressive
hybridization at two loci (Table 5). In particular, there are
very closely related mtDNA haplotypes shared between
the species (gene flow from H. c. cordula to H. m. melpomene, m1 = 1.32 × 10-6 per generation per locus; Figure
1) and asymmetric moderate gene flow in w (m1 = 0.61 ×
10-6 per generation per locus, gene flow from H. c. cordula
to H. m. melpomene and 0 in the other direction). These
species are known to hybridize in the wild and previously,
shared alleles have been observed at another autosomal
locus, Mpi for which a symmetrical migration rate of 1.54
×10-6 per generation per locus was estimated in Panamanian populations [37,40]. Furthermore, substantial
shared DNA sequence variation at 16 loci was observed in
H. cydno and H. melpomene from Costa Rica [39].

Notably, shared mtDNA variation between H. cydno and
H. melpomene in eastern Colombia (Figure 1) suggests
recent introgression. The shared mtDNA haplotypes may
have been retained as an ancient polymorphism since the
speciation of H. melpomene and H. cydno, but this seems
unlikely given the evolutionary distance between the species (1.5–2% divergence between the two mtDNA clades).
Female hybrid sterility following Haldane's rule [41]
would be expected to prevent introgression of mtDNA,
although limited fertility of female hybrids has been documented and would provide a route for infrequent introgression [41].

was closer to H. m. melpomene. Nonetheless, our analysis
suggests that the pattern of shared alleles between H. heurippa and its relatives is mainly due to introgression in the
fairly recent past. The results are consistent with historical
gene exchange playing an important role in the origin of
H. heurippa, but do not provide evidence for a 'mosaic'

The history of H. heurippa
Pairwise IM analyses of H. heurippa and either one of the
other taxa, suggest a small species population size (Table
5). The absence of consistent negative Tajima's D across
loci (Table 2) indicates a historically small constant size
instead of a short bottleneck. No reliable estimates for
divergence time and ancestral population size were
obtained in either comparison. Two loci mtDNA and Tpi
did not show gene flow for any pair evaluated that
involves H. heurippa. The remaining loci showed recent
gene interchange among H. heurippa and the two other
species. There is no hybrid sterility between H. cydno and
H. heurippa, and insectary mate choice experiments produce frequent matings in one direction (between H. heurippa males and H. cydno females). It seems likely that
there is a hybrid zone between these species somewhere in
the Andes between Villavicencio (Colombia) and San
Cristobal (Venezuela; Linares Pers. Obs.), which would
explain the observed levels of gene flow.

In the H. melpomene – H. heurippa species pair, inv (64)
and w (348.2) in particular showed high rates of gene flow
from H. melpomene to H. heurippa. These two species are
broadly sympatric, which might facilitate hybridization.
Nonetheless, although hybrid females are sterile in one
direction of cross, female offspring of backcrossed males
segregate for sterility which should allow some gene flow
[24].
In a broad sense, our Isolation-Migration analysis suggests
that different parts of the H. heurippa genome are subject
to very different levels of gene flow with the two sister
taxa. We also carried out linkage disequilibrium tests for
introgression [42], which should be sensitive to very
recent introgression events, but these were not significant
for any of the loci, suggesting that gene flow is sufficiently
ancient for linkage disequilibrium to have been lost.
There are a number of possible explanations for such
interlocus variation. One is that some of the loci
sequenced for this study are either themselves subject to
natural selection or else are linked to such regions. Selection does seem plausible as we know that there is a strong
correlation between the Tpi locus and hybrid sterility in
interracial H. melpomene, H. cydno x H. melpomene and H.
melpomene x H. heurippa crosses [24,41,43]. If Tpi were

associated with genes causing hybrid sterility, this might
explain the clear lack of gene flow among the three species
at this locus. This is also consistent with the fact that a disproportionate number of species differences, including
morphology, physiology, oviposition preference, mate
selection and pheromones, map to the Z chromosome in
other Lepidoptera species [44].
At the other extreme, sd shows far more allelic mixing
between species than the other loci studied. A similar pattern in the cydno-melpomene group races from Panama
and Costa Rica has been observed at other loci [37,39].
This has led to suggestion that balancing selection could
be maintaining diversity and perhaps promoting introgressive hybridization [37,39,40]. It is possible that this
process is occurring at the sd haplotypes obtained here.
There is currently no evidence for the role of sd, or any of
the other loci studied here playing a role in the evolution
of colour pattern, so it is unclear what the selection pressures on this locus might be.
In addition, analysis of protein coding sequence did not
provide any direct evidence for positive or balancing selection on any of the loci, although the power of this analysis
was limited by the fact that most of our sequence data is

for non-coding regions (analysis using CODEML, data not
shown, [45]). The genealogical pattern and IM analysis do
suggest that there is both ancestral variation and recent
gene flow at the sd locus (Table 5).
Overall, the species relationships are consistent with the
H. heurippa genome containing a greater contribution
from H. cydno than H. melpomene. The H. heurippa mtDNA
haplotypes fall within an H. cydno clade, and at three of
the five nuclear loci FST values show H. heurippa closer to
H. cydno (Table 3). This is consistent with what is known
about the three species. H. heurippa is a geographic
replacement of H. cydno that flies in similar habitats.
Where H. cydno flies sympatrically with H. melpomene, the
former is associated more with closed canopy forest and
tends to be found at higher altitudes [46], both characteristics also observed in H. heurippa populations in eastern
Colombia (Linares and Jiggins Pers. Obs.). Furthermore,
laboratory reconstruction of the H. heurippa colour pattern from H. c. cordula and H. m. melpomene involves backcrossing F1 male hybrids to H. cydno, with a
correspondingly greater contribution from the H. cydno
genome. Finally, patterns of hybrid sterility show that H.
heurippa is more compatible with H. cydno [24,26]. Nonetheless, the Tpi genealogy contrasts with this general pattern, in that H. heurippa is similarly differentiated from
both of the other species, suggesting a more contemporaneous divergence of all three species. This contrasts with
the other genetic and ecological evidence placing H. heurippa as a closer relative of H. cydno, and might indicate an
even more complex evolutionary history.
In summary, the data clearly imply that introgressive
hybridization has occurred between the three species, but
this does not distinguish between two alternative scenarios for the origin of H. heurippa. First, a branching speciation scenario with ongoing gene flow, and second a
hybrid founding speciation scenario. Thus, these data
alone cannot be taken as providing strong evidence in
support of hybrid speciation. Indeed, the observed pattern
of allelic variation contrasts markedly with the pattern
seen in hybrid Helianthus sunflowers [7,47]. The latter
species show genomes consisting of genetic "blocks"
derived from one or the other of the parental species.
These would be seen in our data as a clustering of the
hybrid species entirely within one or the other parental
species for each locus. However, this is not the general pattern seen in H. heurippa, where we observe allelic variation
shared with both parental species at several loci. Intuitively, the latter pattern seems more consistent with high
ongoing rates of introgression at many loci, and species
differences maintained by selection at the remaining loci.
This contrast is perhaps unsurprising given that the hybrid
sunflowers are largely allopatric to their progenitors,

while H. heurippa is still able to exchange genes with both
of its parental species.
Superficially, the data seems to support the hybrid speciation hypothesis, with FST analyses showing H. heurippa
more related to H. cydno at some loci and more related to
H. melpomene at others. This is the kind of pattern that has
been used previously to argue the case for hybrid speciation in other groups [2,48,49]. Furthermore, there are
clearly alleles in H. heurippa that could be considered diagnostic for one or other of the parental species at different
loci, similar to the 'private alleles' found in the 'Lonicera
fly' and 'alpine Lycaeides' that were apparently derived
from one or other putative parent [50,51]. Thus, our data
are similar in several aspects to previous examples that
have been proposed as good cases for hybrid speciation.
Nevertheless, we would argue that such evidence needs to
be combined with analysis of traits involved in causing
reproductive isolation in order to argue convincingly that
hybridization played a causative role in speciation.

Conclusion
Our results highlight the difficulty of clearly proving the
case for hybrid speciation. If hybrid speciation is important, it must often occur in taxa with significant rates of
introgressive hybridization, such that where shared variation is observed the alternative hypotheses of hybrid
founding versus introgressive hybridization need to be
rigorously tested. The evidence for the role of hybridization in the speciation of H. heurippa comes primarily from

crossing and mate choice experiments that have addressed
the origin of its colour pattern, and the role of that pattern
in reproductive isolation [26]. That colour pattern is controlled by a small number of genes of major effect, so the
hybrid speciation hypothesis does not make specific predictions regarding the rest of the genome. Here we have
clearly shown that H. heurippa does not have a hybrid
genome that is comparable to the sunflower Helianthus
anomalus, with blocks of genes derived from one or other
parent. Instead, the genome resembles that of other
groups of closely related taxa in which hybridization is frequent, such as Anopheles gambie [52,53] and the Drosophila
pseudoobscura group [38,42,54].
Discordant patterns are found at different markers such
that particular alleles cannot be considered 'diagnostic' of
a particular species. Thus, in this case hybrid speciation
has resulted from the origin of a novel trait with a key role
in speciation. Thus, in the case of H. heurippa, sequence
analysis of the genes controlling the different pattern elements will be needed to uncover the genealogical history
of the original speciation event.

code) for H. heurippa (n = 11), H. m. melpomene (n = 8)
and H. c. cordula (n = 9) from the eastern Colombian and
Venezuelan Andes (see additional file 1: Specimen collection list). Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CoI)/tRNALEU/
cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (CoII) region and the Zlinked locus, Triose-phosphate isomerase (Tpi), were
amplified and sequenced from individual genomic DNA
using PCR primers and conditions described previously
[40]. All nuclear gene products were cloned before
sequencing using pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega).
For each individual 3–5 clones were sequenced to identify
distinct alleles. Previously Distal-less (Dll) and invected
(inv) sequences obtained by CS [26,29] and the newest
white (w) and scalloped (sd) sequences were amplified
from individual genomic DNA using PCR primers and
conditions already described [30]. Sequences included in
the analysis were generally represented by at least two
identical clones. All loci sequences were deposited in GenBank
under
accessions
[DQ674383-DQ674451,
DQ445385-DQ445415 and DQ445416-DQ445457].
Phylogenetic analysis
Bayesian and parsimony phylogenetic trees were reconstructed as described previously for mtDNA data [40].
Recombination violates the assumption of a bifurcating
genealogy [54], so for nuclear loci we constructed haplotype networks that take into account the presence of persistent ancestral nodes, multifurcations and reticulation.
The presence of loops in these networks might reflect
recombination events [55]. Networks for nuclear loci were
constructed with statistical parsimony in TCS v 1.21 [56],
considering gaps as missing data and adjusting the parsimony limit to the respective data set.
Population genetic analysis
For each species, the per site population mutation rate
ΘW[57] with 95% confidence intervals was estimated with
DnaSP v4.10.3 [58]. Deviation from a neutral model, and
hence the effectiveness of ΘW in reflecting the effective
population size (Ne) was tested by estimating Tajima's D
[59]. Significant departure of Tajima's D from zero was
evaluated both assuming recombination and without
recombination. Both tests were carried out because presence of recombinant sites in the nuclear genes leads to a
loss of power to reject neutrality [60]. For between species
comparisons, the program SITES [61] was used to estimate net divergence between species [62] and the number
of shared polymorphisms and fixed differences. Genetic
differentiation between pairs of populations was measured using Wright's FST [63] adapted for DNA sequence
data [64,65] and estimated using DnaSP v4.10.3 [58]. Statistical significance was obtained by bootstrapping i.e.
randomly sampling with replacement the values of within
population diversity, πS, and the values of the between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/132

population divergence, πB, 10000 times and recalculating
FST for each replicate using SEQUENCER v6.1.0 [66].
In order to estimate the role of gene flow in shaping the
pattern of shared alleles between species, the IsolationMigration (IM) bayesian model was used [38]. This model
considers a scenario where a population gives rise to two
populations, after which there may be gene exchange
between the two new populations [38]. The program
relies on a metropolis-coupled Monte Carlo Markov chain
(MCMC) genealogical sampling for Bayesian estimation
of six major demographical parameters: recent population
sizes, ancestral population size, time at which the ancestral population bifurcated and two or more migration
rates according to whether gene flow is evaluated at the
population or gene level [38]. The genealogical coalescence parameter estimation follows the classical Kingman
theory in which recent alleles of two daughter populations will be traced to an ancestral pool in a Wright-Fisher
fashion [38]. In this context, the genetic processes of
mutation and drift occurs on a time scale of generations.
Because of this, the parameters must be scaled based on a
known mutation or drift rate.
We carried out analyses on three modified couplet datasets for each species pair: (i) H. melpomene-H. cydno (ii) H.
melpomene-H. heurippa and (iii) H. cydno-H. heurippa. For
the former comparison we expected that IM model fits
well to the data. However, in the couplet data sets involving H. heurippa, IM could overestimate the divergence
time and underestimate the migration rates between this
species and either parent species. This is a consequence of
the presence within H. heurippa of divergent alleles that
relate it with the species not included in the IM comparison. Nonetheless, the coalescence process in the IM simulations is able to recover information about the ancestry of
shared and divergent alleles between H. heurippa and any
of the other two species and provided an approximation
of the magnitude of gene flow.
Additionally, in concordance with the typical assumptions and limitations of the IM algorithm (i.e. no gap polymorphism, no recombination within loci), we looked
for regions in our sequences that met those conditions.
For each alignment, we obtained a dataset that was as
complete as possible after deleting highly polymorphic
indel regions. Over these data sets, evidence for recombination was evaluated by the Hudson four gamete test
implemented in SITES [67]. However, this test assumes an
infinite sites mutation model that is not realistic for our
data due to observation of repeated changes at the same
site under the HKY model [68]. Hence, recombination
was also tested using a model-neutral test based on a
bootstrapped correlation of linkage disequilibrium (R2)
with physical distance and with a maximum chi-square

test [69,70]. Both analyses were used to subsample the
indel-free files in order to remove clearly recombinant
regions by searching from the 5' region of each locus until
a probable recombinant pattern emerge [37]. The same
procedure was made from the 3' region. From 5' and 3'
analysis, we selected a maximum block without recombination [37]. Effective population size scalars were
assigned to each locus relative to autosomal inheritance.
Specifically, the values were set at 0.25 for CO, 0.75 for Tpi
and 1 for the other loci. Individual species population
sizes and ancestral population size (θ = 4Nμ), divergence
time, relative mutation rate μ and per locus directional
migration rates (m) were estimated with all loci. Demographic values were obtained through a molecular clock
scalar calibration to obtain parameters per base pair and
per generation, taking as reference Brower's 2.3% divergence in mtDNA per million years estimated for insects
[71] and with an assumption of four generations per year
(Table 4). Migration rates (m1 y m2) were allowed to vary
between loci and between species (i.e. asymmetrical gene
flow, option -j6). After search for parameter range using
preliminary runs, each pairwise comparison were run for
at least 30 million steps from a 200,000 burn-in period
under the HKY model [68] with 5 chains per set, with linear heating increment h of 0.033.
