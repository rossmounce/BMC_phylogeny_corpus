Abstract
IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®http://imgt.cines.fr, was created in
1989 by the Laboratoire d'ImmunoGénétique Moléculaire (LIGM) (Université Montpellier II and
CNRS) at Montpellier, France. IMGT is a high quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in
immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human
and other vertebrates, and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of any species which belong
to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and to the MHC superfamily (MhcSF). IMGT consists of
five databases, ten on-line tools and more than 8,000 HTML pages of Web resources. IMGT
provides a common access to standardized data from genome, genetics, proteome and threedimensional structures. The accuracy and the consistency of IMGT data are based on IMGTONTOLOGY, a semantic specification of terms to be used in immunogenetics and
immunoinformatics. IMGT-ONTOLOGY comprises six main concepts: IDENTIFICATION,
CLASSIFICATION, DESCRIPTION, NUMEROTATION, ORIENTATION and OBTENTION.
Based on these concepts, the controlled vocabulary and the annotation rules necessary for the
immunogenetics data identification, classification, description and numbering and for the
management of IMGT knowledge are defined in the IMGT Scientific chart. IMGT is the international
reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics for medical research (repertoire analysis of
the IG antibody sites and of the TR recognition sites in autoimmune and infectious diseases, AIDS,
leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas), veterinary research (IG and TR repertoires in farm and wild life
species), genome diversity and genome evolution studies of the adaptive immune responses,
biotechnology related to antibody engineering (single chain Fragment variable (scFv), phage
displays, combinatorial libraries, chimeric, humanized and human antibodies), diagnostics (detection
and follow up of residual diseases) and therapeutical approaches (grafts, immunotherapy,
vaccinology). IMGT is freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr.

Introduction
IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information
system®http://imgt.cines.fr[1,2], was created in 1989, by
Marie-Paule Lefranc, at the Laboratoire d'ImmunoGénétique Moléculaire (LIGM) (Université Montpellier II and
CNRS) at Montpellier, France, in order to standardize and
manage the complexity of the immunogenetics data. Fifteen years later, IMGT is the international reference in
immunogenetics and immunoinformatics, and provides a
high quality integrated knowledge resource, specialized in
the immunoglobulins (IG) and T cell receptors (TR),
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human and
other vertebrates, and related proteins of the immune systems (RPI) of any species which belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and to the MHC
superfamily (MhcSF)[3-13]. The number of potential protein forms of the antigen receptors, IG and TR, is almost
unlimited. The potential repertoire of each individual is
estimated to comprise about 1012 different IG (or antibodies) and TR, and the limiting factor is only the number
of B and T cells that an organism is genetically programmed to produce. This huge diversity is inherent to the
particularly complex and unique molecular synthesis and
genetics of the antigen receptor chains. This includes biological mechanisms such as DNA molecular rearrangements in multiple loci (three for IG and four for TR in
humans) located on different chromosomes (four in
humans), nucleotide deletions and insertions at the rearrangement junctions (or N-diversity), and somatic hypermutations in the IG loci (see FactsBooks[3,4] for review).
Although IMGT was initially implemented for the IG, TR
and MHC of human and other vertebrates [6], data and
knowledge management standardization, based on the
IMGT unique numbering [14-19], has now been extended
to the IgSF [15-17,20-22] and MhcSF [18,23,24] of any
species. Thus, standardization in IMGT contributed to
data enhancement of the system and new expertised data
concepts were readily incorporated.
IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information
system® consists of five databases, ten on-line tools and
Web resources [1,2]. Databases include sequence databases (IMGT/LIGM-DB, IMGT/PRIMER-DB and IMGT/
MHC-DB), one genome database (IMGT/GENE-DB) and
one three-dimensional (3D) structure database (IMGT/
3Dstructure-DB) [1,2] (Figure 1). Interactive tools are provided for sequence analysis (IMGT/V-QUEST, IMGT/JunctionAnalysis, IMGT/Allele-Align, IMGT/PhyloGene),
genome analysis (IMGT/LocusView, IMGT/GeneView,
IMGT/GeneSearch, IMGT/CloneSearch and IMGT/
GeneInfo) and 3D structure analysis (IMGT/StructuralQuery) [1,2] (Figure 1). Web resources ("IMGT MariePaule page") comprise more than 8,000 HTML pages of
synthesis [IMGT Repertoire (for IG and TR, MHC, RPI)],
knowledge [IMGT Scientific chart, IMGT Education

http://www.immunome-research.com/content/1/1/3

(IMGT Lexique, Aide-mémoire, Tutorials, Questions and
answers), IMGT Medical page, IMGT Veterinary page,
IMGT Biotechnology page, IMGT Index], and external
links [IMGT Immunoinformatics page, IMGT Bloc-notes
(Interesting links, etc.) and IMGT other accesses (SRS,
BLAST, etc.)] [2]. Despite the heterogeneity of these different components, all data in the IMGT information system
are expertly annotated. The accuracy, the consistency and
the integration of the IMGT data, as well as the coherence
between the different IMGT components (databases, tools
and Web resources) are based on IMGT-ONTOLOGY[5],
which provides a semantic specification of the terms to be
used in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. IMGTONTOLOGY, the first ontology in the domain, has
allowed the management of knowledge in immunogenetics [2,25] and provided standardization for immunogenetics data from genome, genetics, proteome and 3D
structures [3-13]. IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts are available, for the biologists and IMGT users, in the IMGT Scientific chart[2], and for the computing scientists, in IMGTML which uses XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
Schema [26].
IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts and IMGT Scientific chart
rules
The IMGT Scientific chart[2] comprises the controlled
vocabulary and the annotation rules necessary for the
immunogenetics data identification, description, classification and numbering and for knowledge management in
the IMGT information system. Standardized keywords,
labels and annotation rules, standardized IG and TR gene
nomenclature, the IMGT unique numbering, and standardized origin/methodology were defined, respectively,
based on the six main concepts of IMGT-ONTOLOGY:
IDENTIFICATION, CLASSIFICATION, DESCRIPTION,
NUMEROTATION, ORIENTATION and
OBTENTION[2,5] (Table 1). The IMGT Scientific chart is available as a section of the IMGT Web resources (IMGT MariePaule page). Examples of IMGT expertised data concepts
derived from the IMGT Scientific chart rules are shown in
Table 1.

The IMGT Scientific chart rules, based on the IMGTONTOLOGY concepts [5], are used in the three major
IMGT biological approaches, genomics, genetics and
structural approaches [2], and corresponding data (Genes,
Sequences, 3D structures) are available in the IMGT components (databases, tools and Web resources) [1,7-13].
IMGT sequence databases, tools and Web resources
IMGT sequence databases, tools and Web resources correspond to the IMGT genetics approach that refers to the
study of genes in relation with their polymorphisms,
mutations, expression, specificity and evolution (Table 2).

and structures are in green, yellow and blue, respectively. The IMGT Repertoire and other Web resources are not shown.
Interactions in the genetics, genomics and structural approaches are represented with dotted, continuous and broken lines,
respectively.

IMGT genetics approach heavily rely on the DESCRIPTION concept (and particularly on the V-REGION, DREGION, J-REGION and C-REGION core concepts for the
IG and TR), on the CLASSIFICATION concept (gene and
allele concepts) and on the NUMEROTATION concept
(IMGT unique numbering [14-18]).
IMGT sequence databases
IMGT/LIGM-DB
IMGT/LIGM-DB is the comprehensive IMGT database of
IG and TR nucleotide sequences from human and other
vertebrate species, with translation for fully annotated
sequences [7]. It was created in 1989 by LIGM (Montpellier, France), and is on the Web since July 1995 [6]. In
August 2005, IMGT/LIGM-DB contained more than

96,500 sequences of 150 vertebrate species [7]. The
unique source of data for IMGT/LIGM-DB is EMBL, which
shares data with the other two generalist databases GenBank and DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ). Based on
expert analysis, specific detailed annotations are added to
IMGT flat files. The annotation procedure includes the
IDENTIFICATION of the sequences, the CLASSIFICATION of the IG and TR genes and alleles, and the
DESCRIPTION of all IG and TR specific and constitutive
motifs within the nucleotide sequences. The Web interface allows searches according to immunogenetic specific
criteria and is easy to use without any knowledge in a
computing language. Selection is displayed at the top of
the resulting sequences pages, so the users can check their
own queries. Users have the possibility to modify their

from IMGT/LIGM-DB, but also from other IMGT databases. Thus, the IMGT/LIGM-DB accession numbers of
the cDNA expressed sequences for each human and
mouse IG and TR gene are available, with direct links to
IMGT/LIGM-DB, in the IMGT/GENE-DB entries. IMGT/
LIGM-DB data are also distributed by anonymous FTP
servers at CINES ftp://ftp.cines.fr/IMGT/ and EBI ftp://
ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/imgt/ and from many
Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) sites http://imgt.cines.fr/
textes/IMGTotheraccesses.html. IMGT/LIGM-DB can be
searched by BLAST or FASTA on different servers (EBI,
IGH, INFOBIOGEN, Institut Pasteur, etc.).

IMGT/PRIMER-DB
IMGT/PRIMER-DB[1] is the IMGT oligonucleotide primer
database for IG and TR, created by LIGM, Montpellier in
collaboration with EUROGENTEC S.A., Belgium, on the
Web since February 2002. In August 2005, IMGT/
PRIMER-DB contained 1,827 entries. IMGT/PRIMER-DB
provides standardized information on oligonucleotides
(or Primers) and combinations of primers (Sets, Couples)
for IG and TR. These primers are useful for combinatorial
library constructions, scFv, phage display or microarray
technologies. The IMGT Primer cards are linked to the
IMGT/LIGM-DB flat files, IMGT Colliers de Perles and
IMGT Alignments of alleles (IMGT Repertoire) of the
IMGT/LIGM-DB reference sequence used for the primer

IMGTindex/imgtfocus.html, in IMGT Index (see also [2]).

IMGT/MHC-DB
IMGT/MHC-DB[28] comprises databases hosted at EBI
and includes a database of human MHC allele sequences
or IMGT/MHC-HLA, developed by Cancer Research UK
and maintained by ANRI, London, UK, on the Web since
December 1998, and a database of MHC sequences from
non human primates IMGT/MHC-NHP, curated by BPRC,
The Netherlands, on the Web since April 2002.
IMGT sequence analysis tools
The IMGT sequence analysis tools comprise IMGT/VQUEST[10], for the identification of the V, D and J genes
and of their mutations, IMGT/JunctionAnalysis[11] for
the analysis of the V-J and V-D-J junctions which confer
the antigen receptor specificity, IMGT/Allele-Align for the
detection of polymorphisms, and IMGT/PhyloGene[12]
for gene evolution analyses.
IMGT/V-QUEST
IMGT/V-QUEST (V-QUEry and STandardization) is an
integrated software for IG and TR [10]. This tool, easy to
use, analyses an input IG or TR germline or rearranged
variable nucleotide sequence. The IMGT/V-QUEST results
comprise the identification of the V, D and J genes and
alleles and the nucleotide alignments by comparison with
sequences from the IMGT reference directory, the FRIMGT and CDR-IMGT delimitations based on the IMGT
unique numbering, the translation of the input sequence,
the display of nucleotide and amino acid mutations compared to the closest IMGT reference sequence, the identification of the JUNCTION and results from IMGT/
JunctionAnalysis (default option), and the two-dimensional (2D) IMGT Collier de Perles representation of the
V-REGION [10] ("IMGT/V-QUEST output" in IMGT/VQUEST Documentation).

IMGT/JunctionAnalysis
IMGT/JunctionAnalysis[11] is a tool, complementary to
IMGT/V-QUEST, which provides a thorough analysis of
the V-J and V-D-J junction of IG and TR rearranged genes.
IMGT/JunctionAnalysis identifies the D-GENEs and alleles involved in the IGH, TRB and TRD V-D-J rearrangements by comparison with the IMGT reference directory,
and delimits precisely the P, N and D regions [11]
("IMGT/JunctionAnalysis output results" in IMGT/JunctionAnalysis Documentation). Several hundreds of junction sequences can be analysed simultaneously.
IMGT/Allele-Align
IMGT/Allele-Align is used for the detection of polymorphisms. It allows the comparison of two alleles highlighting the nucleotide and amino acid differences.
IMGT/PhyloGene
IMGT/PhyloGene[12] is an easy to use tool for phylogenetic analysis of variable region (V-REGION) and constant domain (C-DOMAIN) sequences. This tool is
particularly useful in developmental and comparative
immunology. The users can analyse their own sequences
by comparing with the IMGT standardized reference
sequences for human and mouse IG and TR [12] (IMGT/
PhyloGene Documentation).
IMGT sequence Web resources
The IMGT sequence Web resources are compiled in the
IMGT Repertoire "Proteins and alleles" section that
include Alignments of alleles, Proteins displays, Tables of
alleles, Allotypes, Isotypes, etc. (Table 2). Standardized
IMGT criteria for amino acid sequence analysis are
described in [31].

IMGT gene databases, tools and Web resources
IMGT gene databases, tools and Web resources correspond to the IMGT genomics approach that refers to the
studies of the genes within their loci and on their chromosome [2] (Table 3).
IMGT/GENE-DB, the IMGT gene database
Genomic data are managed in IMGT/GENE-DB, which is
the comprehensive IMGT genome database [8]. IMGT/
GENE-DB, created by LIGM (Montpellier, France) is on
the Web since January 2003. In August 2005, IMGT/
GENE-DB contained 1,377 genes and 2,207 alleles (673
IG and TR genes and 1,209 alleles from Homo sapiens,
and 704 IG and TR genes and 998 alleles from Mus musculus, Mus cookii, Mus pahari, Mus spretus, Mus saxicola,
Mus minutoïdes). All the human and mouse IG and TR
genes are available in IMGT/GENE-DB. Based on the
IMGT CLASSIFICATION concept, all the human IMGT
gene names [3,4] were approved by the Human Genome
Organisation (HUGO) Nomenclature Committee HGNC
in 1999 [27], and entered in IMGT/GENE-DB [8],
Genome DataBase GDB (Canada) [32], LocusLink and
Entrez Gene at NCBI (USA) [33], and GeneCards [34].
Reciprocal links exist between IMGT/GENE-DB, and the
generalist nomenclature (HGNC Genew) and genome
databases (GDB, LocusLink and Entrez at NCBI, and
GeneCards). All the mouse IG and TR gene names with
IMGT reference sequences were provided by IMGT to
HGNC and to the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) [35]
in July 2002. Queries in IMGT/GENE-DB can be performed according to IG and TR gene classification criteria
and IMGT reference sequences have been defined for each
allele of each gene based on one or, whenever possible,
several of the following criteria: germline sequence, first
sequence published, longest sequence, mapped sequence
[2]. IMGT/GENE-DB interacts dynamically with IMGT/
LIGM-DB [7] to download and display gene-related
sequence data. As an example ans as mentioned earlier,
the IMGT/GENE-DB entries provide the IMGT/LIGM-DB
accession numbers of the IG and TR cDNA sequences
which contain a given V, D, J or C gene. This is the first
example of an interaction between IMGT databases using
the CLASSIFICATION concept.

IMGT gene analysis tools
The IMGT gene analysis tools comprise IMGT/LocusView,
IMGT/GeneView, IMGT/GeneSearch, IMGT/CloneSearch
and IMGT/GeneInfo. IMGT/LocusView and IMGT/
GeneView manage the locus organization and the gene
location and provide the display of physical maps for the
human IG, TR and MHC loci and for the mouse TRA/TRD
locus. IMGT/LocusView allows to view genes in a locus
and to zoom on a given area. IMGT/GeneView allows to
view a given gene in a locus. IMGT/GeneSearch allows to
search for genes in a locus based on IMGT gene names,
functionality or localization on the chromosome. IMGT/
CloneSearch provides information on the clones that
were used to build the locus contigs displayed in IMGT/
LocusView (accession numbers are from IMGT/LIGM-DB,
gene names from IMGT/GENE-DB, and clone position
and orientation, and overlapping clones from IMGT/
LocusView). IMGT/GeneInfo[13] provides and displays
information on the potential TR rearrangements in
human and mouse.
IMGT gene Web resources
The IMGT gene Web resources are compiled in the IMGT
Repertoire "Locus and genes" section that includes Chromosomal localizations, Locus representations, Locus
description, Gene exon/intron organization, Gene exon/
intron splicing sites, Gene tables, Potential germline repertoires, the complete lists of human and mouse IG and
TR genes, and the correspondences between nomenclatures [3,4] (Table 3). The IMGT Repertoire "Probes and
RFLP" section provides additional data on gene insertion/
deletion.
IMGT structure database, tool and Web resources
The IMGT structural approach refers to the study of the 2D
and 3D structures of the IG, TR, MHC and RPI, and to the
antigen or ligand binding characteristics in relation with
the protein functions, polymorphisms and evolution
(Table 4). The structural approach relies on the CLASSIFICATION concept (IMGT gene and allele names),
DESCRIPTION concept (receptor and chain description,
domain delimitations), and NUMEROTATION concept

IMGT Collier de Perles of a C-DOMAIN is based on the IMGT unique numbering for C-DOMAIN and C-LIKE-DOMAIN [17].
Amino acids are shown in the one-letter abbreviation. Arrows indicate the direction of the beta strands that form the two beta
sheets of the immunoglobulin fold [3, 4]. Hatched circles correspond to missing positions according to the IMGT unique numbering [16, 17]. In the IMGT Collier de Perles on the IMGT Web site http://imgt.cines.fr hydrophobic amino acids (hydropathy
index with positive value) and Tryptophan (W) found at a given position in more than 50 % of analysed IG and TR sequences
are shown in blue, and all Proline (P) are shown in yellow.

(amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique
numbering [14-18]).
Structural and functional domains of the IG and TR chains
comprise the variable domain or V-DOMAIN (9-strand
beta-sandwich) which corresponds to the V-J-REGION or
V-D-J-REGION and is encoded by two or three genes
[3,4], the constant domain or C-DOMAIN (7-strand betasandwich), and, for the MHC chains, the groove domain
or G-DOMAIN (4 beta-strand and one alpha-helix). A
uniform numbering system for IG and TR V-DOMAINs of
all vertebrate species has been established to facilitate
sequence comparison and cross-referencing between
experiments from different laboratories whatever the antigen receptor (IG or TR), the chain type, or the species [1416]. In the IMGT unique numbering, conserved amino
acids from frameworks always have the same number
whatever the IG or TR variable sequence, and whatever the
species they come from. As examples: Cysteine 23 (in FR1IMGT), Tryptophan 41 (in FR2-IMGT), hydrophobic
amino acid 89 and Cysteine 104 (in FR3-IMGT) (Figure
2). This numbering has been applied with success to all
the sequences belonging to the V-set of the IgSF [20],
including non-rearranging sequences in vertebrates
(human CD4, Xenopus CTXg1, etc.) and in invertebrates
(drosophila amalgam, drosophila fasciclin II, etc.)
[15,16,21]. The IMGT unique numbering, initially
defined for the V-DOMAINs of the IG and TR and for the
V-LIKE-DOMAINs of IgSF proteins other than IG and TR,
has been extended to the C-DOMAINs of the IG and TR
(Figure 2B), and to the C-LIKE-DOMAINs of IgSF proteins
other than IG and TR [17]. An IMGT unique numbering
has also been implemented for the groove domain (GDOMAIN) of the MHC class I and II chains (Figure 3), and
for the G-LIKE-DOMAINs of MhcSF proteins other than
MHC [18].
IMGT/3Dstructure-DB, the IMGT 3D structure database
IMGT/3Dstructure-DB is the IMGT 3D structure database,
created by LIGM, and on the Web since November 2001
[9]. In August 2005, IMGT/3Dstructure-DB contained 946
atomic coordinate files. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB comprises
IG, TR, MHC and RPI with known 3D structures [9,36,37].
Coordinate files extracted from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) [38] are renumbered according to the standardized
IMGT unique numbering [16-18]. The IMGT/3DstructureDB card provides, on-line, the complete information for
each IMGT/3Dstructure-DB entry. The IMGT/3DstructureDB card shows a summary table and a menu that gives
access to five sections: "Chain details", "Contact analysis",
"Visualization with Jmol", "Renumbered file" and "References and links". The "Chain details" section provides
chain description, IMGT gene and allele names, IMGT
chain and domain labels, domain delimitations, amino
acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering,

IMGT Colliers de Perles [16-19]. The "Contact analysis"
section provides contact types and categories between
domains (in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB Domain contacts)
and atom contacts at the residue and position level (in
IMGT/3Dstructure-DB Residue@Position contacts) [37].
(IMGT/3Dstructure-DB Documentation). The "Renumbered file" section downloadable provides renumbered
IMGT/3Dstructure-DB flat files.
IMGT/StructuralQuery tool
The IMGT/StructuralQuery tool [9] analyses the interactions of the residues of the antigen receptors IG and TR,
MHC, RPI, antigens and ligands. The contacts are
described per domain (intra- and inter-domain contacts)
and annotated in term of IMGT labels (chains, domain),
positions (IMGT unique numbering), backbone or sidechain implication [37]. IMGT/StructuralQuery allows to
retrieve the IMGT/3Dstructure-DB entries, based on specific structural characteristics: phi and psi angles, accessible surface area (ASA), amino acid type, distance in
angstrom between amino acids, CDR-IMGT lengths.
IMGT structure Web resources
The IMGT stucture Web resources are compiled in the
IMGT Repertoire "2D and 3D structures" section which
includes 2D representations or IMGT Colliers de Perles
[16-19], 3D representations, FR-IMGT and CDR-IMGT
lengths [16], amino acid chemical characteristics profiles
[31], etc. In order to appropriately analyse the amino acid
resemblances and differences between IG, TR, MHC and
RPI chains, eleven IMGT classes were defined for the
'chemical characteristics' amino acid properties and used
to set up IMGT Colliers de Perles reference profiles [31].
The IMGT Colliers de Perles reference profiles allow to
easily compare amino acid properties at each position
whatever the domain, the chain, the receptor or the species. The IG and TR variable and constant domains represent a privileged situation for the analysis of amino acid
properties in relation with 3D structures, by the conservation of their 3D structure despite divergent amino acid
sequences, and by the considerable amount of genomic
(IMGT Repertoire), structural (IMGT/3Dstructure-DB)
and functional data available. These data are not only useful to study mutations and allele polymorphisms, but are
also needed to establish correlations between amino acids
in the protein sequences and 3D structures and to determine amino acids potentially involved in the immunogenicity.

Conclusion
In order to allow any IMGT component to be automatically queried and to achieve a higher level of interoperability inside the IMGT information system and with other
information systems, our current objectives include the
modelling of the three major IMGT biological

http://www.immunome-research.com/content/1/1/3

approaches,
genomics,
genetics
and
structural
approaches, the analysis of the IMGT components (databases, tools and Web resources) in relation with the concepts, and the development of Web services http://
www.w3.org/2002/ws/[2]. They are the first steps towards
the implementation of IMGT-Choreography [2], which
corresponds to the process of complex immunogenetics
knowledge [25] and to the connection of treatments performed by the IMGT component Web services. IMGTChoreography has for goal to combine and join the IMGT
database queries and analysis tools. In order to keep only
significant approaches, a rigorous analysis of the scientific
standards [3,4], of the biologist requests and of the clinician needs [39-42] has been undertaken in the three main
biological approaches: genomics, genetics and structural
approaches. The design of IMGT-Choreography and the
creation of dynamic interactions between the IMGT databases and tools, using the Web services and IMGT-ML,
represent novel and major developments of IMGT, the
international reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. IMGT-Choreography enhances the
dynamic interactions between the IMGT components to
answer complex biological and clinical requests.
Since July 1995, IMGT has been available on the Web at
http://imgt.cines.fr. IMGT has an exceptional response
with more than 140,000 requests a month. The information is of much value to clinicians and biological scientists
in general. IMGT databases, tools and Web resources are
extensively queried and used by scientists from both academic and industrial laboratories, from very diverse
research domains: (i) fundamental and medical research
(repertoire analysis of the IG antibody sites and of the TR
recognition sites in normal and pathological situations
such as autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, AIDS,
leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas), (ii) veterinary
research (IG and TR repertoires in farm and wild life species), (iii) genome diversity and genome evolution studies
of the adaptive immune responses, (iv) structural evolution of the IgSF and MhcSF proteins, (v) biotechnology
related to antibody engineering (single chain Fragment
variable (scFv), phage displays, combinatorial libraries,
chimeric, humanized and human antibodies), (vi) diagnostics (clonalities, detection and follow up of residual
diseases) and (vii) therapeutical approaches (grafts,
immunotherapy, vaccinology).
