Abstract
Background: Species within the Flavivirus genus pose public health problems around the world.
Increasing cases of Dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus in Asia, frequent outbreaks of Yellow
fever virus in Africa and South America, and the ongoing spread of West Nile virus throughout the
Americas, show the geographical burden of flavivirus diseases. Flavivirus infections are often
indistinct from and confused with other febrile illnesses. Here we review the specificity of published
primers, and describe a new universal primer pair that can detect a wide range of flaviviruses,
including viruses from each of the recognised subgroups.
Results: Bioinformatic analysis of 257 published full-length Flavivirus genomes revealed conserved
regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers, Flav100F and Flav200R were
designed from these regions and used to generate an 800 base pair cDNA product. The region
amplified encoded part of the methyltransferase and most of the RNA-dependent-RNApolymerase (NS5) coding sequence. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful using standard
conditions with RNA from over 60 different flavivirus strains representing about 50 species. The
cDNA from each virus isolate was sequenced then used in phylogenetic analyses and database
searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA.
Conclusion: Comprehensive testing has revealed the broad specificity of these primers. We
briefly discuss the advantages and uses of these universal primers.

Introduction
Most current molecular assays for flaviviruses use highly
specific primers, which may only amplify from one species, or a range of closely related species [1-4]. In a clinical
or quarantine setting the presentation and potential exposures, including relevant travel history, are required to

generate a differential diagnosis which is required before
testing with specific primers. There is a real need to
develop broad range PCR assays that can detect all flaviviruses. Kuno [5] reviewed this subject and compared several diagnostic protocols. His recommendation was a two
stage process: initially utilizing broad range group-reacPage 1 of 10

tive primers to narrow the range of targets, followed by
species-specific primers [5].
Many attempts to develop a systematic means for identifying flaviviruses have been made, including serology and
non-serology based tests [6-8]. Due to the increased geographic distribution and severity of disease caused by
members of the Flavivirus genus, this need is becoming
more pressing [9].
The first report of a reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)
for the detection of multiple species was published in
1990, with the use of species-specific probes targeting the
nucleocapsid and envelope coding regions from four different Dengue virus genomes [1]. Tanaka [3] published
the first universal primer pair specific for mosquito borne
flaviviruses in 1993; the YF1 and YF3 primers targeted the
NS5/3'UTR of the genome and were based upon the six
flavivirus sequences available at the time. Concurrently
Fulop [2] designed a degenerate primer pair targeting conserved sites in the NS5 gene. These primers were successfully tested on thirteen different viruses including those in
the tick-borne group and flaviviruses with no known vectors. Pierre [4] redesigned the YF 1 and YF3 primer pair
previously developed by Tanaka, incorporating redundant
bases to expand the range of viruses amplified. The primers EMF1 and VD8 are unable to detect tick borne viruses
because they lack the EMF1 motif [4]. In 2005 Gaunt and
Gould designed a universal nested PCR, using six primers
targeting the E gene, capable of amplifying cDNA from 60
flavivirus strains. The amplification of cDNA was followed by restriction enzyme digestion to identify a range
of virus species [7].
The idea of designing primer sets relevant for diseases
found in specific geographic regions has also been investigated by several groups. Meiyu [10] developed the DJS
and DJA primer set targeting the NS1 gene; these were
used in China to detect Dengue virus (DENV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Similarly the primers
designed by Tanaka (YF1 and YF3 [3] were used to detect
flaviviruses in Brazil. However this primer pair failed to
amplify Bussuquara virus (BSQV), a virus native to Brazil
[11].
Flavivirus detection and taxonomy has recently become
more difficult with the determination of the nucleotide
sequence of Tamana bat virus (TABV), and Cell fusing
agent virus (CFAV) [12-14], and the discovery of Kamiti
River virus (KRV). These viruses are currently classified as
tentative members of the Flavivirus genus [15], even
though phylogenetic analysis indicates they are a distant
sister group to the other recognised flaviviruses [16]. They
pose a problem for detection using PCR since primers
depend on sequence conservation. Gaunt and Gould [7]

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/16

addressed this problem by using a nested PCR and
increasing the degeneracy of primers, and demonstrated
primers, with more than 200,000 different combinations
in solution, were capable of detecting TABV.
In the present study, we identified conserved sites and
developed a universal, non-nested primer pair that amplifies cDNA from each of the major subgroups of flaviviruses, and also TABV, under standard reaction conditions.
The region of the NS5 gene amplified contained sufficient
variability to allow differentiation of individual viruses.
We discuss the advantages of this approach, over the
known detection regimes for flaviviruses.

Results
No potentially useful conserved sites were identified in
the first complete alignment, utilising all available
sequences. However, the sequences of TABV, CFAV and
KRV were identified as a divergent cluster, and once
removed several conserved sites were found. The Flav100F
and Flav200R primers were designed to complement sites
in the NS5 gene that begin at residues 8276 and 9062 relative to the YFV genome (NC_002031). The conserved
sites encoded amino acid sequences starting at residues
2720 and 2982 in the YFV polyprotein (NP_041726),
which do not correspond to any known conserved sites in
flavivirus genomes. The primers have relatively low levels
of degeneracy, with 8 and 12 different permutations
respectively, discounting inosine positions, or with 512
and 48 permutations when inosines are counted as equivalent to four base degeneracy. To compensate for the
primer multiplicity, a slightly higher primer concentration
(50 pmole per 50 uL reaction) was used in the PCR.
A cDNA product approximately 800 base pairs long was
amplified from the RNA of each of the 65 viruses tested
(Figure 1). As expected there was variation in product size
for some viruses, but products of the correct size were
identified for every virus. The sizes estimated after gel electrophoresis corresponded closely with predicted size
based on published sequences. When analysed by gel electrophoresis the cDNA products displayed bands of varying intensities at ~800 bp, although for some flaviviruses,
products of multiple sizes were visible. Each reaction contained 6 µL of RNA as template, thus the intensity of the
product varied, presumably due to template concentration.
All amplified products were sequenced and, on average,
sequences from three reactions were used to traverse each
cDNA in both directions. Full length sequence was
obtained for 55 viruses, and truncated sequence was
obtained for DENV2 (771 bp), UGSV (742 bp), BSQV
(700 bp), MVEV (684 bp), USUV (675 bp), TYUV (620
bp), TABV (500 bp), YOKV (380 bp). cDNA products of

the expected size were obtained from AROAV, BAGV,
BOUV and LGTV although reliable sequence data was
unavailable; thus these viruses have been excluded from
this phylogenetic analysis.
Each product yielded sequence from a flavivirus NS5 gene
as shown by BLASTN searches. Flavivirus NS5 sequences

occupied the top places in every BLASTN output. The
majority of the sequences from the cDNAs differed by 5 to
50 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the closest
sequence with the same name in GenBank. Some viruses
amplified had no relevant sequence data available on
GenBank, the identities of these viruses were further tested
by phylogenetic analysis.

The primers were tested on, and amplified cDNA from, 24
of the 27 virus species listed in the mosquito-borne group,
10 of the 12 virus species in the tick-borne group and 13
of 14 viruses in the no known vector group [15]. In total
all of the 47 species tested were amplified, seven flavivirus
species have not been tested with these primers. cDNA
was also amplified from TABV, which was surprising as
the available TABV sequences, and those of its closest relatives (CFAV, KRV), were removed from the alignments
before the conserved sites were identified. The TABV
sequences matched the Flav100F sequence at 18 out of 22

positions and none of the mismatches were located
within the last 10 bases of the 3' end of the primer Figure
2. The TABV sequences matched the Flav200R sequence at
10 out of 17 positions and mismatches were located at the
3' end of the primer Figure 2.
Despite this amplification involving mismatching with
Tamana bat virus RNA, no cDNA was amplified from the
alphaviruses Barmah Forest virus, Ross River virus or the
nine respiratory viruses tested: Influenza A virus, Human
coronavirus NL, Human coronavirus OC43, Human ade-

(data not shown).
Phylogenetic trees found using the sequences largely
agreed with previously published trees [8,17,18] in that
the main subgroups were partitioned and the main
known associations between species were found.
Sequences from the cDNAs were paired with sequences
recognized by the ICTV or reference sequences from GenBank (Figure 3). The LIV cDNA sequence was the only
exception, in that it appeared closer to the NEGV cDNA
sequence rather than the LIV reference sequence; the LIV
reference sequence was the next closest sequence to the
LIV and NEGV cDNA sequences. The relationship
between LIV and NEGV has previously been determined,
thus it is unsurprising these viruses are more closely
related to each other than to the reference sequence [19].
All of the reference-cDNA sister groupings in the trees
were supported in all bootstrap resamples (100/100);
some internal branches closer to the root were also well
supported but others were poorly supported. The position
of the SLEV sequence appeared to be anomalous, as it
clustered with the members of the JEV serogroup rather
than ROCV, as previously shown [8]. Phylogenetic analysis of the JEV serogroup shows SLEV to be closely related
to members of this serogroup [17,18]. Recent phylogenetic studies using the E-NS1-NS3-NS5 sequence for
ROCV and other members of the JEV serogroup shows
SLEV to be closer to other members of the JEV serogroup
than the ROCV [18,20]. The construction of phylogenetic
trees based on shorter sequences, or different regions of
the genome leads to different relationships between the
viruses in particular the positions of SLEV relative the JEV
serogroup and ROCV [8,17,20,21]

We have described a novel primer set capable of amplifying 800 bp from the NS5 genes from almost every recognised member of the genus Flavivirus. Since the amplified
products represent 8% of the genome, this is sufficient
sequence to determine the species of the virus and thus
potentially to identify unrecognised flaviviruses. One
major problem with degenerate primers is that the concentration of some permutations in the mixture is so
small, due to their great multiplicity, that amplification is
effectively inhibited. For any given viral RNA target only a
proportion of the primer may participate in the initiation
of high efficiency extension in the early rounds of PCR.
We believe that the redundancy of the Flav100F and
Flav200R was insufficient to cause this problem [22].
Traditional serological methods based on neutralisation
and fixed cell ELISA have proven effective for identifying
flaviviruses and indeed classifying them [23]. However,
some were not classified using this technology due to dif-

ficulties in interpreting antigenic cross reactivity or failure
to identify relatively close antigenic relationships that
depend on epitopes encoded by regions of the genome
that do not reflect the serological tests. Moreover, serology
is time consuming, requires highly experienced personnel
and is less precise than nucleotide sequence determination. Using molecular methods, it is now possible to analyse archival material and confirm the identification of
tentatively identified flaviviruses. Previous attempts to
analyse the entire genus using PCR, have required multiple sets of primers. The capacity of the Flav100R and
Flav200R primers potentially to amplify all flaviviruses
makes them an invaluable diagnostic and taxonomic tool
for virology.
Gaunt and Gould, developed primers targeting the E gene
[7]. These primers did not amplify some species including, CIV, CRV, DBV, MMLV, PPBV and TABV [7]. These
viruses were all successfully amplified using the Flav100F/
Flav200R primers.
Primers targeting the NS3 gene have been developed and
tested on a number of viruses including KUNV, JEV and
YFV [24]. Bioinformatic analysis using sequence data
available at the time, predicted that these primers would
be unlikely to amplify products from TBEV thus reducing
their usefulness for a genome-wide study [24].
The FU1 and cFD3 primers were tested on a large number
of viruses; although six, covering the mosquito-borne
KOKV and SOKV, tick borne (KSIV) and no known vector
viruses RBV and SVV, were unable to be reproducibly
amplified using these primers. These viruses are highly
divergent within the three major subgroups currently recognised in this genus [8,15]. The Flav100F/Flav200R
primers amplified an 800 bp product from each of these
viruses. The NS5 gene has two distinct regions, a methyltransferase and a polymerase [25]. We have targeted
regions within two of the more highly conserved functional domains encoded by the flavivirus genome
The primers designed in the present work have been
widely tested, but there are six recognised viruses not
included in the analysis; the BSL4 viruses, Kyasanur Forest
disease virus and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, the BSL3
viruses Kedougou virus, San Perlita virus and Yaounde
virus and the tentative members of the genus, CFAV and
KRV. The primers amplified products from all tested flaviviruses. The ability of these primers to amplify previously
'unidentified' members of the Flavivirus genus may demonstrate their capacity to define novel species. The protocol is robust and tolerates a range of template
concentrations (greater than five orders of magnitude),
primer concentrations, and PCR-cycle conditions (data
not shown). The capacity of this reaction to amplify all fla-

viviruses tested provides a potential tool capable of rapidly identifying endemic and exotic viruses, in a timely,
cost effective manner, thus facilitating an appropriate
response to epidemic outbreak, or surveys that may result
in the discovery of new or novel flaviviruses. These primers also provide researchers with a tool to re-analyse
archived samples that may no longer be infectious.
In recent years viruses have been isolated from regions
outside their known geographic distribution. JEV was isolated in Australia for the first time in 1995. Until this time
the closest location to report human JEV cases was Bali.
The 1999 outbreak of WNV in New York reinforces the
importance of accurate and rapid diagnosis of exotic viral
agents, as the virus was originally mis-diagnosed in serological tests.
Flaviviruses are emerging in new geographic regions as
potential epidemic pathogens. Thus, the importance of an
accurate, rapid and reliable method for virus identification is becoming increasingly important. A major expansion of arbovirus surveillance and reporting systems has
been implemented inNorth America following the
appearance of WNV. For example, ArboNet reports surveillance data from humans, mosquitoes, birds, mammals and sentinel chicken flocks and the dataare
integrated into a single reporting system [26]. Broad spectrum molecular tests such as that described in thispaper
could make a significant contribution to such programmes.

Conclusion
The changing global epidemiological environment is
characterized by incursions of human populations into
new environments, increasing overlap of the range of disease vectors with human habitation and concomitant
exposure to a wider range of infectious agents [27]. Not
only are humans changing land usage patterns and entering new disease environments [28], but rapid transportation of disease agents is constantly increasing between
continents. Outbreaks of emerging zoonoses, for example
WNV in North America, and the threat of bio-terrorism
with novel infectious agents, are no longer remote threats.
The Flav100F and Flav200R primers have the potential to
detect emerging, related flaviviruses without prior serological evidence or additional primer design. Our
approach should help reduce the confirmation time for
viral infections. Rapid detection at the genus level would
enable informed policy measures to be implemented and
this, in turn, may help disease management.

Methods
Primers were designed using a strategy similar to that used
by Vercruysse et al [29]. All available full-length flavivirus

sequences were retrieved from NCBI in March 2005.
Sequences were sorted using Bioedit [30,31] and aligned
using ClustalX [32]. Several divergent sequences were
identified by examining neighbour joining trees found
using ClustalX and removed from the alignment. Conserved regions were identified by calculating redundancy
scores [33], and the average dominant base counts using
an early version of the NCSF program and a window
length of 20 bases [34]unpublished software, 2005; P.
Wayper and M.J. Gibbs]. Average dominant base counts
were calculated by summing the number of occurrences of
the most common base at each position in the window
and averaging those counts across all positions in the window. The distance between conserved regions was taken
into account when selecting conserved sites as was the
potential for using mixed bases or deoxyinosines, to
enhance bonding at variable positions [35]. Standard
nucleotides were favoured close to the 3' termini of the
oligonucleotides. The primer sequences and their positions relative to the genome of Yellow fever virus
(NC_002031) are shown in Table 1. Primers were synthesised by Geneworks (Hindmarsh SA, Australia). The primers target the end of the region encoding the
methyltransferase and the start of the region encoding the
RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase in the flavivirus NS5
gene.
Virus stocks produced in the molecular virology laboratory at the University of Queensland, Australia were prepared from the supernatant medium of infected PS-EK cell
cultures (Table 2). PS-EK cells were grown in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle Medium with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum
(Gibco, Carlsbad, California), 50U/mL Penicillin and 50
µg/mL Streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California).
To remove cellular debris, the supernatant medium was
centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. To increase the
concentration, the virus particles were precipitated using a
40% Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 8000 NTE solution (0.5
M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The
virus-PEG solution was stirred for 16–24 hours at 4°C,
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4°C then resuspended in NTE. Viruses tested at Oxford were prepared
from the supernatant medium of infected 10% suckling
mouse brain suspensions in PBS [36]. Viral RNA was iso-

lated from both sources using RNAqueous kit according
to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion, Austin, Texas).
One-step RT-PCR was performed using Superscript III in a
50 µL volume (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) with
touch-down cycling conditions [37]. The final primer
concentration in the RT-PCR was 1pmol per µL. A 40-min
reverse transcription step was performed with incubations
for 10 minutes at each of 46°C, 50°C, 55°C and 60°C.
Enzyme activation at 94°C for 15 minutes was followed
by the touch down PCR. During cycling, denaturation and
extension were performed at 94°C for 15 seconds and
68°C for 60 seconds respectively. Annealing occurred for
30 seconds during each cycle, with one cycle at each of the
following temperatures of 56°C, 54°C, 52°C, 50°C,
48°C, 46°C, 44°C and 42°C. After the touch down stage,
36 cycles with a 40°C annealing temperature, and then a
final extension for 10 minutes at 68°C completed the programme. The reaction was held at 11°C until processing
then stored at -20°C.
The specificity of the primers was investigated by attempting amplification from cultures infected with viruses that
are not flaviviruses, including Barmah Forest virus, Ross
River virus, Influenza A virus, Human coronavirus NL,
Human coronavirus OC43, Human adenovirus, Human
bocavirus, Human rhinovirus 1, 2 or 3 and RNA from
virus free cell cultures.
RT-PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Colonies were PCR screened for
the presence of an insert. Positive colonies were grown
overnight in LB with 1 µg mL-1 ampicillin. The plasmid
was purified using a spin column kit (Qiagen, Eppendorf
or Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Colony PCRs were performed using a step down protocol
as described above although the extension temperature
was 72°C (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). RT-PCR and
PCR products were analysed on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and visualised using a UV transilluminator.

Purified plasmid was sequenced using ABI BigDye Terminator Version 3.1 chemistry, on the AB3730xl sequencing
platform. SP6 and T7 promoter primers were used for
sequencing. Each virus clone was sequenced twice or more
in the forward and reverse directions.
Sequence data were assembled using Contig Express (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). Sequences were then compared to the GenBank non-redundant nucleotide
database using BLASTN [38]; the programme identified
the most closely matching sequences and produced alignments. Species and strain names were matched between
the GenBank records and the virus isolates from which
template RNA was extracted. RT-PCR reactions were considered to have been successful if the highest scoring
alignment was made with a sequence from the expected
flavivirus and the correct region of the genome. Publications were traced from the Genbank files to confirm that
the sequences had been correctly named. Virus strain
names were only used for those isolates where the strain
had been identified by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [15]. If there was no relevant
sequence information available in the GenBank database
then the identification was based on phylogenetic analysis.
Sequences of known species and strains, identified by the
ICTV using their Genbank accession codes, were compiled
with the sequences from the amplified products;
sequences were then aligned using the default single step
progressive method of the program MAFFT version 6.0
[15,39]. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were
found for the aligned sequences using the program
PhyML [40]; a general time reversible model was used,
nucleotide frequencies and the proportion invariant
nucleotides were estimated from the data, and variable
rates were allowed at different positions with four rate categories. Bootstrap analyses were done using the program
PAUP version 4 [41] using the maximum parsimony and
neighbour-joining
methods.
