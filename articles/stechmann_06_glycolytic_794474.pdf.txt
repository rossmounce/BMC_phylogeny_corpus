Abstract
Background: Glycolysis and subsequent fermentation is the main energy source for many
anaerobic organisms. The glycolytic pathway consists of ten enzymatic steps which appear to be
universal amongst eukaryotes. However, it has been shown that the origins of these enzymes in
specific eukaryote lineages can differ, and sometimes involve lateral gene transfer events. We have
conducted an expressed sequence tag (EST) survey of the anaerobic flagellate Trimastix pyriformis
to investigate the nature of the evolutionary origins of the glycolytic enzymes in this relatively
unstudied organism.
Results: We have found genes in the Trimastix EST data that encode enzymes potentially catalyzing
nine of the ten steps of the glycolytic conversion of glucose to pyruvate. Furthermore, we have
found two different enzymes that in principle could catalyze the conversion of phosphoenol
pyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate (or the reverse reaction) as part of the last step in glycolysis. Our
phylogenetic analyses of all of these enzymes revealed at least four cases where the relationship of
the Trimastix genes to homologs from other species is at odds with accepted organismal
relationships. Although lateral gene transfer events likely account for these anomalies, with the data
at hand we were not able to establish with confidence the bacterial donor lineage that gave rise to
the respective Trimastix enzymes.
Conclusion: A number of the glycolytic enzymes of Trimastix have been transferred laterally from
bacteria instead of being inherited from the last common eukaryotic ancestor. Thus, despite
widespread conservation of the glycolytic biochemical pathway across eukaryote diversity, in a
number of protist lineages the enzymatic components of the pathway have been replaced by lateral
gene transfer from disparate evolutionary sources. It remains unclear if these replacements result
from selectively advantageous properties of the introduced enzymes or if they are neutral
outcomes of a gene transfer 'ratchet' from food or endosymbiotic organisms or a combination of
both processes.

Background
Eukaryotes catabolize glucose to pyruvate via the
Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolytic pathway [1].
A number of protists are known that lack classical mitochondrial structures and electron-transport-linked ATP
production, instead relying on substrate-level phosphorylation. In these organisms, glycolysis and subsequent fermentation reactions play a central role in their energy
metabolism [2-4]. Although often referred to as 'amitochondriates', most of these protist taxa have been shown
to harbor organelles of mitochondrial descent [5-7].
Hydrogenosomes for example metabolize pyruvate via a
fermentative pathway that yields ATP and hydrogen [3].
Other mitochondrion-derived organelles, such as the
'mitosomes' of the parasites Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia, seem to have lost all core metabolic functions
[7]. In these organisms, pyruvate is catabolized by fermentation in the cytosol.
Although the core EMP pathway appears to be almost universal amongst eukaryotes, amitochondriate protists have
been shown to be surprisingly flexible in terms of the specific enzyme families they utilize to carry out glycolytic
reactions. More interestingly these enzymes appear to
have rather diverse origins [1,8] and it is likely that this
variability was achieved, at least in part, by lateral gene
transfer (LGT) [9-15]. For instance, in the first step of glycolysis, diplomonads and parabasalids use glucokinase,
rather than hexokinase which carries out this reaction in
most other eukaryotes [11,13]. Similarly, amitochondriate protists such as parabasalids, diplomonads, pelobionts and entamoebids cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
with a class II fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), while
most other eukaryotes possess a class I FBA [14,16-18].
These two enzymes are non-homologous and belong to
different superfamilies [1,16]. In many cases, the glycolytic enzymes that are replaced by LGT appear to come
from a bacterial donor lineage. For instance, diplomonad
and parabasalid glucose phosphate isomerases (GPI) are
more closely related to the GPIs of cyanobacteria and
chloroplasts than to cytosolic GPIs of other eukaryotes
[11]. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) of parabasalids is not part of the GapC clade
which encompasses most eukaryotic GAPDHs including
those of most amitochondriates. Instead, it clusters most
closely with the sequences of the spirochaete genus Borrelia within the bacterial GapAB clade [10,19,20]. Similarly,
the evolution of phosphofructokinase (PFK) shows phospho-donor changes and frequent lateral gene transfer
[15]. In amitochondriates, pyrophosphate-dependent,
ATP-dependent or both types of PFK are present – most of
them acquired by LGT [9,12,15].
In some protist taxa, additional enzymes involved in glycolytic reactions are found that are rare amongst most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/101

eukaryotes. For instance, pyruvate phosphate dikinase
(PPDK) is an analogous enzyme to pyruvate kinase (PK),
with a key difference being that PPDK uses pyrophosphate
instead of ATP to catalyze the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate and generates ATP in the process. PPDK is present in a number of eukaryotes including
the anaerobes Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia
[21,22], Trichomonas vaginalis and Streblomastix strix [23]
and the phylogenetic affinites of the eukaryote enzymes
are diverse [23].
These examples demonstrate the diversity in the equipment of glycolytic enzymes and in their evolutionary history in protists in general, and anaerobic species in
particular. However, our knowledge of the biochemistry
of diverse protist lineages still remains severely limited to
taxa of biomedical or agricultural importance.
Here we expand this knowledge to include the anaerobic
flagellate Trimastix pyriformis [24]. Species of the genus Trimastix are free-living nanoflagellates which thrive in
anoxic environments, where they feed on bacteria [25].
They harbor small double membrane-bound organelles
of unknown function which structurally resemble hydrogenosomes [25,26] but are probably derived from mitochondria [27]. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that
Trimastix species form a sister group to the oxymonads,
another goup of 'amitochondriate' protist that are symbionts of termites and cockroaches [28]. The placement of
these organisms in the eukaryotic tree remains contentious, but on the basis of ultrastructural comparisons they
have been suggested to be part of a eukaryote super-group
called the Excavata [29]. The Excavata is comprised of a
number of aerobic protist lineages including the Heterolobosea, Euglenozoa (e.g. kinetoplastids) and jakobid
flagellates as well as anaerobic lineages such as diplomonads (Giardia), Carpediemonas and parabasalids (e.g. Trichomonas). Although, ultrastructural evidence for the
Excavata is convincing [29], molecular phylogenetic support remains weak [30,31].
To improve our knowledge of the biochemical diversity of
anaerobic protists we initiated an EST project of Trimastix
pyriformis. We identified a large number of ESTs coding for
enzymes involved in glycolysis and subsequent fermentation. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal that, while some
glycolytic enzymes in this organism were inherited by vertical descent, about half of the glycolytic enzymes of Trimastix were acquired by lateral gene transfer events, likely
from different bacterial donors. Although the glycolytic
pathway is universally conserved in eukaryotes, its
enzyme components are evolutionarily labile and have
been repeatedly replaced in separate eukaryotic lineages
by gene transfer from diverse eubacterial donors.

Results
Phylogenies of glycolytic enzymes of Trimastix
pyriformis
From our EST data we identified 9 homologs of glycolytic
enzymes typically found in other eukaryotes plus a second
enzyme for the final glycolytic step (pyruvate phosphate
dikinase (PPDK)). In order to completely sequence each
homolog, 5'-RACE and primer walking sequencing were
performed. Putative enzyme activities, lengths, and GC
contents of the encoded proteins are shown in Table 1. In
the following sections we describe the properties and phylogenetic affinities of each enzyme in turn.
Hexokinase
The evolution of hexokinases is characterized by several
independent gene duplications which gave rise to numerous isoenzymes within different phyla: plants have two
isoenzymes (hxk1, hxk2), vertebrates have four (hexokinase A-D) and yeasts have two (PI and PII) [32]; the vertebrate hexokinase D is often referred to as glucokinase. Like
most aerobic eukaryotes and the amitochondriate parasite
Entamoeba histolytica, Trimastix appears to use hexokinase
for the first enzymatic step in glycolysis whereas the amitochondriate 'excavates' Giardia intestinalis, Spironucleus
barkhanus and Trichomonas vaginalis all appear to use glucokinase [11,13]. It is uncertain if bacteria use a real hexokinase, however search of several databases revealed
three prokaryotes (Bacteroides and 2 spirochaetes) with
hexokinases that were readily aligned with the eukaryotic
hexokinase genes. These three prokaryotic sequences form
a distinct clade that is clearly separated from the eukaryotic hexokinase sequences (see Additional file 1). The
eukaryotic part of the tree shows very little resolution
between major groups with Fungi appearing to be paraphyletic with respect to bacteria and other eukaryotes, a
feature that is not supported by bootstrap analysis. The
Trimastix homolog emerges firmly within the eukaryotes,
but is not strongly allied with any other lineages. Thus the
Trimastix hexokinase gene is most probably of eukaryotic
origin via vertical descent.

Glucose Phosphate Isomerase (GPI)
The GPI gene family can be divided into three major types
of GPIs which show only a low degree of sequence similarity [11,33]: type I GPIs are found in the eukaryotic
cytosol and in many bacteria. Type II are typical for cyanobacteria and chloroplasts but were recently also detected
in the amitochondriate excavates Giardia intestinalis, Spironucleus barkhanus, and Trichomonas vaginalis [11]. Finally,
the GPIs of the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii and
some Gram positive bacteria are assigned to type III [33].
For tree reconstruction, we used only GPIs of type I and II
(see Additional file 2). The GPI of Trimastix pyriformis is of
type I and not similar to the type II GPIs of diplomonads
and parabasalids. In the type I subtree, several bacterial
lineages and two clades of eukaryotic GPIs can be distinguished (Additional file 2): one of the clades consists of
cytosolic GPIs from alveolates, stramenopiles, and green
plants. The second comprises cytosolic GPIs of fungi and
animals, glycosomal GPIs of kinetoplastids, and a clade of
bacterial GPIs (Proteobacteria and Cytophaga). Likelihood comparisons of different possible trees neither supported nor rejected this seemingly robust grouping of
animals and bacteria [33] and it was concluded that the
branching pattern within the type I subtree is very unstable and currently unresolved. Except for the most basal
branches, this also describes our results. The Trimastix GPI
falls in the unresolved part of the type I subtree (Additional file 2) where it groups with the alpha-proteobacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens (ML analysis only) but
with no statistical support. Given the poor resolution of
the type I GPI subtree, we cannot trace the origin of the
Trimastix GPI other than it is quite distinct from the type
II forms of the other amitochondriate flagellates (parabasalids and diplomonads).
Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA)
A phylogeny of type B class II FBA enzymes is shown in Fig
1A. Trimastix pyriformis possesses a type B class II FBA like
the other amitochondriates [14,17] and branches robustly
with diplomonad FBA sequences in our phylogenetic

analysis (Fig. 1A). The other amitochondriates form a
clearly separated clade branching within diverse bacteria.
An alignment of class II type B FBA protein sequences supports the phylogenetic separation of these groups of amitochondriate taxa; the FBAs of the diplomonads and
Trimastix share some specific indels to the exclusion of the
other amitochondriates (Fig. 1B). However, none of those
indels is exclusive to the diplomonad and Trimastix
sequences but is also found in related FBAs of bacteria (see
Fig. 1B and legend). Our tree shows some similarity to an
earlier study, where Mastigamoeba and Entamoeba also
group together [14]; in that study Trichomonas groups with
these two amitochondriates and this monophyly was not
rejected by a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (monophyly of
all amitochondriates was rejected) [14]. In our study however, Trichomonas groups with Treponema, albeit bootstrap
support is not very high. Lateral transfer scenarios that
account for this particular phylogenetic distribution in
eukaryotes are complex, especially when relationships
amongst the excavate taxa are concerned. Regardless, our
phylogeny and indel data suggest that amitochondrial
protists have acquired their FBAs from at least two different sources implying at least two individual LGT events.
Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI)
The TPIs of all eukaryotes including amitochondriates are
monophyletic (see Additional file 3). In our analysis, the
monophyly of major eukaryotic phyla (with representatives from more than one taxon) like animals, fungi, green
plants, kinetoplastids, stramenopiles, and diplomonads
are recovered although monophyly of fungi is only poorly
supported. The relationships between the eukaryotic lineages are not resolved. The amitochondriates Trimastix pyriformis, Trichomonas vaginalis, the diplomonads, and
Entamoeba histolytica each branch individually in different
parts of the tree. Since there is no clear affiliation between
different phyla nor is one nested in another, the TPI tree
does not support, nor conflict with, the commonly
accepted higher-order eukaryotic relationships [27].
Therefore, it seems likely that the TPI genes in all eukaryotes studied here including Trimastix were inherited vertically from the last common ancestor of eukaryotes.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
The phylogenetic relationships of GAPDHs have been
studied in detail in a wide variety of organisms and the
evolutionary history of this enzyme has turned out to be
very complex [10,19,20,34]. For simplicity, the GAPDHs
may be divided into two general groups, the eukaryote
cytosolic GapC group and the bacterial GapAB group (Fig.
2A; [1,34]). Green plants contain in addition to their
cytosolic GapC homolog, GapA and GapB duplicates
which they acquired from a single ancestral gene in the
ancestral chloroplast endosymbiont and which is used in
the Calvin Cycle [1]. In diplonemids (a group of Eugleno-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/101

zoa) an obscure additional GapAB gene of a different origin was detected [34]. In parabasalids, no GapC has ever
been found. They instead possess bacterial-like GapAB
homologs which are located in the cytosol and are active
in glycolysis [10,19]. Curiously, in our phylogenetic analyses, the GAPDH sequence of Trimastix pyriformis is the sister of the GAPDH of parabasalids (Fig. 2A) supported by
high bootstrap values. The tight parabasalid/Trimastix
clade is loosely associated with the sequence of the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi (bootstrap support 42%) similar to earlier reports of the affinities of the parabasalid
homologs [20]. Despite the poor bootstrap support for
this grouping, a common origin for the parabasalid, Trimastix and spirochaete homologs is confirmed by a
unique homologous insertion, which is 11 amino acids
long in parabasalids, but shorter in Trimastix and Borrelia
(Fig. 2B). Another characteristic found in the Trimastix
GAPDH is a eubacterial-like sequence in the S-loop of the
enzyme, which is also seen in Trichomonas [19] and the
other parabasalids (not shown).
Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)
PGKs of archaebacteria, bacteria and eukaryotes are
homologous [1]. With few exceptions, eukaryotic PGK
genes constitute a monophyletic group nested within the
bacterial clade (Fig. 3A). The structure of the bacterial subtree is not resolved and only few bacterial groups are
recovered. In an earlier study, PGKs of kinetoplastids were
located basal in the eukaryotic clade to the exclusion of
chloroplast and bacterial PGKs [35]. However, with a
broader sampling of bacterial PGKs, the homologs in
kinetoplastids are separated from the major eukaryote
clade by the sequence of Aquifex (Fig. 3A) and the chloroplast targeted PGKs branch with those from cyanobacteria. The PGK of Trimastix pyriformis also falls within the
bacterial PGKs but its sister lineage can not be determined
exactly. A relationship to Clostridium perfringens (Fig. 3A)
or to Deinococcus radiodurans is suggested (not shown) but
without any statistical support. A possible monophyly of
the Trimastix and kinetoplastids PGKs can not be excluded
entirely. In contrast, the PGKs of the amitochondriates
Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis are part of the
eukaryotic clade. PGKs of the eukaryotic type are supposed to have a typical surface loop, which is shortened in
bacterial PGKs [1]. In accordance with its phylogenetic
position, the loop is missing completely in the PGK of Trimastix (Fig. 3B). It is present but shorter in the PGKs of
kinetoplastids and the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.
On the other hand, the loop is also shorter in the PGKs of
the protists Naegleria gruberi and Giardia lambia which
branch in the eukaryotic clade. A one amino acid insertion
is typical for PGKs of eukaryotes and not found in PGK of
bacteria, kinetoplastids, chloroplasts and Trimastix (Fig.
3B; position 276 in the alignment). In summary, the PGK
of Trimastix appears to be of different origin than PGKs of

support in the ML tree (100%). The asterisk marks another indel event, where the three amitochondriate protists Trimastix,

most eukaryotes and likely derives from an LGT event,
although a bacterial donor lineage can not be determined.
Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM)
Two types of PGAM can be distinguished that seem to be
evolutionarily unrelated: a cofactor-dependent form
(dPGAM) found in vertebrates and yeasts and a cofactorindependent form (iPGAM), mainly found in plants,
algae and invertebrates [1,36]. Several eubacteria possess
both forms and recently it has been shown that archaebacteria also have both forms [36-38]. Trimastix harbors a
cofactor-independent PGAM, which groups together with
the two kinetoplastid and the plant sequences (Fig. 4) in
a cluster that also contains the amitochondriate Giardia
lamblia, a spirochaete (Leptospira), and a proteobacterium
(Dechloromonas). Giardia branches together with Dechloromonas, whereas Leptospira branches at the base of the Trimastix/plant/kinetoplastid clade. Although bootstrap
support is very high for the whole cluster, it is not clear if
both bacterial sequences are involved in LGT events or
only one of them. The main cluster of the tree in Fig. 4
comprises prokaryotes and several eukaryotic sequences
(Fungi, Metazoa, plant chloroplasts). Within that cluster,
the two red algal chloroplast sequences branch with high
bootstrap support with cyanobacteria as expected given
the endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts. The remaining
eukaryotes from this part of the tree (Fungi, Metazoa,
Microsporidia) branch in a cluster with a proteobacterium
and Cytophaga, but bootstrap support is very low. Our tree
suggests that iPGAM was involved in numerous lateral
gene transfer events within all major groups of organisms
including archaebacteria, eubacteria, and the eukaryotes.
Eukaryotes seem to have acquired iPGAM several times
independently, however weak or missing bootstrap support leaves it open which sequences were derived from
which donor group.
Enolase
The enolases of eukaryotes are more closely related to
archaebacteria than to bacteria (see Additional file 4), [3941] and it was concluded that the enolase genes were
transmitted vertically from the archaebacterial ancestors
to eukaryotes [39,41]. The only exceptions are the
cytosolic and probably plastid-targeted enolases of
Euglena gracilis, which are missing a eukaryote-specific
indel, and cluster among bacterial homologs with the spirochaete Treponema pallidum (not shown) [39]. Within the
eukaryotic clade, intracellular transfer of enolase genes
from the eukaryotic endosymbiont to the nucleus of the
host cell was detected in chlorarchniophytes and cryptophytes [42]. On the subgenic level, insertions were probably transmitted between alveolates and land plants, two
distantly related lineages, by lateral transfer and fine-scale
recombination, resulting in a mosaic gene [42]. Parabasalids are the deepest branch in the eukaryotic tree (Addi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/101

tional file 4, [40]), but the discovery that a two amino acid
deletion which was believed to be unique for Parabasalia
is in fact a polymorphic character for this group does not
support the hypothesis that they are the earliest diverging
eukaryotes [40,43]. The enolase of Trimastix pyriformis is
recovered as related to kinetoplastids with moderate bootstrap support, however the relationship of this clade to
other eukaryotic taxa is not well resolved despite the fact
that the eukaryote grouping itself is strongly supported
(Additional file 4). Given this phylogeny, it is simplest to
assume that Trimastix inherited its enolase gene by vertical
descent.
Pyruvate kinase (PK)
Phylogenetic trees of PKs divide the bacterial sequences
into two main clusters (Fig. 5, [44]). This split topology
may be explained by an ancient gene duplication [44] or
a complex LGT scenario. In any case, cytoplasmic PKs of
fungi, kinetoplastids, animals, and plants form a tight
clade, which is embedded in one of the bacterial clusters.
By contrast, the PKs of the amitochondriate protists have
a different origin: the PK of Mastigamoeba balamuthi is in
the same subtree as the cytoplasmatic PKs, but it is closely
related with an enzyme of Borrelia burgdorferi, a relationship that is supported by 100% bootstrap values. The PKs
of Trimastix pyriformis, Giardia lamblia, and Trichomonas
vaginalis fall within the second subtree, however, the
branching order within this subtree is not well resolved.
The enzyme from Giardia, although highly divergent in its
amino acid sequence, very strongly groups with proteobacterial homologs to the exclusion of the other eukaryotes. Both the Trichomonas and the Trimastix sequences
emerge in separate parts of this subtree, but the internal
branching order depends on methods of analysis and is
poorly supported in all cases. Thus although we cannot
reconstruct the history of the Trimastix and Trichomonas
genes with any precision, it does seem likely that they
acquired their PK homologs in at least one event of LGT
from a eubacterium, probably separately from Giardia.
Pyruvate-phosphate dikinase (PPDK)
In our phylogenetic analyses of diverse PPDKs sequences,
the chloroplast targeted PPDKs from plants and a PPDK of
a stramenopile form a tight clade to the exclusion of
PPDKs of bacteria, archaebacteria, kinetoplastids, and
amitochondriate protists (see Additional file 5, [45,46]).
The PPKDs of protists are not monophyletic; the two possible PPDK genes of Trichomonas vaginalis are very similar
and branch as sistergroup to the PPDKs of the Gram positive (high GC) bacteria. PPDKs of the amoeboid amitochondriates Entamoeba histolytica and Mastigamoeba
balamuthi form a well-supported clade, which surprisingly
branches as sistergroup with the PPDK of the proteobacterium Methylococcus capsulatus which in turn branches with
the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum,

a grouping that was recently shown also by Slamovits and
Keeling [23]. While the relationship of the kinetoplastid
PPDKs within the tree is not fully resolved, they branch as
the sister group to proteobacteria and Chlorobium plus
Bacteroides, but receive no statistical support. Trimastix
pyriformis and the two Streblomastix sequences form a well
supported clade which in turn branches together with Giardia lamblia, with low to moderate support. Overall our
tree does not support a common origin of all amitochondriate PPDKs as the parabasalid and the amoebozoan
homologs are each strongly allied with a distinct prokaryotic group. However, the placement of the Trimastix PPDK

with oxymonads and the diplomonad in an unresolved
portion of the tree prevents definitive conclusions to be
made regarding its origins but is suggestive of an LGT
event to a common ancestral excavate.

Discussion
Phylogenetic patterns in glycolytic enzymes of
amitochondriates
The extent of lateral gene transfer among glycolytic
enzymes in Trimastix pyriformis is comparable with that in
Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. At least four of the ten glycolytic enzymes that we

identified in the ESTs of Trimastix (FBA, GAPDH, PGK,
and PK), have been acquired from a bacterium by LGT
and the phylogenies of two more enzymes (PGAM and
PPDK) suggest LGTs as well. Although we propose that
these events happened in the direction of prokaryote to
eukaryote we cannot completely exclude the possibility
that the opposite has happened, where a eukaryote
donated a gene to a prokaryote. For instance, for some of
these enzymes (e. g. FBA, Fig. 1A) the backbone phylogeny of prokaryotes is scrambled relative to accepted taxonomic relationships implying that gene transfers must
have been occurring between these lineages as well. However, there are several reasons why we suspect most of the
examples we discuss are more likely prokaryote-to-eukaryote transfers. The existing literature on LGT indicates that
well substantiated cases of eukaryote to prokaryote transfer are rare, possibly because of difficulties in prokaryotes
accommodating eukaryotic gene structure (e. g. introns/
exons) [47]. Furthermore, in some of the cases that we discuss, the number of eukaryotes that possess homologs of
an enzyme sub-type is very small relative to the number of
prokaryotes and the eukaryotes are often distantly separated on the tree (e. g. FBA Fig. 1A). In other cases, such as
GAPDH (Fig. 2A), the putative eukaryotic recipients of the
transfers are distantly related to major eukaryotic clades
nested deep within a group of prokaryotic and organellar
homologs. For the glycolytic enzymes we have examined,
the number of inter-domain LGT events required to
explain the data are far fewer if eukaryotes are the recipients and prokaryotes the donor.
Although the trees supported separation of the eukaryote
lineages and their emergence within predominantly
prokaryotic clades, we could not determine the bacterial
donor lineage implicated because of the poorly resolved
branching patterns in the trees. Taking also the other amitochondriates into account, there are only few examples
where we can trace back the donor lineages. Spirochaetes
seem to be involved quite often in LGT events (Figs. 1A,
2A, 5) as was previously noted [20] and there was a conspicuous lack of putative LGT events between archaebacteria and eukaryotes. This is curious because LGTs
between archaebacteria and amitochondriates are not
exceptional and have been reported for enzymes catalyzing the reactions downstream from the glycolytic pathway
involved in the fermentation of pyruvate [48-51].
Another curious pattern is that two enzymes in Trimastix
that were clearly of vertical origin – TPI and enolase – were
also apparently inherited vertically in the other amitochondriate eukaryotes (Additional Files 3 and 4). This
indicates that the selection of enzymes in glycolysis that
are replaced by LGTs in amitochondriate (and other)
eukaryotes is not random. Selection for particular properties of these enzymes in amitochondriate protists must

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/101

play some kind of role in this process, although precisely
what these properties are remains a complete mystery.
Alliances between 'excavate' homologs
In our trees, glycolytic enzyme homologs from excavates
tend to cluster together to some extent (Figs 1A, 2A, 3A,
Additional Files 2 and 5). However, the relationships
between excavate homologs in the different enzyme trees
are mutually contradictory.

Reconciling these groupings with known excavate relationships is a complex undertaking, especially given the
uncertainty in the validity of an 'Excavata' clade [30]. Nevertheless, multiple gene phylogenies support several
robust groupings of excavates, of which three are relevant
here: (1) diplomonads plus parabasalids (and other taxa
collectively known as Metamonada); (2) Trimastix and
oxymonads (Preaxostyla); and (3) Euglenoids and kinetoplastids (Euglenozoa) [30]. If we assume these groupings
are correct, then we can suggest plausible gene transfer
scenarios.
For instance, the type II GPI of diplomonads and parabasalids is explained by a gene transfer event in their common 'metamonad' ancestor, while all other eukaryotes
acquired their type I GPI homologs in one (or possibly
two) separate event from a eubacterial donor (Additional
file 2). On the other hand, the FBA tree suggests a common ancestor of diplomonads and Trimastix inherited an
LGT of the class II type B enzyme to the exclusion of parabasalids (Fig. 1A). In this case, a common ancestor of the
Preaxostyla and Metamonada may have acquired the FBA
enzyme by LGT from eubacteria, with a second separate
event replacing the enzyme later in parabasalids. In this
scenario the kinetoplastids may retain the original 'excavate' class I FBA (like other eukaryotes), while a separate
LGT must be postulated to explain why Euglena and yeasts
possess the type A version of the class II enzyme [14].
The GAPDH tree indicates that Trimastix and parabasalids
share a 'eubacterial' type enzyme whereas diplomonads
and Euglenozoa have the canonical 'eukaryotic' versions
of the enzyme (Fig. 2A). In this case it seems likely that
either Trimastix or an ancestral parabasalid acquired the
enzyme from a spirochaete-like donor and 'passed' this
version to the other eukaryote by LGT. Evidence for such
eukaryote-eukaryote LGT events is beginning to accumulate [51] and makes ecological sense if ancestors of these
lineages coexisted in anoxic environments.
Finally, in the PPDK tree Trimastix groups with the oxymonad Streblomastix and the diplomonad Giardia, while
the parabasalids branch independently among the highGC gram positive bacteria (Additional file 5). As both of
these clades emerge from within the bacteria it seems pos-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:101

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/101

sible that either an ancestral 'excavate' lineage acquired
the PPDK from a eubacterial donor with the parabasalids
replacing their version later by an additional LGT event
from eubacteria or Trimastix or the diplomonads acquired
PPDK from the other by LGT. In either scenario, two LGT
events are required.
The foregoing interpretations, while reasonable, are ad hoc
explanations of observed branching patterns and insertion/deletion characters. Alternative LGT scenarios that
account for the data may be equally plausible. However,
to test these scenarios more information of two sorts is
sorely needed. First, full genome sequences from the taxa
represented in the tree are needed to determine if the
homologs we have analyzed are the only members of the
enzyme family present in the genome; if multiple copies
exist in these genomes, then the phylogenetic histories of
the copies may provide clues as to which ones are 'ancestral' and which are newly acquired by LGT. Second, a
much better sampling of protistan and eubacterial
genomes related to those implicated in the gene transfer
events could provide key information regarding when
such gene transfers took place, and allow the direction of
transfer to be discerned. Indeed, a recent investigation
aimed at broadening taxonomic sampling was able to
provide much more precise information regarding the
timing of LGT events in eukaryotic genomes [51].
Can phylogenetic error be the explanation for the
aberrant branching patterns?
As in every phylogenetic analysis, we may encounter random and systematic error. The lack of resolution in our
trees can not be avoided due to the limited amount of

data. Bootstrap values allow us at least to judge the statistical significance of bipartitions and determine which
nodes are unresolved. We did not compare different tree
topologies by likelihood ratio tests since this is too time
consuming to complete for multiple topologies and the
10 enzyme families we examined. It was more important
for us to determine if a gene from an amitochondriate
branches within the main eukaryotic cluster than to trace
back the actual bacterial donor lineage. For rather ancient
LGTs, identifying the donor lineage might be impossible
given the high background of bacterial LGTs, as pointed
out by others [47,52].
We included some sequences in our analyses which did
not pass the chi-squared tests for homogeneity of amino
acid frequencies as implemented in TREE-PUZZLE (Table
2) and are therefore prone to phylogenetic artefacts. In
most cases, these sequences branched with closely-related
organisms in regions of the tree that were irrelevant to our
conclusions. One exception is the PK of Giardia lamblia
that is indeed represented by a very long branch and has
significantly deviant amino acid composition (Table 2).
However, it clusters with the short branches of proteobacterial PKs (Fig. 5) that are themselves not compositionally
biased, suggesting that this grouping is likely historical
rather than artefactual.
Not only is there conspicuous lack of evidence for 'phylogenetic artefacts' accounting for the aberrant branching
patterns we describe, in a number of cases (Figs 1, 2, 3) we
have also found characteristic insertion and deletion patterns in the enzyme homologs that support aspects of the
phylogeny and the inference of LGT. As these regions were

always removed from the data prior to the phylogenetic
analyses and are not subject to phylogenetic 'artefacts' of
the same sort as the trees, we suggest that the strongly supported phylogenetic patterns that we report likely represent the true history of the protein families.
What about ancient paralogy and differential loss?
Provided that the phylogenies were correctly inferred,
therefore, the unexpected relationships can be explained
generally either by proposing LGT events or by ancient
gene duplications followed by selective gene loss events in
independent lineages [47]. However, the hallmarks of
such 'paralogy scenarios' are multiple copies of enzymes
in many taxa that generate 'mirror' organismal trees with
random taxonomic gaps reflecting differential gene loss.
Our phylogenies do not show this pattern. Thus if ancient
paralogy were invoked to explain our data, it would
require positing hypothetical ancestral organisms that
retained progressively more and more paralogs of the
enzymes in question as one moves deeper in the tree of
life. Furthermore, cataclysmic numbers of differential
losses of these paralogs would have to occur on independent lineages to generate the extant pattern. This scenario
seems unlikely at best. However, although we do not see
any evidence for paralogy, it is possible that some mixture
of paralogy/gene loss and LGT events have generated the
observed distribution of enzyme types in eukaryotes.
Once again, full genome sequences from a much greater
diversity of organisms are required to evaluate the relative
likelihood of these alternative scenarios.

Conclusion
Replacement of glycolytic enzymes by LGT: selection or
neutral evolution?
Do Trimastix pyriformis and other amitochondriates gain
any advantages by replacing the canonical eukaryotic versions of the glycolytic enzymes or is it just a random process [53]? The use of pyrophosphate-linked instead of ATPdependent enzymes can increase the overall efficiency of
glycolysis, which is especially important if ATP production is solely carried out by glycolysis [54-56]. Pyrophosphate (PPi) is created during biosynthetic polymerization
reactions and, in most organisms is hydrolyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase in order to thermodynamically
favor the anabolic reactions. Organisms like Giardia lamblia, which presumably lack inorganic pyrophosphatase,
can use pyrophosphate instead of ATP as the phosphordonor in some reactions [54,55]. In Trimastix we found in
addition to an ATP-dependent PK, the pyrophosphatelinked PPDK as a second enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate
(PPDK can also work in the other direction towards gluconeogenesis). For Giardia, in vitro tests suggested that
both PK and PPDK play a role in glycolysis [57]. For Trichomonas, on the other hand, only PK activity could be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/101

detected [58] but the preliminary TIGR database of the
Trichomonas genome contains two (very similar) PPDK
genes (Fig. 5). Like in Trimastix, the mere presence of these
two genes allows no conclusions to be made regarding
their metabolic function. However, one could speculate
that only one of the two is active in glycolysis, whereas the
other one is still present in the genome but on its way to
losing its function. It is noteworthy that we found over 30
times more ESTs for PPDK than for PK in the Trimastix
library suggesting that the expression of PPDK is significantly higher in Trimastix than that of PK. The closely
related oxymonad Streblomastix strix has also been shown
to harbour PPDK (two copies in fact), but an ATP-dependent PK has not yet been found [23]. PPDK is also found in
kinetoplastids, where it is involved in pyrophosphate
recycling [59], and in plants, where it is involved in fixation of CO2 [60]. Our tree suggests that the PPDKs of all
amitochondriates sampled here have been acquired by
lateral gene transfer events. It is tempting to assume that
the acquisition of this PPi-linked enzyme is the result of
an adaptation to the amitochondriate nature of these
organisms, thus enabling them to increase ATP yield during glycolysis.
Interestingly, laterally acquired glycolytic enzymes of amitochondriates were shown to have biochemical properties
more similar to the bacterial homologs than to the canonical eukaryotic enzymes consistent with their phylogenetic position [19,58]. In Trichomonas PK is stimulated by
ribose 5-phosphate and glycerate 3-phosphate, as is the
case for many bacteria, while most eukaryotic PKs are
allosterically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
[57,58]. Similarly, the Trichomonas GAPDH exhibits sensitivity to the inhibitor koningic acid at comparable levels
to eubacterial homologs and two orders of magnitude less
than eukaryotic GAPDHs. This sensitivity is directly linked
to the sequence of the S-loop domain of the enzyme
which has a eubacterial signature in Trichomonas [19] and
Trimastix. A selective advantage may be hidden behind
these differences but it is not yet recognized. The same is
true for FBAs of amitochondriates, which are all of class II
and have been acquired in several independent LGT
events. Thus, it seems that laterally transferred genes often
retain some of their 'bacterial properties', although the
biochemical properties of these enzymes need to be studied in much more detail.
The most abundant pattern of LGT in eukaryotes is the
transfer of genes from the bacterial ancestors of the modern mitochondrion and plastid to the cell nucleus during
the process of organelle genome reduction [11,47,53].
Several proteins involved in the energy metabolism of
eukaryotes are sister to or nested within alpha-proteobacteria in phylogenetic inferences which is seen as straightforward evidence for mitochondrion-to-host gene transfer

[61]. Some go further and regard every affiliation of a
eukaryotic protein to any bacterial phylum as probable
endosymbiotic gene transfer [52,62]: first, given the extent
of LGT and gene loss among bacteria, the respective
homolog may no longer be found in extant alpha proteobacteria; or second, during the course of the gene transfer
from endosymbiont to the host genome, the gene had no
functional constraints and may have acquired numerous
mutations which now mask its origin. Plants recruited a
huge number of their nuclear genes from the plastid
genome as revealed by a comparison of the genomes of
Arabidopsis thaliana, cyanobacteria, and chloroplasts [63].
Massive endosymbiotic gene transfers from eukaryote to
eukaryote were observed from the nucleomorph (the
reduced nucleus of the eukaryotic endosymbiont) to the
nucleus of the mixotrophic alga Bigelowiella natans [64].
The extent of LGT from non-organellar (in contrast to
endosymbiotic organelle) donors to eukaryotic genomes
seems to vary from lineage to lineage. For rumen ciliates,
diplomonads, Bigelowiella natans, and Trimastix pyriformis
(this study), it was shown that they acquired a significant
number of genes by LGT from different bacterial, and even
eukaryotic, lineages [64-66]. More sporadic, but steadily
increasing in number, are documented LGTs to other protist lineages [11,13,48,50,51,65,66]. The pattern that
seems to emerge is that LGT is not infrequent in phagotrophic protists, while its impact on the evolution of other
eukaryotic lineages is either minor or simply not yet
known [64,66]. A mechanism has been proposed, where
small pieces of DNA of the engulfed bacteria escape digestion and are incorporated into the protist genome replacing the ancestral eukaryotic genes over time in a rather
random manner [53]. As already discussed, the high frequency of LGT in amitochondriates may be partially but
not entirely caused by the fact that these protists live
phagotrophically. Selection as a result of adaptation to
certain environments might favor the uptake of specific
proteins more suitable to the host organism, making LGT
a non-random process [66]. Yet, the relative importance
of random neutral evolution versus the effect of selection
in causing LGT in eukaryotes is something we can not
answer until we understand more about the general frequency of LGT in eukaryotic microbes and the functional
properties of the enzymes involved.

Methods
Source of sequences and alignments
All sequences obtained in our EST project from Trimastix
pyriformis were used for searches against the non-redundant NCBI database (BLAST, [67]) and cDNA clones with
high similarity to 10 glycolytic enzymes were found.
Sequencing of all clones was completed using the primer
walking method. Truncated 5' ends of cDNAs were amplified using the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen). Length and
G+C contents of the coding regions plus accession num-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/101

bers of the deduced protein sequences are summarized in
table 1.
Sequences homologous to the glycolytic enzymes of Trimastix were retrieved from the NCBI non-redundant protein database. The PGK, TPI, PK, and PPDK sequences for
Trichomonas vaginalis were downloaded from the TIGR
database [68]. The TPI dataset was complemented with
the TPI sequences of Entamoeba histolytica, Spironucleus
barkhanus, and Acrasis rosea (accession numbers
EF064144–EF064146), which were obtained by PCR
using degenerate primers directed against the N-terminal
motifs VGGNWK (TF-1) and VGGNFK (TF-2) and the Cterminal VGGASL (TR-1). PCRs were carried out with
genomic DNA using standard methods. The PGK
sequence of Naegleria gruberi was obtained from another
EST project (accession number EF064143).
The individual datasets were aligned with ClustalW using
default settings [69] and subsequently adjusted manually.
An alignment of enolases, to which we manually added
the Trimastix sequence, was kindly provided by Patrick
Keeling (University of British Columbia, Vancouver).
Regions of ambiguous alignment were excluded from further analyses. Care was taken that each dataset contained
a reasonable number of sequences representing all major
taxonomic groups and sequence clades. The number of
sequences and amino acid positions used for phylogenetic
analyses of each dataset are listed in table 2.
Phylogenetic analyses
Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were inferred
using PMBML [70], with the JTT substitution model and a
mixed four category discrete gamma-model of among-site
variation. The gamma shape parameter alpha was estimated using TREE-PUZZLE [71] (see table 2 for alpha values). TREE-PUZZLE also provided the distance matrix
(using the same models) which was used to construct ML
distance trees using the Fitch-Margoliash algorithm as
implemented in FITCH from the Phylip package [72]. In
both types of analyses, ten random additions with global
rearrangements were used to find the optimal tree. ML distance bootstrap values for bipartitions were calculated by
analyses of 100 resampled data sets using PUZZLEBOOT
([73] distributed by A. J. Roger and M. E. Holder). The
alpha parameter for each resampled dataset was calculated separately using the same models as described
above. Only one random sequence addition was done.
ML bootstrap values were calculated with the program
phyml [74], using a discrete gamma model with four rate
categories and 100 resamplings; the gamma parameter
alpha was calculated individually for each resampled
dataset. All trees were caluclated unrooted but are shown
with outgroups for display purposes.
