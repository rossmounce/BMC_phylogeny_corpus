Abstract
Background: Basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins are a class of transcription factors (TFs)
that play diverse roles in eukaryotes. Malfunctions in these proteins lead to cancer and various
other diseases. For detailed characterization of these TFs, further public resources are required.
Description: We constructed a database, designated bZIPDB, containing information on 49
human bZIP TFs, by means of automated literature collection and manual curation. bZIPDB aims
to provide public data required for deciphering the gene regulatory network of the human bZIP
family, e.g., evaluation or reference information for the identification of regulatory modules. The
resources provided by bZIPDB include (1) protein interaction data including direct binding,
phosphorylation and functional associations between bZIP TFs and other cellular proteins, along
with other types of interactions, (2) bZIP TF-target gene relationships, (3) the cellular network of
bZIP TFs in particular cell lines, and (4) gene information and ontology. In the current version of
the database, 721 protein interactions and 560 TF-target gene relationships are recorded. bZIPDB
is annually updated for the newly discovered information.
Conclusion: bZIPDB is a repository of detailed regulatory information for human bZIP TFs that
is collected and processed from the literature, designed to facilitate analysis of this protein family.
bZIPDB is available for public use at http://biosoft.kaist.ac.kr/bzipdb.

Background
Transcription factors (TFs) are responsible for gene expression in every living organism. The bZIP family shares a
basic region and a leucine zipper domain. Homo/heterodimerization between family members is possible
through the leucine zipper domain, and the proteins bind
target promoters via the basic amino acid-rich region [1].

The bZIP TFs play essential roles in several processes in
eukaryotic cells, from early development to tumorigenesis. For example, JUN is an oncogene that affects diverse
cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation
and apoptosis [2], while CEBPA is a well-known regulator
of hepatocyte and adipocyte development [3].

With the assistance of high-throughput technology, such
as microarray technology, several researchers have
attempted to decipher the regulatory networks of bZIP TFs
[4-7]. However, this type of evaluation is largely dependent on manual literature search, which is time-consuming
and incomplete. While a number of the binding proteins
or target genes of bZIP TFs can be retrieved from HPRD or
TRANSFAC [8,9], the currently available data are relatively
limited, and do not necessarily cover the entire cellular
network. For gene transcription, multiple steps are
required, i.e., signaling cascade of multiple proteins, interactions between TFs and other proteins (such as RNA
polymerase) or other TFs, and TF binding to DNA in the
proper orientation. Thus, to elucidate the entire regulatory
network, extensive data on the above processes must be
amassed and processed.
To facilitate our understanding of these proteins, we have
generated a bZIPDB database containing regulatory network information on the human bZIP TF family. In particular, we focus on the signaling protein-TF interactions,
TF-TF interactions, and TF-target gene interactions that are
important for regulatory network analysis with highthroughput technology.

Construction and content
The aim of bZIPDB is to accumulate known regulatory
information on human bZIP TFs, particularly protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. A list of human bZIP
TFs with the appropriate synonyms is documented on our
website. For database construction, public literature dealing with human bZIP TFs, including official symbols and
synonyms, was initially obtained from PubMed [10]
using web queries. The PubMed IDs of 2,498 papers for 49
TFs were stored and arranged in our internal web-based
curation system via an automated process. Regulatory
information was processed and saved under a suitable format in the database by experts.
The regulatory network of the bZIP family is grouped into
six tables, depending on specific attributes. The system
architecture of bZIPDB is depicted in Figure 1, and details
of the attributes are recorded on our website.
• bZIP_TF_INFO: Basic information on human bZIP TFs,
such as bZIPDB ID, official symbol, RefSeq ID and transcript variants.
• GENE_INFORMATION: Information of the chromosomal loci and exons of human bZIP TFs.
• PPI: Protein-protein interactions between bZIP TFs and
other proteins.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/136

• CELL_LINE: Experimental cell lines and their origin.
• TOI: Types of protein-protein interactions.
For 49 human bZIP TFs, bZIPDB ID was assigned on the
basis of the distinct mRNA transcript. Since alternatively
spliced or transcribed products encoded by the same gene
have different biochemical properties [11], we assigned
different IDs to each bZIP TF and its transcript variant, as
reflected in PPI and TF_TARGET tables.
In the construction of a protein-protein interaction table,
information on interaction types, directions of interactions, and cell lines is collected in addition to the identities of interacting proteins. While several databases have
focused on the direct binding of proteins acting as complexes [8,12], cellular protein networks also consist of
other interaction types, such as phosphorylation and
SUMOylation. Functional association, which means that
both proteins are present in the same pathway, is another
important interaction type in transcriptome analysis,
which basically assumes that coregulated genes share similar roles [13,14]. These interaction types are specified in
the TOI table. 'Direction of interaction' indicates that one
protein affects the activity of another protein, i.e.
upstream or downstream in the signaling pathway. RefSeq
ID for each protein is appended as a crosslink to NCBI.
The organism from which the protein originates is also
added as an attribute, since researchers often use proteins
from different sources. Experimental cell lines are additionally classified as an important attribute, since they
originate from different organisms and tissues and therefore have a distinct genomic context, which affects protein-protein interactions (described in the CELL_LINE
table).
The target genes of TF are less well characterized, compared to protein-protein interactions. For transcription,
TFs bind to specific DNA sequences in the proper orientation, which is influenced by nearby proteins, such as histone or other TFs. While known TF-target gene
relationships from a few databases have been used as positive examples, their number is too limited to constitute a
positive dataset. For example, 51 mammalian target genes
of human JUN protein are recorded in TRANSFAC 10.4
[9], while we have identified 88 in bZIPDB. Hence, several
findings, including TFs, targets, results of transcription
(i.e. activation or repression), binding sequences, binding
positions, and cell lines, have been incorporated in the
database. Moreover, as bZIP TFs often act via homo/hetero-dimerization between family members, the dimerizing partner is included if specified in the literature. The
database statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Another unique aspect of bZIPDB is the compilation of
regulatory information for particular cell lines. Each cell
line originates from different organisms or tissues, which

maintain unique genetic and epigenetic compositions,
hence affecting various cellular interactions. Therefore,
careful consideration is required when data from several

resources are used in conjunction. To clarify the distinctive cellular networks and accuracy of interactions,
bZIPDB provides the list of regulatory interactions conducted in a particular cell type. Table 2 summarizes the
popularly used cell lines and number of interactions listed
in bZIPDB.
In addition to protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction data, genomic information, such as chromosomal
locus and exon/introns, synonyms and functional annotation, was obtained from Entrez [15] and the Gene ontology consortium [16].

Utility and Discussion
bZIPDB provides a convenient search engine with which
users can explore the database either by typing bZIP TF
names within the query box or by clicking on the listed
names (Figure 2A). The known human bZIP TFs are listed
on the 'search bZIPDB' page, according to the alphabetical
order of the official symbol. The 'official symbol' is the
approved gene name by public databases, such as NCBI
and HGNC [17]. Synonyms collected from NCBI and
HGNC are recorded next to the official symbol. On the
input form, users can type in the individual bZIP TF name
(either the official symbol or synonyms). By default, the
results pages return all records in bZIPDB, regardless of
the organism of TF, target gene or cell line. However, users
can restrict the organism category to humans. For convenience, bZIPDB allows searches by simply clicking on the
bZIP TF name with default options.
The results page returns basic information, such as names,
RefSeq ID, chromosomal locus and exon/intron positions
of the bZIP TF protein examined. By clicking on the 'Protein interaction' or 'Target genes' menu on the right side of
the results page, researchers can recover detailed reports
on protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions of bZIP
TF, respectively (Fig. 2B and 2C) to facilitate further analysis. These include official symbol, organism, interaction
type, TF binding sites and positions, cell lines, and

PubMed id, among other information. An external link to
NCBI RefSeq and PubMed is provided for each interaction
and gene. If the organism is not specified in the literature,
it is impossible to ascertain gene identity (RefSeq ID). In
this case, the positions are denoted 'U' (unspecified). A
bZIPDB report of human JUN is shown as an example
(Figs. 2B and 2C). In bZIPDB, 148 protein-protein and 88
protein-DNA interactions are accessible, while 110 protein-protein and 51 protein-DNA interactions are
retrieved from HPRD and TRANSFAC, respectively. Moreover, these two databases do not use official symbols in
the search and result pages, and are therefore difficult to
exploit in terms of bZIP TF analysis. The official symbols
are very important, since they greatly facilitate integration
between various information sources, e.g., microarray and
interaction data. bZIPDB contains more information on
human bZIP TFs than other databases, and is therefore
more useful for the analysis of these proteins.
Interactions within specific cell lines can be viewed on the
'Cellular Network' page (Figure 2D). In total, 12 popular
cell lines are listed. By clicking on the name of the cell
line, researchers may retrieve associated interactions from
the database. The result format is similar to query results
of individual bZIP TF proteins. Data in bZIPDB are available in a tab-delimited format on the 'Download' page.
Interaction data subsets (protein-protein and proteinDNA) are also available in either the tab-delimited or the
simple interaction format (SIF), supported by Cytoscape
[18], a visualization and integration tool.
bZIPDB aims to serve as a portal for researchers studying
the human bZIP TF family. To date, the database has
focused on amassing the relevant literature data. However, the updated version of bZIPDB will provide other
types of data. One data category involves the potential target genes of bZIP TFs, which are computationally predicted using phylogenetic footprinting and motif search
algorithms [19,20]. Another is genome-wide mRNA
expression profiles, which are accumulated in public data-

bases, such as NCBI GEO [21]. Differential expression patterns of bZIP TFs will be collected along with relevant
information, such as experimental conditions and cell
lines. Since integration of interaction data from different
databases is an important issue, collected data will be subjected to the HUPO PSI's molecular interaction format
[22]. Finally, the database will be updated annually.

Conclusion
bZIPDB contains extensive information on human bZIP
TFs, such as manually curated protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, genomic information, synonyms,
and gene ontology. Moreover, this novel database provides classified interaction data for popularly used cell
lines, leading to a clearer picture of the cell type-specific
subnetwork. Thus, bZIPDB constitutes a valuable resource
