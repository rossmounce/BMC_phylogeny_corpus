Abstract
Background: Two outbreaks of the disease contagious ecthyma were reported in 1999 and 2000
in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). Contagious ecthyma is an
epidermal disease of sheep and goats worldwide, which is caused by the zoonotic parapoxvirus orf
virus. Characterisation of clinical samples from the two outbreaks in semi-domesticated reindeer
in Norway by electron microscopy and PCR (B2L) revealed typical parapoxvirus particles and
partial gene sequences corresponding to parapoxvirus, respectively. If contagious ecthyma in
reindeer is caused by orf virus, the virus may be transferred from sheep and goats, via people,
equipment and common use of pastures and corrals, to reindeer. Another possibility is that
contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by a hitherto unclassified member of the parapoxvirus
genus that circulates among reindeer herds and remains endemic in Norway.
Results: Genomic comparisons of one standard orf strain (orf NZ2) and the reindeer isolates,
employing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic
DNA (RAPD) analysis, demonstrated high similarity between the reindeer viruses and known orf
virus strains. Partial DNA sequences of two different viral genes were determined for the different
isolates and compared with corresponding parapoxvirus genebank sequences. The comparison/
alignment and construction of phylogenetic trees also point to an affiliation of the reindeer viruses
to the species orf virus.
Conclusion: The results of this work imply that the parapoxvirus causing contagious ecthyma in
Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer belongs to the species orf virus and that the orf virus
crosses the host species barrier from sheep and goat to semi-domesticated reindeer.

Background
Parapoxviruses (PPVs) (family Poxviridae) cause dermal
diseases most commonly in sheep, goats and cattle [2],
but also in semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus
tarandus) [3] and wildlife, like seals [4], red deer [5] and
squirrels [6]. The genus Parapoxvirus consists of five spe-

cies and three tentative species [7]: Bovine popular stomatitis virus (BPSV), orf virus (ORFV), parapoxvirus of red
deer in New Zealand (PVNZ), pseudocowpox virus
(PCPV), and squirrel parapoxvirus (SPPV), as well as the
tentative species of the genus: auzdyk disease virus, chamois contagious ecthyma virus and sealpox virus.

The first documented outbreak of a contagious ecthymalike disease in Norwegian reindeer, took place in 1976
among experimental animals at the National Reindeer
Research Station in Lødingen [8]. Also human parapoxvirus infections were associated with this outbreak [9]. In
April 1999, the first outbreak in reindeer under regular
herding conditions was reported in Troms County, followed by an outbreak one year later, also in April, in Nordland County. The outbreak in 2000 involved at least 30
out of 150 reindeer, which were corralled and supplementary fed during the winter. Seven of the infected animals
died, due to massive oral cauliflower-like lesions and secondary bacterial infections [1].
In Norway, there are both wild and semi-domesticated
reindeer. The latter is herded over an area of approximately 140.000 km2, which is about 40% of the mainland
area of Norway. Most reindeer herding is conducted by
the Saami people (indigenous people of Scandinavia),
and the most dense reindeer herding area is in Finnmark
county, Northern Norway, where the total number of animals is estimated to be around 140.000 animals (estimate
for 2003 [10]). Semi-domesticated reindeer have seasonal
migrations between winter (usually inland) and summer
(usually coastal areas) pastures, and the pastures are
organised in districts, reducing the contact between animals of different districts. However, sheep and goats also
use the coastal pastures during spring, summer and
autumn, and contact between different animal species is
possible. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to use the
same corrals and transport vehicles for reindeer and
sheep, and remaining scabs from sheep with contagious
ecthyma may as well be a source of infection for reindeer.
Since the disease contagious ecthyma and orf virus is
present among sheep and goats in most parts of the country, it is necessary to characterise the causative agent of
contagious ecthyma in reindeer, in order to find out
whether reindeer have their own parapoxvirus species,
like red deer in New Zealand [5], or whether a transmission of virus between sheep and goats and reindeer is
more likely.
Due to genetic heterogeneity within the genus, classification of PPV remains problematic and relies mostly on the
source of the virus isolate; id est Parapoxviruses isolated
from sheep will be classified as orf virus, virus isolated
from cattle as pseudocowpox [11,12]. However, several
molecular techniques have been used to characterise parapoxviruses. Inoshima et al. [13] reported a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) protocol assumed to be able to
amplify all members of the parapoxvirus genus, based on
primers from the B2L gene encoding a major envelope
protein [14]. The gene region encoding a viral interleukin
10 orthologue (vIL-10) [15] has been used for characterisation, in combination with sequencing of the amplified

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/79

DNA products. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) has also been used to compare parapoxvirus isolates [5,16], and can be conducted both on
genomic DNA as well as on smaller DNA fragments in
combination with PCR. Also random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD) may be used for characterisation purposes, as reported as a useful technique for
comparing orthopoxviruses [17].
The aim of the present study was to characterise the causative agent of contagious ecthyma in semi-domesticated
reindeer in Norway, and to compare this virus with other
parapoxvirus isolates. This information is necessary to be
able to sort out whether reindeer are exposed to orf virus,
which is commonly affecting sheep and goats and also
present among muskoxen in Norway, to bovine papillar
stomatitis virus, which is present among cattle in Norway,
or whether reindeer hosts a specific parapoxvirus species.

Results
Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)
analysis
RFLP patterns by the three restriction endonucleases, Hind
III, Eco R1 and BAM H1 display identical DNA fragment
patterns for orf virus and the parapoxvirus isolated from
semi-domesticated Norwegian reindeer (Figure 1).
Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
analysis
The RAPD patterns of the Finnish (Fi94.1Rt) and the Norwegian (N99.1Rt, N00.1Rt) reindeer isolates are similar to
that of the orf viruses orf 11 and NZ2 and distinct to the
sealpox and pseudocowpox patterns (Figure 2).
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
The vIL-10 PCR and GIF PCR were able to amplify DNA
from all 25 isolates, whereas the B2L PCR did only
amplify DNA from 17 isolates (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analysis
The Bayesian tree based on the the partial sequences of the
B2L-gene (Figure 3) display species specific clustering of
the parapoxvirus-genus.

Six clusters, representing the squirrel parapoxviruses, seal
poxviruses, bovine papular stomatitis virus, pseudocowpoxviruses, parapoxvirus of red deer in New Zealand, and
orf viruses were generated.
The Norwegian reindeer isolates clustered together with
orf virus isolates from different host species and geographical origins. Also the Finnish reindeer isolates from 1992
and 1994 were in conjunction with the orf virus isolates,
whereas more recent Finnish parapoxvirus isolates

Discussion
Based on RFLP patterns obtained from the Norwegian
reindeer isolates and orf NZ2, a close relationship
between these viruses can be assumed (Figure 1). The
RAPD patterns of the reindeer isolates and the standard

in amplification patterns (Figure 2). This similarity is

present in spite of the geographical distance between the
Norwegian isolates and the orf strains originating from
Great Britain and New Zealand.
Further, this work demonstrates that a virus species characterisation based on the nucleotide sequence of the PCRproduct from the B2L-PCR is possible. This characterisation method is easy to perform, because the PCR product
is fast to obtain and to proceed.
The phylogenetic analysis of the partial B2L-gene
sequence from the Norwegian reindeer isolates shows that
these isolates can be allocated to the orf virus species.
However, the clade credibility value of 37 % also demonstrate a close relationship between the two different parapoxvirus species, orf and pseudocowpox virus.
Tikkanen et al. [18] demonstrated the affiliation of parapoxvirus isolates obtained from Finnish semi-domesticated
reindeer during the early outbreaks (1992–1994) in Finland, to the orf virus species and from later outbreaks to
the pseudocowpox viruses, which is congruent with our
results.
The close clustering of the translated sequences obtained
from virus isolated from reindeer (two Norwegian; 1999,
2000, and one Finnish; 1994) with the amino acid
sequences of sheep and goat interleukin 10 demonstrate a

high relationship of the parapoxvirus isolated from reindeer to the main hosts of orf virus (sheep and goat). It
seems that the viral interleukin 10 orthologue of the reindeer isolates is highly adapted to the immune system of
sheep and goats, which also indicates that the reindeer
parapoxvirus belongs to the orf virus species.
Our results indicate that neither geographical distance,
nor crossing the host barrier from sheep or goat to semidomesticated reindeer did affect the characteristics of the
parapoxvirus orf virus investigated in this study.
The B2L PCR has previously been described as a tool to
amplify all species within the parapoxvirus genus [13].
However, we were not able to amplify B2L sequences from
nine of the twenty-five isolates included in our study.
Many members of the subfamily chordopoxvirinae show
genetic rearrangement at the terminal sequences of the
genome, which is thought to be an evolutionary mechanism, allowing the virus to adapt to changes of the
immune response of the host [19]. Parapoxvirus
replicated in vitro show rearrangement of the left terminal
end of the viral genome, resulting in the deletion of three
genes (E2L, E3L, G1L) and 80 % of a fourth one, the G2L
[20-22]. All these four genes play a major role in virulence
and host specificity [23]. The B2L gene is localised beside
the left terminal end of the genome, so that heterogeneity
in the primer binding regions or complete deletion of the

it is to assume that the orf virus crosses the host species
barrier from sheep and goat to semi-domesticated
reindeer.



Sheep and goats in Norway are commonly free-ranging
during the snow-free period, sharing pastures with semidomesticated reindeer. During seasonal migrations and
corralling of animals for slaughter etc. they may also share
fences, transport vehicles and other equipment.
As far as we know, contagious ecthyma is the single disease that has caused the most serious economical losses
for reindeer herders in the Nordic countries in recent
times, and especially so in Finland. Consequently, the
common use of equipment, pastures, transport vehicles
and facilities for semi-domesticated reindeer, sheep and
goats should be avoided, to prevent cross infections.

The outcome of parapoxvirus infections in reindeer seems
to be dependent on many environmental factors in
addition to the exposure to the virus. Certain types of
stress is believed to play a key role, and such stress factors
may be lack of food, as well as handling, corralling and
transport of animals [3,1]. A changing trend in reindeer
herding conditions, facing higher animal densities, faster
movements of animals using helicopter and snow
mobiles, increased use of supplemental feeding and corralling of animals, and increased transport distances to
slaughterhouse may represent factors that can predispose
for contagious ecthyma as well as other diseases in
reindeer.

Methods

can be used for rapid genus-identification. However, the
GIF gene is localised in the right terminal gene region [24]
and may also undergo genetic rearrangements due to
adaptation processes. The GIF gene has so far only been
detected in parapoxviruses [23].
The vIL-10-PCR amplified all tested isolates, but rearrangements of the vIL-10 gene have also been demonstrated, in terms of duplications in the inverted terminal
repeat [25]. Thus, genetic rearrangements may be a problem when designing a PCR that are supposed to detect
parapoxviruses in general. The use of a multiplex PCR,
with a combination of one or more of the gene targets
desribed above, may thus be a solution to this problem.

Conclusion
The results of this work point out that the parapoxvirus
that has caused contagious ecthyma in Norwegian semidomesticated reindeer belongs to the orf virus species, and

Viruses
An overview of the virus isolates included in this study is
given in Table 1. Viruses were purified by metrizamide
gradient centrifugation from homogenised scab material
obtained from Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer
(N99.1Rt, N00.2Rt, N03.8Rt), Finnish semi-domesticated
reindeer (Fi94.1Rt, Fi92.1Rt), Norwegian cattle
(N79.1Bos, N92.1Bos, N83.1Bos, N71.1Bos, N85.1Bos),
Norwegian goat (N02.1Ch, N00.1Ch), Norwegian musk
ox (Ovibos moschatus) (N94.1Om, N86.1Om), Norwegian
sheep (N00.1Oa, N86.1Oa, N86.2Oa, N03.1Oa,
N03.2Oa, N00.2Oa), Scottish grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) (Sc95.1Hg) and Antarctic Weddell seal (Leptonychotes
weddellii) (N03.1Lw) as described previously [26].

The orf virus strain orf 11 was provided by the Moredun
Research institute (Great Britain) and the orf virus strain
NZ2 was derived from a non-attenuated commercial vaccine against contagious ecthyma in sheep (Scabivax®,
Shering-Plough A/S Animal Health, Norway).

Cell culture
Orf viruses NZ2 and orf 11 and the parapoxviruses isolated from Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer
(N00.1Rt, N99.1Rt), Finnish semi-domesticated reindeer
(Fi94.1Rt) and the Scottish grey seal (Sc95.1Hg) were
propagated in Madine-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK;
DSMZ No; ACC 174) cells, which are permissive for parapoxviruses [27]. Cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's MEM
supplemented with 5 % Fetal Bovine Serum and Penicillin
(100 µg/ml)/Streptomycin-solution (100 IU/ml) and
incubated at 37°C with 5 % CO2.
DNA extraction
For the purpose of RFLP and RAPD analysis, viral DNA
was extracted from the cytoplasma of infected cells, using
reducing, non-ionic and proteolytic detergents, as
described in detail by Esposito et al. [28].

For PCR, viral DNA was extracted using QIAamp® DNA
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).
RFLP
Viral DNA was digested for 4 hours with the restriction
enzymes HindIII, EcoRI and BamHI (NEW ENGLAND
BioLabs®Inc., UK). DNA fragments were separated on a
0.6 % agarose gels for 20 hours at 0,6 V/cm.
RAPD
RAPD were conducted with the commercial kit
Ready.To.Go® RAPD Analysis Beads (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Five µl of the RAPD analysis primer no. 6 (5'- CCCGTCAGCA-3') were added to 19
µl of dH2O and 1 µl of template DNA and gently mixed.
The following low stringency cycling profile was used: initial denaturation at 95°C for 4 min, followed by 45 cycles
consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at
36°C for 1 min, and elongation at 72°C for 2 min. DNA
fragments were separated on a 2 % agarose gel at 7,5 V/cm
for 2,5 hours.
PCR
Three different PCR protocols were performed as specified
below:
B2L-PCR
Inoshima et.al. [13] describe a PCR specific for the detection of all parapoxviruses, resulting in the amplification of
theoretically a 594 bp product. The primers (PPP 1 and
PPP 4) are based on the B2L gene sequence of the orf virus
strain NZ2. The B2L gene encode a homologue of the vaccinia virus major envelope antigen p37K gene [29]. PCR
was carried out as described by Inoshima et al. [16] with
the exception that 5 % dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was
added to the reaction mix as a PCR enhancer.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/79

GIF-PCR
The Granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) and Interleukin-2 inhibition factor (GIF) is
found only in parapoxviruses, and represents an important virulence factor [24]. Amplification of parts of the GIF
gene may thus be useful, both for detection of parapoxvirus DNA in tissue samples and for virus species differentiation. The GIF PCR primers (GIF 5 → 5'-gct cta gga aag atg
gcg tg-3' GIF 6 → 5'-gta ctc ctg gct gaa gag cg -3'),
generating amplicons of approximately 408 bp, were
obtained from the published sequence of the orf virus GIF
gene (Genebank accession number AF192803.1; Deane et
al., 2000) and selected by the online tool "GeneFisher"
[30].

Five µl template DNA were added to 45 µl of the PCR reaction mixture containing 0.2 mM primers (GIF 5 and GIF
6), 200 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 U of
AmpliTaq® Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems,
Norway). DNA was amplified with a DNA Thermal Cycler
PE9700 (Perkin Elmer) by a two-step cycling reaction as
follows: 95°C for 15 min, and five cycles of 94°C for 30
sec, 57°C for 2 min and 72°C for 30 sec, and then 35
cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 57°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30
sec, followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min.
The resulting PCR product was examined by
electrophoresis, using a 1,2 % agarose gel, containing
0,005 % ethidium bromide, with a separation time of 1,5
hours at 6,5 V/cm.
vIL-10 PCR
The viral interleukin 10 orthologue [15] need to have a
close similarity to the IL-10 of the host for effective virus
propagation. PCR targeting this gene may be useful for
genus affiliation, and nucleotide sequencing of the PCR
amplicon followed by virtual translation to the protein
sequence may be suitable for virus characterisation.

Primers (vIL-10-3 → 5'-atg cta ctc aca cag tcg ctc c-3', vIL10-4 → 5'-tat gtc gaa ctc gct cat ggc c-3') were obtained
from consensus sequences previously reported to
Genebank (accession numbers OVU82239; [31],
OVU60552; [32], AY231116.1; [33], AY186733.1; [34],
AY186732; [34]) and selected by the online tool "GeneFisher[30]. The expected length of the resulting amplicon
is approximately 300 bp. The reaction mixture, cycling
profile and agarose gel analysis was conducted as
described for the GIF PCR.
Nucleotide sequencing
The resulting amplicons of the B2L, GIF and vIL-10 PCR
were prepared for nucleotide sequencing by enzymatic
removal of unused dNTP and primers (ExoSAP-IT™;
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). The enzyme

preparation (0,5 µl; ExoSAP-IT™) was added directly to
6,5 µl of the PCR product and incubated at 37°C for 1
hour. ExoSAP-IT™ was inactivated by heating to 80°C for
15 minutes. After the clean-up procedure the sequencing
protocol for the BigDye®Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing
kit (Applied Biosystems, Norway) was performed. Seven
µl of the purified PCR product was mixed with 4 µl "Ready
Reaction Premix", 2 µl sequencing-buffer, 3,2µl of 20 µM
Primer solution, 1 µl DMSO and 2,8 µl dH2O. This mixture was thermal cycled 25 times at 96°C for 10 seconds,
50°C for 5 seconds and 60°C for 4 minutes. DNA was
precipitated with ethanol and the sequence was determined with the "ABI PRISM 377 Genetic Analyser"
(Applied Biosystems, Norway).
Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignment of the 379 nucleotide long
partial B2L-sequence was conducted using CLUSTAL X
(version 1.81; [35]) and phylogenetic analysis was performed by Bayesian Analysis using MrBayes [36] with the
following settings. The maximum likelihood model
employed 2 substitution types ("nst = 2"), with base frequencies set to the empirically observed values ("basefreq
= empirical"). Rate variation across sites was modelled
using a gamma distribution (rates="gamma"). The
Markov chain Monte Carlo search was run with 4 chains
for 500000 generations, with trees begin sampled every
100 generations (the first 1000 trees were discarded as
"burnin").
