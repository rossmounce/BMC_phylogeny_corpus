Abstract
Background: A modification of a standard method of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) is
described, by which a combination of several substrates and probes on single microscope slides
enables more accurate comparisons of the distribution and abundance of chromosomal sequences
and improves the relatively low throughput of standard FISH methods.
Results: The utility and application of multi-colour, multi-substrate FISH is illustrated by the
simultaneous physical mapping of retrotransposon sequences to three species of Avena, and single
locus BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) clones and rDNA probes to three species of
Brachypodium, demonstrating how this would enable better understanding of complex phylogenetic
relationships among some of the species belonging to these two genera.
Conclusion: The results show that use of multi-substrate chromosome preparations significantly
increases the utility of FISH in comparative analyses of the distribution and abundance of
chromosomal sequences in closely related plant species.

Background
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) is used extensively and routinely in plant genome analysis (an excellent kaleidoscope of representative papers describing
relevant techniques has recently been published [1]). It is
particularly useful for applications such as comparing
genome organisation in series of species or accessions
(e.g. [2,3]) or identifying introgressions (e.g. [4,5]) where
relatively large numbers of samples may be desirable. A
major limitation in such studies is the low capacity of
FISH methods, especially when compared to the high
throughput of complementary molecular methods, such

as Southern hybridisation and PCR. This limitation is further exacerbated by the need to make a number of duplicate experiments to control for variation between slides
when comparing differential FISH signals. An approach
that has been widely though infrequently used for comparative FISH is to combine substrates on a single slide
[4,6-8]. Although far more exacting controls are required
for accurate quantification [9], this approach does
enhance reproducibility and allows a greater number of
samples to be processed per slide. Here we present an
optimised, combined substrate method suitable for both
monocot and dicot plant species.

Results and discussion
Two factors were found to be of critical importance for the
success of multi-substrate hybridisation experiments,
namely the conditions used for enzymatic digest of each
species and the conditions used for placing the substrates
onto slides. Provided that these conditions are optimised,
we find that separate distribution of the various substrates
can be reliably achieved, allowing comparison even of
samples with similar or identical karyotypes (such as A.
agadiriana and A. murphyi in Fig. 1a, b). The optimal time
of enzymatic digestion is that which allows intact meristems to be easily extruded from the root tip. Shorter times
prevent complete removal of surrounding tissues such as
root epiderm and calyptra, which compromise the quality
of the chromosome spread, while longer times may result
in disintegration of meristems and subsequent dispersal
of chromosomes across the slide when cover slips are
applied. Optimal digest times must be established for
each species separately.
It is also necessary to transfer each of the substrates in a
small volume, no more than 4 µl, and to dispense them so
that each substrate is approximately the same distance
from the nearest edge of the cover slip (i.e. for three samples, in the form of triangle as shown in Fig. 1j, for four
samples, in the form of a rhombus). These arrangements
minimise displacement and possible loss of material
when applying the cover slip. We found 24 mm × 24 mm
cover slips most suitable for making triple-substrate preparations. It is difficult to achieve well distributed but nonoverlapping spreads of samples if smaller cover slips are
used, while use of longer, rectangular cover slips impedes
even spreading of acetic acid, frequently leading to incorporation of air bubbles.
Triple substrate chromosome preparation of Avena
Cultivated oat, Avena sativa, is a hexaploid made up of two
genomes (A and D) which are closely related, plus a third
(C) that may be easily distinguished from the first two by
GISH (genomic in situ hybridisation) using total nuclear
DNA from wild Avena species. The A and D genomes have
only recently been distinguished by FISH [10] and it is of
interest to clarify their relationship to genomes of wild
species. Root tip meristems from three different species of
Avena (the allotetraploids A. agadiriana, A. murphyi and
the allohexaploid A. sterilis) were used for triple substrate
chromosome preparations and subjected to multicolour
FISH with a mixture of three retrotransposon sequences.
Probe KK2.5 (yellow/orange fluorescence) is restricted to
centromeric regions of chromosomes belonging to both
of the two genomes in A. agadiriana (Fig. 1a), one of the
two genomes in A. murphyi (Fig. 1b) and two of the three
genomes in A. sterilis (Fig. 1c). Probe KK3.4 (green fluorescence) labels intensely only one of the two genomes in
A. agadiriana (Fig. 1a), to a slightly lesser extent, one of the

two genomes in A. murphyi (Fig. 1b), and one of the three
genomes in A. sterilis (Fig. 1c). Probe KK4.24 (red fluorescence) is totally absent from the chromosomes of A. agadiriana (Fig. 1a) but paints intensively the chromosomes
of one genome in both A. murphyi (Fig. 1b) and in A. ster-

ilis (Fig. 1c). Thus, A. agadiriana is seen to be an AB tetraploid and lacks the C-genome specific KK4.24 target, and
A. sterilis is an ACD hexaploid, with the A and D genomes
differentiated by the KK3.4 probe. The use of multi-substrate FISH allows an accurate comparison to be made of
the extent of hybridisation of the KK3.4 probe, so that it
can easily be seen that the non-C genome in A. murphyi
shows levels of the KK3.4 target intermediate between the
A. sterilis A and D genomes, indicating that it is not a
recent progenitor of A. sterilis or, by extension, cultivated
hexaploid oat.
Triple substrate chromosome preparation of
Brachypodium
Wild tetraploid and hexaploid accessions of B. distachyon
were found which formed a series based upon 2n = 2x =
10, and were proposed to be autopolyploids [11]. However, our comparative GISH analyses [12] indicated that
accession ABR113 is in fact an allotetraploid containing
two genomes similar or identical to those in two diploid
species previously described as ABR1 and ABR114 accessions of B. distachyon. Multiple substrate FISH allowed us
to investigate this further. Figure 1d-i shows distribution
of selected clones of a B. distachyon BAC library landed in
chromosomes of B. distachyon and two closely related species. The 41-A8 clone (green fluorescence) hybridises to
the distal part of one arm of the largest and metacentric
pair of chromosomes in the complement, while 59-F9
(red fluorescence) gives well defined signals in the proximal and pericentromeric part of the same arm. The 47-F4
clone (purple pseudocolour) maps to the distal part of the
short arm on small subterminal chromosomes, while the
25S ribosomal DNA probe (yellow fluorescence) gives
prominent hybridisation signals in the distal part of the
short arm on the shortest pair of chromosomes in the
complement. Strikingly, apart from the rDNA probe, the
BAC DNA-based probes do not hybridise to ABR114 chromosomes (Fig. 1e), while the results observed in ABR113
(Fig. 1f) are the perfect amalgam of those obtained separately for B. distachyon ABR1 and for ABR114.

Two further clones, 41-E10 (green fluorescence) and 1-H3
(red fluorescence), hybridise to the interstitial regions of
two different arms of the second largest and metacentric
pair of chromosomes in the complement of B. distachyon
ABR1 (Fig. 1g). In ABR114, the same clones map subterminally in two different pairs of chromosomes (Fig. 1h),
while in ABR113 (Fig. 1i), as in the case of the BAC clones
described above (Fig. 1f), the number and chromosomal
distribution of BAC-FISH signals makes the sum of the
results obtained for B. distachyon ABR1 and for ABR114,
which further confirms putative allotetraploid status of
the accession ABR113.

Conclusion
The main aim of this study was to develop a method of
chromosome preparation that would improve the efficiency of FISH as a technique for comparing closely
related species in genera such as Avena and Brachypodium.
Our results show that multi-substrate preparations may
offer not only significantly higher throughput but also
better reproducibility and reliability of semi-quantitative
comparisons of signal intensity than routinely used single-substrate chromosome preparations, especially when
hybridised simultaneously to several DNA probes in multicolour FISH experiments. This improvement in efficiency has allowed us to use FISH as an alternative to
some molecular analyses, for example in screening repetitive sequences for potential species-specific variation in
distribution, and so will accelerate studies aimed at understanding the evolution of complex plant genomes.

Methods
Plant material
Seeds of Avena agadiriana (2n = 4x = 28; genome AABB),
A. murphyi (2n = 4x = 28; genome AACC), A. sterilis (2n =
6x = 42; genome AACCDD) were from the IGER, UK collection; Brachypodium distachyon ABR1 (2n = 2x = 10),
Brachypodium ssp. ABR114 (2n = 2x = 20) and ABR113 (2n
= 4x = 30) were from the seed collection of the University
of Wales Aberystwyth, UK.
Chromosome preparation
Seeds were germinated on moist filter paper in Petri
dishes at 20–22°C. Whole seedlings with roots about 2
cm long were immersed in ice-cold water for 24 hours, followed by fixation in 3:1 methanol – glacial acetic acid and
stored at -20°C until required. After several 5 minute
washes in 0.01 M citric acid – sodium citrate buffer (pH
4.8), excised roots were digested enzymatically at 37°C in
a mixture comprising 1% (w/v) cellulase (Calbiochem),
1% (w/v) cellulase ''Onozuka R-10'' (Serva) and 20% (v/
v) pectinase (Sigma) for 2 h and 40 min (Avena) and 2 h
(Brachypodium).

Meristems of three different species of Avena or Brachypodium were dissected from root tips in separate containers
containing 45% acetic acid. The number of meristems
used depended upon root tip size, with a single meristem
being taken for each Avena species compared to three for
each Brachypodium species. Meristems for each individual
species were carefully transferred in a small (about 3 µl)
volume of 45% acetic acid and arranged on a slide in the
form of a triangle (Fig. 1j). A 24 mm × 24 mm coverslip
was carefully applied to the slide. After squashing and
freezing, coverslips were removed and the preparations
were briefly post-fixed in a pre-chilled (-20°C) 3:1 ethanol:glacial acetic acid mix followed by dehydration in
absolute ethanol and air drying. The distribution and

quality of each of the three substrates on the slide were
examined under a phase contrast microscope.
DNA probes
Probe templates were derived from clones of fragments
from three different Avena retrotransposon families [13],
unpublished), from a 2.3-kb ClaI sub-clone of the 25S
rDNA coding region of A. thaliana [14], or from five different bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones selected
from BAC libraries of B. distachyon ABR1 and ABR5 15.

Image acquisition and processing
Images were taken using a Hamamatsu C5810 colour
CCD camera attached to an Olympus Provis AX microscope or Hamamatsu ORCA monochromatic CCD camera attached to a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence
microscope, and colours assigned using Wasabi software
(Hamamatsu Photonics). All images were processed uniformly and superimposed using Picture Publisher software (Micrografx/Corel).

Authors' contributions
Probes were made by single-primer PCR labeling of PCR
fragments from plasmid templates (probes KK2.5, KK3.4,
KK4.24) or by nick translation of plasmids (BAC clones
and 25S rDNA). Briefly, for PCR labelling, the probe template was generated by 18 cycles of PCR. The PCR reaction
was then diluted approximately one hundred-fold with
fresh reaction mixture containing a single primer and
either tetramethyl-rhodamine-5-dUTP (Roche) or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche), and reamplified for a further 11
cycles. Combinatorial probes (yellow fluorescence) were
subsequently made by combining probes amplified with
both labels. For better visualisation of the 47-F4 clone
probe (originally visualised by green fluorescence)
pseudo-colouring to purple was used (Fig. 1d and 1f).

R.H. and T.L. designed and executed the laboratory work
as well as drafted the manuscript. J.D. participated in
planning and execution of the molecular cytogenetic work
on Avena species. G.J. and M.L. participated in planning
the study and contributed in writing the manuscript. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Fluorescence in situ hybridisation
FISH was carried out as described previously [12]. Briefly,
each PCR-based probe to be hybridised with Avena chromosomes was mixed to a final concentration of 2–4 ng/µl
in a hybridisation mixture containing: 50% deionised formamide, 2× SSC, 10% (w/v) dextran sulphate, 10 µg/µl
sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 0.5% SDS. For BACFISH in Brachypodium, formamide concentration was
reduced to 30%. The probes were denatured separately in
hybridisation mixtures (80°C for 10 min), applied to the
preparations and denatured combinatorially (70°C for
4.5 min). Hybridisation was carried out for 12–20 h in a
humid chamber at 37°C. For Avena preparations, posthybridisation washes were carried out for 10 min either in
10% deionised formamide in 0.1× SSC at 42°C (equivalent to 79% stringency) or, for Brachypodium, in 20%
deionised formamide in 2× SSC at 37°C (equivalent to
59% stringency). The digoxigenated probes were immunodetected according to standard protocol using FITC-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche). Finally,
preparations were mounted and counterstained in
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing 2.5 µg/ml of
4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). In order to discriminate better the whole chromosome set painted by
probe KK3.4 (green fluorescence in Fig. 1a–c), original
blue DAPI fluorescence was converted to grey.
