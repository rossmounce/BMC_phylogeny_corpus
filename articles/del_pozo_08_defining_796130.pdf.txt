Abstract
Background: A fundamental problem when trying to define the functional relationships between
proteins is the difficulty in quantifying functional similarities, even when well-structured ontologies
exist regarding the activity of proteins (i.e. 'gene ontology' -GO-). However, functional metrics can
overcome the problems in the comparing and evaluating functional assignments and predictions. As
a reference of proximity, previous approaches to compare GO terms considered linkage in terms
of ontology weighted by a probability distribution that balances the non-uniform 'richness' of
different parts of the Direct Acyclic Graph. Here, we have followed a different approach to quantify
functional similarities between GO terms.
Results: We propose a new method to derive 'functional distances' between GO terms that is
based on the simultaneous occurrence of terms in the same set of Interpro entries, instead of
relying on the structure of the GO. The coincidence of GO terms reveals natural biological links
between the GO functions and defines a distance model Df which fulfils the properties of a Metric
Space. The distances obtained in this way can be represented as a hierarchical 'Functional Tree'.
Conclusion: The method proposed provides a new definition of distance that enables the
similarity between GO terms to be quantified. Additionally, the 'Functional Tree' defines groups
with biological meaning enhancing its utility for protein function comparison and prediction. Finally,
this approach could be for function-based protein searches in databases, and for analysing the gene
clusters produced by DNA array experiments.

Background
Current genome sequencing projects are producing a
wealth of data in the form of sequences of biological polymers. For this data to be useful, it has to be interpreted in
functional terms. Thus, efficient systems to describe and
classify protein function are needed, as well as tools to
predict the function of the huge number of new
sequences.

There is much evidence for the need of well-defined and
structured functional descriptions [1-4]. However, the
main difficulty encountered is that 'function' is not a well
defined concept and it is not as un-equivocal as 'sequence'
or 'structure'. Indeed, protein function is a very complex
and multidimensional phenomenon.
In many cases, functional descriptors are based on the
available experimental techniques or are due to historical

reasons. However, they do not necessarily have any meaning in biological terms (evolution, molecular mechanism). The methods we use to study biological systems
require conceptualization and categorization, which are
sometimes taken beyond their role as mere tools of the
scientific method and are 'imposed' on the cell. One
example is the artificial distinction between processes
such as 'transmission of information' (for example DNA/
RNA processing), 'metabolism' (of small compounds)
and 'transport' (communication with the environment).
Such disjointed classifications, as used in the first schemes
to describe protein function, clearly do not extend to the
molecular or evolutionary level. These schemes have been
used in the past for classifying proteins into functional
classes and for developing systems to assign newly
sequenced proteins to them [5,6].
The current tendency is to use vocabularies and ontologies
that allow complex functional descriptions beyond disjointed classes. Among these, the important effort of the
Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) [7] in developing
controlled vocabularies for a wide scope of applications in
a biological and medical context must be recognised. The
OBO ontologies are designed as graphic architectures
formed by univocal concepts (terms) that are linked
together by relationships that satisfy some prefixed and
formal rules [8]. The Gene Ontology (GO) project [9] has
become the 'de-facto' standard in biomedical ontologies.
Formally, GO is designed as a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)
based on two unconstrained relationships ('is-a' and 'partof') that link a vocabulary of functional terms [2]. This
graph structure, together with the simple conceptualization, permits comparisons between any two GO terms to
assess their functional similarity. However, certain problems, such as the function-based search for potential
genes/proteins of interest across multiple annotated databases and the analysis of high throughput microarray
data, have led to the in depth exploration of ontology in
order to propose models and criteria to measure the functional relationships between the terms.
In recent years, many studies have addressed this matter
[10-14], although Lord was the first to establish a semantic distance for any two terms in GO [10], adjusting the
ideas of Resnik [15] for general taxonomies. In the model
proposed by Lord, the similarity of any two GO terms is
determined as a function of the information content of
common ancestors that are calculated from corpus statistics. Recently, further efforts to identify functionally
related gene products in annotated databases based on the
distances calculated by Lord [11] have been shown to produce a good agreement with homology searches [12].
Nevertheless, using the more informative common ancestors as a proximity reference presents some restrictions.
First, the depth of the shared parent nodes is not a suitable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/50

criteria for some limited cases in which the terms to be
compared are close to the root. Furthermore, the information content (i.e. probability) of a node is highly dependent on the annotated database selected and its release
version.
Models have been developed to overcome these limitations that take into account other aspects of the ontology
structure. For example, the distance between two terms
may also integrate the density of the terms and the path
that links them [13]. Alternatively, a new definition has
been used that considers the local relationships in the
subgraph generated by the terms, rather than their global
positions in the DAG [14].
A common feature of these different approaches is that
they rely mainly on the semantic links of the DAG. Unfortunately, there are inherent problems in this approach due
to the non-homogeneity and the uneven distribution of
the biological knowledge. As a result some regions of the
DAG are more densely populated than others, so that the
connections between terms are not comparable. In addition, the depth of a node (which is related to its specificity) can not be assigned in an unequivocal way. This type
of problem is especially relevant for nodes that are profusely connected to the root by various paths of different
lengths.
In this work, we propose a novel method that associates
the Molecular Function GO (MF-GO) terms based on
their co-occurrences in a 'curated' set of proteins and
enriched by the semantic relationships from the ontology.
Interpro is used as a curated database as it integrates protein information from other databases that describe protein families, domains and functional sites, such as
PROSITE, PRINTS, Pfam, ProDom, SMART and
TIGRFAMs [16].
Conceptually, the method is, to some extend, similar to
the way in which similarities between aminoacids are
'learnt' from examples (structural curated alignments)
rather than obtained from the raw chemical properties of
the aminoacids. Methodologically, it shares aspects of the
algorithm used in the DAVID tool [17] for clustering heterogeneous annotation contents from different resources
into annotation groups based on the co-association of the
annotated genes in the databases.
The method analyses the mutual occurrences of the MFGO terms across the Interpro entries. The occurrences are
used as the basis of the comparison of the terms on the
assumption that the persistent coincidence of two terms
describes its 'relation' in the general functional space. The
analysis of the occurrences provides a useful mathematical tool to quantify the functional similarity between

terms. A hierarchical tree linking the MF-GO terms is built
from the similarity matrix. We termed this tree the 'Functional Tree' and it formally constitutes a Distance Model
since it satisfies the ultrametric triangle inequality. In this
context, the Functional Distance for a pair of terms, Df, is
defined as the height of their least common ancestor in
the 'Functional Tree'. In addition, the tree allows the GO
terms to be clustered into compact and homogeneous
groups with biological meaning.

groups were obtained by the clustering of S. Full details of
the Similarity matrix calculus are available in the Methods
section. Finally we applied a Spectral Clustering algorithm
[20,21] as it performs a dimensional reduction of the data
(Figure 1, box 4). The general ideas behind Spectral Clustering methods are introduced in the 'Spectral Clustering'
subsection from the appendix. This approach improved
the search for functional groups in the MF-GO terms
space.

We describe here how the Functional Tree was built, how
the tree is clustered and the groups generated are analyzed
in terms of the functions they describe. The Functional
Distance Df derived from the Functional Tree was used to
calculate the distances between pairs of yeast proteins to
assess the reliability of the tree. We also compare this new
metric with another based on semantic similarities.

Spectral Clustering considers S as the Adjacency Matrix of
a normalized weighted graph G, where the nodes stand for
the MF-GO terms linked by the similarity values. Thus, the
clustering problem is transformed into a partitioning
graph problem. We only considered the graph comprised
of terms that were connected with significant relationships, that is those connected by a pairwise similarity
greater than a manually selected threshold value (see
Methods, 'Similarity Matrix' subsection). After imposing
this constraint, we obtained 995 MF-GO terms from the
total of approximately 7500 terms integrated in the
released version of this work.

Results
Algorithm
The steps followed to obtain the Metric Model are schematically represented in Figure 1.

First, for each Molecular Function term we create a profile
vector that represents its presence/absence in different
Intepro entries (Figure 1, box 1). These vectors resemble
the 'phylogenetic profiles' used to encode the proteins
present in different organisms and to detect protein relationships [18,19].
Initially, we started with 1532 MF-GO terms present in
5535 Intepro entries. Additionally, we included the
semantic relationships represented by the Gene Ontology
DAG by assigning the same Interpro domain to the parent(s) of a given GO term. The profiles were checked to
detect the terms that were associated exclusively to one
Interpro entry and to ensure that this entry was not annotated with any other term. Any such profiles were removed
because they do not help to extract relationships between
the terms. After filtering, we obtained a matrix of 1778
Interpro entries with 1392 MF-GO terms. In a second step
(Figure 1, box 2), we built a matrix of co-occurrences of
GO terms in Interpro entries. The occurrences were accumulated through all the profiles and we obtained the total
mutual occurrences in the universe of the 1392 terms.
Each co-occurrence vector describes a MF-GO term in relation to the rest of the MF-GO terms, which enables it to be
used as a feature vector in the application of statistical
learning techniques.
Third, the similarity between the terms was calculated
using the cosine distance between their corresponding cooccurrence vectors (Figure 1, box 3). The similarity matrix
S was obtained by crossing the vectors all-against-all (as
graphically represented in Figure 2A) and the functional

We have also considered the NJW adaptation of Spectral
Clustering (NJM-SC) by Ng, Jordan and Weiss [21], which
is summarized in the general scheme in Figure 3 (see the
'NJW Spectral Clustering Algorithm' subsection from the
appendix). The algorithm calculates a Transition Probability Matrix, P, from a N Ã N Similarity matrix, S, that represents the probability of transit from one node to
another in the graph. P is diagonalized and its K first
eigenvectors are stacked and normalized in a new K Ã K
matrix, Y. The rows of Y can be treated as N vectors K
dimensional. Therefore, NJM-SC projects the MF-GO
terms (nodes of G) onto points in a K dimensional space.
Subsequently, the terms can be grouped with any standard clustering technique. K was thus selected as the
number of clusters in the optimum partition of G. The
optimization procedure is presented in detail in the Methods section. The resulting number of optimal groups was
93.
Finally, from the vector projections of the MF-GO terms,
we built a dendrogram with an Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm [22] (Figure 1, box 5). The tree
obtained ('Functional Tree') defines a distance Df between
any two MF-GO terms from the set of 995 (see Additional
file 1). The distance for two terms was the minimum
height of their common nodes. From a mathematical
point of view, Df satisfies the topological properties that
induces a metric space (see 'Properties of a Metric Space'
from the appendix). So, the metric generated by the Functional Tree establishes a 'distance scheme' that provides a
measure of the closeness of any two MF-GO terms within
the tree.

Scheme of the method used for obtaining the Metric Model based on Gene Ontology annotations. (1) Profile vectors are built
by retrieving the Molecular Function Gene Ontology annotations (MF-GO terms) of Interpro domains from the file
interpro2go. (2) From the profiles, a co-occurrence matrix is calculated by counting how many times two MF-GO terms occur
in the same set of Interpro domains. (3) The co-occurrence vectors are feature vectors that describe the functional links of
each MF-GO term. The similarity between the MF-GO terms is calculated by the cosine distance between the vectors. (4) The
similarity values are arranged in a matrix S. The similarity matrix was considered as the Adjacency Matrix of a weighted graph
G. The terms can be clustered by means of the partition of the graph. To obtain the best partition of G, a Spectral Clustering
algorithm is applied. The Spectral Clustering algorithm projects the terms in a K dimensional space which can be clustered with
standard clustering techniques. (5) The GO terms are grouped in a Hierarchical Tree representing the Functional Distance Df
that satisfy the mathematical properties of a Metric Space.

Testing
Functional Groups
The nodes of the Functional Tree are divided into groups
imposing the number of clusters obtained in the optimization step. The 93 groups of Molecular Function terms

are inspected and 20 groups with highly homogeneous
biological function are detected. In the Functional Tree
(Figure 4, see Additional file 1), the functionally homogeneous groups are coloured and ranked, and the labels
assigned are shown with their rank number.

Some of these groups were very specific, like the group
containing the 21 amino acyl-tRNA ligase activities. This
group includes all the tRNA ligases and no other GO term,
and hence the automatic clustering algorithm achieved a
perfect segregation of this functional group (group 2).
Another big group mostly composed by activities related
to hydrolysis (hydrolases, peptidases, nucleases, lipases)
was labelled as group 1. Although this group was homogeneous for this activity, the coverage was not perfect since
other hydrolases lay outside of this group. For example,
group 7, which was far from group 2 in the tree, was
mainly comprised of peptidase activities.
Interestingly, many different activities associated with
DNA processing tended to cluster together despite the fact
that they were apparently unrelated (i.e.: transcription factors and enzymes involved in DNA metabolism, DNA
ligases, topoisomerases, etc... â group 3). As for the hydrolases case commented above, although this group contained only DNA-related activities and other DNA-related
functional terms were not included in this group.
Most of the kinases of small metabolic compounds were
clustered in a large group (group 15), while protein
kinases were more widespread even though some of them
clustered together in group 6. Many membrane transporters of apparently different nature (transporters for inor-

ganic ions, drugs, proteins, etc...) were also clustered
together in homogeneous groups.
All the 'protein inhibitor' activities within the dataset were
clustered together in a homogeneous group (group 20),
which is interesting given that the proteins they inhibit are
of a very different nature (phos-phatases, ribonucleases,
proteases, etc...).
Functional clustering was also evident for many other GO
terms: methyl-transferases, phosphorybo-syltransferases,
peptidases, some peptidic hormones, neurotransmitter
receptors,
phosphate-hydrolases,
hy-dratases/dehydrateses, adenylyltransferases, etc....
For other clusters, this functional 'homogeneity' was not
so evident. For example, oxidoreductases were spread
across many groups even though some groups contained
oxidoreductase activities only (group 19). This dispersion
could be explained by the fact that this function is present
in proteins with a very different evolutionary origin. Similarly, activities related to RNA metabolism were spread
among the different clusters, except the tRNA-ligases discussed above.
In general, the clustering represented by the tree makes
sense, meaning that GO molecular functions that are intuitively 'similar' were close in the tree and vice versa. This

distance between the vectors of the co-occurrence matrix. The similarity matrix S = [sij] is treated as a real-value adjacency
matrix of the graph. Let P be a normalized matrix named the Transition Probability matrix that represents the probability of
transit from one node to another in this weighted graph. P is calculated from S. The first K eigenvalues of P are used to map the
nodes of the graph to a K-dimensional space and the points in this reduced space can be grouped by any clustering algorithm.
In this work, we have applied a hierarchical clustering algorithm.

The Functional Tree as Metric Model
The functional distance Df defined from the Functional
Tree allows a new quantitative analysis of the functional
relationship between gene products. To assess Df as a functional similarity measure we correlated sequence and
annotated function similarity over a set of aligned pairs of
yeast proteins. The benchmark set has been selected by
applying a very restrictive criterion to obtain a high reliable set of annotated proteins. The selection process (see
Methods section) takes as quality assay the evidence codes
in GOA. In this work, we picked only those sequences that

had been functionally characterized either by experimental assay (IDA evidence code) or by traceable published
works (TAS evidence code) and whose GO terms were
included in our functional tree.
The functional distance between proteins (through their
sets of annotated terms) is calculated using the hausdorff
definition. The details are exposed in the 'Functional
Comparison between Gene Products' subsection from
Methods. The distance values are represented against the
sequence similarity (Figure 5A). Lord semantic similarity
Ds was also implemented and represented in Figure 5B.
Note that the Lord distance values are normalised in order

to analize the metric derived in this work with respect to
Lord's model.
To compare the models the mean distance values for each
bin of sequence identity are superposed in figure 5C. In
average, both approaches correlate well with sequence
similarity and exhibit a similar trend for homologous
pairs. This is partly due to the homology-based mechanism of annotation that transfers directly a source set of
MF-GO terms to many homologous sequences.
In consequence, more than 84% of the alignments with
sequence similarity values greater than 80% share the
same annotations. This lack of richness in the annotations
limits further analysis of the methods. However, we can
observe that Df and Ds show a different behavior. The distance space is discretized into three well-defined groups
(Figure 5A) whereas the semantic similarity values produced a great spread.
These natural 'cut-offs' allow classifying the pairs into
three categories with biological meaning that can be
roughly labelled as 'closely functionally related' (distances
less than 0.1), 'not related at all' (more than 0.9) and

'divergence in functionality' (in the intermediate interval
with distances between 0.5 and 0.7). This partition results
from the structure of the clusters (Figure 6B) showing
small intra-group and large intergroup distances. This is in
part due to 'biological' reasons but is also affected by the
function transfer by sequence homology.
The repetitive and persistent presence of the same MF-GO
terms in the Intepro domains indicates clear functional
associations of the terms but it is also originated by the
usage of a reduced set of annotations producing redundancy in the functional information of the sequences and
low coverage with respect to the total number of terms in
the ontology (1532 from a total of 7417 MF-GO terms).
In addition, the Functional Distance Model Df becomes
very useful from the perspective of recovering proteins
functionally similar to a query, as it provides new associations between the terms inferred from the homology
information in the database entries. These new links
enrich the ontology relationships among the terms. This is
the case of group 3 (analized in the 'Functional Groups'
from Testing section) whose MF-GO terms are spread
across different lineages of the ontology involving DNA-

two paths that connect them, and the least common ancestor is the node GO:0030528 ('transcription regulator activity') one

the Functional Distance is close to 0.

related activities. These associations are very visible in
many Pfam domains (Hormone receptor, Sigma-70 factor, Ets-domain, HSF-DNA binding, GATA-type transcription activator etc ...) but are not detected with a criteria
based on the semantic proximity of the terms. Group 3 is
partially represented in Figure 7 showing the relations of
some terms in the ontology. Some terms of the group,
such as 'DNA binding' and 'specific transcriptional repressor activity', are very distant in the DAG and share the root
as common ancestor. This produces a semantic distance of
1. Other terms like 'transcription factor activity' and 'DNA
replication origin binding' share the node 'DNA binding'
that is three levels apart from to the root.
The benchmark set includes some example pairs in which
Df assigns close distances to functionally related pairs
while Ds does not. One is the pair formed by [Uniprot:P20134] and [Uniprot:P10961] that shares 50%
sequence identity. The first is a transcriptional repressor
and activator annotated with the term GO:0016566 ('specific transcriptional repressor activity'). The second is a
trimeric heat shock transcription factor annotated with
GO:0003700 ('transcription factor activity'). Both are
characterized by HSF-type DNA-binding Pfam domain.
The relative posititions of their annotated terms in the
DAG can be checked in Figure 7. Ds is 0.76 indicating a
weak relation between the proteins. However, Df situates
the pair into the 'closely functionally related' region
because the terms belong to the cluster 3 described before.
Other similar example is the pair formed by the protein
kinases [Uniprot:P32801] and [Uniprot:P41808]. The
proteins are characterized by protein kinase pfam domain
and are annotated respectively with GO:0004674 ('protein serine/threonine kinase activity') and GO:0004707
('MAP kinase activity'). Both terms belong to group 6
(Functional Groups subsection). So, as in the example
before, the distance Df is 0 whereas Ds is 0.6. Although
these terms are close in the ontology ('protein serine/threonine kinase activity' is ancestor of 'MAP kinase activity'
and separated only by two depth levels), the Lord model
assigns such a value distance because the shared parent
('protein serine/threonine kinase activity') is referred
many times in the gene association.goa human file.
According to Lord definition, high probable terms carry
low information content producing high distance values
in the comparison of terms. In the case of the kinases pair,
the probability introduces a bias that shifts the semantic
distance value to a region that indicates, as the example
before, a weak relation between the proteins.
Finally, the Functional Distance model is sensitive
enough to detect subtle differences in the pairs [Uniprot:P15700]/[Uniprot:P07170] and [Uniprot:P15700]/
[Uniprot:P26364] that are explained by sequence analy-

ses. In both cases, the members of the pair were annotated
with GO:0004849 ('uridine kinase activity') and
GO:0004017 ('adenylate kinase activity') respectively.
Lord's Semantic Model produced a distance of 0.37
between these proteins, indicating semantical relation. In
fact, the aforementioned terms are close in the GO hierarchy, and the deepest common parent shared by both GO
terms, two levels above, is 'nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide kinase activity' (GO:0019205). However, our Functional Distance located that pair of GO terms within the
intermediate interval at a distance of 0.65. A thorough
analysis of the sequences revealed that [Uniprot:P15700]
has the 'ADK' Pfam domain. Adenylate kinases are phosphotransferases with well conserved ADK domains that
include an important arginine which inactivates the
enzyme if mutated, and an aspartate that is located in the
catalytic cleft and that forms a crucial salt bridge. However, in the particular case of [Uniprot:P07170] and [Uniprot:P26364], the putative ADK domain is interrupted by
another PFAM domain, the ADK lid. Looking at the
sequence of this particular region, the ADK domain
boundaries were not clearly delineated due to a high
degree of divergence in the active site. So, in this example
our metric is able to capture the 'functional difference'
between these two proteins due to the inserted domain.
Implementation
The Spectral Clustering algorithm is implemented in Matlab 7.4.0 using the clustering functions available in the
Statistics Toolbox. Lord's model is implemented in
Python 2.5, and Python was also used to calculate the
functional and semantic distances.

Discussion and Conclusion
Here, we propose a new method to derive 'functional distances' between GO terms based on the co-occurrence of
them in the same set of proteins. The simultaneous occurrence of terms in Interpro entries provides a natural biological link between the GO functions. The relationship
between terms in the GO structure provides additional
semantic information that helps to refine the metric
model.
In this method, an initial profile is constructed for each
GO term representing its association with a set of Interpro
domains (after expanding the Interpro annotations with
the parenthood relationships of the GO terms). These
profiles are used to generate a matrix of co-occurrence
between GO terms. A graph is constructed where the
nodes are the GO terms and the edges are weighted
according to the distances extracted from this co-occurrence matrix. Spectral clustering is applied to this graph in
order to obtain an optimal number of groups of functionally similar GO terms. The distances derived in this way
provide a hierarchical clustering of GO terms (functional

tree) where the groups of terms with similar biological
meaning tend to be close. Additionally, this 'Functional
Tree' represents a metric model Df whereby the distances
between the terms fulfil the mathematical properties of a
metric space.
The main difference of this method from previous
approaches [10-14] is that Df is learned from examples.
Hence, in contrast to other proposed methods that derive
the distances from the semantic relationships within the
GO ontology, our method provides new associations
between the terms that enables a different way to compare
proteins in functional terms. We have selected some cases
to illustrate this point, for which the functional similarity
between related proteins is better estimated with this metric model than with currently available algorithms, such
as Lord's 'Semantic Similarity Model' [10]. Moreover, we
also tried to qualitatively assess some of the groups automatically extracted from the distances by a clustering algorithm. Over and above the comparison with these
examples and the qualitative assessment of the functional
tree, it is actually difficult to assess the general quality of
any functional metric.
The overall representation of the functional distances in
the Functional Tree originates very compact groups of
terms separated by well defined intervals as it is shown in
Figure 6B. This structure of the clusters produces a not uniform distribution of distances because the values tend to
concentrate in three regions (low, intermediate and high),
which is obviously a problem since it makes the metric to
some extent 'qualitative'. On the other hand, this categorisation produces natural 'cut-offs' and functional similarities that are naturally classified by the method in three
categories with biological meaning in a totally unsupervised way as been discussed in Results section.
This discretization is in part due to 'biological' reasons but
is also affected by the homology-based transfer that causes
that only a reduced set of terms is used for annotation purposes. In consequence, the coverage with respect to the
total number of terms in the Molecular Function ontology
is low (around 20%). In addition, only clear relations are
selected resulting a set of 995 MF-GO terms that are considered in the Functional Distance Model.
It is important to note that the relationships between the
GO terms obtained and the relationships in the GO ontology represent different elements. The GO DAG represents
qualitative semantic relationships ('is-a' and 'part-of')
while our relationships represent quantitative 'functional
distances'.
Thus, the metric proposed here provides a way of quantifying how similar two functional annotations are. This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/50

can be very useful for training systems for function prediction, for function-based protein searches in databases, or
to assess the accuracy of a functional prediction (comparing the predicted set of annotations with the real one).
This metric could also be useful for analysing the gene
clusters produced by DNA array experiments. We think it
may also provide insights into how functions evolved and
the relationships between sequence, structure and functional spaces.

Methods
Similarity Matrix
The GO annotations for a given Interpro entry are
retrieved from the mapping of Interpro to Gene Ontology
[23] (interpro2go file, release May 2006). Only the GO
terms belonging to the MF-GO are considered.

For each MF-GO term a profile vector is created that
describes the presence/absence of the terms throughout
the database. The profiles are constructed to analyze the
simultaneous occurrence of pair MF-GO terms in the
Interpro entries and filter the cases that do not contribute
to the extraction of the relationship between the terms.
The similarity between two terms is calculated by the
cosine distance between their co-occurrence vectors:

Sim(GO i , GO j ) = cos(Pi , P j ) =

Pi â P j
Pi P j

(1)

Note that the cosine distance generates values ranking
between 0 and 1. The similarity value can be considered as
a description of the functional relationship between these
terms, whereby similarities equal to 0 stand for unrelated
terms and 1 stands for strongly related. The similarity
matrix S is plotted in Figure 2A together with its histogram
(Figure 2B).
The distribution of the similarity values shows that almost
90 per cent of the pairs of terms are only weakly related.
This structure of the relationships reflects the presence of
well-defined groups of terms. However, the search space
has been limited as the cosine distance assigns a non-zero
value even to pairs of terms that rarely share the same
Interpro entry. Thus, based on the inspection of the histogram, we set a threshold of 0.8 to select strong functional
links. In total there are 995 MF-GO terms that are significantly connected.
Additionally, we reduced the dimension of S by applying
a NJW Spectral Clustering (NJW-SC) algorithm [21]. The
similarity matrix in spectral space is shown in 6A, while
the details of the algorithm are outlined in the 'Spectral
Clustering Algorithm' subsection from the appendix.

Optimization Approach
As the number of clusters K is not initially known, an optimization approach is used, such as the multiway normalized cut value MNCut, (see 'Multiway Cuts' subsection
from the appendix). The MNCut was calculated from the
normalized matrix P (Transition Probability matrix). P
represents the total probability of transit between any two
clusters Ci and Cj for a given partition C = {C1 ... CK} of the
graph and MNCut and represents the total sum of the
transition probabilities between the clusters. The goal of
optimization is to find the eigenvalue cut-off that generates a partition C* (K) that minimizes the MNCut value.
In particular, we addressed optimization by exploiting the
minimization of the gap value over the spectra of S.

The optimization curve is shown in Figure 8A. Note that a
wide range of eigenvalues minimizes the gap (from 4 to
93). Thus, we applied an additional criteria to select the
optimal cut-off, the correlation coefficient between the S
matrix packed according to C* (K) and the ideal block
diagonal matrix for this partition. The correlation calculation is used as a measure of the 'compactness' of the each
partition. The correlation coefficient values are shown in

8B where the partition for the 93rd eigenvalue maximizes
the procedure (correlation of 0.86). In Figure 6B the S
matrix packed for the optimal clustering is represented.
Benchmark Dataset of aligned proteins
To compare our metric with others developed previously
and to evaluate its relationship with sequence similarity,
we took a set of proteins with reliable annotations taken
from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). As an
annotation source we used the file gene association.sgd
(release October 2006).

The confidence of the Gene Ontology Annotations (GOA)
is represented by the Evidence Code (EVC). Although
there is no consensus rule that establishes a standard
order of annotations based on the EVCs, the Gene Ontology Consortium has outlined a rank of EVCs as a guide
[24]. The hierarchy of confidence establishes that the TAS
(Traceable Author Statement) and IDA (Inferred from
Direct Assay) tagged annotations offer the highest confidence.

Despite the efforts of the GOA project to improve the general reliability of its databases, the bulk of GO assignments are still made by automatic techniques with no
expert curation. This homology-based transfer generates
highly redundant sets of GO annotations. Moreover, as
our method to derive the similarity between GO terms is
to some extent affected by sequence similarity (given that
it uses Interpro domains), we decided to exclude GO
annotations derived from sequence relationships.

writing the manuscript, and all the authors read and
approved the final manuscript.

In gene association.sgd, there were 1264 yeast proteins
annotated with GO terms with EVCs unrelated by homology (TAS and IDA) that also appeared in our functional
tree. After filtering this set for sequence redundancy with
CD-hit [25] at 95%, we obtained a final set of 1193 yeast
proteins. We then perform fast alignments of all-againstall using BLAST, having chosen a permissive e-value (0.1)
to permit alignments between distant sequences. Nevertheless, alignments covering less than 50 residues and/or
with less than 10% similarity were excluded. The final set
comprised 1426 protein pairs and the distribution of
sequence similarity for these pairs is shown in Figure 5D.

Spectral clustering belongs to a collection of techniques
that are designed to overcome the problems of previous
approaches by using new ideas such as the eigenvectors of
the generalised/normalized Laplacian or the multi-way
spectral cut. A systematic comparison between the existing
published algorithms can be found in the work of Verma
and Meila [20]. Therein, the authors present a clear
description of the basic steps of the algorithms and their
general classification based on three different strategies:
(I) recursive spectral; (II) multi-way spectral; and (III)
non-spectral.

Functional Comparison between Gene Products
To calculate the functional similarity between two proteins from their set of GO terms and the metric relating
these terms, we applied the Hausdorff Distance. The
Hausdorff Distance is defined as the maximum value
between any point within one set and the nearest point in
the other set. Formally, from set A to B is:
a âb
D hausdorff = max{min(D(a, b))}
aâA

bâB

(2)

As the Hausdorff Distance is not symmetrical, a symmetrical measure was formulated as:
a âb
b âa
D hausdorff = max(D hausdorff , D hausdorff )

(3)

Usually the Hausdorff distance is evaluated over the Euclidean space, although in this work we applied equation 3
using two distances: (A) the distance Df obtained from our
Functional Tree and (B) the distance proposed by Lord et
al. [10]
We implemented Lord's semantic similarity using as a reference the annotated database gene associa-tion.goa
human [26] (released version 45.0), and we normalised
the values between 0 and 1 to compare it with the metric
derived in this work.

Appendix
Spectral Clustering
Spectral clustering has its origin in spectral graph partitioning [27] and is intended to efficiently identify good
discrete partitions of a graph based on the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the graph.

In this section we will introduce the notation and the
basic steps for the NJW spectral clustering algorithm [21]
and the ideas behind multi-way spectral cuts as a criterion
of optimisation to find the best partition of the data. Here
we implemented a modified version of NJW algorithm
suggested in [20].
NJW Spectral Clustering Algorithm
Consider a dataset U formed by N points to be clustered.
For each pair of points within U, a similarity value can be
defined as sij = sji â¥ 0 by any similarity measure. U can be
represented by a weighted directed graph G = (V, E) where
the S = [sij] matrix plays the role of the adjacency matrix of
the graph. A clustering C = C1, C2,..., CK is a partitioning of
U into non-empty disjointed subsets C1, C2,..., CK.
N

The out-degree of a node j is defined as d i =

âs

ij

. We

j =1

represent D for a diagonal matrix of out-degrees as: D =
diag(d1,..., dN).
The nodes can be grouped by following the steps:
1. Compute the transition probability matrix P = D-1 S.
where P defines the probability to navigate from node i to
node j in a random walk over G. By construction, the
eigenvalues of P are delimited as [-1, 1], 1 = Î»1 â¥ Î»2 â¥ Ê Î»
1
N
N â¥ -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are v ,..., v .
2. Select the first K eigenvalues of P and form the X matrix
by stacking the eigenvectors in columns:

X = [v1v2...vK]
3. Normalize each row of X to unit length to form the Y
matrix:

The multi-way normalized cut represents the total sum of
the transition probabilities between the clusters of C. If
MNCut(C) is small then the probability of evading Ck in a
random walk is also small.

X ij

Given the partition C = {C1,...CK}, over U the multi-way
normalized cut clustering criteria introduced in [28] is
defined as:

2
â X ij
j

4. Treat each row of Y as a point in K dimensions. The
points can be grouped by any standard clustering technique. In this work, the points are organized in a hierarchical tree.
Multiway Cuts
The majority of approaches in spectral clustering deal with
partitioning the graph in two optimal parts by using one
eigenvector at a time and applying this approach reiteratively until K clusters are found.

It has been shown that for any clustering, the MNCut(C)
is low-bounded by a function of the number of clusters K
and the eigenvalues of P [29]:
K

MNCut(C) â¥ K â

â Î» (P)
k

k =1

The non-negative difference between the MNCut(C) and
its lower bound is the gap(C):
K

gap(C) = MNCut(C) â K +
A way to use the K first eigenvectors simultaneously to
find the optimum partition of the graph has been proposed, minimizing the cut of two partitions over all possible partitions in U [28]. Most of the approaches assume
that the number of clusters K is known in advance, but in
many problems related to clustering there is not indirect
evidence that reveals the optimal number of groups.
Here we expose the basics of the multi-way normalized
cut (MNCut) concept that has been applied to find the
optimum number K:
The volume of node i is defined as the out-degree of the
node:

D i = Vol{i} =

âS

ij

jâU

D denotes the diagonal matrix formed by Di. The volume
of a subset A â U is VolA =

â Di , (we assume that no
iâA

node has volume 0).
Given two disjoint subsets (A, B) â U, the set of edges
between the subsets is the cut between A and B:

Cut( A, B) =

â

S ij

iâA , jâB

and the probability of transit from set A to set B is:

PAB =

Cut( A, B)
VolA

â Î» (P)
k

k =1

It has been also shown that gap(C) is 0 if P has piecewise
constant eigenvectors, that is if P is an ideal block stochastic matrix [29].
Therefore, from a set of M different partition solutions of
the data [Ci]iâM, the optimal C* is that which minimizes
the gap measure.
Properties of a Metric Space
By construction, the hierarchical clustering procedure
over the Gene Ontology terms defines a generalized distance D between any two terms goa and gob that satisfies
the mathematical properties of a metric space [22]. That
is, any set of elements (terms) of the space x1, x2 and x3 fulfil:

â¢ Nonnegativity: D(x1, x2) â¥ 0
â¢ Reflexivity: D(x1, x2) = 0 if and only if x1 = x2
â¢ Symmetry: D(x1, x2) = D(x2, x1)
â¢ Triangle Inequality: D(x1, x2) + D(x2, x3) â¥ D(x1, x3)
