Abstract
Background: The novel A/H1N1 influenza virus, which recently emerged in North America is
most closely related to North American H1N1/N2 swine viruses. Until the beginning of 2009,
North American swine H1N1/N2 viruses have only sporadically infected humans as dead-end
hosts. In 2009 the A/H1N1 virus acquired the capacity to spread efficiently by human to human
transmission. The novel A/H1N1 influenza virus has struck thousands of people in more than 70
countries and killed more than 140, representing a public health emergency of international
concern. Here we have studied properties of hemagglutinin of A/H1N1 which may modulate virus/
receptor interaction.
Results: Analyses by ISM bioinformatics platform of the HA1 protein of North American swine
H1N1/N2 viruses and the new A/H1N1 showed that both groups of viruses differed in conserved
characteristics that reflect a distinct propensity of these viruses to undergo a specific interaction
with swine or human host proteins or receptors. Swine H1N1/N2 viruses that sporadically infected
humans featured both the swine and the human interaction pattern. Substitutions F71S, T128S,
E302K, M314L in HA1 of swine H1N1 viruses from North America are identified as critical for the
human interaction pattern of A/H1N1 and residues D94, D196 and D274 are predicted to be "hotspots" for polymorphisms which could increase infectivity of A/H1N1 virus. At least one of these
residues has already emerged in the A/H1N1 isolates from Spain, Italy and USA. The domain 286326 was identified to be involved in virus/receptor interaction.
Conclusion: Our results (i) contribute to better understanding of the origin of the novel A/H1N1
influenza virus, (ii) provide a tool for monitoring its molecular evolution (iii) predicts hotspots
associated with enhanced infectivity in humans and (iv) identify therapeutic and diagnostic targets
for prevention and treatment of A/H1N1 infection.

Background
Sporadic infections of humans by swine influenza viruses
have been reported from the United States and worldwide, mostly from classical swine influenza [1-3]. During
the late nineties multiple subtypes of triple reassortants
influenza viruses with genes from avian, human and pig
origin emerged and became predominant in North American swine [1,4]. Triple reassortant H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes occasionally infected humans but human to human
transmission was rare and always very limited. However,
disease severity and clinical out-come was always unpredictable [5-7]. In April 2009 a H1N1 triple reassortant
swine influenza virus infected humans in North America
[4] and continued to effectively transmit from human to
humans (REF). The virus spread rapidly within Mexico
and with some delay across the United States before
spread to other continents. From 19 April to 1 August
2009, 60 655 specimens tested positive for influenza and
were reported to Flu-Net by 73 countries, areas and territories [8]. As a result, WHO declared the virus a pandemic
threat. While most fatal cases occurred in Mexico and the
United States, the virus appeared to be less aggressive in
Europe and Asia. The rapid spread of this swine influenza
virus mainly among young healthy adults and outside of
the classical influenza season added to the unpredictability of this virus. Thus the virus and its molecular evolution
raise a number of questions that are of prime international public health concern.
Recently, we applied the Informational Spectrum Method
(ISM) bioinformatics platform [9], for analysis of the
structure and function of the HA subunit 1 (HA1) of
H5N1 influenza viruses. Results of this analysis revealed
that HA1 of H5N1 viruses encodes specific and highly
conserved information which may determine the recognition and targeting of these highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses to their receptor [10]. We also
showed that a subset of H5N1 in Egypt may be evolving
toward an H1N1-like receptor usage, indicating more efficient human-to-human transmission [10]. This prediction is in accord with recently observed H5N1 subclinical
cases in Egypt. This silent spread of H5N1 in human populations sets the stage for increased transmission efficiencies and represents another threat with pandemic
potential.
Here we used the ISM platform to compare North American swine H1N1/N2 influenza viruses with the new pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Our results showed that both
groups of viruses differed in conserved characteristics that
reflect a distinct propensity of these viruses to undergo a
specific interaction with swine or human host proteins or
receptors. Swine H1N1/N2 viruses that sporadically
infected humans featured both the swine and the human
interaction pattern. Furthermore, we identified several

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/62

amino acid positions that are predicted to be "hot-spots"
for polymorphisms which could increase human infectivity of A/H1N1 virus. At least one of these residues has
already emerged in the A/H1N1 isolates from Spain, Italy
and USA.

Informational spectrum method
It has been proposed that the number of valence electrons
and the electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP) representing the main energy term of valence electrons are
essential physical parameters determining of the longrange properties of biological molecules [11]. The EIIP
can be determined for organic molecules by the following
simple equation derived from the "general model pseudopotential" [12,13]:

W = 0.25Z * sin(1.04p Z*) / 2p
where Z* is the average quasivalence number (AQVN)
determined by

Z* = Σ mn i Z i / N
where Zi is the valence number of the i-th atomic component, ni is the number of atoms of the i-th component, m
is the number of atomic components in the molecule, and
Nis the total number of atoms. The EIIP values calculated
according to equations (1) and (2) are in Rydbergs (Ry).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/62

The EIIP parameter was used as a basis of the informational spectrum method (ISM) for structure/function
analysis of proteins, analysis of protein - protein interaction and de novo design of biologically active peptides [for
reviews see Ref. [9] and references therein]. Here we will
only briefly present this bioinformatics method.
A sequence of N residues is represented as a linear array of
N terms, with each term given a weight. The weight
assigned to a residue is its EIIP value (given in Ry), determining electronic properties of amino acids, which are
responsible for their intermolecular interactions (Table
1). In this way the amino acid sequence is transformed
into a sequence of numbers. This numerical sequence,
representing the primary structure of the protein, is then
subjected to a discrete Fourier transformation, which is
defined as follows:

X(n) = Σ x(m)e −j(2 / N)nm , n = 1, 2, … , N / 2
where x(m) is the m-th member of a given numerical
series, N is the total number of points in this series, and
X(n) are discrete Fourier transformation coefficients.
These coefficients describe the amplitude, phase and frequency of sinusoids, which comprised the original signal.
The absolute value of a complex discrete Fourier transformation defines the amplitude spectrum and the phase
spectrum. The complete information about the original
sequence is contained in both spectral functions. However, in the case of protein analysis, relevant information

is presented in an energy density spectrum, which is
defined as follows:

S(n) = X(n)X*(n) =| X(n) |2 , n = 1, 2, … , N / 2.
In this way, sequences are analyzed as discrete signals. It is
assumed that their points are equidistant with the distance d = 1. The maximal frequency in a spectrum defined
as above is F = 1/2 d = 0.5. The frequency range is independent of the total number of points in the sequence.
The total number of points in a sequence influences only
the resolution of the spectrum. The resolution of the Npoint sequence is 1/n. The n-th point in the spectral function corresponds to a frequency f(n) = nf = n/N. Thus, the
initial information defined by the sequence of amino
acids can now be presented in the form of the informational spectrum (IS), representing the series of frequencies
and their amplitudes.
The IS frequencies correspond to the distribution of structural motifs with defined physicochemical properties
determining a biological function of a protein. When
comparing proteins, which share the same biological or
biochemical function, the ISM technique allows detection
of code/frequency pairs which are specific for their common biological properties, or which correlate with their
specific interaction. These common informational characteristics of sequences are determined by cross-spectrum or
consensus informational spectrum (CIS). A CIS of N spectra is obtained by the following equation:

C(j) = Π S(i, j)
where Π(i,j) is the j-th element of the i-th power spectrum
and C(j) is the j-th element of CIS. Thus, CIS is the Fourier
transform of the correlation function for the spectrum.
Thus, any spectral component (frequency) not present in
all compared informational spectra is eliminated. Peak
frequencies in CIS are common frequency components
for the analyzed sequences. A measure of similarity for
each peak is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), which represents a ratio between signal intensity at one particular IS
frequency and the main value of the whole spectrum. If
one calculates a CIS for a group of proteins, which have
different primary structures, and finds strictly defined
peak frequencies, it means that the primary structures of
the analyzed proteins encode the same information. It has
been demonstrated that: 1) such a peak exists only for a
group of proteins with the same biological function; 2) no
significant peaks exist for biologically unrelated proteins;
3) peak frequencies are different for different biological
functions. Furthermore, it was shown that the proteins
and their targets (ligand/receptor, antibody/antigen, etc.)
have the same characteristic frequency in common [9].
Thus, it can be postulated that IS frequencies not only

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/62

characterize general function but also recognition and
interaction between a particular protein and its target.
Once the characteristic frequency for a particular protein
function/interaction is identified, it is possible then to utilize the ISM approach to predict the amino acids in the
sequence, which essentially contribute to this frequency
and are likely to be crucial for the observed function [9].

Results and discussion
Phylogeny and principal component cluster analysis
revealed that the H gene of A/H1N1 is most closely related
to the triple reassortants swine influenza H1N1 and
H1N2 found in North America since 2000 (Figure 1).
These results, suggesting that A/H1N1 emerged from this
cluster of viruses, are consistent with the recently reported
findings of Trifonov and co-workers [15]. The H genes of
swine H1N1 and H1N2 from North America were analyzed by the ISM and compared to A/H1N1 strains. Figure
2 shows the typical IS profile of a selected virus (Figure 2d,
e, f) as well as the cumulated CIS (Figure 2a, b, c) of all
viruses of each group.
The CIS of HA1 of swine H1N2/H1N1 and A/H1N1
strains have characteristic dominant peaks at the IS frequencies F(0.055) and F(0.295), respectively (Figure 2a
and 2c). According to the ISM concept this reflects a differential interaction pattern of the HA1 of the two groups of
viruses. The tropism of the viruses suggests that a high
amplitude at F(0.055) corresponds to a higher propensity
to interact with swine protein(s) while the high amplitude
at F(0.295) may correspond to a preferred interaction
with human protein(s). CIS of the HA1 gene of swine
H1N1 viruses isolated from humans in US (before 2008)
contains characteristic peaks at both frequencies F(0.055)
and F(0.295) (Figure 2b). This suggests that these viruses,
that sporadically infected humans, display both the distinct "swine" interaction pattern shared with the swine
H1N1/N2 viruses and the characteristic "human" interaction pattern shared with A/H1N1 viruses. Thus, these
three groups of viruses have a distinct propensity to interact with swine and human proteins which can be
described by ISM analysis. These results also provide additional strong evidence that HA1 from swine viruses infecting humans in the US before 2008 were the likely
precursors of A/H1N1.
Changes in H1N1/N2 viruses that lead to enhanced transmission in humans are of particular interest. The comparison of HA1 sequences of H1N1/N2 viruses which
infected only swine with the early Mexican A/H1N1 strain
A/Mexico/4115/2009 revealed 14 amino acid substitu-

tions which are highly specific for A/H1N1 viruses
(Table 2).
We further investigated which of these mutations or combinations thereof are most important for the switch
between interaction patterns from swine H1N1/N2 to A/
H1N1 strains. As shown above, the interaction between
H1N1/N2 and swine protein(s), and the interaction
between A/H1N1 and human protein(s) are characterized

by the frequencies F(0.055) and F(0.295), respectively.
According to the ISM concept [9,16] mutations in HA1
which increase the amplitude at F(0.295) and decrease
amplitude at F(0.055) would potentially contribute to the
switch of the viral host tropism from swine to human.
Seven of the 14 mutations presented in Table 2 (R36K,
F71S, T128S, T216I, S271P, E302K, M314L) increase
amplitude on the F(0.295) and decrease amplitude on
F(0.055), suggesting that these mutations may be critical

Mutations present in swine H1N1/N2 strains which infect humans are marked with asterisk.

for the switch of H1N1/N2 from a swine to a human tropism. It is of note that three of these mutations (R36K,
T216I, S271P) also are present in swine H1N1 viruses that
infected humans in the US between 2005 and 2007 (Figure 2b). ISM analysis also showed that any of the combinations of the mutations F71S, T128S, E302K and M314L,
that are only present in A/H1N1, decrease the amplitude
in F(0.055) and increase the amplitude in F(0.295). This
suggests that these four mutations may play an important
role in the efficient infection of humans by A/H1N1, and
perhaps the effective human to human transmission. It is
of interest to note that 7 of 14 mutations presented in
Table 2 decrease amplitude on F(0.055) and increase
amplitude on F(0.295), 6 mutations decrease amplitudes
on both frequencies or have no effect, and only one
(N168D) increases the amplitude on F(0.055) and
decreases amplitude on F(0.295). This suggests that the
mutations in A/H1N1 that predispose for the human
interaction pattern are remarkable of more prevalent than
mutations that predispose for the swine interaction pattern.
It can be expected that A/H1N1 strains will accumulate
additional polymorphisms in their HA1 genes which further favor the "human" interaction pattern and according
to the ISM concept would be associated with an increase
of the amplitude at frequency F(0.295) and decrease the
amplitude at F(0.055). To identify candidate residues
("hot-spots") for such polymorphisms, we performed an
in silico alanine scan of the complete HA1. This analysis
revealed that mutations of residues 94D, 196D and 274D
would increase the amplitude at the critical frequency
F(0.295) (Figure 3a). Since Asp has the highest EIIP value
(Table 1) substitutions in any of the above positions will
increase the amplitude at frequency F(0.295). Interestingly, Asp (single letter code D) in positions 94, 196 and

247 is highly conserved in all North American swine
H1N1/N2 strains and in all A/H1N1 HA1 genes. The only
notable exceptions are four A/H1N1 isolates from Spain
(A/Castilla-La Mancha/GP13/2009, A/Castilla-La Mancha/GP9/2009, A/Valencia/GP4/2009, A/Catalonia/
P148/2009), two isolates from Italy (A/Italy/06/2009)
and four isolates from US (A/South Carolina/09/2009; A/
South Dakota/05/2009; A/South Carolina/10/2009; A/
Missouri/023/2009) that have a D274E mutation (Figure
4). This mutation significantly increases the amplitude on
the frequency F(0.295) and probably enhances the
"human" interaction pattern. The same result was
obtained for scan with any other amino acid with exception of Asp (results not shown). As can be seen in Figure
3b, A/Castilla-La Mancha/GP13/2009 (FJ985753) which
is identical to A/South Carolina/09/2009 (GQ221794)
differ from the early Mexican A/H1N1 isolates A/Mexico/
4115/2009 (EPI177288) only in positions I32L and
E257D. The amino acids L and I have the same EIIP value
(see Table 1) and the L>I substitution does not affect the
informational spectrum. In contrast, the EIIP values of
amino acids D and E are significantly different (see Table
1) and the D>E mutation increases the amplitude at frequency F(0.295) by 15%, with little effect on structural
properties of the protein since both amino acids are negatively charged. The stable mutation D274E found in US,
Spain and Italy may correspond to further adaptation of
A/H1N1 to humans. Interestingly, Spain was also one of
the first (European) countries with indigenous chains of
transmission, at a time when in other countries the virus
was mostly found in imported cases.
The computer scanning survey of the HA1 amino acid
sequence of A/H1N1 strains showed that the main contribution to the information represented by the frequency
F(0.295) comes from a domain located in the C-terminus

and position of the VIN2 domain in the 3D structure of A/
H1N1 isolate A/California/04/2009. It is of note that
VIN2 is conserved in all A/H1N1 and that two of the four
polymorphisms (E302K and M314L) which are identified
as critical for human infection are located within this
domain. The significance of these polymorphisms are
strengthened by the fact that domain 286 - 326 also is

highly conserved in HA1 of swine viruses (only 30 of 500
swine H1N1 HA1 presented in UniProt database have
mutations in this domain).
The relative position of the receptor binding domain and
the receptor targeting domain (VIN2) in 3D structure of
A/H1N1 HA1 is similar to the position of these two
domains in seasonal flu H1N1 viruses but different than
in H1N1 1918 viruses [10]. This suggests that efficacy of

Authors' contributions
Conclusion
Analyses by the ISM bioinformatics platform of the HA1
protein of North American swine H1N1 and H1N2
viruses and the new A/H1N1 that emerged recently in
Mexico and the USA showed that both groups of viruses
differed in characteristic parameters that reflect a distinct
propensity of these viruses to undergo a specific interaction with swine or human host proteins or receptors.
Using the same approach, amino acid substitutions F71S,
T128S, E302K, M314L in the A/H1N1 HA1 essential for
the human interaction pattern of these viruses were identified and residues 94D, 196D and 274D of A/H1N1 HA1
were predicted as "hot-spots" for mutations that may significantly increase the propensity of this virus to interact
preferentially with human host proteins. At least one of
these mutations (D274E) was already found in the A/
H1N1 isolates from Spain, Italy and US, suggesting the
virus further adapts to the human host. In addition, it has
been suggested that the highly conserved domain 286 326 of HA1 plays an important role in A/H1N1-receptor
