Abstract
Background: The ability to rapidly characterize an unknown microorganism is critical in both
responding to infectious disease and biodefense. To do this, we need some way of anticipating an
organism's phenotype based on the molecules encoded by its genome. However, the link between
molecular composition (i.e. genotype) and phenotype for microbes is not obvious. While there
have been several studies that address this challenge, none have yet proposed a large-scale method
integrating curated biological information. Here we utilize a systematic approach to discover
genotype-phenotype associations that combines phenotypic information from a biomedical
informatics database, GIDEON, with the molecular information contained in National Center for
Biotechnology Information's Clusters of Orthologous Groups database (NCBI COGs).
Results: Integrating the information in the two databases, we are able to correlate the presence
or absence of a given protein in a microbe with its phenotype as measured by certain morphological
characteristics or survival in a particular growth media. With a 0.8 correlation score threshold, 66%
of the associations found were confirmed by the literature and at a 0.9 correlation threshold, 86%
were positively verified.
Conclusion: Our results suggest possible phenotypic manifestations for proteins biochemically
associated with sugar metabolism and electron transport. Moreover, we believe our approach can
be extended to linking pathogenic phenotypes with functionally related proteins.

Background
Traditionally, microbes have been identified on the basis
of their response to a battery of phenotypic assays, for
example, survival on a particular type of growth media or
morphological characteristics. With the advent of high
throughput sequencing efforts, over 300 microbes have

been completely sequenced [1]. By integrating complex
phenotypic data with sequence information, new phenotype-genotype relationships can be unveiled.
The underpinnings for this work can be found in Marcotte
et al. where phenotype was defined in terms of pathway

membership which was used to predict protein function
[2]. In addition, previous studies have proposed comparative genomic methods to predict characteristics such as
hyperthermophily [3,4], flagellar motility [4-6], plant
degradation [6], and pili assembly [4]. However, most of
these studies focus on a few specific phenotypes within
certain organisms [3-5]. Korbel et al. proposed an automated method to make word-species associations
retrieved from Medline abstracts [6]. Here we introduce a
new approach for discovering phenotype-genotype relationships using a clinical information database consisting
of manually curated results from 93 phenotypic assays
allowing for a large-scale analysis of phenotype-genotype
relationships.

Results

The Global Infectious Diseases & Epidemiology Network
(GIDEON) is an expert system used primarily by physicians to aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases [7]. This
database was chosen because of its exhaustive categorization of microorganisms. The results of 93 different microbiological assays for 1147 microbial taxa are catalogued
providing a wealth of phenotypic data. GIDEON is manually annotated using peer-reviewed sources in the scientific literature.

Subsequently, a 0.8 correlation threshold and a 0.9 correlation threshold were used to generate two separate result
sets. The 0.8 correlation data set contained 290 association pairs (see Additional file 2). One hundred random
data points were selected from the 0.8 correlation result
set for literature validation; these are referred to as annotated pairs (see Additional file 3). Out of these 100 data
points, 66% of the data points had associations confirmed
in the scientific literature. For the 0.9 correlation score
threshold, 86% (31/36) of the resulting pairs had confirmed associations in the literature (Table 1).

NCBI's Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins
(COGs) database currently consists of 138,458 proteins,
which form 4873 COGs [8-10]. This database phylogenetically classifies proteins from complete genomes into
COGs where each COG includes proteins that are thought
to be orthologous. All the newly classified COGs and new
members of pre-existing COGs are manually curated.
This study uses the COGs database and the GIDEON database by linking the proteins found in organisms (COGs)
to the organism's expressed phenotype (GIDEON) Using
this approach, we are able to identify phenotype-COG
association pairs and verify these findings in the literature.
Finally, this analysis suggests possible phenotype-genotype pairs that have not yet been experimentally determined. By integrating a clinical microbiological database,
GIDEON, with a molecular database, COGs, we can make
inferences between the presence of a protein and the protein's function in a large-scale fashion.

By utilizing the phenotypic information stored in the
GIDEON database, we can begin to make associations
between the presence of a gene (COG) within an organism to its expressed phenotype. First, we mapped the
organisms found in the GIDEON database to the organisms in the COGs database (see Additional file 1). Secondly, to quantify the associations between the
phenotype of an organism to its genomic content, we calculated the correlation between the measured expression
of a certain phenotype to the absence or presence of COGs
within an organism. Third, we applied a hypergeometric
distribution threshold of 0.01 to filter for significant correlations.

Some of the representative association pairs that were verified by the literature are discussed below (Table 2). The
laboratory conditions are referred to by their GIDEON
identifier/phenotypic description (see Additional file 4),
and a COG with a known function is defined as characterized (see Additional file 5).
A) B01/Gram-negative – Among the 66 confirmed associated pairs found in the result set with a threshold score of
0.8, 16 substantiated associations out of a total of 17
annotated COG-phenotype pairs (Table 2) are involved in
the B01/Gram-negative phenotype. This resulted in 94%
accuracy for determining Gram-negative organisms. For
the data set with a score of 0.9 correlation criteria, 12 out
of 12 total annotated COG-phenotype pairs were verified
by the literature.

The outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria is a
lipid-protein bilayer made up of proteins, phospholipids,
and lipopolysaccharides that differentiate it from the
thicker cell wall structure of Gram-positive bacteria [11].
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the confirmed pairs found with
the Gram-negative phenotype contained proteins
involved with lipid A and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis
and other proteins belonging to the outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria (Table 3).
B) B02/Gram-positive – More interestingly, annotated
pairs with the B02/Gram-positive phenotype were not just
specific to the specialized Gram-positive membrane but
also to a variety of conserved genes found only in the
Gram-positive bacteria. Of the six proteins with known
function found in the 0.8 correlation score data set, 3 pairs
were positively confirmed by the scientific literature. In
the 0.9 correlation result set, 2 out of 2 (100%) of the
characterized pairs were corroborated.
C) B29/Growth on MacConkey Agar – Growth on MacConkey agar is indicative of Gram-negative bacteria that can
ferment lactose [12]. Sixteen (52%) of the associated pairs
from the 0.8 correlation data were confirmed, as were 4
(100%) of the associated pairs from the 0.9 correlation set
Organisms that were able to grow on MacConkey agar
contained proteins involved with the outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria. Given the use of this test in spe-

cifically differentiating those Gram-negatives that can ferment lactose, one would expect this result; however, the
proteins associated with growth on MacConkey agar do
not overlap with those proteins most associated with the
Gram-negative test. This suggests that this method of
building associations can be specific to a particular condition.
D) B30/Oxidase – Two characterized COGs were found
with a correlation at 0.85 and p < 7.48 × 10-6 to be positively associated with oxidase activity. Both are components of Cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase which is
unsurprising since the goal of the oxidase test is to detect
the presence of this enzyme. Although this is not a novel
finding, it does illustrate that our method is able to pick
out known relationships.
E) B31/Catalase – In the catalase test, hydrogen peroxide
is added to the media. Those microbes which do not contain the catalase enzyme are unable to break the hydrogen
peroxide into oxygen and water and would die. As would
be expected, the COGs associated to the B31/Catalase test
were usually enzymes that belong to similar regulation
pathways as the catalase enzyme. For example, human
acyl-CoA hydrolase, one of the COGs found to be positively associated to the catalase phenotype, upregulates
peroxisome biogenesis and, in turn, activates catalase
activity [13]. The highest scoring pair was a member of the

has previously been shown that addition of trehalose to
growth media induces the maltose system verifying both
of these associations [16].

F) FAC/L-Arabinose – With a high correlation score of
0.97, 5-keto 4-deoxyuronate isomerase was the only characterized protein family associated with the ability to
assimilate arabinose. 5-keto 4-deoxyuronate isomerase, or
kduI, is an enzyme involved with pectin degradation and
shares the same regulator protein, crp or CAP protein, as
the L-Arabinose catabolism pathway [14,15].

H) G03/Motile – Finally, the pairs related to the G03/
Motile phenotype contain proteins involved with chemotaxis and flagella. The result set with a correlation score
above 0.8 contained 17 such proteins, and 100% of these
were verified by the literature. Similarly, all 5 proteins
from the result set with a 0.9 threshold were also confirmed.

capability to metabolize the sugar trehalose were several
maltose-related proteins with correlation scores of 0.94. It

teins found to be associated with motility were also
annotated as part of the Cell Motility functional classification in the KEGG pathway database.
Prediction of genes associated to phenotypes
After analyzing the accuracy of the data sets, it is also possible to make reasonable hypotheses for COG-phenotype
pairs that are characterized but have not yet been confirmed by the biological literature. These COG-phenotype
pairs are listed using their GIDEON identifier/descriptionCOG description/protein name. One example is the B31/
Catalase-COG1651/Protein-disulfide isomerase (DsbG)
pair with a correlation score of 0.91. Dsb proteins are
known to oxidize the sulfhydryl groups of periplasmic
proteins to disulfide bonds, donating electrons to ubiquinone, and thereby making the electron transport chain the
primary source of oxidizing power for sustaining periplasmic sulfhydryl oxidation [19,20]. During the stationary
phase, electron transport to oxygen is reduced. Bandyopadhyay et al. suggest a possible complementary role
between catalase and the Dsb proteins in maintaining
periplasmic sulfhydryl oxidation. It is possible that catalase may be critical in peroxidatically oxidizing ubiquinol
or another periplasmic or inner membrane component
using H2O2 as an electron acceptor during the stationary
phase when the oxidizing capacity of the electron transport is diminished [21].

With a correlation score of 0.95, other possible associations can be made for the FAP/L-Rhamnose phenotype
with various phosphotransferase system sorbitol-specific
component proteins. Some microbes such as the Klebsiella I-174 organism make exopolysaccharides with a
high rhamnose content [22]. Farres et al. showed that the
addition of sorbitol increased the production and growth
of rhamnose over other carbon sources such as sucrose
[23]. This study suggests that proteins involved with sorbitol metabolism and utilization could be linked to rhamnose production.

Discussion
Based on the breakdown of total number of associated
pairs for each laboratory condition (Figure 2) for the 0.8
correlation data set, the phenotypes that have 10 or more
associated COGs have a more likely chance of containing
confirmed literature hits. This is roughly 3% of the total
number of phenotype-COG pairs. However, there are labs
such as B30/Oxidase, FAM/Mannose, and FAT/Trehalose
with only 2 results, but all are confirmed at 100%. The 0.9
correlation data set has 86% confirmed associations out
of all the characterized pairs, while the 0.8 correlation
data set has 66%.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/257

However, this number is most likely a lower bound, since
it is possible that some of the predicted associations mentioned in this paper will be experimentally corroborated
in the future, raising these percentages.
In addition, although we used the literature as a means of
verifying associations, in essence, it is those associations
which we were unable to verify that are perhaps the most
interesting because these represent new testable hypotheses. By uncovering these novel relationships, it is possible
to make inferences about the interrelatedness of what at
the outset seem disparate processes. In a similar fashion,
for the purpose of assessing our method we were unable
to include the COGs with unknown function, but ideally
we would like to extend this method to make predictions
regarding possible functions of these uncharacterized
COGs on the basis of the phenotypes they are most associated with. Finally, while the data in the GIDEON database is extensive, not all assays were performed on all
microbes resulting in some missing data.

Conclusion
This analysis shows that the integration of biological and
biomedical information databases can augment and
enhance biological understanding. This approach is an
introduction to resources that are yet to be fully utilized.
Here we describe the combination of a manually annotated phenotype database, GIDEON, with the well-documented COGs database to find new associations between
a certain phenotype and an organism's genotype. This
study reports phenotype-COG associations found above a
certain threshold. We have demonstrated that the method
is able to detect known phenotype-COG relationships, as
well as, discover new ones. Additional comparisons with
the KEGG database confirm the resulting COGs shown to
be related to the motility phenotype, and subsequently,
further predictions are made for potential phenotypeCOGs pairs that have not yet been discovered.
These results suggest a new direction for inferring either
the phenotype or genotype of an uncharacterized organism. This approach can further be applied to discovering
relationships between the pathogenicity of these organisms to functionally related proteins. Moreover, this type
of analysis could be extended beyond phenotype-genotype to phenotype-drug design by associating molecules
to their phenotypic effects. By integrating clinical and biological databases, additional studies can be developed to
further the understanding of phenotypic relationships
and, in turn, augment the medical community's ability to
rapidly identify infectious agents.

This study reports a percentage of confirmed associations
in order to approximate the accuracy of these results.

Methods
Mapping organisms between databases
The laboratory results in the GIDEON database are primarily used for identifying bacterial species for medical diagnostics. Since different strains of the same bacterial species
are often sequenced, NCBI's taxonomic annotation is
sometimes at the subspecies level. In contrast, the
GIDEON phenotypes do not achieve such a high resolution, and for this reason GIDEON taxonomic annotation
is established at the level where the phenotype is consistent in all descendants of the phylogenetic tree (generally
the species level).

This presented a complication in integrating the two data
sources. To overcome this, we assumed that phenotypes
from the microbiological database for one species are
valid for every subsumed subspecies and strain listed in
the COGs database. This is a valid assumption since the
GIDEON dataset provides microbiologists with relevant
tests designed to distinguish between organisms according to their phenotypes. Thus if the phenotype is specific
to a subspecies, it will be annotated at the level of the subspecies, but if the phenotype is common to all subspecies,
it is recorded at the level of the species.
Following this principle, we first identified the taxonomic
level for the fully sequenced bacteria in the COGs dataset,
and then used text string matching followed by manual
examination to map the species in GIDEON [24]. As a
result, we have mapped the 37 microorganisms present in
both GIDEON and the COGs. Of the 37 mappings, 23
have identical species annotations in GIDEON and COGs,
and 9 have a species annotation in GIDEON mapped to
one or more subspecies in COGs.
There were several COGs species including H. pylori, E.
coli, M. tuberculosis, and N. meningitidis which had more
than one subspecies with complete genome sequences. In
these cases, the subspecies were merged to the single
GIDEON species by selecting only the COGs common to
all subspecies. In this manner, we eliminated the subspecies specific differences that the phenotypic assays would
have been unable to resolve. We generated a matrix showing the presence and absence of COGs across these 37 species.
Associating genes to phenotypes
We employed a correlation analysis to quantify the association between a given COG and a GIDEON phenotype.
Two matrices were constructed. We defined X as a twodimensional matrix indicating the presence or absence of
organisms within a COG (X was constructed as an M × N
matrix, where M is equal to the number of COGs and N is
equal to the number of organisms within a COG). For the
corresponding GIDEON lab conditions, a similar distance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/257

matrix, Y, was constructed as an N × L matrix, where N is
equal to the percent survival of organisms subjected to
each lab condition and L is equal to the number of lab
conditions. Xij is the presence or absence of a COG mi
within an organism nj, and Yjk signifies the percent
response of an organism nj under a certain lab condition
lk. We computed an M × L matrix of linear correlation
coefficients rik (Pearson's correlation coefficient [25],
where each rik is defined as:
N

∑ ( Xij − Xi ) ( Y jk − Yk )
rik =

j =1

N

N

∑ ( Xij − Xi ) ∑ ( Y jk − Yk )
2

j =1

2

j =1

with -1≤rik≤+1 where X i is the mean over all Xij's for all j
from 1..N, and Y k is the mean over all Yjk's all j from 1..N.
In our context, Xij and Yjk are presence or absence of a COG
within an organism or the percent response of an organism subject to adverse growth condition, respectively.
While the correlation measures the strength of association
between an organism's genomic content and its phenotype, we also applied another method, exploiting the
hypergeometric distribution function, to determine the
significance of these associations

 M  M − n 
 

i
n−i 
p(i ≥ m | N , M, n) = ∑   
N
i =m
 
n 
n

where N is the total number of species, n is the number of
species that are positive in the laboratory result, M is the
number of species that have the COGs family, and m is
the number of species that have the COGs family and is
also positive in the laboratory result, where a result ≤ 20%
response is considered negative. So for a given gene found
in M species, the hypergeometric function provides the
probability by random chance that the gene is found in m
species which contain the COG and are also positive in
the laboratory test.
Assessment of predicted results
The following criteria were applied to the correlated data
set. The intersection between a specific COG and a phenotype had to contain at least 3 organisms, and for any intersection, 30% of the microbes had to share the COG. The
scores were adjusted using the standard Bonferroni error
correction for multiple testing. Since the Bonferroni correction is one of the most conservative, it is likely that

some biologically relevant associations were unnecessarily discarded. In this case α was set as less than equal to
0.01, therefore, any hypergeometric distribution score less
than or equal to 0.0001 was deemed significant. Using
these criteria, we set a 0.8 and a 0.9 correlation threshold
to assess the significance of the COG-phenotype associations.
For the 0.8 correlation threshold, 290 total associations
were obtained. We identified a subset of these data (154)
that contain only COGs that have a known function. Of
these 154 pairs, we performed detailed literature searches
on 100 randomly selected pairs to confirm the validity of
the positive COG-phenotype associations.
There were 74 associations found in the 0.9 correlation
data set. Thirty-six of these pairs contained a COG of
known function. Literature searches were performed on
all 36 associations.
