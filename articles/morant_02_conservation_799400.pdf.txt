Abstract
Background: Availability of genomewide information on an increasing but still limited number of
plants offers the possibility of identifying orthologues, or related genes, in species with major
economical impact and complex genomes. In this paper we exploit the recently described
CODEHOP primer design and PCR strategy for targeted isolation of homologues in large gene
families.
Results: The method was tested with two different objectives. The first was to analyze the
evolution of the CYP98 family of cytochrome P450 genes involved in 3-hydroxylation of phenolic
compounds and lignification in a broad range of plant species. The second was to isolate an
orthologue of the sorghum glucosyl transferase UGT85B1 and to determine the complexity of the
UGT85 family in wheat. P450s of the CYP98 family or closely related sequences were found in all
vascular plants. No related sequence was found in moss. Neither extensive duplication of the
CYP98 genes nor an orthologue of UGT85B1 were found in wheat. The UGT85A subfamily was
however found to be highly variable in wheat.
Conclusions: Our data are in agreement with the implication of CYP98s in lignification and the
evolution of 3-hydroxylation of lignin precursors with vascular plants. High conservation of the
CYP98 family strongly argues in favour of an essential function in plant development. Conversely,
high duplication and diversification of the UGT85A gene family in wheat suggests its involvement in
adaptative response and provides a valuable pool of genes for biotechnological applications. This
work demonstrates the high potential of the CODEHOP strategy for the exploration of large gene
families in plants.

Background
Plants have evolved extremely diversified gene families as
tools to cope with a harsh environment. Some of these
families such as cytochromes P450 and UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGT) reflect the extraordinary biochemical

versatility of plants and across plant species, and represent
a very valuable source of genes for biotechnologies. Both
gene families offer a huge potential for bioremediation
and control of crop and weed pesticide tolerance [1–3],
but obviously also for industrial applications. P450s, con-

sidered as the most versatile catalysts known [4], usually
activate dioxygen and transfer one of its atoms into various substrates, but also catalyze a great diversity of reactions ranging from C-C and C=N bond cleavage, phenolic
coupling, dehydration, dehydrogenation, isomerizations
to reduction [5]. Many of these reactions are important for
the biosynthesis of hormones, drugs, pigments, aromas,
biopolymer building blocks and defense molecules [6,7].
Glycosyltransferases are also essential for the production
of natural compounds since they control their solubility,
stability, transport, storage and sometimes also their bioactivity [8,9]. Should some of this potential become directly accessible through genomewide sequencing,
extensive information is restricted to model plants, usually with a small genome, or to plants with a major economical interest. Exploitation of this knowledge to target genes
of other plants that need to be studied or engineered, or
to explore gene families in plants with specific biosynthetic capacities is an objective for the next several years.
With the growing availability of gene sequences plus information regarding their diversity and phylogeny, increasingly sophisticated PCR techniques have been
developed to target gene families. Plant P450s are low
abundant membrane-bound and unstable proteins, usually difficult to purify. For this reason, early on, several
groups attempted isolation of P450 genes on the basis of
the most conserved consensus regions, after generating
probes by conventional PCR at low stringency [10–13].
This approach was later refined and used by several other
groups for isolation of P450 genes in various plant species
[e.g. [14–18]]. It proved successful in many cases, although only leading to a small number of highly expressed and related P450 families. A significant step
forward resulted from coupling degenerate PCR with a
heme binding primer and differential display of the amplified fragments, an approach that allowed effective identification of nine P450 genes responsive to elicitor
treatment of soybean cell cultures [19] and 21 unique
P450 genes in Taxus cells induced for taxol production
[20]. A carefully controlled and strongly differential system is however needed for such an approach. Another interesting improvement was recently reported that involves
use of nested primers to increase PCR selectivity [21].
However, the major limitation of all the strategies reported so far is that they did not take into account the huge diversity and low conservation of P450s recently revealed by
genome sequencing in higher plants, and allowed neither
focused gene selection nor isolation of the most divergent
P450 clades, i.e. no systematic exploration of the P450 superfamily in highly divergent species.
In this paper we report on the high potential of the recently described COnsensus-DEgenerate Hybrid Oligonucleotide Primers (CODEHOP) strategy [22] of primer design,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/2/7

ensuring optimal match and PCR amplification focused
on very short conserved sequences, for the isolation of orthologues in evolutionarily distant species and for the focused or systematic exploration of gene families in plants
with a very large genome. The method was tested to analyze both the duplication and conservation of the CYP98
family of P450 genes in many plant species. This family
was recently suggested to play an essential role in lignification and plant development [23–25]. The same approach was also used for the analysis of the UGT85 family
in wheat.

Results
Chasing the CYP98 genes in wheat
The CYP98 family of cytochrome P450 genes encodes the
3'-hydroxylases of coumaroyl esters, which catalyze an essential step in the synthesis of lignin monomers and chlorogenic acid [23–25]. CYP98 activity is also needed for the
biosynthesis of many phenolic flavouring compounds
such as eugenol, safrole or vanilin. Engineering the expression of this family of P450s has important agro-industrial applications, including enhancement of plant
defense and modification of lignin composition to improve forage digestibility and wood pulping [26,27]. Access to CYP98 genes from major crop and forage plants
and most common woody species is a necessary step for
modifying their expression. If some partial sequences are
made available by EST sequencing of a limited number of
species, they do not reflect the whole range of gene isoforms expressed in a plant or plant tissue, especially for large
genome plants.

Our first aim was thus to test if it was possible to detect
several genes belonging to the CYP98 family expressed in
the seedlings from wheat, a major crop plant with a very
large genome. When this work was initiated, few CYP98
sequences were available, some of them only partial sequences arising from ESTs. To optimize primer selection,
with a bias in favour of monocot genes, available ESTs
from rice and maize were aligned with the full-length sequences from sorghum [17], soybean [28] and Arabidopsis
thaliana. In the latter case, A. thaliana genome sequencing
had revealed three genes. Two of them (CYP98A8 and
CYP98A9: function unknown) were closely related and
clearly divergent from the third, CYP98A3, recently shown
to encode a coumaroyl esters 3'-hydroxylase. CYP98A3
seemed to be the orthologue of the sequences isolated
from sorghum, rice, maize and soybean. Primers were designed using the CODEHOP strategy. Three sense (P98a,
d and c) and one reverse (P98cr) primer were selected
(Figure 1) so as to avoid the strong consensus regions
common to other P450 families such as the highly conserved PERF motif. To further ensure high primer selectivity, touch-down gene selection PCR was conducted
starting with a high (70°C) annealing temperature.

Figure 1
Location of the P98 primers on the CYP98 alignment used for primer design. Only the region overlapping available
monocots ESTs was used for primer selection in order to introduce a bias for monocot sequences. This overlapping region is
shown on the full-length alignment (left) shaded in blue. All sequence alignments were performed using the BioEdit program
[40].

BLASTp analysis, performed with the consensus protein
sequence corresponding to each primer on a local plant
P450 library, indicated that the sense primers were more
specific than the reverse, and likely to control amplification selectivity (Table 1I). As predicted by the BLAST analysis, the P98c/P98cr pair was the most specific, and led to
the amplification of two different but closely related
CYP98 fragments from wheat seedlings cDNA libraries. A
single band of the expected size was obtained on an agarose gel that was eluted and subcloned in a 3'-T overhang
vector. Out of 19 sequenced clones, 11 corresponded to
CYP98A11, 7 to CYP98A10, and one to a non-CYP sequence (Figure 2). As predicted as well, the P98d/P98cr
pair was the second most effective. In addition to
CYP98A10 and CYP98A11, it also amplified a clearly divergent CYP98 gene, CYP98A12. Out of 14 amplified fragments sequenced 13 coded for CYP98s. The P98a primer
is predicted to match a larger number of P450 families
(Table 1). Used together with P98cr, it amplified more
non-CYP and non-CYP98 CYP sequences than CYP98s

(CYP98A11 and CYP98A10). Two of the CYP sequences
however were closely related to CYP98s and CYP76s. Initiation of the touch-down PCR at a lower temperature and
analysis of the amplified fragments did not reveal additional CYP98 sequences.
The CODEHOP strategy thus appears well suited for the
very focused to broader exploration of gene families in
plants with a large genome, depending on primer selectivity. Selectivity of each set of primers can be predicted by a
BLAST analysis. In young wheat seedlings, focused CODEHOP screening allowed the detection of three clearly different CYP98 genes. All three genes are apparently related
to A. thaliana CYP98A3.
Isolation of CYP98 ortho/homologues in other plant species
The second step of this investigation was aimed at testing
the possibility to isolate CYP98A3 orthologues in a broad
range of distantly related species. The most selective prim-

plified from the C. richardii cDNA library. No amplicon
was obtained however for P. patens, P. pinaster or the
Solanaceae, neither after optimizing codon usage, nor after further decreasing the initial temperature of the touchdown PCR.

er pair P98c/P98cr, without modification for codon usage,
was first assayed with the same amplification programme
or after shifting the initial annealing temperature from 70
to 65°C using various cDNA libraries, prepared from Capsicum annuum fruit (Solanaceae), Ceratopteris richardii
(fern), Coleus blumei cell culture (Lamiaceae), Eucalyptus
globulus xylem (Myrtaceae), Helianthus annuus stem and
leaf (Asteraceae), Lycopersicon esculentum shoots
(Solanaceae), Picea abies cell culture (Coniferales), Pinus
pinaster stem and root (Coniferales), Populus trichocarpa x
deltoides stem, root and leaf (Salicaceae), Physcomitrella
patens protonemal tissue (moss). CYP98-related sequences were amplified from the libraries of C. blumei, E. globulus, H. annuus, P. abies, and Populus. After optimization of
primer codon usage, a CYP98-like fragment was also am-

Out of these ten representative species in a broad range of
vascular plants, including fern, conifers, monocots and dicots, the CODEHOP strategy thus provided CYP98-related
DNA sequences in seven cases (Figure 3). Due to the short
size of the amplicons, it is not possible to unambiguously
assign them all to the CYP98 family. Full-length sequences would be needed for such an assignment, if not catalytic activity for the proteins. To date, those were only
obtained in the case of wheat, confirming gene identity
and function (M. Morant, personal communication). Homology analysis of the amplified fragments is however
consistent with evolutionary history of vascular plants
(Figure 4). Combined with a BLAST analysis, it suggests
that the P. abies and C. richardii amplified fragments could
be either representative of ancestral forms of CYP98s or
derived from a related A-type P450 family, possibly
CYP81. No CYP98-related sequence was detected in the
moss P. patens, which would be in agreement with the evolution of CYP98s with vascular plants. CYP98 and related sequences are as yet also absent from P. patens ESTs,
among which CYP73 expected to code for cinnamate 4hydroxylase can be found. Evolution of CYP73, involved
in an upstream step in the phenylpropanoid pathway and
the biosynthesis of flavonoids, is supposed to have preceded that of lignification [29].
Limits of the method
In a few cases, no amplification was obtained after decreasing the initial annealing temperature of the touchdown PCR and adapting codon usage. This occurred with
libraries where CYP98 cDNAs were expected to be present,

for example in a library of pine stem and root, and libraries from bellpepper fruit or young tomato plants. In pine
stem, CYP98 should be expressed at a high level for the
synthesis of lignin monomers, while Solanaceae are described as accumulating large concentrations of hydroxycinnamic esters such as chlorogenic acid. The P98c and
P98cr primers, initially designed with codon usage for
wheat gene amplification, were compared to those designed with optimal codon usage for the other plant (Figure 5). P98c differed in 2 positions out of 16 in the clamp
segment from the primer optimized for pine, and in 4 positions out of 16 from the primer predicted as optimal for
Solanaceae. P98cr also differed in 4 positions out of 11 in
the clamp for both pine and Solanaceae. Difference in co-

don usage thus seemed to provide an explanation for the
failure of our first experiments. New primers using adapted codons were thus tested but did not lead to amplified
fragment under any tested PCR condition.
To find an explanation, EST and cDNA sequences now
available for pine and tomato, another Solanaceae, were
examined and aligned with our primers and consensus sequences. This comparison to the authentic sequences revealed significant divergences from most frequent codon
usage in addition to the selected consensus sequence. The
assumption that the clamp segment of the primers has a
very minor impact on the amplification [22] thus probably should be reconsidered. The dissimilarity present in

from tomato and potato reveals several subgroups with

accessions are shown in bold characters, L. esculentum are

boxed in blue. Divergence from amino acid consensus is
shown in red.

this example is however likely to be local and thus successful amplification should be obtained by using multiple primers distributed along the full sequence.
Exploration of another gene family in wheat: UGT85
Glycosyl transferases (type 1) form another large gene
family with important applications in agrochemistry,
therefore, we tested the efficiency of the CODEHOP strategy for exploring the diversity of glycosyl transferases in
hexaploid wheat. In this case, we decided to focus on
UGTs related to the UDP-glucose:p-hydroxymandeloni-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/2/7

trile-O-glucosyl transferase (sbHMNGT or UGT85B1) catalyzing the last step in the synthesis of cyanogenic
glucosides, recently isolated from S. bicolor[30]. When this
work was initiated BLASTp search revealed only 2 sequences, UGT85A2 and UGT85A3, significantly related to
sbHMNGT (43% identity) in the genome of A. thaliana.
CODEHOP primer design, based on the alignment of the
3 full-length sequences, provided five sense and five reverse primers likely to be selective of this group of UGTs
(Table 2). PCR was conducted with all combinations of
primers, starting touch-down PCR at 70°C. When a couple
of primers amplified products of expected size, they were
subcloned and analyzed. The primer couple was then discarded and the library was screened using the other primer
combinations but with the initial temperature of the
touch-down PCR decreased by 5°C. Successive temperature decreases led to successful amplification from 8 couples of primers. Glucosyl transferases were recently shown
to be induced by the herbicide safener cloquintocet-mexyl
in wheat [31]. In agreement with this report, a stronger
amplification was usually obtained using a cDNA library
prepared from safener-treated seedlings as a template (Figure 6). Analysis of 63 subclones led to the isolation of 18
distinct UGT sequences resulting from specific amplifications. Their sequences can be obtained from GeneBank
under the accessions AJ438327, AJ438326, AJ438330,
AJ438331, AJ438332, AJ438316, AJ438315, AJ438318,
AJ438320, AJ438317, AJ438319, AJ438333, AJ438335
AJ438337, AJ438334, AJ438338, AJ438329, and
AJ438328.
Not all amplified fragments are overlapping (Figure 7). It
is thus not possible to determine if they correspond to
more than 12 different wheat UGT genes or allelic variants. Their alignment and comparison with representative
members of the different UGT families indicate that they
are all phylogenetically related and derived from the same
ancestor as the UGT85A subfamilly from A. thaliana and
sbHMNGT. None of the fragments corresponded to an obvious orthologue of sbHMNGT.

Discussion
In this paper we investigated the potential of the CODEHOP strategy for targeted isolation of genes from organisms not yet submitted to extensive sequencing and for
exploration of the complexity of selected gene families in
large plant genomes. Special emphasis was given to wheat
as representative of plants with a complex genome. The
CODEHOP method proved extremely useful for the characterization of gene orthologues or homologues in a
broad range of plants species. Focus of the gene search can
be controlled by changing the degree of specificity of the
primers (easily checked by a BLAST analysis) and by the
choice of touch-down PCR temperature. In our hands, the
method was successful where cDNA library screening with

genes with different couples of primers. Location of amplicons of the expected size is indicated by an asterisk. The same
couples of primers were tested with two cDNA libraries made out wheat seedlings treated (+) or not (-) with cloquintocetmexyl and phenobarbital for inducing herbicide metabolism. Some couples of primers such as PUGTb/PUGTer did not provide
any amplified fragment, even at low annealing temperatures. Some (e.g. PUGTe/PUGTer) were effective using stringent annealing temperature.

heterologous probes (e.g. cDNAs from maize for screening wheat libraries) had failed. The main advantage of this
method is to rapidly provide a representative sample of either the allelic variants and recently evolved paralogues,
or of the homologues of a given gene in complex genomes. Compared to other methods, a very high proportion of
useful sequences (more than 90% with some primer couples) is obtained. Besides targeted search for specific expressed sequences, it allows complete exploration of the
different P450 clades in a single organism, which was not
possible using previously described methods. The main
source of failure seems to be local sequence or codon divergence from the consensus or most frequent usage. This
problem should be easily circumvented by using several
primer couples chosen from different regions of the gene.
Using the CODEHOP strategy on subgroups of phylogenetically related genes, families or clades, within large superfamilies such as UGTs or P450s is a powerful approach
for exploring their complexity in various genomes. It is a
very effective tool for the construction of expression libraries for agrochemical and other industrial applications.
It can also be used for identifying genes from a given subgroup expressed at a specific stage of development.
Some plant P450 families result from extensive duplications, some of them forming clusters of up to 13 genes in
Arabidopsis[7]. Some P450 families or subfamilies are
found in only subsets of plant species. Extensive search for
CYP98 genes expressed in wheat seedlings did not reveal
more than 3 different sequences, all related to A. thaliana
CYP98A3. The bread wheat genome is hexaploid and results of successive hybridizations and rearrangements

[32]. This suggests that the three CYP98A10, A11 and A12
genes may correspond each to one of the three wheat genomes, with CYP98A12 which is the most divergent possibly resulting from the most recent genome introduction.
This hypothesis is currently investigated. In agreement
with the low number of CYP98s found expressed in
wheat, no extensive duplication of CYP98 was detected in
other plant species. This observation, together with the
high conservation of the CYP98As gene across evolution
argue for essential functions of the CYP98 genes in higher
plant development. Accordingly, strongly impaired
growth and fertility are observed in cyp98A3 mutants
[[24], S. Goepfert, personal communication]. Similar conservation is observed for other P450 genes participating in
the early phenylpropanoid pathway and hormone homeostasis.
No obvious homologue of the sbHMNGT gene was found
in wheat. This may be connected to the fact that large
amounts of dhurrin are not reported to accumulate in
wheat, since sbHMNGT is described as showing a strong
preference for mandelonitrile substrates [30]. A large
number of related genes, all belonging to the UGT85A
subfamily were however detected. This is not surprising
considering that 6 UGT85A genes have been reported in
the small Arabidopsis genome [33]. Such a duplication of
genes in this family probably reflects an adaptative evolution and their implication in some type of stress/defense
response rather than a developmentally essential function. Significantly, a large number of UGT85A-related sequences are found among wheat ESTs isolated from wheat
challenged with pathogens. Recombinant expression of

such genes should provide a valuable library for pharmacological and toxicological investigations, and for studying evolutionary ecology of plant pathogen interactions.

Conclusions
The CODEHOP strategy appears as a powerful method for
exploring the complexity of gene families in plants with a
large genome, and conservation of genes across evolution.
CYP98s are genes evolved early and are highly conserved
during evolution, as expected for genes with an essential
role in homeostasis and development of vascular plants.
Conversely, the UGT85s are more variable. No orthologue
of the sorghum UGT85B1 gene was detected in wheat,
while UGT85As, found in many plants species, are also
present in wheat. The great variability of this subfamily in
wheat strongly suggests a role in environmental adaptation and plant defense.

Methods
cDNA libraries
Wheat cDNA libraries were constructed from poly(A)+
mRNA from 3–5 mm Triticum aestivum (L. cv. Darius)
seedlings, both control or pre-coated with cloquintocetmexyl (0.1% seed dry weight) and phenobarbital, as described previously [34], in λ ZipLox (GIBCOBRL) by T.

Bioinformatics
CODEHOP primers are designed as to ensure a very high
probability of annealing on the gene of interest with 11–
12 completely degenerate core nucleotides at their 3'-end
and efficient amplification with a consensus 18–25 nucleotide clamp sequence at the 5'-end. Design of the clamp is
based on an alignment of available related sequences and
codon usage of the target organism. Primers completely
degenerate at their 3'-end and ensuring high probability
of annealing to CYP98s or UGTs specific sequences were
designed using the CODEHOP strategy [22] based on the
multiply-aligned sequences: AF029856, AF022458,
AA86449, C74921, D47937, AI881302, AI734373,
AAG52369, AAG52373 for the P450 family CYP98, and
AAF17077, AAF18537, BAA34687 for UGTs. The multiple
alignment was first generated using ClustalW [35], then
cut into blocks using the BlockMaker server [36]. Primers
were designed using the default parameters of the CODEHOP server [37]. It was assumed that barley codon usage
proposed by the server was close enough to that of wheat
to obtain effective primer design.

From the primer solutions proposed by the server, five
P450 primers were selected, which both provided the largest PCR fragments and avoided the most conserved consensus regions common to a large number of P450s. In
the case of UGTs, a broader choice was offered by the server, thus 5 sense and 5 reverse primers could be selected on
the same basis as for P450s.

Probe amplification and analysis
In the present work, the CODEHOP approach was not
used with genomic DNA but with cDNA libraries, our
main objective being to identify genes expressed in specific plant tissues. Screening can be directly performed on
cDNA libraries but better results were obtained after preliminary extraction of cDNA from phages. For extraction,
an aliquot of the cDNA library was heated 10 min at 70°C,
then extracted with one volume of phenol-chloroform.
PCR screening was then performed on 50 ng of this template using 2.6 U of HiFi (Expand High Fidelity, Roche),
1.5 mM Mg2+, 0.3 mM dNTP and 0.5 µM primers in the
polymerase manufacturer's buffer. The PCR program was
designed according to the CODEHOP server's tips, including successively a touch down (A) and a classical (B) PCR
as follows: first 3 min initial denaturation at 94°C, then
(A) 20 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 70°C (-1°C/cycle),
and 2 min at 72°C, then (B) 20 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 2
min at 58°C, and 2 min at 72°C, and finally a 5 min extension. Elongation time was adapted to the largest expected fragment in each screening. When no amplified
fragment was obtained with a primer pair, the touchdown starting temperature of annealing was decreased by
5°C until a successful amplification was achieved.

Analysis and cloning of PCR products
PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels, and fragments of expected size were eluted by centrifugation on
Ultrafree-DA columns (Millipore), precipitated and
cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). E. Coli
XL1blue (Stratagene) was electroporated with 1/10 of the
ligation volume. Inserts from five white colonies were sequenced.

Sequences were analyzed by BLASTx against a local database generated from the data found [33,38]. Non-P450 sequences were xblasted on the NCBI site. The CYP98A10,
CYP98A11 and CYP98A12 names were assigned on the
basis of the full-length coding sequences subsequently
isolated from the cDNA library.
