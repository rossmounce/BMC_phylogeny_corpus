Background

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are one of the largest families of transport proteins constituting the single

largest gene family, comprising about 5% of the genome, in
Escherichia coli [1]. ABC transporters are grouped into several structural classes, or subfamilies, on the basis of amino

information

Conclusions: ABC transporter evolution fits a pattern expected from a process termed 'dynamiccoherence'. This is an unusual result for such a highly conserved gene family as this one, present in
all domains of cellular life. Mechanistically, this may result from the broad substrate specificity of
some ABC proteins, which both reduces selection against gene loss, and leads to the facile sorting
of functions among paralogs following gene duplication.

interactions

Results: We have annotated sequences for all 60 ABC transporters from the Caenorhabditis
elegans genome, and performed a phylogenetic analysis of these along with the 49 human, 30 yeast,
and 57 fly ABC transporters currently available in GenBank. Classification according to a unified
nomenclature is presented. Comparison between genomes reveals much gene duplication and loss,
and surprisingly little orthology among analogous genes. Proteins capable of conferring MDR are
found in several distinct subfamilies and are likely to have arisen independently multiple times.

refereed research

Background: Many drugs of natural origin are hydrophobic and can pass through cell membranes.
Hydrophobic molecules must be susceptible to active efflux systems if they are to be maintained at
lower concentrations in cells than in their environment. Multi-drug resistance (MDR), often
mediated by intrinsic membrane proteins that couple energy to drug efflux, provides this function.
All eukaryotic genomes encode several gene families capable of encoding MDR functions, among
which the ABC transporters are the largest. The number of candidate MDR genes means that study
of the drug-resistance properties of an organism cannot be effectively carried out without taking a
genomic perspective.

acid sequence and domain organization [2] (Figure 1). The
presence of a strongly conserved ATP-binding motif defines
membership in the family and the basic functional organization of an ABC transporter in the membrane is the same from
bacteria to humans, and in all subclasses [3-5]. A complex of
at least two ATP-binding domains, coupled to two blocks of
membrane-spanning helices, appears to be the minimum
requirement for a functional transporter. Often these
domains are found in tandem within a single molecule, but in
many cases are distributed across separate proteins that must
then assemble in the membrane. ABC transporters are collectively able to accommodate an unusually large array of different substrates. This diversity of function is manifest at the
family level, but also in individual members of the family, for
example those associated with multidrug resistance (MDR).
Decottignies and Goffeau [6] catalogued the entire ABC
transporter family of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
in so doing delineated six of the major subgroups of eukaryotic ABC transporters. Allikmets et al. [7] catalogued all the
then known 33 human ABC transporters, including those
known only from partial expressed sequence tag (EST)
sequences, and divided these into seven subfamilies. This
scheme has been adopted, with a revised nomenclature, by
the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) [8] in order to
provide a unified nomenclature for both human and mouse
ABC transporters. Of these seven subfamilies, one, ABCA, has
no exact equivalent in the yeast genome [9,10]. Genes considered to be part of subfamily ABCA have been identified in the
slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, as well as in malaria

parasites [11] and Caenorhabditis elegans (this paper). With
the completion of the human and Drosophila melanogaster
genomes, a joint summary of the ABC transporter complements of both genomes was published [12]. This identified a
new subfamily, ABCH, which appears to be the most divergent yet. One, previously unclassified yeast ABC gene,
YDR061w [13], appears to be a structurally aberrant member
of subfamily H.
The phenotypes of five ABC transporter knockouts have been
reported in C. elegans. Four of these involve genes expected,
by homology to mammalian genes, to be involved in drug
resistance: three P-glycoproteins (Pgp-1, Pgp-3 and Pgp-4)
(subfamily B) and one multi-drug resistance protein (MRP)
[14,15] (subfamily C). These ABC transporter mutants are
associated with sensitivity to environmental insult [16]. Pgp3 mutant strains of C. elegans are more sensitive to the drugs
chloroquine and colchicine. Pgp-1 and mrp-1 strains are
hypersensitive to toxic pigments produced by some bacteria
[17]. All the nematode P-glycoproteins examined so far seem
to be highly expressed in intestinal cells [18], and in the excretory cell, which functions somewhat like a kidney in C. elegans. The mrp-1, pgp-1 and pgp-3 mutant strains have been
reported to be hypersensitive to the heavy metals cadmium
and arsenite [15]. The fifth reported knockout is of the product of the ced-7 gene [19]. Mutant alleles of ced-7 cause a
defect in engulfment of the cell corpses left behind by apoptosis. ced-7 is a member of the ABCA subfamily, and has a similar phenotype to the abca1 gene in humans. ABCA1 protein is
required for engulfment of apoptotic cells by macrophages
and is thought to regulate membrane fluidity through an
increase in phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet
of the cell membrane [20].
The term orthology is used to describe genes separated from
one another by speciation events while paralogy describes
those separated by gene duplication events [21]. Of particular
interest, from the point of view of functional annotation, are
the cases where a pair of genes, one from each of a pair of
organisms, are found. In these cases it is reasonable to presume that the orthologous genes may share a conserved function retained from the same single gene present in the
common ancestor of the two organisms. However, where a
single gene (or set of duplicated genes) in one genome is most
closely related to a set of duplicated (paralogous) genes in
another genome this is sometimes termed co-orthology [22],
and then no particular orthologous pair can be unambiguously specified. In the case of co-orthologs the argument for
retention of analogous functions between members of the sets
of descendant genes is much weaker. Comparison of two complete genomes, those of C. elegans and S. cerevisiae [23],
demonstrated a high fraction of ortholog pairs in gene families involved in core biological functions. Specifically, Chervitz et al. [23] found, when pairing conserved yeast genes with
their most similar worm homologs (subject to a BLAST score
cut-off of < 10-100), 57% of these highly conserved gene pairs

information

In the set of worm and human ABC transporters, only 8 of 49
possible pairs (16%) of sister genes contained a single human
protein and a nematode homolog (Table 3). Similarly, 10% of
ABC transporters were found in orthologous pairs when the
comparison is made between yeast and worm genomes. A
more comprehensive comparison of worm and yeast genomes
[23] came to the overall conclusion that 57% of genes in
highly conserved gene families were found in orthologous
pairs, and the study suggested that such gene families provide
a conserved core proteome which forms the basis of eukaryote biochemistry. ABC transporters are conserved in all
eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, so it is interesting to
note that they are found in orthologous pairs much less frequently than most gene families that are roughly as well conserved. Clearly, ABC transporter evolution has not been
typical of strongly conserved gene families, and while we
might have inferred that ABC-transporter-mediated metabolism differs radically among eukaryotes, this seems improbable, given the broadly comparable set of substrates associated
with ABC transporters in all eukaryotes where they have been
studied.

interactions

We found a total of 60 confirmed ABC transporters in the
annotated protein set derived from the C. elegans genome
sequence. This represents approximately 0.3% of the total
number of genes (approximately 19,000) in the worm
genome. Only 8 of the 60 predicted genes lack any corresponding mRNA (Table 1), and only one (F56F4.6) is

We define membership of a particular gene in an ABC transporter subfamily primarily on the basis of the position of its
ATP-binding domains in our first phylogenetic tree (not
shown). Genes that fell unambiguously within a clade containing genes already assigned to given subfamily, were
included in that subfamily. Where we could not assign a gene
to a particular clade with a significant bootstrap value, the
assignment was made on the basis of which subfamily's members scored highest when that gene was used as query in a
BLAST search. The subfamilies are sometimes named according to the well-characterized mammalian genes that typify
each of them, for example, P-gp (P-glycorprotein), MRP,
White gene homologs, RNAse L inhibitor, GCN20 homologs,
ABC1 and ALDP [7]. These correspond to the HUGO-defined
subfamilies B, C, G, E, F, A and D, respectively. Re-analysis of
the full-length sequences confirmed the placement all C. elegans genes within the preexisting subfamilies, with substantial bootstrap support (Figures 3,4,5,6,7).

An example of our first-pass approach is given in Figure 2,
which shows an analysis of isolated ATP-binding cassette
domains from the human ABC transporters only. In particular, we find that all seven subfamilies recognized by Allikmets
et al. [7] are recovered with significant bootstrap support.
Their finding, that subfamily B is more closely related to the
carboxy-terminal component of subfamily C than the two
halves of ABCC molecules are with one another, is supported
by our results.

Thirty ABC transporters are described in the yeast genome, or
approximately 0.5% of its approximately 6,000 proteins [13].
At present 49 human ABC transporters have been identified
and, at least partially, cloned. They are included here (Figures
3,4,5,6,7 and Table 2) to illustrate their relationships with
nematode proteins, which might then shed light on their biological roles. Inclusion of human as well as D. melanogaster
ABC transporters in our tree allows us to explicitly classify C.
elegans ABC transporters according to the current eight-subfamily taxonomic scheme for ABC transporters [12].

reports

Here we present a classification of all ABC transporters
encoded in the C. elegans genome, based on a phylogenetic
analysis which includes the 49 currently known human ABC
proteins for which there are reliable, public, sequence data.
We took the approach of analyzing primarily the conserved
ATP-binding cassettes from each protein, regardless of the
structural class from which the domain is drawn. This allows
evaluation of the evolutionary history of each protein in the
family, without biases that might result from gene-fusion
events resulting in convergent acquisition of similar domain
structures by distantly related proteins. In addition, we reevaluated the relationships of transporters within statistically
reliable clusters whose members are closely related enough
that structural variations do not lead to errors in alignment.
We did this to capture additional phylogenetic information,
which may be apparent in the less conservative transmembrane domains, at a level of analysis where it is less likely to
be misleading.

involved orthologous, rather than paralogous, pairs of genes.
In this category of core functions they included trafficking,
and, as possibly the largest family of trafficking genes in animal genomes, ABC transporters should be expected to share
in this high level of one-to-one correspondence between
genomes. We expected therefore that this would allow us to
assign predicted functions to newly discovered C. elegans
ABC proteins on the basis of their already-characterized
mammalian orthologs. Following a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of ABC transporters from four eukaryote
genomes, we found that the frequency of orthologous pairs
among ABC transporters was substantially lower than we
expected. Particular domain organizations and substrate specificities seem to have evolved independently several times in
multiple lineages. This is expected to complicate the functional analysis of ABC transporter function in newly characterized genomes.

Conclusions

refereed research

While the conservation of simple orthologous gene pairs is a
rare observation in our study, the numbers of genes in most
ABC transporter subfamilies are about the same, despite
numerous instances of gene duplication and loss. For
example, within ABCB the number of half-transporters in
each genome is almost identical. Furthermore, most mammalian half-transporters in subfamily B are found in clusters of
functionally related, or at least co-localized, genes (the TAP
(B2 and B3) genes, and the four mitochondrial ABCB genes,
MABCs1 and 2 (B8 and B10), MTABC3 (B6) and ABCB7 [32]),
paired with similarly sized groups of C. elegans genes. Likewise the number of genes in subfamilies A, C and D is much
the same between genomes. However, it does appear that C.
elegans, relative to humans, has undergone a massive expansion in the P-gp (full or pseudo-dimer configuration) subclass
of subfamily B, and subfamily G, the 'White-like' genes. The
likelihood that ABC transporter lineages have been lost
repeatedly in evolution is evident from the phylogeny. The
single group of P-gps in mammals contains only four members, while C. elegans has 15 P-gps, of which only three are
closely related to their mammalian homologs. A literal reading of the tree (Figure 4) would suggest the presence of five
additional P-gp lineages in the common ancestor of nematodes, flies and mammals that have been lost, independently,
in both mammals and flies. These losses, and the species-specific expansion of the remaining lineages of genes, underlines
the peculiarly dynamic composition of this group of multifunctional transport proteins.

deposited research

All four of the C. elegans members of subfamilies E and F
(Figure 6) form strongly supported and unambiguous pairs
with their homologs in D. melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and
yeast. This unusually strong conservation, compared to the
other subfamilies of ABC genes, argues for involvement in
something indispensable, at least on an evolutionary timescale. The three genes in subfamily F, which lack transmembrane domains, are generally regarded as forming ribosome
associated proteins involved in regulation of mRNA translation, rather than transporters. The RNase L inhibitor (E1),
also known as the oligoadenylate-binding protein (OABP), is
thought to be involved in the regulation of the interferoninduced antiviral response [28] that bears some similarities
to the mechanism thought to underlie the now common
molecular biology technique of double-stranded RNAdirected interference (RNAi). It also seems to have a role in
muscle differentiation [29] in mammals. The critical role of
the RNase L inhibitor is underlined by its conservation even
in a highly reduced genome. In the rather minimal genome of
the endosymbiotic Guillardia theta nucleomorph (302 genes)

reports

Among ABCC molecules, whose range of functions broadly
overlaps with P-gps, only C18C4.2 (Cft-1) and CFTR (C7) are
indicated as orthologs in our analysis. However, the bootstrap
value on this pairing is very low (51%, see Figure 5), so we cannot attach much confidence to this observation. It may simply
be that C18C4.2 (Cft-1) is a highly divergent member of subfamily C, and does not bear much functional similarity to
CFTR (C7). Although not forming simple pairs with any nematode gene, human MRP5 (C5), a transporter of nucleotide
analogs [26,27], and ABCC11 and ABCC12 appear to be coorthologous to worm F14F4.3 (Mrp-5), which may provide
some hint as to the function of the latter.

the RNase L inhibitor is the only ABC protein found [30]. The
yeast ortholog of the RNase L inhibitor protein, YDR091c, is
essential for growth, as is YER036c, the yeast ortholog of
T27E9.7/ABCF2 [31]. On the other hand GCN20, the yeast
version of F42A10.1/ABCF3, is not essential, although
mutants do have specific defects in translation.

reviews

Within the P-gp-related ABCB subfamily, the only one-to-one
pairings found between C. elegans and human genes are
those of W09D6.6 (Haf-5) and MTABC3 (B6), and
Y48G8AL.11 (Haf-6) and MABC1 (B8). These are both halftransporters localized to the mitochondria. MTABC3 (B6) is
involved in iron homeostasis [24] and its rat ortholog, PRP, is
overexpressed during hepatocarcinogenesis [25]. Two other
mitochondrial ABC transporters in humans, MABC2 (B10)
and ABCB7, have orthologs in flies and/or yeast, but not
nematodes.

Tree of human ATP-binding cassette domains. The evolution of the ABCB subfamily from within the ABCC subfamily, and the structural diversity of

n-term: amino-terminal ABC; c-term: carboxy-terminal ABC. The phylogeny of ATP-binding cassettes from human ABC transporters was produced
according the following procedure. Predicted amino-acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX [54]. Aligned sequences were used to generate matrices
of mean distances among proteins, and these matrices were used to generate a phylogenetic tree according to the neighbor-joining algorithm [55], refined
using the SPR branch-swapping technique under the minimum evolution criterion, implemented by PAUP*4.0b10 [56]. Bootstrapping [57] was used to
determine the relative support for the various branches of the tree (1,000 replicates), and nodes with less than 50% support were collapsed to form
polytomies. The structures of the proteins in which the domains are embedded are indicated according to the color scheme in Figure 1. It should be noted
that branch lengths in the figures are not to scale and do not represent distances between protein sequences. The original alignment files are available as

information

Saurin et al. [35] surveyed the ABC transporters, considering
both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, and found that
there is a fundamental phylogenetic division among ABC
transporters involved in import versus export processes. The
importer class of ABCs is found only in prokaryotes, whereas
exporters are found in all domains of life [35]. However, that
survey, while covering all classes of ABC transporter, was not

comprehensive with respect to any of the organisms surveyed. Most recently, Schriml and Dean [10] compared the
human ABC family to that of the mouse Mus musculus, and
found almost perfect identity between the two genomes. We
have integrated previous information with the complete
inventory of ABC transporters from the genome of the nematode worm C. elegans. We find that most of the ABC transporters in the worm can be classified into the existing human
transporter taxonomy. We find 60 ABC transporters in the
worm genome, representing an overall doubling in size of the
ABC transporter family relative to yeast, whose genome

Subfamily names given are according to the HUGO nomenclature (A-H) [33] as well as the CGC (Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre [61]) gene names
for each subfamily. TM, transmembrane domain, where the number preceding it is the predicted number of membrane spanning helices or the
number in the amino-terminal/carboxy-terminal TM domains, respectively. ABC, ATP-binding cassette. The existence of known cDNAs, whether
complete or partial, is listed according to information in WormBase release WS112 [62]. RNAi phenotypes of genes on chromosome I are given
according to [63], those on chromosomes II, IV, V and X are from [64], those of genes on chromosome III are from [65].

Figure 3. Shown here is the division between the half transporters, which are most of the ABCB genes in mammals, and the full-transporters (called Pglycoproteins (P-gps)) that have evolved from them. Four lineages of P-gps (exemplified by genes F22E10.1-4, T21E8.1-3, C47A10.1 and C54D1.1) have
been lost in both flies and mammals, and of the two remaining P-gp lineages, one has been lost in each of the fly and human lines of descent. Subsequent
duplications within the single remaining P-gp lineage in both flies and mammals have not been sufficient to keep pace with continuing P-gp duplications in
the worm genome.

single protein capable of specifically recognizing several
structurally distinct classes of compounds, and which catalyzes their efflux from the cell or sequestration in a

subcellular compartment. Proteins of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) group (ABCB) transport hydrophobic compounds and
function in transport of lipids and bile from the liver as well
as generally defending the body from toxic natural products

appears to have evolved not just once, but at least three times
in the history of ABC transporters. Given the distribution of
MDR-causing and non-MDR genes among mammalian Pgps; it seems reasonable to infer that MDR genes may well
have arisen more than once among the P-gps themselves. It
has been observed [41,42] that the entire ABC transporter
family is characterized by a highly adaptable common mechanism for coupling substrate binding to ATP hydrolysis and
extrusion. It has been pointed out that, because P-gp

in the diet [37]. P-gps are also a component of the blood-brain
barrier and function in tolerance of drugs normally minimally
toxic to mammals, such as ivermectin [38]. Multi-drug resistance mediated by MRP group (ABCC) proteins depends on a
slightly different mechanism. MRPs seem to function by cotransporting toxic compounds with glutathione, or as glutathione conjugates [36]. An MDR phenotype is also associated
with some members of the ABCG group of transporters, in
both yeast [39] and humans [40]. The MDR phenotype

Schriml and Dean [10] speculated that the distinct clustering
of amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of ABCA proteins suggests that full ABC transporters have generally evolved from
half-transporters. The pattern of structural change within the

The mammalian P-gps include proteins capable of producing
an MDR phenotype (MDR1 (B1)), as well as members with,
apparently, specificity restricted to single physiological substrates such as phosphatidylcholine (MDR3 (B4)). As none of
these have simple, orthologous, relationships with any of the
C. elegans P-gps, no detailed predictions of function in nematode P-gps can be drawn on the basis of phylogeny alone. C.
elegans P-gps do differ from one another in their ability to
cause resistance to various environmental toxins [16], with no
apparent correlation between phenotype and genetic distance
from their mammalian homologs. Both human abca1 and
nematode ced-7 mutants present similar apoptotic phenotypes, despite their rather distant relationship (Figure 3).
ABCA1 mutations also cause defects in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol transport, and it is still an open question as to
whether the analogous function of these two homologs in
apoptosis accurately predicts a sharing of other functions.
Similar limitations on the extent to which function may be
predicted from sequence alone are likely to obtain in those
subfamilies whose members are noted for variability and
multiplicity of function, that is, subfamilies A, B, C and G.

recognizes substrate directly within the cytoplasmic leaflet of
the plasma membrane [43], it does so at a much higher effective substrate concentration than would be the case if it recognized aqueous substrate. As a result, P-gp drug-binding
sites can operate at relatively low affinity, and this, in turn,
facilitates recognition of multiple substrates. This flexibility
may be the key to explaining the range of tasks performed by
ABC transporters, but also their apparently anomalous evolutionary history.

closely related subfamilies ABCD, ABCC and ABCB does suggest that the half-transporter configuration was the ancestral
one for at least these three subfamilies (Figure 2). It also
reveals instances where half-transporters have evolved from
duplicated genes, as in the origination of ABCB from a
fragment of an ABCC gene, and that, in turn, some ABCB
genes have duplicated again, in giving rise to the P-gp genes.
A comprehensive comparison of worm and yeast genomes
[23] noted that while most of the nematode genome did not
closely resemble that of yeast, there was a strongly conserved
20% of the nematode genome that had a high degree of homology to a corresponding 40% of the yeast genome. Within
this highly conserved subset of genes, there was a very frequent finding of orthology between members of the two
genomes. As many as 57% of the most closely related gene
pairs contained exactly one worm and one yeast gene. The
obvious inference is that one corresponding gene was present
in the common ancestor of the two species. Their overall picture of genome evolution is one in which a conserved cadre of
proteins performs core biological functions required by all
eukaryotes. These would remain essentially invariant
throughout eukaryotes, and one expects analogous functions
to be carried out by orthologous genes across large evolutionary distances. These gene families are presumably protected
over the long run by their essential and irreplaceable roles in
basic biochemical functions required by all organisms. However, as Chervitz et al. [23] point out, only a minority of gene
families fit this mode, with most genes belonging to poorly
conserved or taxonomically restricted families.
We expected that the frequency of simple orthologous gene
pairs typical of highly conserved gene families shared by both
yeast and worm would hold true for our comparison between
nematode and human versions of such a highly conserved
gene family as ABC transporters. However, this generality

A computer file, WormPep16 [45], containing 16,332 protein
sequences predicted from the completed C. elegans genome
was searched using the FASTA program [46]. Our initial
query sequences were those of known C. elegans ABC
proteins (for example, Pgp-1, the D. melanogaster white gene
homolog T26A5.1, and so on). Matching protein sequences
returned by FASTA were checked by BLAST [47], using either
the NCBI [48] or Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) servers
[49]. Only those with highly significant matches to annotated
ABC proteins in the sequence database were retained. The
most poorly matched, verified ABC protein from each FASTA
run was used as the query sequence for an additional FASTA
search, and this process was repeated until no new ABC proteins were found. At a later stage in the analysis, representative members of different ABC transporter subfamilies were
used as query sequences to search the updated WormPep81
file using a BLAST server at the Sanger Centre [45]. Searches
were conducted using multiple queries until all proteins
already included in our dataset were found. No additional

Under a power-law distribution, gene families would tend to
be subject to fluctuations of a size on the same order as the
gene-family size itself [44]. We should then expect that

Materials and methods

deposited research

The evolutionary dynamic we propose here is reminiscent of
an explanation put forward by Huynen et al. [44] to explain a
pattern observed in a comparative analysis of 11 microbial
genomes. They found that the frequency distribution of genefamily sizes within each completely sequenced genome
tended to follow a power-law distribution across a 30-fold
range of genome sizes. Their model is one in which genes are
duplicated or deleted randomly in time, but the gene families
are coherent with respect to the probability of duplication or
deletion in each time unit in the simulation. In other words,
the probability of duplicating or deleting a gene may change
over time, but every member of a gene family always has the
same probability of duplication or deletion as every other
member of the family. So, whereas a given family can be
either favored for expansion or targeted for deletion in a given
time period, all members of the family are equally favored or
disfavored by selection at the same time. Huynen et al. argued
that this property of 'dynamic coherence' in a gene family
could arise if all gene-family members have more or less the
same function, so that they are all favored or disfavored by
selection at the same time, depending on how much that function is needed.

We expect that future functional studies, to determine the
extent of parallel and convergent evolution among ABC
transporters, will eventually allow us to discern the fundamental roles of ABC transporters that ensure their long-term
survival as a group. Also of interest will be whether the functional suites of genes fulfilling these roles are bounded in any
way that resembles the phylogenetic subdivisions into which
we presently categorize these proteins.

reports

clearly does not apply to ABC transporters, despite their
strong conservation across all domains of life. It seems reasonable to suppose that the rather loose relationship between
substrate specificity and amino acid sequence that
characterizes ABC transporters allows for much more potential exchange and sorting of biological functions among
homologous genes than is typical. In turn, this pervasive preadaptation for functional overlap enables organisms to survive the occasional loss of substantial numbers of ABC transporters and to rapidly re-evolve lost functionality by coopting homologous genes.

typical gene families will have undergone very substantial
episodes of expansion and near-extinction, and in Huynen et
al.'s model all gene families do become extinct within a finite
time. It is evident that ABC transporters are highly atypical
for a strongly conserved gene family, in that the family as a
whole is highly conserved across genomes despite being subject to the same large fluctuations in size, which would tend to
eventually eliminate gene families whose members are not
individually indispensable. It should be noted that the ABC
family does not seem uniformly subject to one or the other
mode of evolution. Subfamilies E and F, which are not
involved with transport, but rather have roles in translation
and gene regulation, fit the 'strongly conserved' [23] model
very well, retaining simple orthologous relationships over
long spans of time. Only the transporter subfamilies themselves, because of their highly adaptable substrate-recognition capability, are subject to large fluctuations in size. We
propose that finding large sets of paralogous genes, and infrequently conserved orthologs, in a gene family reflects ongoing
cycles of gene loss and reacquisition of analogous functions in
distantly related, newly expanded, lineages. Furthermore, we
suggest that this is in fact the expected outcome of dynamic
coherence, a mode shared, perhaps, by most of the less-conservative gene families, as well as the ABC genes.

ABC proteins were identified, though some sequences were
found to have been included in our dataset twice under different names. These redundant sequences were eliminated.
FASTA searches were run on a SUN Microsystems
UltraSPARC 5 computer. All other computer operations were
carried out on an Apple Power Macintosh G3. Yeast and
human ABC transporter sequences were obtained from NCBI
and are described in the literature [10,13].

Identification of ABC protein features
BLAST + Beauty searches on the BCM server identified the
location of the conserved Walker A and ABC signature motifs
(Prosite motifs [50] PS00017 and PS00211, respectively)
associated with the ATP-binding cassette(s) of each protein.
The number and positions of transmembrane domains in
each ABC protein were predicted by using TopPred II v1.3
[51] and then vetting the program's results by eye to exclude
spurious transmembrane segments. Chromosomal locations
of each ABC protein in the C. elegans genome were looked up
in the C. elegans database AceDB [52].

Phylogenetic analyses
Using the information derived from each protein sequence
(as above) we extracted only the sequence of each predicted
ATP-binding cytoplasmic domain. These domains were
assembled into a single file using the SeqApp1.9 multiple
sequence editor [53], and aligned using ClustalX [54]. In
those cases where two ATP-binding cassettes (ABCs) are
present in a single protein with no intervening transmembrane domains (Subfamilies E and F, see Figure 1), the entire
sequence was divided into two at an arbitrary point halfway
between the two predicted ABC domains. As a result, 'twodomain' proteins are represented twice in our initial analysis.
Once this approach had been used to assign genes to particular well-supported subgroups, we realigned the sequences
and reanalyzed the relationships within each group using fulllength amino acid sequence data.

Aligned sequences were used to generate matrices of mean
distances between proteins, and these matrices were used to
generate phylogenetic trees according to the neighbourjoining algorithm [55], refined using the SPR branch-swapping technique under the minimum evolution criterion,
implemented by PAUP*4.0b10 [56]. Bootstrapping (1,000
replicates) was done according to the method of Felsenstein
[57], using the same parameters described above. Phylogenetic trees were visualized and manipulated using TreeView
1.6.2 [58] and MacClade 3.0.4 [59].
