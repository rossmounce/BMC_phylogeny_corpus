Genes optimized by evolution for accurate
and fast translation encode in Archaea and
Bacteria a broad and characteristic spectrum
of protein functions
Conrad von Mandach1, Rainer Merkl2*

Abstract
Background: In many microbial genomes, a strong preference for a small number of codons can be observed in
genes whose products are needed by the cell in large quantities. This codon usage bias (CUB) improves
translational accuracy and speed and is one of several factors optimizing cell growth. Whereas CUB and the
overrepresentation of individual proteins have been studied in detail, it is still unclear which high-level metabolic
categories are subject to translational optimization in different habitats.
Results: In a systematic study of 388 microbial species, we have identified for each genome a specific subset of
genes characterized by a marked CUB, which we named the effectome. As expected, gene products related to
protein synthesis are abundant in both archaeal and bacterial effectomes. In addition, enzymes contributing to
energy production and gene products involved in protein folding and stabilization are overrepresented. The
comparison of genomes from eleven habitats shows that the environment has only a minor effect on the
composition of the effectomes. As a paradigmatic example, we detailed the effectome content of 37 bacterial
genomes that are most likely exposed to strongest selective pressure towards translational optimization. These
effectomes accommodate a broad range of protein functions like enzymes related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
and the TCA cycle, ATP synthases, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, chaperones, proteases that degrade misfolded
proteins, protectants against oxidative damage, as well as cold shock and outer membrane proteins.
Conclusions: We made clear that effectomes consist of specific subsets of the proteome being involved in several
cellular functions. As expected, some functions are related to cell growth and affect speed and quality of protein
synthesis. Additionally, the effectomes contain enzymes of central metabolic pathways and cellular functions
sustaining microbial life under stress situations. These findings indicate that cell growth is an important but not the
only factor modulating translational accuracy and speed by means of CUB.

Background
The composition of genes coding for ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors is highly biased
in many genomes [1]. This codon usage bias (CUB) is
due to a preference for a species-specific set of codons,
which are named major codons. Their particular choice
depends on the genomic GC-content and can be
explained by amino acid specific rules [2]. Beginning

with pioneering work in the 1980s, it has been demonstrated convincingly that major codons are more accurately and more efficiently recognized by the most
abundant tRNA species [3-10]. These findings support
the hypothesis that major codons are used preferentially in genes coding for proteins required by the cell
in large quantities (see [10] and references therein). A
further analysis of microbial genomes made clear that
CUB is one of several factors to optimize cell growth:
Species exposed to selection for rapid growth possess
more rRNA operons, more tRNA genes and use major
codons more frequently [11,12]. Additionally it turned

out that CUB is the best determinant of minimum generation time [13].
Based on different measures of CUB, the occurrence
and function of translationally optimized gene products has been studied (see e.g. [14,15] and references
therein) and compiled e.g. for Escherichia coli [16],
Frankia [17], or Yeast [18]; however, most reports
lack a statistical assessment. Broad multi-species analyses of 27 [19] and 461 microbial genomes [20]
aimed at identifying preferred functional categories
among codon-optimized genes.
In the following, we report a phylogenetic- and habitat-specific analysis of a particular set of 388 microbial
genomes. We found that gene products being optimized
for translational efficiency in the course of evolution
contribute to protein synthesis, energy production, and
protein folding. Compared to Bacteria, translational efficiency is less pronounced in Archaea and restrained to a
smaller number of gene functions. In most cases, the
function of translationally optimized gene products is
only marginally affected by the habitat.

Results and Discussion
The GCB-approach constitutes a quantitative measure of
translational efficiency for a broad range of genomes

A number of measures for CUB have been used to predict translationally efficient genes in microbial genomes
(e.g. [1,21-28]). Generally, H 1 -methods [21] are more
suitable to determine the bias associated with translational efficiency than other approaches [29]. A recent
comparison of several measures has shown that two
H1-methods, namely the MELP algorithm [30] and the
GCB-approach [31], have the most consistent behaviour
for predicting the expression level of individual
genes [30]. The GCB-approach, which we utilize in the
following, is based on CB-scores determined speciesspecifically for each codon; see Methods. We first computed these scores for the 912 microbial entries of the
NCBI RefSeq database which consists of a curated and
non-redundant collection of reference genomes [32].
We have implemented a web-server (accessible via
http://www-bioinf.uni-regensburg.de) that calculates for
a gene sequence the GCB-score for a wide variety of
microbial species. GCB-scores take positive and negative
values; the more positive a score is, the higher is the
fraction of major codons in the considered gene.
The numbers of rRNA genes, of tRNA genes, and the
genome-wide strength of CUB are highly correlated
[11,13]. In order to confirm that GCB-values quantify
strength of CUB on the genome level as well, we correlated mean values and the number of tRNA genes in
analogy to [11]. The GCB Eff -value was determined for
each genome (see Methods) and taken as a measure for
the species-specific strength of CUB. To minimize the

Page 2 of 12

risk of false positive classification when identifying
translationally optimized genes, we selected those 388
genomes showing a marked CUB (see Additional file 1,
Table S1 for a listing and Methods for the selection procedure). A plot of these 388 values versus the speciesspecific number of tRNA genes is shown in Figure 1A.
A Spearman rank correlation confirmed for the
GCB Eff -values and the number of tRNA genes a statistically significant correspondence (rs = 0.71, p < 0.001),
which is stronger than the one deduced from S values
[11], an alternative measure of CUB. For 113 of these
388 species the minimum generation time is listed in
[13]. A plot of these numbers versus GCB Eff -values is
shown in Figure 1B. Again, a Spearman rank correlation
confirmed a statistically significant correspondence (rs =
-0.75, p < 0.001), which is stronger than the one published elsewhere [13]. Most likely, the stronger correlation is in both cases due to our focusing on genomes
showing a marked CUB.
We conclude from these findings and previous results
[30,31] that the GCB-approach allows us to quantify
strength of CUB in a consistent manner for a broad
range of genes and genomes and to identify translationally optimized genes. Note that we use the term “translationally optimized” for genes showing a marked CUB.
As we did not correlate CUB values and mRNA concentrations for a larger set of species, the term optimization
as used here is not necessarily related to the expression
level of a gene.
In the following, we name the subset of an individual
proteome constituted by genes with a GCB-value ≥ 0.0
the effectome and the above-introduced set of 388
microbial genomes showing a pronounced codon usage
bias MG_CUB. Subsets selected for a specific habitat are
named MG_CUB(subset); e.g., MG_CUB(Bacteria_TH)
comprises the genomes of 13 thermophilic Bacteria
belonging to MG_CUB.
In a previous study [19] M. Carbone has aimed at
characterizing the set of genes deemed to be essential
for any given bacterial species. In this context, the set of
species-specific genes possessing a marked CUB has
been named functional genomic core. Although the
approach of identifying translationally optimized genes
is similar to ours, we did not utilize this term for two
reasons: 1) The concept of a genomic core has been
coined to address the set of intrinsically conserved
genes of a phylogenetic group like Archaea (see e.g. [33]
and references therein). Thus, the above term might be
misinterpreted. 2) Irrespective of the strength of CUB
within an individual genome, those 200 genes showing
strongest CUB have been analyzed in [19]. In contrast, a
species-specific effectome consists of a gene set whose
size and composition is exclusively determined by CUB
and a well-defined cut off.

Figure 1 A plot of GCB Eff -scores versus the number of tRNA genes and the minimum generation time for microbial species. Panel
A: For 388 microbial species constituting the set MG_CUB the number of tRNA genes and the GCB Eff -score was determined as described
and plotted. A Spearman rank correlation confirms the statistically significant correlation of these two values (rs = 0.71, p < 0.001). Panel B: The
minimum generation time for 113 species of MG_CUB (as listed in [13]) was plotted versus the GCB Eff -score. A Spearman rank correlation
confirms the statistically significant correlation of these two values (rs = -0.75, p < 0.001).

Figure 1 shows for Bacteria that the strength of CUB
varies markedly among species. A comparison of
GCB Eff -values makes clear that taxonomical position
and lifestyle affect the bias: The GCB Eff -values of mesophilic and thermo-/hyperthermophilic Archaea are similar; the means are 0.070 and 0.074, respectively. In
contrast, CUB of psychrophilic/mesophilic Bacteria is
higher than that of thermophilic species. The means are
0.10 and 0.06, respectively, and a Mann-Whitney rank
sum test signaled the statistically significant difference
of the two GCB Eff -distributions (p = 0.003). These findings indicate that CUB is less pronounced in Archaea
and strongest in mesophilic and psychrophilic Bacteria.
As pointed out in [13], these differences are most
likely due to the dependence of enzyme activity on temperature and might explain CUB in Bacteria. At higher
temperature, diffusion increases, viscosity and activation
energy decreases, which both facilitate rapid reactions.
Therefore, selective strength on CUB is presumably
weaker for thermophilic species. In analogy, stronger
CUB might be necessary for psychrophilic species to
reach a tolerable growth rate.
Species for which speed and efficiency of growth and
replication were strong selective forces during evolution
are characterized by a high number of tRNA genes [11].
As we expected the widest range of protein functions in
the related effectomes, we selected for further analysis
those 37 bacterial genomes possessing more than 90

tRNA genes. The composition of the respective subset
MG_CUB(Bacteria_HITR) is listed in Additional file 1,
Table S2. The mean GCB Eff -value of this set is 0.15
and indicates a strong selective pressure. Concordantly,
the mean of minimum generation times for those 14
species of MG_CUB(Bacteria_HITR) listed in [13] is 48
min, which is significantly lower than the mean (more
than 8 hours) deduced from the whole list.
Depending on the methods used to assess CUB, different fractions of CUB genes have been identified. It has
been reported that CUB can be detected in ~28% [34],
~50% [35], ~70% [11], or ~100% [20] of microbial genomes. In the light of these findings, our choice of ~42%
of the genomes was a more conservative approach. Here
we decided in agreement with [11] and suggest that the
lifestyle of a microbe determines the strength of CUB.
For species which we did not consider due to a small
GCB Eff -value, we assumed the relative unimportance of
exponential growth.
The effectomes encode a broad and specific range of
gene functions

Each analysis of a single proteome reveals a small number of translationally optimized gene products. However,
to identify general trends that can be subjected to statistical analyses, one has to explore several genomes
and to link the contribution of individual gene products
to a more general description of cellular functions.

To achieve a multi-level categorization of gene products,
we utilized Gene Ontology terms [36] in combination
with the classification system of FunCat [37].
Gene Ontology (GO) terms allow the description of
gene products by means of a strict vocabulary organized
in a hierarchical way. However, assessing the most granular GO-terms used to annotate genes is inappropriate for
our purposes: E.g. in E. coli, the GO-term “DNA binding”
(GO:0004803) is an attribute of transposases, the DnaK
suppressor protein, subunits of the DNA polymerase III,
elements of prophages, transcription activators, and helicases. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the overrepresentation of this term in a biologically meaningful way.
An overrepresentation of the GO-term “RNA binding” in
the effectomes is most probably related to the abundance
of ribosomal proteins. These examples demonstrate that
higher-level descriptions of gene functions have to be
exploited to deduce biologically meaningful results. As an
alternative to the analysis of a GO slim (a set of higher
level GO-terms) we decided to utilize FunCat categories.
FunCat [37] is a functional annotation scheme for the
systematic classification of proteins from whole genomes.
Utilizing FunCat has an important advantage over
GO-terms: As the number of categories needed to classify
effectomes is low, we could compare the full composition
of the effectomes and the whole genomes by means of
robust statistical tests.
For an analysis, we deduced for each gene-product
GO-terms, mapped them onto high-level FunCat categories and assessed their abundance. Relative frequencies

Page 4 of 12

of each category were determined both for a complete
dataset MG_CUB(subset) and the respective effectomes.
To quantify the abundance of a category Cat within a set
of effectomes, we computed the term AbundEff(Cat) which
is the log-odds ratio of relative frequencies (see Methods).
An AbundEff(Cat) value above zero indicates that Cat is
overrepresented in the effectomes, a value below zero signals an underrepresentation. To this end, we determined
for the set of all archaeal and all bacterial genomes AbundEff-scores for FunCat categories of level 1, which is the
most abstract level of describing protein functions. Results
are plotted in Figure 2 and listed in Table 1. These differences in the composition of the effectomes and the underlying whole-genome datasets are statistically significant as
confirmed by a chi-square test (p < 0.001).
The comparison of AbundEff-values indicates a trend
towards the translational optimization of several systemic functions. In the following, the number of FunCat
categories is given in brackets after their name. As
expected, proteins contributing to “protein synthesis”
(12) are a major element of the effectomes. In addition,
the category “energy” (2) is overrepresented. These findings show that effectomes are to a great extent composed of proteins being related to cell growth and
energy production. However, the underrepresentation of
“metabolism” (1) and of “transcription” (11) indicates
that there is no general trend to optimize translational
efficiency of all functions related to cell growth. The
categories “cellular communication/signal transduction
mechanism” (30), “transposable elements, viral and

Figure 2 Abundance of metabolic functions in archaeal and bacterial effectomes. For all FunCat categories of level 1, the AbundEff-values
were deduced from the datasets MG_CUB(Archaea) and MG_CUB(Bacteria). Positive scores indicate categories overrepresented in the effectomes.
Underrepresented categories have negative values. The categories are numbered according to the FunCat scheme: “metabolism” (1), “energy” (2),
“cell cycle and DNA processing” (10), “transcription” (11), “protein synthesis” (12), “protein fate (folding, modification, destination) “ (14),
“regulation of metabolism and protein function” (18), “cellular transport, transport facilitation and transport routes” (20), “cellular communication/
signal transduction mechanism” (30), “cell rescue, defense and virulence” (32), “interaction with the environment” (34), “transposable elements,
viral and plasmid proteins” (38), “cell fate” (40), “development (systemic) “ (41), “biogenesis of cellular components” (42), “subcellular location” (70).
AbundEff-values were plotted if the number #All(Cat) was at least 100 (compare Table 1).

Sum:

For archaeal and bacterial genomes, the number of gene products contributing to FunCat categories was determined. The column labeled #All(Cat) gives the
number of genes deduced from the whole dataset. The column labeled #Eff(Cat) gives the number of genes belonging to the respective effectomes. The column
AbundEff lists the ratio log(fEff (Cat)/fAll(Cat)) for the category, if #All(Cat) was at least 100. In all other cases a trend is given indicated by a “-” for
underrepresentation. The line labeled Sum lists the number of genes being analyzed.

plasmid proteins” (38) and “regulation of metabolism
and protein function” (18) have lowest AbundEff-values.
Most likely, due to their uncritical cellular concentration, elements of regulatory processes (categories 18 and
30) do not undergo optimization of translational efficiency. The codon usage of transposable elements (category 38) and of alien genes is frequently not optimized
for their host [38] which explains most likely their
underrepresentation in the effectomes. Alternatively, we
utilized COG-categories [39] for high level classification
because of their different approach of grouping genes.
Results are listed in Additional file 1, Table S3 and confirm the general trends. In summary, the analysis reveals
a consistent tendency, which is at the systemic level
independent of taxonomical position: Both in Archaea
and in Bacteria, translationally optimized genes are
involved in protein synthesis; additionally they contribute to various cellular functions as e.g. to energy
production.
The habitat has a minor effect on the composition of the
effectomes

To study the impact of the habitat on the composition of
effectomes, we determined AbundEff-values for the set of
all archaeal and all bacterial effectomes, for MG_CUB(Bacteria_HITR) and for subsets of hyperthermophilic, thermophilic, mesophilic, psychrophilic, aquatic, terrestrial,

host-associated, aerobic, anaerobic, non-halophilic, and
moderately halophilic Archaea or Bacteria contributing to
MG_CUB, if the subset contained at least seven genomes;
see Additional file 1, Table S4. For a more detailed analysis
of the effectomes and to corroborate the overrepresentation of specific functions not detectable at FunCat level 1,
we determined AbundEff-values for FunCat categories of
level 2 and compiled them in Additional file 2. Table 2
lists for 12 habitats categories overrepresented in at least
one subset of archaeal or bacterial effectomes. In agreement with the above findings, sub-categories related to
“protein synthesis” (12.01, 12.04, 12.07) are overrepresented in archaeal and bacterial effectomes. Additionally,
specific functions belonging to “protein folding and stabilization” (14.01) are overrepresented both in bacterial and
archaeal effectomes. Compared to Bacteria, archaeal effectomes contain a smaller number of gene products related
to energy production. In bacterial effectomes enzymes
being parts of “glycolysis and gluconeogenesis” (2.01) and
of the “tricarboxylic-acid pathway (citrate cycle, Krebs
cycle, TCA cycle)” (2.10) are the dominating elements of
energy production. All other protein functions are less
overrepresented in bacterial effectomes. As expected,
AbundEff-values of bacterial genomes being most optimized for cell growth [represented by MG_CUB(Bacteria_HITR)] are in many cases most extreme (compare
Table 2) and deviate in some cases from general

For archaeal and bacterial genomes, the number of gene products contributing to FunCat categories of level 2 was determined (see Methods). The columns lists
the ratio log(fEff (Cat)/fAll (Cat)) for the categories, if #All(Cat) was at least 100 (compare Table 1). In all other cases a trend is given indicated by a “+” for
overrepresentation, a “-” for underrepresentation and a 0 for a score value of 0.0. An “x” indicates categories not occurring in the respective dataset.

tendencies. In summary, a comparison of the AbundEffvalues indicates two general trends: 1) The composition of
archaeal effectomes is focused on a smaller number of systemic gene functions. 2) The habitat has only a minor effect
on effectome composition. Figure 3 illustrates the latter
finding for nine bacterial habitats: In nearly all cases, the
strength of over- or underrepresentation is similarly high.
A paradigmatic case: The effectome composition of
bacterial genomes being strongly optimized for cell
growth

In order to analyze effectome composition on the level
of individual gene products, we used the eggNOG database [40], which consists of functionally annotated clusters of orthologous genes (COGs) [39]. Additionally, we

mapped enzymes onto reference pathways of the KEGG
database [41]. To study a prominent example, we analyzed the effectomes of those Bacteria which show
strongest signals of translational optimization [the set
MG_CUB(Bacteria_HITR)]. The composition of these
effectomes is compiled in Additional file 3; respective
identifiers for the eggNOG and KEGG database are
listed in Additional file 4. Some examples that substantiate the broad range of gene functions contributing to
these effectomes are given in the following list, which is
sorted according to FunCat categories and annotated
according to eggNOG.

of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway and the TCA
cycle are elements of these effectomes; see Additional
file 5, Figure S1 and Additional file 6, Figure S2.
The analysis of multiple genomes allows a fine grained
correlation of CUB and gene functions

Due to the small number of CUB genes being identified
in a single genome, former analyses of individual genomes or small sets of related species (see e.g. [14]) could
identify only a small set of individual gene functions
being translationally optimized. These results have been
confirmed by [19,20] and our findings. These three
multi-species analyses agree in detecting an overrepresentation of translationally optimized genes in central
metabolic functions like in protein synthesis or energy
production. However, for other high level functions,
some findings presented here and in [19] or [20] differ.
Considering individual genes, many of our results
coincide with the outcome of [19], which is based on a
smaller set of genomes. This is also true for less pronounced gene functions like the elements of the photosynthesis system of Synechocystis, the role of ferredoxin
in Pyrococcus abyssi and the central enzymes of
methane metabolism in Methanosarcina acetivorans. In
contrast, all proteins involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis [42] do not belong to the effectome of M. acetivorans, as their GCB-value is ≤ -0.03. The conclusions
drawn on the level of metabolic pathways are contrary

Page 8 of 12

in some cases, too. For example, in the effectomes of
Archaea and Bacteria elements of the transcription
apparatus (FunCat category 11) and of transmembrane
signal transduction (FunCat category 30.05) are significantly underrepresented, which is in contrast to the postulated composition of functional genomic cores [19].
Our approach regards a metabolic function as translationally optimized only if more than the expected number of related genes shows a marked CUB. It is a matter
of debate whether CUB in a small number of related
genes is sufficient to declare a whole metabolic process
as translationally optimized.
A recently published study [20] has been based on a
machine learning approach for the identification of
genes possessing an optimized codon usage (OCU). At
mean, the considered genomes have contained 13.2% of
OCU genes, in extreme cases, 33% of the genomic content has been OCU. These genes have been utilized to
corroborate the enrichment or depletion of metabolic
functions which have been characterized by means of
GO-terms. In contrast, the effectomes analyzed here, are
much smaller: 86% of the effectomes are constituted by
at most 5% of the respective genomic content; only four
Borrelia species possess effectomes containing more
than 25% of their genes. Despite these differences in the
amount of CUB genes, the outcomes of both studies
overlap to a great extent considering high-level metabolic functions. For example, “electron transport and
membrane associated energy conservation” (FunCat
category 2.11) and the respective GO-term “ATP synthesis coupled proton transport” were reported as overrepresented. The same is true for functions related to
protein folding and elements of energy production like
the TCA cycle. Both studies identify an underrepresentation of functions related to “DNA repair” and “inorganic ion transport” (see Additional file 1, Table S3). On
the other hand, an enrichment of functions related to
antibiotic biosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and of ironsulfur cluster assembly has only been observed among
OCU genes.
Most interestingly, both analyses made clear that the
habitat has only a little effect on the set of translationally optimized genes. The habitat-specific analyses did
not identify an additional translationally optimized highlevel metabolic function. However, considering more
specific functions, some habitat-specific findings differ.
For example, the overrepresentation of aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases was only identified for MG_CUB(Bacteria_HITR). Most plausible, these disparities as well as
those of enrichment/depletion factors are due to the
approach-specific choice of analysed gene sets: Effectomes contain exclusively genes showing a marked CUB
found in a small set of genomes whereas OCU genes
are larger subsets of genomes and have been recruited

von Mandach and Merkl BMC Genomics 2010, 11:617
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/617

from a larger set of species. This might e.g. explain why
the overrepresentation of genes related to bacterial chromatin is much lower in the effectomes than among
OCU genes. The ratios of enrichment factors are 1.34/
6.43 for Fis, 1.27/6.21, for IHF, and 1.64/3.82 for Dps,
respectively. On the other hand, the maximal enrichment factor for GO-terms among bacterial OCU genes
is 8.3. In bacterial effectomes “ribosomal biogenesis” is
overrepresented more than 10-fold and “cellular communication” and “transposable elements, viral and plasmid proteins” are depleted more than 10-fold. These
differences suggest as future work a more detailed analysis of translationally optimized genes categorized
according to the individual strength of CUB.
The analysis of effectomes contributes to a more detailed
understanding of critical conditions in microbial life

Most of our knowledge about molecular biology and the
physiology of microorganisms has been deduced from
batch culture, chemostats, and turbidostats. However,
this state of balanced growth is completely unnatural for
practically all microbes [43]. In many natural habitats
nutrients and energy supplies are limited most of the
time. This is why microbes exist in a continuous state of
starvation and are in addition competing with other
microorganisms for survival. It is difficult to simulate
such situations in wet-lab experiments.
In contrast, CUB is the result of selection that shapes
individual genomes on an evolutionary timescale. Thus,
analysing CUB allows the identification of cellular functions requiring the optimization of translational efficiency in the natural environment. This is why the
composition of the effectomes indicates critical elements
of metabolic functions and identifies proteins whose
translational accuracy and speed is crucial in situations
occurring frequently in the typical microbial habitat.
Knowing these critical functions is an important value
in itself, but this knowledge might also be relevant for
the tailoring of productive strains. For example, our analysis of bacterial genomes being strongly optimized for
cell growth made clear that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
are overrepresented in the respective effectomes. If
related strains are used for protein production, it is
plausible to assess codon usage and the in vivo concentration of these enzymes in order to maximize the yield.
A comparison of GCB Eff -values and the composition
of the effectomes highlight a consistent trend: Generally
and independent of the strength of CUB, several central
functions involved in protein synthesis, energy production, and protein folding are translationally optimized.
Additionally, in certain habitats and due to the prevalent
selective forces, both the strength of CUB and the palette of translationally optimized gene products increase.

Page 9 of 12

This hypothesis is supported by the above mentioned
overrepresentation of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The
effectomes of MG_CUB(Bacteria_HITR) contain tRNA
synthetases that load 16 different amino acids. Most
plausibly, three synthetases do not occur in the effectomes because they are related to amino acids (Trp,
Cys, His), which are rare in microbial proteins. The
fourth and last aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase missing
in the effectomes is tRNA(Gln). In several Bacteria,
Gln-tRNA Gln is produced by means of a mischarged
Glu-tRNAGln and a Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase (consisting of subunits A, B, C) through the transamidation
of misacylated Glu-tRNA Gln [44]. Due to the small
number of genes, a statistically sound analysis is not
possible in this case. However, in the genomes of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, and Bacillus thuringiensis, which lack a glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, the large
subunits A and B of the aspartyl/glutamyl-tRNA(Asn/
Gln) amidotransferase have only slightly negative GCBvalues (-0.05 and -0.08, respectively). This finding is a
further indicator for the fine-tuned composition of
microbial effectomes.
In competitive environments nature has found many
ways of improving cell growth and response times. A
stunning example is the distinctive codirectionality of
replication and transcription as e.g. seen in Clostridium
tetani. 82% of the genes are transcribed in the same
direction as DNA replication [45]. Along these lines, our
findings highlight a further facet of the complexity of
microbial genomes, their composition, and regulation by
confirming the importance of translational efficiency for
a large number of protein functions.

Conclusions
Cell growth is an important but not the only factor
modulating translational efficiency

Definitely, the optimization of protein synthesis is the
strongest selective factor dominating the composition of
effectomes. This statement is confirmed by the finding
that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases loading abundant
amino acids have been optimized by evolution for translational accuracy and speed. However, the underrepresentation of protein functions involved in transcription
and metabolism makes clear that only a specific subset
of functions related to cell growth are subject to translational optimization. Our results show that several selective forces modulate the level of translational efficiency.
This hypothesis is confirmed by the overrepresentation
in the effectomes of chaperones, which assist protein
folding, and of proteases, which degrade misfolded proteins. Minimizing damage due to radicals and oxygen as
well as the rapid control of DNA replication and gene
expression are additional and crucial tasks supported by
translationally optimized gene products.

Methods
MG_CUB, a non-redundant set of microbial genomes
with a marked CUB

We used the microbial genomes section of the Reference Sequence database (RefSeq, version as of Feb.
2009, 912 replicons) [32] to access a non-redundant collection of richly annotated chromosomes. To concentrate on species with a marked CUB that indicates
translational efficiency, we selected datasets containing
at least five ribosomal genes with a GCB-value ≥ 0.0
and at least one gene with a GCB-value ≥ 0.1. After
eliminating entries belonging to the same taxonomical
genus, the complete dataset MG_CUB contained 388
microbial genomes (see Additional file 1, Table S1). The
subset of bacterial genomes MG_CUB(Bacteria) subsumes 370 entries with 1 175 058 genes. The subset
MG_CUB(Archaea) contains 18 genomes and 39 092
genes. Analogously, subsets containing habitat- or
taxon-specific groups HS were named MG_CUB(taxon_HS); e.g., MG_CUB(Bacteria_TH) is the subset of
genomes from thermophilic Bacteria; see Additional file
1, Table S4 for details. All subsets analyzed here contain
at least seven genomes. The habitat of the microbes was
taken from the file ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/
Bacteria/lproks_0.txt. Minimum generation times are
from [13].
Determination of GCB-values

The GCB-approach follows the classical and proven concepts of scoring-functions as e.g. utilized for sequence
comparison [46,47] or the identification of horizontally
transferred genes [48]. It is based on a species-specific set
of codon bias (CB) scores. A CB-score is defined as
CB j (cdn i ) = log(

Here f

j
mean

j
f ref (cdn i )
j
f mean (cdn i )

).

(cdn i ) is the mean frequency of codon cdni

j
in the genome of species j and f ref (cdn i ) is the codon
usage in a set of reference genes from genome j. As has
been shown, ribosomal genes are a valid starting point
to determine reference frequencies [30,49]. In order to
deduce CB-scores from genes with strongest bias, the
GCB-approach initially starts with codon frequencies of
ribosomal genes and utilizes a steepest gradient method
to iteratively improve the CB-scores similarly to the
concept of [27]. Using CB-values, the GCB-score of an
individual gene from species j is determined as

GCB( gene, j) = GCB(cdn1 , cdn 2 ,..., cdn n , j)
=

1
n

n

∑ CB (cdn ).
j

Page 10 of 12

As a measure for the strength of CUB in a genome j,
we utilize the mean

GCB Eff ( j) =
m

m

∑ GCB(gene , j)
k

k =1

deduced from the m genes of genome j with GCB
(genek,j) ≥ 0.0, i.e. the species-specific effectome. By limiting the calculation to the content of the effectome, we
avoid the likely distortion of the mean value caused by
horizontally acquired genes. Due to their origin, most
alien genes possess an unrelated codon usage [38].
Thus, a mean GCB-value inferred from the whole genome depends on the origin and the fraction of alien
genes, which might render useless this indicator of
translational efficiency.
Mapping genes to FunCat and scoring the abundance
of categories

For each gene product, GO-terms [36] were used to
relate the product to FunCat categories [37]. The FunCat
system is a one to many mapping of individual gene products to functional categories. For that reason, we have
not reported on categories like “protein with binding
function or cofactor requirement (structural or catalytic)”
(16), which are in the case of effectomes dominated by
ribosomal proteins. For a taxon- or habitat-specific set of
genomes MG_CUB(taxon_HS), the number of gene products contributing to each FunCat category Cat was
determined both for the whole dataset (#All(Cat)) and
those genes belonging to the related effectomes (#Eff
(Cat)). A log-odds score AbundEff was deduced from the
resulting frequencies fAll(Cat) and fEff (Cat) as
Abund Eff (Cat ) = log( f Eff (Cat ) / f All (Cat )).

A log-odds ratio above zero indicates that more than
the number of genes expected due to the distribution of
categories in the whole dataset occurs in the effectome.
AbundEff-values quantify over- and underrepresentation
of categories symmetrically about zero according to log
(a) = -log(1/a). For a two-fold over- and the respective
underrepresentation follows: log(2) = 0.30 and log(1/2)
= -0.30. In order to avoid outliers caused by a too small
number of samples, we only analyzed subsets that contained at least seven genomes.
Determining the function of individual proteins

The UniProt interface [50] was used to map RefSeq
identifiers of individual genes onto UniProtKB accession
numbers which were fed into the eggNOG database
[40]. Thus, we deduced for a set of genes from different
genomes a categorized description of protein function in

von Mandach and Merkl BMC Genomics 2010, 11:617
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/617

terms of COG classes [39]. Based on RefSeq identifiers,
KO-numbers were determined, mapped onto KEG reference pathways [41], and plotted color-coded.
