Abstract
Dobrava virus (DOBV) and Saaremaa virus (SAAV) are two closely related hantaviruses carried by
different rodent species. The distinction of these two viruses has been a matter of debate. While
the phylogenies based on the viral M segment sequences were repeatedly showing monophyly of
SAAV strains, some trees based on the S segment sequences were not, thus causing questions on
the demarcation between these two viruses. In order to clarify this issue, the current collection of
the virus S segment sequences was subjected to extensive phylogenetic analysis using maximum
likelihood, maximum parsimony and distant matrix methods. In all inferred phylogenies, the SAAV
sequences were monophyletic and separated from DOBV sequences, thus supporting the view that
SAAV and DOBV are distinct hantavirus species. Since collection of the S segment sequences used
in this study "obeyed" the molecular clock, calculations of the split of DOBV and SAAV were now
repeated resulting in an estimation of 3.0–3.7 MYA that is very close to the values obtained earlier.

Background
Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) are
enveloped viruses with a segmented, single-stranded RNA
genome of negative polarity [1]. The large (L) segment
encodes the viral RNA polymerase, the medium (M) segment the two surface glycoproteins, and the small (S) segment the nucleocapsid protein (N). Hantaviruses cause
two human zoonoses, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas [reviewed in [2]]. DOBV is
carried by yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and
is associated with severe HFRS in the Balkans (Slovenia,
Albania and Greece). SAAV is carried by striped field
mouse (A. agrarius) [3]. So far, the virus has been found in
Estonia, the European part of Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Hungary, Denmark and Germany [2].

SAAV was initially called an A. agrarius-carried variant of
Dobrava virus [3], but the accumulating data suggest that
the virus should be regarded as a distinct hantavirus species. It is carried by a specific rodent host [3], there is a
four-fold difference in two-way cross-neutralization tests
[4], and the coexistence of SAAV and DOBV in the same
geographic region [5,6] indicates reproductive isolation.
They also exhibit 6.1–6.3% difference in the glycoprotein
precursor amino acid sequences. This level is a fraction
lower than the officially accepted 7% cut-off value [1]. It
should be mentioned that some of the officially approved,
distinct hantavirus species show lower than 7% diversity
in their N or GnGc-sequences: Sin Nombre and New York
viruses, Topografov and Khabarovsk viruses, Rio Mamore
and Laguna Negra viruses, and Blood Land Lake and Prospect Hill viruses [7].

SAAV and DOBV also exhibit only 3% diversity on their N
protein sequences. This unusually low level of diversity is
most probably a reflection of host switching in their evolution [8,9]; this event seems to be historically recent

(2.7–3.4 MYA) and these two viruses are still diverging
[8]. There is another important feature differentiating
DOBV and SAAV, and that is the apparently different
pathogenicity in humans: while DOBV causes severe

HFRS in humans, SAAV causes a milder form of the disease, similar to nephropathia epidemica [2]. This difference is also reflected in different pathogenicity in suckling
mice: DOBV is lethal to suckling mice, while SAAV is not
[10].

additional DOBV and SAAV sequences were then
included to this set, a new phylogenetic tree was created,
and indeed, a change in the topology was seen. The SAAV
sequences turned monophyletic with a puzzle support of
71% (Fig. 2).

The phylogenetic distinction of SAAV and DOBV was
recently a matter of debate [11,12]. While the phylogenies
based on the M segment/GnGc protein sequences were
repeatedly showing monophyly of SAAV strains, some
trees based on the S segment/N protein sequences were
not [[11,13], and our unpublished observations], thus
causing questions on the demarcation between these two
viruses. In order to clarify this issue, the current collection
of DOBV and SAAV S segment sequences was subjected to
extensive phylogenetic analysis. Especially important
additions to the dataset include an A. agrarius -derived
SAAV strain from Denmark, Saaremaa/Lolland/Aa1403/
2000 [AJ616854), and two DOBV sequences from southern Russia, P-s1223/Krasnodar-2000 (AF442623) and As1/Goryachiy Klyuch-2000 (AF442622). Our earlier data
indicated that these sequences could be helpful for resolving the S phylogeny [14].

In order to confirm the phylogeny, trees were calculated
using different algorithms listed earlier (Table 2). All
methods agreed on placing DOBV and SAAV sequences
into their own clusters. Placing of the two above mentioned DOBV sequences derived from southern Russia
was more variable, but in most cases they were sharing a
common ancestor with the other DOBV strains. The puzzle support values and bootstrap support for the DOBV
cluster were in most cases very high (79–100%). For
SAAV, the support was more variable, but only in two out
of 12 phylogenies below the widely accepted confidentiality limit (70%) [16]. The support values were also varying depending on the phylogenetic algorithm, on the
parameters used, and on the sequences chosen as outgroup. In the case of maximum likelihood trees, the use of
additional hantavirus sequences as outgroup resulted in a
lower bootstrap support for SAAV. In fact, a 100% support
for SAAV monophyly was reached, when no outgroup
sequences were used at all. This algorithm goes through
an exhaustive search of all the possible trees, and it is possible that additional information creates an interfering
noise to the phylogenetic signal. The opposite was happening with Fitch-Margoliash distance-matrix method. As
more sequences were added, the bootstrap support for
SAAV was increasing, most probably due to more accurate
distance estimations. Nevertheless, in every tree, all the
SAAV sequences were monophyletic and separated from
DOBV. It should be stressed that bootstrap or puzzle support values do not estimate accuracy of a tree (i.e. right
topology), but precision (how many trees had to be
rejected) [17]. Phylogenies inferred here with different
algorithms, and by varying the parameters used in the
analyses (Table 2), gave a consensus answer on the monophyly of all SAAV strains, thus suggesting that this tree
topology is most accurate.

Results and discussion
Our analysis was restricted to nt 37–1232 of the S segment
available for all the strains. This part of the S segment
includes almost complete coding region for the N protein.
Accession numbers for the sequences are given in Table 1.
Since recombinant sequences might influence phylogenetic reconstructions (e.g. by "breaking" the molecular
clock [15]), we wanted to check whether the sequences
used in this study included any recombinants ones. A similarity plot (Stuart Ray's SIMPLOT2.5) was created in
order to visualize the pattern of similarity between the
DOBV and SAAV S segment nucleotide sequences, and
phylogenetic trees were created on partial sequences, that
were possibly of recombinant origin. Although we have
found some indications on a recombinant origin of the
strain Lolland (in particular, nt 200–460 were most similar to the Estonian SAAV strains, while other regions, especially nt 1150–1450, were more similar to SAAV strains
from Russia and Slovakia), they were not unequivocal. For
instance, the SIMPLOT data were not mirrowed by a
mosaic-like pattern of the N protein sequence of Lolland
strain. Moreover, the presence of this sequence did not
"break" the molecular clock (see below). The Lolland
sequence was, therefore, not excluded from our data set.

Earlier it has been estimated, that the split of DOBV and
SAAV happened 2,7–3.4 million years ago (MYA) (10).
Since the larger collection of the S segment sequences
used in this study "obeyed" the molecular clock, these calculations were now repeated resulting in an estimation of
3.0–3.7 MYA.

Conclusion
Next, we wanted to study whether the new additional
sequences would have any effect on the clustering of
DOBV and SAAV. A phylogenetic tree was re-calculated
with the same collection of sequences and same parameters as has been done by Klempa et al. [11] (Fig. 1). The

In all phylogenies inferred in this study using different
approaches such as maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and distant matrices, the SAAV sequences were
monophyletic and separated from DOBV sequences, thus

supporting the view that SAAVand DOBV are distinct
hantavirus species.

Methods
Sequences were handled with BIOEDIT [18], and alignments were created using CLUSTALX [19]. The various
methods used for phylogenetic analysis included maximum likelihood ("classic" maximum likelihood from
PHYLIP [20] and TreePuzzle [21], maximum parsimony
(PHYLIP) and distance matrix methods Neighbor joining
and Fitch-Margoliash (PHYLIP). 500 boostrap replicates
were used in PHYLIP programs and 10000 puzzling steps
in TreePuzzle. MODELTEST and PAUP were used to
check, which DNA substitution model would fit best to
this data set [22,23]. The test for molecular clock and estimation of the time of split of these two viruses was done
with TreePuzzle [21].
