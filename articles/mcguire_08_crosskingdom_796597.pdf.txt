<p>A comprehensive survey of alternate splicing across 42 eukaryotes so as to gain insight into how spliceosomal introns are recognized.</
Cross-kingdom alternative splicing

Abstract
Background: Variations in transcript splicing can reveal how eukaryotes recognize intronic splice
sites. Retained introns (RIs) commonly appear when the intron definition (ID) mechanism of splice
site recognition inconsistently identifies intron-exon boundaries, and cassette exons (CEs) are
often caused by variable recognition of splice junctions by the exon definition (ED) mechanism. We
have performed a comprehensive survey of alternative splicing across 42 eukaryotes to gain insight
into how spliceosomal introns are recognized.
Results: All eukaryotes we studied exhibit RIs, which appear more frequently than previously
thought. CEs are also present in all kingdoms and most of the organisms in our analysis. We
observe that the ratio of CEs to RIs varies substantially among kingdoms, while the ratio of
competing 3' acceptor and competing 5' donor sites remains nearly constant. In addition, we find
the ratio of CEs to RIs in each organism correlates with the length of its introns. In all 14 fungi we
examined, as well as in most of the 9 protists, RIs far outnumber CEs. This differs from the trend
seen in 13 multicellular animals, where CEs occur much more frequently than RIs. The six plants
we analyzed exhibit intermediate proportions of CEs and RIs.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that most extant eukaryotes are capable of recognizing splice
sites via both ID and ED, although ED is most common in multicellular animals and ID predominates
in fungi and most protists.

Background

Intron splicing occurs in all domains of life, but the splicing
methods employed and the frequencies of splicing vary
among organisms. Bacteria and archaea lack the spliceosomal
pathway and splice infrequently via self-splicing introns.
Among unicellular eukaryotes, there is substantial range in

splicing frequency [1,2]. Many early-branching eukaryotes,
including the protists Giardia, Cryptosporidia, Trypanosoma, Entamoeba, and Trichomonas, have few or no introns.
Only 5% of genes are spliced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[3], a yeast, while the average number of introns per gene
among other fungi is generally low (with a few noteworthy

exceptions). Their average intron density ranges from just
over one in Schizosaccharomyces pombe to approximately
five in Cryptococcus neoformans [4]. Protists have similarly
low rates of splicing. In contrast, multicellular animals often
have large numbers of introns (over seven per gene in vertebrates), while plants have intermediate numbers of introns
(approximately four per gene in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana).
The number of introns and recognized splice sites may vary
between individual mRNA transcripts of a single gene, giving
rise to the phenomena of splice variation and alternative
splicing. In this paper we use 'splice variation' to describe any
difference in intron processing, reserving the term 'alternative splicing' for splice variation that is regulated and functionally significant. Observed splice variation is a
combination of programmed alternative splicing events and
splicing errors. Functional alternative splicing may result
from various causes, including ontogenic changes and environmental stimuli. As the number of genes in an organism is
not well correlated with its complexity, alternative splicing
may provide an additional layer of regulation that permits
greater complexity in higher organisms [5]. Multicellular
organisms may generate different splice forms of the same
gene in different tissues, or even within different cells in the
same tissue [5,6]. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that alternative splicing can vary between individuals
in a heritable manner [7].
Splice variants can be divided into four broad categories:
retained introns (RIs), cassette exons (CEs), competing 5'
splice sites, and competing 3' splice sites. CEs are the predominant form of splice variation in multicellular eukaryotes
[8-10], whereas RIs are more frequent in multicellular plants
such as A. thaliana and O. sativa [11-13], as well as the fungus
Cryptococcus and in yeast [14-17].
The profile of splice variants in a given organism is likely
influenced by the mechanisms it uses to identify and process
splice sites. In eukaryotes, it has been proposed that the spliceosome recognizes splice sites in pairs, either across the
intron (intron definition (ID)) or across the exon (exon definition (ED)) [9]. In ID, splice sites on either side of an intron
are recognized as a unit, while in ED, splice sites on either side
of an exon are recognized as a unit. Experiments in both yeast
and Drosophila have shown that when splice sites are presumably recognized by ID, mutating a single splice site disrupts splicing of the intron adjacent to the mutation. This
leads to an RI, but has no effect on the splicing of nearby
introns [17,18] (Figure 1). In contrast, when splice sites are
presumably recognized by ED, mutating a single splice site
affects not only the splicing of the intron adjacent to the
mutation, but also the intron on the other side of the exon
adjacent to the mutation. This causes cassette exons to be
skipped [19,20]. Therefore, it is believed that with ID, splicing
errors are more likely to result in RIs, while with ED, splicing

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R50

McGuire et al. R50.2

errors are more likely to result in CEs. ID and ED are not
mutually exclusive; in Drosophila melanogaster, ID and ED
have been shown to operate within a single mRNA [21].
The method used to recognize splice sites has been associated
with restrictions on exon and intron length. Recognition of
splice sites with ED appears to constrain exon length [20,22],
while recognition with ID limits intron length [18,23]. FoxWalsh et al. [24] suggest that splice site recognition across the
intron in D. melanogaster ceases at lengths greater than
around 200-250 bp. A review of previous studies suggests
that phylogenetic trends in exon and intron length may be
correlated with the relative occurrence of RIs and CEs and the
use of ID or ED for splice junction recognition
[16,18,20,23,24]. However, previous results have been limited in their phylogenetic scope.
In this paper, we report a comprehensive survey of splice variants in 42 eukaryotic organisms. Our survey covers a wide
phylogenetic range, including 13 multicellular animals, 6
plants, 14 fungi, and 9 protists. We observe variation across
major phylogenetic groups in the representation of RIs and
CEs among splice variants that is consistent with variation in
the mode of splice site recognition (ID or ED) used by these
groups. We infer that groups with a high ratio of RIs to CEs
(fungi and protists) operate predominantly by ID, while
groups with a low ratio of RIs to CEs (multicellular animals)
operate predominantly by ED. In organisms with evidence of
both RIs and CEs (thus, employing both ID and ED), CEs are
shorter than constitutive exons (exons that show no evidence
of splice variation), and RIs are shorter than constitutive
introns, suggesting that splice mechanisms are closely tied to
gene structure.

Results

To assess splice variation in eukaryotes, we selected 42 organisms with genome assemblies and large numbers of publicly
available expressed sequence tags (ESTs; Table 1), spanning
the plants, fungi, protists and multicellular animals. We
aligned ESTs to genome assemblies and constructed transcript fragments, examined all loci where the EST data indicated two or more overlapping non-compatible transcripts,
and labeled every instance of splice variation. Table 2 shows
the numbers of ESTs for each organism, as well as the numbers of transcripts and loci constructed. Table 3 lists the splice
variants we found. A complete list of the locations of predicted sites of splice variation, as well as control introns and
exons that show no splice variation despite high EST coverage, is available on the Broad Institute's ftp site [25].

All eukaryotes exhibit splice variation
We found that splice variation is present in all organisms we
analyzed. Every eukaryote we studied exhibited RIs, and
almost every organism exhibited competing 5' splice sites,
competing 3' splice sites, and CEs. Several organisms showed

Figure 1
Effects of splicing errors under the intron definition (ID) and exon definition (ED) models
Effects of splicing errors under the intron definition (ID) and exon definition (ED) models. Arrowheads connected by horizontal bars illustrate the paired
recognition of splice sites. (a) When splice sites are recognized in pairs across introns by ID, an error at a single splice site (marked 'x') prevents the
removal of an intron, leading to a RI. Under ID, two adjacent splice sites must be mis-spliced, and the splicing machinery must operate over a greater
distance, to generate a CE. (b) In the ED model, splice sites are recognized in pairs across exons. An error at a single splice site results in a CE. Obtaining
an RI via ED requires coordinated mis-recognition of two adjacent splice sites over a longer distance. Observed RIs can be parsimoniously explained by IDmediated splicing, while observed CEs likely indicate splicing via ED.

zero or very few CEs or competing splice sites due to having
only a small EST library or a small overall number of predicted splice variants (for example, Histoplasma capsulatum, Rhizopus oryzae, Entamoeba histolytica), or a small
number of introns (for example, S. cerevisiae). We also found
no CEs in Paramecium tetraurelia, despite a large EST
library and numerous predicted splice variants. However, P.
tetraurelia is unusual in that it has extraordinarily short
introns (25 bp on average). As CEs are usually associated with
longer introns and shorter exons, it is possible that this
organism's gene structure renders CEs impossible.
Figure 2 illustrates the relative proportions of the four different kinds of splice variants in each organism, along with previously published data for human for comparison [8]. Our
results for Caenorhabditis elegans, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, and O. sativa confirmed those of previous studies
[10,12,13].
The ratio of competing 3' splice sites to competing 5' splice
sites was fairly constant, with more competing 3' splice sites
than competing 5' splice sites in almost every case (Table 3).
This is consistent with results of previous studies of splice
variation, including the nine organisms in the Altextron database [10] and several other organisms [8,9,12]. When we

combine the data from all the organisms in our analysis, there
are 1.7 times more competing 3' splice sites than competing 5'
splice sites. Interestingly, Zavolan et al. [26] found that competing 3' splice sites are more likely to preserve the reading
frame than competing 5' splice sites.
In contrast to the uniform ratio of competing splice sites, the
ratio of CEs to RIs varies widely between organisms. We
found the ratio

CE
RI + CE

(which we will refer to as the CE frac-

tion) to be a useful metric for summarizing the pattern of
these splice variants. The CE fraction is listed in Table 3 and
illustrated in Figure 2 for each organism.

CE and RI prevalence vary by kingdom and by intron
length
Major eukaryotic groups (animals, plants, fungi, and protists)
exhibit very divergent CE fractions (Figure 2). We found that
RIs are the dominant form of splice variation in fungi and
most protists, while CEs are the dominant form in multicellular animals. Plants have intermediate proportions of CEs and
RIs. The difference in the proportions of RIs and CEs between
the group of animals and the group consisting of all fungi and
protists is highly statistically significant (p < 1e-10 by Fisher's
exact test).

The 13 multicellular animals in our analysis have 1.3 times
more CEs than RIs, which corresponds to an overall average
CE fraction of 55%. CE fractions for these organisms range
from 28% for the flatworm Schistosoma mansoni to 95% for
the chordate Branchiostoma floridae. The four insects we

studied have an average CE fraction of 44%. Moreover, variation in the CE fraction within chordates appears to be associated with genome size, serving as a partial control for
phylogenetic effects. Takifugu rubripes has a more compact

Frequencies of different forms of splice variation, arranged by phylogenetic group. The two bar charts show the relative frequencies of each type of splice
variation. The ratio of CEs to RIs is shown in the chart on the left, while the one on the right displays competing 5' and competing 3' splice sites. Note that
the CE/RI ratio shows wide variation among kingdoms while the ratio of competing 5' to competing 3' splice sites is remarkably consistent. A high-level
overview of the phylogenetic tree is shown on the far left, and the organisms' names are colored according to their phylogenetic grouping. To see all four

retention is consistent with previous reports on baker's yeast
and fission yeast [17,27], although our kingdom-wide sampling indicates RI predominance is not limited to the highly
derived yeasts. RIs also dominate in C. neoformans [15], a
member of a group of intron-rich fungi, indicating that RI
dominance in fungi is not coupled with intron density.
Plants in turn appear intermediate between animals and
fungi in their relative amounts of CEs and RIs. We examined
four multicellular plants: A. thaliana, O. sativa (rice), Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood), and Physcomitrella patens (a
moss), as well as two unicellular green algae
(Chlamydomonas. reinhardtii and Ostreococcus lucimari-

nus). Overall, we found 3.1 times more RIs than CEs, with an
average CE fraction of 24%, consistent with previous studies
in A. thaliana and O. sativa [11-13]. The unicellular algae C.
reinhardtii has a CE fraction of 22%, which is closer to the
values seen in multicellular plants than other unicellular
organisms. However, it has a large genome size for a unicellular organism (118 Mb). In contrast, O. lucimarinus is a much
simpler unicellular green algae with smaller genome size (13
Mb), minimal cellular organization and no CEs, a genome
structure that is more like those of unicellular fungi and
protists.

constitutive introns (Figure 5). In general, CEs and RIs both
tend to be shorter than their constitutively spliced counterparts, with the length difference most noticeable in organisms
in which each splice variant was uncommon.

Most splice variants are not functional
We next sought to determine the degree to which the
observed splice variants reflect programmed alternative
splicing versus incomplete splicing or splicing errors. To do
so, we examined the impact of observed splice variants on the
corresponding open reading frame and resultant protein. We
also examined conservation within regions containing splice
variants to look for signatures of coding selection.

Relationship between long introns and CE fraction
Relationship between long introns and CE fraction. The percentage of long
introns (greater than 200 bp) is correlated with the CE fraction
(

CE
). The best-fit line is y = 0.84x + 0.00 (R2 = 0.73). In each of four
RI + CE

major eukaryotic groups (animals, fungi, plants and protists), species with
more long introns display a higher propensity toward CEs.

The observed variation in CE fraction closely parallels variation in intron length. Animals and plants have more long
introns (introns greater than 200 bp) than do protists and
fungi (Table 4). In Figure 3 we plot the fraction of constitutive
introns greater than 200 bp versus the CE fraction, and demonstrate a direct correlation between the presence of long
introns and high incidence of CEs (y = 0.84x + 0.00; R2 =
0.73). This correlation also holds within each kingdom (fungi,
protists, plants, and animals), providing a phylogenetic control. As discussed below, this correlation is consistent with the
hypothesis that splice site recognition differs within these
groups.

Variably spliced regions exhibit size constraints
As shown in Table 4, variably spliced introns and exons are
usually shorter than those in our data set that display no
splice variation, in agreement with previous observations
[28]. Moreover, these length differences between constitutive
and variably spliced introns and exons appear to be associated with the relative frequencies of splice variation via CEs
and RIs. In organisms where CEs are rare, such as fungi, CEs
tend to be noticeably shorter than internal constitutive exons.
However, in organisms with substantial fractions of CEs (animals and multicellular plants) we observe no significant
length difference between CEs and internal constitutive exons
(Figure 4). Intron retention displays the opposite behavior. In
organisms where RIs are uncommon (animals and multicellular plants), RIs tend to be shorter than constitutive introns,
while organisms with large numbers of RIs (fungi and pro-

Previous analyses of splice variants in mammals have focused
on the more prevalent CEs. One surprising result from these
analyses is the high frequency of CEs that alter reading frame
or introduce stop codons [29]. Overall, approximately half of
human CEs in coding regions result in frameshifts, while an
additional 15% of CEs that do not cause frameshifts introduce
in-frame stop codons [29]. A more recent analysis of splice
variants generated by the ENCODE consortium [30] revealed
little evidence that alternative splice variants commonly give
rise to functional isoforms. In the case of frameshifts, if both
alternative open reading frames lead to functional proteins,
one would expect the polymorphism or divergence level in all
three codon positions to be the same [30]. Few splice variants
in the ENCODE analysis displayed this property [30]. Our
data are consistent with previous results. When looking at all
42 organisms in our analysis summed together (for a total of
7,115 CEs), CEs are more likely to have lengths that are a multiple of three (45% in all species examined), but over half of all
CEs have lengths that leave remainders of one (28%) or two
(27%) when divided by three.
Less has been reported about the functional impact of RIs. In
humans, many RIs have been shown to be not merely partially spliced transcripts or splicing errors [31]. They were
shown to have evidence of coding potential (having higher GC
content than other introns, having codon usage more like
exons, and having a lower frequency of stop codons). Many
human RIs participate in coding for a protein domain (a
smaller fraction than for exons, but a greater fraction than for
constitutive introns) [31]. However, not all RIs in higher
eukaryotes are necessarily functional. In plants, many RIs
were shown to introduce premature termination codons or
frameshifts [12].
The prevalence of RIs in all organisms we analyzed provides
an opportunity to assess the possibility of a functional role for
these observed events. Our analysis reveals that RIs do not
display a preference for preserving reading frames: the
lengths of all 11,925 observed RIs were roughly equally distributed between intron lengths evenly divisible by three
(34%), and intron lengths with remainders of one (34%) and

Figure lengths of CEs compared to average lengths of internal constitutive exons
Average4
Average lengths of CEs compared to average lengths of internal constitutive exons. Species are sorted by the fractional difference between these two
lengths. In organisms where CEs are common (animals and plants) CEs are almost identical in length to constitutive exons, while in species where CEs are
rare (fungi and protists) CEs tend to be significantly shorter than constitutive exons. In animals and plants, where ED is common, CEs are spliced by the
same process as constitutive exons and these two groups are thus subject to the same length constraints. In organisms that splice primarily by ID, including
fungi and protists, the lengths of constitutive exons are not constrained by ED. However, CEs in these organisms are still recognized by ED. Thus, in these
species, constitutive exons can grow longer than CEs.

showed weak but significant evidence of conservation at the
amino acid level (p < 0.001 for C. neoformans and p = 0.05
for C. immitis; Table 5). We also observe significantly fewer
in-frame stop codons within RIs than in constitutive introns,
with 23% fewer (p < 0.0001) in C. immitis, and 20% fewer (p
= 0.02) in C. neoformans (Table 5). We observe no significant
functional group over-representation (Table S3 in Additional
data file 4).

suggest that the majority of observed splice variants are
unlikely to give rise to functional proteins. It has been proposed that splice variants leading to frameshifts or truncated
proteins may be due in part to artifacts associated with EST
library construction or sequencing. However, the universality
of such disrupting variants across the many independent data
sets and kingdoms analyzed here - and the occurrence of such
disruptions associated with both RIs and CEs - suggest that
these events occur naturally and frequently. In humans,
plants, and fungi, transcripts containing premature stop
codons are targeted for degradation through the process of
nonsense mediated decay [32,33]. The widespread
occurrence of premature stop codons in human splice variants has led to the hypothesis that unproductive splicing and
translation may be pervasive [34]. Our results are consistent
with this hypothesis.

Retained introns are associated with weak splice sites
We thus see some evidence for coding potential in RIs, but
taken together with previous observations of CEs, our results

Studies in mammals have demonstrated that splice sites adjacent to CEs and RIs are associated with weak splice site sig-

Figure lengths of RIs compared with lengths of constitutive introns and introns adjacent to CEs
Average5
Average lengths of RIs compared with lengths of constitutive introns and introns adjacent to CEs. RI length, which is constrained by ID, is fairly constant
across all organisms. In protists and fungi, average RI length is close to that of constitutive introns, because ID is the primary mode of splice site
recognition for both groups. In animals, constitutive intron length differs substantially from RI length because most constitutive introns are recognized by
ED and are not subject to the same length constraints as RIs, which are recognized by ID. Plants fall between unicellular organisms and animals. Data are
shown only for organisms with at least five RIs. For introns next to CEs, data are shown only for organisms with at least eight CEs with unambiguous
adjacent intron lengths on both sides. Introns next to CEs are usually longer than constitutive introns, because these introns are recognized by ED and are
free from ID length constraints.

nals [28,35-40]. We evaluated RI information content in
plants, fungi and protists and report results in agreement
with previous studies.
We quantified 3' and 5' splice site strength by calculating the
information content of the splice sites (see Materials and
methods; Additional data file 2; Table S1 in Additional data
file 4). We found significantly lower information content on

either side of retained introns than constitutive introns for all
40 organisms in our analysis (P values 3.2e-9 and 2.1e-11,
respectively, calculated from t-test). Overall, RI 5' splice sites
had 1.9 ± 1.4 bits (24%) less information content, while their
3' splice sites had 0.9 ± 0.8 bits (17%) less (see data in Table
S1 in Additional data file 4 and sequence logos [41] in Additional data file 2.) We observed the largest differences
between RIs and constitutive introns in animals. The average

differences in information content for 5' and 3' splice sites
were, respectively, 2.3 and 1.0 bits for animals, 2.1 and 0.9
bits for fungi, 1.6 and 0.8 bits for protists, and 1.4 and 0.6 bits
for plants.
While weak splice sites, such as those we observe in our RIs,
have been associated with functional RIs and CEs [28,35-40],
they are also expected to lead to greater occurrence of
incomplete splicing [18]. Therefore, weaker splice sites are
uninformative as to whether these RIs are functional or
merely incomplete splicing.

Discussion
Splice variation reveals mechanisms of splice site
recognition
The variation we observe in the CE fraction, the correspondence of this variation with average intron length, and the size
constraints observed in both RIs and CEs can be
parsimoniously explained by proposing differences in the
proportion of splice junctions each organism recognizes via
ED and ID. Organisms with a high CE fraction presumably
splice predominantly via ED, whereas organisms with a low
fraction presumably have a preference for ID-mediated splicing. Our results suggest that the fraction of introns recognized
by ID and ED vary extensively across kingdoms, yet both
mechanisms play a role in splicing in all phylogenetic groups.
In animals, exons are short relative to introns (Table 4) and
CEs are more common than RIs (Table 3). This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that splice junctions in animals
are primarily recognized through ED, as has been previously
demonstrated in vertebrates [19]. Moreover, the predominance of ED in these species predicts that CEs should be
approximately as long as constitutive exons, because they are
spliced the same way and, thus, are subject to the same length
constraints. This is precisely the behavior we observe (Figure
4).
In fungi and protists, conversely, introns are short relative to
exons (Table 4) and RIs far outnumber CEs. We propose that
these groups primarily recognize splice junctions using ID
(Figure 5). Because the splicing machinery in these organisms
recognizes RIs in the same way it recognizes constitutive
introns, we expect both types of intron should be subject to
the same length constraints. Supporting this hypothesis, Figure 5 shows that constitutive introns in these species are similar in length to RIs. Intron definition has been demonstrated
experimentally in the yeasts Saccharomyces and Schizosaccharomyces [17,27], and in plants [42]. Our analysis extends
this result to all ascomycetes, as well as basidiomycetes and
zygomycetes, and suggests that ID is not simply a characteristic of the derived yeasts. Furthermore, due to their high
prevalence of RIs, we predict that ID predominates in the
basidiomycete C. neoformans, which possesses 5.4 introns
per gene on average, as well as the protozoan Tetrahymena

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R50

McGuire et al. R50.12

thermophila, which has 3.3 introns per gene. ID is not associated with low intron density per se.
In plants, intron lengths vary widely, and individual species
show substantial numbers of introns both greater and less
than 200 bp in length (Table 4). Correspondingly, we observe
that RIs and CEs both occur in sizeable quantities in this
group. We thus propose that ID and ED both play significant
roles in splice site recognition in plants.
While ED is most common in animals and ID dominates in
fungi and protists, nearly all species analyzed show evidence
for using both mechanisms. ID and ED have previously been
shown to operate within the same species and indeed within
the same gene [21]. We thus propose that the intron and exon
length distributions in any organism are each sums of two
distributions: one made up of shorter introns recognized by
ID and the longer exons that surround them, and one made
up of shorter exons recognized by ED and the surrounding
longer introns. When we examine the lengths of CEs, we sample from only one of these two distributions: the subset of
exons recognized by ED. When we examine the lengths of RIs,
we sample from the length distribution of introns recognized
by ID. Both these distributions are biased to be short, and this
length bias is particularly noticeable in organisms where
these splice variants are rare. Finally, when we look at the
lengths of introns surrounding CEs, we are primarily sampling from the distribution of introns associated with ED.
This last distribution tends to be long (Additional data file 3),
as is the length distribution of exons surrounding RIs, which
are associated with ID. (See Additional data file 3 for more
detail on intron and exon length distributions in CEs and
RIs.)
Importantly, our model of varying levels of ID or ED splicesite recognition explains the variation we see in CE fraction,
whether or not individual variants lead to functional messages. As shown in Figure 1a, ID mis-recognition of a single
splice site should lead to intron retention, as has been demonstrated by splice site mutation experiments in Drosophila and
Schizosaccharomyces [17,18]. Creating a CE via ID, however,
would theoretically require coordinated mis-recognition of
two splice sites and pairing of splice sites over a greater distance. If this distance were greater than 200 bp, pairing with
ID would be considerably hindered [24]. Similarly, as experimentally demonstrated and shown in Figure 1b, ED mis-recognition of a single splice site leads to a CE [19]. The
hypothetical generation of RIs under ED would require multiple mis-recognitions and pairing of splice sites belonging to
two possibly distant exons.
Thus, if many non-functional splice variants arise as a consequence of incorrect or incomplete splice site recognition, we
would nonetheless expect that splice sites recognized by ID
would more commonly give rise to RIs while those recognized
by ED would more commonly give rise to CEs. Non-func-

tional splice variants, therefore, are as informative as functional ones when considering the question of how splice sites
are recognized. This is fortunate, as it is unclear at present
what proportion of observed splice variation is indeed functionally significant. Splice variants and their characteristics,
then, provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of
splice site recognition, irrespective of whether such variants
are functional or biological errors.

Evolutionary implications of splice variation
The varying prevalence of CEs and RIs across major eukaryotic groups raises evolutionary questions about modern variation in splice recognition among lineages, as well as the
nature of splice site recognition in the last common
eukaryotic ancestor. As RIs and CEs are exhibited in almost
every organism we studied, it is likely that almost all extant
eukaryotes are capable of recognizing splice sites via both ID
and ED. The last common eukaryotic ancestor, then, may also
have been capable of both types of splice site recognition.
Indeed, Collins and Penny [43] report that most of the key
components of the spliceosome were present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor. If the minimal mechanistic requirements to support both ID and ED were present in the last
common eukaryotic ancestor, which was more prevalent: ID
or ED? In our analysis, we note that intron density has less
effect on the types of observed splice variation than does
intron length. For example, the fungus C. neoformans recognizes splice sites almost exclusively by ID, despite having
more introns per gene than many plants where ED is prevalent. Thus, whether the last common eukaryotic ancestor recognized splice sites predominantly via ID or ED is probably
not a question of how many introns it had but rather how long
its introns were. As very long introns appear to be a derived
feature associated with multicellularity, we may speculate
that the last eukaryotic common ancestor had introns similar
in size to most protists, and, therefore, probably employed ID
more than ED.
Evidence pertaining to the evolutionary origin of introns also
suggests a prevalence of ID in early eukaryotes. Similarities in
the splicing mechanism between self-splicing group II introns
in prokaryotes and spliceosomal eukaryotic introns suggest
that the former may have begat the latter [44-48]. As group II
introns are mobile genetic elements that spread through retrotransposition, the ancestors of spliceosomal introns were
probably self-contained in terms of their signals for excision,
and would not likely have relied on splicing factors embedded
in flanking coding sequence (as may be required for ED [49]).
Therefore, the earliest spliceosomal introns may have
employed a method of splice site recognition most similar to
ID.
Recent molecular evidence suggests that SR (serine-argininerich) proteins may be associated with the ascendance of ED in
animals and plants [50]. SR proteins bind to RNA sequences
and assist in spliceosome assembly for both constitutively

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R50

McGuire et al. R50.13

and alternatively spliced introns. They have been shown to
enhance the splicing efficiency of introns with suboptimal
splice signals in S. pombe [51]. Additionally, Shen and Green
[52] have recently shown that SR proteins can rescue splicing
of introns with suboptimal splice signals if those proteins are
directed to bind to exonic mRNA sequence in S. cerevisiae, a
species that has lost all native SR proteins. If the experimental
binding of SR proteins to pre-mRNA sequences is indicative
of the binding of SR proteins to exonic splicing enhancers in
organisms where ED is prevalent, the fundamental splicing
machinery of ID and ED may be closely related. Along these
lines, Ram and Ast [50] speculate that the primary role of SR
proteins has changed over time. In early eukaryotes, SR proteins assist in the recognition of suboptimal ID introns, while
in higher eukaryotes, they bind to exonic splicing enhancers.
This role change shifts the placement of the basal splicing
machinery across exons instead of across introns and enables
ED using the same spliceosomal machinery employed for ID
[50].
The SR protein family has expanded in multicellular eukaryotic lineages [53], and this proliferation may have facilitated
the widespread conversion of introns in those lineages from
ID to ED. However, it is unclear what underlying neutral or
selective forces could be responsible for this shift. Changes in
genome size may have played a role. Multicellular eukaryotes
generally exhibit larger genomes than unicellular eukaryotes,
and organisms with large genomes tend to have long introns
[54,55]. Because ID is only effective for introns less than
approximately 250 bp [24], an upward trend in genome size
in multicellular lineages (resulting from a reduced deletion
rate, increased transposon activity, or both) could have
favored ED introns that were spliceable in the face of this
mutational pressure.
Regardless of which evolutionary forces are responsible for
their ascendance, CEs produced through exon definition in
multicellular eukaryotes allow for much greater flexibility
and combinatorial complexity of alternatively spliced transcripts than would RIs recognized by ID. For example, the
large number of transcripts (>30,000) that can be produced
by the Dscam gene in D. melanogaster is facilitated by
independent splicing of CEs [56]. The abundance of CEs enabled by ED in the human proteome may help to explain why
the human genome contains only about as many genes as that
of the worm or fly, despite the (admittedly biased) perception
of our own much greater organismal complexity [57].

Conclusion

Using EST and cDNA data from 42 organisms, we find the
prevalence of RIs and CEs to vary significantly across major
eukaryotic groups, strongly suggesting that the underlying
mode of splice site recognition (ID versus ED) also varies in
prevalence across eukaryotes. Our results show that RIs,
which are present in every organism we analyzed, are more

Genome Biology 2008,

widespread than previously thought. We also find a strong
relationship between intron length and the prevalence of
splice variation: the fraction of introns greater than 200 bp is
correlated with the CE fraction. Shorter introns (<200 bp),
such as those found in fungi and protists, are more likely to be
recognized by ID. In all 23 fungi and protists that we examined, we observed that RIs are more common than CEs. In
contrast, shorter exons surrounded by longer introns (>200250 bp), such as those found in animals, are more likely to be
recognized by ED. In the 13 multicellular animals in our analysis, CEs occur much more frequently, sometimes in greater
numbers than RIs. The six plants in our analysis exhibited
intermediate intron lengths, having more CEs than fungi and
more RIs than animals.
We conclude that ID and ED are likely both present to some
degree in all eukaryotes. We conclude that splicing proceeds
primarily by ID in fungi and unicellular protists, due to the
overwhelming majority of RIs and paucity of CEs observed in
these organisms, as well as their short intron lengths and
longer exon lengths. In contrast, splice sites in multicellular
animals are recognized primarily via ED, due to the larger
numbers of CEs observed, as well as these species' longer
introns and shorter exons. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the two different forms of recognition (ED
and ID) are still unclear.
These findings help to reveal the complex interplay of selective constraints and mutational pressures underlying eukaryotic genome architecture, and improve our understanding of
why eukaryotic genomes exhibit so much variation. Further
sequencing of additional organisms, especially those that
exhibit both unicellular and multicellular properties, will help
to disentangle the effects of multicellularity, genome size, and
intron length on the mechanisms of splice site recognition.

Materials and methods
EST alignments
All EST and assembly data were publicly available and downloaded from the Broad Institute [58], GenBank, J Craig Venter Institute/The Institute for Genomic Research [59], Joint
Genome Institute [60] or VectorBase [61] (Tables 1 and 2).
We used BLAT [62] version 33 to align the ESTs to genomic
sequence using the following parameters: --minIdentity = 95
--minScore = 50 --queryType = rna. We set the --maxIntron
parameter to the longest annotated intron in each species.
We filtered the resulting alignments using the following criteria: each alignment must contain at least one canonical splice
site (GT:AG, CG:AG, AT:AC); must have no non-canonical
splice sites; must have ≥ 95% nucleotide identity; must not
have more than nine consecutive insertions; and must not
have more than nine consecutive deletions outside of an
intron. We also required three or more exact matches at every
intron-exon boundary [12]. If a single EST aligned to more

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R50

McGuire et al. R50.14

than one location on the genome, we only considered the
alignment with the highest score. To guard against redundant
input data, if multiple alignments in the same locus had the
same sequence after trimming, we disregarded all but one of
them.
We discarded all unspliced alignments to prevent labeling
pre-spliced transcripts as splice variants. Unspliced ESTs
show no evidence of having been processed by the spliceosome, and may represent pre-spliced transcript fragments. It
is difficult to distinguish between an unspliced EST that has
been processed and an unspliced EST that has not, and thus
we cannot report how many processed ESTs we discarded.
However, if most unspliced ESTs have already been processed by the spliceosome, we would expect to find more of
them in organisms with very few introns and/or very long
exons. We found no such correlation in either case (Additional data file 5). We conclude that a substantial fraction of
the unspliced ESTs represent pre-spliced ESTs, and, therefore, that unspliced ESTs are not a reliable indicator of splice
variation.
The number of RIs changed substantially depending on
whether we included or excluded unspliced ESTs, while the
numbers of CEs and competing 3' and 5' splice sites changed
very little. We believe that previous reports that do not
exclude unspliced ESTs overestimate the frequency of intron
retention.
After aligning the ESTs and filtering them, we built transcripts and transcript fragments using CallReferenceGenes,
an unpublished tool used in the Broad Institute's genome
annotation pipeline since 2005. Several previous papers provide an in-depth discussion of the problem [12,63]. We briefly
sketch our algorithm here. The source code for CallReferenceGenes, as well as the code that labels alternative splice forms,
is included in Additional data file 6.
First, we partition the alignments into clusters, so that every
alignment has exon-exon overlap with at least one other
alignment in the cluster, and no alignment has exon-exon
overlap with any alignment outside its cluster. Alignments
that overlap no other alignments are ignored.
Next, for each cluster, we compare every alignment to every
other alignment that overlaps it. (Here, as opposed to the previous step, we also consider exon-intron overlaps.) Relationships are directional, and are given one of three labels:
'conflicts', 'extended-by', or 'includes'. Two alignments conflict if any base in the region of overlap is exonic in one alignment and intronic in the other. If they do not conflict, one
alignment extends another if it ends after the other and does
not begin before it. Lastly, one alignment includes another if
it does not conflict with it, starts before it, and ends after it.

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R50

McGuire et al. R50.15

At this stage the cluster is represented by a graph of nodes
(representing alignments) and labeled edges (representing
their relationships). To turn this into a more tree-like representation that is easier to traverse, we build an ordered list of
alignments. We sort them by 3' coordinate, in ascending
order. In the case where we have two alignments with identical 3' coordinates, we sort by 5' coordinate, again in ascending
order. In this way, no alignment is extended by any element
that sorts before it. An alignment usually, though not always,
sorts after the alignments it includes.

Given two overlapping transcripts A and B, all bases in the
region of overlap will be in one of four states: I, A and B are
exonic; II, A is exonic; III, B is exonic; IV, neither is exonic.
We group all adjacent states into a column with a single label,
then use a sliding-window approach, across three such columns, to compare overlapping transcripts. CEs, RIs, and
competing 5' and 3' splice sites all have a different signature
appearance. CEs appear as IV:II:IV and IV:III:IV; RIs appear
as I:II:I and I:III:I; competing 5' and 3' splice sites appear as
I:II:IV, I:III:IV, IV:II:I, and IV:III:I.

To improve performance, we prune redundant relationships
from the graph. We apply a series of heuristics to reduce the
number of paths from an alignment to its descendants. These
'trimming rules' include: first, if A is extended by B, and C
extends both A and B, and there is no element D such that B
conflicts with D and C does not, then any path containing A
and B will also contain C. The extended-by relationship from
A to C is therefore redundant. Second, if A is included by B,
and there is no element D such that B conflicts with D and A
does not, then any path containing A will also include B. All
extended-by relationships terminating in A are redundant.
Third, if A is extended by B and both are included by C, and
every element D that conflicts with C also conflicts with either
A or B, then any path containing both A and B will also contain C. Thus, the extended-by relationship from A to B is
redundant.

We filter the set of splice variants by requiring that every base
in the variant region be exonic in at least one alignment and
intronic in at least one alignment. Because EST data are fragmentary we cannot be sure that initial or terminal exons are
complete. To ensure accurate labeling as well as reliable
length statistics, we require that any exon in the alternatively
spliced region not be an initial or terminal exon. Finally, we
require that every alignment spanning the region conform to
either the major or minor variant. The reported length of each
splice variant is simply the width of the center column in the
windows described above.

We traverse the list bottom-up so that every element is
pruned before any element it extends. There will be multiple
paths from a parent to a given child if a splice variation lies
between them. If no splice variation occurs between them,
generally, there will be one path, but the above rules are not
exhaustive and some duplicate paths may remain after pruning. As we traverse the list and prune it, we track, per alignment, all alignments that can be reached through it (for
example, all its extenders and includees, as well as their
extenders and includees, and so on). We call these sets of
alignments the 'descendants' of each alignment. (Note that
pruning never reduces the membership of these sets, only the
number of edges between them.)
After ordering and pruning, we can traverse the list of alignments left-to-right, following 'extended-by' and 'includes'
links to build paths linking splice-compatible alignments. To
do this, we do the following. First, find starts - a start is any
element that extends no other element and has at least one
descendant that cannot be reached through any previously
discovered start. Second, walk the tree - treating each start, in
turn, as a root of a subtree, traverse extension and inclusion
links as edges in a graph; each unique path represents (a fragment of) a transcript. Third, remove sub-paths - if all the
alignments in one path are present in another, we discard the
one containing fewer alignments. Fourth, overlapping paths
with distinct alignments represent splice variants of the same
gene.

We also generated a list of constitutive introns and exons as a
control. These are introns and exons predicted from loci
where no ESTs conflict. Furthermore, every base within these
constitutive elements must have ten or more ESTs supporting
it. Note that there is no way to tell for sure that any exon or
intron never exhibits splice variation; this method simply
identifies loci where splice variation has never been seen, and
if present, is presumably rare.

Testing retained introns for evidence of selection at the
codon level
We used a comparative approach to test retained introns for
purifying selection at the codon level using two groups of
fungi, where genome sequences at suitable evolutionary distances were available. We examined all four sequenced serotypes of C. neoformans (JEC21, H99, R265 and WM276) in
one group, while the second group consisted of C. immitis and
the C735 strain of Coccidioides posadasii. Orthology of genes
was determined using a reciprocal-best-BLAST criterion,
while the alignment of orthologs was performed using ClustalW [64]. Alignments of retained orthologous introns were
concatenated to enhance power for detecting selection. Prior
to concatenation, splice donor and acceptor sites were
removed, and the 5' and 3' ends of each intron alignment were
padded with gaps in order to preserve the native reading
frames of introns. We used a 100 bp cutoff for retained
introns in C. neoformans and 150 bp in C. immitis. Since 95%
of the introns we identified in each organism were less than
these cutoffs, we used a cutoff to eliminate unusually long
introns. We analyzed 477 and 389 orthologous intron alignments in C. neoformans and C. immitis, respectively. The
dN/dS ratio of concatenated intron alignments was calculated using the codeml program (model M0) in the PAML 3.15

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R50

software package [65]. The probability that the resulting dN/
dS ratios were significantly less than one, indicating purifying
selection at the codon level, was calculated using a bootstrapping approach with a set of control introns. We identified 672
and 662 control introns in C. neoformans and C. immitis,
respectively. We randomly resampled, with replacement,
from the control introns to create 1,000 concatenated control
alignments approximately equal in length to the concatenated retained intron alignments in each taxonomic group.
Then, we used codeml to calculate the dN/dS ratio exhibited
by each resampled control alignment to determine the probability of observing dN/dS ratios as low as or lower than those
exhibited by the retained introns in each taxonomic group,
under a null hypothesis that they are non-coding.

produced by the Broad Institute (Christina Cuomo) as part of a grant with
Christina Cuomo, Marty Dickman, Jeffrey Rollins, and Linda Kohn. S. sclerotiorum EST libraries were constructed by Jeffrey Rollins, Dave Edwards,
Adrienne Sexton, and Barbara Howlett. The sequence data for D. rerio were
produced by the D. rerio Sequencing Group at the Sanger Institute. We
would like to thank Michael Koehrsen and his engineering team for their
development of the Calhoun bioinformatics platform, without which this
large-scale analysis would have been impossible. We would also like to
thank the anonymous reviewers, who made many helpful suggestions to
improve this paper. This research was funded by an NSF grant for Comparative Fungal Genomics (MCB-0450812), and an NIAID Contract for Microbial Genome Centers (HHSN26620040001C).

Additional data files

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper. Additional data file 1 is a figure showing
the frequencies of different forms of splice variation. Additional file 2 is a figure showing sequence logos for splice sites
for both RIs and controls. Additional data file 3 shows intron
and exon length distributions for six example organisms.
Additional data file 4 contains supplementary tables detailing
the differences in information content between RIs and controls (Table S1), intron and exon lengths from annotations
(Table S2), and details of our analysis of functional group
enrichment of RIs (Table S3). Additional data file 5 is a
spreadsheet containing a comparison of alternative splicing
events for the situations where unspliced ESTs are included
as well as discarded. This spreadsheet also includes data for a
higher-confidence dataset requiring a greater number of
ESTs supporting each predicted alternative splicing event.
Additional data file 6 contains computer source codes for the
CallReferenceGenes program, as well as the code that labels
alternative splice forms. These codes can be inspected but will
not be functional without the rest of the Broad Institute's Calhoun environment.
