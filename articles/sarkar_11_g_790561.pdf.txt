Abstract
Background: Guanine protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a eukaryotic transmembrane protein family
and function as “molecular switches” in the second messenger cascades and are found in all organisms between
yeast and humans. They form the single, biggest drug-target family due to their versatility of action and their role
in several physiological functions, being active players in detecting the presence of light, a variety of smells and
tastes, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, chemicals etc. in the environment of the cell. Comparative genomic studies
on model organisms provide information on target receptors in humans and their function. The Japanese teleost
Fugu has been identified as one of the smallest vertebrate genomes and a compact model to study the human
genome, owing to the great similarity in its gene repertoire with that of human and other vertebrates. Thus the
characterization of the GPCRs of Fugu would provide insights to the evolution of the vertebrate genome.
Results: We classified the GPCRs in the Fugu genome and our analysis of its 316 membrane-bound receptors,
available on the public databases as well as from literature, detected 298 GPCRs that were grouped into five main
families according to the GRAFS classification system (namely, Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled and
Secretin). We also identified 18 other GPCRs that could not be grouped under the GRAFS family and hence were
classified as ‘Other 7TM’ receptors. On comparison of the GPCR information from the Fugu genome with those in
the human and chicken genomes, we detected 96.83% (306/316) and 96.51% (305/316) orthology in GPCRs among
the Fugu-human genomes and Fugu-chicken genomes, respectively.
Conclusions: This study reveals the position of pisces in vertebrate evolution from the GPCR perspective. Fugu can
act as a reference model for the human genome for other protein families as well, going by the high orthology
observed for GPCRs between Fugu and human. The evolutionary comparison of GPCR sequences between key
vertebrate classes of mammals, birds and fish will help in identifying key functional residues and motifs so as to fill
in the blanks in the evolution of GPCRs in vertebrates.

Background
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute one of
the largest and most ancient super-families of integral
trans-membrane receptor proteins that act as cellular
receptors and play a central role in the signal transduction
in eukaryotes [1-4]. They are perhaps the most versatile of
all the known proteins in the human genome [5] and

hence are the focus of intense pharmaceutical and academic research [6] as they form one of the prime transduction pathways through which acceptance of a signal by
a cell can principally occur, the other being tyrosine kinase
receptors [7]. Abnormalities in cell signaling by GPCRs are
the root cause of wide-spread disorders like asthma, peptic
ulcers, hypertension, type II diabetes etc. [8]. GPCRs have
triumphed throughout the course of evolution and can
probably be traced back to a time before the divergence of
plants and animals [5] and possibly even exist in protozoa,
though not characterized, yet [9]. Their importance can be

gauged from their presence as well as abundance in almost
all eukaryotic genomes [10].
The availability of complete sets of putative members
of a family from diverse species provides the basis for
cross-genome comparative studies. The Japanese pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes, having a genome that is oneeighth the size of that found in human, is among the
smallest vertebrate genomes and thus an apt reference
for annotating the human genome. Teleosts diverged
about 500 million years ago from other phyla and are
ancestors of tetrapods. Comparing the genomes of Fugu
and the green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis),
it is observed that about 75% of the duplication events
appear to have happened before the Takifugu and Tetraodon lineages separated [11]. Both these teleost species
serve as model genomes but are non-redundant since
the two, being separated by approximately 18 to
30 million years, provide an improved annotation on
both sides.
We have classified the GPCRs present in the Takifugu
rubripes genome according to the GRAFS classification
system and compared it to GPCRs present in the
human, chicken and the Tetraodon nigroviridis genomes,
which has added to the information of GPCR evolution
alongside vertebrate evolution (from data available from
the non-redundant public databases) and detected very
high orthology between Fugu-human and Fugu-chicken.
Additionally we also compared the GPCRs between the
Japanese and the green spotted pufferfish for perspective
and found that the two pufferfishes had comparable
receptors in this superfamily of proteins.

also compared the GPCRs between the two puffer fishes
to understand the pattern of evolution among teleosts
that has been characterized according to GRAFS [11].
Fugu comprises fewer GPCRs than either human and
chicken (Table 1). Also our dataset has 150 GPCRs less
than that reported in Tetraodon nigroviridis [11]. Except
for 10 Fugu receptors, all others find matches in the
human GPCRs, while all but 11 find counterparts in the
chicken GPCR sub-set. All Fugu GPCRs found orthologs
in Tetraodon nigroviridis though, unlike Fugu, most Tetraodon GPCR sequences in the public databases still did
not have a clearly defined function. We observed that
there are some unique receptors in Fugu which are not
present in humans like the pheromone receptors, while
some are conspicuous with their absence in Fugu, such
as the melanocortin3 (MC3) receptors which are found
in human. 18 Fugu receptors did not confirm to the
requirements of the GRAFS classification and hence
were grouped under the Other 7TMs. For better understanding and clarity in viewing the phylogenetic tree, we
grouped the families as Rhodopsins and Non-Rhodopsins
(Table 2). A very high orthology was detected between
the receptors of chicken and human when compared to
those in Fugu (Table 3), keeping with the attribute of
Fugu as a reference model for the human genome.
Also all Fugu GPCRs found counterparts in Tetraodon
nigroviridis (Table 2), though the orphans could not be
compared between the sub-families as this detail was not
found for Tetraodon nigroviridis.

Results and discussion
Our primary objective was to classify the GPCRs of the
Fugu (Japanese or tiger pufferfish) genome according to
the GRAFS classification system [12], that were available
with the non-redundant public databases of NCBI [13]
and UniProtKB [14] (where A-F classification system is
followed [15]) and from previously published literature
[2], as the majority of GPCRs in all eukaryotes, starting
from the nematodes in the evolutionary ladder, can be
categorized in lieu of the GRAFS system (Figure 1). We

Figure 2 describes the repertoire of the Fugu GPCRs
grouped together as the Non-Rhodopsins, which includes
Glutamate, Adhesion, Frizzled, Secretin and Other 7TM
families. In our study, we observe that out of the 58
Glutamate receptors in Fugu, all found orthologs in the
Tetraodon, human and chicken GPCRs but these did not
necessarily have the same function. At the sub-family

level, the 9 Fugu metabotropic Glutamate (GRM) and the
lone Ca2+-sensing (CASR) showed conserved function
but this was not true for the 36 V2Rs (pheromone receptors of Fugu) which are absent in human and chicken.
The V2Rs found orthologs in the CASR and GRM receptors of chicken and human. The 12 type 1 taste (TAS1)
receptors in Fugu matched with various other members
of the type 1 receptors in both human and chicken. Interestingly, the corresponding receptors were exactly the
same in human and chicken, which occurs probably due
to an evolutionary diversification at a stage later than
pisces in the course of vertebrate evolution. The presence
of TAS1 receptors in both the pufferfishes points to the
presence of chemosensory glutamate receptors prior to
the evolution of land vertebrates. Like the chicken GPCR
subset, Fugu also seems to lack the ortholog for the
GABABR (gamma aminobutyric acid-binding receptor)
though 4 such representatives were detected in Tetraodon nigroviridis. Probably, this is observed due to a different mode of function of GABA receptors in Fugu and
chicken as compared to Tetraodon nigroviridis and
human.
Adhesion (2 receptors)

The adhesion sub-family is known to have immunological functions as well as plays important roles in the
central nervous system [16]. They are unique in comprising of certain motifs, rich in glycosylation sites and
proline residues, occurring in the long (200-800 amino
acids) N-termini, that are likely-players in cell adhesion
[17,18]. This family has been referred to by many other
names due to some other unique characteristics, for
instance, it has been called EGF-TM7 to emphasise the
presence of epidermal growth factors (EGF) domains
in its N-termini, LN-TM7 receptors, due to its long

variable N-termini, as already mentioned above, and
also termed B2 due to their distant similarity with
secretin receptors [19]. Only two adhesion receptors
could be detected in Fugu from the sequence dataset
collected. Both corresponded to the Ig-hepta/GPR116
that is found in the chicken and human datasets of
GPCRs, while 29 receptors were grouped in to this
family for Tetraodon nigroviridis. No GPCRs corresponding to the BAI, CELSR, EMR, ETL, HE6 and
LEC sub-families were found for Fugu in the public
databases.
CD97 belongs to the B family of G protein-coupled
receptors (GCPRs). Subfamily B2 contains cell surface
molecules with long extracellular N-termini (LNBTM7). They are putative cell-surface signaling molecules
induced in the activated leukocytes and are highly
expressed in regions of inflammation (indicating a probable protective and destructive immune responses),
besides being expressed in smooth muscle cells and
malignant tumors [20-22]. These receptors are present
in Tetraodon and human but lack orthologs in Fugu
and chicken, and were probably lost in the lineage leading to chicken.
Frizzled/taste 2 (10 receptors)

The Frizzled/taste 2 sub-family are a comparatively
recent addition to the GPCR family, which mediate signals from the secreted glycoproteins, thus controlling
cell fate, polarity and proliferation during metazoan
development [12]. They are receptors having 200 amino
acid long N-termini with conserved cysteine residues
that are expressed in the tongue and palate epithelium
and probably act as bitter taste receptors, though their
function is not quite clear.
This sub-family is one of the most highly-conserved
among all GPCRs found in flies, fish and mammals,
indicating an evolutionary pattern far-removed from the
other GPCR families. In comparison to the 10 frizzled
receptors of Fugu, the human GPCR repertoire has 24,
while the count reaches 11 in the chicken sub-set.
Tetraodon has been reported to have 12 frizzled/
smoothened/ TAS2 GPCRs.
The taste 2 GPCRs, which seem to have arisen much
later, being conspicuously absent in flies, roundworm
(Caenorhabditis elegans) and Fugu (Takifugu rubripes),
have a considerable representation in the mouse and
human GPCR sub-sets and a sole member in zebra-fish.
In fact, this is one of the only two receptor types (the
other being vomeronasal receptors) that have arisen
after the split of tunicates from the lineage leading to
the vertebrates. This receptor-type is not well-conserved; in fact they are among those that have evolved
most rapidly in the past 100-200 million years in
mammals.

Figure 2 Phylogenetic tree of Fugu Non-Rhodopsins. The figure illustrates the members of the Glutamate, Adhesion, Frizzled, Secretin
families in Fugu calculated using the neighbor joining (NJ) method based on 1000 replicas of the dataset. The position of the Non-Rhosopsins
was established using the 112 receptors of the Fugu non-rhodopsin families. The receptors which lack sequence similarity with any other GPCR
family have been categorized as ‘Other 7TM’ and depicted in the phylogenetic tree. The members have been denoted as numerals as per the
numbering in Dataset S3.

Secretin (24 receptors)

Secretin is one of the sub-families (besides Adhesion)
that appeared on the GRAFS classification system by the
splitting of class B of the A-F system. The secretins were
found to be descendents of the adhesion family [23] and
has structural similarity with the latter in their transmembrane regions. The secretin receptors comprise of
at least six highly conserved cysteine bridges in their Ntermini and bind to large peptide ligands like hormones
and neuropeptides [24]. They are well represented in all
vertebrates as well as in tunicates, fruitfly and nematodes.
They are gastro-intestinal hormones that regulate the ion
(bicarbonate and potassium) and enzyme secretion from
the pancreas. In Fugu, the secretin sub-family comprises
of 2 calcitonin receptors (CALCR), 1 corticotropinreleasing hormone receptor (CRHR), 1 growth hormonereleasing hormone (GHRHR), 6 pituitary adeylate

cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), 6 parathyroid hormone receptors (PTHR) and 8 vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors (VIPR), bringing it to a total of 24, while in
human and chicken there are 15 and 14 of these GPCRs,
respectively. Tetraodon has 21 secretin receptors with at
least 73% sequence similarity with the Fugu secretin
receptors. The secretin and the VIPRs are thought to
share a common ancestor, with secretin receptors
appearing approximately 310 million years ago either due
to gene duplication or from a glucagon ligand.
Rhodopsins (56 olfactory, 148 non-olfactory)

The Rhodopsins constitute the largest chunk (~64.5%) of
the Fugu GPCR repertoire, comprising of 204 receptors,
keeping with the trend in numbers seen in the GPCR
repertoires of all vertebrates. Rhodopsins in the GRAFS
system correspond to the class A of the A-F classification

Sarkar et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 1):S3

system. This is the first family of GPCRs whose three
dimensional structure was determined, thus serving as
the foundation of structural studies for the understanding
of these special proteins. The rhodopsins have a structure
that is different from adhesion, frizzled, secretin and
majority of the glutamate receptors, as the rhodopsins
have short N-termini, unlike the others mentioned. The
rhodopsin binding cavity seems to be between the transmembrane regions in contrast to the other GPCR
families where the N-terminal plays the pivotal role in
ligand-binding, though the ligand-binding domain of
luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH), leucine-rich-repeat containing GPCR (LG) and
thyrotropin stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors of the
δ sub-family lie in the N-termini [12] (Figure 3).

Page 5 of 9

The Rhodopsin family is systematically categorized in to
4 groups based on experimental phylogenetic investigations: a(amine-binding receptors), b(only peptide-binding
receptors), g(receptors that bind to neuropeptides like
somatostatins, galanin, opioids and chemokines etc.) and
δ(olfactory, purine and glycoprotein receptors) [12].
a–rhodopsins (110 receptors)

The a-group includes 24 amine receptors, 14 opsins and
72 members of the MECA cluster in the Fugu GPCR
dataset. There are a total of 701 a-rhodopsins in human
while 92 of these are present in chicken and 137 in Tetraodon nigroviridis. Some a-rhodopsin sub-groups like the
melanocortin (MC) and endothelial differentiation
G-protein coupled receptors (EDGRs) are very well-

Rhodopsin family. The branches of this tree have been colored according to the four major sub-divisions in the family, namely- a, b, g and δ
receptor classes. The tree was constructed using the neighbor joining (NJ) method on the 1000 replicas of the 204 Rhodopsin receptor dataset.
The numbering of the members is mentioned in the Dataset S3.

conserved. All but 3 out of the 63 Fugu MC receptors
have one-to-one orthology with the human and chicken
sub-sets, and both the EDGR receptors found exact
matches in both human and chicken. The MC receptors
(MC4 and MC5) arose early in the evolution of vertebrates, still displaying a remarkable conservation in their
sequences, especially in the binding and activation
domains [25]. Except the MC3 receptors, which Fugu
lacks, its MC receptors have evident similarities with
those found in mammals, especially in their pharmacological characters which indicates that they bind to melanocortin peptides with high potency and respond well in
their presence, thus playing essential roles in pigmentation regulation, energy homeostasis and the production
of steroids [26-28]. Fugu also lacks both prostaglandin
and melatonin receptors of the a-subfamily but has 6
receptors each in the serotonin and dopamine subgroups,
1 muscarinic, 2 trace amines and 9 adrenergic receptors,
all displaying one-to-one orthology with the human and
chicken GPCRs. Fugu contains a total of 14 opsins: 5 rod
pigments, 6 cone visual pigments, 3 encephalopsins/
TMT (Teleost Multiple Tissue) opsins and no peropsins,
melanopsins and retinal G-protein receptors. The MECA
(MC, EDGR, Cannabinoid, ADORA/Adenosine receptor)
cluster contains the highest number (72) of receptors in
the rhodopsin family, out of which the majority (63) are
MC receptors.
b-rhodopsins (20 receptors)

Though this group has no main branches, it consists of
20 peptide-binding receptors of 17 different types.
In the Fugu GPCR repertoire, this family is constituted by
10 neuropeptide Y (NPY), 5 neuropeptide (NPFF), 2
endothelin-related receptors (EDNR), 2 arginine-vasopressin receptors (AVPR) and 1 tachykinin receptors (TACR),
but no hypocretin receptors (HCRTRs), cholecystokinin
receptors (CCKs), gastrin-releasing peptide receptors
(GRPRs), neuromedin B receptors (NMBRs), uterinbombesin receptors (BRS3), neurotensin receptors (NTSRs),
growth hormone secretagogues receptor (GHSRs), neuromedin receptors (NMURs), thyrotropin releasing hormone
receptors (TRHRs), ghrelins, gonadotropin releasing hormone receptors (GNRHRs), oxytocins or orphans. The
human and chicken GPCR sub-sets have 35 and 45 brhodopsin receptors respectively, as compared to the 20
detected in Fugu and 88 in Tetraodon nigroviridis. All of
the 10 Fugu NPY receptors show orthology with the
human and chicken NPY receptors. Fugu has representatives of Y2, Y4 (also known as pancreatic polypeptide receptors or PP-receptors), Y7, Y8 and YY receptors types in this
sub-class. The Y1, Y5, Y6 and the proposed Y3 receptors
that are found in mammalian GPCR repertoires were not
detected in the Fugu data-set. This sub-class gets its name
from the fact that all NPY receptors bind with high affinity

Page 6 of 9

to the NPY and PYY peptides (with the exception of the Y4
receptors which prefer the peptide PP for binding).
g-rhodopsins (14 receptors)

This classification contains receptors that bind to both
peptides and lipid-like compounds. The g-rhodopsins of
Fugu comprise of 14 receptors (in comparison with the
42 Tetraodon nigroviridis, 59 human and 46 chicken
receptors that are placed in this category of rhodopsins)
and are divided in to three main branches, namelySOG (somatostatin, opioid and the neuropeptide galanin
and RF-amide receptors), Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and the chemokine receptor clusters. In
Fugu, 6 SOG were detected out which 3 were classified
as Neuropeptide galanin & the RF-amide binding receptor GALR and the remaining 3 as Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs 2 and 5). Opioids, which are receptors that
are targeted for treating cough, pain and alcoholism,
were not detected in Fugu. Two MCH receptors were
detected in the Fugu GPCR repertoire, with representatives in both the MCH1 and MCH2 types, as in the case
seen in mammals, though the latter seems to have been
lost in chicken. The chemokine receptor cluster is an
interesting group in this sub-class pertaining to their
role in acute and chronic inflammation. Only one drug
(for HIV treatment) has received regulatory approval
that targets a chemokine called CCR5, which are used
as co-receptors by some HIV strains during viral entry.
In Fugu, 6 classic chemokines have been detected that
comprise interleukin 8 receptors type I and II.
δ-rhodopsins (60 receptors)

The final group of the rhodopsin sub-family is the
δ-rhodopsins that have four main branches of MASrelated, glycoprotein, purine and the olfactory receptors clusters. In the Fugu GPCR dataset, the olfactory
receptors form the major chunk of this sub-class,
including 56 out of the 60 total δ-rhodopsins, in comparison to the 75, 518 and 290 such receptors found in
Tetraodon nigroviridis, human and chicken, respectively. The remaining four receptors are representatives
of the LHCGR (1 member) and the 3 members of the
Relaxin-binding receptor sub-groups. The classic glycoprotein receptor hormones of LHCGR, FSHR and the
TSHRs are members of the glycoprotein receptor subgroup which have been targets of recombinant peptides in different GPCR studies [29].Out of the 56
olfactory receptors in Fugu, 50 belong to the Odorant
receptors, while the human genome has 388 functional
odorant receptors [30,31], 229 such representatives
are found in chicken and 23 odorant candidate receptors in the Tetraodon nigroviridis GPCR repertoire.
Other than the same10 odorant receptors of the Fugu
δ-rhodopsins, all other members were orthologous to

Sarkar et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 1):S3
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S1/S3

the human and GPCR sub-sets. In fact, these were the
only 10 receptors which did not have any human
orthologs. The orphan GPCRs in Tetraodon nigroviridis could not be compared to those in Fugu as they
were not grouped under any sub-families, unlike the
latter. The high variability in the number of odorant
genes in pisces indicates species-specific adaptation
suited to bind to important receptors important to the
specific species [11]. Six Fugu olfactory receptors could
not be classified under any sub-category and hence,
were placed under Other Olfactory Receptors.
The rapidly evolving class of olfactory GPCRs express
themselves in the olfactory epithelium, with the help of
which pisces, aves and mammals are known to detect
the chemicals in their external environment. Olfactory
receptors, on the basis of phylogenetic criteria [30,31],
can broadly be categorized as those which recognize
water-soluble odorants (Class I, which has been
detected in both teleosts, including Fugu, and mammals,
but lacking in chicken), and those that mediate airborne smells (Class II, present in chicken and mammals,
but not found in Fugu). Fishes use their olfactory system to detect pheromones for discriminating between
toxins, predators, prey and mates, foraging, detecting
nests and staying with their own school. Since majority
of fishes lead a totally aquatic life, without ever leaving
the water, they have no use for the Class II olfactory
receptors. An olfactory receptor may bind to a diverse
set of odorants and bring about activation. This may be
the reason that as compared to fishes, mammals, especially humans, have an enormous number of odorant
receptors of both the Class I and Class II types to
enable them to discriminate between a plethora of
smells. The characterization of these receptors would be
of great impact and could be capitalized upon by the
fragrance industry, though not so much as drug targets
as they are yet to be implicated in the occurrence of
any disease.
The two pufferfishes, Fugu and Tetraodon nigroviridis,
have coding regions with approximately 87% similarity
and both are considered model systems for studying
human GPCRs [32]. Fugu and Tetraodon nigroviridis are
separated by 18 to 30 million years that might add to
the differences in their gene sequences. On account of
its small size, availability and easier maintenance conditions, Tetraodon nigroviridis was the species of choice
over Fugu initially. But following the first draft of the
Fugu genome, revealing the huge similarity observed in
three-fourth of Fugu proteins with that of humans, the
comparability of their gene repertoire (as well as that of
other vertebrates) was established and Fugu was
accepted as a model system. The differences between
the two pufferfishes might be due the fact that the two
fishes differ in their natural habitat and thus have

Page 7 of 9

different environmental conditions to adapt to. But the
study of both these systems adds to the annotation of
both these species and is non-redundant.

Conclusions
The phylogenetic analysis of GPCRs in the model system of Fugu helps to establish the position of fishes in
the vertebrate evolution. The Fugu genome is one of
the smallest vertebrate genomes that lack the repetitive
sequences observed in genomes of higher organisms. It
serves as a valuable reference set for studying other
protein families in the human genome. We believe that
a thorough understanding of the similarities and
uniqueness of GPCRs among different genomes is vital
before using them as drug targets. Moreover, such evolutionary studies with representatives of key vertebrate
classes will help in identifying prime functional residues and motifs to elucidate the role of GPCRs in vertebrate evolution.
Methods
Sequence retrieval of Fugu GPCRs

Sequence database search was carried out on the Takifugu rubripes genome using ‘G Protein Coupled Receptors in Takifugu rubripes’ as the keywords. The sequence
databases were re-checked with the individual receptortypes for more sequences. The sequences were extracted
in the FASTA format using the Entrez search engine of
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
[13], and Text Search of the Universal Protein Resource
(UniProtKB) [14], which are search engines of the two
non-redundant, publicly available databases and also
from previously published literature [2]. The accession
numbers for all the FASTA sequences can be found in
the Additional File 1. The sequences retrieved were
cross-checked using the NCBI Conserved Domain Database [33] for the 7TM conserved domain, which is a hallmark of GPCRs.
Classification and ortholog detection

The initial data set was classified using the IUPHARDatabase [34], PRED-GPCR database [6], BIAS-PROFS
(Bioinformatics, Immunology and Algorithms make
Short work of PROtein Function classification) [35],
GPCRDB (Information System for G Protein-Coupled
Receptors) [36] and references from previously published papers [1,3,12,16,24,28,37-46] (Additional File 1).
We detected orthologous relationships between genes
of Fugu, human and chicken using systematic similarity
searches at the protein level. Taking the dataset of the
classified receptors, we compared it with the human and
chicken genomes using NCBI Protein BLAST [47] with
an extremely stringent similarity expect threshold of
1x10-6 for orthology detection [48].

Phylogenetic analysis

The Fugu GPCRs were broadly classified into NonRhodopsins and Rhodopsins and their respective subfamilies. The sequences of all the proteins (in FASTA format) were then combined into one file for performing
multiple sequence alignment employing the JTT200 protein weight matrix in the MAFFT version 6.624 [49], using
E-INS-I with a gap opening penalty of 1.53 and default offset value. SEQBOOT from the PHYLIP package [version
3.68] [49] was used on the ensuing datasets (i.e. the multiple sequence alignment files) and they were bootstrapped
1000 times. Subsequently 1000 (JTT) distance matrices
were obtained using PROTDIST. The neighbor-joining
method was employed through the NEIGHBOR program
and CONSENSE generated a consensus of 1000 neighbour
trees. Two additional multiple sequence alignment files
comprising of Rhodopsins and the Non-Rhodopsins were
also prepared, respectively, to get separate phylogenetic
trees (their corresponding numbering in the tree has been
mentioned in the Additional File 2) keeping the same
parameters. The sequences were grouped based on the
family identity observed with the human and chicken
orthologs (Additional File 3). Sequences were categorized
as ‘Other 7TM’ if they did not match the properties of any
family of the GRAFS classification system.
