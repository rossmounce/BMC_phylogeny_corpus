Abstract
Background: The SLC17 family of transporters transports the amino acids: glutamate and aspartate, and, as shown
recently, also nucleotides. Vesicular glutamate transporters are found in distinct species, such as C. elegans, but the
evolutionary origin of most of the genes in this family has been obscure.
Results: Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the SLC17 family consists of four main phylogenetic clades which
were all present before the divergence of the insect lineage. One of these clades has not been previously
described and it is not found in vertebrates. The clade containing Slc17a9 had the most restricted evolutionary
history with only one member in most species. We detected expression of Slc17a1-17a4 only in the peripheral
tissues but not in the CNS, while Slc17a5- Slc17a9 are highly expressed in both the CNS and periphery.
Conclusions: The in situ hybridization studies on vesicular nucleotide transporter revealed high expression
throughout the cerebral cortex, certain areas in the hippocampus and in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and
thalamus. Some of the regions with high expression, such as the medial habenula and the dentate gyrus of the
hippocampus, are important sites for purinergic neurotransmission. Noteworthy, other areas relying on purinemediated signaling, such as the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the periaqueductal gray, lack or have a
very low expression of Slc17a9, suggesting that there could be another nucleotide transporter in these regions.

Background
Membrane proteins constitute about one third of all
proteins encoded in the human genome [1]. The largest
family of membrane-bound proteins consists of over 800
G protein-coupled receptors [2,3] while the second largest is the solute carrier (SLC) family including 384
human genes [4]. The SLC genes encode proteins
related to passive transporters, ion-coupled transporters
and exchangers. SLCs were functionally grouped into
forty-three subfamilies [5]. Since then additional families
have been added including five new subfamilies, SLC44
- SLC48, according to the Hugo Gene Nomenclature
Committee [4].
A systematic phylogenetic analysis of the entire repertoire of SLC genes reveals that 15 of the SLC

subfamilies, along with synaptic vesicle 2 (SV2) proteins,
can be clustered into 5 major groups, named a-, b-, gand δ-groups [4]. The a-group is largest with SV2 proteins and seven SLC subfamilies (SLC2, 16, 17, 18, 22,
37 and 46). The main common features of the members
of the a-group are the presence of 12 putative transmembrane (TM) regions, N- and C-termini at the cytosolic side, a large extracellular loop between TM1 and
TM2 (except SLC17) and a large third intracellular loop.
The SLC17 family belonging to the a-group is known
as the type I phosphate/vesicular glutamate transporter
family [6]. The SLC17 family consists of nine genes that
have previously been functionally divided into four subgroups: (i) type I phosphate transporters, SLC17A1-4,
(ii) vesicular excitatory amino acid transporter,
SLC17A5 (previously known as sialin) (iii) vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT), SLC17A6-17A8, and (iv)
vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), SLC17A9
[7,8].

The type I phosphate transporters are known to cotransport sodium (Na) and phosphate (Pi), with a capacity to
also transport organic anions. Their ionic coupling properties have not been determined and the identity of their
endogenous substrates remains unresolved. Moreover,
data on the tissue distribution of the type I transporters
seem rather limited. The SLC17A1 expression has been
studied by northern blot and it has been identified in the
kidney, liver and, at very low levels, in the brain [9,10].
The SLC17A2 has a different expression pattern, with
relatively high levels in the heart and skeletal muscle and
lower levels in the kidney, liver, lung, placenta, pancreas
and brain [11,12]. SLC17A3 is limited to the liver and kidney [13], whereas SLC17A4 is expressed in the intestine,
colon, liver, and pancreas [14].
The second group of SLC17 proteins consists of the
vesicular excitatory amino acid transporter (VEAT/
SLC17A5), previously known as sialin. It was first identified as a lysosomal sialic acid transporter implicated in
the Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disorder
[15]. However, a recent study showed that SLC17A5
serves as a vesicular protein transporting aspartate and
glutamate and, hence, the name vesicular excitatory
amino acid transporter (VAT) was suggested [7].
Slc17a5 shows ubiquitous expression [15]; in the brain it
is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex [16,17].
The third group contains vesicular glutamate transporters involved in loading glutamate into synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic cells. In the SLC nomenclature the
three identified VGLUT transporters, VGLUT1 through
3 are classified as Sl17A7, A6 and A8, respectively.
Slc17a7 and Slc17a6 are predominantly expressed in
glutamatergic neurons of the central nervous system
(CNS). Interestingly, these genes have a complementary
expression pattern with limited overlaps [18,19]. Unlike
Slc17a7 and Slc17a6, Slc17A8 is expressed in CNS neurons not classically considered as glutamatergic [20,21].
The peripheral expression of Slc17a6 and Slc17a7 is limited to the pancreatic islets whereas Slc17a8 is expressed
in the liver and, at lower levels, in the kidney.
The fourth type of the SLC17 genes is represented by
a single gene in humans and it is named SLC17A9.
Recently it has been identified as the first vesicular
nucleotide transporter. The vesicular storage of this protein is confirmed by studies on PC12 cells. Functional
characterization of SLC17A9 in liposomes containing
the purified protein revealed that it transports nucleotides, such as ATP and ADP [8]. This is likely a major
breakthrough in understanding neuronal signaling
because ATP co-transmission is crucial in many neurons. The purinergic receptors that respond to ATP,
UTP and adenosine serve as important drug targets and
this transporter is likely to draw large attention for

pharmaceutical development. Northern blot analysis
showed wide expression of SLC17A9 in various organs,
but predominantly in the brain, adrenals and the thyroid
gland [8]. However, the detailed expression profile of
SLC17A9 in the brain is unknown.
Vesicular glutamate transporters are fundamental
components in glutamate signaling and are evolutionarily old. A vesicular glutamate transporter has been
characterized in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis [22] as
well as in Drosophila melanogaster [23] and Caenorhabditis elegans [24]. Also the presence of SLC17A9 in
many animal species has been suggested [8]. However,
despite the obvious biological importance of the SLC17
family, the evolutionary history of these genes has not
been systematically mapped.
In the current project, we thoroughly mined the entire
SLC17 family and explained the evolutionary events that
shaped different branches of this family. We also performed comprehensive expression analysis of the nine
SLC17 genes using quantitative real-time PCR (RTPCR) in the rat. We then looked in more detail at newly
discovered Slc17a9, the only known vesicular nucleotide
transporter, and performed a comprehensive expression
profiling of the Slc17a9 in the mouse brain by in situ
hybridization.

Methods
Animal handling and tissue isolation for quantitative
real-time PCR

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in the
controlled environment with optimum ventilation, temperature of 21°C, 12:12 LD cycle, and free access to
standard chow and water. After the acclimation period
of 7 days, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation. The
peripheral tissues and brain regions of interest were
isolated. These tissues were then immersed in the RNAlater solution (Ambion, USA) for 1 h at room temperature to remove RNases, and then stored at -80°C until
further processed. All animal procedures were approved
by the Uppsala Ethics Committee and followed the
guidelines of European Communities Council Directive
(86/609/EEC).
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as
described previously [25]. In brief, the tissue was homogenized by sonication and the RNA was extracted using
the TRIzol/chloroform method as previously reported
[26]. Genomic DNA contamination was removed by
adding DNaseI (Fermentas, Sweden). The cDNA was
synthesized by priming with random hexameres and
MMLV reverse transcriptase (GE Healthcare, Sweden)
RT-PCR

The expression profiles of all the nine rat genes
(rSlc17a1- rSlc17a9) were tested in a rat tissue panel

Sreedharan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:17

containing cDNA of 16 different brain regions and various peripheral tissues. All the primers were designed
using Beacon Primer Design 4.0 software (Premier Biosoft, USA) and all the sequences of primers used are
shown in Additional File 1. The RT-PCR reaction mixture contained cDNA synthesized from 25 ng of total
RNA, 0.25 pmol/μl of each primer, 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP,
SYBR Green (1:50,000) (Invitrogen, USA) and 0.02 U/μl
Taq DNA polymerase (Biotools, Spain). The reaction
conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C
for 4 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 55-62°C
for 30 s (optimal annealing temperature) and 72°C for
30 s. This was followed by a melt curve between 55°C
and 97°C (10 seconds per step and 0.5°C increase per
step) to identify non-specific amplification. All RT-PCR
experiments were performed in duplicates. A negative
control for each primer pair and a positive control with
25 ng of rat and mouse genomic DNA, respectively, was
included on each plate. MyiQ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Sweden) was used to perform RT-PCR.
Data analysis and expression calculation

RT-PCR data were processed with the MyiQ software
v1.04 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Sweden). The melting
curves were analyzed to confirm that only one product
with the expected melting point had been amplified.
The threshold cycle (Ct) values for the transcripts of
interest were obtained and all samples with a signal,
required to be at least 2 Ct values from the Ct value in
the negative control (if any), were considered as
expressed. LinRegPCR was used to calculate PCR efficiencies for each sample and Grubbs' test (GraphPad,
USA) was applied to exclude the outliers and to calculate the average PCR efficiency for each primer pair.
The GeNorm [27] protocol was used to identify the
most stable housekeeping genes for each tissue and normalized quantities were calculated.
cDNA Probe Synthesis

Antisense probe for mouse Slc17a9 was generated from
EST clone 4986674 (Invitrogen). Plasmid preparation
was performed using JETSTAR Plasmid Midi Kit (Genomed, USA). The plasmid were linearized with EcoRV
(Fermentas, Sweden) and used as template for antisense
digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probe synthesis and T7 polymerase was used for probe synthesis. The sense probe
was generated from the same EST clone and the plasmid was linearised with BstXI. Sp6 polymerase was used
for digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probe synthesis. The
probe synthesis was carried out as described earlier [28].
Tissue preparation for in situ hybridization

Adult male C57Bl6/J mice were housed in similar conditions as described above for the rats. The mice were
anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 1:1 mixture of Domitor (Medetomidine hydrochloride, 70 μg/g

Page 3 of 12

body weight, Orion, Finland) and Ketalar (Ketamine
hydrochloride, 7 μg/g body weight, Pfizer, Sweden).
Transcardial perfusion through the left ventricle with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) was performed to
obtain fixed brain tissue. The brain was excised and
incubated in 4% formaldehyde overnight, thereafter the
tissue was dehydrated and infiltrated with paraffin (Tissue Tek vacuum infiltration processor; Miles Scientific,
Elkhart, IN). Paraffin-embedded brain was sectioned
(7-μm thick) on the Microm microtome onto Superfrost
slides (Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and
stored at 4°C until usage.
In situ hybridization

The paraffin sections were deparaffinized in X-tra solve
(Medite Histotechnic, Burgdorf, Germany) and rehydrated with the series of ethanol washes (100%, 90%,
70%, 50%, 25%); followed by washing in PBS. The rehydrated sections were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min,
washed with PBS and treated with proteinase K (Invitrogen, Germany); 27 μg/ml diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl/
1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 15 min. The sections were
refixed with 4% PFA for 5 min and acetylated for
10 min in 1.3% triethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
0.2% acetic anhydride (Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany), and
0.06% HCl diluted in RNase free water. The sections
were then permeabilized with 1% Triton-X 100 (SigmaAldrich, USA) for 30 min and washed with PBS. The
slides were subsequently incubated in the hybridization
buffer [50% formamide (Fluka, Germany), 5× SSC, 5×
Denhardt's, 250 g/ml yeast transfer RNA (SigmaAldrich, USA), 500 g/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA
(Ambion, Austin, TX) diluted in RNase free water] without the probe for 1-2 h. The probe (0.5 μg/200 μl) was
denatured in the hybridization buffer at 80°C for 5 min
and then cooled in ice. The prehybridized sections were
hybridized with the cooled denatured probe in the
hybridization buffer overnight at 65°C. Next day the
slides were transferred to a 0.2× SSC and incubated at
65°C for 1-3 hrs. The slides were then washed first with
0.2× SSC at room temperature and then in the B1 solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.15 M NaCl). The
sections were immunoblocked with 10% fetal calf serum
in B1 and incubated overnight at 4°C in peroxidase conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) diluted 1:500 in B1 containing 10%
fetal calf serum. The following day the slides were
washed with PBS and then incubated in 300 μl of the
amplification buffer (Molecular probes™ Tyramide Signal
Amplification Kit, Invitrogen, USA) containing 3 μl
of the labeled tyramide solution (Molecular probes™
Tyramide Signal Amplification Kit, Invitrogen, USA )
for 10-15 min. The sections were washed with PBS and
stained with DAPI. They were mounted using DTG

(2.5% DABCO (Sigma), 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 90%
glycerol) and analyzed using the fluorescent microscope
(Zeiss XBO75). The Slc17a9 probe covers the 1178 bp
of the entire cDNA.
Data mining

The sequences for the 9 human SLC17 family proteins
were downloaded from the NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/ using the Entrez data retrieval tool with the
accession numbers as follows: SLC17A1, NP_005065.2;
SLC17A2, NP_005826.1; SLC17A3, NP_001091956.1;
SLC17A4, NP_005486.1; SLC17A5, NP_036566.1;
SLC17A6, NP_065079.1; SLC17A7, NP_064705.1;
SLC17A8, NP_647480.1; SLC17A9, NP_071365.3. The
sequences from each family were aligned using Tcoffee
5.72 [29]. From the alignments, sequence Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were constructed using the
HMMER 2.2 package [30]. The models were constructed
using HMMbuild with default settings and calibrated
using HMMcalibrate. The models were searched against
the following protein datasets: Mus musculus (NCBI
build 37.50, pep all); Gallus gallus (Hashington University build 2.50, pep all); Tetraodon nigviridis (build 8.5,
pep all); Danio rerio (build 7.50, pep all); Takifugu
rubripes (build 4.50, pep all); Ciona savigny (build
2.0.50, pep all); Branchiostoma floridae; Drosophila melanogaster (4.50, pep all); Caenorhabditis elegans (build
190.50, pep all); Schizosaccharomyces pombe (pompep);
Saccharomyces cervisiae (build 1.01.50, pep all). All hits
with an e-value better than 0.1 were extracted and nonSLC17 proteins were removed using phylogenetic analysis. The analysis included all human SLC16, SLC17,
SLC18 and SLC22 proteins in order to represent the
SLC families most similar to SLC17 [4].
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees were calculated for the SLC17 family
using the following procedure. Amino acid sequences in
Fasta format were aligned using T-Coffee 5.72. The
alignment was bootstrapped 1000 times using SEQBOOT from the Win32 version of the Phylip 3.6 package [31]. Maximum-parsimony trees were calculated on
the bootstrapped alignment with PROTPARS from the
Win32 version of the Phylip 3.6 package. The trees were
un-rooted and calculated using ordinary parsimony, and
the topologies were obtained using the built-in tree
search procedure. Majority-rule consensus trees were
constructed using CONSENSE from the Win32 version
of the Phylip 3.5 package. Neighbor joining trees were
calculated on the same bootstrapped sequences using
the Phylip 3.6 programs PROTDIST followed by
NEIGHBOR. For the maximum likelihood tree, the
topology obtained from the maximum parsimony tree
was used as a user-defined tree in TreePuzzle [32] and
maximum likelihood branch lengths were estimated in
TreePuzzle using the following parameters: Type of

Results
Mining

We mined the entire datasets of predicted proteins from
eight animal species (see Figure 1) as well as two unicellular species of yeast for SLC17 proteins using a
sequence Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on the
alignment containing the nine human SLC17 protein
sequences. We combined the hits with all human
SLC16, SLC17, SLC18 and SLC22 proteins and used
phylogenetic analysis to remove all non-SLC17 proteins.
The coding regions from all predicted proteins were
manually inspected and curated, essentially using the
same approach as previously described [34]. The SLC17
proteins identified in the mining were combined with all
human SLC17 proteins into the phylogenetic analysis.
This phylogenetic analysis shows that the SLC17 family
forms four main clades (see Figure 1). One of these is
only found in the invertebrate C. elegans and we suggest
that this family be called Slc17a10 (clade II) to adhere
to the previous nomenclature, see Additional File 2 for a
primary sequence comparison with the human SLC17
sequences. The Slc17a9, known as a vesicular nucleotide
transporter [8], forms a separate clade (clade I) and
places most closely to the Slc17a10 clade. This clade I
has one member in each animal species, with the exception of the three species of teleost fish investigated,
which appear to have one extra copy, most likely originating from the whole genome duplication that
occurred before the divergence of the teleost fish [35].
The B. floridae Slc17a9 places most basal in the clade I,
outside D. melanogaster and C. elegans. This is surprising considering the species relationship, but the Slc17a9
appears to have acquired lineage-specific changes in the
B. floridae, which reflects its basal position in the tree.
Clade III contains the human SLC17A6, A7 and A8, the
vesicular glutamate transporters. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the three vesicular glutamate transporters found in humans originate from a common
ancestor before the split of gnathostomes (Figure 2). It
is also apparent that extra copies of Slc17a6 and
Slc17a7, which probably were formed in the whole

Figure 2 The phylogenetic tree of the SLC17 family from human (hs, Homo sapiens), chicken (gg, Gallus gallus), puffer fish (tn,
Tetraodon nigroviridis), fugu fish (tr, Takifugu rubripes), zebra fish (dr, Danio rerio), amphioxus (bf, Branchiostoma floridae), sea squirt
(cs, Ciona savigyni), fruit fly (dm, Drosophila melanogaster) and round worm (ce, Caenorhabditis elegans): Our phylogenetic analysis
shows that the SLC17 family consists of four main clades termed III, III and IV with clade I containing two ancient sub-clades. The topology for
the tree is calculated from a maximum parsimony (MP) tree and the branch lengths are estimated on that topology using the maximum
likelihood method and are proportional to the evolutionary distance. Numbers in boxes indicates MP bootstrap values for the nodes close to the
root of the tree. The vGlut family from gnathostomes is removed from the main tree and presented as an insert for clarity although the
phylogeny was calculated for the tree including the gnathostome vGluts. Branch lengths for the two trees are drawn using the same scaling.

genome duplication before the divergence of teleosts,
were retained in some teleost species. Also Slc17a7
appears to have been lost in the chicken lineage. There
is most likely one ancestral gene to the gnathostome
SLC17A6 - A8, as we found protein sequences placing
basal of this group in B. floridae, D. melanogaster, C.
savygni and C. elegans. This sequence seems to have
duplicated locally in C. elegans to form three copies
(denoted a - c). Moreover, there is a basal group containing sequences from B. floridae and D. melanogaster,
which also seems to have expanded locally in both species, which could be ancestral. If this is the case, these
genes must have been lost after the divergence of B. fluviatilis, but it is also possible that these sequences are
copies of the same ancestral sequence as the gnathostome Slc17a6 - a8, but form their own group due to
rapid evolution. The largest clade contains five human
SLC17 sequences (clade IV), SLC17A1 - A5, where
SLC17A5 is clearly the most basal member. This clade
IV consists of two subgroups, which we denote
SLC17A5A and SLC17A5B, where the human SLC17A5,
the vesicular excitatory amino acid transporter [7]
belongs to the B group, whereas the A group appears to
have been lost before the appearance of vertebrates. In
this clade, Slc17a1 - a4 appear to be the most recent
members and we see two possible scenarios for their
evolution (see Discussion). These two scenarios suggests
that Slc17a1 - a4 are either specific to mammals, originating from Slc17a5, or that they arose from a common
ancestor present before the divergence of bony fish, that
was lost in the bird lineage. Regardless of the evolutionary history, these four orphan transporters are likely to
serve a specific function or, at least a more developed
one, in mammals. In this clade IV, we also see two large
expansions, one in the B. fluviatilis which includes eight
members of the A group and two members of the B
group, and one in D. melanogaster which has five members of the A group. We found no members of the
Slc17a5 clade in C. elegans.

was expressed in the kidney, liver, stomach and intestine. Slc17a5 had ubiquitous expression in all tissues
tested. Slc17a6 and Slc17a7 showed expression at different yet detectable levels in all brain regions tested and
in the spinal cord. However, in the periphery Slc17a6
was expressed in the eye, skeletal muscle, liver, spleen
and thymus, while SLC17A7 was detected in the eye
and heart. Slc17a8 was predominantly expressed in the
choroids plexus and - at low levels - in the cortex,
hypothalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, spinal cord, stomach and eye. Slc17a9 expression appeared ubiquitous
with the highest level in the stomach, intestine, liver,
skeletal muscle, spleen and blood; relatively lower levels
were detected in all brain regions studied, spinal cord,
adrenal gland, eye, skin and skeletal muscle.
The expression patterns of the nine genes (Slc17a1Slc17a9) in the brain obtained from RT-PCR (Figure 3)
were compared to the murine in situ hybridization data
from the Allen Brain Atlas and were found to be in
good agreement (see Additional file 2).
In situ hybridization analysis for Slc17a9

RT-PCR measurements

In situ hybridization revealed that Slc17a9 mRNA is
widely expressed in the brain (Figure 4). It is particularly
abundant throughout the cerebral cortex, where the distribution is uniformly high. In the hippocampus, the
granular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) displays a
remarkably high level of staining, while the molecular
layer of the DG and CA1 are devoid of the Slc17a9 signal and polymorph cells in the DG show a relatively
weak expression of this gene. Also, little staining was
visible in the periaqueductal gray (PAG). In the
hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the cells
immediately adjacent to the third ventricle (in the periventricular area; Pe) appear particularly rich in Slc17a9
mRNA. In addition, a strong signal was detected in the
ventromedial (VMH) and dorsomedial (DMH) nuclei.
Finally, in the thalamus, very high levels of Slc17a9
mRNA are found in the medial habenular nucleus
(MHb). A sense probe was generated for the Slc17a9 as
a negative control and it inferred no signal.

Expression analysis of all nine members of the SLC17
family was performed on a panel of rat tissues. The rat
panel consisted of cDNA synthesized from the RNA isolated from seven coronal sections of the rat brain [25],
different regions of the brain, various peripheral tissues
in total of 35 samples. The normalization factor was calculated based on the expression of four housekeeping
genes and the relative expression values are the fold
increase from the minimum detected expression in the
rat panel. The validation of the method and use of normalization factors are explained elsewhere [36].
The Slc17a1 and Slc17a2 were expressed in the skeletal muscle, kidney and liver. Slc17a3 was expressed in
the skeletal muscle, kidney and uterus, whereas Slc17a4

Discussion
We have performed detailed mining and phylogenetic
analysis of all SLC17 family proteins from eight species.
The analysis shows that this family consists of four
main phylogenetic clades, which were present before the
divergence of the insect lineage from those leading to
mammals. We denote those clades I to IV. Three of
these main clades include all the human members while
one clade contains only sequences from C. elegans. No
member of this entire clade has previously been
described in the literature. We propose the order of
events for the evolutionary history for the SLC17 family
from the nematodes to human and this is schematically

presented in Figure 1. We did not find any SLC17
family genes in any species more basal than the nematode, although we found sequences for predicted
proteins in Nematostella vectensis that have similarity to
the SLC17 family as well as to other SLC a-family
members. Our current data suggest that the four
main ancestral groups, denoted in four main colors in
Figure 2, originated from an MFS type transporter [4]
before the divergence of nematodes.
Clade I contains only the newly discovered vesicular
nucleotide transporter, VNut [8]. The evolutionary history of this gene is unique within the SLC17 family as it
is the only gene that has one member in almost all the
species. For multiple sequence alignment of the VNuts
discussed in this paper, see Additional File 3 and Additional file 4. An exception is however among bony fish,
where T. nigroviridis and D. rerio have retained an extra
copy, most likely as a result of the extra genome duplication. The new clade II was only found in C. elegans.

Our searches and phylogenetic analysis suggest that
these sequences are indeed members of a distinct clade
that does not exist in the vertebrate linage. Clade III
contains the vesicular glutamate transporters, VGluts,
which were present already in C. elegans. A common
ancestor to the three mammalian VGluts appears to
have existed before the divergence of gnathosomes and
this common ancestor likely gave rise to the three
VGluts found in current vertebrates (Figure 2). The
invertebrate species and also B. floridae have more
than one gene in Clade III; the phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 1) suggests that this could be the outcome of
local duplications. Clade IV has the most complex evolutionary history of the four SLC17 clades. The first
members of this clade appear in D. melanogaster having
five local copies of the original Slc17a5 sequence, which
we name Slc17a5B. This gene gave rise to another
Slc17a5 subtype, Slc17a5A, before the split of the B. floridae lineage. The original copy, Slc17a5B, was lost

before the split of bony fish. Also, before the split of
bony fish, Slc17a5 was duplicated to form the ancestor
of Slc17a1 - a4 that we named Slc17a1/2/3/4, which we
found in bony fish.
The long evolutionary history of the VNut suggests
that nucleotides as neurotransmitters are fundamental
to neuronal signaling and that this transport mechanism
is likely to have been present already in the most primitive nervous systems. In vertebrates, nucleotides are
known to function as co-transmitters to classical transmitters, in particular GABA [25]. Purines have also been
shown to be released as neurotransmitters on their own
and from their own vesicles, but at the same synapses as
other transmitters, inducing excitatory postsynaptic currents. This has been most clearly demonstrated in fish
[37]. Nucleotides as functional neurotransmitters act on
two classes of purinergic postsynaptic receptors, the G
protein-coupled P2Y [38] and the ionotropic P2X receptors [39]. Among these, the P2Y receptors have the
shortest evolutionary history, as being present in fish
[40], but not in B. floridae [41]. The evolutionary history
of the P2X receptors is, however, much longer. P2X
receptors are found in algae [42] as well as in Dictyostelium discoideum [43]. Interestingly, these receptors
appear to have been lost independently in both the
arthropod and nematode lineages [44]. Here we show
that although neither arthropods nor metazoans appear
to have purinergic receptors, at least not the type present in vertebrates, these lineages have retained a single
copy VNut transporter. These data suggest that purinergic signaling was present already in early eukaryotes
before the divergence of the plant lineage and lineage
leading to metazoans.
We observe that rat Slc17a9 in the present study
shows a differential expression profile when compared
to the mouse and the human counterpart in an earlier
study [8]. This discrepancy can be due to the species
specific expression pattern of the Slc17a9 gene which
has also been observed earlier between mouse and
human [8]. The RT-PCR data infers that the expression
of the adrenal gland is 34-fold higher than the tissue
that showed lowest expression. Further, the difference in
the method of detection of the mRNA level could
account for some changes in the expression levels.
Postsynaptic currents induced by stimulation of purinergic receptors have been demonstrated functionally
in the locus coeruleus, hippocampus, hypothalamus,
dorsal horn, habenuclear nucleus of the thalamus and
somatosensory cortex in mammals [45]. It is however
unclear whether all brain regions and most neurons
use ATP as a cotransmitter. Our in situ hybridization
shows that SLC17A9 mRNA is widely expressed in the
mouse brain, suggesting that neurons from most brain
regions may have the capacity to store ATP in vesicles.

Page 10 of 12

This widespread distribution is in concert with involvement in multiple processes suggested for purines,
including those related to feeding regulation [46], stress
and anxiety responsiveness [47,48], capacity of receptors to bind amino acids [49], and hippocampal neural
network formation [50]. It also shows that regions
where purinergic neurotransmission has previously
been demonstrated, for example, medial habenula and
the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, have particularly
high expression of Slc17a9 (see Figure 4). It is however
interesting to note that some regions, such as the
molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the PAG,
seem to lack or have very low expression of Slc17a9.
Since purinergic neurotransmission has been reported
within these areas [47,50,51], it is likely that SLC17A9
does not serve as the sole vesicular nucleotide transporter in these regions. The remaining orphan transporters in the SLC17 family are Slc17a2, a3, and a4
which are expressed only in the periphery (Figure 3)
and hence it is unlikely that these would be the additional transporters for purinergic neurotransmission.
One possibility is that one of the six orphan transporters phylogenetically closely related to the SLC16,
SLC17 and SLC18 families, that we recently reported
[4], could serve as an additional vesicular nucleotide
transporter. Another possibility is that SLC17A9
accounts for the only vesicular nucleotide transporter
and those neurons that do not express this gene do
not use purinergic signaling.
The three orphan transporters Slc17a2 - 4 [6] and
Slc17a1 were found only in mammals and originated
from the common ancestor, Slc17a1/2/3/4, which we
found in all three species of teleost fish. The duplications
from this common ancestor occurred most likely after
the split of the bird lineage as we did not find the common ancestor or any of the duplicates. The basal member
of this clade IV; Slc17a5 was recently shown to be a vesicular transporter for glutamate and aspartate, hence it is
possible that SLC17A1 to A4 could also be vesicular
transporters. In fact, all transporters from the SLC17
family
except
SLC17A1
which
transport
p-aminohippuric acid across renal apical membrane[52]
that have been functionally investigated are to our knowledge - a vesicular transporter, which suggests that the
location to vesicles is an ancestral functional feature
common for the SLC17 family. Our quantitative RT-PCR
data show that Slc17a1, a2, a3 and a4 are not expressed
in the brain, which was confirmed by searches in the
Allen Brain Atlas database [53]. These transporters are
mainly expressed in the muscle, liver and kidney, though
it is still possible that these are expressed in secretory
granules or other vesicles in these tissues. The SLC17A9
protein was, for example, shown to be expressed on chromaffin granules in the mouse adrenal gland [8].

Conclusion
We have performed extensive mining of a cluster of
solute carriers, named SLC17, that transport glutamate,
aspartate and nucleotides. We show the presence of four
independent evolutionary clades among these genes
which correspond well to the currently known substrates.
Surprisingly we found a new branch that forms one
of these main clades including eight novel genes in
C. elegans. The overall tissue distribution in central and
peripheral panels provides for the first time a comprehensive overview of the expression patterns for this family.
The detailed in situ hybridization of SLC17A9 shows high
expression throughout the cerebral cortex and distinct
patterns in, for example, the medial habenula and the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus where purinergic neurotransmission is important. Other regions implicated in
purine signaling, such as the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the PAG, seem to lack or have very low
expression of Slc17a9 suggesting that there could be
another nucleotide transporter in these regions.
