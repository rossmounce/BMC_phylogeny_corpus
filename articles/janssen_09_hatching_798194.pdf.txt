Abstract
Despite their increasing evolutionary importance, basic knowledge about the priapulid worms
remains limited. In particular, priapulid development has only been partially documented. Following
previous description of hatching and the earliest larval stages of Priapulus caudatus, we here describe
the hatching larva of Halicryptus spinulosus. Comparison of the P. caudatus and the H. spinulosus
hatching larvae allows us to attempt to reconstruct the ground pattern of priapulid development.
These findings may further help unravelling the phylogenetic position of the Priapulida within the
Scalidophora and hence contribute to the elucidation of the nature of the ecdysozoan ancestor.

Background
The Cycloneuralia is a small group of worms, poorlyknown apart from the numerous and important nematodes. With the advent of the Ecdysozoa theory [1] they
came to be considered as the sister group to the Arthropoda, the most diverse and abundant living animal clade.
Within the Cycloneuralia, the Priapulida have been
placed basally by some analyses; possibly even within the
Ecdysozoa as a whole, leading to them being sometimes
described as "living fossils" [1-4]. Despite their obviously
important phylogenetic position, information on their
biology is scarce – especially concerning their embryonic
development and their earliest larval stages. Even data on
the best-studied priapulid, Priapulus caudatus, the priapulid species whose genome was recently approved to be
sequenced http://www.genome.gov/10002154, was until
recently scarce, incomplete and contradictory [3-8]. Particular interest in scalidophoran and priapulid larvae has
increased with the finding of fossilized putative stem
group scalidophoran embryos from the Cambrian [9,10].
A proper comparison of such fossil embryos with recent
embryos/larvae is obviously only possible if the corresponding embryonic stages and larvae can be described in

detail. In our recent work we described for the first time
the confirmed earliest larval stages of P. caudatus, which
possessed some surprising features, such as the lack of a
mouth. At that time it was unclear whether these features
were apomorphic for P. caudatus or were plesiomorphic
within Priapulida [4]. Here we describe the hatching larva
of the distantly related priapulid worm Halicryptus spinulosus (Fig. 1A–C) and compare it with the hatching larva of
P. caudatus [4].

Results
Although many thousands of eggs could be obtained and
fertilized in this study, the success rate of development to
hatching was extremely low, with the result that only 52
specimens of hatched larvae were available for this study.
This is in contrast to a previous study of P. caudatus where
many tens of thousands of hatching larvae and large numbers of subsequent larval stage specimens could be
obtained under controlled laboratory conditions. This
disparity is likely linked to sperm quality. As measured by
sperm motility, the quality of H. spinulosus sperm was
much lower than for P. caudatus: only very few spermatozoa swam actively and were separated from the gonads

and/or sister-spermatozoa; possibly leading to delayed
fertilization or polyspermy (if the eggs were fertilized by
floating or swimming "groups" of attached spermatozoa).
Because of this restriction we were not able to examine all
documented features in great numbers. Nevertheless, the
stability of the results obtained strongly suggests that the
characters we describe are natural features of the H. spinulosus hatching larva.
The first H. spinulosus larva hatched 21 days after fertilization when kept at approximately 4°C. In the following
three days the remaining larvae hatched implying that the
development is largely synchronized. Most of the
obtained larvae (40) were processed for Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM), 12 were allowed to develop in order to
reach subsequent larval stages. Although these latter
hatching larvae were alive for several weeks they did not
moult and eventually died.
The lack of a proper lorica is the most obvious feature of
the H. spinulosus hatching larva (Figs 2A–C, F and 3G, I, J);
a feature also lacking in P. caudatus [4]. Since a lorica is
present in all hitherto described larvae of H. spinulosus it is
clear that the hatching larva has never been described
before [11-21]. The assumption of Purasjoki [13] that he
must have described the first larval stage because of its
similar size (290 μm and 340 μm) as the "mature egg"
(280 μm) is clearly wrong, not only because the larva
described here is much smaller, but also because the size
of the egg is obviously less than 280 μm. In figure 1D we
show an egg with an almost fully developed embryo. The
eggs are completely round and an anterior extension as
described by Purasjoki [13] was never observed. The size
of the eggs (ca. 50–60 μm) and the hatching larva with
fully protruded introvert (ca. 120 μm) is approximately
the same as for P. caudatus (cf. [3,4]). The H. spinulosus
hatching larva also superficially resembles the hatching
larva of P. caudatus in its light-bulb shaped appearance (cf.
[4]). However, an obvious difference concerns the motility of the larvae. Whereas the P. caudatus hatching larva is
only capable of moving its introvert in and out, that of H.
spinulosus is also able to bend its complete body – possibly
because of an extra set of muscles and/or (at least) two
horizontal lines of weaknesses in the cuticle covering the
trunk (Fig. 2A, B). The hatching larvae of P. caudatus and
H. spinulosus both lack a mouth and pharyngeal teeth (Fig.
2A, D); and share the arrangement of 7+1 scalids (Fig. 2D,
E), the subdivision of the body into introvert, neck and
trunk (Fig. 2C, H, I) and the presence of four weakly developed posterior tubuli of which maximal three are seen on
the photographs presented here (Figs 2A–C, F and 3G, I,
J) (cf. [4]). In some cases a few micro-spines (<1 μm) are
sparsely distributed on their surface (Fig. 3L and not
shown). The tubuli are arranged in pairs of two with the
pairs of closer together tubuli being situated at the puta-

tive lateral sides of the larva, as also shown for later larval
stages and larvae of other priapulids (Figs 2C and 3J) (e.g.
[4,14]). In later larval stages four tubuli are also present,
but they are located only slightly below the midregion of
the lorica (trunk) on the lateral plates [14]. The arrangement of the scalids in an anterior ring armed with seven
first-ring scalids and one to three somewhat more posteriorly-located smaller second-ring scalids is less clear than
for P. caudatus (cf. [4]). In fact we only found larvae with
one secondary scalid (Fig. 2D, E). With exception of the
size first-ring (12–14 μm) and second-ring scalids (6–10
μm) were identical. The scalids are thus considerably
shorter than in P. caudatus (cf. [4]). They have a triangular
basis emanating from the introvert, a prominent dorsal
ridge, are pointed backwards (when the introvert is protruded) and bend towards the body (Fig. 3K). The tip is
branched or with a single tip (Fig. 3K). Occasional microspines (<1 μm) are present on some of the primary scalids
(Fig. 3K). The surface of the introvert is characterized by a
number of vertical ridges (Fig. 2H, I), similar as in adults.
The surfaces of the neck and trunk are smooth. The surface
of the cuticle spanning the anterior of the larva that will in
later stages be armed with pharyngeal teeth is covered
with small pores (Fig. 2G). These small irregularly allocated pores, approximately 60 nm in diameter, may represent openings of sensory organs.
The Halicryptus hatching larva possesses two outgrowths,
the neck-flosculi, on opposite sites of the body, at the border between introvert and neck (Fig. 3A–F). They are 1–2
μm long and composed of a short base and circlets of
cuticular papillae at the tip that surround a single pore
(Fig. 3B, E, F). Interestingly all the neck-flosculi in the H.
spinulosus hatching larva are associated with a filiform
structure (ca. 3 μm long) emanating from the centre of
each flosculus (Fig. 3A–F). The nature and function of
these structures is unclear, although the flosculi themselves are clearly sensory organs [18]. In older larval stages
of H. spinulosus the number of neck-flosculi increases to at
least 15 [18]. For the P. caudatus hatching larva we
described two outgrowths in a similar position [4]. These
represent tubular structures (neck-tubuli) rather than flosculi. It is unlikely that the ca. 6.5 μm long neck-tubuli in
P. caudatus are homologous to the flosculi of H. spinulosus
since flosculi in general were never reported for any
described P. caudatus larva. One exception is the documentation of a single flosculus-like structure on a putative
early larva of P. caudatus [22], but if this larva actually represents a larva of P. caudatus is unclear (discussed in [4]).
In a few fixed larvae the rear end formed a tapered structure possibly representing the anal region (Fig. 3G, H).
Whether or not a proper anal opening is present is
unclear. However its presence is unlikely because of the
lack of a mouth and the reported lack of an anus in the P.

caudatus hatching larva (cf. [4]). The hatching larvae of
both P. caudatus and H. spinulosus are still yolk-rich and as
discussed for the P. caudatus larva, it seems likely that the
H. spinulous hatching larva simply digs down into the mud
in order to escape from the dangerous surface of the seafloor.
The systematics of the priapulids are not well-characterised. However, Lemburg [19] places both Priapulus and
Halicryptus within the Priapulidae, although distant from
each other, a position supported by both Dong et al. [9]
and Wills [23]. Their shared developmental data thus
allows a partial reconstruction of the ground plan of the
Priapulidae hatching morphology (Fig. 1C): It includes
the following features: 1) of light-bulb shape, 2) subdivided into introvert, neck and trunk, 3) lacking a true lorica, 4) without a mouth, 5) without pharyngeal teeth, 6)
armed with 7+X scalids and 8) with four posterior tubuli.
Further investigation of more basal taxa such as Tubiluchus
will be required to extend the investigation of ground plan
development to the Priapulida as a whole, an essential
prelude to phylogenetic reconstruction of their morphological and developmental evolution [24].

Methods
Halicryptus spinulosus breeding conditions
We fertilized apparently mature eggs of Halicryptus spinulosus during several field seasons from winter 2007 to early
spring 2009. Although in all cases a number of eggs were
successfully fertilized as recognized by the formation of a
fertilization-membrane and the commencement of cleaving, hatched larvae were only been observed once (early
winter 2008). In all other cases fertilized eggs underwent
irregular cleavage (not shown) and eventually died before
reaching the larval stage. Priapulid collection, preparation, fertilisation and breeding were performed in the
same way during all of the field seasons. Sexually mature
female and male specimens of H. spinulosus were collected
from Trosa archipelago close to the Askö marine station
on the east coast of Sweden south of Stockholm. Gonads

were stripped off and eggs were artificially fertilised as
described for Priapulus caudatus [3,4]. The developing eggs
were rinsed every day with fresh filtered see water collected from the same collection site as the adults. Decaying eggs where removed. To maintain water quality
throughout the developing phase water was frozen after
filtration and thawed the day before use. Embryos and
hatching larvae were kept at approximately 4°C in a conventional fridge.
Larvae fixation and preparation
To ensure that the introvert was protruded a needle was
used to mechanically push it out from the rear. The hatching larvae were fixed either in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for
four hours at room temperature or over night at 4°C in
the fridge. Storage and preparation for Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) was performed as described in [4].
Documentation techniques
For SEM pictures, a Zeiss Supra 35VP scanning electron
microscope with field emission gun was used. For light
microscopic pictures, a Nikon D70 camera was attached
to a Nikon Eclipse E400 light microscope. Further processing of SEM and light microscopy images was carried out in
Photoshop CS.
