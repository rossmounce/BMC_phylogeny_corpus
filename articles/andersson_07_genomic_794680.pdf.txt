Abstract
Background: Comparative genomic studies of the mitochondrion-lacking protist group Diplomonadida (diplomonads)
has been lacking, although Giardia lamblia has been intensively studied. We have performed a sequence survey project
resulting in 2341 expressed sequence tags (EST) corresponding to 853 unique clones, 5275 genome survey sequences
(GSS), and eleven finished contigs from the diplomonad fish parasite Spironucleus salmonicida (previously described as S.
barkhanus).
Results: The analyses revealed a compact genome with few, if any, introns and very short 3' untranslated regions.
Strikingly different patterns of codon usage were observed in genes corresponding to frequently sampled ESTs versus
genes poorly sampled, indicating that translational selection is influencing the codon usage of highly expressed genes.
Rigorous phylogenomic analyses identified 84 genes – mostly encoding metabolic proteins – that have been acquired by
diplomonads or their relatively close ancestors via lateral gene transfer (LGT). Although most acquisitions were from
prokaryotes, more than a dozen represent likely transfers of genes between eukaryotic lineages. Many genes that provide
novel insights into the genetic basis of the biology and pathogenicity of this parasitic protist were identified including 149
that putatively encode variant-surface cysteine-rich proteins which are candidate virulence factors. A number of genomic
properties that distinguish S. salmonicida from its human parasitic relative G. lamblia were identified such as nineteen
putative lineage-specific gene acquisitions, distinct mutational biases and codon usage and distinct polyadenylation signals.
Conclusion: Our results highlight the power of comparative genomic studies to yield insights into the biology of
parasitic protists and the evolution of their genomes, and suggest that genetic exchange between distantly-related protist
lineages may be occurring at an appreciable rate in eukaryote genome evolution.

Background
Diplomonads are a diverse group of small mitochondrion-lacking diplokaryotic flagellates found in anaerobic
or micro-aerophilic environments [1]. Most research on
diplomonads has focused on Giardia lamblia (syn. Giardia
intestinalis, Giardia duodenalis), which is a major cause of
water-borne enteric disease in humans in both industrialised and developing countries [2]. However, there are
important variations in lifestyles among diplomonads;
although many are endocommensals or parasites associated with animals, there are also several free-living species, mainly within the genera Trepomonas and Hexamita,
that are found in aquatic environments rich in organic
matter and deficient in oxygen [1]. Most members of the
genus Spironucleus are parasites, typically of fish but also
of birds and mice; several Spironucleus species have been
shown to cause disease in their hosts [1], although essentially nothing is known about the virulence mechanisms
of Spironucleus species. Spironucleus salmonicida, the focus
of this study, can cause systemic and organ infections in
cultivated salmon, posing a significant problem for the
aquaculture industry [3,4]. This isolate was previously
known as Spironucleus barkhanus [5], but pathogenic isolates of this species were recently redescribed as S. salmonicida to distinguish them from morphologically identical,
but genetically distinct, fish commensal isolates of S.
barkhanus [6].
Diplomonads were once thought to belong to the earliestdiverging lineage within the eukaryotes [7]. Accordingly,
they were described as 'biological fossils', true eukaryotes
with many peculiarities (e.g. two nuclei, different genetic
code, lack of aerobic mitochondria) that retained some
ancestral prokaryotic properties [8,9]. However, advances
in molecular phylogenetics and cell biology during the
last decade strongly suggest this view is incorrect [10]. The
current interpretation of the phylogeny of eukaryotes
lends no support for diplomonads as the earliest eukaryotic branch [11,12]. Indeed, a sister-group relationship
between diplomonads and parabasalids to the exclusion
of other eukaryotic lineages and the root has recently been
demonstrated, based both on phylogenetic analysis of
concatenated protein-coding sequences [13-15], and on
shared gene acquisitions [16,17]. Diplomonads and parabasalids are now classified within the eukaryotic supergroup Excavata [18]. Furthermore, diplomonads seem to
have all features previously thought to be lacking in
"primitive" eukaryotes, including an organelle with mitochondrial ancestry (mitosome) [19] and intron-containing genes [20,21], while some prokaryotic properties are
probably the result of lateral gene transfers from the
prokaryotic realm [22].
Recently, enteromonads (monokaryotic protists traditionally regarded as closely related to diplomonads) were sur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

prisingly found to branch robustly with Trepomonas and
Hexamita in phylogenetic analyses to the exclusion of
Spironucleus [23]. These results suggest that the diplokaryotic state of diplomonads arose multiple times independently, or that the monokaryon of enteromonads is a
derived feature. Large genetic and biological variation also
exists within diplomonads. For example, Spironucleus,
Trepomonas and Hexamita, form a monophyletic clade to
the exclusion of Giardia in phylogenetic trees [24], and use
an alternative genetic code whereby TAA and TAG, rather
than being stop codons, encode glutamine [25,26].
To gain insights into the evolutionary history and
genomic architecture of diplomonads in general and
Spironucleus in particular, we initiated a genome survey
project in S. salmonicida. To maximize gene discovery we
obtained expressed sequence tag (EST) and genomic survey sequences (GSS), and completely sequenced eleven
contigs. Here, we present analyses of the complete set of
sequences obtained in the genome survey project.
Although we present data that only partially covers the S.
salmonicida genome, these data provide key insights into
the genome-level properties of S. salmonicida such as its
coding content, base compositional biases, gene content,
gene architecture, and patterns of gene acquisitions. From
these analyses, we are able to make inferences about the
biology of a poorly-understood fish parasite, as well as
gain a first glimpse into genome evolution within the
enigmatic protist phylum Diplomonadida.

Results and discussion
The first sequence data from Spironucleus on the genomic
level
This sequence survey of S. salmonicida has been the starting point for several projects regarding different aspects of
the genetics and molecular evolution of this diplomonad
[16,27-33]. Together with a few other studies, these have
resulted in about thirty S. salmonicida genes in the public
databases. The present analysis of the complete set of
2408 EST and 5275 GSS sequences, combined with a the
complete sequence of eleven contigs corresponding to 80
kbp unique sequence (Additional file 1), extend this
information to include 1738 unique protein coding
genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and 20 tRNA genes
(Table 1 and Additional file 2). Altogether our sequence
data cover more than 2.5 Mbp of the S. salmonicida
genome. The only genome size reported from a diplomonad is 12 Mbp for the genome of G. lamblia [34]. The
genome size of S. salmonicida is unknown, but the degree
of sequence overlap between independent clones in our
random genomic shotgun library yielded a very rough
estimate of approximately 7 Mbp of unique sequence (see
Methods for details of the calculation). Interestingly, the
observation that 33% of the EST sequences have matches
within the GSS sequences suggests a genome size in a sim-

ilar range, unless the same genes are preferentially cloned
in both the EST and GSS sequences. Thus, there are no
indications within our sequence survey project that the S.
salmonicida genome is larger than the G. lamblia genome.
These observations indicate that our obtained sequences
potentially represent one third of the complete genome.
Variable G+C content along the genome
On the whole, the S. salmonicida genome was found to be
G+C poor; the average G+C contents were 35.9%, and
39.3% within the 5070 GSSs and the eleven finished
sequences, respectively. However, the eleven finished contigs showed large variation in G+C content, with average
G+C contents ranging from 24.9% to 58.3% (named Sp111, Figure 1). This probably cannot be explained by the
presence within each contig of genes with the higher values; the coding content of Sp2 is 96% and its G+C content
is only 31%, while the coding content of Sp8 is 75% and
its G+C content is 58% (Additional file 1). In fact, the
G+C content sometimes varies drastically within each
contig. For example, the average G+C content in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

region between 1–5 kbp from the 5' end of Sp1 is around
30%, while between 6–11 kbp its G+C content is almost
70% (Figure 1). Similar sharp shifts in G+C content along
the genome are observed in some other contigs (e.g. Sp7,
Sp10, and Sp11: Figure 1). These shifts in G+C content do
not seem to be correlated with the presence and absence
of genes: both G+C rich and poor regions are fairly dense
with genes, with the exception of the G+C poor contig Sp4
and the 5' end of Sp9. However, these observations are
consistent with the existence of different mutational
biases in different regions of the S. salmonicida genome;
the G+C contents of both the third synonymous position
of protein coding genes and the non-coding regions varies
as expected if mutational bias shapes the G+C content
[35], with the GC3 values of genes higher than the average
G+C content for genes in G+C rich regions and lower in
G+C poor regions (Figure 1). A similar pattern is observed
for non-coding regions (Additional file 1), and the codon
usage analysis indicates large variations of the G+C contents among genes (see below).

S. salmonicida has a compact genome
Analysis of the eleven completely sequenced contigs
showed that the coding density varies significantly
between contigs (Figure 1 and Additional file 1). Some
parts of the genome appear to be very gene-dense, with
short intergenic regions. In fact, six cases of putative overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, similar to earlier findings in G. lamblia [36]. The lengths of the
overlapping regions range from 1 to 101 bp; in four cases
they are encoded in the same direction, while in the other
two cases the 5' regions overlap. Experimental studies are
needed to determine which initiation codons actually are
used in these putative genes to determine if they are truly
overlapping transcribed ORFs that encode functional proteins. Nevertheless, the whole genome does not seem to
be packed with genes; no protein coding sequence could
be detected in the almost 5-kbp contig Sp4, nor in a long
region upstream of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene in Sp9
(Figure 1). In G. lamblia, the genes for ribosomal RNA
have been found to be associated with telomeres [37].
However, we were unable to detect any sequence similarity to genes that are associated with telomeres in G. lamblia, or any telomere repeats, in the long region upstream
of the rRNA genes in S. salmonicida Sp9.

The transcription of protein-encoding genes in Giardia is
atypical for eukaryotes. The promoters are short; less than
70 bp is needed for efficient expression of most genes,
even if they are stage-specific [38]. The 5'-UTRs of the transcripts are usually only 1–10 nt, and the genes lack TATA
boxes or other cis-acting promoter elements characteristic
of typical eukaryotic promoters; AT-rich sequences
around the G. lamblia ATG initiation codons determine
the transcriptional start site and are essential and sufficient for promoter activity [39]. The S. salmonicida promoters apparently lack TATA-boxes and other typical
eukaryotic promoter motifs (Figure 2A). However, AT-rich
stretches are found close to the translational start sites, or
in the first 50 bp upstream (Figure 2A) and the intergenic
regions are very short (Figure 1). Thus, the S. salmonicida
transcriptional machinery appears to resemble the 'atypical' machinery previously characterized in G. lamblia [39].
The position of the polyA tail in relation to the termination codon could be mapped in 134 EST clones. The 3'
untranslated regions (UTR) of S. salmonicida genes appear
to be short; the average distance between the termination
codon and the first A in the polyA tail is 13.2 bases and in
122 of the 134 cases the distance is between 9 and 14
nucleotides (Figure 2B). Such very short 3' UTRs have previously been observed in G. lamblia, but this is in stark
contrast to most other studied eukaryotes where 3' UTRs
have been proposed to play important roles in regulating
messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translation [40]. In
G. lamblia, AGTRAAY has been identified as a consensus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

polyadenylation signal [41]. Our analyses do not identify
any strong consensus sequence outside the conserved
unique termination codon TGA, although we observe a
preference for A in the position two bases upstream of the
termination codon, and a T immediately downstream
(Figure 2B). Interestingly, the three most conserved nucleotides in the G. lamblia polyadenylation signals are the
central TRA nucleotides, which is similar to the situation
in S. salmonicida. Furthermore, a preference for a U-rich
region close to the polyA tail is also apparent, a pattern
conserved in many eukaryotes but not Giardia [41,42]. It
has been reported that a fraction (~20%) of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) from G. lamblia represent polyadenylated sterile anti-sense transcripts that may result from
a loose control of transcription [43]. The rarity of such
sterile transcripts in our cDNA library (~1% among 2341
EST) indicates that this phenomenon is not universal for
diplomonads. Indeed, our data indicate considerable variation in the specificity of the transcription and polyadenylation machineries within diplomonads.
The availability of both EST and genomic sequences was
used to identify putative introns. An intron should be
detected as a sequence gap in an alignment between the
EST and the corresponding genomic sequence because the
EST sequences typically represent the spliced version of
the gene sequence. This approach was used to identify
potential introns using similarity searches with the EST
sequences as probes against the GSS and finished contig
genomic sequences. 290 out of 885 ESTs matched with an
e < e-10 (i.e., almost all were identical sequences) and manual inspection failed to detect any introns. The S. salmonicida genome appears to be very intron-poor. Given that
only a few introns have been detected within the diplomonad G. lamblia [20,21], a paucity of introns could represent the ancestral state of the diplomonads. However,
two introns were detected in one of the first genes
sequenced from Carpediemonas [44], an excavate taxon
and possible sister lineage to diplomonads. Thus, introns
may have been more frequent in a common ancestor of
diplomonads and Carpediemonas, and that the ancestral
diplomonad lineage experienced genome-wide intron
loss, an evolutionary phenomenon that is not uncommon
[45]. A basic spliceosomal organisation is present in Giardia suggesting that the spliceosome is ancestral to extant
eukaryotes [46]. Although our analyses did not identify
any proteins likely to be involved in splicing in S. salmonicida, further sequencing and more detailed analyses are
needed to determine whether introns and a functional
spliceosomal apparatus are present in S. salmonicida.
Coding capacity of S. salmonicida
In this study we have identified more than 1300 novel
genes, distributed among all functional categories, representing a twenty-fold increase of the number of genes with

assigned functions identified in the S. salmonicida genome
(Table 1). Among these were genes involved in translation: 74 genes encoding ribosomal proteins, many translation factors, and fifteen different tRNA synthetases were
identified (Additional file 2). Twenty tRNA genes were
identified, which cover 24 of the 63 sense codons allowing for the normal wobble rules for codon-anticodon
pairing. No tRNA was identified that decodes UAG or
UAA codons, which encode glutamine in Spironucleus,
although such tRNA genes have been identified previously
[25]. Interestingly, all 64 codons appear to have the
potential to code for incorporation of amino acids into
proteins in S. salmonicida; both tRNA identification programs used in our analyses identified a putative tRNA with

the anticodon UCA, annotated as a selenocysteine (Sec)
tRNA. The identification of a putative Sec tRNA, which is
a central component of selenoprotein biosynthesis [47],
in our data set suggests that Spironucleus is able to use the
single stop codon (UGA) to incorporate this rare amino
acid into selenoproteins. Indeed, the usage of selenocysteine seems to be widespread feature in protists; Sec
tRNAs have recently been identified in Dictyostelium, Tetrahymena, and Plasmodium [48,49].
The identified proteins within the cellular, environmental
information, and genetic information process categories
in our data set clearly reflect a coding potential similar to
a typical eukaryote, including eukaryotic translation and

transcription machineries, many proteins involved in
eukaryotic signal transduction pathways, a large family of
dynein proteins, and five genes encoding members of the
Rab small GTPase family (Additional file 2). This is
indeed expected from the current view of diplomonad
phylogeny and cell biology (see Background section).
Interestingly, only eight Rab genes were found in G. lamblia, while a large number of Rab GTPases were found in
Trichomonas vaginalis, most likely related to the apparently
more-complex endomembrane system in this parabasalid
[50]. Two of the five Rab proteins identified in our survey
lack identifiable orthologs in the G. lamblia genome, but
branch with T. vaginalis Rab sequences in phylogenetic
trees (data not shown), suggesting that S. salmonicida has
retained Rab proteins that have been lost in the lineage
leading to G. lamblia.
Absences of genes are very difficult to infer from partial
genome data, but some general trends may be observed.
For example, relatively few enzymes involved in amino
acid metabolism were detected (Additional file 2). Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are classified into this category,
but they are atypical since they are essential for protein
synthesis. Furthermore, only a single protein (malate
dehydrogenase) associated with the tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle was found. However, malate dehydrogenase
actually functions in a pyruvate synthesis pathway in G.
lamblia [2], rather than in the TCA cycle, suggesting a similar role in S. salmonicida. In contrast, several glycolytic
proteins are present in our data set (Additional file 2).
This pattern of metabolic proteins is expected from a fermentative phagotrophic heterotroph which has access to
organic compounds from its host, and indeed is very similar to the pattern found in Entamoeba histolytica [51].
These similarities between S. salmonicida and E. histoytica
are almost certainly due to independent adaptations to
such an environment in the two lineages. Indeed, a considerable fraction of the metabolic proteins was found to
be more closely related to prokaryotic rather than eukaryotic homologs in the phylogenomic analyses, suggesting
acquisition of these genes by gene transfer (see further discussion below).
Does S. salmonicida possess mitosomes?
A new organelle, the mitosome, has recently been identified in G. lamblia, that is probably a remnant of a mitochondrion [19]. Currently, the only known function of
mitosomes in Giardia is iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis
[52,53]. The phylogenetic relationship between G. lamblia
and S. salmonicida, the likely mitochondrial origin of the
organelle, together with mitochondria and their derived
organelles currently being thought to be universally
present in all extent eukaryotes [10] strongly suggest that
the common ancestor of the two species contained an
organelle with mitochondrial ancestry. Here we identified

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

two strong cases of candidate mitosomal proteins in S. salmonicida, a chaperon GroEL (or Hsp60 or Cpn60) a key
protein for mediating protein folding in mitochondria
[28] and a cysteine desulfurase (called Nifsp in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a key enzyme of the Fe-S cluster synthesis
pathway [54] (Additional file 2). Orthologous proteins of
Hsp60 and Nifsp are known to localize and function in S.
cerevisiae mitochondria and G. lamblia mitosomes
[52,53]. Localization studies of these two proteins should
indeed be very useful to investigate whether S. salmonicida
contains mitosomes.
A full-length ORF encoding a dynamin-like protein that is
found on contig Sp3 (Figure 1) is another protein potentially linked with the mitosome. The G. lamblia genome
encodes a single dynamin-like protein and phylogenetic
analyses recover the two diplomonad sequences as monophyletic (data not shown). The function of the G. lamblia
single dynamin-like protein is currently unknown. Yet, a
single dynamin-like protein encoding gene is also found
in three kinetoplastid genomes (two Trypanosoma and one
Leishmania) [55] and the microsporidium Encephalitozoon
cuniculi [56], whereas most eukaryotic genomes encode
several dynamin-like paralogues that function either in
membrane trafficking or organelle division (mitochondria and plastids) [57]. Interestingly, the single dynaminlike protein from Trypanosoma brucei was shown to be
involved in mitochondrial division [58]. Hence the single
dynamin-like proteins in Spironucleus, Giardia and
Encephalitozoon could all be involved in mitosome division.
A large family of cysteine-rich proteins
The predicted amino acid sequences of 149 genes were
found to contain more than 10% cysteine and were classified as cysteine-rich proteins. Most of these were annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins, although some
could be assigned to a functional category (Additional file
2). Most of the cysteine residues were found as CXXC
motifs (Figure 3 and data not shown). Such an arrangement is similar to the large protein family of variant-specific surface proteins (VSP) found in G. lamblia [59],
which is estimated to comprise 2.4% of the genome [60].
However, less than 10% of the cysteine-rich proteins in S.
salmonicida showed highest sequence similarities to G.
lamblia cysteine-rich proteins, and the two conserved
motifs of G. lamblia VSP proteins, CRGKA and GGCY [59],
were not found within any of the amino acid sequence of
S. salmonicida cysteine-rich proteins. Indeed, in similarity
searches the majority were most similar to putative proteins discovered in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila
genome project (data not shown) [61]. These observations indicate that diplomonads vary greatly in their
cysteine-rich proteins; the gene families indeed appear to
have expanded independently in the Giardia and Spironu-

cleus lineages. The biological role of VSP proteins is not
well understood, but VSP proteins are immuno-dominant
in G. lamblia and expressed on the cell surface [59].
Among the 149 cysteine-rich proteins coding sequences
two are likely to represent full-length ORFs. These are
strong candidate surface proteins since they possess a
transmembrane (TM) domain and a cysteine-rich domain
made of furin-like and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF)like domains typical of surface or secreted proteins, a feature shared with G. lamblia VSPs (Figure 3). A total of 14
sequences encoding partial proteins with cysteine-rich
domains possess similar structural organization as the
one shown in Figure 3, i.e. they possess a TM domain with
the cysteine-rich domains likely to face the extra-cellular
milieu. No TM domains could be found in the remaining
cysteine-rich proteins within our dataset. However, in several cases these partial cysteine-rich proteins show high
similarity to cysteine-rich proteins containing TM
domains, suggesting that they could represent partial surface protein sequences (derived from EST or GSS). This
observation is consistent with the genome of S. salmonicida encoding a large gene family of cysteine-rich variant
surface proteins, as established for the VSP protein family
in G. lamblia where only one of the 150 VSP genes is
expressed per cell. In G. lamblia the VSP gene family displays antigenic variation and new VSP genes are induced
at a relatively high frequency, which is important for
escaping the host's adaptive immune system [2,59,62].
Further sequence data and analyses, as well as expression
and cellular localization studies are needed to understand
the function of this large protein family in S. salmonicida.
Insights into the molecular basis of S. salmonicida
pathogenicity
Spironucleus species have been described as a cause of disease in hosts that include birds, fish and mice [1]; S. salmonicida, for example, is a problem for the fish industry
[3,4]. However, essentially nothing is known about virulence factors in Spironucleus. In healthy fish, the parasite
Spironucleus vortens is commonly found in the flagellated
stage (trophozoites) in the lumen of the upper intestine,
where it remains attached to the intestinal mucosa, controlled by the mucosal immune system of the host. This
stage of infection can cause diarrhea, but villus atrophy,
ulceration or inflammation are thought to be absent [63],
which is similar to observations during G. lamblia infections [62]. Antigenic variation among the identified
cysteine-rich proteins in S. salmonicida could potentially
protect the parasite against secretory antibodies at the
mucosal surfaces. Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen
species (ROS) are important factors in the host's protection against mucosal pathogens [62]. S. salmonicida
encodes at least two rubrerythrins, two A-type flavoproteins and arginine deiminase (Additional file 2). These
proteins, which are coded by genes putatively acquired

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

from prokaryotes via gene transfer (see below), protect
other microbes against ROS and NO [62,64,65], and similar roles are likely in S. salmonicida.
In the laboratory, Spironucleus muris is transmitted as cysts
in fecal material like Giardia [66]. Cysts of the genus Spironucleus share many morphological features with those of
Giardia including the presence of two to four nuclei, flagellar axonemes, and a distinct cyst wall. Cysts of S. muris
even display the same immunostaining as Giardia cysts
when labeled with antibodies specific for Giardia cyst wall
[66]. We identified one homolog of G. lamblia cyst wall
proteins, and two enzymes involved in the production of
the sugar components of the cyst wall (glucosamine-6phosphate isomerase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
pyrophosphorylase – Additional file 2). The presence of
these three genes indicate that S. salmonicida may also be
able to form cysts, an interesting possibility since nothing
yet is known of how S. salmonicida is spread and how it
initiates infection in fish. These genes are stage-specifically
expressed in the G. lamblia life cycle, suggesting that studies of their expression might identify regulatory regions of
stage-specific genes in Spironucleus. Characteristic features
of Giardia cysts include fragments of the adhesive disk but
this structure, involved in attachment of Giardia, is conspicuously absent from Spironucleus cells. None of the
genes encoding disc-specific proteins in G. lamblia were
identified in this genomic survey, consistent with the
absence of this structure in S. salmonicida.
In contrast to G. lamblia, trophozoites of S. salmonicida can
enter the blood causing systemic and organ infections
[67]. Cysteine proteases are essential for pathogenicity
and invasion of the intestine of E. histolytica [68]. Therefore the several cysteine proteases that were found in our
genomic survey are potential virulence factors possibly
involved in invasion/tissue destruction by S. salmonicida.
Secretion of cysteine proteases was indeed recently shown
to occur from trophozoites of G. lamblia upon interaction
with epithelial cells [69]. Cysteine protease activities are
also important for excystation and encystation of Giardia
[70,71], suggesting yet another potential role for these
enzymes
in
S.
salmonicida.
Distinct codon usage patterns in highly versus weakly
expressed genes
Genome-wide mutational processes have been identified
as the main determinant for codon-usage variations
among genomes in all three domains of life, while variations within genomes may be explained by selection
[72,73]. We analyzed sequences of 1153 genes to examine
the variations of codon usage in the S. salmonicida genome
(Table 2). The random sequencing of ESTs from a nonnormalized cDNA library provided a rough estimate of
the expression levels of S. salmonicida genes, since the

Structural organization of the two identified full-length candidate surface proteins with cysteine rich segments
Structural organization of the two identified full-length candidate surface proteins with cysteine rich segments. A: Domain organization of the putative protein encoded by Sp10orf2 (573 residues) [GenBank:DQ812527]. The diagram shows the position of the seven furin-like domains (SM00261 – orange boxes) relative the transmembrane domain (blue
box) as determined by SMART4.0 [125]. Several variations were inferred by SMART including some where furin-like domains
corresponded to the related EGF-like domain (SM00181 – green boxes, see below). Due to the overlap between these inferences only the furin-like domains are shown for simplicity. The orientation of the protein in the membrane is N-terminus outside and C-terminus inside as inferred by TMHMM2.0 [126]. This is consistent with the hypothesis that cysteine-rich domains
are facing the extracellular milieu where they could interact with other proteins. The alignment of the seven inferred furin-like
domains as inferred by T-COFFEE [127] is shown below the diagram, with the positions of the first and last residue of each
domain indicated on the left. Cysteines are highlighted in red and bold. No putative signal peptide was found with SignalP3.0
[128]. B: Domain organization of the putative protein encoded by Sp1orf4 (453 residues) [GenBank:DQ812518]. This protein
has a similar structural organization as the one shown in A with three EGF-like domains inferred to face the external milieu.
The three EGF-like domains were aligned manually. In addition, this sequence may have a signal peptide (indicated by a red
box) since the S-score is positive in SignalP3.0 [128]. C: Domain organization of G. lamblia VSP417-6 protein (704 residues)
[GenBank:AAF02907] [129] is shown for comparison. Four furin-like and two EGF-like domains identified by SMART4.0 [125]
were aligned with T-COFFEE [127]. The G. lamblia sequence possesses a signal peptide according to SignalP3.0 [128]. All diagrams are drawn to scale.

number of occurrences of a specific gene among the sampled clones should be correlated with the amount of
mRNA in the cells that the cDNA library were created

from. Analysis of the genes represented by more than ten
EST clones ("highly expressed") showed a strong codonusage bias where one or two codons dominate for each

amino acid, while some codons are very rare (Table 2). A
distinct pattern was found for genes never found in the
EST library ("weakly expressed"), for which codon usage
is more uniform, with no codons strongly dominating. To
compare our results with a previous study from Giardia
[74], 438 G. lamblia homologs to the S. salmonicida genes
included in the codon-usage analysis were extracted. In
the absence of information on expression levels, the G.
lamblia genes were categorized according to the number of
ESTs for their S. salmonicida homologs. The analysis
revealed a pattern very similar to the previous study on a
much smaller dataset [74]: codons ending with C or G
dominate over codons ending with A or U in putatively
highly expressed genes, while the putatively weakly
expressed genes have a more uniform amino acid usage.
Selection on codon usage in highly expressed S.
salmonicida genes
To investigate the codon usage in more detail, we plotted
the effective number of codons calculated with a method
that accounts for variations in the nucleotide composition
(Nc') [75] against the G+C content in the third synonymous position (GC3s), and performed correspondence
analyses on the relative synonymous codon usage, for
both the Spironuclues and Giardia datasets (Figure 4). The
highly expressed S. salmonicida genes are centered in the
plot with GC3s values around 0.4, and show lower Nc' values than the weakly expressed genes with similar GC3s values, indicative of non-random synonymous codon usage
(Figure 4A). For G. lamblia, the putatively highly expressed
genes exhibit slightly higher GC3s and lower Nc' values
than the majority of the genes (Figure 4B). However, a
separation of the genes into different categories can be
observed: the vast majority of the weakly expressed genes
have GC3s values between 0.4 and 0.7, while the highly
expressed genes have slightly higher values (Figure 4B).
Correspondence analyses showed that the G+C content in
the third synonymous position is the main determinant of
the codon usage in both S. salmonicida and G. lamblia;
GC3s showed a strong correlation with the first axis (R2 =
0.969 and 0.944, respectively: data not shown). Expression levels strongly influence the second axis in the correspondence analysis for S. salmonicida; the highly expressed
genes are located at the top separated from the majority of
the weakly expressed genes, when axis 2 is plotted against
axis 1 (Figure 4C). No such trend is observed for G. lamblia, for which the putative expression levels seem mainly
to be correlated with axis 1 (GC3s) (Figure 4D). These
analyses clearly indicate that there is selection on codon
usage in S. salmonicida genes classified as putatively highly
expressed, and suggest that their G. lamblia homologs also
are under selection (Figure 4 and Table 2). Translation
efficiency has previously been suggested as the cause of
the selection in highly expressed genes in G. lamblia, based
on a much smaller data set [74], even though only esti-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

mates of expression levels were available for a few of the
genes. Our study provides, for a much larger dataset, a
connection between the subset of genes with a strong
codon bias, and an indirect indication of expression levels
(cDNA abundance), corroborating the earlier conclusion
and extending it to the distantly related diplomonad S.
salmonicida.
A shift in codon usage within diplomonads
Interestingly, the favored codons differed between S. salmonicida and G. lamblia for ten amino acids, while the
same codon is most abundant for eight (two amino acids
are encoded by only a single codon) (Table 2). In nine of
the cases where there is a difference between the two species, S. salmonicida preferentially uses a codon ending with
U, while G. lamblia uses a C-ending codon in eight cases
and a G-ending codon once. The tenth case is a two-fold
degenerate amino acid where S. salmonicida and G. lamblia
prefer A- and C-ending codons, respectively (Table 2).
Thus, in general S. salmonicida favors A+U rich codons,
while G. lamblia prefers codons with G or C in the third
position in putatively highly expressed genes. There is a
distinction between the base compositional biases in G.
lamblia and S. salmonicida; the average G+C content of the
S. salmonicida sequences in our dataset is 36%, and the
majority of the weakly expressed genes have GC3s values
around 20%, while the weakly expressed G. lamblia genes
have GC3s around 50% close to the genomic G+C content
of G. lamblia [60] (Figure 4A, B). This is an expected pattern if mainly mutational processes have shaped the
codon usage [72,73]. However, the genomic G+C content
differences seem to have influenced the codon preferences
in the two diplomonad lineages in the highly expressed
genes as well. In the absence of information about codon
usage in a closely related outgroup, it is difficult to determine in which of the two lineages reassignment of the
optimal codons has occurred. At any rate, the usage of an
alternative genetic code in Spironucleus but not Giardia
[26] indicates that codon usage have been remodeled in
the lineage leading to Spironucleus, at least for the stop and
glutamine codons. The canonical stop codon UAA is
indeed the most common codon for glutamine in our
dataset (Table 2), as expected in a G+C poor genome if the
codon usage is close to mutational equilibrium [72,73].
Unusual codon usage in a subset of S. salmonicida genes
We observed large variation among GC3s values for
weakly expressed genes in S. salmonicida. Unexpectedly,
the Nc' values for genes with GC3s above 0.5 are negatively
correlated with GC3s (Figure 4A); if only the background
nucleotide composition shaped the codon usage for these
genes, the Nc' values should be close to the maximum.
This pattern indicates that there is selection on the codon
usage in the group of weakly expressed genes with high
GC3s values. However, selection for the set of optimal

Comparisons of codon usage in S. salmonicida and G. lamblia
Comparisons of codon usage in S. salmonicida and G. lamblia. A and B: The effective number of codons, Nc', plotted
against the synonymous G+C content in the third codon position (GC3s) of 1153 S. salmonicida genes (A) and 438 homologs in
G. lamblia (B). Genes are represented by different colors and symbols according to the number of times they were sampled
within the EST data. Genes identified to be involved in gene transfer and are shared with G. lamblia (LGT Diplo), or unique to
S. salmonicida (LGT Spiro), are indicated by black and red squares, respectively (see Additional file 3). If the observed codon
usage pattern is more uniform than expected by chance, the Nc' value is set to 61 [75, 117]. C and D: Correspondence analysis
of the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values for the same genes as in A and B for S. salmonicida (C) and G. lamblia
(D). The candidate LGTs unique to S. salmonicida, and shared with G. lamblia, are indicated by red and black open squares,
respectively.

codons for highly expressed genes does not explain this
pattern, as they include both G+C rich and G+C poor
codons (Table 2). Also, the large spread of the genes to the
left on axis 1 (which is strongly correlated with GC3s –
Figure 4C) argues against selection for an alternative set
of optimal codons in these genes. Furthermore, the deviating GC3s values in these genes are probably not due to

recent introductions into the S. salmonicida genome from
heterogeneous sources by lateral gene transfer (LGT).
Although some genes with high GC3s values do show
indications of gene transfer in the phylogenomic analyses,
the majority do not (Figure 4A, C). In fact, many of these
genes have homologs in Giardia, indicating that they were
present in the common ancestor of the two lineages,

strongly suggesting that the deviated GC3s and Nc' values
arose during the evolution of diplomonads on the branch
leading to S. salmonicida.
Analyses of the finished contigs also yielded unexpected
results; the base compositional bias in segments of the S.
salmonicida genome seems to be markedly towards G+C,
while the largest part of the genome shows a compositional bias towards A+T (Figure 1). This pattern is in contrast with the A+T rich genomes of D. discoideum, E.
histolytica, and Plasmodium falciparum, which show a relatively uniform nucleotide composition across all chromosomal regions [76,77]. The genes with deviating G+C
content are correlated with these genomic regions of high
G+C content (Figure 1). Furthermore, genes in G+C rich
regions have higher GC3s values than the average G+C
content for the genes (their bars are located above the sliding window analysis in Figure 1). Conversely, as expected,
genes in G+C poor regions have low GC3s values. Thus,
genes with unexpected codon usage (i.e. high GC3s values) are located in specific regions of the genome. However, neither mutational or selection scenarios can easily
explain their non-random codon usage, nor the fluctuations in G+C content along the genome. Heterogeneity in
overall G+C content (and/or GC3s) across the genome
has been also observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [78] and
in vertebrate genomes (e.g. isochores) [79]. For S. cerevisiae (a unicellular eukaryote with a compact genome, that
is more directly comparable to S. salmonicida than vertebrates) a number of possible explanations have been
advanced such as regional variation in propensities for
mutation or recombination and partitioning of the
genome into "distinct replicational and transcriptional
domains" during specific cell cycle phases that may experience different chemical environments [see [78] and references therein]. Longer genomic fragments, as well as
comparative data from more-closely related diplomonads, will be needed to characterize the pattern further in S.
salmonicida and to tease apart possible causes for this
peculiar phenomenon.
Phylogenomic analysis reveals frequent lateral gene
transfer
We and others have previously studied the occurrence of
LGT in diplomonads on a single-gene basis [16,17,29-31],
[80-82]. Here we present a systematic phylogenomic analysis of the complete EST and GSS data sets with the goal
of identifying S. salmonicida genes that have been involved
in LGT. We used the PhyloGenie package [83] to assemble
aligned amino acid data sets automatically from databases
including both published sequences and data from ongoing eukaryotic genome projects (see Methods). Among
the 711 genes with three or more identified homologs for
which more than 100 amino acid positions could be
aligned, 84 were retained as genes putatively involved in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

LGT affecting the S. salmonicida lineage, on the basis of
unexpected phylogenetic positions (Figure 5, Additional
files 3, 4, 5, 6). Cases where two S. salmonicida genes
branched as a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic
tree to the exclusion of other sequence were interpreted as
gene duplication event after the gene transfer. Taking this
into account, the 84 genes putatively involved in LGT corresponded to 68 unique gene transfer events at most; multiple genes may indeed have been introduced in a single
event in some cases.
In principle, contamination in our libraries could falsely
indicate a pattern of frequent gene transfer affecting the S.
salmonicida genome. However, we strongly believe this
not to be case. 57 of the 84 putatively transferred genes
formed a monophyletic group with G. lamblia homologs
in the phylogenetic analyses indicating that these genes
were present in the common ancestor of the two species
(Additional Files 3, 4, 5, 6). Furthermore, on average five
in-frame UAG and UAA sense codons (which are termination codons in all characterized prokaryotes [84]) were
detected in 21 of the remaining 27 putatively transferred
genes, strongly suggesting a true S. salmonicida origin also
for these genes. Four of the six genes without UAG or UAA
codons formed a monophyletic group with a S. salmonicida gene which does utilize such codons, indicating a
likely origin by gene duplication. We cannot formally
exclude contamination on the basis of presence of alternative codons for the remaining two sequences
(gTor1213bT7 and gZap260bT7, trees #59 and #64 in
Additional file 6), but notice that the absence of in-frame
UAG and UAA codons in these genes could likely be due
to a recent introduction from a donor utilizing the canonical genetic code. At any rate, together these observations
indicate that the phylogenetic pattern we interpret as
putative LGT events are unlikely to result from substantial
contamination of our libraries.
The strength and type of support for the inferred gene
transfer events varied between genes in the phylogenomic
analysis. Some Spironucleus genes were strongly associated
with genes from distantly related organisms. For example,
the S. salmonicida carotenoid isomerases were found to be
nested within proteobacterial sequences (Figure 5D).
Such anomalous positions of the diplomonads genes
strongly suggest gene transfer events. Many datasets contain sequences from only one or a few eukaryotic taxa
other than diplomonads (Figure 5A, C, E), and in some,
diplomonads are the only eukaryotes present (Figure 5B–
D). Although the separation of diplomonad from the
other eukaryotic sequences is sometimes weak (i.e. Figure
5E), we suggest that LGT is a more likely explanation for
their origin than differential gene losses and/or phylogenetic artefacts, as we have argued previously for genes with

a patchy phylogenetic distribution among eukaryotes
[80].
There are indeed examples of inferences of LGT based on
unexpected patterns of phyletic distribution that have previously been shown to be wrong. Re-analyses of the putative bacteria-to-vertebrate gene transfer events in the
human genome using phylogenetic analyses instead of
similarity searches showed that more parsimonious alternative explanations existed for the vast majority, if not all,
of the reported cases [85]. Phylogenetic analyses may also
lead to false positive interpretations of LGT. For example,
phylogenetic analysis indicated an LGT origin of the T.
vaginalis hydrogenosomal NuoF protein distinct from the
mitochondrial homologs [86], a conclusion shown likely
to be incorrect upon re-analysis using more realistic models of sequence evolution [87]. On the other hand, reanalyses using extended taxon sampling and more
advanced models of sequence evolution of four genes
putatively affected by prokaryote-to-protist LGT resulted
in support for a larger number of inter-domain gene transfer events, rather than a fewer number as expected if differential gene loss, and/or phylogenetic artefacts caused
the initial indications of gene transfer [30,80]. Obviously,
inferences about LGT from the phylogenetic analyses
depend on the accuracy of the phylogenetic method, as
well as on the breadth of organismal representation in
sequence databases. Therefore, it is inevitable that the list
of putative LGTs will include both false positives and false
negatives (Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6). Nevertheless, our
phylogenomic analysis indicates that vertical inheritance
combined with gene duplication and gene loss is rather
unlikely to have produced the observed phylogenetic relationships and patchy taxonomic distributions and that
gene transfer is the simplest hypothesis currently available
to explain these trees. Hence our analyses indicate that
LGT has been an important mechanism in the evolution
of the S. salmonicida genome.
Acquisitions of prokaryotic metabolic genes in the
evolution of protist genomes
The vast majority of genes inferred to be involved in genetransfer events are metabolic genes (74%) or encode conserved hypothetical proteins (20%) (Additional file 3).
This bias is not unexpected, as a higher rate of transfer for
metabolic genes compared to informational genes has
been observed for prokaryotes [88,89] and, on a smaller
scale, in diplomonads [30] and E. histolytica [51]. In the
latter study it was suggested that this protist parasite had
expanded its metabolic repertoire via gene acquisitions
from prokaryotes present in the environment, and the
same may apply for S. salmonicida. For example, amino
acids have been identified to be a source of energy in
diplomonads via the arginine dihydrolase pathway [2]
especially under limited oxygen conditions [90]. Among

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

eukaryotes, this pathway has been detected only in Trichomonas and diplomonads. The genes for two enzymes in
the pathway, arginine deiminase and ornithine transcarbamoylase, appear to have been acquired from prokaryotes in a common ancestor of diplomonads and
parabasalids, whereas carbamate kinase may have distinct
LGT origins in the two groups (Figure 5A and trees #10
and #30 in Additional file 4). Similarly, S. salmonicida
encodes rubrerythrins and A-type flavoproteins, proteins
putatively involved in the protection against the host's
defense (see above) [62,64,65] that are also found in
anaerobic prokaryotes and eukaryotes including Entamoeba (Figure 5E and Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6) [51,80].
The phylogenetic distributions of these genes suggest a
role related to an anaerobic lifestyle, consistent with the
hypothesis that these acquisitions provided metabolic
advantages to the recipient protist lineages. Indeed, distantly related lineages that live in the same environment
appear to frequently transfer genes [89]. Increased taxon
sampling and more detailed studies of the ecology and
metabolism/biochemistry of the organisms represented
by sequences in our trees will likely recognize shared environments between the donor and recipient lineages for
additional acquired metabolic genes (Additional file 3).
Continuous exchange of genes with all domains of life
In this study we have identified 84 genes of putatively lateral origin, and in previous phylogenomic studies 96 E.
histoytica genes, almost 50 kinetoplastid genes, 24 in
Cryptosporidium parvum and 148 genes in anaerobic ciliates were found to represent candidate LGT genes
[51,55,91,92]. Thus, numerous inter-domain gene transfer events have been identified in four divergent protist
lineages – Spironucleus, Entamoeba, kinetoplastids
(Trypanosoma and Leishmania) and anaerobic ciliates –
supporting the idea that gene acquisition from prokaryotic organisms is a common evolutionary mechanism in
unicellular eukaryotes [22,93-95]. In all these studies,
metabolic genes have been found to be the most common
functional category among the genes implicated in LGT
genes. This observation, which is consistent with the complexity hypothesis [88], could indicate that metabolic
adaptation is a selective force for inter-domain gene transfer events from prokaryotes to protists [96,97].

G. lamblia homologs that form clades with the S. salmonicida sequences were found in 49 of the 68 putative LGT
events, while no closely related G. lamblia homologs were
found in the remaining 19 cases (Figure 5 and Additional
file 3). Thus, at least 72% of the putative LGT events happened before the divergence of the Spironucleus and Giardia lineages. The remaining 19 events could have taken
place in the S. salmonicida lineage after the divergence
from the lineage leading to G. lamblia, although gene
losses in the latter could also explain the observed pattern.

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:51

If these represented relatively recent gene transfers, they
should show a codon-usage pattern distinct from that of
other S. salmonicida genes. Some in fact do show deviant
codon usage indices (Figure 5A, B) suggesting a more
recent acquisition compared to the other cases. However,
there are many other S. salmonicida genes with deviant
codon usage that do not show any indication of LGT (Figure 4A, B), suggesting that codon usage pattern alone is a
poor indicator of LGT in S. salmonicida, as shown in other
systems [98]. In 12 cases where both Spironucleus and Giardia sequences are present, T. vaginalis sequences are
found as a sister group to the diplomonad cluster. This
pattern has previously been observed for candidate laterally transferred genes [16,17,80] and almost certainly
reflects a common ancestry of diplomonads and parabasalids to the exclusion of other sampled eukaryotic lineages, although the possibility of gene transfer between the
two lineages cannot be formally excluded. However, a
diplomonad-parabasalia relationship has recently been
shown to be robust in several phylogenetic analyses of
concatenated protein sequences [13-15]. As some
acquired genes are unique to S. salmonicida, others shared
with G. lamblia, and some are also shared with T. vaginalis,
this strongly suggests that genes have been acquired by
LGT in these excavate lineages continuously throughout
their evolutionary history. Further characterization of the
phylogenetic distribution of these genes may provide
information about organismal relationships within Excavata [99].
In the four previous phylogenomic studies of LGT in protists [51,55,91,92] only prokaryote-to-eukaryote transfer
events were examined. Our selection procedure allowed
us to detect additional evolutionary scenarios where a
prokaryotic gene is transferred to a eukaryote, and then
possibly further transferred to a second eukaryotic lineage.
For example, the arginine deaminase gene was likely
acquired from a prokaryote by an ancestor of diplomonads and parabasalids, and then transferred to the lineage
leading to Dictyostelium (Figure 5A). Seventeen genes were
putatively affected by intra-domain LGT, corresponding
to 13 unique events (Additional file 3). Twelve of these
cases are exchanges between the lineage leading to S. salmonicida and amoebozoan lineages; five cases involve
gene exchange with the Dictyostelium lineage, six cases
with the Entamoeba lineage, and a single case with the
Mastigamoeba lineage (Figure 5A, Additional files 3, 4, 5,
6). In sharp contrast, only a single intra-domain gene
transfer event representing other eukaryotes was detected,
although opisthokonts are comparatively well sampled
with genome sequences, and several diverse and complete, or nearly complete, chromalveolate sequences were
present in our data sets (Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6). It is
noteworthy that only genes that have been acquired from
prokaryotes and have subsequently been transferred

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

within the eukaryotic domain will be detected using our
selection procedure. Additional eukaryote-to-eukaryote
transfers may actually have occurred among the genes that
did not show any indication of prokaryote-to-eukaryote
transfer. A few examples of gene transfers between unicellular eukaryotic organisms have indeed been published
recently [22,80,100,101]. The 13 putative intra-domain
transfers identified here further suggest that LGT between
protists is an evolutionary mechanism that should not be
neglected.

Conclusion
The vast majority of eukaryotic diversity is represented by
protists [18], yet only a few protist genome sequencing
projects have been published. Our sequence survey study
has indicated that a combined approach using both random sampling from the genome (GSSs) and ESTs is successful in identifying genes (Table 1). We identified 817
genes from the GSS sequences, while 473 genes with
homologies in other organisms were detected among the
EST sequences. As we have collected more than twice as
many GSS as EST sequences, EST sequencing would
appear to be slightly more effective for gene discovery, if
only quantity is considered, as expected. However, EST
sequencing is biased towards identification of highly
expressed genes, such as genes involved in genetic information processing, especially translation, while GSS
sequencing detects a more random selection of genes
(Table 1). This functional bias of the genes detected in EST
surveys may be an advantage if the objective of the study
is mainly to identify genes previously identified in other
organisms using the same approach, but is a limitation if
sampling gene diversity is the aim.
We found that a combined approach of both GSS and EST
sequencing can be successful in detecting both highly
expressed (and probably also often widely distributed)
genes and a more diverse gene set. In combination with
complete sequencing of a few contigs, this approach was
efficient in revealing much about the S. salmonicida
genome. Although we could identify more than 600 genes
with annotated functions, conserved hypothetical proteins still represent the largest category (Table 1), indicating that the genes with annotated functions give only a
partial picture of the true coding potential. Furthermore,
13 among the 38 genes identified within the contigs did
not show any significant sequence similarity to genes in
the databases, and 81% and 45% of the GSS and EST
sequences, respectively, failed to show significant similarity to any known genes. This suggests that a large fraction
of the genes in S. salmonicida genome lack sequence similarity to known genes, despite the fact that a nearly complete G. lamblia gene complement is included in the
public database. Thus, the S. salmonicida genome has a significant, and mostly unknown, coding potential. Still, the

analyses of the genes that could be annotated not only
identified individual S. salmonicida genes and metabolic
pathways that provided insight into the biology and evolution of the organism. In addition, these analyses
revealed several lineage-specific properties suggestive of a
large genomic diversity between S. salmonicida and other
studied eukaryotes, including its closest intensively studied relative, the diplomonad G. lamblia.
Our analyses indeed indicate that diplomonad genomes
are diverse. For example, in the S. salmonicida genome we
identified gene acquisitions, a base compositional bias
that varies along the genome, a codon usage distinct from
that of G. lamblia, and differences in basic molecular biological processes such as polyadenylation. G. lamblia and
S. salmonicida represent only two species within diplomonads, a paraphyletic group which may also include
enteromonads and retortamonads, organisms with distinct morphological features [23,24,102]. The understanding of these interesting groups of protists is very
limited on the genomic level, and the genome projects of
G. lamblia [103] and Spironucleus vortens [104], another
fish pathogen, will make major contributions. Still, diplomonads are very diverse, as manifested by a large degree
of sequence divergence between members of the group,
and, as indicated here, large variation in the genomic
structure and content. Circumstantial evidence for a relatively small genome (see above), together with an overall
G+C content of 36% and a low frequency of repeats,
makes S. salmonicida an ideal candidate for a wholegenome sequencing project. Such an effort would yield
further insights into the parasitic lifestyle of this organism,
the fascinatingly diverse biology of diplomonads, and
expand our appreciation of genome diversity and evolution among eukaryotes.

Methods
Sources of RNA and DNA, library construction, and
sequencing
S. salmonicida (ATCC 50380) [6] (previously known as S.
barkhanus [5,105]) was grown in axenic culture following
the ATCC protocol. Messenger RNA from approximately
108 cells of S. salmonicida was isolated using the Dynabead
mRNA system (Dynal), and cDNA was synthesized and
cloned into the lambda Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. This procedure requires that the polyA tail is present in the mRNA to
be cloned. Infection of SolR cells was carried out and
plated on selective LB media containing carbenicillin, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (Xgal) for blue/white selection. Positive colonies were
picked manually and plasmid DNA was purified using
Perfectprep Plasmid Isolation Kit with the Perfectprep
Plasmid 96 Vac system (Eppendorf). The DNA was quan-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

tified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Sequencing
was carried out on an ABI 377 (Applied Biosystems) using
the ABI Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) and the SK primer.
Genomic DNA was purified using standard protocols. A
genomic DNA library was constructed for GSS sequencing. The DNA was partially digested using Sau3AI and
ligated to lambda Zap Express vector pre-digested with
BamHI (Stratagene) according to the instructions. Mass in
vivo excision of the pBK-CMV phagemid from the Zap
Express vector was performed using XL-1 Blue MRF' cells
and ExAssist phage with the XLOLR strain, and the cells
were plated on LB with kanamycin, IPTG and X-gal for
blue/white selection. Cells were picked and the plasmids
were purified and sequenced as described above using the
T3 and T7 primers. Roughly half of the sequencing was
done from this library. However, since it was revealed that
the insert sizes of this library were too short for efficient
random sequencing, a second GSS library was constructed
using 20 μg genomic DNA. The DNA was physically
sheared using a nebulizer, blunt ended, ligated to the
insert DNA and cloned into plasmid vectors using the
TOPO Shotgun Subcloning Kit (Invitrogen). One Shot
chemically competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed
with an aliquot of the ligation mix and spread on LB
plates containing kanamycin and X-gal for blue/white
selection. Positive clones were manually picked and plasmids were purified using 96-well Plasmid Preparation Kit
(Millipore). The plasmids were quantified and sequenced
as described above using T3 and T7 primers.
Finally, S. salmonicida DNA was partially digested with
BamHI and cloned into the lambda DASHII vector (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, to
make a library with larger inserts (8–28 kbp). The library
was grown in MRA cells and spread on eight 150-mm
plates each containing approximately 70,000 plaques.
Three plaques were purified and the inserts were amplified by PCR, nebulized and the fragments were shotgun
cloned into puc18 SmaI/BPA plasmids (Amersham Pharmacia). The ligations were transformed into XL2-Blue
MRF' ultracompetent cells. Plasmids were purified and
sequenced as described above using M13f and M13r primers.
Sequence analysis
Sequencing reactions were initially screened manually for
exclusion of unsuccessful reactions. Sequences from 2408,
3204 and 3684 clones from the Uni-Zap XR EST, the Zap
Express GSS and TOPO Shotgun Subcloning GSS libraries,
respectively, passed this initial screen. The average read
lengths of these were 540, 399 and 366 bp, respectively.

The 2408 EST sequences were screened against the vector
sequences and the Escherichia coli genome sequence using
the Phred software [106] to check for contamination of
DNA from the library host, and clustered using the Phrap
assembler [106] with the default settings. The contigs were
quality trimmed manually, while the singletons were
trimmed using the Phred software [106] with the default
quality cut-off. Hybrid clones were identified as containing stretches of nine or more As within the insert, and only
the 5' end of the hybrid was retained. 27 clones with
inserts in the opposite direction were identified as starting
with a stretch of Ts (15), or as having significant matches
in the wrong direction to known genes (12); these were
reversed. Finally, nine EST sequences were trimmed
according to putative frame-shifts detected in similarity
searches. After removal of contigs shorter than 100 bases
884 sequences (298 contigs and 586 singletons) corresponding to 502589 unique bp and based on 2341 clones
remained for further analysis. 20 and 11 of these overlapped with published genes or genes from the finished
contigs (see below), respectively, and were excluded, leaving 853 ESTs for further analyses.
300 ESTs ended with a stretch of eight or more As, indicative of mRNA polyadenylation, were identified. Of these,
134 were annotated as coding based on sequence similarity to genes in the databases (see below). The region
around the 3' end of the gene was aligned based on the
position of the termination codons (UGA), and a
sequence logo was created using WebLogo [107].
The 6888 GSS sequences were trimmed using the Phred
software [106] with the default quality cut-off, and the
vector sequences were masked and removed. All
sequences were screened against the E. coli genome
sequence. The 5275 GSS chromatograms that passed this
screen (no host contamination was detected), and represented sequences longer than 100 bp, were included in
the assembly. The average read lengths of the clones from
the Zap Express GSS and TOPO Shotgun Subcloning GSS
libraries that passed this screening were 543 and 472 bp,
respectively. The Phrap assembler was used with the
default settings, yielding 1008 contigs consisting of two or
more sequences and 2208 singletons. Some of the longer
contigs were selected for complete sequencing. Regions
that required additional sequencing were identified
within these contigs, and amplified from genomic DNA
using PCR with primers designed based on the GSS assembled sequence. The PCR was performed under standard
conditions using the following parameters: denaturing at
95°C for 5 min, followed by forty cycles of denaturing at
94°C for 30 s, annealing at 48°C for 1 min, and extension
at 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10
min. To extend the contigs, sequence gaps covered by
clones were identified and amplified using PCR with spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

cific primers based on the obtained shotgun sequences.
The PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using the PCR
primers as described above. This procedure resulted in
eight continuous stretches of genomic sequence between
2365 and 9005 bp in length. Together with the three
sequenced lambda clones these yielded 80504 bp of finished genomic sequence in eleven contigs which were covered by at least one-fold high quality sequence in each
direction (Additional file 1). 205 of the 5275 GSS
sequences overlapped with the completely sequence contigs and were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 5070 sequences were treated as single reads, and
covered 2539160 bp of non-unique sequence after quality
trimming.
To estimate the amount of unique high-quality sequence
within our survey project, we performed assemblies with
only the quality trimmed sequence using the Staden package [108]. The 5275 GSS clones yielded 2070953 bp in
3566 contigs with one or more sequences, and the addition of the EST clones gave 2549915 bp of unique highquality sequence. Lander and Waterman proposed that
the number of "islands" (E) in a genomic project with perfectly representative libraries with equal length of clones
(sequences) is E = Ne-cσ [109], where N is the number of
clones sampled, c is the redundancy of coverage = LN/G,
σ = 1 - T/L, L is the clone length (500.8 bp in our case), G
is the haploid genome size in bp, and T is the amount of
overlap in bp needed to detect overlap (20 bp). G is the
only unknown parameter, and the equation can be
solved: G = N(L-T)/ln(N/E). Using the information from
our assembly (N = 5275; L = 500.8 bp; T = 20 bp; E =
3566), the genome of S. salmonicida was estimated to be
6.5 Mbp in size.
Databases
All databases used in the analyses were downloaded in
January 2005. In addition to the non-redundant protein
database downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [110], protein databases
from various nearly completed genome sequencing
projects of diverse eukaryotes were downloaded: T. vaginalis (parabasalid), Tetrahymena thermophila (ciliate),
Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi (kinetoplastids)
from the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) [111];
Dictyostelium discoideum (mycetozoan) from dictyBase
[112]; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green alga), Phytophthora sojae (oomycete), and Thalassiosira pseudonana (diatom) from the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [104].
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
databases were downloaded from the Kyoto University
Bioinformatics Center [113] for functional annotation
purposes.

Gene identification
Various approaches were used to identify coding genes
among the sequences. Similarity searches using BLASTx,
version 2.2.13 [114], with the default settings with the
nucleotide sequences from the single-read GSS and the
EST contigs against the amino acid sequence databases
were performed. 1179 single-read GSS sequences and 502
EST contigs yielded matches with E values better than e-5,
which were considered a significant indication of a coding
sequence. Using the indication of the frame and direction
from the alignment between the query and database
sequence in the BLAST result files, the putative coding
DNA and amino acid sequences were extracted from these
sequences. The 3891 single-read GSS sequences and 380
EST contigs that failed to yield a match better than e-5 were
not analyzed further.

To identify coding sequences in the finished contigs, similarity searches against the amino acid sequence databases
and the EST sequences were performed using the same
cutoff as above. Similarity searches on the nucleotide level
against the non-redundant nucleotide databases were performed at NCBI to identify non-protein coding sequences.
Finally, open reading frames longer than 450 bp with the
expected GC pattern in the three coding positions were
annotated as putatively coding and included in subsequent analyses. This procedure identified 38 protein-coding genes in the eleven finished contigs.
tRNA genes were detected using two programs: tRNAscanSE version 1.23 [115] with the maximum sensitivity (C option), and ARAGORN version 1.1 [116] with the
default parameters. 20 tRNA genes were identified with
both methods, all within GSS clones. For 19 of these, both
programs assigned the same anticodon, while one differed in anticodon identity (see Results). Two tRNAs were
found to encode putative introns. No tmRNA was found.
Finally, similarity searches at the nucleotide level identified two genes encoding ribosomal RNA within one of the
finished contigs.
Creation of a non-redundant dataset of S. salmonicida
protein-coding genes
In order to explore the coding potential of S. salmonicida,
we created a non-redundant dataset of S. salmonicida
genes that contained only the longest amino acid
sequence from each gene among the GSS, EST, finished
contigs and previously published genes. Three of the 30
previously published genes were represented by long ESTs
and were excluded. This procedure resulted in538 unique
protein-coding genes. 175 of the 1179 genes identified
within the GSSs were excluded because they were represented by longer ESTs or published sequences, while 30
were excluded because the extracted ORF was shorter than
100 bp. Furthermore, 176 of the remaining 974 genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

identified within GSS sequences were excluded because
they overlapped with a longer identical gene within the
GSSs, leaving 798 unique protein coding genes identified
within the GSS data. Thus, in total 1335 unique proteincoding genes were identified and included in further analyses.
Codon-usage analysis
1153 of the 1335 unique protein-coding sequences were
300 bp or longer and were included in the codon-usage
analysis. Codon-usage indices were calculated for each
gene. Nc is a measure of the effective number of codons
used in a gene [117]. A modified version, Nc', has been
developed which also account for the background nucleotide composition of the gene; this is advantageous in situations where the composition varies among the genes
analyzed [75]. The Nc' values were calculated using the
software INCA [118]. The GC3s values – the frequency of
G+C in synonymously third codon positions (i.e. Met, Trp
and termination codons are excluded) – were calculated
using the program CodonW [119]. The variation of codon
usage among genes was explored using the correspondence analysis tool within CodonW. To avoid identification of trends in codon usage due to biased amino acid
usage among the genes, the correspondence analysis was
performed on the relative synonymous codon usage
(RSCU) values for each gene. The RSCU value for a codon
is the observed frequency divided by the frequency
expected if all synonyms codons for that amino acid were
used equally. This should remove the effects of amino
acid composition on codon usage. RSCU values close to 1
indicate a lack of bias, while much higher and much lower
values indicate preference and avoidance of that particular
codon, respectively. The correspondence analysis plots
genes according to their RSCU values in a 61-dimensional
space, and then identifies the major trends as the axes
through this multidimensional hyperspace which account
for the largest fractions of variation among genes.

To examine the variation of codon usage within diplomonads, similarity searches of the 1153 S. salmonicida
amino acid sequences were performed against the G. lamblia protein sequences. 533 S. salmonicida genes gave
matches with E values < e-20, corresponding to 438 unique
genes. These were considered homologs (not necessarily
orthologs) and the nucleotide sequences were obtained
for codon-usage analysis as described above.
The number of times each gene was detected in the EST
library was used as an indication of expression level in the
cell. 35 genes were represented by more than ten individual EST sequences and were considered highly expressed,
while 682 genes were not detected in the EST data and
were considered weakly expressed. Codon-usage tables
were calculated for each of these groups, both for S. salmo-

nicida and the G. lamblia homologs. G. lamblia genes represented by several S. salmonicida genes were assigned the
highest number of ESTs among the genes.
Gene annotation
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
project [113], a bioinformatic knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions [120], was used for gene
annotation. The KEGG system links genomic information
with higher-order functional information using a system
with KEGG Orthology (KO) numbers. Gene sequences in
the GENES database, which includes collection of gene
catalogs from completely sequenced genomes, are
assigned KO numbers which are used to extract higherorder information, such as functional categories and pathways, from the KO database [120].

Similarity searches using BLASTx, version 2.2.13 [114],
with the default settings were performed for the 1335
unique S. salmonicida protein-coding genes against the
GENES database, using the E value cutoff e-5. 249 returned
a best match to which a KO -number had been assigned,
and an additional 301 had non-best hits with assigned KO
numbers. Functional annotations were extracted from the
KO database for these 550 genes. However, 27 genes were
annotated in the functional category "Human Disease";
five of these could be manually assigned to functional categories, while 22 were classified as conserved hypothetical
proteins. Thus, 528 genes could be assigned a function
using the KEGG databases. Similarity searches against all
databases were performed for the remaining 785 genes,
using the E value cutoff e-20. 219 of these had matches, 63
of which could be used for functional annotation. No
meaningful functional information could be found for
remaining 156; these were annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins. In addition, the 553 genes which had
best hits with E values between e-20 and e-5 were annotated
as conserved hypothetical proteins, and the remaining 13
genes that did not have any match better than e-5 were
annotated as hypothetical proteins. To summarize: 591
protein-coding genes could be assigned a putative function, 731 were conserved hypothetical proteins, and 13
hypothetical proteins. The annotations for all proteins
mentioned in the text have been refined manually.
The fraction of cysteine within the conceptually translated
amino acid sequences was found to vary considerably
between genes. While the majority of genes would encode
a protein with cysteine content below 5%, 149 of the 1335
unique genes would encode a protein with more than
10% cysteine. These were annotated as cysteine-rich proteins. 122 are conserved hypothetical proteins, while 27
were assigned to functional categories.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/51

A data set of 1044 yeast proteins localized in the mitochondrion [121] was used to search against the identified
S. salmonicida proteins using BLASTp, version 2.2.13
[114], with the default settings. The matches with e values
below e-5 were searched against the total yeast proteome
with the same cutoff, which identified 71 reciprocal best
matches between the datasets. Based on the quality of the
BLASTp hit (or protein length, to short to give any confidence in the identified HSP), phylogenetic trees and functional annotation of BLAST hits, only two entries were
considered as strong candidate mitochondrial/mitosomal
proteins and one as possible candidate proteins (see main
text).
Phylogenomic and phylogenetic analyses
One goal of this project was to identify genes in the S. salmonicida genome that have been affected by LGT. We used
phylogenetic analyses to identify gene transfers, as similarity searches are only poor indicators of such events
[122]. We used the PhyloGenie package [83] to perform
efficient phylogenetic analyses for a large number of
genes. It takes amino acid sequences in standard (fasta)
format, and performs similarity searches (BLAST) against
a protein sequence database consisting of publicly available databases and/or sequence data released from ongoing genome projects. The program uses HMMER [123] to
build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile from the
alignment in the BLAST result file, and uses it to search the
full-length BLAST hits; sequences scoring better than a
selected threshold are included in the dataset. Finally, an
alignment of these sequences is made using the profile.
No attempt was made to exclude putative paralogs from
the datasets.

Cysteine-rich proteins were excluded from the phylogenomic analysis, since they were found to be problematic
to align probably due to their frequent possession of
highly repetitive sequences. PhyloGenie was run on the
1174 annotated non-cysteine-rich genes with homologs
in the databases, using default settings except that coverage of the query sequence compared to the database
sequence was not used as a selection criteria (coverage = 1) since coverage is meaningless with partial gene
sequences such as EST and GSSs, and the maximum
number of sequences in the dataset was set, for practical
reasons, to 200 (seqs = 200). Where more than 200
sequences pass the E-value cutoff, the 200 with the lowest
E-values in the HMM-based search will be retained. A custom-implemented function (T. Frickey, personal communication) was used that allows for exclusion of similar
sequences from the dataset based on the taxonomic level
(i.e. only one sequence is retained as a representative of all
Bacillus sequences above a set identity). To reduce the size
of the dataset as much as possible without losing too
much information, an identity cutoff of 80% was used

Page 20 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:51

regardless of the taxonomic description in the sequence
(taxlevel = 0, maxsim = 0.8).
These settings yielded 932 datasets with four sequences or
more, among which 711 included 100 or more aligned
amino acid positions assessed on the S. salmonicida input
sequence. Only these were analyzed further, to avoid misleading results based on too-short alignments. A Perl
script provided in the PhyloGenie package [83] was modified to use the fast maximum likelihood program PHYML
version 2.4.4 [124]. Trees were obtained for each of the
711 datasets using this script and the default PHYML settings, except that the Whelan and Goldman (WAG) substitution model [124] was used together with a mixed
four-category discrete-gamma model of among-site rate
variation plus invariable sites (WAG + Γ + Inv).
The trees were automatically rooted using the approach
implemented in Phylogenie; taxonomic information for
all sequences in each tree is used to put the root at the
most-basal node that is most-distant from the sequence
that was used to select the dataset [see Figure 4 in [83] for
details]. Phatg, the tree-browsing program within the PhyloGenie package [83], was used to identify 136 putative
cases of LGT among the optimal trees, using the criterion
that a diplomonad sequence was required to group with
homologs from up to four different non-diplomonad
eukaryotes within a prokaryotic clade. Manual inspection
of the positive trees excluded from further analysis 31
trees for which the input S. salmonicida sequence failed to
show convincing indications of LGT, or the G. lamblia
homolog branched with a prokaryotic sequence. Bootstrap analyses were performed for the remaining 105 datasets, using 100 replicates and the methods and settings
described above. Visual inspection of the consensus bootstrap trees yielded 84 that showed indications of LGT
affecting S. salmonicida. Among these, two appear to be
clones derived from different parts of the same S. salmonicida gene, and 14 are part of diplomonad gene clusters
which may have formed via gene duplication events after
a putative transfer event. Thus, our phylogenomic analysis
identified 68 putative LGT events (Additional files 3, 4, 5,
6).
