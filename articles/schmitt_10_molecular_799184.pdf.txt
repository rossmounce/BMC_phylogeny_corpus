Molecular diversity of antimicrobial effectors
in the oyster Crassostrea gigas

Abstract
Background: To gain insight into the molecular diversity of antimicrobial peptides and proteins in the oyster
Crassostrea gigas, we characterized and compared the sequence polymorphism of the antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs), Cg-Defensins (Cg-Defs) and Cg-Proline Rich peptide (Cg-Prp), and of the bactericidal permeability increasing
protein, Cg-BPI. For that, we analyzed genomic and transcript sequences obtained by specific PCR amplification
and in silico searches.
Results: High diversification among the three antimicrobial effectors was evidenced by this polymorphism survey.
On the basis of sequence phylogenies, each AMP aggregates into clearly defined groups of variants and is the
product of a multigenic family displaying a variety of gene structures. In contrast, Cg-bpi forms a single group and
is encoded by a single gene copy. Moreover, we identified for both AMPs several genetic mechanisms of
diversification such as recombination, parallel mutations leading to phylogenetic homoplasy and indel events. In
addition, the non synonymous to synonymous substitutions ratio by codon (dN/dS) revealed several negatively
and positively selected sites for both AMPs, suggesting that directional selection pressures have shaped their
sequence variations.
Conclusions: This study shows for the first time in a mollusc that antimicrobial peptides and proteins have been
subject to distinct patterns of diversification and we evidence the existence of different evolutionary routes leading
to such sequence variability.

Background
The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is a filter feeder
bivalve mollusc which is continually exposed to microorganisms naturally present in the marine environment.
Thus, the capacity to control the microflora and overcome infections is essential for the oyster survival. The
hemocytes, immunocompetent cells, play a central role
in innate antimicrobial response. Indeed, in molluscs,
hemocytes infiltrate injured tissues, phagocyte microorganisms, produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and
release factors such as lectins and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1-3].
In C. gigas, several antimicrobial effectors have been
recently characterized. An AMP, member of the defensin family named Cg-Defm, was identified from the
oyster mantle [4]. Then, two additional defensins named

(France

Cg-Defhs (Cg-Defh1 and Cg-Defh2)have been characterized from hemocytes [5]. Both Cg-defm and Cg-defhs
appear to be continuously expressed in different tissues.
More recently, a new peptide, Cg-Prp, which belongs to
the proline-rich AMP family, has been found in hemocytes [6]. Whereas Cg-Prp displays alone a weak in vitro
antimicrobial activity, it revealed synergistic activity with
Cg-Defm against both Gram positive and negative bacteria [6]. Additionally, a member of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) family has been
characterized [7]. Cg-bpi expression is induced in hemocytes after oyster bacterial challenge and constitutive in
various tissue epithelia of unchallenged oysters. Similar
to vertebrate BPIs, the oyster BPI binds LPS, displays
bactericidal activity against Gram negative bacteria and
increases the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic
membrane [7].
High levels of sequence diversity were reported to be a
characteristic of several antimicrobial effectors pertaining to the innate immunity system of invertebrates [8].

The functional significance of this diversity has been
addressed in some cases. Multiple variants of lectins
from the horseshoe crab Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda
are able to recognize and differentiate bacteria and fungi
[9]. The AMP drosomycin from Drosophila melanogaster presents six isoforms with different antifungal activities [10]. Thus, diversification of antimicrobial effectors
by accumulation of multiple variations around an originally unique form may provide significant means of
acquiring microbial target specificity [11], concerned in
the evolutionary arms race between pathogens and their
hosts.
In this work, we have investigated the diversity of
three oyster antimicrobial effectors and shown the existence of a high diversity in the transcript and genomic
sequences of three antimicrobials, two peptides (Cg-prp
and Cg-defs) and one protein (Cg-bpi). We also evidence
distinct phylogenies between them and propose the existence of a combination of different genetic mechanisms
from which sequence variability arises.

Results
C. gigas antimicrobial peptides and BPI protein show
distinct phylogeny conformations

To characterize the diversity of all the genes, i.e. the two
antimicrobial peptides Cg-defs and Cg-prp, the antimicrobial protein Cg-bpi and the non immune gene Cgactin, we performed an exhaustive sequencing of cloned
PCR products and collected sequences in the Sigenae
database http://www.sigenae.org/. Finally, we got a total
of 256 cDNA sequences and 60 gDNA sequences that
we aligned and used to build phylogenies (Table 1).
Alignments are available as Popset in GenBank; cDNA
sequences of Cg-prp, Cg-defs, Cg-bpi and Cg-actin:
FJ669353-FJ669402, FJ669323-FJ669352, FJ669296FJ669322, FJ669287-FJ669295 respectively and gDNA
sequences of Cg-prp and Cg-defs: FJ669252-FJ669286
and FJ669403-FJ669423 respectively. We obtained for
both AMPs, Cg-prp and Cg-defs, clearly structured phylogenies where sequences clustered in distinct groups,
whereas Cg-bpi and Cg-actin sequences formed star-like
phylogenies instead (Figure 1). On this basis, we identified three distinct and more or less distant groups of
Cg-defs (Figure 1a, group I, II and III), each one composed by multiple variants of Cg-defh1, Cg-defh2 and
Cg-defm, respectively.
Furthermore, we uncovered two lengths of transcripts
for Cg-defm, one corresponding to the coding sequence
(CDS) of 195 bp previously described [4] and a longer
one identified here for the first time with a CDS of 219
bp. Similarly, we identified two lengths of transcripts for
Cg-prp, the one already described with a CDS of 183 bp
[6] and a novel shorter one with an indel of 6 nucleotides in the C-terminal region. Likewise to Cg-defs, Cg-

TN93+I for Cg-bpi and F84+Γ for Cg-actin determined by the Akaike
information criterion. For accurate comparison between the four
genes, cladograms were drawn in the same scale.

prp sequences are distributed into three different groups
(Figure 1b). Group I is only composed of short
sequences, group II of long and short sequences, while
group III contained only two long and highly divergent
sequences. In addition, whenever we got genomic
sequences, they are evenly distributed in every group. In
contrast to both AMPs, only one group of sequences
and homogeneous sequence lengths were obtained for
Cg-bpi (Figure 1c) and Cg-actin (Figure 1d).
The four genes were compared considering the total
nucleotide diversity (Pi) from all identified sequences for
each gene, their haplotype diversity (Hd) and the mean
number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) in
the coding region. Comparison between these values
gave evidence of different constraint forces acting on
each gene (Table 1). Besides, the average density of
SNPs identified for Cg-actin was in agreement with SNP
values estimated for the genome of C. gigas of one SNP
every 60 bp, also characterised by direct sequencing of
PCR products of several genes [12].
Additionally, the comparison of mean nucleotide
diversity (Pi) and the mean nucleotide divergence
between groups of each AMP showed that Cg-prp presents more diverse but less divergent groups compared
to Cg-defs. Cg-prp presents Pi values of 0.023, 0.035 and
0.006 within group I, II and III, respectively, whereas
Cg-defs groups present lower Pi values of 0.001, 0.02
and 0.009 within group I, II and III, respectively. Interestingly, Cg-defh1 (group I) appears to be highly conserved as compared to Cg-defh2 (group II). Cg-bpi and
Cg-actin, which both yield an unstructured phylogeny,
present a Pi of 0.009 and 0.002 respectively.
Besides, values of mean nucleotide divergences
between groups of AMPs show a higher divergence of
Cg-defs groups compared to Cg-prp ones. Cg-defs present mean divergence values of 0.058 between group I
and II; 0.214 between group I and III and 0.223 between

group II and III, while Cg-prp present lower values of
0.063 between group I and II; 0.101 between group I
and III and 0.081 between group II and III. This phylogenetic analysis indicates that Cg-defm is definitively distinct from Cg-defhs. We then separate Cg-defm and Cgdefhs for further polymorphism analysis.
Antimicrobial peptides are encoded by multigene families
with different gene structures

The evidence of different groups revealed by AMP phylogenies and the number of genomic sequence variants
found in one single individual strongly suggest the existence of multiple gene copies. We have therefore estimated the gene copy number of the four molecules
analysed in this study. The gene copy number estimation on 3 individuals revealed that Cg-prp and Cg-defs
are both represented by a high number of copies with
mean values of 13 and 48 copies, respectively. It must
be noticed that the primers used for this quantification
did not allow the distinction between the different
defensins. Thus, this value represents the sum of Cgdefhs and Cg-defm copies. In contrast, Cg-bpi is found
as a single copy gene. Cg-actin is represented by a
higher copy number (mean value of 168 copies), and as
for Cg-defs and Cg-prp, its number of copies varies
among the three oysters analysed (Table 2).
Because both Cg-defs and Cg-prp AMPs are present as
multigene families, we also characterized their gene
structure by exhaustive gDNA sequencing from one
individual. The genomic organization of Cg-prp and Cgdefs revealed two different structures for Cg-prp and one
single structure for Cg-defs (Figure 2). The two structures of Cg-prp correspond either to genes with or without an intron, both arrangements coding for the long
and short peptide variants. All Cg-prp genes containing
the intron have the same exonic organization. Exon 1
contains the sequence encoding the signal peptide and
half of the residues of the anionic domain (103 bp)

while exon 2 encodes the end of the anionic domain
and the cationic domain region (177-183 bp) (figure 2a).
Nevertheless, we identified several indel events between
introns of long and short variants. In addition, intron
sequences of short Cg-prp variants showed length variations ranging from 571 to 588 bp and multiple SNPs. In
contrast to Cg-prp, we found a single genomic structure
for Cg-defs. Exon 1 contains the sequence encoding part
of the signal peptide (43 bp) and exon 2 encodes the
remaining part of the signal peptide region and the
mature peptide region (149 bp), except for the last two
residues encoded by exon 3 (5 bp) (figure 2b). However,
no homology was found between intron sequences of
Cgdefm and Cg-defhs, confirming thus the very ancient
divergence time between the two lineages of these
genes. Moreover, introns between Cg-defm and Cg-defhs
differ by length variations. Cg-defs and Cg-prp AMP
genes contain canonical GT/AG splicing recognition
sequence located at the end of each intron.

Antimicrobial peptides and protein variants are produced
by several mechanisms of diversification

The cDNA and gDNA sequence diversity and the variable gene copy number observed between C. gigas
families of antimicrobials prompted us to investigate the
genetic processes that participated to the diversification.
Thus, we analyzed the repartition of synonymous and
non synonymous substitutions in each group from AMP
phylogenies (figure 3). Each group of Cg-defs presents a
specific distribution of substitutions all along the CDS
(figure 3a). Thus, Cg-defh1 is the most overall conserved
antimicrobial peptide, with only a few numbers of substitutions. Cg-defh2, in contrast, presents a high number
of synonymous substitutions and Cg-defm presents a
profile which differs from hemocyte defensins with
higher number of nonsynonymous substitutions. Cg-prp
shows a different profile compared to Cg-defs in terms
of the distribution of substitutions. Indeed, the substitutions localized in the signal and anionic peptide region
are shared by groups, while substitutions in the cationic
peptide region are specific of each group (figure 3b).
Altogether, these results show the existence of different
constraint levels between and within the groups of
AMPs (Cg-defs and Cg-prp).
Sequence alignments gave also evidence of several
genetic mechanisms of diversification such as recombination and parallel mutations leading to phylogenetic
homoplasy. Clues of recombination were detected by
the visual inspection of alignments and by the construction of cladograms using different domains of each antimicrobial (data not shown) that lead to inconsistent
clustering of sequences: several sequences of Cg-defhs,
Cg-prp and Cg-bpi moving from one clade to another
according to the domain used, suggesting past recombination events between members of different groups. We
then calculated the minimum number of recombination
events (Rm) for all genes. Cg-defhs, Cg-prp and Cg-bpi
showed Rm values of 5, 6 and 10, respectively. In contrast, we did not find any evidence of recombination for
Cg-defm and Cg-actin. Because of the large difference in
size between our genes and since the probability of
recombination is proportional to the length of each
sequence, we calculated a ratio of Rm/CDS length for a
correct comparison between AMPs and Cg-bpi protein.
The ratios of Rm/CDS length for Cg-defhs, Cg-prp and
Cg-bpi were 0.030, 0.027 and 7 × 10 -3 respectively,
which gave evidence of a higher probability in AMPs to
present recombination between alleles compared to Cgbpi.
In addition to the increase in the gene copy number
described above, other processes that participate in
AMP diversification are indel events which produce
length variations in the CDS. Long variants of Cg-defm
are obtained by an indel of two nucleotides at the 3’end

(position 191) which changes the open reading frame
and generates a longer molecule of 24 nucleotides, coding for a peptide of 73 amino acids with eight extra
amino acids compared to the original form. For Cg-prp,
the two lengths are generated by an indel of six nucleotides near the 3’end (position 171), corresponding to a
repetition of the precedent nucleotides. These forms
code for peptides of 59 and 62 amino acids.
Antimicrobial peptides and protein show a great number
of variants and AMP diversity is shaped by directional
selection pressure

From all sequences analyzed in this study, we identified
43 variants of Cg-Prp, 24 variants of Cg-BPI, 9 variants
of Cg-Defm, 10 variants of Cg-Defhs and only 5 variants
of Cg-Actin. Thus, we then analyzed if the sequence
diversity has been shaped by directional selection pressures. The ratios of non synonymous to synonymous
substitutions (dN/dS) for each codon of the four molecules indicate several sites under negative and positive
selection for both AMPs (Cg-Defs and Cg-Prp), but not
for Cg-BPI and Cg-Actin (Figure 4). To obtain dN/dS
ratios, we first excluded all obvious recombinant
sequences. Then, to assess the significance of the findings, we carried out a likelihood ratio test (LRT) and
considered only codons showing significantly negative
and positive selection (p < 0.05). Ten and 11 residues
showing significant negative selection were identified in
Cg-Defs and Cg-Prp respectively. For both AMPs, we
detected a lower number of positively selected sites (3
and 6 residues in Cg-Defs and Cg-Prp respectively).
In Cg-Defs, the signal peptide is well conserved for
each class of defensin. Besides, the cleavage site for signal peptidase and the position of the cysteines is completely conserved in all variants (Figure 4a). We
identified a high number of amino acid substitutions
between Cg-Defs and several substitutions occurring in
the mature peptide which change the physicochemical
properties of the encoded amino acid. Thus, the polarity
and/or charge of amino acids are modified in sites 28
(Gly/Arg), 29 (Asn/Asp), 31 (Leu/Tyr), 32 (Lys/Glu), 35
(Asn/Ser/Arg) 38 (Lys/Gln/Arg), 41 (Ser/Gly), and 60
(Asp/Gly). In contrast, substitutions occurring in the
signal peptide do not modify the physico-chemical properties of the encoded amino acid. Interestingly, long
forms of Cg-defm present two extra positive charged
amino acids in position 67 and 70 (Lys) and one extra
negative charged amino acid in position 68 (Glu).
In Cg-Prp, the signal peptide is the most variable
region and the cleavage site is completely conserved
among all variants, but the putative chymotrypsin cleavage site between the anionic and cationic domain presents an amino acid variation in position 43 (Tyr/Iso)
(Figure 4b). Although this mutation is found in both
long and short variants, the chymotrypsin cleavage site

Page 6 of 12

remained unchanged. Amino acid substitutions are identified in both signal and mature peptide region and they
mainly concern the polarity of residues, like sites 7
(Tyr/Ile/Cys), 8 (Tyr/Phe), 14 (Ser/Gly), 26 (Leu/Ser), 45
(Ile/Tyr), 47 (Ser/Pro) and 57 (Pro/Gln). We also found
complex sites with four and six different amino acid
substitutions per site in which polarity and charge are
modified, like sites 20 (His/Phe/Lys/Tyr/Asp/Gln) and
21 (Leu/Arg/Ile/Gln).

Discussion
Our results showed the existence of high and variable
sequence diversity of C. gigas antimicrobial peptides
(two AMPs,Cg-prp and Cg-defs) and protein (Cg-bpi),
produced by a combination of different genetic mechanisms. Phylogenetic trees constructed with CDS from
transcripts and genomic sequences showed a distinct
phylogeny shape for each gene. The antimicrobial protein Cg-bpi expressed in hemocytes presents higher
number of variants compared to non immune gene Cgactin, but it is less diverse than AMPs. In contrast to
both AMPs, Cg-bpi variants fall into one single group
encoded by one single gene copy, being in accordance
with the one copy present in human [13]. Thus, the
sequence diversity observed for Cg-bpi results from allelic polymorphism only, with occasional recombination
between alleles at a lower frequency when compared to
AMPs. Though sequences obtained by PCR approach
come from relatively limited sample size (N = 144) but
with a large spectrum of oyster origin and challenge
conditions, the sequence sampling saturation curve (plot
of the number of different haplotypes to the total number of sequences performed) have a sigmoid shape indicating that sequencing effort was sufficient in our
population to approach the plateau of saturation for
each gene (data not shown). Furthermore, we have complemented the sample size by adding all the C. gigas
ESTs available in databases. These ESTs come from
more than 20 cDNA libraries (different tissues, experimental conditions and developmental stages) retrieved
in the last decade. The combination of these two distinct sources of sequences is probably not exhaustive
but covers a large enough range of variants to give a
good insight of the overall polymorphism of the genes.
Cg-prp, which is expressed only in hemocytes, presents the highest number of transcript variants that are
distributed into three groups. This partitioned phylogeny
results in part from group specific mutations affecting
only the cationic region. These key mutations in the
potential active domain have segregated into two major
lineages that are further diversified on other sites.
There, high polymorphism in signal peptide and anionic
region induces high sequence diversity within each
group. Interestingly, we observed two very divergent

sequences forming a third distinct group. Such a long
branch in the phylogeny leading to few sequences may
be indicative of an ongoing or recent process of neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization. These kinds of
phenomena are often invoked in the course of evolution
of duplicate genes [14], here supported by the finding of
multiple copies for Cg-prp. In addition to this, sequence
polymorphism of Cg-prp is produced by recombination
and convergent mutations leading to phylogenetic
homoplasy. Besides, Cg-prp is encoded by a lower number of copies than Cg-defs but shows higher number of
different transcripts, indicating that allelic polymorphism
associated with higher recombination frequency is
important for this antimicrobial effector. Noticeably,
intronless genes were found for Cg-Prp as previously
described in other organisms where it was demonstrated
to accelerate mRNA maturation process [15]. On the
opposite, intron presence was also described to have
positive effect on transcript stability [16]. Nevertheless,
the role of different genomic structures and its correlation with the antimicrobial function remains unclear.
Cg-defs expressed in hemocytes and mantle tissue
exhibit the highest divergence between groups but a
lower diversity within each one. Moreover, each Cg-defs
group displays different conservation level, showing that
Cg-defh1 is less diversified than Cg-defh2, Cg-defm and
even Cg-actin. Since we collected the different Cg-defs
in the same conditions, we can rule out a technical bias
inducing a highly redundant sequencing of the same
molecule Cg-defh1 and leading to a skewed appreciation
of the relative variability of each group. Thus, two major
hypotheses could explain this extremely low level of
variability: (i) Cg-defh1 appeared recently and is not yet
diversified albeit frequent in the genome we explored,
or (ii) Cg-defh1 could be an older variant but have
undergone strong selective pressure. There is no apparent reason why Cg-defh1 could be more under selective
constraints than the other Cg-defs. So the polymorphism
reduction it displays is more likely due to a recent selective sweep than to purifying selection acting in a long
term manner. We can postulate that this selective sweep
could be consecutive to infections by pathogens that Cgdefh1 was particularly effective to combat. In addition,
the fact that Cg-actin also appears more polymorphic at
nucleotide level than Cg-defh1 is also in favour of a
selective sweep on Cg-defh1, since it indicates that the
polymorphism reduction concerns both the synonymous
and the non-synonymous sites while purifying selection
would affect mainly non-synonymous mutations. However, further studies are needed to clarify this point.
Cg-defs also present recombination parallel homoplasic
events and a multigene family as observed for Cg-prp.
Nevertheless, the absence of recombination between Cgdefm and Cgdefhs, together with the lack of homology

Page 8 of 12

between their introns, indicates that these two lineages
are separated for a longer time than Cg-prp. This could
be associated with the tissue specific expression of Cgdefm [4] and Cg-defhs [5] probably acquired after a
duplication event followed by sub-functionalization. The
tissue specific expression has already been described for
several AMPs like mice a-defensins, which might be
linked to differences in innate immune functions [17].
Likewise, sequence diversification of AMPs by gene
duplication has been reported for vertebrates and invertebrates [18,19].
It is remarkable that gene duplication, as well as
strong selective pressure (either positive or negative),
did not affect identically the genes that we have studied;
the antimicrobial peptides,Cg-defs and Cg-prp, have
been a target for both, while antimicrobial protein Cgbpi was not. This may reflect a difference in the way
these two types of molecules participate in the immune
response.
Concerning the sites under selection, the sites subject
to purification found for both AMPs correspond to residues under strong functional constraints. In Cg-Defs,
seven of eight Cys residues are under negative selection
and Cys residues are known to be essential for the antimicrobial function of these peptides [20]. In Cg-Prp, the
conserved Pro-Arg motif has been involved in antimicrobial activity of this class of AMPs [21] and the conserved C-terminal Gly is expected to be eliminated,
obtaining a C-terminally amidated peptide which would
increase its cationic properties [6].
In addition to these constrained sites, sites subject to
diversifying selection of the AMPs could also have a
role in antimicrobial function. In Cg-Defs, positively
selected sites concern the modification of the charge
and/or polarity of certain amino acids, and these
changes could probably affect the affinity of the peptides
to bacterial membranes. This finding is in accordance
with several sites in human beta-defensin 1, in which
amino acid charge is directly involved in the antimicrobial activity [22]. In Cg-Prp, from all positively selected
sites, we identified a site in the active domain where a
change of a Pro toward a Gln occurred. Because the
activity of proline-rich AMPs [23] relies of course on
proline residues, the functional characterization of these
variants in terms of efficiency could help in understanding their role in the antimicrobial response. The functional significance of other positively and negatively sites
along the coding region of Cg-defs and Cg-prp remains
unknown and needs further investigation. Nevertheless,
we propose, following several authors [24,25] that strong
selective pressures on AMPs are directed toward the
acquisition of novel microbial target specificities.
Evidence for directional selection driving evolution has
been addressed in several cases [26-28] and it is

Schmitt et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/23

consistent with the general hypothesis of co-evolution or
“arms race” [29]. In this hypothesis, the pathogen
evolves continuously to escape from the immune
response of host and, consequently, the immune system
of host evolves to improve barriers against pathogens.
Thus, such interactions might provide rapid evolution in
genes concerned in host-pathogen interactions. The
emergence of Cg-defh1, a form of Cg-defhs that seems
to have largely spread out in the oysters we analyzed,
could be a good illustration of this.
Besides the sites under directional pressures, both
AMPs show different lengths of mature peptide which
could modify their antimicrobial activities. In one hand,
Cg-Defm long variants present a longer C-terminal tail
with eight extra amino acid residues that could influence the affinity to the bacterial membranes. Indeed, different C-terminal tails of alpha-defensins from rat are
already described and are predicted to be exposed to the
surface where they might confer a different antimicrobial spectrum [30]. On the other hand, the two lengths
of Cg-Prpare produced by an indel of an Arg-Pro motif
in the cationic domain, which is described to be
involved in the antimicrobial activity of proline rich
AMPs [23]. All these differences between antimicrobial
effectors could be related to specific antimicrobial functions and result from co-evolution between host and
pathogen species.

Conclusions
All these data support the hypothesis that oysters, continuously exposed to an environment rich in microorganisms, have developed specific strategies of innate
immunity to increase the antimicrobial defense upon
infection through effector diversification. In addition,
considering the synergistic activities already reported
between the two AMPs, Cg-Prp and Cg-Defm, [6] and
between several isoforms of the same AMP in other species [31,32], the observed diversity could also improve
the antimicrobial response through synergic activities.
The next step of our work is now to establish the functional significance of this diversity.
Methods
Animals

Hemocytes were sampled from C. gigas adult oysters
under 24 experimental conditions (total of 144 oysters):
oysters of three geographic origins (6 oysters per condition; Atlantic coast-La Tremblade, Normandie-Bay des
Veys and Mediterranean Sea-Thau lagoon) were
exposed to four kinds of bacterial challenges and hemolymph were sampled and pooled at two post challenge
times. The bacterial challenges performed by oyster
immersion were (1) alive non virulent Micrococcus
luteus and Vibrio tasmaniensis (2.5 × 108 bacteria/L for

Page 9 of 12

each strain), (2) alive virulent V. splendidus (5 × 10 8
bacteria/L), (3) mix of heat killed virulent V. splendidus
and V. aestuarianus (2.5 × 10 8 bacteria/L for each
strain) and (4) unchallenged oysters. For each condition,
hemolymph was collected at 12 and 24 hours after challenge from the pericardial cavity through the adductor
muscle. After hemolymph collection, hemocytes were
isolated by centrifugation to discard plasma (700 g for
10 min. at 4°C) for further RNA extraction. For RNA
extraction of mantle tissue, oysters from the Mediterranean Sea (Thau lagoon) were harvested by dissection.
All experimental infections were performed according to
the Ifremer animal care guideline and policy.
For the genomic DNA extractions (gDNA), hemocytes
were recovered individually as described above from
three oysters used for gene quantification and from one
oyster used for gene structure determination originating
from the Mediterranean Sea (Thau lagoon).
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted from C. gigas hemocytes and
mantle tissues using Trizol reagent according to manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen™). RNA was then treated with DNAse I (Invitrogen™), 15 min at room
temperature and inactivated by heat, 10 min at 65°C. A
second precipitation was performed with sodium acetate
0.3 M to eliminated DNAse and degraded DNA. Then,
quantification and quality of total RNA were determined
using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies) and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively.
Following heat denaturation of 1 μg of total RNA (65°C
for 5 min), first strand synthesis was carried out using
50 ng oligo-(dT)12-18, 1 mM dNTPs, 1 unit RnaseOUT
(Invitrogen™) and 200 units M-MLV reverse transcriptase in reverse transcriptase buffer (Invitrogen™) following the manufacturer protocol.
Genomic DNA extraction

Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from oyster hemocytes individually, by incubation in buffer (100 mM
NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 25 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5%
SDS and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K), 4 h at 50°C, followed
by phenol/chloroform extraction. gDNA was precipitated by the addition of cold ethanol (-80°C) and treated
with 50 μg/ml RNAse (Invitrogen™), 30 min at 37°C.
This was followed by a second DNA precipitation and
DNA purity and concentration were determined as
described above for RNA samples.
5’ and 3’ RACE, molecular cloning and sequencing

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were performed from hemocytes and mantle tissue RNA to
obtain both 5’UTR and 3’UTR of Cg-defh1 and Cg-defh2
and the 5’UTR of Cg-defm. We designed three specific
antisense primers from Cg-defh cDNA partial coding
sequences (CDS) [GenBank DQ400101 and GenBank
DQ400102] for the 5’ RACE, one specific sense primer

Schmitt et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/23

for the 3’ RACE and three antisense primers for the 5’
RACE from Cg-defm cDNA CDS [GenBank AM050547].
Primers are listed in table 1. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer 5’/3’ RACE protocol (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, 5’ RACE
for Cg-defhs was carried out using 1 μg of total RNA,
1.6 μM of Cg-defh5’ sp1 antisense primer, 1 mM
dNTPs, 1 unit/μl RnaseOUT (Invitrogen™) and 200
units/μl M-MLV reverse transcriptase in reverse transcriptase buffer (Invitrogen™). The cDNA was then treated with two units of RNaseH for 20 min at 37°C.
ssDNA product was purified with High Pure PCR Product purification kit (Roche), and a poly A end was
added with 1 μL of terminal transferase (80 U/μL) (Promega). The 5’UTR for Cg-defhs was obtained after two
PCR reactions, the first reaction with the antisense primer Cg-defh5’sp2 and the oligo (dT) anchor primer
(Roche) and the second one with the antisense primer
Cg-defh5’sp3 and the race (dT) anchor primer (Roche).
5’RACE for Cg-defm was performed with the three antisense primers as described above. 3’ RACE for Cg-defhs
was performed in the same conditions as 5’ RACE but
using the oligo (dT) anchor primer (Roche) for first
strand synthesis. Only one round of PCR was performed
using the specific sense primer Cg-defh3 ’sp1 and race
(dT) anchor primer (Roche) to obtain 3’UTR. Each
RACE-PCR products was gel purified using a QIAQuick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and cloned
using TOPO TA (Invitrogen™) with the pCR 2.1 TOPO®
vector. Plasmids were transformed into TOP10 E. coli
cells, and plasmids were purified using Wizard™ SV

Page 10 of 12

miniprep DNA purification kit (Promega). Plasmid
sequencing was performed using Big Dye™ Terminator
sequencing kit on a DNA sequencer model ABI Prism
3130XL (Applied Biosystems).
PCR amplification and sequencing from cDNA and gDNA

PCR amplifications from cDNA were performed using
specific primers designed in the 5’UTR and in 3’UTR
from sequences of Cg-prp [GenBank BQ426670], Cg-bpi
[GenBank AY165040], Cg-defm [GenBank AM050547]
and Cg-actin [GenBank EW779066]. Specific primers for
Cg-defhs and sense primer for Cg-defm were designed in
the 5’UTR and 3’UTR from sequences retrieved through
RACE assays described above. The sequences of each
specific pair of primers are listed in Table 3. Cg-prp, Cgdefhs, Cg-bpi and Cg-actin were amplified from cDNA
synthesised from a pool sample of hemocyte RNAs and
Cg-defm was amplified from cDNA synthesised from a
pool sample of mantle tissue RNAs. PCR reactions were
carried out with GOTaq polymerase according to manufacturer instructions (Promega), using 1 μl of synthesized cDNA under the following conditions: 10 min at
95°C, then 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 57°C for 1 min,
72°C for 2 min and a final elongation step at 72°C for 7
min. PCR products were cloned and sequenced as
described above.
Genomic sequences were obtained by PCR amplification on gDNA from one individual sample with the
same specific pair of primers used to amplify cDNA
(Table 1), in a total volume of 25 μl. Template (100 ng
of gDNA) was amplified under the following conditions:
10 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles at 95°C for 1 min,

57°C for 1 min, 72°C for 3 min and a final elongation
step at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were cloned and
sequenced as described above.
In silico approach

Sequences previously identified for Cg-prp, Cg-defm, Cgdefh1, Cg-defh2, Cg-bpi and Cg-actin were used for the
search of homologous sequences among the 29,745
unique sequences contained in the Sigenae C. gigas EST
database http://www.sigenae.org/[33,34].
From all the identified sequences, we kept only
sequences with the complete CDS. In addition, to avoid
scoring PCR or sequencing artefacts, we have only considered sequences shared between PCR and in silico
approaches or those observed at least twice in the same
approach.
Gene copy number estimation

For each gene, specific pairs of primers were designed
from a conserved region on one exon selected by comparison of all the sequences compiled in this study (Table
3). As standard of gene quantification, we used equimolar
amounts of pCR 2.1 TOPO ® vector plasmid DNA
(pDNA) containing the inserts of interest which were
pooled and diluted in 40 ng of herring sperm DNA. Efficiency of amplification was calculated by serial dilutions
ranging from 103 to 109 copies per reaction which were
tested in duplicate with each primer pair. qPCR assays
were then performed in duplicate with four serial dilutions of gDNA (between 5 to 40 ng per reaction) from 3
individuals separately, and we used the concentration of
20 ng to estimated the gene number. qPCR was carried
out on the LightCycler 480 System (Roche). The reaction
mixture consisted of LightCycler 480 master mix (1×)
and 0.5 μM of each primer and was submitted to: 10 min
of denaturation at 95°C, 40 cycles of 10s of denaturation
at 95°C, 20s of annealing at 60°C and 20s of extension at
72°C, and fluorescence detection. After an initial 10 s
denaturation step at 95°C, a melting curve was obtained
from a start temperature of 65°C to a final temperature
of 95°C, with an increase of 0.06°C/s. The data were analyzed using LightCycler 480 software version 1.5.0.39 and
the 2nd derivative max algorithm.
Gene copy number was calculated by absolute quantification. Standard curves for gDNA and pDNA of each
gene were constructed from the mean Ct values using
linear regression, from which slope and correlation coefficients were calculated. PCR efficiency was determined
by plotting the threshold cycle (Ct) as a function of
Log10 concentration of the template used. Using an
estimation of the C. gigas genome size of about 823 Mb,
the number of molecules represented in 20 ng of gDNA
was then calculated. Quantification was finally achieved
by plotting the measured threshold cycle (Ct) on the
standard curve obtained with the serial dilutions of
pDNA. pDNA and gDNA can be used similarly as

Page 11 of 12

reference molecules if their PCR efficiencies and correlation coefficients are identical [35].
Sequence data analysis

The multiple alignments were generated using the
MAFFT alignment program (http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.
ac.jp/mafft/online/server/, version 6) [36]. Prediction of
signal peptide was performed with the SignalP program
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/, version 3.0)
[37]. Construction of phylogenetic trees was performed
with PHYML v2.4.4 [38] using the models with the best
Akaike information criterion (Phymltest function from
the APE package) [39].
On the basis of the uncovered sequence phylogenies,
we defined clearly distinct groups of sequences that were
used in further polymorphism analyses, whereas
sequences with ambiguous positions were not considered. Measure of sequence diversity as the mean nucleotide diversity (Pi) (intra-group) and the mean nucleotide
divergence (inter-groups) values were calculated using
the Maximum Composite Likelihood method included in
the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis program
(http://www.megasoftware.net/ version 4.0) [40]. Polymorphism values and minimum numbers of recombination events (Rm) were calculated with DNAsp program
(http://www.ub.es/dnasp/ version 4.20.2) [41]. The ratio
of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions (dN) to the
rate of synonymous substitutions (dS) for each codon
was calculated with Selecton web server http://selecton.
tau.ac.il/index.html[42], based on M8 evolutionary model
which allows for positive selection. Statistical significance
of results (p < 0.05) was assessed using the likelihood
ratio test (LRT) which compares the log likelihood of M8
model to the log likelihood of M8a alternative model,
that allows for negative and neutral selection.
