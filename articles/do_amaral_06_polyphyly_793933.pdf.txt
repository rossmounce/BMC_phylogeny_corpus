Abstract
Background: The family Accipitridae (hawks, eagles and Old World vultures) represents a large radiation of predatory birds
with an almost global distribution, although most species of this family occur in the Neotropics. Despite great morphological
and ecological diversity, the evolutionary relationships in the family have been poorly explored at all taxonomic levels. Using
sequences from four mitochondrial genes (12S, ATP8, ATP6, and ND6), we reconstructed the phylogeny of the Neotropical
forest hawk genus Leucopternis and most of the allied genera of Neotropical buteonines. Our goals were to infer the evolutionary
relationships among species of Leucopternis, estimate their relationships to other buteonine genera, evaluate the phylogenetic
significance of the white and black plumage patterns common to most Leucopternis species, and assess general patterns of
diversification of the group with respect to species' affiliations with Neotropical regions and habitats.
Results: Our molecular phylogeny for the genus Leucopternis and its allies disagrees sharply with traditional taxonomic
arrangements for the group, and we present new hypotheses of relationships for a number of species. The mtDNA phylogenetic
trees derived from analysis of the combined data posit a polyphyletic relationship among species of Leucopternis, Buteogallus and
Buteo. Three highly supported clades containing Leucopternis species were recovered in our phylogenetic reconstructions. The
first clade consisted of the sister pairs L. lacernulatus and Buteogallus meridionalis, and Buteogallus urubitinga and Harpyhaliaetus
coronatus, in addition to L. schistaceus and L. plumbeus. The second clade included the sister pair Leucopternis albicollis and L.
occidentalis as well as L. polionotus. The third lineage comprised the sister pair L. melanops and L. kuhli, in addition to L.
semiplumbeus and Buteo buteo. According to our results, the white and black plumage patterns have evolved at least twice in the
group. Furthermore, species found to the east and west of the Andes (cis-Andean and trans-Andean, respectively) are not
reciprocally monophyletic, nor are forest and non-forest species.
Conclusion: The polyphyly of Leucopternis, Buteogallus and Buteo establishes a lack of concordance of current Accipitridae
taxonomy with the mtDNA phylogeny for the group, and points to the need for further phylogenetic analysis at all taxonomic
levels in the family as also suggested by other recent analyses. Habitat shifts, as well as cis- and trans-Andean disjunctions, took
place more than once during buteonine diversification in the Neotropical region. Overemphasis of the black and white plumage
patterns has led to questionable conclusions regarding the relationships of Leucopternis species, and suggests more generally that
plumage characters should be used with considerable caution in the taxonomic evaluation of the Accipitridae.

Background
The family Accipitridae comprises approximately 237 species of predatory birds distributed worldwide except Antarctica [1], with diversity concentrated in the Neotropics
[1,2]. Despite numerous taxonomic revisions (e.g., [3,4]),
the evolutionary history of the family has not been sufficiently explored using methods of phylogenetic inference,
and current classifications are mainly based on plumage
and ecological resemblance between taxa [5]. Current taxonomy is still highly provisional at all taxonomic levels
[1,6], and does not appear to reflect phylogenetic relationships in several cases [7,8], thus retarding biogeographic
analysis, morphological trait mapping and the general
understanding of the evolutionary history of the Accipitridae.
The Accipitridae morphological diversity has been traditionally represented in sub-groups of similar or supposedly closely related species, such as "kites", "harriers",
"booted eagles" and "buteonines" [1]. The buteonine
hawks are represented by the large cosmopolitan genus
Buteo and several related genera, called "sub-buteonines"
by Amadon [4], which includes the predominantly Neotropical genera Buteogallus, Parabuteo, Asturina, Leucopternis,
Busarellus,
Geranoaetus,
Geranospiza
and
Harpyhaliaetus. Two old world genera, Kaupifalco and
Butastur, were formerly included as part of the "sub-buteonines" group, but were subsequently removed from this
division [9]. Some authors consider the buteonine as a
sub-family (Buteonineae, e.g. Friedman [10], Grossman
and Hamlet [11]), but formal sub-familial division of
Accipitridae has been a contentious issue due to a lack of
knowledge of the evolutionary history of the family (see
[9,12]).
Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand
the processes responsible for the generation of the high
species richness found in the Neotropics, and several
models of biotic diversification have been invoked to
explain such patterns, for example forest refuges resulting
from climatic fluctuations [13-15], rivers as barriers to
gene flow [16], river dynamics [17], sea level oscillations
[18-20], geotectonic vicariance [21] and ecological factors
[22] (see Moritz et al. [23] for a revision). However, these
models have only rarely been tested with organisms capable of long-distance dispersal (e.g., [24,25]), such as
hawks and eagles capable of soaring and gliding flight.
Numerous flocks of migrant hawk species as Buteo
platypterus and Buteo swainsoni, for example, cross the
Andes as part of their yearly migrations [26], and call into
question the degree to which the geographical barriers to
gene flow identified in many models of Neotropical diversification have been important in Accipitridae speciation.

The genus Leucopternis is a morphologically heterogeneous group of 10 buteonine species distributed in forested
habitats from southern Mexico to Paraguay and Uruguay
[1], and offers an opportunity to explore the diversification of an Accipitridae group distributed throughout the
Neotropical region. Species in the genus vary from the
small L. semiplumbeus (250 g) to the large L. princeps (1 kg)
[1], and are hawks with broad wings and medium to short
tails. Two species, L. schistaceus and L. plumbeus, are
entirely dark slate; however, most Leucopternis have primarily white plumage and vary in the amount of black, grey
or slate black on the back, wings and/or head. Those
which we here refer to as "black-and-white" Leucopternis
species are L. albicollis, L. polionotus, L. occidentalis, L. lacernulatus, L. melanops, L. kuhli, L. semiplumbeus, and L. princeps [1,6]. While Leucopternis are found exclusively in
forest habitats, other Neotropical buteonine species occur
in a variety of habitats, such as mangroves (Buteogallus
aequinoctialis), savannahs (Harpyhaliaetus coronatus, Buteogallus meridionalis) and wetlands (Busarellus nigricollis)
[1,6], which makes this group suitable to analysis of the
evolutionary relationships of forest and non-forest species.
The buteonine phylogeny has been partially explored
recently using morphological and molecular data
[7,27,28], but Neotropical species have not been well represented. Incomplete taxon sampling notwithstanding,
these analyses have called into question the monophyly
of Leucopternis, Buteo and Buteogallus [7,28]. The present
work constitutes an effort to clarify the relationships
among all Leucopternis species, and their position relative
to other Neotropical buteonine genera. We address the
following questions: (1) Is Leucopternis as currently recognized monophyletic? (2) What are the relationships
among species of Leucopternis to other genera of buteonine hawks? (3) Is the black and white plumage pattern a
synapomorphic trait uniting the majority of species in the
genus Leucopternis? (4) Are phylogenetic relationships
among Neotropical buteonines predicted by biogeography or habitat?

Results
Datasets, molecular variation
Our final alignment of the total dataset (12S, ATP8 and 6
and ND6) without gaps totalled 2179 base pairs, with 651
variable and 505 parsimony informative sites. Uncorrected distances ranged from 0 to 7.1% for 12S (without
gaps), 0 to 21.4% for ATP8, 0 to 11.9% for ATP6, and 0 to
13.9% for ND6. Deviations from linearity were found in
third position plots of ATP8, ATP6 and ND6. We did not
detect significant departures from homogeneity of base
frequencies across taxa in any dataset (P > 0.05, data not
shown). We are confident of mitochondrial origin of our
sequences because: (1) most of our samples were repre-

sented by mitochondrial-rich tissues (feathers, muscle or
liver); (2) most samples (comprising 12 of 20 species)
had all regions sequenced using independent fragments
amplified with different primer sets (with sequence overlap ranging from 67 to more than 400bp, in highly variable regions), and sequences were identical; (3) sequences
were easily aligned to published sequences of other
Accipitridae species; (4) electropherograms were carefully
checked for double peaks; (5) coding regions did not
show unexpected stop codons; and 6) gene specific phylogenetic analyses revealed similar relationships to those
inferred from the combined data, indicating that a mitochondrial translocation to the nucleus would have to have
been more than eight kilobases in length.

A single nucleotide site in the 12S sequence of the muscle
sample LGEMA F39 (L. lacernulatus) presented a strong
"C" peak with a lower "A" peak at the position 593, and
this same pattern persisted in sequences obtained from
amplifications using three different primer combinations,
with sizes ranging from approximately 800 to 2700 bp.
The sequence can be easily aligned and has a base composition similar to other published sequences for the
Accipitridae. We could not find any evidence of pseudogene amplification, and since it has been suggested that
PCR amplifications larger than 1.5 kilobases are likely to
represent true mitochondrial amplifications [29], this site
was coded as "M" (IUPAC code representing C and A) in
all analyses, and it may represent an example of mitochondrial heteroplasmy.

Reconstructions determined by unordered parsimony using the ML topology obtained from the combined dataset. Species of Leucopternis and Buteogallus are indicated in red and blue. AF represents Atlantic Forest.
Phylogenetic analysis, single and combined datasets
None of the phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of the hawk genera Leucopternis, Buteogallus or Buteo.
Phylogenies inferred from the subsets of mtDNA genes
and combined data were largely congruent under all optimization criteria, and topologies differed mainly in resolution and nodal support. Although phylogenetic analysis
of single gene subsets resulted in poorly resolved trees
(data not shown), the nodes identified with high bootstrap support (> 75) or posterior probabilities (> 0.95)
were entirely congruent with those identified in the combined analyses.

The maximum likelihood (ML) inference of the total dataset resulted in one completely resolved tree with likelihood -ln 9813.2993 (figure 1), which was identical to the
majority rule consensus topology of the Bayesian analysis
(BA). Most nodes were highly supported by both bootstrap proportions and posterior probabilities. Maximum
parsimony (MP) analyses of the total dataset resulted in
two equally parsimonious trees (1531 steps, CI = 0.4899,
RI= 0.6938) (trees not shown), which were also highly
congruent with the ML and BA inferences. The main dif-

ferences between the MP trees and the other combined
analyses were the position of L. princeps basal to Clades 2
and 3 plus the remaining Buteo species and Parabuteo
unicinctus (bootstrap support 68, data not shown), and
the position of L. schistaceus basal to a poorly supported
clade containing the sister pairs Buteogallus meridionalis
and L. lacernulatus, and H. coronatus and Buteogallus urubitinga (bootstrap support < 50, data not shown).
Three major mtDNA clades containing Leucopternis species (figure 1) were recovered in all combined analysis,
with high levels of statistical support in most cases. Clade
1 included Buteogallus meridionalis, L. lacernulatus, Buteogallus urubitinga, H. coronatus, L. schistaceus and L.
plumbeus; Leucopternis princeps was basal to this Clade 1 in
the ML and BA analyses, but with low support. The ML
and BA analyses strongly supported a sister relationship
between L. lacernulatus and Buteogallus meridionalis, and
between H. coronatus and B. urubitinga; the latter sister pair
was also highly supported by parsimony bootstrap (bootstrap support 98, data not shown). There was weaker support for a sister relationship between L. schistaceus and
Buteogallus meridionalis plus L. lacernulatus, obtained in the

ML and BA analyses. All phylogenetic trees inferred from
the combined dataset establish an early split of L.
plumbeus from the rest of the Clade 1.
Clade 2 comprised the two sampled L. albicollis subspecies
(which carried identical mtDNA sequences), L. occidentalis
and L. polionotus. Clade 3 was sister to Clade 2 and
included L. semiplumbeus, L. melanops and L. kuhli sister to
Buteo buteo. Buteo albicaudatus, Buteo magnirostris,
Parabuteo unicinctus and Buteo leucorrhous were outside the
sister relationship of Clade 2 and Clade 3 in all analyses.
There was strong support in the ML, MP and BA trees
obtained from the combined dataset for a sister relationship between Buteo leucorrhous and P. unicinctus.
Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests were conducted on topologies
constrained by the monophyly of all species in the genus
Leucopternis, monophyly of species with the black and
white plumage pattern, monophyly of all forest species,
and reciprocal monophyly of the cis- and trans-Andean
species. In all tests the constraint trees had a significantly
poorer fit to the data than the unconstrained ML tree (P <
0.001). Ancestral state reconstructions of habitat and
plumage traits onto the ML tree using unordered parsimony (Figure 2) showed that the black-and-white plumage characteristic to most Leucopternis species evolved at
least twice in Neotropical buteonines, and shifts between
forest and open habitats occurred at least four times.

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships, novel groupings, and evolution
of common plumage patterns
The mtDNA-based phylogenies for Neotropical buteonines reject the monophyly of the genera Leucopternis,
Buteogallus and Buteo. Our analysis provides another
example of the lack of correspondence between classic
taxonomic groupings within the Accipitridae and molecular phylogenies [7,8,28]. The genus Leucopternis is a composite of three independent lineages, and several
Leucopternis species are more closely related to other buteonine taxa than to each other.

One of the novel phylogenetic arrangements presented
here is the sister relationship between L. lacernulatus and
Buteogallus meridionalis, rather than between L. lacernulatus
and the sympatric Atlantic forest endemic L. polionotus,
despite overall similarities in plumage pattern between
the latter pair (see [30]). A proposed close relationship
[1,4,12,30] between L. lacernulatus and the L. melanops/L.
kuhli complex was not supported in any of our analyses.
Although close association of L. lacernulatus and B. meridionalis was unanticipated, the distinctiveness of the latter
from other Buteogallus species has been recognized by its
placement by some authors in the monotypic genus Het-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/10

erospizias (e.g.,[10,11,30-34]). A close relationship
between Buteogallus urubitinga, and Harpyhaliaetus eagles
has been previously suggested [35,36], and the retention
of the former in Buteogallus has been justified only by the
bigger size of the Harpyhaliaetus species [35]. A recent
higher-level molecular analysis of hawks and eagles [28]
posited the paraphyly of the genus Buteogallus, and established a closer relationship of Buteogallus urubitinga and
Harpyhaliaetus species than between the two Buteogallus
species sampled (B. urubitinga and B. anthracinus). Given
the polyphyletic relationships of Buteogallus as presented
here it is clear that a complete re-assessment of the genus
is required. It is worth noting that Amadon [4], Grossman
and Hamlet [11], Brown and Amadon [12] and Ridgway
[37] predicted the relatively close relationship of L. schistaceus and L. plumbeus to Buteogallus established in the
mtDNA phylogeny presented here. However, we did not
recover a sister relationship between the latter pair, sometimes considered subspecies [30] or members of a superspecies complex (e.g., [9,38,39]).
The proximity of L. polionotus, L. albicollis and L. occidentalis is fully supported by our data, and has been strongly
suggested
in
taxonomic
revisions
(e.g.,
[1,3,4,6,9,12,30,38,39]). Species limits in the L. albicollis
complex have been a contentious taxonomic issue, and
revision of this complex is needed. Similarly, a sister relationship between L. melanops and L. kuhli has been long
suggested (e.g.,[1,4,6,30,38-40]), as well as the close relationship of both to L. semiplumbeus [12], based on similarities of plumage and external morphology. However, their
close relationship to Buteo buteo is novel (see also [28]). In
our study, Buteo buteo represents a genus containing several species of North American and Old World hawks (see
[7]), and the nested position of this species within the
Neotropical buteonines corroborates Amadon's [4]
hypothesis of Neotropical origins for the entire buteonine
lineage. The polyphyly of Buteo species in our study corroborates the results of Riesing et al. [7].
Our study includes all recognized Leucopternis species and
represents the largest Neotropical buteonine taxonomic
sample investigated to date. The polyphyly of Leucopternis,
Buteogallus and Buteo indicates that current taxonomy
does not reflect the phylogenetic history of the group.
Only a complete buteonine phylogeny is likely to provide
sufficient guidance regarding the nomenclatural issues
concerning Buteo, Leucopternis, Buteogallus and Harpyhaliaetus, as well as fine scale biogeographic inferences. The
predominantly black and white plumage pattern shared
by several Leucopternis species (L. polionotus, L. occidentalis,
L. lacernulatus, L. melanops, L. kuhli, L. semiplumbeus, L.
albicollis, L. princeps) has evolved at least twice (figure 2),
and the widespread occurrence of this pattern may result
from plumage convergence in forested habitats. Similarly,

Page 5 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:10

L. plumbeus and L. schistaceus posses a slate plumage pattern very similar to that of Rostrhamus species, and all
those species are associated with riparian habitats both
within (L. schistaceus, L. plumbeus, R. hamatus) and outside
forests (R. sociabilis). In order to test the hypothesis that
the slate plumage results from selection in riparian habitats, additional analysis including Rostrhamus species is
required. It has been shown that plumage characters
under strong selection may evolve rapidly [41], and in
some cases may represent evolutionary convergence
instead of reflecting shared phylogenetic or phylogeographic history [42]. An overemphasis on the black and
white plumage pattern influenced the grouping of Leucopternis species, and more generally our results indicate that
plumage patterns alone may not be reliable taxonomic
markers among Accipitridae species.
Biogeography and habitat shifts
We can confidently reject the reciprocal monophyly of cisand trans-Andean distributed buteonines (figure 2). At
least three cis-trans (east-west) disjunctions were identified in all phylogenetic trees inferred from the combined
dataset: (1) L. semiplumbeus (trans-) versus its Amazonian
(cis-) sister clade, L. melanops plus L. kuhli, (2) L. polionotus
(cis-) versus the two sampled subspecies of L. albicollis plus
L. occidentalis (trans-), and (3) L. plumbeus (trans-) and the
rest of Clade 1 (mostly cis-Andean, but with Buteogallus
species occurring on both sides). The uncertain position
of L. princeps may hide a possible fourth disjunction.
Three major hypothesis have been suggested to explain
the differentiation of ancestral populations into cis- and
trans-Andean lineages: the Andean Uplift Hypothesis [43],
advocating separation of populations on either side of the
mountains as a consequence of Andean orogeny; the
Across Andes Dispersal Hypothesis [43-45] proposing
long distance dispersal across the Andes as the cause of
diversification, and the Forest Refugia Hypothesis, with
historical expansions and contractions of forest corridors
that linked forested lowlands on either side of the Andes
[45] (see Brumfield and Capparella [46], Ribas et al. [47]).
Lack of fossil calibrations for raptors, as well as rejection
of clock-like evolution for the ATP8 and ATP6 dataset
using a likelihood ratio test (data not shown) precluded
calculation of divergence times for the hawk species analyzed here, and thus without a temporal framework we are
unable to reject any of the Andean biogeography hypotheses based solely on mtDNA phylogenetic inference.

Few geographic barriers besides the Andes seem to define
ranges of Neotropical buteonine species. The Amazon
River has been suggested to delineate the distributions of
terra-firme forest species [48,49], and may have played a
role in the separation of L. melanops and L. kuhli north and
south of the river, respectively (see [40]). However, there
are recent and historical records of sympatry between L.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/10

melanops and L. kuhli, with observations of both species
south of the Amazon River (Barlow et al. [50], Amaral et
al. pers. obs.). Because of this fact it would appear that the
Amazon River does not currently impose a strong barrier
blocking L. melanops from occupying southern Amazon
forests.
The putative contraction and expansion of lowland tropical forests associated with climate change has been promoted as one of the factors that explain avian areas of
endemism (see [51] for limits and details on those areas),
but most Neotropical buteonine species have geographic
ranges that cross many of the proposed areas. Nonetheless, one might posit that the two Atlantic forest endemics,
L. lacernulatus and L. polionotus represent species formed
by the contraction and isolation of forest fragments during glacial episodes, but the mtDNA phylogenetic tree
establishes that they are not sister species (Figure 1). The
distant phylogenetic separation of these two Leucopternis
species supports the proposal that the Atlantic Forest biota
has complex origins [52].
Our mtDNA-based phylogenetic analysis of Neotropical
buteonines (figure 2) also permits strong inference that
forest and open-vegetation species are not reciprocally
monophyletic. Furthermore, ecological shifts between
forest and non-forest habitats occurred early and late in
the Neotropical buteonine diversification. The phylogenetic tree presented in Figure 2 indicates that separation of
the open-vegetation Buteo albicaudatus from Leucopternis
forest species occurred early in the radiation compared to
the more recent divergence of Buteogallus meridionalis from
L. lacernulatus and Parabuteo unicinctus from Buteo leucorrhous. The geographic and altitudinal distributions of
these more recently derived sister pairs overlap greatly,
but the sister species occupy different habitats, either
open-country or forest. This same pattern is reflected in
the sister relationship between Harpyhaliaetus coronatus
(savannah) and Harpyhaliaetus solitarius (forest, unavailable for this study) [28], although these species do not
overlap much in their ranges.
Habitat shifts between sister species or groups of closely
related species have been poorly explored in studies of
avian historical biogeography in the Neotropics, mainly
due to the predominance of forest lowland bird species in
such studies (but see Garcia-Moreno and Cardoso da Silva
[53] and Ribas et al. [54]). The pattern of habitat shifts
between sister pairs can be consistent with both allopatric
(Theory of Vanishing Refuges [55]) and parapatric models
of speciation (Gradient Hypothesis [22]). Occurrence of
parapatric speciation and divergence with gene flow has
been a controversial issue (see Brown [56], Cracraft and
Prum [57]), but explicit tests with vertebrates [58-61],
including birds [62] have pointed to patterns consistent

with between-habitat divergence in the presence of gene
flow in tropical habitats. High mobility due to soaring
and gliding flight, occurrence of several species in ecotones, and the pattern of sister relationships between forest and non-forest species suggest that buteonine species
offer future opportunities to test alternative models of
diversification in the Neotropics using phylogeographic
data.
The determination of geographically structured areas of
endemism in the Neotropics [51,63] has promoted allopatry as the principal mode of speciation in the Neotropics, with the Andean orogeny, rivers, and changes in forest
cover serving as the principal vicariant events separating
populations. Accumulation of phylogenetic and phylogeographic data for Neotropical birds suggests that the process of diversification is more complex [e. g. [42,64]], and
that parapatric and sympatric models of speciation must
be properly tested [19,23,58-62]. The family Accipitridae
is extensively represented in most Neotropical habitats,
and offers opportunities to explore the radiation of an
ecologically diverse group with high dispersal capabilities.
Further phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies of
diurnal raptors, as well as other groups representing varying degrees of vagility and occurrence in habitats other
than forests, will permit more explicit tests of the role of
alternative modes of speciation acting on Neotropical
birds, and refinement of general explanations for the origin and maintenance of Neotropical biodiversity.

Conclusion
Our mtDNA-based inference of Neotropical buteonine
phylogeny establishes a polyphyletic relationship among

the hawk genera Leucopternis, Buteogallus and Buteo. Thus
the phylogeny indicates that the current taxonomy of the
Accipitridae is not a good guide to the evolutionary relationships of species in the group, and identifies a need for
further systematic analysis of the family at all taxonomic
levels. We do not propose nomenclatural modifications,
since only a complete buteonine analysis would permit
such taxonomic changes. Nonetheless, our results coupled to earlier work predict some of the nomenclatural
changes that will undoubtedly be forthcoming, and also
establish that plumage has been overemphasized in defining the taxonomy of the Accipitridae. Finally, we conclude
that shifts between forest and non-forest habitats, as well
as movement across the Andes, have occurred more than
once during the Neotropical buteonine diversification.

Methods
Taxon sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and
sequencing
We sampled a total of 31 specimens, comprising all 10
recognized species of the genus Leucopternis (L. lacernulatus, L. polionotus, L. semiplumbeus, L. plumbeus, L. occidentalis, L. schistaceus, L. princeps, L. melanops, L. kuhli, L.
albicollis), and including two sub-species of L. albicollis (L.
a. costaricensis and L. a. ghiesbreghti), as well as almost all
Neotropical buteonine genera (representing 15 of the 21
species of the Neotropical "sub-buteonines" sensu Amadon [4]), plus four Buteo species. We chose Geranospiza
caerulescens as an outgroup based on a recent higher-level
analysis of Accipitridae [28]. When possible, we included
two individuals per taxon. Nomenclature follows the
South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithologists' Union [65]. Sequences of Buteo buteo

were obtained from Genbank [NC_003128]. Tissue,
feather and blood samples were obtained from specimens
collected in the field, museum tissue collections, and captive birds (see Additional file 1: Table 1). Known localities
of origin, feathers and photographs are available for most
captive specimens.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing were performed at the Universidade de São Paulo (Brazil), the
Smithsonian Tropical Institute (Panama) and the Royal
Ontario Museum (Canada) based on earlier protocols
[66]. DNA extraction followed Bruford et al. [67], or via
the DNeasy kit (Qiagen); for feather samples, we added
30 ug of dithiothreitol to the digestion buffer. We
sequenced four mitochondrial genes: a portion of the 12S
ribosomal RNA gene (12S, longest sequence of 833 bp),
the complete ATP synthase F0 subunit 8 (ATP8, 168 bp)
and subunit 6 (ATP6, 684 bp) genes, as well as the complete NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6, 519 bp)
using several primer pair combinations via polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) (table 2). In few cases, weak amplification products were re-amplified using internal primers. Both strands of the amplified products were
sequenced.
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple strands obtained for each specimen were assembled in CodonCode Aligner v. 1.3.4 (CodonCode Corporation) or Sequencher v. 4 (Gene Codes Corporation).
Contigs were exported and alignment performed in Clustal X 1.83 [68] with default parameters. The 12S alignment had 21 indels, which consisted mostly of
autapomorphies and sites of ambiguous alignment; these
were removed from all analyses. All single marker and
combined datasets were tested for significant departures
from average base frequencies with PAUP* 4b10 [69],
using only variable sites. Uncorrected codon-based
(ATP8, ATP6, ND6) and total (12S) transition and transversion distances were plotted against Kimura-2-parameters distances using the software Dambe v4.2 [70] to
evaluate the effect of multiple substitutions in each dataset. We implemented a partition homogeneity test in
PAUP*, using only variable sites with 1000 replicates with
random additions, to evaluate the congruence of the phylogenetic signal between the different genes. Because the
latter test did not detect significantly-different phylogenetic signal among the partitions (P = 0.29), all four genes
were combined into a single combined dataset. Separated
analyses of subsets of single gene region were also performed to evaluate the concordance among those datasets. The ATP8 and ATP6 genes overlap by 10 bp; however
in all phylogenetic analyses of the combined dataset and
the single gene region of ATP (subunit 8 plus subunit 6)
this region was considered only once. We performed phylogenetic reconstructions using maximum likelihood

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/10

(ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) implemented in
PAUP*, and Bayesian analysis (BA) with MrBayes v3.1.1
[71], to evaluate the concordance of topologies obtained
under different optimization criteria. ML and MP heuristic
searches were performed using 1000 and 10 random additions of sequences, respectively. Nonparametric bootstrapping was performed to assess branch support (100
replicates with single random additions for the ML analysis and 1,000 replicates with 10 random additions for the
MP analysis). Modeltest v3.7 [72] was used to choose
among evolutionary models of DNA substitution for ML
and BA analyses using a hierarchical likelihood ratio test.
Modeltest determined that the TrN+I+G model was the
best fit for the total dataset with base frequencies of A =
0.3217, C = 0.3521, G = 0.1235, T = 0.2027, a gamma
shape parameter of 1.0617 and proportion of invariable
sites of 0.5631. The BA analyses of the combined dataset
was run with individual likelihood for each of the three
gene regions (12S, ATP 6 and ATP 8, and ND6) as selected
by Modeltest (TrN+I+G, HKY+I+G, TrN+G), which were
the same models used for subset ML and BA analyses.
MrBayes was run with four chains for 4,000,000 generations with trees sampled every 100 generations, replicated
four times. All runs reached stationarity around 400 sampled generations, so we discarded the first 40000 generations as a "burnin"; a consensus topology was created
with all the remaining sampled generations.
To determine whether our data support monophyly of
Leucopternis, monophyly of forest species, monophyly of
species presenting black and white plumage patterns, or
reciprocal monophyly of trans- and cis-Andean species, we
compared alternative constraint topologies to the ML tree
using the nonparametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [73]
implemented in PAUP*. Ancestral states of habitat and
general plumage pattern (according to Thiollay [1], Fergusson-Lees and Christie [6] and Sibley and Monroe [39])
were mapped onto the ML tree inferred from the combined dataset using unordered parsimony in Mesquite
v1.05 [74].
