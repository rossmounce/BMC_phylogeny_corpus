Abstract
Background: Vaccinia virus (VACV)-DUKE was isolated from a lesion on a 54 year old female
who presented to a doctor at the Duke University Medical Center. She was diagnosed with
progressive vaccinia and treated with vaccinia immune globulin. The availability of the VACV-DUKE
genome sequence permits a first time genomic comparison of a VACV isolate associated with a
smallpox vaccine complication with the sequence of culture-derived clonal isolates of the Dryvax
vaccine.
Results: This study showed that VACV-DUKE is most similar to VACV-ACAM2000 and
CLONE3, two VACV clones isolated from the Dryvax® vaccine stock confirming VACV-DUKE as
an isolate from Dryvax®. However, VACV-DUKE is unique because it is, to date, the only Dryvax®
clone isolated from a patient experiencing a vaccine-associated complication. The 199,960 bp
VACV-DUKE genome encodes 225 open reading frames, including 178 intact genes and 47 gene
fragments. Between VACV-DUKE and the other Dryvax® isolates, the major genomic differences
are in fragmentation of the ankyrin-like, and kelch-like genes, presence of a full-length Interferonα/β receptor gene, and the absence of a duplication of 12 ORFs in the inverted terminal repeat.
Excluding this region, the DNA sequence of VACV-DUKE differs from the other two Dryvax®
isolates by less than 0.4%. DNA sequencing also indicated that there was little heterogeneity in the
sample, supporting the hypothesis that virus from an individual lesion is clonal in origin despite the
fact that the vaccine is a mixed population.
Conclusion: Virus in lesions that result from progressive vaccinia following vaccination with
Dryvax are likely clonal in origin. The genomic sequence of VACV-DUKE is overall very similar to
that of Dryvax® cell culture-derived clonal isolates. Furthermore, with the sequences of multiple
clones from Dryvax® we can begin to appreciate the diversity of the viral population in the smallpox
vaccine.

Background
The highly lethal disease smallpox is caused by Variola
virus (VARV), a member of the Orthopoxvirus (OPV) genus
of the family Poxviridae. Smallpox was declared eradicated
in 1980 following a global vaccination program launched
by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. Dryvax®,
the smallpox vaccine used in the US, played a key role in
this global vaccination campaign. Dryvax® was produced
by collecting the lymph from bovine calves or sheep following skin scarification with Vaccinia virus (VACV), and
isolating the virus, a procedure that is no longer approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This produced a mixed population of viruses since no attempt was
made to clonally purify the inoculum. By today's standards, Dryvax® has a high incidence of unacceptable side
effects, especially considering the current low risk of VARV
infection that could only result from an accidental release
from the repositories at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA) or Vector Institute
(Russia), or intentional release as a biological weapon.
However, as a result of the immunogenic cross-reactivity
characteristic of the OPVs, Dryvax® is also useful as a vaccine against monkeypox virus (MPXV), which causes a
smallpox-like disease in humans but with a lower mortality rate and limited human-to-human transmission [2-4].
A recent outbreak of MPXV in the Midwestern U.S.A.
forced world health authorities to recognize that this disease is not limited to remote areas of Africa [5,6].
Although a limited quantity of aging stocks of Dryvax®
appeared efficacious in recent clinical trials [7,8], they
were insufficient to vaccinate the majority of the American
population. Therefore a new smallpox vaccine derived
from Dryvax® is being manufactured to meet current FDA
regulations for potency and composition using tissue culture cell methodology. Because Dryvax® contains a mixture of viruses with different virulence characteristics [9],
the new vaccine was based on the isolation and comparison of clones isolated from Dryvax®. VACV-ACAM2000
and VACV-CLONE3 are two of six clones isolated from
Dryvax® which have been fully sequenced and compared
in animal models of infection [10,11]. In animal infection
models, VACV-CLONE3 was shown to be more virulent
than VACV-ACAM2000 and Dryvax® [10,11] and consequently VACV-ACAM2000 was selected for further trials
with the hope that it would be licensed as a second-generation smallpox vaccine. Although phase II trials showed
no significant differences in side effects between VACVACAM2000 and Dryvax® [12], myopericarditis (swelling
of the heart muscle) was reported in the third stage of
clinic trials of VACV-ACAM2000, and the trial was halted
[13].
Vaccinia virus VACV-DUKE was isolated in December
1970 from a 54-year-old female patient in the eastern US

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/88

diagnosed with vaccinia necrosum. The virus is thought to
have been isolated from a single skin crusted lesion, but
the source may have been as many as four lesions. In this
study, we present the sequence of the complete coding
region of the VACV-DUKE genome. Although other
clones derived from Dryvax® have been sequenced, VACVDUKE is unique in being the only completely sequenced
Dryvax® isolate obtained from a human source. Detailed
analysis of its nucleotide sequence and gene content contribute to our knowledge of the population diversity of
Dryvax®, and the lack of sequence heterogeneity suggests a
single clonal lesion source.

Results
Overview
The 199,960 bp VACV-DUKE coding region was assembled from 1891 readings of 441 bp average length and
4.17-fold redundancy. Like other OPVs, VACV-DUKE is
AT rich (66.6%) and the genome can be divided into a
central region of 174,892 bp, and two inverted terminal
repeat (ITR) regions of 12,534 bp at each end of the
genome (1-12,534, 187,427-199,960). There are two
direct repeats (DR) in each ITR (DR1 and DR2 in the left
ITR, DR3 and DR4 in the right ITR). DR1/DR4 has a calculated 19 copies of a 70 bp tandem repeat element with
a single nucleotide variation in different copies: the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, and 5th copy of DR1/DR4 lack the 42nd A of the
repeat element. However, the exact sequence of all copies
is not known; since the repeat region was too large to
sequence through in two opposing reads, only 6 of the 19
copies have been fully sequenced. This tandem repeat element is identical to the 70 bp tandem repeat in VACVACAM2000 and VACV-CLONE3. DR2/DR3 contains 9
copies of a 54-bp tandem repeat element that is also identical to the 54 bp tandem repeat element found in VACVACAM2000 and VACV-CLONE3.

225 non-overlapping ORFs were initially detected in
VACV-DUKE. Comparative analyses with other poxviruses resulted in the assignment of these ORFs to 178 fulllength, probably functional genes, and 47 gene fragments
that most likely do not direct the expression of functional
gene products (Figure 1) [also see Additional file 1]. Similar to other OPVs, the genes are located on both strands
of the linear dsDNA genome with very small intergenic
regions, and the majority of genes present within 50 kb of
each terminus are transcribed towards that end of the
genome. Three full-length genes and 5 fragmented regions
are duplicated in the ITRs [see Additional file 1]. In addition, the Serine Protease Inhibitor (SPI) gene in the right
ITR (ORF 213) is partially duplicated in the left ITR (ORF
13). However, it is not obvious if the deletion of the 5' end
of ORF 213 results in a truncated protein because the
actual translational start site for the gene is not known.
VACV-DUKE possesses all 49 genes that comprise the

minimum essential genome conserved among all completely sequenced poxviruses and the 89 genes conserved
in all OPVs [14].
Phylogenetic analysis
To confirm the origin of VACV-DUKE as an isolate of Dryvax®, we performed phylogenetic analysis using the central
82 kb (nt 58159 to nt 139791 of VACV-DUKE) that is
present in all completely sequenced OPVs. In this region
at the nucleotide level VACV-DUKE is most similar to
VACV-ACAM2000 (99.75% identical) and most distant
from Ectromelia virus (ECTV; 97.46%). The phylogenetic
tree (Figure 2) clearly indicates that VACV-DUKE is closely
related to other Dryvax® isolates.

Comparison of VACV-DUKE, VACV-CLONE3 and VACVACAM2000
We analyzed both the gross and minor differences
between these three Dryvax® isolates to survey the diversity of the vaccine preparation. An alignment of the complete coding regions of VACV-CLONE3, VACVACAM2000 (GenBank accession AY313848 and
AY313847, and Joe Esposito, personal communication)
and VACV-DUKE demonstrates that they are highly conserved except in the region from VACV-DUKE-nt 18,4997
to nt 18,7423 (Figure 3). The interferon (IFN)-α/β receptor gene (ORF 210) is complete in VACV-DUKE and
VACV-CLONE3, but is truncated in VACV-ACAM2000 as
a result of a deletion of approximately 4 kb compared to
VACV-CLONE3 [see Additional file 1] (Figure 3). The
ankyrin-like gene (ORF 211; ortholog of VARV-BSHB18R) is complete in VACV-CLONE3 but truncated in
VACV-DUKE and absent from VACV-ACAM2000. The

truncation in VACV-DUKE is the result of a deletion of
approximately 2 kb relative to VACV-CLONE3 that also
deletes a portion of the kelch-like gene (ORF 212). The
kelch-like gene, which is complete only in ECTV and
CPXV, is fragmented into 3 pieces in VACV-CLONE3, and
only the third part is present in VACV-DUKE. Finally, 12
genes and gene fragments are duplicated in the left and
right ITRs of VACV-ACAM2000 whereas they are present
as a single copy in the left ITR of VACV-DUKE and VACVCLONE3.
Other major gene differences are present [see Additional
file 1]. ORF 188 in VACV-CLONE3, (Unknown function,
VACV-COP-A51R ortholog), is fragmented in VACVDUKE (ORFs 185 and 186) and in VACV-ACAM2000

(ORFs 185 and 186) as a result of a 4 bp deletion that
causes a frameshift. In addition to the IFN-α/β receptor,
VACV-DUKE has two other genes that are full length but
are fragmented in at least one other Dryvax® isolate: the
ortholog of VACV-DUKE-ORF 39 (Ankyrin, VACV-COPM1L ortholog) is fragmented in VACV-CLONE3 as a result
of a frameshift caused by a 2 bp deletion, and the ortholog
of VACV-DUKE-ORF 69 (virosome component) is fragmented in both VACV-CLONE3 and VACV-ACAM2000 as
a result of an 11 bp deletion resulting in a frameshift.
VACV-DUKE-ORF 177 (Unknown function, MVA-156R
ortholog) is identical in VACV-CLONE3 but deleted in
VACV-ACAM2000. VACV-ACAM2000 ORFs 195 and 196
are fragments of the ECTV-MOS-153 ortholog, however,
VACV-ACAM2000 ORF 196 is 140 and 142 amino acids

Page 4 of 9

Virology Journal 2006, 3:88

shorter than the orthologs in VACV-DUKE (ORF 194) and
VACV-CLONE3 (ORF 196), respectively. Finally, VACVACAM2000 encodes 3 proteins that compared to VACVDUKE and VACV-CLONE3, are truncated by at least 20
amino acids [thymidylate kinase (DUKE ORF-182),
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor homolog (DUKE
ORF 188), and the ortholog of VACV-COP-B11R (DUKE
ORF 202)].
On the nucleotide level, there are a total of 689 insertions/
deletions (indels) and substitutions between VACVDUKE and VACV-CLONE3, and 664 between VACVDUKE and VACV-ACAM2000 (Figure 3B). Although there
are more indels and substitutions in coding regions
between VACV-DUKE and VACV-ACAM2000 (534) than
between VACV-DUKE and VACV-CLONE3 (495), these
result in only a total of 182 and 180 amino acid changes,
respectively, indicating that the proteomes of the three
viruses are highly similar. The largest amino acid difference between a single full-length ORF is between VACVDUKE ORF 19 and VACV-CLONE3-ORF 19, the IL-18
binding protein, with 89.5% identity. For comparison,
there are 892 indels and more than 1000 substitutions
between VACV-DUKE and VACV-COP. Comparing only
the 174 shared full-length gene sequences, VACV-DUKE
and COP have lower identity (98.84%) than VACV-DUKE
and VACV-CLONE3 (99.49%) or VACV-DUKE and
VACV-ACAM2000 (99.59%), showing the three Dryvax®
isolates are more closely related.
The ankyrin-like gene (VARV-BSH-B18R ortholog) is
intact in VACV-CLONE3 but encodes only a 242 amino
acid C-terminal fragment in VACV-DUKE (ORF 211) and
is totally absent from VACV-ACAM2000. This ORF is
intact in CPXVs, VARVs, MPXVs, RPXV (encoding 783–
800 amino acid proteins), and truncated in other OPVs
(650–661amino acids). The function of this protein is
unknown, however, some features are apparent from its
sequence. As in many ankyrin-repeat containing proteins
in poxviruses there is an F-box motif in the C terminus
that has been shown in other proteins to play a role in the
ubiquitination pathway [15]. Although the F-box is not
conserved in VACV-DUKE, the remaining fragment
encoding the ankyrin repeat is intact. There are numerous
ankyrin repeat-containing proteins in poxviruses, only a
few of which have been explored for function [16,17].
ORF 212 (kelch-like gene) is full length in CPXV and
ECTV (ECTV-MOS-167) and fragmented into three pieces
in VACV-CLONE3, only the third of which is present in
VACV-DUKE. This fragment is also present in VACV-WR
and MPXV. The gene is absent from VACV-ACAM2000,
and fragmented or absent from other OPVs. The function
of this gene is unknown, and the conserved fragment does
not contain a kelch-like domain (only the first two frag-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/88

ments have this domain). The fragmented gene is not
expected to be functional.

Discussion
VACV-DUKE is unique in that it was recovered from a
patient suffering from a vaccine-related complication. It is
not known if the patient was vaccinated, or became
infected following contact with a vaccinated individual.
The immune status of the individual is not known, thus
the underlying basis for the clinical findings is not clear. It
is possible that the patient was immunosuppressed and
vaccination resulted in dissemination of the virus, and
disease. Furthermore, because virus was isolated from
only one or a few lesions it is not known how the
sequence of VACV-DUKE would compare to virus isolated
from other lesions. This could provide insight into the
properties of the viruses that disseminate and cause disease in vaccine-related complications. The method used
for sequencing (sequencing of PCR products generated
directly from genomic DNA) without plaque purification
of virus, yielded a single genomic sequence, indicating
that a single genome is present in the sample, or that if
other genome sequences are present, they are found at a
frequency too low to be captured by the initial PCR and
sequencing reaction. Because of this lack of heterogeneity
in the data, this study suggests that an individual lesion is
the result of replication of a single clone from the mixed
population of virus delivered at the inoculation site.
Although this result is not surprising, it has not been previously formally demonstrated. In addition, genomic
characterization of this virus permits further analysis of
the population diversity in Dryvax® and indicates that
both nucleotide level and larger genomic differences exist
in the vaccine.
In addition to host factors such as immune status, vaccine
side effects may be due to specific, more pathogenic, virus
genotypes present in the mixed population, or a result of
a combination of multiple genotypes. Differences in pathogenicity between VACV isolates could be attributed to
the presence or absence of a single gene, multiple genes,
point mutations within genes or even changes in promoter sequences, causing differences in expression levels
of virulence factors. The virulence of VACV-DUKE has not
yet been tested in mice, and it is not clear, based on the
limited information available about the patient from
which it was isolated, how virulent it is likely to be in
humans. It will be necessary to perform further experiments to determine the virulence of VACV-DUKE in animals to form a better understanding of the contribution of
small or large genomic differences between viruses to
pathogenicity.
The most striking region of difference between the
genomes of the three Dryvax® isolates occurs near the right

ITR. Three genes are affected: the IFN-α/β receptor gene,
the ankyrin (VARV-BSH-B18R) homolog, and the kelchlike gene, ORF 212. The IFN-α/β receptor has three immunoglobulin domains that bind host IFN-α/β with high
affinity and broad species specificity, although binding
affinity for human IFN-α is significantly greater than for
mouse IFN-α [18]. While both VACV-DUKE and VACVCLONE3 have an intact IFN-α/β receptor gene, a DNA
deletion in VACV-ACAM2000 results in a C-terminal 90
amino acid truncation, effectively eliminating the third
immunoglobulin domain. It is expected that the VACVACAM2000 expressed protein would bind the ligand with
reduced affinity similar to the ortholog expressed by
VACV-Wyeth that also has a truncated C-terminal immu-

noglobulin domain and binds IFN with lower affinity
[18]. Deletion of the IFN-α/β receptor homolog in VACVWR results in significant attenuation in an intranasal
model of infection in mice [19]. Because of its demonstrated role in virulence, it is possible that the presence of
the full length gene in VACV-CLONE3 contributes to its
greater pathogenicity compared to VACV-ACAM2000,
and may also contribute to pathogenicity of VACV-DUKE.
The fact that VACV-DUKE contains a full-length copy of a
known virulence factor, while not all viruses in the population do (as evidenced by the culture-derived isolate
VACV-ACAM2000), suggests the possibility that this gene
contributed greater virulence to VACV-DUKE and played

a role in its dissemination from the original site of inoculation.

position covered by at least one high-quality sequence
read in each direction.

The functions of the ankyrin homolog and the kelch-like
gene are unknown, and their contribution to virulence has
not been determined in any poxviruses. Kelch is a 50
amino acid domain, often found in a series of repeats, in
numerous cellular proteins of diverse functions; the
domain is present in multiple poxvirus proteins. The
ankyrin repeat is a 33 amino acid domain and is one of
the most common protein-protein interaction domains
and is found in functionally diverse proteins. Because of
the ubiquity of these protein domains, their simple presence does not provide significant clues as to the function
or importance of these deleted genes in viral virulence.

Regions of heterogeneity
Three regions were cloned for sequencing due to heterogeneity at single nucleotide positions in the genome-derived
PCR products. In the first, at nucleotide 12344, 2 of 10
clones contained G, and 8 contained A, therefore we
report an A in the final genome. The second position with
heterogeneity is found in the 3rd copy of DR1 and DR4 in
the ITR region at each end of genome: in the left ITR, 2 out
of 12 clones lacked the 42nd A and in the right ITR, 10 out
of 12 clones lack the 42nd T. To keep the sequence consistent between the left and right ITR, we report no 42nd A/T
in the 3rd copy of DR1/DR4 in both ITR in the final
sequence.

Another major difference among these three isolates, is
the presence of an additional 6 kb of DNA in the right ITR
of VACV-ACAM2000 compared to VACV-DUKE or VACVCLONE3, which results in a duplication of 12 ORFs. These
ORFs are present as a single copy in the left ITR of VACVDUKE and VACV-CLONE3. Four of these are full length,
and the others are gene fragments. The significance of
gene duplication in OPVs is not known.

Conclusion
The genomic sequence VACV-DUKE, a Dryvax® isolate
derived from a patient experiencing vaccine related complications, is overall very similar to that of Dryvax® cell culture-derived clonal isolates. While some major genomic
differences exist between isolates, it remains to be determined if these differences, or smaller, nucleotide-level differences are responsible for variation in pathogenicity and
contribution to vaccine side effects With the sequences of
multiple clones from Dryvax® we can begin to appreciate
the diversity of the viral population in the smallpox vaccine.

Methods
Cells and viruses and DNA sequencing
VACV-DUKE was obtained from the WHO Collaborating
Center for Smallpox and other Poxvirus Infections at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta, GA.
Virus was identified after two passages on chick chorioallantoic membrane and then cultured in two successive
passages in BSC-40 cells in RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 2% fetal bovine serum. Standard procedures were
used for isolation of viral DNA, and the sequencing strategy that was used has been previously described [20]. The
entire VACV-DUKE genome was divided into 19 overlapping fragments. Each fragment was amplified using the
Expand-Long Template PCR System (Roche) from
genomic DNA, and sequenced using a bank of sequencing
primers. The final consensus DNA sequence represented
an average 4.17-fold redundancy with each nucleotide

Direct repeats
DR1/DR4 in the ITRs is composed of tandem repeats of 70
nt length and was too long to sequence through. To estimate the number of repeats we cloned the region including DR1 and analyzed the size by agarose gel
electrophoresis. Based on the size, 19 copies of the repeat
are present.
Assembly and annotation
Assembly of the raw sequence data was performed using
the Staden software package on a Linux platform [21].
Raw data was processed using Pregap4 and a consensus
sequence was assembled and edited using Gap4 [22-24].
Gaps were closed using primers based on the assembled
contigs. An ORF was defined as a continuous stretch of
DNA that can be translated into a polypeptide that is initiated by a methione residue and extended for at least 60
residues prior to a termination codon (TGA, TAA or TAG).
ARTEMIS [25], Poxvirus Orthologous Clusters database
(POCs) [14,26], BLASTP [27] were used to detect and
annotate ORFs. For some ORFs, BLASTN and BLASTP
searches were carried out at the NCBI website [27]. Viral
Genome Organizer (VGO) software [28] was used to analyze the position and arrangement of genes. NAP [29] was
used to compare the nucleotide sequence of the fragmented ORF regions of VACV-DUKE against the corresponding longest protein sequence encoded by
orthologous chordopoxvirus (ChPV) genes. Base-By-Base
(BBB) software [30] was used to calculate the indels and
substitutions among VACV-DUKE, CLONE3 and VACVACAM2000. Motifscan against Prosite and Pfam collection [31,32] were used to analyze protein structure and
features.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using an alignment
of an 82 kb central region of the genome conserved
among all completely sequenced OPVs. JDotter software

Resource Center [34,35] were used to generate dotplots
between VACV-DUKE and the other OPVs to determine
the borders of the corresponding conserved DNA
sequences in the different OPVs. ClustalW 1.83 [36] was
used to align the sets of DNA and protein sequences followed by manual correction in BBB. Njplot [37] on a
Linux platform and Treeview software [38] on a Windows
platform were used to construct a phylogenetic tree with
bootstrapping.
