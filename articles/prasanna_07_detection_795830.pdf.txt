Abstract
Background: Tomato-infecting begomoviruses are widely distributed across the world and cause
diseases of high economic impact on wide range of agriculturally important crops. Though
recombination plays a pivotal role in diversification and evolution of these viruses, it is currently
unknown whether there are differences in the number and quality of recombination events
amongst different tomato-infecting begomovirus species. To examine this we sought to
characterize the recombination events, estimate the frequency of recombination, and map
recombination hotspots in tomato-infecting begomoviruses of South and Southeast Asia.
Results: Different methods used for recombination breakpoint analysis provided strong evidence
for presence of recombination events in majority of the sequences analyzed. However, there was
a clear evidence for absence or low Recombination events in viruses reported from North India.
In addition, we provide evidence for non-random distribution of recombination events with the
highest frequency of recombination being mapped in the portion of the N-terminal portion of Rep.
Conclusion: The variable recombination observed in these viruses signified that all begomoviruses
are not equally prone to recombination. Distribution of recombination hotspots was found to be
reliant on the relatedness of the genomic region involved in the exchange. Overall the frequency
of phylogenetic violations and number of recombination events decreased with increasing parental
sequence diversity. These findings provide valuable new information for understanding the diversity
and evolution of tomato-infecting begomoviruses in Asia.

Background
Begomoviruses are an important group of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) transmitted viruses in the family Geminiviridae.
They inflict significant economic losses in many dicotyledonous crops including beans, cassava, cotton, melon,
pepper, potato and tomato [1-7]. Tomato yellow leaf curl
virus (TYLCV) and Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV) are the
begomoviruses severely constraining tomato production
in many tomato-growing regions of the world.

Begomovirus genomes are composed of either one (monopartite) or two (bipartite) single stranded DNA molecules ranging in size between 2500 and 2800 nucleotides
[8]. Most TYLCV of the old world and almost all known
new world begomoviruses viruses are bipartite with
genomes comprising DNA A and DNA B molecules. Monopartite old world begomoviruses, which are now
believed to be the predominant begomovirus form, have
only a DNA-A like genome component. The virion-sense
strand of DNA A encodes the viral coat protein (AV1, V1

or cp) and, in old-world begomoviruses [9], an AV2 or V2
gene that is necessary for virus accumulation and symptom development [10]. The complementary-sense strand
of DNA-A encodes genes responsible for viral replication
(AC1, C1 or rep), replication enhancer (AC3, C3 or ren),
regulation of gene expression (AC2, C2 or trap) and AC4
or C4 involved in host range determination, symptom
determination, symptom severity, and virus movement
[11-13]. The DNA B of bipartite begomoviruses encodes
two proteins, BV1 (a nuclear shuttle protein or NS) and
BC1 (a movement protein or MP) involved in intra- and
inter-cellular movement within the plant [14].
Begomoviruses exhibit a great deal of geographic dependent but host-independent genomic variation [15-17].
Recombination, especially interspecific homologous
recombination, is a key contributor to the genomic diversification and evolution of begomoviruses [17]. To date,
many natural begomoviruses recombinants have been
reported [17-20]. Although the biological significance of
begomovirus recombination is not clearly understood, in
many parts of the world epidemics associated with the
emergence of recombinant begomoviruses have been
reported. These include the devastating cassava mosaic
disease epidemic caused by recombinant East African cassava mosaic viruses in Uganda and neighbouring countries [18,21], the currently emerging pathogenic
recombinant, tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus, in
Spain [22] and the cotton leaf curl disease epidemic in
Pakistan caused by a species complex including a variety
of mostly recombinant begomovirus species [23]. Besides
the apparent importance of recombination in begomovirus evolution the marks that it has left on currently sampled begomovirus genome sequences also have major
implications when we attempt to use these sequences to
infer the evolutionary histories of begomoviruses [24,25].
Consequently, the detailed characterization of recombination amongst tomato-infecting begomoviruses is a prerequisite for understanding how these important
pathogens are evolving.
Although a few specific recombination events have been
described so far in tomato-infecting begomoviruses [2629], a full accounting of recombinants, recombination
breakpoints and recombination hotspots in tomato begomovirus species and strains is lacking. For example, it is
currently unknown whether there are differences in the
number and quality of recombination events that are
occurring amongst different tomato infecting begomovirus species. It is also currently unknown whether
sequences in particular parts of the begomovirus genomes
are more or less exchangeable between different species
than sequences in other parts of these genomes. Such variations in recombination frequencies and patterns have
been clearly observed in RNA viruses [30]. In this study we

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/111

employ a variety of recombination analysis methods to
characterize recombination in South and Southeast Asian
tomato-infecting begomoviruses. We map recombination
hotspots and provide evidence that not all tomato-infecting begomoviruses are equally prone to recombination
and that specific characteristic of particular recombination events are reliant on both the relatedness of the
recombining viruses and the genomic region involved in
sequence exchanges

Results and discussion
In this study, we sought to characterise recombination in
South and Southeast Asian viruses using a different
approach to those used previously: (1) By studying a different set of viruses to those studied previously; (2) Making use of a combination of recombination analysis
methods that are both powerful and have low false positive rates; (3) by mapping and estimating the frequency of
recombination events in begomoviruses.
The neighbor-net analysis revealed clear evidence of phylogenetic conflicts within the analysed sequences (Fig. 1).
Notably, every sequence represented within the tree was
implicated as a potential recipient of horizontally
acquired sequences at some time in its evolutionary past.
Unsurprisingly, the PHI test strongly supported the presence of recombination in these sequences (p < 0.0001).
Different methods used for recombination breakpoint
analysis also provided strong evidence for presence of past
recombination events in most of the sequences analysed.
For each of the 32 potential recombinant sequences identified, possible breakpoint positions, sequence fragments
and parental genotypes are listed in Table 1. Tomato leaf
curl virus from the Philippines and ToLCBV, ToLCBV[Ban4] and ToLCBV-[Ban5] from Bangalore, south India
appeared to be the most complex recombinants carrying
evidence of seven and six recombination events respectively. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Tomato leaf
curl virus strains including ToLCNDV-Mld and ToLCNDV-[Luc] from New Delhi, ToLCNDV-Svr [Jes] from
Bangladesh, and TYLCCNV-Tb [Y38] from China each carried evidence of only a single recombination event. In
addition, viruses from geographically well separated
regions appeared to have recombined at some time in the
past. For example, tomato leaf curl virus strains from Bangalore and Gujarat in India contained sequences closely
resembling those found in a ToLCTWV isolate from Taiwan. Also, Chinese viruses contained fragments of
sequence closely resembling those found in sequences
sampled in Thailand, Taiwan, Bangladesh and South
India. Further, we used the TreeOrderScan method [31] to
investigate the phylogenetic evidence for recombination
in the sequence alignment. This analysis revealed major
deviations in the branching order of sequences within

trees constructed from different portions of the multiple
sequence alignment (Fig. 2). Frequent tree order changes
were observed at the region of rep and AC4. Importantly,
most of the viruses detected as recombinants in the breakpoint analysis exhibited deviations in their branching
order indicating that they were most likely correctly identified as recombinants. In addition, the TreeOrderScan
analysis also provided evidence for gene flow amongst
viruses in geographically separated regions. For instance,
sequences found in southern Indian viruses grouped with
those found in Thailand and Bangladesh virus positions
from 2335–2652. Thai viruses contained sequences
resembling those of Chinese viruses between 300–490
and 590–2372, but Indian viruses between 2472–2743.
The recombination observed between geographically separated species/strains probably represents older events as
they presumably occurred before their present separation
[19]. Movement of vectors and/or infected plant materials
may also have contributed to the gene flow observed
between these widely separated locations [32]. Alternatively, it is possible that current sampling of Asian bego-

movirus diversity is so sparse that we do not yet fully
appreciate the geographical range of many of the species
studied here.
Interestingly, our breakpoint analysis indicated that three
north Indian viruses (ToLCNDV-[PkT1/8], ToLCNDV-Svr
and ToLCNDV-[PkT5/6]) were not detectably recombinant and three other north Indian viruses namely ToLCNDV-Mld, ToLCNDV-[Luc] and ToLCNDV-[Luf] were
simple recombinants with only evidence of a single
detectable recombination event involving a virus resembling ToLCPV sampled in the Philippines. While TreeOrderScan analysis also revealed an absence of
recombination in two north Indian viruses, ToLCNDV[PkT1/8] and ToLCNDV-[Luf] (indicated by a horizontal
line across the graph in Fig. 2). In addition, there was no
phylogenetic support for inter-group recombination event
reported for ToLCNDV-[Luc]. Thus there appears to be no
or few recombination events in viruses reported from
North India, signifying that certain begomovirus species
may not recombine as readily as others. There are a

*The method in upper case is for the method identifying putative parent

number of prerequisites for recombination between begomoviruses. These include shared host ranges (possibly
influenced by the emergence of B whitefly biotype), the
ability to co-infect the same cells [33-35], high levels of
viral replication [36], and overlapping geographical
ranges. If all of these prerequisites are met for the tomatoinfecting begomoviruses in South and Southeast Asia then
one would expect there to be frequent and invariable
recombination amongst all of these viruses. However, fitness disadvantages may be associated with some sequence
exchanges that would lead to the selective elimination of
many newly produced recombinants.
The recombination sites distributed non-randomly along
the genome. The recombination breakpoints were
detected in all the six reading frames of south Indian
viruses and viruses from eastern and western India. The
breakpoints in the Chinese and Thai viruses were located

in AV1, AV2, AC1 and AC4, whereas ORFs AV1 and AV2
were identified to be cold spots in the Bangladeshi viruses.
The frequency and locations of recombination events
measured as topological differences between trees constructed from different parts of the alignment were visualised as a half-diagonal compatibility matrix (Fig. 3). Each
X and Y coordinate in the matrix is a gross estimate of the
number of topological modifications needed to convert
the tree constructed using sequences at position X into
that constructed using sequences at position Y [31,37]. It
was apparent from this matrix that recombination events
are probably not randomly distributed throughout begomovirus genomes. The highest frequency of recombination apparently occurs in the portion of the C1/AC1 ORF
encoding the N-terminal portion of Rep. For example, the
matrix indicates that there are an excess of 0.16 phylogeny
violations per clade when trees constructed using
sequences between alignment positions 351 and 1251 are

We examined phylogeny violations and number of
recombination events in our data set from the perspective
of parental sequence relatedness. We noted that in general
phylogeny violations clustered around the genetic distance 0.30. The observed frequency of phylogeny violations were inversely correlated (r = -0.36 p < 0.05) to the
pairwise distances of the fragments involved in exchange
(Fig. 4A). In addition, the number of recombination
events was also inversely correlated (r = -0.35 p < 0.05) to
the diversity between the exchanged fragments (Fig. 4B),
we used only identified parental sequences to estimate the
genetic distance between horizontally transferred fragments and the sequences that they replaced. Overall the
frequency of phylogenetic violations and number of
recombination events decreased with increasing parental
sequence diversity. In a study with artificial and natural
geminivirus recombinants Martin and co-workers [38]
demonstrated that the degree of similarity between a horizontally inherited sequence and the sequence it replaces
is an important determining factor of recombinant fitness.
Rather than the non-random distribution of break points
observed here being due to higher recombination rates in
some genome regions than others [39], the distribution
seems to have been created by natural selection only
allowing the survival of recombinants with high fitness. In
the more diverse genome regions where recombination
events are not detected it is possible that these regions
would not function properly when transferred into foreign genetic backgrounds.

Finally, the variable recombination and diversity-dependent distribution of recombination hotspots in tomatoinfecting begomoviruses is valuable new information that
has emerged from this study. Perhaps this is the first
report of variable recombination reported among tomatoinfecting begomoviruses found in the same region. Further, recombinant forms, recombination hot spots and
frequency of recombination documented in this study
would provide new information for understanding the
diversity and evolution of tomato-infecting begomoviruses in Asia. In addition to evolutionary considerations,
understanding the implications of recombination
observed in these viruses on efforts to develop resistant
tomatoes through conventional breeding and genetic
engineering are important and attempts should be
focused on these issues for developing effective disease
management strategies. Given that the N-terminal portion

of rep is highly recombinogenic it is perhaps worrying that
so many virus derived transgenic resistance strategies are
focusing on this portion of the geminivirus genome [4043]. It may be wiser to develop virus derived resistance
strategies using genome regions that are less recombinogenic as this will make it more difficult for viruses to overcome resistance by simply replacing targeted genome
regions with variants that are not targeted.

Methods
Sequence data
The study sequences comprised 35 publically available (as
on June 2006) complete Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Malaysian, Thai, Philippine and Taiwanese tomato-infecting begomovirus DNA-A and DNAA-like components (Table 2). These sequences were
aligned using the CLUSTAL W [44] using gap open and
extension penalties- of 10.
Phylogenetic network and pairwise homoplasy test
Phylogenetic evidence for recombination was detected
with Splits-Tree version 4.3 [45] using the neighbor-Net
method [46]. Neighbor-net depicts conflicting phylogenetic signals in the data that are caused by recombination
as cycles within unrooted bifurcating trees. Although, we
report evidence for reticulate evolution in such phylogenetic graphs obtained using parsimonious sites, pairwise
Hamming distances and no gaps, we obtained similar
results with other distance measures and settings.

We statistically verified the presence of recombination
identified visually in phylogenetic graphs using the pairwise homoplasy test (PHI) implemented in Splits Tree
4.3. PHI has been shown to powerfully identify the pres-

ence/absence of recombination within a wide range of
sequence samples with a low false positive rate [47].
Detection of recombination breakpoints
The recombination breakpoint analysis was carried out
using Recombination detection program RDP [48],
GENECONV [19] and MAXIMUM CHI SQUARE [49],
selected following the conclusions of studies on evaluation of different methods of recombination detection
[50,51]. All these methods are implemented in RDP2
[52,53]. Default RDP2 settings were used throughout (Pvalue cut-off = 0.05 and the standard Bonferroni correction was used), other than that sequences were considered
as circular, consensus daughters were found and breakpoints were polished. We used principally the information inferred by more than one method, as evaluation of
the performance of these recombination detection methods using simulated and empirical data indicated that one
should not rely too heavily on the results of a single
method (Posada, 2002). In RDP analysis, the length of the
window was set to 10 variable sites, and the step size was
set to one nucleotide. P values were estimated by randomizing the alignment 1,000 times. For GENECONV
analysis, the g-scale parameter was set to 1 and the
number of permutations was set to 10,000.
Phylogenetic congruence
To examine phylogenetic support for each identified
recombination event in the breakpoint analysis, we used
the retained sequence position version of the TreeOrder
Scan method [31] implemented in Simmonics2005
(Version1.4) package. TreeOrder Scan records the position of each sequence in a series of phylogenetic trees produced by sets of overlapping fragments across the

genomes. Deviations in the tree order of individual
sequences and of group of sequences between fragments
of defined length indicate conflicting phylogenetic relationships. Alternatively, individual non-recombinant
sequences show constant tree order (position) across the
genome. In the present analysis, we recorded the changes
in the phylogenetic relationships of clades supported by
70 per cent bootstrap values for sequential 300 base
sequence fragments at 100 nucleotide intervals.
Frequency and mapping of recombination
Estimation of the frequency and mapping of the locations
of recombination events was achieved by phylogeny compatibility analysis using the TreeOrder Scan method. First,
the TreeOrder Scan program produces optimally ordered
neighbor-joining trees for fragments of definite length
along an alignment. In the next step, a pairwise comparison is made between trees constructed from each
sequence fragment along the alignment. Then a phyloge-

netic compatibility value is computed as the number of
times the phylogeny of one tree has to be violated to
match the tree order observed in other trees constructed
along the length of an alignment. In our case we assigned
sequences to predefined groups based on their geographical origin and a bootstrap value of 70 per cent was used
as threshold for scoring phylogeny violations. All pairwise
compatibility values were calculated using trees constructed for 300 nucleotide sequence fragments separated
by 100 nucleotides across the length of the analysed alignment. These compatibility values were then plotted on a
phylogenetic compatibility matrix.
