Abstract
Background: The lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii is a member of one of the oldest lineages of
vascular plants on Earth. Fossil records show that the lycophyte clade arose 400 million years ago,
150–200 million years earlier than angiosperms, a group of plants that includes the well-studied
flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. S. moellendorffii has a genome size of approximately 100 Mbp,
as small or smaller than that of A. thaliana. S. moellendorffii has the potential to provide significant
comparative information to better understand the evolution of vascular plants.
Results: We sequenced 2181 Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from a S. moellendorffii cDNA
library. One thousand three hundred and one non-redundant sequences were assembled,
containing 291 contigs and 1010 singletons. Approximately 75% of the ESTs matched proteins in
the non-redundant protein database. Among 1301 clusters, 343 were categorized according to
Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy and were compared to the GO mapping of A. thaliana tentative
consensus sequences. We compared S. moellendorffii ESTs to the A. thaliana and Physcomitrella patens
EST databases, using the tBLASTX algorithm. Approximately 60% of the ESTs exhibited similarity
with both A. thaliana and P. patens ESTs; whereas, 13% and 1% of the ESTs had exclusive similarity
with A. thaliana and P. patens ESTs, respectively. A substantial proportion of the ESTs (26%) had no
match with A. thaliana or P. patens ESTs.
Conclusion: We discovered 1301 putative unigenes in S. moellendorffii. These results give an initial
insight into its transcriptome that will aid in the study of the S. moellendorffii genome in the near
future.

Background
Our understanding of biology has been greatly improved
by studying genome structure and gene function of a
broad sampling of model organisms such as Mus musculus
(mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Danio rerio
(zebrafish), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), and Arabidopsis thaliana [1-5]. Comparative genomics has made it
clear that orthologs of many proteins that act as signal

transduction components, transcriptional regulatory factors, and metabolic enzymes can be identified between
and among these model organisms [6]. As a result, the
knowledge gained from comparative and evolutionary
studies of these species can provide insights into homologous processes in a wide range of other organisms, varying
from crop plants to humans [7]. Within plants however,
most of the efforts in genomics have been focused on crop

A simplified
A simplified version of the plant phylogenetic tree simplified and condensed from Pryer et al. [11]. The tree
shows that lycophytes (highlighted) diverged from other vascular plant lineages soon after plants colonized the terrestrial environment. Representative species were chosen from sub-clades within the clades listed, and illustrate major developments in
plant evolution including the colonization of land (land plants, L), the development of vasculature (vascular plants, V) and true
leaves (euphyllophytes, E), and the evolution of flowers (flowering plants, F), and seeds (seed plants, S).

plants or economically important plants such as Oryza
sativa (rice), Zea mays (maize), and Lycopersicon esculentum
(tomato) [8-10]. Thus, coupled with the sequencing of the
A. thaliana genome, these efforts have provided data on
only a single branch of the plant evolutionary tree,
namely members of the Monocotyledonae and Dicotyledonae, collectively termed the angiosperms and commonly
known as flowering plants. As a result, the community of
plant scientists has little sequence data on other plant lineages that could provide insights into common mechanisms of how plants develop and survive in a terrestrial
environment, nor do they have any kind of evolutionary
benchmarks that might reveal how angiosperms have
come to dominate most world ecosystems [11].
Clear evidence for the existence of angiosperms is present
in the fossil record of the lower Cretaceous (140 million
years ago), and some evidence suggests their existence 60
million years earlier, around the same time that conifers
and ginkgos arose [12]. In contrast, fossil evidence for the
lycophytes is found in strata dated to approximately 420
million years ago [13]. Thus, this clade diverged very early
from the lineage that led to all other vascular plants (Fig-

ure 1), and has existed on earth over twice as long as
plants that are the most common subjects of current laboratory and agricultural research. As such, the study of lycophytes may provide novel insights into plant biology
that would not be provided by research that focuses only
on flowering plants.
Selaginella is an extant genus of the lycophyte clade. It is
sometimes referred to as a 'seed-free' plant to highlight the
fact that it has not evolved flowers and seeds in the time
since its divergence from other plant lineages. It has a
number of characteristics that would make its study convenient for, and valuable to, the plant biology community
[11,14]. For example, like many other species of Selaginella, S. moellendorffii (Figure 2) is a small diploid plant
that can be easily grown in the laboratory. Further, it has
an approximate genome size of 100 Mbp [14], smaller
than that of A. thaliana, and among the smallest published
genome sizes for 'seed-free' genera. Because of these
attributes, S. moellendorffii was recently chosen as one of
the non-crop plants for BAC library construction in a NSF
funded Green Plant BAC library Project [15]. More importantly, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute

(JGI) has officially announced that it will sequence the S.
moellendorffii genome [16], making this species a target of
extreme interest for research into comparative plant
genomics, biochemistry, and development.

(a)

Expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing has been used as
an efficient and economical approach for large-scale gene
discovery [17]. It has also successfully provided frameworks for many genome projects [18,19]. Recently, a large
number of ESTs have been generated from various plant
species and deposited in GenBank, including both model
and crop plants like A. thaliana, rice, wheat, and maize as
well as species representative of clades other than
angiosperms, such as gymnosperms, cycads, and mosses
[20-23]. Although over 1000 ESTs from another Selaginella species S. lepidophylla, also known as the resurrection
plant, have also been deposited in GenBank [20], no manuscript has been published reporting on their analysis. In
this paper, we describe 2181 ESTs generated from a S. moellendorffii cDNA library. These ESTs were assembled into
1301 clusters, annotated using the BLASTX algorithm, surveyed for their abundance within the dataset, and classified into functional groups according to the Gene
Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Finally, a comparative genomics approach was used for comparing S. moellendorffii ESTs
with those of A. thaliana and Physcomitrella patens to look
for genes unique to S. moellendorffii.

Results and Discussion
Generation of S. moellendorffii cDNA library and ESTs
To gain a broad coverage of S. moellendorffii transcripts, we
collected and pooled whole S. moellendorffii plants for
mRNA extraction and subsequent cDNA library construction. To enrich for full-length cDNA clones, doublestranded cDNA was size-fractionated before cloning.
Based upon the average insert sizes of 35 cDNA clones
chosen at random from the library, we estimate that the
cDNA library has an average insert size of 850 bp. 2304
clones were sequenced from the 5' end of the cDNAs,
which generated 2181 vector-trimmed EST sequences
with an average sequencing read length of 640 bp.

Assembly of S. moellendorffii ESTs
To identify overlapping EST sequences, reduce sequencing
error and produce non-redundant EST data for further
functional annotation and comparative analysis, 2181
ESTs were assembled into clusters through stackPACK
v2.2 clustering system [24]. Based upon regions of nucleotide identity, EST sequences were merged into contiguous consensus sequences (contigs). One thousand three
hundred and one non-redundant EST clusters, putatively
regarded as unigenes, were generated, consisting of 291
contigs and 1010 singletons. The cluster size varied from
one to 105 copies of any given EST (Figure 3). Manual
inspection of the assembled ESTs identified 10 clusters

counted as unigenes that may actually represent non-overlapping sequence reads from cDNAs corresponding to
four single genes. As an example, three unigenes were
found to be best aligned to three different regions of the
same protein in a BLASTX analysis (described in the following paragraph), suggesting we lack a complete transcript for their accurate assembly. Conversely, we also
found that some clustered ESTs did not necessarily have
identical sequences within their overlapping regions. In
most of the cases, regions of sequence disagreement
within the clusters tend to appear towards the ends of the
EST reads, which is likely to be caused by errors generated
during sequencing. In some other cases, it may due to failure to discriminate between gene family members during
clustering, or allelic diversity in S. moellendorffii.
Annotation of S. moellendorffii ESTs
To annotate S. moellendorffii ESTs, the 1301 putative unigenes were translated dynamically in all 6 reading frames
and searched for homology against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database using BLASTX [25]. BLASTX
hits with E-values less than 10-5 were taken to be significant. Among 1301 unigenes, 962 (74%) had BLASTX hits

in the nr database, while the remaining 339 (26%) had
hits with E-values greater than 10-5 or no hit. When a less
permissive cutoff E-value of 10-10 was adopted, the numbers of unigenes with BLASTX hits and without BLASTX
hits changed slightly to 891 (68%) and 410 (32%) respectively. Our dataset showed that the inferred translation
products of most S. moellendorffii ESTs appear to be similar to proteins in other organisms but that there was also
a percentage of ESTs that represented potential Selaginellaor lycophyte-specific genes. Interestingly, 15 ESTs had at
least their top five BLASTX hits from non-plant organisms,
including six from bacteria or cyanobacteria (SmoC1_02_N06, SmoC-1_01_C17, SmoC-1_02_B19, SmoC1_06_K12, SmoC-1_cn167, SmoC-1_03_D21), two from
fungi (SmoC-1_06_O23, SmoC-1_02_H20), one from an
insect (SmoC-1_06_K02), three from nematodes (SmoC1_04_D10, SmoC-1_02_L08, SmoC-1_cn108), one from
fish (SmoC-1_04_F24), and two from mammals (SmoC1_02_H05, SmoC-1_03_F21). These data suggest that
homologs have either not yet been identified or are absent
from other plant lineages, although in one case (SmoC1_06_O23), a more distantly related A. thaliana gene was
returned by BLASTX, and in a further three cases, BLASTN

analysis of the EST-others database identified potential
homologs in P. patens (SmoC-1_02_N06, SmoC1_06_K12) and S. lepidophylla (SmoC-1_cn167).
Highly represented S. moellendorffii ESTs
EST copy number can be used to approximate gene expression levels in an organism, although there are artifacts of
cDNA library construction that may limit or over-represent certain transcripts [26]. Table 1 summarizes the first
32 most abundantly represented transcripts in the S.
moellendorffii EST collection, having six or more EST copies in each cluster, with their identities putatively assigned
by BLASTX analysis of the assembled contigs. As expected,
a large number of the S. moellendorffii ESTs are photosyn-

thesis-related genes, with 19 clusters containing 213 ESTs
(9% of total sequenced ESTs) corresponding to genes
involved in photosynthesis. There were seven clusters
matching to core proteins of photosynthesis reaction centers, including four subunits of photosystem I (PSI-G, PSIH, PSI-L, PSI-N), and three photosystem II proteins
(PsbW, OEC23, CP22). There were four contigs corresponding to light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins, including one early light-induced protein. We also
found ESTs for the RuBisCO small subunit, carbonic
anhydrase, plastocyanin, one subunit of cytochrome b6f
complex, ferredoxin and ferredoxin/NADP oxidoreductase, proteins involved in carbon fixation and photosynthetic electron transport. There were two putative antiPage 5 of 13

oxidative proteins found within S. moellendorffii ESTs:
chloroplastic iron superoxide dismutase and catalase, presumably required for the decomposition of superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide [27,28]. The BLASTX results show
that all of these highly expressed S. moellendorffii photosynthetic genes had homologs in A. thaliana genome,
consistent with previous observation that the photosynthesis machinery has been highly conserved throughout
plant evolution.
Three highly expressed S. moellendorffii transcripts corresponded to genes encoding enzymes of metabolism,
including an aldolase-like protein, a putative glutamine
synthetase cytosolic isoenzyme involved in nitrogen
assimilation [29,30], and a putative S-adenosylmethionine synthetase required for the synthesis of the major
methyl group donor involved in the methylation of a variety of biomolecules ranging from histones to secondary
metabolites, and for the biosynthesis of ethylene [31,32].
Other relatively abundant ESTs included one encoding a
putative subtilisin-chymotrypsin inhibitor, exhibiting
49% amino acid sequence identity with the wheat subtilisin-chymotrypsin inhibitor, which may play a role in
plant defense by inhibiting the serine proteinases of pathogens [33]. Two transcripts that matched an A. thaliana
expressed protein and Pisum sativum core protein may
function as membrane channel proteins. Interestingly,
one highly expressed EST matched with an E-value of 1012 a C. elegans protein of unknown function, and is only
more distantly related to an A. thaliana late embryogenesis
abundant protein.
There were five highly expressed ESTs that did not yield
significant matches using BLASTX (E>10-5). These are
putative Selaginella-specific genes and may encode proteins with functions unique to Selaginella or lycophytes.
The first two highly expressed ESTs in this project, represented by clusters SmoC1_cn126 and SmoC1_cn125, had
105 and 46 copies in their clusters respectively, but
returned no BLASTX hits with the nr protein database or
BLASTN hits with the NCBI EST-others database. To determine whether these sequences represented bona fide
Selaginella genes, we amplified the corresponding
sequences by PCR using genomic DNA as a template (data
not shown). Both sequences amplified successfully, and
both had introns, indicating that they were not derived
from DNA contamination from prokaryotic symbionts.
The rational translation of SmoC1_cn126 contig contains
a three repeats of the motif "XXXGXXTCDKCAQTGVCTCGKN", which aligns with similar cysteine-rich
motifs in proteins with epidermal growth factor repeats.
Using a low BLASTX stringency (E = 0.002),
SmoC1_cn125 matched to a Cynodon dactylon metallothionein-like protein (GB:AAS88721.1, 75% identical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/85

within a 20 amino acid motif). The other three highly
expressed S. moellendorffii specific ESTs lack hints for functional annotation. The biological function of the proteins
encoded by these genes, and the question of whether high
transcript abundance is predictive of high protein expression will be a matter for future investigation.
Functional categorization of S. moellendorffii ESTs
The most sensitive method to find new members of
known gene families among EST sequences is to search for
homology of the translated ESTs to motifs extracted from
a multiple alignment of known gene family members
[18]. To functionally categorize S. moellendorffii ESTs
using motif homology searches, we translated the 1301
unigenes in six reading frames and imported them into
InterProScan [34], which aligned 491 clusters to InterPro
entries (E<10-5). Mapping of InterPro entries to GO [35],
assigned 343 out of 491 InterPro hits with 562 GO accession numbers. The 562 accession numbers further generated 964 individual GO mappings in the three major
ontologies (biological processes, molecular functions and
cellular components) [36]. The apparent discrepancies
between these values arises from the fact that not all InterPro hits had available GO accession numbers associated
with them, one InterProScan entry could be assigned to
more than one GO accession numbers, and one GO accession number could be mapped under multiple parental
categories [37].

Tables 2 and Figure 4 summarize the GO assignment of S.
moellendorffii ESTs in terms of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components, covering a broad
range of the GO functional categories. Using the downloaded A. thaliana GO assignments from the TIGR A. thaliana Gene Index [38,39], we compared the distribution of
GO categories between S. moellendorffii ESTs and A. thaliana tentative consensus sequences (TCs). Table 3 shows
that the distribution patterns of GO assignments of S.
moellendorffii and A. thaliana transcripts were generally
similar, with a few exceptions in some categories. Besides
the true differences in functional distribution of unigenes,
some of the differences could be due to the difference in
EST data sources between these two species. For example,
in terms of biological processes, A. thaliana has a higher
percentage in 'response to stimulus and stress' and 'development' than S. moellendorffii. Considering that among
the A. thaliana ESTs in the TIGR database, some were generated from plants at specific developmental stages or
from plants exposed to specific biotic or abiotic stimuli, it
is very likely that ESTs from orthologs of these genes
would be missing from the S. moellendorffii ESTs which
were generated from normal mature plants.
The current GO annotations for plants are based solely on
the annotated proteins of A. thaliana and O. sativa, both of

Note that one gene product may be assigned to more than one GO terms, and one children term can fit into multiple parental categories. The
representation means the number of non-redundant ESTs that can be mapped to a certain GO term. The representation percentage is based on the
total number of GO mappings in each of the three major ontologies (biological process: 420, molecular function: 364, cellular component: 180).

which are angiosperms. Since the lycophyte clade
diverged from other plant lineages 400 million years ago,
and 200 million years before angiosperms, it is perhaps to
be expected that a large proportion of S. moellendorffii
genes could not be accurately assigned to GO categories in
the database containing only angiosperm gene entries. We
expect that the representation of plant species other than
angiosperms will certainly benefit resources as InterPro
and in turn will lead to further resolution within GO.
Comparative genomics of S. moellendorffii ESTs
One important objective of comparative genomics is to
trace gene evolution including the emergence, development, and loss of orthologous genes in different organisms over evolutionary time [40]. To survey the S.
moellendorffii ESTs in an evolutionary context, we used the

S. moellendorffii unigene sequences as queries to search for
homologous sequences in the A. thaliana and P. patens EST
databases using tBLASTX algorithm (cut off E-value = 106). There were two reasons that we chose A. thaliana and
P. patens ESTs as tBLASTX databases. First, A. thaliana and
P. patens are representatives of the most diverged lineages
of land plants, namely angiosperms and bryophytes. They
flank Selaginella in the plant phylogenetic tree, and last
shared a common ancestor over 400 million years ago
[23], thus providing ample opportunity for the evolutionary divergence of individual genes and gene families. Second, the large quantities of A. thaliana and P. patens ESTs
in GenBank (472,278 and 104,027 respectively) provide
a substantial coverage of the transcriptome in these two
species. Using them as BLAST databases makes it possible

The GO assignments for A. thaliana ESTs were obtained from TIGR [38]. The percentage of GO assignments for A. thaliana was calculated based on
the total numbers of GO mappings in each of the three major ontologies with the number of unknown terms deducted from them (biological
process: 20185, molecular function: 23680, cellular component: 6309). The functional categories present in A. thaliana but not in S. moellendorffii
were not listed in the table.

to do a relatively comprehensive genomic analysis even in
the absence of the full genome sequence of P. patens.
Figure 5 summarizes the distribution of S. moellendorffii
ESTs by tBLASTX results. Among 1301 non-redundant S.
moellendorffii ESTs, 788 (61%) ESTs had homology with
both A. thaliana and P. patens ESTs. These ESTs probably
identify non-dispensable genes, which tend to be evolutionarily conserved in all land plants [41]. 168 (13%)
ESTs had exclusive similarity with A. thaliana ESTs, and
may represent the genes that evolved in land plants after
the divergence of bryophytes, or those that were lost from
the genomes of mosses. Table 4 shows the top 20 S. moellendorffii EST tBLASTX hits for A. thaliana ESTs that were
not present within the P. patens EST database ranked by
tBLASTX E-values. Among these, it is possible to identify
candidates that might have contributed to the success of
vascular plants, including those involved in functions
such as lignification (SmoC-1_05_G17) [42], cell division
control (SmoC-1_01_E02) [43], intracellular transport
(SmoC-1_02_C05 and SmoC-1_05_G03) [44,45],
responses to sulfur starvation (SmoC-1_03_C14) [46],
dehydration (SmoC-1_06_M11), and viral infection
(SmoC-1_06_P21) [47]. Only 8 (1%) S. moellendorffii
ESTs had similarity only with P. patens ESTs. These ESTs

may represent genes that arose early in plant evolution
but were lost later after the divergence of the lycophytes. It
should be noted, however, that all eight of these ESTs had
relative low tBLASTX score (E-value around 10-10), limiting our certainty that the homologous ESTs in P. patens are
true orthologs. Finally, there were 337 (26%) ESTs that
had no tBLASTX match in the A. thaliana and P. patens EST
databases. These ESTs may be Selaginella-specific genes,
possibly having evolved only in lycophytes after their
divergence from other lineages or having arisen after the
divergence of bryophytes and later being lost in
euphyllophytes.

Conclusion
We sequenced 2181 ESTs from the lycophyte S. moellendorffii, putatively representing 1301 unigenes. Our data
showed that a large proportion of the genes had homologous genes in the well-studied model plant A. thaliana and
other plant species. By browsing the putative functional
annotations of these ESTs, researchers will be able to
choose S. moellendorffii genes of interest and compare
them to their othologs in other species. We also found a
substantial number of putative Selaginella-specific genes
that do not share similarity with known genes, with some
of them even representing very highly expressed genes.

A Venn diagram showing the distribution of S. moellendorffii EST tBLASTX matches by databases.The

Considering the complexity of the plant kingdom and a
time span more than 150 million years between the divergences of lycophytes and angiosperms, it will not be surprising to identify gene functions in S. moellendorffii that
are not present in A. thaliana. When the draft genome
sequence of S. moellendorffii is completed and released,
this EST resource will also play an important role in the
mapping and annotation of the genome. As a member of
a clade that arose after the bryophytes and before all other
vascular plants, S. moellendorffii will provide new opportunities in studying plant evolution, particularly those adaptations relating to fundamental traits that facilitated the
transition of green plants to the land, such as lignification
in vascular plants, root/stem/leaf organography, complex
patterns of sporophyte branching, and the elaboration of
reproductive structures.

Methods
Plant material and cDNA library Construction
S. moellendorffii was obtained from Plant Delights Nursery
(Raleigh, NC). Plants were grown at 23°C in a greenhouse
with a photoperiod of 16h light/8h dark. The cDNA
library used in this study was made from RNA extracted
from pooled tissue including stems, microphylls, strobilis, and rhizophores of S. moellendorffii plants. Briefly,
fresh tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and total RNA

was extracted using the RNeasy Max Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), treated with RNase-free DNase, and precipitated
in 2 M lithium chloride. Poly A+ RNA was isolated from
total RNA using the Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit
(Dynal Biotech, Brown Deer, WI). The cDNA library was
constructed from 1 µg mRNA using the Creator Smart
cDNA Library Construction Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto,
CA). After first-strand synthesis, the full length double
stranded cDNAs were synthesized by primer-extension.
Full length double stranded cDNAs were digested with Sfi
I and size fractionated using a CHROMA SPIN-400 column (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA-containing fractions were pooled, and ethanol precipitated. The cDNAs
were then cloned into pDNR-LIB at Sfi I site, and electroporated into E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). The library had an un-amplified titer of 1.6 × 106 colony-forming units mL-1 and a total complexity of 3.2 × 106
colonies. To estimate the average insert size of the library,
plasmid DNAs were extracted from 35 randomly picked
clones from the library, digested with Sfi I, and analyzed
by agarose gel electrophoresis.
EST sequencing and dbEST submission
18,432 colonies from un-amplified S. moellendorffii cDNA
library were arrayed into 48 384-well plates using Q-Pix
multifunction colony picker (Genetix). Plasmid DNA was
isolated from 2304 clones picked from the first six 384well plates. Sequences of cDNAs were determined from
their 5' end by conventional procedures using the big-dye
terminators on the ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the Purdue Genomics
Center using T7-ZL (5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3')
as the 5'-sequencing primer. The vector sequence was
trimmed from the original EST sequences resulting in
2181 sequences. The 2181 ESTs have been submitted to
GenBank dbEST under the accession numbers DN837577
to DN839757 [20].
EST clustering and homology search
2181 EST sequences were imported into the stackPACK
v2.2 clustering system (Electric Genetics, Reston, VA)
through WebPipe for clustering with default setting, and
contig consensus sequences were generated from the clusters. One thousand three hundred and one non-redundant EST sequences were exported through WebReport in
FASTA format. BLASTX analyses using the nr database
were performed on the 1301 unigene sequences, using Evalue of 10-5 as a cutoff threshold. The complete BLASTX
annotation of 1301 S. moellendorffii unigenes can be
viewed at [48].
Functional categorization of ESTs
To search for functional protein domains of translated
ESTs, 1301 unigene sequences were merged into one
FASTA file and imported into InterProScan, which was

The tBLASTX E-value of an EST varies with its BLASTX E-value in a small range (e.g. SmoC-1_01_H05 has a tBLASTX E-value of 1E-107 against its
homologous A. thaliana EST and a BLASTX E-value of 2E-94 against the translated full length A. thaliana cDNA.). The homology ranking was based on
the tBLASTX E-value. The identities of ESTs were putatively described by the A. thaliana protein with the lowest E-value in the BLASTX analysis.

run on a local SUN unix server. BlastProDom, Coil,
FPrintScan, HMMPIR, HMMPfam, HMMSmart, HMMTigr, ProfileScan, ScanRegExp, and Seg superfamily were
selected as the database methods. All the sequences were
translated in six reading frames and aligned to the entries
in the selected databases. EST clusters which had positive
InterProScan hits (E <10-5) were automatically assigned
InterPro accession numbers. According to the mapping of
InterPro entries to GO [35], GO accession numbers were
assigned to EST clusters, which were used to classify ESTs
into functional groups by molecular function, cellular
component, and biological process. In comparison of the
distribution of GO categories between S. moellendorffii
ESTs and A. thaliana TCs, the GO assignments for A. thaliana ESTs were obtained from TIGR [38]. The Complete
Interpro assignment and GO mapping of S. moellendorffii
ESTs can be accessed in the supplemental data (see Additional file: 1).
Comparison of S. moellendorffii ESTs to A. thaliana and
P. patens ESTs
472,278 A. thaliana ESTs and 104,027 P. patens ESTs
retrieved from GenBank by searching 'Arabidopsis / Physcomitrella and gbdiv est' in NCBI Entrez [25] were saved to
a local server. The 1301 S. moellendorffii unigenes were
translated in six reading frames and searched for homology against the six-frame translations of A. thaliana ESTs
and P. patens ESTs respectively using the BLAST algorithm.

An E-value of 10-6 was set as stringency threshold. The
complete result of S. moellendorffii unigenes tBLASTX
against A. thaliana and P. patens ESTs can be viewed at
[48].
Genomic PCR
To amplify the genomic sequences of the two most highly
expressed ESTs (SmoC1_cn126 and SmoC1_cn125) in S.
moellendorffii, PCR was performed using genomic DNA
extracted from 50 mg fresh tissue of S. moellendorffii as
described previously [49] as template and two pairs of
PCR primers designed from their EST contig sequences:
CC1170 (5'-CGAGCTCGTAGTGATAGTGTC -3') and
CC1171
(5'-AACCATAGGAGAGGAAGACC-3')
for
SmoC1_cn126; CC1228 (5'-ATAGCTTAGCTGCTTTCTTCTC-3') and CC1229 (5'-ATACTACTCATGTCGCAGCTC
-3') for SmoC1_cn125. PCR was performed using an initial 2 min denaturation at 94°C, followed by 25 cycles,
each consisting of a 0.5 min denaturation at 94°C, a 0.5
min annealing at 50°C, and a 1 min extension at 72°C.
These 25 cycles were followed by a 5 min extension at
72°C. PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced at Purdue
Genomics Center.
