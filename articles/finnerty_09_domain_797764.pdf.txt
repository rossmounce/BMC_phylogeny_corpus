Abstract
Background: Msx originated early in animal evolution and is implicated in human genetic
disorders. To reconstruct the functional evolution of Msx and inform the study of human
mutations, we analyzed the phylogeny and synteny of 46 metazoan Msx proteins and tracked the
duplication, diversification and loss of conserved motifs.
Results: Vertebrate Msx sequences sort into distinct Msx1, Msx2 and Msx3 clades. The sistergroup relationship between MSX1 and MSX2 reflects their derivation from the 4p/5q chromosomal
paralogon, a derivative of the original "MetaHox" cluster. We demonstrate physical linkage
between Msx and other MetaHox genes (Hmx, NK1, Emx) in a cnidarian. Seven conserved domains,
including two Groucho repression domains (N- and C-terminal), were present in the ancestral
Msx. In cnidarians, the Groucho domains are highly similar. In vertebrate Msx1, the N-terminal
Groucho domain is conserved, while the C-terminal domain diverged substantially, implying a novel
function. In vertebrate Msx2 and Msx3, the C-terminal domain was lost. MSX1 mutations
associated with ectodermal dysplasia or orofacial clefting disorders map to conserved domains in
a non-random fashion.
Conclusion: Msx originated from a MetaHox ancestor that also gave rise to Tlx, Demox, NK, and
possibly EHGbox, Hox and ParaHox genes. Duplication, divergence or loss of domains played a
central role in the functional evolution of Msx. Duplicated domains allow pleiotropically expressed
proteins to evolve new functions without disrupting existing interaction networks. Human
missense sequence variants reside within evolutionarily conserved domains, likely disrupting
protein function. This phylogenomic evaluation of candidate disease markers will inform clinical and
functional studies.

Background
The Msx gene family is one of the oldest animal-specific
homeodomain transcription factors. Msx genes have been
identified in basal, i.e. diploblastic, animals such as sea
anemones [1,2], corals [3], hydras [4,5] jellyfishes [6], and

sponges [7,8] They have also been described from eleven
different phyla of triploblastic animals [9].
Since its origin at or near the base of the Metazoa, Msx
appears to have evolved in a relatively conservative fashPage 1 of 23

ion. The locus has not undergone the rampant gene duplication seen in a number of other Antennapedia-class
homeodomain genes, although vertebrates are known to
possess two (human), three (mouse), or five (zebrafish)
Msx paralogs. Furthermore, at least one portion of the
protein has been extremely highly conserved – e.g., only
two of the 60 positions in the homeodomain differ
between Nematostella (a sea anemone) and Branchiostoma
(a chordate), two taxa that diverged over 600 million
years ago. Concordant with the conservative molecular
evolution of this developmental regulatory protein, Msx
appears to have retained an ancient role in neuro-ectodermal patterning and differentiation in vertebrates, arthropods, and perhaps cnidarians [4,10,11]. Msx proteins are
also consistently expressed at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions [12-14]. Msx, NK, and Tlx homeobox
genes share common expression patterns during early
dorso-ventral neurectodermal and mesodermal development as well as during anterior-posterior segmentation
events, in both flies (Ecdysozoa) and the slowly evolving
nereid annelids (Lophotrochozoa) [15], that resemble
dorsal-ventral expression patterns found during development in vertebrates (Deuterostomia) [16]. This is especially notable since Msx genes are found clustered with NK
and Tlx homeobox genes in large MetaHox clusters or paralogons [17-19].
Msx genes have also assumed diverse developmental roles
in vertebrates and arthropods, and they are known to have
played key roles in the evolution of novel ontogenies and
novel morphologies. For example, altered expression of
Msx genes has been implicated in the evolution of direct
development in sea urchins [20] and caudal fin elaboration of male sword-tailed fishes [21]. The expansion of the
Msx family in vertebrates via gene duplication has been
accompanied by divergent expression patterns between
Msx paralogs [22], and perhaps by an overall expansion of
Msx-mediated developmental processes.
Msx1 and Msx2 exhibit both redundant and complementary spatiotemporal expression patterns and protein functions during vertebrate development [23-31]. In
vertebrates, Msx1 protein is pleiotropically expressed in a
range of craniofacial structures including neural crest,
branchial arches and sensory placodes. Msx1 is also
expressed during fin/limb bud outgrowth and during
early gastrulation, as well as at sites of ectodermal-mesenchymal interactions. Mouse Msx1 and Msx2 are both
expressed in migrating cranial neural crest cells.
The two Msx genes in humans, MSX1 and MSX2, are both
important in human genetic disorders. Mutations in these
genes have been identified in individuals exhibiting both
syndromic/Mendelian
and
nonsyndromic/complex
genetic disorders. Human MSX1 coding mutations have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

been identified in patients with either orofacial clefting
(OFC) [32-34], ectodermal dysplasias (ED), (such as
tooth agenesis and nail malformation) [35-37], or both
phenotypes [38]. By contrast, human MSX2 mutations are
predominantly associated with cranial malformations
[39-41], although murine studies suggest a role for MSX2
in bone and ectodermal organ formation [42].
In order to understand how the developmental roles of
the Msx genes were altered by gene duplication in vertebrates, a better understanding of Msx gene family evolution in vertebrates is needed. At this time, our
understanding is quite limited. For example, the precise
relationship among the mammalian and teleost paralogs
has not been convincingly established [22,43].
In analyzing putative human Msx mutations, the greatest
challenge may lie in distinguishing neutral genetic variation from mutations that are likely to have significant clinical consequences in multifactorial disease cases [44].
Given the complex and sometimes overlapping spatiotemporal expression patterns of different Msx paralogs in
vertebrates, unraveling the phenotypic consequences of
particular Msx mutations is made even more difficult. In
recent years, with the proliferation of DNA sequence data,
it has become possible to consider the degree of evolutionary conservation when predicting the phenotypic consequences of sequence variation. For example, Kashuk
and co-workers found those missense mutations that
mapped to evolutionarily invariant positions in an alignment of RET proteins were more likely to be associated
with the most severe clinical outcomes [45].
In an effort to identify MSX1 mutations that are most
likely to have important phenotypic consequences, we
undertook an evolutionary analysis of diverse vertebrate
Msx genes. A recent analysis of Msx genes from 13 different animal phyla [9] identified five conserved coding
domains. These included two Groucho-binding domains,
a conserved motif upstream of the conserved intron, the
homeodomain and its C-terminal flanking region, with
all but the duplicate Groucho domain having been previously noted [46-48]. Using a different approach and a different selection of taxa, we have determined that seven
conserved coding domains were present in the common
ancestor of all eumetazoan Msx genes, including those
reported by Takahashi and co-workers. These included a
set of conserved residues located both upstream and
downstream of the homeodomain, a Pbx binding motif
and a PIAS-binding domain located at the carboxy terminus. We also provide evidence for the derivation of these
coding domains from an ancestral MetaHox cluster gene.
While all seven domains are widely conserved in metazoan Msx proteins, the duplicate vertebrate Msx proteins

differ strikingly with respect to their Groucho repression
domains. Relative to Msx1, both Msx2 and Msx3 diverged
slightly more rapidly in the N-terminal Groucho repression domain. However, the C-terminal Groucho domain
appears to have been substantially modified and was
likely independently lost in both Msx2 and Msx3, while it
has evolved only slightly from the inferred ancestral
sequence in Msx1. The functional evolution of these
domains is likely critical to understanding the nature of
Msx mutations, as the two main phenotypic categories of
MSX1 mutants – (1) ectodermal dysplasias and (2) oral/
facial clefting disorders – are not randomly distributed
across the length of the protein. The evolutionary analysis
also permits us to identify those human sequence variants
that are most radical when evaluated against the background of Msx evolutionary history. Since such mutations
run counter to long-standing stabilizing selection acting
upon Msx, they are likely to have deleterious phenotypic
consequences.
In addition to its medical relevance, Msx evolution has
wider implications for the origins of biological novelty.
Cis-regulatory evolution is thought to be the most common driver of morphological innovation, with protein
evolution being a less common cause due to stronger stabilizing selection acting on protein sequences [49]. In a
pleiotropically expressed regulatory protein like Msx, any
change in the coding sequence has the potential to impact
regulatory interactions in multiple temporal and spatial
contexts, so any deleterious effect will be magnified. In
such proteins, functionally significant residues will be
under very strong stabilizing selection [50]. The constraints acting on protein sequence may however be
relaxed by genome and gene duplication events [51-54].
We discuss how the evolution of Msx incorporated an
additional layer of complexity because early in its history,
Msx underwent a domain duplication, and similar to
duplicate genes or duplicate cis-regulatory modules,
duplicate domains encode the possibility of functional
redundancy. The differences between Msx1 and Msx2
point to a duplication and subsequent functional divergence of the Groucho repression domains as being a key
feature in their evolution that help define the mutation
phenotype patterns.

Results
Msx domains and motifs
Logan et al., 1992 compared Engrailed paralogs from
diverse vertebrate species and identified five conserved
coding domains [55]. They named these domains the
EH1-5 for Engrailed Homology domains, 1–5. Subsequent work has identified similar sequence motifs and
functional domains within many other proteins, most
notably transcription factors [46,56-60], that included the
Msx family [46,48].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

To look for common coding domains relevant to the evolution of the Msx family, comparisons were deliberately
made between Msx sequences from taxa more ancient
than that utilized in the engrailed comparisons, since current evidence suggests that the Msx family is more ancient
than the engrailed family [61]. First, to look for ancient
sequence homologies relevant to deuterostome taxa,
human MSX1 was compared with Msx proteins from a
cephalochordate, a urochordate, an echinoderm, and two
non-deuterostomes that served as outgroups, a nereid
annelid [62] and a cnidarian. Five conserved domaintypes were identified in this initial analysis that closely
resemble those from the Engrailed family. These domains
may actually be a plesiomorphic character relative to the
origin of the Engrailed family. Thus these domains were
designated as Msx Homology domains 1 to 5, or MH1-5
(Fig. 1A, 2), in parallel to the nomenclature for the
Engrailed domains. All five of these Msx proteins were
found to harbor two MH1 domains, labeled as MH1N
and MH1C, (named for their respective positions within
the protein nearer the amino (N) or carboxy (C) terminus
of the protein).
Secondly, to probe for the vertebrate lineage-specific
homologies, mammalian Msx1, Msx2, and Msx3 protein
sequences were compared with Msx proteins sequences
from three bony fishes, a cephalochordate, two urochordates, an echinoderm, and again, the nereid annelid. This
latter sequence was included here to represent a slowly
evolving, non-deuterostome outgroup [62,63]. A novel
result from this analysis was the identification of an additional conserved domain at the C-terminus of the vertebrate Msx proteins designated MH6 (Figs. 1B, 2). While
MH6 was not identified directly in the initial analysis of
the non-vertebrate taxa, multi-sequence alignments reveal
that many core amino acids within the MH6 domain are
also conserved in these animals (Additional file 1 page 8).
The most striking feature discovered with the vertebrate
sequence set was that only the vertebrate Msx1 or Msxe
orthologs encode both the MH1N and MH1C domains.
According to the MEME analysis, the Msx2, Msxd, Msxa,
Msx3, Msxb and Msxc proteins lack the MH1C domain
(See Fig. 1B). As both MH1N and MH1C domains are
present in non-vertebrate taxa, including basal metazoans
such as the coral and the sea anemone, these data suggest
that retention of both domains in Msx1 or Msxe orthologs
is the primitive condition, making them more similar in
sequence and perhaps function, to the ancestral Msx protein and the single Msx homologs found in extant basal
animals.
Putative functions can be ascribed to each of these deeply
conserved domains based upon their strong sequence
resemblance to motifs in other closely related homeodo-

MEME Domain Identification in the Msx Family
MEME Domain Identification in the Msx Family. A) Conserved domains identified by MEME in a comparison of human
MSX1 (Msx1_Hos) and the Msx proteins of cephalochordate, hemichordate, sea urchin, polychaete, and coral. The domains
are named consecutively from the N-terminal to the C-terminal ends of the protein as Msx Homology (MH) domains 1–5. B)
Conserved domains identified by MEME in a comparison of vertebrate Msx paralogs plus single Msx proteins from cephalochordate, tunicate, sea urchin, polychaete, and coral. The MH2 and MH5 domains include more amino acids (see Fig. 2) due to
the increased sequence similarity within the vertebrate clade. These slightly larger domains are indicated by a "+". Taxon/gene
abbreviations are listed in the methods.

main proteins that have already undergone functional
analysis (Fig. 2) [23,47,56,64-72]. Such comparisons suggest that the MH1N and MH1C domains are Groucho
repression domains. The engrailed EH2 domain includes
a motif that resembles the "hexapeptide," a motif first
identified in Hox proteins and that is known to augment
DNA binding specificity by binding to Pbx family proteins
as a cofactor [56]. However, relative to the "hexapeptide"
of Hox genes, the engrailed Pbx-binding motif has an
extra crucial tryptophan residue. Interestingly, the MH2
domains in the Msx proteins of basal metazoans and nonvertebrate deuterostomes most often have double tryptophans, while the vertebrate Msx proteins have an MH2

that resembles the hexapeptide motifs of anterior Hox
genes in having only a single tryptophan [73].
The MH3 domain defined here corresponds to the EH3
domain of engrailed proteins. Basically, MH3 is the linker
between the MH2 domain and the homeodomain. This
linker includes the eight highly conserved amino acids
immediately upstream of the homeodomain (labeled
"N8" in Figs. 1, 2). Our rationale for defining this whole
span as MH3 is based on how the conservation observed
within our multisequence alignments (Additional File 1
page 4–5) corresponds to both functional data from
engrailed's EH3 domain [56], as well as additional con-

served phosphorylation motifs [74], previously identified
in Hox proteins [75].
The MH4 motif corresponds to the homeodomain, which
is known to be involved in DNA binding and protein-protein (homo- or hetero-) dimerization. MH5, which is contiguous with the carboxy-terminus of the homeodomain,
has been shown to be involved in transcriptional repression. Finally, MH6 appears to be the PIAS protein-binding
domain.
To investigate the generality and antiquity of the pattern
of conserved Msx homology domains identified by
MEME, we used a motif-based Hidden Markov Model of

these domains (generated using MetaMEME) to search a
manually assembled sequence collection as well as online
databases. The manually assembled sequence collection
comprised two chordate Msx proteins, two cnidarian Msx
proteins, and two poriferan Msx proteins in addition to
full-length NK and Tlx homeobox proteins, including all
of the published full-length MetaHox protein sequences
from sponges. Representative MetaMEME results are
shown in Additional File 2. As expected, the full set of Msx
Homology (MH) domains was re-identified within the
chordate and cnidarian Msx sequences, evidenced by the
high match scores (165–399) and by the presence of those
most highly conserved core amino acid residues within
the LOGO position specific scoring matrices illustrated in

Fig. 2. By contrast, the highest match scores to non-Msx
protein sequences (65–128) were to NK1/NK2-3-4, Tlx,
and BarH/Bsh proteins. The match scores and conserved
residues found within the Msx sequence of Amphimedon
queenslandica (a sponge) reveal strong matches to the
MH3/4 domains and much weaker matches to the MH1
and MH2 domains, that lack canonical cores amino acids.
It is also notable that there is a strong match, although not
scored by this initial MetaMEME analysis, between the 12
amino acid "R1" sequence found downstream of several
Demox homeodomain proteins (EETEMEMKSPKY) [59],
and the first portion of the MH5 canonical sequence
(EAELEKLKMAAKPMLPPGLFM) found in Msx proteins. It
is the first thirteen amino acid residues of the MH5
domain that is the most conserved (Fig. 2). It is possible
to use slightly different parameter settings within MEME
that limit domain sizes. When this is done, a smaller
canonical MH5 domain is obtained that displays just
these most conserved residues. MetaMEME then identifies
strong matches between the MH5 domain of vertebrate
Msx proteins and the AmqMsx as well as the R1 domain
of Tlx and Demox proteins (data not shown).
When we searched the much larger non-redundant database of proteins sequences for Msx Homology (MH)
domains using MetaMEME, as expected, the highest
match scores were again found for Msx sequences (248–
403) with significance scores ranging from e-52 to e-85.
When attempting to identify non-Msx proteins possessing
the same conserved domains, we first screened the results
to eliminate those sequences without homeodomains
and those sequences with low-scoring domains occupying
different relative positions. The sequences that met these
criteria and scored the highest matches to the Msx homology domains were Emx, Hmx (an NK gene), Engrailed,
Dlx, Gbx, Nk, and Tlx; the highest scores were in the range
of 113 to 67, with significance values in the range of e-19
down to e-10. Within these non-Msx proteins, strong
matches to particular domains were also identified,
including MH1, MH2, MH3/4, and MH5, as above. Similar results were obtained using the MAST program, the
motif based local alignment tool within the MEME suite
of programs (data not shown).
Multisequence alignment of Msx protein sequences
A full-length multisequence alignment of all the Msx
orthologs and paralogs was facilitated by the identification of the conserved Msx Homology domains, as highly
conserved amino acids within MH domains (MH1N and
MH2) were used as homologous landmarks to keep the
alignments in register (see Methods). Amino acid
sequences either upstream, downstream or in between
these domains were then aligned en bloc by the Clustal
algorithm within MEGA 4.0 [76]. Thus the final full

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

sequence alignment has input from both local and global
alignment algorithms.
The full sequence alignments of all Msx orthologs and
paralogs (Additional File 1 page 1–8) revealed that the
coding region that contained the MH1C domain in Msx1
and Msxe orthologs appeared to be deleted or highly
diverged in the Msx2/a/d and Msx 3/b/c paralog groups
(Additional File 1 page 4). This corroborates the result
from the MEME analysis (Fig. 1B), and suggests the MH1C
domain was lost prior to the diversification of the Msx2/
a/d and Msx 3/b/c genes, likely by some combination of
deletion/subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization
[52,77,78].
Phylogenetic analysis
A neighbor-joining analysis of 44 Msx proteins is presented in Fig. 3. The tree depicted is based upon the full
alignment and is rooted using the two cnidarian Msx
sequences. All of the vertebrate Msx sequences appear as a
monophyletic group, and within this vertebrate Msx
clade, we can recognize distinct Msx1, Msx2, and Msx3
lineages. From the distribution of placental, marsupial,
avian, amphibian, teleost, and chondrichthyan sequences
among these three clades, we can conclude that the Msx1,
2, and 3 lineages had diverged prior to the evolutionary
split between bony fishes and cartilaginous fishes. Furthermore, it appears that the Msx1 and Msx2 lineages
share a common ancestor to the exclusion of Msx3. If we
map the presence of conserved Msx domains on this phylogeny, it appears that MH1C has been lost independently
in both the Msx2 and Msx3 families of vertebrates.

We also performed a phylogenetic analysis after removing
all characters that harbored alignment gaps. A phylogeny
is presented in Additional File 3 based upon this gap-free
alignment (Additional file 4). As in the full alignment, the
gap-free alignment supports a sister-group relationship
between an Msx1 clade and an Msx2 clade. However, the
gap free analysis does not support the monophyly of a
clade comprising tetrapod Msx3 genes and teleost MsxA/
D genes. Rather, the teleost genes and the tetrapod genes
emerge as two independent lineages at the base of the vertebrate Msx radiation
To compare the relative support for the three possible relationships among Msx1, Msx2, and Msx3 proteins, we conducted a battery of phylogenetic analyses on a subset of
the taxa (see Methods). Both neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood analyses of this smaller dataset, performed both with and without rate variation among sites,
support the grouping of Msx1 with Msx2 (Fig. 4). Given
the extremely low bootstrap support for the grouping of
Msx2 and Msx3, this possibility can be confidently ruled
out. However, the bootstrap analyses reveal some support

neighbor-joining (see methods). The tree is rooted using the two cnidarian sequences. Numbers at nodes indicate the percentage of replicates in which a given partition between taxa was observed in 1000 replicates of the bootstrap [106]. Circles indicate the major taxonomic group represented by each sequence (Hemi = Hemichordata, Ceph = Cephalochordata, Chon =
Chondrichthyes, Amphib = Amphibia, Marsup = Marsupialia, Artio = Artiodactyla). Species abbreviations are provided in the
methods.

in the data for the grouping of Msx1 with Msx3, and in
one instance (a maximum-likelihood analysis assuming
rate variation among sites), the bootstrap support for this
hypothesis actually exceeds the support for an Msx1-Msx2
clade. Importantly, the grouping of Msx1 with either Msx2
or Msx3 would imply that the MH1C motif has been independently lost in Msx2 and Msx3.

Evolution of the Groucho-binding domains (MH1N and
MH1C) in vertebrate Msx paralogs
The MEME analysis, the alignment, and the phylogenetic
analysis indicate that the MH1 domain duplicated early in
the evolution of the Msx family, prior to the divergence of
Cnidaria and Bilateria, and that the MH1C domain was
subsequently lost or underwent extensive sequence divergence in the Msx2/a/d and Msx 3/b/c lineages. In an
attempt to reconstruct the divergence of these duplicate
Groucho-binding domains over the course of vertebrate

Phylogenetic support for alternate relationships among Msx1, Msx2, and Msx3
Phylogenetic support for alternate relationships among Msx1, Msx2, and Msx3. The three possible relationships
among Msx1, Msx2, and Msx3 were directly compared using a dataset consisting of 11 taxa. Trees were generated using neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood, with and without variation among sites (see methods). In all four instances, the favored
topology grouped Msx1 with Msx2 to the exclusion of Msx3 (check marks).

evolutionary history, we used parsimony to infer the
ancestral sequences of MH1N and MH1C in four key
ancestors: (1) the vertebrate ancestor, (2) the vertebratecephalochordate ancestor, (3) the chordate-hemichordate
ancestor, and (4) the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. We
then calculated the evolutionary distance from these
hypothetical ancestral sequences to the modern day Msx
paralogs of rodents and primates and the single Msx
sequences in the cephalochordate, Branchiostoma floridae,
the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowaleskii, and the cnidarian, Nematostella vectensis (Fig. 5). In the case of Msx2 and
Msx3, as MEME failed to identify an MH1C domain, we
omitted this domain.

This analysis suggests a trend where MH1N and MH1C are
most similar to the common ancestor of cnidarians and
bilaterians (evolutionary distance = 0.23), and they progressively diverge along the line leading to the common
ancestor of vertebrates (evolutionary distance = 0.45–
1.59). As a result of this pattern of divergence, MH1N and
MH1C remain very similar to each other in the sea anemone Nematostella, but they are increasingly distinctive in
the hemichordate, the cephalochordate and the mouse/
human. This suggests that the MH1N and MH1C domains
of cnidarians have evolved in a very conservative fashion
since pre-Cambrian times. This conclusion is bolstered by
the MEME analysis, which scored both Groucho domains

Divergence and Loss of Msx Groucho-binding Domains (MH1N and MH1C)
Divergence and Loss of Msx Groucho-binding Domains (MH1N and MH1C). The ancestral sequences of MH1N and
MH1C were inferred for four key ancestors (solid circles) based on sequences found in extant animals (right). Single alignment
gaps were removed from mouse Msx3 and Nematostella Msx (triangles). Estimated evolutionary distances were calculated from
each ancestor to its descendent(s) (ΔMH1N and ΔMH1C). Where MacClade inferred multiple possible ancestral states, the
range of possible evolutionary distances is given. The evolutionary distance between MH1N and MH1C was calculated for each
ancestor and each extant animal (1N vs. 1C). Distance calculations were not made to MH1C in Msx2 and Msx3 because no significant match to the MH1C motif was identified in these proteins.
as MH1N domains, whereas in the bilaterian Msx proteins, distinct MH1N and MH1C domains were recognized. Figure 5 also reveals relatively conservative
evolution of MH1N and MH1C in non-vertebrate deuterostomes (Branchiostoma and Saccoglossus) compared to the
vertebrate Msx paralogs.
Conserved synteny of Msx homologs in protostomes,
deuterostomes, and cnidarians
In protostomes and deuterostomes, Msx is clustered with
other homeobox genes – specifically NK and Tlx genes.
Recently, physical linkage between Msx, NK, and Tlx genes
was also reported in the genome of the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica [8]. Here, we investigated possible physical linkage between Msx, NK, and Tlx genes in the sea
anemone, Nematostella vectensis, a taxon that is phylogenetically intermediate between sponges and bilaterians. A
recent study summarized extensive conserved synteny

between Nematostella and human, but this study did not
identify linkage between Msx, NK, and Tlx in the anemone
[79]. We used BLASTx to query a Nematostella genome
assembly (JGI 1.0; [80]) with all of the homeodomain
sequences identified in a previous genome-wide survey
[2]. This search localized Nematostella Msx to the same
2.38-megabase scaffold (JGI scaffold_06) as Hmx (an NK5
ortholog), NK1, and EmxA. This Msx gene is located
17,590 nucleotides from one end of this scaffold. Msx,
Hmx, Nk1 reside within 130 kilobases of each other, with
Hmx located between Msx and Nk1. EmxA lies approximately 1Mb downstream of Nk1. Based upon conserved
synteny between human and mouse, Holland inferred the
existence of an ancestral NK-like cluster that encompassed
these same four genes, in addition to other related homeodomain genes [19]. Despite this apparently conserved
synteny between human and anemone, when we compared the first 100,000 nucleotides of this anemone scaf-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:18

fold to the non-redundant database at NCBI, we failed to
identify any further conserved synteny between human
and Nematostella. Finally, we searched the Nematostella
scaffold with human homologs of genes linked to either
human MSX1 or MSX2 using BLASTx but failed to identify
any further conserved synteny. Previously, two Msx-like
sequences were found in the Nematostella genome,
between anterior Antennapedia type Hox genes (ax9, ax1a)
and another NK type gene (HLXc-lk) [81].
The Nematostella genome has two Groucho loci encoding
nearly identical proteins
In taxa such as the sea anemone that possess two MH1
domains that are nearly identical in sequence, it is plausible to expect that they may be functionally redundant. As
this domain is implicated in binding the transcriptional
repressor Groucho, we sought to investigate whether the
diversity of Groucho-binding MH1 domains might mirror
the diversity of Groucho genes in the genome. We
searched the genome of Nematostella for Groucho/TLE
homologs. Two distinct genomic scaffolds were identified
that contain a Nematostella Groucho homolog (see Additional file 5). One of these scaffolds appears to be incompletely sequenced within the Groucho gene itself,
(Additional file 5 part B). Although the predicted proteins
encoded by these two putative Groucho genes are nearly
identical (only one amino acid difference separates
them), the predicted coding regions can be differentiated
at many silent sites, and the sizes and sequences of introns
are markedly different, suggesting these are in fact two
separate loci. Nematostella Groucho ESTs present in the
NCBI database indicate that both loci are transcribed. Presumably, both Groucho proteins can bind to either
MH1N or MH1C domain. These findings suggest that the
duplicate MH1 domains within the Nematostella Msx protein exhibit functional redundancy.
Mapping MSX1 mutations by domain
When all known disease-associated coding mutations previously identified within the human MSX1 gene are
mapped onto the protein, the mutations causing orofacial
clefting (OFC) and the mutations causing ectodermal dysplasias (ED) map to the domain architecture in a nonoverlapping fashion (Fig. 6A). OFC mutations, (shown in
dark red), [32,38] are found in and around the MH1C,
MH3 and MH6 domains, while ED mutations, (shown in
light pink), [36,37,82,83] are found within or upstream of
MH1N and within MH4 domains.

Because any functional redundancy between MSX1 and
MSX2 could mitigate the impact of particular mutations
in MSX1, and because MSX1 and MSX2 are unlikely to
exhibit functional redundancy in regions where they have
undergone extensive sequence divergence, we examined
whether the distribution of OFC and ED mutations along

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

the MSX1 protein might be correlated with the degree of
divergence between MSX1 and MSX2. Specifically, we
compared the distance between MSX1 or MSX2 and two
outgroup Msx protein sequences (from lamprey and
cephalochordate). Comparisons were first made across
the whole protein, and then separate comparisons were
performed for five different subregions of the coding
sequence (Fig. 6B). Region 1 consists of the N-terminus.
Region 2 consists of the MH1N and MH4 domains.
Region 3 spans MH3, MH2, MH1c, and the interval
between MH1C and MH1N. Region 4 comprises MH6
plus the interval between MH5 and MH6. Finally, region
5 combines regions 3 and 4. Only ED mutations are localized to regions 1 and 2, while OFC mutations are localized to regions 3–5. The pairwise distance data along with
standard errors are displayed in Additional file 6, the associated domain definitions for this alignment in Additional file 7 and these data are plotted in Fig. 6B. When we
compare homologous segments of human MSX1 and
MSX2, the greatest divergence between paralogs is found
in the N-terminal segment, and the least divergence is
found in the MH1N and MH4 domains. The outgroup
comparisons allow us to conclude that MSX2 has generally evolved at a higher rate than MSX1, but this is especially evident within certain regions. For each pairwise
comparison, across the whole protein or within particular
domains, the evolutionary distance between MSX2 and
the sequence from the outgroup taxa is almost always
greater than the distance between MSX1 and the outgroup
taxa. The lone exception comes when we use the lamprey
as the outgroup comparison for the N-terminal region of
the protein. In general, the segments that harbor OFC coding mutations in MSX1 are significantly more diverged
from MSX2 than those segments that harbor ED coding
mutations (Fig. 6B). The frameshift mutation found
within the highly variable N-terminal region is the single
exception to this pattern (see below for discussion).
Physiochemical and phylogenetic analysis of protein
polymorphisms
Missense mutations can disrupt the structure of a protein
or its intermolecular interactions, and the magnitude of
such disruptions (along with their associated phenotypic
consequences) can be predicted using either physiochemical or phylogenetic criteria. We used the program MAPP
(Multivariate Analysis of Protein Polymorphisms) to evaluate human MSX1 mutations in six different physiochemical dimensions, at three different phylogenetic depths
(human (1) inclusive of amniotes, (2) inclusive of tetrapods, and (3) inclusive of cnidarians; Fig. 7; Additional file
8). The higher the MAPP score, the less likely a given
mutation is tolerable at the given phylogenetic depth. The
analysis reveals that (1) physiochemical considerations
alone cannot predict which mutations are likely to be rare
on an evolutionary timescale, and (2) the phylogenetic

context is critical to evaluating whether a given mutation
is likely to be tolerable.

Discussion
Early evolution of Msx
Based on the conserved domain architecture within Msx
and MetaHox proteins, the conserved synteny between
diverse taxa, and a phylogenetic analysis of amino acid
sequences, we can construct a more specific and detailed
scenario for the evolution of the Msx family (Fig. 8). Combining all of the domain, phylogenetic, genomic and

divergence data above suggests that: 1) Msx likely evolved
from an ancestral MetaHox cluster gene, 2) seven ancient
domains have been highly conserved over the course of
Msx evolution, and 3) the vertebrate Msx paralogs evolved
during the two rounds of whole genome duplication, with
the MH1C domain either becoming lost or highly modified independently in both the Msx3/b/c and Msx2/d/a
lineages.

(human plus amniotes and amphibians; light grey bars), human-cnidarian (humans plus amniotes, amphibians, and cnidarians;
black bars). * Could not be calculated due to alignment gap(s).

Evolution and loss of Msx homology domains
At the time of the cnidarian-bilaterian divergence, there
existed a single ancestral Msx gene encoding seven distinct
Msx Homology (MH) domains including: two Grouchobinding domains (MH1N, MH1C), a Pbx-binding
domain (MH2), a linker region (MH3) that includes conserved phosphorylation motifs and a conserved stretch of
eight residues adjoining the amino terminus of the homeodomain (MH4), a transcriptional repression domain
(MH5), and a PIAS binding domain (MH6). Three of
these domains (MH3, MH4, and MH5) are also clearly
present in the Msx sequence of the sponge Amphimedon
queenslandica. Furthermore, as a single Groucho repression domain (MH1), a Pbx binding domain (MH2), a
homeodomain (MH4), and a transcriptional repression
domain (MH5) are shared with NK, Tlx, and Emx proteins, the domain architecture of Msx points to a common
"MetaHox" ancestry for Msx and these other homeobox
genes. As there are two MH1 domains in most eumetazoan Msx proteins, zero in the sponge Msx, and one in
other MetaHox proteins, we suggest (1) that the MetaHox

ancestor possessed one MH1 domain, (2) that the absence
of this domain in sponges is due to a secondary loss, and
(3) that the MH1 domain duplicated in a eumetazoan
Msx gene ancestor prior to the split between cnidarians
and bilaterians (Fig. 8).
The shared possession of MH domains across MetaHox
proteins could possibly be explained by convergent evolution. For example, Groucho-binding domains are found
within a phylogenetically diverse range of metazoan transcription factors, including non-homeobox transcription
factors, like Tbox, Fbox, Dorsal [46,58]. These transcription factors are all distantly related, and the shared possession of Groucho domains must reflect convergent
evolution at some level. However, a homologous origin of
the same basic domain architecture in some ancestral
MetaHox gene is suggested by the common domain order
within the Msx, NK and Tlx coding sequences, the close
phylogenetic relationship of all their homeodomain
sequences, and the evidence for ancient clustering of these
genes into MetaHox homeobox gene clusters.

[85]; 2 = divergence of Chondrichthyes from Osteichthyes = 450 MYA[109,110]. The elephant shark has four Hox clusters,
orthologous to known clusters in tetrapods, suggesting Chondrichthyes diverged after the second round of WGD but did not
undergo an additional round of duplication as did the osteichthyes. R2 WGD, origin of jawed vertebrates, divergence from
agnathans, 477 MYA [111]; 507 +/- 104 MYA, [85]; 3 = divergence of Actinopterygia and Sarcopterygia = 416 MYA [112]; 450
MYA [113]; 4 = R3 WGD within the Actinopterygia = 320 MYA [114]; 350 MYA [113]; 5 = evidence for a 4,5 and 8,10 paralogon split [85,86].

The significance of conserved synteny
The origin of Msx from an ancient MetaHox ancestor is
further supported by conserved synteny. In cnidarians
(this study) as well as protostomes, deuterostomes, and
sponges, Msx is linked to NK, Tlx and Emx genes [8,1719]. In addition, previous studies on conserved synteny
between arthropods and humans, studies that were not
specifically focused on homeobox genes, independently
revealed that humans and fruit flies share a common
ancient chromosomal segment, called a paralogon, that

corresponds to modern segments of human chromosome
4p16, 5q35, 2p/8p and 10q26 [84-86]. These very same
human genomic regions, at 4p16, 5q35 and 10q26 chromosomal bands, or their syntenic equivalent in the
mouse, are the loci for the Msx1, Msx2 or Msx3 genes,
respectively. This ancient paralogon shared by arthropods
and vertebrates duplicated twice during the two rounds of
whole genome duplication that occurred at the base of the
vertebrate radiation (Fig. 8; [87]). Importantly, the first
genome duplication led to the split between the ancestor

Page 13 of 23

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:18

of the contemporary chromosome 4/5 paralogons and the
ancestor of the contemporary chromosome 8/10 paralogons. This is consistent with the result of our phylogenetic analysis placing Msx1 and Msx2 as sister lineages
because Msx1 and Msx2 would have derived from a common ancestral sequence on the 4/5 paralogon, into their
current positions on human chromosomes 4p16 and
5q35, and would therefore share a closer relationship
with each other than with Msx3.
The findings described here are largely consistent with an
earlier study of partial Msx protein sequences derived
mainly from vertebrates [43]. Postlethwait concluded that
this phylogenetic analysis was insufficient to convincingly
resolve the relationships among the Msx1, Msx2 and Msx3
genes of tetrapods and between the tetrapod and teleost
Msx sequences. However, by adding an analysis of
human/zebrafish Msx locus synteny, he concluded that
zebrafish msxa and msxd were most likely Msx2 orthologs,
that msxe was an Msx1 ortholog and that msxc was a Msx3
ortholog. He also concluded that human MSX1 and MSX2
were most likely sister genes on chromosomes 4p and 5q
respectively. This was based upon shared orthology of
adjacent genes on each chromosome, with the Mouse
locus syntenic to human 10q behaving as the outgroup.
Finally, he concluded that the zebrafish msxb locus shared
significant synteny with the human MSX1 locus, and
therefore that msxb is more closely related to Msx1 than to
Msx2 or Msx3.
The more extensive phylogenetic analysis and additional
analysis of synteny presented here supports all but one of
these conclusions: our phylogenetic analysis contradicts
the conclusion that teleost msxb and tetrapod Msx1 are
orthologs. Our data instead suggest that the synteny data
do not unite msxb with Msx1 to the exclusion of Msx3/
msxc. For while msxb does share synteny with the Msx1
locus, it also shares substantial synteny with the msxc and
Msx3 loci. We compared the genomic context of msxb and
msxc in Danio and Fugu to that of Msx1 and Msx3 in
human and mouse (data not shown). In this analysis, the
Msx3/msxb/msxc genes are united by their closely linked
paralogs of the Adrb3, Calcyon, Adra1a, Taf5, Ste20-like
Kinase, Fgf8/17, Adam8 and Lbx1 genes. From this group,
only Calcyon is shared with the Msx1/msxe/Msx2/msxd
loci. This finding is consistent with msxb being more
closely related to msxc and Msx3 (as our phylogenetic
analysis suggests; Fig. 3) than to msxe and Msx1.
Evolutionary origins and divergence of vertebrate Msx
paralogs
The apparent sister-group relationship between Msx1 and
Msx2 has important implications for the functional evolution of vertebrate Msx proteins. It implies that the MH1C
domain was lost twice during vertebrate evolution, once

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

in the common ancestor of the tetrapod-Msx2//teleostMsxa/d genes and once in the common ancestor of the
tetrapod-Msx3//teleost-Msxb/c genes (Fig. 8). At some
point after the first of two vertebrate whole genome duplication (WGD) events, the MH1C domain was lost from
the Msxb paralog. This duplication split the ancient paralogon into distinct 4,5 and 8,10 descendants. During the
second round of WGD, these two ancestral Msx genes
were each duplicated again. The duplication of the ancestral 4/5 paralogon created the Msx1/e and Msx2/d/a lineages. The duplication of the ancestral 8/10 paralogon
created the Msx3/b/c lineage and presumably another Msx
locus on the chromosome 8 paralogon ("Msx4") that was
most likely lost prior to the divergence of the ray-finned
fishes (Actinopterygia) and lobe-finned or tetrapod (Sarcopterygia) lineages. Then the remaining three genes, (the
Msx1, 2 and 3 paralogs), were duplicated again during the
third round WGD event that took place at the base of the
teleosts, (approximately 320 MYA), creating a set of six
Msx genes in bony fishes. Subsequently, one of these was
lost, presumably the sister paralog of msxe, to create the
current set of five known Msx genes within teleosts. As
explained above, syntenic data from the zebrafish genome
are fully compatible with these data; e.g. msxa and msxd
are assigned as orthologs to human MSX2 [43]. Sometime
after the divergence of primates from rodents, the Msx3
gene was lost in the line leading to primates.
The loss of the MH1C domain from Msx2 and Msx3 protein sequence must have important functional consequences because throughout most of animal evolution,
the two Groucho-binding domains of Msx1 have been
conserved, and they have remained highly similar in
sequence. Strong similarity between MH1N and MH1C
has been preserved in the Msx proteins of contemporary
cnidarians (coral, sea anemone) and non-vertebrate deuterostomes (cephalochordate and hemichordate), and we
can infer that it was present in both the ancestral chordate
and the last common ancestor of vertebrate Msx paralogs
(Fig. 5).
Msx1 and Msx2 have also diverged significantly in the
region surrounding the MH6 domain, a region implicated
in binding the PIAS protein. Correspondingly, Msx1 and
Msx2 have been shown to bind to different paralogs of the
PIAS protein family [72]. It is possible that such paralog
co-evolution may partially explain the sequence divergence and differing mutation phenotypes of the MH1N
and MH1C domains. Takahashi et al., 2008 demonstrated
differential binding of a groucho protein, Grg1 to the
nearly identical MH1s of Nematostella [9]. It remains to be
seen if this result represents a positional effect within the
anemone Msx protein or whether this reflects differential
binding affinities in different groucho paralogs.

Collectively, these data suggest that a process of duplicate
gene subfunctionalization, followed by neofunctionalization eventually led to divergent protein functions. The
sequence diversification of Msx1 and Msx2 following their
descent from a common ancestral gene has most likely
reduced the degree of functional redundancy, which can
directly impact the phenotypic consequences of mutations at either locus.
Mutations
The evolutionary analysis presented here provides a backdrop against which we can evaluate particular coding variants and rate their likelihood of being not merely allelic
polymorphisms but disease causing mutations. While
identification of mutations among the syndromic, Mendelian disease cases is clear-cut, discriminating true mutations from inconsequential sequence variants in complex
disease cases remains controversial, even when supported
by genetic data [32-34]. By reconstructing the gain and
loss of conserved motifs, and by tracking the diversification of Msx proteins over evolutionary time, we can more
easily recognize those human variants that appear incongruous with evolutionarily conserved protein functions.
This insight is all the more important since it is probable
that complex disease alleles will include weaker mutations that can be difficult to discriminate from background population variants.

Not surprisingly, according to the MAPP analysis, some of
the human coding mutations most likely to disrupt critical functions are found at the most conserved positions
within the most conserved domains. This is exemplified
by the M61K mutation with the MH1N, and the R196P,
A219T and A221E mutations within the homeodomain.
However, the analysis also flags mutations that do not
reside within conserved domains, such as the G98E mutation, which is found in the region between the highly conserved MH1N and MH1C domains. The MAPP scores for
this mutation are uniformly high at all phylogenetic
depths examined, suggesting that such a mutation could
disrupt some long-conserved function of the protein. Several of the other variants associated with orofacial clefting
cases have intermediate MAPP scores perhaps indicative
of milder disease alleles.
It is still not possible to definitively decide if the P147Q
variant is a weak allele or simply a population-specific variant, as suggested by Tongkobpetch and co-workers [34],
and further summarized and evaluated among a large set
(5641 individuals) of proband, case family and control
individuals [74]. In the latter study, 7 individuals with the
P147Q variant displayed a clefting phenotype among a
total of 16 carriers with this variant. However, this work
identified one family where the P147Q variant did not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

segregate with the phenotype, again illustrating where the
existing genetic data are equivocal. It is interesting that
both the P147Q and R151S variants may disrupt potential, conserved phosphorylation motifs within the MH3
domain [74], the region defined as the linker region
between the Pbx binding MH2 domain and the homeodomain. Interestingly, among Hox proteins, linker phosphorylation motifs may be deeply conserved [75]. The
current data, together with all the previous genetic data,
are consistent with the possibility that the P147Q variant,
(as well as the E78V variant found amongst Filipino case
and control individuals), represents a slightly deleterious
allele that was fixed as a result of genetic drift in an initially small effective population [88-90]. Further genetic
studies are warranted on these particular alleles.
Although the frameshift mutation that causes selective
tooth loss, G22RfsX168, lies within the N-terminal coding
segment, this mutation really just represents a complete
haploinsufficiency of the protein [91]. This result is consistent with earlier findings that complete haploinsufficiency of MSX1, through mutation at R196P [67] or
deletion of one MSX1 gene copy [92] causes ectodermal
dysplasia-associated phenotypes, like tooth agenesis. This
region also contains three missense mutations found in a
high proportion of control samples [32], shown with
black arrowheads in Fig. 6. The higher pairwise substitution distances and variability identified within the N-terminal region (Fig. 6B) is consistent with this region being
subject to minimal functional constraint, further suggesting that these variants may be coding variants without
phenotypic consequences.
The MAPP analysis, like any phylogenetically based analysis, is affected by the inclusion of taxa. Therefore, it
comes as no surprise that MAPP comparisons within different phylogenetic contexts produced different scores. In
general, variants evaluated by reference to the humanamniote alignments produced the highest MAPP scores,
because with less time for divergence, there are fewer substitutions and any change is likely to appear unusual. For
example, when the G116E mutation, which resides within
MH1C, is compared against the backdrop of amniote or
tetrapod Msx1 proteins, its MAPP scores are among the
highest. However, the score drops dramatically when that
comparison includes cnidarian sequences. This position is
almost uniformly conserved back to the base of the tetrapods, being either glycine or a similarly aliphatic residue
(Additional file 1 page 4). However in taxa that diverged
before the fish-tetrapod split, it is not uncommon to have
a negatively charged residue (aspartic acid or glutamic
acid) in this position. The tolerance for a negatively
charged residue at this position is reflected in Fig. 5, where
the vertebrate-cephalochordate ancestor is inferred to
have a glutamic acid at this position, the same residue that

is found in the corresponding position within MH1N.
Interestingly, the inferred residue at this position in the
vertebrate ancestor is ambiguous, being either glutamic
acid or glycine. However, it appears that since the tetrapods diverged from fish, the MH1C accepts only hydrophobic residues in this region. This is consistent with the
evolution of a novel function for the MH1C domain and
with the disruption of that function by the G116E substitution.
Another interesting variant, also found within the MH1C
domain, is the V114G mutation. The small physiochemical difference between valine and glycine produces only
moderately high scores at all depths. However, the MAPP
score for this position was one of only three positions that
increased substantially when the alignments were made to
taxa with deeper divergence times. The deep conservation
at this position is reflected in the position-specific
sequence matrices (Fig. 2). In both the MH1N and MH1C
domains, this valine position exhibits the highest bit
score, reflecting its prominent role in the canonical
sequence motif for these domains. Since valine is conserved at this position across so many diverse taxa, representing billions of years of cumulative divergence, it is
highly likely that the presence of a glycine does represent
a real, though perhaps weak disease allele. In summary,
this phylogenomic analysis allows these disease associated sequence variants to be quantified and prioritized for
future clinical and functional studies.
Non-random distribution of mutations in Msx1
The nonrandom distribution of mutations for either ectodermal dysplasia or orofacial clefting across the MH
domains suggests some unexplained genotype-phenotype
correlation. The pairwise distance data (Fig. 6B) reveal
that the OFC mutations are localized to regions of the protein that have diverged substantially between MSX1 and
MSX2. Of course part of this divergence was the loss of the
MH1C domain from MSX2. In addition, in MSX1, MH1C
has diverged more than its MH1N since the time after the
second whole genome duplication event of vertebrates.
Just as different PIAS proteins bind to the MH6 of MSX1
or MSX2, it is possible that different Groucho proteins
bind to MH1N and MH1C in MSX1. In tetrapods, paralog
coevolution might explain the divergence in sequence and
presumably function for the MH1C domain of MSX1.
Thus these data are compatible with a model incorporating differential pleiotropy and redundancy of selector protein modules [93], as perhaps exemplified in the present
context by the putative PIAS paralog/Msx-MH6 domain
co-evolution.

The most likely explanation for the preliminary genotypephenotype correlation is that those mutations associated
with clefting disorders act by a dominant negative mecha-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

nism. Clearly the MH1C domain has a discrete function,
as it has been conserved in different lineages for billions
of years. Our evidence suggests that the MH1C domain
may have evolved into a more derived function since the
origin of the jawed vertebrates, perhaps involving a coevolving Groucho paralog. As Msx proteins can form
homo and heterodimers with other homeodomains, a
missense mutation that disrupts the conserved functions
of either MH1C or MH6 could conceivably disrupt the
function of additional proteins and manifest itself as a
strong dominant negative mutation.
The milder ectodermal dysplasia phenotypes of the
MSX1-MH1N and MSX1-MH4 domain mutations can be
explained by functional redundancy from the MSX2
domains. As Figure 6 demonstrates that the MH1 and
MH4 domains of both MSX1 and MSX2 are highly conserved sequences, this suggests possible functional buffering when MSX1 and MSX2 are co-expressed. Only one
published study has reported a mutation in a family with
both clefting and ectodermal dysplasia phenotypes [38].
This was a nonsense mutation (S105X) in the coding
interval between the MH1N and MH1C domains. Consistent with all the data above, this mutation might be
explained by a combination of haploinsufficiency of most
of the protein in combination with a dominant negative
mechanism acting through the MH1N domain. However
all such scenarios remain just speculation until functional
studies can shed further light on these possibilities. We
must also recognize that the number of mutations
reported for MSX1 is still relatively small. In addition, the
more minor ectodermal phenotypes may have been
under-ascertained in reports concerning the more severe
orofacial clefting phenotype.
With the above caveats in mind, the phylogenomic analysis presented here provides a strong intellectual foundation for future in vivo and in vitro functional studies of
these mutations. This study may also contribute to diagnostic and preventive interventions wherein such slightly
deleterious, complex disease alleles may be overcome by
providing an optimal prenatal environment [94-97].
In the future, it may be possible to perform a similar analysis on MSX2 mutations. This is not yet possible as there
is a relative dearth of missense MSX2 mutations outside
the homeodomain. The collection of human MSX2 mutations (reported on OMIM, *123101) presently consists
mostly of loss-of-function mutations (i.e., premature stop
codons), homeodomain missense mutations, or
frameshift mutations that disrupt/prevent DNA binding
and result in parietal foramina (OMIM #168500). There is
one gain of function mutation, the Boston type or craniosynostosis type 2 (OMIM #604757), which results from
increased homeodomain DNA binding affinity.

Does the MetaHox cluster represent an animal specific
homeobox clade?
In tracing the ancient origin of the Msx Homology coding
domains, we found evidence for similar domain architecture in the other descendants of the MetaHox gene cluster.
This basic domain architecture could represent a MetaHox
synapomorphy, a shared derived trait that unites the Msx,
NK, and Tlx genes. This suggests that we can define a
monophyletic MetaHox clade comprising Msx, NK, and
Tlx genes. In this regard, it is quite encouraging that the
NK, Tlx and Demox genes from basal taxa exhibit solid
matches to the most conserved MH domains.

The membership of this MetaHox clade may extend to the
EHGbox, Hox, and ParaHox genes, if these genes are also
descended from a MetaHox ancestor. This possibility is
suggested by the presence of Msx, Emx, Tlx, and NK genes
and the absence of true Hox and ParaHox genes in the
sponges [8]. Similarly, NK and Tlx genes but no Hox or
ParaHox genes have been recovered from the ctenophore
Mnemiopsis [98]. The sponges are widely regarded as the
most basal animal phylum, although a recent phylogenomic analysis raises the possibility that ctenophores
might be basal to sponges [99]. A MetaHox ancestry of
Hox and ParaHox genes is also consistent with recently
published homeodomain phylogenies in which Msx,
Emx, Tlx are basal to the Hox-ParaHox radiation (e.g.,
[2]). Finally, physical linkage data from the sponge
Amphimedon are consistent with NK-like (i.e., MetaHox)
genes predating the origin of the Hox and ParaHox clusters
[8].
If Hox and ParaHox genes are derived members of a MetaHox clade, then we should utilize basal MetaHox outgroups to root the evolution of Hox and ParaHox genes.
For example, it may be that the evolution of Hox and
ParaHox genes was accompanied by the loss of a Groucho-binding domain and other MetaHox domains. Additional evidence of a MetaHox origin of Hox genes comes
from an analysis of residues in the PBX binding domain
(homologous to MH2) that are characteristic of "anterior"
Hox proteins [73]. In anterior Hox proteins, the conserved
tryptophan in the PBX-binding domain is preceded by
phenylalanine and proline. This is also true of Msx proteins from basal taxa (Additional file 1 page 5). In addition, the residues found at positions 8 and 13 of the Msx
homeodomain (F and L, respectively) are functionally
important amino acids that again define anterior homeodomain proteins [75]. These shared residues in the PBXbinding domain and homeodomain of Msx and anterior
Hox genes suggest a possible evolutionary affinity,
wherein primitive anterior Hox genes may have evolved
from ancestral Msx genes. This is consistent with the oldest Hox-ParaHox genes being the anterior members of
that clade, as recently suggested [81]. As further support

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

for the retention of homologous residues by Msx and
anterior Hox proteins, of all the Amphimedon sponge
homeobox proteins, Msx is most similar to the Hox protein sequences [8].
As the original concept of "MetaHox genes" ([17]; equivalent to the "NK-like genes" independently defined by
Pollard and Holland, [61]) did not include EHGbox, Hox,
or ParaHox genes, MetaHox as presently defined is a paraphyletic grouping. However, if some urMetaHox gene is
the source for the Msx, Tlx, NK, EHGbox, Hox and ParaHox genes of extant animals, we can define an animal-specific MetaHox clade. As meta can mean transforming, this
would be an appropriate appellation for these archetypal
metazoan developmental genes.

Conclusion
The results described above all revolve around the role of
duplication events on different scales and how these
events relate to the subsequent evolution of the taxa
involved. On the smallest scale, we provide evidence for
the duplication of a Groucho repression domain within
an ancient Msx ancestor. This Msx gene itself was likely
created by the duplication and subsequent divergence of
an ancestral urMetaHox gene. Finally, the vertebrate Msx
gene ancestor was most likely duplicated during the two
rounds of whole genome duplication that occurred at the
base of the vertebrate radiation.
As with gene duplications, domain duplications can provide a measure of functional redundancy, and such redundancy may facilitate the evolutionary diversification of
protein sequences. As Groucho domains are involved in
the long-range repression of chromatin, the duplicate
Groucho repression domains present in Msx proteins may
augment the multimeric assembly of Groucho proteins,
and this could be favored by selection, explaining why
two highly similar Groucho-binding domains have been
conserved over the last 500+ million years of evolution in
cnidarians and cephalochordates. However, the subsequent genome and Msx gene duplications in vertebrates
would have superimposed an additional level of functional redundancy, perhaps facilitated by paralog co-evolution (of the Groucho and PIAS families). This may have
allowed for the divergence of the MH1N and MH1C, ultimately resulting in the loss of MH1C in both the Msx2
and Msx3 lineages.
Since duplicate domains and duplicate genes provide two
possible layers of functional redundancy, the interpretation of mutations becomes more complex. For example,
several scenarios could explain the finding that mutations
in the MH1N and MH1C domains of MSX1 result in different human disease phenotypes. This could reflect the
fact that these domains have undergone a significant func-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:18

tional divergence. However, this could also reflect partial
functional overlap between Msx paralogs, such that Msx2
may compensate for mutations in Msx1 where these two
proteins share a domain (e.g., MH1N), but it may be unable to compensate for mutations in a domain of Msx1 that
is lacking in Msx2. While the details remain to be worked
out, these data in total suggest that duplicate protein
domains may provide the initial redundancy that allows
the evolution of coding domain subfunctions, even
within a vitally important, pleiotropically expressed regulatory gene like Msx1. These results also raise the fascinating possibility that the divergence of MH domains within
vertebrates might be responsible for vertebrate specific
developmental trajectories aligned with alternate chromatin states.

Methods
Sequence retrieval
We obtained predicted amino acid sequences for 46 Msx
proteins from representative poriferans, cnidarians, protostomes, and deuterostomes. To represent cnidarians, we
selected Msx sequences from a sea anemone (Nematostella
vectensis, BAG11598) and a coral (Acropora millepora;
ABK41269). Single Msx proteins were retrieved from one
lophotrochozoan protostome (Platynereis; CAJ38810),
three non-vertebrate deuterostomes (Branchiostoma
[ABD97280], Saccoglossus [ABD97280], and Heliocidaris
[AAY86178]) and one jawless craniate Petromyzon
[ABW76121]. Msx1, Msx2 and Msx3 paralogs of tetrapod
vertebrates were retrieved from mammals (Homo

Protein domain identification
Conserved protein domains were identified using MEME
(Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation;
http://meme.nbcr.net; [100]). As the selection of taxa can
bias the identification of domains, we began by comparing a small set of deeply diverged taxa in order to avoid
over-weighting lineage-specific protein features; we compared human MSX1 with the only known Msx proteins
from a cephalochordate, a tunicate, an echinoderm, a
polychaete worm, and a coral. We subsequently compared a broad selection of Msx paralogs from tetrapods
and fishes along with single Msx proteins from non-vertebrate deuterostomes (cephalochordate, tunicate, hemichordate, echinoderm) and a polychaete annelid.
Parameter settings within MEME were as follows: occurrences of a single motif = any number; minimum length
of a motif = 8 amino acids; maximum length of a motif =
68. Setting the maximum domain length to 68 identified
as a single domain a region spanning the canonical 60amino acid homeodomain plus eight highly conserved
amino acids immediately upstream of the homeodomain,
the so-called "N8" domain. This setting gave the smallest
domain that included the homeodomain. Once domain
patterns were identified by MEME, we then searched
online protein databases for similar motif patterns via a
Hidden Markov Model based approach using the program
MetaMEME [101].
Multisequence alignments
Msx protein sequences were aligned using the Clustal
alignment tool found within the MEGA 4.0 program
under the default settings [76]. This was accomplished in

Page 18 of 23

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:18

several reproducible steps. First, a master alignment was
generated using the Msx sequences from two cnidarians
and two non-vertebrate deuterostomes (Nematostella,
Acropora, Saccoglossus and Branchiostoma). In order that the
motifs identified by MEME remain in register, the master
alignment was assembled in three separate blocks. The
first block encompassed all of the residues from the start
methionine to the highly conserved phenylalanine in the
MH1N motif. The second block extended from the same
highly conserved phenylalanine in MH1N to the conserved tryptophan in MH2 (the hexapeptide). The third
block extended from the tryptophan in MH2 to the end of
the protein. Each of these blocks was separately aligned
with Clustal using the default parameters. The resulting
master alignment maintained all of the conserved motifs
in register. The other MSX sequences were then aligned to
the master alignment, once again in three separate blocks.
The highly divergent MSX sequences from the clamworm
Platynereis and the sea urchin Heliocidaris were excluded
from the alignment because their presence proved highly
disruptive. We also produced a gap-free alignment by
eliminating all positions harboring alignment gaps in the
master alignment. Both the master alignment (Additional
File 1 page1-8) and the gap-free alignment (Additional
File 4 page 1-2) were used in the phylogenetic analyses.
Estimating the best model of amino acid substitution
The best model of the amino acid substitution process was
chosen from among 80 possible models using the program ProtTest 1.3 [102] for both the full alignment and
the gap-free alignment. The substitution process was estimated simultaneously along with the tree topology and
branch lengths. For both the full alignment and the gapfree alignment, the empirically determined JTT substitution matrix [103] outperformed other substitution matrices, and incorporating rate variation among sites
significantly improved the model (gamma distribution of
rate variation among sites, α = 1.2).
Reconstructing the evolution of motifs MH1N and MH1C
The ancestral sequences of MH1N and MH1C were
inferred for four key ancestors (the vertebrate ancestor, the
vertebrate-cephalochordate ancestor, the chordate-hemichordate ancestor, and the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor)
based on sequences found in five extant animals: Homo,
Mus, Branchiostoma, Saccoglossus, and Nematostella. To
facilitate comparisons between MH1N and MH1C, only
the conserved core of the domain was used (FSVXXXXXX).
In all but two instances, the sequences used for the extant
animals were taken directly from the alignment (see Additional file 1). However, in the case of MH1N from mouse
Msx3 and MH1C from Nematostella Msx, single alignment
gaps were removed. Ancestral character states were
inferred using MacClade (version 4.03). Where the ancestral character state was ambiguous, all plausible character

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/18

states identified by the program were considered in subsequent distance calculations. For both MH1N and MH1C,
evolutionary distances were calculated from each ancestor
to its descendent(s) using the JTT distance matrix. Where
MacClade inferred multiple possible ancestral states, the
range of possible evolutionary distances were calculated.
In addition, the evolutionary distance between MH1N
and MH1C was calculated for each ancestor and each
extant animal. Distance calculations were not made to
MH1C in Msx2 and Msx3 because no significant match to
the MH1C motif was identified in these proteins.
Evolutionary pairwise distance calculation
Using MEGA (v. 4.0), pairwise evolutionary distances
were calculated between human MSX1 and MSX2, shark
Msx1, Lamprey MsxA (ABW76121) and the single Msx
from Amphioxus (Additional file 6). Individual domains
defined by MEME were delineated within MEGA, so distance calculations could be made on a domain-bydomain basis (Additional file 7). After the deletion of all
alignment gaps, each pairwise distance was calculated
from 1000 bootstrapped datasets using the JTT substitution matrix, assuming homogenous rates among lineages.
Rate variation among sites was assumed to be different,
with the gamma parameter set to 1.00. Results were
graphed with GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Phylogenetic analysis
The evolutionary relationships among 44 Msx class genes
were estimated by neighbor-joining [104] using the computer package Phylip (version 3.6.1; [105]). Distances
among homeodomains were calculated using the ProtDist
program of Phylip and the James-Taylor-Thorton (JTT)
distance matrix [103]. Support for clades on the neighborjoining tree was assessed by 1000-replicates of the bootstrap [106]. The tree was re-drawn and re-rooted using the
cnidarian sequences as an outgroup with the computer
program MacClade, version 4.03 [107].

The three possible topologies relating vertebrate Msx1,
Msx2, and Msx3 were explicitly compared using a smaller
dataset. The ingroup consisted of Msx1, Msx2, and Msx3
proteins from Mus, Rattus, and Monodelphis, the only taxa
for which all three paralogs were represented. The outgroup consisted of the single Msx sequences from the sea
anemone, Nematostella, and the lancelet, Branchiostoma.
Both neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees
were constructed for these eleven taxa using the fulllength alignment. Distances between sequences were calculated using the JTT matrix, with and without rate variation among sites (the gamma parameter was set to 1.2).
The support for alternate hypotheses was evaluated using
1000 replicates of the bootstrap [106]. Maximum likelihood analyses were also performed on the same dataset,

Page 19 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:18

once again using the JTT substitution matrix, with and
without rate variation among sites. Support for alternate
hypotheses was evaluated by (1) comparing the likelihood of the alternate topologies and (2) comparing the
bootstrap support for each of the three possible pairings
of Msx1, Msx2 and Msx3.
Evaluation of physiochemical changes in amino acid
variants
The Multivariate Analysis of Protein Polymorphism program (MAPP) found online at: http://mendel.stan
ford.edu/SidowLab/, was used to evaluate the physiochemical disruption of amino acid substitutions and the
tolerance for a particular amino acid at a particular position within Msx1 proteins over evolutionary time [108].
The alignments and tree topologies with branch lengths
utilized in this analysis were derived from the Msx1, Msxe
and prevertebrate Msx1 ortholog full sequence alignment,
as described above. Those sites labeled with N/A in Additional file 8 had no MAPP score because of too many gaps
in the alignment.
