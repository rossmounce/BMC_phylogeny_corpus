Abstract
Background: Multi-drug resistance and severe/complicated cases are the emerging phenotypes of vivax malaria,
which may deteriorate current anti-malarial control measures. The emergence of these phenotypes could be
associated with either of the two Plasmodium vivax lineages. The two lineages had been categorized as Old World
and New World, based on geographical sub-division and genetic and phenotypical markers. This study revisited
the lineage hypothesis of P. vivax by typing the distribution of lineages among global isolates and evaluated their
genetic relatedness using a panel of new mini-satellite markers.
Methods: 18S SSU rRNA S-type gene was amplified from 420 Plasmodium vivax field isolates collected from
different geographical regions of India, Thailand and Colombia as well as four strains each of P. vivax originating
from Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand (Pak Chang), and Vietnam (ONG). A mini-satellite marker panel was then
developed to understand the population genetic parameters and tested on a sample subset of both lineages.
Results: 18S SSU rRNA S-type gene typing revealed the distribution of both lineages (Old World and New World) in
all geographical regions. However, distribution of Plasmodium vivax lineages was highly variable in every
geographical region. The lack of geographical sub-division between lineages suggests that both lineages are
globally distributed. Ten mini-satellites were scanned from the P. vivax genome sequence; these tandem repeats
were located in eight of the chromosomes. Mini-satellites revealed substantial allelic diversity (7-21, AE = 14.6 ± 2.0)
and heterozygosity (He = 0.697-0.924, AE = 0.857 ± 0.033) per locus. Mini-satellite comparison between the two
lineages revealed high but similar pattern of genetic diversity, allele frequency, and high degree of allele sharing.
A Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic tree derived from genetic distance data obtained from ten mini-satellites also
placed both lineages together in every cluster.
Conclusions: The global lineage distribution, lack of genetic distance, similar pattern of genetic diversity, and allele
sharing strongly suggested that both lineages are a single species and thus new emerging phenotypes associated with
vivax malaria could not be clearly classified as belonging to a particular lineage on basis of their geographical origin.

cases in India annually [8].

allopatric speciation. Plasmodium falciparum microsatellite studies have revealed strong bio-geographic population sub-structuring [9-11]. Likewise, P. vivax isolates
have displayed weak population sub-structuring and
shown a global population structure in several studies
[12-14]. Li et al. categorized P. vivax into two distinct
lineages for the first time as being Old World and New
World [15] on the basis of linkage between phenotypic
and genetic markers in a wide range of P. vivax strains.
The distinction between the two lineages was (1) distinct geographic distribution, (2) differences in mosquito
transmission potential, (3) fixation of the S-type polymorph from the 18S small subunit ribosomal protein
gene, and (4) nucleotide substitution in open reading
frame 470 (orf 470) from the apicoplast genome. Plasmodium vivax isolates from the American continent
were designated as New World and parasite isolates
from rest of the world as Old World and they claimed
that the New World lineage should be designated as a
new subspecies of P. vivax [15].
Neutral genetic loci (tandem repeats) are considered
potential genetic markers for unravelling an organism’s
genetic structure, population and evolutionary history.
Many population studies have exploited polymorphism in
two kinds of neutral loci: SNPs in putative housekeeping
genes, and length polymorphism in microsatellites and
mini-satellites. Genome sequence of P. vivax has revealed
huge number of mini-satellites [16]. Genome-wide polymorphic microsatellite and mini-satellite markers have
been widely used for detecting human malaria parasite
population structure and genetic diversity [12,14,17-20].
The emergence of multi-drug resistance and vivax
malaria-associated severe/complicated phenotypes now
being reported from most vivax malaria dominated countries [2-7] could lead to the assumption that either Old
World or New World parasites may have made a major
contribution towards these phenotypes’ emergence if
both lineages (Old World and New World) are really
genetically different. Furthermore, preliminary work carried out in the National Institute of Malaria Research
(NIMR) in India has revealed the presence of both
lineages on the Indian subcontinent [21], thus challenging Li et al’s hypothesis. The established P. vivax lineage
hypothesis has thus been questioned in this paper to
uncover P. vivax lineages’ genetic relatedness using a
panel of neutral genomic markers.

Methods
Parasite isolates and DNA isolation

Four hundred and twenty Plasmodium vivax field isolates
were analysed; they were collected from nine geographical populations from the Indian subcontinent (N = 354),
three Colombian regions (N = 30), and a single Thai
region (N = 36), as well as four parasite strains each from

Page 2 of 9

Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand (Pak Chang), and Vietnam
(ONG). Details of individual study sites such as location,
parasite and vector species prevalence and disease transmission pattern, are given in Additional file 1. Genomic
DNA was extracted using QIAamp mini DNA kit
(Qiagen, Germany) from microscopically diagnosed
P. vivax-positive blood spotted on Whatman filter paper
(3 mm) strips. Three punches (5 mm diameter) of dried
blood spots were used for DNA isolation for each sample,
as per kit manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted in
sterile triple distilled water and stored at -20°C for future
use.
Ethics statement

The National Institute of Malaria Research’s ethics committee approved the study protocol and all blood spots
were collected with the written consent of the patients
and/or and their legal guardians.
Identification of mini-satellites

Tandem Repeat Finder (TRF) software version 4.00 [22]
was used for the identification of mini-satellites from
P. vivax genome sequence. Contig-wise sequence of
P. vivax genome was scanned for up to 30 nucleotide
repeat motif. TRF scan result was filtered according to several parameters such as alignment maximum score to
individual repeat motif, minimum number of Indel (insertions/deletions), unit of repeat motif, number of repeat
motif (copy number), less number of mismatch in repeats
and high percent identity. All the parameters were given
an equal weight during mini-satellite selection and 8-15
nucleotide repeat motifs with 95-100% identity were
selected.
PCR amplification and tandem repeat genotyping

A touchdown PCR method was used for the amplifying
the 18S SSU rRNA S-type gene from P. vivax isolates.
Touchdown PCR conditions were: initial denaturation
95°C/5 min, and ten cycles consisting of: denaturation
95°C/20 s (s), annealing 65°C/30s and extension at 72°C/
45 s. Annealing temperature was reduced by 1°C in each
cycle until reaching 55°C. At this annealing temperature
(55°C), 35 additional cycles were run, followed by a final
extension step at 72°C/10 min. PCR conditions for minisatellite amplification were as follows: initial denaturation
95°C/5 min, denaturation 95°C/30s, specific annealing
temperature depending on the selected marker/30s and
extension at 72°C/45 s for 35 cycles, and a final extension
at 72°C/10 min. Annealing temperatures for each minisatellite and PCR primer sequences of selected genes/loci
are shown in Table 1. All PCR amplification reactions
were carried out in a 20.0 μL final volume; 1-2 μL (~ 35 ng) template DNA, 10 pM each primer, 2X Master Mix
(10.0 μL) (Promega or Qiagen).

High-resolution metaphor agarose (3-4% gel) was used for mini-satellite allele sizing. A fixed electrophoresis protocol (2 h @ 80 V) was used for all experiments
for consistency in allele sizing. A 20 bp DNA ladder and Genetool software were used (SynGene Inc., UK) for allele sizing.

Single clone infection typing

As multi-clone isolates could mislead correct genotyping
and lead to over-estimating genetic diversity in a multilocus genotyping study, Pvmsp-3a PCR-RFLP analysis was
used to identify single- and multi-clone infections [23];
only single-clone infection samples (n = 96) originating
from five geographical regions of India (Delhi, Chennai,
Nadiad, Panna and Sonapur) were used for multi-locus
genotyping.
Measures of genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis

Mini-satellite genetic diversity was measured by calculating virtual heterozygosity (He) for each locus using
microsatellite analyzer (MSA) version 4.00 [24]. Virtual
heterozygosity (He) was defined as [n/(n - 1)] [1 - Σpi2],
where n was the number of isolates analysed and pi was
the frequency of the ith allele in the population. MEGA
version 4.00 [25,26] was used for un-rooted NeighbourJoining phylogenetic tree reconstruction method to
understand the genetic relatedness of P. vivax S type-1
and S type-2 lineages.

Results
Geographic mapping of S type-1 and S type-2 lineages

The 18S SSU rRNA S-type gene was amplified from 420
P. vivax isolates from the Indian subcontinent (N = 354),
Thailand (N = 36) and Colombia (N = 30) and four

strains each from Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand (Pak
Chang), and Vietnam (ONG). Amplified S type 18S SSU
rRNA DNA consisted of two PCR fragments in each sample, one having consistent size called A-type (390 bp) and
a second variable sized fragment called S-type (either
480 bp or 450 bp). 480 bp and 450 bp PCR fragments
were designated as S type-1 and S type-2, respectively
(Figure 1) and served as molecular markers for identifying Old World and New World lineages of P. vivax,
respectively [15]. A fair number of both P. vivax lineages
were found on the Indian subcontinent, Thailand and
Colombia; however, their distribution in geographical
regions was highly variable (Figure 2). By contrast, two
P. vivax strains from Central America (Nicaragua and
Panama) were genotyped as being S type-2 lineage and
two strains from Southeast Asia (Thailand and Vietnam)
as S type-1 lineage, indicating geographical sub-division
observed between Old World and New World P. vivax
strains could be by chance. The P. vivax lineage distribution pattern for global isolates suggested a lack of parasite
bio-geographic structure between New World and Old
World regions; varied P. vivax lineage distribution
throughout geographical regions was not associated with
vivax or falciparum malaria or vector species prevalence
(Table 2). High Old World lineage frequency was found
with the Anopheles minimus malaria vector in the northeastern part of India and Thailand; however, this pattern

was not consistent since one study site from Colombia
revealed 100% Old World-type prevalence with different
malaria vectors (Anopheles albimanus and Anopheles
darlingi).
Pattern of genetic diversity between S type-1 and
S type-2 lineages

Ten mini-satellites were scanned from the P. vivax genome sequence; these tandem repeats were located in eight
of the chromosomes (Table 3). All selected mini-satellites
were highly polymorphic (Figure 3). A substantial number
of alleles per locus (7-21, AE = 14.6 ± 2.0) were observed

Page 4 of 9

at all mini-satellites under study except for a single locus
(Minisat 8), which showed seven alleles. However, average
heterozygosity was very high at all studied loci in P. vivax
field isolates (He = 0.697-0.924, AE = 0.857 ± 0.033).
Allelic diversity, frequency distribution and sharing as
well as heterozygosity were compared between P. vivax
lineages. Total allelic diversity of mini-satellites was high
and similar in both lineages. A high degree of alleles in
mini-satellites (66%, 96/146) was shared between both
lineages (Figure 4). Allele frequency per locus varied
considerably; however, allele frequencies were evenly
distributed between the lineages (Figure 5). Heterozygosity analysis revealed a similar mini-satellite genetic
diversity pattern between both lineages (Figure 6). Thus,
allelic diversity, sharing, distribution frequency and heterozygosity between both lineages revealed a similar pattern; however, a high degree of genetic diversity could
only be expected from older species compared to newly
evolved/established species.
Genetic relationship of S type-1 and S type-2 lineages
of P. vivax

Unrooted Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic trees were
constructed using 10 mini-satellite multi-locus genetic
distance data. The phylogenetic tree showed five clusters
having a high degree of divergence among isolates; however, no cluster was specific for any of the two lineages
(Figure 7), indicating no distinction between both
lineages. As per Li et al’s hypothesis, it was assumed that

Both lineages’ global distribution contradicted Li et al’s Old and New World lineages hypothesis; however, the sympatric distribution of lineages was not
sufficient to refute the two-lineage hypothesis; rather, understanding their genetic relatedness would seem to be more important. Ninety-six single-clone isolates
(48 S type-1 and 48 S type-2) were selected and characterized using a panel of mini-satellite markers to unravel genetic relatedness between P. vivax lineages.

S type-1 and S type-2 isolates would have their separate
phylogenetic cluster.

Discussion
This study reports large-scale geographical mapping of
the two Plasmodium vivax lineages on global isolates
(Indian subcontinent, Thailand, and Colombia) and their
genetic relatedness using a panel of neutral genomic
markers. This study revealed that both P. vivax lineages
have a global distribution and that their genetic structure has not been maintained between Old World and
New World regions, and strongly suggests that both
lineages are a population from a single species.
The global distribution of P. vivax Old World and New
World lineages clearly demonstrates a lack of geographical
subdivision; however, it cannot be concluded that they
form a single species based only on a lack of geographical

subdivision, as both lineages may have attained geographical sympatricity due to a gene flow mechanism. Their
genetic relatedness was characterized by using 48 S type-1
and 48 S type-2 lineage samples to rule this out. The
genetic relatedness analysis showed that both proposed
genetic lineages were from the same P. vivax population
based on the lack of genetic distance, similar genetic diversity magnitude, and no separate phylogenetic clade/cluster.
As per Li et al., it was assumed that S type-2 lineage (New
World) is a recently evolved species and it was expected
that S type-2 lineage would be less diverse, and form a
separate phylogenetic clade, if the hypothesis was correct.
However, the panel of genomic markers consistently
revealed similar patterns with all parameters used, providing no support for the hypothesis that S type-2 lineage is a
subspecies of P. vivax. This clearly suggested that S type

vivax isolates from Old world and New World regions, in

several studies, are also in strong support of the findings
here reported [12-14].

Figure 4 Allele sharing in mini-satellites between S type-1 and S type-2 lineages.

Although the present study has revealed a higher level of
genetic diversity compared to that previously reported
for P. vivax mini-satellites [28], this might be due to the
random mating nature of Indian P. vivax field isolates
[29]. The higher degree of genetic polymorphism displayed by Indian P. vivax field isolates in earlier studies
[21,29-34] also supports our findings. This study successfully uncovered a substantial amount of neutral genetic
variation in field isolates, implying their potential use as
molecular markers in identifying population structures
and relapse and recrudescence infection studies.

Conclusions
The findings have thus revealed that the Plasmodium
vivax two-lineage hypothesis is unlikely; the dimorphism
observed in S type 18S SSU rRNA gene represents only
two alleles and both lineages are a single P. vivax species.
The mini-satellite marker panel developed here is highly
polymorphic and could be employed in therapeutic efficacy, infection relapse, and population structure studies.

among global field isolates but not in parasite strains). The
observations reported by Li et al. might have been due to
their small sample size (17 isolates from 11 different countries) and their analysis being based only on parasite
strains instead of field isolates. The regional prevalence of
S type-1 and S type-2 could have been due to local vector
and parasite adaptation. A recent study in Mexico by Joy
et al. [19] uncovered the importance of local parasite and
vector adaptation in genetic structuring of parasite populations. The effect of the mosquito’s differential transmission
potential, observed by Li et al., could have been the effect
of local parasite-mosquito adaptation rather than
speciation.
This is the first in-depth study dealing with P. vivax
genetic diversity on the Indian subcontinent using minisatellite marker, suggesting huge neutral genetic variation
in Indian field isolates. The high degree of genetic polymorphism observed in tandem repeats agrees with earlier
studies, which revealed tremendous genetic polymorphism among global P. vivax isolates [12,14,17,18,20,27].
