Methylation and cell death

Abstract
Background: Alteration in epigenetic methylation can affect gene expression and other
processes. In Prokaryota, DNA methyltransferase genes frequently move between genomes and
present a potential threat. A methyl-specific deoxyribonuclease, McrBC, of Escherichia coli cuts
invading methylated DNAs. Here we examined whether McrBC competes with genome
methylation systems through host killing by chromosome cleavage.
Results: McrBC inhibited the establishment of a plasmid carrying a PvuII methyltransferase gene
but lacking its recognition sites, likely through the lethal cleavage of chromosomes that became
methylated. Indeed, its phage-mediated transfer caused McrBC-dependent chromosome cleavage.
Its induction led to cell death accompanied by chromosome methylation, cleavage and degradation.
RecA/RecBCD functions affect chromosome processing and, together with the SOS response,
reduce lethality. Our evolutionary/genomic analyses of McrBC homologs revealed: a wide
distribution in Prokaryota; frequent distant horizontal transfer and linkage with mobility-related
genes; and diversification in the DNA binding domain. In these features, McrBCs resemble type II
restriction-modification systems, which behave as selfish mobile elements, maintaining their
frequency by host killing. McrBCs are frequently found linked with a methyltransferase homolog,
which suggests a functional association.
Conclusions: Our experiments indicate McrBC can respond to genome methylation systems by
host killing. Combined with our evolutionary/genomic analyses, they support our hypothesis that
McrBCs have evolved as mobile elements competing with specific genome methylation systems
through host killing. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of a defense system against
epigenetic systems through cell death.

Background

Recent studies have revealed that epigenetic genome methylation is associated with many aspects of life processes
through effects on gene expression and other steps [1-3].
Especially, epigenetic methylation is involved in silencing of
selfish genetic elements and other aspects of intragenomic
conflicts. Experimental alteration of epigenetic DNA methylation systems can cause a wide variety of changes [4-8]; for
example, in Prokaryota, DNA methyltransferase action can
change the transcriptome [7]. Horizontal gene transfer contributes considerably to the building up of prokaryotic
genomes [9,10]. In particular, the DNA methyltransferase
genes frequently move between genomes [11-15] and could,
therefore, present potential threats to prokaryotic genomes,
although they can also be beneficial to bacteria in many ways,
including in cell cycle regulation and cell differentiation [3,8].
Prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases often form a restrictionmodification (RM) system together with a restriction enzyme
[16,17]. Some RM systems behave as mobile elements, as suggested by their amplification, mobility, and involvement in
genome rearrangements, as well as their mutual competition
and regulation of gene expression [13-15,18-21]. Some type II
RM systems cleave chromosomes of their host cells when
their genes are eliminated by a competitor genetic element
[20,22,23], as illustrated in Figure 1a. Such host killing, called
'post-segregational killing' or 'genetic addiction', has been
recognized to be involved in stable maintenance in many

genome copies will survive in uninfected neighboring clonal cells. (b)
When a DNA methylation system enters a cell and begins to methylate
chromosomal recognition sites, McrBC senses the change and triggers cell
death by chromosomal cleavage. The intact genome copies will survive in
uninfected neighboring clonal cells.

plasmids [24]. The RM systems have evolved regulatory systems to suppress their potential to kill the host. When they
enter a new host, they prevent host cell killing by expressing
their methyltransferase first and delaying expression of their
restriction enzyme [19,25-27].
Host chromosome cleavage by RM systems is not trivial. In
general, cleavage of chromosomes by cellular DNases is prevented in various ways: inhibitor binding, compartmentalization, proteolysis, DNA modification and DNA structure
specificity. Indeed, host killing by RM systems after loss of
their genes is not always obvious because hosts have apparently adapted to counteract it in various ways. Recombination
repair of chromosomal breakage can reduce the lethal effects
of chromosome cleavage [28]. Host killing by an RM gene
complex is suppressed by a solitary methyltransferase recognizing the same sequence [29,30]. Proteolytic digestion of
restriction enzymes suppresses chromosome cleavage by
EcoKI, a type I RM system, even in the absence of the cognate
methyltransferase [31]. These host defense systems against
RM systems cannot, however, avoid host genome methylation and its potentially deleterious effects.
In the present work, we provide evidence for the existence of
a group of genetic elements that compete with epigenetic
DNA methylation systems (for example, with DNA methyltransferases from RM systems) through host cell killing.
These anti-methylation elements are methyl-specific endodeoxyribonuclease McrBC of Escherichia coli [32] and its
homologs. McrBC cleaves DNA between two separate RmC (R
= A or G, mC = m4C or m5C) sites in vitro [33], which are modified by many DNA methyltransferases from different RM
systems [16,17]. This activity was first recognized for restriction of incoming bacteriophage genomes carrying
hydroxymethylcytosine instead of cytosine [34,35]. McrBC
may also protect cells against infection by methylated DNA
elements, such as viral genomes and plasmids, through such
direct cleavage. However, such methylated DNAs are not usually strongly restricted by McrBC [36,37]; therefore, we
hypothesized that McrBC may mediate suicidal defense in
response to epigenetic genome methylation systems, such as
RM systems, as illustrated in Figure 1b. When such a system
enters the cell and begins to methylate the host genome,
McrBC would sense these epigenetic changes and trigger cell
death through chromosomal cleavage. Intact (unmethylated)
genomes with mcrBC genes would survive in the neighboring
clonal cells.
Defense against invasion of genetic elements through cell
death, as illustrated in Figure 1a,b, has been reported for multicellular eukaryotic cells, such as virus-infected mammalian
cells and plant cells [38]. Similar phenomena against virus
infection have been known for bacteria under the name of
'phage exclusion' or 'phage abortion' [39]. Bacteriophage
reproduction is aborted by the action of a cell death gene. As
a result, this gene would survive within the clonal cells that

would, otherwise, all die by secondary infection. For example,
the prr gene in some Escherichia coli strains senses bacteriophage T4 infection and triggers cell death by cleaving host
tRNALys [40].
We first asked whether McrBC-mediated cell death through
cleavage of methylated chromosomes takes place upon entry/
induction of a methyltransferase gene and aborts its establishment/activation. After obtaining positive experimental
results, we asked how important this role has been in the
spread and maintenance of McrBC genes. Our analyses of
their molecular evolution and genomic contexts support the
hypothesis that, during evolution, they have behaved as
mobile elements. Taken together, these results support our
hypothesis that McrBCs have evolved as mobile elements that
compete with specific genome methylation systems through
host killing.

Results

In the first half of the Results section, we address the first
question of whether McrBC-mediated cell death through
cleavage of methylated chromosomes takes place upon entry/
induction of an epigenetic methyltransferase gene and causes
this gene's establishment/activation to be aborted.

McrBC-mediated inhibition of establishment of a DNA
methyltransferase gene
We first asked about the biological consequences of McrBC,
that is, whether or not establishment of a transferred methyltransferase gene is aborted through the action of McrBC. As
the methyltransferase, we chose PvuII methyltransferase
(M.PvuII) of the PvuII RM system. It recognizes CAGCTG and
generates CAGm4CTG [37,41], a target sequence of McrBC
[33].
Several reports have indicated that phages or plasmids carrying a DNA methyltransferase gene could not be propagated in
an mcrBC+ strain of E. coli [42]. Whether the block to propagation is due to repeated methylation of the introduced DNA
and subsequent cleavage [42] or due to host genome methylation and cleavage, as we have hypothesized in this work, has
not been addressed.
We introduced a plasmid carrying the PvuII methyltransferase (M. PvuII, CAGm4CTG) gene but lacking PvuII recognition sites (pEF43 in Table 1) in a quantitative transformation
assay (Figure 2a). The transformation efficiency decreased by
four orders of magnitude in an mcrBC-dependent manner
(Figure 2b). The decrease did not occur in the case of genes
for three other cytosine methyltransferases, M.EcoRII
(Cm5CWGG), M.SsoII (Cm5CNGG), and M.BamHI
(GGATm4CC), consistent with the sequence specificity of
McrBC [33]. We found that a plasmid carrying a PvuII methyltransferase gene and two PvuII recognition sites was also
inhibited in its establishment by the same order of magnitude

(date not shown). Our results indicate that methylated sites
on the transferred DNA were not required for the McrBCdependent inhibition of its establishment and propagation.
These results demonstrate that McrBC can abort establishment of the transferred element with the methyltransferase
gene and, furthermore, suggest that this is through McrBCmediated cleavage of methylated chromosomal DNA, as
opposed to that on the transferred DNA.
The PvuII RM gene complex was found on pPvu1, a low-copy
plasmid from Proteus vulgaris [37] that can also replicate in
E. coli [43]. Proteus vulgaris and E. coli both belong to the
Enterobacteriaceae family and also share an ecological niche,
the intestine of humans and related animals. Therefore, these
experiments are intended to reproduce events that are likely
to take place in the natural environment, although they
involved the use of multicopy (ColE1-derived) plasmids.
Transformation of a pPvu1 derivative plasmid carrying
M.PvuII and a drug-resistance gene as a selective marker and
lacking PvuII sites (pEF65 in Table 1) was blocked by McrBC
as strongly as the above multi-copy plasmid (Figure 2b). This
suggests that the strong inhibition is biologically relevant.

McrBC-mediated chromosome cleavage after phagemediated transfer of the DNA methyltransferase gene
The above inhibition of establishment of the methyltransferase gene is likely caused by lethal cleavage of chromosomes
that become methylated. Next, we asked whether McrBC
indeed cleaves host chromosomes in order to abort the propagation of a transfered epigenetic genome methylation gene.
In order to examine this issue, we introduced the M.PvuII
gene into E. coli by a λ phage vector.
We first prepared the λ phage strain LIK891 with 15 PvuII
sites (Materials and methods) in a host carrying PvuII methyltransferase (Materials and methods). Its modification status was confirmed by its resistance to PvuII restriction both in
vitro and in vivo as follows. When the phage genome DNA
prepared from the purified λ preparation was reacted with
PvuII, no change was observed in its gel electrophoresis pattern under a condition where unmodified phage genome DNA
was completely cleaved. The PvuII-modified phage preparation did not show detectable decreases in plaque formation
efficiency in a host carrying the PvuII RM system. In an E. coli
mcrBC+ strain, the PvuII-modified λ phage preparation
showed only a 10-fold decrease in plaque formation efficiency
(Figure 3a). Consistent with previous reports [36,37], this
observation indicates that McrBC cannot efficiently restrict a
methylated phage genome.
However, λ phage strain LEF1, which carries the PvuII methyltransferase gene, was restricted 10,000-fold (Figure 3a).
This result agrees with earlier reports indicating that phages
carrying a DNA methyltransferase gene could not be propagated in an mcrBC+ strain of E. coli [43]. As we noted in the
previous section, whether the block to propagation is due to

repeated methylation of the introduced DNA and subsequent
McrBC-mediated cleavage [43] or due to host genome methylation and its McrBC-mediated lethal cleavage has not been
addressed.
When we examined chromosomes of the infected cells by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we observed accumulation of
huge linear DNA corresponding to broken chromosomes
(indicated in Figure 3b in the lanes at 30 and 45 minutes after
infection) and of smaller DNAs of variable size (smear in Figure 3b in the lane at 45 minutes after infection), which likely
reflect chromosome degradation. Their appearance was
mcrBC+-dependent (mcrB1 lanes in Figure 3b). This observation strongly suggests that M.PvuII-mediated chromosome
methylation triggered chromosome cleavage by McrBC,
which was followed by chromosome degradation. This, in

turn, indicates that the inhibition of their multiplication (Figure 3a) is caused by host death.
Parenthetically, we noticed a band deriving from both the
mcrB- and mcrBC+ strains in the middle of the same gel and
another species at the lowest position from the mcrBC+ cells
(data not shown). From their mobility, we inferred that these
bands represent the excised circular form and the cleaved linear form of e14, a defective lambdoid phage [44,45]. Because
e14 has one PvuII site, its linear form is expected to appear
after McrBC-mediated cleavage [46]. Because the lambdoid
phages have similar gene organization [47-49] and regulation
[50], it would not be very surprising if gene expression from
the incoming λ somehow led to the expression of the excision
function of e14.

transform E. coli DH5α by electroporation. Experiments were conducted
in triplicate. (b) Transformation of plasmids carrying the PvuII
methyltransferase gene. Plasmids (100 ng) carrying one of several
modification methyltransferase genes were used to transform E. coli
ER1562 (mcrB1) and ER1563 (mcrBC+). The relative transformation
efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the transformation efficiency of the
test plasmid to that of the empty vector. M.PvuII (ColE1) indicates pEF43,
while M.PvuII (pPvu1) indicates pEF65 (Table 1). The empty vector for the
latter is pEF67, while that for the former is pEF33. The vector for the
remaining plasmids is pBR322. The measurements from two separate
experiments conducted in duplicate are shown. All (20/20) of the rare
transformants of mcrBC+ by pEF43 examined were found to have lost
McrBC activity.

McrBC-mediated cell death and chromosome
degradation following induction of the DNA
methyltransferase
The above two sets of experiments strongly suggested that
McrBC mediates inhibition of propagation of the PvuII DNA
methyltransferase gene through lethal cleavage of methylated
chromosomes. We next asked whether induction of the PvuII

methyltransferase leads to chromosome methylation followed by its McrBC-mediated cleavage and cell death. Furthermore, we asked whether we could find a close correlation
between these three processes: methylation, cleavage and
death.
First, we cloned the pvuIIM gene downstream of the arabinose-inducible BAD promoter [51]. We prepared host strains
for this experiment based on the work of Khlebnikov et al.
[52]. These authors succeeded in achieving homogeneous
expression from the BAD promoter and obtained a linear
increase in the expression level in response to arabinose concentration by deleting araBAD and araFGH operons and
substituting the araE promoter with a constitutive promoter
[52]. We introduced these mutations to construct isogenic
mcrBC+/- strains (BIK18260 and BIK18261 in Table 2). At
three concentrations of arabinose (0%, 0.0002%, and
0.002%) we were able to demonstrate correlation between
genome methylation, genome breakage and cell death (Figure
4) as detailed below.
Progress in genome methylation was measured, in the
mcrBC-negative strain, by resistance to PvuII cleavage in

vitro (Figure 4a). The cleaved band pattern shows that the
rate of progress of chromosomal DNA methylation after
induction correlates with the concentration of arabinose (Figure 4a). The lower (0.0002%) concentration resulted in a
delay in methylation of approximately 30 minutes compared
to the higher (0.002%) concentration.
We also followed methylation of a single PvuII site on a multicopy plasmid (pEF60 in Table 1) included in the cell. Plasmids were extracted from cells (BIK18260) harbouring
pEF60 and pEF24 (inducible M.PvuII gene) and digested in
vitro with PvuII and HindIII, which cuts pEF60 at a single
site. Quantification of the bands showed that the PvuII site
was completely methylated 30 minutes and 60 minutes after
induction with 0.002% and 0.0002% arabinose, respectively
(data not shown). The time to achieve 50% methylation was
about 13 minutes for the higher concentration and about 38
minutes for the lower concentration. They differed by 25 minutes. Thus, the methylation observed with the plasmid agreed
well with that observed with the chromosome.
We also observed a low level of PvuII methylation of pEF60
under the repression conditions: 4.1% and 4.3% in one experiment and 5.3% and 6.0% in another; 5% corresponds to 89
sites out of 1,778 PvuII sites in the chromosome of MG1655.
This indicates that PvuII methyltransferase is expressed at a
low level due to slight leakage from the BAD promoter. This is

consistent with earlier reports on this promoter [51,53] and
the difficulty in maintaining restriction enzyme genes under
this promoter in the repressed state in E. coli [54] (M Watanabe, F Khan, Y Furuta and I Kobayashi, unpublished observation).
The induction of PvuII methyltransferase indeed caused
immediate chromosome breakage as detected by pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis in the mcrBC+ strain (Figure 4b) but not in
the mcrBC- strain (data not shown). With the higher arabinose concentration, huge linear DNA molecules (at the middle point between the well and the 485 kb marker) became
prominent by 15 minutes after the induction, and then they
appeared to gradually shift into smaller fragments. With the
lower arabinose concentration, the huge linear DNA molecules appeared 30 minutes after the induction and decayed in
the same way. The chromosome breakage observed thus correlated well with the progress of methylation in the mcrBCstrain. Quantification of the DNAs in the well, which likely
represent relatively intact chromosomes, revealed that they
decreased over time after induction (Figure 4c). These
decreases at the different arabinose concentrations correlated
well with the progress of methylation in the mcrBC- strain.
The chromosome breakage was accompanied by a decrease in
viable cell counts (colony forming units; Figure 4d). The
progress of death was again related to the arabinose concen-

Expression of PvuII methyltransferase causes chromosome methylation and mcrBC-dependent chromosome breakage and cell death
Figure 4
Expression of PvuII methyltransferase causes chromosome methylation and mcrBC-dependent chromosome breakage and cell death. (a) Confirmation of
chromosome methylation. BIK18260 (mcrB1) cells carrying pEF24 (pvuIIM under the pBAD promoter; see Table 1), were grown in LB broth under
antibiotic selection to the mid-exponential phase, diluted to OD600 = 0.1, and further grown in the presence of 0.002% or 0.002% arabinose (ara) to
induce expression of M.PvuII. At the indicated time intervals (in minutes), chromosomal DNA was prepared, digested with PvuII endonuclease (TaKaRa
Bio), and subjected to pulsed-field agarose gel electrophoresis. M, λ DNA ladder. (b) Chromosome DNA in BIK18261 (mcrBC+) carrying pEF24 after

number of viable cells was monitored in duplicate in two independent experiments. Each value was divided by the value at time zero. (e) Cell shape. The

tration. The stronger induction led to cell death within 15
minutes, while the weaker induction allowed maintenance of
viability for 30 minutes. Many cells appeared as filaments
with multiple nuclei or no nucleus (Figure 4e). Inhibition of
cell growth as measured in OD was also observed in the
mcrBC+ cells 1-2 h after induction (Figure 5a, lower left), but
not in the repressed state (Figure 5a, upper left).
These results demonstrate a correlation between genome
methylation, chromosome breakage, and cell death upon
induction of PvuII methyltransferase. They strongly suggest
that chromosomal sites methylated by PvuII methyltransferase are cleaved by McrBC and that this cleavage leads to
cell death.

death, mutations in enzymes involved in DNA-related processes might affect these processes. We examined cell growth
and chromosome changes in several mutants altered in DNA
metabolism in a variety of ways.
RecBCD enzyme is involved in exonucleolytic degradation of
DNA from a double-stranded break and generates a recombinogenic single-stranded DNA end [55]. When bound to this
single-stranded DNA generated by RecBCD or other
enzymes, RecA protein initiates homologous pairing for
recombination repair. RecA bound to single-stranded DNA
also induces SOS genes through cleavage of their LexA
repressor [56]. If RecA and RecBCD are involved in processing and repair of the McrBC-mediated chromosome breakage, their removal might affect cell survival and chromosome
processing.

If the chromosomal sites methylated by PvuII methyltransferase are cleaved by McrBC and this cleavage leads to cell

M2, λ DNA cut with HindIII.

Mutational removal of the host RecBCD/RecA exonuclease/
recombinase machinery affected growth not only in the
induced state but also in the repressed state (Figure 5a). A
likely explanation for the uninduced state is chromosome
methylation by slight expression of PvuII methyltansferase
(see above). We analyzed chromosomes by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis in strain pairs with and without the PBADpvuIIM plasmid in the mcrBC+ background. Our results
shown in Figure 5b clearly indicate plasmid-dependent degradation (smear) in the recBC mutant and plasmid-dependent increase of huge linear DNAs (the thick band in the
midpoint between the well and the 485 kb marker) in the recA
mutant. These results strongly suggest that partial chromosome methylation led to McrBC-mediated chromosome
breakage and that RecBCD/RecA machinery repairs this
breakage. The defects in the repair of the McrBC-mediated
chromosome breakage are likely the cause of the delayed
growth of the recA and recBC mutants (Figure 5a).
When the methyltransferase is induced, the RecBC/RecA
mediated break repair presumably delays growth arrest (Figure 5a). The recA or recBC mutations slightly affected the loss
of cell viability 30 minutes after the induction of methyltransferase (Table 3). However, the final viability level on exposure
of the genome to methylation was similar to that in the rec+
strain (data not shown).
The chromosomes in these mutants showed changes consistent with the above growth patterns and their known properties (Figure 5c). The recBC mutant showed a large amount of
huge broken chromosomes in the uninduced state; these
remained abundant as long as 60 minutes after induction. In
the lower area, which corresponds to smaller broken chromosomes, many discrete bands are visible in the recBC mutant.
This is consistent with the process in which the chromosomes
broken by McrBC endonuclease were further degraded by
RecBCD exonuclease. The recA mutant, unlike the rec+ strain,
showed more of the huge broken chromosomes even in the
uninduced state. In the rec+ strain, this species became prominent only 15 minutes after induction and disappeared. In the
recA mutant, it remained abundant for 30 minutes but
started decreasing by 45 minutes after induction. The amount
of smaller broken chromosomes in the recA strain was less
than that in the rec+ strain, presumably due to degradation by

RecBCD enzyme. No discrete bands are visible in the recA
mutant, which is consistent with rapid and extensive DNA
degradation by RecBCD enzyme. Discrete bands are seen in
the rec+ strain but they are not so many as in the recBC
mutant.
These electrophoresis patterns are consistent with the steps
of McrBC-mediated chromosomal breakage, RecBCD-mediated exonucleolytic degradation from the break, and RecAmediated homologous pairing for repair. The RecBCD/RecAmediated repair was also found for post-segregational killing
by a type II RM system [28]. From the results presented in
Figure 5 and Table 3, we inferred that the RecBCD/RecAmediated recombination repair can counteract McrBC's
lethal action to some extent at a low methylation level. However, chromosome repair by them appears unable to contribute to cell survival when the genome methylation and the
McrBC-mediated cleavage become extensive. This is similar
to the chromosome cleavage by a mutant EcoRI enzyme
[57,58].

The RecA/RecBCD function is also involved in the SOS
response as mentioned. The cell filamentation was not
observed in a recA deletion strain (data not shown). This indicates that the cell filamentation we observed represents an
SOS response. In order to assess the effects of the SOS
response on McrBC-mediated growth inhibition and cell
death, we examined SOS-related mutants (Figure 6 and Table
3). Among these, the lexA(Ind-) mutant is defective in SOS
induction, the lexA(Def) mutant is constitutive for SOS induction, and the mutS mutant shows less background DNA
breaks under some genetic backgrounds [59].
These mutants showed McrBC-dependent growth inhibition
when M.PvuII was induced, but not in the repressed state
(Figure 6). McrBC-mediated inhibition observed in the
lexA(Ind-) mutant was stronger than that in the rec+ strain
but not so strong as in the recA strain (Figure 5a). A simple
interpretation of this result is that the defect in repair in the
recA-negative mutant cannot be entirely attributed to the
absence of the SOS response. In other words, RecA is likely to
play a direct role, presumably, in recombination repair. The
lexA(Ind-) strain also showed severe loss of cell viability 30
minutes after induction (Table 3). The results with lexA(Def)
are difficult to interpret because the lexA(Def) mcrB1 strain
showed slow growth. It is known that lexA(Def) mutation

delays growth even in the sulA-negative background [60].
This effect could be exaggerated with McrBC-mediated chromosome breakage upon genome methylation. The mutS
mutant was indistinguishable from the rec+ (mutS+) strain in
these measurements. From these results, we inferred that the
SOS response and RecA/RecBCD-mediated DNA recombination/repair both affect cell death/survival upon McrBC action
on the methylated genome. The repair systems, however, cannot block cell death upon extensive chromosome methylation
and cleavage. These observations are consistent with our
hypothesis that chromosome methylation leads to its McrBCmediated lethal cleavage.

Generality and specificity of McrBC action against
DNA methyltransferases
In order to investigate the generality and specificity of
McrBC-mediated cell death with regard to DNA methyltransferase specificity, we expressed McrBC in a cell carrying one
of several methyltransferases with different specificities.
First, mcrBC of E. coli was placed under the PBAD promoter
(pEF46 in Table 1). As expected, McrBC induction in a cell
harboring another plasmid encoding M.PvuII (CAGm4CTG)
led to cell death in the colony formation assay (Figure 7).
McrBC induction also led to cell death with M.SinI
(GGWm5CC) and M.MspI (m5CCGG) (Figure 7) but not with
M.SsoII (Cm5CNGG) (data not shown). These results are consistent with the RmC sequence specificity of McrBC observed
in vitro [33]. Our interpretation is that McrBC has the potential to act as a defense system against many DNA methyltransferases of an appropriate specificity.

cleaves host chromosomes and causes cell death upon
genome methylation and that this cell death inhibits propagation of the methyltransferase gene (Figure 1b). McrBC was
also demonstrated to severely restrict bacteriophages carrying hydroxymethylated C in place of C in their genomes
[34,35,61,62]. Which of these actions of McrBC has been providing selective advantage for their spread and maintenance
during evolution?
In order to address this question, we focused on the similarity
of McrBC with type II RM systems in the action of host killing
by chromosome cleavage. As illustrated in Figure 1a, when a
type II RM gene complex is replaced by a competitor genetic
element, its product restriction enzyme will cleave host chromosomes in which methylation decreases and kill the host
(Figure 1a) [22]. This leads to survival of cells retaining the
RM gene complex but not its competitor. The McrBC system
may likewise contribute to exclusion of epigenetic methylation systems (Figure 1b). A contrast between them is that
McrBC action follows gain of methylation, as opposed to loss
of methylation.
The potential for host killing by type II RM systems indicates
their relative independence from the host. They act as a unit
of selection and, in this regard, they might be similar to viral
genomes, transposons and other selfish mobile elements.
Indeed, there are now many lines of evidence for the mobility
of type II RM systems [21]. These include molecular evolutionary evidence for their extensive horizontal transfer
between distantly related prokaryotes, carriage by mobile elements such as plasmids and linkage with mobility-related
genes. Likely due to this mobility, in addition to the ability to
cut incoming DNAs and to fight against competing elements
by host killing, type II RM systems are widespread throughout Prokaryota. They are often lost from a genome by various
mutations [21]. They are quite diversified in sequence recognition because of frequency-dependent selection in defense
against incoming DNAs [63] and/or because of mutual competition for recognition sequence in host killing [18]. We
asked whether McrBC homologs show similar properties. If
they do so, we might take it as evidence supporting the
hypothesis that McrBCs have evolved for their ability to kill
the host cell in competition with genome methylation systems
and behave as selfish mobile elements.
In order to address these points and evaluate the above two
hypotheses for McrBC, we examined its evolutionary history.
Using the sequence of McrB and McrC from E. coli as queries
for PSI-BLAST [64] searches, we identified 199 homologous
McrBC-like systems, typically comprising operons with an
mcrB-like gene followed by a mcrC-like gene (see also below).
These homologs of the McrBC system are widely distributed
in Bacteria and Archaea (Table S1 in Additional data file 1),

defense hypothesis might be favored. We address these issues
in the Discussion.
Phylogenetic trees calculated from multiple sequence alignments of McrB and McrC sequences (Materials and methods)
reveal very similar topologies, suggesting strong co-evolution
of these two proteins (Figure S1 in Additional data file 2).
Nine bootstrap-supported branches reveal relationships
between sequences from different taxons, indicating a very
high probability of distant horizontal gene transfer events,
which is also a feature of evolution of type II RM systems
[15,65]. In the aforementioned cases, McrB and McrC appear
to have experienced joint horizontal transfer.
The mcrBC gene complex in E. coli K12 was suggested to have
been acquired recently [61], which is confirmed by our phylogenetic analysis: McrB and McrC from E. coli K12 are not
found in a branch specific to Proteobacteria (top part of the
tree in Figure S1 in Additional data file 2), but in a branch that
also includes Acidobacteria bacterium Blin 345 (the closest
homolog of E. coli McrBC), Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria.
In general, McrBC subunits from taxons such as Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, or Firmicutes form numerous intermixed
branches in the tree, suggesting multiple horizontal gene
transfers followed by vertical dissemination among diverging
species and strains. One example of a branch of functionally
similar enzymes from completely different taxons is provided
by the family of unusual type II RM systems related to McrBC
(including LlaI [66], BsuMI [67], LlaJI [68] and their experimentally uncharacterized homologs) that cleave unmethylated DNA and are accompanied by a pair of type IIS DNA
methyltransferases to protect against the cleavage of their
self-DNA (labelled type II R-like subfamily in Figure S1 in
Additional data file 2).
Another feature revealed by the phylogenetic trees is the presence of two strongly diverged subfamilies of McrBC-like systems, one comprising known McrBC (for example, the one
from E. coli K12) and McrB-like systems (for example, the
aforementioned type II enzymes), and the other comprising
solely uncharacterized McrBC-like homologs of unknown
function, with the McrC-like component defined as uncharacterized protein family DUF524. It is interesting that members
of these two subfamilies show nearly perfectly complementary phylogentic distribution, that is, despite their presence in
similar taxons, they do not co-occur in one genome (Table S2
in Additional data file 3 and Table S1 in Additional data file 1),
which probably reflects some degree of their mutual incompatibility.
The few events of distant horizontal transfer indicated on the
phylogenetic trees correspond only to those cases where an
McrB (and/or McrC) homolog from one taxon is found to be
embedded in a branch comprising a different taxon (for
example, Deinococcus within Gammaproteobacteria) and
where this branch has bootstrap support >50%. This is a very

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R163

conservative estimation of horizontal gene transfer events.
The trees reveal many other cases of branches with mixed taxons, but their bootstrap support is <50%, indicating lack of
statistical support for the local tree topology. When we compared the McrB and McrC trees with the 16S rRNA trees calculated for the same set of species (Figure S2 in Additional
data file 4), we found numerous disagreements in deep
branches, and agreement only in short branches that connect
closely related species. This analysis suggests that McrBC systems have been transmitted horizontally numerous times, but
of course they have been also inherited vertically by closely
related groups of organisms radiating from their common
ancestor (for example, by strains of the same species, such as
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, or Yersinia pestis). However, it is very difficult to quantify the rate of
distant horizontal transfer by analyzing a tree with a highly
variable bootstrap support for different nodes; therefore, we
resorted to an independent strategy.
Gojobori and coworkers [69] have published analysis of 116
completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes, in which they
calculated an index of potential distant horizontal transfer for
all genes, by comparing the frequency of 'words' of pentanucleotide length within each gene with the average word frequency of the entire genome. We have obtained an updated
data set for 165 genomes from Dr Nakamura and Dr Gojobori
(personal communication). Among these genomes, 29 contain both McrB and McrC homologs (D. radiodurans contains one additional McrB homolog). We have analyzed the
horizontal transfer index of all genes encoding McrB and
McrC homologs and found that 9 McrB-homologous genes
(9/30 = 30%) and 10 McrC-homologous genes (10/29 = 35%)
exhibit word frequencies that indicate significant likelihood
of distant horizontal gene transfer. Thus, in the sample of
McrBC systems, for which data are available, approximately
one-third appears to have been derived by a recent horizontal
gene transfer event from a distantly related group. For the
same set of genomes, we also carried out analysis of the horizontal transfer index of genes from two reference 'housekeeping' protein families: RecA and RpoB. We found no
members of RecA or RpoB genes in this sample to be predicted as recently transferred.
We found that the McrBC gene complex tends to be lost quite
frequently, as no higher-order taxon is found in which all
completely sequenced genomes possess this system. Among
567 completely sequenced genomes in which we looked for
McrB/C homologs, we found McrB in only 112 cases (19.8%)
and McrC in 108 cases (19.0%); McrB and McrC were found
together in 107 cases (18.9%). Thus, we conclude that McrBC
systems are frequently transmitted by horizontal gene transfer (in addition to regular vertical transfer), but are also very
frequently lost. This argues against the hypothesis that they
are conserved due only to their utility for defense against
phages or other parasites and favors the hypothesis they
behave as selfish (host-killing) mobile elements.

Genomic neighborhood analysis of McrBC systems
suggests their mobility and linkage with genome
methylation systems
Type II RM gene complexes are often found on mobile elements such as plasmids, phages, integrons and genomic
islands [21]. In accord, they are often linked with mobilityrelated genes such as transposase homologs and integrase
homologs. We examined the neighbourhoods of mcrBC
homologs expecting to find similar genes.
Genomic neighbourhood analysis (Table S2 in Additional
data file 3; see Table S1 in Additional data file 1 for the complete data set) revealed that McrB and McrC are tightly linked
to each other, suggesting their structure as a single operon.
They are frequently associated with homologs of integrases
and transposases (Table S2 in Additional data file 3 and Table
S1 in Additional data file 1). Several McrBC homologs clearly
occur as an insert in an RM gene complex (Figure 8). In addition, eight McrBC-like systems were found on a plasmid
(Table S1 in Additional data file 1). These three lines of evidence indicate potential mobility of the mcrBC unit. The
mcrBC homologs were often linked with RM systems or just
DNA methyltransferases (Table S2 in Additional data file 3),
as first noted for E. coli [70]. The implication of this finding is
discussed below.
Some genomes, such as the Deinococcus radiodurans R1
genome, contain two mcrBC homologs, sometimes one on a
plasmid and the other in the chromosome. Alignment of these
pairs of McrB homologs found in the same genome revealed
that their amino acid sequences often vary in the amino-terminal region, which is involved in DNA binding [46], suggesting evolutionary shifts in DNA sequence specificity (Figure
9). This parallels the diversity in sequence recognition of type
II restriction and modification enzymes.
To investigate the relationship between the diversity of the
McrB amino-terminal region and sequence recognition, several McrBC homologs, STOMcrBC (NP_377078.1) and
STOMcrBC2 (NP_377080.1) from Sulforobus tokodaii str. 7,
TKOMcrBC (YP_183208.1) and TKOMcrBC2 (YP_183422.1)
from Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1, and DraMcrBC
(NP_051672.1) from D. radiodurans R1, were amplified from
genome DNA and cloned into pBAD30 [51]. These mcrBC
homologs did not cause cell death in E. coli at 37°C in the
presence of arabinose in a cell harboring either of the four
DNA methyltransferase genes, M.PvuII (CAGm4CTG), M.SinI
(GGWm5CC), M.MspI (m5CCGG), or M.SsoII (Cm5CWGG)
(data not shown). EcoKMcrBC from E. coli caused cell death
sensing genome methylation by M.SinI (GGWm5CC) and
M.MspI (m5CCGG) under the same condition (Figure 7).
Therefore, we were unable to link these homologs with the
biology of the organisms.

Discussion

McrBC of E. coli can cleave incoming bacteriophage DNAs
with methylated bases such as hydroxymethylcytosine
[34,35]. This has been thought to be the selective force that
allowed their spread and maintenance. In the present work,
we propose and examine an alternative (but not necessarily
exclusive) hypothesis: when an epigenetic genome methylation system enters a host, McrBC aborts its establishment by
cleaving the methylated host genome. We hypothesize that
such conflicts with genome methylation systems leading to
the sacrificing of a host cell has been the force that allowed
their evolution.

with the occurrence of McrBC-mediated lethal chromosome
cleavage (Figures 5 and 6). These results strongly argue that
the McrBC system can prevent establishment of an epigenetic
methylation system by cleaving methylated chromosomes to
cause death of the host cell (Figure 1b). The methyltransferase
used in our experiments is that of PvuII RM, which was found
in a plasmid from a bacterium closely related to E. coli and
dwelling in the same environment, thus, under conditions
that enable horizontal gene transfer. A derivative of this plasmid was demonstrated to be excluded by McrBC (Figure 2b).
These results suggest that these experiments are biologically
relevant.

In order to examine this hypothesis, we first asked whether
such host death through chromosome cleavage in order to
exclude DNA methyltransferase genes could take place at all.
This is not a trivial question because the genome is protected
from cellular DNases by a variety of means (see Background).
Our experiments revealed: McrBC-mediated inhibition of
establishment of an epigenetic methylation gene (on a plasmid lacking its methylation site; Figure 2); McrBC-mediated
chromosome cleavage and degradation following entry of the
DNA methyltransferase gene (on a phage genome; Figure 3);
a close correlation between genome methylation by the methyltransferase and McrBC-mediated chromosome cleavage,
degradation and cell death (Figure 4); and that the effects of
mutations in DNA repair-related genes were also consistent

Another question is how important has such a capacity of host
killing been in evolution. Such a capacity implies that McrBC
is in potential conflict with the host genome just as in the case
of type II RM systems (Figure 1a). Several type II RM systems
kill the host cell when their genes are replaced by a competing
element, such as an incompatible plasmid and an allelic gene
[20,22,23]. One feature related to such independence from
the host genome is the mobility of these RM systems [14]. Just
as for type II RM systems, McrBC family members have been
shown to be potentially mobile. They have frequently experienced horizontal transfer between distantly related groups,
are often linked with mobility-related genes and are widely
distributed in Prokaryota. Some of them were found on a
plasmid. Their frequent decay is also similar to the decay of

not know whether there has been an extensive search for
phages with unusual bases, mC and others [77], and because
we do not know the specificity of most of the McrBC homologs
(see below).
Another type IV nuclease, GmrSD, found in an E. coli strain
targets glucosylated hydroxymethyl-C and may have evolved
to cut T4 genome [78]. The resistance of hydroxylmethy-Ccontaining phage to restriction enzymes but its sensitivity to
McrBC [79] and the resistance of glucosylated hydroxymethyl-C to GmrSD but its inhibition by T4-coded internal protein [78] suggest an evolutionary arms race (evolutionary
struggle between competing sets of co-evolving genes that
develop adaptations and counter-adaptations against each
other) between the bacteria and the phage.
The present lines of analyses, combined with examination of
the relationships of McrBC homologs with bacteriophages
with modified bases in ecological and evolutionary contexts,
will help in evaluating these two hypotheses. These two roles
may not be necessarily mutually exclusive.

type II RM systems [71,72]. These evolutionary and genomic
analyses are contrary to the hypothesis that they have been
maintained solely as a faithful tool of defense, directly cleaving incoming DNAs, and favor our hypothesis that they have
evolved as mobile elements that compete with genome methylation systems through host killing.

McrBC family members appear to be quite divergent in
sequence (Figure S1 in Additional data file 2). Such diversity
might be accompanied by diversity in their target recognition.
Indeed, members of one McrBC subfamily have been shown
to be type II like in that they cleave a specific sequence when
unmethylated [66] (Figure S1 in Additional data file 2). The
presence of two mcrB paralogs diverged in the amino terminus in one genome (Figure 9) is consistent with their divergence in sequence recognition, although our experiments
could not demonstrate this. Such divergence in target recognition could also be a basis for the apparent incompatibility of
the two subgroups, McrBC-like and the DUF524 subfamily.
We imagine that the family of McrBC-like systems may have
evolved a variety of substrate specificities to respond to a variety of DNA methylation systems.

How strong is the evidence for the alternative hypothesis of
defense against phages with unusual bases, such as T-even
phages, by direct cleavage? Phages related to T4 in morphology have been isolated from enterobacterial species closely
related to E. coli (Klebsiella, Shigella, and Yersinia) and, less
frequently, from Citrobacter, Proteus, Salmonella, and Serratia. Others propagate on more distantly related bacteria
(Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Burkholderia, and Vibrios)
[73]. The genomes of the pseudo T-even phage, a subgroup of
T4-like phages only distantly related to T4 that includes coliphages and Aeromonas phage, can be digested by restriction
enzymes [74]. This suggests that only limited nucleotide
modifications must be present in their genomes.

Unexpectedly, we found that mcrBC homologs are frequently
linked with DNA methyltransferase homologs. Many of them
are from a type I RM system, while some of them are from a
type IIG system (Table 3; Figure 8; Table S1 in Additional
data file 1). The linked methyltransferases are expected to
have a specificity that does not create a target of the McrBC
nuclease. This implies that the McrBC will compete with
other methyltransferases of a specificity different from its
neighbor (linked) methyltransferase. The base specificity of
type I modification enzymes, that is, m6A methylation [80], as
opposed to m4C and m5C of McrBC, is consistent with this idea.

Reports of phage genomes with 5mC in place of C are rare: one
for Xanthomonas [75] and the other for Halobacterium, an
Archaeon [76]. This distribution is in apparent contrast to the
wide distribution of McrBC homologs in Prokaryota and
could be taken as evidence against the phage defense hypothesis. This evidence is, however, not very strong because we do

Thus, McrBC may be regarded to serve as a player in the competition between different epigenetic genome methylation
systems. The insertion of mcrBC into a preexisting type I gene
complex, as inferred from Figure 8, is explained as acquisition of a helper by the type I system. Such competition processes may have driven diversification of methyltransferases'

sequence recognition just as competition between type II RM
systems have likely driven diversification of their sequence
recognition [18]. Their linkage may also have led to evolution
of McrBC-like type II RM systems.
Epigenetic methylation often plays a role in intragenomic
conflicts of genetic elements, such as silencing of selfish elements [1]. The present results and the above argument suggest the possibility that epigenetic systems themselves are
potentially in a mutual conflict.
A gene programming death of its host has advantages under
several conditions. Defense against microbial infection
through cell death has been known for animals, plants and
prokaryotes [38]. A prokaryotic example of phage exclusion
or phage abortion has been known for half a century [39].
Successful infection of a bacterial cell by a phage will lead to
production of progeny virus particles, which would then
infect the neighboring, likely clonal cells. Then, all the clonal
cells and the genes within them might disappear through secondary infection. However, when the first infected cell carries
a gene that programs death of the infected cell together with
the viral genome, there is no progeny virus production for the
secondary infection. The neighboring sibling cells and their
genomes would survive. Among these genomes is the gene
that programmed the death.
Several type II RM systems trigger cell death when their genes
are eliminated by a competitor genetic element [20,22,23]
(Figure 1a). There is experimental evidence that one resident
type II RM system aborts establishment of another, incoming
type II RM system by forcing it to cleave the host genome [19].
Epigenetic genome methylation is involved in transposon
silencing [6,81]. There are examples of involvement of other
types of epigenetic systems in intragenomic conflicts [1]. The
McrBC case is unique in that it directly relates an epigenetic
modification to cell death through genome cleavage. To our
knowledge, this represents the first report of a defense system
against epigenetic systems through cell death.
Mrr, another methyl-specific deoxyribonuclease, induces cell
death under high-pressure stress, likely through chromosome
breakage [82]. The Mrr gene forms a cassette together with
mcrBC and the EcoKI type I RM gene complex.
In this article, we treated genes (rather than cells, individual
organisms or genomes) as the unit of selection, adopting various strategies to increase their frequency [83]. A gene would
increase its frequency if its effects help to do so. This is the
basic view in genetics and evolutionary studies, although it
might sound anthropomorphic. We use the term 'selfish' as
(and only as) 'being a unit of evolutionary selection'. For the
situations shown in Figure 1a,b and in programmed death
upon infection (see above), expressions such as 'the altruistic

Volume 9, Issue 11, Article R163

Fukuda et al. R163.16

cell death is indeed programmed by a selfish gene' are concise
and to the point.
The above genes programming death of their host bacterial
cell are expected to increase in frequency because of the
advantage. However, this argument needs mathematical justification in the domain of evolutionary game theory. The ultimate players of these games must be the genes. For the type
of host killing genes illustrated in Figure 1a (addiction or
post-segregational killing genes, including type II RM systems), an earlier attempt was unable to demonstrate their
spread [84]. This analysis used a model lacking spacial structure, such as a well-mixed liquid culture, where every cell can
potentially interact with every other cell. We demonstrated
that these genes can increase in frequency if spacial structure
is present (that is, if the habitat is structured) so that a cell
preferentially interacts with its neighbors [85]. Their increase
also depended on the relative cost of the host-killing gene
(and its competitor) on the host and on their rate of horizontal transfer.
The mcrBC action (Figure 1b) of host killing in competition
with the incoming methylation system is formally very similar
to this genetic addiction (Figure 1a). We expect that mcrBC
genes would increase: in the presence of spacial structure (in
a structured habitat); if the methylation is costly relative to
mcrBC genes; and if mcrBC genes transfer at a high rate. The
second point implies that a methylation system beneficial to
the host because of its function (see Background) would not
be eliminated. The third point is related to the frequent horizontal transfer of mcrBC genes. Mathematical treatment and
simulation more specialized to McrBC would help to identify
conditions for evolution of this form of programmed cell
death and to allow broader interpretations of the role of these
genes.
In this work, the term epigenetic indicates 'not genetic but
heritable through DNA replication' and is used to distinguish
among three modes of DNA methylation: genetic methylation, for example, in the biosynthesis of dTMP from dUMP,
then incorporation into DNA by the replication machinery;
epigenetic methylation, such as in 5-methylcytosine (m5C),
N4-methylcytosine (m4C) and N6-methyladenine (m6A),
which is inherited by maintenance methylation after DNA
replication; and non-genetic and non-epigenetic methylation
as, for example, in O6-methylguanine. It is known that the
non-epigenetic and non-genetic DNA methylation in O6methylguanine triggers cell death [86].
Exogenous expression of mouse DNA methyltransferases
induces lethality in Drosophila and Xenopus [87,88]. The
underlying mechanisms and biological significance of such
deaths in these heterologous systems remain unclear.

Conclusion

The observations and considerations presented in this study
are consistent with our hypothesis that McrBC-like systems
have evolved and are maintained because they would compete with particular epigenetic genome methylation systems
by sacrificing their host cell through chromosome cleavage.
They can be regarded as selfish mobile elements. This represents, to our knowledge, the first analysis of programmed
death machinery protecting the genome from epigenetic systems.

Materials and methods
Bacteria and plasmids
All the bacterial strains used were derivatives of E. coli K-12
and are listed in Table 2. The ΔaraBAD, ΔrecA and ΔrecBC
mutations were introduced into ER1563 [89] using a published procedure [90]. The ΔaraBAD mutation is a deletion of
the ΔaraBAD operon and was generated using the H1-ara
(GGTTTCGTTTGATTGGCTGTGGTTTTATACAGTCATTACT
GCCCGTAATAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC) and H2-araBAD (GGCGTCACACTTTGCTATGCCATAGCATTTTTATCC
ATAAGATTAGCGGAATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC) primers. The ΔrecA mutation is a deletion of the recA gene and was
created using the previously described primers [90]. The
ΔrecBC mutation is a deletion from recB through recC and
was generated using the H1-recBC (TTCATTACGCCTCCTCCAGGGT CATACCGGCAAACATCTCATCCATCAGGGTGTA
GGCTGGAGCTGCTTC) and H2-recBC (TCAGAGCCGCTATG
TTAAGGGTCTACCATTCCAATCGTCTGGACGTGCTATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC) primers. E. coli DH5α [91] and
DH5α MCR [92] were used for plasmid construction. Other
mutations were introduced by P1 transduction [93].
All the plasmids used are listed in Table 1. A 1,200 bp fragment including the pvuIIM gene without the SD sequence
was amplified from pYNEC302 [19] using the M.PvuII-1 (5'GgaattcGAATTCGGGCTGATAAAGGATTT-3') and M.PvuII2 (5'-GGggtaccGGTACCTTTGCTGAGGCGGTTTT-3') primers. Each PCR primer has an introduced restriction site, for
KpnI and EcoRI, respectively, at the 5' end (small letters). The
fragment was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and then
inserted into pBAD18 [51] to generate pEF1 (PBAD-pvuIIM;
ColE1; Ap). pIK8004 was constructed by Mikihiko Kawai by
inserting a NotI linker (GCGGCCGC, TaKaRa Bio, Otsu,
Shiga, Japan) into the DraI site of pBR322 (Mikihiko Kawai,
personal communication). pEF23 (PBAD-pvuIIM; ColE1;
Ap) was constructed by ligating a ClaI-SalI fragment of
pIK8004 and a ClaI-SalI fragment of pEF1. The pEF24 plasmid (PBAD-pvuIIM; pSC101; Ap) was constructed by ligating
the smaller SmaI-EcoRV fragment of pSC101 and a NotI-SalI
fragment of pEF23. pEF30 was constructed by joining the
EcoRI-HindIII fragment that contained the BamHI RM gene
complex of pYNEC404 to the larger EcoRI-HindIII fragment
of pBR322. pEF33 was constructed by eliminating a PvuII site
in the rop gene of pBR322 by mutation of Ser51 (AGC to

AGT). pEF43 was constructed by ligating a KpnI-EcoRI fragment of pEF1 with the larger KpnI-EcoRI fragment in pEF33.
A 2.4 kb fragment including the mcrB and mcrC gene was
amplified from E. coli ER1563 using the EcoKMcrBC-for (5'GGGggtaccATGGAATCTATTCAACCCTGGATTG-3')
and
EcoKMcrBC-rev (5'-GGGgtcgacTTATTTGAGATATTCATCGAAAATG-3') primers. Each PCR primer has an introduced
restriction site for KpnI or SalI at the 5' end (small letters).
The fragment was digested with KpnI and SalI and then
inserted into pBAD30 [51] to generate pEF46. pEF60 was
constructed by deletion of the DraI-StuI fragment, including
the ampicillin-resistance gene, through DraI and StuI cleavage followed by self-ligation.
Genomic DNA was obtained from Issei Narumi for D. radiodurans R1, Toshiaki Fukui for T. kodakaraensis, and Yutaka
Kawarabayashi for S. Tokodaii str. 7. Other mcrBC homologs
were similarly amplified from the genomic DNAs using
DraMcrBC-for
(5'-GGGggtaccATGAGCGACGCTGCCATTTCGTGTT-3') and DraMcrBC-rev (5'-GGGgtcgacTCAGGTCAAGACCGAAGCTGGCCAT-3'), TkoMcrBC-for (5'-GGG
ggtaccGTGGGCAGATTTGAGATTTCCGAAA-3') and TkoMcrBC-rev (5'-GGGgtcgacTTAAACCTCTCCCGAAGAGCAGA
GG-3'), TkoMcrBC2-for (5'-GGGggtaccATGAATCAATCAGTTATAATAGATG-3') and TkoMcrBC2-rev (5'-GGGgtcgacCTAGTTTATTAGCGAATTTAGATAA-3'), StoMcrBC-for (5'GGGggtaccGTGAACAAAAGAGATATACAACTAC-3')
and
StoMcrBC-rev (5'-GGGgtcgacTTAGATTTTACGATTTTCGCC
TTTT-3'), or StoMcrBC2-for (5'-GGGggtaccGTGAGGTTAAGAAAAAGAGATCTAG-3') and StoMcrBC2-rev (5'-GGGgtcgacTTAACTAATAATACCTTTTTTCTT-3') primers.
A SalI-PstI fragment of pPvuCat16 (pPvu1 ori, pvuIIM) and
pPvuCat17 (pPvu1 ori) [43] carrying the cat gene was replaced
by a PCR-generated fragment carrying the kan gene from
pUC4K to generate pEF65 (pPvu1 ori, pvuIIM) and pEF67
(pPvu1 ori), respectively. The kan fragment was amplified
using kan-for (5'-ACGCgtcgacGTTGTGTCTCAAAATCTC-3')
and kan-rev (5'-TTctgcagAACCAATTCTGATTAGAAAA-3')
primers.

Phages
λ phage strain LIK891 was as described [94]. This phage possesses a single site for HindIII located near the int gene, a
deletion between EcoRI sites 1 and 2, immunity substitution
from phage 21 (imm21), and deletion between SalI sites,
which inactivates the red and gam genes. λ phage strain
LIK891 carries 15 PvuII sites. M.PvuII-modified λ LIK891
was prepared on ER1562 (pYNEC313 = pBR322::pvuIIRMC)
by the plate lysate method [95], while its unmodified version
was prepared on ER1562. λ phage strain LEF1 was constructed by inserting a Hind III fragment of pYNEC301 into
the HindIII site of LIK891.

The modification status of the phage was confirmed by resistance to PvuII restriction endonuclease both in vitro and in
vivo. λ phage prepared by the plate method (see above) was
purified by ultra-centrifugation [96]. The phage genome DNA
was purified from the λ preparation using a λ DNA purification kit (TaKaRa Bio), digested with PvuII (TaKaRa Bio), and
subjected to pulsed-field agarose gel electrophoresis. PvuII
treatment introduced no detectable change in electrophoresis
pattern for PvuII-modified λ LIK891 and LEF1 DNAs when it
completely cleaved unmodified λ LIK891 DNA (date not
shown). PvuII-modified λ LIK891 and LEF1 showed no
decrease in plaque formation efficiency in ER1562
(pYNEC313 = pBR322::pvuIIRMC) compared to that in
ER1562, although the unmodified λ LIK891 was restricted
severely to a relative plaque formation efficiency of 4 × 10-6.
For the phage plaque assay, an overnight culture of E. coli was
diluted 100-fold and grown to mid-exponential phase at 37°C
with aeration in λ polypepton broth (Nihon Seiyaku, Chiyodaku, Tokyo, Japan) with 0.2% maltose and 10 mM MgSO4.
Phage was appropriately diluted and mixed with 100 μl of the
fresh culture. After incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes, the
phage-bacteria complex was mixed with 2 ml of λ polypepton
top agar and poured on λ polypepton agar plate. After incubation at 37°C for 18 h, plaques were counted.

Plasmid preparation and quantitative transformation
Plasmid DNA was purified using a QIAGEN kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). To confirm the accuracy of transformation, varying amounts of pUC19 plasmid DNA were
transformed into E. coli DH5α by electroporation with a Gene
Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA), as described
[97]. Various amounts of pACYC184 plasmid were added to
give a total DNA amount of 200 ng.

Preparation of chromosomal DNA
Cells were lysed within an agarose gel by modification of a
published method [98] as follows. The cells were mixed with
2,4-dinitrophenol to block energy metabolism at the indicated time intervals (in minutes) after the induction of PvuII
methyltransferase. After centrifugation, the pellet was
washed twice with suspension buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 20 mM NaCl and 50 mM EDTA). The cells were mixed
with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 2% lowmelting agarose (SeaPlaque GTG agarose, FMC Bioproducts,
Rockland, Massachusetts, USA), pipetted into a plug mold
(Bio-Rad), and allowed to cool. The resulting plugs were incubated at 37°C for 2 h in lysozyme solution (lysozyme (1 mg/
ml), sodium deoxycholate (0.2%), sodium lauryl sarcosinate
(0.5%), 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM
EDTA). The plugs were then washed twice with sterilized
water, incubated at 50°C for 15 h in proteinase K solution
(100 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), sodium deoxycholate (0.2%),
sodium lauryl sarcosinate (1%) and proteinase K (1 mg/ml)),
and washed with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and
50 mM EDTA). For PvuII restriction enzyme digestion, the
plugs were washed in 2 mM PMSF (Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA to inactivate residual Proteinase K and incubated in 500 μl of the 1×
M buffer (TaKaRa Bio) and 50 units of PvuII (TaKaRa Bio)
per plug at 37°C for 15 h. After incubation, the plugs were
washed with the wash buffer.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis

For comparison of plasmids, 100 ng of plasmid DNA, purified
by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide centrifugation, was
used. The number of transformants was determined by
spreading an aliquot on agar plates containing ampicillin (50
μg/ml). Relative transformation efficiency to the vector was
calculated to normalize the transformation efficiency
between strains.

Samples were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in
a CHEF-DR III System (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 18 h or 12 h run time, 5- to 40-s of switch time ramp,
120° included angle, 6 V/cm, 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer
(0.045 M Tris-borate, 0.01 M EDTA), 14°C, 1.2% Certified
Megabase agarose (Bio-Rad). For size markers, a λ DNA ladder (Bio-Rad) and λ DNA/HindIII markers were used. After
the run, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 1 h,
destained in water, and examined using a FLA-5100 image
analyzer (Fujifilm, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence response of each well was determined using the profile
analysis feature of the Image Gauge software (Fujifilm). Background was subtracted.

Induction of PvuII methyltransferase

Microscopic observation

Overnight cultures carrying pEF24 (PBAD-pvuIIM; pSC101;
Ap) were diluted 100-fold and grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani
(LB) medium containing 25 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% glucose. When the cultures reached the mid-exponential phase,
the cultures were adjusted to OD600 = 0.1 in fresh medium
containing 25 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.0002% or 0.002% arabinose. The cultures were appropriately diluted to maintain
them at the exponential phase. To measure colony-forming
units, cells were diluted in LB with 0.2% glucose and spread
on LB agar with 0.2% glucose.

Cells were mixed with an equal volume of methanol-formaldehyde (2:1). After incubation on ice for 10 minutes, the cells
were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mM MgSO4 and stained with DAPI (4',6diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride). The cells were
observed using a fluorescence microscope.

Phylogenetic analysis
McrB and McrC homologs were identified by PSI-BLAST [64]
searches of the GenBank database. Multiple sequence alignments were constructed by iterating automated alignment
construction with MUSCLE [99] and manual correction until

all conserved regions had been satisfactorily aligned. Incomplete protein sequences that lacked more than 50% conserved
regions have been omitted from further analyses. MEGA4
[100] was used to calculate Minimum Evolution phylogenetic
trees of McrB and McrC families for conserved regions with
<5% gaps, using the following options: JTT matrix, 1,000
bootstrap replicates, Close Neighbor Interchange level = 2,
with initial trees calculated by the neighbor-joining method.

The alignment of 481,650 16S rRNA sequences was obtained
from the RDP database [101]. Only one representative
sequence per genome (113 sequences total) was retained for
further analysis. Missing sequences were retrieved manually
from the GenBank database, and subsequently aligned to the
partial 16S rRNA alignment from the RDP. The multiple
sequence alignment was refined by hand to remove truncated
variants. The final alignment comprising 154 16S rRNA
sequences was used to calculate the Minimum Evolution tree
with MEGA 4.0 (Maximum Composite Likelihood, 1,000
bootstrap replicates). The dot-plot analysis of amino acid
sequences was performed by DNASIS (Hitachi Software
Engineering, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan) with the following parameters: check size = 10, matching size = 6.

The mcrB neighborhood has been defined as 10,000 base
pairs upstream and 10,000 base pairs downstream of the
translation start and stop codons of the mcrB-like gene. The
corresponding DNA sequences together with the protein
sequences encoded within their boundaries were retrieved
from GenBank [102]. For all proteins encoded in the McrB
neighborhood, the ultra-sensitive HHSEARCH program for
detection of homology [103] was used to search for amino
acid sequence similarity against the PFAM database of protein families and domains. A membership in a top-scoring
protein family was assigned to a given McrB neighbor only for
matches with an e-value = 0.001; in all the remaining cases,
the sequences have been considered unassigned. Analogous
homology assignments have been made for all protein
sequences in three representative genomes: E. coli K12 [104],
Bacillus subtilis [105], and Pyrococcus abyssi [106].
