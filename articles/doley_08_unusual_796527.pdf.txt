Abstract
Background: Toxin profiling helps in cataloguing the toxin present in the venom as well as in
searching for novel toxins. The former helps in understanding potential pharmacological profile of
the venom and evolution of toxins, while the latter contributes to understanding of novel
mechanisms of toxicity and provide new research tools or prototypes of therapeutic agents.
Results: The pygmy copperhead (Austrelaps labialis) is one of the less studied species. In this
present study, an attempt has been made to describe the toxin profile of A. labialis from Kangaroo
Island using the cDNA library of its venom glands. We sequenced 658 clones which represent the
common families of toxin genes present in snake venom. They include (a) putative long-chain and
short-chain neurotoxins, (b) phospholipase A2, (c) Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, (d) CRISPs, (e)
C-type lectins and (f) Metalloproteases. In addition, we have also identified a novel protein with
two Kunitz-type domains in tandem similar to bikunin.
Conclusion: Interestingly, the cDNA library reveals that most of the toxin families (17 out of 43
toxin genes; ~40%) have truncated transcripts due to insertion or deletion of nucleotides. These
truncated products might not be functionally active proteins. However, cellular trancripts from the
same venom glands are not affected. This unusual higher rate of deletion and insertion of nucleotide
in toxin genes may be responsible for the lower toxicity of A. labialis venom of Kangroo Island and
have significant effect on evolution of toxin genes.

Background
Australian elapids are among the most venomous land
snakes of the world. Various bioactive peptide have been
purified and characterized from these venoms and a comprehensive survey of the bioactive proteins present in a
number of these snake venoms have been reported

recently [1]. Snakes in Austrelaps genus are widely distributed in Australia, but are moderately toxic compared to
other elapids [2]. Presently three species of Austrelaps
(commonly referred as copperheads) are known – Lowland copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), Highland copperhead (Austrelaps ramsayi) and Pygmy copperhead

(Austrelaps labialis). So far, only a small number of proteins have been isolated and characterized from A. superbus venom. They are mostly phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
enzymes [3-5] and cobra venom factor-like protein [6].
However, no significant data on the venoms of other two
species are available. Pigmy copperhead (A. labialis) is
smaller in size as compared to A. superbus and A. ramsayi
[7] and it has distinguishable white bars to its upper lips,
circular eyes and yellowish-brown iris [8]. They mainly
feed on small lizards and frogs [7] and the LD50 of their
venom is 1.3 mg/kg [8]. In the present study, we have
attempted to profile venom components of A. labialis to
define its composition and to look for novel proteins.
Profiling venom toxins can be achieved via transcriptomics or proteomics approach. In former approach, the transcripts are directly sequenced from a cDNA library
constructed from the venom gland, whereas in the latter
approach venom proteins are separated using various
techniques like LCMS, 2D gel electrophoresis and HPLC.
We have obtained toxin profile of pygmy copperhead
venom by constructing of cDNA. The data revealed that
neurotoxins and PLA2 are the most abundant proteins in
this venom. Interestingly, most of the toxin families in
this cDNA library have truncated transcripts. We propose
that the lower venom toxicity and subsequent decreased
size of these snakes could be due to unusually high degree
of deletions or insertions (~40%) in their toxin genes
resulting in truncated, most likely inactive products.

Methods
Construction of library and DNA sequencing
Venom glands were dissected and extracted from an euthanized A. labialis snake captured in Kangaroo Island,
South Australia (Venom supplies Pte Ltd, Tanunda, South
Australia). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy® mini
kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA). The purity and the
concentration were spectrophotometrically determined.
First strand cDNAs were synthesized from 150 ng of total
RNA according to protocol of Creator™ SMART™ cDNA
library construction kit obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA, USA). Amplification of full-length
double-stranded cDNA was carried out using PCR-based
protocol. Double-stranded cDNA PCR products (100 bp10 kb) were purified and subjected to TA cloning. Ligation
products were transformed into the competent TOP10 E.
coli strain obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA,)
and plated on LB/Amp/IPTG/X-gal for blue/white screening. A bidirectional pGEM®-T Easy vector system obtained
from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) plasmid-based cDNA
library was titered with 0.8 × 106 CFU/ml. Individual colonies were picked randomly and the presence of insert
was confirmed by EcoRI digestion. Only clones containing inserts larger than 200 bp in length were selected for
further DNA sequencing.

DNA sequencing reactions were carried out using the ABI
PRISM® BigDye® terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (BDV3.1) according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). DNA
sequencing was carried out using ABI PRISM® 3100 automated DNA sequencer. Sequencing was repeated at least
twice in all singletons to make sure there was no error created by sequencing step.
Cloning snake venom protein with two Kunitz domains
PCR amplification of protein containing two Kunitz-type
domain from RNA pool was performed using a forward
primer designed from the signal peptide-encoding region
(5'-CGATGACGCGCGAGAAAAG-3') and the reverse
primer from library construction kit (5'-ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGACATG-d(T)30-3').
Long
PCR
enzyme mix (Fermentas, Burlington, Ont., Canada) was
used in the amplification reaction. PCR was performed as
follows: 35 cycles of one step each at 95°C for 15 s, 58°C
for 15 s, 68°C for 3 min followed by a final extension step
at 68°C for 10 min. PCR products were subjected to 1%
agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. Amplified PCR products were gel purified and cloned
to pGEM®-T Easy vector system and sequenced subsequently.
Analysis of sequence data by bioinformatics tools
The DNA sequences were analyzed after trimming the
adaptor sequences (GENE RUNNER software) and the
putative functions of the gene products were predicted by
batch BLASTing sequence results in GRID blast system.
The signal peptide was predicted using online SignalP 3.0
server. Clustering of sequences was performed using FastGroupII [9] and sequences were aligned using ClustalW
[10]. Jalview [11] was employed to make some necessary
editing on sequence alignments. Phylogenetic trees were
generated using PHYML [12], which uses maximum likelihood method to build phylogenetic tree.

Results and discussion
Compositions of cDNA library
We randomly selected and isolated 780 clones. Of these
only 658 clones, which had larger than 200 bp inserts,
were sequenced and analyzed. These ESTs were categorized into different clusters on the basis of sequence similarities. Members of each clusters has been sequenced
completely and the full length sequences were submitted
to NCBI with accession numbers from EU003085 to
EU003110, EU012449 and EU012450. BLAST search
against nucleotide, protein and EST database, revealed
that 60% of the EST belong to putative toxins, while 32%
belong to cellular transcripts and 8% of the EST were
unknown transcripts (Fig. 1A). These relative ratios may
change, if more EST clones are sequenced and analyzed.

Toxin genes
Putative toxin genes found in the cDNA library were further grouped based on their sequence similarities to
known toxin superfamilies (Fig. 1B). In total, we found six
superfamilies of the toxin genes in the cDNA library of A.
labialis. These families, in order of abundance, are threefinger toxin family (193 clones), phospholipase A2 family
(139 clones), Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor family (38
clones), cysteine-rich protein family (32 clones), metalloproteinase family (12 clones) and C-type lectin family (7
clones) (Fig. 1B).
Three-finger toxin family
Three-finger toxin family is a well characterized non-enzymatic polypeptide family named after their canonical protein folds. Members of this family contain about 60–74
amino acid residues [13-16] and exhibit various pharmacological activities such as neurotoxic, cytotoxic, cardiotoxic, anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects [13-15].
Three-finger family forms the major group of toxins (45%
abundance) in this cDNA library, and majority of mature
proteins are 66–69 amino acid residues in length. We
identified a total of 166 sequences (8 clusters and 10 singletons) with 60%–80% identities to known long-chain
neurotoxins (Figure 2A) and 27 sequences (1 cluster and
1 singleton) with 60%–85% identical to short-chain neurotoxins (Figure 2B).
Long-chain neurotoxins
Clone 8A (80 clones) is the most dominant long-chain
neurotoxin and other clones (208, 23B, 10B, 92, 464, 458

and 26B) are its isoforms with few amino acid substitutions (Figure 2A). Most of these substitutions are due to
single nucleotide changes. Since these isoforms are represented by many clones, these sequence differences are not
artifacts of sequencing. However, clone 5B has 10 substitutions and hence may have distinct specificity compared
to other long-chain neurotoxins. Further, a dinucleotide
(GT) deletion in front of the typical stop codon position
followed by a dinucleotide (CT) insertion (Additional file
1) in the gene resulted in a frame shift and additional five
amino acid residues in clone 5B (Figure 2A). However,
two clones (160 and 646) are distinctively shorter due to
deletion of nucleotides A131 and G111 respectively (see
Additional file 1), resulting in the frame shift and truncated peptides.
There were eight clones identical to clone 160 suggesting
that this observation is not due to sequencing error. The
segments after the deletion show significant identity with
other complete transcripts. Similar phenomenon was
observed in sea snake Aipysurus eydouxii in which a dinucleotide deletion leads to the truncation of the only threefinger neurotoxin found in the venom gland library and
the loss of toxicity [17]. In contrast, in clone 112 deletion
of A224 leads to a potentially much longer protein product. In this case, three of the conserved cysteine residues at
the C-terminal end are lost due to the frame shift. Three
distinct neurotoxin sequences (clones 21, 242 and 509)
compared to clone 8A and its closer sibling toxins were
also found in the cDNA library. Clones 21 and 242
encode for slightly longer proteins with 75 and 86 amino

acid residues respectively as compared to other clones. In
these cases there is a single nucleotide substitution at consensus stop codon (TAA) present in the majority of these
putative long-chain neurotoxins. In clone 509, a dinucleotide (TA) deletion in the stop codon followed by a dinucleotide (CA) insertion and a dinucleotide deletion (AC)
has been found.
Most of the putative full length long-chain neurotoxins
possess the functionally conserved residues such as Lys23,
Trp25, Asp27, Phe29, Arg33 and Lys35 that are shown to
participate in the binding to Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the case of α-cobratoxin from
Naja naja venom [18]. However, Lys49 (corresponding to
position 50 in A. labialis toxins) is replaced by the negatively charged Glu50 (Figure 2A). This charge reversal may

significantly reduce its interaction with Torpedo nAChR as
mutation of K49 to E49 in α-cobratoxin cause 53 fold
decrease in binding affinity [18]. Further, neutrally
charged Ala28 (corresponding to position 29 in A. labialis
toxins) which is specific for binding to α7-nAChR in αcobratoxin, is replaced by the positively charged Arg29
with the exception of clone 5B (Figure 2A). This substitution did not affect the binding affinity to the receptor in
the case of α-cobratoxin [19].
The majority of A. labialis long-chain neurotoxins form a
distinctive group almost completely separated from the
other long-chain neurotoxins (Figure 3). Phylogenetically, this separation seems to start quite early in the evolution time frame as indicated by early branching pattern
originating from the root. Interestingly, three distinct

clones (21, 242 and 509) form a separate cluster as compared to other long-chain neurotoxins and appear to have
a completely different phylogenetic origin.
Short-chain neurotoxins
Two representatives of short-chain neurotoxins, Clone 6A
and 12B were found in the library (1 cluster with 21
clones and 1 singleton respectively). Their amino acid
sequences are identical except for the substitution of
Thr13 by Ala. Both short-chain neurotoxins have one
additional Cys residue at the fourth position (Figure 2B).
Appearance of Cys at 4th position is observed for shortchain neurotoxins from sea snake venom [20]. They have
functionally invariant residues such as Lys27, Trp29,

Asp31, Arg33 and Lys47 which are important in the binding of erabutoxin a (Laticauda semifasciata) to Torpedo
nAChR [21,22]. Interestingly, one of the binding residues,
Phe32 found in erabutoxin-a, is replaced by His in A. labialis short-chain neurotoxins which might effect its binding to the receptor.
Phospholipase A2 family
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2; EC 3.1.1.4) enzymes are esterolytic enzymes which hydrolyze glycerophospholipids at
the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone releasing lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. Snake venom PLA2
enzymes are one of the well studied superfamily of snake
venom enzymes [23] which play an important role in

immobilization and capture of prey. In addition to their
role in digestion of preys, they exhibit variety of pharmacological effects such as neurotoxic, myotoxic, cardiotoxic, anticoagulant, antiplatelet and edema-inducing
effects [24]. A total of 139 PLA2 cDNA clones were
obtained which makes up the second abundant family.
The deduced amino acid sequences are 65% to 97% identical to other PLA2 sequences and were grouped into three
clusters and four singletons. All PLA2 cDNA sequences
obtained from this snake belong to group IA.
Clones 243, 330, 563 and 488 are the most abundant
clones in this library and are closely related to the PLA2
sequences of A. superbus [5] of the same genus. However,
they are different from the other PLA2 enzymes due to the
presence of three tryptophan residues in the β-wing. At
present, role of these Trp residues are not known. These
PLA2 enzymes together with five PLA2 isoforms of A. superbus (AAD56550, AAD56551, AAD56552, AAD56553, and
AAD56554) [5] form a distinguishable cluster shown in
phylogram generated by PHYML method (data not
shown). This cluster is well separated from the other PLA2
enzymes having one tryptophan residue in the β-wing.
Clones 518 and 636 have significant difference in amino
acid sequences of other A. labialis PLA2 enzymes. Clone
636 encodes for the full length protein sequence, whereas
clone 518 encodes for a truncated product due to a single
nucleotide (A) addition at position 247 (Additional file 2)
(from ATG) leading to frame shift and premature truncation (Figure 4). These clones form a distinct cluster along
with AAD56557 (PLA2 from A. superbus) (data not
shown).

Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor family
Kunitz-type of protease inhibitors are 60 residues long
which possess the conserved sequence motif of 6 cysteines
(C [8X]C [15X]C [4X]YGGC [12X]C [3X]C) [25] and functionally belong to bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
(BPTI) family [26]. This family of snake venom protein is
known to involve in coagulation, fibrinolysis and inflammation through interaction with various proteases [27].

38 cDNA clones in this library belong to Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor family. The sequences of this group
are 77%–90% identical to mulgin isoforms (Pseudechis
australis) and textilinin isoforms (Pseudonaja textilis textilis) (Figure 5A). Textilinins are shown to be distinct plasmin inhibitors and have a 60% bleeding reduction in
murine model [28]. It will be interesting to study the role
of these Kunitz-type serine proteases inhibitors in blood
clotting cascade. However one of the clones, clone 602
was found to be truncated prematurely due to transversion of one nucleotide (A→T) at position 122 (from AAA
encoding for Lys to TAA stop codon). This clone was resequenced to confirm the transversion is not due to
sequencing error.
A unique clone (655) encoding protein with two tandem
Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains was found in this
cDNA library. The entire cDNA sequence is 2,031 bp long
(Figure 5B) and the deduced peptide has 252 amino acid
residues with potential glycosylation site. Its presence was
further confirmed by PCR using gene specific and reverse
primer from cDNA construction kit. We sequenced 48
clones and seven isoforms with minor changes in the
amino acid sequence were found (Figure 5C). They are
40% identical to bikunin, a serine proteinase inhibitor
with two Kunitz domains [29]. Bikunin from human pla-

centa exhibits a potent inhibitory effect to some serine
proteases crucial in the blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, such as factor XIa and plasmin [30]. This is the first
report of this novel member of Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor family from snake venom.

Cysteine-rich protein family
Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) are abundantly
found in mammalian reproductive tracts and play important role in sperm maturation and immune system [31].
They have also been found in venoms of reptiles. The conserved sequence in CRISPs span through out the protein
with 16 cysteine residues and 10 of them resides in the Cterminal end [32]. CRISPs have been purified and characterized from various snake venoms [32,32-34]. Functions
of majority of these proteins are unknown. Some of them
are known to block cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels
[35,36] while several others block potassium-stimulated
smooth muscle contraction [33].

606 and 623 respectively. Clone 218 has two single nucleotide deletions of A579 and A648. Clone 492 has also two
single nucleotide deletions of A579 and G623. Clones
217 and 399 have an insertion of one A at position 349
while clone 399 has another insertion of T in position
483. In case of clone 363 there is an insertion of T and A
at position 341 and 349, deletions of T572, A579, A605,
A610 and A621 (Additional file 3). Due to these insertions in clone 217 and 399 C-terminal end has encoded
different amino acid residues as compared to other
CRISPs. Clones 521, 218, 492 and 363 have several deletions in the ORF leading to frame shift and premature
truncation. Thus, all of them are prematurely terminated
losing the C-terminal domain where most of the conserved cysteine residues are found (Figure 6). Thus the
truncated transcript might not be functional. However,
the N-terminal region have high identity to snake venom
CRISPs (53%–94%), but low identity to human, murine,
frog CRISPs (less than 40%).

32 cDNA clones encoding CRISPs making up 8% of the
library has been observed. This family has one cluster and
four singletons (Figure 6). Clone 521 has a dinucleotide
deletion (CT) in position 549 and series of single nucleotide deletion of A in positions 537, 579, 595 and 597,
single nucleotide deletion of T, C and G at position 575,

Metalloproteinase family
Snake venom metalloproteinases are more abundantly
found in viper venoms, but they are also reported from
elapid family [37,38]. They are synthesized as zymogens
in the venom gland and contain a propeptide which is
cleaved off during maturation. They have a common zinc

binding site with a consensus sequence of HEXXHXXGXXH [39]. They are classified into different types (PI to P-IV) on the basis of the other domains that are
present in these complexes [40]. This family of enzymes
are responsible for haemorrhagic [41,42], local
myonecrotic [43], antiplatelet [44], edema-inducing and
other inflammatory effects [45,46]. We have found 12
clones which makes 3% of the entire cDNA library, however they code for only the signal peptide and the N-terminal region similar to trigramin precursor and mocarhagin
(data not shown). This is due to the loss of two nucleotides at position 316 downstream of ATG leading to premature termination of the protein. Thus, if proteins of this
family are present in the venom, they would have only
partial propeptide without any other functional domains
of metalloproteinase or disintegrin.

lectins found in Bungarus fasciatus and B. multicinctus [53],
56% identical to galactose-binding lectin found in Bitis
arietans [55], but less than 37% identical to C-type lectin
related proteins. The deduced amino acid sequence
reveals the conserved carbohydrate binding domain as
well as the Ca2+ interaction amino acid residues (Figure
7). The odd cysteine present is likely to involved in interchain disulphide bond [50,55]. The presence of only one
cluster of 7 clones indicates that it may exist as
homodimer similar to other C-type lectins. Further, phylogenetic analysis (data not shown) revealed that this putative C-type lectin is more closely related to galactosebinding proteins and forms a cluster distinct from that of
C-type lectin like proteins that bind to blood coagulation
factors or platelet receptors. Thus, this clone most likely
encodes a homodimeric C-type lectin.

C-type lectin family
C-type lectins are non-enzymatic proteins that bind to
mono- and oligosaccharides in presence of Ca2+ [47].
Generally they contain the highly conserved domain
called the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) [48].
C-type lectins and related proteins have been frequently
reported from Viperidae snake venoms. Venom C-type
lectin related proteins are known to disrupt the normal
functioning of haemostatic mechanism by interfering in
the normal platelet receptor-ligand interaction, binding to
coagulation factors and other important proteins in coagulation cascade [48]. Only few of them have been
reported from elapids [49-53] including Australian elapids [54].

Cellular transcripts
150 clones were identified as cellular trancripts which
were grouped into 15 clusters and 1 singleton which constituted 32% of the entire library (Figure 1A). This suggests that harvesting the venom gland after 3–4 days after
milking increases the chances of obtaining mostly high
abundant toxin genes. We identified ribosomal proteins,
creatine kinase, dehydrogenase, muscle troponin, cytochrome b, parvalbumin, heparin binding protein and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) in this library. In
addition, polyadenylated 12S and 16S rRNAs were also
found. Although polyadenylation is the distinctive features of mRNA, polyadenylation of rRNA has been
observed in yeast [56], Leishmania [57] as well as in other
higher organisms including human [58]. These polyadenylated rRNAs are degraded subsequently through Polyadenyled-stimulated RNA degradation pathway [56,58].

This family has seven clones which form one cluster. The
primary structure shows 71% and 74% identical to C-type

Unknown sequences
8% of the cDNA sequences (Figure 1A) of the library did
not show any significant match to toxins or other metabolic genes and hence were categorized as unknown
sequences. Bioinformatics analysis of these sequences
showed only partial or poor homology to protein
sequences of other organism. Their functional role is not
known.
Accelerated rate of deletions and insertions in toxin genes
Evolution of large multigene families in snake venom
occurs through "birth and death" process [59]. Toxin
genes appear to undergo duplication followed by accelerated evolution to give rise to new genes [60]. Some of the
genes either get deleted from the genome due to unequal
cross-over and other phenomena or become non-functional and degenerate into pseudogenes [61]. Such birth
and death phenomenon allows the snake to adapt to target various preys. In A. labialis, we observed unusually
accelerated rate of deletions and insertions in toxin cDNA
clones resulting in the death of functional toxin genes.
Out of the 43 cDNAs encoding toxins (Table 1), only 26
encode full length proteins. A total of 17 cDNAs encode
for truncated products due to deletions (10 genes) or
insertions (7 genes). Thus 39.5% of the toxin cDNAs
encode non-functional products. Even the main toxin
groups are severely affected. For example, six neurotoxin
genes and three PLA2 genes were truncated. Interestingly,
entire families of metalloproteinases and CRISPs appear
to be lost due to deletions and insertions. Although some
of the long-chain neurotoxin genes encode full length
functional proteins, there are some deletions at their Cterminal ends. These observations were made not only in
singletons, but also in a number of clusters of toxin genes.
In contrast none of the cellular transcripts (150 clones;
32% of cloned genes) showed deletions or insertions in
nucleotide level. Thus, the only toxin cDNAs show this
unusually high rate of deletions and insertions in A. labialis. The phenomenon of such high rate of accelerated
insertions and deletions in only the toxin genes
(described here) as with the accelerated evolution of
exons of the toxin genes [62] will be of great interest.

Recently, we showed that in marbled sea snake (Aipysurus
eydouxii) the only neurotoxin gene has a dinucleotide
deletion resulting in the loss of viable neurotoxin [17].
This explains the 50- to 100-fold decrease in venom toxicity in comparison to that of other species in the same
genus. We proposed that this loss could be a secondary
result of the adaptation of Aipysurus eydouxii to a new dietary habit – feeding exclusively on fish eggs and, thus, the
snake no longer requires its venom for prey capture [61].
Further, this snake is physically smaller in size compared
to Aipysurus laevis. Similarly, venom of Austrelaps labialis is
relatively less toxic compared to Austrelaps superbus and
Austrelaps ramsayi. The LD50 of A. labialis (1.3 mg/kg) [8] is
higher as compared to its close relative A. superbus whose
LD50 is 0.5 mg/kg when injected subcutaneouly [2]. Further, A. labialis are smaller in size compared to others.
Thus, rapid rate of deletions/insertions, as with accelerated evolution of toxin genes, may have significant influence in the evolution and survival of A. labialis. In a
previous study, Chijiwa et al. [63] showed that the protein
composition of venoms from Protobothrops flavoviridis
(formerly Trimeresurus flavoviridis) of Okinawa island was
different compared to that of snakes from the main island.
In Okinawa snakes, some of the main components, such
as myotoxic PLA2 enzymes BPI and BPII, were absent. The
genes encoding these proteins lost segments in their exon
and intron and have become pseudogenes. This loss of
BPI and BPII genes may not explain the overall decrease in
the venom toxicity [63]. Interestingly, haemorrhagic metalloprotease, HR1b from the venom of Okinawa snakes is
10 fold less active. However, the reasons for this decrease
in activity are not clearly understood. A detailed study of
the entire transcriptome of their venom glands may help
in understanding whether the observed regional variation
in Okinawa snakes is similar to our findings with A. labialis snake. It would also be interesting to examine the transcriptome of A. labialis inhabiting the mainland to
determine whether the observed accelerated deletions/
insertions in the genes of the Kangaroo Island inhabitant
is also a regional variation.

In the present study we have presented the toxin profile of
A. labialis by constructing cDNA library using its venom
gland tissue. Neurotoxin and PLA2 are the most abundant
family of toxin in this snake venom. However it is interesting to note that some of the toxin transcripts have been
found to be terminated prematurely either due to insertion or deletion of nucleotides. Due to these insertion and
deletion some of the genes might not code for functional
proteins. Such a higher rate of insertion and deletion
might be responsible for its lower toxicity and play crucial
role evolution of toxin genes.
