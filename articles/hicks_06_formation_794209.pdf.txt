Abstract
Background: The Tat pathway transports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of
bacteria and the thylakoid membrane of plants. In Eschericha coli, Tat transport requires the integral
membrane proteins TatA, TatB and TatC. In this study we have tested the ability of tat genes from
the eubacterial species Pseudomonas syringae, Streptomyces coelicolor and Aquifex aeolicus, to
compensate for the absence of the cognate E. coli tat gene, and thus to form functional Tat
translocases with E. coli Tat components.
Results: All three subunits of the Tat system from the Gram positive organism Streptomyces
coelicolor were able to form heterologous translocases with substantive Tat transport activity.
However, only the TatA and TatB proteins of Pseudomonas syringae were able to functionally
interact with the E. coli Tat system even though the two organisms are closely related. Of the Tat
components from the phylogenetically distant hyperthermophillic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus only
the TatA proteins showed any detectable level of heterologous functionality. The heterologously
expressed TatA proteins of S. coelicolor and A. aeolicus were found exclusively in the membrane
fraction.
Conclusion: Our results show that of the three Tat proteins, TatA is most likely to show crossspecies complementation. By contrast, TatB and TatC do not always show cross-complementation,
probably because they must recognise heterologous signal peptides. Since heterologouslyexpressed S. coelicolor TatA protein was functional and found only in the membrane fraction, it
suggests that soluble forms of Streptomyces TatA reported by others do not play a role in protein
export.

Background
There are two general pathways by which proteins are
translocated across the cytoplasmic membranes of bacteria. The Sec pathway, which is ubiquitous, uses a thread-

ing mechanism to transport unfolded polypeptides across
the membrane, driven by the energy of ATP hydrolysis
and the transmembrane proton gradient [1]. By contrast,

rial genomes sequenced so far, exports only pre-folded
proteins. Substrate proteins are targeted to the Tat
machinery by N-terminal signal peptides that harbour an
almost invariant pair of arginine residues, which are critical for transport by the Tat pathway [reviewed in [2,3]].
Tat transport is driven solely by the protonmotive force
[4].
Much of our understanding of protein transport by the Tat
pathway has come from dual studies of the bacterial Tat
pathway and the homologous ∆pH/Tat pathway in plant
thylakoids. The Tat system of Escherichia coli is comprised
of the three major components, TatA, TatB and TatC,
along with the minor component TatE which is a poorly
expressed TatA orthologue [5-9]. Protein purification and
cross-linking studies have identified two major types of
Tat protein complexes in the membranes of E. coli, and
analogous complexes have also been identified in thylakoid membranes. An equimolar complex of TatB and
TatC, which contains multiple copies of each component,
acts as the receptor for Tat substrates [10-12]. Site-specific
cross-linking studies have implicated TatC as the component that recognizes the twin arginine motif of the substrate signal peptide [12]. The TatA protein forms a
separate, highly heterogeneous complex, which varies in
size because it contains different numbers of TatA protomers [13-16]. Examination of purified TatA complexes
by negative stain electron microscopy reveal that it forms
channel complexes with internal diameters large enough
to accommodate folded substrate proteins [16]. Crosslinking studies suggest that TatA transiently associates
with the substrate-bound TatBC complex during active
protein translocation [12,17,18].
The Tat systems of some Gram positive bacteria, exemplified by Bacillus subtilis, and some Archaea show a slightly

different organization in that they lack TatB and therefore
have translocases that are comprised solely of TatA and
TatC [19]. The structural arrangement of subunits in these
minimal Tat systems is currently unknown. However, a
number of reports have indicated that at least some of the
TatA protein of Haloferax volcanii, B. subtilis, and of the
TatA and TatB proteins of Streptomyces lividans exists in a
soluble form in the cytoplasmic fractions of these organisms [20-22]. These findings are significant, because they
imply that the Tat systems in these prokaryotes may operate by a somewhat different mechanism to the canonical
Tat systems of E. coli and plant thylakoids.
Previous studies looking at heterologous interactions during Tat transport have generally focused on the ability of
Tat systems to recognize and transport foreign Tat substrates. Thus tat genes from different bacterial sources
have been expressed in an E. coli strain deleted for all Tat
components [23], which inform on the capacity of foreign
translocases to recognize and transport E. coli Tat substrate
proteins. Conversely, foreign Tat substrates have also been
expressed in E. coli, to test the capacity of the system to recognize non-native signal peptides and passenger proteins
[e.g. [24-28]]. However, very few studies have looked at
the ability of individual Tat subunits to substitute for the
absence of the cognate E. coli Tat component. It was
reported that Helicobacter pylori tatA could partially complement the Tat defect of an E. coli ∆tatA∆tatE strain, but
that H. pylori tatB could not substitute for E. coli tatB [8].
A very recent study suggested that the P. syringae pv tomato
DC3000 tatC gene could also complement the E. coli tatC
deletion strain [29].
In this work, we have systematically examined the ability
of tat genes from three different bacterial species to compensate for the absence of the cognate E. coli tat gene. The
organisms we selected for this study are Aquifex aeolicus, a
thermophilic bacterium which forms the deepest branch
in bacterial phylogeny, Streptomyces coelicolor, a Gram positive actinomycete and Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola
ES4326, which, like E. coli, is a gamma Proteobacterium.
E. coli diverged from A. aeolicus approximately 4 billion
years ago, from S. coelicolor approximately 3.2 billion
years ago and from P. syringae approximately 1.3 billion
years ago [30]. The percentage identities of the Tat proteins from these organisms with the paralogous E. coli Tat
proteins is shown in Table 1. Our results indicate that
TatA proteins from any of these organisms are able to, at
least partially, restore Tat activity to a strain lacking E. coli
tatA and tatE. The P. syringae tatB and S. coelicolor tatB and
tatC genes were also able to complement the cognate E.
coli tat deletion strains. Cell fractionation experiments
demonstrate that the heterologously expressed TatA proteins of S. coelicolor and A. aeolicus are found exclusively in
the membrane.

Results and discussion
Experimental design
Throughout these experiments we have used three different tests to assess functionality of the Tat system, each of
which depends upon the transport of one or more native
E. coli Tat substrates. E. coli tat mutants show a pleiotropic
cell envelope defect due to an inability to export two Tatdependent periplasmic amidases, AmiA and AmiC, which
are involved in cell wall remodelling [31,32]. Strains with
an inactive Tat system are unable to grow on solid media
in the presence of 2% SDS and therefore the ability to
grow in the presence of this detergent is a qualitative indication of Tat function [33]. Likewise, E. coli is able to grow
anaerobically using trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) as
an electron acceptor due to the Tat-dependent export of
two enzymes, TMAO reductase (TorA, which is a soluble
periplasmic protein) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO)
reductase (DmsABC, which is membrane-bound, with its
active site facing the periplasm [34]). Therefore the ability
of strains to grow anaerobically on minimal media with
glycerol as a carbon source and TMAO as sole electron
acceptor is also a qualitative indicator of Tat functionality.
Finally we have also assayed the activity of TMAO reductase in periplasmic extracts as a more quantitative assessment of the level of Tat functionality.

We have observed previously that the stoichiometry of Tat
subunit expression is critical for activity of the Tat translocase. In particular, high level expression of TatB relative to
TatA and TatC has a severe inactivating effect on the E. coli
Tat system [8]. Thus in the following experiments we have
routinely used pcnB derivatives of each of the tat mutant
strains, which drastically lowers the copy number of plasmids with the ColE1 replicon, typically to less than 5 copies per cell [35,36].
Heterologous expression of TatA proteins
As shown in Fig 1, expression of the S. coelicolor or P. syringae TatA proteins in the E. coli tatA/tatE mutant strain
resulted in significant restoration of Tat system function.
Thus the tatA/tatE strain expressing either of these constructs showed robust growth in the presence of SDS (Fig
1A), with TMAO as sole terminal electron acceptor (Fig
1B) and had significant TMAO reductase (TorA) activity in
the periplasmic fraction (Fig 1C). A. aeolicus is unusual in
that it has a tandem duplication of tatA genes, designated
tatA1 and tatA2, which share 68% identity with each other
over a 50 amino acid overlap. Expression of either or both
of these tatA genes in the E. coli tatA/tatE strain was sufficient to support growth in the presence of SDS or with
TMAO as sole electron acceptor (Fig 1A and 1B). However, the level of periplasmic TMAO reductase activity supported by these strains was not significantly above
background (Fig 1C) indicating that the rate of TorA
export was very low. None-the-less, these results suggest

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/64

that TatA proteins from all of the three species tested are
capable of some level of heterologous interaction with the
E. coli TatBC proteins.
We have previously demonstrated that residue F39 of E.
coli TatA is critical for TatA function and that mutation to
anything other than tyrosine or tryptophan not only inactivates TatA function but also shows a dominant phenotype such that in co-expression studies it grossly affects the
function of wild type TatA [37,38]. Surprisingly, S. coelicolor is one of a very few organisms that does not have
phenylalanine at that position. Instead the amino acid at
residue 40, which is the equivalent position in S. coelicolor
TatA, is leucine. Although a leucine substitution of E. coli
F39 is barely tolerated [38], the S. coelicolor TatA protein
shows a significant level of functionality in E. coli. We
tested whether the activity of S. coelicolor TatA could be
enhanced by mutagenesis of L40 to phenylalanine. However, as shown in Fig 1C, this substitution did not significantly alter the functionality of S. coelicolor TatA in the E.
coli system. We conclude that other residues in S. coelicolor
TatA compensate for the presence of a leucine at this position.
Heterologous expression of TatB
The TatB protein, where present, is an essential component of the Tat system. It forms an equimolar complex
with TatC and site-specific cross-linking analysis has indicated that it contacts Tat signal peptides close to the twin
arginine motif, but also within the hydrophobic core
[10,12]. In addition TatB has also been shown to co-purify
with TatA, with which it shares some sequence homology
[39]. It has been suggested to function as the adaptor
between the TatBC complex and the TatA channel complex and therefore high level expression of TatB may disrupt Tat function by interfering with the co-assembly of
the two individual complexes [8]. Since it interacts with
each of the other Tat components and with Tat signal peptides, cross-complementation with TatB might be
expected to be less efficient than with other Tat proteins.
As shown in Fig 2A and 2B, the TatB proteins from either
S. coelicolor or P. syringae permitted significant growth of
the E. coli tatB strain, BØD-P, on selective media containing either SDS or TMAO. By contrast A. aeolicus TatB (coexpressed on a construct that also contains tatC) did not
allow any significant growth of the E. coli tatB mutant on
either medium. It should, however, be noted that we were
not able to demonstrate expression of the A. aeolicus TatB
protein in E. coli (data not shown) so it is possible that A.
aeolicus TatB does not complement the E. coli tatB mutant
because the protein is not produced. Fractionation of the
tatB strain harbouring the different tatB genes and assay
for periplasmic TMAO reductase activity, shown in Fig 2C,
demonstrated that, as seen for TatA, the S. coelicolor TatB

It has been reported previously that the TatA and TatB proteins of S. lividans, an extremely close relative of S. coelicolor have partially overlapping activities [40]. We
therefore tested the ability of the S. coelicolor tatB gene to
complement the E. coli tatA/E mutant strain, and likewise
the S. coelicolor tatA gene to complement the E. coli tatB
mutant. In each case we saw no detectable complementation (results not shown).
Heterologous expression of TatC
The TatC protein is the largest and most conserved Tat
component. It has been implicated as a specificity determinant for Tat-dependent secretion, most likely through
recognition of Tat signal peptides [19,41]. Moreover, it
has also been shown to cross-link with Tat signals when
the site-specific cross-linker was incorporated adjacent to
the twin arginines, suggesting that it probably recognizes
the twin arginine motif of the signal peptide [12]. As
shown in Fig 3A, B and 3C, only the TatC protein of S. coelicolor restored any detectable level of Tat activity to the E.
coli tatC, pcnB mutant strain. The tatC genes of P. syringae
and A. aeolicus (the latter co-expressed with tatB) completely failed to complement the tatC strain, even for
growth on SDS-containing medium, which is the most
sensitive test for native Tat substrate export [42]. As shown
in Fig 3D, despite its lack of functionality when expressed
in the E. coli tatC strain, the A. aeolicus his-tagged TatC protein encoded on our construct was clearly produced in E.
coli and moreover was localized to the membrane fraction. We were not able to demonstrate whether the P.
syringae TatC protein was expressed in these experiments
because we lack a native antibody to the protein. However
in the section below we demonstrate clearly that it is
expressed from an analogous clone that also encodes P.
syringae tatA and tatB. Taken together our results suggest
that S. coelicolor Tat subunits show the greatest level of
cross-complementation, even though this organism is
more distantly related to E. coli than is P. syringae.
Heterologous expression of tatABC genes in a strain of E.
coli devoid of all Tat components
The experiments described above where individual Tat
subunits are expressed in E. coli examine the ability of that
particular subunit to interact with E. coli Tat components,
and, in addition, to recognize E. coli Tat signal peptides
and substrate proteins. Under these circumstances, it is
apparent that whilst all of the TatA proteins displayed
some level of heterologous function, the A. aeolicus tatB
and tatC genes, and P. syringae tatC, failed to complement
the cognate E. coli tat mutant strains. In order to determine
whether this was because of an inability to form functional complexes with E. coli Tat components rather than

an inability to interact with the test E. coli substrates, we
examined whether transport activity was observed when
the full set of heterologous Tat proteins were co-expressed.
As shown in Fig 4, the P. syringae tatABC operon showed
a low but detectable level of Tat function, indicating that
the P. syringae TatC protein alone was not functional in
the E. coli tatC strain most likely because it could not
either interact with E. coli TatB and/or TatA, or because it
was expressed at an inappropriate ratio with these proteins. An alternative explanation is that P. syringae tatC in
vector pUniprom-PC fails to express, although we note
that it clearly does express from the same vector in the
presence of P. syringae tatA and tatB. Conversely, the A.
aeolicus tatA1, tatA2, tatB and tatC genes when expressed
together from an artificial operon could not complement
the E. coli total tat deletion strain. With the proviso that all
of the A. aeolicus tatA, tatB and tatC genes express in E. coli,
this result suggests that the A. aeolicus Tat proteins are unable to recognize any of the AmiA, AmiC, TorA or DmsA
signal peptides.
A summary of the results we obtained for all of the heterologous expression experiments is shown in Table 2.

Heterologously expressed TatA proteins from S.
coelicolor and A. aeolicus are found exclusively in the
membrane fraction
One of the most striking reported differences between the
Tat system of E. coli and of Gram positive (and archaeal)
Tat systems is the presence of soluble forms of TatA in
these latter organisms. Since we demonstrated above that
the S. coelicolor and A. aeolicus TatA proteins show functionality in E. coli, it was reasonable to examine the subcellular location of these heterologously expressed TatA
proteins. As shown in Fig 5A, all of the E. coli TatA protein
was found in the membrane fraction. Strikingly, we also
found all of the heterologously expressed S. coelicolor TatA
and of the his-tagged A. aeolicus TatA1 and TatA2 proteins
exclusively in the membrane fraction. Whilst we cannot
rule out that any cytoplasmic forms of these heterologously-produced proteins might have been degraded,
these observations indicate that at least when expressed in
E. coli it is the membrane-bound protein that is functional
for transport.

Conclusion
In this report we have tested the ability of Tat proteins
from three different eubacterial species to form complexes
with E. coli Tat components. Surprisingly, we found that it
was the individual Tat proteins of S. coelicolor that consistently gave the highest level of Tat activity with the cognate
E. coli tat deletion strains. Indeed each of S. coelicolor TatA,
TatB and TatC formed heterologous Tat systems that were
able to support 40–50% of the wild type E. coli Tat activity. The P. syringae TatA protein was able to restore reason-

able Tat function to the E. coli tatA/E mutant strain, but
the tatB gene complemented very poorly and P. syringae
TatC was apparently completely inactive.
For each of the S. coelicolor and P. syringae cross-complementation experiments, individual Tat subunits were
expressed from identical constructs, with transcription
being driven by the constitutive E. coli tat promoter. It is
probable that the heterologously expressed S. coelicolor tat
genes are translated less efficiently than the P. syringae
genes because of codon bias resulting from the high G+C
content of S. coelicolor DNA. Whilst we cannot completely
rule out the possibility that there is a deleteriously high
level of production of the individual P. syringae Tat proteins (but see below), it is none-the-less, striking that the
S. coelicolor Tat proteins show a high level of cross-species
activity. One possible explanation for this might be linked
to the fact that the S. coelicolor has by far the largest predicted Tat secretome. Thus the S. coelicolor Tat system
probably transports in excess of 150 Tat substrates, including some of the largest Tat substrates ever identified [4345]. It therefore must recognize many different twin
arginine signal peptides and as a result one might expect
that the S. coelicolor Tat components are less stringent than

the P. syringae system in terms of signal peptide recognition and substrate size.
It should be noted that TatC from a different pathovar of
P. syringae to that tested here [but with which it shares
97% amino acid sequence identity; [46]] was reported to
show at least some minimal Tat activity in the E. coli tatC
strain for transport of the Tat substrates AmiA and/or
AmiC [29]. However in those experiments, the expression
of P. syringae tatC was from the strong ptac promoter on
plasmid pTrc99A and was carried out in a pcnB+ background where plasmid copy number would be considerably higher. Thus it is likely that the levels of TatC between
the two experiments would be significantly different
which may account for the discrepancy in the observed
activities.
It is striking to note that wherever cross-species complementation has been tested, TatA proteins always seem to
retain some level of function in the heterologous host
[8,47]. This suggests that the constraints on TatA function
are less severe than those for TatB or TatC and is consistent
with the fact that most of the interactions of heterologously expressed TatA would be self-oligomerisation to
assemble into channel-forming multimers. By contrast,
the constraints on cross-complementation with heterologously expressed TatB or TatC proteins are likely to be
much more stringent since this would require the formation of equimolar complexes with the appropriate E. coli
partner subunit, recognition of non-native signal peptides
and associated conformational changes to promote
assembly of the active translocase. It is notable that the A.
aeolicus TatA proteins, which would normally be operating at temperatures of 80°C, retain function when
expressed in E. coli cells growing at 37°C. Thus either the
TatA protein does not change conformation during the
transport cycle or the protein retains sufficient flexibility
for function even at temperatures considerably lower than
physiological.
A number of groups have reported in the literature the
presence of soluble forms of the TatA and TatB proteins
from Gram positive bacteria and archaea [20-22]. Fractionation and Western blotting showed quite clearly here
that all of the heterologously expressed TatA proteins
from S. coelicolor and A. aeolicus are found only in the
membrane fraction. It is not clear why extra-membraneous forms of TatA/TatB are present in some organisms,
but clearly since the S. coelicolor TatA protein [which is
100% identical to the S. lividans TatA protein; [48]] supports such a high level of Tat activity in E. coli then it is difficult to imagine how the mechanism of Tat transport at
least between E. coli and Streptomycetes cannot be anything other than highly similar.

Bacterial strains and growth conditions
The E. coli strains and plasmids employed in this study are
shown in Table 3. During all genetic manipulations, E. coli
strains were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB)
medium [49]. Concentrations of antibiotics were as
described previously [6]. The growth phenotypes of
mutants with TMAO as sole respiratory electron acceptor
were determined on M9 minimal medium agar plates [49]
supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 0.4% TMAO and
incubated in a gas jar under a hydrogen/carbon dioxide
atmosphere. The SDS-resistance phenotype of mutants
was tested on LB agar plates containing 2% SDS [33]. For
TMAO reductase assay, cells were cultured in modified
Cohen and Rickenberg medium [50], supplemented with
addition of 0.2% glucose and 0.4% TMAO.
Plasmid construction
Plasmids pUniprom-PA, pUniprom-PB and pUnipromPC carry the P. syringae pv maculicola ES4326 tatA, tatB and
tatC genes, respectively, under the control of the E. coli tat
promoter. They were cloned following amplification with
primers
GCGGCCGGATCCATGGGTATTTTTGACTGG
and GCGCTCTAGATTAAACC TGGTCTTTGCGG to
amplify tatA, GCGCGGGGATCCATGTTCGGTATCAGC
and GCGCGCTCTAGATCATGGGGCTCGCGGTGGC to
amplify tatB, and GCGC GCGGATCCATGAGCGCTGATATCCCG and GCGCGCTCTAGATCACGGTGT GGTGGCGGGCGG to amplify tatC (restriction sites shown in
bold) and plasmid pKS-PSMtatABC [46] as template. Each
product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned
into pUniprom [51] that had been similarly digested.
Plasmids pUniprom-SA, pUniprom-SB and pUnipromSC carry the S. coelicolor tatA, tatB and tatC genes, respectively, under the control of the E. coli tat promoter. They
were cloned following amplification with primers
GCGCGCGGATCCATGTTCGGAAGGCTCG GC and
GCGCGCTCTAGATCAGCGCTTGGTCGTGTC to amplify
tatA, GCGCG CGGATTCGTGTTCAATGACATAGGC and
GCGCGCTCTAGATCAGGTGGCG TCCATGTC to amplify
tatB, and GCGCGCGGATCCATGCCGCTCGCGGAACA C
and
GCGCGCTCTAGATCAGGTCACGTCGTCG
to
amplify tatC with S. coelicolor chromosomal DNA as template. Each product was digested with BamHI and XbaI
and cloned into pUniprom that had been similarly
digested.

Plasmids pFATAQ1 contains the tatA1 and tatA2 genes of
A. aeolicus, under control of the lac promoter. The tatA1
and tatA2 genes, whose reading frames overlap, were
amplified with the following primers: GCGCGCGAATTCCCCTTAAATTATTCTC TAAGGAGGC and GCGCGCGGATCCGCTGAGTTAAGCCTCTACCTTTTCC, with A.

and cloned into pBluescript that had been digested with
the same enzymes. The A. aeolicus tatB gene is not annotated on the genome [52], however, a gene encoding a
protein with 23% identity (over 102 amino acid overlap)
to E. coli TatB is found immediately upstream of the tatC
gene (see Table 1 for identities of Tat proteins studied in
this work with the paralogous E. coli protein), and we
herein refer to it as tatB. Plasmid pFATAQ2 contains the
tatB and tatC genes of A. aeolicus, under control of the lac
promoter. The genes, whose reading frames also overlap,
were amplified with primers GCGCGGATCCGGAAA
GCAATCCCTATTAACGGAAG and GCGCTCTAGAGCTTATGCCTTTTGAATT TCCTTC, digested with BamHI and
XbaI and cloned into pBluescript that had been predigested with the same enzymes. Plasmid pFATAQ3 contains an artificial operon encoding the tatA1, -A2, -B and C genes of A. aeolicus and was generated by subcloning the
tatBC coding region from pFATAQ2 by digestion with
BamHI and XbaI and ligation into pFATAQ1 that had been
similarly digested. For overproduction of the A. aeolicus
Tat proteins with C-terminal hexahistidine affinity tags,
the encoding tat genes were re-amplified and cloned into
the overexpression vector pQE70. Plasmid pQEAQ1 contains the gene encoding the TatA1 protein with a C-termi-

nal histag and was amplified using primers
GCGCGCATGCACTTTCCTCTGC CGTGGC and GCGCAGATCTTTTCACCCTCCTTTTTAACTTCC, and pFATAQ1 as
template. The product was digested with SphI and BglII,
and cloned into similarly digested pQE70. Plasmid
pQEAQ2 is analogous to pQEAQ1 but encodes a tagged
version of the TatA2 protein. It was cloned in a similar
manner, using primers GCGC ACATGTTTTCCCGGCGGAATATCTATG and GCGCAGATCTAGCCTCTACC TTTTCCTTCTC to amplify the encoding gene. Plasmid
pQEAQ12 carries both of the A. aeolicus tatA genes, with
just TatA2 supplied with the C-terminal histag. The genes
were amplified using primers GCGCGCATGCACTTTCCTCTGCCGTGGC and GC GCAGATCTAGCCTCTACCTTTTCCTTCTC, the product digested with SphI and
BglII, and cloned into similarly digested pQE70.
All clones obtained from PCR amplified DNA were
sequenced to ensure that no mutations (other than sitespecific mutations) had been introduced.

ized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Peptide antibodies to the S. coelicolor TatA
protein were raised in rabbits, using a peptide of amino
acid sequence CTSSRPVTEPTDTTKR, by Davids biotechnology (Regensburg, Germany). Antibodies to E. coli TatA
have been described previously [39], the anti-pentahis
antibody was obtained from Qiagen. Subcellular fractions
for TMAO reductase activity measurements were prepared
from small (30 ml) cultures using the cold osmotic shock
protocol [55]. TMAO:benzyl viologen oxidoreductase
activity was measured as described previously [56]. Protein concentrations were estimated according to the
method of Lowry et al. [57]. Preparation of membrane
fractions was as described previously [6].
