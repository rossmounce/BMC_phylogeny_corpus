Abstract
Background: WRKY proteins are newly identified transcription factors involved in many plant
processes including plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. To date, genes encoding WRKY
proteins have been identified only from plants. Comprehensive search for WRKY genes in nonplant organisms and phylogenetic analysis would provide invaluable information about the origin
and expansion of the WRKY family.
Results: We searched all publicly available sequence data for WRKY genes. A single copy of the
WRKY gene encoding two WRKY domains was identified from Giardia lamblia, a primitive
eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum, a slime mold closely related to the lineage of animals and fungi,
and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an early branching of plants. This ancestral WRKY
gene seems to have duplicated many times during the evolution of plants, resulting in a large family
in evolutionarily advanced flowering plants. In rice, the WRKY gene family consists of over 100
members. Analyses suggest that the C-terminal domain of the two-WRKY-domain encoding gene
appears to be the ancestor of the single-WRKY-domain encoding genes, and that the WRKY
domains may be phylogenetically classified into five groups. We propose a model to explain the
WRKY family's origin in eukaryotes and expansion in plants.
Conclusions: WRKY genes seem to have originated in early eukaryotes and greatly expanded in
plants. The elucidation of the evolution and duplicative expansion of the WRKY genes should
provide valuable information on their functions.

Background
Transcriptional control is a major mechanism whereby a
cell or organism regulates its gene expression. Sequencespecific DNA-binding transcription regulators, one class
of transcription factors [1], play an essential role in modulating the rate of transcription of specific target genes. In
this way, they direct the temporal and spatial expressions
necessary for normal development and proper response to
physiological or environmental stimuli. Comparative
genome analysis reveals that genes for transcription regu-

lators are abundantly present in plant and animal
genomes, and the evolution and diversity of eukaryotes
seem to be related to the expansion of lineage-specific
transcription regulator families [2].
WRKY proteins are recently identified transcriptional regulators comprising a large gene family [3]. The first cDNA
encoding a WRKY protein, SPF1, was cloned from sweet
potato (Ipomoea batatas) [4]. Numerous genes for WRKY
proteins have since been experimentally identified from

more than 10 other plant species, including Arabidopsis
thaliana [5,6], wild oats (Avena fatua) [7], orchardgrass
(Dactylis glomerata) [8], barley (Hordeum vulgare) [9],
tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) [10-13], chamomile(Matricaria chamomilla) [14], rice (Oryza sativa) [9,15], parsley
(Petroselinum crispum) [16,17], a desert legume (Retama
raetam) [18], sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid cultivar) [19],
bittersweet nightshade (Solanum dulcamara) [20], potato
(Solanum tuberosum) [21,22], and wheat (Triticum aestivum) [9]. In addition, over 70 WRKY genes were identified
in the Arabidopsis genome by sequence similarity comparisons [2,23]. To date, WRKY genes have not been
cloned from species other than plants. The absence of
WRKY homologues in the genomes of animals
(Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) and
yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [2] leads to the suggestion
that WRKY transcription regulators are restricted to the
plant kingdom [2,3]. As genome sequence data for species
representing several major eukaryotic lineages are now
available, we can re-examine whether WRKY genes are
plant-specific or have ancestors predating the appearance
of plants.
The WRKY family proteins contain one or two highly conserved WRKY domains characterized by the hallmark heptapeptide WRKYGQK and a zinc-finger structure distinct
from other known zinc-finger motifs [3]. To regulate gene
expression, the WRKY domain binds to the W box in the
promoter of the target gene to modulate transcription
[5,7,16,24]. In addition to the W box, a recent study indicates that the WRKY domain can also bind to SURE, a
sugar responsive cis element, as a transcription activator
[9].
In plants, many WRKY proteins are involved in the
defense against attack from pathogenic bacteria
[6,22,23,25-27], fungi [26], viruses [12,26,28], and
oomycetes [21,26,29]. Further, WRKY genes are implicated in responses to the abiotic stresses of wounding
[11,30], the combination of drought and heat [31], and
cold [18,20]. It is also evident that some members of the
family may play important regulatory roles in morphogenesis of trichomes [32] and embryos [8], senescence
[26,33-35], dormancy [18], plant growth [27], and metabolic pathways [7,9,32,36].
Based on the number of WRKY domains and the pattern
of the zinc-finger motif, Eulgem et al. [3] classified members of the WRKY superfamily from the Arabidopsis
genome into three groups. Members of Group 1 typically
contain two WRKY domains, while most proteins with
one WRKY domain belong to Group 2. Group 3 proteins
also have a single WRKY domain, but the pattern of the
zinc-finger motif is unique. Eulgem et al. [3] further

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/1

divided Group 2 into five subgroups, according to the
phylogenetic analysis of the WRKY domains.
Given the large family of WRKY genes with divergent regulatory functions in important plant processes, it would
be desirable to understand the evolutionary origin and
gene duplications leading to the multi-member WRKY
family. The clarification of the phylogenetic relationships
among WRKY genes in model plants will also assist understanding of the functions of these genes in important
crops. We have comprehensively searched all currently
available sequence data for the existence of WRKY genes
outside the plant kingdom. Homologues of WRKY genes
are found from two eukaryotic species: Giardia lamblia, a
primitive protozoan, and Dictyostelium discoideum, a slime
mold. The data indicate an early origin of WRKY genes in
eukaryota and tremendous gene amplifications in the
plant lineage. We then cataloged the WRKY genes from
the rice genome and compared them with Arabidopsis
WRKY genes. We also identified WRKY genes from
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and EST-assembled
sequence contigs from nineteen plant species. The result
suggests that WRKY gene duplication events correlate with
the increasing structural and functional complexities in
land plants. We propose a model for the evolution of
WRKY genes.

Results
WRKY genes in non-plant eukaryotes
We searched for WRKY genes in two comprehensive datasets, GenBank's non-redundant (nr) and dbEST of all species. Together these datasets contain over 13 million
sequence records from more than 110,000 organisms
[37]. Homologues of WRKY proteins are not found in the
superkingdoms of archaea and eubacteria. In eukaryotes,
no WRKY genes are identified from the lineages of fungi
and animals.

Interestingly, two WRKY homologues were identified
from non-plant eukaryotic species, and both have two
WRKY domains [see Additional files 1 and 2]. The first
protein (GenBank accession: EAA40901) is encoded by an
intronless gene in the draft genome sequence of Giardia
lamblia [38]. The unicellular protist Giardia is one of the
most primitive organisms that represent the earliest
branching among extant eukaryotes [39,40]. The second
(accession AAO52331) is encoded by the genomic
sequence of chromosome 2 of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum [41]. The genomic sequence for the WRKY
domains were assembled from sequences generated from
three libraries prepared by two groups [42], indicating
that it is not from sequence contamination. The gene contains an intron, which interrupts the coding region
between the two WRKY domains. For this species, about
150,000 EST sequences are currently available in

GenBank. One EST (accession AU033476) aligns to the
WRKY gene, indicating that the gene is expressed. D. discoideum belongs to the Mycetozoa, a lineage more closely
related to animals and fungi than to green plants [41,43].
A WRKY gene in a green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga with
a cell wall. It also has chloroplasts for photosynthesis. The
evolutionary position of the species is located before the
divergence of land plants [44,45]. The release 1.0 of its
genome sequence has approximately 9 × whole genome
shotgun coverage [46]. Since the gene annotation for the
release is still at a preliminary stage, we predicted WRKY
genes from the genome sequence (see Methods). The
sequence similarity search between the genome sequence
and Pfam's WRKY domain sequences indicated that the
sequence 'Scaffold_1387' may encode WRKY domains.
This sequence was then used for further WRKY domain
and gene predictions. Despite minor differences in the
gene structure prediction, both gene prediction programs
FGENESH and GENSCAN agree on the major features of
the protein, including the presence of two WRKY domains
[see Additional files 1 and 2]. Moreover, the predicted
peptide sequence of the WRKY domains is identical
among all the gene and domain predictions. Sequence
alignment by blastn indicates that six ESTs are from the
predicted coding regions of the gene; the GenBank accessions for these ESTs are BI727288, AW772895,
BM000804, BG846749, BE121978 and BQ821537.
A catalog of WRKY genes in rice
Rice, one of the most important crops for world agriculture, is recognized as a model monocot for the study of
cereal crop genomes. A comprehensive catalog of rice
WRKY genes would provide a basis for investigating the
evolutionary patterns of the gene family and for transferring knowledge of the functions of these transcription factors from Arabidopsis to rice and from rice to other cereal
crops.

We identified the members of the WRKY family in rice
(Japonica variety) from its published genome sequence
[47]. The WRKY gene identification procedure employed
in this study (see Methods) was first tested with the Arabidopsis genome sequence. The procedure successfully
identified all reported Arabidopsis WRKY genes [3,23].
The rice genome seems to encode 109 WRKY proteins,
four of which have incomplete WRKY domains. The
remaining 105 proteins with complete WRKY domains,
listed in Additional file 3, were used for further analysis.
The multiple sequence alignment of WRKY domains from
rice, Arabidopsis, the green alga, the slime mold and Giardia lamblia, and the conserved WRKY domain patterns
can be found in Additional file 2. Some rice genes encode
identical WRKY domains. For example, OsWRKY34 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/1

OsWRKY57 share identical amino acid sequences in the
WRKY domains, but the nucleotide sequences for the
domains are not identical and they are located in different
chromosomes (1 and 4, respectively), indicating that they
are distinct genes. Similarly, OsWRKY8 located in Chromosome 6 and OsWRKY76 located in Chromosome 2
also represent two genes. The following genes in parenthesis share the identical WRKY domains and have a high
identity of the corresponding coding nucleotide
sequences: (OsWRKY9, 101), (12, 98 and 99), (21, 97),
(29, 96), (39, 105), (51, 103), (73, 104), (80, 102), and
(82, 100). These highly similar genes may represent newly
duplicated paralogues. The 105 genes are unevenly distributed in the 12 chromosomes, ranging from 25 genes
(the highest number) in Chromosome 1 to two genes (the
lowest) in Chromosome 10. Sequence alignment indicates that 60 WRKY genes have one or more matched rice
ESTs from the dbEST database (data not shown). Out of
the 105 proteins, 13 have two WRKY domains. We
assigned the WRKY domains into subfamilies using phylogenetic analysis with already classified AtWRKY genes
from A. thaliana [3] as the reference. Eleven proteins with
two WRKY domains are assigned to Group 1 because their
C-terminal domains belong to this group. Since the Nand C-terminal domains form distinct clusters, we designated the two domains as 1N and 1C, respectively. Six
proteins with a single domain also belonged to Group 1.
While OsWRKY15, 16, 73 and 104 have a single domain
homologous to Group 1N, OsWRKY13 and 91 contain a
single Group 1C domain. Interestingly, both N- and Cdomains of the other two double-domain-containing proteins (OsWRKY66 and 67) are always clustered with
Group 3 domains. Thirty-five single WRKY domain proteins are also assigned to this group. All together, there are
39 domains or 37 proteins in Group 3. We assigned 49
proteins to three new groups, Group 2_a + 2_b (13),
Group 2_c (18), and Group 2_d + 2_e (18). These new
groups are reorganized from the five subgroups IIa
through IIe in Eulgem et al. [3] (see details of the classification in Discussion). Domains of OsWRKY 25 and 95
cannot be consistently classified and therefore remain
unassigned [see Additional file 3].
Interestingly, several variant patterns of the WRKY
domains exist in the rice WRKY proteins. Although the
WRKYGQK peptide is highly conserved, nine variants
with one or two amino acids substituted are observed in
19 domains, most of which belong to Groups 3 and 2_c
(Table 1). While WRKYGEK and WRKYGKK are two common variants shared by seven (all in Group 3) and five (all
in Group 2_c) domains, respectively, each of the other
seven different heptapeptides occurs in only one protein.
The WRKY domains also contain patterns of zinc-finger
motifs that have not been reported in the literature (Table
1). No variants are found in domains of Groups 1C and

2_a + 2_b. The WRKY genes encoding the variant domain
patterns might be functional, because 10 genes with a
total of seven heptapeptide variants and two zinc-finger
motif variants have sequenced ESTs, although the DNA
binding capacity may be reduced [48]. Furthermore, ESTs
have been sequenced from the gene regions for the variants of WRKYGEK, WRKYGKK, WKKYGQK and
C_X6_C_X28_H_X1_C, indicating that these patterns are
not artifacts of the gene prediction (Table 1).
Survey of WRKY genes in land plants
Since the genomes of rice and Arabidopsis have numerous
WRKY genes whereas the green alga may have only a single copy, it would be interesting to investigate the gene
duplication events of WRKY family during the course of
evolution from unicellular plant organisms to flowering
plants and the relationship between expansion of the
WRKY family and the increased structural and functional
complexities of the higher plants. Ideally, the complete set
of WRKY genes should be identified from species representing different branches on the evolutionary tree of

plants for further analysis. Unfortunately, genome
sequence is currently not available for most plant species.
However, a large number of EST sequences for many
plants are publicly available and can be used to roughly
estimate the minimum number of WRKY genes in these
species.
We first surveyed GenBank's dbEST set and found that
WRKY genes are widespread in land plants, as over 40 species have expressed WRKY genes (data not shown). We
then estimated the number of unique WRKY genes for 17
species using their Gene Indices, which are assembled EST
sequence contigs with the minimal redundancy, provided
by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) [49]. The
analysis also included ESTs for the moss Physcomitrella patens and the fern Ceratopteris richardii whose Gene Indices
are not available [see Additional file 4]. For the EST set,
redundant ESTs for WRKY proteins were manually
removed. Together these 19 species represent different
branches on the evolutionary tree of the land plants.
While the moss Physcomitrella is an early diverged land

plant, the fern is an ancient vascular plant. The conifer
Pinus represents the gymnosperm lineage, and the remaining are the evolutionarily more advanced flowering plants
[50].
ESTs encoding WRKY proteins were identified in all the 19
species. Moreover, multiple WRKY genes are represented
in the EST or contig sets for most plants including the
moss and pine, with the most WRKY genes (109) from
soybean [see Additional file 4]. Although the actual
number of WRKY genes encoded in a plant genome can
only be known using the genome sequence, EST datasets
are useful to estimate the relative size of WRKY family in
plant species whose genome sequences are not available,
given sufficient large EST sets sampled from the genomes.
If a set of ≥ 50,000 ESTs is considered a large sample, then
pine, moss and 12 flowering plants listed in Additional
file 4 have enough ESTs for the estimation. The comparison of the number of WRKY genes identified from EST sets
with comparable size suggests that the genomes of moss
and pine seem to encode much fewer WRKY genes than
evolutionarily advanced flower plants. We also compared
pine with Arabidopsis in another analysis using ESTs from
GenBank's dbEST database (as of 10/28/2002). We identified ESTs for 46 Arabidopsis WRKY genes but only two
pine WRKY genes, although Arabidopsis' EST set
(176,915) is less than three times bigger than pine's
(60,226).
The abundance of WRKY ESTs in the total EST set is lower
for pine, fern and moss than for flowering plants, as the
percentage of WRKY ESTs in the total EST set for the three
non-flowering plants is among the lowest [see Additional
file 4]. The WRKY EST abundance in an EST dataset may
be affected by the number of WRKY genes in the species
and by the expression levels of WRKY genes in the cells
from which ESTs were obtained. For example, WRKY EST
abundance for pine is much lower than that for tomato
(0.0086% : 0.3546%, or ~ 1 : 40). The low WRKY EST
abundance of pine may be partly due to fewer WRKY
genes from pine than from tomato (4 : 51, or ~ 1 : 13) [see
Additional file 4]. It is also possible that pine WRKY genes
are lowly expressed. For example, for a tomato WRKY gene
the average EST count is > 10, but for pine it is < 2.
The identified WRKY genes were phylogenetically classified into five groups [see Additional file 4]. In six WRKY
genes identified from the moss ESTs, two are homologous
to Group 2_c and three belong to Group 2_d + 2_e, indicating an early origin of these groups in land plants. In
comparison, genes in Group 3 are only identified in the
EST sets of flowering plants but not from EST data of more
ancient plants, i.e., moss, fern and pine [see Additional
file 4].

Phylogeny of the WRKY domains
To examine the evolutionary relationships among the
WRKY domains, we estimated the phylogeny by using the
neighbor-joining program from PHYLIP 3.57 for the
amino acid sequences of WRKY domains from G. lamblia,
the slime mold, the green alga, Arabidopsis and rice. The
phylogenetic relationships were also inferred with the
programs of the least squares and parsimony from PAUP
4.0 for the corresponding nucleotide sequences. We also
did the same analysis for the rice dataset alone. The topology of trees obtained from these analyses is essentially the
same, and the neighbor-joining tree is shown in Figure 1.
Group 2 domains designated by Eulgem et al. [3] are not
monophyletic, but form three distinct clades. These
include: 2_a + 2_b, 2_c, and 2_d + 2_e. Moreover, Group
2_a + 2_b and Group 2_c are closely related to Group 1C
domains, while Group 3 is clustered with Group 2_d +
2_e. In addition, the rice and Arabidopsis WRKY trees (not
shown) consistently clustered WRKY1N domains as a
monophyletic subtree and all other domains as a natural
clade, supporting the suggestion that Groups 2 and 3
domains are more closely related to the C-terminal
domains of Group 1 genes than to the N-terminal
domains [3].

In flowering plants, genes encoding WRKY domains
appear to have been duplicated independently in monocots and dicots. For Group 3 domains, three subsets each
of which consists of five or more members only from rice
can be distinguished from the phylogram shown in Figure
2. Similarly, six members of WRKY domains, all from Arabidopsis, are clustered together. Independent domain
clusters of either species are also found in other WRKY
subfamilies (data not shown). These results suggest that
numerous duplications and diversifications for WRKY
genes, particularly Group 3 genes, have occurred after the
divergence of the monocots and dicots. Indeed, all rice
WRKY domains with the sequence WRKYGEK (Table 1)
are classified as a sub-cluster of the largest rice domain
cluster in Group 3 (Figure 2), implying that multiple
duplication events led to this large cluster in rice.

Discussion
WRKY genes seem to be an innovation in eukaryota after
the divergence of eubacteria – archaea – eukaryota. In
eukaryotes, the WRKY genes are present in the green
plants as well as in the ancient eukaryote G. lamblia and
the mycetozoan D. discoideum, but not in fungi and animals. G. lamblia is a primitive unicellular eukaryote
diverged ~ 1,500 million years ago (mya) [51]. Originally
thought as plant-specific [2,3], the WRKY transcription
factors therefore seem to have an early origin in
eukaryotes. As the mycetozoa is closely related to the
fungi-animal clade [41,43], the WRKY gene(s) may have
been lost prior to the divergence of fungi and animals, but

Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the WRKY domains
Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the WRKY domains. The tree was reconstructed from the amino acid sequences using
the neighbor-joining program from Phylip 3.57. Clades of WRKY domains are labelled according to the classifications of
AtWRKY domains by Eulgem et al [3] who proposed three groups and five subgroups in Group 2 (a, b, c, d and e). We suggest
classifying WRKY domains into five groups modified from the old system. While Groups 1 and 3 are unchanged, the original
subgroup 2_c is promoted to Group 2_c. Subgroups 2_a and 2_b, and subgroups 2_d and 2_e are combined to form two new
groups, 2_a + 2_b, and 2_d + 2_e, respectively (see text for details). WRKY domains from G. lamblia are represented by thick
and dark-green branches; the slime mold, thick and cyan; the green alga, thick and magenta; Arabidopsis, thin and blue; and rice,
thin and red.

after the split of the slime mold and fungi-animal
lineages.
Based on the current data, we propose a model for the origin and evolution of the WRKY factor family (Figure 3).
First, the ancestor of the descendant WRKY genes found in
G. lamblia, the slime mold and the green alga seems to be
a Group 1 gene encoding two WRKY domains. The conservation of the C- and N-terminal domains suggests that
they are derived from a single domain by domain duplication. Therefore we hypothesize that the earliest WRKY
factor had one WRKY domain and the gene was innovated
post the first appearance of eukaryotes ~ 2,500 mya [52]
but prior to the divergence leading to Giardia protist, ~
1,500 mya. Second, our data and the previous results by
Eulgem et al. [3] suggest that the WRKY domains of

groups 2_a + 2_b, 2_c, 2_d + 2_e and 3 are evolutionarily
close to the WRKY1C domain. It seems that Group 1 genes
which contain only the C-terminal WRKY domain are
ancestors of the descendant WRKY genes in other groups.
The N-terminal domain in Group 1 genes may have been
lost prior to the gene duplication. As the green alga may
have only one WRKY gene which belongs to Group 1, the
duplications and diversifications leading to other groups
in plants probably occurred some time after the divergence of chlorophytes and streptophytes, ~ 800 mya [53].
Third, the domain structure conservation [see Additional
file 2] and the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1) suggest
that the three distinct subsets, Groups 2_a + 2_b, 2c, 2_d
+ 2_e, may be independently evolved from the Group 1
genes which have only the C-terminal domain. In addition, Group 3 genes appear to share a common ancestor

Model of the origin and duplications of WRKY gene family
Model of the origin and duplications of WRKY gene family. The phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes using the archaea as
the outgroup is modified from Baldauf and Doolittle [43] and Kenrick and Crane [50]. The solid lines correspond to branches
where WRKY homologues are identified, while the thickness of the line represents the relative size of WRKY family for the
branch, from the thinnest for one copy in Giardia, the slime mold and the green alga to the thickest for over 100 copies in rice.
The broken lines represent branches where WRKY genes are not present or have not been identified. The WRKY gene is
symbolized by the box for the WRKY domain and the lines for sequences around the domain. The text in the box indicates the
group the WRKY domain belongs to (1, Group 1; 1N and 1C, N- and C-terminal domains of Group 1 proteins; a + b: Group
2_a + 2_b; c: Group 2_c; d + e, Group 2_d + 2_e; 3: Group 3). The major gene duplications and diversifications are shown
above the branch. The number shown below the branch is the divergence time (million years ago) of its children branches. The
branch length is not scaled to the evolutionary distance.

with the clade 2_d + 2_e. The identification of 2_c and 2_d
+ 2_e genes in the moss EST data [see Additional file 4]
suggests that the duplications of the genes in these groups
predate the diversification of bryophytes, ~ 420 mya [50].
Although the WRKY genes in Group 2_a + 2_b and Group
3 are identified only from flowering plants in the current
data, the origin of these genes seems to have occurred
prior to the divergence of monocots and dicots, because
the characteristic features of the WRKY domains in Group
3 are highly conserved in Arabidopsis and rice. In addition, multiple copies of Group 3 genes may exist in the
common ancestor of monocots and dicots, since clusters
with nested Arabidopsis and rice sequences are found in
the group (Figure 2).
The classification of the WRKY family in Arabidopsis by
Eulgem et al. [3] is not completely based on phylogenetic
analysis and therefore does not necessarily reflect the evolutionary relationships among the groups. This is even
apparent for the tree of AtWRKY genes built by the authors
(see their Figure 3). For example, their Group 2 is not
monophyletic, but seems to have several ancestors. Obvi-

ously it is necessary to implement a new classification
scheme for the WRKY family to reflect the evolution of the
WRKY domains. Based on phylogenetic analysis (Figure
1), conserved domain structures and intron positions of
the WRKY domains [see Additional file 2, B], we suggest a
new classification system modified from Eulgem et al. [3].
Instead of three groups and five subgroups under Group 2
in their classifications, genes are reorganized into five
independent groups according to the phylogeny of their
WRKY domains, i.e., Group 1, Group 2_a + 2_b, Group
2_c, Group 2_d + 2_e, and Group 3. The relationship
between the modified system and the original of Eulgem
et al. [3] is as follows. Groups 1 and 3 are unchanged,
while Group 2_c corresponds to the subgroup c of the old
Group 2. The original subgroups a and b, and d and e in
the old Group 2 are combined to become two new groups,
2_a + 2_b, and 2_d + 2_e, respectively.
Our evolutionary analysis of WRKY transcription factors
in this study may be important to the understanding of
the overall mechanisms of biodiversity in the plant kingdom and the particular functions WRKY genes play in

plant regulatory networks. First, the comparative analysis
of WRKY factors in lower and higher plants indicates that
the WRKY family expands as plants evolve from simpler,
unicellular to more complex, multicellular forms. Since
WRKY genes seem to play important regulatory roles in
plants under abiotic and biotic stresses, and flowering
plants which have the largest WRKY family are dominant
over non-flowering plants in their distribution on the
earth, WRKY genes might be essential for much of the
enhanced adaptability of flowering plants to the environment. In comparison with pine, fern and moss, WRKY
ESTs of flowering plants seem to be over-represented [see
Additional file 4], suggesting that the normal functions of
flowering plants might depend to a greater extent on the
regulatory roles of these transcription factors. It would be
interesting to analyze the functions of genes in Group 3, a
greatly amplified group in monocots which are most
advanced in evolution and most successful in adaptability. Second, the pairs of Arabidopsis WRKY genes,
AtWRKY3 and 4, 8 and 28, 11 and 17, 14 and 35, 18 and
60, 24 and 56, and 38 and 62 share similar expression patterns in response to pathogen inoculation and salicylic
acid treatment [23]. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that
these pairs of genes are clustered together with high bootstrap value support (data not shown). Thus, the newly
duplicated WRKY genes may overlap in functions to better
protect the cell or organism from deleterious effects
caused by gene mutation or deletion. Moreover, a number
of WRKY genes from different phylogenetic groups may
be activated by the same physiological or environmental
stimulus, such as bacterial pathogen attack [6,25,27,54],
viral pathogen attack [23], wounding [30], or senescence
[33-35]. The WRKY genes are possibly involved in multiple pathways leading to an array of physiological
responses. Nevertheless, the elucidation of the evolution
and duplicative expansion of the WRKY genes should provide valuable information on their functions.

Conclusions
Originally believed to be plant-specific, WRKY transcription factor family has an early origin in eukaryotes and is
also present in a slime mold which is more closely related
to the lineage of fungi-animals than to plants. WRKY
genes have been duplicated many times during evolution
in plants, resulting in a large gene family for WRKY proteins in flowering plants. The elucidation of the evolutionary pathway of WRKY family and a new classification
system we proposed based on phylogenetic analysis, conserved WRKY domain structures and intron positions
should assist the functional characterization of WRKY
genes.

Methods
Datasets
The annotated genome sequences of rice (Oryza sativa spp.
japonica) (OSA1, released on 7/27/2003) and Arabidopsis
(ATH1, released on 4/17/2003) were downloaded from
TIGR [55]. OSA1 and ATH1 include nucleotide sequences
of genes, mRNA and coding regions, peptide sequences,
and the gene structure information such as the start and
end of the exons in a gene. For the green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the genome sequence release
1.0 on 2/4/2003 was used [56]. We also downloaded Giardia lamblia genome sequence released on 1/1/2003 [57].
GenBank's Non-Redundant (nr), dbEST and taxonomy
datasets were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [58]. TIGR's Gene Indices
for plant species [see Additional file 4] and the slime mold
Dictyostelium discoideum were downloaded from TIGR
[59]. These Gene Indices represent non-redundant gene
transcripts assembled from publicly available ESTs and
annotated sequences [49]. Pfam's WRKY domain
sequences (WRKY-seed) were also downloaded [60].
WRKY gene identification
We searched 'nr' and dbEST datasets for WRKY genes in
species outside the plant phyla. The dbEST dataset was
also used to survey the expressed WRKY genes in plant
species. We aligned the sequences in the datasets with
WRKY-seed using BLAST programs [61]. To determine the
taxonomical distribution of WRKY genes from the BLAST
output, we constructed a database where the BLAST
results, the subject sequences and their associated taxonomy information from NCBI [58] were stored. The significant hits (E < 10-4) were parsed and manually checked for
the presence of the characteristic features of the WRKY
domain.

To systemically catalog the WRKY genes for rice and G.
lamblia, we searched their genome sequences with blastp
and PSI-BLAST [61] using WRKY-seed as the query. For
PSI-BLAST, we used the default settings for three iterations. We also searched for WRKY genes with HMMER
using the global profile of the WRKY domain [60].
HMMER, a sequence analysis tool based on profile Hidden Markov models [62], is available at [63]. The search
results with the threshold of E < 10-4 for blastp and PSIBLAST and E < 0.1 for HMMER were manually compared
to remove non-WRKY hits. We also used the same strategy
to identify the set of WRKY genes from the Arabidopsis
genome.
To identify WRKY genes from the green alga, we first
BLASTed its genome sequence against the WRKY-seed.
The significantly aligned sequences (E < 10-4) were then
subject to WRKY domain and gene predictions. The WRKY
domain was predicted with the Pfam's DNA SEARCH

[64], a web-interface backed by the GeneWise algorithm
[65]. The WRKY gene was predicted by FGENESH using
the profile for monocots [66,67] and GENSCAN using the
profile for maize [68,69].
We also searched ESTs and EST-assembled contigs for the
identified WRKY genes of rice, the green alga, G. lamblia
and the slime mold, using blastn. An EST- or contig-hit
was accepted if the identity of the alignment was > 96%
for > 400 aligned nucleotides (nt), > 97% for 300 ~ 399
nt, > 98% for 200 ~ 299 nt, > 99% for 100 ~ 199 nt, and
= 100% for 50 ~ 99 nt. The alignment with < 50 nt was
discarded.
Analysis of WRKY genes
The WRKY domain boundary was defined as by Eulgem et
al. [3]. The peptide sequences of the domains were aligned
with ClustalX (v1.81, with default settings) [70] and the
alignment was adjusted based on the conserved features
of the WRKY domains. The results were then used to guide
the alignment of the corresponding nucleotide sequences.
The neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in PHYLIP
3.573c [71] for amino acid sequences with the pairwise
distance computed under the PAM model, and the least
square fit and most parsimony algorithms in PAUP*
4.0b10 [72] for nucleotide sequences were used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.
