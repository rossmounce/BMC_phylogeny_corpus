TECHNICAL NOTE

The Supertree Tool Kit
Technical Note

Katie E Davis*1 and Jon Hill2

Abstract
Background: Large phylogenies are crucial for many areas of biological research. One method of creating such large
phylogenies is the supertree method, but creating supertrees containing thousands of taxa, and hence providing a
comprehensive phylogeny, requires hundred or even thousands of source input trees. Managing and processing these
data in a systematic and error-free manner is challenging and will become even more so as supertrees contain ever
increasing numbers of taxa. Protocols for processing input source phylogenies have been proposed to ensure data
quality, but no robust software implementations of these protocols as yet exist.
Findings: The aim of the Supertree Tool Kit (STK) is to aid in the collection, storage and processing of input source trees
for use in supertree analysis. It is therefore invaluable when creating supertrees containing thousands of taxa and
hundreds of source trees. The STK is a Perl module with executable scripts to carry out various steps in the processing
protocols. In order to aid processing we have added meta-data, via XML, to each tree which contains information such
as the bibliographic source information for the tree and how the data were derived, for instance the character data
used to carry out the original analysis. These data are essential parts of previously proposed protocols.
Conclusions: The STK is a bioinformatics tool designed to make it easier to process source phylogenies for inclusion in
supertree analysis from hundreds or thousands of input source trees, whilst reducing potential errors and enabling
easy sharing of such datasets. It has been successfully used to create the largest known supertree to date containing
over 5000 taxa from over 700 source phylogenies.
Findings
Background

A supertree is defined as an estimate of phylogeny assembled from smaller phylogenies. These partial phylogenies
(or source trees) must have some taxa in common, but
not necessarily all [1]. Modern supertrees can contain
hundreds or thousands of taxa and are constructed from
hundreds of source phylogenies requiring the collection
of large amounts of data [2-4]. These phylogenies are of
great use in, for example, comparative biology [5], and
macroevolutionary studies [6]. Source phylogenies for
supertree construction are typically stored in NEXUS
files [7], which contain the phylogenetic relationships
between the taxa included in the source study. Collecting,
storing and processing this volume of data becomes an
arduous and error-prone task as the number of NEXUS
files increases. One cannot simply collect a few hundred
source phylogenies and use these as published to create a

supertree. Criticisms of supertrees have arisen for a variety of reasons, both practical and philosophical. Data
quality is the main practical issue [8] and is the main consideration of the Supertree Tool Kit, as the results from
any supertree analysis can only be as good as the input
data [9]. In order to minimise potential sources of bias on
supertree construction a clear, rigorous, transparent
method of processing and assessing the source phylogenies is required.
Previous work in this area has proposed two protocols
to carry out this processing [2,9]. The Supertree Tool Kit
(STK) is designed to implement the latter protocol of
Davis [2], based on that of Bininda-Emonds et al. [9] and
has been used successfully in the construction of two
large supertrees at this time, containing 436 [3] and 5276
taxa [2]. The protocol implemented briefly consists of the
following steps:
1. Data collection and entry: Collecting data from
the literature and encoding printed trees as NEXUSformatted tree files. Meta-data about the source phylogeny is stored in a corresponding XML file.

2. Standardisation of terminal taxa: Removal of
synonyms, vernacular names and subspecies. Standardisation of taxonomic level.
3. Source tree independence: Remove redundancy
within the dataset that would otherwise unfairly upweight data. Here, non-independence is defined as
two or more studies that use the same character data
and have identical taxa or two or more studies that
use the same character data and where one taxa set is
a subset of the other. This is not a standard definition
of independence and has no statistical meaning, but is
the only practicable definition that can be applied to
supertree studies. It is important to recognise that
according to other definitions there may be some
issues of data overlap remaining even if the above
conditions are met.
4. Check adequate taxonomic overlap of source
trees: Ensure that there is adequate taxonomic overlap between source phylogenies, in other words all
source phylogenies must fulfill the basic requirement
for supertree construction of each source (rooted)
phylogeny has at least two taxa in common with one
other (rooted) phylogeny [1]
5. Matrix creation: Create a matrix suitable for analysis in PAUP* [10], TNT [11] or similar, if required.
Previous work

There are no published software tools of this kind - the
STK is unique in this respect. Previous work has been on
ad-hoc scripts that automate a single part of suggested
protocols, for example "synonoTree" [9], or "SuperMR"
[12]. However, these are one-offs, which do not use standard NEXUS parsers for Perl and are not integrated into a
common framework. Of course, these two scripts alone
cannot be used to implement the whole protocol as proposed by Davis [2] or Bininda-Emonds et al. [9] and as
such represent a partial implementation at best. Some
tools that aid with the storage of NEXUS files do exist,
such as TreeBASE [13] which stores a large range of phylogenies alongside the meta-data containing information
on how the tree was originally constructed. However, this
meta-information is not readily available for download.
Implementation

The STK is written in Perl and consists of a Perl module
and a number of individual scripts. The main requirements of the STK are Bio::NEXUS, a Perl API for handling NEXUS files [14] and Perl (version 5 or greater),
with the addition of a few standard Perl modules. All
scripts are run from the command line. The executables
use the functionality of the Perl module and implement
the protocol outlined above. The Perl module can be used
as the basis for creating further executables.

Data Storage

The STK uses three data formats: NEXUS [7], XML and
taxa substitution files. The minimum data input for the
STK is a collection of NEXUS-formatted tree files [7].
These contain the taxa and the phylogenetic information
that is a minimum requirement for source data. However,
these files miss some crucial information that is required
to fully implement the data processing protocols outlined
above; namely the bibliographic and analytical information for each source tree. In order to store these data, we
use the second type of file: XML files, which are a metadata storage medium. XML defines data using "tags" and
"attributes". The STK XML format contains several such
tags. The XML files implemented by the STK contain
metadata about each source tree, such as bibliographic
information, i.e. authors, journal, year etc., included taxa,
and characters used and the algorithmic method used to
construct the source tree. This format was chosen, rather
than simply creating a document in Word or Excel as has
been done in some previous supertree studies e.g. [15], as
it is very easy to extract trees required for any specific
analysis, i.e. morphological or molecular data only by
parsing the XML. In addition, the combination of two
files to store the data enables "data integrity" checks to be
carried out throughout processing, which ensures that
the source data and associated meta-data stay in step during processing. The XML files are also an essential part of
some aspects of the data processing protocol. Checking
data independence, for example, requires knowledge of
what character data were used. The third type of file used
by the STK is the taxa substitution file. This file defines
which taxa are to be replaced. The substitution can be
empty (a removal of that taxon), a single taxon or multiple taxa as a polytomy.
taxon_1 = taxon_2
taxon_3 = taxon_4, taxon_5, taxon_6
taxon_7 =
The above taxa substitution file replaces taxon_1 with
taxon_2; taxon_3 with a polytomy of taxon_4, taxon_5
and taxon_6; and removes taxon_7.
Perl Module

The Perl module contains over 25 functions used by the
executables included in the STK. These provide functionality such as reading and writing NEXUS files, reading
and writing XML files, obtaining taxa lists, checking if a
taxa is included in a file, etc. These functions are the basis
of the executables which form the STK.
Executables

There are currently twelve individual application scripts
in the STK, each designed to carry out a single step
described above or to manipulate the data in some way
(Table 1). Below is a description of a few key scripts along
with examples of use. For more details see [16].

Check Data Check Data provides a veracity check for the
source data. The script performs three checks, depending
on the files that are contained in the dataset; one check
examines the NEXUS source phylogenies, the other two
checks require the inclusion of XML files. The first check
is to ensure that all source phylogenies contained in a
dataset are valid NEXUS files as defined by Bio::NEXUS
which contains approximately 80% of all known NEXUS
commands [14]. The second check ensures the validity of
the XML files in the dataset and that they contain a minimal amount of information, e.g. bibliographic information, a taxa list, and the characters used in the study.
Third, the XML and source phylogenies are checked to
ensure they contain the same taxa.
The check is started with a simple command:
perl stk_check_data.pl --dir ../path/
to/dataset
Any errors are displayed on the screen, which in this
example is a duplicate taxon in the NEXUS file:
perl stk_check_data.pl --dir ../path/
to/dataset
---------------------------------------------------------File: ../data/example.tre
Duplicate taxon: Margarops_fuscus
Check Overlap Check Overlap ensures that there is adequate taxonomic overlap between source phylogenies, in
other words all source phylogenies must fulfill the basic
requirement for supertree construction of each source
(rooted) phylogeny has at least two taxa in common with
one other (rooted) source phylogeny [1]. The default
options of this executable ensure that a group of source
phylogenies fulfill this requirement, but this can be
changed to an arbitrary number of taxa, allowing application of more stringent requirements. This script optionally produces a ".dot" file which can be visualised in
GraphViz [17]. Example output from GraphViz is shown
in figure 1.
The default options, where two taxa must overlap with
graphical output (figure 1a):
perl stk_check_data.pl --dir ../path/
to/dataset --graphic
To extend to more taxa (figure 1b):
perl stk_check_data.pl --nCluster = 4
--dir ../path/to/dataset -graphic
Replace Taxa This script enables replacement or deletion of taxa. The replacement could be a single taxon or
multiple taxa encoded as a polytomy. This replacement
can be carried out on a directory or a single file. In addition, the executable can read in a substitution file and
carry out multiple replacements or deletions simultaneously.
For example, to remove a taxon from the dataset:
perl stk_replace_taxa.pl --dir ../data
--old Xiphocolaptes_promeropirhynchus

checking for correct functionality and correct handling of
incorrect inputs. Whilst these tests do not ensure bugfree code, they do increase confidence that STK does not
contain major errors that would introduce errors into the
dataset during processing. Given the number of trees
contained in modern datasets, finding and correcting
such introduced errors would not be a trivial task.

Figure 1 Checking taxonomic overlap of source phylogenies. An
example of the output from stk_check_overlap. A) shows the source
trees represented by nodes with an edge drawn between them when
two taxa are shared between them. Tree 10 does not have sufficient
taxonomic overlap and should therefore be excluded. B) shows the
same set of source phylogenies, but with four taxa required as the minimum for taxonomic overlap. Now trees 10 and 18 should be excluded.
In addition, note that the number of edges connecting each node has
decreased accordingly.

To replace a taxa, for example to correct common misspellings:
perl stk_replace_taxa.pl --dir ../data
--old
Gallus_sonnerati
--new
Gallus_sonneratii
To use a substitution file to carry out multiple replacement and deletions:
perl stk_replace_taxa.pl --dir ../data
--taxa subs.txt
where the subs.txt _le is in the format described previously.
Search Data Search Data performs two functions: one is
to identify source phylogenies that contain certain data,
such as a particular taxon, use of a certain character, etc.
Second, the script can create a copy of the data that
match the search criteria. In other words, subsets of the
dataset can be created easily; e.g. those containing only
molecular data.
The following command can be used to create a version
of the dataset that contains only those source phylogenies
derived from the gene cytochrome b, and place that data
in a directory called "new data":
perl stk_search_data.pl --dir ../path/
to/data --charterm cytb --copy ../
new_data
Testing

As part of creating robust software, it is important that
the software is extensively tested [18]. The STK contains
two automated test suites: a unit test suite and a regression test suite. The unit tests exercises 100% (in terms
code statements, branches, and conditionals) of the STK
module, checking correct functionality, incorrect inputs
are handled correctly and that each function is documented. There are currently over 250 separate tests carried out. The regression tests exercise the scripts, again

Discussion
There are a number of software tools to construct and
analyse large phylogenies using supertree methods (see
[19] for a comprehensive list). However, there is a lack of
software available for processing data ready for analysis,
as most existing software concentrates on construction or
analysis of phylogenies. Given the importance of robust
data in supertree construction [2,9], it is important that
tools are created to implement processing protocols.
However, in order to implement processing protocols
meta-data is required in addition to the phylogenetic
information. The STK encourages the storage of metadata and the use of robust protocols for processing data
ready for supertree construction. Without a software tool
like the STK it is impossible to construct large phylogenies with thousands of taxa following rigorous, robust
protocols. We envision the STK to be used as a "processing-pipeline" where data is fed from one script into
another, carrying out each step of the protocols as
required or desired (figure 2).
Future work

Although the STK has currently been used successfully in
two projects [2,3], there are many useful features that
could be implemented. Proposed future features include
the addition of a Graphical User Interface to improve the
ease-of-use of the STK. We also intend to add revision
control which will provide a transparent way of maintaining a full processing log and allow an 'undo' facility to the
processing chain.
