Abstract
Background: Colletotrichum is one of the most widespread and important genus of plant pathogenic fungi
worldwide. Various species of Colletotrichum are the causative agents of anthracnose disease in plants, which is a
severe problem to agricultural crops particularly in Thailand. These phytopathogens are usually controlled using
chemicals; however, the use of these agents can lead to environmental pollution. Potential non-chemical control
strategies for anthracnose disease include the use of bacteria capable of producing anti-fungal compounds such as
actinomycetes spp., that comprise a large group of filamentous, Gram positive bacteria from soil. The aim of this
study was to isolate actinomycetes capable of inhibiting the growth of Colletotrichum spp, and to analyze the
diversity of actinomycetes from plant rhizospheric soil.
Results: A total of 304 actinomycetes were isolated and tested for their inhibitory activity against Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides strains DoA d0762 and DoA c1060 and Colletotrichum capsici strain DoA c1511 which cause
anthracnose disease as well as the non-pathogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain IFO 10217. Most isolates (222
out of 304, 73.0%) were active against at least one indicator fungus or yeast. Fifty four (17.8%) were active against
three anthracnose fungi and 17 (5.6%) could inhibit the growth of all three fungi and S. cerevisiae used in the test.
Detailed analysis on 30 selected isolates from an orchard at Chanthaburi using the comparison of 16S rRNA gene
sequences revealed that most of the isolates (87%) belong to the genus Streptomyces sp., while one each belongs
to Saccharopolyspora (strain SB-2) and Nocardiopsis (strain CM-2) and two to Nocardia (strains BP-3 and LK-1).
Strains LC-1, LC-4, JF-1, SC-1 and MG-1 exerted high inhibitory activity against all three anthracnose fungi and
yeast. In addition, the organic solvent extracts prepared from these five strains inhibited conidial growth of the
three indicator fungi. Preliminary analysis of crude extracts by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
indicated that the sample from strain JF-1 may contain a novel compound. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
this strain is closely related to Streptomyces cavurensis NRRL 2740 with 99.8% DNA homology of 16S rRNA gene
(500 bp).
Conclusion: The present study suggests that rhizospheric soil is an attractive source for the discovery of a large
number of actinomycetes with activity against Colletotrichum spp. An interesting strain (JF-1) with high inhibitory
activity has the potential to produce a new compound that may be useful in the control of Colletotrichum spp.

Background
Anthracnose disease caused by species of Colletotrichum
is one of the most economically important plant diseases and is responsible for reducing the marketable
yield of crop production (10% to 80% reduction) in
some developing countries such as Thailand, Pakistan,
Turkey and Mexico [1,2]. Colletotrichum spp. can cause
anthracnose disease in fruits such as avocado, guava,
papaya, mango and passion fruit [3]. Two significant
Colletotrichum species found in Thailand are C. capsici
and C. gloeosporioides and these same pathogens are
also the main phytopathogens in South America and
Asia, especially tropical regions of Asia [4]. C. capsici
generally infects mature fruit, while C.gloeosporioides
infects both green and mature fruits [4].
Although phytopathogens are usually suppressed using
synthetic chemicals, the excessive use of chemical control has led to environmental pollution. Moreover, the
efficiency of these pesticides is continually decreasing
due to the development of resistant pathogens. Over the
last 25-30 years, improvement of alternative control
methods, including the use of microorganisms, has been
undertaken [4]. Most biological controls are directed
toward wound pathogens and involve the use of antagonistic bacteria that produce antibiotics [5-7].
Actinomycetes, particularly Streptomyces species are
among the richest sources of antibiotics [8-10]. Roughly
60% of biologically active compounds that have been
developed for agricultural use originated from Streptomyces [11]. Various groups of bioactive compounds
such as macrolide, benzoquinones [12], aminoglycosides
[13,14], polyenes [15,16], and nucleoside antibiotics
[17,18] are examples of agriculturally useful metabolites
produced from Streptomyces.
In order to find bioactive compounds that may be
useful in the control of fungal pathogens, such as Colletotrichum spp., we isolated actinomycetes species and
screened them for antifungal activity. Of the actinomycetes isolated, 30 selected strains were also subjected to
phylogenetic analysis using comparison of their16S
rRNA gene sequences to investigate the diversity of actinomycetes in rhizospheric soil collected from orchards.
Results and Discussion
Isolation of actinomycetes

A total of 304 actinomycetes isolates were obtained from 39
rhizospheric soil samples collected from orchards in
Chanthaburi, Bangkok, Petchaburi, and Nongbualamphu
provinces. The collection areas included the eastern, central
and northeastern parts of Thailand. Rhizospheric soil was
selected for use in this study since rhizosphere-associated
soils can contain almost twice as many actinomycetes isolates as non-rhizosphere-associated soils, according to a
previous report by Crawford and co-workers [19].

Initially, isolated colonies had a smooth appearance
but later developed a weft of aerial mycelium that either
appeared floccose, granular, powdery or velvety as
described in Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology [20]. Colonies of actinomycetes, in particular
those of Streptomyces species, were picked on the basis
of their morphological characteristics on agar plates.
The Streptomyces colonies can be easily identified by
their opaque, rough, nonspreading morphology and are
usually embedded resulting in adherence to agar medium. The color of substrate and aerial mycelia was variable; however, almost any colony gave an earthy odor
that is characteristic of Streptomyces.
Antimicrobial activity of actinomycete isolates

Among the 304 actinomycetes isolates, 214 (70.4%), 110
(36.2%), 64 (21.1%), 42 (13.8%) displayed activity against
the growth of C. gloeosporioides strains DoA d0762 and
DoA c1060, C. capsici strain DoA c1511 and S. cerevisiae strain IFO 10217, respectively. Two hundred and
twenty two isolates (73.0%) were active against at least
one indicator microorganism. Inhibition toward
C. gloeosporioides strain DoA d0762 was shown by 214
isolates, and inhibition toward C. capsici strain DoA
c1511 was shown by 64 isolates. Fifty four strains
(17.8%) inhibited all of three fungi which caused
anthracnose disease. Only 17 isolates (5.6%) inhibited all
indicator fungi as well as yeast. The use of several indicator microorganisms helped to select strains with
potent activity [11,17]. Antifungal activity of the 304
actinomycete isolates is summarized in Table 1.
Molecular phylogeny of the 30 selected isolates based on
16S rRNA gene

To assess the actinobacterial diversity in rhizospheric soils
from orchards, 30 isolates from a Chanthaburi orchard
were selected for additional analysis. The orchard contains
several types of fruit trees including rambutan, jack fruit,
longkong, lychee, and salak. The orchard was selected due
to the variety of fruit trees since differences in tree and
fruit materials can affect diversity of the soil microbes
[21-23]. The nucleotide sequences for a section of the 16S
rRNA gene (500 bp) from the 30 selected strains (GenBank Accession numbers GU13002-GU130031) were subjected to BLASTN analysis using the NCBI database for
identification at the genus level. All 30 isolates contained
different nucleotide sequences for the 16S rRNA gene,
indicating that they were different strains (data not
shown). Of the actinomycetes tested 26 out of 30 strains
belonged to genus Streptomyces and contained between
95-100% DNA homology in the 16S rRNA gene. Two
strains (strains BP-3 and LK-1) had shown proximity to
genus Nocardia. Strains SB-2 and CM-2 belong to
genera Saccharopolyspora and Nocardiopsis, respectively

(Table 2). The prevalence of Streptomyces species over
other actinomycetes was likely due to screening conditions
(media and cultivation). Pridham and water proline agar
media used in this study are preferred by Streptomyces [24].
The results described above were supported by phylogenetic analysis based on the neighbor-joining tree. The 30
isolates were sorted into 4 main clusters with highest similarity to the genera Streptomyces, Saccharopolyspora,
Nocardia and Nocardiopsis, respectively (Figure 1). The

BP-3 and LK-1 isolates matched with high sequence identity to members of the Nocardia cyriacigeorgica clade,
while SB-2 and CM-2 isolates were closely related to Saccharopolysporaterberi R40 and Nocardiopsis sp. 94N10-1
clade members, respectively. Most of the selected isolates
(26 strains) were closely matched to Streptomyces spp.
Our results suggest that actinomycetes in plant rhizospheric soils from orchards are diverse and that these
strains are suitable for natural product screening.

Determination of antifungal activity of 5 potent
antagonistic Streptomyces strains

The bioassay results for the 30 selected actinomycetes
strains against the three pathogens and yeast identified
24 strains with antimicrobial potential especially against
C. gloeosporioides DoA d0762 (Table 2). Furthermore, 5
Streptomyces strains (LC-1, LC-4, JF-1, SC-1, and MG-1)
were found to be active against all indicator microorganisms (Table 2) and they were classified in distinct
branches from each other (Figure 1). A previous report
has indicated that taxonomically related strains might
have some similarity in their metabolic pathways though
certain strains were unique in their metabolic profiles
[25]. Therefore these five strains, which are clustered in
different groups, might produce different compounds
with antifungal properties.
These five Streptomyces isolates were also active
against conidial germination. As indicated in Table 3,
they had antagonistic activity against C. gloeosporioides
strains DoA d0762 and DoA c1060, and C. capsici strain
DoA c1511. A clear zone, indicating inhibition of
growth, ranging from 28-64 mm in diameter appeared
around the colonies of the five isolates against the
growth of C. gloeosporioides strain DoA d0762. Isolates
JF-1 and MG-1 showed strong inhibition against three
fungal strains with the inhibition zone ranging from 30
to 41 mm in diameter for C. gloeosporioides strain DoA
c1060 and C. capsici strain DoA c1511. JF-1 and MG-1
displayed even stronger activity against the C. gloeosporioides strain DoA d0762 with an inhibition zone of
greater than 60 mm in diameter.
The mechanism of antifungal antagonists can be due
to the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinase,
b,3 glucanase, chitosanase, and proteases [26] which
degrade the fungal cell wall, or the secretion of antifungal compounds [27]. Streptomyces spp. from rhizospheric soil can protect roots by inhibiting the
development of potential fungal pathogens; however, it

is not known whether the zone of inhibition, caused by
the five Streptomyces strains, we isolated occurs as a
result of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes or antifungal
metabolites or the combined action of both. To determine whether the 5 selected isolates (LC-1, LC-4, JF-1,
SC-1, and MG-1) with high antifungal activity produced
antifungal metabolites, crude extracts were prepared by
solvent extraction. Using a disk diffusion susceptibility
test inhibition of mycelial growth was clearly observed
in the presence of cell extracts after incubation for
7 days. It is possible that these strains are producing
antifungal metabolites, since activity was retained in solvent extracted preparations [22,23]. Colony morphology
of the five selected Streptomyces (strain LC-1, LC-4, JF1, SC-1 and MG-1) and activity of their crude extracts
against C. gloeosporioides strain DoA c1060 are illustrated in Figure 2A and 2B, respectively. All five crude
extract samples inhibited mycelial growth of the three
anthracnose fungi (Figure 2B). Crude extract of MG-1
and JF-1 exerted a higher inhibitory activity over the
other three crude extract samples as shown by larger
inhibition distance as well as shorter outgrowth of
fungal mycelia from the fungal agar block (Figure 2B).
The antifungal activity of JF-1 colony as well as its
crude extract against conidial growth of Colletotrichum
spp. is shown in Figure 3A and 3B. Its crude extract
shows strong inhibition against conidial suspension of
C. gloeosporioides strains DoA d0762 (Figure 3, B-1).
HPLC-DAD (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
with Diode-Array Detection) analysis

Crude extracts from the 5 isolates were separated by
HPLC and analyzed for their retention times and UVvisible properties. The results show that crude extracts
from 3 strains (LC-4, SC-1, and MG-1) produced
known compounds; strain LC-1 produced no significant
peaks; however, the JF-1 isolate appeared to produce
novel compounds (Table 4). The novelty of the secondary metabolites from strain JF-1 remains to be confirmed through purification and structural elucidation of
the metabolites and these compound(s) are currently
under investigation. From the analysis of the HPLC profiles it appears that the five isolates, which reside in different phylogenetic branches (Figure 1), produce
different bioactive compounds (Table 4).

Conclusions
In summary, plant rhizospheric soil contains abundant
actinomycetes species capable of producing different
antifungal compounds. HPLC analysis of cell extracts
revealed that one of the isolated strains (JF-1) has a high
potential to produce novel bioactive compounds that
were not present in our database. Purification and structure determination are essential for the further analysis

Methods
Indicator microorganisms and culture conditions

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides strains DoA d0762 and
DoA c1060 and C. capsici strain DoA c1511 were
obtained from Department of Agriculture, Ministry of
Agriculture and Co-operatives, Thailand. Saccharomyces
cerevisiae strain IFO 10217 was kindly provided by Dr.
Chuenchit Boonchird, Department of Biotechnology,
Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Thailand. The
fungi and yeast were incubated at 28°C and maintained
on potato dextrose agar (PDA) or 301 medium (2.4%
starch, 0.1% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.3% meat
extract, 0.4% CaCO3, and 1.2% agar).

Isolation of actinomycetes from soil samples

Rhizospheric soils (39 samples) were collected from
under fruit trees or plants in fruit orchards from
Chanthaburi, Bangkok, Petchaburi, and Nongbualamphu
provinces. Soil samples (1 g) were suspended in normal
saline solution (9 ml). The suspension was serially
diluted to final dilutions of 10-4, 10-5 and 10-6. Aliquots
(0.1 ml) of each dilution were spread on Pridham’s agar
(Pr) (1% glucose, 1% starch, 0.2% (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.2%
CaCO 3 , 0.1% K 2 HPO 4 , 0.1% MgSO 4 , 0.1% NaCl and
1.2% agar) and Water-proline agar (WA) (1% praline
and 1.2% agar) supplemented with 25 μg/ml nalidixic
acid and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide to prevent growth
of other bacteria and fungi, respectively. Plates were
incubated at 28°C for 4-14 days. Isolated actinomycetes

maintained on Seino’s (1% starch, 0.3% N-Z amine
typeA, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% meat extract, 0.3%
CaCO3, and 1.2% agar) and Waksman agar slants (1%
glucose, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% meat extract, 0.3% NaCl,
and 1.2% agar). The cultures on Seino’s or Waksman
agar were kept at room temperature and 4°C or -20°C,
respectively. Strains were subcultured to fresh media
every 2 months. For long-term preservation, conidial or
mycelial suspension in 25% glycerol were kept at -80°C.
Screening of antifungal activity by co-culture method

Antifungal activity was evaluated as described previously
[28]. The fungi and actinomycetes were grown on 301
medium at 28°C for 7 days. An agar block of indicator
fungus was prepared using a sterile cork borer with diameter of 8 mm, and placed at the center of the plate.
Six agar blocks, each block containing a single actinomycete colony, were inoculated around the fungal block
at a distance of 10 mm from the edge of the agar block.

Remarks

The plates were incubated at 28°C and inhibition of
mycelial growth was measured after 7 days [28]. For
testing the inhibitory activity against yeast, S. cerevisiae
was grown in PDB broth at 30°C for 2 days and a sterile
cotton swab was dipped into this culture and spread
evenly onto PDA plates. Agar blocks of seven-day-old
cultures of isolated actinomycetes were placed on the
PDA plate (six isolates/plate). After incubition for 2
days, the inhibition zone was measured. The five strains
that showed antifungal activity were further tested for
inhibition of conidial germination by inoculating a single
agar block of each isolate onto an agar plate (55 mm in
diameter) previously spread with fungal conidia (105
conidia/plate).
Extraction and bioassay for antifungal activity

Five strains (strain LC-1, LC-4, JF-1, SC-1 and MG-1)
showing strong activity against all three indicator fungi
were cultivated in 100 ml of 301 broth at 28°C for
2 days in 500-ml Erlenmeyrer flasks. The pre-culture
(10 ml) was inoculated into 200 ml of 301 medium in a
500-ml Erlenmeyrer flask, followed by incubation at
28°C for 6 days with rotary shaking at 150 rpm. After
the cultivation, an equal volume of absolute ethanol was
added to the entire culture. The mixture was shaken at
150 rpm for 45 minutes and the organic layer was
obtained by centrifugation. The cell-free supernatant
was evaporated to half the original volume and then
extracted with equal volume of ethyl acetate. The ethyl

Intra et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:98
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/98

acetate-extract was evaporated and the residue was dissolved in ethanol (1 ml). For bioassays, the extracts
(about 0.2-0.4 mg/20 μl) were loaded onto a sterile filter
disk (diameter 6 mm). The disk was left at room temperature until completely dried. A blank disk loaded
with 20 μl of ethanol was used as negative control. The
six disks were placed on the surface of agar medium
around an agar block (8 mm in diameter) containing
each indicator fungus. The inhibition zone was measured after further incubation at 28°C for 7 days.
HPLC-DAD (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
with Diode-Array Detection) analysis

Analytical HPLC was carried out with a Rainin Microsorb C18 column (4.6 × 75 mm) on an Agilent HP1100
system with a photodiode array detector (200-600 nm).
The flow rate was 1.2 ml/min, and additional UV detection was measured at 254 nm. The mobile phase used
was a stepwise gradient of CH3CN-0.15% KH2PO4 (pH
3.5) (15%-85% v/v). Chemical library analysis was performed by comparing the UV spectra and retention
time of respective peaks to those of compounds in the
database at Toyama Prefectural University, Japan.
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis for bacterial
identification at the genus level

Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences (~500 bp) from the isolates were determined from PCR-amplified fragments.
The genomic DNA used as templates for PCR was prepared from single colonies grown for 4-5 days on Waksman agar plate using the boiling method [29]. The 16S
rRNA fragment (~500 bp) was amplified using universal
primers UFUL (5’-GCCTAACACATGCAAGTCGA-3’)
and URUL (5’-CGTATTACCGCGGCT GCTGG-3’) [30].
The PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation
at 5 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of amplification
(94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec) and
an additional 7 min at 72°C. The direct sequencing of
PCR products was performed by dideoxy chain termination method using 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems), USA. The obtained sequences
were analyzed for homology using BLASTN [31].
Phylogenetic analysis of isolates

16S rRNA sequences of 30 strains were aligned with 16S
rRNA sequences of other actinomycetes retrieved from
the EMBL/GenBank database. Multiple alignments were
performed manually using Clustal × [32]. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 4 [33].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA from the 30 isolates investigated in this study have been deposited in
