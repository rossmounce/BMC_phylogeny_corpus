Abstract
Background: The migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) is an orthopteran pest and a representative
member of hemimetabolous insects for biological studies. Its transcriptomic data provide invaluable
information for molecular entomology and pave a way for the comparative research of other
medically, agronomically, and ecologically relevant insects. We developed the first transcriptomic
database of the locust (LocustDB), building necessary infrastructures to integrate, organize, and
retrieve data that are either currently available or to be acquired in the future.
Description: LocustDB currently hosts 45,474 high-quality EST sequences from the locust, which
were assembled into 12,161 unigenes. It, through user-friendly web interfaces, allows investigators
to freely access sequence data, including homologous/orthologous sequences, functional
annotations, and pathway analysis, based on conserved orthologous groups (COG), gene ontology
(GO), protein domain (InterPro), and functional pathways (KEGG). It also provides information
from comparative analysis based on data from the migratory locust and five other invertebrate
species, including the silkworm, the honeybee, the fruitfly, the mosquito and the nematode. The
website address of LocustDB is http://locustdb.genomics.org.cn/.
Conclusion: LocustDB starts with the first transcriptome information for an orthopteran and
hemimetabolous insect and will be extended to provide a framework for incorporating in-coming
genomic data of relevant insect groups and a workbench for cross-species comparative studies.

Background
Studying genetics and ecology of the evolutionarily diversified insects at molecular level is the most exciting area of
entomology research today [1]. Acquisitions of sequencing data and their comparative analyses build a foundation for understanding biological pathways, molecular
processes, and gene expression patterns, which are all relevant to physiological and genetic mechanisms of development, behavior, immunity, and phenotypic plasticity
of the insects [2,3]. Efforts to acquire and integrate transcriptomic and genomic data are initial yet essential steps,

and we have done so now by adding invaluable transcriptomic information from a new insect order, Orthoptera, to
the existing data involving three other insect orders, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera.
Our data came from a study concerning the migratory
locust (Locusta migratoria), a representative member of
hemimetabolous insects, which has a unique behavioral
phenotype: changing phases from a solitary state to a gregarious one when environmental and genetic factors
interact due to crowdedness [4]. Given the importance of

studying locust as one of the major agricultural pests, we
have developed a comprehensive and high-quality database, LocustDB (the Locust Database), for integrating,
organizing, and retrieving sequences and related information. LocustDB provides a permanent platform for comparative studies of biology, genetics, and evolution of the
locust. It currently hosts a large collection of expressionsequence-tags (EST), unigenes, and their annotations, and
integrated comparative analysis results from five other
invertebrate species whose genomic information has
become available from large-scale genomic studies,
including the silkworm, the honeybee, the fruit fly, the
mosquito, and the nematode. LocustDB is the first
genomic database for a hemimetabolous insect of orthopterans.

Construction and content
Data acquisition
EST sequences were generated from two types of cDNA
libraries, the organ-specific and the mixed. The first is
composed of six non-normalized, uni-directionally
cloned cDNAs made from mRNAs of heads, hind legs, and
midguts of fifth-instar locusts in two phenotypic phases:
solitary and gregarious. The mixed library was constructed
with mRNAs from the whole-body of the gregarious
locust. Clones from these libraries were sequenced from
the 5'-ends.
EST assembly and gene annotation
We developed a data mining pipeline that analyzes EST
data from multiple resources. The software package,
Phred-Phrap-Consed, was used for base-calling, quality
assessment, and sequence assembly [5,6]. Poly (A) tails,
low quality data, and vector sequences were screened by
CROSS_MATCH, and removed from the dataset.
Sequences less than 100 bp in length were also discarded.
A total of 45,474 high-quality ESTs with an average length
of 471 bp were assembled with stringent Phrap parameters, yielding 12,161 contigs. Redundant mitochondrial
RNAs, rRNAs, and E. coli contaminations were eliminated
from the final assemblies.

We carried out a comprehensive annotation procedure for
the locust unigenes. The clustered unigenes were annotated, based on a series of blast-based homology analysis
[7]: (1) BLASTN versus NCBI's non-redundant nucleotide
database, (2) BLASTX (E-value less than 1E-5) versus
NCBI's non-redundant protein database, and (3) BLASTX
versus the non-redundant protein database from SWISSPROT. Unigenes were annotated with Gene Ontology
(GO) terms by comparing the sequences against the database. Sequences with significant matches and best hits
were classified according to the database's classification
schemes [8]. We also compared our contigs and singlets
using RPS (Reverse PSI) BLAST [9,10] to sequences of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/11

COG (conserved orthologous genes) database and
assigned the corresponding unigenes into COG functional classifications [11]. Functional domains from nonredundant sequences were assigned based on information
from InterPro database [12]. Pathway analysis was performed against KEGG database with BLAST (Release 33)
[13]. In addition, we compared the unigenes with genome
data from the silkworm, the honeybee, the fruit fly, the
mosquito, and the nematode to further define orthologous genes in Ensembl [14] and SilkDB [15].
Implementation
LocustDB was organized with a relational model and
stored in Oracle 9i relation database management system.
Its web interface was constructed by using JSP scripts running on the Tom Cat web server, through which users
have supervisory access. Java Servlets and JavaBeans were
used to mediate interaction between clients and the database.

Utility
LocustDB provides an interactive and user-friendly web
interface for retrieving sequences and performing
sequence alignment along with useful functional annotations. The main page includes the following interface:
home, about, data, search, tool, and other accessory parts.
Once clicking on the data icon, users can enter any part of
the data modules: unigene model, its annotation and
orthologous genes from comparative analysis with those
of other insect species, enabling users to have a comprehensive overview of the stored data. Search engine is the
entry point to the database, including both simple and
advanced search modes. LocustDB hosts an online BLAST
server for sequence-based search that yields sequence
alignment, score, identity, E-value. And annotations of
the corresponding homologous genes can be visualized
simultaneously.
Upon clicking the search icon, users are presented with
the advanced search interface of the database. The query
starts with annotation and other basic analysis result of
unigenes. Unigene and EST sequences from corresponding assemblies can be obtained individually or directly
downloaded in bulk from the data module. For EST
search, users can identify a unigene and its ESTs by inputting EST name or ID. For unigene search, users can enter a
unigene name or annotation keywords, and detailed
information, such as ORF length, GC content, EST linkage, unigene alignment, and unigene annotations will be
presented in a result page. Hyperlinks provide as cross references for browsing definitions and associated components (such as KEGG pathway map, InterPro annotation,
GO annotation, phylogenetic analysis of COG, and primary BLAST results). Users may search for keywords of
function ontology, such as gene ontology number or

terms, to find putative genes that possess specific functions as well as orthologous genes in other organisms.
Alternatively, clients can choose appropriate definitions
from public databases, including NCBI_NR, NCBI_NT,
and Swiss_Prot. Links between the best BLAST hit to all
unigenes and public databases were also established. A
summary of BLAST hits and sequence alignment information from every BLAST analysis can be obtained upon
clicking the link button. Furthermore, users can check for
homologous genes between locust and the other invertebrate species whose genomic data are publicly available,
through hyperlinks to these databases for tracing detailed
information.

Discussion and conclusion

6.

The current aim of constructing LocustDB is to provide a
catalog of genes expressed in the locust tissues and cells
according to anatomic and phenotypic features to promote molecular entomology research. It will be modified
frequently to serve as a framework for incorporating new
genomic and proteomic data from the locust itself as well
as other orthopteran and hemimetabolous insects. The
database will also be updated for new versions with new
data and biological information collected from the relevant literature in an ongoing effort. As a note for future
development of this database, we plan to transform
LocustDB into an integrated knowledgebase hosting
information from genomic, biology, and ecology studies
on the locust as well as other insects.
