Abstract
Background: FAE1 (fatty acid elongase1) is the key gene in the control of erucic acid synthesis in seeds of Brassica
species. Due to oil with low erucic acid (LEA) content is essential for human health and not enough LEA resource could
be available, thus new LEA genetic resources are being sought for Brassica breeding. EcoTILLING, a powerful
genotyping method, can readily be used to identify polymorphisms in Brassica.
Results: Seven B. rapa, nine B. oleracea and 101 B. napus accessions were collected for identification of FAE1
polymorphisms. Three polymorphisms were detected in the two FAE1 paralogues of B. napus using EcoTILLING and
were found to be strongly associated with differences in the erucic acid contents of seeds. In genomic FAE1 sequences
obtained from seven B. rapa accessions, one SNP in the coding region was deduced to cause loss of gene function.
Molecular evolution analysis of FAE1 homologues showed that the relationship between the Brassica A and C genomes
is closer than that between the A/C genomes and Arabidopsis genome. Alignment of the coding sequences of these
FAE1 homologues indicated that 18 SNPs differed between the A and C genomes and could be used as genomespecific markers in Brassica.
Conclusion: This study showed the applicability of EcoTILLING for detecting gene polymorphisms in Brassica. The
association between B. napus FAE1 polymorphisms and the erucic acid contents of seeds may provide useful guidance
for LEA breeding. The discovery of the LEA resource in B. rapa can be exploited in Brasscia cultivation.
Background
Brassica, which comprises six species, three diploid
(Brassica rapa, B. oleracea and B. nigra) and three tetraploid (B. napus, B. juncea and B. carianta), is important
in global agriculture and food production. Each of the
three diploid species contains one of the original
genomes, A, B or C; spontaneous hybridization between
two of these three original genomes produced the three
tetraploid species [1]. According to recent comparative
genomic studies [2-4] the three original genomes arose
from the same ancestry, so all six species have complex

genomes, especially the three tetraploid plants. In general, three paralogous regions were predicted for the diploids and six for the tetraploids. These Brassica species
produce an oil that contains essential human dietary
components, and some components of the oil are used in
industry [5]. During the past 40 years, major traits of
Brassica have been significantly improved: yield, plant
architecture, seed quality and so on. The erucic acid content of the seeds is also a major trait to be considered in
improving Brassica oilseed. A low erucic acid content is
necessary for human health, while a high content is necessary for industrial use [5,6]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to collect and identify different kinds of genetic
resources, including high and low seed erucic acid contents, for breeding new Brassica cultivars.

FAE1 (fatty acid elongase1) is the key gene in controlling erucic acid synthesis in Brassica seeds. It was originally cloned in Arabidopsis by directed transposon
tagging with the maize element Activator (Ac); no intron
was found in this gene [7]. The product of FAE1 is a condensing enzyme that extends fatty acid chain lengths
from C18 to C20 and C22 [8,9]. Many recent reports have
addressed the structure of FAE1 and its relationship to
Brassica genomes and seed erucic acid contents. A full
cDNA for this gene, as well as the genomic DNA and predicted promoter sequences, are readily available from
GenBank. Using this information, full length genomic
FAE1 sequences were cloned by screening the B. napus
BAC library with one fragment probe of this gene, and
two paralogous FAE1 in the genome were found [10].
Two major QTLs were detected using a reference doubled haploid mapping population (TNDH) originating
from a Chinese high erucic acid (HEA) cultivar, B. napus
cv. Ningyou7, and a European low erucic acid (LEA) cultivar, B. napus cv. Tapidor. These two QTLs, one located
on linkage group/chromosome A8 (A genome) and the
other on C3 (C genome), accounted for ~71% of the
genetic variation [11]. With developed polymorphic
markers and the TNDH mapping population, the two
paralogues were regarded as genes under the two QTLs
for seed erucic acid contents [10]. Similar findings were
reported by Rahman et al. [12]. In 2002 and 2004, one
SNP was found in FAE1 between a high and a low erucic
acid content B. napus cultivar [13,14], and this was also
reported by Nath et al. [15]. In addition, a four-base
nucleotide deletion within the FAE1 coding region in an
LEA compared to an HEA cultivar was reported. Expression these HEA and LEA FAE1 genes in yeast indicated
that the SNP or indel causes the differences in erucic acid
content [13,14,16]. The B. rapa (A) and B. oleracea (C)
genomes also have paralogous FAE1 s [17].
EcoTILLING is a new approach developed from TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genome) and is
mainly used to detect SNPs in natural populations. The
first successful application of EcoTILLING was to detect
variations in several genes in a natural Arabidopsis population in 2004 [18]. Many SNPs in a dozen genes were also
identified in wild populations of Populus trichocarpa
[19]. Several reports have indicated that EcoTILLING is a
highly efficient approach to detecting genetic variations
associated with target traits for crop improvement. Nieto
et al. detected one haplotype comprising several grouped
SNPs controlling virus susceptibility in a natural melon
population. Key SNPs in the resistance gene were also
identified and these may be exploited for resistance
breeding [20]. However, despite several reports on EcoTILLING, it is relatively difficult to apply the technique
to crop improvement, especially for polyploid plants with
complex genomes.

Here we report the application of EcoTILLING to the
identification of LEA cultivars among natural populations
of three Brassica species. About 100 accessions of modern cultivars of B. napus, seven of B. rapa and nine of B.
oleracea were collected. Variations in the two paralogous,
B. napus FAE1s, among these cultivars were detected
using EcoTILLING. In total, three SNPs/indels were
found to be associated with differences in seed erucic
acid contents. A new LEA genetic resource was found in
the natural B. rapa population using sequence alignment.
Analysis of the evolutionary relationships and sequence
similarities among these three Brassica species showed a
closer pedigree relationship between the Brassica A and
C genomes than between the A/C genomes and Arabidopsis genome; 18 SNPs were found in the coding region
of FAE1 and may be used as genome-specific markers to
differentiate the A and C genomes.

Results
1. Phenotyping for erucic acid contents of seeds of Brassica
accessions

One hundred and one accessions of B. napus cultivars
were collected, mostly modern cultivars. Many of them
perform excellently in terms of key traits such as oil content, fatty acid composition, yield and so on. These accessions were derived from different geographic origins: 71
from China, 9 from Sweden, 6 from Germany, 5 from
France, 4 from Australia, 1 from Canada, 1 from Denmark, 1 from Poland, and 3 from unknown regions
[Additional file 1]. To learn more about the LEA genetic
resource, the original LEA ancestors of B. napus, 'Liho'
and 'Oro', were also collected. Seven accessions of B. rapa
(5 from China, 1 from Australia and 1 from Finland)
(Table 1) and nine of B. oleracea (all from China) were
also collected (Table 1).
The erucic acid contents of the seeds of the 101 B.
napus accessions ranged from approximately zero to
more than 57% [Additional file 1]. In 60 accessions, the
erucic acid contents were between zero and 10%; in one,
between 10% and 20%; in eight, between 20% and 30%; in
five, between 30% and 40%; and in 27, more than 40%.
Thus, the collection comprised B. napus pools with low,
medium and high erucic acid contents in seeds. In the
seven B. rapa accessions, two were LEA with almost zero
erucic acid contents (Table 1). We found no LEA accession among the nine cultivars of B. oleracea (Table 1).
2. FAE1 polymorphisms in the three Brassica species

Two paralogous FAE1 s were cloned by Wang et al. [10]
through screening the B. napus BAC library. They were
designated as Bn.FAE1-A8 and Bn.FAE1-C3. Open Reading Frame (ORF) analysis indicated that the coding
regions of the two FAE1 paralogues were 1521 bp long
with no intron and the similarity between them in the

a591 indicates the position 63 bp from the base 'A' in the start codon of B. rapa FAE1. P197=b indicates amino acid diversity due to this nucleotide

polymorphism. c489 indicates the position 63 bp from the base 'A' in the start codon of B. oleracea FAE1. Three haplotypes of FAE1 can be inferred
among these seven B. rapa accessions. Accessions Nos. 1-5 are B. rapa haplotype 1; accession No. 6 is B. rapa haplotype 2 and accession No. 7 is B.
rapa haplotype 3. Seven haplotypes of FAE1 can be inferred among these nine B. oleracea accessions. Accessions Nos. 1, 4 and 8 are B. oleracea
haplotype 1; Accessions No. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 are B. oleracea haplotypes 2 to 7, respectively.

HEA B. napus cv. Ningyou7 genome was 98.6%. Using
primer pairs designed according to these sequences
(Table 2, Figure 1) and EcoTILLING, polymorphisms
were detected in the 101 B. napus accessions. Overall,
one position in Bn.FAE1-A8 showed polymorphism and
two positions in Bn.FAE1-C3 showed polymorphisms in
the coding regions. Using EcoTILLING, seven accessions
were identified individually as heterozygous on Bn.FAE1A8 or Bn.FAE1-C3. Figure 2 illustrates the polymorphisms in the second half region of Bn.FAE1-C3 with
EcoTILLING screening.
To confirm these EcoTILLING results, we randomly
sequenced 5-10 samples of each polymorphism and confirmed them at all the positions tested. In total, 19
sequences were obtained; ten of these were selected to
confirm the polymorphism on Bn.FAE1-A8 (GenBank
No.: HM362915 to HM362924); nine were selected to

confirm the two polymorphisms on Bn.FAE1-C3 (GenBank No.: HM362925 to HM362933, HM362925 and
HM362926 contained two polymorphisms). The
sequencing results showed that the polymorphic locus of
Bn.FAE1-A8 was at 845 bp. (We designated the nucleotide 'A' in the start codon of the coding region as position number '1' and the 5' flanking sequence as plus
positions; all positions were numbered on the FAE1
sequence of the reference sample B. napus cv. Huayou5.)
In some accessions the position was C; in others it was T
[Additional file 1]. Two polymorphic loci of Bn.FAE1-C 3
were located at 1368-1371 bp (an indel, AGGC deletion)
and 1422-1423 bp (an indel, AA deletion). Additional file
1 shows the positions of all the polymorphisms within the
HEA FAE1 coding region.
Two primer pairs, FAE1-rapa and FAE1-olearacea, were
selected to amplify the genomic FAE1 sequences of B.

rapa and B. oleracea, respectively (Table 2). Sequencing
of the PCR products from each sample of B. rapa
revealed six polymorphisms in the FAE1 coding regions
of the seven B. rapa accessions (Table 1). Different geographical origins may contribute to sequence differences
because five accessions from China had identical
sequences and the other two, one from Australia and one
from Finland, had different sequences. Five polymorphisms in the coding regions of FAE1 were detected from
Chinese accessions of B. oleracea which showed much
greater divergence (Table 1, Additional file 1).

3. Association of FAE1 polymorphisms with differences in
seed erucic acid contents among the three Brassica species

According to the EcoTILLING results that identified
FAE1 polymorphisms in the 101 B. napus accessions, two
haplotypes of Bn.FAE1-A8 and four of Bn.FAE1-C3 were
inferred. The sequences with nucleotide C and T in the
845 bp position on Bn.FAE1-A8 were designated haplotype A8-H0 and A8-H1, respectively. No deletion of
Bn.FAE1-C3 was designated haplotype C3-H0. A fourbase (AGGC) deletion in Bn.FAE1-C3 1368-1371 bp and
a two-base (AA) deletion in Bn.FAE1-C3 1422-1423 bp
were designated C3-H1 and C3-H2, respectively. A haplotype with deletions in both positions (1368-1371 bp and

Figure 2 Detection of polymorphisms for part of Bn.FAE1-C3 using EcoTILLING. DNA from each accession mixed 1:1 with B. napus cv. Huayou5
and DNA from each accession alone were used for EcoTILLING, and these two samples were loaded on adjacent lanes on the gel. Lanes with triangle

ladders and digested PCR products are labelled with corresponding numbers and the unit is bp.

1422-1423 bp) was named C3-H3 (Table 3). The reference accession B. napus cv. Huayou5 contained A8-H0
and C3-H0 in its genome and was an HEA cultivar. Furthermore, we found that when the nucleotide changed
from C (A8-H0) to T (A8-H1) in FAE1, the predicted
translated amino acid changed from serine to phenylalanine. Both deletions in Bn.FAE1-C3 led to premature stop
codon in the predicted ORF.
The erucic acid content of A8-H0 seeds (mean =
45.36%) was significantly higher than that of A8-H1
(mean = 2.04%) according to ANOVA (GLM model) and
an LSD (least significant difference) All-Pairwise Comparison Test (P < 0.01), indicating that C in the 845 bp
position of Bn.FAE1-A8 is essential for gene function and
T may result in loss of function. We found that C3-H0,

C3-H1, C3-H2, C3-H3, were also significantly associated
with differences in seed erucic acid contents (P < 0.01).
The erucic acid content related to C3-H0 (mean =
44.73%) was far higher than that in the other three haplotypes. The erucic acid content of C3-H2 seeds (mean =
0.67%) was significantly lower than that of C3-H1 (mean
= 2.78%), showing that the two-base (AA) deletion at
1422-1423 bp in Bn.FAE1-C3 inhibited erucic acid synthesis more efficiently that the four-base (AGGC) deletion at 1368-1371 bp. The erucic acid content of
haplotype C3-H3 (mean = 0.55%), which harboured both
deletions in Bn.FAE1-C3, was significantly lower than
those of C3-H1 and C3-H2, which harboured one but not
both of the deletions. In conclusion, nucleotide C at the
845 bp position of Bn.FAE1-A8 is essential for gene func-

tion and T might lead to loss of function; the two premature stop codons resulting from the two deletions on
Bn.FAE1-C3 might also cause loss of function.
Too few B. rapa and B. oleracea samples were collected
for ANOVA to be applied to their data. Alignment of the
seven FAE1 coding sequences of B. rapa showed that
three FAE1 haplotypes can be inferred. Accession Nos. 15 were B. rapa haplotype 1, accession No. 6 was haplotype 2 and accession No. 7 haplotype 3 (Table 1). Three of
the six polymorphisms were found at positions 591 bp
(G/A), 735 bp (C/T) and 968 bp (C/T), and these may be
associated with differences in the erucic acid contents of
seeds. Plants with nucleotide G at 591 bp and C at 735 bp
and 968 bp in B. rapa FAE1 had high seed erucic acid
contents; those with A at 591 bp and T at 735 bp and 968
bp had low contents. The nucleotide changes at 591 bp
and 735 bp did not alter the amino acids predicted from
the ORF, but when the C changed to T at 968 bp, the corresponding amino acid changed from threonine to isoleucine. Thus, the difference at position 968 bp in FAE1 may
have caused the phenotypic difference. Comparing these
findings with the nucleotide change in position 845 bp in
the A genome of B. napus, it may be concluded that the
LEA genetic resources in the A genomes in our collection
differed between B. rapa and B. napus.
Alignment of the nine B. oleracea FAE1 coding
sequences indicated seven haplotypes. Accessions Nos. 1,
4 and 8 were B. oleracea haplotype 1; accessions Nos. 2, 3,
5, 6, 7 and 9 were B. oleracea 2 to 7, respectively (Table 1).
Five polymorphisms were found in these nine FAE1 coding regions (Table 1). Since no LEA accession was collected for B. oleracea in this study, no rule could be found
for the genotypes of the HEA accessions of this species.
4. Evolutionary relationship of FAE1 among the three
Brassica species

In order to investigate the pedigree relationship among
the different Brassica species and explore the genetic
basis of the LEA genetic resource, a phylogenetic tree was
constructed using 17 FAE1 sequences: six B. napus FAE1

haplotypes, seven B. oleracea haplotypes, three B. rapa
haplotyes, and one Arabidopsis sequence (Figure 3). This
phyogenetic tree indicated that the divergence between
the A and C genome FAE1 s occurred later than that
between Arabidopsis and Brassica species, which is consistent with other reports [4,21,22]. The tree also showed
that the FAE1 sequences of the A genome formed two
groups, viz. the sequences from B. napus and B. rapa.
However, the C genome revealed more complex groups,
making it difficult to draw clear conclusions about the
pedigree relationship. In addition, 18 SNPs differed
between the A and C genomes, as shown by multiple
alignments of 16 FAE1 sequences from the three Brassica
species (Table 4). Analysis of these SNPs showed that
many restriction enzymes could distinguish between the
A and C genomes. Changes in the nucleotides of 15 of
these 18 SNPs led to no changes in the amino acid
encoded.

Discussion
EcoTILLING, a method developed from TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genome), was successfully applied to B. napus, which is considered one of the
most complex polyploid plants. We may infer that EcoTILLING is a very powerful method for identifying polymorphisms and for association mapping and developing
functional markers for crops. However, gene-specific
primer design is the key step for successful application of
EcoTILLING to crop improvement. From the first application of TILLING to Arabidopsis [23], many studies
have detailed the difficulty of developing primers for
TILLING and EcoTILLING for crops, because most
crops harbour very complex genomes and genomic
sequence information is insufficient [10,20,24,25]. Of
course, it is relatively easy to design gene-specific primers
for plants that have been completely sequenced, such as
Arabidopsis and rice [18,26]. Two procedures for developing primers for TILLING and EcoTILLING have been
reported for crops with complex genomes. First, genespecific primers can be designed according to sequence

procedure [18,19,24,25]. Secondly, co-amplified primers
can be used for genes that are present in multiple copies
and show minor sequence differences among paralogues.
Two studies have successfully applied this procedure in
TILLING and EcoTILLING [10,27]. In the present study,
genomic sequence information was obtained first, and
then gene-specific primers were designed for the two
paralogues of FAE1.

It has been reported that erucic acid is an antinutritional component of seed oil [6]. Therefore, a major
objective for rapeseed breeding is to achieve and apply
genetic resources with low seed erucic acid contents.
During the 1960s, the first LEA B. napus germplasm was
found in an animal feed rape 'Liho', and then the first B.
napus LEA cultivar 'Oro' was developed by introducing
an LEA genetic resource from 'Liho' [28]. As far as we
know, no other LEA genetic resource for breeders has
been reported. In this research, we investigated the LEA
resources in a collection of 101 modern B. napus acces-

sions. The polymorphisms found for Bn.FAE1-A8 and
Bn.FAE1-C3 readily revealed the SNPs/indels associated
with differences in seed erucic acid contents. Thus, our
results are consistent with other studies showing that
SNPs/indels in FAE1 corresponded to loss of function of
this gene in yeast [13,14,16]. However, comparing these
SNPs/indels to the first LEA germplams 'Liho' and 'Oro',
we could find only one polymorphisim (1368-1371 bp of
Bn. FAE1-C3) which may be a new LEA resource. But this
deletion was also on the background of the original LEA
germplams 'Liho' and 'Oro'. This indicated that no more
other LEA resource came out during the past 40 years.
Therefore, the LEA genetic resource for B. napus is not
sufficient and more are required to avoid genetic erosion.
New LEA mutants with a high erucic acid content
genetic background were obtained by screening a large B.
napus EMS mutant population with TILLING [10]. This
would be a very efficient method for augmenting LEA
genetic resources. In this study, one new LEA genetic
resource in B. rapa was also found, which differed from
that in B. napus. There have been many successful
reports about the exchange of beneficial traits among six
Brassica species in the U'Triangle [29-32]. Thus, the LEA

genetic resource from B. rapa could be introduced to B.
napus to improve this crop.
The All-Pairwise Comparison Test revealed differences
in seed erucic acid contents, related to the four haplotypes of Bn.FAE1-C3 in our B. napus collection. Both the
two-base deletion at 1422-1423 bp and the four-base
deletion at 1367-1371 bp affected Bn.FAE1-C3 function.
The two-base deletion reduced the seed erucic acid content more efficiently than the four-base deletion, and the
combination of the two deletions knocked out gene function (Table 3) more effectively than either deletion alone.
Thus, to take advantage of these LEA resources, it would
be better to introduce both deletions into the target
plants so as to breed cultivars with less erucic acid in the
seeds.
In the molecular evolutionary analysis of the FAE1
sequences of the three Brassica species and Arabidopsis,
we found 18 SNPs that differed between the A and C
genomes. Fifteen of these 18 SNPs are silent variations
and the original types of Brassica species with a full function of FAE1 which could produce high erucic acid in
seeds. From these results, we may deduce that it is difficult for plants with loss of functional FAE1 to survive

long in evolution. In other words, plants with higher seed
erucic acid contents have a greater capacity to adapt to
the environment.

Conclusions
EcoTILLING has been successfully applied to the identification of FAE1 variations in Brassica. Polymorphisms in
Bn.FAE1-A8 and Bn.FAE1-C3 were strongly associated
with differences in the erucic acid contents of seeds. Different nucleotide deletions in Bn. FAE1-C3 reduced the
erucic acid content to different degrees. The discovery of
a new LEA resource enlarged the pool of genetic
resources and could be used for LEA breeding.
Methods
1. Plant materials

Seeds of most of the B. napus and B. rapa accessions were
obtained from the Chinese Crop Germplasms Information System (CGRIS, a germplasm repository for collecting worldwide genetic resource of oilseed crop) and seeds
of the two LEA ancestor cultivars, 'Liho' and 'Oro', were
obtained from the Australian Temperate Field Crops Collection (ATFCC). Seeds of the nine accessions of B. oleracea were obtained from the Horticulture Department of
Huazhong Agricultural University (HAU). The plants
were grown in the field and young leaves were picked to
extract DNA with a JYZ-3-1-2 isolation kit (Genebase
Gene-Tech Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China). Self-pollinated
seeds from B. napus and B. oleracea cultivars were harvested for the determination of erucic acid content.
Owing to the self-incompatibility of B. rapa, sib-crossings
between two plants with uniform genetic backgrounds
were done for each accession collected, and seeds were
then harvested.
2. Erucic acid contents of seeds

The erucic acid contents of self-pollinated seeds were
determined by gas chromatography (GC) as described in
[33] with little modification. First, 30-50 oven-dried seeds
were crushed and transferred to 50 ml screw-capped centrifuge tubes. Thereafter, 1 ml ether/Sherwood oil
reagent (1 ether: 1 Sherwood oil, by volume) and 1 ml
methanol reagent (23 g potassium hydroxide in 1000 ml
methanol) were added. The mixture was incubated at
room temperature (25°C) for at least 40 min then 20-30
ml distilled water was added to the tubes. Finally 0.4-0.8
μl upper layer was loaded on to the GC instrument (HP
6890 series). Erucic acid content was determined by measuring the area of the peak.
3. Screening of B. napus FAE1 polymorphisms by
EcoTILLING

Two complete paralogous FAE1 genomic sequences,
EU543282 (Bn.FAE1-A8) and EU543283 (Bn.FAE1-C3),

Page 9 of 11

were retrieved from NCBI. Because these two paralogues
are very similar, it was difficult to design gene-specific
primer pairs for the coding region. Therefore, two primer
pairs, FAE1-A8 and FAE1-C3, were designed with 5' and
3' flanking sequences of the two paralogous genes (Table
2, Figure 1). The two forward primers corresponding to
the 5' flanking sequence were the same (their position in
genes is -167 to -147 bp), whereas the reverse primers
corresponding to the 3' flanking sequence differed
between Bn.FAE1-A8 and Bn.FAE1-C3 (1711 to 1734 bp
for Bn.FAE1-A8, 1728 to 1750 bp for Bn.FAE1-C3, Figure
1). PCR products amplified with the two primer pairs
were both about 1.9 kb and were unsuitable for EcoTILLING because 1.5 kb is the longest size for the detection
instrument [34]. Another two primer pairs, designated
ECOT-1 and ECOT-2, (Table 2), were designed according
to the two paralogous coding regions, and were used to
amplify the first half fragment (-74 to 1025) and the second half fragment (727-1589) of Bn.FAE1-A8 or
Bn.FAE1-C3, respectively (Figure 1). Sequence of universal primers M13F was added to 5' ends of ECOT-1F and
ECOT-2F as adaptors; and M13R was also added to
ECOT-1R and ECOT-2R (Table 2). The universal primers
M13F and M13R were labelled at the 5' end with IRD 700
and IRD 800, separately (MWG Biotech, Inc., Ebersberg,
Germany). FAE1-A8 and FAE1-C3 were used to amplify
the two paralogous genes separately in the first PCR reaction, and then these PCR products were amplified by
nested PCR reaction. This reaction contained a mixture
of gene-specific primers with M13 tails and the universal
labelled M13 primers.
DNA samples were isolated from each B. napus accession (single plant, self-pollinated seeds harvested from
this plant were used for erucic acid content test) and 50
ng DNA was used for 10 μl PCR reaction. B. napus cv.
Huayou5 is a very old cultivar in China and it was speculated to have high divergence to the modern B. napus cultivars according to experiences of breeders. Aiming to
detect more polymorphic sites on EcoTILLING gel, a replicate DNA sample of this accession was used as reference
in this study. To test whether the two paralogues were
heterozygous, these DNA samples were mixed 1:1 with
the reference sample and also individually. The products
of the first PCR which amplified by gene-specific primer
pairs FAE1-A8 or FAE1-C3 were diluted 50-fold to carry
out the nested PCR reaction. The screening protocol followed that described by Till et al [34]. CEL1 enzyme was
extracted from celery according to Oleykowski et al [35].
To avoid PCR errors, all PCR reactions were amplified
with proof-reading pfu taq polymerase (Tiangen Biotech,
Inc., Beijing, China).
To confirm the polymorphisms identified by EcoTILLING, the accessions that showed polymorphism on a gel
were randomly selected for amplification with the primer

Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:137
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/137

pairs FAE1-A8 or FAE1-C3 again with proof-reading pfu
taq polymerase. The PCR products were electrophoresed
on agarose gels to recover the target bands, and the purified products were sequenced with ABI 3730. In the analysis of the sequences obtained, chromatograms of each
sample were checked to reduce PCR or sequencing
errors.
4. Identify of FAE1 polymorphisms in B. rapa and B.oleracea

Three B. rapa sequences, AF400050, Y14975 and Y14974,
and two B. oleracea sequences, Y14981 and AF05440,
were retrieved from NCBI. For these sequences, which
contained Bn.FAE1-A8 and Bn.FAE1-C3, a total of five
primer pairs were designed to amplify the complete B.
rapa and B. oleracea genomic FAE1 sequences (Table 2).
Because of their high efficiency, FAE1-rapa and FAE1oleracea were selected to amplify the seven B. rapa and
nine B. oleracea accessions. The PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels to recover the target bands,
and the purified products were sequenced with ABI 3730.
Sequences of these cultivars were aligned using ClustalX
1.83 (downloaded from NCBI), and the polymorphisms
were also determined by comparing them with their
sequence traces to avoid negative SNPs.
5. Data analysis and phylogenetic tree construction

Associations between FAE1 polymorphisms of B. napus
and seed erucic acid contents were analyzed by ANOVA
(GLM model) and an LSD (Least Significant Difference)
multi-comparison test (SAS 8.2 software).
To construct the phylogenetic tree for FAE1, six types
of FAE1 sequences of B. napus (A8-H0, A8-H1, C3-H0,
C3-H1, C3-H2 and C3-H3), three of B. rapa (B. rapa haplotypes 1 to 3), seven of B. oleracea (B. oleracea haplotypes 1 to 7) and the FAE1 sequence of Arabidopsis
(AT4G34520) were collected, and phylogenetic and
molecular evolutionary analyzes were conducted using
Phylip 3.68 with a neighbour-joining (N-J) algorithm
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/
phylip.html[36]. To analyze genome-specific markers for
the A and C genome, the above 17 sequences except the
FAE1 sequence of Arabidopsis were aligned with ClustalX
1.83 with default parameters [37], and SNPs that differed
between the A and C genomes were analyzed using the
PARSESNP (Project Aligned Related Sequences and Evaluate SNPs) web tool for identifying restriction enzymes
and predicting amino acid changes [38].
