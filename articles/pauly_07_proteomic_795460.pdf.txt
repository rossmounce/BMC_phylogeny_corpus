Abstract
Background: 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in many signalling mechanisms due to their
interaction with Ser/Thr phosphorylated target proteins. They are evolutionarily well conserved in
eukaryotic organisms from single celled protozoans and unicellular algae to plants and humans. A
diverse array of target proteins has been found in higher plants and in human cell lines including
proteins involved in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, cytoskeletal organisation, secretion and Ca2+
signalling.
Results: We found that the simple metazoan Hydra has four 14-3-3 isoforms. In order to
investigate whether the diversity of 14-3-3 target proteins is also conserved over the whole animal
kingdom we isolated 14-3-3 binding proteins from Hydra vulgaris using a 14-3-3-affinity column. We
identified 23 proteins that covered most of the above-mentioned groups. We also isolated several
novel 14-3-3 binding proteins and the Hydra specific secreted fascin-domain-containing protein
PPOD. In addition, we demonstrated that one of the 14-3-3 isoforms, 14-3-3 HyA, interacts with
one Hydra-Bcl-2 like protein in vitro.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that 14-3-3 proteins have been ubiquitous signalling components
since the start of metazoan evolution. We also discuss the possibility that they are involved in the
regulation of cell numbers in response to food supply in Hydra.

Background
Apoptotic and cell survival signalling are important to
maintain cellular homeostasis in many tissues and
organs. This has been demonstrated very clearly during

neurogenesis and haematopoesis in higher animals but
has also been found at the base of metazoan evolution in
the simple cnidarian Hydra. In Hydra, apoptosis is activated in response to altered feeding conditions. In wellPage 1 of 15

fed animals, asexual buds are produced rapidly and cell
numbers double every 2–3 days. Under restrictive feeding
conditions budding stops and cell numbers do not
increase. Nevertheless, cell proliferation continues, leading to the production of excess cells which are removed by
apoptosis and phagocytosis [1]. Thus Hydra regulates
organismic growth by regulating apoptosis.
In an attempt to identify molecular mechanisms, which
govern the regulation of this highly useful adaptive
response to feeding, we initiated a study of 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 proteins are small, dimeric adaptor proteins
that bind to a variety of target proteins, thereby regulating
their activity, conformation, subcellular distribution and/
or stability. In most cases, a 14-3-3 dimer binds to a target
protein via a conserved binding motif [2,3]. These
motives usually contain serine or threonine residues that
become phosphorylated in response to cellular signals
(recently reviewed by [4,5]). Besides these phosphorylation-dependent interactions there are a number of target
proteins that bind to 14-3-3 independent of their phosphorylation state [6-8]. There is also a growing list of 143-3 targets which lack a conserved binding motif [8-10].
14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in the regulation of
diverse cellular processes. Two important themes, however, are the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of metabolic responses (e.g. changes in nutrient
supply) and in the regulation of apoptosis. In plants 14-33 proteins mediate the response of metabolic enzymes to
environmental changes, e.g. sudden darkness (reviewed
in [5]). The so-called "dark-induced" signalling pathway
involves changes in the activity of several enzymes mediated by 14-3-3 binding after phosphorylation. In yeast,
14-3-3 proteins function in rapamycin sensitive signalling
cascades as positive regulators of TOR kinase signalling
[11-14]. In vertebrates the activity of key enzymes in glucose metabolism such as GAPDH and phosphofructokinase is regulated by phosphorylation through PKB/Akt
and subsequent binding to 14-3-3. The involvement of
14-3-3 target proteins in apoptosis is also mediated by
phosphorylation of target proteins by PKB/Akt, leading to
suppression of apoptosis in the presence of growth factor
signalling. The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax
and Bad are examples of 14-3-3 targets in this pathway
[15-17]. In the presence of growth factors Bad is phosphorylated and inactivated by binding to 14-3-3.
We have previously isolated two 14-3-3 proteins from
Hydra, HyA and HyB, and shown that they interact with
phosphorylated target proteins and form homo- and heterodimers [18]. Moreover, they respond to starvation by
changing their subcellular distribution [18]. Using ESTsequences and the recently assembled Hydra genome we
have now identified two further 14-3-3 isoforms, 14-3-3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/31

HyC and 14-3-3 HyD, bringing the final number of 14-33 proteins in Hydra to four. To investigate the role of 143-3 proteins in the adaptation of hydra growth (budding)
to feeding conditions we have looked for 14-3-3 target
proteins. Using a 14-3-3 affinity column we identified 23
14-3-3 binding proteins in hydra extracts. Among those
were a number of metabolic enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, putative signalling molecules and novel proteins.
Although Bcl-2 family members were not among the proteins isolated on the affinity column, in the Hydra EST
database and in genome sequencing data at NCBI we have
identified seven Bcl-2-like proteins and two Bak
homologs. One of the Bcl-2-like proteins has a 14-3-3
binding motif in its C-terminus. With GST-pulldowns we
show here that this Hydra Bcl-2-like protein interacts specifically with 14-3-3 HyA in vitro.

Methods
Hydra culture
Hydra vulgaris was cultured at a temperature of 18°C in
medium containing 0.1 mM KCl, 1 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
MgSO4, 1 mM Tris, and 1 mM CaCl2. The animals were
fed regularly with freshly hatched Artemia nauplii.
Antibodies and reagents
Anti-14-3-3 antibody K19 was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz) and used at 1:500 to 1:1000.
Anti-Tubulin antibody (WA 3, used at 1:10) was a kind
gift from Prof. Manfred Schliwa, Munich. Rhodaminephalloidin was a kind gift from Dr. Ralph Gräf, Munich.
Anti-mouse-FITC secondary antibody (used at 1:50) was
from Sigma-Aldrich (Hamburg), anti-rabbit-Cy3 secondary antibody (used at 1:500) was from Dianova (Hamburg). Anti-digoxigenin-HRP antibody was purchased
from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, used 1:1000) and
anti-Xpress from Invitrogen (used 1:5000).
Preparation of hydra lysate
Prior to lysis the animals were starved for two days. On the
day of lysis they were washed twice in hydra medium,
which was then replaced by 400 ml lysis buffer (1% Triton
X-100, 1% CHAPS, 2 mM Mg-ATP, 10 μg/ml antipain/leupeptin/pepstatin A/aprotinin, 1 mM pefabloc, 1 mM
vanadate, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Animals were lysed by passing them through a 17 gauge needle and subsequent freezing at -80°C. The lysate was then
clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 g and 4°C
and the supernatant was mixed with 8 mg Bmh1/Bmh2CH-sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4°C.
14-3-3 affinity column
The 14-3-3 affinity column was prepared essentially as
described in Moorhead et al [19]. Briefly, 8 mg recombinant 14-3-3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bmh1 and
Bmh2, 6× His tagged, expressed in E. coli DH5α, purified

as in [19,20]), was incubated with activated CH sepharose
at room temperature. Non-reacted, active groups were
blocked with 0.1 M Tris/Cl pH 8. A lysate prepared from
100 000 hydra was incubated with 14-3-3 sepharose for 1
h at 4°C. The mixture was then packed into a disposable
plastic column (Biorad) and washed with 50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5/0.5 M NaCl/1 mM DTT. To test whether proteins
were eluted unspecifically, the column was washed with
an unrelated phospho-peptide (-WFYpSFLE-). The 14-3-3
binding proteins were then eluted from the column with
1 mM peptide C (-ARAApSAPA-). The presence of 14-3-3
binding proteins in every fraction was tested in a Far Western Overlay with DIG labelled 14-3-3 proteins.
Mass Spectrometry and EST analysis
20 μg of eluted 14-3-3 binding proteins were separated in
an SDS-gel and stained with colloidal coomassie. Single
protein bands were cut out of the gel and washed twice
with water and twice with 40 mM ammoniumbicarbonate. After two-fold treatment with 50% acetonitrile for 5
min, 10 μg/ml trypsin (Promega) was added and proteins
were digested overnight in 40 mM ammoniumbicarbonate at 30°C while shaking. For protein identification
probes were directly used for nano-ESI-LC-MS/MS. Each
sample was first separated on a C18 reversed phase column via an acetonitrile gradient (Famos-Switchos-Ultimate System and column (75 μm i.d. × 15 cm, packed
with C18 PepMap™, 3 μm, 100 Å) by LC Packings) before
spectra were recorded on a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer
(Applied Biosystems). The resulting spectra where then
analysed via the Mascot™ Software (Matrix Science) using
the Hydra Protein database (see below).
Peptide prediction from Hydra EST sequences
Hydra EST sequences were downloaded from the EMBL
sequence database [21] and were assembled on the Sputnik comparative genomics platform [22]. These sequences
are derived from several cDNA libraries made from whole
budding hydra (Hydra EST database). To increase the relative quality of the sequences and to reduce sequence
redundancy sequence clustering was performed using the
HarvESTer application.

All unigene sequences were compared against known or
predicted peptides using the BLASTX algorithm against a
non-redundant (Nonred) protein sequence database. Best
scoring BLASTX matches exceeding the arbitrary expectation value of 10e-10 were selected and the Hydra coding
sequence was extracted from the BLAST output. 1,853
high scoring sequence blocks were selected. These
sequence blocks were scored for the relative occurrence of
all in-frame hexanucleotide sequences. The concomitant
di-codon probability tables were used with the frame
finder application to select for the most parsimonious
open reading frame from each unigene sequence. This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/31

yielded robust peptide sequences even in the absence of a
BLASTX homologue.
DIG labelling of 14-3-3 proteins
Recombinant 14-3-3 from yeast (Bmh1 and Bmh2, see
above) was labelled with digoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-e-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and
separated from excess reagent using the digoxygenin protein labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Labelled 14-3-3 protein was
diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in 2 mg/ml BSA
and 0.05% sodium azide and stored at 4°C.
Far Western Overlay
The overlay assays were carried out as described by Moorhead et al. [20]. In brief, after SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting blots were probed with DIG labelled 14-3-3 proteins and HRP-labelled anti-DIG antibody (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ECL
was used for detection.
Immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation experiments, hydra cellular
lysates were made in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1%
Chaps, phosphatase- and protease inhibitors). Lysates
were incubated with 5 μg of the anti-14-3-3 antibody K19
(Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4°C. Protein A (Amersham Biosciences) was added and the samples were incubated for
an additional hour at 4°C. Samples were then spun down
and pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and
one time with Tris buffer. After addition of SDS loading
buffer, the proteins were separated by SDS PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. In cases when peptide C
was used, hydra lysates were incubated with 1 mM peptide C for 2 h at 4°C prior to immunoprecipitation. In
samples treated with phosphatase, the lysates were incubated with 200 U λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs)
for 30 min at 30°C prior to immunoprecipitation.
Expression of GFP fusion proteins in Hydra
To transiently express GFP-fusion proteins in hydra, the
corresponding genes were introduced into hydra using the
PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System (Biorad) as
described in [23]. Briefly, 20 μg of DNA was added to 3
mg of gold particles (1 μm diameter) and precipitated
with 0.3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 vol ethanol. Coated
particles were washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in
200 μl ethanol, and spread onto carrier disks according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Hydra were collected in
petri dishes and as much medium as possible was withdrawn. The animals were then shot 3 times with the gold
particles. 2–3 days after transformation animals were
screened for expression of the GFP fusion protein.

Immunofluorescence
For immunofluorescence animals were relaxed in 2% urethane for 2 min and then fixed for 1 h at room temperature with Lavdovsky (formaldehyde : acetic acid : ethanol
: water 5:2:25:20). After fixation animals were permeabilised in 0.5% Triton X-100 and unspecific binding sites
were blocked with 1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100. Incubation with primary antibody was carried out over night at
4°C in blocking solution, followed by washes with phosphate buffered saline and incubation with fluorescently
labelled secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature.
Animals were counterstained with TO-PRO3 (Molecular
Probes) and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) to prevent bleaching. Animals were analysed by confocal microscopy.
Confocal microscopy
Light optical serial sections were acquired with a Leica
(Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg) TCS SP confocal laser
scanning microscope equipped with an oil immersion
Plan-Apochromat 100/1.4 NA objective lens. Fluorochromes were visualised with an argon laser with excitation wavelengths of 488 nm, emission filter 520–540 nm
(for FITC) and with a helium-neon laser with excitation
wavelength of 633 nm, and emission filter 660–760 nm
(for TO-PRO3 and TRITC). Two fluorochromes and the
phase contrast image (transmission filter) were scanned
sequentially. Image resolution was 512 × 512 pixel with a
pixel size ranging from 195 to 49 nm depending on the
selected zoom factor. The axial distance between optical
sections was 300–500 nm for zoom factor 4 and 1 μm for
zoom factor 1. To obtain an improved signal-to-noise
ratio each section image was averaged from four successive scans. The 8-bit greyscale single channel images were
overlayed to an RGB image assigning a false colour to each
channel, and then assembled into tables using ImageJ
1.32j and Adobe PhotoShop 5.5 software.
GST-pulldown
14-3-3HyA and 14-3-3HyB were cloned into the plasmid
pRSET, expressed in bacteria and purified as described
previously [18]. Hybcl-2-like1 was cloned into the vector
pGEX and expression of GST-Hybcl-2-like1 or GST-Hyinnexin 1 as a control was induced. Equal amounts of bacterial lysates were incubated with glutathione-sepharose
beads for 2 h at room temperature under constant agitation. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation,
washed and subsequently incubated with the purified
Hydra 14-3-3 proteins for 2 h at room temperature under
constant agitation. After centrifugation and washing with
PBS, bound proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
with anti-Xpress (for proteins expressed from pRSET) and
anti-GST antibodies (27457701, GE Healthcare).

Results
Hydra has four 14-3-3 isoforms
Two 14-3-3 isoforms, HyA and HyB, have previously been
isolated from Hydra by RT-PCR [18]. By searching the now
available Hydra EST database (ca. 170 000 sequences) we
have identified two additional 14-3-3 isoforms, which we
named 14-3-3 HyC and 14-3-3 HyD. Alignment of all four
14-3-3 proteins from Hydra with human 14-3-3 γ shows
that the basic features of 14-3-3 proteins are well conserved in the Hydra sequences including nine α-helices
and a number of amino acids lining the amphipathic
groove which constitutes the binding site for 14-3-3 target
proteins [24]. In Fig. 1 amino acids of the hydrophobic
surface of the groove are shown with circles above the
alignment. These are completely conserved in all four 143-3 isoforms from Hydra. Amino acids on the basic face of
the groove are indicated with asterisks. They are also conserved except for the arginine in helix 5, which is replaced
by threonine in 14-3-3 HyD. This would probably have
implications for the binding of target proteins to this isoform.

We have also identified four 14-3-3 isoforms in the
recently completed genome of another cnidarian, the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis. We have named these
proteins 14-3-3 NemA, 14-3-3 NemB, 14-3-3 NemC and
14-3-3 NemD with reference to the Hydra isoforms. A
phylogenetic tree including representatives of all known
plant and animal isoforms as well as sequences from
Chlamydomonas,
Dictyostelium,
Saccharomyces
and
Schizosaccharomyces in addition to the cnidarian sequences
is presented in Fig. 2. It shows that the eight cnidarian 143-3 proteins do not fall into the established isoform
groups. Among themselves, however, they seem to form
three groups, which separated very early. This correlates
with the ancient separation of anthozoans and hydrozoans. The number and diversity of Hydra and Nematostella 14-3-3 proteins distinguishes the 14-3-3 repertoires
in cnidarians from them in other invertebrates. Drosophila
and C. elegans each have only two 14-3-3 proteins and
these are grouped with metazoan isoforms [18].
Isolation of 14-3-3 binding proteins from hydra lysates
In Far Western overlays with DIG labelled 14-3-3 probes
we have previously shown the presence of a large number
of 14-3-3 binding proteins in hydra extracts. Binding to
14-3-3 was dependent on the phosphorylation of these
targets and it involved the conserved binding pocket of
14-3-3 proteins because it could be blocked with the
phosphorylated 14-3-3 consensus peptide ARAApSAPA
[18]. To establish the molecular identity of these target
proteins we isolated them using a 14-3-3-affinity column.
Extracts were prepared from ca. 100,000 hydra. These
were incubated with 14-3-3 (Bmh1/2 from yeast) coupled
sepharose and the mixture was packed into a column

NCBI. Helices 1-9 are indicated. Conserved amino acids that have been shown in the crystal structure to constitute the binding
groove for target proteins are indicated with asterisks (basic face of the groove) and circles (hydrophobic surface) above the

and from Nematostella. The cnidarian isoforms are printed in bold, Nem = Nematostella, Hy = Hydra.

(described in [19]). The column was washed extensively
with 50 mM HEPES, 0.5 MNaCl, 1 mM DTT, and then
with an unrelated phosphopeptide (-WFYpSFLE-). Elution of 14-3-3 binding proteins was carried out with 1 mM
of phosphorylated peptide C (-ARAApSAPA-) which constitutes a consensus binding site for 14-3-3 proteins and
thus competes with target proteins for binding to 14-3-3
[3,24]. The eluted proteins were concentrated, separated
in SDS-PAGE and probed with DIG labelled 14-3-3. Fig.
3A shows the presence of about 20 14-3-3-binding proteins specifically enriched in the final eluate (lane 5). To
analyse these proteins they were stained with coomassie
(Fig. 3B). Visible bands were then cut out, the proteins
eluted and digested with trypsin. For protein identification, probes were directly used for nano-ESI-LC-MS/MS.
The resulting spectra were analyzed with the Mascot™
Software (Matrix Science) using a Hydra protein database.

Hydra peptides generated from the EST data (see Materials
and Methods) were trypsinised in silico. The masses of the
tryptic peptides were calculated and compared with the
MALDI mass data of the isolated 14-3-3 binding proteins.
This allowed identification of 23 proteins. These are
shown in Table 1. The identity of the isolated proteins is
given in column 1. Column 2 indicates the overall LC-MS
score and the number of peptides for which sequencing
data were obtained. We then compared the molecular
weights of the identified proteins with their sizes deduced
from their position in SDS-PAGE. In two cases where the
EST sequence did not encode a full-length cDNA, the sizes
of the human (hs) or Drosophila (dm) homologues are
indicated. All identified proteins corresponded in size
with the expected molecular weight of their bands in SDSPAGE. Moreover, 13 of the proteins had 14-3-3 binding
motifs, 11 had been previously reported in the literature

to bind to 14-3-3 in plant or animal cells [25-32]. Two of
the previously unknown 14-3-3 binding partners are proteins that have so far been exclusively found in Hydra.
Identified 14-3-3 binding proteins
Cytoskeletal proteins
One group of the identified Hydra 14-3-3 binding proteins is part of the cytoskeleton (tubulin α and β, actin,
tropomyosin). We have confirmed the interaction of
tubulin with 14-3-3 in an immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the interaction was only very
weakly inhibited by peptide C or phosphatase treatment.
This could suggest that the interaction is very strong and
bound 14-3-3 protein shields the phosphate group from
the phosphatase. Alternatively 14-3-3 might bind to tubulin indirectly or via an uncharacterised mechanism. For βtubulin, which contains a classical 14-3-3 binding motif,
this would be unexpected. It is, however, possible that the
antibody used in the immunoprecipitation experiment
preferentially recognises α-tubulin.

In order to further confirm the interaction of 14-3-3 with
components of the Hydra cytoskeleton we performed double immunofluorescence with anti-tubulin and anti-14-33 antibodies. The result is shown in Fig. 5 panels a and b.
14-3-3 shows the punctate distribution in macerated epithelial cells that we have described previously [18]. These
structures are partially co-localised with microtubules
(Fig. 5 panels a and b, merge, indicated by arrows) indicating that an interaction of 14-3-3 and tubulin takes
place only at specific locations on microtubuli. Tubulin
has been isolated as a 14-3-3 binding protein in two previous proteomic screens [32,33]. In one of those screens
the same approach as used in our study had been taken
with a Bmh1/2 affinity column to purify 14-3-3 binding
proteins from HeLa cell extracts. The other study used
HEK293 cells constitutively expressing Flag-tagged
human 14-3-3 γ and binding proteins were captured by
immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognised
the Flag-tag. Direct interaction between tubulin and 14-33 proteins has not been demonstrated so far in mammals
or in Hydra and our experiments do not exclude the possibility that we are looking at larger protein complexes
containing 14-3-3 and tubulin. Microtubule associated
proteins have been shown to bind to 14-3-3 previously,
e.g. tau. In this case, however, the interactions between tau
and tubulin or 14-3-3 ζ were mutually exclusive [34,35].
To look for co-localisation of 14-3-3 HyA and 14-3-3 HyB
with the actin cytoskeleton we used cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged 14-3-3 proteins and counterstained them with rhodamine-phalloidin. Fig. 5, panels c
and d, show sections through the basal part of 14-3-3
HyA-GFP and 14-3-3 HyB-GFP expressing ectodermal epithelial cells, respectively. Actin filaments are present in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/31

muscle processes of these epithelial muscle cells. A small
fraction of both 14-3-3-GFP isoforms was seen co-localised with phalloidin in these processes. Fig. 5, panel e,
shows sections through the apical end of an ectodermal
epithelial cell expressing 14-3-3 HyB-GFP. The phalloidin
signal representing cortical actin co-localises especially
strongly with 14-3-3 HyB-GFP at the cell boundaries
(white arrows).
Interaction of actin with 14-3-3 has also been described in
the past. In primary cultures of cerebral cortical astrocytes
14-3-3 γ was associated with actin filaments and this association was lost under conditions of actin reorganisation
during mitosis and actin disruption in apoptotic cells
[27]. By stabilising phospho-cofilin 14-3-3 plays an
important role in actin filament turnover in motile cells
[36]. Rearrangement of cortical actin prior to secretion of
exocytic vesicles has also been shown to depend on 14-33 proteins [37,38]. In yeast, disruption of 14-3-3 signalling by overexpression of a dominant negative 14-3-3 variant or of a temperature sensitive 14-3-3 mutant at the
restrictive temperature has dramatic effects on the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton [39,40].
Calcium binding proteins
Three Ca2+ binding proteins (calmodulin, Ca2+ binding
protein and Ca2+ adaptor AIF1 (allograft inflammatory
factor 1)) constitute a second group of the identified
hydra 14-3-3 binding proteins. Interaction of calmodulin
with human 14-3-3 ε had been shown previously in
human cells [30]. The consequences of this interaction are
not very well known. With respect to a role for 14-3-3 proteins in Ca2+ signalling pathways some examples in the literature describe interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with targets
that are phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin dependent
kinase, e.g. the photoreceptor regulating protein phosducin [41] and the histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) [42].
Alternatively, such a 14-3-3 binding site can also be abolished by a Ca2+stimulated phosphatase as has been shown
for Ca2+activated nuclear factor of activated T-cells which
acts at the interleukin-2 promoter and is negatively regulated by 14-3-3 [43]. Moreover, Ca2+/calmodulin dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) is directly regulated by
binding to 14-3-3 after phosphorylation by PKA [44].

With the Hydra Ca2+ binding protein and the Ca2+ adaptor
AIF-1 we have discovered two new 14-3-3 target proteins
that are potential members of Ca2+ signalling pathways.
They both have an EF-hand Ca2+ binding motif. The
former is related to a family of flagellar Ca2+ binding proteins that is highly conserved in trypanosoma [45]. The
closest homolog of the Hydra Ca2+ adaptor protein AIF-1
is the allograft inflammatory factor 1 from the sponge
Suberites domuncula [46]. AIF-1, which was first discovered
in rat cardiac allografts undergoing chronic rejection, has

Protein scores and numbers of identified peptides from analysis of mass spectra using Mascot™ Software are given in column 2, columns 3 and 4
compare the molecular weights of the identified proteins with the apparent molecular weights of these proteins on the SDS-PAGE gel from which
they had been cut out for analysis. In column 5 the presence of a conserved 14-3-3 binding motif in the sequence of the identified proteins is
indicated [2, 3]. Column 6 lists citations that have described interactions of 14-3-3 proteins with plant or animal homologues of the identified
proteins before. Abbreviations: dm: Drosophila melanogaster; hs: Homo sapiens

thus homologs in vertebrates and lower invertebrates
[47]. In higher animals it plays a role in vascular remodelling and repair which probably involves induction of
actin polymerisation in vascular smooth muscle cells and
is dependent on an intact EF-hand motif [48,49]. The discovery of these two new 14-3-3 target proteins suggests a
broader role of 14-3-3 proteins in Ca2+ signalling.
PPOD
PPOD 3 and 4 belong to a novel protein family found
only in Hydra [50,51]. These proteins possess fascin
domains and are localised in secretory granules. They are
secreted proteins as was shown in a recent genetic screen
for signal peptides in Hydra [22]. Moreover, they are able
to agglutinate erythrocytes and thus may have lectin character (Pauly 2006, unpublished observations). They represent novel 14-3-3 binding proteins. In this context it is
interesting to note that 14-3-3 target proteins have been
isolated from organelles like mitochondria, chloroplasts

or Golgi vesicles and secreted forms of 14-3-3 proteins
have also been described [32,52-55]. Their sorting however remains enigmatic since 14-3-3 proteins do not have
a signal peptide for targeting them to any of these
organelles.
Metabolic enzymes
Finally, seven of the identified 14-3-3 binding proteins are
metabolic enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (glyceraldehydephosphate
dehydrogenase
(GAPDH,
EC1.2.1.12.),
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
(PEPCK), fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase), in protein
synthesis and folding (EF-2, elongation factor 1 α, eIF-3 β)
or ATP synthesis (ATP-synthase, [25]). The interactions of
14-3-3 with fructose-1,6-aldolase and PEPCK have been
seen for the first time in our study. In contrast, the classical
glycolytic enzyme GAPDH has been shown to bind to 143-3 proteins in several organisms, including wheat [26],
cauliflower [19] and human HeLa cells [32]. Studying the

significance of the 14-3-3/GAPDH interaction is complicated by the fact that GAPDH is a multifunctional protein.
In addition to its participation in carbohydrate metabolism it also plays roles in membrane fusion, microtubule
bundling, nuclear RNA export, DNA repair, DNA replication, translational regulation, and apoptosis (reviewed by
[56-58]). Interestingly, GAPDH is translocated to the
nucleus early in apoptosis and nuclear overexpression of
this enzyme potently induces cell death [59,60]. Serum
withdrawal (or growth factor deprival) also leads to
nuclear translocation of GAPDH. This is regulated by a
PI(3)kinase dependent pathway [61]. However, at the
moment we don't know anything about the significance
of 14-3-3 binding to GAPDH in animal cells. In Arabidopsis cells it was shown that 14-3-3 stabilises metabolic
enzymes when they are needed. In sugar starved cells 143-3 binding is lost and this leads to rapid degradation of
metabolic 14-3-3 target proteins [28]. Such a clear picture
does not exist for any of the metabolic 14-3-3 target proteins that have recently been found in large screens in
mammalian cells [32,33]. Nevertheless, the identification
of 14-3-3 binding enzymes that are directly involved in
carbohydrate metabolism in Hydra together with the previously described redistribution of 14-3-3 proteins in

starving animals [18] strengthen our hypothesis that
growth regulation in response to nutrition in Hydra could
involve 14-3-3 proteins.
14-3-3 HyA interacts with one Hydra Bcl-2 family member
Several members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators are known to bind to 14-3-3, e.g. Bax and the BH-3
only protein Bad. Hence we had anticipated finding these
among proteins eluted from the 14-3-3 affinity column.
Our failure to do so could have been due to low abundance of these proteins in the extracts. We searched the
Hydra EST database to confirm the presence of Bcl-2 family members in Hydra and identified seven bcl-2 like
sequences and two bak homologues (Lasi and Pauly, manuscript in preparation) but no BH-3 only proteins like
Bad. For three of these proteins we obtained complete
cDNAs by RT-PCR (not shown). These have been submitted to GenBank, accession numbers are: Hybcl-2-like1
(EF104645), Hybak-like (EF104646), Hybcl-2-like2
(EF104647). HyBcl-2-like1 contained the sequence
RTFTKP, a conserved 14-3-3-binding motif [3], in its Cterminus. Work in vertebrate cells has shown that the
interaction of Bax with 14-3-3 proteins is not dependent
on phosphorylation of Bax [15,62]. If this was true for the

hydra protein it might not have been expected to be eluted
from the 14-3-3 affinity column with the phosphorylated
peptide C. In order to test the possibility that Hybcl-2like1 could be a target for 14-3-3 we carried out a GST
pulldown assay with bacterially expressed 14-3-3 HyA and
14-3-3 HyB. GST-Hybcl-2-like1 was incubated with purified N-terminally His-tagged 14-3-3 HyA and 14-3-3 HyB,
respectively. As shown in Fig. 6 14-3-3 HyA could be
pulled down with GST-Hybcl-2-like1 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, neither 14-3-3 HyB nor Hyinnexin (control) were
precipitated. The presence of equal amounts of the GST
fusion proteins in all eluates was confirmed by probing
the samples with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 6B). Thus, 14-33 HyA specifically interacts with Hybcl-2-like1. This specificity may have been another reason why we did not find
this protein in the affinity purification experiment, which
had been carried out with yeast 14-3-3 proteins. However,
the GST-pulldown indicates that 14-3-3 proteins in Hydra
also have potential targets in the Bcl-2 family of pro- and
anti-apoptotic proteins.

Conclusion
In a proteomic screen we have identified 23 14-3-3 binding proteins in the early metazoan Hydra. They fall into
several groups, including cytoskeletal proteins, proteins
implicated in Ca2+ signalling and, interestingly, proteins
involved in protein synthesis and metabolism. Moreover,
we showed that one 14-3-3 Hydra isoform can interact
with the Bcl-2 family member Hybcl-2-like1 in vitro. The
functional implications of 14-3-3 binding to these metabolic and apoptotic target proteins have not been investigated yet. It is possible that some of these proteins are
phosphorylated by PKB. PKB has been identified in Hydra
[63]. Moreover, hydra cells are sensitive to inactivation of
PKB signalling with the PI(3) kinase inhibitor wortmannin, which induces massive apoptosis [64]. This raises the
possibility that survival factor signalling is involved in the
adaptation of hydra growth to food supply and that 14-33 proteins mediate this response both on the level of metabolic control and on the level of apoptosis induction.

On a wider perspective our study has made it clear that 143-3 targets in the early metazoan Hydra are as diverse as in
higher animals, including humans. Our screen only
allowed detection of the most abundant target proteins
and yet they contained members of groups of proteins
with diverse functions such as metabolism, cytoskeletal
regulation, Ca2+-signalling and apoptosis. It thus appears
that the ubiquitous presence of 14-3-3-proteins in all
eukaryotic organisms studied so far is accompanied by a
wide diversity of target proteins even in the simplest metazoans.
