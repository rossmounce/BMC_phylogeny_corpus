Abstract
Background: Venom variation occurs at all taxonomical levels and can impact significantly upon the clinical
manifestations and efficacy of antivenom therapy following snakebite. Variation in snake venom composition is thought
to be subject to strong natural selection as a result of adaptation towards specific diets. Members of the medically
important genus Echis exhibit considerable variation in venom composition, which has been demonstrated to co-evolve
with evolutionary shifts in diet. We adopt a venom gland transcriptome approach in order to investigate the diversity of
toxins in the genus and elucidate the mechanisms which result in prey-specific adaptations of venom composition.
Results: Venom gland transcriptomes were created for E. pyramidum leakeyi, E. coloratus and E. carinatus sochureki by
sequencing ~1000 expressed sequence tags from venom gland cDNA libraries. A standardised methodology allowed a
comprehensive intra-genus comparison of the venom gland profiles to be undertaken, including the previously described
E. ocellatus transcriptome. Blast annotation revealed the presence of snake venom metalloproteinases, C-type lectins,
group II phopholipases A2, serine proteases, L-amino oxidases and growth factors in all transcriptomes throughout the
genus. Transcripts encoding disintegrins, cysteine-rich secretory proteins and hyaluronidases were obtained from at least
one, but not all, species. A representative group of novel venom transcripts exhibiting similarity to lysosomal acid lipase
were identified from the E. coloratus transcriptome, whilst novel metallopeptidases exhibiting similarity to neprilysin and
dipeptidyl peptidase III were identified from E. p. leakeyi and E. coloratus respectively.
Conclusion: The comparison of Echis venom gland transcriptomes revealed substantial intrageneric venom variation in
representations and cluster numbers of the most abundant venom toxin families. The expression profiles of established
toxin groups exhibit little obvious association with venom-related adaptations to diet described from this genus. We
suggest therefore that alterations in isoform diversity or transcript expression levels within the major venom protein
families are likely to be responsible for prey specificity, rather than differences in the representation of entire toxin
families or the recruitment of novel toxin families, although the recruitment of lysosomal acid lipase as a response to
vertebrate feeding cannot be excluded. Evidence of marked intrageneric venom variation within the medically important
genus Echis strongly advocates further investigations into the medical significance of venom variation in this genus and its
impact upon antivenom therapy.

Background
Snake venoms contain a complex mix of components,
with biologically active proteins and peptides comprising
the vast majority [1]. Variation in the composition of
venom occurs at several taxonomical levels in multiple
snake lineages [reviewed in [2,3]]. The view that variation
in venom composition evolves primarily through neutral
evolutionary processes [4-6] is not supported by other
reports that snake venom composition is subject to strong
natural selection as a result of adaptation towards specific
diets [e.g. [7-10]]. Since the primary role of venom is to
aid prey capture [2], it is perhaps unsurprising that variation in the protein composition of venom has been associated with significant dietary shifts in a number of genera
[9-12]. Irrespective of the evolutionary forces underpinning venom protein composition, variation in venom
components can significantly impact upon the clinical
manifestations of snake envenoming [13-15] and,
because the clinical efficacy of an antivenom may be
largely restricted to the venom used in its manufacture,
the success of antivenom therapy [16-18].
Envenoming by saw-scaled viper (Viperidae: Echis) species
is thought to be responsible for more snakebite deaths
worldwide than any other snake genus [19]. Envenomed
victims typically suffer a combination of systemic and
local haemorrhagic symptomatologies and up to 20%
mortality rates without antivenom treatment [19-21].
Whilst the clinical symptoms are largely consistent
throughout this widely distributed genus [20], cases of
incomplete intrageneric antivenom efficacy have been
documented, implying substantial inter-species venom
variation [18,22-24]. We demonstrated that the four species complexes making up this genus, the E. carinatus, E.
ocellatus, E. pyramidum and E. coloratus species groups
[10,25], exhibit considerable vertebrate or invertebrate
dietary preferences, E. coloratus being a vertebrate specialist whereas invertebrates feature prominently in the diet
of the others. Since the proportions of consumed invertebrates correlated strongly with alterations in venom toxicity to scorpions, we believe the toxicity of the venom from
these species to have co-evolved alongside evolutionary
shifts in diet [10]. A preliminary venom protein analysis
using reduced SDS-PAGE failed to identify an obvious
link between venom composition and diet [10], justifying
the use of a more comprehensive venom composition
analysis in order to elucidate the mechanisms driving
venom adaptations within the Echis viper genus.
Based on our earlier work with E. ocellatus [26], a comparative venom gland transcriptome approach was elected
and we generated venom gland cDNA libraries from E. coloratus, E. pyramidum leakeyi and E. carinatus sochureki.
Together with the existing E. ocellatus database, these provided DNA sequence data representing the venom gland

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/564

transcriptomes for each of the four major species groups
within the genus. The production of multiple Echis venom
gland expressed sequence tag databases (vgDbEST) provides an unbiased overview of the transcriptional activity
during venom synthesis in the venom glands of four species in this genus. This, the first comprehensive compilation of venom gland transcriptomes of congeneric snake
species, was then interrogated to determine whether the
mechanisms resulting in prey-specific adaptation of
venom composition involve (i) the recruitment of novel
prey-specific venom toxin transcripts, (ii) major changes
in the expression levels of established toxin families, (iii)
the diversification of functional isoforms within established toxin families or (iv) a combination of these factors.

Results
EST data provides a powerful insight into the transcriptional activity of a tissue at a particular time point. Our
protocols for the generation of venom gland EST databases provide a snapshot of transcriptional activity in the
venom gland 3 days after venom expulsion, when transcription peaks [27] in preparation for new venom synthesis. Although each individual venom transcript cannot be
correlated with the mature venom proteome without considerable extra experimental verification, our own work
with E. ocellatus [28] shows there is a good general accordance between the venom proteome and that predicted
from the venom gland transcriptome. Thus, whilst a cautionary approach is required when interpreting a correlation between transcriptome and proteome, the sensitivity
and unbiased nature of venom gland transcriptome surveys can be valuable in the identification of rare, unusual
or potentially novel toxins and their isoforms that are difficult to detect in the proteome [29].
To provide a representative overview of the transcriptional
variation in venom components in each species, whilst
minimising compositional bias arising from intraspecific
variation in venom composition, venom gland cDNA
libraries were based on ten specimens of variable size and
gender. Generated ESTs were clustered under high stringency conditions to assemble overlapping single sequence
reads into full length gene objects where possible. Using
BLAST, 80-93% of gene objects for each library were
assigned a functional annotation based upon significant
(>1e-05) scores against multiple databases. The majority
of annotated ESTs (61-74%) were assigned to clusters representing distinct gene objects (additional file 1). The proportion of toxin encoding transcripts (enzymes and nonenzymatic toxins) assigned by BLAST homology, was typically greater than those encoding non-toxin transcripts
(for example, those involved in cellular biosynthetic processes) and unidentified components (i.e. with no significant hit against the databases) (Figure 1). There were twice

the numbers of unidentified ESTs in the E. c. sochureki
vgDbESTs than in any of the other Echis vgDbESTs. As the
bulk of these unidentified ESTs were singletons, not clustered gene objects, we interpret this to result from
increases in unidentified 3' untranslated regions rather
than unidentified novel toxin transcripts. The annotated
venom toxin encoding profiles for the four Echis species
revealed substantial variation in (i) the inferred expression levels and (ii) the cluster diversity within many toxin
families (Figure 2, additional file 2). The details and
potential implications of this species-specific variation in
the representation of each toxin family will be discussed
in turn.
Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMP)
The SVMP transcripts were the most abundant and divergent (in terms of cluster numbers) Echis venom toxin family (Figure 2) and comprised roughly half of the total
toxin transcripts (Figure 1). The SVMPs are a diverse group
of enzymes classified into those comprising only the metalloproteinase domain (PI) and those sequentially
extended by a disintegrin domain (PII), a disintegrin-like

and cysteine-rich domain (PIII) and the latter co-valently
linked to C-type lectin-like components (PIV) [30].
Known and suspected modifications in domain structure
are thought to account for the wide range of SVMP pathological activities, including haemorrhage, coagulopathy,
fibrinolysis and prothrombin activation [30-32].
There were more PIII SVMP clusters in the genus Echis
than any other toxin family clusters. The presence of
apparent, extensive PIII SVMP gene diversification hints
that evolutionary pressures are acting to increase the functional diversity of this SVMP group, highlighting their
fundamental biological importance to the genus. In contrast, PI SVMP transcripts were present, albeit at low levels,
only in the E. coloratus and E. ocellatus vgDbESTs. While
the diversity of the PII SVMPs was substantially lower than
that of the PIII SVMPs, their abundance differed between
species. Thus, 80% of total E. p. leakeyi SVMP transcripts
were PIIs (cluster EPL00005 comprised 38% of all SVMPs)
and, although less numerically significant, 38% of the E.
coloratus SVMPs were also PIIs. Despite intrageneric variation in abundance and diversity, analysis of PII contigu-

ous sequences throughout the genus revealed the
ubiquitous representation of motifs (RGD, KGD and
VGD) involved in binding to the αIIbβ3, αvβ3 and
α5β1integrins implicated in platelet aggregation inhibition [33,34]. The RGD-only representation of E. p. leakeyi
PII SVMPs implies evolutionary conservation of this particular disintegrin motif, in contrast to the gene diversification observed in the PIIIs. We assigned some PIII SVMP
transcripts as putative PIV SVMPs according to the presence of an additional cysteine residue in the cysteine-rich
region at positions 397 or 400 [[28,30] (numbering from
30)]. These transcripts also form strongly supported
monophyletic groups (data not shown) with homologues
of SVMP PIVs previously characterised from venom proteomes; two of the three putative E. coloratus PIVs
(ECO00075 & ECO00144) show the greatest sequence
similarity to PIV SVMPs characterised from Macrovipera
lebetina and Daboia russelii respectively [UniProt:Q7T046
and Q7LZ61], whereas all other Echis PIVs showed greatest similarity to the previously characterised E. ocellatus
PIV SVMP, EOC00024 [28]. The relative representation of
these putative PIV SVMPs was substantially greater in E.

ocellatus (EOC00024 - 23% and EOC00022 -7%) than E.
coloratus and E. c. sochureki (<4%); no PIV SVMPs were
found in the E. p. leakeyi vgDbEST. Taken together, this
implies that two divergent forms of PIV SVMPs may be
uniquely present in E. coloratus, despite their low representation in this species.
We (SCW, RAH) recently identified a new E. ocellatus
cDNA precursor encoding numerous QKW tripeptides
and a polyH/G peptide that have potent SVMP-inhibiting
activities [35]. Representatives of this SVMP inhibitory
transcript were identified in each Echis vgDbEST (data not
shown), but no correlation was identified between the
proportional representation of the Echis SVMPs and their
SVMP inhibitory transcripts.
Disintegrins
Snake venom disintegrins are derived either from proteolytic processing of PII SVMP precursors [36] or are
encoded by discreet PII-derived disintegrin-only genes,
containing only a signal peptide and a disintegrin domain
- previously described as 'short coding' disintegrins

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:564

[37,38]. Representation of short coding disintegrins in the
Echis genus is variable; small clusters were found in E. c.
sochureki (4% and 3% of toxin transcripts) and E. coloratus
(5%), whilst only a singleton transcript was found in E. p.
leakeyi. Despite not being represented in the original E.
ocellatus vgDbEST, we previously identified, by PCR, a
sequence encoding the short coding disintegrin ocellatusin from this species [39], confirming the presence of
short coding disintegrin transcripts throughout the Echis
genus.
C-type lectins (CTL)
The CTLs proved to be the next most abundant and
diverse (by cluster numbers) group of Echis venom toxin
encoding transcripts. As argued for the SVMPs, the substantial CTL cluster diversity and implied functional diversity would be consistent with the known variation in CTL
activity. Thus, CTL isoforms typically act synergistically as
homologous or heterologous multimers to promote or
inhibit platelet aggregation and/or target distinct elements of the coagulation cascade [see [40,41]]. Each of
the Echis species showed considerable CTL diversity (1024% toxin encoding transcripts), with E. p. leakeyi exhibiting both the largest number of ESTs and cluster-diversity.
Notably, clusters showing similarity to echicetin α and β,
a platelet aggregation-inhibitor isolated from E. c. sochureki [42,43], were found throughout the Echis genus and
are the most represented CTLs in both E. c. sochureki and
E. p. leakeyi. Recently, E. ocellatus echicetin-like CTLs were
demonstrated to be associated with forming the quaternary structure of PIV E. ocellatus SVMPs [28]. However,
PIV SVMPs are absent from the E. p. leakeyi vgDbEST and
present in only small numbers in E. c. sochureki (2%),
implying that PIV-related binding may not be the sole
function of echicetin. In contrast, each of the Echis vgDbESTs (except for E. p. leakeyi) contained clusters showing
high sequence similarity to another PIV-related CTL, Factor X activator light chain 2 from M. lebetina [44], producing an Echis representational profile of CTLs matching
that of the PIV SVMPs.
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
Group II PLA2s are ubiquitously expressed in Echis species
[45]. Echis PLA2s have been demonstrated to inhibit platelet aggregation and induce oedema, neurotoxicity and
myotoxicity through multiple isoforms exhibiting high
(Asp49) and low (Ser49) enzymatic activity [46-49].
Despite low representation and diversity in E. coloratus, E.
ocellatus and E. c. sochureki (5-8% of toxin transcripts), an
increase in representation (21%) and cluster diversity was
observed in E. p. leakeyi, suggesting an important role for
PLA2 activity in the venom of this species. Furthermore,
both enzymatic PLA2 variants are conserved throughout
the genus, highlighting the apparent importance of these
functionally-distinct isoforms - presumably for prey cap-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/564

ture. Given that Ser49 PLA2s have only been isolated from
the genera Vipera [50] and Echis [49], which are not sister
taxa [51], we would expect the presence of this isoform in
other members of the Viperinae. However, considering
the absence of Ser49 PLA2s from a Bitis gabonica vgDbEST
[38], we cannot rule out convergent evolution of this
myotoxic PLA2 type and its consequent functional importance in these genera.
Serine proteases (SP)
The snake venom serine proteases are a multi-gene
enzyme family acting upon platelet aggregation, blood
coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways [reviewed in [41]].
Considering the severe coagulopathy observed in victims
of Echis envenoming [19,31], the SPs are represented in
amounts lower than predicted (2-5% of toxin encoding
transcripts), particularly given their high representation in
other, albeit distantly related, Viperidae species [52,53].
Interestingly, variations in cluster diversity are considerable, with nine clusters of low representation identified in
E. coloratus compared to one in E. ocellatus. Despite low
levels of representation, the unique variation in cluster
diversity observed in E. coloratus implies multiple gene
duplication events within this lineage; a process that
underpins functional diversification in multi-gene venom
proteins [8,54].
L-amino oxidases (LAO)
Snake venom LAOs have been demonstrated to induce
apoptosis and inhibit platelet function [reviewed in [55]].
While the mechanisms for these actions remain predominately uncharacterised, it seems clear that, unlike other
snake venom toxin families, isoform diversity is not a
requirement. Thus, the low representation (1-4% of toxin
transcripts) observed in the Echis vgDbESTs is consistent
with other viperid venom gland transcriptomes
[26,38,52,53,56-59]. Indeed, the atypically high level of
sequence conservation between all the Echis LAOs and
those from other viperid genera (>80%) implies a conserved mechanism of action, whereby evolutionary pressures act to constrain diversification.
Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP)
Members of the snake venom CRISP family interact with
ion channels and exhibit the potential to block arterial
smooth muscle contraction and nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors [e.g. [60,61]]. The relative CRISP expression profiles vary considerably in the genus Echis, ranging from 5%
of toxin encoding transcripts in E. coloratus, less than 2%
in E. c. sochureki and E. ocellatus and none in E. p. leakeyi.
Given that CRISPs are typically underrepresented toxin
transcripts in Viperidae vgDbESTs [26,38,52,56-59], the
abundant representation observed in E. coloratus implies
an unidentified evolutionary pressure favouring transcriptional expression in this species. Its potential biological

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:564

significance is further highlighted by the apparent absence
of these toxins in the transcriptome of the most closely
related species, E. p. leakeyi, which differs strongly in diet
from E. coloratus [10].
Other toxin components
Clusters encoding vascular endothelial growth factors and
nerve growth factors were identified in small numbers
(additional file 2) throughout the genus and, like the
LAOs, each showed a high degree of sequence conservation. Similarly, and consistent with previous reports [62],
the sequence homology of the new hyaluronidase singleton ESTs of E. c. sochureki and E. ocellatus was also considerable, and extended to hylauronidase sequences of other
genera. It is apparent that evolutionary forces exist to conserve the sequence of this group of venom proteins, presumably because their role in disseminating venom toxins
by reducing the viscosity of the extracellular matrix [29] is
a universal requirement for prey 'knock-down'. Another
singleton EST from the E. c. sochureki vgDbEST exhibited
81% identity to a kunitz-type protease inhibitor isolated
from the elapid snake Austrelaps labialis [63]. Given the
phylogenetic distance between these species, homology
between these haemostatic disruptors is surprising, particularly since the singleton exhibited only 38% identity to
kunitz-type protease inhibitors identified from the Bitis
gabonica vgDbEST [38], a species closely related to Echis.
An additional number of peptidases and purine liberators
were identified as minor components in all but the E. ocellatus vgDbEST (Table 1). Despite their low representation
and inconsistent conservation throughout the genus, the
distinct biological activities of these components have
been reported to play a role in the pathology of viper
envenoming (Table 1), although these claims require
experimental confirmation.
Novel venom gland transcriptome components
We identified a cluster from the E. coloratus vgDbEST that
exhibited 64% identity to mammalian lysosomal acid
lipase/cholesteryl
ester
hydrolase
(LAL)
[UniProt:Q4R4S5]. The most critical function of LAL is to
modulate intracellular cholesterol metabolism by degrading cholesterol esters and triglycerides derived from low
density lipoproteins that are transported, via specific
receptors, into most cells [64,65]. Although LAL is a common enzyme in many lineages, this is the first time it has
been identified from a venomous animal. We interrogated
the vgDbESTs for other transcripts with annotations
related to lysosomal processes and singleton transcripts
were identified in multiple species (data not shown).
However, their quantities were considerably lower than
LAL suggesting to us that an association between venom
gland LAL and intracellular processes was unlikely. Furthermore, the identification of a signal peptide using SignalP v3.0 [66] and the comparable representation of this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/564

enzyme (2%) with other venom toxin encoding transcripts (e.g. SPs, LAOs, growth factors), strongly implies
these transcripts are a novel group of secreted venom components. Their biological contribution to the activity of E.
coloratus venom and the venom gland and expression in
other venomous snake genera is the subject of current
research in our laboratories.
In addition to the discovery of LAL, two singleton transcripts were identified (additional file 2) from the Echis
vgDbESTs as novel Serpentes zinc-dependent metallopeptidases [67]. A transcript exhibiting 67% identity to
human dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPPIII) [UniProt:Q53GT4] was identified in E. coloratus and a related
EST exhibiting 84% similarity to Neprilysin from Gallus
gallus [Uniprot:Q67BJ2] was identified in the E. p. leakeyi
vgDbEST. While signal peptides were absent from these
ESTs due to EST N-terminal truncation, the constitutive
physiological targets of their mammalian analogues indicate that these metallopeptidases may contribute to
pathology. Mammalian DPPIII exhibits particular affinity
for the degradation of hypertension-inducing peptides via
the inactivation and degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin III; the consequential reduction in vasoconstrictor
activity likely induces hypotension alongside thrombolysis, by reducing the activity of plasminogen activator
inhibitors that constrain fibrinolysis [68-70]. We previously reported that the E. ocellatus vgDbEST contained a
substantial number of novel, potentially hypotensive,
venom toxins termed the renin-like aspartic proteases
[26]. Neprilysin demonstrates affinity for a broader range
of physiological targets, including natriuretic, vasodilatory and neuro peptides [71]. Specific functional interactions include the termination of brain neuropeptides,
such as enkephalins and substance P, at peptidergic synapses [72], and the degradation of the hypotension-inducing atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) [71]. It is notable that
Neprilysin has been implicated in the inactivation of peptide transmitters and their modulators in vertebrates and
invertebrates [71,73], suggesting the potential for conserved neurotoxic activity across a range of prey species.

Discussion
The most numerically abundant venom toxin families in
the four Echis species were the SVMPs, CTLs, PLA2s, and
SPs. This is broadly consistent with previous viperid
venom gland analyses, although considerable intergeneric variations in the EST-inferred expression levels of
these toxin families have been observed [26,38,52,53,5659]. The correlation of toxin families identified from the
genus Echis and other viperid species support current theories of early venom toxin recruitment prior to the radiation of the Viperidae [74]. The absence of three finger
toxins from the Echis vgDbESTs is particularly notable as
their recent identification in other viper species [53,58]

implies the venom gland recruitment of these toxins
occurred prior to the divergence of the Viperidae; presumably these toxins have subsequently been lost in an ancestor of Echis. Consistent with the early, PCR-driven, reports
of accelerated evolution of venom serine proteases [75],
CTLs [76] and PLA2s [77], it is apparent from the Echis
genus vgDbESTs and those of other vipers that the evolutionary forces driving venom toxin recruitment in the
genus Echis have served to promote diversification in
some toxin lineages (PII and PIII SVMPs, CTLs) while in
comparison relatively low diversification exists in others
(PI and PIV SVMPs, PLA2s, LAOs, the growth factors, and
remaining minor venom components). Prey capture is
considered a major biological imperative driving the
venom toxin selection process. This project was undertaken to identify correlations between intrageneric dietary
preferences and transcript expression in order to elucidate
the influence dietary selection pressures may have on the
toxin composition of snake venoms.
(i) Recruitment of novel venom toxins and diet. The Echis
vgDbESTs reveal the recruitment of novel renin-like aspartic proteases in E. ocellatus [26], LAL and DPPIII in E. coloratus and Neprilysin in E. p. leakeyi. The potential
hypotensive role of venom aspartic proteases has been
discussed previously [26]. Whilst expression in the venom
proteome requires experimental verification, the presence
of a signal peptide suggests that LAL is more likely to be
secreted in the venom gland rather than acting as an intra-

cellular protein. LAL has been implicated in severe alveolar destruction following over-expression of these
enzymes in the lungs of mice [64]. Lipases such as LAL
and lipoprotein lipase may also contribute to an influx of
fatty acids into the brain by hydrolysing lipoproteins in
the microvascular system of the cerebral cortex [78]. The
suggestion that these fatty acids are then intra-cellularly
internalised within lysosomes [78] correlates with intriguing observations from E. coloratus induced pathology,
where increases in the size and numbers of lysosomes
within the neuronal tissue of guinea pigs were implicated
in neuron lysis and cerebral damage [79]. We infer from
the predominately vertebrate-only diet of E. coloratus and
the exclusive, yet substantial, representation of LAL in this
species (2% - equivalent to the SPs, LAOs and growth factors) that LALs may play a contributory, albeit not yet
understood, role in prey envenoming. As singletons, it is
more difficult to argue that the novel recruitments of
DPPIII and Neprilysin represent additional adaptations to
prey preference; as they are found in such low numbers it
is impossible to determine whether they are indeed novel
species-specific venom gland recruitments or are rare transcripts that remain undetected in other snake species. We
previously reported that invertebrate feeding likely
evolved as a basal trait in the genus Echis [10]. The absence
of genus-wide transcripts encoding novel putative venom
toxin families implies that the adaptation to invertebrate
feeding in Echis did not evolve as a consequence of recruiting novel invertebrate-specific venom toxins. However,

we cannot exclude the possibility that the novel recruitment of LAL into the E. coloratus venom gland transcriptome may result from the subsequent reversion to
vertebrate feeding observed in this species [10], particularly given the absence of these well represented putative
toxin transcripts in other members of the genus.
(ii) Changes in toxin family expression and diet. All the
major Echis venom toxin families (SVMP, CTL, PLA2, SP)
exhibited considerable intrageneric variation in transcriptional representation. Thus, the E. p. leakeyi vgDbEST was
notable for its absence of PI and PIV SVMPs, short coding
disintegrins and CRISPs and atypically abundant representation of PII SVMPs, CTLs and PLA2s. The CRISPs were
only represented by clusters in E. c. sochureki and E. coloratus, species whose vgDbESTs draw similarities, particularly in their high comparative expression of PIII SVMPs
and short coding disintegrins. The only distinguishing feature (in terms of transcript abundance) in the E. ocellatus
vgDbEST was the atypically high number of PIV SVMPs.
However, none of these toxin encoding expression profiles showed a clear association with diet. Most notably, E.
p. leakeyi and E. c. sochureki exhibit distinct toxin encoding
profiles (Figure 2), despite both species feeding predominately on invertebrates and exhibiting highly invertebratelethal venom [10].
(iii) Diversification of venom toxins and diet. The above
observations imply adaptations to diet are occurring
within venom toxin families rather than resulting from
changes in expression levels of entire toxin families. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is provided by substantial increases in representation of echicetin-like CTLs
(relative to other CTLs) in both E. p. leakeyi and E. c. sochureki, implying perhaps a significant role for these platelet
aggregation inhibitors in invertebrate prey capture. The
absence of PI SVMPs in these species perhaps suggests that
this SVMP isoform is more associated with a vertebrate
diet. Furthermore, a number of atypical observations
identified from the E. coloratus vgDbEST may be associated with a reversion to vertebrate feeding [10], including;
(i) increases in the representation of CRISPs, (ii) increases
in cluster diversity of the SPs and (iii) the identification of
putative novel venom toxins (LAL and DPPIII). However,
the general similarity between the toxin encoding expression profiles of E. c. sochureki and E. coloratus (Figure 2),
despite E. coloratus exhibiting a significant reduction in
venom toxicity to invertebrates [10], indicates that more
analytical molecular tools are required to determine
whether snake prey specificity is achieved through subtle
alterations in isoform expression levels within the major
venom toxin families. We are subjecting the Echis genus
vgDbEST data generated here to a phylogenetic analysis
on each toxin class to determine species-specific trends in
diversification, which will inform us whether multiple

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/564

levels of gene control in the Echis genus venom gland
(switching of transcriptional expression, gene duplication
conferring functional diversification and novel gene
expression) maybe responsible for evolutionary responses
to dietary pressures.
Correlations between variation in venom gland toxin
encoding profiles and snakebite symptomatologies from
the genus Echis are unclear, particularly given the similar,
predominately incoagulable and haemorrhagic, clinical
outcomes observed throughout the genus [19-21] and the
presence of multiple isoforms of toxin families implicated
in haemorrhage and coagulopathy. However, some observations of atypical symptoms can be tentatively explained;
substantial increases in PLA2 representation and the
unique presence of Neprilysin may correlate with the rare
manifestation of neurotoxicity observed in an E. pyramidum envenomation [22], whilst the putative function of
DPPIII may imply a contributory role in cases of hypotension observed following E. coloratus snakebite [20].
Venom gland transcriptome surveys provide valuable new
data that we are correlating with a proteomic analysis of
the venom from each Echis species. With this comprehensive description of the venom composition of each major
Echis lineage, we will identify, using proteomic (antivenomic) techniques [3], the extent to which the intrageneric
variation in venom composition impacts on the preclinical efficacy of commercially available antivenoms. We
hope that such analyses will (i) explain past antivenom
failures described following snakebite by members of this
medically important genus [18,22-24] and (ii) identify
the venom toxin mix required to generate an antivenom
with continent-wide clinical effectiveness against Echis
envenoming.

Conclusion
The first comprehensive comparison of intrageneric
venom gland transcriptomes reveals substantial venom
variation in the genus Echis. The observed variations in
venom toxin encoding profiles reveal little association
with venom adaptations to diet previously described from
this genus. We hypothesise that relatively subtle alterations in toxin expression levels within the major venom
toxin families are likely to be predominately responsible
for prey specificity, although we cannot rule out a contributory role for novel putative venom toxins, such as lysosomal acid lipase. The observation of substantial venom
variation within the medically important genus Echis
strongly advocates further investigations into the medical
significance of venom variation and its potential impact
upon antivenom therapy.

Methods
Venom gland cDNA libraries were constructed from ten
wild-caught specimens of Echis coloratus (Egypt), E. p.
leakeyi (Kenya)and E. c. sochureki (Sharjah, UAE), maintained in the herpetarium of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, using identical protocols described for the
construction of the venom gland cDNA library from E.
ocellatus [26]. Clones from the cDNA libraries were picked
randomly and sequenced (NERC Molecular Genetics
Facility, UK) using M13 forward primers.
Bioinformatic processing was carried out using the PartiGene pipeline [80] with the same protocols used previously [26]. Briefly, sequences were processed (to exclude
low quality, contaminating vector sequences and poly A+
tracts) using Trace2dbEST [81]. Subsequently, assembly
was undertaken in PartiGene version 3.0, using high stringency clustering parameters [26,81]. A total of 1070 (E.
coloratus), 1078 (E. p. leakeyi) and 1156 (E. c. sochureki)
processed ESTs were entered into respective species databases alongside the 883 ESTs generated from the E. ocellatus vgDbEST [26]. Assembled ESTs were BLAST annotated
against UniProt (v56.2), TrEMBL (v39.2) and separate
databases containing only Serpentes nucleotide and protein sequences derived from the same Uniprot/TrEMBL
release versions.
Clustering was performed incrementally (96 sequences
per round) to determine the number of sequences
required to construct a representative transcriptome (i.e.
the point where further sequencing only adds to existing
clusters). We estimate that a minimum of 800 EST
sequences were required to provide an accurate representation of the three vgDbESTs (additional file 3). For longer
clones (i.e. SVMPs), representatives of each cluster were
subject to primer walking to acquire sufficient sequence
data for isoform classification. SVMPs were characterised
based upon the presence or absence of additional
domains extending from the metalloproteinase domain
[30]. PIVs were distinguished from PIIIs by the presence of
an additional cysteine residue in the cysteine-rich region
at positions 397 or 400 [[28,30] (numbering from 30)].
Additional file 2 displays the catalogue of venom toxin
transcripts present in each of the four Echis vgDbESTs
based upon significant (>1e-05) BLAST annotation. Presentation of the fully assembled and annotated vgDbESTs
can be viewed at http://venoms.liv.ac.uk. The sequences
reported in this paper have also been submitted into
dbEST division of the public database GenBank: E. coloratus [GenBank: GR947900-GR948969], E. c. sochureki
[GenBank: GR948970-GR950126] and E. p. leakeyi [GenBank: GR950127-GR951204].
