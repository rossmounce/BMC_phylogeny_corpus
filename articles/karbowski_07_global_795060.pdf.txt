Abstract
Background: Information processing in the brain requires large amounts of metabolic energy, the
spatial distribution of which is highly heterogeneous, reflecting the complex activity patterns in the
mammalian brain.
Results: In this study, it was found, based on empirical data, that despite this heterogeneity, the
volume-specific cerebral glucose metabolic rate of many different brain structures scales with brain
volume with almost the same exponent: around -0.15. The exception is white matter, the
metabolism of which seems to scale with a standard specific exponent of -1/4. The scaling
exponents for the total oxygen and glucose consumptions in the brain in relation to its volume are
identical, at 0.86 ± 0.03, which is significantly larger than the exponents 3/4 and 2/3 that have been
suggested for whole body basal metabolism on body mass.
Conclusion: These findings show explicitly that in mammals: (i) volume-specific scaling exponents
of the cerebral energy expenditure in different brain parts are approximately constant (except
brain stem structures), and (ii) the total cerebral metabolic exponent against brain volume is
greater than the much-cited Kleiber's 3/4 exponent.
The neurophysiological factors that might account for the regional uniformity of the exponents and
for the excessive scaling of the total brain metabolism are discussed, along with the relationship
between brain metabolic scaling and computation.

Background
The brain is one of the most energy-expensive tissues in
the body [1-3], as it uses large amounts of metabolic
energy for information processing [4-7]. Because of this,
neural codes are constrained not only by a combination of
structural and functional requirements [8-17], but also by
energy demands [6,7,18-21]. In general, it has been
observed that increased synaptic signaling between neurons leads to higher energy consumption [22], a finding

that has been exploited in imaging experiments [23].
Although some theoretical progress has been made in
quantifying the contributions of different neurophysiological processes to the total metabolic expenditure of a
single neuron [20], the metabolism of large-scale neural
circuits has not been investigated quantitatively.
This study attempted to take the first steps in this direction, by studying global and regional in vivo brain meta-

Results
Oxygen and glucose are the main components involved in
the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is
used in cellular energetics [3,4,6], and therefore their rates
of utilization provide useful measures of brain metabolism. There are several mammalian species, spanning
more than three orders of magnitude in brain size, for
which in vivo brain metabolic data are available (see Methods).
The allometric laws characterizing global cerebral metabolism of oxygen and glucose are similar and yield an identical scaling exponent (0.86 ± 0.03) against brain volume
(Figure 1). It is important to note that this value is significantly larger (p ≤ 0.05) than the exponents 0.75 [1,24]
and 0.66 [25] found for whole-body mammalian metabolism in relation to body mass.
The cerebral cortex is a critical part of the brain responsible for integrating sensory information, and commanding
behavioral and cognitive tasks. Regions of the cerebral
cortex differ both in molecular detail and in biological
function, which is manifested in a non-uniform distribution of neuronal activity and energy utilization throughout the cortex (Clarke and Sokoloff [5] and Additional file
1). However, despite this heterogeneity, values of the scaling exponents of the regional volume-specific glucose utilization rates on brain volume (CMRglc; glucose cerebral
metabolic rate per brain region volume) are surprisingly
homogeneous; they are either exactly or close to -0.15
(Figure 2, Table 1). Consequently, the average specific glucose utilization rate of the whole cerebral cortex also
scales with brain volume with the exponent -0.15 ± 0.03
(Figure 2E), which is equivalent to the exponent 0.85 ±

It was found that the volume-specific exponents across
cerebral regions on brain volume are almost identical,
approximately -0.15. Consequently, the energy consumption of the entire brain tissue scales with brain volume,
with the exponent of approximately 0.86. The main neurophysiological factors that might cause the increase of
the latter exponent well above the putative Kleiber's scaling exponent of 0.75, characterizing whole-body energy
expenditure on body mass [24], are identified. The consequences of brain metabolic scaling on its informationprocessing capacity in the context of brain design are also
discussed.

allometric scaling to problems in biology [1], in particular
to whole-body metabolism [1,24], but surprisingly not to
cerebral metabolism. The goal of this study was to find, by
collecting and analyzing data, the metabolic scaling exponents of different parts of the brain and its global exponent.

Scaling of the total basal cerebral metabolism with

yields the following. (A) For the total oxygen consumption
rate, the scaling exponent was 0.86 ± 0.04 (y = 0.86x - 1.02,
R2 = 0.989, p < 10-4, n = 7), and its 95% confidence interval
was 0.75 to 0.96. (B) For the total glucose utilization rate, an
identical exponent 0.86 ± 0.03 was found (y = 0.86x - 0.09,
R2 = 0.994, p < 10-4, n = 10) and its 95% confidence interval
was 0.80 to 0.91.

Some subcortical structures of gray matter use half of the
energy used in the cortex (e.g., limbic structures in cat and
monkey; see Clarke and Sokoloff [5] and Additional file
1), yet almost all of them exhibit a similar scaling homogeneity, with metabolic specific exponents also around 0.15 (Figure 3, Table 1). The volume-specific metabolisms
of two brain stem structures (the superior colliculus,
involved in visual coordination, and the inferior colliculus, involved in auditory processing) seem to be excep-

The t-test showed that population mean of the exponents in the second column was significantly greater than the exponent -0.25 (p = 9 × 10-9,

tions, as they scale with brain size with the exponent of
approximately 0 (Table 1). This might be caused by their
highly variable activities (see Additional file 1), and we do
not know how other brain stem structures behave. The
high degree of allometric uniformity for the most of the
subcortical system is even more striking than that for the
cortex, as subcortical regions are much more diverse in
function and biophysical properties than cortical areas.
For example, the thalamus and hippocampus play very
different roles in the brain, the former mediating sensory
input to the cortex, whereas the latter is implicated in
memory processes, yet their scaling exponents and corresponding confidence intervals are almost identical (Figure
3A,B and Table 1).
The metabolism of white matter is about three-fold lower
than that of gray matter [4,5], and the results in Table 1
indicate that also their scaling exponents might differ. The
specific glucose metabolisms of the two main structures of
white matter (the corpus callosum and the internal capsule) scale similarly with brain volume with the average
exponent, of about -0.25 (Figure 4, Table 1). This value
resembles the specific scaling exponent of whole body
metabolism against body mass.

Discussion
The total metabolic exponent 0.86 ± 0.03, found for
unanesthetized mammalian brains, implies that cerebral
energy use increases more steeply with brain size than
does whole-body energy use with body size. This might be
a reason why brain size increases slower than its body size,
with the exponent 0.75 [26]. However, the metabolic
exponent 0.86 undermines Martin's [26,27] well-known
argument that the 0.75 scaling of brain size reflects allometric isometry between brain metabolic needs and its size
(exponent 1). Instead, the product of the exponents for
brain size on body size and brain metabolic rate on brain
size gives an exponent for brain metabolic needs on body
size of about 0.65, which is lower than the 0.75 expected
from the assumption of isometry. Thus, depending on the
scaling reference, the total brain metabolism scales either
above Kleiber's 0.75 exponent if in relation to brain mass,
or below this exponent if in relation to body mass. The
discovered uniformity, i.e. constancy, of the cerebral specific exponents in gray matter suggests a common principle underlying the basal metabolism of different brain
structures, which might be associated with the homogeneity of synaptic density throughout the gray matter [28,29].
This is covered in more detail later in the discussion.

metabolic scaling exponent had the following values: (A) -0.15 for thalamus (y = -0.15x + 0.03); (B) -0.14 for hippocampus (y =
-0.14x - 0.13), which represents limbic structures; (C) -0.15 for caudate (y = -0.15x + 0.02), which represents basal ganglia; (D)
-0.15 for cerebellum (y = -0.15x - 0.09).

In analyzing comparative allometry, some authors use
phylogenetic approaches to include dependencies in datasets [30,31]. However, these sophisticated methods
require as a prerequisite the knowledge of a phylogenetic
tree and its associated branching parameters for species of
interest. This is not a trivial task to perform, and was therefore not applied in the present analysis. In addition,
because correlations in most scaling plots (Figures 1, 2, 3,
4, Table 1) are generally very high, it is likely that taking

phylogeny into account would not alter the empirical
exponents.
Key factors in the cerebral metabolic rate
Which factors in the gray matter might account for its total
metabolic exponent on brain volume to be >0.75? The
likely candidate is the density of glial cells, which provide
metabolic support for neurons (including synapses)
[32,33]. Two recent studies [34,35] show that the number
of glia per neuron increases for larger brains, suggesting

firing rate is sufficiently large [20]. The synaptic contribution in a single neuron is proportional to the product of
the number of synapses per neuron, the firing rate, release
probability, and the postsynaptic charge. The active axon
contribution is proportional to its surface area and firing
rate. Even when neurons are not firing action potentials,
they also consume energy, because of the passive Na+ and
K+ ion flow that the electrochemical Na+/K+ pump must
remove to maintain the gradients of these ions across the
membrane [39]. This resting potential contribution is proportional to the total surface area of the neuron. To obtain
the total cerebral energy consumption, all three additive
contributions must be multiplied by the total number of
neurons in the gray matter.

that neurons become more energy-expensive with increasing brain size. In particular, the total number of glia in the
cerebral cortex of rodents scales with brain size with the
exponent 0.89 (Figure 2B in Herculano-Houzel et al [34]),
which is close to the empirical metabolic exponent 0.86.
It is likely that glia number simply follows the energy
demands of neurons, especially their spatial expansion
with increasing brain size. Thus, the details of this expansion may provide clues about which neural factors are
important.
It has been estimated that neural metabolism is dominated by the Na+/K+-ATPase ion transport [6,36-38]. The
bulk of this comes from active ion fluxes at synapses and
along axons (propagation of axon potentials) if the neural

It seems that of all these three neural contributions, the
most important for the scaling exponent of total brain
metabolism on brain volume is the synaptic contribution.
This contribution is proportional to the total number of
synapses in the gray matter, which scales with the gray
matter volume, and thus brain volume [40,41], with an
exponent of 1. The latter occurs because synaptic density
is invariant across brain regions and brain size [28,29].
The regional homogeneity of synaptic density correlates
with the discovered homogeneity of the regional volumespecific cerebral metabolic scaling (Table 1). Moreover, if
the other factors comprising the synaptic contribution
(firing rate, release probability, and postsynaptic charge)
were independent of brain size, then the synaptically
driven total brain metabolism would scale with brain volume with an exponent of 1. As this exponent is, in fact,
between 0.75 and 1 (Figure 1), it implies that at least one
of these three factors should decrease with brain size. It
could be hypothesized that because synaptic sizes and
their basic molecular machinery are similar among mammals of different sizes [28,39], the postsynaptic component might be roughly the same among different species.
This suggests that the product of the firing rate and release
probability should decrease as brains increase in size, with
a power of about -0.15, which is in accord with the low firing rates in humans estimated from their basal cerebral
metabolic rate [21,42]. This also suggests that the number
of active synapses in the background state decreases for
bigger brains. That firing rate should decrease with brain
(body) size is also consistent with allometric data on the
firing rates of avian sensory neurons [43].
The remaining two contributions affecting metabolic rate
(the active axons and maintenance of resting potentials)
are both proportional to the product of the number of
neurons in the gray matter and axonal surface area
(assuming that axon surface area constitutes the majority
of the neuron's area, especially for bigger brains). Additionally, the active axon contribution is proportional to
the average firing rate. Given the above indications that

Page 6 of 11

BMC Biology 2007, 5:18

the firing rate probably decreases with brain volume, the
active axon contribution becomes less important for the
total metabolic exponent as brains increase in size. Thus,
one can focus only on the resting potential contribution.
Because the product of the number of neurons and axonal
surface area is proportional to the ratio of the volume of
gray matter to axon diameter (due to the empirical fact
that volumes of intracortical axons and gray matter are
proportional across species [28]), the resting potential
contribution produces the total metabolic exponent that
is determined by the scaling exponent of the axon diameter against brain volume. The bigger the axonal exponent,
the smaller the metabolic exponent. There are some
sketchy experimental indications that axon diameter
indeed increases with brain size [44,45], such as in the
corpus callosum with the exponent ~0.07 [44]. If similar
allometry holds for the gray matter axons, the resting
potential contribution would yield a total metabolic
exponent also above 3/4.
Brain metabolism, computation, and design
The fact that the synaptic metabolic contribution
decreases with decreasing the rate of release probability,
and that the active axon and resting potential metabolic
contributions decrease with increasing axon diameter, has
interesting functional consequences. A higher failure rate
of synaptic transmission as brains get bigger not only
saves energy but may also maximize information transfer
to postsynaptic neurons [19]. Similarly, increasing axon
diameter with brain size accomplishes three functions
simultaneously: it reduces the specific metabolic rate,
increases the number of synapses per neuron, and
increases the speed of signal propagation in cortical circuits, which is proportional to the square root of the axon
diameter [46,47]. It is difficult to say at this stage whether
these relationships are accidental or are a result of some
cerebral optimization.

We can estimate the allometric cost of information
processing by determining how the amounts of metabolic
energy per neuron and per synapse scale with brain size.
As the total energy utilized by the entire cerebral cortex
(gray matter) scales with its volume Vg with the exponent
~0.85 (Table 1, Figure 2E), the cerebral energy per neuron
is proportional to
Vg0.85/(ρnVg) ~ Vg0.05 - 0.17,
that is, it increases with brain size. We used the fact that
the neural density, ρn, scales with brain volume with an
exponent between -0.32 and -0.20 (based on data of Haug
[48]; see Additional file 1, Figure S2). This increase is in
accord with the trend of increasing number of glial cells
per neuron in gray matter. The opposite is true for synapses, as the energy per synapse is proportional to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/18

Vg0.85/(ρsVg) ~ Vg-0.15,
where ρs is the synaptic density (independent of brain
size). The finding of an increase in energy expenditure per
neuron with increasing brain size is in contrast to findings
in liver cells [49], in which metabolism decreases with
body mass. This difference reflects the increase of neural
size (its wire) and corresponding decrease in density with
increasing brain volume (sizes of liver cells are roughly
constant [50]). The declining trend for synapses again
implies that their active fraction decreases as brains get
bigger. These results have implications for coding and cortical organization. The fact that expanding neurons are
energetically costly was probably a driving evolutionary
force in decreasing their density in larger mammals (Additional file 1, Figure S2) and adopting sparse neural representations [18,20,21]. The latter factor is consistent with
the idea of functional modularity of the cerebral cortex
[40], that is, that primary information processing takes
place in local modules/areas. The sizes of such modules/
areas seem to follow scaling rules [12,15,40], and have
been shown to have almost brain size-independent connectedness [12] as opposed to neural connectedness,
which decays with brain size [11,12].
Metabolism of gray versus white matter
The data in Table 1 seem to indicate that the metabolic
allometries of white matter and gray matter are different.
This finding implies that as brains increase in size, the
metabolism of white matter is less costly than that of gray
matter. This is presumably beneficial for the total cerebral
energetic expenditure, as white matter increases disproportionately faster than gray matter [9,40,51]. The difference in metabolism between white and gray matter may
be caused by their apparent neuroanatomical differences,
as most of the white matter axonal membrane is covered
with a myelin sheath, which prevents ion flow and
reduces metabolic cost.
Relation to metabolism of other tissues
Most of the tissues in the body have a much lower specific
metabolic rate than the brain, with the exception of four
highly active organs: kidney, liver, heart [1] and gut [2].
There are no reliable data on in vivo allometric metabolic
scaling in these tissues across different species (however,
see Wang et al [52], where allometric exponents are given
based on only 2–3 species). Allometric in vitro studies of
Na+/K+-ATPase in kidney [53] and in brain [54] suggest
that these two organs might have comparable specific
metabolic exponents. It is possible to estimate and compare metabolic exponents for active tissues indirectly
using allometric data on mitochondria size [55], as its
total membrane surface area correlates with baseline oxygen consumption [55] (interestingly, the total mitochondrial volume in locomotor muscles is proportional to the

maximum metabolic rate in mammals [56]). From these
data one can find that the total mitochondrial surface area
in brain scales with brain mass with an exponent of 0.86,
i.e., exactly as in Figure 1. The corresponding scaling exponents for kidney, liver, and heart against their respective
organ masses are smaller and closer to the 0.75 exponent:
0.71, 0.74, and 0.81. These exponents do not seem to
relate directly to the exponents of sizes of these tissues on
body size, as the masses of kidney and liver increase
slower than body mass, while heart mass scales isometrically [1]. Thus, it appears that, in general, higher metabolic exponents do not necessarily lead to lower mass
exponents.

causes" scenario of metabolic scaling has been proposed
[62,63], which in essence argues that supply rate is only
one of the factors and should be considered together with
other factors characterizing utilization of cellular energy.
The approach taken in this paper is similar in spirit, i.e.,
given that the total cerebral metabolic exponent is 0.86,
simple supply-limited models are rejected as a possible
explanation for brain metabolic scaling. Instead, the most
energetically expensive cellular factors that are most likely
to affect the metabolic exponent were identified. In this
sense, this approach can also be viewed as a multiplecause model of cerebral metabolic scaling.

Conclusion
If these exponents reflect a real difference in metabolic
allometry between cerebral and non-cerebral tissues, it
might be caused by differences in membrane chemical
composition and ion pump activities, which is known as
the "membrane pacemaker theory of metabolism" [38].
For example, it has been shown that heart, liver, kidney,
and skeletal muscles display allometric variation in lipid
composition, but brain tissue does not [57]. Other potential factors (some of which might be related to the membrane pacemaker hypothesis) affecting differences in the
allometries of brain and other tissues include: (i) distinct
ways in which energy is used in the brain and in other tissues (e.g., Na+/K+-ATPase dominates energy consumption
only in the brain and kidney [3]); (ii) differences in
modes of activity (cells outside nervous system exhibit
graded electrical activity without firing Na+ action potentials); (iii) structural differences between brain and other
highly active tissues (the size of non-cerebral cells is virtually independent of body mass and the cells lack elongated processes with synapses [50]); (iv) the existence of
the blood-brain barrier, which restricts direct transport of
molecules between bloodstream and nerve cells [39], and
may affect substrate utilization rate and/or neural activity
[58,59].
Supply-limited models of metabolic scaling
In many studies of whole-body metabolism, the scaling
exponent 0.75 was found [1,24], and it was argued that
this value follows from a general model of hierarchical
fractal-like transport networks [60], or from constrained
geometric networks with balanced supply and demand
[61]. Both of these models are based on the assumption
that metabolic rates are determined solely by resource
supply rates and are independent of cellular energy
expenditure. This single-cause assumption has been challenged recently [62,63]. The main arguments against the
supply-limited models are that: (i) rate of blood flow
adjusts itself to the physiological demands of tissue, and
in resting animals is well below its maximal limit; and (ii)
cellular metabolic rates decline with increasing body size
[49] (at least for non-cerebral cells). Thus, a "multiple-

Figures 1, 2, 3 and Table 1 provide empirical evidence that
the scaling exponents describing global and regional brain
metabolism are significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from the
much-cited exponent of 3/4, which calls into question the
direct applicability of supply-limited models [60,61] to
brain metabolism. The exceptions are white matter structures, which seem to exhibit "regular" metabolic exponents (Figure 4). The empirical results presented in this
paper show a striking uniformity of the allometric metabolic exponents over almost the entire gray matter of
mammalian brains at normal resting conditions, despite
anatomical and functional heterogeneity of different
regions and their different levels of activation. This
regional scaling uniformity is surprising, as activity level
could potentially affect the scaling exponent. For example,
the total metabolic rate of maximally exercised body
scales with body mass well above 0.75, with an exponent
of 0.88 [56,64].

Methods
In vivo data of the cerebral oxygen (CMRO2) and glucose
(CMRglc) utilization rates of unanesthetized adult animals at resting conditions were collected from various
sources [5,65-99] (see Additional file 1). In those studies,
the measurements of glucose utilization in all species
were performed by essentially the same method or its
modification (in human and baboon), and thus all glucose data are directly comparable. There is a small method
variability for oxygen data, as the same technique was
applied to five of seven species (except cat and dog). However, this variability does not affect the scaling exponent
(Figure 1A); it is the same even if only single-method
mammals are included in the plot. Glucose utilization
data represent both global and regional cerebral metabolism.
The investigated mammals comprised: Swiss mouse,
squirrel, rabbit, goat (all glucose data only), dog (oxygen
data only), cat, Sprague-Dawley rat, macaque monkey,
baboon, sheep, and human. The investigated brain structures comprised: cerebral cortex (visual, prefrontal, fron-

tal, sensorimotor, parietal, temporal, cingulate, occipital),
thalamus (including lateral geniculate nucleus and
medial geniculate nucleus), hypothalamus (and separately, the mammillary body), cerebellum (including cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus), basal ganglia
(caudate, substantia nigra, globus pallidus), limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala, septum), brain stem
(superior colliculus, inferior colliculus), and white matter
(corpus callosum, internal capsule). In cases when there
was more than one data point for a given animal or a
brain structure, an arithmetic mean of all values was
taken.
Allometric metabolism of the entire cerebral cortex (presented in Figure 2E), was obtained by computing an arithmetic mean of glucose utilization in the eight cortical
areas listed above for each animal. Glucose utilization of
a given area was itself an average of values taken from different sources. If data for all eight areas were not available,
data were averaged over fewer areas. For consistency, an
alternative method of averaging was also used: the first
averaging was performed for a given data source, and the
second for different sources representing the same animal.
In this method, because different sources differed in the
number of cortical areas studied, averaging in many cases
was performed over a significantly different number of
areas. However, both methods gave statistically identical
scaling exponents for the cerebral cortex metabolism
(Additional file 1, Figure S1).
The allometric metabolism of the entire brain was
obtained by using either direct data quoted by authors, or,
if not available, by computing an arithmetic mean of glucose consumption in all brain structures provided by the
authors. For all scaling plots, the brain volumes were
taken from Hofman [41] and Stephan et al [100], or from
the source.
