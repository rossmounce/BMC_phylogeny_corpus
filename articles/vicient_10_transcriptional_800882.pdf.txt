Transcriptional activity of transposable elements
in maize
Carlos M Vicient

Abstract
Background: Mobile genetic elements represent a high proportion of the Eukaryote genomes. In maize, 85% of
genome is composed by transposable elements of several families. First step in transposable element life cycle is
the synthesis of an RNA, but few is known about the regulation of transcription for most of the maize transposable
element families. Maize is the plant from which more ESTs have been sequenced (more than two million) and the
third species in total only after human and mice. This allowed us to analyze the transcriptional activity of the maize
transposable elements based on EST databases.
Results: We have investigated the transcriptional activity of 56 families of transposable elements in different maize
organs based on the systematic search of more than two million expressed sequence tags. At least 1.5% maize
ESTs show sequence similarity with transposable elements. According to these data, the patterns of expression of
each transposable element family is variable, even within the same class of elements. In general, transcriptional
activity of the gypsy-like retrotransposons is higher compared to other classes. Transcriptional activity of several
transposable elements is specially high in shoot apical meristem and sperm cells. Sequence comparisons between
genomic and transcribed sequences suggest that only a few copies are transcriptionally active.
Conclusions: The use of powerful high-throughput sequencing methodologies allowed us to elucidate the extent
and character of repetitive element transcription in maize cells. The finding that some families of transposable
elements have a considerable transcriptional activity in some tissues suggests that, either transposition is more
frequent than previously expected, or cells can control transposition at a post-transcriptional level.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that
move from one location to another within the genome
or can produce copies of themselves. Eukaryotic TEs are
divided into two classes, according to whether their
transposition intermediate is RNA (class I) or DNA
(class II). Each class contain elements that encode functional products required for transposition (autonomous)
and elements that only retain the cis sequences necessary for recognition by the transposition machinery
(non-autonomous). Class I elements can be divided into
several subclasses: SINEs, LINEs, long terminal repeat
(LTR) retrotransposons and TRIMs (Terminal-repeat
Retrotransposons In Miniature), which are LTR nonautonomous elements [1]. Class II elements comprise
autonomous and non-autonomous transposons,

including the MITEs (Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements) [2].
TEs are major components of most eukaryotic genomes and are particularly abundant in plants. TEs represent 80% of the maize and 90% of wheat genomes [3].
All the classes of TEs found in Eukaryotes are also present in plant genomes, but LTR retrotransposons are
the most abundant in terms of copy number and percentage of genome [4]. 95% of maize TEs are LTR retrotransposons [5].
TEs play an important role in genome and gene evolution. TE insertion can disrupt genes and mediate chromosome rearrangements and can provide alternative
promoters, exons, terminators and splice junctions [6].
Several rice genes contain TE derived sequences [7].
However, TE influence in gene expression is not
restricted to physical modification of chromosomes. TEs
were first characterized in maize as gene ‘’controlling
elements’’ [8]. Maize “controlling elements” change the

expression of some genes due to the transcription of
non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) from the transposon promoters which contribute to the epigenetic regulation of
neighbouring genes through mechanisms such as RNAi,
transcriptional interference and anti-silencing [9]. The
methylation of a SINE element close to the FWA gene,
a gene submitted to imprinting, allows the proper epigenetic control in Arabidopsis thaliana [10]. TEs also produce short double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) which
contribute to the epigenetic gene regulation. Analyses in
maize, tobacco, wheat or rice have shown that transcriptional readout from retrotransposon LTRs may generate
sense and antisense transcripts of adjacent genes, altering their expression [11]. Given the large number of retrotransposon copies in plant genomes and their
frequent location near genes, it becomes clear the high
potential impact of the TE transcription on the expression of the nearby genes [12,13]. For this reason, TE
transcription was believed to be severely repressed in
plants. This point of view was supported by the fact that
during long time transcription activity was only demonstrated for a few plant TEs, and only activated under
certain precise circumstances as, for example, pathogen
infection, physical injuries or different abiotic stresses
[14,15]. Inactivity of TEs may be due to the accumulation of mutations that have altered their structure. However, although transpositionally inactive due to
insertions, deletions, rearrangements or mutations, some
copies of the TEs may retain the capacity to direct transcription from their own promoters. In addition to the
direct inactivation, cells have also developed mechanism
for TE control including silencing by DNA methylation
or the small RNA pathways [16]. TEs producing doublestranded or aberrant RNAs are silenced by a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism (PTGS) and active
TEs are inactivated by transcriptional gene silencing
(TGS) [17].
Despite mutations and cell control, TEs manage to be
transcriptionally and transpositionally active. Phylogenetic analysis of TE families in maize revealed recent
events of extreme TE proliferation [18] and recent
transposition activity has also been demonstrated in rice
[19]. The use of sensitive techniques for gene expression
analysis like deep transcriptome sequencing provide
increasing data on the presence of TE-transcripts in several plants and cell types [20-23].
Maize is the plant species from which more ESTs have
been sequenced and the third species only after human
and mice [24]. More than two million maize ESTs have
been sequenced from many libraries corresponding to
several maize organs, developmental stages and conditions. It provides a strong basis for the development of
computer-based procedures for the in silico analysis of
expression profiles. The present work aimed to produce

a body map of TE transcription in maize plants. We
show that the fraction of TE-related transcripts varies
greatly among TE classes and among organs.

Results
Maize TEs are widely represented in EST databases

The number of ESTs in a large transcript database can
be used to estimate relative transcriptional rates. More
than two million maize EST sequences are deposited in
the NCBI EST database (Zm-dbEST). Such a large
amount of sequences provides an opportunity to perform virtual analysis of gene expression in this species.
We used a representative sequence of 56 well-characterized TEs (available in the repeats and retrotransposon
databases) to query BLASTN against the maize EST
database (Zm-dbESTs). 1,5% of the total maize ESTs
(25.282 sequences) showed significant sequence homology (e-value < 1E -20 ) with one of the 56 analysed TE
families (Additional file 1).
Considering the different TE classes separately, the
average number of TE-ESTs obtained for gypsy-like
LTR retrotransposons (gypsy) is more than three folds
higher than for any other TE class, followed by copialike LTR retrotransposons (copia) and CACTA (Figure
1). The values within each TE class have a large variability. For example, among gypsy elements, Prem has 4310

ESTs and jaws only two, and among copia elements
Opie has 2296 and Hopscotch only one. However, the
predominance of gypsy elements is not a result of high
presence in EST databases of one or a few families, but
generally most of gypsy families have a higher level of
transcription compared with other elements. The comparison of the number of TE-ESTs of the families of
copia and gypsy elements show a clear overall greater
presence of gypsy families in databases (Table 1). Thus,
while seven gypsy families have over a thousand TEESTs, only Opie exceeds this value among copia
elements.
Previous works suggest that a negative correlation
exists between retrotransposon copy numbers and transcription levels [25]. We compared the copy numbers of
each TE family with the numbers of ESTs and we did
not find correlation (positive or negative) (r = 0.209)
(Figure 2). There are TE families with low copy numbers and several ESTs (Flip has 263 copies and 704
ESTs), and TE families with high copy numbers and few
ESTs (Ji has 7.650 copies and only 209 ESTs). The lack
of correlation between copy and EST numbers is also an
indication that no extensive genomic contamination is
present in the maize dbEST. We also checked for possible correlations between copy number and EST numbers looking for each of the libraries individually and we
found no significant correlations in any of them (data
not shown).
The distribution of the EST matches along the TE
sequence was examined (Additional file 2). The EST distribution was variable depending on the TE element
family, but a general similar behaviour was observed
within classes. For example, in LINEs, most of the ESTs
showed similarity with the 3’end. On the other hand, in
LTR retrotransposons and TRIMs, most of the ESTs are
similar to the LTR regions. These non-random distribution is probably a consequence of the different transcription mechanism characteristic of each TE family.
TE families are comprised by hundreds or thousands
of copies inserted in the genome. A question arises of
how many of these copies are transcriptionally active.
Are the TE transcripts produced by several copies or
only by one or a few of them? In order to answer this
question we aligned randomly selected genomic
sequences and transcribed sequences of some of the TE
families and we constructed phylogenetic trees (an
example is in Figure 3 and more data are available in
Additional file 3). Several clades of genomic sequences
were detected, some of them composed by many closely
related copies which probably represent recent transposition bursts. EST sequences are located only in a few of
these clades, which indicate that only few evolutionary
branches of the TEs have retained transcriptional competence. A similar situation was observed in all families

analysed (Additional file 3). It does not exist a correlation between the active subfamily and transcription in
certain organs. These results also suggest that genomic
contamination in the EST databases, if exists, is negligible and that the observed EST frequencies are indicative
of transcriptional activity of the TE families in maize.
Profiles of TE transcription in different maize organs and
conditions

Many of the maize ESTs were obtained from libraries
constructed with RNA extracted from dissected organs.
This allows us to study organ-specific expression of the
different TE families using a “virutal northern” strategy
based on the abundance of the ESTs on each library.
ESTs matching the TEs were divided according to the
library they were sequenced from. Due that for some of
the libraries the number of ESTs was not enough to
guarantee a deep analysis, we grouped the libraries constructed from the same or related organs. Each group of
libraries contains a different number of sequences, so,
direct comparison between organs is not possible. A
normalization process was done dividing the matches by
the total number of sequences in each of the groups.
The resulting numbers reflect the overall expression
level of each family among the different organs and conditions tested. As a result, we obtained expression values
for each of the 56 TE families in 12 different organs or
conditions (Figure 4). As a control, we used the same
analysis for four genes of known and precise patterns of
expression: zein, es1, mgs2 and PEP1. In all cases the
analysis gave us the expected patterns of expression for
all marker genes, zein in endosperm, es1 in ovary, mgs2
in male flower and PEP1 in leaves. The TE expression
patterns vary considerably between and within classes.
Whereas many TE families show low levels of expression in all organs and conditions, others have especially
high levels in certain organs. Several retrotransposons
seem to be specially expressed in apical meristem like
Prem or Danelle. Giepum, Flip, Prem1 and Shadowspawn are specially expressed in cultured cells and
Prem1 is also highly represented in ovary. Considering
all the TE classes, shoot apical meristem and cell culture
are clearly the organs with a higher presence of TEESTs, followed by ovary and male flower (Figure 5). As
we showed previously (Figure 1), gypsy elements are the
most abundantly represented in the EST databases, and
this is also true if we consider separately the different
organs. CACTA are specially represented in SAM and
ovary, DNA transposons in cultured cells, LINEs in
ovary, and TRIMs in ovary.
Relatively high number of TE-ESTs have been
observed in male reproductive organs (Figure 5). This is
interesting because this organ can potentially lead to the
germ line cells, allowing a possible transposition event

to be inherited. However, “Male flower” group is composed by sequences obtained from six cDNA libraries
obtained from dissected anther, pollen, sperm cell, tassel
and tassel primordium. So, we decided to examine in
more detail the origin of the TE-ESTs for this category
doing the same analysis, but considering separately the
different libraries. We observed that the majority of the
TE-ESTs were originated in the sperm cell library
(Figure 6A). Gypsy-like retrotransposons are specially
represented in the male flower category and most of the
ESTs were originated from the sperm cell library. Looking at the different gypsy-like families individually, predominance of sperm cell was observed in all of them
(Figure 6B).

Discussion
“Virtual northern” analysis provides an easy and cheap
alternative to the study of transcriptional profiling. An
advantage of EST profiling compared with other methods is that it does not require prior knowledge of the
gene sequences. The accuracy of “virtual northern” analyses will depend on the diversity of biological samples
and in the number of sequence tags to provide sufficient
depth to identify low-abundant transcripts. An

1865

additional problem will be the possibility to distinguish
between closely related genes in the basis of partial
sequences. EST profiling have been used for the identification of reference genes for quantitative RT-PCR normalization in wheat [26] and barley [27], expression
profiling of storage-protein gene families in wheat [28],
identification of differentially expressed transcripts from
sugarcane maturing stem [29], or the identification of
cancer gene-markers in humans [30]. The application of
EST profiling to maize TEs is particularly appropriate.
First, the analysis of TE families, and not single genes,
virtually eliminates the problem of distinguishing
between closely related sequences. Second, maize is the
third organism in number of ESTs, and, finally, several
of the cDNA libraries were constructed from precise,
well-defined, dissected organs. The applicability of EST
profiling in maize is demonstrated by the expected
results for some marker genes (figure 4). One possible
problem is the presence of sequences originated from

contaminant genomic DNA in the EST collections. This
problem is especially serious in the case of TEs because
some of them are present in high copy numbers in the
genome. Although we cannot totally exclude the presence
of some genomic contamination, our results indicate that,
if any, it may be considered anecdotic (Figure 2).
Once integrated in the genome, TEs accumulate
mutations and become transpositionally inactive. However, even partial or rearranged TE copies may retain
their capacity to initiate transcription. Cells have active
mechanisms to protect their genome integrity against
TE activity including transcriptional silencing [31] and
short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [32]. Under certain circumstances some TEs can escape this cell control and
transcribe and, sometimes, transpose [19]. For example,
different TE families are transcribed in response to biotic or abiotic stresses or in cell culture [33-37]. In addition to these “stress response” transcription, increasing
data demonstrate that some TEs may have at least low
transcriptional activities under normal circumstances in
plant life. For example, transcription in leaves has been
demonstrated for barley BARE, maize Grande and
tomato Rider retrotransposons, and in different sorghum
TEs [38-41]. Different EST based analysis, including the
data presented here, demonstrate the presence of TEtranscripts in several organs and cell types [20-22,42,43].
According to our data, at least 1.5% of the ESTs correspond to TEs. This is an underestimation because only
well characterized maize TEs were considered in our
analysis and because ESTs libraries only contain data on
polyadenylated mRNAs and it is not clear which

percentage of TE transcripts contain a polyA track. For
example, it has been estimated that only 15% the transcripts of the barley retrotransposon BARE1 are polyadenylated [44]. In any case, the percentage is different
according to the organs analysed ranging from 7.7% in
SAM and 6.2% in cultured cells, to only 0.2% in female
flowers and 0.1% in embryo.
TE transcripts are specially abundant in SAM, cultured cells (Figure 4; [23]) and sperm cells (Figure 5;
[31,45-47]). A common feature of SAM, pollen and cell
cultures is that they contain pluripotent cells. Animal
totipotent cells like oocytes and two-cell mouse embryos
also exhibit high levels of TE transcription [48]. The
acquisition of totipotency depends, among other things,
on epigenetic reprogramming [49] and activation of TEs
has also been associated with reductions on DNA
methylation [50]. For example, DNA in plant cultured
cells undergoes hypomethylated and these cells show a
transcriptional activation of specific TEs [31]. Tobacco
Tnt1 retrotransposon is silenced when introduced in
Arabidopsis, but reversion of Tnt1 silencing is obtained
when the number of Tnt1 elements is reduced to two
by genetic segregation [51]. Microarray expression profiling of Arabidopsis mature pollen revealed that many
of the genes involved in siRNA biogenesis and silencing
are not expressed in pollen or expressed at low levels
[52]. Although epigenetic changes may explain activation of certain TEs in some tissues, not all TE families
accumulate equally in SAM or sperm cells, suggesting
that the phenomenon requires some family specific
mechanisms rather than simply being the result of a
genome-wide activation of retrotransposons. One possible explanation may be the presence of cis specific signals in the TE promoter that may enhance their
expression in certain cells. For example, pollen promoter
specific signals have been detected in the LTR of
Grande (personal unpublished data).

Conclusions
The use of powerful high-throughput sequencing methodologies allowed us to elucidate the extent and character of repetitive element transcription in maize cells.
Next-generation sequencing of transcriptomes and genomes will enable further studies on TE transcription
and their consequences.
Methods
Data sources and analysis

Model TE sequences were obtained from the TIGR
Plant Repeat Databases [53], Retrotransposon Database
[54] and GeneBank. Only well characterized elements
were included in our analysis (Table 1). Model
sequences were compared with the maize (Zea mays L.)
entries in NCBI dbEST release 092509 [24], which

contained 2,018,634 sequences from 315 cDNA libraries,
using BLASTN analysis [55]. BLAST analysis were performed using an expected threshold of 10, a word size
of 11, a match/mismatch of 2-3 and gap cost existence
of 5 and extension of 2. We only considered positive
such sequences showing an e-value < 1E-20. For organspecific expression analysis libraries in the UniGene data
set constructed from the same (or related) organ(s) were
assigned into common pools. Libraries with insufficient
information regarding the source organ or constructed
from mixed parts of the plant were excluded from the
analysis. These efforts resulted in organ groupings each
containing different numbers of libraries and ESTs
(Table 2). The differences in the clone numbers between
organ groups do not allow a direct comparison of EST

numbers. A normalization process was done dividing
the number of ESTs by the total number of sequences
in the organ group. Normalization values were
expressed as 1 per 10.000.
Sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTALW and phylogenetic trees using neighbour joining
method. Graphic representation of phylogenetic trees
were prepared using Dendroscope v.2.7.4 [56].
