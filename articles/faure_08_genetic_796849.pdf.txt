Abstract
Background: Few models of genetic hitchhiking in subdivided populations have been developed and the
rarity of empirical examples is even more striking. We here provide evidences of genetic hitchhiking in a
subdivided population of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis. In the Bay of Biscay (France), a patch of M. edulis
populations happens to be separated from its North Sea conspecifics by a wide region occupied only by
the sister species M. galloprovincialis. Although genetic differentiation between the two M. edulis regions is
largely non-significant at ten marker loci (average FST~0.007), a strong genetic differentiation is observed
at a single locus (FST = 0.25). We validated the outlier status of this locus, and analysed DNA sequence
polymorphism in order to identify the nature of the selection responsible for the unusual differentiation.
Results: We first showed that introgression of M. galloprovincialis alleles was very weak in both
populations and did not significantly affect their differentiation. Secondly, we observed the genetic
signature of a selective sweep within both M. edulis populations in the form of a star-shaped clade of alleles.
This clade was nearly fixed in the North Sea and was segregating at a moderate frequency in the Bay of
Biscay, explaining their genetic differentiation. Incomplete fixation reveals that selection was not direct on
the locus but that the studied sequence recombined with a positively selected allele at a linked locus while
it was on its way to fixation. Finally, using a deterministic model we showed that the wave of advance of a
favourable allele at a linked locus, when crossing a strong enough barrier to gene flow, generates a step in
neutral allele frequencies comparable to the step observed between the two M. edulis populations at the
outlier locus. In our case, the position of the barrier is now materialised by a large patch of heterospecific
M. galloprovincialis populations.
Conclusion: High FST outlier loci are usually interpreted as being the consequence of ongoing divergent
local adaptation. Combining models and data we show that among-population differentiation can also
dramatically increase following a selective sweep in a structured population. Our study illustrates how a
striking geographical pattern of neutral diversity can emerge from past indirect hitchhiking selection in a
structured population.

Background
The detection of adaptive evolution at the molecular level
has essentially relied on indirect inferences [1]. This is
simply because genomes are very large and adaptive evolution probably occurs only at a few segregating mutations at a given time [2]. However, adaptive evolution
leaves a footprint on the pattern of neutral diversity [3],
which widens both the genomic extent and the time scale
on which adaptation can be detected. The theory is very
well developed in the case of a single panmictic population. The hitchhiking model of Maynard Smith and Haigh
[3] predicts that the fixation of an advantageous mutation
decreases the diversity at linked neutral loci. The effect of
a so-called selective sweep on the allele frequency spectrum [4], and more generally on gene genealogies [5,6] is
also well established. Along with the development of a
battery of statistical tests [7], empirical examples have
accumulated [8-12]. Although the indirect path through
which selection shapes genetic diversity bears many
resemblances to demographic effects [13,14], selection
only acts on the chromosomal neighbourhood of the site
targeted by selection while demography affects the whole
genome [15,16]. The recent development of genome
scans now allows appreciating how genomes seem crippled by numerous signatures of adaptive evolution
[17,18].
Most models describe the spread of an advantageous
mutation in a single isolated population and examples of
genetic hitchhiking remain bordered on such an idealised
model. However, natural populations are most of the
time structured into geographically or genetically partially
isolated populations [19]. The hitchhiking effect in structured populations has been less intensively investigated.
Few models have been developed [20-23] and they sometimes give contradictory results. Although a reduction of
genetic diversity at the metapopulation level is a robust
expectation, the effect of a selective sweep on the distribution of the genetic diversity within and between populations is less clear. Although statistical tests have been
developed in order to identify loci showing more or less
population differentiation than predicted under neutrality [24-27], the exact form of the selection responsible for
extreme differentiations is hardly ever addressed. Indeed,
loci with a higher than expected FST are simply assumed to
be under divergent selection ('local adaptation') while
loci with a lower than expected FST are assumed to be
under balancing selection. In addition, the question of
whether selection acted directly on the polymorphism
observed or indirectly through genetic hitchhiking is often
eluded [28]. Regrettably, it has seldom been noticed by
experimentalists that the hitchhiking effect of an unconditionally favourable mutation that spread from its deme of
origin to other demes by migration ('hitchhiking in space'
[29]) can sometimes enhance population differentiation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/164

as measured by FST [21]. Few studies have attempted to
investigate more explicitly how selection has operated on
an outlier locus by examining DNA sequence variation
[30]. Albeit some genome scans were recently conducted
with DNA sequence polymorphisms in humans and flies
[17,31], these studies emphasised the occurrence of hitchhiking within derived populations thought to have
recently adapted to a new environment (i.e. the 'local
adaptation' hypothesis).
The objective of the present study was to identify the
nature of the selection (positive vs. disruptive, direct vs.
indirect, past vs. ongoing) acting on a locus with a higher
than expected level of population differentiation in the
mussel Mytilus edulis. The structure of the hybrid zone
between Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis in Europe is
an original mosaic structure in which populations of each
species alternate [32,33]. Along the Atlantic coast of
France, three transition zones separate four regions from
North to South (Figure 1): a large Northern patch of M.
edulis connected to the North Sea populations, a patch of
M. galloprovincialis centred on Brittany, a patch of M. edulis
centred on the Bay of Biscay, and a large southern population of M. galloprovincialis connected to Iberic Atlantic
populations [33]. We noticed that populations of the two
enclosed patches (Brittany, where M. galloprovincialis populations are surrounded by M. edulis; and Bay of Biscay,
where the reverse is true) exhibited genetic originalities
compared to their external conspecifics (southern and
northern patches respectively). These allelic differences
were unequally distributed among loci suggesting the possible impact of selection. Within M. edulis, differences
between peripheral populations of the North Sea and the
patch of the Bay of Biscay were restricted to a single locus
named EFbis. EFbis was amplified by the Exon-Primed
Intron-Crossing (EPIC) PCR technique and revealed
length-polymorphisms within the third intron of the
Elongation Factor 1α (EF1α) gene. Here, we wanted first
to validate the outlier status of the EFbis locus. We compiled data at five allozyme loci [34], and six nuclear DNA
loci [33] between peripheral populations of the North Sea
and the patch of the Bay of Biscay. To better understand
the unforeseen behaviour of the EFbis locus we investigated DNA sequence polymorphisms at a ~1 Kb portion
of the EF1α gene that includes the third intron (i.e. the
region analysed with length polymorphism) but also the
second intron and three exons (a large portion of the second, the third, and a small portion of the fourth). We
assessed whether the genetic structure observed between
M. edulis populations could be a consequence of differential introgression of galloprovincialis alleles by analysing M.
galloprovincialis samples. We looked for signatures of
hitchhiking events in one or both populations in the form
of star-shaped allele genealogies and using various neutrality tests. We also modelled the effect of a barrier to

gene flow to better understand how population structure
may interact with selective sweeps so as to produce the
pattern observed.

Is EFbis an FST outlier?
The heterozygosities observed in the two M. edulis patches
were similar with the exception of the EFbis locus (Figure
2A). At the EFbis locus, heterozygosity was significantly
lower in the patch of the North Sea than in the patch of
the Bay of Biscay. The result of the test of Beaumont and
Nichols [25] is presented in Figure 2B as a distribution of
FST with heterozygosity on which we superimposed singlelocus FST-values obtained with allozyme or length-polymorphism loci. Curves of the average FST and 95% confidence intervals plotted in Figure 2 have been generated by
simulations with the infinite-allele model of mutation, 50
islands (demes), two samples and the average gene flow
deduced from all eleven loci. Other parameters we tried,
such as setting the model to have only two demes in order
to fit the idea of a two-patch model more closely, always
produced narrower 95% confidence intervals (data not
shown). We observed a strong and highly significant differentiation at locus EFbis (FST = 0.255, Fisher exact test: P
< 0.001) while the other ten loci exhibited very low and
non-significant levels of differentiation. Locus EFbis
appeared to be an outlier at the 95% limit when included
in the test (Figure 2B). Note, that we also removed the
EFbis locus from the test while generating the FST envelope
(an iterative fitting suggested by [25]). None of the 20,000
realisations produced a higher FST than the one observed
at the EFbis locus and the curve of the average FST fitted single-locus FST-values more closely (not shown).
Genetic composition of samples
Figure 3 shows the projection of samples on the plane
defined by the first two factorial axes of the CA. Axis 1
explains 67.6% and axis 2 6.1% of the variance in allele
frequencies. Axis 1 mainly reflected the allele frequency
gradient between the two species, from M. galloprovincialis
on the left to M. edulis on the right. The first factorial plane
clearly discriminated three groups of samples (ellipses in
Figure 3). Within each group, the homogeneity of genotypic frequencies could not be rejected at locus EFbis.
Although some differences between M. galloprovincialis of
the Iberian Peninsula and Brittany were visible on the
third axis (not shown, see [33]), the homogeneity of allele
frequencies was not rejected at locus EFbis. The three new
samples (FA, LU and WS) presented a genetic composition in conformity with expectations based on their geographic location (Figure 1 and 3). Finally, as for the 11
reference samples added in the analysis [33], none of our
new samples significantly departed from Hardy-Weinberg
and linkage equilibrium when tested with Barton's maximum likelihood ratio test [35]. We redid the analysis of
Bierne et al. [33] again with our new samples because it
allows inferring that shared polymorphism observed in
our samples is either a consequence of introgression or
ancestral polymorphism but not a consequence of admix-

ture (here defined as a population composed of individuals of the two species and/or first generations hybrids). In
other words, the genetic composition of the samples used
for DNA sequence analysis fitted their geographic position and were not polluted by admixture or recent events
of hybridisation.
Cloning
We here describe the results obtained with the markrecapture (MR)-cloning protocol [36]. In MR-cloning a
single cloning reaction is done for a population sample
and each individual sequence is subsequently assigned to
an individual with the two small poly-nucleotide tags that
flank the primer sequences (see methods). We sequenced
185 positive clones and obtained a sequence for 64 individuals (GenBank accession numbers – Sample FA:
EU684206 to EU684212, Sample LU: EU684181 to
EU684205, Sample PR: EU684213 to EU684228, Sample
WS: EU684168 to EU684180). Final sample sizes are
reported in Table 1. The LU sample size was much bigger
than the others simply because the cloning reactions
worked very well and allowed us to sequence many positive clones (Table 1). When the two alleles of heterozygous individuals were obtained, only the most captured

sequence was conserved for the data analysis in order to
prevent sampling bias. Alleles sequenced several times
allowed us to estimate the frequency of artefactual mutations inherently produced during PCR, cloning and
sequencing. We found on average one artefactual mutation for ~3000 bp sequenced in our dataset. We constructed datasets exclusively composed of sequences
captured several times (see methods) which should be
essentially free from artefactual mutations [36]. Results
obtained with the global datasets (G dataset) were compared to the results obtained with high quality subsets
(HQ subsets). As M. galloprovincialis samples were here
studied to control for introgression of galloprovincialis alleles in M. edulis populations, sample size does not need to
be high for these samples and we present results obtained
with HQ subsets.
Nucleotide variation
Significant genetic differentiation was observed at the
EFseq locus with permutation test between each pair of
populations except between the M. galloprovincialis samples of Brittany and the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, as was already the case with intron-length
polymorphism. As a consequence the two samples were
pooled together and simply labelled as M. galloprovincialis.
Basic descriptors of polymorphism are presented in Table
1. A high level of nucleotide diversity was observed. The
M. edulis sample of the North Sea, however, exhibited a
significantly lower level of nucleotide diversity (θπ, [37]).
In addition, the polymorphism of this sample was essentially composed of rare mutations (singletons). This result
logically echoed the lack of diversity obtained in the
North Sea patch with length-polymorphism in the third
intron (Figure 2A).
Allele phylogeny
The reconstructed phylogeny obtained (Figure 4) revealed
two highly divergent clades -one was mostly composed of
sequences sampled in M. galloprovincialis populations (the
B clade in Figure 4) and the other was exclusively composed of sequences sampled in M. edulis populations (the
A clade). The average divergence between sequences of the
two clades was 5.2% and the number of fixed differences
was 20 (2.2%). The sequence belonging to the B clade
sampled in the M. edulis population of the Bay of Biscay
coalesces with specific alleles at the base of the tree leaving
a long interior branch freed from coalescence event (Figure 4). Retention of ancestral polymorphism cannot reasonably explain such a phylogeny. As we paid special
attention to refute admixture (see above) we conclude
that the presence of this galloprovincialis allele in a M. edulis sample is a consequence of recent introgression.

In order to facilitate the description of the differences
between the two M. edulis samples, we split the A clade

into two sub-clades, A1 and A2 (Figure 4). Nearly all
sequences from the population of the North Sea (WS)
belonged to the A1 clade, while half of the sequences from
population of the Bay of Biscay (LU) belonged to the A2
clade. This result is more easily visualised in the reconstructed sample genealogies presented in Figure 5.
Correspondence between length and sequence
polymorphisms
The results obtained with DNA sequence polymorphisms
can be compared to the result obtained with intron-length
polymorphism allowing us to infer clade frequencies
more reliably with much larger sample sizes. Restricting
the sequence analysis to the region amplified with EFbis
primers, sequences of the B clade were 423 to 427 bp long,
sequences of the A1 clade were 446 to 448 bp long and
sequences of the A2 clade were 432 bp long. Length polymorphism is the consequence of the existence of many
indels, three of which are larger than the others and essentially explain the length difference between clade alleles.
Two constantly associated deletions, one of 11 bp and
another of 8 bp, explain the small size of alleles of the B
clade together with a few other small (< 3 bp) deletions. A
deletion of 14 bp explains the intermediate length of alleles of the A2 clade. The precise lengths of EFbis size-alleles
were previously unknown and we used a relative scale
[33]. Sequences now allow us to infer that the three most
frequent EFbis size-alleles named G0, G3 and E0, have a
length of 424 bp, 432 bp and 447 pb respectively, as they
pertain to clade B, A2 and A1. We can also deduce that the
EFbis-Ei alleles are alleles of the A1 clade and that the
EFbis-Gi alleles are alleles of the B clade with the exception

of EFbis-G3 which corresponds to alleles of the A2 clade.
EFbis-G3 was initially included in the Gi size class because
it was characteristic of M. galloprovincialis progenitors used
in a pair-cross experiment between mussels of the Mediterranean and the North Sea [38]. However, Bierne et al.
[33] acknowledged such a labelling was not welcomed
because population genetics analysis revealed that this
allele was indeed characteristic of M. edulis populations of
the Bay of Biscay. The phylogeny of alleles now removes
any doubt and confirms EFbis-G3 is a distinctive allele of
M. edulis. According to the correspondence made between
the two kinds of data, we present in Figure 6 the inferred
frequency of the three clades. Clade B alleles have been
sampled at a frequency of 0.2% and 9% in M. edulis sam-

ples of the North Sea and the Bay of Biscay respectively
(Figure 6). Clade A alleles have been sampled at an average frequency of 7% in M. galloprovincialis samples (Iberian Peninsula and Brittany). Segregation of heterospecific
alleles was therefore detected in every patch although in
so low amounts as to be easily overlooked in the DNA
sequence samples.
Departure from neutrality in M. edulis samples
We examined whether the pattern of variation observed at
locus EFbis within each population of M. edulis was consistent with the neutral model at mutation-drift equilibrium. To remove the effect of introgression, the single
sequence of the B clade sampled in the population of the
Bay of Biscay (LU) was removed from the analysis. The
values of Tajima's D [39] and Fay and Wu's H [4] together
with their significance are presented in Table 1. A strong
departure from mutation-drift equilibrium was observed
in the sample of the North Sea (WS). Sequences from WS
differ mainly by singleton mutations which results in a
star-shaped genealogy (Figure 5) typical of a selective
sweep while a single sampled lineage survived to the
sweep. Indeed, the significant excess of derived variants at
WS
(North Sea)

LU
(Bay of Biscay)

high frequency observed in such a genealogy (i.e. a significant Fay and Wu's test) has been advocated to be a
unique pattern produced by hitchhiking [4]. Whilst the
same star-like clade (denoted A1* in Figure 5) was also
present in sample LU, though in moderate frequency, the
departure was not detected by the two tests (Table 1).
Indeed, partial sweeps are not easily detected by these two
tests [11,40] because they generates an excess of rare and
intermediary mutations that compensate in the Tajima's
D test and the frequency of derived variants is not high
enough to be captured in the Fay and Wu's H test. For
instance, Santiago and Caballero [23] showed that positive instead of negative Tajima's D values can sometimes
be generated in some subpopulations after a selective
sweep in a subdivided population. In order to detect more
efficiently the distortion of the distribution in coalescence
times in the two sample genealogies we applied the coalescence-based maximum-likelihood method of Galtier et
al. [16]. We were able to easily apply this method to our
data as they were compatible with the infinite mutation
model (no recombination, Table 1). For the two populations, the model with a recent reduction in effective size
was significantly better supported than the mutation-drift
equilibrium model (Likelihood ratio tests: p = 0.001 and
p = 0.03 for samples WS and LU respectively). However,
the estimated strength of this effect was stronger in the
North Sea (S = 1.5 coalescence time units) than in the Bay
of Biscay (S = 0.9 coalescence time units) while the estimated age of the event was roughly the same in the two
samples (T~0.5 coalescence time units). These results provide statistical support to what can be easily visualised in

section. Our analyses suggest that the distortion of allele
genealogies and allele frequencies is less pronounced in
the patch of the Bay of Biscay than in the patch of the
North Sea. Although few models of genetic hitchhiking in
subdivided populations are available, they have emphasised that this situation could produce spatial variation in
genetic diversity even without spatial variation in selection regimes [23]. In order to illustrate this effect in a context that matches our study system we modelled the
hitchhiking effect of a favourable mutation that crosses a
barrier to gene flow (see methods). We considered two
patches of hundred of demes. Within patches, a stepping
stone of demes were connected by an appreciable level of
migration (m > 0.1), while the migration rate between
patches was much smaller (mbar << 0.1). Our model therefore resembles the model of Barton [22] within patches
and the model of Slatkin and Wiehe [21] between
patches.

The behaviour of the favourable mutation itself has
already been described by Pialek and Barton [41]. We
obtained the same results with our deterministic simulations. Indeed, positive selection generates a Fisherian

wave of advance of the selected allele that spreads through
the metapopulation at a constant speed (proportional to
migration and selection) until it reaches the barrier to
gene flow. After a delay which depends on the strength of
the barrier, the favourable allele inevitably crosses the barrier. The relation between the delay and the strength of the
barrier is logarithmic and very strong barriers are required
to produce appreciable delays [41]. Once the favourable
allele finally crosses the barrier the wave of advance forms
again but transiently accelerates (Figure 7). This surprising
behaviour has been described and discussed by Pialek and
Barton [41]. The wave is broadened by the barrier and
hence transiently spreads faster than a Fisherian wave and
later progressively slows down to its equilibrium speed
while recovering a Fisherian shape [41].
We now investigate the effects of the sweep at the selected
locus on neutral variation at a linked locus. We first
describe the process with a set of parameters that produces
the effect sought. In the left patch in which the favourable
B allele originates within the first left deme, the neutral A
allele initially linked with B takes the lift and follows the
wave of advance (Figure 8). However, recombination
breaks the hitchhiking effect – the A allele does not reach
fixation in any deme and its rise in frequency is gradually
attenuated. The selective sweep thus generates a gradient
in allele frequency (Figure 8). After the delay required for
the favourable allele to cross the barrier has elapsed,
hitchhiking starts again on the other side of the barrier, in

the right patch. However, the effect is lessened in proportion to the strength of the barrier. The rise in allele frequency being slighter, a step in allele frequency is
generated (Figure 8). In other terms, the delay imposed by
the barrier to the spread of the favourable allele represents
an additional time window for recombination to act and
dissociation between the neutral allele and the selected
allele to occur. Once the sweep is finished, migration
homogenises allele frequencies within each patch leading
to flat curves while the barrier slows down homogenisation between patches. The consequence is to further
increase the step in allele frequency between the two
patches.
Under our deterministic model, the magnitude of the
effect mainly depends on two parameters: the r/s ratio (as
in any hitchhiking model [22]) and the strength of the
barrier [29]. The number of demes and the migration rate
between demes within patches has an effect on the gradient in allele frequency within patches and therefore
mainly affect the second phase once the sweep is finished
but the step in allele frequency still increases because
allele frequencies homogenise in each patch. However,
the effect of these two parameters is secondary to the barrier strength and r/s. In Figure 9 is presented the magnitude of the step in neutral allele frequency between the
two patches, Δp, produced at the end of our simulations
(when homogeneity is reached within patches) as a function of r/s for various barrier strengths. When r/s is very
small, the A allele reaches high frequencies everywhere,
even behind the barrier in the second patch, and Δp is
small. When r/s is large, the hitchhiking effect is weak everywhere, even before the barrier in the first patch, and Δp
is also small. For intermediate values of r/s, appreciable Δp
values can be produced providing the strength of the barrier is strong enough. The relation with the strength of the
barrier appears to be logarithmic, as is the delay of crossing [41]. To summarise, our simple model predicts that
substantial population structure can be generated when a
strong barrier exists and the r/s ratio takes intermediate
values.

Discussion
Our eleven-locus FST scan of the Mytilus edulis genome provided clear results: one locus, EFbis, behaved very differently from the other 10 loci (Figure 2A) and the outlier
test of Beaumont and Nichols [25] allowed us to validate
the impact of selection on this locus (Figure 2B). The
approach of scanning genomes for FST outliers is becoming a standard in molecular ecology [42] and the number
of studies that inferred candidate loci for adaptation
through this approach is increasing rapidly [43-45]. These
studies often used molecular markers that do not easily
allow reconstructing the genealogical relationship among
alleles, such as microsatellites or AFLPs. Although selected
loci are discovered, one can get little information on the
exact form of selection that is/was responsible for the discrepancies observed at these loci. DNA sequence polymorphism allows a more precise analysis of selective effects
but the approach of scanning genomes for regions of low
nucleotide diversity [17,31] is rarely simultaneously conducted with FST scans. Few studies have pursued the analysis of an FST-outlier locus by a more refined analysis of
DNA sequence variation [30,46]. The results we here
obtained in the analysis of DNA sequence polymorphism
at an FST-outlier locus were in remarkable agreement with
the FST-scan approach as we observed a clear departure
from mutation-drift equilibrium in the form of a clade of
alleles with a star-shaped genealogy (clade A1* in Figure
5). We are now in a position to discuss the various possible selective scenarios which could have created the pattern of differentiation observed.
The genetic structure observed at the EF1α gene between
M. edulis populations is not a consequence of differential
introgression
When we undertook the analysis of DNA sequences at the
EF1α gene we had in mind the hypothesis of adaptive
introgression of a galloprovincialis allele within the M. edulis patch of the Bay of Biscay. We are now in position to
dismiss this interpretation, as our data establish that
introgression does not interfere with differentiation
between M. edulis populations at the EFbis locus. The phy-

logenetic analysis of DNA sequence polymorphism
revealed the strong divergence that exists between alleles
of the two species and only a single introgressed allele has
been sampled (Figure 4). The analysis of allele frequencies
allowed us to study more precisely introgression levels.
Although introgression appeared to be slightly stronger in
the enclosed patch of the Bay of Biscay than in the Northern peripheral patch, introgression is low in both patches
and does not perturb the analysis of the differentiation
between the two M. edulis patches.
Indirect hitchhiking selection
In this section, we would like to settle whether selection
acted directly on the locus surveyed or indirectly on a
linked locus. The EF1α gene is recognised to be under
strong purifying selective constraints and is not a good
candidate for short term adaptive evolution. In addition,
the few polymorphic non-synonymous mutations
observed were in low frequency (singletons or doubletons). Furthermore, as we did not detect recombination in
our data, the hitchhiking effect of a favourable mutation
localised within the sequence surveyed should have eliminated all linked variation and produced a perfect star
genealogy on which new post-hitchhiking mutations
would map. In the presence of recombination between a
selected locus and the locus studied, hitchhiking should
have been incomplete and ancestral lineages could have
survived to the sweep producing a partially star-shaped
genealogy [4]. The genealogies obtained, in which such
sweep-surviving lineages have been sampled (Figure 5)
are therefore in much better agreement with the hypothesis of indirect selection.

As selection must have been indirect, an inevitable question is the chromosomal distance that separates the
selected locus and the locus surveyed. With the data at
hand we cannot answer precisely this question but can try
to give some indications. The chromosomal length
affected by a selective sweep mainly depends on the
strength of selection, the recombination rate, the population size, and the time elapsed since the sweep [47-49].
Here, the sweep would be young enough for a quasi
absence of younger coalescence than the multifurcated
one produced by the sweep (Figure 5). The population
size, N, is negatively correlated with the magnitude of the
hitchhiking effect. Given the very large population size for
M. edulis, one may argue that a selective sweep would not
have effects extending very far on either side of the adaptive substitution which may therefore possibly belong to
unsequenced portion of the EF1α gene itself. However,
thorough investigations of the effect of N on the hitchhiking effect showed that it is not as large as that determined
by the r/s ratio [6,49]. In fact, the main effect of N is to
determine p0 the initial frequency of the favourable
mutant (p0 = 1/2N), and was already incorporated in the
deterministic model of Maynard Smith and Haigh [3],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/164

while the effect of a finite population size is negligible as
soon as N is not too small [49]. In the single population
deterministic model, the final frequency after the sweep,
u*, of the neutral allele A that hitchhikes with the favourable mutation is:
u* = u0 + (1-u0) p0 r/s

(1)

where u0 is the initial frequency of A and p0 the initial frequency of the favourable mutation [22]. Taking into
account the gene diversity observed in the M. galloprovincialis sample (Hd = 0.99) that has not been influence by
hitchhiking selection, one can easily assume u0 to be small
and simply approximate equation 1 by:
u*~(2N)-r/s

(2)

Equation 2 allows us to have an idea of the r/s ratio
required to produce the frequency of A1* allele observed
in the sample of the North Sea (WS), which was ~0.9. For
instance, r/s would need to be 0.015 if N = 103, 0.008 if N
= 106, 0.006 if N = 108. Although we have no idea of the
local recombination rate in the region of the mussel
genome in which EF1α is located, we know that the
recombinational size of the M. edulis genome is ~1000 cM
[50] and the physical size is ~1500 Mb [51], which leads
an average recombination rate of 0.7 cM/Mb (as an indication, the same calculation in Drosophila melanogaster
would give 1.5 cM/Mb). The distance, d, in Kb that separates the EFbis locus and the selected locus is therefore
estimated to be ~1000s (e.g. 1 Kb when s = 0.001, 100 Kb
when s = 0.1).
Selective scenarios: contemporary local adaptation versus
past unconditional positive selection
Usually high FST outliers are interpreted as being the consequence of local adaptation [25,42,52]. The simplest
form is disruptive selection on a bi-allelic locus in a twohabitat model, one allele being favoured in one habitat
and the other allele being favoured in the other habitat. It
has been shown that local selection produces higher FST
values than expected without, and footprints on the diversity at linked neutral loci [20,43]. Under such a scenario,
the derived favoured mutation at the selected locus
responsible for the star-shaped clade of alleles at the neutral locus (A1* in Figure 5) would have been fixed by positive selection in populations of the North Sea only while
being counter-selected in populations of the Bay of Biscay.
The presence of alleles of the clade A1* in the enclosed
patch of the Bay of Biscay would be a consequence of
recombination and gene flow. However, our data revealed
many A1* alleles in the Bay of Biscay and very few A2 alleles in the North Sea. In the local adaptation scenario, this
would imply asymmetric effects of recombination and
neutral gene flow (predominantly from the North Sea to
the Bay of Biscay but not the reverse), which are hard to

explain. Besides, although some may inevitably point to
some environmental differences between the North Sea
and the Bay of Biscay (e.g. temperature), it is not clear that
these differences should be more pronounced that the
environmental heterogeneity observed within each patch.
We therefore hypothesised that the same favourable
mutation had gone to fixation in the two populations
[29], although this hypothesis is rarely considered to
explain high FSTs. The interest of this hypothesis is to be
inherently asymmetric because the wave of advance of a
favourable allele is directional from its patch of origin to
the other. The simple model we developed to illustrate
this scenario together with the few available models of
genetic hitchhiking in subdivided populations [21-23]
show that the hitchhiking effect is expected to diminish as
the favourable mutation spreads from the deme in which
it originates. The presence of a barrier to gene flow amplifies the effect (Figure 8) owing to the delay produced to
the spread of the favourable allele and to the peculiar
behaviour of a wave of advance when crossing a barrier
[41]. This would explain the moderate frequency of clade
A1* and the persistence of unswept alleles (e.g. clade A2)
in the Bay of Biscay. The genealogy presented in Figure 5
fits very well with a genealogical interpretation of the
model. Although our model is bi-allellic, one simply has
to imagine that the unswept allele, a, is composed of old
lineages that survived the sweep (non-A1* sequences) and

the swept allele, A, is composed of young lineages belonging to the star genealogy (A1* sequences). The moderate
frequency of the swept allele would also explain why statistics that summarise the mutation frequency spectrum
such as Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H did not capture the
departure from the standard coalescent in the second
patch [4], although methods that incorporate the additional information of linkage disequilibrium can [16].
Furthermore, the delay required for the wave to cross the
barrier should result in a younger coalescence (smaller terminal branches) of the lineages affected by the selective
sweep (A1*) in the patch of the Bay of Biscay, a tendency
that is actually observed in Figure 5. However, the barrier
needs to be strong in order to generate the observed step
in allele frequency, Δp~0.4 (Figure 9, also see [21]). Furthermore, we have seen that the r/s ratio needed to be
small in order to generate a high frequency of A1* allele
in the North Sea (0.005 <r/s < 0.02). Combining the two
observations allows deducing that the migration rate
between the two patches needs to be lower than mbar~108 (dot in Figure 9).
A necessary hypothesis of the hitchhiking in space scenario is that selection should be a stronger force than
genetic drift. Otherwise the barrier to gene flow between
the two patches of M. edulis would produce detectable FST
at other neutral loci than EFbis. This assumption is present
in the models of Slatkin and Wiehe [21] and ours that are
deterministic. To employ the terminology developed by
Gillespie [14], genetic drift should be a minor force relative to genetic draft, the impact of indirect selection on
neutral variability. The scenario proposed would therefore
mainly concern species with large effective population
sizes. Although their effective size has often been debated
[53], marine bivalves are known to reveal among the
highest levels of genetic diversity ever observed within the
animal kingdom [54-56]. Levels of diversity observed in
Mytilus are in accordance with this view (Table 1). Indeed,
marine bivalves are good candidates for the genetic draft
model as was established for mitochondrial DNA [55]
and suspected for nuclear genes [57].
Another question that emerges is the nature of the barrier
to gene flow. A first possibility is geographic isolation, as
is observed nowadays. The enclosed situation of the M.
edulis patch of the Bay of Biscay isolates it from peripheral
populations. Assuming that the local biogeography (i.e.
the mosaic structure observed nowadays) has been stable
for a while, the two M. edulis patches might be connected
only by very rare events of long range dispersal. Alternatively, one can imagine that the favourable mutation has
had to transit through the M. galloprovincialis genomic
background before reaching the enclosed patch of M. edulis. Under this scenario the mutation would need to be
neutral or slightly deleterious in the M. galloprovincialis

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:164

background although favourable in the M. edulis background. It is also possible that the sweep predates the
mosaic structure observed nowadays. We would therefore
need to consider the possibility that the barrier was
genetic instead of physical. The genetic barrier would simply have come to coincide secondarily with a region of
low dispersal as theoretically expected [58]. In a sense
considering a genetic barrier amounts to consider the first
scenario again -that the two M. edulis populations are
structured into two backgrounds in such a way that at least
in the genomic region of the EF1α gene, mixtures of genes
from North Sea and Bay of Biscay are counter-selected.
However, even if divergent selection occurs in the background, a neutral allele of the screened locus is assumed
to have hitchhiked with an unconditionally favourable
mutation from its background of origin to the other.

Conclusion
To conclude, we have shown that, in a structured population, a selective sweep at a positively selected linked locus
is a simple scenario to account for unusually high level of
differentiation at a marker locus. This scenario has rarely
been considered in the literature [29] and likely applies to
the example of the EF1α gene in M. edulis. However we
cannot completely exclude more complex scenarios of
local adaptation, whereby the selected allele responsible
for the selective sweep would be confined in its patch of
origin. A decisive (though very demanding) test would
require walking on the chromosome toward the direct target of selection: under the scenario of local adaptation FST
should increase [43] while under the scenario of unconditional positive selection FST should decrease (Figure 9,
[29]).
Distinguishing the two scenarios ('local adaptation' and
'hitchhiking in space' [29]) is not unnecessary subtlety, it
has important consequences on our appreciation of the
cost paid by species to adapt to local environmental variation. It is very different to conclude that ~10% (one of
eleven randomly chosen loci) of the genome has been
marked by the footprint of past positive selection or ~10%
of the genome is affected by a polymorphism maintained
by selection in a heterogeneous environment. This is the
reason why the 'hitchhiking in space' hypothesis should
be considered more closely in genome scan studies.

Methods
Sampling
On the basis of previous publications, we selected four
geographic samples of 48 individuals to represent each of
four species patches: FA (Faro, Algarve, Portugal) and PR
(Primel, Brittany, France) respectively representative of M.
galloprovincialis populations of the Atlantic Coasts of the
Iberian Peninsula and Brittany, and LU (Lupin, CharentePoitou, France) and WS (Wadden Sea, Holland) respec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/164

tively representative of M. edulis populations of the Bay of
Biscay and the North Sea (Figure 1). The PR sample was
described in Bierne et al. [33]. Samples FA and LU are new
samples collected in the same sites as samples Faro and
Brouage described in Bierne et al. [33]. Sample WS is a
new sample collected in the middle of a well characterised
peripheral patch of the hybrid zone, well away from the
transition zones. Additionally, we used a sample of M.
trossulus (GD) from Gdansk (Poland) in the Baltic Sea as
an outgroup. The new samples were treated as previously
described [33,59] except that we used the phenol-chloroform protocol to extract genomic DNA rather than the
Chelex protocol.
Outlier tests
In order to test that the level of differentiation observed at
the EFbis locus was significantly higher than the level of
differentiation observed at other loci between the peripheral M. edulis population of the North Sea and the internal
patch of the Bay of Biscay, we compiled data on 5 allozyme loci (EST D, LAP, PGI, OCT, MPI) from Coustau et al.
[34] and 6 nuclear DNA loci (EFbis, mac-1, Glu5', DAMP1,
DAMP2, DAMP3) from Bierne et al. [60]. The patch of the
Bay of Biscay was represented by samples "Noirmoutier"
and "Royan" of Coustau et al. [34] for allozyme loci and
samples "Brouage" and "Boyar" of Bierne et al. [60] for
nuclear DNA markers. The patch of the North Sea was represented by samples "Caen" and "Danemark" of Coustau
et al. [34] for allozyme loci and samples "Grand-FortPhilippe", "Tichwell" and "Cley" of Bierne et al. [60] for
nuclear DNA markers. We first depicted the diversity
observed in each patch at each locus by computing unbiased gene diversities [61] and estimating their confidence
intervals by permutation techniques with the Genetix 4.0
software [62]. Secondly, we used the method of Beaumont and Nichols [25] to identify loci that depart from
the expected neutral distribution of FST. The average and
95% confidence interval of single locus FST as a function of
heterozygosity was obtained from simulations performed
with the fdist2 program. In order to be as conservative as
possible, we used several set of parameters (number of
demes, mutation model etc.) and used parameters that
maximized the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval.
Analysis of the genetic composition of samples
The four newly sampled populations were analysed at the
same three loci used by Bierne et al. [33], EFbis, mac-1 and
Glu-5'. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis were performed as previously described. The fluorescent dye 5' end-labelled-primer technique was used,
with dye 6-FAM (Sigma Genosys) for the forward primer
of mac-1 and the primer Me15 of Glu-5' and TAMRA
(Sigma Genosys) for the primer EFbis-F. Gels were

scanned in a FMBIO II fluorescence imaging system
(Hitachi Instruments) at 505 and 605 nm.
We performed a correspondence analysis (CA) on the
matrix of allele counts per sample using the Genetix 4.0
software [62]. This CA was performed in order to verify
that the genetic composition of the four samples chosen
for DNA sequencing matched the expectation from their
geographic location. We used 11 previously analysed samples chosen to be representative of the four geographic
patches: Faro (a previous sample from Portugal performed
at the same location as sample FA), Setubal, Biarritz,
Brouage, Boyard, Moguériec, Morlaix, Polzeath, GrandFort-Philippe, Cley, Tichwell [33]. In addition, homogeneity of allelic frequencies between pairs of populations was
tested by an exact test using the Genepop software [63]
which allowed us to group samples with the same genetic
composition. Finally, departure from Hardy-Weinberg and
linkage equilibrium was tested with the Maximum-likelihood method of Barton [35] using species-specific compound alleles as described in Bierne et al. [33].
DNA polymorphism
DNA sequences were obtained on a longer fragment of the
EF1α gene than the EFbis locus, including the full region
screened for length polymorphism. The new locus named
EFseq was approximately one kilobase long (the shortest
observed allele was 1013 bp long and the longest
observed allele was 1349 bp long) and includes the second and the third introns, the third exon and portions of
the second and fourth exons of the EF1 α gene. EFseq was
amplified with the same reverse primer as EFbis, EFbis-R
[38], which was designed in the fourth exon of EF1α, and
a newly designed forward primer, EFseq-F (5'-AGGCTCCTTCAAGTACGCCTGGG-3'), designed in the second
exon. The protocol of PCR reactions was the same as the
one described for the EFbis locus [38] except that the
annealing temperature was increased to 60°C and the
elongation step was increased to one minute. The following steps -which include purification of PCR products,
cloning and sequencing- were done following the markrecapture (MR)-cloning protocol described in Bierne et al.
[36]. Briefly, MR-cloning allowed us to perform a single
cloning reaction per population samples. Each individual
of a sample were PCR-amplified separately using 5'-tailed
primers with small poly-nucleotide tags. PCR products of
similar quantities were mixed together and cloned into a
pGEM-T vector by using a Promega pGEM-T cloning kit
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Clones were sequenced
with universal plasmid primers. The individual from
which a sequence comes was identified by the tag
sequences upstream of each initial primer. A consequence
of the MR-cloning protocol is that the sample size is not
completely under control. Within a given number of
sequenced clones, the same allele of the same individual

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/164

(recognised using the nucleotide tag) can be cloned several times, while some alleles or individuals are absent.
Therefore the number of different sequences obtained is
less than, although positively correlated to, the number of
positive clones sequenced (called the effort of capture in
[36]). However, an interesting side-effect of this protocol
is the opportunity to assess the error rate due to mutations
during the cloning and amplification process. Singleton
mutations (which are important indicators of selective or
demographic effects) are particularly sensitive to such
artefacts; by restricting the analysis to sequences that were
captured twice or more for the same individual, one can
assess the potential impacts of artefacts [36].
Sequence analyses
Sequence alignment was performed with ClustalW [64] in
the BioEdit interface [65] and verified by eye. For each
sequence, the size of the region corresponding to the EFbis
locus was computed. Alignment gaps were then excluded
from the analyses. To give a representation of allele genealogy, phylogenetic reconstructions were obtained with
Mega 3.1 [66] using the neighbour-joining (NJ) algorithm
with number of nucleotide differences. We used DNAsp
[67] to compute basic population genetic parameters: the
number of polymorphic sites, the number of synonymous, non-synonymous and non-coding mutations, levels of nucleotide diversity estimated from the number of
polymorphic sites, θW [68], or from pairwise differences,
θπ [37], and the minimum number of recombination, RM,
estimated by the method of Hudson and Kaplan [69].
DNAsp was also used to compute some indicators of the
distortion of the allele frequency spectrum from the neutral expectation at mutation-drift equilibrium. Tajima's D
[39] is a well-known statistic that proved very efficient to
detect a shift of the allele frequency spectrum towards
low-frequency polymorphism. The Fay and Wu's H test
[4] is a more recent improvement that focuses on high frequency derived mutations, an excess of which is a specific
footprint of a selective sweep. Departure from the neutral
expectation at mutation-drift equilibrium was tested by
coalescent simulations without recombination conditional on the number of segregating sites [70] that here
proved to be the most conservative procedure. To the
summary statistic approaches we added the coalescencebased maximum-likelihood method of Galtier et al. [16].
This method is designed to detect a distortion in the shape
of gene genealogies generated by a diversity-reducing
event (hitchhiking or bottleneck). The likelihood of a
model in which a drop in effective size of strength S
occurred at time T in the past is compared to the likelihood of a constant-size model. Galtier et al. [16] defined
S as the time that would be required to generate the same
amount of coalescence if the population size had not
changed. S is therefore expressed in coalescent time units
(i.e. units of 2Ne generations).

Deterministic model of genetic hitchhiking in a subdivided
population
We developed a simple simulation model in order to illustrate the impact of a barrier to gene flow on the hitchhiking process. We modelled the fixation of an advantageous
mutation and its effect on a linked neutral locus in large
populations with a deterministic approach [3,21]. We
used a classical linear one-dimensional stepping-stone
model composed of 200 demes. The migration rate
between demes was m (m/2 in either direction). A barrier
to gene flow was positioned in the middle of the metapopulation. The migration rate was mbar (mbar <<m)
between deme 100 and deme 101. We considered two biallelic haploid loci with recombination rate c between
them. One locus was neutral and the other was under positive selection. At the selected locus, allele B has a selective
advantage s over the alternative allele b. Initially, all the
demes were fixed for b and allele B was introduced in the
first deme on the left side of the chain at a frequency p0. At
the neutral locus, we assumed that one allele, A, was initially in frequency u0 in all the demes of the chain (the
other allele, a, being at frequency 1-u0). Allele B at the
selected locus was initially on a chromosome carrying A at
the neutral locus. Genotypic frequencies in each deme at
a given generation are deduced from the frequencies of
the previous generation after accounting for migration,
recombination and selection. We registered the evolution
of allele frequencies and the speed of the wave of advance.
To calculate the speed, the centre of the wave was defined
as the deme in which the B allele frequency was closer to
0.5. A Borland Delphi 4.0 program is available from the
authors upon request.
