Abstract
Background: Horizontal gene transfer is central to evolution in most bacterial species. The
detection of exchanged regions is often based upon analysis of compositional characteristics and
their comparison to the organism as a whole. In this study we describe a new methodology
combining aspects of established signature analysis with textual analysis approaches. This approach
has been used to analyze the two available genome sequences of H. pylori.
Results: This gene-by-gene analysis reveals a wide range of genes related to both virulence
behaviour and the strain differences that have been relatively recently acquired from other
sequence backgrounds. These frequently involve single genes or small numbers of genes that are
not associated with transposases or bacteriophage genes, nor with inverted repeats typically used
as markers for horizontal transfer. In addition, clear examples of horizontal exchange in genes
associated with 'core' metabolic functions were identified, supported by differences between the
sequenced strains, including: ftsK, xerD and polA. In some cases it was possible to determine which
strain represented the 'parent' and 'altered' states for insertion-deletion events. Different signature
component lengths showed different sensitivities for the detection of some horizontally transferred
genes, which may reflect different amelioration rates of sequence components.
Conclusion: New implementations of signature analysis that can be applied on a gene-by-gene
basis for the identification of horizontally acquired sequences are described. These findings highlight
the central role of the availability of homologous substrates in evolution mediated by horizontal
exchange, and suggest that some components of the supposedly stable 'core genome' may actually
be favoured targets for integration of foreign sequences because of their degree of conservation.

Background
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen associated with
gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma, and rare
lymphomas [1]. It has a highly panmictic population
structure in which homologous recombination makes the

predominant contribution to sequence differences within
a highly diverse population structure [2]. The acquisition
of genes from other strains and species is by far the most
rapid evolutionary process. This occurs frequently without
loss of existing functions, is central to the evolution of

niche-adaptive and pathogenic characteristics of bacteria,
and greatly influences inter-strain differences in gene
complement [3-5]. In this context, it is notable that none
of the traits typically used to differentiate E. coli from Salmonella can be attributed to point mutation genes but are
broadly attributable to horizontal exchange [6]. H. pylori
is relatively unusual in that it is a naturally transformable
Gram-negative species that does not appear to have a species-specific DNA uptake sequence and appears to rely
upon its niche separation as a transformation barrier [7].
Disease associated H. pylori strains have been divided into
two types, type I being those that carry the cag pathogenicity island [8] (cag PAI), which has a foreign species origin,
and are associated with more severe disease.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/9

based upon classical text analysis that allows analysis of
genomes gene-by-gene is described. Analysis of H. pylori
sequences, combined with comparisons of the identified
genes between genomes, reveals complex changes that
influence both niche-adaptive and core functions illustrating a previously unpredicted range of functions which
are continuously undergoing variation and selection.

Results and discussion
Genes were ranked on the basis of their divergence from
the mean genome composition. The degree of divergence
that is indicative of acquisition from other species is not
an absolute. The frequency with which genes are acquired,
the untypicality of the donated material, and the rate at
which they are ameliorated to the host sequence composition influence it. Strains J99 and 26695 had 53 (Table 1)
and 60 (Table 4) genes respectively with DNS that were >2
SD from the mean. Those with annotated functions
included genes from the cag pathogenicity island (6 and
5), vac and related toxins (3 and 4), and restriction-modification genes (2 and 4). On the basis of the similarities
determined in the H. pylori strain J99 sequence annotation, 7 of the most divergent genes as determined by DNS
are not present in strain 26695. Likewise, 2 of the 50 most
divergent genes in strain 26695 are not present in strain
J99. This is consistent with the identification of genes
acquired from other species that have not extended to
both sequenced strains. It also suggests that a significant
proportion of the 6 to 7% of genes unique to one or other
strain [18] are inherent to the Helicobacter gene pool, but
are variably present in different strains rather than reflecting recent foreign origins. Comparisons of a selection of
identified orthologous genes in the two strains are shown
in Figure 1.

Dinucleotide composition is highly stable within a
genome and can distinguish between sequences from different species. Based upon its constancy the species composition is referred to as a 'genome signature' [9,10]. This
characteristic has been applied to assessments of DNA
metabolic processes such as methylation and base conversion, DNA structure, and evolutionary relationships. It
has also become established as a method for the identification of sequences that have been acquired by inter-species horizontal transfer. For example, lateral transfer has
recently been shown using these methods for a tryptophan pathway operon [11], the gain of additional metabolic functions in Pseudomonas putida [12], a
determination that many gain of function genes have
been acquired by E. coli rather than lost from S. typhi [13],
and more recently developed Bayesian methods based
upon similar premises have been used to assess global signatures and determine the origins of some lateral transfer
events [14,15]. However there are problems associated
with this and other methods that use progressive 'walking
windows', and the larger the window the greater the problems. These result from the inclusion of intergenic
sequence, the inability to distinguish divergences due to a
single highly divergent gene from that from a cluster of
less divergent ones, and an inability to identify the limits
of the abnormal regions. In practice additional features
are necessary to determine the ends of such regions, such
as the location of repeats typical of pathogenicity islands
in H. pylori [16], or comparisons with other sequences as
in N. meningitidis strain MC58 [17]. In addition, divergence scores are influenced by the size of the sampling
window used such that sampling effects limit analysis of
sequences shorter than about 800 bp (data not presented), and the need to use fixed window sizes prevents
gene by gene studies.

It cannot be assumed that all genes identified in this manner have been recently acquired. It is necessary to assess
the nature of the sequence to determine if its divergence
might be accounted for on the basis of features of the
encoded protein. For example, JHP0476/HP0527,
JHP1300/HP1408 and JHP0074/HP0080 include repetitive sequences likely to account for their DNS divergence.
This type of analysis cannot be used to determine the possible foreign origin of such genes. Notably, the most divergent cag PAI gene (the 1st and 2nd most divergent gene in
the whole genomes of strain 26695 and J99 respectively,
JHP0476/HP0527) has a highly complex repetitive structure and the size of the large divergent peak associated
with this island using previous methods is largely due to
the presence of this gene.

We describe the use of a linear implementation of signature analysis that can efficiently address a range of walking
window sizes using dinucleotide signatures (DNS) and
longer signatures. In addition, use of a new approach

While a significant proportion of the genes identified in
this analysis are associated with regions including several
such genes and which share characteristics of islands of
horizontal transfer or pathogenicity islands, this is far

from universally true. There are many instances of single
genes or small numbers of genes that are present that are
not associated with any features that might otherwise
have been used as indicators of horizontal acquisition
such as transposases and flanking repeats.
Our initial goal was to identify recently acquired and
exchanged genes as candidates likely to be important in
niche-adaptation, host interactions, and alterations in
bacterial fitness. It has been argued that essential genes are
unlikely to be transferred successfully since recipient taxa
would already bear functional orthologues, which would
have experienced long-term co-evolution with the rest of
the cellular machinery. In contrast, it is proposed that
those under weak or transient selection â like those asso-

ciated with nonessential catabolic processes, new operons, and those providing new niche-adaptive changes are
likely to be successfully transferred and retained [19]. This
leads to a model in which a stable 'core genome' comprised of essential metabolic, regulatory, and cell division
genes provides a stable context for the more labile nonessential and niche adaptive genes. On this basis such
genes are used for phylogenetic studies and are thought to
provide a relatively constant background in which species
evolution occurs. Many of the genes identified for which
functions are known affect virulence or niche adaptive
genes, including: the vacuolating cytotoxin and related
toxins (2 and 3), urease and flagellar components, and
genes involved in iron acquisition. However, we also find
clear evidence, confirmed by differences between the two

Genes with > 2 SD divergence in each analysis are indicated in bold
NAH indicates No Annotated Homologue in the other sequence

genome sequences, that recent, and therefore relatively
frequent, horizontal transfer is not limited to genes associated with niche adaptation and virulence. Amongst the
core function genes identified were mutS, ftsK, xerD, and
polA. The comparisons of the latter three between the
sequence strains are shown in Figure 1f,g &1j. These comparisons support the results suggesting that these genes
have been the substrates for horizontal exchange between
species.
Tetranucleotide composition has been used for the consideration of the presence of palindromic sequences that
might be substrates for restriction systems and Chi sites
and the presence of unstable repeats mediating phase variation [10], but the use of longer component signatures
has not been used to identify horizontally acquired
regions in bacterial genomes. Following analysis of
eukaryotic sequences it was concluded that DNS captures

most of the departure from randomness in DNA
sequences and that longer component lengths correlate
highly with the DNS results [20]. Also, analysis of dinucleotides separated by no, one, or two other nucleotides
showed that separated pairs are more nearly random than
adjacent pairs and were concluded to be relatively
uninformative [9]. However, in preliminary analyses,
while results using the typically long walking windows
gave concordant results as previously reported, we found
that the use of smaller walking windows generated progressively more different patterns of divergence with other
length components. Using tetranucleotide (TNS) and hexanucleotide (HNS) signature analysis we find that, while
in some instances there is significant overlap between the
genes identified using the different component lengths,
there are substantial differences that indicate additional
horizontally transferred genes not identified by DNS
alone (Tables 2 to 6).

Genes with > 2 SD divergence in each analysis are indicated in bold
NAH indicates No Annotated Homologue in the other sequence

The 50 most divergent J99 ORFs by HNS included 26
(52%) that were not in the 53 (>2 SD) most divergent by
DNS, these included 11 restriction-modification system
genes and 6 others that were not annotated within the
strain 26695 genome sequence. The identification of
genes of a type known to be horizontally exchanged, and
different between the gene complements of the strains, is
strong corroboration for the foreign origin of the additional genes identified by HNS. In several instances
(Tables 2 to 6) the DNS did not detect these genes at all
e.g. restriction enzymes that were the 3rd, 13th and 41st
most divergent genes by HNS, were 319th, 857th and 750th
most divergent by DNS, respectively. In some instances
the TNS gave intermediate results and in others identified
other genes as more divergent than the other methods.
The TNS was most sensitive for the detection of rpoB
(HP1198 / JHP1121) which is associated with a significantly different gene length in the two strains (Figure 1h).
One explanation for this observation is that while the
DNS may initially be the most sensitive indicator of horizontal exchange it may become ameliorated to the new
sequence characteristics more rapidly that the longer
component features, which are probably detecting qualitatively different sequence characteristics.
The differences in the analyses using different length components, and a comparison of the results from the two
sequenced strains, suggest a complex evolutionary history

for the cag pathogenicity island. These suggest that it
probably has mosaic structure including sequences from
more than one species background, in addition to
sequence that is entirely typical of H. pylori.
It is normally impossible to determine the chronology of
events to distinguish insertions and deletions when
comparing strains. In strain 26695 there are two open
reading frames that are both good candidate coding
sequences. There is only one gene in this location in strain
J99 composed of the 5' gene from strain 26695 and the 3'
end of the subsequent gene. This could have arisen from
either a deletion or an insertion event. However, the normal DNS of the J99 gene (JHP0073, 799th in divergence)
and the 5' 26695 gene (HP0079, 751st in divergence), and
the high divergence of the 3' 26695 gene (HP0078, 68th in
divergence), indicate that the most likely event is an insertion into strain 26695 (Figure 1l). Likewise HP0119 is
likely to contain an insertion and JHP1113 probably
reflects the original sequences (Figure 1k).
The inclusion of two DNA metabolism genes associated
with recombination and repair is notable. Both mutS and
recN were identified in both strains (22nd and 35th, and
45th and 51st most divergent genes by DNS in strains
26695 and J99 respectively). When the homologous genes
were compared between the strains, extensive divergences
were evident between more than one region of each pro-

tein. That these genes have divergent signatures in both
strains suggests that neither has a wholly native composition. This observation is consistent with the models of
rapid evolution which suggest that transient competitive
advantages are enjoyed by organisms that are hypermutators under conditions of environmental stress and
transitions, and that these states which can be produced
by mutations in DNA repair genes [21-26]. However, such
states have to be reversed so that an unsustainable mutational burden is not attained, and it has been proposed
that this reversal is mediated by repair following horizontal transfer and homologous recombination, and that
such strains are hyper-recombinogenic [27-29]. The
untypicality of mutS and recN suggest that H. pylori is

another species that can make use of this strategy for
diversification under stressful conditions.
The identification of RNA polymerase genes, with associated differences between the strains, is striking. The
divergence of phylogenetic trees based upon different
sequences has been highlighted, and particularly the differences between the trees associated with RNA polymerase genes and rRNA [30,31]. It has been argued that RNA
polymerase is as essential to cell function as is rRNA and
that there is no compelling reason to chose rRNA as the
more reliable marker [32]. While the DNS analysis does
not address the stability of rRNA (and specifically
excludes the rRNA sequences because their differing coding requirements and evolutionary pressures generate a

* probably frame shifted components of the same vacA related gene
Genes with > 2 SD divergence in each analysis are indicated in bold
NAH indicates No Annotated Homologue in the other sequence

divergent signature for other reasons), it does indicate that
RNA polymerase can be a substrate for horizontal transfer,
and that trees based upon this gene, or other essential
genes, need not necessarily be considered a challenge to
rRNA based phylogenies.

Conclusions
The spectrum of recently horizontally acquired sequences
identified emphasizes the two driving forces of horizontal
exchange: the transfer of a phenotype which alters or
enhances bacterial fitness resulting in increased competitive fitness or altered niche adaptation, and the presence
of a substrate for homologous recombination. Because of
the focus upon, and relative ease of identifying, large
islands associated with readily identifiable features and
phenotypes, the importance of the latter component has

perhaps been underestimated. The genes that have been
considered to code for 'core metabolic' 'house-keeping'
functions are amongst those most likely to be changed by
horizontal transfer events because of the presence of
homologous substrates, and changes are likely to persist
even when the change is phenotypically neutral. Equally,
changes in the genes involved in core functions such as
gene expression and DNA metabolism may have pleotropic effects and there may be significant differences in
strain behaviour, that are not simply the consequence of
differences in their respective gene complements. The
selection of genes for phylogenetic analysis on the basis of
their coding for conserved core functions is also problematic because these are also frequently the genes most likely
to share the high homology that facilitates recombination
and horizontal exchange.

Methods

Authors' contributions

A traditional nucleotide signature is generated by segmenting a sequence of DNA into k equal-sized subsequences (or 'windows'). The mathematical basis for the
signature is an odds ratio â pi â calculated by dividing the
frequency of a length-L oligonucleotide by its expected
frequency. The odds ratios for each of the 4L oligonucleotides in each window (w) are compared with the odds
ratios for the overall sequence (s) [9,10,33]. The normalized difference Î´ is plotted and thus a nucleotide signature
consists of a k-length sequence of Î´ values: Î´(w,s) = (1/
4L)Î£(4L,i:x)|pi(w) - pi(s)|, where x is the set of all permutations of length L and i is one such permutation.

NJS initiated the project, performed the genome sequence
analyses, compared the two strains, interpreted the
results, and prepared the biological aspects of the manuscript. PB was a DPhil student who worked on the coding
aspects of the new methodology. JFP contributed to the
bioinformatics discussions and planning stage of this
project. SAJ directed and primarily developed the analysis
strategy and the implementation of the new
computational basis of the methodology, and prepared
the computational aspects of the manuscript.

There are interesting parallels between signature-style
genome analysis and stylometric techniques previously
used to determine the authorship of controversial literary
texts. This is analogous with the biological problem and it
is from this that our method is derived. Rather than using
a fixed-window signature, signature scores are calculated
for each coding open reading frame (ORF) and weighted
with variance estimates so that the scores for shorter ORFs
confer with their longer counterparts. Bissell's weighted
cusum
(cumulative
sum)
[34],

= 1/( n â 1)
/ wi ) â ((â Xi ) / â wi )} , is modified so that n denotes the number of ORFs in the genome,
Xi the number of oligonucleotides in ORF i, and wi the
number of nucleotides in ORF i. The results are scaled
according to ORF size using the standard error Ï =

â( Ï A *#ORF). In this way false positives are abrogated by

normalizing for over-representation of lower order
peptides.
The method is implemented in Java and efficiency is
maintained through an O(N) (N = sequence length)
refinement: probabilities for the complete sequence are
calculated in O(N) steps for any length-L oligonucleotide,
and maintain O(N) when 4L>N through a hashing function; the second part of the program calculates Ï for each
ORF using a loop flattening technique, thereby avoiding
the program having to recalculate overlapping sub-expressions. The program is available from ftp://ftp.dcs.war
wick.ac.uk/people/Stephen.Jarvis/ and http://www.mol
biol.ox.ac.uk/~saunders/.
Sequence alignments, as shown in Figure 1, were performed and displayed using the programs: Lalign and
viewed using Lalignview [35].
