Abstract
Background: Sialic acids comprise a family of nine-carbon amino sugars that are prevalent in
mucus rich environments. Sialic acids from the human host are used by a number of pathogens as
an energy source. Here we explore the evolution of the genes involved in the catabolism of sialic
acid.
Results: The cluster of genes encoding the enzymes N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NanA), epimerase
(NanE), and kinase (NanK), necessary for the catabolism of sialic acid (the Nan cluster), are
confined 46 bacterial species, 42 of which colonize mammals, 33 as pathogens and 9 as gut
commensals. We found a putative sialic acid transporter associated with the Nan cluster in most
species. We reconstructed the phylogenetic history of the NanA, NanE, and NanK proteins from
the 46 species and compared them to the species tree based on 16S rRNA. Within the NanA
phylogeny, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria do not form distinct clades. NanA from
Yersinia and Vibrio species was most closely related to the NanA clade from eukaryotes. To examine
this further, we reconstructed the phylogeny of all NanA homologues in the databases. In this
analysis of 83 NanA sequences, Bacteroidetes, a human commensal group formed a distinct clade
with Verrucomicrobia, and branched with the Eukaryotes and the Yersinia/Vibrio clades. We
speculate that pathogens such as V. cholerae may have acquired NanA from a commensal aiding their
colonization of the human gut. Both the NanE and NanK phylogenies more closely represented the
species tree but numerous incidences of incongruence are noted. We confirmed the predicted
function of the sialic acid catabolism cluster in members the major intestinal pathogens Salmonella
enterica, Vibrio cholerae, V. vulnificus, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pestis.
Conclusion: The Nan cluster among bacteria is confined to human pathogens and commensals
conferring them the ability to utilize a ubiquitous carbon source in mucus rich surfaces of the
human body. The Nan region shows a mosaic evolution with NanA from Bacteroidetes, Vibrio and
Yersinia branching closely together with NanA from eukaryotes.

Background
Sialic acid or neuraminic acid, is the designation of a family that encompasses over 50 naturally occurring and
structurally distinct nine-carbon amino sugars found both

in the Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, being the only ninecarbon sugar known to date in the latter [1]. Both names,
sialic acid and neuraminic acid, indicate the source of the
molecules from which they were first discovered: sialic,

saliva in Greek, and neuraminic, brain and amine [2]. The
most abundant and widely studied sialic acid is N-acetylneuraminic acid (2-keto-3-deoxy-5-acetamido-D-glyceroD-galacto-nonulosonic acid or Neu5Ac), with the rest of
the sialic acids being derivatives of Neu5Ac (Fig. 1) [1-4].
In eukaryotes, sialic acids are primarily found at terminal
positions of numerous glycoconjugates, and are involved
in a varied array of cell-cell interactions and cell-molecule
recognition, such as stabilizing glycoconjugates and cell
membranes, or acting as chemical messengers [5,6]. Thus,
the presence of sialic acid is crucial for the development of
vertebrates, with mutations in the synthesis pathway causing premature death of mice embryos [7]. Sialic acids are
widely found in Deuterostomes and recent speculation
suggests that they might appear in particular life stages or
in small quantities in Protostomes [8-10]. Sialic acids are
also found in Fungi and some protozoa, although the latter likely can only scavenge them from the host [11-13].
Current studies have shown that several bacterial pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi, Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, and
Streptococcus agalactiae can put sialic acid residues on their
outer surfaces (sialylate) masking them from the host
immune system [14-32]. Interestingly, these pathogens
have developed different mechanisms for obtaining sialic
acid that include de novo biosynthesis of sialic acid (E.
coli, N. meningitidis), sialic acid scavenging (N. gonorrhoeae), or precursor scavenging (H. influenzae) (Fig. 1)
[14-17].
Bacteria can also utilize sialic acid as a carbon and nitrogen source by scavenging it from the surrounding environment [1,18-23]. The catabolic pathway of sialic acid in
bacteria involves five steps (Fig. 1): first N-acetylneuraminic lyase (NanA) removes a pyruvate group from
Neu5Ac yielding N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), and
then N-acetylmannosamine kinase (NanK) adds a phosphate group at C6 position, which yields N-acetylmannosamine-6-P
(ManNAc-6P).
Next,
Nacetylmannosamine-6-P epimerase (NanE) epimerizes
the ManNAc-6P into N-acetylglucosamine-6-P (GlcNAc6P). Then, N-acetylglucosamine-6-P deacetylase (NagA)
removes the acetyl group from GlcNAc-6P and yields Glucosamine-6-P (GlcN-6P) whose amine group is removed
by Glucosamine-6-P deaminase (NagB), which is converted into Fructose-6-P (Fig. 1) [19,24-28]. Interestingly,
recent studies have shown an alternative in the catabolic
pathway of the gut commensal Bacteroides fragilis, which
does not encode NanK since the epimerase (NanE) does
not require a phosphorilated substrate to perform its metabolic reaction [23]. The genes encoding NanA, NanK,
and NanE are clustered together, however the location of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/118

the genes that encode NagA and NagB is highly variable,
in some cases being part of the cluster, such as in H. influenzae, or in most cases, scattered in the genome [1]. For
this reason, in this work we focused on nanA, nanK, and
nanE, which from now on we will refer to as the Nan cluster.
Few studies have investigated the ability to utilize sialic
acid as a carbon source or its relationship to bacterial
pathogenesis, even though the molecule is extensively
found in mucus rich environments such as the gut and
lungs where many pathogens thrive [18,21-23,28,29].
Sialic acid catabolism has been demonstrated in five species: Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, P. multocida, H. influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis [21-23,28,29]. Chang et al
showed in E. coli that the ability to degrade sialic acid was
important for the colonization of the mouse colon [18].
This finding suggests that the ability to utilize sialic acid as
a carbon source may be important for bacteria to colonize
this niche. To date, little is known about the distribution
of the Nan genes in the Bacterial kingdom and their evolutionary history [1,30,31]. de Koning and colleagues in
their analysis of inter domain transfer events found that
lateral gene transfer of nanA had occurred between bacteria and the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis based on
the phylogeny of 15 N-acetylneuraminate lyase protein
sequences [31]. Furthermore, their analysis also indicated
possible transfer between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
In this study, we examined the distribution of the Nan
cluster (nanA, nanE and nanK) among the 1,902 bacterial
genomes in the database and found that these genes have
an extremely limited distribution. The Nan cluster is confined to predominantly pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The cluster was present only in members of the
Gamma-Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria among Gramnegative bacteria, and Bacillales, Clostridia, and Lactobacillales among Gram-positive bacteria as well as Mycoplasma. We studied the gene order of the cluster, and
uncovered a surprising variability in its organization even
within members of the same genus. We identified a putative sialic acid transporter within the Nan clusters from 40
of the 46 species that contained the region. We describe
four novel sialic acid transporter types and found different
transporters associated with Nan within each major phylogenetic group. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of NanA, NanE, and NanK and demonstrated
that NanA evolved independently from NanE and NanK.
The NanA phylogenetic tree in particular revealed several
putative horizontal gene transfer events, one involving
transfer between domains. To examine further the evolution of N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NanA), the key
enzyme in sialic acid catabolism, we determined the distribution and phylogeny of all homologues in the data-

base. NanA was present in four additional bacterial
groups, α-Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes. The Bacteroidetes, members of the
human gut microbiota, formed a distinct clade with the
Verrucomicrobia and this clade is most closely related to
the eukaryotes. The Vibrio/Yersinia clade branched next to
the Bacteroidetes clade. We verified that sialic acid can be
used as a sole carbon source in a number of pathogenic
species, a capability that should confer a competitive
advantage in the heavily sialylated environments of the
human body.

Methods
Sequence retrieval and cluster identification
BLAST searches were used to identify homologues of
NanA, NanE, and NanK from Vibrio cholerae N16961 and
Staphylococcus aureus N315 in the database. We considered
three genes to form a Nan cluster if: 1) they were the best
matches in BLAST for NanA, NanE, and NanK from V.
cholerae N16961; 2) reciprocal BLAST searches of the three
genes against the V. cholerae N16961 genome hit on V.
cholerae N16961 NanA, NanE, and NanK; 3) the same
applied when performing BLAST search using NanA,
NanK, and NanE from S. aureus N315; 4) the three genes
were encoded and within 10 ORFs of each other. The
rationale for this approach was: A) to avoid false positives,
such as dihydropicolinate synthase, which shows similarity with NanA, and several sugar kinases that were
retrieved when we searched for NanK homologues; and B)
BLAST search using S. aureus N315 allowed us to avoid
false negatives due to the low similarity of S. aureus Nan
genes with the Nan genes from V. cholerae N16961.

The DNA sequences of the 16S rRNA from species encoding the Nan cluster were downloaded from GenBank.
When several strains from the same species encoded the
same cluster only a representative strain was included,
with the strain from the first sequenced genome chosen.
Sialic acid transporter identification
In order to identify putative sialic acid transporters within
the Nan cluster we used the NanT protein from E. coli K12

(b3224), the DctM protein component from the TRAP
transporter in V. cholerae (VC1777), and the SatB protein
from the SatABCD transporter from H. ducreyi (HD1670)
as seeds in our BLAST searches [32-34]. In addition, we
also examined the distribution of sialic acid biosynthesis
genes (neuA, neuB, and neuC) among the bacteria encoding the Nan cluster to determine whether there was a correlation between the presence of genes involved in sialic
acid catabolism and the genes required for the synthesis of
sialic acid de novo.
Sequence alignment
The sequences were aligned using ClustalW [35]. The
alignments were further checked manually using GeneDoc [36]. Large gaps and hypervariable sites were
removed from the alignments; the same was applied to
gaps at the beginning and end of the alignment, representing missing sequence data.
Phylogenetic analysis
We used prottest and modeltest (protein and DNA
sequences respectively) in order to choose the most
appropriate method to calculate the distances [37]. We
chose WAG with invariable sites for the Nan protein
sequences and GTR with invariable sites for 16S rRNA
sequences [38,39]. Three different tree-building methods
were used: Maximum Likelihood (ML), Bayesian analysis
(BY), and Neighbor Joining (NJ) as implemented in
PHYML and MrBayes 3.1.2, and MEGA 4 respectively [4043]. The Bootstrap values for ML and NJ trees were
obtained after 1000 generations. For the trees constructed
using BY the Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations. The burn-in values were set for 10,000 generations
and the trees were sampled every 100 generations. Splitstree and MEGA 4 tree viewer were used to visualize the
trees and calculate confidence values [43,44]. The topology of ML, NJ and BY trees were very similar, with differences in branch lengths and confidence values but not in
branching pattern. NJ and ML trees are included as additional files (see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).

GC content
We calculated the GC content of the sequences and compared it to the GC content of the whole genome. The formulae used for the calculations can be found in Karlin et
al., 2001 [45] (see Additional file 7).
Growth analysis of various species on minimal media
supplemented with sialic acid
We inoculated 2% (100 μl) of a 5 ml overnight LB broth
culture into 5 ml of M9 minimal media (V. cholerae
N16961, V. vulnificus YJO16, V. parahaemolyticus RIMD, V.
fischeri H905, Salmonella enterica INSP85, MOPS-based
minimal media (Yersinia pestis KIM D27), or M9 minimal
media supplemented with amino acids (Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 27729) [46]. All media were supplemented
with 1 mg/ml of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma) or DGlucose. The growth of each species was detected by
measuring the absorbance of the cultures at 595 nm using
a Sunrise 96-well plate reader by Tecan. The incubation
temperature was 30°C for all the species except for Y. pestis which was incubated at 26°C. The data obtained was
exported to an excel sheet, and the growth curves were
made using Sigma plot.

Results and Discussion
Distribution of Nan cluster
The distribution of the Nan cluster was remarkable in its
limited occurrence among the 730 finished and 1172
unfinished bacterial genomes examined. The Nan cluster
was present in 46 bacterial species and confined to six bacterial families of the Gamma-Proteobacteria, one member
of the genus Fusobacterium, and five bacterial families of
the Firmicutes, encompassing both low and high GC representatives (see Additional file 8).

Interestingly, apart from Photobacterium profundum, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, Shewanella pealeana, Psychromonas, and Vibrio, which are all aquatic bacteria, the Nan
cluster is only present in either commensal or pathogenic
bacteria (see Additional file 8). In fact, 42 species from the
46 where the Nan cluster was identified are human commensals or pathogens, 33 are known pathogens of either
humans or livestock. A total of 43% of the genomes in the
databases belong to pathogens, whereas 72% of the species that contain the Nan clusters are pathogenic. The
pathogens that encode the cluster are causative agents of a
wide range of diseases; many of them are intestinal pathogens such as E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia
enterocolitica, V. vulnificus and V. cholerae, the etiological
agent of cholera. Clostridium botulinum is the causative
agent of botulism, Haemophilus influenzae is a major cause
of lower respiratory infections and meningitis in children,
Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia, and Yersinia
pestis is the agent of plague. The nine human gut commensals that encode the Nan cluster include Anaerotruncus col-

ihominis, Dorea
formicigenerans, D.
longicatena,
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Ruminococcus gnavus, Lactobacillus sakei, L. plantarum, and
L. salivarius. Thus, the majority of the bacteria that encode
the Nan cluster colonize mucous regions of the human
body, such as the gut, lung, bladder, or oral cavity, where
sialic acid is highly abundant and it can serve as a source
of energy, carbon, and nitrogen.
We also examined the intraspecies distribution of the Nan
cluster to determine whether all strains from a species
encoded the cluster. We found that for most species all
sequenced strains contained the Nan cluster. However, a
few exceptions were noted. For example, of the eight fully
sequenced genomes of C. botulinum, only strain Eklund
encoded the Nan cluster. Among the six sequenced S.
pneumoniae strains, five (TIGR, D39, G54, Hungary 19 A6, and R6) encoded two Nan clusters whereas strain
CGSP14 does not contain the cluster. Similarly, for Salmonella enterica, two out of the nine sequenced strains do not
encode the Nan cluster (serovar Typhi Ty2 and CT18).
Among the 16 sequenced V. cholerae isolates, only the 10
sequenced pathogenic isolates encoded the Nan cluster.
To make the study tractable, we took the approach to
include in our analysis only the species that encoded the
three genes nanA, nanK, and nanE (the Nan cluster) which
were within 10 ORFs from each other. In addition, we
investigated the number of species that encoded NanA,
the key enzyme in the first step of sialic acid degradation,
but did not encode NanK or NanE. Overall, the distribution of NanA, from this analysis resembles that of the Nan
cluster with only four additional bacterial groups added,
two genera from α-Proteobacteria, and several members
of the Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes. Interestingly, members of the Bacteroides are well
known commensals of the human gut that in some cases
can become opportunistic pathogens. The mucinolytic
abilities of the Bacteroides have been documented, and
sialic acid seems to be an important carbon source for
these organisms [23,47]. However, Bacteroides does not
require the presence of NanK in order to catabolize sialic
acid [23]. The Verrucomicrobia are a recently described
phylum of Bacteria and are recovered from fresh water,
soil and human feces. Overall, the majority of the additional species identified as containing NanA were commensal or pathogens of humans.
Sialic acid transporters within the Nan cluster
Prior to its catabolism, sialic acid has to be transported
into the cell, unless there is endogenous biosynthesis (Fig.
1). To date there are three functionally characterized sialic
acid transporters: NanT, a single component system,
which belongs to the major facilitator superfamily, first
identified in E. coli; a tripartite ATP-independent periplas-

mic C4-dicarboxilate (TRAP) multicomponent transport
system, first identified in H. influenzae and Pasteurella multocida; and an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, first
identified in Haemophilus ducreyi [1,3,48]. We identified a
putative sialic acid transporter in 40 of the 46 species
examined, four of the seven families of transporters were
novel types associated with sialic acid (Table 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/118

All the Gamma-Proteobacteria that contained the Nan
cluster encoded one of three types of transporters within
the cluster: homologues of NanT, TRAP, or a novel
Sodium-glucose/galactose cotransporter, which belongs
to the SSS family of transporters (Table 1). The three
members of the Pasteurellaceae encoded the multicomponent TRAP transporter system, whereas all the Enterobac-

teriaceae examined encoded the NanT single component
transporter, similar to that present in E. coli (Table 1). All
members of the family Vibrionaceae, except V. fischeri,
encoded a TRAP transporter. Within the Nan cluster
among the Firmicutes, the predominant transporter associated with the Nan cluster belonged to SSS, ABC, or
Sodium/proline (Sym) family of transporters. None of the
Firmicute representatives examined encoded either the
NanT or the TRAP systems.
Co-occurrence of catabolic and biosynthetic sialic acid
gene clusters
From the 46 species that encoded the Nan cluster, only 10
species also encoded the genes for the biosynthesis of
sialic acid (neuAB) or nonulosonic acid (nul): F. nucleatum, R. gnavus, C. botulinum, S. pealeana, S. agalactiae, V.
fischeri, V. vulnificus, P. profundum, and Psychromonas.
There were only four species, A. pleuropneumoniae, H.
influenzae, H. somnus, and P. multocida that encoded only
NeuA, which is required for recognition of sialic acid by
sialyltransferases and subsequent sialylation of the bacterial cell surface, suggesting that the donor-scavenging
method of sialylation is limited. All the species that
encoded neuA and neuB also encoded neuC, with one
exception: F. nucleatum. As shown in other organisms,
Fusobacterium might scavenge a precursor of sialic acid
from its environment instead of synthesizing it de novo
[49]. It is well known that some E. coli strains can synthesize sialic acid and sialylate their surface [3]. However the
strains under study here do not encode neuA and neuB.

The distribution of the genes for the synthesis of sialic
acid/nonulosonic acid in the Bacterial kingdom is very
different from that of the Nan genes for catabolism. The
sialic acid/nonulosonic acid synthesis genes are considerably more widespread both ecologically and taxonomically. For example, a high number of marine bacteria
encode the Neu cluster such as species from the genera
Synechococcus, Salinibacter, Shewanella, Sphingopyxis, Chromobacterium, Hahella, Idiomarina, Prochlorococcus, Reinekea,
Tenacibaculum, Rhodopseudomonas, Thiomicrospira and
most members of the family Vibrionaceae, V. cholerae is
the notable exception.
Colinearity of the Nan cluster
The three main groups that contain the Nan cluster,
Gamma-Proteobacteria, Fusobacterium, and Firmicutes,
encode the nanA, nanE, and nanK genes in a different gene
order and on different strands (Fig. 2). In fact, the gene
order of the Nan cluster varies among families, and, to a
lesser extent, within families (Fig. 2). Within the GammaProteobacteria, there are seven variants of the Nan cluster,
each family having its own gene order with the exception
of the Enterobacteriaceae. Within this group,Yersinia species have a different gene order to E. coli, Shigella, and S.

enterica (Fig. 2). Interestingly, in all species examined
among the Gamma-Proteobacteria, except for Yersinia, the
nanK and nanE genes are clustered together and encoded
on the same strand, whereas the nanA gene is always separate from nanE and nanK by at least one gene (Fig. 2).
Among the 20 Firmicutes examined, there are 10 different
gene order combinations, but unlike Gamma-Proteobacteria, in only two cases did nanE and nanK cluster
together. There is no clear canonical gene order within the
Firmicutes, since the three genes cluster in almost all possible orders. This higher degree of variation of gene order
in Firmicutes compared to the Gamma-Proteobacteria
may reflect a long association within this diverse group
(Fig. 3a).
As is well known, operons are pervasive in Prokaryotes
[50]. However, the mechanisms underlying their evolution are not fully understood. Some authors argue that the
fact that some genes are located within a single co-transcribed region selects for a more efficient regulation [51].
Also, a group of genes encoding co-dependent functions
when forming an operon increases the likelihood of a
fully functional horizontal gene transfer event, a major
evolutionary force within bacterial evolution [51,52]. The
Nan cluster would fall within what is considered a
"destructed" operon, due to its loosely organized configuration, which might be due to rearrangements within its
host genome or during the possible HGT events that led
to its particular distribution, a scenario that is more widespread than previously thought [53,54]. Also it might
indicate the relatively new acquisition of the genes by the
bacterial kingdom, since fragmentation of well-adapted
ancient operons will at least require the evolution of regulatory elements, which might not confer a selective
advantage to the organism [55]. The latter hypothesis
could explain why the Nan cluster is so limited in its distribution.
Signatures of horizontal gene transfer
Typically, there are two main methods to detect putative
horizontal gene transfer events: Phylogenetic methods
and surrogate methods based on nucleotide composition.
In addition, the presence of transposases and/or integrases within a region may suggest a mode of transfer.
Therefore, we located all transposases and integrases
within or near the Nan cluster (see Additional file 9).
From the 46 species that encode the Nan cluster 12 species
contained transposases close to the region, with a noticeable abundance in C. perfringens SM101, L. salivarius
UCC118, S. pneumoniae TIGR B, and Y. pestis KIM (see
Additional file 9). In V. cholerae N16961, the Nan region,
is present on a pathogenicity island named Vibrio Pathogenicity Island-2 (VPI-2) and encodes an integrase [56].
Next, we compared the average GC content of the whole
genome (GCg) against the GC content of the Nan genes

(GCnan) shown as the difference between GCg and GCnan
(see Additional file 7). None of the nanA gene sequences
had a significant aberrant GC content (deviating from the
GCg by +/- 5). However, nanE and nanK from Yersinia spp,
Shigella spp, E. coli, S. enterica, Pasteurella and H. somnus
had significant aberrant GC content suggesting its evolutionary history differs from nanA. In S. pneumoniae TIGR
nanE and nanK from both clusters had an aberrant GC

content; suggesting an independent history for the two
clusters in this strain (see Additional file 7).
Phylogenetic analysis of NanA
The limited distribution of the Nan cluster, its variable
gene order, and the diversity of transporters within the
cluster, indicates mosaic evolution of the region (Fig. 2).

Nan region, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of
NanA, NanE, and NanK and compared the branching patterns of the three proteins with the topology for the species tree based on 16S rRNA sequences (Figs. 3, 4 and 5).
The nanA gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylneuraminic
lyase (NanA). As outgroups we included in our phylogenetic analysis NanA from four eukaryotes: Gallus gallus,
Ornithorhynchus anatinus, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens. Overall, within the NanA phylogenetic tree, Gramnegative and Gram-positive representatives did not form
two distinct lineages as in the 16S rRNA tree. Indeed, the
NanA tree can be subdivided in five main lineages (named
I, II, III, IV and V) (Fig. 3b), with Lineage I as the most
divergent clustering, encompassing Gram-negative genera, Actinobacillus, Haemophilus and Pasteurella, Fusobacteria, Gram-positive genera, Clostridium, Lactobacillus,
Staphylococcus, and Mycoplasma (Fig. 3b). Also within this
lineage is NanA from Trichomonas vaginalis, a protozoan
parasite that adheres to the urogenital tract, which
branches with members of the family Pasteurellaceae and
Fusobacterium nucleatum. The placement of T. vaginalis
with members of the Pasteurellaceae and not the eukaryotes indicates interdomain transfer of NanA from an
ancestor of Pasteurellaceae to a progenitor of T. vaginalis,
which was noted previously by others [30,31]. T. vaginalis
also encodes a homologue of NanK but does not encode
NanE. Within lineage I are three members of the genus
Staphylococcus, which cluster together, and within this
branch is NanA from C. botulinum and C. perfringens. The
NanA from Lactobacillus salivarius and L. plantarum branch
together within lineage I whereas NanA from L. sakei is
located within lineage III. All members of the genus Mycoplasma are found within lineage I (Fig. 3b). Members of
the Mycoplasma are obligate pathogens found in a wide
range of hosts, the primary habitats of human and animal
mycoplasmas are mucous membranes of the respiratory
and urogenital tracts, eyes, mammary glands and the
joints [57]. The nine highly related NanA protein
sequences from Shigella spp., E. coli, and S. enterica, gastrointestinal pathogens of humans form the separate lineage II (Fig. 3b).
The six Firmicutes not present within lineage I, cluster
together within lineage III, L. sakei, branching firmly with
Streptococcus, which suggests a common origin for NanA
in this group. The five additional commensals of the
human gut that contain NanA, D. formicigenerans, D. longicatena, R. gnavus, A. colihominis and F. prausnitzii, are also
present within this lineage (Fig. 3b).
The NanA protein from members of the families Vibrionaceae, Shewanellaceae, Psychromonadaceae, and Pseudoaltermonadaceae are all located within the divergent
lineage IV. Lineage IV branches away from both lineage I

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/118

and II, which contain the other Gamma-Proteobacteria
species examined. Thus, it appears that the origin of NanA
in lineage IV is unique. The six Yersinia NanA sequences
examined are also present within lineage IV and are unrelated to NanA from other species of Enterobacteriaceae
suggesting that there is not a single origin for nanA among
enterobacteria (Fig. 3a). Even more surprising is the close
proximity of lineage IV to lineage V representing NanA
from four eukaryotic species used as outgroups. A close
relationship between NanA from Vibrio/Yersinia was previously indicated by Andersson and colleagues in their analysis of NanA from 10 bacterial species [30].
In order to investigate further the relationship between
lineages IV and V, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree
including all sequences annotated as NanA in the genome
database (Fig. 4 and Additional files 10 and 11). In total,
we studied 83 putative NanA protein sequences from bacteria and an additional 18 NanA protein sequences from
eukaryotes. From this analysis, six additional Clostridium
species contain NanA (Fig. 4). Two human pathogens, C.
difficile and C. butyricum, cluster with C. botulinum, C. perfringens and pathogenic species of Staphylococcaceae, Pasteurellaceae and Mycoplasmataceae (Fig. 4). Four
Clostridium commensals cluster within three divergent
branches, C. leptum forms a single divergent branch, C. tertium and C. scindens cluster with commensals from the
family Ruminococcaceae, whereas C. bolteae clusters with
the γ-Proteobacteria Oceanicola granulosus (Fig. 4). The distribution of NanA from the different Clostridium species
on divergent branches of the tree indicates that in this species nanA was acquired multiple times and from different
sources. Six additional γ-Proteobacteria species contained
NanA, the majority of which are human commensals and
pathogens (Fig. 4). A note of interest is the placement of
NanA from the human commensal Proteus mirabilis, a
member of the Enterobacteriaceae, firmly within the Vibrionaceae suggesting a recent acquisition from a Vibrio (Fig.
4).
NanA was present in two genera from α-Proteobacteria,
and several members of the Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes. The NanA from the Gram-negative Bacteroidetes represents a large group of gut
commensal (Bacteroides caccae, B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. stercoris, B. uniformis, B. vulgatus, Parabacteroides distasonis, P.
merdae, Flavobacteriales bacterium) that formed a distinct
clade with five genera of the Verrucomicrobia and three
genera of Planctomycetes. This clade was most closely
related to the eukaryotes (Fig. 4). Planctomycetes are peptidoglycan-less bacteria with a shared compartmentalized
cell structure and divide by a budding process [58]. Verrucomicrobia is a divergent phylum within the domain Bacteria, which also contains a compartmentalized cell
structure similar to Planctomycetes [59]. It has been sug-

Phylogenetic trees of a) NanK and b) NanE
Phylogenetic trees of a) NanK and b) NanE. The trees were obtained using Bayesian analysis as implemented in MrBayes.
1,000,000 generations were used to build the consensus trees. Only confidence values below 85 are shown. Blue Operational
Taxonomic Units (OTUs) indicate Gram-negative Bacteria; red OTUs, Gram-positive Bacteria; black OTUs, Eukaryotes. Blue
branches indicate Gamma-proteobacteria; red branches, Firmicutes; Black branches; Eukaryotes.

gested that these groups, both inhabitants of the aquatic
environment, may form some of the most ancient bacterial lineages (Fig. 4) [58,59]. Within the 16S rRNA tree the
Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia lineages are not
related (Fig. 4). The NanA from the Vibrio/Yersinia lineage
branches close to the Verrucomicrobia/Planctomycetes
lineage and the eukaryote lineage (Fig. 4). A single species
from the Verrucomicrobia also branches within the Vibrio/
Yersinia clade. The data suggests horizontal transfer
between eukaryotes and bacteria; however, the possible
direction of transfer cannot be determined as the prokaryotes and eukaryotes form separate distinct clades (Fig. 4).
We speculate that human pathogens such as V. cholerae, V.
vulnificus, Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica may have acquired
nanA from a commensal species in the human gut. An
alternative evolutionary scenario for this branching pattern may be convergent evolution of NanA, for instance,
in order to recognize the same variant of sialic acid, which
in the case of the bacterial pathogens within lineage IV
would allow them to utilize the sialic acid found in the
mucus of their host.

Phylogenetic analysis of NanK and NanE
Unlike the NanA phylogeny where Gram-negative and
Gram-positive species clustered together, the phylogenetic
trees of both NanK and NanE did not demonstrate clear
cases of horizontal transfer between the two groups (Fig.
5a and 5b). The NanE and NanK protein sequences from
the Gamma-Proteobacteria branch separately from NanE
and NanK from the Firmicutes. In both trees, F. nucleatum
clusters firmly within the Firmicutes lineage (Fig. 5a and
5b). For the NanK tree we used the same outgroups as for
the NanA tree, however, NanE is only present in bacteria.
It is interesting to note that NanK from T. vaginalis does
not cluster with the other eukaryotic representatives,
which form a tight and closely related group, unrelated to
any member of the bacterial kingdom.

Although in the NanE and NanK trees, Gamma-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are grouped on separate lineages,
similar to the 16S rRNA tree, within each lineage significant differences are found (Fig. 5). Strikingly, P. profundum, V. fischeri, and Psychromonas branch with members
of the family Pasteurellaceae in both the NanK and NanE
trees (Fig. 5a and 5b). V. vulnificus and V. cholerae are both

closely related to each other in both trees but form a divergent lineage from the other members of the Vibrionaceae
and Gamma-Proteobacteria strengthening the possibility
of an independent evolutionary origin.
Within the Firmicutes lineages for the NanK protein there
is significantly more diversity in the branching patterns
than in the NanE tree (Fig. 5b). For both the NanE and
NanK trees, the Staphylococci group branch with members of the genus Lactobacillus. The three members of Mycoplasma in the NanK tree form a divergent branch from
other Firmicutes, similar to F. nucleatum and C. botulinum.
NanK from Streptococcus species branch with D. formicigenerans, D. longicatena, and R. gnavus, similar to the NanA
tree. The NanE and NanK proteins from the two species of
the genus Clostridium are located on different branches in
both trees (Fig. 5a and 5b).
Even though the general topologies of both the NanK and
NanE trees resemble more closely the topology of the16S
rRNA than that of NanA, there were many incongruencies
found within the main lineages of the trees (Fig. 3, 4 and
5). These differences might be due to stochastic reasons,
such as different rates of mutation between the two genes,
or horizontal transfer events post speciation, which is suggested by the differences in the gene order of the clusters
(Fig. 2). Within the majority of the Firmicutes nanK and
nanE genes were not coupled together, whereas in
Gamma-Proteobacteria the nanK and nanE genes were
always coupled (one exception was noted within Yersinia). The coupling of the genes is likely reflected in the
higher congruency between the topology for the GammaProteobacteria for both NanE and NanK. The evolutionary scenario emerging from the analysis of the phylogenetic trees is a mosaic evolution of the Nan cluster, due to,
among other possible reasons, horizontal transfer and
reshuffling, as suggested by the variability in gene order.
Utilization of sialic acid as a sole carbon source
In order to verify whether the species predicted to encode
the Nan cluster have the capability to survive using sialic
acid as a sole carbon source, we performed in vitro assays
studying the growth of some pathogenic and commensal
bacteria on minimal media supplemented with sialic acid
(M9+sialic acid) (Fig. 6). Previous studies have shown
that some bacteria, such as C. perfringens, B. fragilis, E. coli
K12, P. multocida, and H. influenzae can utilize sialic acid
as a carbon source [15,22,23,27,29,60]. We examined
growth of V. cholerae N16961, V. vulnificus YJO16, V.
fischeri H905, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium INSP85, Y.
enterocolitica ATCC 27729, E. coli K12 (positive control)
and V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 (negative control)
on M9+sialic acid as a sole carbon source (Fig. 6). As
expected all isolates grew with the exception of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633, which does not contain the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/118

Nan region or NanA (Fig. 6). We also studied the growth
of Y. pestis KIM D27 for 48 hours on M9 minimal media
supplemented with amino acids, N-minimal media, and
MOPS minimal media. Slight growth occurred only in
MOPS minimal media when supplemented with sialic
acid or D-glucose, with both substrates showing similar
growth patterns (data not shown). It is worth noting that
Y. pestis has a very slow growth rate and is an auxotroph
for many nutrients. Overall our findings indicate that
three major groups of pathogenic bacteria, Salmonella,
Vibrio and Yersinia, can utilize sialic acid as a sole carbon
and energy source, a nutrient widespread in the mucous
surfaces colonized by these organisms, increasing their fitness in their host's environment.

Conclusion
Sialobiology is a an emerging field in cellular microbiology, which is beginning to uncover the significant role of
sialic acid metabolism in bacterial interactions with the
human host both as commensals and pathogens. In this
work, we studied the distribution, gene order, and molecular evolution of the cluster involved in sialic acid degradation (nanA, nanE, and nanK) among bacteria. We show
for the first time that the Nan cluster is limited to pathogenic and commensal bacteria, encompassing a limited
number of Gamma-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. We
demonstrated that NanA, the first enzyme in the catabolic
pathway, has a distinct evolutionary history from NanE
and NanK, with multiple instances of horizontal gene
transfer found. The Nan cluster shows mosaic evolution
with incongruencies in its phylogeny and diversity in its
structure. For the first time, we confirm the predicted ability to utilize sialic acid as a carbon source in several bacterial pathogens encompassing three major groups
Salmonella, Vibrio and Yersinia, which can provide them
with a selective advantage in heavily sialylated environments such as the human gut.
