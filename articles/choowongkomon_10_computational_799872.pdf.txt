Abstract
Background: Plasmodium falciparum readily develops resistance to the anti-folates pyrimethamine and proguanil
via a characteristic set of mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (PfDHFR) gene that leads to reduced
competitive drug binding at the enzyme’s active site. Analogous mutations can be found in the DHFR gene in
isolates of Plasmodium vivax (PvDHFR) although anti-folates have not been widely used for the treatment of this
infection. Here the interactions between DHFR inhibitors and modelled structures of the DHFR enzymes of
Plasmodium malariae (PmDHFR) and Plasmodium ovale (PoDHFR) are described, along with an investigation of the
effect of recently reported mutations within PmDHFR.
Methods: DHFR models for PmDHFR and PoDHFR were constructed using the solved PfDHFR-TS and PvDHFR
structures respectively as templates. The modelled structures were docked with three DHFR inhibitors as ligands
and more detailed interactions were explored via simulation of molecular dynamics.
Results: Highly accurate models were obtained containing sets of residues that mediate ligand binding which are
highly comparable to those mediating binding in known crystal structures. Within this set, there were differences
in the relative contribution of individual residues to inhibitor binding. Modelling of PmDHFR mutant sequences
revealed that PmDHFR I170M was associated with a significant reduction in binding energy to all DHFR inhibitors
studied, while the other predicted resistance mutations had lesser or no effects on ligand binding.
Conclusions: Binding of DHFR inhibitors to the active sites of all four Plasmodium enzymes is broadly similar,
being determined by an analogous set of seven residues. PmDHFR mutations found in field isolates influenced
inhibitor interactions to a varying extent. In the case of the isolated I170M mutation, the loss of interaction with
pyrimethamine suggests that DHFR-inhibitor interactions in P. malariae are different to those seen for DHFRs from
P. falciparum and P. vivax.

Background
Resistance to anti-malarials is a major cause of morbidity
and mortality in tropical countries. Resistance has complicated the treatment of malaria and threatened the control
and elimination of the disease. The antifols, a group of
drugs that competitively inhibit the folate pathway enzyme
dihydrofolate reductase DHFR, and thereby disrupt parasite nucleotide metabolism (Figure 1), were developed in
the years following the Second World War. First proguanil
(chloroguanide) and then pyrimethamine were deployed
extensively, as individual and mass treatments, and as

chemoprophylaxis in mass treatment. Resistance developed in both Asia and Africa within a few years of introduction. Combinations with sulphonamides such as
sulphadoxine or sulphalene, and sulphones (dapsone) targeting dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and synergizing
with DHFR inhibition, as well as other classes of drug (e.g.
artemisinin derivatives) have retained useful clinical efficacy to varying extents and these drugs remain important
treatments in some areas of the world.
Molecular analysis of resistant and sensitive parasite isolates has revealed a characteristic series of mutations in
PfDHFR associated with resistance to pyrimethamine and
cycloguanil (the active metabolite of proguanil), the two
most widely used antifol anti-malarials [1]. These mutations (at residues 16, 50, 51, 59, 108 and 164) have clearly

arisen in a particular order, with the primary mutation
being S108N in most geographical regions. Molecular and
in vitro data from field isolates have been supplemented
by heterologous expression studies [2] and the causality of
the relationship between genotype and phenotype proven
via transfection experiments [3].
Although Plasmodium vivax infections are not generally treated with anti-folate therapy, incorrect (i.e. ‘clinical’) diagnosis and the high frequency of undetected
coinfections [4] has inevitably exposed a large number of
P. vivax parasites to anti-folates, potentially promoting
the development of resistance. Anti-folates are efficacious
in clearing erythrocytic-stages of P. vivax - this was evident in the initial evaluations of proguanil in peninsular
Malaya - and subsequent studies confirm efficacy against
parasites which are wild-type at the DHFR locus [5]. In
areas where anti-folates are used to treat Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and
dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) mutations have
emerged at positions known or predicted to mediate
binding of pyrimethamine/cycloguanil [6] and sulphadoxine respectively [7]. PvDHFR displays an array of mutations associated with resistance (at residues 13, 57, 58,
61, 117 and 173) that closely resemble those seen in
PfDHFR both in their ordered appearance and in their
relative location within the primary amino acid sequence
[8]. Heterologous expression studies [9] have shed light
on the role of these mutations in mediating resistance.
Like P. vivax infections, malaria caused by the two
other species which commonly infect humans (Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale) is also not conventionally treated with anti-folates. Nevertheless,
selection of several PmDHFR mutations corresponding
to resistance mutations seen in PfDHFR and PvDHFR
has clearly occurred [10]. There is so far no evidence of
such mutations in the recently isolated sequence for
PoDHFR (Accession no: EU 266601).
The availability of crystal structures for DHFR with (P.
falciparum [11]) or without (P. vivax [6]) the thymidylate synthase (TS) component of the bifunctional
DHFR-TS enzyme, complexed with inhibitors as well as
the cofactor NADPH, has shed light on the precise
interactions between DHFR inhibitors and each protein
in both wild-type and certain mutant states. These two

species’ DHFR proteins possess highly analogous sets of
amino acid residues that interact with inhibitors via a
series of non-covalent bonds. Comparative study of
wild-type and mutant crystal structures has revealed
that mutations reduce inhibitor binding either via the
loss of critical hydrogen bonds or by altering steric
interactions at or near the active site. In addition certain
mutations are hypothesized to compensate for existing
ones by influencing the catalytic or substrate binding
properties of the enzyme. In medicinal terms these studies show the relative vulnerability of the inflexible pyrimethamine structure to mutations at or near the
substrate binding site in DHFR molecules of both Plasmodium species, compared to other compounds with
greater flexibility that retain activity despite such mutations (e.g. WR99210).
This report describes homology-based modelling of
the recently obtained PmDHFR and PoDHFR sequences,
using the solved crystal structures of PfDHFR (1J31) and
PvDHFR (2BL9) respectively as templates. All four wildtype enzymes appear susceptible to pyrimethamine. The
effect of three isolated mutations within the modelled P.
malariae structure was also investigated. These studies
provide insights into the binding interactions between
pyrimethamine and the DHFR proteins of these two
common Plasmodium infections of humans.

Methods
Homology modelling

Wild-type P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR structures
(PDB entries 1J3I and 2BL9) were chosen as templates for
modelling according to identity scores from standard pairwise alignments; if identity scores were not significantly
different similarity scores were used. Models were made
via the SWISS-MODEL web site [12]. The Swiss-Model
server constructs the coordinates of large gaps (insertions
and deletions) in the target-template alignment by using a
de novo loop modelling technique. Accuracy of each
model was determined by the root mean square error for
the main chain atoms. The stereochemical quality of the
PmDHFR and PoDHFR models was evaluated by the
PROCHECK programme using Ramachandran plots [13].
After the models were established, three mutant versions
of PmDHFR were also modelled.

Molecular docking

The drug ligands pyrimethamine, cycloguanil and trimethoprim were drawn in 2D structure and transformed
into 3D structure prior to geometric optimization via the
SYBYL® 7.3 program (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO,
USA). These ligands were docked to the PmDHFR and
PoDHFR models using AutoDock 3.0.5 [14] with rotational bonds for ligands set to be flexible and rotational
bonds for the DHFR receptors set to be rigid. All hydrogen
atoms and Kollman charges were added into the protein.
In brief the steps involved are entry of the files for the
modelled protein and ligands into the programme, location of the active site of individual selected ligand, and
then allocation of a grid box of 70 × 60 × 60Å (x, y and z,
respectively) for the docking region. Docking tasks were
then conducted by a genetic algorithm run 50 times for
each pair of protein-ligands. The population size was set
at 150. The rate of gene mutation and crossover were set
at 0.02 and 0.8, respectively. Finally, the most favourable
pose was determined from the docking results using scoring functions from AutoDock as well as the FRED program (OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc., Santa Fe, NM,
USA.). The poses of ligands with highest scoring functions
were visualized by Swiss-Pdb Viewer 4.0.1 [15,16]. A cutoff of 6Å was used to determine significant intermolecular
interactions.
Molecular dynamics simulation

To investigate more detailed interaction between proteins
and inhibitors, the best docking models for ligands with
PmDHFR and PoDHFR were determined by molecular
dynamic stimulation (MD) using the Simulation package
in Discovery Studio 2.1 (Accelrys Inc., CA) with
CHARMm force field. Briefly, the complex was solvated in
a 20Å explicit TIP3P water spherical boundary with harmonic restraint using an inhibitor as a centre of mass, and
subsequently energy-minimized by the steepest descent
and conjugate gradient methods until the system reached
0.001 kcal/mol•Å convergence. The system was then subjected to a 5 ps heating step from 0 to 300 K, a 150 ps
equilibration step at 300 K, and finally 150 ps of full MD
production at 300 K with NPT ensemble. All simulation
steps were run with a time step of 1 fs and coordinates
were recorded every 100 fs. The full MD trajectory was
considered for analysis. Interaction energy of inhibitors
with each individual residue in the binding site was estimated on the Simulation package.

Results
Sequence analysis showed that the four malarial DHFR
proteins share high degrees of similarity and identity
(Table 1). The alignments used to build models were
the specific pairings PfDHFR and PmDHFR (69.9% identity and 83.1% similarity) while for the pair PvDHFR and

Page 3 of 10

PoDHFR there was 67.4% identity and 79.1% similarity.
These pairings are also consistent with phylogenetic
analyses based on other sequences [17,18]. Most amino
acids in the core structures of all proteins were highly
conserved (Figure 2); at the pyrimethamine binding sites
(based on P. vivax crystal structure), amino acids are
identical among all Plasmodium DHFRs. The only two
regions that differ among the proteins are the loop
inserts after the bA and aI2 domains; neither loop was
included in the PvDHFR and PfDHFR crystal structures
due to the structural flexibility of these regions.
Overall folding of the homology modelled PmDHFR
and PoDHFR structures was similar to that of the crystal
structures of PfDHFR and PvDHFR (Figure 3). Root
mean square (RMS) deviations of backbone atoms
(excluding the missing loop regions) between modelled
DHFRs and template structures were significantly low at
0.15Å (PoDHFR vs. PvDHFR) and 0.73Å (PmDHFR vs.
PfDHFR), indicating models of high accuracy consistent
with the percentage identity of the templates. Ramachandran plot analysis for the PmDHFR model revealed
88.0% of residues were in core (favoured) regions, 11.1%
in allowed regions, 0.9% in generously allowed regions
and 0.0% in disallowed regions. For PoDHFR the figures
were 86% in favoured regions, 11.6% in allowed regions,
1.9% in generously allowed regions and 0.5% in disallowed regions (see Additional File 1). These data indicate satisfactory stereochemical quality.
In order to investigate the binding of pyrimethamine to
the modelled PmDHFR and PoDHFR structures, molecular docking simulations were performed using the
Autodock 3.0.5 program using the known co-crystal
complex of P. vivax DHFR bound to pyrimethamine
(2BL9.pdb) [6] as calibrator to validate docking parameters. Computationally derived protein/inhibitor complexes of both PmDHFR and PoDHFR were achieved
based on the highest docking energy and closest RMS
deviations from the known co-crystal complex; this
highest docking energy conformation overlaid very well
with the experimental co-crystal complex (RMS deviation 0.76). In the case of cycloguanil and trimethoprim,
although there is no co-crystal structure with inhibitor,
their similarity in core structure to pyrimethamine can
be used to select the computational complexes from the
docking results. Docking conformations of ligands
occurred at the same site for all three ligands (Figure 4).

Furthermore, an identical set of seven amino acids was
seen to mediate inhibitor binding in every case. Hydrogen bonds were shown to be present between several
residues and the inhibitor structure.
These docking results showed that each inhibitor
bound to both PmDHFR and PoDHFR in a similar
orientation and binding energy to that seen for Pf and
PvDHFR model sequence templates. Docking scoring
functions for the four species’ DHFR were distributed
closely from -10.50 to -11.04 kcal/mol in the case of
pyrimethamine and from -10.54 to -10.88, in the case of
cycloguanil (Table 2). Experimental determinations of
inhibition constants (Ki) of P. vivax and P. falciparum
against pyrimethamine and cycloguanil were also within
a narrow range [19,20]. The docking energy of trimethoprim to DHFR showed greater variability among the
four different species.
The interaction energy of DHFR inhibitors with individual amino acids in the active side of each DHFR was
calculated by the Discovery Studio programme. Residues
Ile14/13/13/13 (Pf/Pm/Pv/Po residue number), Leu46/
45/45/45, Asp54/53/53/53, Phe58/57/57/57, Ser111/117/
120/116, Ile164/170/173/169, and Thr185/191/194/190
were seen to have significant interactions with all three
inhibitors important for binding (see Additional File 2).
Although all seven residues were found in the binding
site, detailed individual interactions for the seven residues with each inhibitor showed distinct properties
across DHFRs. For example the Ser111/117/120/116pyrimethamine interaction appeared strongest for
PmDHFR, intermediate for PfDHFR and weak for
PvDHFR. This interaction is thought to involve a hydrogen bond between the serine residue and the phenyl
chloride of pyrimethamine. In contrast, the Phe58/57/
57/57 interaction (thought to be primarily steric in nature) and the Thr185/191/194/190-pyrimethamine interaction appeared relatively weak for PmDHFR compared
to that seen in the two known structures PfDHFR and
PvDHFR. For PmDHFR, residues Ile13, Leu45, Asp53,

Mutant P. malariae

Results are based on the Autodock 3.0.5 program; values are kcal/mol. For
PmDHFR mutants, relative binding energies (ΔΔG) are shown in brackets
(reduction in binding produces a positive ΔΔG and enhanced binding
produces a negative ΔΔG).

Ser117 and I170 appear to play important roles in binding with pyrimethamine.
Sequencing of P. malariae isolates has revealed the
presence of three isolated mutations in PmDHFR that
correlate with those seen in PfDHFR and/or PvDHFR
[10]. PmDHFR S114N/G corresponds to S108N and
S117N/T in PfDHFR and PvDHFR respectively, mutations, which appear first in field isolates of these species.
PmDHFR I170M corresponds to I164L and I173L in
PfDHFR and PvDHFR respectively. PfDHFR I164L is
associated with high-level resistance to pyrimethamine
in P. falciparum, but is rarely observed in isolation in
this species. PmDHFR N50K corresponds to N51I in
PfDHFR but has no known equivalent in PvDHFR.
Modelling of these three single mutant proteins revealed
an arrangement of side-chains within the ligand-binding
site that was comparable to wild-type (Figure 5), except
in the case of I170M where the new methionine sidechain caused steric hindrance thereby interfering with
inhibitor binding (Figure 6). Calculation of docking
energies for the three inhibitors with each mutant
revealed that I170M showed significantly reduced docking energy compared to wild-type PmDHFR for all inhibitors with ΔΔG 1.98 kcal/mol for pyrimethamine, 2.77
kcal/mol for cycloguanil and 1.10 kcal/mol for trimethoprim (Table 2). The other mutations had milder effects.
PmDHFR S114N appeared to bind cycloguanil less well
than wild-type, but pyrimethamine slightly more
strongly. N50K appeared to have the least effect of all
on inhibitor binding of the three mutations studied.

Discussion
The emergence of resistance to an anti-malarial drug in
a parasite population via a mutation at a specific locus
depends on several forces including the fitness advantage that the mutation provides when the parasite
encounters drug, and the fitness disadvantage that the
mutation confers with regard to normal enzymatic functions. For example, in the case of P. falciparum DHFR,
mutation S108N has emerged independently on many
separate occasions, providing a reduction in pyrimethamine binding to PfDHFR by approximately 10-fold without major adverse effects on the enzymatic properties of
PfDHFR [21,22] Conversely, the PfDHFR I164L mutation, the allele most associated with highest levels of
pyrimethamine resistance, has appeared in a much more
restricted manner, and almost exclusively on a background of several other mutations (including S108N).
For the non-falciparum human malaria species, particularly P. malariae and P. ovale, these events are much
less clear. Despite the fact that patients with these infections are not routinely treated with anti-folates such as
pyrimethamine, sequencing of PmDHFR field isolates
has shown three mutations, each occurring in isolation,

in analogous positions to those seen in PfDHFR and
PvDHFR. The suggestion that anti-folates do exert pressure on P. malariae and P. ovale is supported by the
modelling data, which indicate that the binding mode of
pyrimethamine, cycloguanil and trimethoprim to all four
DHFRs is similar in several respects. The three inhibitors bound to the protein in the same orientation, overall affinity was comparable across species (and ligands),
and an identical set of seven residues was present at the

pyrimethamine binding site. However, within this overall
framework, it was possible to discern differing contributions of individual residues to the binding of ligands
across species, in the same manner as noted for the two
solved crystal structures of PfDHFR and PvDHFR [6].
The interactions between PmDHFR and anti-folates
were explored by modelling the effect of the three putative drug resistance mutations that have been observed
in the field for PmDHFR. PmDHFR I170M was

Choowongkomon et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:65
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/65

associated with substantial losses in docking energy for
all three DHFR inhibitors with evidence of steric hindrance by the methionine side chain. It is interesting to
note that the homologous replacement is rarely found in
isolation in nature for either P. falciparum or P. vivax.
This is likely to reflect the relative enzymatic activity
and susbstrate affinity of each mutant protein in isolation. For example, PfDHFR I164L possesses grossly
reduced enzymatic activity compared to wild-type
PfDHFR when expressed in E. coli [23]. This suggests
that there are differences between species in terms of
the ability of the DHFR enzyme to tolerate mutation at
this position; presumably PmDHFR is more tolerant in
this regard. Further studies involving heterologous
expression of the PmDHFR mutants studied here would
be useful in addressing this issue.
The other positions where mutations have been
encountered in PmDHFR do not coincide with residues
predicted to mediate inhibitor binding by this protein,
as seen in the PfDHFR and PvDHFR crystal structures
[6]. These mutations act more indirectly on the structure of the binding site; in the case of PvDHFR the
S117N mutation causes the subsequent series of residues (118-125) to change orientation with consequent
loss of the hydrogen bond between S120, three residues
beyond the mutation, and pyrimethamine [6]; PfDHFR
S108N shows less displacement of pyrimethamine in the
active site than is the case for P. vivax S117N [24]. In
the model of wild-type PmDHFR, we noted that the
electrostatic interaction between pyrimethamine and
S117 (three residues beyond the S114N mutation) was
stronger than for equivalent residues in Pf and PvDHFR;
hence binding may be more resistant to the indirect
effect of mutation at S114 than the PfDHFR and
PvDHFR cases.
Although the effects were small, PmDHFR S114N
resulted in weaker cycloguanil and stronger pyrimethamine binding compared to wild-type enzyme. This
somewhat surprising finding may reflect that proguanil
(the prodrug of cycloguanil) may have contributed
much of the anti-folate selection in Southeast Asia.
Ligand-specific alterations in affinity have previously
been reported for PfDHFR [25,26]. PmDHFR N50K
appeared to have minimal effect on inhibitor interactions. Accurate prediction of these more indirect effects
on ligand binding within a molecular model is technically more challenging than for direct effects such as
that seen with I170M.
An additional factor that needs to be taken into
account when linking field mutations to molecular studies is the contribution of each target enzyme to the
pathway under consideration. The finding that an earlier
enzyme in the P. falciparum folate pathway (GCH1) is
amplified in association with PfDHFR mutations known

Page 9 of 10

to be directly involved in resistance to DHFR inhibitors
illustrates this concept [27]. Quantitative differences in
the control of these pathways are also likely to influence
the order in which resistance mutations appear in the
DHFR enzymes of various species.

Conclusions
Molecular modelling of the DHFR enzymes of P. malariae and P. ovale using solved crystal structures as templates led to highly accurate models and confirmed the
preservation of enzyme architecture across species. Residues mediating binding to DHFR inhibitors including
pyrimethamine corresponded to equivalent residues for
P. falciparum and P. vivax. In the case of P. malariae,
introduction of the single I170M mutation observed in
field isolates led to loss of predicted docking energy
with all 3 DHFR inhibitors; however other mutations
had smaller effects. The interaction between PmDHFR
and inhibitors appears to possess distinct properties
compared to empirically determined interactions
between inhibitors and DHFRs of P. falciparum and P.
vivax.
