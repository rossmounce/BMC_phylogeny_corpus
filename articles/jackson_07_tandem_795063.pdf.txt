Abstract
Background: The genome sequence of the protistan parasite Trypanosoma brucei contains many
tandem gene arrays. Gene duplicates are created through tandem duplication and are expressed
through polycistronic transcription, suggesting that the primary purpose of long, tandem arrays is
to increase gene dosage in an environment where individual gene promoters are absent. This
report presents the first account of the tandem gene arrays in the T. brucei genome, employing
several related genome sequences to establish how variation is created and removed.
Results: A systematic survey of tandem gene arrays showed that substantial sequence variation
existed across the genome; variation from different regions of an array often produced inconsistent
phylogenetic affinities. Phylogenetic relationships of gene duplicates were consistent with
concerted evolution being a widespread homogenising force. However, tandem duplicates were
not usually identical; therefore, any homogenising effect was coincident with divergence among
duplicates. Allelic gene conversion was detected using various criteria and was apparently able to
both remove and introduce sequence variation. Tandem arrays containing structural heterogeneity
demonstrated how sequence homogenisation and differentiation can occur within a single locus.
Conclusion: The use of multiple genome sequences in a comparative analysis of tandem gene
arrays identified substantial sequence variation among gene duplicates. The distribution of sequence
variation is determined by a dynamic balance of conservative and innovative evolutionary forces.
Gene trees from various species showed that intraspecific duplicates evolve in concert, perhaps
through frequent gene conversion, although this does not prevent sequence divergence, especially
where structural heterogeneity physically separates a duplicate from its neighbours. In describing
dynamics of sequence variation that have consequences beyond gene dosage, this survey provides
a basis for uncovering the hidden functionality within tandem gene arrays in trypanosomatids.

Background
Evolutionary biology has begun to utilise the abundance
of genome sequence data, applying a comparative
approach to the evolutionary dynamics of genome structure and sequence [1-3]. Within this approach genomic
position is a novel source of contextual information, and

an additional criterion for assessing homology, independent of gene sequences. The debate has recently concentrated on the relative contributions of evolutionary
processes affecting sequence divergence, such as gene conversion, positive and negative selection and concerted
evolution, and processes affecting gene quantity and order

[4,5]. This study concerns the evolution of tandem gene
arrays in the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the
cause of sleeping sickness in humans and various diseases
in animals, for which a genome sequence was recently
completed [6]. A comparative method, using genome
sequence from multiple trypanosomatid species, was
applied to tandem-duplicated genes throughout the T.
brucei genome to test for various evolutionary forces. The
results reveal the variety of dynamics among tandem
arrays and clarify the contribution of concerted evolution
and gene conversion in regulating sequence diversity
among repetitive genes.
Long before the appearance of genome sequences, tandem gene arrays were known to affect genome structure
and gene function. Ribosomal rDNA is commonly tandemly-duplicated across the taxonomic spectrum, and is
typically thought to be homogenised as a result [7]. In
contrast, metazoan hox genes are also tandemly arrayed,
but contain substantial variation that demonstrates the
functional consequences of the array organisation [8].
Tandem arrays are thought to evolve through a process of
replication slippage during DNA synthesis or unequal
crossing over during meiosis [9], a phenomenon conceptually consistent with the rapid evolution of mini-satellites and other highly repetitive regions in many genomes
through mis-alignment [10]. These processes often result
in contiguous gene copies evolving in concert toward a
consensus sequence, such that duplicate sequences within
tandem arrays may fail to diverge as expected under a neutral model [9]. In these circumstances gene duplicates
within a species look more alike than orthologous loci in
different species, which is indicative of concerted evolution [11]. Concerted evolution of duplicated genes was
first recognised among the rDNA of Xenopus [12] and subsequently shown to be widespread among the globins of
primates [13,14] and heat-shock proteins in Drosophila
[15]. Furthermore, unequal crossing-over (UCO) and
gene conversion (GC) were suggested as mechanisms for
this homogenisation within arrays, although their relative
contributions were unknown [16], and remain so.
UCO results from mis-alignment of repetitive DNA and
occurs between sister chromatids during mitosis and
between homologous chromosomes during meiosis [9]; it
principally affects gene numbers and can cause both the
addition and subtraction of repeat units, as shown in
Additional file 1. Consequently, tandem arrays affected by
UCO can show intraspecific copy number variation; but
while copy number can vary, gene sequences are relatively
invariant because UCO adds or subtracts whole repeat
units. UCO was implicated in the formal description of
concerted evolution among tandem α-globins in primates
[18] and is also known to occur in trans, for example,
among the five unlinked rDNA loci in humans [19]. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/54

removal of variation by UCO was demonstrated in Streptococci where the functional polymorphism of rDNA tandem copies, which facilitates antibiotic resistance, was
abolished when diversifying selection was removed from
the bacteria [17].
GC describes the reciprocal or directed exchange of material between alleles on homologous chromosomes or
between gene duplicates; these may be at the same locus
(allelic gene conversion, AGC) or at different loci (ectopic
gene conversion, EGC). Reciprocal exchange between alleles on homologous chromosomes is commonly understood as 'recombination', while non-reciprocal exchanges
within or between loci are termed 'biased gene conversion'. These processes are also illustrated in Additional file
1. This study primarily concerns exchanges among gene
duplicates, within or between loci, regardless of their reciprocity (although most are biased events). First observed
in fungi as a mechanism for homogenisation of alleles
[20], GC can homogenise sequences, for instance among
mammalian [21] and nematode [22] heat-shock proteins,
but also promote polymorphism, for example, in the
diversification of both immunoglobulin [23,24] and
multi-histocompatibility complex alleles [25,26].
Detecting the action of concerted evolution is essentially
about identifying similarities where none are expected;
previously, concerted evolution has been identified by eye
from obvious, anomalous similarities [27-30]. Genomic
position is central to showing that a lack of divergence was
not caused by purifying selection or recent gene duplications. The contextual information provided by genome
sequences show that, first, there is a substantial excess of
mutations between duplicates in different species, compared to duplicates in the same genome, and second,
because gene duplicates display conserved synteny with
surrounding loci, they were established long ago. Quantitative methods for the treatment of GC and UCO have
been developed in the last three decades (for a review see
[31]) and were applied in this study under four criteria:
• Cladistic criterion: homologous genes from several organisms are arranged in a phylogenetic tree to estimate their
cladistic relationships; concerted evolution is inferred
where homologous genes cluster by species, rather than
by locus, i.e., paralogs appear more similar than expected
given that their closest relatives are found in other
genomes.
• Phylogenetic criterion: a 'sliding window' analysis [32,33]
is applied to a multiple alignment of homologous genes,
with phylogenetic trees estimated for each window. A significant departure in phylogenetic signal between windows identifies two regions with different evolutionary
histories, i.e., a recombination 'breakpoint'.

• Distribution criterion [34]: the distribution of silent polymorphisms along a sequence alignment is scored for areas
where the distribution is 'condensed', i.e., matches
between two otherwise discordant sequences. Where the
length of a corresponding region is significantly larger
than expected after permutation, a gene conversion event
is inferred.
• Compatibility criterion [35]: two homologous genes are
compared on a site-by-site basis, breakpoints are inferred
where neighbouring, informative sites have incompatible
phylogenetic signals.
The importance of concerted evolution has been demonstrated through whole genome comparisons of gene
duplicates, across diverse taxa [36-39], but in most detail
for yeast [31,40,41]. Most of these studies have compared
duplicated sequences within genomes, but have not provided a comparative context for sequence evolution. In
this study, tandem gene arrays were chosen because they
offer a structural paradigm to infer evolutionary events,
and one peculiar to trypanosomatids since they typically
lack individual gene promoters and transcribe polycistronically [42,43,6]. Therefore, the argument that tandem
duplication serves to increase gene dosage in the absence
of promoters [44] could be assessed. A comparative
approach was also specifically chosen, in which variation
among T. brucei duplicate sequences was analysed in relation to homologous sequences in five other kinetoplastids, ranging in relation from a subspecies (T. b.
gambiense) to another genus (L. major). This provided the
historical perspective necessary to identify the origins and
causes of sequence variation. Hence, the specific aims
were to (i) catalogue all tandem gene arrays in the genome
sequence, establish their phylogenetic distribution in
other trypanosomatid species and quantify the variation
found among the duplicate sequences of each; (ii) assess
the relative contributions of concerted evolution, UCO
and GC, through the application of multiple tests; and
(iii) use this information to characterise the causes of variation (or lack of) in each array.

Results
After surveying the Trypanosoma brucei genome sequence,
47 tandem arrays with at least four gene copies were identified and characterised. This is unlikely to be an exhaustive list of tandem-duplicated loci in the T. brucei genome
since some lengthy tandem arrays may be collapsed to
tandem pairs or triplets if gene number could not be
resolved during genome assembly. A full list of tandemduplicates, regardless of copy number, is available from
the author. Duplicate sequences were combined with
homoeologous sequences (i.e., homologous sequences
occurring at the same genomic position) from five other
trypanosomatid species and several criteria were applied

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/54

to the multiple alignments to identify the molecular signatures of concerted evolution and gene conversion. Each
of the methods scrutinised multiple alignments for unexpected similarity between otherwise dissimilar gene
sequences, which could not be explained through occasional conservation or derivation. The evidence suggested
that tandem arrays display a variety of evolutionary
dynamics and often contain substantial sequence variation; among them examples of conserved arrays, evolving
in copy number through unequal crossing-over, moderately variable duplicates evolving in concert, those
affected by allelic gene conversion, and also structurally
segregated arrays, with different duplicates exposed to distinct evolutionary forces.
Variation within tandem arrays
Values for Dn and Ds in Table 1 show that for many cases
there was substantial variation among the duplicate genes
within tandem arrays. Indeed, in a few cases Ds exceeded
1 (6 cases), probably due to highly divergent copies in
these arrays that showed little or no sequence homology
over part of the alignment. Typically, tandem arrays
showed moderate variation among copies, where Ds
always exceeded Dn, but Dn was non-zero (31 cases). However, a sizable minority showed no variation at all (10
cases).

Turning first to the invariant arrays, these included histones (Tb4, 39, 57, 107), tubulin (Tb3), cysteine peptidase (Tb43), glycerol kinase (Tb89), paraflagellar rod
proteins (Tb18, 73) and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (Tb47). The coding sequences of these arrays were
identical, except for very occasional silent changes. The
non-coding parts were typically identical also, although
there was some variation in copy number of repetitive
tracts, for instance in the 3' UTR of Tb4 (although the ability to precisely determine tract length is limited). Generally, the terminal UTRs of the arrays were identical to
internal IGSs but curtailed; this shortening was assumed
to reflect the proportion of the IGS properly assigned as
UTR.
Among moderately variable cases, variation was typically
continuous among copies and greater in coding regions.
Notable examples of this included Tb93 (BARPs), where
the corrected genetic distance between coding sequences
(CDS) was 0.335 sub/site, while equivalent values for 5'
and 3' UTRs were 0.073 and 0.038 respectively. In other
arrays, such as Tb24 (S-T phosphatase) and Tb62a, the
non-coding regions were invariant, while their associated
CDS showed significant divergence. The only instances to
show the opposite pattern, where non-coding regions
were more variable than CDS were the histone arrays
(Tb4, 39 and 107), albeit because the CDSs were invariant.

# Monophyly of array copies was assessed through non-parametric bootstraps of a ML phylogeny (500 replicates) and posterior probabilities in a Bayesian phylogeny ('na' denotes that monophyly was not recovered by the Bayesian tree). SH tests compared the
likelihood of an optimal topology with 'orthologous' and 'concerted' scenarios; significant p-values are shown in bold and indicate that the scenario concerned was significantly less likely that the optimal topology. The cladistic criterion was only applied to arrays
with widespread distributions.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:54

Where variation existed, the phylogenetic signal among
coding sequences was typically inconsistent with 5' and 3'
UTRs. Additional file 2 shows phylogenetic networks for
three components of Tb55 (retrotransposon hot-spot protein). In frame A, copies 2–4 are robustly divergent from
other duplicates, but this was not repeated with either 5'
or 3' UTRs (frames C and D respectively). Not only are
copies 2–4 dispersed in these latter networks, but
nowhere do the UTRs show the same pattern at CDSs.
Hence, these regions of the repeat unit showed different
histories and evolutionary rates. Similarly, the relationships between Tb61 CDSs, shown in Additional file 3, are
not reflected in the affinity of UTRs, of which there are
three distinct and unrelated types. The exceptions to this
inconsistency were those arrays showing discontinuous
and mixed patterns of variation (see below).
Some tandem arrays containing highly variable duplicates
were idiosyncratic. Figure 1 describes Tb109c, which contained four copies with extensive length differences that
were genuinely divergent from one another. Other arrays
with high average Ds obtained this value due to discontinuous variation, that is, they all included an atypical duplicate that did not represent the patterns shown by other
copies. Instances where divergence was significantly
greater between some duplicates than others are referred
to as having 'mixed dynamics'. Tb24 (see Additional file
4) included a divergent copy at its 3' end that lacked the
C- and N-termini of other repeats. Tb32 (75 kDa invariant
surface glycoprotein) included a divergent copy at its 5'
end that differed from other duplicates through frequent
indels. Tb113 (cation transporter) and Tb82 also possessed divergent copies at their 5' ends. In these cases, the
divergent gene was the exception and other copies varied
continuously. The divergent copies were always accompanied by radically remodelled IGSs, which failed to align
with other non-coding repeats within the array. For
instance, Tb105a is shown in Figure 2; its last copy had a
distinctive C-terminus and both 5' and 3' UTRs bore no
resemblance to others in the array. This often resulted in
obvious structural change within the array, with the divergent copy being physically segregated from the remainder.
Consequently, CDS and IGS relationships usually coincided for these cases.
In summary, duplicate genes within tandem arrays typically contained variation and not all elements of the array
provided an identical phylogenetic signal. Some duplicates were physically segregated from the remaining array
by divergent non-coding sequence; where this had
occurred, these genes diverged substantially and variation
was distributed discontinuously.

Evidence for concerted evolution
A cladistic criterion was applied to each sequence alignment 'C', to infer concerted evolution, i.e., where paralogous sequences within a species looked more alike than
their putative homoeologs in other species. It was trivial
to confirm this for invariant arrays, since all copies were
identical, but the likelihood of concerted evolution was
reinforced by the large genetic distances between
sequences evolving in concert in T. brucei and homologs
in other species. Additional file 5 shows the ML phylogeny
for Tb43 (cysteine peptidase), which is highly conserved
within T. brucei and other species. Conspecific sequences
obviously cluster together, but there is considerable
sequence divergence between clades. In fact, the ratio of
interspecific to intraspecific divergence was consistently
two orders of magnitude greater for these invariant arrays
than more variable cases. Tb43 had a ratio of 217.6, while
values for Tb26 and Tb75, both moderately variable, were
3.22 and 1.81 respectively. For all of the 'invariant' arrays,
the lack of change observed within clades was not
matched by the length of branches relating them; these
genes had diverged, but not while contained within a single genome.

Variable arrays also displayed the phylogenetic signal of
concerted evolution. Almost all cases for which homoeologous arrays existed in other species produced the pattern
of clustering by species. However, this did not extend to T.
brucei and T. brucei gambiense; sequences from these
organisms were usually interspersed. The pattern presented by Tb17 in Figure 3 is representative of the general
trend; high bootstrap values support species-specific
clades and this is confirmed by SH tests, described in
Table 1. A topology in which Tb17 sequences group by
species is not significantly worse than the most optimal
tree (ΔlnL = -10.4, p = 0.448), whereas a topology in
which presumed orthologs (based on position) from different species are forced to cluster together is significantly
less likely (ΔlnL = -3002.3, p < 0.0001). 16 out of 47 cases
failed to reject the concerted evolution scenario and
Tb80a confirmed this to the extent that T. brucei and T. b.
gambiense sequences were reciprocally monophyletic also,
(the only exception to the previous statement). In 14 out
of 47 instances, the cladistic criterion could not be applied
because the array was found only in T. brucei and T. b.
gambiense; for these cases it was not possible to infer concerted evolution.
For the remaining tandem arrays, the SH test either
rejected the concerted evolution scenario in favour of a
pattern of orthology, as for Tb64a; or, as in all other
instances, both scenarios were rejected. The optimal tree
topology for Tb82 sequences was significantly different to
topologies describing concerted evolution and orthology
respectively; this occurred because most copies had their

closest relative in a different species (i.e., still displayed
orthology), while some copies in T. vivax, T. cruzi and L.
major were homogenised or independently derived.
Equally, each copy within Tb106 had its closest relative at
a different unlinked locus; Tb106 was only represented in
T. brucei, T. b. gambiense and T. congolense and there was
no clear indication of the relationships between homoeologous copies. Thus, it is reasonable that this data set
should reflect neither concerted evolution nor orthology.
A concerted evolution scenario was also rejected by five
arrays showing mixed dynamics (Tb24, 64a, 80, 105a,
109c). In these cases the divergent copy retained orthology with homoeologous divergent copies in other organisms (see Figure 1), while the remaining genes in each
array were monophyletic. This was sufficient for concert to
be rejected, and, conversely, for orthology to be accepted
for Tb64a.
In summary, most phylogenies of homologs from various
species (alignment 'C', see methods) showed some evidence of concerted evolution, although many arrays could
not be tested because they were only present in T. brucei.
In those that could, monophyly of conspecific gene duplicates was usually significantly more likely than orthology
with other species. Even in cases where orthology was
retained by certain duplicates, others displayed the signature of concerted evolution.
Evidence for allelic gene conversion
Three different criteria were applied to examine tandem
gene duplicates from T. brucei only for allelic gene conversion (alignment 'B', see methods). The phylogenetic criterion, applied through the PDM and HMM methods in
TOPALi, is illustrated in Figure 3 (Tb17). The distribution
criterion, applied through the GENECONV (GCV)
method in RDP, is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 (Tb109c
and Tb105a). The compatibility criterion, in the form of
RETICULATE, executed in RDP, is illustrated in Figure 4
(Tb62). The consensus of all this information, critically
examined by eye, produced a total of 76 GC events, in 21
arrays. These are recorded by sequence in Additional file 6
(Table S1) and by event in Additional file 7 (Table S2).

Like many arrays, Tb17 displayed variation among its
duplicate sequences but, despite this, the duplicates clustered together when compared to homoeologs in other
species. In addition, Figure 3(A) shows that the pattern of
variation was indicative of a gene conversion event at the
C-terminus. From here onwards, gene copies will be
defined by their position from the 5' end; hence, the third
copy of the Tb17 array is written Tb17.3. It follows from
Figure 3(C) that Tb17.3 and Tb17.4 were closest relatives
overall, an observation supported by the HMM sliding
window analysis in Figure 3(A). For the most part, the
topology uniting Tb17.3 and 4 attained a probability of 1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/54

However, for a 206 bp section of the 3' UTR, the topology
grouping Tb17.3 with Tb17.2 was most likely. Inspection
of the multiple alignment suggested conversion of Tb17.3
by Tb17.5, which was most closely related to Tb17.2. This
event was supported by GCV (p = 4.62e-3) and SISCAN
(SSC) (p = 4.88e-21) methods.
GCV was successful in identifying three regions in the
Tb61 multiple alignment where similarities in the distribution of variation were significant. Additional file 3 (A)
shows the output of an SSC analysis, which was executed
to confirm the GCV results. When only copies 1, 2 and 8
were compared, three distinct breakpoints were visible
from a sliding window analysis that otherwise suggested
Tb61.1 and Tb61.2 were always closest relatives. In the
left-most anomaly, Tb61.2 and Tb61.8 share significant
similarity (p = 2.14e-9), which was due to the conversion
of Tb61.2 by Tb61.4 between 937 and 1042 bp. The other
two regions of significant change refer to instances where
Tb61.1 and Tb61.8 were most similar, due to the conversion of copy 1 by 8 between 1393 and 1477 bp (p = 3.41e5), and the conversion of copy 2 by 5 or 7 between 1648
and 1814 bp (p = 4.25e-12). Additional files 6 and 7 show
that many other events were posited for Tb61, affecting 7/
8 duplicates (although PDM/HMM methods only identified events affecting copies 2 and 3).
Different methods for inferring gene conversion were typically concordant; one illustration of this is shown in Figure 4, in which two significant events affecting Tb62.2, 3
and 4 were identified by both SSC and RETICULATE,
although a third was not detected by the latter. The leftmost peak in Figure 4(A) represents the conversion of
Tb62.4 by Tb62.5, causing Tb62.2 and Tb62.3 to be most
closely related between 120–450 bp (p = 4.74e-10). The
other two events refer to, first, Tb62.3 and Tb62.4 clustering together (blue peak, p = 3.38e-15), due to conversion of
Tb62.2 by Tb62.5, and, second, to Tb62.1 by Tb62.2
being most similar (red peak, p = 3.16e-09), also due to
conversion of Tb62.2. These two events were identified by
the compatibility criterion in panel C, although the precise placement of breakpoints was different.
The majority of putative genetic exchanges were biased,
rather than reciprocal. Of 76 observations, only 7 were
best explained through the equitable exchange of homologous sequence between two sequences (shown in Additional file 7). All other events involved a given sequence
being uncharacteristically similar to unrelated sequences
for a given region, and thereby altering its phylogenetic
position for the length of that region. These events were
interpreted as biased gene conversion.
In many instances, it was possible to delimit the CDS and
UTRs within an array, either because EST data was availa-

ble, or through comparison with the terminal UTRs of the
array. Therefore, it was shown that GC frequently affected
the UTRs. Tb62 had three putative breakpoints, identified
in Figure 4; the event shown at left spanned the start
codon, the second event spanned the stop codon, while
the peak shown at right corresponded to a region exclusively within the 3' UTR. Similarly, of the 10 GC events
identified for Tb93, only three occurred within the coding
sequence while another spanned the stop codon.
Evidence for ectopic gene conversion
The application of GC tests to the 'A' alignments (i.e., tandem gene duplicates from T. brucei plus any other gene
family members) showed that ectopic gene conversion
was very rare among these tandem gene arrays. Only two
gene arrays were implicated in EGC by several methods.
The first instance concerned Tb105a, where there were significant regions of similarity between the third gene copy
and Tb10.70.2860; these loci are separated by 1.17 mb on
chromosome 10. Analysis by SSC identified a region
between 519–628 bp that showed significant identity (p =
9.88e-04), which is indicated by the GCV output in Figure
2(A). These elements of similarity stand out despite
Tb105a.3 otherwise being closely related to the first and
second gene copies in the array, as shown in Figure 2(C).
The second instance of EGC involved Tb32, where the tandem array of 75 KDa invariant surface glycoproteins was
preceded upstream by an additional tandem pair of gene
duplicates, on the opposite strand. Phylogenetic analysis
showed that the tandem pair was most likely to be a segmental duplication of Tb32.3 and Tb32.4. However,
while the pair still bore these resemblances, one copy
showed regions of similarity to Tb32.2. One of these
regions was significant (408–603 bp, p = 1.21e-11). Additionally, the tandem pair seemed to have concerted at the
N-terminus as a significant GC event was identified here
also (136–164 bp, p = 9.61e-04).
Categorisation by evolutionary dynamic and base
composition
The tandem arrays in T. brucei were categorized according
to the evidence presented above, in order to make sense of
the various patterns observed and to test the relationship
between double strand-break repair mechanisms and base
composition (see Additional file 8). Most arrays fell into
one of four categories (see methods for explanation): CEAGC, CE+AGC, AGC and UCO. Exceptions included
Tb105a (Figure 2), which was affected by EGC alone, and
Tb82, which failed the cladistic criterion (i.e., did not
reflect concerted evolution) and retained orthology for all
copies. Five arrays fell into the 'mixed dynamics' category,
where not all duplicates were monophyletic but a proportion had evolved in concert. Having grouped arrays
according to their evolutionary dynamic, the data set was
used to evaluate the theory that gene conversion, through

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/54

double-strand break repair mechanisms, results in G-C
enrichment of genomes. The proportion of G-C at third
codon positions (G-C3) was calculated for each category
and for 100 random, singleton genes from across the
genome. This showed that the average G-C3 for singleton
genes was 0.416, while the value for UCO arrays was
0.676; this was a highly significant elevation in third position G-C content (df = 10, t = -11.89, p = 1.57e-07). A significant elevation was also observed among CE-AGC
arrays, where pG-C3 was 0.454 on average (df = 8, t = 2.511, p = 0.018). However, neither the CE+AGC (G-C3 =
0.426) or AGC (G-C3 = 0.435) categories produced significantly different G-C3 to single genes.

Discussion
Homoeology, the conservation of genomic position, was
crucial to establishing the literal equivalence between loci
in different organisms, given that these gene sequences
were repetitive by nature, and subject to gene conversion
that could generate misleading phylogenies. Using this
comparative approach, different levels of variation among
duplicates were identified among the 47 tandem arrays
studied, reflecting various evolutionary dynamics. Where
gene duplicates were invariant, UCO was suggested as the
mechanism for concerted evolution, but concert was also
widespread among variable tandem arrays. The combination of sequence variation and concerted evolution indicated that these arrays were exposed to GC while still
diverging. Finally, arrays with copies displaying different
patterns in variation were exceptions that proved the rule:
copies within homogeneous repeat structures conformed
to a pattern indicative of concerted evolution, while others physically segregated from the repetitive region
retained orthology with loci in other species.
Patterns of sequence variation indicative of concerted
evolution
For most arrays that could be tested the cladistic criterion
firmly rejected orthology between homoeologous gene
copies in different organisms. For tandem arrays present
only in T. brucei it was not possible to find evidence for
concerted evolution, given that lack of variation itself is
not evidence. If one accepts that where there is conserved
gene order around a homologous array in multiple
genomes, this proves that the loci are orthologous (i.e.,
directly inherited from an ancestor with an equivalent
character), the failure of these orthologs to appear monophyletic in a phylogeny is evidence for the alteration of
conspecific sequences, i.e., concerted evolution within
individual genomes. If one does not accept this as the
cause of the unexpected homogeneity, convergence due to
positive selection or, more plausibly, the removal of substitutions due to strong structural conservation (i.e., purifying selection) are possible alternatives.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:54

It has been suggested that a mixture of recent gene duplication and purifying selection can explain why tandem
gene duplicates appear similar [5]. In this study, purifying
selection is not a sufficient explanation since the gene copies have evolved; including those 'invariant' arrays showing large genetic distances between species. Whatever
small amount of variation exists should still reflect the
orthologous relationships indicated by shared genomic
position. Therefore, purifying selection would only be
adequate if posited after the isolation of a genome, coinciding with the origin of an array by gene duplication de
novo. Rapid gene duplication would then result in homogenous gene copies, clustering by species in a phylogeny.
Yet, many arrays in this study were clearly not exposed to
purifying selection and were evolving neutrally; even
invariant arrays displayed large interspecific genetic distances and so had diverged within each lineage. And it is
implausible that an array present in five different species
was inherited by each as a single gene and was independently expanded five times. It is more parsimonious that
the array present in all species was an array in their ancestor.
Among the 'invariant' tandem arrays, concerted evolution
was the result of unequal crossing-over between homologous chromosomes at meiosis. The absence of any variation within the non-coding parts of the arrays, near-zero
Dn and Ds values in the CDSs and, conversely, substantial
divergence from homologs in other species, suggest that
variation has been purged from these sequences irrespective of codon position, rather than constrained by purifying selection. In other words, while UCO results in
dispersal of polymorphisms among gene duplicates and
thus 'invariant' arrays within individual genomes, divergence between homologs in different genomes continues.
In agreement with previous observations, the G-C3 content is significantly elevated among these arrays, supporting the theory that double-strand break repair
mechanisms cause G-C enrichment [45,46]. In T. brucei,
homogeneity has previously been observed among the
highly-conserved heat-shock proteins [29,47]. These and
other arrays in Trypanosoma spp., such as histones [48,49]
and cysteine protease [50,51], emulate the homogeneity
among important structural or 'housekeeping' genes in
other organisms [9].
The idea that purifying selection could explain concert
among arrays with greater levels of variation is even more
unlikely, given that non-coding regions were once again
often more conserved, and many genes were evolving
neutrally. The coincidence of variation and concerted evolution demands a different mechanism: gene conversion.
These arrays suggest that repeated gene conversion can
cause tandem duplicates to evolve in concert, in the presence of neutral divergence (or even positive selection).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/54

Although no GC was observed in 7 arrays where concerted
evolution was inferred under the cladistic criterion, the
incidence of GC suggests that both homogenising and
diversifying processes operate simultaneously within
these genomic structures. It is not clear which would occur
more frequently, or where the balance of forces would lie;
however, increased divergence would inevitably reduce
the probability of conversion between two sequences and
less conservative regions of a gene may rapidly escape conversion after duplication, allowing unfettered divergence.
In summary, the action of concerted evolution in tandem
arrays is betrayed by the loss of orthology between
homoeologous genes in different organisms, yet this does
not seem to prevent divergence between and within
genomes. These results show that paralogous sequences
can become more similar over time, even in the presence
of divergence, and that such concerted evolution is only
one conservative process affecting duplicate sequences,
which may be simultaneously affected by other conservative or innovative forces.
Allelic gene conversion as a mechanism of sequence
evolution
21 out of 47 tandem arrays contained chimaeric gene copies, which generated putative cases of partial gene conversion. In the majority of cases this gene conversion was
biased and presumably occurred with the effect of propagating one sequence motif at the expense of another. On
a few occasions, recombination between two sequences
was the best explanation for incompatible motifs in an
alignment. The extent of AGC may be difficult to determine since it cannot be known how many exchanges have
been 'overwritten' by subsequent events. And as no distinction was made between homologous chromosomes in
the T. brucei genome sequence, it is not known what proportion of events occurred between alleles during meiosis.
The authenticity of these putative GC events was checked
by collecting voucher sequences from those read libraries
that were available (chromosomes 9, 10 and 11). Of all
GC events originating on these chromosomes, only four
could not be substantiated by single read sequences for
three gene copies containing incompatible motifs (see
Additional file 7). For these cases, the contradiction
between one part of the molecule and another could be
due to the assembly of individual reads from different
copies. However, single reads were retrieved for most
putative events that covered the breakpoint and represented both incompatible motifs, eliminating the possibility of such mis-assembly.

AGC is a plausible mechanism for homogenisation of
many of these tandem arrays. However, in certain circumstances, where sequences diverge rapidly, AGC may have
a further diversifying effect by helping to disperse

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:54

sequence motifs among duplicates. Tb93 and Tb17, both
coding for surface-expressed proteins, may be examples of
where the rate of AGC is outstripped by sequence divergence, preventing a net homogenising effect of GC
(although, by sharing around sequence motifs, array copies would still cluster by species in a phylogeny). Contingency gene systems are a dramatic illustration of the
power of GC to generate allelic diversity through the creation of chimaeric sequences. Contingency genes have
evolved independently in various pathogens and parasites
to provide a rapid solution to immunity raised against an
existing epitope. Typically they comprise a large number
of whole and partial surface antigens, only a fraction of
which are expressed. A novel gene is generated by transposing an inactive motif into an expression locus, replacing the existing sequence, for example, in the generation
of novel pilin in Neisseria [52], translocation of VSG pseudogenes into expression sites in T. brucei [53,54] and similarly in Babesia bovis [55] and the cestode Echinococcus
[56]. These systems employ EGC in the generation of chimaeras; this, and the concerted evolution of conserved
gene families, such as β-tubulin in Leishmania [57], suggested a priori that EGC played a prominent role in the
evolution of gene duplicate sequences across the genome.
However, in contrast to AGC between tandem duplicates
physically associated within an array, exchange between
gene family members in trans, or separated from the array,
was seldom observed. It is reported that conversion frequency is lower between distant and dissimilar gene copies [37,38,58,59], which suggests that gene conversion is
unlikely to affect the sequence homogeneity of gene families in general. Only two arrays, Tb32 and Tb105a, produced a substantiated incidence of EGC, despite initially
promising patterns in Tb12 and Tb26. The latter two demonstrated the difficulty in confirming gene conversion
events; the presence of recently duplicated gene copies
near to the tandem array gave the impression of gene conversion with array copies. However, any similarity
between genes in and out of the array was interpreted as
common inheritance from a duplication event, and any
incompatibilities were introduced subsequently by allelic
gene conversion between newly duplicated copies rather
than through ectopic exchange with the array.
Functional differentiation and the spatial context of
concerted evolution
UCO and GC are recognised mechanisms of concerted
evolution [9]. Both processes occur due to the aberrant
alignment of repetitive sequences in cis or trans. Since
these processes involve the interaction of repetitive
sequences, the frequencies of UCO and GC decline with
physical distance and sequence dissimilarity [60,61],
which is corroborated by the paucity of EGC here. The
limitations on concerted evolution occur because it is an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/54

explicitly spatial phenomenon [62], for instance, it is
largely limited to tandem arrays in T. brucei, and does not
extend to gene families in general. In this study, the structural limitations on concerted evolution are very well
demonstrated by arrays with mixed dynamics. While gene
duplicates in arrays such as Tb109c and Tb24 show physical proximity and sequence homology typical of other
arrays, the repeat structure of the array is disrupted
through extensive divergence in flanking and, sometimes,
coding sequences. In Additional file 4, Tb24.4 and 5 have
evolved unique UTRs and are physically segregated from
Tb24.1-3 by the insertion of two unrelated genes; perhaps
as a consequence, they retained orthology with homoeologs in other species. Similarly, Tb109c.4 (Figure 1) is
physically separated from the array by an unknown CDS
and is shown to retain orthology with homoeologs in T.
cruzi, T. congolense and L. major. And likewise, Tb105a.4
(Figure 2) is segregated from the other, concerted duplicates by its UTRs, which show no affinity with others in
the array, and is more closely related to other genes
around the genome. These cases link the disruption of the
repeat structure, by rearrangements to IGS or CDS boundaries, with divergent gene copies that retain orthology
across species, rather than converging with conspecific
paralogs.
Previous studies have shown that tandem arrays have the
capacity to harbour important functional variation. The
phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) array in T. brucei comprises three distinct sequence types, where the second
copy is a chimaera of the first and third, created through
gene conversion [63,28]; this variation is responsible for
the expression of specific glycosomal and cytoplasmic isoforms [64,65]. In a similar instance, the hexose transporter array in T. brucei reflects the spatial and functional
partition of two different isoforms, each with several identical duplicates, which may again have been affected by
gene conversion between the isoforms [30]. In T. cruzi,
duplicates within the pyr gene array controlling pyrimidine biosynthesis are also functionally distinct and
expressed in particular life-cycle stages [66]. Sequence variation in the 3' UTRs of β-tubulin in trypanosomatids has
been directed related to differential regulation of gene
expression in different life stages [67,68]. Hence, given the
abundance of sequence variation evident here, functional
differentiation of tandem duplicates may be commonplace, suggesting a subtle functionality within tandem
arrays not yet appreciated in T. brucei. The presence of
both gene duplicates evolving in concert and others
retaining orthology in mixed dynamic arrays demonstrates how gene conversion is a spatial phenomenon.
Rearrangements of the primary or secondary structures of
divergent gene copies make them permanently distinct
and reduce the probability of recombination with a
nearby duplicate. This offers a model for how functional

differentiation can be reconciled with the ubiquity of concerted evolution observed here.

Conclusion
Contrary to many previous descriptions from trypanosomatids, tandem gene arrays in T. brucei contain substantial genetic variation among gene duplicates. Despite this,
concerted evolution is pervasive, and evidence from various loci indicates that both unequal-crossing over and
allelic gene conversion contribute to homogenisation.
Therefore, gene duplicates can both evolve in concert, relative to homoeologs in other species, and diverge within
an array. This indicates that multiple evolutionary forces
are apparent, with sequence variation determined by a
balance of conservative and innovative pressures. Structurally heterogeneous tandem arrays demonstrated that
the influence of concerted evolution is mediated by the
spatial environment of gene duplicates; it can be prevented by disruption of the repeat structure in the array.
Functional differentiation of duplicates can and does
occur through such rearrangements in intergenic
sequences. Together, the dynamics of sequence variation
among tandem duplicates show how various forces affecting gene sequences must be integrated with typical 'birthand-death' ideas of gene family evolution, to produce an
adequate model. Abundant variation among gene duplicates indicates that tandem duplication has greater consequence than simply increasing gene dosage; the
systematic account given here provides a basis for uncovering the hidden functionality within tandem gene arrays
in trypanosomatids.

Methods
The primary resource for all analyses was the completed
genome sequence for Trypanosoma brucei [6], which was
available from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's interface 'GeneDB' [69]. When evaluating concerted evolution,
the completed sequences of Trypanosoma cruzi [70] and
Leishmania major [44], and the draft genome sequences for
other trypanosomatids (T. brucei gambiense, T. congolense,
T. vivax), were also utilised through the same interface.
The T. brucei genome consists of 11 chromosomes ranging
between 1 and 5 mb. Each chromosome was scanned by
eye for duplicate genes positioned in tandem; where the
similarity was not obvious from annotation suspected
duplicates were tested by reciprocal BLAST and sequence
alignment. A catalogue of all tandem gene pairs and gene
arrays is available as supplementary material (see Additional file 9).
Since this study concerned the variation among gene copies and the approach taken was inherently phylogenetic,
only those tandem arrays with >3 copies in the annotated
genome sequence were selected for analysis; these
included tandem segmental duplications where the repeat

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/54

units comprised multiple dissimilar, contiguous genes.
The component coding sequences (typically, trypanosomatid genes do not contain introns, although they do
occasionally occur [71]) for each duplicated locus were
then extracted. The protocol for analysis of sequence variation is described in Additional file 8. Essentially, after
preparation of multiple alignments, the variation among
sequences was quantified and characterised using phylogenetic estimation. The cladistic, phylogenetic, distribution
and compatibility criteria described previously were
applied to detect concerted evolution, AGC and EGC in
turn. Each array was then categorised according to the
results of these analyses to examine the relationship
between evolutionary dynamic and base composition.
Data preparation
Duplicate sequences were aligned using the ClustalW tool
[72] for each tandem array, within the BioEdit platform
[73]. Sequences were translated prior to alignment to preserve codon structure and then returned to nucleotide
form for analysis. Each alignment was checked by eye.
Three types of alignment were created:

• A: duplicate sequences from the array were combined
with all other gene family members. Untranscribed
regions (UTRs) were not included because they usually
could not be aligned. These alignments were intended to
test for monophyly of array copies and to test for ectopic
exchange between unlinked loci in the same gene family.
These alignments were not possible in 15/47 cases
because no further loci existed beyond the tandem array.
• B: the coding sequence and UTRs of each copy from the
array were aligned. UTRs were defined using either
expressed sequence tag (EST) data, where this existed, or
on the basis of identity between internal and external
intergenic sequences (IGS). The first and last copies of the
array usually had curtailed (sometimes entirely different)
5' and 3' non-coding regions respectively. The length over
which these regions displayed identity with the internal
IGS was assumed to reflect the UTR. These alignments
were created to estimate variation and phylogeny among
array copies and to evaluate the evidence for allelic gene
conversion.
• C: the coding sequence for each array copy in T. brucei
was combined with homologs from up to five other species, where available. UTRs were not included because
these often do not align over large phylogenetic distances.
Homologs were found by searching each genome
sequence with the gene sequence of surrounding genes in
T. brucei. For a homolog to be accepted, it had to display
'homoeology' with T. brucei, i.e., conservation of surrounding gene order.

Analysis of concerted evolution
Variation among duplicate sequences within arrays was
quantified with the numbers of synonymous (Ds) and
non-synonymous (Dn) substitutions per site, using
DNAsp [74]; these measures were favoured because they
reflect purifying selection, an alternative to UCO in
explaining low divergence. Concerted evolution should
result in a clade of tandem duplicates, excluding
homologs in other species. Hence, the cladistic criterion
was applied by estimating a phylogenetic network for
Alignment C. A network has advantages as an initial analysis because ambiguity in a phylogenetic hypothesis
remains explicit, but it is also realistic where sequences
have mixed histories (as many genes may have among
these data sets). The networks were estimated using the
neighbour-net method, a clustering algorithm executed in
Splitstree v4.0 [75]. To correct for potential base composition bias, a logdet genetic distance matrix was used after
removing parsimony-uninformative sites.

Where all array copies were monophyletic, this was confirmed by estimating maximum likelihood phylogenetic
trees using PHYML [76], with 500 non-parametric bootstraps. The trees were unrooted, a GTR + I + Γ model was
applied and parameters were estimated from the data
[77]. Statistical evaluation of the concerted evolution
hypothesis was obtained using a Shimodaria-Hasegawa
test (SH, [78]), applied to alignment C; the test was executed using DNAml in the PHYLIP 3.65 package [79]. The
SH test compared the most optimal topology without
constraints with two tree topologies in which duplicate
sequences were monophyletic by species (i.e., concerted)
and by position in the array (i.e., retained orthology)
respectively. The 'concerted' and 'orthologous' scenarios
could be rejected where there was a significant departure
in the likelihood between optimal and constrained topologies. Failure to reject the null hypothesis that the constrained topology was sub-optimal showed that any
apparent differences were explicable due to sampling
error.
Analysis of allelic gene conversion
AGC is defined as recombination between gene duplicates
within an array, either between copies on the same chromosome or between homologous chromosomes. Phylogenetic, compatibility and distribution criteria were applied in
detecting AGC events. All putative GC events were
checked by eye and many were rejected when related back
to the multiple alignment.

The phylogenetic criterion detected GC by identifying a
significant difference in tree topology between neighbouring 'windows' in a sliding window analysis. This was conducted using the TOPALi platform [80], with the
probabilistic divergence measure (PDM, [81]) and hidden

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/54

Markov model (HMM, [82]) methods. The PDM method
scans the entire alignment, estimating phylogenies for
fixed sequence windows with a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo process. A significant change in the posterior probabilities of two neighbouring windows is interpreted as a
breakpoint. A step size of 1 and window size of 10 were
applied, with otherwise default settings. Possible breakpoints were further analysed using the HMM method,
which detects recombination breakpoints among four
sequences by modelling the probabilities of transitions
between the three tree topologies. This determines which
topology, at any point along the alignment, is most probable. Both PDM and HMM models are designed to compare tree topologies only and minimise the bias
introduced by rate heterogeneity among and within
sequences [80].
The compatibility criterion detected breakpoints by identifying neighbouring sites in the multiple alignment that
gave incompatible phylogenetic signals. These sites were
plotted on to a 2-dimensional space using the program
RETICULATE [35], within the RDP v2.0 platform [83].
Only binary sites were used and 100 randomised matrices
were estimated. These breakpoints were again used to
inform subsequent methods of GC detection.
The distribution criterion detected regions of significant
similarity between sequence pairs by comparing the distribution of silent polymorphisms along the alignment, i.e.,
those changes unaffected by purifying selection. Significant clustering of identical polymorphisms was identified
by GENECONV (GCV, [84]), executed within RDP v2.0.
The analysis compared sequence triplets, using default settings. P-values for GC events were calculated by permutation of the data set, with 1000 randomisations.
GENECONV produced a large number of candidate gene
conversions, but many of these were created by rate differences within and among sequences. Each candidate event
was checked to remove the obvious mistakes caused by
regions of high conservation or derivation. Furthermore,
each event was checked using a second method in the
RDP package, SISCAN (SSC, [85]). This method conducts
a sliding window analysis with a phylogenetic criterion,
calculating a p-value through sequence permutation.
Default settings were applied.
Putative AGC events required validation. Tandem gene
arrays are among the most challenging parts of genome
sequences to assemble, for much the same reason that
non-coding repetitive regions are difficult to resolve;
assembling sequence reads into contigs relies on unique
motifs to define position. It is especially difficult to determine the precise number and order of copies within an
array, where the copies differ by less than 5%. Consequently, in tandem arrays with low variation, gene copies

Page 15 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:54

may be mis-assembled and appear chimaeric because
parts of different copies have been conjoined. To consider
this, the original sequence reads were collected for every
three sequences involved in a putative GC event on chromosomes 9, 10 and 11, to act as vouchers. If sequence X
and Y were closest relatives, except for one region where X
was more akin to Z, the appropriate regions of all three
sequences had to be represented in sequence reads (each
covering 0.5–1 Kb) to confirm that a phylogenetic conflict
truly existed.
Analysis of ectopic gene conversion
Where alignment A was available, tests for GC were
repeated as described above for each array. These comparisons were designed to identify significant similarity
between gene duplicates at different loci that may be
caused by EGC. Putative EGC events were validated by
collecting voucher sequences as before, although the
potential for mis-assembly is reduced for single-copy
genes.
Relationship between gene conversion and base
composition
T. brucei tandem arrays were classified according to the
results of the preceding tests. The categories shown in
Additional file 8 classify arrays by the presence or absence
of AGC in conjunction with concerted evolution
(CE+AGC and CE-AGC arrays); the presence or absence of
EGC in conjunction with concerted evolution (CE+EGC
and CE-EGC arrays), those with some duplicates retaining
orthology, and others concerted ('mixed dynamics');
those unique to T. brucei and showing AGC; those that
have retained orthology; and those with identical copies
within T. brucei but divergence between species (i.e., UCO
or 'invariant' arrays). To test the hypothesis that double
strand-break repair mechanisms are biased towards guanine-cytosine (G-C) and result in G-C enrichment of
regions undergoing recombination or biased gene conversion [45,46], the average G-C content at the third codon
position (G-C3) of each class of tandem array was calculated using the base composition function in GCUA [86].
This was then compared to the average G-C3 value for 100
singleton genes chosen at random from all chromosomes.

Figure S1. Models of unequal crossing-over (UCO) and gene conversion
(GC). A. UCO. A tandem array of gene duplicates is shown on homologous chromosomes; colours denote slight differences in sequence. Due to
the repetitive structure of the array, mis-alignment between alleles during
meiosis or between chromatids during mitosis is frequent. This results in
unequal crossovers between homologous chromosomes that change the
length of the array and gradually homogenise it, as particular sequence
types are lost by chance. B. GC. Non-reciprocal genetic exchange between
two gene duplicates can occur in a variety of ways, five of which are shown
here. Four gene duplicates are present in a tandem array on chromosome
1; these have slight differences in sequence reflected by colour. Another
single locus is shown on chromosome 2. For both chromosomes 1 and 2,
homologous pairs are shown and depicted after DNA synthesis but before
segregation, i.e., each has two sister chromatids. In each of the following
scenarios, gene conversion might be complete or partial: i. intrachromatid,
ii. interchromatid, iii. allelic, iv. allelic (partial), v. ectopic. In this study,
types i.-iv. are all been referred to as allelic gene conversion (AGC) as they
are only distinguishable from type v., ectopic gene conversion (EGC).
