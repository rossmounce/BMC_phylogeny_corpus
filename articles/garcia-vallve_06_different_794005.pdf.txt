Abstract
Background: Papillomaviruses (PVs) infect stratified squamous epithelia in warm-blooded
vertebrates and have undergone a complex evolutionary process. The control of the expression of
the early ORFs in PVs depends on the binding of cellular and viral transcription factors to the
upstream regulatory region (URR) of the virus. It is believed that there is a core of transcription
factor binding sites (TFBS) common to all PVs, with additional individual differences, although most
of the available information focuses only on a handful of viruses.
Results: We have studied the URR of sixty-one PVs, covering twenty different hosts. We have
predicted the TFBS present in the URR and analysed these results by principal component analysis
and genetic algorithms. The number and nature of TFBS in the URR might be much broader than
thus far described, and different PVs have different repertoires of TFBS.
Conclusion: There are common fingerprints in the URR in PVs that infect primates, although the
ancestors of these viruses diverged a long time ago. Additionally, there are obvious differences
between the URR of alpha and beta PVs, despite these PVs infect similar histological cell types in
the same host, i.e. human. A thorough analysis of the TFBS in the URR might provide crucial
information about the differential biology of cancer-associated PVs.

Background
Papillomaviridae are a family of small dsDNA viruses that
infect warm-blooded vertebrates [1]. Papillomaviruses
(PVs) infect different species of mammals in the orders
Primates (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, macaque
monkey, colobus monkey, and spider monkey), Car-

nivora (cat and dog), Perissodactyla (horse), Artiodactyla
(cattle, sheep, deer, reindeer, elk), Cetacea (porpoise),
Lagomorpha (rabbit and cottontail rabbit), Sirenia (manatee) and Rodentia (african soft-furred rat, hamster, porcupine). They also infect other distantly related hosts,
such as marsupials (opossum) and birds (chaffinch and

(1) HPV2 did not cluster together with the rest of the alpha genus
(2) HPV4 did not cluster together with the rest of the gamma genus
np: the high divergence values did not allow the algorithm to rend a solution
Phylogenies were reconstructed with three different alignments, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN and TCOFFEE, subsequently analysed with four different
phylogenetic algorithms: a parsimony based algorithm – PROTPARS for protein sequences and DNAPARS for DNA sequences -, and three
different matrix-based algorithms: FITCH, Neighbor-Joining (NJ), and UPGMA. Matrices were generated with PROTDIST or DNADIST. For DNA,
two different nucleotide substitution models were used, the Kimura-two parameter model (K2) or a maximum-likelihood model (ML). Numbers
refer to the percentage of times a given group is recovered in the consensus tree for each reconstruction method, after a bootstrap of 1000 cycles.
The column "consensus" gathers the output of the CONSENSE programme with trees from all independent algorithms as input. Some algorithms
could not work with the DIALIGN alignment as input, due to the extreme divergence between the sequences. This fact is marked as "np" in the
corresponding columns. The support values decrease in the order L1>E7>URR. This reflects the diversity of the evolutionary pressures along the
genome of the papillomaviruses. Some of the genera stably recovered according to the L1 protein phylogeny appear with a lower support for the E7
protein phylogeny, and do not appear as definite groups for the URR phylogeny. This is the case for genera alpha, kappa or lambda. Some other
genera appear confidently with independence of the element analysed. This is the case for genera beta, gamma and delta. This shows that there are
differences in the evolutionary patterns between the members of different clades.

parrot), and it can be easily inferred that similar viruses
will be found in many, if not all, vertebrates [2]. Despite
the obvious absence of a sexual link in the PV cycle to
ensure cohesiveness of the genome, stable PV types are
identified, reflecting a sustained molecular selection
through continuity in the ecological conditions and in the
virus-host interactions.
Members of Papillomaviridae are associated to virtually all
clinical cases of cervical cancer [3,4]. Others are also
involved in different benign and malignant proliferative
disorders, such as skin warts, genital warts, laryngeal papillomas and possibly non-melanoma skin cancer [3,5-7].
In all cases, independently of the host and the clinical
manifestations, PVs infect stratified squamous epithelia,
both mucosal and cutaneous. The target cells are located
in the basal cell layer of the epithelia, which are available
for infection via microlesions. The viral life cycle depends
on keratinocyte differentiation. Thus, viral genomes are
primarily present as nuclear episomes, which replicate in
parallel to cell division. As the daughter cell migrates
upwards and undergoes differentiation, the viral DNA is
amplified, the viral expression pattern is modified and
results finally in virion release [8].
PVs are non-enveloped viruses, with a circular dsDNA
genome of ca. 8 Kb. The elements that regulate the expression of the early genes are located in the upstream regulatory region (URR) of the genome. This is a ca. 800 bp DNA
stretch, spanning the region between the L1 and the E6
genes. Some of the transcription factor binding sites
(TFBS) in the URR are present in all PVs, such as the binding sites for AP1, E2, NF1, Oct1, Sp1 or YY1 [9-17]. The
presence of other TFBS is type-specific [18], and could
therefore partially account for the differential anatomical
tropism of the individual viral genotype [8]. Moreover,
point mutations in the URR in variants of the same PV
type lead to changes in the replication behaviour and in
the transforming capacity of the viruses [19,20]. However,
most of the available experimental information about the
presence of TFBS refers to merely a handful of viruses,
mainly classified as high-risk viruses regarding their association with cervical cancer. This is the case for HPV16,
HPV18 or HPV31. For most PVs, however, the only available data concerns their genomic sequence and the epidemiological results linking them to various diseases. Their
molecular characteristics, genetic maps, transcription patterns, life cycle, interaction partners and modes of action
are often inferred by homology with those of the known
viruses. This might have lead to an over-generalisation of
the PV biology, systematically overlooking the fact that
different PV types within a given genus are not genetically
homogeneous, and that different PVs infecting the same
host -i.e. Alphapapillomaviruses and Betapapillomavirusesmight indeed be different organisms with different biolo-

gies [21]. This is likely to be the case for the different and
distantly related human PVs. In this sense systematic
attempts to provide a comprehensive picture of the PVs
are available [2,21], but they still do not have noticeable
impact in either clinical or basic research [22].
In this paper we have addressed the in silico analysis of the
URR of the PVs. The currently assumed hypothesis states
that most of the TFBS in the URR are common to all PVs,
with differences that could influence the different individual behaviours [23]. Our results suggest that the differences within and between genera are more dramatic than
expected. The repertoires of TFBS present in the URR are
both type- and genus-specific.
The history of the URRs in the PVs exemplifies both divergent and convergent evolution. Thus, there is an obvious
divergence between different groups that once shared a
common ancestor, such as delta and beta+gamma PVs. In
this sense we also show that PVs that infect the same host
do not necessarily share the same TFBS in the URR, as is
the case in alpha and beta PVs. Finally, the presence of
TFBS in the URR also illustrates convergent evolution
between PVs only vaguely related but that infect related
hosts. This is the case in alpha, beta, gamma, delta, mu
and nu PVs. The last common ancestor of these genera, if
any, is remote but they all infect primates and cluster
together regarding to the repertoire of TFBS present in
their URR.

Results and discussion
The untranslated regulatory region of the papillomavirus
genome does not allow a proper phylogenetic
reconstruction
We have performed a phylogenetic reconstruction of the
URRs extracted from a selection of sixty-one phylogenetically representative PVs. In order to place this in a
genomic context, the L1, E1 and E7 genes were also analysed. Phylogeny was reconstructed using three different
alignment algorithms, four different phylogenetic algorithms, and two different nucleotide substitution models
were used with each phylogenetic algorithm. Clusters
were contrasted with the PV classification as revisited by
de Villiers et al. [2]. The results for L1, E7 and the URR are
given in Table 1.

We and others have already shown that the phylogenetic
relationships between PV taxa are not homogeneous
throughout the whole PV genome [21,24-26]. Instead,
they depend on the segment of the genome being considered. The results presented here stress further this concept,
as they show that the support for the different individual
taxa is different with regards to different elements of the
genome. Some taxa are consistently recovered. This is the
case of beta PVs, infecting Primates, and delta PVs, infect-

ing Artiodactyla. These taxa appear with good bootstrap
values in the consensus tree that gathers twelve phylogenetic reconstructions, and therefore show a homogeneous
evolutionary pattern (Table 1).
Alpha PVs have undergone a complex evolutionary history [21], and the picture for the phylogeny of the URR
region adds further complexity to it. Alpha PVs do not
cluster together according to the URR phylogeny. Only the
alignment with DIALIGN analysed with the parsimony
approach was able to recover the alpha PV as a group, but
even in this case the rendered topology did not resemble
that of L1 or that of E7. In the rest of the cases there was
no obvious pattern explaining the branching topologies.
In all analysed trees, however, as well as in the consensus
tree, the alpha PV in species 10 -HPV6, 13, 74, CPV1 and
PCPV1- clustered together with a good bootstrap support:
79% support in the consensus tree. This was not the case
for other alpha PV species. The most evident cases were
HPV16 and HPV2. Thus, HPV16 did not cluster with
HPV33 and HPV52 the other two analysed members of
the alpha PV species 9. On the other hand, HPV2 did not
cluster with the rest of the alpha PVs, and other viruses
were unexpectedly closer to the rest of the alpha group
than HPV2.
Kappa PVs -infecting Lagomorpha-, lambda PVs -infecting
Carnivora- and mu PVs -infecting Primates- appear
together regarding the L1 protein sequence, and it has
been described that they share an ancient common ancestor [21]. Regarding the E7 protein sequence, lambda and
mu PVs appear together, but kappa PVs do not cluster
with them. This has been previously interpreted as a consequence of the different evolutionary patterns of the early
and late genes in these PVs [21]. The phylogeny of these
taxa according to the URR adds further complexity. Species in genus mu -HPV1 and 63- are consistently recovered
as a cluster in the URR phylogenetic consensus tree. Genera kappa and lambda, on the contrary, do not appear as
separate entities, although the four species analysed here CRPV, ROPV, COPV1 and FdPV- cluster together with a
39% support in the final consensus tree.
Our results therefore show that the reconstruction of the
phylogeny of the URR based exclusively on sequence
alignments does not provide stable topologies. Molecular
phylogenetic algorithms rely on the basic assumption that
species closely related share identities/similarities in their
sequences, and that species with high evolutionary distances show more dissimilar sequences. However, certain
conditions might result in the recovery of the false tree,
such as particular branch-length combinations, heterogeneous evolutionary rates in different branches of the tree
or heterotachy in different positions within a sequence
[27,28]. The URRs are highly heterogeneous along the dif-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/20

ferent PVs, both in composition and in length. These facts
could prevent a proper phylogenetic reconstruction [29].
Since it has been proved that different regions of the
genome of the PV show different evolutionary distances,
we have analysed this issue in the context of the evolution
of the URRs.
The untranslated regulatory region of the papillomaviruses
has diverged faster than the rest of the genome
In general, the support values for the different taxa are
higher for the L1 protein than for the E7 protein and are
lowest for the URR (Table 1). We have already shown that
late proteins have diverged less than early proteins in PVs
[21,26]. Phylogenetic reconstruction strongly depends on
the sequence similarity, and all algorithms tend to fail
when sequences are evolutionary too far from each other
[27,30]. We have therefore addressed the question
whether the poor results in the phylogenetic reconstruction for the URR could be due to a relatively higher divergence rate. Results are shown in Figure 1. We have
analysed the phylogeny of the L1, E1, E7 and URR
sequences at the DNA level. The analysis was restricted to
the genera beta and delta, since these were the only taxa
that rendered confident clustering of all their members
based on the URR (Table 1). There is an obvious gradient
of normalised divergence rate as follows: L1<E1<E7<URR,
in both beta and delta PV. The results communicated here
for L1, E1 and E7 at the DNA level coincide with previous
reports for the corresponding protein sequences [21]. In
genera beta and delta, the URR sequences have diverged
more than twice as much as the corresponding L1
sequences. These results are not unexpected, due to the
lack of coding regions in the URR. However, the phylogenies of genera beta and delta could be properly determined regarding only to the URR sequences, and
phylogenetic reconstruction is exclusively sequencedependent. High divergences hamper proper alignments,
and it is not possible to properly infer phylogenetic relationships without good alignments, as exemplified before
for the alpha PVs. Thus, despite the absence of coding
regions in the URR our results point towards the existence
of conserved elements or stretches, which might have a
functional importance. All these facts make it obvious that
alternative tools are required for the proper analysis of the
relationships between PVs, with regards to the URR.
Different papillomaviruses contain different transcription
factor binding sites in the untranslated regulatory region
Our results in the analysis of the phylogeny of the URR in
the PVs suggest the existence of locally conserved motifs,
which could be embedded in a less conserved environment. It is thought that all PVs contain binding sites in the
URR for the E2 protein, as well as for other transcription
factors [29]. Although it is believed that most URR contain the same repertoire of TFBS [23,29], experimental

Kimura-two parameter nucleotide substitution model, and
bootstrapped 10000 times. The two clades were recovered
in all the consensus trees, independently of the analysed element. Distances were normalised for each virus individually,
with respect to the L1 distance. P values show the results of
a two-tailed paired Student's t test for each virus, for the values of the elements connected by the arrow brackets. There
is a statistically significant gradient in the divergence distances
in the order L1<E1<E7<URR. Divergences in the URR are
more than two times higher than in the comparable L1 gene,
in both beta and delta clades. The high values of branchlength could account for the low support values obtained for
the phylogenetic reconstructions of the URR.
confirmation has only been provided for a handful of PVs.
We have addressed the question whether the TFBS could
be some of the conserved elements in the URR that
allowed the phylogenetic reconstruction of certain PV
taxa. We have therefore predicted the presence of TFBS in
the URR of a representative selection of PVs with the software MATCH. The algorithm compares the sequence to be
analysed with a matricial description gathering experimental information about the TFBS sequence. A similar
approach was already suggested for HPV31 using the
TRANSFAC database [23]. We have chosen a rather generous approach, computing a sum of both error rates – false
positive and false negative predictions – to find cut-offs
that give an optimal number of false positives and false
negatives. The results yielded a list with the presence of
the different considered TFBS in the corresponding URR
sequences.

The in silico prediction of probable TFBS in the URR of PVs
with the software MATCH yielded results comparable to
the experimental ones. As an example, the URR sequence
of HPV16 consisted of 832 bp and was predicted to contain 77 binding sites for 30 different transcription factors.
The density of TFBS in the URR was higher than in the rest
of the HPV16 genome, and also higher than in a random
DNA sequence with the same base composition -32.9%A,
30.6%T, 19.1%G, 17.4%C- (Fig. 2). Furthermore, all the
previously experimentally determined TFBS in the URR of
HPV16 were recovered as predicted, thus validating our
approach. An example of the results for five different PVs
from genera alpha, beta and gamma is given in Table 2.
From the results shown here it can be inferred that different PVs contain different TFBS in the URR. Some TFBS are
predicted to be present in most PVs. This is the case of AP1, AREB-6, CF2-II, E2, Elf-1, Freac-7, HFH-3, Oct-1, Skn-1
or v-Myb. Other TFBS are restricted to only certain PVs,
which could be seen to reflect differential host species- cell
type- or differentiation state-specificity. The information
thus gained in silico might widen our knowledge of the
potential reciprocal virus-cell interactions and guide
future experimental approaches.
It might be argued that the in silico prediction of TFBS
might yield both false positive and false negative results.
The higher density of predicted TFBS in the URR as compared to the rest of the genome, as well as the concordance
of the predictions with the experimental data suggest a
low risk of false negative results. Regarding the putative
false positive results, although it is possible that some of
the predicted TFBS are really not such, our approach
addresses the conservation of functional DNA stretches in
similar viruses. As an example, the presence of a HFH-3
binding site in very different viruses highlights the importance of the conservation of this DNA sequence, even if it
does not act as a HFH-3 binding site.
Beta PVs are more homogeneous than alpha PVs regarding
the repertoire of predicted TFBS in the URR
Our results suggest that the repertoire of TFBS is different
in different PVs. We have therefore hypothesised that
there are patterns of presence/absence of TFBS that could
be different in different PVs taxa. To test this hypothesis
we predicted again the presence of TFBS in the URR of
PVs, with a more conservative approach, aiming to minimise the number of false positives. The URRs were then
grouped according to the present PV classification, and
the results analysed and searched for conserved patterns
of presence/absence of TFBS in the different viral groups.
A simple initial display of the results for alpha, beta and
gamma PVs confirmed our hypothesis, as shown in Figure
3. It can be seen that certain TFBS are predicted to be
present with high confidence in some of these taxa, but
not in others. This is the case for v-Myb, present in beta

Transcription factor binding sites were predicted with MATCH, using the nucleotide matricial description of each site as compiled in TRANSFAC.
The coincidence levels between the binding site sequence and the sequence in the URR were fixed to optimise simultaneously the number of false
positives and false negatives. It is obvious that different papillomaviruses contain different transcription factor binding sites in their URR. Some of
them are common to all papillomaviruses, such as AP-1, E2, HFH-3 or Oct-1. Other TFBS are type-exclusive, genus-exclusive, or are shared by
papillomaviruses that infect the same host. The high dimensionality of these results makes it necessary to analyse them with information reduction
techniques, such as principal component analysis or genetic algorithms.

Density 2 predicted TFBS and binding TF in different DNA sequences
Density of predicted TFBS and binding TF in different DNA sequences. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)
were predicted with MATCH, using the nucleotide matricial description of each site as compiled in TRANSFAC. Predictions
were run on three DNA sequences: the URR of HPV16, the HPV16 full-genome except the URR, and a random DNA
sequence with the same base composition than HPV16. Results were normalised with respect to the actual predictions in the
randomised sequence. Values are shown for the total number of predicted TFBS (a) and for the total number of predicted
binding TF (b) since some TF were predicted to have more than one binding site.

and gamma PVs, or HNF-3beta, present in gamma PVs.
Interestingly, the presence of the E2 binding sites in
gamma PVs was relatively low, and should be experimentally analysed. The absence of a predicted E2 binding site
in gamma PVs is a result of the stringent conditions chosen for the TFBS predicted, since this binding site was also
predicted in gamma PVs in the above described les restrictive conditions. However, the selective disappearance of
this predicted E2 binding site in particular taxa might also
be highly informative. It could reflect slightly different
sequence specificity of the E2 protein in these viruses,
and/or a different regulatory scheme.
The achieved results consisted of a matrix of ninety-seven
predicted TFBS along the sixty-one analysed URR. As
shown in Fig. 2, the density of both predicted TFBS and
predicted binding TF was higher in the URR than in the
rest of the genome or in a random DNA sequence of the
same composition. Due to the high dimensionality of the
data we approached the hypothesis of the existence of
clusters using Principal Component Analysis.

PCA reduces the dimensionality of the initial dataset by
finding new variables -components or eigenvectorswhich gather the different overall tendencies of the variance in the data [31,32]. The new variables can then be
extracted, displayed and analysed. Results for the two
more important components in alpha and beta PVs are
displayed in Figure 4. It can be seen that beta PVs tend to
have high values in both principal components, 1 and 2,
and tend to cluster in the upper-right quadrant. On the
contrary, alpha PVs do not behave homogeneously and
appear dispersed throughout the other three quadrants.
Both facts correlate with our findings described above
while trying to reconstruct the phylogeny of the corresponding URR: beta PVs clustered together confidently
according to the URR sequence, whereas alpha PVs did
not appear together as a definite group. In parallel to this,
the clinical manifestations associated to infections by beta
PVs are more homogeneous than those associated with
infections by alpha PVs. All these facts further strengthen
the concept of a higher diversity within alpha PVs than
within beta PVs [21]. Finally, the newly obtained Princi-

Presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in alpha, beta and gamma papillomaviruses
Presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in alpha, beta and gamma papillomaviruses. Transcription factor binding sites were predicted with MATCH, using the nucleotide matricial description of each site as compiled in
TRANSFAC. The coincidence levels between the binding site sequence and the sequence in the URR were fixed to minimise
the number of false positives. The repertoire of transcription factor binding sites is different in different papillomaviruses. Some
binding sites, such as E2, are present in most of the analysed viruses. Others are preferentially present in beta and gamma genera, such as v-Myb or FOXD3, in genus beta, such as HNF-3beta or HFH-3, or in genus gamma, such as COMP1 or GATA-3.
pal Components are lineal combinations of the original
variables, in our case the presence/absence of TFBS in the
URR. Our PCA results suggest that the repertoire of TFBS
in alpha and beta PVs is different. We have seeked further
confirmation of this statement by analysing the matrix of
predicted TFBS by means of genetic algorithms.
Different taxa within Papillomaviridae show different
repertoires of TFBS in their URRs
Genetic algorithms allow the identification of patterns
and the formulation of predictions in highly dimensional
datasets [33]. We have applied this tool to the interpretation of our predictions of TBFS in the URR of PVs, using
the NEUROSHELLL software. Our aim was to investigate

whether different PV taxa could be distinguished attending to the predicted repertoire of TFBS in the URR. Genetic
algorithms were trained with the original results, providing additional categorical information. The defined categories corresponded either to actual taxa in the PV
classification [2], or to functional criteria, i.e. a given virus
infects primates/does not infect primates. We expected
therefore from the trained genetic algorithms answers to
the questions: i) does a given combination of TFBS distinguish a PV that infect primates from one that infect nonprimates? ii) can we predict from the combination of TFBS
to which taxon a given PV belongs? As a control, the same
input data were randomly classified into the same
number of artificial categories. Results are summarised in

Principal4Component Analysis of the prediction of TFBS in the URR of the papillomaviruses
Principal Component Analysis of the prediction of TFBS in the URR of the papillomaviruses. The predictions of
the presence/absence of TFBS in the URR of the papillomaviruses were analysed by principal component analysis. The figure
shows the distribution of alpha and beta papillomaviruses according to the two principal components, PC1 and PC2. Beta papillomaviruses, in grey, cluster together in the upper-right quadrant, whereas alpha papillomaviruses are distributed throughout
the other three quadrants. Beta papillomaviruses are therefore more homogeneous according to the principal component
analysis of TFBS in the URR than alpha papillomaviruses. This higher diversity in the alpha papillomaviruses is also observed
regarding the higher number of species comprised in this genus and to the diversity in their clinical manifestations.

Table 3. A graphical example for the alpha and beta PVs is
provided in Figure 5.
Using the predictions of the presence/absence of TFBS in
the URR of different PVs, genetic algorithms were able to
accurately predict the adscription of a given virus to a
given group. In general, a high number of members in a
group resulted in more accurate predictions. This was the
case for genera alpha, beta and delta. For other groups,
still unrepresented, genetic algorithms were unable to
generate predictions. This was the case for kappa, lambda,
mu, theta or iota PVs.

Genetic algorithms were able to discern between PVs
infecting primates and PVs non-infecting primates (Table
3). The algorithms could not formulate any prediction for
only one primate PV, HPV4, a gamma PV. Intriguingly,
HPV4 also did not cluster together with the rest of the
gamma genus when analysing the phylogeny of the URR.
For the rest of primate PVs, including human, chimpanzee, bonobo and macaque PVs, the algorithms formulated
accurate predictions. Interestingly this included also mu
PVs, which are evolutionary distant from alpha, beta and
gamma PVs. The phylogenetic reconstruction of the URR
allowed the recovery of beta, gamma and mu PVs as sepa-

Genetic algorithms were trained with the matrix describing the presence/absence of TFBS in the URR of the papillomaviruses. An additional column
was provided, including either real information about the pertenence of each virus to a genus, or about the nature of the infected host. As a
control, additional training was performed on the same matrix providing a column with a random categorisation. Numbers in the table reflect the
percentage of viruses for which the genetic algorithms rendered correct predictions, false predictions, or could not formulate any prediction,
respectively. Additional values in brackets show the specific accuracies of the predictions for the alpha and beta papillomaviruses. Genetic
algorithms were able to discern the pertenence of a given virus to a genus, attending only to the repertoire of TFBS in the URR. Specifically, alpha
and beta papillomaviruses were recognised as separate definite clades with high confidence in most of cases. The main targets of both genera are
basal cells in the stratified squamous epithelia. These results suggest that alpha and beta papillomaviruses take advantage of different control
mechanisms in the same target cell, and/or that they infect different subsets of cells, which are histologically indistiguishable. Finally, genetic
algorithms were able to recognise whether a given papillomavirus infects or not primates, regarding only the TFBS patterns in the URR.
Papillomaviruses infecting primates are phylogenetically distant, and separated long before the appearance of the primates themselves. Therefore
their clustering together according to the repertoire of TFBS suggests a uniformity of regulatory mechanisms, achieved by convergent evolution.

rate taxa, but there was no obvious close topological relationship among them. The last common ancestor of
alpha, beta, gamma and mu PVs existed before the emergence of primates as a taxon, possibly even before the
major radiative events in the mammalian lineage. Our
present results, therefore, point towards the convergent
evolution of PVs infecting primates, which is not obvious
at the mere sequence level, but is noticeable when analysing the URR at a functional level, i.e. considering the putative TFBS encoded therein.
Genetic algorithms were able to discriminate in virtually
all cases between alpha and beta PVs with regards to the
TFBS repertoire in the URR (Figure 5). Moreover, genetic
algorithms could also correctly identify alpha and beta
PVs as definite groups, both when trained with the data
corresponding to all analysed PVs, and when trained with
the data corresponding to human PVs only (Table 3).
These results further show the strength of our approach
and suggest interesting implications in the differential regulation caused by both virus genera. On the one hand, we
were able to recover alpha PVs as a distinct group, despite
the absence of a high degree of sequence similarity among
their members. On the other hand, alpha and beta PVs
share histologically the same host, namely the keratinocytes in the basal cell layer of stratified squamous epithelia
in primates [2,8]. However, the repertoire of TFBS is different in alpha and beta PVs. Different hypotheses could
explain this fact. This might reflect the existence of different subpopulations of keratinocytes in the basal cell layer,
histologically not distinguishable, with differential susceptibilities to the infection by alpha and beta PVs. Alter-

natively, alpha and beta PVs could have taken advantage
of different protein expression regulatory mechanisms in
the infected cell, which would correlate with the presence
of different TFBS in their URR.

Conclusion
The URR of the PVs is at least partially responsible for the
tissue tropism, differential transcription, and for the
changes in transcription patterns related to host-cell differentiation [8]. The sequence divergence in the URR is
very high, and this fact prevents a proper phylogenetic
reconstruction of the URR for most of the PV genera. We
have therefore addressed the in silico analysis of the URR
from a functional point of view. We have predicted the
presence of TFBS in the URR of a phylogenetically representative selection of PVs. The results were analysed by
means of principal component analysis and genetic algorithms.
We have shown that different PVs have different repertoires of TFBS in the URR, even in PVs that infect the same
host. This fact could correlate with differential expression
patterns and changes as a response to host-cell differentiation. PVs infecting primates show a characteristic TFBS
fingerprint, and can therefore be distinguished from other
PVs. Since these PVs are polyphyletic [21], the similarities
in the functionality of the URR might have appeared as a
result of convergent coevolution, arisen under the evolutionary pressure of sharing the same host. The alpha and
beta PVs genera are stably recovered as distinct groups
according to the TFBS they contain, despite the absence of
a high degree of sequence similarity between their mem-

bers. Both genera infect the same cell type in the same
host, but the differences in the TFBS they contain may
reflect the existence of different subtypes of keratinocytes
and/or the existence of different regulatory mechanisms
in different viruses.

Phylogenetic analysis
ORF sequences identified in the databases as coding L1 or
E7, and DNA sequences corresponding to the entire URR
were used for phylogenetic inference. The URRs were
defined as the DNA sequences lying between the L1 and
the E6 ORFs of the PV circular genome. Three alignment
algorithms were used: T-COFFEE, which combines information for both global and local homologies [34], CLUSTALW, a progressive alignment algorithm [35], and
DIALIGN [36], a local segment alignment algorithm. The
results were fed into the PHYLIP programme package for
both parsimony and distance matrix evolutionary analysis. DNA phylogeny was estimated by the parsimony
method with DNAPARS. Two distance matrices were also
generated with DNADIST, under two different nucleotide
substitution models, a Kimura-two-parameter model or a
maximum likelihood model. Both distance matrices were
then analysed with FITCH, which estimates phylogenies
from distance matrix data under the "additive tree model"
according to which the distances are expected to equal the
sums of branch lengths between the species, using the
Fitch-Margoliash criterion. Alternatively, the distance
matrix was analysed with NEIGHBOR, under both the
Neighbor-Joining and UPGMA methods of clustering. The
statistical support was assessed by 1000 cycles bootstrap-

Our results indicate that the diversity among alpha PVs
regarding the URR is higher than among other groups,
such as beta or delta PVs. This suggests that a thorough
analysis of the repertoire of TFBS within the alpha PV
genus could provide us with functional hints explaining
the differences in the biology of their members, such as
their differential association with benign or malignant
growth.
Finally, it is obvious that different PVs have different repertoires of TFBS. Thus far, most of research concerning
URR and transcriptional regulation has focused for obvious reasons on high-risk PVs. Our results again stress the
concept that different viruses are different organisms, with
potentially different biological properties that might not
be directly extrapolated from the results of a human-based
biased selection of PVs. The broadening of the number
and diversity of the PVs to be empirically studied will
surely provide us not only with a broader knowledge of
Papillomaviridae, but also will strengthen our armoury
against the diseases they cause.

Prediction of transcription factor binding sites
Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the genome
region between the L1 and the E6 genes were predicted
with MATCH, designed for searching potential binding
sites for TFBS nucleotide sequences. MATCH uses a library
of mononucleotide weight matrices from TRANSFAC 6.0.
In brief, the MATCH algorithm looks for matches between
the nucleotide weight matrices that experimentally define
the TFBS and the analysed URR sequence. A matrix similarity value is then calculated depending on the quality of
the match between the core sequence of the matrix -the
most conserved positions- and a part of the input
sequence. A positive match must have a score higher than
or equal to the core similarity cut-off. We have chosen a
high cut-off value, designed to reduce the number of random sites found by MATCH.

the predicted repertoire of TFBS in the URR. The predictions of TFBS in the URR were analysed by genetic algorithms, including additional information about the genus they
belong, alpha or beta (a). Controls were performed with the
same predictions, but including random adscription to one of
two categories (b). Expected values are shown as open circles, and predicted values are shown as crosses. The elements for which the genetic algorithms could not formulate
predictions are labelled as "NP", non-predictable. (a) Genetic
algorithms were able to correctly discern alpha and beta papillomaviruses with regards exclusively to their TFBS patterns.
(b) The negative control shows that this result is not dependent on the information contained in the prediction matrix
itself, but on the categorisation additionally provided. Thus,
the repertoire of TFBS in the URR is different between alpha
and beta PVs, although both genera infect histologically similar target cells in the same hosts.

ping with the SEQBOOT and CONSENSE programmes.
Thus, three different alignments were analysed with four
different phylogenetic methods, yielding twenty-one different estimates of the phylogenetic relationship within
DNA PV sequences.

PCA is a method widely used in pattern-recognition studies [31,32]. This statistical tool promotes dimension
reduction and modelling of the original data by creating
new coordinate axes defined according to the principal
components (PCs) extracted from the original data. The
initial dataset is displayed in an n-dimensional space, n
being the number of defined variables. In our case n is the
total number of different predicted TFBS in the whole
sequence dataset. The first PC is determined by looking
for the direction of the maximum residual variance in the
n-dimensional space. From the remaining data variance after the removal of the first PC- a second PC that is completely uncorrelated with – i.e. orthogonal to – the first
one is extracted, and accounts for the maximum possible
remaining dataset variance. PC1 always explains more of
the total information than PC2, PC3 and others. The procedure is then repeated until all PCs are generated.
PCA is an extremely useful tool, which maps samples
through scores and loadings. Score plots allow sample
identification, clarifying whether they are similar or dissimilar, typical or outliers. Moreover, loadings plots allow
the checking of the correlation between variables and also
enable the variables that contribute most to each principal
component to be defined.
A genetic algorithm is a random, yet directed search for an
optimal solution to a problem [33]. In our case the problem is the categorisation of the MATCH results describing
the presence/absence of the different TFBS in the original
URR sequences dataset. We have used the NEUROSHELL

software. The algorithm searches for optimisation by first
encoding the initial information into a "genetic" formalism. Thus, a population of "organisms" that contain a
"genome" made up of "genes" is first formally defined.
The genes are the parameters to be optimised and the
organisms are solutions to the optimisation problems. In
each generation organisms are allowed to recombine and
mutate. For each new organism it is calculated how well
its parameters solve our categorisation problem. The better they solve the problem the "fitter" they are, and therefore the probability of "surviving" and "breeding" will
also be higher. After many generations the error surface is
thoroughly explored and the population evolves towards
a fitter state. At this point we are provided with an algorithm that weights the contribution of each variable, in
our case presence/absence of TFBS, to the solution of the
problem, in our case the categorisation of the initial URR
sequences. The accuracy of the categorisation predictions
can then be tested and their usefulness evaluated.
