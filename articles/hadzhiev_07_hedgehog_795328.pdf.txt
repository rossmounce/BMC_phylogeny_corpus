Abstract
Background: Little is known about the control of the development of vertebrate unpaired
appendages such as the caudal fin, one of the key morphological specializations of fishes. Recent
analysis of lamprey and dogshark median fins suggests the co-option of some molecular mechanisms
between paired and median in Chondrichthyes. However, the extent to which the molecular
mechanisms patterning paired and median fins are shared remains unknown.
Results: Here we provide molecular description of the initial ontogeny of the median fins in
zebrafish and present several independent lines of evidence that Sonic hedgehog signaling
emanating from the embryonic midline is essential for establishment and outgrowth of the caudal
fin primordium. However, gene expression analysis shows that the primordium of the adult caudal
fin does not harbor a Sonic hedgehog-expressing domain equivalent to the Shh secreting zone of
polarizing activity (ZPA) of paired appendages.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that Hedgehog proteins can regulate skeletal appendage
outgrowth independent of a ZPA and demonstrates an unexpected mechanism for mediating Shh
signals in a median fin primordium. The median fins evolved before paired fins in early craniates,
thus the patterning of the median fins may be an ancestral mechanism that controls the outgrowth
of skeletogenic appendages in vertebrates.

Background
Living primitive chordates like Branchiostoma and the
agnathan hagfishes have a very simple, non-differentiated
caudal fin fringe, whereas lampreys are characterized by
separate and differentiated caudal and dorsal median fins
[1]. Recent analyses concur that the fossil jawless verte-

brates ("ostracoderms"), which have differentiated
median fins and either no or one pair (pectoral) fins, form
the stem group of the Gnathostomata. This phylogenetic
pattern implies that median fins appeared before paired
fins [2]. The mechanisms patterning median fins may be
ancestral to those used by the paired fins and limbs [3].

Gnathostomes primitively have paired pectoral and pelvic
fins, as well as unpaired caudal, anal and at least one dorsal fin, which together is the ancestral morphology well
matched by zebrafish [1].
The development of paired appendages such as wings, fins
and limbs has been intensively studied and many details
about the underlying molecular mechanisms are known
(reviewed in [4]). For instance, the signaling molecule
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a morphogen [5] that emanates
from the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), a domain of
cells positioned at the base of the outgrowing paired fin
and limb buds [6-8]. Shh expressing cells can mimic the
activity of the ZPA and can lead to mirror image duplications of appendages. Thus, Shh is the factor responsible
for the patterning activity of the ZPA (reviewed in [9]).
Recently, it has been established that the main function of
Shh in the ZPA is to counteract the repressing activity of
Gli3 thus demonstrating an antagonistic hierarchy in
establishing antero-posterior patterning of limbs [10-12].
In contrast to the mechanisms underlying the development of paired appendages, very little is known about the
formation of median fins [3,13]. In teleosts, the median
fins develop from the embryonic fin folds [3,14] by
expansion of the mesenchyme underlying the ectodermal
layer of the embryonic fin fold [14]. It has been suggested
that the processes of embryonic fin fold and adult median
fin formation involve independent genetic mechanisms
[3,13]. The fin fold mesenchyme is the source of both the
endoskeletal and exoskeletal structures of the adult caudal
fin and has been suggested to receive contribution from
trunk neural crest [15,16]. Recently, the origin of median
fin primordial cells was investigated in dogshark and lampreys and the authors concluded that median fin cells are
primarily of somitic origin with some contribution from
neural crest [17]. Furthermore, regionalization of Hox and
Tbx18 gene expression in median fin buds was demonstrated in the same study and thus indicated that common
molecular mechanisms are utilized by median and paired
fins. For example, hoxb8a was implicated as an important
factor in the outgrowth of the caudal fin of medaka
(Oryzias latipes) [18].
The lack of appropriate marker genes to follow the initial
development and patterning of median fin primordium
together with the late, post-embryonic ontogeny of
median fins in Osteichthyes [19] prevents genetic analysis
in mutants affecting paired fin development in zebrafish
because they are mostly embryonic lethal [8] and die
before tail fin morphology can be studied. In particular, a
problem which has not yet been possible to address due
to the early lethal nature of Hh pathway mutants in
zebrafish is whether Hh signaling would have a role in
patterning the median fin primordium.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/75

In this report we describe a molecular marker for the earliest phase of adult caudal fin primordium development
in zebrafish, which facilitates the detection of median fin
precursor cells as early as 1.5 days post fertilization. We
provide several lines of evidence, which indicate a crucial
role for Hh signaling in the patterning of the caudal fin
endoskeletal primordium without detecting a sonic
hedgehog secreting zone of polarizing activity.

Results
To address the role of key signaling mechanisms in
median fin patterning appropriate marker genes are
required for labeling the median fin primordia. In the lack
of marker genes for the earliest events in median fin formation we have exploited a GFP transgenic zebrafish line.
As part of a study of floor plate and notochord-specific
regulatory elements of shh we have generated one stable
transgenic zebrafish line that expresses green fluorescent
protein (gfp) ectopically in the primordia of the median
fins from a very early stage of development (Fig. 1) as a
result of a position of integration effect (see Fig. 2A–D).
The expression of this transgene reporter marks a small
group of cells in the embryonic fin fold mesenchyme ventral to the caudal end of the notochord as early as 36 hours
post fertilization (hpf) (Fig. 1B, H). The GFP activity gradually expands in a radial manner, generating an expression domain, which strikingly overlaps with the gap in the
melanophore streak appearing in the fin fold mesenchyme at 72 hpf (Fig. 1C, I, J). By 7 days post fertilization
(dpf), the GFP domain develops into a fan-shape and a
new symmetry plane emerges, which splits it into two distinct anterior and posterior regions (Fig. 1E, also see time
lapse animation in Additional file Fig. S1). These expression domains correspond to the future dorsal and ventral
lobes of the caudal fin after the subsequent bending of the
body axis dorsally (Fig. 1F, G and see time lapse movie in
Supplementary Fig. S1) and thus represent a molecular
correlate of one of the key morphological specializations
of the teleosts [20]. The GFP expression further subdivides
at around 9 dpf resulting in a stronger proximal and a late
developing weaker distal activity (Fig. 1F, G arrows and
arrowheads, respectively). The transgene expression in the
proximal domain of the median fin primordia is the consequence of an aberrant activation due to a position effect
at the integration site and not due to shh regulatory elements present in the transgene construct (Fig. 2A–D). The
proximal transgene expression domain remains active
throughout the subsequent ontogeny of the caudal fin
and marks the perichondrium (Fig. 2H–J, Suppl. Fig. S1).
These results indicate that the proximal GFP expression
domain marks the cells of the adult caudal fin primordium (ACFP) from a very early stage when no obvious cellular features of the ACFP can yet be distinguished and
provides a lineage tracer for the formation of endoskeletal
structures of the caudal fin.

the endoskeletal territory (arrows in F, G) and distally in the
fin rays (arrowheads in F, G). GFP is expressed continually in
the floor plate (open arrowhead in G). H-J, gfp mRNA
expression in the ACFP is first detected at 1.5 dpf by in situ

The distal GFP domain is restricted to the growing tip of
the fin rays from 10 dpf onwards (Fig. 1G, Suppl. Fig S1).
Importantly, the distal domain of GFP is not due to the
position effect, but an inherent property of the transgene
construct (Fig 2A–D). This GFP domain is physically separated from the proximal domain marking the ACFP during the process of ossification of the fin rays (Fig. 2E–G)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/75

and is consistent with the activation of shh expression in
the growing tip of fin rays first detected at late larval stages
with a suggested function in caudal fin regeneration [21].
Similarly, all other median fins, such as the dorsal and
anal fin primordia are marked by both GFP domains during development (see Additional file Fig. S2). The expression of GFP is also present in the paired pectoral fins from
36 hpf in the fin bud mesenchyme disc at 5 dpf and
throughout subsequent pectoral fin development (see
Additional file Fig. S3). Together, these results indicate
that the proximal GFP expression in this transgenic fish is
the earliest expressed molecular marker in median fin primordia and a general marker for endoskeletal structures of
skeletal appendages in zebrafish. Therefore, the fortuitous
expression of GFP in the ACFP in this transgenic line can
be exploited to address questions about the patterning of
median fin primordia in a similar fashion to the application of enhancer trap and position effect lines marking
specific tissues [22,23]. Moreover, the GFP marker in the
embryonic fin fold thus facilitates the genetic analysis of
ACFP patterning and development in embryonic lethal
mutants before these mutants die.
Given the role of Hh signaling from the localized expression of shh in the ZPA of paired fins and limbs, we asked
whether Hh pathway components are expressed in the
ACFP which would indicate the possible existence of a
comparable organizing center of the caudal fin/unpaired
fins. Interestingly, expression of smoothened (smu) was
detected specifically in the ACFP (compare Fig. 3A, B, J).
Gli3 [24] which together with shh regulates antero-posterior patterning in the tetrapod limbs [10,12] is also
expressed specifically in the ACFP (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the
recently described you gene which has been implicated as
a permissive mediator of Hedgehog signaling [25,26] is
also specifically detectable in the ACFP region (Fig. 3D).
Taken together, the specific activity of Hedgehog signaling
pathway components, such as smu, gli3, you together with
the expression of ptc in the caudal fin primordium (Fig.
4F) strongly argue for a direct role of Hh signaling in the
ACFP.
In contrast, no shh or any other known zebrafish hedgehog
gene expression was detected where the ACFP marker gfp
expression is clearly detectable at 36, 48 and 72 hpf by
whole mount in situ hybridization (Fig. 3A, D and data
not shown). To exclude the possibility that the lack of
detection of expression of shh and other hedgehogs in the
ACFP is due to low levels below the sensitivity threshold
of the whole mount in situ hybridization technique, we
have addressed this question by a real time RT PCR
approach on microsurgically prepared ACFP and control
fin fold samples. ACFP tissue samples were prepared from
3 days old transgenic zebrafish larvae without midline tissues. As control, similar sized dorsal fin fold tissue which

also includes shh expressing cells such as the floor plate
and the notochord (DFF) were excised (see Fig. 3H, I).
Expression of GFP was detected in both ACFP and DFF as
expected. In contrast, none of the known zebrafish hedgehog genes including shh, shhb (previously named as twhh),
ihhb, [6,27], ihha and dhh [6,28] were detectable in the
ACFP (Fig. 3K, and see Additional file Fig. S4), while shh,
shhb and ihhb were detectable in the control tissue sample
(DFF) which included the notochord and floor plate,
known sources of shh, shhb and ihhb. Ihha was described to
be active in the chondrocytes of the forming hypurals of
the caudal fin in late stages (10 mm larvae, approx. 15
dpf) [28]. We were able to confirm the presence of ihha in
late stages of caudal fin development (10–15 dpf) by
using real time RT PCR (Fig. 3L). In contrast, we have
found no evidence for the activity of either ihh homologs
in the ACFP at 2.5 dpf and 3 dpf using a sensitive real time
RT PCR approach (Fig. 3J, Fig. S4). Taken together, none
of the known hedgehog genes in zebrafish show detectable
activity in the ACFP by two independent detection techniques. Importantly, the lack of shh or shhb expression in
the ACFP suggests that the caudal fin primordium does
not contain an Hh-expressing domain equivalent to the
ZPA of paired appendages. In addition, the GFP transgene
is present in the pectoral fin but it is not active in the
domain of expression of endogenous shh in the ZPA (Fig.
3F, G). These result together with the observation that shh
is not expressed in the ACFP further support our conclusion that the GFP activity in the ACFP results from a transgenic position effect and does not reflect the tissue
specificity of the regulatory elements of the transgene promoter. However, the activity of downstream Hedgehog
pathway components suggests a long distance Hedgehog
signaling function in the ACFP.

expression in the fin fold is absent (arrows). The melanophores

(arrows in D, E) and ptc (arrows in F, G) are lost or strongly

expressed in the embryonic fin fold in wild type (H, arrow) and in
smu-/- mutants (I, arrow). Lateral views on embryonic tail region of
72 hpf embryos are shown. Scale bar in F indicates 100 µm.

Since Hedgehog pathway components were found to be
active in the ACFP we asked whether Hh signaling is
required for the formation of the ACFP. To this end, we
utilized the GFP transgene expression as marker for the
ACFP in sonic you (syu-/-) and slow muscle omitted mutants
(smu-/-) that are defective in the function of Shh and the
Hh co-receptor Smoothened, respectively [29,30]. GFP
expression was strongly reduced or completely lost in the
region of the ACFP of the two mutants, indicating that
Shh signaling is required for normal patterning of the
ACFP (compare Fig. 4A to 4B, C). Similarly, bmp4 [31] a
marker of median fin bud in dogfish [32] and the Shh target gene patched (ptc) [33] are expressed in the wild type
ACFP but are vastly impaired in Hh pathway mutants at
72 hpf (Fig. 4D, E and 4F, G respectively). Expression of
the mesenchyme marker msx-C [34] however, was unaffected (Fig. 4H, I) indicating that the ACFP phenotype in
smu-/- is not due to general loss of fin fold mesenchyme. A
further aspect of both smu-/- and syu-/- mutant phenotypes
is the mismigration of melanophores resulting in the loss

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/75

of the melanophore gap that marks the position of the
ACFP in wild type embryos (compare Fig. 3A to 3B, C).
The mutant data together with the expression of Shh pathway components clearly indicates that GFP expression in
the ACFP requires sonic hedgehog function and the activity
of the canonical Hh signaling pathway.
Next, we addressed the question when Hh signaling is
required for development of the ACFP. Hh signaling was
blocked in a temporally controlled manner by administering the alkaloid drug cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of
Smoothened protein function [35], at different developmental stages. Cyclopamine treatment at 24 hpf to 48 hpf
results in loss of transgene expression in the ACFP phenocopying the effects seen in syu-/- and smu-/- mutants (Fig. 5A
to Fig. 4B, C and see Fig. S5). Thus, cyclopamine treatment
appears as efficient as blocking the Hh pathway genetically and resulted in eventual lethality of the larvae. When
administered at 48, 72 or 96 hpf for 24 hours each time,
cyclopamine treatment still resulted in a reduction of the
GFP expression domain while controls were unaffected
(Fig. 5B–D and see Additional file Fig. S5). The effect of
cyclopamine treatment showed a decreasing trend as
development progressed (compare treatment at 48 h to 96
h). Taken together, these results demonstrate a continuing
requirement for Hh signaling in the growing caudal fin
primordium during larval stages.
To assess whether Hh signals act directly on ACFP mesenchymal cells, we tested the cell autonomous requirement
for Smoothened function in caudal fin mesenchyme by
cell transplantation analysis. We used the gfp transgene
expression as a marker to assess the ability of transplanted
cells to contribute to the ACFP. We carried out cell transplantations from wild type (wt) and smu-/- donor embryos
(harboring the gfp transgene in 75% of the cases, see Materials and Methods) to wt and smu-/- non-transgenic recipient embryos. All wt transgenic cells in the fin fold
mesenchyme of wt recipients (200 embryos with rhodamine-dextran labeled cells in the fin fold mesenchyme)
show the expected GFP signal in the proximal part of the
caudal fin mesenchyme (Fig. 5E–G). In contrast, transgenic smu-/- cells did not express GFP in a wt environment
indicating a cell-autonomous requirement for smu (45
embryos with rhodamine-positive cells in the fin fold
mesenchyme, Fig. 5H–J). As expected, transplantations of
smu-/- cells to smu-/- recipient embryos (n = 23 embryos)
did not result in rhodamine-labeled cells in the fin fold
mesenchyme. However, smu-/- cells can activate the transgene in the floor plate mimicking shh expression in smu-/embryos [30] (n = 13, Fig. 5K), and excluding the possibility that smu-/- cells have a general defect that prevents
expression of the transgene. Wt to smu-/- transplants (n =
174 embryos) failed in all cases to contribute to the caudal
fin fold mesenchyme and to express the transgene in this

location. Instead, donor cells were present in the ectoderm or in the hemangiogenic mesenchyme of the tail
only (Fig. 5L, M) indicating that a wild type environment
with functional Smoothened is required for the correct
cell fate decisions of precursor cells.
An important question is the source of the Hedgehog signals in ACFP patterning. The fin fold mesenchyme has
been found to be devoid of hh expression, however, the
near-by notochord and floor plate, the closest tissues that
express shh are good candidates for providing such signals
(Fig. 1A#150;G). To address the requirement for a functional midline in ACFP patterning, floating head (flh)
mutants were utilized, which lack notochord and all or
most of the posterior floor plate [36] and as a result, show
no expression of shh in the trunk and tail [37]. At 3 dpf
lack of midline shh activity is demonstrated in flh-/- mutant
embryos by the shh promoter driven GFP (arrowheads in
Fig. 6A, B). The lack of functional midline was coupled
with the lack or substantially reduced GFP activity in the
ACFP of the fin fold mesenchyme (in 96.2% of embryos,
n = 62, arrows in Fig. 6A, B) while the fin fold mesenchyme remained unaffected as indicated by msx-C (Fig.
6C, D). This result indicates that a functional midline is
required for the patterning of the ACFP. If midline plays a
role in ACFP patterning by providing Shh, it is expected
that in flh-/- mutants in which a small number of Shh
expressing residual floor plate cells occasionally appear,
the ACFP phenotype may be rescued. To address this possibility we have exploited the residual floor plate cells in
flh-/- mutants and compared the ACFP regions of flh-/embryos with or without floor plate cells (arrowheads in
Fig. 6B, E, and 6F). Most of the embryos with floor plate
cells (70.9%, n = 85) showed distinguishable recovery of
the ACFP (arrow in Fig. 6E, F). In contrast, flh-/- embryos
without floor plate cells showed ACFP GFP recovery only
in 26.9% (n = 52) of the embryos analyzed. This result
indicates that functional midline cells are associated with
the ACFP and shh expressing cells of the midline likely
contribute to the rescue of the ACFP patterning. The fact,
that syu-/- mutants have both floor plate and notochord,
but lack functional Shh, together with the above results in
flh-/- mutants is consistent with the suggested role of the
midline in ACFP patterning to provide Shh signals.

Discussion
In summary, gene expression analysis, cell transplantations, mutant analysis and conditional Hh inhibition
experiments indicate a direct requirement for Shh signaling during early patterning of the ACFP. In contrast to the
ZPA of wings, paired fins and limbs of Osteichthyes, shh is
not expressed within the ACFP. However, several lines of
evidence suggests that the ACFP is an early target of
Hedgehog signals and that Shh originates from the notochord and floor plate indicating a long distance delivery

mechanism functioning in the caudal fin primordium.
This finding provides the earliest acting molecular mechanism uncovered that function in the caudal fin primordium of Osteichthyes and brings into focus the question
of the evolutionary origin and mechanism of Hh signaling
in vertebrate appendage specification.
The local expression of several Hedgehog signaling pathway components and the lack of hedgehog gene expression
in the ACFP is consistent with a long distance Hedgehog
signaling mechanism while it does not exclude the possibility that Hh signaling also acts on premigratory or
migrating precursor cells. The you (Scube2) gene was identified as a component of the Shh pathway component acting at long distance [25,26] which is active in Shh
receiving cells and shows high expression levels away
from the source of Shh in the neural tube. Interestingly,
the you gene is already expressed in the embryonic fin fold
in the caudal region at 1 dpf [25] and is specifically
expressed in the ACFP (this study). However, the you gene
is redundant in the patterning of the ACFP probably due
to the existence of several complementing you paralog
(our unpublished data). Similarly to the you gene, smu is
expressed at high levels away from the source of Shh in the
dorsal brain [30] and dorsal neural tube as well as in the
ACFP. These expression activities together with the lack of
detectable hedgehog gene expression provide support to
the notion of a Hedgehog signaling mechanism acting at
a distance in the ACFP.
The data presented in this study does not explain the exact
mechanism of the Hh signaling, however several studies
provide parallels from other tissues of the vertebrate
embryo that may be analogous to the mechanisms present
in the caudal fin primordium. A long distance Hedgehog
signaling mechanism could act through migrating cells
that contribute to the caudal fin primordium. For example, Hh signaling acts in the migrating murine cranial neural crest cells in mouse and fish [38,39] and a potentially
similar mechanism may act in the ACFP. Recent work in
lamprey and dogshark suggests that the median fins are
mainly of sclerotomal origin, albeit some contribution
from the neural crest has also been demonstrated in these
basal vertebrates [17]. Further reports suggest that trunk
neural crest contributes to the caudal fin and other
median fins also in Osteichthyes [15,18,40]. Trunk neural
crest cells migrate from a dorsal aspect of the trunk ventrally alongside the midline, which is a known source of
Hedgehogs, which may take effect on these migrating
cells. Alternatively, somitic mesoderm (sclerotome) cells
migrating ventrally may also contribute to the caudal fin
primordium similarly to that observed in the embryonic
fin fold of axolotl [41]. Hedgehog signaling could also act
on somitic cells similarly to the way Shh expressed in the
midline functions in patterning the muscle pioneer cells

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/75

that migrate laterally to form the slow muscle [42,43]. It
is interesting to note, that in our cell transplantation
experiments when wild type cells were transplanted into
smu-/- mutants, these wt cells failed to migrate to where the
ACFP would normally form. This result suggests that
hedgehog signaling is also required for the correct migration of cells into the ACFP and this likely represent an
additional non-cell autonomous function for Hedgehog
signaling, prerequisite to the formation of the caudal fin
primordium. The cells of the ACFP mesenchyme, however, are unlikely to be solely originating from cell migration, and local cell proliferation within the territory,
where we have identified the ACFP has also been reported
[44]. The process of cell migration and local cell proliferation in the ACFP is likely regulated by non-canonical
Wnt signaling, as suggested by the analysis of Wnt5a function in hoxb8a mutant medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) [18].
It will be interesting to address the possible regulatory
relationship between Hh and Wnt signaling in the caudal
fin priordium.
Whether Hedgehog signaling acts on mesodermal or neural crest derived cells in the zebrafish caudal fin is yet to be
determined as the origin of the ACFP cells is yet unknown
and requires cell fate mapping in developing caudal fins.
Due to the late developing nature of the tail primordium
novel fate mapping technologies will have to be adapted
to zebrafish such as the tissue specific and conditional
activation of marker genes in somitic and neural crest cells
of the developing tail [45].
It cannot be excluded at this point that other hedgehog
genes such as shhb and ihhb expressed in the midline during the formation of the ACFP may also contribute to its
development. The data presented here with the syu
mutant and the fact that shh is the only hh gene continually expressed in the midline during the time of the formation for the ACFP strongly suggests that Shh is the key
protein functioning in early ACFP patterning. While direct
comparisons between the paired limbs and the caudal fin
can not be made due to the fundamental morphological
differences between these appendages, it is interesting to
note that several regulators of limb buds are active in and
required for ACFP development.
It is not possible to address what adult morphology is specifically affected by the loss of Shh signaling as the Shh
pathway mutants as well as cyclopamine treated embryos
die before markers of adult caudal fin appear and can be
analyzed. In this respect it is interesting to note that Shh
was previously implicated in promoting chondrogenesis
in mesenchyme cells [46]. Nevertheless, several aspects of
ACFP patterning are affected besides the aberrant GFP
expression in Hh pathway mutants, including the aberrant expression of bmp4 and mis-migration of melano-

phores that form the gap which marks the anteroposterior position of the ACFP in wild type embryos.
Antero-posterior (A-P) asymmetry of differentiated
endoskeletal morphology is a fundamental feature of gnathostome paired and unpaired fins [20]. Due to the lack
of markers for the antero-posterior domains of the ACFP
our experiments on Shh signaling components, could not
reveal an obvious role for these molecules in the A-P patterning of the caudal fin primordium. The expression of
GFP and the additional genes studied in the ACFP all
express in a similar antero-posterior extent. As it is demonstrated by the time lapse analysis of the GFP expression,
these marker genes do not represent obvious antero-posterior restricted expression at least at the time of the initial
formation of the ACFP domain. However, our results suggest significant modifications of the functions of common
molecular components in the caudal fin in comparison to
paired fins/limb buds. The expression of Shh in the ZPA
has previously been suggested to contribute to the morphological changes resulting in separation of the fin from
the body wall in Osteichthyes [32] and has been proposed
to be co-opted after the Osteichthyes/Chondrichthyes
split [32,11]. Recently, contrasting data have been published [47] demonstrating that skate (Raja erinacea) and a
shark species (Chiloscyllum punctatum) possesses posterior
shh expression in pectoral and dorsal fins, suggesting, that
the shh expression domain in appendages is an ancient
property, which may have remained undetected in dogfish [32] possibly due to the secondary loss of this expression domain in dogfish. Shh expression, however, was
also found in the dorsal fin of skate and shark. This observation raises the question, whether polarized expression
of shh would also be an ancient character in all median
fins including the caudal fin. If this was the case, the lack
of detectable shh expression in the zebrafish caudal fin primordium would suggest secondarily loss of shh expression. Unfortunately, neither of the above cited
publications has addressed the expression of shh in the
caudal fin buds of chondricthyans specifically and thus
this question remains to be answered.
Alternatively, the uncovered Hh signaling function of the
caudal fin primordium in the zebrafish without local shh
source may represent ancient but fundamentally different
way of fin patterning mechanism from that of paired and
dorsal median fins. Although the cyprinid caudal fin, like
those of other teleosts, is derived in being abbreviated and
having a lepidotrichial field with a symmetry plane, the
fundamental architecture of the zebrafish caudal fin is
ancient. Notably, the endoskeleton of the zebrafish caudal
fin contains modified forms of ancestral fin radials that
during early development relate spatially to the notochord in the same manner as in the earliest gnathostomes.
The molecular correlates of caudal fin formation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/75

described here are concerning the primordium of
endoskeletal components of the caudal fin, as marked by
the proximal GFP label of the ACFP. Thus, the patterning
of the ACFP may represent the primitive gnathostome
condition. In this respect, it will be particularly interesting
to ask whether Hh signaling pathway components including shh are also expressed in the caudal fin buds of basal
gnathostome and jawless vertebrates. Since median fins
are evolutionarily more ancient structures than paired fins
with the caudal fin being the oldest skeletal appendage of
chordates [1], we speculate that the patterning of early
median fin primordia by Shh signaling may be an ancient
mechanism that reflects the primitive state of skeletal
appendage specification in vertebrates.

Conclusion
In this study we have provided an ontogenic description
of the primordium of a teleost caudal fin, which is an
important morphological specialisation of fishes and as a
median fin, is considered as one of the evolutionary oldest
vertebrate skeletogenic appendages. Secondly, we have
gathered evidence by four independent approaches:
mutant data, inhibitor drug treatment, gene expression
analysis and cell autonomy analysis to demonstrate that
Hedgehog signaling is a regulator of caudal fin development. Thirdly, we uncovered an intriguing difference
between Hh signal delivery in paired fins that contain a
Shh expressing region referred to as the zone of polarizing
activity (ZPA) and the caudal fin primordium of zebrafish
that we show does not express Shh. This finding provides
ammunition to the debate about when and where Hedgehog signaling was first utilised in appendage development
during vertebrate evolution.

Methods
The 2.2shh:gfp:ABC#15 transgenic line was produced as
described [48]. It contains a transgene which harbors the
gfp under control of shh regulatory elements responsible
for shh expression in the floor plate and notochord [49]
located within the 2.2 kb upstream of the transcriptional
start site of shh and downstream elements embedded in
the shh introns 1 and 2. GFP expression in embryos was
detected by Nikon SMZ1500 fluorescence microscope and
by Leica TCSNT confocal microscope. Alcian blue staining
was carried out as described [21].
Mutant analysis
Identified heterozygous carriers of mutant alleles (sonic
you, syut4[29], slow muscle omitted, smu641[30]floating head,
flhN1 [36]) were crossed with heterozygous transgenic
fish. Incross of the resulting offspring from three independent parent crosses were analyzed for the presence of
mutant phenotypes and associated transgene activity.

In situ hybridization
For producing gli3 antisense probe [24] (AY377429) a
2717 bp fragment, from sequence region most diverged
from the homologous gli2 mRNA, (NM_130967) was
amplified by RT-PCR using total zebrafish RNA isolated
from 24 h old embryos and the following primers: forward primer: AAC GGT ACA CTG ACC CAA GC, reverse
primer: TAG TGC CTG GAT CCA CAC TG. The amplified
gli3 fragment was cloned directly using the Dual promoter
TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). DIG-labeled RNA
antisense probe was in-vitro transcribed with T7 RNA
polymerase. In situ hybridization was performed using in
vitro synthesized dygoxigenin-labeled antisense probes
on whole mount zebrafish embryos at stages indicated as
described [50].
RT PCR and real time RT PCR
The ACFP region was cut out from 3 days old embryos as
shown in Fig. 3 using etched tungsten micro-needles (Fine
Science Tools Germany) with 1 µm tip and 125 µm in
diameter. The dorsal fin fold region above the ACFP was
excised as a control (DFF). To obtain comparable amount
of tissue from the ACFP and DFF regions 150 samples of
ACFP and 30 DFF samples were collected. The collected
tissue samples were used directly for cDNA synthesis with
a SuperScript™ III CellsDirect cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Before the addition of the reverse transcriptase
enzyme (RT) a small aliquot (3 µl) was taken as a non RT
control. PCR amplification from shh smu and gfp cDNA
was carried out using 1 µl cDNA template from ACFP and
DFF samples with the following primer pairs: shh FP:

ABI Prism SDS 7000 machine (Applied Biosystems) using
ready SYBR Green mix (Qiagen). The results were analyzed with the manufacturer's software. The following

(normalized by β-actin amplification) 1 µl cDNA from
ACFP sample and 0.4 µl cDNA from DFF sample were
used as template for the real time PCR. Three technical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/75

repeats were carried out for each gene analyzed as well as
a no template control for each primer pair and a non rtcontrol for gfp. Whole caudal fin samples from three
developmental stages (2.5, 10 and 15 dpf) were collected
by cutting the tail fin approximately on the level of the
anterior end of the ACFP region, using micro-fine dissecting knife (Fine Science Tools – FST). To reduce the
amount of the non-cellular material in the fin samples
from the late stage larvae (15 dpf) the posterior part of the
fin rays were excised. In each RT PCR reaction 0.5 µl of the
cDNA samples were used.
Cyclopamine treatment
gfp+/- transgenic zebrafish embryos were placed individually in wells of 96-well tissue culture plates and treated at
the indicated stages and times with either 2% ethanol in
10% Hank's solution or with 200 µM cyclopamine (Biomol Int., No GR-334) dissolved in 2% ethanol, 10%
Hanks's solution. Incubation with cyclopamine was followed by washing in 10% Hank's and embryos were incubated until the time of GFP analysis as described.
Experiments were repeated independently 3 times and
images from one representative experiment are shown.
Cell transplantation
Transplant experiments were carried out essentially as
described in [51] with the following modifications.
Instead of biotin, 1 pl 1% fixable tetramethyl-rhodaminedextrane 3000 MW (Molecular Probes, D-3308) was
injected into 1–4 cell wt containing the gfp transgene and
smo-/- embryos containing the gfp transgene which were
left to develop till 30% epiboly. (Only embryos labeled
uniformly at this stage were used for the transplants.)
Embryos were then transferred into a dish where they
were held in pairs during and after the transplants. The
transplants were carried out between shield and 60% epiboly stage. Embryos that showed labeling on the ventral
side of the median finfold were sorted at 1 dpf (wt to wt,
wt to smu-/-, smu-/- to wt, smu-/- to smu-/-) and were left to
grow till 3 dpf. Embryos were then anaesthetized and
mounted in low melting point agarose and a Leica TCSNT
confocal microscope was used to obtain the images of
rhodamine labeling and GFP expression.
