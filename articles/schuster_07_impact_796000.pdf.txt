Abstract
Background: In fungi, light is primarily known to influence general morphogenesis and both sexual
and asexual sporulation. In order to expand the knowledge on the effect of light in fungi and to
determine the role of the light regulatory protein ENVOY in the implementation of this effect, we
performed a global screen for genes, which are specifically effected by light in the fungus Hypocrea
jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) using Rapid Subtraction Hybridization (RaSH). Based on
these data, we analyzed whether these genes are influenced by ENVOY and if overexpression of
ENVOY in darkness would be sufficient to execute its function.
Results: The cellular functions of the detected light responsive genes comprised a variety of roles
in transcription, translation, signal transduction, metabolism, and transport. Their response to light
with respect to the involvement of ENVOY could be classified as follows: (i) ENVOY-mediated
upregulation by light; (ii) ENVOY-independent upregulation by light; (iii) ENVOY-antagonized
upregulation by light; ENVOY-dependent repression by light; (iv) ENVOY-independent repression
by light; and (v) both positive and negative regulation by ENVOY of genes not responsive to light
in the wild-type. ENVOY was found to be crucial for normal growth in light on various carbon
sources and is not able to execute its regulatory function if overexpressed in the darkness.
Conclusion: The different responses indicate that light impacts fungi like H. jecorina at several
cellular processes, and that it has both positive and negative effects. The data also emphasize that
ENVOY has an apparently more widespread cellular role in this process than only in modulating
the response to light.

Background
Light is a fundamental abiotic factor and therefore represents a central environmental signal which influences not
only phototrophic but in fact rather the majority of living
organisms. Light is thereby sensed by chromophore-

binding proteins that act as photoreceptors, which transduce the signal to the expression of the genes involved in
the respective response [1,2]. In mitosporic fungi, light is
primarily known to stimulate morphogenetic functions
and processes of reproduction such as phototropism,

spore discharge, the development of sexual and asexual
structures [3,4], as well as pigmentation which protects
against the deleterious effects of UV-light [5,6]. The
molecular responses and mechanisms of adaptation to
light, especially with respect to circadian rhythmicity are
best documented in Neurospora crassa [7-9]. In this fungus,
all light-induced phenotypes are dependent on at least
one of the two regulators white-collar-1 (WC-1; [10]) or
white-collar-2 (WC-2; [11]). These two genes encode proteins, which contain a zinc finger domain and a PASdomain through which they interact physically to form
the "white collar complex [12]." The WC-1 protein also
functions as a blue light receptor via its LOV domain and
by its binding of an FAD flavin chromophore [13].
Idnurm and Heitman [14] have recently demonstrated
that orthologues of the WC-1/WC-2 proteins of N. crassa
are present in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, and thus
represent an evolutionary ancient conserved system for
the control of light-dependent processes.
The light perception system of N. crassa also comprises the
small PAS/LOV domain protein VIVID which is believed
to act as a modulator of the light response in N. crassa.
[15-17]. It is a member of the LOV-domain subfamily of
PER, ARNT and SIM (PAS)-domain proteins which mediate both ligand binding and protein-protein interactions
[18]. VIVID is capable of binding a flavin chromophore
[17,19,20]. It has been shown to be localized in the cytoplasm and influences the transient phosphorylation of
WC-1 [15,16,21]. The predominant influence of VVD is
on the speed with which a transcriptional response to
light decays. A loss of VVD causes the clock to be more
responsive to light and consequently, circadian gating –
the action of the clock to reduce the responses at certain
times of day – is muted without VVD [15].
While orthologues of WC-1 and WC-2 have been identified and characterized from various fungi [14], information about possible orthologues of VIVID in other
organisms is scarce. Only its orthologue in the ascomycete
Hypocrea jecorina, Envoy – which has a high similarity to
VIVID but is unable to replace it – has recently been characterized [22]. Comparably to N. crassa vvd, env1 shows a
fast and strong transcriptional response to illumination
on several carbon sources.
H. jecorina is well known to science because of the use of
its anamorph Trichoderma reesei as an industrial producer
of cellulases and hemicellulases [23-25]. The expression
of its cellulase genes depends on the presence of an
inducer such as cellulose, lactose, sophorose or L-sorbose,
but is otherwise independent of most other nutrients
except for a susceptibility of some – but not all of its –
genes to partial carbon catabolite repression [26]. Interestingly, however, light stimulates cellulase gene expression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/449

in H. jecorina, and this stimulation is regulated by ENVOY:
a mutant lacking the PAS-domain of ENVOY (env1) exhibits an altered cellulase gene transcription pattern both in
the presence and absence of light, thus showing that env1
is directly or indirectly impacting cbh1 gene expression in
the darkness [22]. In addition, the loss of the PAS-domain
of ENVOY led to an altered transcriptional response of the
truncated transcript of env1, thus suggesting a regulatory
feedback being operative.
Our detection of a light-dependence of cellulase gene
transcription of the PAS/LOV domain protein ENVOY
raised the question whether there would be more cellular
functions in fungi which are controlled by either light
and/or ENVOY. To address this question we have performed a genome wide screening for genes regulated by
the presence of light, using Rapid Subtraction Hybridization (RaSH). Genes thereby identified were investigated
for whether their response would be dependent on a functional env1 gene. We will show that light affects transcription of genes of H. jecorina both positively as well as
negatively, and that for both effects env1-independent variants are found. In addition, we will show that ENVOY
also acts as a light-independent repressor for several
genes, is crucial for normal growth in light on several carbon sources, but is not able to fully execute its regulatory
function when overexpressed in darkness. Our data suggest a function of ENVOY in coordination of the light signal with other environmental signals, which is
comparable to the gating function shown for VVD of
Neurospora crassa.

Results
Isolation of expressed sequence tags which are
differentially expressed in H. jecorina after transfer from
dark to illumination by light
We used mRNAs from H. jecorina QM 9414 pregrown in
the dark, and mRNAs from the same strain after subjection to illumination to screen for mRNAs which are more
abundant under the latter conditions and thus upregulated by light applying Rapid Subtraction Hybridization
[27]. To prevent missing transcripts with only transient
accumulation or slower response upon receipt of the light
pulse, mRNAs were isolated from mycelia after 15 and 30
min of incubation in light, and combined. As we applied
a relatively low stringency, we expected to be able to detect
not only genes which are absent during darkness but generally such genes which exhibit a different abundance
under these both conditions.

Consequently, 300 putatively positive ESTs were isolated
and tested by Reverse Northern blotting [27-29]. The
lengths of the respective cDNA sequences were 150 – 400
bp on an average. Based on the signal intensity on the
Reverse Northern Blot, 154 EST fragments which were

clearly differentially expressed between darkness and
illumination and which represented 24 different genes
were consecutively chosen for further investigation. As an
influence of light on signaling processes can be assumed,
additionally several genes involved in signal transduction
processes or response to stress were included in the
analysis (Table 1).
Since the Reverse Northern blot provides only preliminary
information (e.g. some plasmids could contain more than
one insert etc.), we assessed the response of expression of
all genes to light by Northern blotting. This investigation
proved that among the genes analyzed, 20 were indeed
significantly (> 40% change in signal intensity) upregulated upon illumination. Interestingly, four genes were
shown to be actually repressed by light, one of them representing a false positive result of RaSH regarding the aim
of the assay, while the others were three of the genes
which – because of their roles in signaling – were intentionally included in the analysis. Since we will present
these data in a broader context below, they are not given
at this place. For three genes neither significant light- nor
ENVOY dependent regulation was detected and therefore
they are not discussed further. We also noted that the fluctuations in transcript abundance, which were also seen
earlier with the light regulatory gene env1 upon cultivation after onset of illumination in minimal medium with
1% glycerol as carbon source [22] or N. crassa ccg-2 and
NC2B7 (see Figure 4A in [8]) also occur for many of the
genes investigated here.
Gene identification
In order to identify the genes corresponding to the ESTs
isolated, we used them to BLAST the Trichoderma reesei

genome database v2.0 and retrieved the corresponding
full length proteins and the correspondingly annotated
gene models. The protein sequences were checked for conserved domains using the NCBI CDD search to allow for
assigning a function to the respective gene (Table 2). In all
cases, the proteins were also blasted against the NCBI
database in order to identify the nearest neighbour of the
respective gene in Gibberella zeae (Fusarium graminearum),
Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Table 3).
Four of the 24 genes encoded hypothetical proteins,
which were also conserved in other fungi, but for which
no function could be assigned. Two genes (env1 and phr1)
encoded ENVOY and photolyase 1, respectively, which
have already been reported to be up-regulated by light
[22,30] and thus confirm the validity of our approach. A
high number of genes encoded proteins involved in
energy metabolism (i.e. NAD synthase tre9347, succinate
dehydrogenase tre20863, a major facilitator sugar transporter tre39397, IMP dehydrogenase tre42719) and protein synthesis (i.e. ribosomal protein L7 rpl7), indicating
that illumination results in increased respiratory energy
production. Other genes isolated are involved in stress
response, such as a toxin efflux pump of the major facilitator superfamily (tre10571), genes involved in protein
degradation (polyubiquitin ubi4, 4-hydroxibenzoatepolyprenyltransferase tre16112, dipeptidyl peptidase III
tre39031), nucleotide degradation (IMP pyrophosphatase
tre22454) and the thiazole biosynthetic enzyme thi4, the
homologue of which is upregulated under stress in Fusarium oxysporum [31,32]. Finally, genes related to early steps
in signal transduction (the mitogen activated protein
kinase tmk3, the cross pathway control protein cpc2)
were also upregulated by light. The remaining genes
encoded proteins of unclear function in the physiology of

H. jecorina, such as a predicted porphyromonas-type
peptidyl-arginine deimidase (tre45629) which causes citrulinylation of proteins, and a putative CAP20 virulence
related protein tre41865, an orthologue of which is
involved in appressorium formation and virulence in
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides [33].
Light-dependent upregulation of gene expression can
occur in env1-dependent, env1-independent, and
env1-antagonized ways
Having identified a reasonable set of genes which were
found to be upregulated in H. jecorina by light, we now
investigated whether they would indeed require the function of env1 for this purpose. To this end, we compared
the expression profile of these genes in H. jecorina QM
9414 to that of the env1PAS- strain over a period of 240
min. This strain lacks the PAS-domain of the light regulatory protein ENVOY and shows altered response to light
as well as a considerably decreased light tolerance [22].
The corresponding results showed that ENVOY appears to
play in fact at least three different roles in light regulation:
eleven of the genes (tre16112, tre20683, tre39397,
tre9347, tre22454, cpc2, phr1, tmk3, tre39031, tre40105,
and tre42719) showed a behaviour which was consistent
with the default expectation: a transient upregulation by
light, which was not seen in the env1PAS- strain and therefore at least partially regulated env1 (Fig. 1A), because a
response to light nevertheless occurred indicating further
light dependent regulators being operative.

In contrast, five genes (rpl7, tre22667, tre35050, tre45629
and tre72859), while also showing this upregulation by
light, did so also in the env1PAS- mutant. Despite the fact
that ENVOY seems to be involved in their regulation due
to the altered transcription pattern in env1PAS-their
response to light by increased transcription is not exclusively dependent on ENVOY (Fig. 1B).
In addition, three other genes (ubi4, tre10571, tre41025)
also exhibited significant upregulation of gene expression
upon exposure to light, but this upregulation was even
stronger in the env1PAS- mutant, indicating that ENVOY
antagonizes this activation in the wild-type strain
(Fig. 1C). Since this enhanced transcription in the mutant
strain also occurs in darkness with ubi4 and tre41025,

these genes seem to be subject to a general repression by
ENVOY.
Light repression of gene expression can occur in
env1-dependent and env1-independent manners
Four genes were noted, whose mRNA abundance
decreased upon exposure to light: gph1, tre34179,
tre37417 and tre41865. Interestingly, their dependence on
env1 showed a different influence: expression of tre37417
was not significantly regulated by light in the env1PASmutant, and that of gph1, tre34179 and tre41685, which
intrinsically represents a false positive result with respect
to the aim of the study, decreased (Fig. 2). These data show
that ENVOY can also act as an antagonist of the negative
effect of light on gene expression. Moreover, obviously
there is – as expected – also an additional, env1-independent, pathway of light regulation of gene expression.
env1 also regulates expression of genes which do not
respond to light
Among the genes analyzed, five genes showed only a
minor response (below ± 40% of control) to the presence
of light (cpc1, thi4, hac1, tre31929). Among them thi4 was
found to be significantly up-regulated in the env1PASstrain indicating repression by ENVOY. The other three
exhibited significantly lower transcript abundance in the
env1PAS- strain and thus are apparently dependent on a
function of env1, which is not directly related to light
response (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, we did not observe an
alteration in transcript length of hac1 [34] after illumination or due to the lack of a functional ENVOY, what would
indicate onset of unfolded protein response due to
enhancement of hac1 translation after splicing of an
intron and alteration of the open reading frame [34].
Regulatory elements putatively responsible for light
response
In order to investigate the significance of certain promoter
elements in regulation of light response and as targets of
envoy-mediated regulation we analyzed 1000 bp of the
upstream regions of the genes described in this study
(Table 4). Therefore we selected motifs which have been
described to play a role in light dependent gene regulation
or for which such a function could be expected. EUM1
and EUM2 have been identified in the promoters of the

Northern analysis of light- and env1-responsive genes. Strains were grown on Mandels Andreotti minimal medium with
1% (w/v) glycerol as carbon source for 24 h in darkness (DD) and harvested after the indicated time (DL) of illumination (1800
lux, 25 μmol photons m-2s-1). A representative hybridization with 18S rRNA for every set of Northerns is given below the
respective series. Transcript abundance is given below the blots and was measured for wild-type QM9414 (Q) and env1PAS- by
densitometry to verify up-regulation until 60 min of illumination, related to 18S rRNA and normalized to the dark control of
the wild-type strain (QM9414, 24 h, DD). If no transcript was detected in QM9414 in darkness, the values represent signal
strength above background. (A) Transcription of genes upregulated by light but not in the env1PAS- strain. (B) Transcription of

promoters of those genes which are not responsive to

phenotype of env1PAS- shows a severe perturbation of
growth during adaptation to light, which could indicate a
role of env1 in light-dependent stress management. On
the other hand, the GATA-sequence is underrepresented
for genes upregulated in the env1PAS- mutant. For all other
sequence motifs no connection to a specific env1-related
function or light response in general could be supported.
This could at least in part be due to the fact that we cannot
distinguish between direct and indirect influences of env1,
since because of the lack of a known DNA-binding
domain in ENVOY its effect is likely to be executed via

protein-protein interaction with one or more transcription factors. Also, it seems possible that the response to
light is not exclusively dependent on one specific transcription factor and that the modulating function seen for
many genes of this study might be performed via factors
at a different level in the signal transduction cascade.
Stimulation of growth on various carbon sources by light
and ENVOY
Because of the up-regulation of energy metabolism by
light in dependency of env1, we wondered whether this
behaviour would also be reflected in an enhanced growth
rate. We have therefore measured the growth rates of H.
jecorina QM 9414 and the mutant strain env1PAS- in light
and in the dark on those carbon sources which enable
highest growth rates by the parent strain [40]. The data,
presented in Fig. 5, show that H. jecorina indeed grows
faster on many of them in the presence of light, although
to a variable degree. This enhanced growth rate was
dependent on ENVOY, since no such stimulation was
observed in the mutant strain env1PAS-. In fact, with the
exception of growth on γ-aminobutyric acid, its growth
rate was always lower in light than in the dark. When the
data are compared between the two strains only in light
and only in darkness (= i.e. the relative changes on the xand y-axes are considered), it is evident that the two
strains differ significantly stronger along the y-axes, thus
indicating that light inhibits growth of strain env1PAS-. On
the other hand, growth in darkness (with the exception of
glycerol) was only very little affected (= both strains occur
at similar positions at the x-axes). In the case of utilization
of glycogen, whose position in the graph indicates light
inhibition in the mutant strain, the results are in perfect
agreement with the expression of gph1 (encoding a glycogen phosphorylase; see above Figure 1A): in the wild type
strain, only a slight decrease in transcript abundance is
observed in light as compared to darkness, but a more
strongly decreased mRNA level is observed in the mutant
strain env1PAS- in light. These data are indicative of an
env1-dependent enhancement of energy metabolism and
thus biomass formation by light, and a negative effect of
light on H. jecorina in the absence of functional ENVOY.
It is thereby intriguing to note that this inhibition by light
in the mutant strain env1PAS- was not observed on all carbon sources (e.g. growth rates were similar on D-arabitol
and glycerol, and on γ-aminobutyrate growth was even
stimulated by light). The inhibitory effect of light in the
absence of ENVOY is therefore carbon source dependent.
Up-regulation of env1 is not sufficient for regulation of its
target genes in darkness
In order to find out whether up-regulation of env1 would
be sufficient to induce transcription of its target genes in
darkness, we introduced the env1 open reading frame
under the control of the inducible N. crassa qa2-promoter

Figure 4 promoter motifs present in light- and/or env1-responsive genes
Analysis of
Analysis of promoter motifs present in light- and/or env1-responsive genes. (A) Alignment of LRE-motifs; the extension of the motifs was limited to 50 bp, only true LRE motifs comprising the GATNC – CGATN consensus with N being the
same nucleotide in both repeats were included. (B) Distribution of the respective promoter motifs among the regulatory characteristics of ENVOY as determined by Northern analysis (Figures 1 – 3). The total number of motifs present in one group was
related to the number of genes of this group. A: genes upregulated by light but not in the env1PAS- strain; B: genes upregulated
both by light and in the env1PAS- strain; C: genes upregulated by light, which show increased upregulation in the env1PAS- strain;
D: genes showing decreased transcription upon illumination; E: genes lacking response to light, but whose transcription is
impacted by env1.

Northern analysis of ENVOY overexpressing strains.
Strains were grown on Mandels Andreotti minimal medium
with 1% (w/v) glycerol as carbon source in constant darkness
and transcription of env1 in 4env1qa+ was induced by adding
quinic acid to a final concentration of 0.6%. The parent strain
QM9414 was used as control and treated equally. Mycelia
were harvested after 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 hours in darkness.

Light stimulation of growth of H. jecorina on selected
carbon sources, and the impact of ENVOY. Biomass
formation of wild-type strain QM9414 (open circles) or
env1PAS- (full diamonds) has been analyzed by the BIOLOG
microplate assay. Biomass equivalents (OD750) after 72 hrs of
growth are given. This time was chosen because then both
strains were still in the phase of active growth on all carbon
sources tested. The y-axes shows values obtained under constant light of 1800 lux, whereas the x-axes shows those
obtained in constant darkness. Consequently, carbon sources
on which no difference between growth in light or darkness
occurs lie on the border between the shaded area (indicating
light stimulation) and the open area (light inhibition). The
two lines indicate the mean values for all carbon sources. All
experiments were done in triplicates, standard deviation is

into the H. jecorina parent strain QM9414, resulting in
strain 4env1qa+. Strains were grown in constant darkness
and expression of env1 was induced by addition of quinic
acid to the parent strain and the env1-overexpressing
strain. After quinate addition, induction of env1 transcription could be demonstrated (Figure 6). To elucidate
whether this upregulation is sufficient for the expression
of light induced, env1 dependent genes, we chose the phr1
gene encoding photolyase 1 as a model. Despite the

strong transcription of env1 in the ENV1 overexpressing
strains, no transcript indicating up-regulation of phr1 in
darkness could be detected in these strains after addition
of quinic acid (data not shown). Thus, despite the effect of
the lack of functional ENVOY on transcription of phr1,
overexpression of ENVOY is not sufficient for upregulation of phr1 in the darkness.
As a second model case, we wanted to test whether expression of env1 would be sufficient for the up-regulation of
tre39031 in darkness and if the effect of the mutation of
env1 in env1PAS- (i.e. detectable transcript in darkness and
decreased transcript levels in light; figure 1A) could be
reversed by overexpression of env1 in constant darkness.
Also in this case no transcript of tre39031 was detected in
darkness and after induction of env1-transcription by
quinic acid (data not shown). These results are in agreement with the assumption that ENV1 does not directly
regulate the transcription of its target genes (at least not
generally), but executes its function indirectly by interaction with transcriptional regulators, which are not available or inactive in darkness.

Discussion
In this study, we used RaSH to isolate early light-responding genes from H. jecorina, which led to the identification
of a total of 20 genes which were upregulated and 4 which
were downregulated shortly after illumination. In

addition, several of these genes were differentially effected
by a mutation in the light regulatory protein ENVOY [22],
whose closest neighbour N. crassa VIVID, is known to be
a photoreceptor [17]. Besides ENVOY, VIVID is the only
characterized PAS-domain protein of this type in fungi to
date. To put the data obtained in this study in a genomic
perspective: Rosales-Saveedra et al.[41] have recently used
microarrays containing approximately one fifth of the
genome of Hypocrea atroviridis (anamorph Trichoderma
atroviride) for the screening of genes regulated by light,
and identified 30 genes to be upregulated. This corresponds to 2.8% of the genes contained in the array used,
and compares well to a value of 3% obtained for a similar
study in N. crassa [8]. Only two of the genes which were
found to be upregulated by blue light in H. atroviridis [41]
were also upregulated in N. crassa [8], which may be
explained by a significant difference in the physiology of
these two fungi and the long phylogenetic distance
between Neurospora and Hypocrea/Trichoderma spp. [42]. It
is therefore interesting to note that only one of the genes
(photolyase phr1) identified in this study was also found
by Rosales-Saveedra et al. [41], although H. jecorina and
H. atroviridis belong to the same fungal genus. The authors
mentioned unpublished data that "several of the genes
identified by them were also light upregulated in H. jecorina." This difference may be due to the missing of 80% of
the genome in this study. On the contrary, the method of
subtraction hybridization used in our study includes the
whole transcriptome of the respective conditions to be
compared, but from our experience also yields only a subset of all genes regulated under the conditions of interest.
Hence we consider the present study complementary to
that of Rosales Saveedra et al.[41]. Yet another explanation for the difference in the set of genes which were
found to respond to light in these two fungi could be the
fact that the ENVOY-homologue of H. atroviridis may not
be functional: this assumption is supported by the following findings: first, its N-terminus is truncated at amino
acids 1–6; second, it contains two upstream open reading
frames close to the ATG (M. Schmoll, unpublished),
which can profoundly influence the translation of the
main ORF [43]. Finally, we could not detect the transcript
of H. atroviridis env1 under several conditions where env1
is strongly transcribed in H. jecorina (data not shown).
Taken together, this could reflect a different light regulatory machinery in these two closely related fungi.
Genes, which were actually upregulated by light and
which required ENVOY for this process to function properly were the largest sample detected in this study (11
genes). One of them was the photolyase gene phr1, which
has also been isolated from H. atroviridis, and which plays
a role in the protection of genes against UV-light by photoreactivation of cyclobutan dimers of the pyrimidine
nucleotides [44]. Rosales-Saveedra et al. [41] also reported

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/449

the identification of a gene (blu3), which encodes a protein with an endonuclease III-type domain and which
could function in excision repair. This gene was not identified in this study. However, another gene identified in
this study (tre22454) encodes an ITP triphosphatepyrophosphatase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation
of IMP and XMP, which accumulate as a result of cellular
degradation of nucleotides which were modified by oxidative stress [46]. These data indicate that the early light
response of H. jecorina involves reactions both against UVlight as well as oxidative stress. This is supported by the
upregulation of tre42719 (encoding IMP dehydrogenase,
an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotide
phosphates). Yoshida et al. [47] have shown that exposure
of N. crassa to light evokes an oxidative stress response, in
which nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 plays a essential
role e.g. by associating with a G-protein &-subunit for
transmission of the light signal [48]. Finally, an increased
demand for protection of the cell against a major threat is
also evident from the upregulation of genes encoding
components of cellular protein turnover such as tre16112
(a prenyltransferase required for ubiquitin biosynthesis),
tre39031 (encoding a dipeptidyl peptidase III), and ubi4
(encoding polyubiquitin). The upregulation of an MSF
toxin efflux pump (tre10571) with homology to proteins
providing tolerance against fungicides in Botrytinia fuckeliana (DHA14 like major facilitator protein, AAF64435, Evalue 3E-130; [49,50]) and Mycosphaerella graminicola
(Mfs1, ABG57045, E-value 5E-127; [51]) upon illumination raises an intriguing question: is this defense-mechanism predominantly active in the presence of light i. e.
during the day? If so, the efficiency of fungicides could be
increased by carefully timing their application. However,
we do not yet know whether the light regulation of this
efflux pump also occurs in plant pathogenic fungi. In
agreement with H. atroviridis [41], several of the genes
which are upregulated by light encode genes involved in
energy metabolism (tre9347, NAD synthase; tre20863,
succinate dehydrogenase; tre39397, glucose transport),
and regulation of all of them was influenced by env1. This
is reminiscent of the findings by Kolarova et al.[52] that
exposure of T. viride to light leads to increments in ATP
levels and respiratory activity. Although this increased
energy production could be required for the onset of photoconidiation upon exposition to light, this explanation is
rather not applicable to H. jecorina, because this fungus
does not need illumination for the induction of formation of conidia, and conidiates well in darkness. The
detection of several genes involved in protein turnover to
be responsive to light rather suggests that this enhanced
energy demand reflects the physiological change in gene
expression which is needed to adapt to light.
One light-responsive but not env1-dependent gene shows
intriguing characteristics – tre45629: although the primary

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:449

structure of the encoded protein is only poorly conserved,
it contains all the signature sequences of a peptidyl
arginine deiminase, an enzyme which converts arginine
residues in proteins to citrulline, thereby altering the positive charge and hence the proteins ability to interact with
other proteins and membranes. To the best of our knowledge, the role of this deimination has not yet been investigated in fungi. Moscarello et al.[53] have recently
proposed that citrullinylation of myeline basic protein
from brain is an important event in the pathogenesis of
multiple sclerosis.
Another interesting finding was the detection that the cross
pathway control protein CPC2 is regulated by light. Cross
pathway control (CPC) of amino acid biosynthetic pathways is activated during amino acid starvation and also
controls sexual development in A. nidulans. This activation
is executed by the transcription factor CPC1/CPCA. In the
presence of amino acids the pathway is repressed by the
transcription factor CPC2/CPCB [54]. We therefore tested
whether H. jecorina cpc1 would also respond to light. Interestingly, cpc1 did not respond to light, but is influenced by
the presence of ENVOY. Thus, in Hypocrea jecorina the
repressing factor is regulated by light but the activating factor is modulated by ENVOY. The coregulation of cpc1 and
hac1 by ENVOY is also interesting in the context that Gcn4p
(the S. cerevisiae orthologue of CPC1) is involved in the
unfolded protein response [55], and that CPC1 was found
to be upregulated during UPR in H. jecorina [56]. This suggests that ENVOY may be involved in the control of UPR.
Envoy – and particularly its putative counterpart in N.
crassa, VIVID – have been described as proteins modulating the cellular response to light. However, we have
shown here that this is only one of several roles which
ENVOY apparently plays. Only eleven of the nineteen
genes upregulated by light needed the function of env1 for
this process. Five other genes showed an upregulation by
light independently of env1, and in three genes the lightdependent upregulation was even stimulated in an env1negative background. The nature of the proteins encoded
by these genes did not yet provide us with an explanation
for the specific role of these env1-independent and env1repressed upregulations.
The results of this study point at an involvement of Envoy
in the regulation of various cellular processes. Although
based on this study we cannot differentiate between direct
and indirect influences of ENVOY, it is obvious that this
protein plays an important regulatory role at a central
junction of signaling pathways. The finding that ENVOY
is at least in some cases – as exemplified by the influence
on phr1 and tre39031 – not able to execute its lightdependent function in darkness suggests that the presence
of its putative interaction partners is required for a proper

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/449

function of this regulatory mechanism. Similarly, also for
N. crassa White collar-1 (WC-1) Lewis et al.[8] showed,
that increased levels of WC-1 in darkness are not sufficient
to activate all aspects of the phototransduction pathway.
Since ENVOY comprises no known DNA-binding
domain, it likely does not directly bind to DNA, and
therefore executes its function via interaction with downstream regulatory proteins targeting the respective pathways. Thereby it could interact with either positive as well
as negative regulatory factors, which would explain its
positive and negative influences as shown in this paper.
This interaction could also be influenced by the phosphorylation state of the casein kinase II phosphorylation sites
in ENVOY (M. Schmoll, unpublished), and/or binding of
the ligands to the PAS-domain of ENVOY. Since PAS
domains are well known to be able to bind different ligands [57], ENVOY could thus execute its regulatory function both at a qualitative (conformational change due to
bound ligand) and quantitative (expression efficiency)
level. While the well characterized photoreceptors BLR1
and BLR2 (putatively as BLR1–BLR2 photoreceptor-complex) are predicted to mediate the reception of the light
signal, this study reveals that ENVOY is involved in the
conditional adaptation to light, because lack of functional
ENVOY does not result in blindness but leads to an
altered gene expression pattern of light-regulated genes.
Such a function would well correspond with the finding
of a gating function for the N. crassa orthologue VIVID
[15]. In other words, Envoy most likely determines the
significance of the light signal for a given cellular process
under the current environmental conditions.

Conclusion
The different responses to light, as demonstrated in this
study, stress that light plays a role in several cellular processes of fungi, thereby displaying both positive and negative effects. Our data also emphasize that ENVOY has an
apparently more widespread cellular role in this process
than only in modulating the response to light. The importance of such a coordinator becomes apparent when it is
considered that sunlight causes subsequent changes such
as a rise in temperatures, decrease in humidity, and
increase in UV light intensity. The adaptation to these
environmental cues is of crucial importance in the evolution of every organism.

Methods
Microbial strains and culture conditions
The H. jecorina (T. reesei) wild-type strain QM9414 (ATCC
26921) and the env1 recombinant mutant lacking the
PAS-domain (env1PAS-[22]) were used throughout this
study. H. jecorina was grown in liquid culture in 1-L Erlenmeyer flasks on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 28°C in 200
ml of medium as described by [58] with 1% (w/v) glycerol
as sole carbon source using 108 conidia/L (final

concentration) as inoculum in constant darkness and
harvested with red safety light or after the time of illumination (1800 lux; 25 μmol photons m-2 s-1) as indicated
with the figures. Cultivations of wild-type and mutant
strain were done in parallel to ensure equal conditions.
E. coli JM109 [59] was used for the propagation of vector
molecules and DNA manipulations.
Preparation of PCR-Based cDNA Libraries
The experiment was performed essentially as described by
Schmoll et al.[60] according to the RaSH method as published by [27]. For the driver cDNA mycelia were grown in
constant darkness on minimal medium as described
above for 24 hours, tester cDNA was prepared from mycelia exposed to light for 15 and 30 minutes and pooled.
Reverse Northern Hybridization
For the Reverse Northern Hybridization, PCR products
were loaded onto duplicate agarose gels and blotted with
0.4 N NaOH onto Hybond N membranes (Pall, New
York, USA). Hybridization was performed using 2.5 μg of
PCR amplified and subsequently radioactively labeled
cDNA from tester or driver, respectively, as probes after
EcoRII digestion and purification. The candidates for a
more detailed analysis were chosen by visual inspection
first, then this decision was cross-checked by quantitative
measurements using the BIORAD Geldoc Imaging system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, US) and BIORAD Quantity One software, both for three different expositions of
the blot.
Nucleic acid isolation and hybridization
Fungal mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed with
tap water, frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen. For
extraction of DNA, mycelial powder was suspended in
buffer A (1.2 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH
8.0), incubated for 20 min at 65°C, cooled down on ice,
mixed with 1 vol. phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol
49:49:2 (v/v/v) and centrifuged (21000 g, 15 min). Following an extraction with 1 vol. of chloroform:isoamylalcohol 24:1 (v/v), the DNA was precipitated with 1 vol. of
isopropanol and washed with 70% (v/v) ethanol. Total
RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate
method [60,61]. Standard methods [62] were used for
electrophoresis, blotting and hybridization of nucleic
acids. The transcription pattern of env1 [22] under the
respective conditions was used as a control hybridization
for appropriate conditions with every cultivation. In case
of unclear results or small signal differences, the hybridizations were repeated with samples from different,
independent cultivations.

Normalization of gene expression was performed according to the following formula:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/449

{(transcript abundance of gene x at time point)/
(transcript abundance of gene x in wild-type in darkness)}/{(control 18SrRNA, time point)/(18S rRNA wildtype, darkness)}. The quantitative measurements were
performed using the BIORAD Geldoc Imaging system and
BIORAD Quantity One software from different expositions of the respective film. For every set of Northern blots
one 18S rRNA hybridization was included as a loading
and blotting control and used for quantification of the
respective films.
Sequence analysis and identification
The most promising candidates for light responsive genes
showing clear differential transcription in the Reverse
Northern Blot were selected for sequencing. PCR products
as used for reverse Northern blotting were sequenced
using primer RaSH1R, which binds within pBluescript
immediately upstream of the inserts to be analyzed [60].
The respective sequences were used for BLASTX searches
of the T. reesei genome database v2.0 [63]. For the genes
identified thereby, protein sequences as provided by this
database were used for a search for conserved domains in
CDD [64,65] and for the nearest neighbour with NCBI
Blastp [66,66,68]. If an E-value below 1E-30 for the Blastp
result or 1E-10 for the result of the CDD search was
obtained for a certain gene, the result was considered to
assign a putative function. 1000 bp of the promoter
sequence upstream of the first ATG of the respective open
reading frame as predicted in the genome database were
analyzed for known regulatory motifs.
Biolog Phenotype Array analysis
Growth rates on selected carbon sources were investigated
by means of the Biolog FF MicroPlate™ assay (Biolog Inc.,
Hayward, CA) as described by Druzhinina et al.[40]. Inoculated microplates were incubated in constant light (1800
lux, 25 μmol photons m-2 s-1) or in the dark at 28°C, and
percent absorbance at 750 nm determined in 12 h intervals between 36 and 72 h. Analyses were repeated at least
three times for each strain.
Construction of strains overexpressing env1
For inducible expression of ENV1 we introduced the open
reading frame of env1 into the SmaI-site of the vector
pmyx2 [69], resulting in env1 being under the control of
the N. crassa qa-2 promoter which can be induced by addition of quinic acid to the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.6%. The resulting construct was transformed
into the wild-type strain QM9414. Two positive strains
were selected by PCR screening and Southern blotting, pregrown for 24 h on 1% (w/v) glycerol in darkness before
adding quinic acid and transcript abundance was analyzed
at several time points after addition of quinic acid in constant darkness. The wild-type strain was used as a control
in parallel to those strains and was treated equally.
