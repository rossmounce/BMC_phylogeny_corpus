Abstract
Background: Using phylogenetic approaches, the expectation that parallel cladogenesis should
occur between parasites and hosts has been validated in some studies, but most others provided
evidence for frequent host shifts. Here we examine the evolutionary history of the association
between Microbotryum fungi that cause anther smut disease and their Caryophyllaceous hosts. We
investigated the congruence between host and parasite phylogenies, inferred cospeciation events
and host shifts, and assessed whether geography or plant ecology could have facilitated the putative
host shifts identified.
For cophylogeny analyses on microorganisms, parasite strains isolated from different host species
are generally considered to represent independent evolutionary lineages, often without checking
whether some strains actually belong to the same generalist species. Such an approach may mistake
intraspecific nodes for speciation events and thus bias the results of cophylogeny analyses if
generalist species are found on closely related hosts. A second aim of this study was therefore to
evaluate the impact of species delimitation on the inferences of cospeciation.
Results: We inferred a multiple gene phylogeny of anther smut strains from 21 host plants from
several geographic origins, complementing a previous study on the delimitation of fungal species
and their host specificities. We also inferred a multi-gene phylogeny of their host plants, and the
two phylogenies were compared. A significant level of cospeciation was found when each host
species was considered to harbour a specific parasite strain, i.e. when generalist parasite species
were not recognized as such. This approach overestimated the frequency of cocladogenesis
because individual parasite species capable of infecting multiple host species (i.e. generalists) were
found on closely related hosts. When generalist parasite species were appropriately delimited and

only a single representative of each species was retained, cospeciation events were not more
frequent than expected under a random distribution, and many host shifts were inferred.
Current geographic distributions of host species seemed to be of little relevance for understanding
the putative historical host shifts, because most fungal species had overlapping geographic ranges.
We did detect some ecological similarities, including shared pollinators and habitat types, between
host species that were diseased by closely related anther smut species. Overall, genetic similarity
underlying the host-parasite interactions appeared to have the most important influence on
specialization and host-shifts: generalist multi-host parasite species were found on closely related
plant species, and related species in the Microbotryum phylogeny were associated with members of
the same host clade.
Conclusion: We showed here that Microbotryum species have evolved through frequent host
shifts to moderately distant hosts, and we show further that accurate delimitation of parasite
species is essential for interpreting cophylogeny studies.

Background
Host-specific differentiation of parasites, also referred to
as specialization, may arise as a consequence of limited
dispersal or adaptive constraints [1]. Some parasite species or lineages may indeed have evolved a restricted host
range simply because they have not come in contact with
other host species, for instance when these occur in allopatry. Alternatively, host specificity may arise because of
adaptive specialization [2], where trade-offs or fitness
costs of being generalist parasites can lead to host-specific
differentiation even in sympatry [1-4].
Host specificity is often expected to lead to cospeciation,
i.e. parasite speciation tracking that of the host. For inferring whether cospeciation has occurred, one usually compares host and parasite phylogenies. Cospeciation yields
congruent phylogenies (i.e. parallel cladogenesis), as has
been previously illustrated, for example in the cases of
animal hosts and parasitic lice [5] and of some mutualist
associations [6,7]. In contrast, the colonization of new
hosts, either followed by parasite speciation (host shift) or
not ('failure to speciate' [8]), generally decreases phylogenetic congruence [9,10]. Additional processes are also
expected to reduce the congruence between host and parasite phylogenies, such as species extinctions [5] and
duplications (i.e. speciation of the parasite in absence of
host speciation).
Several recent studies comparing the phylogenies of
highly specific parasites and their hosts revealed widespread incongruence [9,11-14], showing that apparently
strict host specificity is not sufficient to impede host shifts
over the long term. In cases of host shifts, colonization is
expected to be most likely between geographically overlapping hosts. The probability of the parasite being able to
develop on a new host may also be influenced by the
degree to which the new host shares chemical, physiological and ecological characters with the original host. Inves-

tigating geographical and ecological similarities between
hosts can therefore help reconstructing evolutionary history of host shifts.
In addition, if related parasites more easily infect hosts
with similar ecologies and if chemical, physiological and
ecological characters in part covary with phylogeny, false
conclusions can arise from cophylogeny analyses. In the
first place, host shifts will preferentially occur between
phylogenetically closely related hosts [15], which can generate similar degrees of congruence between parasite and
host phylogenies as would cospeciation [16]. Second,
generalist parasites that can infect several host species are
likely to be found on closely related host species, either
because these generalist species are the result of a lack of
parasite speciation following host speciation or of host
range expansion among phylogenetically close hosts that
share biochemical and ecological characteristics. If generalist species are not recognized as such, intraspecific nodes
in parasite phylogenies may be mistaken for speciation
events and then misinterpreted as cospeciation events if
the generalist parasites infect sister host species. This latter
potential pitfall in cophylogeny analyses has not been
investigated yet to our knowledge.
The anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum (Pers.:
Pers) Deml & Oberw. (= Ustilago violacea (Pers.) Fuckel)
(Basidiomycota: Pucciniomycotina, Microbotryaceae) is
an obligate parasite on many Caryophyllaceae. It has been
recorded on 92 plant species in Europe and on 21 plant
species in North America [17]. The Caryophyllaceae –
Microbotryum pathosystem is a model in many fields of
evolutionary biology [18-20]. In diseased plants, diploid
teliospores of M. violaceum replace pollen in the anthers,
and are dispersed by insect visitors. Host specific divergence of M. violaceum has been of debate for about a century. Spore color [21], mating behavior [21],
morphological differences [22], and cross-inoculation

experiments [23,24], all suggested that M. violaceum
strains found on different host species were at least partially differentiated. More recently, genetic analyses of M.
violaceum populations from many hosts have revealed
strong genetic differentiation [25-28]. Finally, an
approach using multiple gene phylogenies has firmly
established that most host races of M. violaceum represent
multiple independent evolutionary lineages, highly specialized on a single or a few host species [29]. Microbotryum violaceum is thus a complex of more than fifteen true
sibling species, showing a strong post-zygotic isolation
[30].
The host family, Caryophyllaceae, has a global distribution with highest diversity in the holarctic, but also high
diversity in the Mediterranean and Irano-Turanean region
[31]. The majority of the approximately 2,200 species of
the family are heliophytes occurring in dry, open habitats.
Some species are restricted to mountainous regions and
the family is totally absent from lowland rain forests [31].
Microbotryum violaceum commonly causes disease on species from two subfamilies of the Caryophyllaceae, the
Alsinoideae and the Caryophylloideae, and is most prevalent on perennials [17]. The systematics of the Caryophyllaceae still mainly relies on morphological characters
although there have been recent efforts to reconstruct the
phylogenetic relationship among genera based on molecular data [32-34]. This is unfortunately insufficient for
addressing questions on the Caryophyllaceae – Microbotryum association.
The goals of this paper are to reconstruct the evolutionary
history of associations between the Microbotryum anther
smut fungi and their Caryophyllaceae hosts and to test the
effect of parasite species delimitation on cophylogeny
analyses. We addressed the following questions:
1) What is the evidence for cospeciation and/or host shifts
in this system?
2) Does delimitation of cryptic fungal species influence
the results of cophylogeny analyses?

3) Do host shifts occur preferentially onto phylogenetically close hosts?
4) Does geography explain parasite similarity?
5) Do ecological factors, such as pollinator spectra or
plant habitat, influence host shifts?

Results
Host phylogeny
The topologies of the host phylogenetic trees based on the
ITS, intron trnL and spacer trnLF sequences showed no significant incongruence neither when assessed via an
Approximately Unbiased (AU) tests (Table 1) nor when
inspected by eye (see Methods for details). A tree was
therefore constructed using the concatenated loci (Fig. 1).
This tree adds support to the monophyly of the genera
Dianthus, Saponaria, and Lychnis, as previously reported
for a smaller set of species [33,35]. Within Silene, we identified two highly supported clades, that we named Silene
type I and Silene type II.
Smut phylogenies and identification of phylogenetic
species
Our current findings lend additional support for the existence of a number of cryptic Microbotryum species, each
specific to one or a few host species [29]. As before, the
species status of the various clades rests on the congruence
of the phylogenetic relationships of many strains inferred
from the three fungal genes analyzed (Additional file 1, 2
and 3; see Methods for details on the inference of phylogenetic species). This congruence is only not met for the
clade formed by the strains collected from S. acaulis as
observed previously [29]. For these strains the γ-tub phylogeny differs from the two other single gene phylogenies
(see AU tests in Table 2). The two placements of this lineage being basal, this incongruence is probably due to an
ancient introgression or hybridization [29]. Without the
S. acaulis strains there was no remaining incongruence: all
supported nodes were identical in the three gene trees. We
therefore concatenated the three genes in a dataset without the S. acaulis strains, yielding the same tree topology

as in the individual phylogenies but with higher support
for some nodes (Fig. 2).
In addition to the cryptic species identified previously
[29], three new phylogenetic species could be inferred
from the strains analyzed in this study, respectively on L.
flos-jovis, on Saponaria officinalis, and on S. otites (see
Fig. 2 for species nomenclature extended from ref. [29]).
We had access to only a single strain from S. lemmonii
and Stellaria sp. plants, so we could not infer the existence
of specific fungal phylogenetic species on these hosts.
However, because these strains were both strongly separated from other identified phylogenetic species in their
respective clades and because they were isolated from
phylogenetically or geographically very distant hosts, we
nevertheless considered them as separate lineages in the
comparison of host and fungal phylogenies below. For
Stellaria, this choice is in agreement with an ITS phylogeny supporting the monophyly of several strains collected
from this genus with the same phylogenetic placement as
ours [28].
On the 21 host species screened in the end we identified a
total of 15 parasite species (Fig. 2). Most of them appeared
specific to a single host species. For both Atocion rupestris
(previously Silene rupestris [36]) and Saponaria ocymoides
the two strains analyzed belonged to different fungal species. Because these hosts are seldom infected (pers. obs.)
we suspect that we picked up transient opportunistic
infections, so we did not consider these plant species as
true hosts of the corresponding fungal species. The fungal
species identified on the Dianthus species and on Gypsophila repens appeared generalist, i.e. able to infect several
host species. Speciation on these hosts may alternatively
be too recent to have allowed for sufficient molecular
divergence for us to detect.
For some of the subsequent analyses (TreeMap, TreeFitter,
Icong, see below and Methods), all nodes must be
resolved. In that case, we used a previous study that
obtained high supports to resolve one of our polytomies
[33] (see symbol * on Figs. 3 and 4). For the remaining

polytomies, we considered several alternative topologies
(see legend of Tables 3, 4 and 5 for details and nomenclature) including the branch of the fungal species on S. acaulis for parasite phylogeny at the two alternative
placements.
Comparison of plant and fungal phylogenies
We used two approaches for comparing host and parasite
phylogenies: the more conventional one considered as a
separate taxon the parasite strains from different host species such that generalist species were represented by as
many terminal branches as host species on which they
occurred (Fig. 3), while the second approach compared
species phylogenies (retaining a single representative per
fungal species) (Fig. 4). In both cases, some broad-scale
congruence between the host and parasite phylogenies
appears by visual inspection (the fungal phylogenetic species infecting the Dianthus and the Saponaria are monophyletic, as are the plants) while fine-scale congruence
between the host and parasite phylogenies is weak, in particular among the parasites of Silene. However methodological analyses reconstructed different evolutionary
histories for Microbotryum-Caryophyllaceae association
depending on which approach was chosen.

When considering as a separate taxon the parasite strains
from different host species (i.e. retaining one strain per
host species and including opportunistic infections), all
methods used for comparing these host and parasite phylogenies revealed a significant number of cospeciation
events or of congruence level as compared to random
associations. TreeMap [37], which seeks to minimize host
shifts, inferred a significantly higher number of cospeciation events than expected from a random distribution but
required many duplications and extinctions to achieve
this (Table 3, upper half) and five distinct smut species
were inferred on the ancestral host. The results were similar regardless of which topology was chosen for the unresolved nodes. Interestingly, TreeFitter [38] inferred a
much higher number of host shifts than cospeciation,
duplication and extinction events, and this was true
regardless of the topology and the costs chosen (Table 4,

Keeping a single representative per
fungal species

Eight data sets were used. For the fungi, "A" trees contain one strain per smut species and per host (see Fig. 3) and "B" trees a single representative
per smut species (see Fig. 4), and two possible topologies were used, "1" and "2", depending on the position of MvSa. For the plants, poorly
supported nodes were resolved in order to maximize the congruence with the fungal trees in the "Max" trees and minimize it in the "Min" trees, and
the "T" trees contain only host species on which fungal species are well established (i.e. ignoring the opportunistic infections). See also Figs. 3 and 4
for the correspondence between host and parasite phylogenies for the least congruent combinations.

upper half). The number of inferred cospeciation events
was nonetheless higher than expected from a random distribution in all cases. ParaFit [39] detected a significant
correlation between the plant and fungal trees (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0014, P < 0.0001 using the genetic distances
and ParaFitGlobal = 0.7643, P < 0.0001 using the patristic
distances). The Icong index [40] also indicated that the
congruence between plant and fungal trees was significant
or marginally significant (Table 5, upper half). Furthermore, we found a significant positive relationship

between the genetic distances between pairs of host plants
and the distance between the pairs of associated Microbotryum species using a Mantel test (a = 0.031, b = 0.125, P <
0.001).
The second approach, that we consider more correct,
retains a single representative per fungal species, associated to each of the multiple hosts for generalist species
(Fig. 4), which leads to ignore the opportunistic infections. This differs from the conventional approach in that

Eight data sets were used using fungal topologies described in Table 3. Plant trees had to be adjusted to be compatible with the fungal tree as the
Icong program does not allow for multiple associations. In the name of the plant tree "D" indicates that hosts harbouring several fungal species were
duplicated and "S" indicates that one host was chosen for generalist parasite species. These choices were made to maximize or minimize further the
congruence with the fungal tree as compared to Max and Min trees (see legend Table 3). P-value < 0.05 indicated that the congruence between host
and parasite trees was higher than that of two random trees.

it requires the proper delimitation of parasite species since
species are not defined by the host, but rather as a lineage
with an independent evolutionary history. In this case

neither TreeMap (Table 3, bottom half) nor TreeFitter
(Table 4, bottom half) inferred significantly more cospeciation events than expected from a random distribution,

regardless of the chosen topologies for the unresolved
nodes. For one of the two possible topologies of the plant
phylogeny (MaxT, Table 4), TreeFitter even inferred only
host shifts when costs where set to minimize the total
number of events. Furthermore, the pairwise plant and
Microbotryum genetic distances were not significantly correlated (Mantel test, a = 0.035, b = 0.064, P = 0.1173).
Only the ParaFit and Icong analyses remained significant
(ParaFitGlobal = 0.0014, P = 0.0002 using the genetic distances and ParaFitGlobal = 0. 7492, P = 0.00010 using the
patristic distances; with Icong, P < 0.05 for three out of
four of the combinations tested, Table 5, lower half), indicating that the parasite and host phylogenies were still
more similar than expected by chance. The significant
associations in the ParaFit results included both associations between Dianthus and Saponaria host species and
their parasites, and some of the Silene species. The significance of these associations may be due to the symmetry of
the two trees regarding the main clades: for instance, parasites found on Dianthus and Saponaria are monophyletic
as are the plants.

We conclude that the failure to appropriately delimit parasite species and represent generalist parasite species as
several separate taxa (one per host) had introduced a bias.
Inspection of nodes for which reconciliation analyses supported cospeciation in TreeMap showed that the strains
harboured by Dianthus spp. that belonged to the same
generalist fungal species were considered as lineages
arisen by cospeciation in the TreeMap reconciliation. In
the ParaFit analyses, this same group of strains contributed almost half of the significant associations (data not
shown). Thus, cospeciation events were inferred where
there had been no speciation at all, but rather a failure to
speciate or a host range expansion towards closely related
hosts. Thus failure to delimit parasite species inflated the
significance of congruence between the host and parasite
trees.
Geographic patterns
Most European host plant species used in this study have
overlapping ranges. For instance, all the phylogenetic species, except those of the genus Stellaria, include at least

Page 9 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:100

one sample from the Western Alps and most of them at
least one sample from the French Pyrenees (Additional
file 4). The current geographic distribution of host species
therefore appears to contribute little to the phylogenetic
relationships among fungal species. In North America the
hosts represent a clade whereas the smut sample collected
from S. lemmonii was not related to smuts from the two
other North American hosts (Fig. 2). Therefore we found
no geographic pattern explaining the phylogenetic relationships of the fungal species.
Relatedness among fungal species and host ecology
In cases of host shifts, host ecology may play a role by
facilitating contact between a parasite and a new host that
has, for instance, similar pollinators or habitats as the
original host. We therefore investigated whether recent
host shifts, detected from non-congruence in the terminal
branches of the host and parasite phylogenies (see Fig. 5),
occurred between hosts with similar ecologies such as
type of habitats and pollinator guilds. We detected several
interesting ecological similarities among hosts with
related smut lineages (see boxes on Fig. 5): the pair S. vulgaris/L. flos-jovis grows on well drained soils, such as calcareous meadows, at least in the Western Alps, which
could have facilitated potential host shift 1. Sphingidae,
Noctuidae (in particular Hadena bicruris), Apidae and Syrphidae all visit Silene nutans, L. flos-cuculi, S. vulgaris, S. latifolia and S. dioica and may thus have been the agents of
host shifts 3 and 4. Regarding potential host shift 4, Lychnis flos-cuculi, S. vulgaris, as well as S. nutans are often
found together on shady borders between fields and
woods. The Dianthus spp. and G. repens both grow on
exposed rocky areas and are pollinated by Syrphidae,
potentially favouring host shift 5. Intriguingly, S. otites
shares little similarities with other Silene from which it
could have inherited its parasites. It is mainly wind-pollinated, only shares butterflies as insect pollinators with S.
lemmonii which could have facilitated host shift 2, but
these two plant species have no current geographical overlap to our knowledge. This suggests that the incongruences 1, 3, 4, and 5 (Fig. 5) between host and parasite
phylogenies, if indeed the results of host shifts, may have
been facilitated by ecological similarities of the plants.
However, the lack of specificity of insect pollinators, the
large overlap of the ecotypes of the different hosts and the
probable rapid evolution of ecological traits at the examined scale render any such conclusions speculative.

Discussion
Caryophylloideae phylogeny
The host phylogeny, here including 20 species within the
sub-family Caryophylloideae provides interesting insights
in itself, because the relationships among Caryophyllaceae are still poorly known, in particular at the subgenus level [32-34]. It is striking that the three North

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/100

American hosts appear monophyletic, branching within
the European species. This would be consistent with their
evolution by allopatric speciation following a single colonization event from Europe, after the separation of these
two continents. Fossil records suggest an origin of the
Caryophyllaceae 70 Mya in Australia, the oldest fossils in
Europe dating back only 30–50 Mya [35], by which time
North America was separated from Europe by the Atlantic
Ocean [41].
Our dataset, with additional species compared to previous
studies [33,35], further supports the monophyly of the
genera Lychnis, Saponaria and Dianthus but unfortunately
fails to resolve the monophyly of the genus Silene. The relative position of species within the Dianthus clade was the
least resolved, suggesting recent radiation of Dianthus species. This may be particularly relevant for the study of
Microbotryum-Caryophyllaceae association because the
smut lineages on Dianthus species also appear to be less
host-specific than those on Silene species.
Importance of delimiting parasite species in cophylogeny
studies
We detected a number of cryptic generalist species with
multiple closely related hosts. When these were duplicated in the phylogeny to have one representative per host
species, the congruence between the host and parasite
phylogenies was artificially inflated. This shows that carefully delimiting parasite species boundaries in cophylogeny studies is important for assessing the degree of
cophylogenetic history, although it is rarely done for
micro-organisms. Most often parasites are simply sampled from different host species and the resulting tree is
compared to the tree for host species [9,14]. Such an
approach implicitly assumes that each host species harbours one distinct parasite species, an assumption that we
here show to be both unfounded and of potentially great
importance in this kind of study. The Microbotryum-Caryophyllaceae system shows further that generalist parasite
species are likely to infect a range of closely related hosts.
Therefore parasite species boundaries must be carefully
delimited to avoid erroneous interpretations of the degree
of congruence between host and parasite phylogenies.
Inference on Microbotryum evolutionary history: host
shifts versus cospeciation
After having carefully delimited fungal species, the
number of cospeciation events inferred by TreeMap and
Tree Fitter when reconciling the Microbotryum phylogeny
to that of their Caryophyllaceaous hosts was not higher
than expected from a random distribution, as suggested
by a previous study on a smaller sample [14] nor was there
a significant correlation (Mantel test) between genetic distances of host plant and their respective anther smut species.

Ecology 5 the host plants of the different Microbotryum species
Figure of
Ecology of the host plants of the different Microbotryum species. Phylogenetic tree of the Microbotryum species with
indication, on the branches, of their plant host clade (see Fig. 1 for host clade delimitation). The numbers in brackets indicate
the five terminal incongruences between the plant and fungal phylogenies. Here MvDsp1 and MvDsp2 were not distinguished
(fused in MvDsp) because of poor resolution in this part of plant phylogeny and thus inability to identify any incongruence
between the two phylogenies. Information about the ecology of the host plants is given: the most common clades of pollinators
are indicated in black and type of habitat in grey (Fields from the U.S. were drawn apart to highlight the geographical barrier to
host shift). Boxes indicate ecological similarities of host plants which parasite species are closely related.

Icong and ParaFit still detected significant congruence
between the host and fungal phylogenies, the significant
associations in ParaFit being mostly due to the parasite
species found on Dianthus and Saponaria. The significance
of the global ParaFit and Icong tests therefore most probably stems, not from pervasive cospeciation events, but
from the fact that the anther smut lineages infecting the
Dianthus and Saponaria plants were monophyletic, as were
the plants. This pattern is consistent with cospeciation or
host shifts between closely related members of these
clades, together with an absence of host shifts between
distantly related hosts like Silene and Dianthus. Host shifts
appear to have occurred between hosts with limited phylogenetic distances in the Microbotryum-Caryophyllaceae
disease system. Incipient host shifts by Microbotryum have
been reported onto S. vulgaris from S. latifolia [18,42] and
onto Gypsophila repens from the closely related Petrorhagia
saxifraga [43]. The large-scale congruence detected by
ParaFit and Icong is thus likely to be due to constraints

impeding shifts to hosts that are genetically too distant.
Investigating the branch lengths and divergence times of
the two phylogenies would be necessary to determine
whether cospeciation occurred at all [44]. Unfortunately,
available fossil records do not allow calibration of the
sequence divergence between the Microbotryum and its
host plant species [35,45].
Overall, our results suggest that cospeciation is not the
rule in the Microbotryum-Caryophyllaceae system, that
host shifts were pervasive, but that fungal species could
not shift to too distant host species (shift either associated
with speciation or not). Comparing the results of reconciliation analyses to that of methods investigating simple
congruence was important for identifying these constraints on host shifts imposed by host phylogeny.
Several factors may have limited the power of our analyses
on cophylogeny. First, our collection was restricted to the

Page 11 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:100

most common Caryophyllaceae: we have sampled 21 host
species of the more than 100 known to be infected with
anther smut [17]. Several additional independent fungal
lineages that may show more evidence of cospeciation
than the ones we have sampled are therefore likely to
exist. However, larger sampling is more likely to decrease
and not increase the global congruence between hosts and
parasites if host shifts occur between moderately distant
hosts as shown for Microbotryum species on Silene. And
indeed larger sampling gave evidence for host shifts in the
highly specific ant-fungus growing parasites (compare
conclusions of references [46] and [47]). Our conclusion
that Microbotryum has mainly evolved by host shifts is
therefore highly likely to hold with a larger sampling. Second, the lineages that appear to infect more than one host
species could actually be host-specific but too recently
divergent for our markers to detect differentiation. This
would increase the congruence of the Microbotryum and
Caryophyllaceae phylogenies, but would not decrease the
high number of host shifts required to reconcile the two
phylogenies. It would thus not affect our conclusions
regarding M. violaceum evolutionary history: the Microbotryum-Caryophyllaceae system is another example of a
host-parasite association where cocladogenesis is not the
rule and highlights the importance of cross species disease
transmission in the emergence of new parasites lineages
[9,11-14].

Conclusion
Adaptive specialization that follows rare host shift events
appears to be the major mechanism of speciation in
Microbotryum, as in many pathogenic fungi [4,48,49]. The
frequency of host shifts in the Microbotryum-Caryophyllaceae system, and in several other highly specific plantparasite associations [9,13,14], illustrates that specialization is far from an evolutionary dead end and that the
diversification of specialist species can occur by other phenomena than cospeciation. In agreement with this idea,
most previous cophylogeny studies on parasites able to
disperse to novel hosts have reported evidence for host
shifts, even when the number of cospeciation events was
found significant [47,50]. The possibility of host shift and
the degree of relatedness between ancestral and new hosts
will a priori depend on several factors, such as geography,
ecology, and the genetics of specialization. Current geographic distribution of host species seems to be of little
relevance for understanding the association between
Microbotryum and its hosts at a local or regional scale. We
detected some interesting examples of shared ecological
traits that may have facilitated host shifts.

Methods
Taxon Sampling
To test whether there is a phylogenetic association
between anther smut fungi and their Caryophyllaceae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/100

hosts, we used data from 21 host species from Europe and
North America for which we have observed Microbotryum
infections in natural populations. All host species analyzed in this study belong to subfamily Caryophylloideae,
except one Stellaria species, belonging to the subfamily
Alsinoideae [33]. To root host phylogenetic trees, the Stellaria sp. was used as an outgroup based on a previous
molecular phylogenetic study [33]. To root anther smut
phylogenetic trees, the strains from the North American
hosts S. caroliniana and S. virginica were used because they
were previously shown to branch at the base of all the species analyzed in the present study [28]. Because the plant
species are reasonably well established [31], a single plant
sample was collected per host species. Some North American Silene species are not monophyletic [51] but they
were not those included in our dataset. Several fungal
samples per host species were collected whenever possible
because the parasite taxonomy is currently being resolved
(see above). The origins of anther smut and host samples
are given in the Additional files 4 and 5, respectively.
Infected plants were detected by the violet, sporulating
anthers of open flowers and flower buds from these same
plants were collected and stored in individual paper or
glacine envelopes on silica gel.
Molecular Methods
Host plant DNA extraction and PCR amplification of
plant nuclear ITS and cpDNA (the intron within the trnL
gene, hereafter trnL, and the intergenic region between the
genes trnL and trnF, hereafter trnLF) were performed as
described previously [52]. DNA from the fungal strains
was extracted from the cultures using a Chelex protocol
[53]. Fungal DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the
β-tubulin (β-tub), γ-tubulin (γ-tub) and Elongation factor
1 α (Ef1α) were amplified according to [29]. PCR fragments were purified and sequenced as described previously [29,52].

The programs Navigator PPC (Applied Biosystems) and
Bioedit 6.0.7 [54] were used to check sequence electropherograms. Multiple alignments based on consensus
sequences were carried out using BioEdit. Alignments
were then checked and apparent alignment errors were
corrected by hand. Regions of ambiguous alignment and
gaps were excluded from all analyses.
Sequence data
The sequences generated are available in GenBank (Accession numbers plant ITS are EF407925–EF407945, for

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:100

smut sequences generated previously [29] were also used,
and are indicated in the Additional file 4.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony (MP) and Neighbor-Joining
(NJ). MP and NJ analyses were performed using PAUP version 4.0b10 [55]. The following options were employed
for MP analyses in PAUP: heuristic search, characters
unordered with equal weight, starting tree obtained via
stepwise addition option and constructed with random
sequence addition (10 replicates), branch swapping by
TBR (tree bisection reconnection). A single MP tree was
recovered for all datasets. NJ analyses were performed
using the molecular evolution models selected by AIC in
ModelTest 3.7 [56]. The models retained were TIM+G,
gamma shape = 0.41 for the concatenated plant data set,
HKY+G, Ti/Tv = 2.2, gamma shape = 1.12 for the fungal βtub gene, HKY+I, invariable sites = 0.52 for the fungal γtub gene, GTR+G, gamma shape = 0.24 for the fungal Ef1α
gene and GTR+G, gamma shape = 0.26 for the concatenated fungal dataset. Bootstrap confidence values were
calculated for 1,000 pseudoreplicates. Bayesian analyses
were run using MrBayes version 3.0b5 [57]. Each run consisted of 4 incrementally heated Markov chains run simultaneously, with heating value set to default (0.2). Priors
were constrained according to the results obtained by running MrModeltest 2.2 [58]. Markov chains were initiated
from a random tree and run for increasing numbers of
generations, until the average standard deviation
remained below 0.01, i.e. 1,000,000 generations for Ef1α,
1,250,000 generations for γ-tub, 1,000,000 generations
for β-tub, 500,000 generations for the fungal and plant
concatenated datasets. Trees were sampled every 50 generations and the first 25% of trees were not taken into
account. We used a 50% majority rule consensus tree to
obtain the Bayesian posterior probabilities (Bpp). Details
on the phylogenetic parameters used and output statistics
are available upon request. Data matrices and resulting
trees are available in TreeBase (submission ID number
SN3239; Journal Peer Reviewer's PIN number: 30601).
We considered nodes as strongly supported by a given
method when they had values of Bayesian Posterior Probabilities/Maximum Parsimony Bootstraps/Neighbor-Joining Bootstraps at least equal to 0.9/70/70, respectively.
Monophyly supported by at least two methods was considered as significant.
Congruence between individual phylogenies within fungal
or plant systems
Congruence between individual phylogenies was estimated by Approximately Unbiased tests (AU) as implemented in CONSEL [59], by comparing for each gene the
likelihood of the MP topology obtained for this gene to
the likelihood of the enforced topologies (obtained with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/100

each other gene) [60]. Likelihoods were obtained in PAUP
using the sequence evolution model selected, using AIC,
according to the results of ModelTest v. 3.7 [56]. The
incongruence length difference test (ILD, [61]) was not
used because several works have underlined that the ILD
test is a poor indicator of data set combinability [62].
In absence of significant difference, we further checked
the congruence of each node by visual inspection. Nodes
were considered as congruent in two gene phylogenies
when supported by significant statistical values of at least
two of the three phylogenetic reconstruction methods in
each of the two phylogenies. Nodes were considered as
incongruent between two gene phylogenies when significant statistical values of at least two of the three phylogenetic reconstruction methods supported conflicting nodes
between the two gene phylogenies.
When we found no evidence for incongruence, the genes
were concatenated to perform combined analyses, similarly as described above. Consistency between the resulting tree and individual gene trees was again checked by
visual inspection.
Identification of fungal phylogenetic species
To detect phylogenetic species within M. violaceum, we
used the criterion of phylogenetic congruence between
different gene phylogenies [29]. We thus considered a
group of strains as an independent evolutionary lineage
when 1) it was strongly supported as monophyletic by
two of the three reconstruction methods in at least one
gene phylogeny or in the concatenated phylogeny, and 2)
this was not contradicted by the other gene phylogenies.
Using three different methods of reconstruction allows us
to be conservative in our species delimitation rule, and to
avoid splitting the fungus into too many species based on
some artefact of one particular method. We considered
here again nodes as strongly supported by a given method
when they had values of Bayesian Posterior Probabilities/
Maximum Parsimony Bootstraps/Neighbor-Joining Bootstraps at least equal to 0.9/70/70, respectively.
Comparison of host and fungal trees
To compare the plant and fungal phylogenies, we used the
data derived from the concatenated sequences. As we
wanted to assess the impact of species delimitation, we
retained successively: 1) one fungal strain per host species,
and 2) one fungal strain per fungal species but linking it
to all the hosts that this parasite species was found to
infect.

For reconciliation analyses (TreeMap [37] and TreeFitter
[38]) and Maximum Agreement Subtrees (Icong index
[40]), which do not accept polytomies, phylogenetic relationships in our plant tree that were poorly supported

Page 13 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:100

were resolved when possible according to previous studies
(see symbol * on Figs. 3 and 4). For the remaining unresolved nodes, the alternative placements were considered
as equally possible. In order to reduce the combinations
of plant and fungal tree comparisons, we used only two
topologies among all possible ones, for each of the plants
and fungi. One topology was chosen as a priori maximizing the congruence with the other partner and the other
one minimizing it (see symbol ¤ on Fig. 3 and 4). For the
methods using genetic distances (Mantel tests) or patristic
distances (ParaFit) original datasets were conserved but
we excluded S. acaulis, because of the incongruence
between individual gene phylogenies, which may have
resulted from hybridization between two distant lineages.
The history of association between hosts and fungi was
first investigated using reconciliation analysis as implemented in the programs TreeMap [37] and TreeFitter [38].
TreeMap 1 uses a model to find optimal reconstructions
of the history of the association by maximizing cospeciation events [37]. In situations when host shifts are likely
to be common, as in our case [14], this methodology is
less likely to find optimal solutions than when host shifts
are rare [63]. A later release of this program, TreeMap 2.0b
[64], considers all potentially optimal solutions and offers
a more appropriate means of dealing with host shifts.
However, this program is currently limited in size and
complexity of datasets that can be computed, and we
could not run the complete analysis with our dataset.
Thus, in this study we used the program TreeMap 1 with
the heuristic search option to reconcile plant and fungal
trees. The program TreeFitter 1.0 uses a different algorithm and optimality criterion for reconciling the host
and fungal phylogenies, allowing reconstructions involving many host shifts to be recovered. In both TreeMap and
TreeFitter, one can test the null hypothesis that the two
phylogenies are randomly related by comparing the scores
of optimal reconstructions (i.e. the number of cospeciation events for TreeMap and global cost for TreeFitter)
with those of randomly obtained phylogenies through
permutational procedures. We chose to randomize the
parasite trees because in cophylogeny analyses, the host
tree is considered as given, and one wants to test whether
the observed parasite tree is more congruent with the host
tree than are random parasite trees. Tests were performed
based on 3000 permutations for TreeMap and 10,000 permutations for TreeFitter. TreeFitter allows assignment of
different costs to four types of events (i.e. cospeciation,
duplication, extinction, and host shift). When using the
option seeking for costs with the highest likelihood, we
found a very large range of possible costs. We varied these
costs to assess effects on the test results, and retained one
set of costs maximizing the likelihood of cospeciation
events inferred, and the other one minimizing the total
number of events.

As a third approach we used the method ParaFit [39] that
uses matrices of principal coordinates, derived either from
patristic distances (summed branch lengths along a phylogenetic tree; in that case, S. acaulis was excluded) or
genetic distances, and the matrix of presence/absence of
host parasite associations. Using patristic distances allows
taking into account the most likely phylogenetic relationships in addition to genetic distances. We performed both
analyses. The trace statistic is calculated by taking plantfungus associations into account. The null hypothesis that
the plant and fungal samples are randomly associated is
tested by a permutational procedure. Patristic distances
were calculated from the unresolved trees derived from
the concatenated datasets using PATRISTIC [65,66]. Phylogenetic distances were calculated using the software
MEGA [67]. Principal coordinates were then computed
using the software DistPCoA [68].
The fourth method assessed whether the plant and fungal
topologies were more similar than expected by chance
using the Icong index [40]. With this method, the topological congruence of two trees is assessed through their
maximum agreement subtree (MAST). A MAST is the largest possible tree compatible with two given trees [69] and
is obtained by removing the minimum number of leaves
(i.e. terminal branches) in both trees in order to obtain
perfect congruence. Significant congruence is inferred
when congruence between the two trees is higher than
that of random trees with the same leaf number. As for the
previous methods, we reduced the number of topologies
tested by choosing two topologies for the plant tree and
two for the fungal tree. As this method requires that the
trees had the same number of leaves, hosts harbouring
several fungal species were duplicated. When using a single strain per fungal species, we also had to select a single
one of the multiple hosts. The choice was made so that the
congruence with the fungal tree was maximized or minimized. We assessed the level of congruence for the four
resulting combinations. Finally, we correlated genetic distances of host plants with the distances between associated Microbotryum species. Genetic distances were
computed as for ParaFit. As the data were not independent, we tested the matrix correlation using permutations
(Mantel test in the software Genepop [70,71]).
Pollinator and ecological data
Data on the common pollinators of the Caryophyllaceae
species included in this study were collected from the literature [27,72-77] and from personal observations and
communications (J.A. Shykoff, A. Erhardt). Some individual species, e.g. Hadena bicruris, were reported as pollinators, but most descriptions were made at higher
taxonomic levels (e.g. genus or family) or common name
(e.g. moths or butterflies). This raises the concern that
plants pollinated by the same genus or family may not be

visited by exactly the same species or the same individuals. For well studied plant species, however, only a few different pollinators are reported and these pollinator
species are rather unspecialized, being found pollinating
several plant genera or families [27,72,74]. For instance,
Macroglossum stellatarum (Sphingidae), Hadena bicruris,
and Autographa gamma (Noctuidae) were all found on at
least three different host species [72]. Moreover, other
observations showed that individual pollinators land successively on three sympatric species: Dianthus carthusianorum, Silene vulgaris and Silene nutans [27]. We therefore
considered that sharing a clade of pollinators implied
sharing at least one pollinator species, thus possibly
allowing M. violaceum spore transmission.

To partition the plant species into ecological groups based
on their most common habitats, the French botanical web
site SOPHY [78], literature data [79], and personal observations and communications (J.A. Shykoff, A. Erhardt, C.
Bock) were used. Ecological similarity may lead to crossspecies disease transmission even in the absence of shared
insect pollinators because spores can also be disseminated
by wind, rain and phytophageous insects [27].
