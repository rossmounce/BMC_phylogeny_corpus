Abstract
Background: The ongoing efforts to sequence the honey bee genome require additional initiatives
to define its transcriptome. Towards this end, we employed the Open Reading frame ESTs
(ORESTES) strategy to generate profiles for the life cycle of Apis mellifera workers.

Results: Of the 5,021 ORESTES, 35.2% matched with previously deposited Apis ESTs. The analysis
of the remaining sequences defined a set of putative orthologs whose majority had their best-match
hits with Anopheles and Drosophila genes. CAP3 assembly of the Apis ORESTES with the already
existing 15,500 Apis ESTs generated 3,408 contigs. BLASTX comparison of these contigs with
protein sets of organisms representing distinct phylogenetic clades revealed a total of 1,629 contigs
that Apis mellifera shares with different taxa. Most (41%) represent genes that are in common to all
taxa, another 21% are shared between metazoans (Bilateria), and 16% are shared only within the
Insecta clade. A set of 23 putative genes presented a best match with human genes, many of which
encode factors related to cell signaling/signal transduction. 1,779 contigs (52%) did not match any
known sequence. Applying a correction factor deduced from a parallel analysis performed with
Drosophila melanogaster ORESTES, we estimate that approximately half of these no-match ESTs
contigs (22%) should represent Apis-specific genes.
Conclusions: The versatile and cost-efficient ORESTES approach produced minilibraries for
honey bee life cycle stages. Such information on central gene regions contributes to genome
annotation and also lends itself to cross-transcriptome comparisons to reveal evolutionary trends
in insect genomes.

Background
The honey bee, Apis mellifera, occupies a prominent place
in biological research due to its social behavior, learning
capabilities, haplodiploid mechanism of sex determination, and plasticity in phenotype (caste) and longevity.
Thus, it is a model organism for classical and sociogenetic
studies. In addition, bees drive a large-scale apicultural
industry, and also generate important income in smallscale subsistence beekeeping. And finally, bees are of great
economic and ecological relevance for their role as generalist pollinators.
The decision to include the honey bee amongst the current organisms for complete genome sequencing, http://
www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/honeybee/ was, therefore, well founded, yet information on its transcriptome is
still meager. When starting this study, little over 250 genes
were annotated as partial or full length coding sequences,
and only about 15,500 expressed sequence tags (mainly
5'-ESTs generated from a normalized bee brain cDNA
library [1]) were available in public databases. Thus, even
after sequencing of the honey bee genome will be completed a considerable transcriptome sequencing effort will
still be required for unequivocal genome annotation, gene
identification, and subsequent functional studies.
We used the ORESTES (Open Reading frame Expressed
Sequence Tags) strategy to generate ESTs from different
life cycle stages of the honey bee, such as appropriate for
a genome annotation initiative. This strategy preferentially generates ESTs of the central, and thus most informative portion of the transcript [2], and frequently also
identifies less abundant mRNAs [3]. The efficacy of the
Open Reading frame ESTs strategy, in the context of an
organism for which there is limited genomic information,
has recently been demonstrated for Schistosoma mansoni

against a non-redundant protein database (NCBI). Independent of its E-score, the best match in each BLASTX result was
listed according to organism category.

This cost-efficient approach increased the already existent
Apis EST database by 30% new reads. Of the 5,021
ORESTES, only 35.2% matched with previously deposited
Apis ESTs. When assembled with the existent Apis ESTs in
the NCBI database, the ORESTES sequences extended
66% of the mixed contigs. Together these data indicate
that the ORESTES methodology could effectively complement the current efforts towards the definition of the Apis
transcriptome.

Results and discussion
Honey bee Open Reading frame ESTs
We generated a total of 87 mini-libraries from the four
major life cycle stages of honey bee workers (embryo,
larva, pupa, adult) by the use of arbitrary primers and a
low-stringency RT-PCR protocol [2]. From these libraries
we obtained 5,021 sequences of appropriate standard
quality (sequence > 100 bases; Phred 15) and with an
average size of 373.9 bp. These sequences were deposited
in the GenBank EST database (accession numbers
CK628548 to CK633568). In the annotation pipeline,
these were first submitted to BLASTN searches against Apis
mellifera sequences deposited in the NCBI EST database
(dbEST). At this step, 35.2% (1,769) of the validated
sequences matched Apis ESTs (Table 1). In a subsequent
step, a BLASTX comparison of the remaining sequences
against the nr-NCBI database permitted the annotation of
an additional 22.4% (1,123) of the honey bee ORESTES,
while the remaining 42.4% (2,129) did not match any
known sequence. This rather large set of ESTs that did not
result in significant alignment with any sequence deposited in non-redundant databases contains candidates for
novel honey bee genes.

The 5,021 Apis ORESTES were assembled by CAP3 into
488 contigs of a mean size of 519 bp, leaving 893 singlets.
In a second round of BLASTX comparisons against the nrNCBI database, 28.5% of the contigs and 9.2% of the singlets were classified as putative orthologs. When the
respective best matches were classified according to species or higher order taxa (Figure 1), 89.6% were from the

arthropod clade (including fully or partially sequenced
Apis mellifera genes). The largest fraction of these putative
orthologs showed best matches with predicted Anopheles
genes (43.9%), followed by ORESTES that were classified
as putative orthologs of Drosophila (29.5%).
Gene Ontology classification
We assigned level 3 Gene Ontology (GO) classifications
to 326 of the total of 488 assembled contigs; 162 contigs
did not match any sequence in the nr-protein database. In
the manual annotation preceding the GO analysis we
preferentially assigned the contigs with respect to their
Drosophila orthologs. The cellular component, biological
process, and molecular function classifications of the
honey bee sequences are shown in Table 2. In the biological process categories there is a clear prevalence for ESTs
representing cell communication, cell growth and maintenance, metabolism and morphogenesis. For molecular
function, the dominant assignments were to enzymatic
activity and to nucleic acid binding and related functions
(translation factor, transcription factor). When compared
to the corresponding GO results obtained for the bee
brain ESTs [1], we noted a similar distribution in category
dominance structure, except for the molecular functions
'transporter and ligand binding/carrier' which have a
higher representation in the bee brain ESTs than in our
ORESTES contigs. This discrepancy most probably reflects
functional differences in the tissues used in these two
studies.
Clustering of honey bee ESTs
We clustered the contigs generated in this study (AmORESTES contigs) with the Apis mellifera ESTs already present
in the NCBI dbEST database (further referred to as
AmNCBI contigs). Clustering performed by CAP3 resulted
in a total of 3,408 contigs and led to a general increase in
read depth (Figure 2A). This increase in read depth is
reflected in the CAP3 assembled mixed sequences of the
two databases. Mean length is 696 bp for the AmNCBI
contigs and 496 bp for the AmORESTES contigs (Figure
2B). For the mixed contigs we noted a mean increase of
about 150 bp in contig length, thus documenting that the
ORESTES sequences add considerable information to the
characterization of the honey bee transcriptome and for
subsequent studies of specific genes.

Within the total contig population, 9.5% of the assembled sequences (323) are represented by mixed contigs of
both AmORESTES and AmNCBI sequences, and within
this group 66.3% (214) of the original AmNCBI contigs
were considerably extended, or were joined across gaps by
the AmORESTES contigs, as illustrated in Figure 2C. The
fact that the number of mixed contigs is relatively low
compared to total contig number may be attributed to two
aspects. First, most of the AmNCBI contigs were obtained

from a single tissue (brain) library, whereas the AmORESTES sequences represent whole body transcripts of all
life cycle stages of the honey bee. Second, the AmNCBI
sequences are mainly 5'-ESTs, whereas the AmORESTES
sequences are expected to cover more central cDNA
regions.
Genome comparison
Even though the total number of ESTs available for Apis
mellifera is still low when compared to established
genomic model organisms, we performed an across

genome analysis with the set of 3,408 honey bee contigs.
This involved sequential BLASTX searches, using the
honey bee sequences as query entries against protein databases of Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae,
Caenorhabditis elegans, human, protozoan and fungal origin. With this selection of organisms we intended to
extract information on the percentage of genes that Apis
shares (i) with all organisms, (ii) with animals, (iii) with
different sets of metazoans, (iv) and exclusively with
insects. The cutoff E-value in these comparisons was set at
10-6, as used in comparisons of similar nature [4], and the
representation of the respective putative orthologs was
listed across taxonomic levels.
We found that 1,629 Apis contigs presented significant
match with sequences belonging to at least one of the taxa
genomes. From these, 460 contigs (28.2%) correspond to
genes with a representation in all the above taxa (Figure
3). In addition, further 211 contigs (12.9%) could also be
classified as common to all organisms since they were represented in all but in one of the members of this set of taxa
(at this level, Anopheles and Drosophila were considered as
a single group representing Diptera). This increases the set
of EST contigs that the honey bee may share with all
organisms to 41.2%, or, when considering the entire set of
3,408 contigs, to 19.7%. The second largest set of ESTs
(312 + 37 contigs) is the one that is represented as genes
common to the bilaterian clade (or metazoans in general), and only the third largest set (198 + 68 ESTs) contains genes that are represented solely in hymenopterans
and dipterans, and thus in the insect clade.
Since deep-level phylogeny relationships within the bilateria are still a matter of debate, we separated our dataset
according to the two prevalent hypotheses. The traditional
view clusters arthropods within the coelomate clade. In
our set of genomes, this tree architecture would be represented by genes shared between insects and the human
genome. The alternative, more recently proposed hypothesis joins arthropods with nematodes to form an ecdysozoan clade [5]. The result of our comparison, which places
emphasis on shared genes and not on the frequency of
gene losses, is more consistent with the traditional view,
since the coelomate clade is represented in this analysis
with almost five times more shared genes than the ecdysozoan clade.
To infer on functional aspects within this pattern of genes
that different clades appear to have in common we
performed a Gene Ontology classification on biological
process. In the set of Apis ESTs that stands for genes putatively shared with all organisms, the majority was classified as having a role in metabolism, and thus can be
considered to represent basic functions. In contrast, the
majority of Apis ESTs that are shared within the insect

Plasmodium falciparum and P. yoelii) and fungi (primarily represented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and
Neurospora crassa). These BLASTX comparisons were performed with an E-value cut-off level set at 10-6. Subsequently, the

clade was represented in the biological process categories
of cell growth and/or maintenance and cell communication. The corresponding insect-specific genes are therefore
supposedly involved in more specialized functions. A similar conclusion can be reached from the micro- and macroarray analyses of transcripts detected in adult honey bee

workers performing different tasks during their adult life
cycle [6,7].
A total of 70 putative ortholog ESTs did not comply with
any of the plausible phylogenies, yet nevertheless, this set
may contain ESTs of interesting information content,
especially when considering that the main set of genes

within this group consists of Apis mellifera contigs that
overlap with a mammalian genome. A manual analysis of
these 23 contigs by BLASTX against the nr-NCBI database
revealed that they are (at least by three orders of magnitude in E-values) more similar to mammals (especially to
humans) than to other vertebrates and even other insects.
This suggests that these genes may have diverged less in
Apis and mammals and, therefore, may be subject to
related selection pressure. Alternatively, at least some of
them may have been modified in Diptera, and thus would
show up as insect genes only once further non-dipteran
insect genomes or transcriptomes have been sequenced
and annotated. As shown in Table 3, this set of bee/
human contigs contains a considerable number of predicted proteins related to cell signaling/signal transduction and transcription factors. Such a bias to information
processing in our dataset of genes shared between honey
bees and a mammalian genome may reveal system properties related to complex functions.
Finally, we found that 1,779 (52,2%) of the assembled
EST contigs did not match with any sequence of the analyzed organisms. Such a large proportion of Apis-specific
contigs is likely to be an overestimate. As noted in a previous study [1], this might be partly due to technical problems, such as, sequencing of cDNA inserts consisting

mainly of 3'-untranslated regions, the presence of
unspliced intron sequences, cDNAs with a negative reading frame, or chimaeric cDNAs. However, the major portion of the Apis-specific contigs may have become
classified as species-specific due to their relatively short
ORFs. We performed an ESTScan analysis http://
www.ch.embnet.org/software/ESTScan.html on the Apisspecific contigs which detected ORFs in 56% of the
assembled ESTs. These ORFs are, however, relatively
short, with a mean ORF length around 280 bp. Short ORF
length represents a notorious problem to alignment algorithms resulting in low match scores, and consequently, a
more frequent classification of short ORF ESTs as speciesspecific transcripts. For the honey bee, this has been
shown for the brain cDNA library where 84% of the ESTs
with ORFs shorter than 450 bp were classified as speciesspecific, against 24% in the EST set that had ORFs larger
than 450 bp [1].
In order to gain a general perspective on the representation of species-specific ESTs we also directed our attention
to estimates obtained in whole-genome cross-species
analyses. For instance, a figure of 18.6% of species-specific
genes was ascertained for Drosophila melanogaster in a
genome comparison which included Anopheles gambiae as
the other insect representative [8]. Based on this informa-

tion, and taking advantage of a set of Drosophila melanogaster ORESTES, generated in a parallel project, we
calculated the frequency of Drosophila-specific ORESTES
sequences to obtain a more realistic estimate on Apis-specific genes in relatively small sets of ESTs. In this analysis,
a set of 5,000 CAP3 assembled Drosophila ORESTES (409
contigs) was submitted to sequential BLASTX searches
against protein databases of Drosophila melanogaster,
Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, human, protozoan and fungal, as described for the Apis contigs. For
comparison, this same analysis was also performed with
Apis ESTs, using separately 5,000 AmORESTES (486 contigs) and 5,000 AmNCB (632 contigs).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/84

The Drosophila and Apis EST contigs consistently showed
relatively low proportions of insect-specific genes (6–
13%). Still lower (ca. 1% each) was the proportion of
ESTs that had significantly higher similarity scores with
eukaryotes other than Insecta. In all EST sets we found a
large fraction of sequences that were classified as either
Drosophila-specific (40%) or Apis-specific (51% for
AmNCBI dbESTs and 47% for AmORESTES). This high
proportion of species-specific genes, therefore appears to
be generated independent of the method used in EST
sequencing, as it is represented in similar proportions in
both the ORESTES set and the conventional 5'-EST set
(Figure 4).

Percentage of honey bee and Drosophila ESTs representing putative species-specific genes (blue bars) in relation to ESTs that
represent genes solely shared within the insect clade (pink bars), or that have higher similarity with eukaryotes other than the
insect clade (yellow bars). In separate comparisons, the Apis mellifera contigs (ORESTES + NCBI dbESTs, n = 5,000), AmORESTES (n = 5,000), AmNCBI dbESTs (n = 5,000), and Drosophila melanogaster ORESTES contigs (n = 5,000) were analyzed
against protein databases of an insect (Anopheles gambiae) and several non-insect species (C. elegans, protozoans, fungi and H.
sapiens) with completely sequenced genomes. The cut-off E-value in these comparisons was set at 10-6.

The figure of 40% Drosophila-specific genes obtained for
our Drosophila ORESTES set can be directly set in contrast
with the estimate of 18,6% species-specific genes reported
in the Drosophila genome based study [8], and this would
predict an overestimate factor of 2.15 for species-specific
genes in the EST sets. When this factor is applied to the
honey bee ORESTES, the 47% estimate for species-specific
AmORESTES can thus be corrected to a more realistic figure of 22%. This estimate is in agreement with the results
of Whitfield et al. [1] who observed that 24% of the honey
bee genes represented by ESTs with ORFs larger than 450
bp did not have matches to any known protein sequences.
This Apis-specific gene estimate is also in range when considering that the two dipteran species are thought to have
separated from a common ancestor approximately 250
million years ago, whereas the postulated sister-group
relationship of Hymenoptera and Mecopteroidea [9] suggests a pre-permian divergence, with a predicted separate
lineage evolution of over 280 million years for honey bees
and dipterans [10].

Conclusions
The generation of a relative small set of Open Reading
frame ESTs (ORESTES) that match and complement the
already existent Apis EST database shows that this
approach is sufficiently robust and favorably complements other strategies, such as ESTs prepared from
normalized cDNA libraries. Its inherent properties of
detecting transcripts of low abundance and aligning with
central regions of transcripts [2,3] also make it a suitable
tool in searches for novel honey bee genes and their annotation in parallel with ongoing genome sequencing
projects. Furthermore, the genome comparisons performed in this and other studies [1,11] highlight that the
elevated number of putative Apis-specific genes will still
require extensive transcriptome sequencing for high quality genome annotation, and will play an important role in
the question of insect genome organization and model
systems in comparative studies [12].

Methods
Biological samples and RNA extraction
Samples of the four major stages of the honey bee life
cycle were collected from Apis mellifera colonies (Africanized hybrids) kept in the experimental apiary of the
Dept. Genetics, Univ. São Paulo, Campus Ribeirão Preto,
Brazil. Each embryo sample contained approximately 300
eggs retrieved from a frame on which the queen had been
caged for up to 72 hours. This assured that we covered the
entire embryonic period. The larval sample was a representation of all five instars and included also spinningstage larvae. Prepupae and pupae, including white-eyed,
pink-eyed, brown-eyed and pigmenting pupae, were
pooled into the pupal samples. For the adult sample we
collected newly emerged bees, a random sample of hive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/84

bees (picked from a brood frame), and returning foragers.
All these samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
The lipid-rich larval and pupal samples required two additional extraction steps with phenol/chloroform and chloroform to obtain RNA of adequate purity.
In the case of Drosophila melanogaster, dechorionated
embryos, larvae plus prepupae and pupae, as well as adult
flies were collected from an isogenic y, w1118 stock of Drosophila melanogaster. These were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use. Total RNA was
extracted with TRIzol, as described for Apis mellifera.
Generation of Open Reading frame ESTs (ORESTES)
From high quality DNA-free total RNA samples we isolated poly(A)+ RNA using an Oligotex II (Qiagen) kit. To
assess poly(A)+ RNA quality of the samples we performed
Northern blot hybridizations with an actin (Apis mellifera)
or tubulin (Drosophila melanogaster) probe. The probes
were labeled by a random priming reaction in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The actin fragment was amplified
using the primers described in Table 4. The Drosophila
tubulin probe was already available from previous studies. High quality total RNA preparations were subjected to
a DNase I treatment, and the absence of DNA contaminants was assessed by Southern blot hybridization of PCR
products amplified with Apis or Drosophila 16S mitochondrial DNA primers, respectively. High quality poly(A)+
RNAs were aliquoted and stored at -80°C.

ORESTES profiles were generated according to Dias-Neto
et al. [2]. Briefly, aliquots of 15 ng of purified mRNA were
subjected to reverse transcription reactions utilizing
SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a set
of randomly selected primers (Table 4). First-strand cDNA
synthesis occurred at 37°C for 60 min in a total volume of
20 µl. The products of this reaction were diluted 1:5 in
water and stored at -20°C. The cDNAs contained in 1 µl
of each diluted RT-product were then amplified by PCR
using the same or a single alternative random primer in a
PCR mix (Ready-to-Go PCR bead, Amersham Biosciences). The amplification protocol consisted of an initial step at 75°C for 5 min, followed by a 45 cycles
touchdown series (95°C for 30 s, a gradually decreasing
annealing temperature from 66 to 44°C lasting 10 s per
step and a decrease of 2°C per step, 72°C for 1 min), and
a final extension reaction at 72°C for 7 min.
Aliquots of the PCR products (3–5 µl) were run on 1%
agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. From
profiles that presented near-even smears we excised two
sets of amplification products, one covering a size range
from 300 to 700 bp and a second one from 700 to 1500
bp. For cloning, these were extracted from the agarose gels

for transformation of competent E. coli DH5α-cells by
heat shock. Bacteria were grown in 2 × YT medium before
aliquots were plated on 2 × YT agar containing ampicillin.
Blue-white selected positive colonies were picked, grown
overnight in 2 × YT medium in 96-well plates, and used as
templates for PCR using vector primers (M13 forward and
reverse). An aliquot of each amplification product was
analyzed on a 1% agarose gel before another 1 µl aliquot
was submitted to DNA sequencing using standard protocols of the DYEnamic™ ET Terminator kit (Amersham Bio-

sciences). The reaction products were analyzed in a
MegaBACE™ 1000 automated sequencer. Only profiles
with more than 80% positive PCR reactions were
sequenced.

Phredfy (insert size > 100, "N" nucleotides less than 20%,
and "N" repetitions of less than 6 nucleotides) and ScoreCard procedure (MegaBACE™) to check sequences quality,
reads that were larger than 100 nt were submitted to an
automated protocol for data analysis (Gene Annotation
Pipeline) of the Apis mellifera or Drosophila melanogaster

ORESTES. The protocol consisted of the following steps:
conversion of electropherograms (Phred, to formats
.fasta, .phd and .qual), primer and vector detection and
trimming (Cross_match) and masking of repeats (RepeatMasker). Validated fasta format sequences were then submitted to a general BLASTN search against GenBank
entries for mitochondrial and rRNA, as well as bacterial
and fungal RNA to detect and eliminate contaminant
sequences.
For the Apis mellifera ORESTES, subsequent BLASTN
searches were performed against the approximately
15,500 Apis mellifera EST sequences deposited in GenBank
dbEST. In this case, significant E values were set at 10-30.
Searches against the non-redundant protein database
entries used the BLASTX option with E-values set at 10-10
as significance cut-off level.
CAP3 was used to clusterize the ORESTES sequences of
both species. For Apis mellifera, the annotation of the 488
contigs was manually checked, giving preference to Drosophila sequences in the Unigene assignment. Subsequently, the contigs were batch submitted to a Gene
Ontology procedure utilizing the FatiGO tools [13]http://
fatigo.bioinfo.cnio.es/. Clusterization of the Apis
ORESTES contigs and singletons with the Apis mellifera
ESTs deposited in GenBank dbEST was also performed
using a CAP3 routine (standard parameters).
