Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic whole genome sequences are accumulating at an impressive rate.
Effective methods for comparing multiple whole eukaryotic genomes on a large scale are needed.
Most attempted solutions involve the production of large scale alignments, and many of these
require a high stringency pre-screen for putative orthologs in order to reduce the effective size of
the dataset and provide a reasonably high but unknown fraction of correctly aligned homologous
sites for comparison. As an alternative, highly efficient methods that do not require the prealignment of operationally defined orthologs are also being explored.
Results: A non-alignment method based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was used to
compare the predicted protein complement of nine whole eukaryotic genomes ranging from yeast
to man. This analysis resulted in the simultaneous identification and definition of a large number of
well conserved motifs and gene families, and produced a species tree supporting one of two
conflicting hypotheses of metazoan relationships.
Conclusions: Our SVD-based analysis of the entire protein complement of nine whole eukaryotic
genomes suggests that highly conserved motifs and gene families can be identified and effectively
compared in a single coherent definition space for the easy extraction of gene and species trees.
While this occurs without the explicit definition of orthologs or homologous sites, the analysis can
provide a basis for these definitions.

Background
Several methods have been developed for the detailed global comparison of multiple whole genomes and the production of global phylogenies. Most of these methods
require the prior identification and selection of a reasonably small subset of putative orthologs within which individual homologous sites are identified with some degree
of confidence using alignment [1-7]. Frequently, detailed
alignment information is subdivided and compressed

into a smaller number of complex characters (such as gene
content or gene order), which are then used for quantitative comparison [[4,5]; see [6] for review], but the more or
less direct use of large scale sequence alignments have also
been attempted [7].
Though generally less developed, many non-alignment
methods, considered initially by Blaisdell [8], are currently being explored for a similar purpose [[9-15]; see

[17] for review]. Rarely do such methods simultaneously
provide 1) detailed and unbiased comparisons of a high
fraction of biomolecular sequences within full genome
datasets, and 2) globally consistent gene and species trees
based on this exhaustive comparison. We have recently
developed an SVD-based phylogenetic method that provides accurate comparisons of a high fraction of sequences
within whole genomes without the prior identification of
orthologs or homologous sites [13]. This method has
been successfully applied to a number of diverse genome
datasets, including mitochondrial genomes, bacterial
genomes, and viral genomes [13-15]. Here we apply this
method to a diverse set of nine complete eukaryotic
nuclear genomes, resulting in the production of a species
tree based on the automatic identification and simultaneous comparison of over 400 conserved amino acid motifs
and gene families.

Results and discussion
Proteome data sets and sequence conversion
The nine eukaryotic genomes compared in this analysis
are listed in Table 1. The protein sets obtained from NCBI
for the malaria parasite (Pfal) and the budding yeast
(Scer) each contributed only 3% of the 175,559 total proteins in the dataset, while the proteins for Frub provided
nearly 21% of the total. Only the Frub proteins were
obtained from the Ensemble Genome Browser [16], since
protein predictions for this organism were not available
from NCBI. Differences in methods used to predict proteins by these two organizations might be responsible for
the large difference in the number of proteins predicted
for comparable vertebrate genomes (>37,000 for Frub,
but only 21–25,000 for all other vertebrates). These differences could, in principle, drastically effect the gene and
species trees derived from a global comparison of all proteins. However, the position of Frub in the final species
tree suggests that these effects were relatively minor (see
below). We have noted previously that even drastic

genome size differences can be accommodated by our
method [14].
SVD-derived vector definitions for motifs and gene families
All the proteins in the dataset were recoded as overlapping
tetrapeptide frequency vectors and the resulting data
matrix was decomposed by the SVD. A total of 437 singular triplets were obtained as output. The "protein" vectors
provided in the "right" factor matrix are known to provide
reduced dimensional definitions for all proteins in the
dataset as linear combinations of the orthogonal "right"
singular vectors (rsv's). Conversely, the right singular vectors themselves frequently represent "ideal" versions of
proteins defining a given gene family [13,14] Protein vectors having the strongest projections on a given rsv are
therefore likely to represent members of a given gene family. In this analysis, the proteins with the five strongest
projections (referred to as the "top 5") for each rsv were
used to identify and summarize a number of gene families. The total number of proteins from each species that
appear in the "top 5" for all 437 right singular vectors are
listed in Table 1. Although the fraction of "top 5" proteins
identified by the SVD roughly parallels the fraction of
total proteins from each species, the mammalian proteins
tend to dominate the analysis.

Each right singular vector can potentially define two distinct gene families. In this case, the highest positive elemental values within a vector identify proteins associated
with one protein family, while the highest negative values
identify proteins associated with an anti-correlated family
(i.e. proteins that rarely share the same tetrapeptides). Frequently, however, strong family definitions are provided
for just one protein family. In this case, the anti-correlated
proteins are seen to be derived from a mixture of two or
more families. Since the choice of sign is arbitrary, strong
family definitions are equally likely to be provided by
either the positive or the negative values within a vector.
Family definitions provided by positive vector values are
denoted below using the simple vector index (e.g. 277 =
the 277th singular vector). Those provided by negative vector values are followed by an "a" (e.g. 277a). Its worth
noting at this point that protein family definitions provided by the SVD necessarily account for not only "what
is there" (tetrapeptides that form the motifs that define
the family), but also "what is not there" (tetrapeptides
excluded by that family of proteins, but likely to form
anti-correlated motifs within other families of proteins).
Protein family definitions provided by right singular vectors
An abbreviated list of 58 protein families identified within
the 437 SVD-derived singular triplets are provided in
Table 2. For each listed singular triplet, the gi# of an example protein chosen from among the "top 5" values within
the right singular vector is provided, along with its corre-

sponding Name and a Protein Description provided
within the NCBI annotation for that protein. In general,
proteins described by the more dominant singular triplets
were selected for presentation from the complete list of
437 triplets. However, some were chosen due to their historical utility for evolutionary comparisons (ribosomal
proteins) and/or their tendency to be accompanied by
strongly correlated peptide motifs (last column of Table
2). Relatively few families appear in the table due to the
fact that some vectors strongly describe only one family
rather than two, some vectors describe only families from
species that lack annotation or are poorly annotated at
NCBI (i.e. Frub proteins, Agam proteins, etc.), some vectors describe protein families listed by NCBI merely as
"unknown" or "conserved unknown", some vectors
describe proteins with weakly conserved motifs, and some
vectors describe distinct subfamilies of proteins. In the latter case, multiple right singular vectors are apparently
required in combination to describe some of the more
diverse families of proteins. Included in Table 2 is the
number of singular vectors that include the chosen example protein within its "top 5". When multiple vectors are
involved in defining multiple related subfamilies, the
most "dominant" vector (the one on which the example
protein casts its strongest projection) is listed in the first
column. Thus, some proteins are seen to have multiple
subfamily affiliations. The multiple vectors observed per
family effectively subdivide the 58 families into 179 distinct subfamilies. For instance, Table 2 includes a set of 18
ribosomal protein families described by a total of 65 singular vectors (highlighted in bold). Ribosomal proteins
are frequently well conserved, effectively aligned, and
commonly used for estimating evolutionary relationships. Their presence within our list of dominant singular
vectors suggests their utility for establishing evolutionary
relationships even in the absence of explicit alignments
and explicit a priori assignments of orthology.

The diverse families of ras proteins present within the
eukaryotic data set provide good examples of the ability of
SVD-derived singular triplets to identify and describe both
superfamilies and subfamilies of proteins. The ras proteins are well described by at least 13 vectors, including
the 6 dominant vectors highlighted in italics in Table 2.
All the "top 5" members of the protein families identified
by these 6 vectors are listed in Table 3. Vector 197a summarizes the brain-associated ras11 subfamily (Rab11),
vector 236a summarizes the Aplysia-related ras subfamily
(ApRas), vectors 277 and 277a summarize the brain-associated ras 5 subfamily (Rab5) and the complex Ha/K/Nras
subfamily (HaRas) respectively, vector 350a summarizes
the ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 subfamily
(Rac1), and vector 387a summarizes the brain-associated
ras1B subfamily (Rab1B). The most dominant ras vector,
389a, appears to describe a more generalized version of
the Rab1 subfamily, since this vector includes both Rab1A
and Rab1B proteins within the "top five". In addition, as
explained below, this vector also summarizes a high fraction of the entire set of 34 ras sequences within all
subfamilies.
For comparison, KOG and Homologen memberships are
also listed, when available, for each of the "top 5" proteins
listed in Table 3. Table 4 provides a similar comparison
for a set of four arbitrarily selected protein families unrelated to ras or to each other (potassium channel, enolase,
solute carrier protein, and ADP-ribosylation factor). Since
most of the genomes used in our study have not yet been
included within the KOG classification scheme, only fly
and human proteins have official KOG affiliations. However, we expect with high likelihood that most if not all of
the top 5 proteins listed in Tables 3 and 4 would also be
members of the particular KOG family listed for each vector. Given this, there would be a good correspondence in
Tables 3 and 4 between KOG family members and the
proteins identified by singular vectors. In contrast, the

having one of the five strongest projections ("top five") for a given singular vector are used in the comparison. Few genomes have

Homologen resource appears to provide a more selective
classification method, dividing the KOG protein families
into two or more subfamilies within which members are
more likely to represent specific orthologs.
Conserved motif definitions provided by left singular
vectors
Members of any particular ras subfamily represented by a
given right singular vector share a uniquely conserved set
of correlated tetrapeptides we have previously referred to
as a "copep motif". These motifs are explicitly described
by the corresponding "left" singular vectors (lsv's) comprising a given singular triplet. The lsv's describe these

copep motifs as linear combinations of the 160,000 possible tetrapeptides. Those with high positive values identify peptides found with high probability in the conserved
motif of a given subfamily, while those with a high negative value identify peptides excluded with high probability. Therefore, like the rsv's, the lsv's frequently describe
two distinct anti-correlated entities (in this case motifs
rather than protein families) using either positive or negative values within the vector. Using essentially the same
procedure described above for any given rsv, the tetrapeptides having the largest positive or largest negative projections on any given lsv were identified in order to provide
a focused summary of the motifs described by that vector.

For motif extraction, however, an arbitrary cut-off value
(absolute value > 0.025) was used to identify dominant
tetrapeptides.
In most cases, it is possible to cluster the resulting short
list of dominant tetrapeptides into several uninterrupted
copep strings formed by tetrapeptides that overlap in 3 of
4 consecutive amino acid positions. Using this procedure,
one long copep string was identified for each of the singular triplets listed in Table 2. The length of the identified
long copep string and its corresponding E-value (resulting
from pairwise BLAST) are provided as a summary in the
last column. The precise amino acid sequences of the long
copep strings identified for all listed vectors are provided
in a supplementary table [see Additional file 1]. The E-values listed provide a measure of the specificity with which
each corresponding protein is identified by the copep
string extracted from a given lsv. Its important to note that
the long copep string provides only an approximate summary of the lsv from which it is extracted, yet the small Evalues clearly indicate that the vast majority of the proteins identified in Table 2 are very specifically recognized
by their corresponding copep string.
Figure 1 provides a more detailed demonstration of how
correlated peptide motifs and their associated gene families are simultaneously identified and described by SVDderived singular vectors. In order to allow a clear comparison of SVD-derived motifs with alignment-derived

motifs, the dominant tetrapeptides were superimposed
over matching regions of a standard ClustalX alignment of
the 34 ras proteins identified in the "top five" of the corresponding right singular vectors listed in Table 3. In this
example, the dominant tetrapeptides extracted from the
six selected left singular vectors are demarcated within
(shaded/colored) boxes. Many of the dominant tetrapeptides are seen to form extended strings of overlapping
peptides that correspond well to conserved contiguous
regions within particular subsets of the ras proteins. For
example, vectors 350a and 236a identify and provide distinct descriptions for motifs within the Ras-related botulinum toxin C3 substrate proteins (RasC3) and the Aplysiarelated ras proteins (ApRas), respectively. The two most
dominant left singular vectors of Figure 1 (389a and
387a) describe motifs within overlapping subsets of the
nine Rab1 proteins. In addition, the most dominant left
singular vector (389a) appears to describe a highly conserved motif within the entire set of 34 ras proteins reasonably well (solid clear boxes). This vector
conspicuously identifies dominant tetrapeptides that
span the two regions of the alignment in which unbroken
strings of two or more invariant amino acids (asterisks)
are present. These two regions are known to be required
for ras GTPase activity [18]. It is notable that although
these 34 ras proteins have only one stretch with more than
two globally conserved consecutive amino acids
(DTAGQE), vector 389a is capable of describing large
regions of all 34 proteins by recognizing the latent simi-

Ras families and sub-families defined by singular vectors (labeled at right)
Figure 1
Ras families and sub-families defined by singular vectors (labeled at right). For comparison, dominant peptide strings identified
by SVD (boxes) are shown within a Clustal-X alignment. The aligned region corresponds to the first 181aa's of the 192aa
Human Rac3 protein. Protein sequences are labeled by gi# (or ensemble# for Frup). Asterisks (*) indicate globally conserved
residues. Subfamily motifs associated with negative vector values are denoted with an "a" suffix (e.g. 350a).

larity of multiple equivalent tetrapeptides. For example,
this single vector recognizes KSAL, KSCL, and KTCL (residues 18–21 of the alignment) as dominant tetrapeptides
that occupy equivalent positions within four of the six
subtypes of ras proteins (Figure 1). Vector 389a also provides a reasonably strong summary of the large number of
other ras proteins present within the genomes of these
organisms, but not included in Figure 1 (not shown). In
general, the most dominant singular vectors appear to
identify highly conserved peptides present in a high fraction of individual members of a protein family or superfamily, while the less dominant vectors appear to describe
conserved tetrapeptides present within a restricted set of
proteins comprising a subfamily.
Instead of simply providing restricted motif summaries
using the most dominant elements of the left singular vectors, we have also attempted to examine entire vectors in
order to gain a better understanding of the motifs (and
associated protein families) they describe. A reasonably
efficient method for depicting left singular vectors is presented in Figure 2, using vectors 389 and 277 as examples.
Both vectors are shown as frequency distributions (purple
bars) that summarize the approximate magnitudes of the
projections provided by all 160,000 tetrapeptides on the
vector in question. These distributions are compared to a
normal distribution having the same standard deviation
(blue bars). In both examples, a significant fraction of
tetrapeptides have high or low values in considerable
excess of that expected from a normal distribution. Many
of these also exceed the arbitrary cut-off value of 0.025
(dashed lines) used to extract the dominant tetrapeptides
that serve to summarize the corresponding motifs. Parts of
the Rab5 and HaRas motifs extracted from vector 277 are
shown in Figure 2A as overlapping dominant tetrapeptides with associated projection values. Similar motifs
extracted from vector 389 are shown in Figure 2B. In the
latter case, a motif from the large subunit ribosomal protein rpL29 represents the "anti-motif"of the Ras/Rab proteins described by the extreme vector elements of opposite
sign.
Species vectors for the production of species phylogenies
The detailed comparative information contained within
the hundreds of singular vectors and their corresponding
motifs and gene families was subsequently used to build
a species phylogeny by summing all the SVD-derived right
protein vectors separately for each organism and then
comparing the relative orientation of the resulting species
vectors [13]. Figure 3A shows the SVD-based topology
obtained for the nine eukaryotes compared in this study.
This tree supports a coelomate rather than ecdysozoan lineage. Two distinct re-sampling methods were used to estimate branch statistics for this tree. The top value of each
pair of support values for each branch shown in Figure 3A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/204

was generated using a traditional bootstrap procedure
[19]. In this case, 100 random sets of 437 re-sampled singular vectors were made and used to construct 100 species
trees. Alternatively, a novel "successive, delete one" jackknife procedure [14] was used to generate the bottom
value shown for each branch. In this case, the least dominant singular vector was removed successively (down to
10 vectors) to generate 427 ordered sets of singular vectors, and a new tree was estimated following each
removal. Although bootstrap support values for the
branches grouping arthropods with vertebrates (37%)
and worms with other metazoa (49%) are relatively weak,
support values for these branches are strong (100%) using
the modified jackknife procedure. All other branches are
strongly supported by both procedures. The branch separating Cele from the coelomates is of special interest, since
the weak bootstrap support observed (37%) might suggest a significant affinity between Cele and the arthropods
consistent with the "ecdysozoan" model (Figure 3A –
alternative branching pattern shown in red). Bootstrap
support for the alternative ecdysozoan cluster, however,
was only 24%.
Use of the "successive, delete-one" jackknife procedure as
a species tree branch statistic is justified by the fact that
SVD provides singular triplets in order of their "dominance" in explaining the data set [20]. Mathematical dominance provides an objective measure of importance that
can be utilized to weight characters. Since the modified
jackknife procedure used here deletes the least dominant
singular vectors one at a time in order, the more dominant
singular vectors (i.e. conserved motifs/families) are automatically weighted more heavily within the consensus
tree. Hence, one can argue that our novel jackknife
procedure provides stronger support for the derived phylogeny because the most dominant singular vectors generally contain stronger information about gene and species
relationships.
Poorly described proteins and species tree quality
While our SVD-based analysis technically considers all
proteins present within all nine genomes of the data set, it
is likely that accurate vector definitions are provided for
only a small fraction of these proteins. Theoretically, the
437 singular triplets could effectively describe as many as
2 × 437 = 874 protein families. However, many of these
vectors appear to best describe particular subfamilies of
larger groups of closely related proteins. Thus, the 58 protein families listed in Table 2 are each represented by anywhere from 1 to 8 triplets. Although, as mentioned earlier,
some protein families lacking clear functional annotation
were omitted from this table, it still serves to provide a
conservative lower estimate of the number of welldescribed protein families provided by the SVD.
Assuming the number of identifiable protein families in

Figure 3
SVD-based proteome phylogeny (A) of nine eukaryotes with percentage branch support
SVD-based proteome phylogeny (A) of nine eukaryotes with percentage branch support: top – bootstrap; bottom – novel jackknife. An unsupported alternative phylogeny containing the "ecdysozoan" lineage is indicated by the dashed red branches. Percentage branch support values for the various clades of the tree are also provided to the left (B) for trees built using all
proteins, as well as trees built after poorly described proteins are removed using either of two alternative vector magnitude
inclusion values (>0.005, >0.05).

our nine genome data set significantly exceeds the 58 to
179 protein families unambiguously demarcated and subdivided in our analysis, then hundreds or perhaps thousand of the poorly described proteins included in our
species vector sums might be contributing a high fraction
of "noise" to the definition of species.
In an attempt to increase the fraction of well described
proteins used to define species, proteins having poor projections on all 437 right singular vectors were ignored during the summation process. Arbitrary vector magnitude
cut-off values of 0.005 or 0.05 were applied to reduce the
number of poorly described proteins used to build species
trees. Even though the highest and most stringent cut-off
value removed the majority of proteins during summation, both new species trees had identical topologies to
that of the tree shown in Figure 3A in which all proteins
were included. Bootstrap and modified jackknife branch
support values for these tree are shown in Figure 3B along
with those derived from the inclusive analysis. The
removal of only a small fraction of poorly described proteins (cut-off = 0.005, about 103 proteins removed)
resulted in 22% bootstrap and 100% modified jackknife
support for the coelomate lineage, but 0% support for the
ecdysozoan lineage. Removal of a much higher fraction of
poorly described proteins (cut-off = .05, about 105 proteins removed) produced an equivalent result. Hence,
poorly described proteins contribute little to the support
that our analysis provides for the coelomate model.

Conclusions
As demonstrated above, an SVD-based analysis of multiple genomes automatically interprets proteins from input
genomes as potential members of a limited list of hierarchically defined protein families and subfamilies. Each
subfamily is defined in detail by one or more singular vectors as linear combinations of a large number of peptides
(160,000 tetrapeptides, in this case). Potentially, a large
number of proteomes lacking annotation can be directly
interpreted using this method, assuming a sufficient
number of annotated proteomes are included in the analysis. Although most of the genomes used in the present
analysis were already accompanied by detailed protein
annotations, formal annotations of the Frub and Agam
proteins were not readily available. Nevertheless, our
SVD-based analysis was able to provide precise protein
motif descriptions and subfamily affiliations, not only for
the six Frub or Agam proteins shown in Figure 1, but also
for any of the hundreds of other Frub or Agam proteins
exhibiting strong vector projections on any of the 437
derived singular vectors (see "SVD top five" of Table 1).
Our method bears partial resemblance to a recently
described graph-theoretic method for rapidly clustering
massive datasets of whole genome protein sequence [22].
In this case, the protein definitions generated were not
used to derive gene or species trees, but to provide for a
comprehensive clustering of all proteins into families having one or more members. The nodes of their graphs, like
the vectors from the right matrix in our analysis, represent
proteins, while the edges between nodes in their graphs,

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:204

like the angles between vectors in our analysis, contain the
distance information used to compare proteins. However,
the distance information in their analysis was obtained
ultimately from exhaustive pairwise BLAST alignments. In
contrast, our distance information was derived without
alignment, by reference to the 437 most dominant SVDderived orthonormal left singular vectors. These vectors
provide "motif models" expressed as particular linear
combinations of the 160,000 possible tetrapeptides. The
projections of these motif models on a given protein vector serve to quantitatively define the protein. Since no
more than 874 motif models would be provided by our
truncated SVD, our method would be less effective than
other methods for providing comprehensive family designations for all proteins in a dataset [22,23]. However, a
high fraction of these protein families are found to contain only one or a few members [22]. Singletons and small
families would generally provide unimportant contributions to relative species definitions, since the majority of
species would lack a homolog for comparison. Hence
small or poorly conserved protein families, presumably
represented by the weaker singular triplets in a complete
SVD, are profitably ignored in our analysis.
Although our descriptive analysis of singular triplets (e.g.
Table 2, Figure 1) suggests that the protein vectors in our
high dimensional definition space can be effectively clustered, we have not applied any specific clustering
algorithm. Hence no explicit clustering of proteins, equivalent to the identification of orthologs or homologs, is
required. Nevertheless, the application of a clustering
algorithm to our vector based symmetric protein distances
is clearly feasible and results in accurate clustering for a
high fraction of proteins. In fact, the accuracy with which
proteins are clustered into known families via Neighbor
Joining was used previously to establish optimal dimensionality for a well characterized data set [13]. In addition,
unlike other methods, our method provides a straightforward vector addition mechanism for converting relative
protein definitions into relative species definitions for the
production of species phylogenies.

nism exists for extracting, summarizing, and interpreting
this information in terms of motif and gene family definitions. This high stringency method provides a low false
positive rate (strong connections between probable
orthologous peptides), but comes at the expense of a high
false negative rate (little or no recognition of other homologous regions within proteins). For organisms exhibiting
a significant level of horizontal gene transfer [24-26],
models for motifs and protein families may be crucial
tools for identifying "borrowed" genes and assessing their
impact on phylogenetic hypotheses.
Our SVD-based species tree supports the traditional "coelomate" model of animal phylogeny. Other large-scale,
genome level analyses also tend to support this model
[27,28]. The alternative "ecdysozoan" model is supported
by comparative analyses of rRNA and analyses that
include morphological characters [28,29]. Although
genome-scale analyses should perhaps carry considerable
weight due to the higher fraction of "total information"
used as input, the separation of "signal" from "noise" represents a serious hurdle for these methods. Our method
represents a uniquely independent solution that provides
a noise-reduced simultaneous global comparison of all
proteins within multiple genomes without the need for
alignments and without the prior application of operational definitions of orthology. As such, it provides a global perspective on gene and species relationships that is
based on a much larger subset of information than that
normally used. Since it is a non-alignment method, it provides a fundamentally different kind of analysis, and to
the extent that the resulting species phylogenies agree
with those provided by other analyses that depend upon
highly filtered subsets of aligned orthologs or close
homologs, we may derive an additional degree of confidence in these relationships. However, the balanced comparison of a large number of additional whole genome
sequences from a variety of animals will likely be required
in order to produce an unambiguous and universally
accepted animal phylogeny.

Methods
Alternative non-alignment methods exist for comparing
sequences [reviewed in [17]]. Some of these methods may
prove to be scalable and adaptable to the problem of
whole genome phylogeny. For example, a comprehensive
bacterial phylogeny was recently derived using species
vectors that include a set of background corrected pentapeptide or hexapeptide (K-tuple) frequency values [12].
Although apparently effective for producing global species phylogenies, this method fails to provide quantitatively comparable protein definitions or interpretable
predictions for conserved motifs. While many phylogenetically informative pentapeptides and hexapeptides are
likely derived from homologs or orthologs, no mecha-

Datasets
Complete reference protein sequences for nine whole
eukaryotic genomes ranging from yeast to man were compiled into a single dataset (Figure 1a). Curated protein
sequence files were obtained from NCBI dated as follows:
human (Hsap) 10/10/03, mouse (Mmus) 10/31/03, rat
(Rnov) 9/23/03, mosquito (Agam) 10/24/03, fly (Dmel)
10/24/03, worm (Cele) 11/12/03, malaria (Pfal) 10/17/
02, and yeast (Scer) 11/12/03. Pufferfish (Frub) protein
sequences dated 8/26/02 were obtained from the DOE
Joint Genome Institute.

Peptide frequencies and SVD
Each protein sequence in the dataset was recoded as a high
dimensional vector containing raw frequencies for each of
the 160,000 possible tetrapeptides. Previous work has
established that although tripeptides work well for estimating similarities between highly divergent proteins
contained within small sets of viral genomes [15],
tetrapeptides work better for larger data sets derived from
vertebrate mitochondrial genomes or whole bacterial
genomes [13,14]. Although pentapeptides also worked
well with the mitochondrial datasets (unpublished), our
computational capacity precluded the use of pentapeptides (3.2 million patterns) and larger data sets, like the
one used here. Following a log-entropy transformation
[21], the singular value decomposition of the resulting
data matrix was computed. The log-entropy transformation tends to down-weight evenly distributed high frequency peptides that are likely sources of homoplasy.
After 1500 Lanczos iterations (residual errors less than 106), three output matrices were obtained, consisting of 437
singular triplets (left and right singular vectors and their
corresponding singular value). Each left singular vector
produced by the SVD defines one or two conserved motifs
within the dataset as particular linear combinations of
tetrapeptides [13,14]. Similarly, each of the right singular
vectors defines one or two conserved gene families (or
subfamilies) as particular linear combinations of proteins.
Each gene family identified by a given right singular vector
contains motifs described by the corresponding left singular vector. Two distinct motif/families are frequently identified per triplet, since each triplet describes both a
correlated motif/family (positive values) and an anti-correlated motif/family (negative values).
Vector based motif and protein family models
"Dominant" vector elements (absolute values in excess of
0.025) were extracted from the left singular vectors and
summarized using the C++ program "Copepx" [14]. These
values were associated with the most "dominant" (i.e.
highly conserved) tetrapeptides found within the motifs
described by a given left vector. In addition, the "top five"
positive and "top five" negative elements were extracted
from the right singular vectors and summarized using the
C++ program "Coprotx". These values represent the most
dominant members of the gene families described by a
given right vector.

tional bootstrap procedure [19], and a modified jackknife
procedure. For the bootstrap, 100 random sets of 437
resampled singular vectors were made and used to construct 100 species trees. For the "successive, delete one"
jackknife procedure [14], the least dominant singular vector was removed successively (down to 10 vectors) to generate 427 ordered sets of singular vectors, and a new tree
was estimated following each removal.
