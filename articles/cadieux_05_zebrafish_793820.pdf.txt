Abstract
Background: Progranulin is an epithelial tissue growth factor (also known as proepithelin,
acrogranin and PC-cell-derived growth factor) that has been implicated in development, wound
healing and in the progression of many cancers. The single mammalian progranulin gene encodes a
glycoprotein precursor consisting of seven and one half tandemly repeated non-identical copies of
the cystine-rich granulin motif. A genome-wide duplication event hypothesized to have occurred
at the base of the teleost radiation predicts that mammalian progranulin may be represented by
two co-orthologues in zebrafish.
Results: The cDNAs encoding two zebrafish granulin precursors, progranulins-A and -B, were
characterized and found to contain 10 and 9 copies of the granulin motif respectively. The cDNAs
and genes encoding the two forms of granulin, progranulins-1 and -2, were also cloned and
sequenced. Both latter peptides were found to be encoded by precursors with a simplified
architecture consisting of one and one half copies of the granulin motif. A cDNA encoding a
chimeric progranulin which likely arises through the mechanism of trans-splicing between grn1 and
grn2 was also characterized. A non-coding RNA gene with antisense complementarity to both grn1
and grn2 was identified which may have functional implications with respect to gene dosage, as well
as in restricting the formation of the chimeric form of progranulin. Chromosomal localization of
the four progranulin (grn) genes reveals syntenic conservation for grna only, suggesting that it is the
true orthologue of mammalian grn. RT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis of
zebrafish grns during development reveals that combined expression of grna and grnb, but not grn1
and grn2, recapitulate many of the expression patterns observed for the murine counterpart. This
includes maternal deposition, widespread central nervous system distribution and specific
localization within the epithelial compartments of various organs.
Conclusion: In support of the duplication-degeneration-complementation model of duplicate
gene retention, partitioning of expression between grna and grnb was observed in the intermediate
cell mass and yolk syncytial layer, respectively. Taken together these expression patterns suggest
that the function of an ancestral grn gene has been devolved upon four paralogues in zebrafish.

Background
In mammals, a single progranulin gene, also known as
proepithelin, acrogranin and PC-cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF), encodes a glycoprotein precursor exhibiting
pleiotropic tissue growth factor activity (reviewed in [14]). Progranulin is secreted in an intact form [5-8], or
undergoes proteolysis leading to the release of its constituent peptides, the granulins [9-11]. Individual granulins
have an approximate molecular weight of 6 kDa, and are
structurally defined by the presence of 12 cysteines
arranged
in
a
characteristic
motif:
X2–3CX5–
CX5CCX8CCX6CCX5CCX4CX5–6CX2 [12]. Comparison of
6
the biosynthetic origin of granulin peptides in various
mammals reveals that all are commonly derived from a
precursor composed of one amino-terminal half followed
by seven non-identical copies of the granulin motif.
A role of progranulin in mammalian embryogenesis has
been suggested. The exogenous addition of recombinant
progranulin to eight-cell stage mouse embryos grown in
culture ex vivo accelerates the onset of cavitation, stimulates the rate of blastocoel expansion, and leads to an
increase in the number of trophectoderm cells compared
to controls [13]. Conversely, the use of a progranulin
function-blocking antibody arrests growth and prohibits
embryo implantation [13,14]. These results are consistent
with the growth-promoting activity of progranulin upon
epithelial cells in vitro.
Despite these advances, the evolutionary history and phylogenetic distribution of the progranulin gene outside the
mammalian radiation remain largely unexplored. In
order to shed light on this issue, and to establish a model
for studying the functional contribution of progranulin to
vertebrate development, we undertook the characterization of the biosynthetic origins of progranulins in the
zebrafish. The widely documented evidence in favor of a
pan-genomic duplication event at the base of the teleost
radiation [15], commonly referred to as 3R, predicts that
the single mammalian progranulin gene will likely be represented by two zebrafish co-orthologues [16,17]. Results
reported here demonstrate that, in zebrafish, progranulins
arise as members of an extended gene family represented
by two distinct architectures, in excess of that predicted by
3R.
Comparative chromosomal mapping of the various progranulin genes (grns) was performed to assist in the establishment of an orthologous relationship to their
mammalian counterpart and to provide a point of reference to discuss the evolutionary origins of the distinct progranulin architectures. In support of the duplicationdegeneration-complementation (DDC) model [18] gene
expression analysis of the zebrafish progranulins reveals
spatio-temporal divergence among the different family

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

members, possibly reflecting extensive functional devolution of an ancestral form. Also, the occurrence of natural
antisense transcription to some grns suggests that gene
dosage may have influenced the retention of extra grn paralogues in zebrafish.

Results
Evidence for a progranulin multigene family in teleosts
A previous study indicated that major forms of granulin
peptides found in hematopoietic organs of carp, Cyprinus
carpio, differ in their relative abundance [19]. Specifically,
extracts of carp spleen contained granulin-1 only, while
the head kidney contained granulins-1, -2, and -3, arguing
that some granulins found in teleost fish, unlike those
found in mammals, have different biosynthetic origins
[19]. We revisited the issue of the sole occurrence of granulin-1 in carp spleen and confirmed the earlier report.
However, granulin-1 was found to co-purify with another
member of the granulin family (Figure 1, Panel A).
Sequencing of this peptide suggested that it is a close
homologue of mammalian granulin-A, sharing 58% iden-

Comparison of the deduced translated sequences for zebrafish progranulin-1 and progranulin-2
Comparison of the deduced translated sequences for zebrafish progranulin-1 and progranulin-2. Two zebrafish
cDNAs sharing 92.3% identity (grn1 and grn2), each possessing a 441 nucleotide-long open reading frame (ORF), encode
deduced precursors consisting of one full and one amino-terminal half granulin peptide, with a calculated mass of 14.5 kDa and
14.8 kDa, respectively. Both carry an identical signal peptide (italics), whose predicted cleavage site is indicated by an arrow.

tity with the human peptide (Figure 1, Panel B). The isolation of a carp granulin peptide homologous to
mammalian granulin-A suggested that teleosts synthesize
a protein equivalent to mammalian progranulin. Carp is
a tetraploid species known to express multiple copies of
closely related genes that can complicate the study of the
origins of multigene families [20]. Therefore, we chose to
study the structure and expression of granulin genes in the
zebrafish, a closely-related diploid teleost of the cyprinoforme order [21].
Zebrafish progranulins are represented by two distinct
architectures
Progranulin-1 and progranulin-2
A PCR-based strategy using degenerate primers based on
the amino acid sequence of carp granulin-1 led to the
cloning of two zebrafish cDNAs sharing 92.3% identity
and encoding structures homologous to carp granulin-1
and granulin-2, respectively (see Materials and Methods,
Figure 2 and Additional File 1). In contrast with mammalian progranulins, the deduced architecture of these
zebrafish precursors, named progranulin-1 (grn1) and
progranulin-2 (grn2), consist of one full and one aminoterminal half granulin-like repeats only (Figure 2). Unlike
progranulins A and B (see below), no potential N-glycosylation sites are found within the predicted progranulin1 or progranulin-2 polypeptide structures. Subsequent
cloning of the respective genes for grn1 and grn2 revealed
that each is encoded on five exons (as shown for progranulin-1 in Additional Files 2 and 3), confirming that they
are derived from distinct transcriptional units. The
genomic sequences encoding grn1 and grn2 are interrupted by short introns in the exact equivalent positions
to that observed within the mammalian grn gene [22,23].
Sequences at the splice junctions for the grn1, grn2 and
ASgrn1-2 genes are depicted in Additional File 4.
Hybrid grn RNA
A cDNA encoding a hybrid progranulin identical in size
to, and sharing 95.6% nucleotide sequence identity with

both grn1 and grn2, was uncovered through our cloning
strategy (see Materials and Methods). The nucleotide substitutions for hybrid progranulin are non-randomly distributed among the exons for grn1 and grn2, indicating
that it is likely derived from the joining of the first two
exons of grn1 with exons 3, 4 and 5 of grn2 (Figure 3 and
Additional File 5). A hybrid of the opposite character was
not detected (i.e. exons 1 and 2 of grn2 fused to exons 3,
4 and 5 of grn1). No evidence was found to suggest the
existence of additional genomic sequences corresponding
to grn1 or grn2, raising the possibility of a post-transcriptional mechanism underlying the origin of this chimeric
structure.
Antisense progranulin1-2 gene
During the cloning of grn1, genomic sequences were used
to perform BLAST searches for sequences deposited at
NCBI [24]. An EST was detected (GenBank accession
AW777232) whose sequence was an exact match to a portion of the grn1 gene, but in the reverse complement orientation. The full characterization of this EST, designated
ASgrn1-2, revealed that it is spliced and shares exonic
complementarity to exons 2 and 3, in addition to flanking
intronic sequences, of both grn1 and grn2 genes (Figure 3
and Additional File 6). This observation suggested that
grn2 is located upstream of grn1 in a head-to-tail organization, thus providing strong support for trans-splicing
between the grn1 and grn2 primary transcripts as a mechanism for the genesis of the hybrid progranulin RNA (Figure 3).

In addition to its partial complementarity to grn1 and
grn2, the last exon of the ASgrn1-2 gene (corresponding to
nucleotides 1015 to 1989 of the cDNA) shares a high
degree of sequence conservation with the tzf transposon
[25], a subclass belonging to the Tc1/mariner superfamily
of class II DNA mobile elements [25]. However, this
mobile element is in the reverse complement orientation
within the antisense transcript, and has undergone extensive mutations resulting from nucleotide insertions, dele-

Genomic organization of zebrafish grn1, grn2 and their complementary antisense gene
Genomic organization of zebrafish grn1, grn2 and their complementary antisense gene. Zebrafish grn1 and grn2
genes are found in tandem in a head-to-tail orientation and share an identical exonic organization (exons 1–5, orange and blue
boxes, respectively), but differ in their respective intron lengths (A, C, D). The spliced and polyadenylated non-protein coding
ASgrn1-2 is encoded on four exons (pink boxes) and shares exon/intron complementarity to both grn1 and grn2 (see text for
details). Shown on top is a schematic representation of the chimeric progranulin transcript, suggesting trans-splicing as a mechanism for its generation. Bars (-) above or below exons indicate the relative position of primer pairs (grn1+2 forward and
reverse; ASgrn1-2 forward and reverse) used for discriminating between ASgrn1-2 and combined grn1/grn2 expression using

tions and point mutations (Additional File 7). Thus,
ASgrn1-2 never possessed the ability to encode a translatable transposase protein, nor does it have a clearly predictable ORF in view of the presence of several termination
codons in all three possible reading frames. For these reasons, this naturally occurring antisense transcript is considered to belong to the category of non-coding RNA
genes.
The zebrafish co-orthologues of mammalian progranulin
Based on the finding of a carp granulin peptide whose
sequence was homologous to mammalian forms of granulin (Figure 1, panel B), it was reasoned that these observations could be extended to the zebrafish. Using a
strategy identical to that used for cloning a cDNA encoding granulin-1, we isolated a partial cDNA encoding a
deduced zebrafish granulin-A peptide (data not shown).
BLAST searches using this sequence retrieved two distinct
ESTs from GenBank databases (accession AW174591 and
AW184435), the former being identical to our cloned
sequence. Sequencing of these cDNAs, referred to as progranulin-a (grna) and progranulin-b (grnb) respectively,
revealed that each encodes a deduced granulins precursor
bearing 10 and 9 tandemly repeated and non-identical
granulin domains (Figure 4), demonstrating that the

zebrafish progranulin repertoire is not limited to the simplified grn gene structures.
Zebrafish progranulin-A and progranulin-B are 48.6%
identical over their aligned sequences, and each is similarly related to human progranulin with 44.8% and
42.9% identity, respectively. As expected, sequence conservation is seen primarily within the aligned granulin
domains of the zebrafish precursors (Figure 4). However,
the deduced granulins within the zebrafish grnA and grnB
precursors cannot be aligned strictly on the basis of the
mammalian nomenclature (i.e. in the order granulin-G, F, -B, -A, -C, -D, -E) [5,26-28]. Indeed, progranulin-A contains five granulin peptides (domains 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) whose
sequences bear close sequence similarity with oneanother and with that of human granulin-A. In addition,
zebrafish progranulin-A encodes a deduced granulin
structure (domain 2) displaying the modified cysteine
motif found in human granulin G, which is characterized
by the absence of cysteine residues 4 and 7 (Figure 4).
Northern blot analysis
The size of the cloned sense and antisense zebrafish progranulin transcripts was assessed by northern blot analysis
(Additional File 8). With the exception of the putative

Sequence comparison of zebrafish progranulin-A and -B with human progranulin. Amino acid sequences were
deduced from the cloned grna and grnb zebrafish cDNAs. Unlike human progranulin, which carries one-half and seven granulin
peptide motifs, zebrafish progranulin-a and progranulin-b harbour 10 and 9 full copies of the granulin motif (boxed), and possess distinct putative signal peptides (italics). Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW method, and gaps were introduced as
dashed lines for optimal alignment. Identical residues are indicated by an asterisk. Numbers on the right represent amino acid
position. Human granulin motif nomenclature is listed (right).
ASgrna (see below), the observed transcript sizes were in
agreement with those predicted from cloned sequences.
However, many pre-mRNA transcripts of higher than
expected molecular weight were identified for several family members. Only grnb demonstrated the presence of
splice variants of unknown composition.
Chromosomal mapping of zebrafish grns
The chromosomal localization of each grn gene was determined using the LN54 radiation-reduced mapping panel
[29]. Primers are listed in Additional File 9. grn1 and grn2
are closely linked on linkage group (LG) 19, 5.98 centiRays (cR) from EST clone fb47h01 in the vicinity of the
simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) marker

z6661 consistent with their physical proximity deduced
from the cloning of a chimeric transcript (Figure 5). Grna
is located on LG3, 9.92 cR from SSLP marker z22516, in a
region showing a clear syntenic correspondence with the
chromosomal position of murine and human grn (Figure
5). In contrast, grnb maps next to SSLP marker z9325, and
is 9.76 cR from EST fc18g06, located on LG24 (data not
shown), and is not part of a known block of conserved
synteny with zebrafish LG3 or human chromosome 17.

Figure 5
Chromosomal assignment of zebrafish grn genes
Chromosomal assignment of zebrafish grn genes. Zebrafish grna is located close to genes (HoxB cluster, dlx8, pyy) that
form an extensive bloc of conserved synteny with human chromosome 17 (Hsa17), indicating an orthologous relationship to
human progranulin (grn). Zebrafish grnb, in contrast, maps to LG24 in a region devoid of syntenic correspondence to zebrafish
LG3 or Hsa17 (data not shown). Grn1 and grn2 map to LG19, in a region that finds scattered synteny to two human chromosomes (Hsa 6 and Hsa 7). The presence of grn1 and grn2 on a zebrafish chromosome bearing the HoxA cluster, npy and dlx6
genes (i.e. paralogues of genes linked to zebrafish grna and human grn), suggests that grn1 or grn2 may have originated in concert with the mechanism leading to emergence of duplicated Hox clusters at the base of the vertebrate radiation. Map position

bers of the zebrafish grn gene family in adult tissues. A list
of primers used and size of the respective amplicons is
listed in Additional File 10. Both grna and grnb are
expressed in all adult tissues examined, including the gills,
heart, multiple visceral organs, and at modest levels in the
brain (Figure 6, panel A). Comparison of the expression of
the smaller zebrafish paralogues (grn1 and grn2) relative
to their mutual antisense gene in selected adult zebrafish

organs (Figure 6, panel B), showed that the combined
expression of grn1 and grn2 was qualitatively similar to
that of grna and grnb (Figure 6, panels B and C). In contrast to the widespread combined expression of grn1 and
grn2, low levels of ASgrn1-2 transcripts are detected in the
blood and intestine (Figure 6, panel B). In agreement with
the observed carp peptide expression profiles [19], the
zebrafish spleen expresses grn1 only (Figure 6, panel C).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

In tissues that display overlapping expression, grn1 is the
predominant form in the heart and intestine, while the
eyes express higher levels of grn2 (Figure 6, panel C). Surprisingly, low abundance of the hybrid grn transcript, the
authenticity of which was confirmed by sequencing of the
amplicon, is detected exclusively in the intestine (Figure 6,
panel C).
Developmental expression of Zebrafish grn genes
Since divergence in expression patterns between duplicated genes is suspected to promote their retention [18],
the temporal regulation of grn gene expression between
the two grn gene classes during development was investigated by RT-PCR. Transcripts for both grna and grnb are
maternally provided although grnb is more abundant
(Figure 7, panel A). This trend continues following commencement of zygotic transcription until mid-epiboly
(shield stage) where both transcripts are present at similar
levels (Figure 7, panel A). In contrast, combined grn1 and
grn2 expression is first noticeable during the late pharyngula period by 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) (Figure 7,
panel A). When using an increased number of cycling, the
combined expression of grn1 and grn2 is detected as early
as 30 hpf, while antisense transcript levels remain too low
for detection using conventional ethidium bromide staining (Figure 7, panel B). Southern blot analysis demonstrates that antisense transcription occurs, albeit weakly,
at 72 hpf and becomes more evident by 120 hpf (Figure 7,
panel B).

in various organs. Panel B: A comparison of the combined
expression of grn1 and grn2 (grn1+2) relative to their antisense transcript. An increased number of cycles was used in
the PCR to allow for the detection of ASgrn1-2 transcripts.
Panel C: grn1, grn2 and hybrid grn are differentially regulated
with the latter expressed only in the intestine. Results shown
were generated using the forward and reverse1 primer pair
(Additional File 10). Identical results were obtained using the
forward and reverse2 primer pair (not shown). Hybrid grn
was amplified using a grn1 forward and grn2 reverse primer
combination. No product was obtained using a grn2 forward
and grn1 reverse primer pair (not shown). Number of cycles
for each reaction is indicated. Amplified PCR products were
analyzed by electrophoresis next to a 100-bp DNA ladder.
No template and amplification of actin mRNA were used as
negative and positive controls, respectively. Similar results
were obtained with two other experiments.

Assessment of zebrafish grn gene expression by whole
mount in situ hybridization
In order to evaluate the relationship between sense and
antisense transcription, and to gain insights into the
potential contributions of the four grn paralogues to
development, the spatio-temporal expression of zebrafish
grns was monitored by whole-mount in situ hybridization. For all stages examined, sense and antisense riboprobes for sonic hedgehog were used as experimental
controls since the tissue expression of this gene is discrete
and well documented [30]. No non-specific hybridization
signal for sonic hedgehog was detected (data not shown).
Unless stated otherwise, the respective sense riboprobes to
grna and grnb did not give rise to detectable signals.
Grna and grnb
The low abundance of transcripts for grna relative to grnb
revealed by RT-PCR during early embryogenesis (Figure 7,
panel A) is reflected in the relative signal intensity for
these transcripts by whole-mount in situ hybridization
from the 4-cell to late segmentation stage (18–20 hpf)
(Figure 8, panel A and B, a–f). Weak, ubiquitous grna
expression can first be detected by 12 hpf (6 somite stage),
with slightly stronger signal in the hypoblast (Figure 8,
panel A, c, d). Grnb expression remains similarly ubiqui-

tous, however defined regions of heightened expression
are evident including in the hypoblast, central nervous
system (CNS), optic epithelial layers, ear primordium, lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) and tailbud (Figure 8, panel
B, c, d and data not shown). As the embryo matures to late
segmentation stages (18–20 hpf), low levels of grna
expression become confined to the eyes, tectum and tailbud (Figure 8, panel A, e, f), whereas grnb expression
undergoes further regionalization within the eyes and
CNS, the caudal region of the notochord and surrounding
adaxial cells, and in the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) (Figure
8, panel B, e, f). During the pharyngula period (24–48
hpf) and hatching stage (72 hpf), overlapping expression
patterns between grna and grnb include the pharyngeal
and anterior visceral endoderm, the skin epidermis (Figure 8, panels A and B, g–i), and the pronephric tubules,
albeit at modest levels (data not shown). In addition,
both genes are expressed temporally within the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER) between 36 and 72 hpf (Figure 8,
panels A and B, h, i and data not shown). Divergent
expression of the zebrafish co-orthologues of mammalian
progranulin is also notable during this period (24–72
hpf). For instance, only grna is strongly expressed in the
intermediate cell mass (ICM) caudal region, the lens and
retina as well as the tectum of the 24 hpf embryo (Figure
8, panel A, g). Grna is also uniquely expressed at low levels within the forming head vasculature and aorta at 48
hpf (Figure 8, panel A, h–i and data not shown), and
exhibits relatively increased leukocytic expression from 48
to 72 hpf (Figure 8, panel A, h–k). In contrast to that
observed for grna, grnb is expressed within the YSL and
often found concentrated at the end of the yolk extension.
Sustained high levels of grnb were observed within the
brain at all stages examined (Figure 8, panel B, g–k) and
in the swim bladder by 72 hpf (Figure 8, panel B, k). Patterns observed during the hatching period generally persist and are accentuated in the 5 day-old larva (Figure 9,
panels A and B). In addition, grna can be detected in the
epithelial lining of various visceral organs, in particular
the pharynx, intestine, swim bladder and pronephric
ducts (Figure 9, panel A, a). Weak staining in the dorsal
aorta but not the posterior cardinal vein can sometimes be
noticed in whole-mount and through sectioning of the
animal (Figure 9, panel A, a). Likewise, grnb is widely
expressed in the visceral region of the larval stage animal,
in particular the intestine, pancreas and YSL (Figure 8 and
9). Weak expression is also detected for both genes in the
olfactory epithelium and in the presumptive thymus as
bilateral patches located caudal to the eyes (data not
shown).
The sense riboprobe corresponding to grna but not grnb
detects staining in the brain, intestine and pronephros at
this stage (Figure 9, panel A and B, b), suggesting either
non-specific hybridization or the presence of an antisense

Developmental expression analysis of zebrafish grna and grnb mRNAs by whole mount in situ hybridization
Developmental expression analysis of zebrafish grna and grnb mRNAs by whole mount in situ hybridization. An
ontogeny of expression conducted for grna (A) and grnb (B) revealed similar expression patterns for these genes from fertilization to late segmentation stage (a–f), with grna being weaker than grnb. At the 4-cell stage (a) and 50% epiboly (b) ubiquitous
expression is observed for grnb only. A lateral view of the 6-somite stage embryo (c) reveals discernable ubiquitous expression
above background levels for grna, and increased grnb expression in the epithelium of the eye primordium and CNS, as well as
the caudal region. In a dorsal view of the same animals (d), caudal expression in the axial mesoderm (arrow) is observed for
both genes, whereas only grnb is detected in the paraxial mesoderm (arrowheads). Lateral (e) and frontal (f) views of the late
somitogenesis stage embryo (18–20 hpf) show continued expression in the eye primordium, CNS and tailbud for both genes.
In addition, grnb can be detected in the YSL (arrow) (e) and the adaxial cells (arrowheads) (f) flanking the axial mesoderm. At
24 hpf (g), grna expression is found in the tectum and eye retina, in a diffuse pattern in the anterior endoderm (arrowhead) and
in a punctuate pattern within the ventral tail region of the ICM (arrow), whereas elevated expression persists for grnb in the
forebrain, midbrain and ventral hindbrain region, the eyes, as well as in the YSL, concentrated at the tip of the yolk extension
(arrow). In a lateral view at 48 hpf (h), grna expression in the ICM extends rostrally, is detected in the head vasculature, and is
now apparent in the skin epithelium, whereas in a lateral view (i) both grna and grnb are transiently expressed in the AER of
the pectoral fin buds (arrows). At 72 hpf (j), grna, but not grnb, is expressed in presumed dispersed leukocytes, while in a dorsolateral view (k), grnb can be detected in the swim bladder (arrow). AE, anterior endoderm; AER, apical ectodermal ridge of

ment orientation. Three unidirectionally cloned ESTs
(accessions CD585878, CD585963 and CD596001) were
all revealed upon sequencing to correspond to a 914
nucleotide long cDNA sharing perfect complementarity to
nucleotides 2701–3614 of the grna cDNA (Additional File
11, panel A). This sequence corresponds to the 3'UTR
region of the grna gene and is not bisected by an intron at
the genomic level. This precludes the conclusion that this
candidate antisense transcript is not an artifact of cloning.
To confirm its directionality, cDNA was synthesized for
subsequent PCR amplification using a primer located
within the 3'UTR exon of grna that shared complementarity to ASgrna (sense relative to grna) or using another
primer that was located downstream of the cloned ASgrna
sequence and within a known intron for grna (Additional
File 11, panel A). This RT-PCR strategy suggests that the
ASgrna deduced from cloned EST sequences may represent a splice variant, and that antisense transcription
extends further in the 3'direction (Additional File 11,
panel B).
Grn1 and grn2
As expected from the RT-PCR data (Figure 7, panel A),
expression for grn1 or grn2 is not detected by in situ
hybridization in early development (data not shown).
Expression of grn1 is detected in the intestine and the pharyngeal region of the 3-day old animal (Figure 10, panel
A) and at very low levels in the pronephros (data not
shown). Grn2 does not share this expression pattern and
is detected at low levels in the proctodeum (Figure 10,
panel B) and is often detected in a few sporadic peripheral
leukocytes (data not shown). In contrast hybrid grn is
detected at relatively high levels in the proctodeum. (Figure 10, panel C). This specific expression pattern is confirmed by examining the signal obtained using sense
riboprobes corresponding to grn1 and grn2 that, after prolonged exposure, detect weak signals from their complementary transcript (ASgrn1-2) in the pharyngeal region of
these animals (Figure 10, panels D and E). Notably, the
use of a sense riboprobe corresponding to hybrid grn (Figure 10, panel F) does not replicate the expression pattern
observed for ASgrn1-2 (Figure 10, panel D and E).

In the 5 day-old larva, specific grn1 expression is observed
in the intestine and the swim bladder, whereas low levels
can be seen in the pharynges (Figure 11A–C). Elevated
levels of expression for grn2 in the brain, the pharyngeal
jaw region, and in presumed peripheral leukocytes (Figure
11D–F), contrast with the pattern observed for grn1.
However, both genes share higher levels of expression in
the anterior or head kidneys and pronephric ducts (Figure
11B and 11E). In situ hybridization of cross sections of the
animals indicates that grn1 and grn2 expression, like that
of grna and grnb, occurs in the epithelial lining of the visceral organs (data not shown). The chimeric transcript

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

remained restricted to the proctodeum where it is
expressed more abundantly than grn2, and was not
detected in leukocytes at this stage (Figure 11G). In turn,
the antisense gene to grn1 and grn2 is expressed in the
brain, swim bladder, and the middle segment of the intestine (Figure 11H).

Discussion
Zebrafish progranulins: simplified molecular forms and
orthologues of the mammalian gene
The granulin peptide family was originally discovered as a
component of the granule fraction of mammalian phagocytic leukocytes. A series of related cysteine-rich peptides
(designated granulins A, B, C and D) were purified from
extracts of human neutrophils [9]. The definition of the
structure of human progranulin as a glycoprotein bearing
multiple copies of the granulin motif made it apparent
that granulin peptides are generated through proteolytic
cleavage of this precursor within the phagolysosomal
compartment of the neutrophil. This explains the roughly
equimolar ratios observed for members of the granulin
family that are co-packaged within this subcellular compartment. The hematopoietic tissues (spleen and head
kidney) of the carp (Cyprinus carpio) were also shown to
be abundant sources of three granulin-like peptides (granulins-1, -2 and -3) [19]. However, the non-stoichiometric
ratios observed for carp granulins-1,-2 and -3 suggested
that the granulin gene family in this teleost species may
expand beyond the prototypic single grn gene found in
mammals. Specifically, carp spleen contains mainly granulin-1, whereas granulins-1, -2 and -3 were found in
extracts of the head kidney (Belcourt et al. 1993). To simplify the identification of teleost granulin gene family
members, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) was chosen based
on its usefulness as a model of vertebrate development
and disease.

The presence of extra gene paralogues in teleost fish has
been extensively documented, often [15,31,32] but not
invariably supporting [33,34] the hypothesis that the
actinopterygian (ray-finned) lineage underwent an additional round of genome duplication (3R) subsequent to
diverging from the sarcopterygian (lobe-finned) lineage
approximately 450 mya. Specific examples include the
Hox clusters [16,35], the annexins [36], the claudins [37]
and the Nodal-related genes squint and cyclops [38]. Further, comparative chromosomal mapping studies have
shown that duplicated zebrafish genes often reside on distinct chromosomes that exhibit extensive blocs of conserved synteny with their mammalian counterpart
[39,40]. Using this approach, it has been estimated that
approximately 20% of human genes may be represented
by two co-orthologues in the genome of zebrafish [41].

that these genes display. However, it is unlikely that grn1
and grn2 arose from the postulated whole genome duplication event corresponding to 3R since they were found to
be localized in tandem on LG19 (Figure 5). It is notable
that both grn1 and grn2 are linked to a Hox cluster and dlx
gene paralogues, similar to that observed for grna. This
suggests that a smaller grn may have originated coincidentally with the duplication of a Hox-bearing chromosome
in a primordial species. Evidence suggests that this putative structure would then have been retained within the
teleosts but lost within the sarcopterygian line of evolution leading to mammals.

At 120 hpf grna (A) exhibits widespread expression in the
visceral region, including the pronephric kidneys (arrowheads

grnb (B) remains expressed in the YSL and pancreas (arrows
in section 1) and is strong in the proctodeum region of the
intestine (arrow in section 2). At this stage, a hybridization
signal for the sense riboprobe to grna, but not grnb, is
detected in the brain, intestine and pronephric ducts (b).

Analysis of progranulin expression by RT-PCR
The DDC model predicts that an important driving force
behind the retention of duplicated genes is the devolution
of an ancestral function onto the resultant pair through
quantitative and qualitative changes in gene expression
which, when combined, may reflect the sum of the ancestral expression pattern [18]. Thus, it was of interest to
determine the extent of expression partitioning and overlap between the two grn gene classes during development
by RT-PCR and to compare these patterns to those known
for the mammalian counterpart.

As predicted by 3R, we demonstrate that grns are members
of an extended gene family in zebrafish. We have identified two deduced precursors, progranulins A and B, harbouring 10 and 9 granulin peptide repeats respectively
that bear close structural and sequence relationship to
human progranulin (Figure 4). Grna was localized to a
region of LG3 known to show syntenic correspondence to
where human grn is found on human chromosome 17
(Figure 5). Grnb was localized to LG 24 rather than being
positioned on LG12, predicted to bear synteny with LG3
[40]. Despite this apparent discrepancy, a co-orthologous
relationship between grna and grnb relative to mammalian grn is supported by their sequence conservation as
well as their extensive overlapping expression patterns
observed during development.

As an initial survey of the differential expression patterns
of the zebrafish grns, we conducted semi-quantitative RTPCR analyses using adult tissues and staged embryos. Similar to the well documented widespread expression pattern of human [26,27,42], rat [28], mouse and guinea pig
[5]grns in several tissues and cell lines of epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic origin, both grna and grnb
were observed to be expressed ubiquitously in several
adult zebrafish organs. In contrast, grn1 and grn2 exhibit
a more restricted pattern of expression. It was previously
shown that carp granulin-1 and granulin-2 peptides are
differently distributed in the spleen and head kidneys of
the carp [19]. Interestingly, RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that the expression of the homologous structures in
zebrafish were similarly uncoupled at the level of mRNA,
(Figure 6, panel C), reflected in a lack of detectable
zebrafish grn2 expression in adult spleen. Also, grn1
appears to be the predominant form in the heart, while
the eyes express higher levels of grn2. Whether the widespread pattern of expression for zebrafish grns is due in
part to leukocyte entrapment in some organs, cells known
to express granulins in carp [43] and goldfish [44] cannot
be determined using this experimental approach.

Two smaller grn genes, grn1 and grn2, each encoding one
full and one amino-terminal half copies only of the granulin motif, were also characterized (Figure 2). Interestingly, a common ancestry of the smaller zebrafish grn
genes with grna and grnb, and thus mammalian grn, is
implied by conservation of the strict exonic organization

Other notable differences in the expression of the paralogous and orthologous pairs of genes were observed. First,
maternal transcripts for grna and grnb are readily detectable, with grnb showing higher abundance than grna until
early somitogenesis when the two genes become
expressed at similar levels (Figure 7, panel A). In contrast,

Expression analysis of grn1, grn2, hybrid grn, and
ASgrn1-2 in the hatching stage zebrafish embryo by
whole mount in situ hybridization. Panel A: grn1 is
expressed in the intestine and pharyngeal region (arrow), and
at low levels in the pronephric ducts. Panel B: In contrast,
grn2 mRNA is only weakly detected in the pharyngeal region
(arrow) and the proctodeum (arrowhead), and is occasionally found in dispersed leukocytes (not shown). Panel C: The
abundance of the trans-spliced product (hybrid grn) is
stronger than grn2 in the proctodeum (arrowhead), but
absent in the pharyngeal region. Panels D–F: The corresponding sense riboprobes to grn1 and grn2, but not to hybrid grn,
detect ASgrn1-2 expression in the pharyngeal region
(arrows). These expression patterns were reproduced in at
least three independent experiments.

although very low levels of grn1 mRNA are also detected
in the newly-fertilized egg, the combined expression of
grn1 and grn2 only becomes detectable by 30 hpf, at a
stage when most organogenesis is well advanced (Figure
7, panel A). Thus, the absence of grn1 and grn2 expression
prior to the onset of zygotic expression argues that these
genes are functionally dispensable in early embryogenesis.
Analysis of progranulin expression by whole mount in situ
hybridization
Early expression
In order to determine possible roles for the grns during
development, their spatio-temporal distribution was
examined by whole mount in situ hybridization. Overall,
grna and grnb expression patterns share conserved features with their murine orthologue in the early embryo.
Transcripts for both zebrafish co-orthologues are maternally deposited and remain ubiquitously expressed subsequent to the onset of zygotic transcription (mid-blastula
transition – 3 hpf). Similarly, in a pattern that reflects the
replacement of maternal mRNAs with zygotically
expressed transcripts [45], murine grn mRNA levels fall
rapidly after egg fertilization, reaching negligible levels as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

early as the 2-cell stage, but rise again to detectable levels
by the eight-cell stage [13] Notably, this precedes the
morula stage and subsequent blastocyst stage when the
epithelium is first formed. It is interesting to note that during zebrafish epiboly, which comprises the morphogenetic movements of the blastoderm towards the vegetal
pole (dome to tailbud stage – 4.5 hpf to 10 hpf), grna and
grnb are still ubiquitous but more intense in the outer
enveloping monolayer of cells (EVL), which ultimately
will give rise to an epithelium covering the blastoderm.
Expression of these grns in the EVL and later in the skin
ectoderm is reminiscent of the more elevated levels of
expression for grn in the apical surface of the mouse blastocyst epithelium, the trophectoderm, relative to the inner
cell mass population [13].
CNS
Although several regions display increased expression of
grna and grnb during brain segmentation (Figure 8, panel
A and B, c–f), regional specificity is more apparent at 24
hpf. Distinct or non-overlapping patterns observed
include grna expression within the tectum and a more
expansive grnb expression pattern encompassing the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, tegmentum and telencephalon (Figure 8, panel B, g). Despite the expression of
both grna and grnb in the epithelial lining of the eyes and
lens, transient expression within the retina and tectum is
noticeable for grna only, suggesting that this orthologue
may affect the development of the retinotectal projections. Similar functions may also be implied for mammalian grn, given its expression within the retinal glia during
murine development [46]. Interestingly, murine grn
expression is abundant throughout the central and
peripheral nervous system, similar to that observed for
grnb at later developmental time points within the
zebrafish CNS (Figure 8 and 9). The generally unrestricted
gene expression pattern suggests a role for progranulin in
cell survival or proliferation or as a competence factor.
Indeed, mammalian grn has been demonstrated to be a
potent glial cell mitogen in vitro [47] and is consistently
up-regulated in malignant human gliomas [47,48]. Grn2
and ASgrn1-2 but not grn1 demonstrate similar unrestricted expression within the zebrafish brain (Figure
11d,h). Taken together these expression patterns suggest
that CNS development in the zebrafish may involve a
functional interplay between the various molecular forms
of granulin.

The only known functional and physiological contribution that grn gene expression is known to make during
neural maturation is its involvement in the sexual differentiation of the male rat brain. It has been shown that
male sexual behaviour is associated with steroid-dependent grn expression in the male neonatal hypothalamus
[49,50]. Similar distinctions in grn gene expression were

Expression analysis of grn1, grn2, hybrid grn, and ASgrn1-2 in the 5 day-old zebrafish larva by mRNA in situ
hybridization. Panels A–C: grn1 is expressed in the intestine (arrow), swim bladder, and more abundantly in the head kidneys
(arrowheads) than in the pronephric ducts. Panels D–F: grn2 is expressed similarly to grn1 in the head kidneys (arrowheads)
and pronephric ducts, but is undetected in the intestine. In contrast, grn2 is strongly expressed in the brain and the branchial
jaw region (compare A with D, and C with F), is distributed in a punctuate pattern along the ventral region of the animal in presumed myeloid progenitors (asterisks in D), and often found in randomly dispersed leukocytes (large cells in F). Panel G: Hybrid
grn is found exclusively in the proctodeum. Panel H: The sense riboprobe to ASgrn1-2 (devoid of the tzf sequence) recapitulates the combined expression patterns for grn1 and grn2. Panels (I–N): Sense riboprobes to grn1 (I,J) or grn2 (K,L), but not
hybrid grn (M), show that antisense transcription occurs in the jaw region (arrows in I and K), the swim bladder, and in the
mid-region of the intestine, in a pattern identical to that observed for the antisense probe corresponding to ASgrn1-2 (N). B, E:

not determined in the present study given that sexual differentiation of zebrafish gonads occurs much later and
spans roughly 21–28 dpf [51].
Endoderm
The expression of the zebrafish grn gene family members
also displays overlapping and distinctive patterns with
respect to the endoderm and tissues derived from this
germ layer. At 24 hpf both grna and grnb can be found
within the pharyngeal and foregut endoderm, whereas
only the latter is located within the YSL (Figure 8, panels
A and B, g). Both transcripts maintain a degree of dispersed endodermal expression until 120 hpf where grna is
located within the epithelial lining of the stomach and
anterior intestine while grnb can be found within the YSL,
pancreas and proctodeum (Figure 8 and 9).

Unlike the expression of grna and grnb, the paralogues
grn1, grn2 and hybrid granulin are highly abundant and
for the most part restricted to pharyngeal and visceral
endodermal derivatives from 72 hpf onward. Although
grn1 and grn2 demonstrate some endodermal tissue-specific expression, these transcripts often co-localize (Figure
11a,b,d,e). The restricted expression of hybrid granulin
within the proctodeum is particularly striking (Figure
11g). Consistent with the manner in which the hybrid
transcript is formed, both grn1 and grn2 are likewise
expressed in the proctodeum. However, expression of
these two transcripts overlaps within a large portion of the
intestine and stomach where no hybrid grn transcript is
found. This suggests that wherever the hybrid grn is
observed, the generation of this chimeric peptide must be
a highly regulated process and that a specific function is
implied.

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:156

In contrast to the observed grn distribution in zebrafish,
murine grn is not detected within developing endodermal
derivatives, with the exception of adult deep crypt enterocytes [42,46]. This suggests that mammalian dependence
on grn expression may be developmentally restricted to
endodermal-epithelial transitions in the gut or subsequent maintenance of this organ. Alternatively, it is possible that endodermal expression of zebrafish grns reflects a
species-specific requirement.
Hematopoietic tissue
Of particular interest in regards to functional equivalence
between species and functional separation between duplicated co-orthologues, is the almost complete partitioning
of grn hematopoietic expression onto grna and to a much
lesser extent grn2. In zebrafish, primitive hematopoiesis
occurs within the anterior ICM from where nucleated
erythroblasts originate and myeloid cells that can be seen
circulating at 24 hpf [52]. Hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) are then believed to populate the dorsal aorta and
yolk sac which represent the zebrafish equivalent of the
mammalian aorta-gonad-mesonephros, the tissue presumed to be responsible for later definitive erythropoiesis
[53,54]. The posterior ICM, located within the ventral tail
and positive for molecular markers of all three hematopoietic lineages, may represent a secondary zebrafish
HSC population or region required for HSC maturation
[55]. Unlike the murine model, zebrafish definitive
hematopoiesis undergoes a migratory transition from the
dorsal aorta/ventral tail to the kidney (roughly 96 hpf),
without the involvement of liver or bone marrow.

In accordance with expression patterns mentioned previously, grna only acquires distinctive tissue-specificity at 24
hpf, as is the case for its prevalence within the caudal ICM
(Figure 8, panel A, g–j), restricting its involvement to
definitive hematopoietic waves. Grna can be found at low
levels within the dorsal aorta at 48 hpf (data not shown)
and is highly expressed within the caudal-ventral tail
region throughout all stages post-24 hpf (Figure 8 and 9),
suggesting its involvement in multiple hematopoietic lineages. Significantly, sustained grna expression in this
hematopoietic organ is coupled with the appearance of
grna-expressing leukocytes dispersed throughout the animal with levels that peak at approximately 72 hpf (Figure
8, panel A, j–k). Thus grna expression in presumed granulocytes all over the body of the animal may suggest its
involvement in the innate immune response of the host.
Grn2 expression is also found within peripheral leukocytes, but in a sporadic pattern that is distinct from that
observed for grna. Whether these differences reflect leukocyte sub-populations or activation states for these cells has
not been addressed. Commensurate with the transition of
ICM to kidney as the major site of hematopoiesis, grna
can be found within the pronephric ducts (Figure 9) along

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

with grn1 and grn2, which are also present in the head
kidney (Figure 11, panel B and E).
Mammalian grn exhibits a similar expression pattern, particularly in neutrophils. Furthermore, murine grn can
modulate the inflammatory response during wound healing, acting as both a chemokinetic factor and inhibitor of
neutrophil degranulation and respiratory burst [56,57]. It
remains to be determined whether grna supports a similar
role in zebrafish.
Chimeric transcription
During the initial degenerate primer amplification of
cDNAs encoding grn1 and 2, a third cDNA was cloned
and identified as sharing strict identity with portions of
both grn1 and 2. Interestingly, this granulin-hybrid
showed 100% identity with exons 1 and 2 of grn-1, and
with exons 3, 4 and 5 of grn-2, suggesting that this hybrid
cDNA may represent a splicing of granulin-1 and 2 primary transcripts (Figure 3). Chimeric transcripts usually
result from one of the following mechanisms: chromosomal translocations, transcription of neighboring genes
as a single transcription unit or alternative splicing in
trans. In all cases, joining of exons is predicted to occur
through the recognition of canonical splice acceptor and
donor sites.

A hybrid granulin structure has been previously reported
through cloning of cDNA sequences in the rat [27]. Specifically, a structural splice variant of progranulin cDNA
was retrieved and predicted to encode a granulin domain
consisting of the amino-terminal domain of granulin-C
fused to the carboxyl-terminal domain of granulin-D,
consistent with the removal of an exon from the larger primary transcript [22,28]. The zebrafish hybrid grn
described here likely originates through a mechanism
other than alternative splicing from a larger primary transcript since the grn2 gene is located 5' to the grn1 gene
(Figure 3). This topology was confirmed through the cloning and structural analysis of the partially complementary
ASgrn1-2 gene. Also, we found no evidence for the presence of additional grn1-like genomic sequences located
upstream of the grn2 gene, or elsewhere in the genome by
Southern analysis (data not shown). In particular, no
equivalent of carp grn3 was found in zebrafish. These
observations suggest that the presence of hybrid grn in
zebrafish likely occurs through a splicing reaction in trans
between grn1 and grn2 pre-mRNAs, similar to the mechanism originally documented in trypanosomatids [58].
Although rare, scrambled or intergenic RNA molecules
consisting of exons originating from distinct genes
through a trans-splicing reaction have also been documented in vertebrates. For instance, acyl-CoA:cholesterol
acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1) and the CYP3A family of P450
cytochrome genes produce hybrid mRNA variants in

Page 14 of 24

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:156

humans [59,60]. Trans-splicing of the voltage-gated
sodium channel in response to nerve growth factor stimulation, further suggests that this alternative mode of splicing can be a regulated process [61]. Indeed, there is
evidence suggesting that splicing in trans may be facilitated through the recognition of regulatory elements
within transcript sequences called splicing enhancers that
require binding of SR proteins for activity [62]. Whether
grn1 or grn2 harbour a necessary enhancer sequence that
could explain the directionality of hybrid grn is currently
not known. We believe the hybrid granulin represents the
first example of trans-splicing with regards to the modification of a growth factor gene product.
Antisense transcription
Although the majority of deposited zebrafish EST library
sequencing confirmed the existence of grn1 and grn2, one
particular sequence (AW777232) corresponded to the
exact reverse complement to both grn1 and grn2 within
the same exon/intron spanning region (exons 2–3 and
intervening intron), and was named ASgrn1-2 accordingly. In addition, ASgrn1-2 harbours sequences for an
extensively mutated tzf transposon (Tc1/mariner superfamily) in its last exon, but in the reverse complement orientation (Figure 3 and Additional File 7). Despite its
polyadenylation, the lack of an ORF classifies ASgrn1-2 as
a non-coding RNA. To our knowledge, ASgrn1-2 represents the first example of a single spliced transcript with
antisense complementarity to two tandemly organized
paralogous protein-coding genes.

The existence of ASgrn1-2 has potential implications in
aspects of grn1 and grn2 function. Classically, antisense
transcripts often function as inhibitors of the expression
of their associated gene, through repression of transcription or promotion of mRNA degradation. There is the possibility that ASgrn1-2 is involved in the formation of
hybrid grn wherein this complementary transcript may
provide a scaffold to sequester grn1 and grn2 mRNA transcripts within the same intracellular locale, preventing or
alternatively facilitating the trans-splicing reaction.
Regarding the RT-PCR data, despite evidence of clear tissue-specific and temporal ASgrn1-2 expression in adult
tissues and various developmental stages respectively, this
transcript shows no clear reciprocal relationship to grn1
or grn2 (Figures 6 and 7). These expression patterns were
confirmed at all stages examined using sense riboprobes
for grn1, grn2, and verified for specificity by using the corresponding sense riboprobe to hybrid grn as negative control (Figures 10 and 11, and data not shown). At 5 dpf,
ASgrn1-2 is expressed in the presumed hyoid ossification
center, stomach and rostral intestine, as well as swim
bladder (Figure 11i–n). Although grn1 and grn2 are
found within most of these tissues (particularly grn1),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

specific expression of ASgrn1-2 in the hyoid region undergoing osteogenesis may suggest the required down-regulation of the expression of its counterpart genes during bone
development. Therefore a reciprocal relationship may
exist between these genes under strict spatio-temporal regulation. Although ASgrn1-2 may mediate a degradation
independent mode of gene regulation, such as alternative
splicing, it clearly does not perform as a universal negative
regulator of grn1 and grn2 expression.
At least one type of transcription modulation may be associated with ASgrn1-2 based on whole mount in situ
hybridization analysis. There is a clear reciprocal relationship between hybrid grn expression and absence of
ASgrn1-2 transcription. At 120 hpf, hybrid grn is restricted
to the distal intestine and despite the expression of its substrate transcripts within several other locales, no other
grn1/grn2 rich setting is devoid of ASgrn1-2 (Figure 11).
This pattern further suggests that ASgrn1-2 expression prevents formation of the hybrid grn RNA.
The existence of ASgrn1-2 suggested that an equivalent
entity may exist for one or both co-orthologues, grna and
grnb. Indeed, the sense probe for grna in whole mount in
situ hybridization analysis produced a consistent and
reproducible signal within the intestine and pronephric
ducts at 5 dpf (Figure 9, panel A, b). Several unidirectionally cloned cDNAs (accession numbers (CD585878,
CD585963, and CD596001) were found to correspond to
the reverse complement sequence of grna within the
3'UTR. Northern blot analysis using sense grna demonstrated a putative 4 kb transcript and directional cDNA
synthesis followed by RT-PCR indicated this putative antisense transcript extended within the known grna intronic
sequence. However, repeated attempts to clone the fulllength transcript by RACE were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, these observations provide evidence for the existence
of a second naturally occurring grn complementary transcript, namely ASgrna.
The granulin motif – phylogenetic and functional
implications
The granulin motif is so distinctive that it is a relatively
simple matter to search the protein and nucleotide databases to obtain an impression of its phylogenetic origins.
Figure 12 shows a diagrammatic representation of the
nature of proteins bearing the granulin motif that can be
confidently predicted through searching the cDNA, EST
and/or genome sequence databases using BLAST [24]. The
numbers of full granulin modules present in each putative
protein is shown in cartoon form together with an impression of the phylogenetic origins of the species involved.
The source of the sequence data used to predict these
structures is listed as accession numbers in the legend to
Figure 12. The distribution of some of the proteins bear-

ing the granulin motif within assorted species has been
partially annotated and can be viewed at various web sites
[63,64]. With some interesting exceptions (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster), the granulin motif can be found
throughout eukaryotes, both in plants and multicellular
animals. In contrast there is no representation within
fungi or unicellular organisms. The presence of a protein
bearing the granulin motif within the slime mold (Dictyostelium discoideum) is particularly revealing since this
organism is thought to be a modern representative of an
amoeboid organism that was a transition species between
unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes [65]. The appearance of this organism is thought to predate the divergence
of plants and animals about 1.5 billion years ago. This
suggests that a primordial gene bearing a single granulin
motif evolved once during this transition period. The
plant motif is found in just one context as a carboxyl-terminal domain of a cysteine protease that is found in many
members of the viridiplantae including Arabidopsis thaliana [66] (Figure 12). Together this suggests that the
founding granulin gene was represented by a single copy
and composed of a single granulin motif.
In contrast to the conserved protease/granulin gene architecture found in plants, members of the animal kingdom
have expanded their granulin repertoire, not via genomic
or segmental duplication, but rather through tandem
multiplication of the granulin ORF. For instance the Xenopus leavis and the early chordate Ciona intestinalis granulin
genes encode of five and six tandemly repeated near identical granulin motifs, respectively. The variance in the
number of granulin intragenic regions demonstrates a
degree of plasticity during grn gene expansion. Intragenic
multiplication is unlikely to have occurred as a single
ancestral event; rather grn gene expansion has taken place
independently in various species to varying extents. This
mechanism of conserved domain repetition is not unique
to grn genes. Indeed, the same type of genetic expansion is
likely responsible for the repetition of immunoglobulin,
EGF and lectin domains in numerous proteins.
The presence of single grn genes in protostomes is not surprising since the origins of these species predate the estimated genomic duplications within the vertebrate
radiation (1R and 2R, Figure 12); these large-scale events
appear not to have given rise to grn gene expansion. Specifically, all members of the sarcopterygian lineage
(derived from lobe-finned fish) harbour a single granulin
gene of varying motif number, indicating that intragenic
multiplication remains the preferred and tolerated means
of granulin expansion for most vertebrates, including
mammals. The same intolerance to gene duplication has
not encompassed the actinopterygians (ray-finned fish),
including Danio rerio and Takifugu rubripes. These species
have undoubtedly expanded their granulin gene reper-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

toire through tandem intragenic expansion as well as
genome duplication (3R, Figure 12), to yield the co-orthologues grna and grnb. Interestingly, the existence of grn1
and grn2 does not necessarily conform to these methods
of gene expansion, suggesting that a specific and unidentified means of gene expansion, possibly involving
ASgrn1-2, may exist.

Conclusion
Although the existence of two co-orthologues of mammalian progranulin in zebrafish is likely a result of genomewide duplication, similar genetic events have occurred
within chordates prior to divergence of the ray-finned (teleost) and lobe-finned (mammalia) radiations. Indeed
two rounds of genome-wide duplication are believed to
have occurred [67]. More precisely, the first genome
duplication probably occurred in a common ancestor of
all agnathans and gnathostomes after its divergence from
cephalochordates, ~594 mya (million years ago). The second round is presumed to have occurred ~488 mya,
within the lineage leading to jawed vertebrates after the
jawless line diverged, presumably before the split between
cartilaginous and bony fish. Despite this, all mammals
studied thus far have retained only a single copy of the
progranulin gene, whereas two rounds of genome duplication would theoretically create four progranulin genes.
It is therefore interesting to consider the biological rationale behind retention of grna and grnb following the teleost
genome duplication, an event not permitted within other
vertebrates, in conjunction with the appearance of two
extra paralogues, grn1 and grn2. Regulation by gene dosage through complementary transcription may have
allowed for the retention of the smaller paralogues, while
putative antisense transcription to grna may be necessary
for precisely regulating the spatio-temporal activity of this
growth factor.
Overall, the expression patterns of zebrafish progranulins
faithfully replicate those observed for the mouse counterpart in a similar context [42,46]. Importantly, this indicates that the use of zebrafish will enable modeling of the
contributions of progranulin activity to vertebrate development through investigating both grna and grnb. These
studies will be uncomplicated by the presence of grn1 and
grn2, whose expression patterns largely do not overlap
with the co-orthologues. Overall, the expression patterns
for the grns indicate that these growth factors may subserve multiple functions in vivo that are consistent with
the known role of their mammalian counterpart in cell
growth, motility and survival.

Materials and methods
Tissue extraction and granulin peptide purification
Carp (Cyprinus carpio) were purchased live at a local fish
market (Waldman Plus, Montreal, QUE). Peptides from

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:156

fish spleens were extracted using C18 Sep-Pak cartridges
(Waters Canada Ltd. Mississauga, ONT) and separated
using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a C18 Bondapak column (Waters)
as previously described [19,68]. Column fractions were
screened for cysteine content by amino acid analysis and
granulin-1/2 immunoreactivity by radioimmunoassay
[19]. Fractions positive for both criteria were further purified by RP-HPLC using solvents containing 0.13% (v/v)
heptafluorobutyric acid as counter-ion, and subsequently
purified to homogeneity using the original solvent system
containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Molecular
weight of purified peptides was determined using a Voyager matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-offlight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Perceptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) located at the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre of McGill University.
Microsequencing of carp granulin-A
The putative carp granulin-A was alkylated according to a
previously published protocol [19]. Approximately 20 µg
of the alkylated carp granulin-A was digested with
sequencing grade chymotrypsin (Roche Diagnostics Canada, Laval, QUE) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the resulting fragments separated by RP-HPLC
on a C18 Bondapak column. Amino-terminal sequence
analysis of carp granulin-A and its chymotryptic fragments
was undertaken using a Procise sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) located at the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre of McGill University.
Fish husbandry
Wild type zebrafish were purchased from Scientific Hatcheries (Huntington Beach, CA) and maintained on a 14 h/
10 h light/dark cycle at 28.5°C in a laboratory aquarium
(Allantown Aquaneering, Allantown, NJ). Fish were fed
twice daily, and bred as described elsewhere [69].
Embryos for developmental studies were collected from
tanks and staged according to conventional criteria [70]
and by hours post-fertilization (hpf).
Library screening and cloning of zebrafish progranulins
The zebrafish grn1 cDNA was cloned using a PCR strategy
(Additional File 1). The carp granulin-1 amino acid
sequence was used to design degenerate forward DF1 (5'GTI ATY CAY TGY GAY GC-3') and reverse DR1 (5'-CAR
CAR TGR ATI CCR TC-3') and DR2 (5'-TCR CAR TGR TAI
CCR TG-3') primers for use in the polymerase chain reaction (IUPAC codes are used to refer to the bases in primer
sequences). The template for the initial amplification
reaction was a 5'-STRETCH plus cDNA library cloned in
lambda gt10 vector (Clontech BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ONT). cDNA for this library was prepared from 1month-old zebrafish using a combination of oligo-dT and
random priming. 0.25 µl of library (approximately 108

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

pfu/ml) was used in a final reaction volume of 100 µl for
each new amplification attempt. The annealing temperature was determined empirically in order to maximize
yield of product. PCR amplifications were performed with
Taq DNA polymerase, unless specified otherwise, using a
Hybaid thermal cycler from Bio/Can Scientific Inc. (Etobicoke, ONT). Amplified products were isolated by agarose
gel electrophoresis, purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc. Mississauga, ONT) and sequenced
after cloning into TOPO pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). An initial reaction using the DF1 and DR1 primer
pair yielded several products. 5 µl of this reaction was subjected to re-amplification using DF1 primer in combination with the nested (anchored) DR2 primer, which
revealed a product of 126-bp encoding a partial sequence
for granulin-1 (Additional File 1, step 1). New grn1 primers F126 (5'-ACTGTGTGTCCAGACGG-3') and R215 (5'CCATCCCTGCAACACTG-3') were then designed based
on this sequence and were used, respectively, in combination with flanking gt10 primers in order to obtain the 5'and 3'-untranslated region (UTR) cDNA sequences (Additional File 1, steps 2 and 3). Finally, the entire ORF was
amplified with Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics), using forward F1 (5'-ATGTTCCCAGTGTTGATG-3')
and reverse R (STOP) (5'-GCTTACAACTCCAACCCG-3')
primers (Additional File 1, Step 4). This PCR was performed in a final volume of 100 µl, containing 0.25 µl of
library, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 8.8), 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM concentration of each
dNTP, 0.5 unit of Pwo DNA polymerase, and 100 pmol of
each primer. An initial denaturation step was carried out
at 94°C for 3 min. Annealing temperatures of 54°C, 56°C
and 58°C were used sequentially for 10 cycles each. Typical denaturation, annealing, and amplification reactions
were carried out at 94°C for 30 sec, 54°C for 1 min, and
68°C for 1 min, respectively. A final extension step of 10
min at 72°C was carried out after adding 0.25 unit Taq
DNA polymerase. An amplification product specific for
grn1 was sequenced on both strands. The 5'-UTR, and a
portion of the 3'-UTR for grn1, were amplified using grn1specific primers in conjunction with a lambda gt10
primer. Distinct cDNAs encoding progranulin-2 and a chimeric progranulin were uncovered through this approach.
Each transcript was confirmed through sequencing of
independent amplification reactions using template
cDNA derived from either adult organs or embryos of
mixed stages. Following a strategy similar to that used for
the isolation of zebrafish grn1 cDNA, primers based on
the purified carp granulin-A peptide sequence were
designed to clone partial cDNAs for zebrafish grna and
grnb, respectively (not shown). BLAST searches using the
cloned sequences retrieved two unique ESTs at NCBI sharing an exact match with grna and grnb, respectively (accession numbers AW174591 and AW184435). These
respective ESTs were purchased from RZPD GmbH (Hei-

Diagrammatic representation of the structures and evolutionary origins of the granulin in multicelluar organisms. Evolutionary distances in millions of years derived from Hedges 2002 [77]. The estimated rounds of vertebrate genome
duplication events are indicated (1R, 2R, 3R). The various progranulin structures were derived from various databases as outlined below. Land plant – (Arabidopsis thaliana) – Papain-like thiol protease bearing a carboxyl-terminal granulin domain
(AAK71314); Slime mold – (Dictyostelium discoideum) – 1 copy progranulin from a single EST (AU267401) Trematode worm
(Schistosoma japonicum) – 9 copy progranulin built from a combination of four ESTs (AY810079, BU790215, BU799560,
BU771494); Nematode worm – (Caenorhabditis elegans) – 3 copy progranulin from single EST (NM_060580) – overall architecture confirmed by genome sequence (Z81595); Annelid worm (earthworm – Lumbricus rubellus) – 1 copy progranulin from a
single EST (CO046860); Primitive chordate – (Sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis) – 7 copy progranulin predicted from draft genomic
sequence (AABS01000126) and overall architecture confirmed by ESTs. Domains 2 to 7 nearly identical (BW368775,
BW311239). Amphibian – (Frog, Xenopus laevis) co-orthologues progranulins A and B consisting of one-half domain followed
by 12 full domains and one-half domain followed by nine full domains respectively [78]. These are structurally closely related
and are a result of a recent tetraploidization event 30 mya [79]. Avian (chicken – Gallus gallus) – 4 copy progranulin built from
three ESTs (BM440305, BU297352 and BX265765) – overall architecture confirmed by genome sequence (LOC426606);
Human (Homo sapiens) – Progranulin composed of one half domain followed by 7 domains (UniProt entry: P28799); Teleost –

itrogen, Burlington, ONT) using total RNA isolated from
adult zebrafish intestine. For grn1 and grn2 transcripts, a
reverse primer that corresponded to nucleotides 195–215
based on the cloned ORF of both transcripts (5'-CCATCCCTGCAACACTGACCC-3'), was used to perform the 5'
RACE, while a forward primer corresponding to nucleotides 1–22 of each transcript (5'-ATGTTCCCAGTGTTGATGTTAC-3') was used to perform the RACE in the 3'
direction. Similarly a 5' UTR sequence for grna was
obtained using the map reverse primer (see below).
Repeated RACE attempts in both directions for ASgrna
were unsuccessful.
Cloning of the zebrafish grn1 gene
A zebrafish genomic library constructed in P1 artificial
chromosome (PAC) [71] and represented on filters at
high-density (RZPD GmbH) was screened for the presence of the grn1 gene using standard procedures. The
cDNA bearing the grn1 ORF was labeled with [α-32P]
dCTP by random priming using the Oligolabeling kit
(Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfe, QUE) for use as
probe, and purified using a Sephadex G-50 column
(Amersham Biosciences). Kodak X-OMAT AR film was
used for autoradiography (Fisher Scientific Ltd, Whitby,
ONT).
Three
positive
clones
(706K2254Q,
BUSMP706K14116Q2, 706F20133Q2) were detected by
autoradiography, and the first two were confirmed to
carry at least part of the grn1 gene by PCR, using the F1
(5'-ATGTTCCCAGTGTTGATG-3') and R215 (5'-CCATCCCTGCAACACTG-3') primer pair which does not discriminate between grn1 and grn2, and sequencing. DNA
from a positive clone (706K2254Q) was purified with the
Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen). 1.5 µg of this DNA was subjected to restriction digest with EcoRI to generate fragments suitable for cloning into pBluescript II KS
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and was followed by transformation in TOP 10F' electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen).
Screening of colonies transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Xymotech, Montreal, QUE), employing the
same probe used for the original library screening, was
performed in the following prehybridization and hybridization conditions: 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 0.05% Na Pyrophosphate at 65°C. Membranes were washed twice in 1 ×
SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Na Pyrophosphate at 60°C for 15
min, followed by two washes in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS,
0.05% Na Pyrophosphate at 60°C for 10 min. Plasmid
DNA from a positive clone was purified using the high
pure plasmid isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics, Laval,
QUE). An insert of ~9-kb was fully sequenced and
revealed the presence of the promoter region and approximately half of the grn1 gene. The remaining gene
sequence was found in a ~6-kb insert clone isolated by rescreening the colony lifts with 32P-labeled reverse
R(STOP) oligonucleotide (5'-GCTTACAACTCCAACCCG3') as probe. A PCR was performed using primers flanking

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/156

this EcoRI site, and sequenced to confirm that the isolated
9 kb and 6 kb clones represent continuous sequences
within the original PAC clone.
Retrieval of antisense transcripts from NCBI
While in the process of analyzing cloned grn1 genomic
sequences (data not shown) through BLAST searches for
corresponding sequences at GenBank, an EST harbouring
sequences corresponding to unspliced grn1, but in the
reverse complement orientation, was noticed. This clone
(accession number AW777232) was purchased (RZPD,
clone ID: DKFZp717B091Q2) and further analyzed
through sequencing. A putative transcript exhibiting perfect complementarity to the 3'UTR region of zebrafish
grna (ASgrna) was deduced from sequencing four unidirectionally cloned ESTs deposited at GenBank
(CD585878, CD585963, CD596001 and CD588938)
that originated from an oligo-dT-primed cDNA synthesis
from adult kidney marrow RNA (Song et al. 2004; kindly
provided by Dr. Chen, Shanghai Institute of Biological
Science). Unidirectional cDNA synthesis using total RNA
derived 5 day-old larvae was synthesized using a sense
primer relative to the 3'UTR exon (ASgrna 2) or to a
known intron (ASgrna 3) of grna (Additional File 10 and
11). These primers were then used in conjunction with the
following primer (ASgrna 1) in subsequent RT-PCR to
confirm antisense transcription to grna.
Chromosomal assignment and syntenic analysis
Zebrafish grns were mapped using the LN54 Radiation
Hybrid Panel as previously described [29]. Primers for
each gene are noted in Additional File 9. Each PCR reaction was carried in a final volume of 20 µl containing 100
ng "hybrid DNA", 500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.3), 15 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 1 unit Taq DNA
polymerase, and 5 pmol of each oligo. Denaturation,
annealing and amplification were performed at 94°C for
30 sec, 55°C (grn1 and grn2) or 60°C (grna and grnb) for
30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec, respectively, followed by an
extension step of 7 min at 72°C. To determine syntenic
relationships between zebrafish and human genomes,
mapped zebrafish genes flanking a given zebrafish grn
gene were identified using the consolidated zebrafish
maps available from ZFIN [72] and data from LocusLink
[73].
Gene expression profiling by RT-PCR
Total RNA from various adult tissues and developmental
stages was isolated using Trizol LS reagent (Gibco BRL,
Burlington, ONT), treated with DNaseI and used in first
strand synthesis using the Revert Aid H-synthesis kit (MBI
Fermentas Inc. Burlington, ONT). PCR conditions used
for each family member consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30–40 cycles at 94°C
for 45 sec, gene-specific annealing temperature (Addi-

tional File 10) for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min,
with a final single cycle extension at 72°C for 7 min. To
discriminate between grn1, grn2 and hybrid grn, an
(NH4)2SO4 buffer with 1 mM MgCl2 (MBI Fermentas) was
used for RT-PCR in conjunction with cloned template
controls (pBluescript, Clonetech) for all three forms using
the same reaction parameters. Two independent reverse
primers for grn1 and grn2 yielded products of expected
size and hybrid grn was produced using grn1 forward with
either of the grn2 reverse primers. All PCR products were
resolved on 2% agarose gels, ethidium bromide stained
and visualized on Polaroid 667 Film. The authenticity of
all PCR products was confirmed by sequencing after cloning into TOPO/pCR2.1.
Northern blot analysis
Full-length mRNA transcript size was assessed for each
progranulin family member by Northern analysis of polyA enriched mRNA (Micro Poly (A) Purist Small Scale Purification Kit; Ambion) derived from whole adult or 5 dpf
animals [74]. Hybridization (Ultrahyb; Ambion, Austin,
TX) was carried out using non-radioactive biotin-labeled
cRNA probes (Psoralen-Biotin Non-iosotopic labeling Kit;
Ambion) and detected with Brightstar BioDetect Nonisotopic Detection Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturers
instructions. Band size was determined using pre-labeled
biotin markers (Ambion).
Whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization
In situ hybridization for progranulin family gene expression was carried out essentially as previously described
[75]. Briefly, digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes for each
full-length cDNA, with the exception of ASgrn-1/2 which
corresponded to exons 1–3 only, were hybridized at 70°C
using various developmental stages from cleavage to larval. In some cases, polyvinyl alcohol was added to the
staining solution in order to minimize the occurrence of
background, especially when the reaction was required to
proceed for several days [76]. Stained whole-mount and
sectioned embryos were mounted in glycerol and visualized under a Leica MZFLIII stereomicroscope (Richmond
Hill, ONT). Pictures were taken with a Leica DC350F camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software.

Conserved exonic organization of zebrafish grn1 and grn2 genes relative to mammalian progranulin. Like granulin repeat units found in
mammalian progranulin the nucleotide sequences encoding zebrafish
granulin-1 (and granulin-2, not shown here) is derived from the joining
of two spliced exons with phase 0 boundaries. This characteristic splicing
occurs at nucleotide positions corresponding to four amino acids after
cysteine 6 within the amino-terminal region (exon 2), and two amino
acids before cysteine 7 in the carboxyl-terminal end (exon 3). The relative

Cloning of a chimeric transcript that encodes a hybrid progranulin.
Panel A: Nucleotide sequence alignment of the ORFs for progranulin-1,
chimeric progranulin, and progranulin-2. RACE confirmed that the
cloned cDNAs possess identical 5' and 3' untranslated regions (not
shown). After verifying the cDNA nucleotide sequences for grn1 and grn2
with corresponding exonic segments (boxed), it was found that for the chimeric (hybrid grn) transcript, all except one nucleotide substitution (T
instead of C, exon 4), are conserved and non-randomly distributed among
corresponding exonic sequences of either the grn1 (highlighted in blue,
exon 2) or grn2 (highlighted in orange, exons 3–5) genes. The translation
initiation (ATG) and termination (TAA) codons are in bold. Arrows indicate location of primers used for RT-PCR analyses (bold; see Additional
File 10). Panel B: Sequence alignment of the deduced translated
sequences for progranulin-1, progranulin-2, and hybrid progranulin. The
candidate chimeric transcript consists of the amino-terminal portion of
grn1 (exons 1 and 2) and of the carboxyl-terminal portion of progranulin2 (exons 3 to 5). The position of introns (A–D) located in the respective
grn1 and grn2 genes are indicated by arrowheads. The granulin-1 peptide
and amino-terminal half-domain are underlined.

Additional File 7
The genomic region encompassing exon 4 of the ASgrn1-2 gene corresponds to a defective transposon of the tzf family, in the reverse complement orientation. A consensus 1621 nucleotide sequence for the tzf
transposon, deduced by the majority rule from aligned sequences obtained
from GenBank EST entries (U51226-U51230) and published data (Lam
et al. 1996), is shown on top in uppercase, with the characteristic 200
nucleotides inverted repeats (underlined) and terminal TA dinucleotides
(bold). The translation initiation (ATG) and termination (TGA) codons
of the transposase gene are in bold and boxed. The reverse complement
sequence of the region encompassing exon 4 of the ASgrn1-2 gene (boxed)
is aligned underneath the transposon sequence, with mismatches represented in lowercase. Deletions (-) and insertions (+) relative to the intact
transposon sequence that have occurred within exon 4 and flanking
intronic sequences of the ASgrn1-2 gene, rendering this mobile element
inactive, are indicated.

Northern analysis of zebrafish grn sense and antisense transcripts.
Northern blot analyses using strand-specific cRNA probes were performed
to confirm the size of cloned cDNA sequences and resolve the issue of antisense transcription to grna. Panel A: grna is expressed as a predominant
transcript of 3.7 kb in size, consistent with cloned sequences (3649 bp),
and can also be found as a larger transcript exceeding 6 kb. Panel B: Four
grnb transcripts of approximately 1.5 kb, 1.8 kb, 2.9 kb and 5.2 kb in size,
respectively, are detected. Note that the 2.9 kb band, showing strongest
intensity, is in agreement with cloned sequences for this mRNA (2820
bp). Panel C: A riboprobe targeting ASgrna detects a faint transcript of
approximately 4 kb in size, suggesting that the cloned sequences for this
antisense transcript (914 bp) may represent a splice variant. Panel D:
The grn1 transcript is approximately 0.8 kb in size, as expected from
cloned sequences (see Additional Files 2 and 3), but also expressed at
lower levels as a larger transcript of approximately 1.7 kb. Panel E: Unlike
grn1, grn2 is not expressed as a transcript other than 0.8 kb in size. Panel
F: A band of low intensity can be detected at 0.8 kb for the hybrid grn
RNA, suggesting that no cross-hybridization occurs with grn1 and grn2
mRNAs using this riboprobe. The hybrid grn riboprobe also detects a band
of approximately 1.7 kb similar in intensity to that seen for grn1. Panel
G: The overall abundance of the ASgrn1-2 transcript is too low for detection. A–C: 15 µg poly-A enriched RNA; D–G: 15 µg total RNA, each
derived from a whole adult.

Primers used in the linkage group assignment of the zebrafish progranulin genes. Before applying to the LN 54 mapping panel, conditions
for each primer combination were optimized by PCR with the use of
zebrafish genomic DNA derived from the AB wild type strain. The authenticity and specificity of each amplicon was verified by sequencing after
cloning into the pCRII plasmid. For the assignment to zebrafish linkage
groups, each PCR amplification experiment was performed at least twice.

Partial characterization of a putative antisense transcript to zebrafish
grna. Panel A: Schematic representation of the location of ASgrna, a unidirectionally cloned transcript sharing complementarity with part of the
last exon of the zebrafish grna gene. The relative position of primers used
for cDNA synthesis (primers 2 and 3, respectively) and subsequent RTPCR are indicated (see Materials and Methods). Panel B: RT-PCR analysis of cDNA synthesized using either primer 2 or primer 3, respectively,
with (+) or without (-) reverse-transcriptase. Primers depicted in A are
used in the following combination for the RT-PCR: pair 1/2 (342 bp product) and pair 1/3 (478 bp product). The presence of an amplicon for both
primer pairs using each +RT cDNA template, but not using template
derived from -RT reactions, indicates that ASgrna extends in the 3'end
direction and overlaps with intronic sequences of grna. Positive controls
for PCR conditions using genomic DNA as template, as well as a no template control are indicated, respectively. The authenticity of the amplicons
was determined through sequencing. Each step of the experimental procedure was performed twice.
