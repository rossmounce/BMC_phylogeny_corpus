Abstract
Background: While most gamma proteobacteria have a single circular chromosome, Vibrionales have two circular
chromosomes. Horizontal gene transfer is common among Vibrios, and in light of this genetic mobility, it is an open
question to what extent the two chromosomes themselves share a common history since their formation.
Results: Single copy genes from each chromosome (142 genes from chromosome I and 42 genes from chromosome
II) were identified from 19 sequenced Vibrionales genomes and their phylogenetic comparison suggests consistent
phylogenies for each chromosome. Additionally, study of the gene organization and phylogeny of the respective
origins of replication confirmed the shared history.
Conclusions: Thus, while elements within the chromosomes may have experienced significant genetic mobility, the
backbones share a common history. This allows conclusions based on multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) for one
chromosome to be applied equally to both chromosomes.
Background
In traditional dogma, bacteria have one chromosome and
a number of smaller DNA entities, like plasmids, which
are propagated across generations unlinked to the chromosome. However, when bacteria have two chromosomes, are they permanently paired or do these physical
entities recombine frequently relative to genes on these
chromosomes? Since 1998, it has been known that some
gamma proteobacteria have two chromosomes [1-3].
This followed discoveries that various other proteobacteria, namely alpha proteobacteria [4,5] and beta proteobacteria [6], could have multiple chromosomes as
well. An initial debate occurred over whether the second
Vibrio chromosome was really a 'chromosome' or
whether it was merely a 'megaplasmid' [3,7]. The arguments for considering the second replicon a chromosome
centered on its considerable size, essential gene content
[8] and consistent stoichiometry. We can now add to that
a unique replication machinery [9,10] that operates independently but in a coordinated fashion [11] with synchronous termination and thus consistent stoichiometry
[12,13]. It is now accepted that most, perhaps all, Vibrionaceae (including the genera Vibrio and Photobacteria)
have two chromosomes [14].

Genome analysis of the Vibrios rapidly uncovers variation even among closely related strains. Not only do the
genome sizes differ widely [15], but even among conserved genes, there is incongruity among the inferred
phylogenies. This is the well-accepted signature of horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination.
Gene organization also differs among sequenced strains,
indicating large-scale genetic mobility. Individual genes
and entire operons may be mobile among Vibrio [16-20].
In particular, Chromosome II varies widely in size and
organization [14,21]. Further, many Vibrio carry (and presumably exchange) plasmids. Though it may seem
unusual to expect as large a quantity of DNA to be transferred as an entire chromosome, there is evidence that
Vibrio have experienced a transfer on that magnitude
even recently: The putative V. vulnificus hybridization
leading to biotype 3 involves very large quantities of DNA
being transferred among V. vulnificus strains to create a
hybrid strain almost evenly split in contributions from
biotypes 1 and 2 [22]. However, the hybridization event
involves loci from both chromosomes being transferred
and appears to have preserved their associations with
those chromosomes. As such, it does not appear to have
been an exchange of chromosomal partners, but it raises
the possibility that chromosomal exchange may have
been an evolutionary mechanism within the Vibrionaceae.

The function of a second chromosome, and of multichromosomality in general, has been the subject of speculation [2,14,23]. That many of the genes on the Vibrio
Chromosome II have specific environmental functions
has been noted, and the role of the second chromosome
in habitat adaptation has been tested experimentally [23].
Xu et al demonstrated that when V. cholera was grown in
an animal host (rabbit ileal loop) a general shift in gene
expression favored up-regulation of genes on the second
chromosome relative to the gene expression profiles in
exponential growth in vitro. This experimental data
paired with the gross similarities among the chromosome
I from all sequenced Vibrio and the great diversity of
chromosome II, suggests that the second chromosome
represents a collection of accessory elements and might
be mobilized wholesale leading to a complete shift in habitat or niche [2,14].
'Vibrio phylogenies' that are built using MLSA or single-copy conserved genes typically use genes located on
chromosome I [15,24-34] with the exception of intra-specific typing schemes for pathogens [17,22]. This is a sideeffect of choosing stable, conserved, essential, single copy
genes. However, it provides little assurance of representing the history of the entire genome given that Chromosome II is excluded from the analyses.
Given the high degree of mobility Vibrio genetic elements are presumed to have, it is possible that the two
chromosomes have distinct and conflicting histories.
There are currently 9 completely assembled Vibrio
genomes available in the public databases and over 30
partially sequenced genomes. We explored these
genomes to construct phylogenies for each of the two
chromosomes using three approaches. First, single copy
genes from each chromosome were assembled en suite
and a phylogeny for each chromosome was inferred from
these concatenated sequences. Second, the organization
and gene content at the origins of replication of each
chromosome (OriI and OriII for chromosomes I and II,
respectively) were studied. Third, the genes from near the
two chromosomal origins of replication were studied and
their phylogenies estimated individually.

Results and Discussion
Chromosome Phylogenies

The inferred phylogenies for the two chromosomes are
congruent (Figures 1 and 2) and contain the expected
major features, such as Photobacterium being basal to the
Vibrionaceae and V. fisheri forming the next most basal
clade. There are no unexpected sister taxa. The results of
this analysis are compatible with published multi-locus
analyses. However, instead of using 6 or 8 genes commonly used in MLSA, this analysis included 142 genes
from chromosome I and 42 from chromosome II. These
single copy genes include a range of functions including

Page 2 of 13

metabolism, information processing, flagellar structure
and cytoskeletal components; as such, they represent
sampling points from various pathways and genomic sections from around the entire genome. The concatenation
of these well conserved genes provides a shared signal for
the chromosomes as a whole, despite only composing a
small fraction of the entire genome. The genes included
in the analysis are listed under Additional files 1 and 2.
The chromosome I tree is easily rooted by the various
other genomes included in the analysis. All of these other
clades fell together along accepted taxonomic lines. The
most closely related strains in the tree are the V. cholerae
strains; that clade is effectively unresolved because the
internal distances are too short. The chromosome II tree
cannot be rooted in the same manner as chromosome I
because there is no obviously available outgroup: the
chromosome II of P. atlantica is not homologous to the
chromosome II of the Vibrionaceae being analyzed. However, rooting it identically by using the information from
the chromosome I tree preserves the branching order of
each tree. Thus, the 'mean field' approximation for the
phylogeny of the two chromosomes is congruent at the
species level. There is insufficient resolution among V.
cholerae strains and too few members of other species to
make inferences at a finer phylogenetic scale.
Origin of Replication Organization

The second method of analysis, studying the gene organization at the origins of replication (Ori), supported the
finding that the two chromosomes share a single phylogeny at the species level. This method of analysis was more
advantageously applied to chromosome II than chromosome I: Gene order in the region immediately surrounding the chromosome I origin appears too highly
conserved between species to provide robust data on its
phylogeny (Figure 3; expanded in Additional files 3 and
4). However, gene content is informative in that region
suggesting that the species largely conform to the
expected clustering even though the tree is not well supported (Figure 3). The difficulties are caused by a paucity
of organizational changes that differentiate species at
OriI - such as the inversion of three genes that sets apart
the V. fisheri. Frequently, a change is unique to a
sequenced strain and not shared by other members of its
species. This can be extraordinarily disruptive of a distance estimate if the number of unique differences is
large. In particular, at least three obvious saltations in the
gene content introduce spikes of noise. In V. cholerae B33,
an apparently mobile genetic region has imposed itself
very close to the origin of replication. These 18 genes,
almost as large as the region to be compared, interrupt an
otherwise absolutely conserved region shared by the
other Vibrio cholerae. A 9 gene region in Photobacterium
sp. SKA34 contains several transposon and transposase

genes. Similarly, 16 gene region in Vibrio splendidus
MED222 interrupts an otherwise conserved region with a
number of secretory system genes; it lacks apparent
mobility elements which would explain its origin. Among
the photobacteria, the flanking regions sometimes differ
dramatically, as well, which disturbs the phylogeny with a
very long branch, and the Vibrio cholerae appear to have
inverted the entire region - but this would not impact a
gene content analysis.
Gene presence/absence data is more informative in the
regions surrounding the origin of chromosome II, even
though across the breadth of the Vibrionaceae, the areas
adjacent to the origin of replication have been relocated
to such an extent that it is not practical to reconstruct
their movement from as few genomes as are currently
available. This is not unexpected, given how thoroughly
shuffled chromosome II is relative to chromosome I [21];
see also Additional file 5 to explore the global rearrangement of chromosome II. Within a relatively short distance of the origin, however, genes can be reliably
identified as orthologous and used in a presence/absence
analysis. The origin was extended in each direction by 10
kb. As described in the methods, a gene presence/
absence tree was constructed and this led to a distance
tree entirely consistent with the mean-field approximation across Chromosomes I and II (i.e. Figures 1 and 2).
Origin of Replication Genes

The phylogenies estimated for each of the gene families
near the origin support the estimations derived from the

two chromosomes overall. This third method of analysis
led thus to the same conclusion as the other two. Table 1
lists the genes studied at each origin, focusing on their
gene phylogeny, while Table 2 specifies the longer annotation names for the genes used in Table 1 and the type of
data (DNA or AA) used to create the trees. The genes
within the Ori regions are naturally subject to horizontal
gene transfer and mutational noise, like all other genes.
Two of them are too conserved or too noisy to present a
clear phylogenetic signal over the Vibrionales. In these
cases, ALrT (approximate likelihood ratio test) and bootstrap support are lacking across the entire tree (2/28
genes on chromosome I, 0 on chromosome II). Many
other trees have limited support for individual clades.
Clades with less than 0.05 ALrT [35] support or less than
70% bootstrap support were reduced to polytomies. In
addition, the long branch of V. cholerae sometimes distorts other elements in the tree. In 8/28 trees from chromosome I and 2/12 trees derived from chromosome II,
removing the cholera clade from the tree also restored a
topology consistent with the mean-field tree in the other
portions of the tree where previously it had been inconsistent with the hypothesis (labeled B in the first column
of the table). Finally, one clade (V. parahaemolyticus, V.
alginolyticus, V. campbellii, V. harveyi) was reliably
monophyletic but presented numerous permutations in
its internal structure. At OriI 9/28 genes presented
diverse variants in this clade; at OriII, 3/12 genes presented variability within this clade. Ignoring this variation, 16/28 genes from chromosome I and 10/12 genes
from chromosome II confirm the chromosomal phylogenies inferred by the above methods (labeled A). Finally,
the remaining two genes on chromosome I lead to inferences that conflict with the others by placing V. splendidus in the V. fischeri clade (basal to its expected position,
see Figure 4). Genes in OriI show more variation in phylogeny but fewer genes are available for study in OriII.

Conclusions
Rampant horizontal gene transfer and plasmid exchange
might create doubt as to the fidelity of paired chromosomes to one another. Further, this genetic mobility can
create serious difficulties for anyone reconstructing a
phylogeny for something as large as a chromosome, just
as they do for someone inferring organismal and species
phylogenies. Here, these difficulties have been overcome
by using a range of methods that operate at different temporal and genetic scales. At the smallest scale, a number
of individual gene phylogenies were reconstructed. At an
intermediate scale, the gene content of a conserved
region was used to infer a phylogeny. At the largest scale,
concatenation of predominantly chromosome specific
genes (though they may, in other genomes, be transferred
among the chromosomes) provided an estimate of the

The genes surrounding the origins of replication otherwise identified by short names are described by their longer annotation names. In
addition, the data (DNA or AA) used to create the trees is listed. This relates to the degree of conservation in the data; more conserved
sequences require DNA trees to provide signal, less conserved sequences require AA trees to avoid excessive noise.

history of the whole chromosome. In each case, the
observed patterns were consistent - though, while many
individual genes do not present a conflicting individual
history, they may not support the hypothesis for lack of
signal.
This congruence between the whole of the chromosome and the origin of replication suggests that the
region around the origin of replication is either too large
to relocate or is difficult to transfer because of its specific
function. Individual genes in this region may experience
horizontal gene transfer - witness the inclusion of a
mobile genetic region in V. cholerae B33. Individual genes
also appear amenable to transfer, deletion and insertion.
More than being able to create a relative history for
each chromosome, it appears that since the origin of the
two chromosomes in the ancestral Vibrio, they have continued as a pair. This suggests that they have also followed
the cell itself; that we have a consistent phylogeny for the
Vibrio species themselves - at least, the ones included in
this analysis. Further genome sequencing would allow a
similar analysis to provide the 'definitive' phylogeny of the
Vibrio, but at much greater effort per strain than for
MLSA [33]. MLSA schemes currently devised provide a
mean field estimate of the phylogeny of Chromosome I;
thus, as they are expanded to include increasing numbers
of genes, those phylogenies are expected to agree with the
phylogenies derived from studying the origins of replication. This suggests several genes that might be used in an
MLSA of the Vibrionaceae, including Alpha, DnaN, and
YidC from Chromosome 1 and ParA2 and GluP from
Chromosome 2. These genes have potential primer
sequences that are hypothetically capable of creating phylogenetic trees with the highest resolution and consistent
signal so that they are comparable to the trees found in
this study. It is a pleasing conclusion that separate MLSA
schemes will not have to be executed for each chromosome independently.

Methods
Chromosome Phylogenies

Mean field approximation refers to the generalized phylogeny of the entire chromosome, regardless of differing
histories. This was accomplished conceptually by means
of concatenated gene trees for single copy homologous
genes whose relatives are most easily determined and
whose chromosomal affiliation is most certain. The
restriction that the genes had to be single copy is meant
to limit the analysis to orthologs while excluding paralogs. To select the genes for this analysis, a database of
genomes was created. All the available Vibrionaceae
(Vibrio and Photobacterium) genomes as well as an
assortment of other gamma proteobacterial genomes
(Additional file 6) were selected for analysis. All 62
genomes were broken down into lists of ORFs, which

Page 10 of 13

were entered into a MySQL database with their DNA and
protein sequences as well as other identifying data. The
entire suite of protein sequences were BLASTed against
each other and the resulting hits were processed with
orthoMCL v 1.4 to identify protein families [36]. A significant parameter used in orthoMCL was an inflation value
of 1.5. Genes representing single copy gene families on
the different chromosomes were aligned [37], stripped of
their gaps, concatenated, and 100 kb, chosen as individual
random sites, was chosen as the input for PhyML [38].
Phylogenies for Vibrio and Photobacterium chromosome I and II were based on the complete and incomplete
published genomes with P. atlantica and Shewanella sp.
ANA3 serving as the outgroup. Initially, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis was proposed as an outgroup for the
chromosome II phylogeny. P. haloplanktis, unlike other
sequenced pseudoalteromonads, has a second chromosome. However, that chromosome appears to have a distinct, plasmid-like origin of replication and a GC-skew
that indicates unidirectional replication [39]. It shares
several genes with the Vibrio chromosome II, but it is
unclear how, if at all, it might share a substantive phylogeny with the Vibrio chromosome II. It contains presumably essential housekeeping genes, despite its otherwise
plasmid-like features and likely represents a second origin of multi-chromosomality within the gamma proteobacteria. As a result, though genes from P.
haloplanktis chromosome I were used as an outgroup to
Vibrionaceae chromosome I, genes from P. haloplanktis
chromosome II were not included in any analysis of
Vibrionaceae chromosome II.
Initially, only completed Vibrionaceae genomes were
analyzed for phylogeny of chromosome II. The incomplete genomes were then added to the analysis; genes represented multiple times in these genomes were excluded
from the analysis. Incomplete genomes of Vibrio cholerae
B33, Vibrio harveyi HY01, Vibrio cholera MZO-2, and
Vibrio angustum S14 were excluded from this tree
because they appeared to be missing members of gene
families shared by the other genomes, even quite closely
related conspecific strains. Finally, all the selected genes
were processed as above, under the assumption that in
the incompletely sequenced strains, genes particular to
chromosome II in the complete genomes remained on
chromosome II. With significantly fewer taxa in chromosome II than chromosome I, comparison for phylogenetic
congruence involved eliminating a given taxa from the
comparison if it was missing from one of the trees, and
only using taxa present in both trees.
Origin of Replication Organization

The origins of replication were studied first in the complete genomes, where they are identifiable by GC skew,
annotation, and common gene content and organization.

Figure 4 Aberrant tree. Tree inferred from the gene Asub on Chromosome I that is inconsistent with the trees inferred by other methods as described in this paper, including the trees for the individual gene phylogenies at other nearby genes. In this tree, the V. splendidus clade is found next
to the V. fisheri clade, making it basal to its expected position. This tree is also referred to as "I" in Table 1, column 1. As shown, the tree is not fully
resolved and branches with low support have been collapsed.

In the incomplete genomes, orthologous regions were
identified by both gene content and skew. When the
expected gene families and gene order coincided with
appropriate shifts in skew, the origin was identified. For
unfinished genomes, the origin could not be used in this
analysis if it was broken up over several small contigs, but
when the entire region was readily assembled in an
unmistakable fashion, those contigs were included in the
analysis.
The gene families derived from the above database
were used to identify orthologs. Four core genes present
in virtually all the genomes immediately at the origin
were identified and used to anchor the analysis. From
their furthest start and stop codons, regions 10 kb (OriII)
and 20 kb (OriI) stretching outward were defined. These
distances were chosen to balance issues of signal and
noise. Particularly for OriI, a shorter region was uninformative because there were too few differences in gene
content. For both of the chromosomes, as the regions
grew larger, genome rearrangements were encountered
that would wash out any signal from similarities in gene
content at the origins themselves.

The genes within the selected regions were labeled by
family and this data was used to produce a list of genes
present in each region. This data was used to produce a
pairwise distance estimate.
Dist = ( A − B) / A

Where:
A = the smaller number of labeled genes in either of the
two regions (i.e. in genome 1 or 2)
B = the number of families shared by the two regions
(i.e. in the 10 or 20 kb regions on both genomes)
These pairwise distances were used to construct a
square matrix; neighbor.exe from PHYLIP [40] was used
to construct a neighbor-joining tree (settings; 10000 jumbles, root, otherwise default).
Origin of Replication Genes

The genes surrounding the origins of replication were
grouped into families by similarity and synteny as
detailed above. The phylogenies of the genes were estimated using PhyML-aLRT (settings; AA or DNA depending on data set, otherwise default) and strict consensus
trees were created from the phylogenies. The individual

Kirkup et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:137
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/137

gene trees were annotated with the necessary rearrangements to fit a largely resolved consensus tree. PhyMLaLRT was employed due to its ability to rapidly calculate
the likelihood gain of all branches, allowing those without
sufficient signal to be collapsed. As such, the cholera
clade in particular contains insufficient divergence to be
accurately resolved based on these genes.
The consensus tree arrived at by consensing the individual gene phylogenies estimated from genes near the
origins of replication was compared to the trees derived
from the other two methods. Common tools used for
sequence and tree visualization included Dendroscope
[41], BioEdit [42], and Artemis [43].
