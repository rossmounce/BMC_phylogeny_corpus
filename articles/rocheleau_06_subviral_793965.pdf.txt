Abstract
Background: Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human hepatitis delta virus form
the 'brotherhood' of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs. For
most of these species, it is generally accepted that characteristics such as cell movement,
replication, host specificity and pathogenicity are encoded in their RNA sequences and their
resulting RNA structures. Although many sequences are indexed in publicly available databases,
these sequence annotation databases do not provide the advanced searches and data manipulation
capability for identifying and characterizing subviral RNA motifs.
Description: The Subviral RNA database is a web-based environment that facilitates the research
and analysis of viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses, the human hepatitis delta virus, and related
RNA sequences. It integrates a large number of Subviral RNA sequences, their respective RNA
motifs, analysis tools, related publication links and additional pertinent information (ex. links,
conferences, announcements), allowing users to efficiently retrieve and analyze relevant
information about these small RNA agents.
Conclusion: With its design, the Subviral RNA Database could be considered as a fundamental
building block for the study of these related RNAs. It is freely available via a web browser at the
URL: http://subviral.med.uottawa.ca.

Background
Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human
hepatitis delta virus (HDV) are the smallest known infectious RNA agents, identified as the Subviral RNAs. The
HDV genome consists of a small single-stranded, circular
negative sense RNA genome (~1,700 nucleotides, nt) containing self-cleaving motifs (i.e. delta ribozymes), and a
single open reading frame (ORF) encoding two viral proteins (HDAgs) [1]. HDV requires the hepatitis B virus
(HBV) surface antigen for virion assembly and dissemination. Viroids are small non-coding single-stranded circular

RNAs (~400 nt) which are unencapsidated and replicate
autonomously into host plants [2]. Viroids are grouped
into two families based on the presence or not of conserved regions, hammerhead ribozymes and on their subcellular localization (nucleus or chloroplast). Satellites do
not possess genes encoding proteins needed for their replication and depend on helper viruses for their multiplication. Satellites include both satellite viruses and satellite
nucleic acids. Satellite viruses consist of single-stranded
RNA genomes encapsidated by satellite-encoded proteins.
Satellite RNAs are a sub-group of satellite nucleic acids

and include double-stranded satellite RNAs, and singlestranded satellite RNAs [3]. Double-stranded satellite
RNAs are encapsidated by helper virus coat proteins. Single-stranded satellite RNAs possess genome that do not
encode a capsid protein, and are classified into three subgroups: large satellite RNAs which encode proteins, small
linear satellite RNAs, and circular satellite RNAs (also
known as viroid-like satellite RNAs).
Most of the Subviral RNA agents are composed of singlestranded RNA molecules that rely significantly on proteins from their hosts or from helper viruses for replication and propagation [1-3]. In addition, because the
genome of viroids and viroid-like satellite RNAs have no
coding properties and HDV possesses a very limited cod-

ing capacity, it is generally accepted that Subviral RNAs are
mosaics of functional RNA motifs providing specific activities (i.e. ribozymes) and signals for recruiting and triggering host proteins (i.e. RY motif; [4]). Extensive molecular
research in the field of these agents has produced invaluable sequence data that are being deposited into publicly
available databases. However, sequence annotation databases do not provide the advanced searches and data
manipulation capabilities to identify and classify Subviral
species and their RNA motifs. Consequently, we have
designed an online database to facilitate research on Subviral RNA species by presenting a large number of
sequences in a user-friendly format [5]. Here we describe
the implementation of a web-based environment that is
composed of three components (Subviral RNA sequences,

RNA motifs, and related information) and that integrates
various web-based tools to customize and analyze these
sequences and their respective RNA motifs.

Construction and content
The Subviral RNA Database is hosted on a dedicated
server built around a LAMP setup: Linux, Apache, MySQL,
Perl (an operating system (OS), a web-server, a database
and a script language, respectively). This architecture maximizes the speed and permits a superior customization of
the database. In addition, it allows the Subviral server to

offer several web-based tools (e.g. Species Identification
Service, ClustalW, Blast, Weblogo) and web-forms. Using
these forms, users can record directly their entries related
to links, conferences and announcements, which are subsequently validated and dynamically displayed using the
web interface.
To integrate new data autonomously, automated in-house
scripts search for new Subviral RNA sequences, annotations and related publications from the NCBI server. New
sequences are then manually adjusted in order to stand-

ardize sequences among a specific species (i.e. same
sequence origin and same polarity (genomic vs antigenomic) for single-stranded RNA species).

Utility and discussion
From a simple sequence database [5], the Subviral RNA
Database has now evolved into a multi-database system
that integrates data on sequences, structural RNA motifs,
and related information (links, conferences, announcements, publications). The Subviral RNA Database is presented using a new easy-to-use web interface (Figure 1).
Upon entering into the web site, sequences, RNA motifs,
new related publication links and relevant information on
these RNA agents (ex. laboratory links, conferences, and
announcements) can be accessed from the interface.
Moreover, a section presenting a collection of statistics
and a new search engine are now included. The latter is
designed to efficiently search the entire database and to
display the queried information.
The four sections related to Subviral RNA sequences form
the main part of the database (i.e. Viroids, vHDV, Satellite

RNAs, and Related RNAs). All the RNA variants are
indexed according to their families, genus and species in a
classification scheme based on the criteria established by
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) [6]. When not assigned by the ICTV, specific species are classified based on sequence similarities. Selection
of a family leads to a section presenting the complete
names of the various RNA agents, their abbreviation, the
number of sequence variants, their size distribution, the
calculated secondary structure of representative variants,
and the species decimal code assigned by the ICTV database, when available. For each specific RNA species, users
have access to a complete list of the sequence variants and
links to identical sequences. Identical sequences for a specific variant could indicate enhanced in vivo sequence fitness. In addition, links to known RNA motifs specific for
each variant are indicated. From this section, users can
select sequences, individually or in groups, and display
them under various formats for further analysis using
users' software. These entries can also be processed
directly on the Subviral server using various bioinformatics tools (see below), which results are either displayed in

will become available, secondary structure predictions of
new RNA motifs will also be implemented.

Because most Subviral RNAs are mosaics of functional
RNA motifs, an RNA motif database presenting the
known motifs associated with the indexed species is now
included. Most of these RNA motifs were determined by
sequence comparison using experimentaly derived motifs
as models. The secondary structures of the motifs without
pseudoknots were also supported thermodynamically
using the Mfold software [7]. Primary sequences of specific motifs can be obtained from structural alignment
representation. The secondary structure of each RNA
motif indexed in the database can also be displayed
dynamically using in-house scripts in plain text or HTML
formatted (Figure 2). When HTML is chosen, important
nucleotides are indicated by a color code. These information can be used to analyze natural sequence deviations
and the variability of the secondary structures for each
RNA motif. Figure 3 shows an example of how the database can be used to obtain information on base-pair covariation and on sequence conservation on the 260 RY
motifs located near the right terminal stem-loop of a
number of viroids of the family Pospiviroidae [4]. This
analysis clearly shows that nucleotides forming the RY
motifs are highly conserved. In contrast, the identity of the
surrounding nucleotides is not conserved but the analysis
of base-pair covariation suggests a strong selection pressure to maintain this region as double-stranded.

The Subviral RNA Database is designed as a robust and
relational database system for these unusual species and
their RNA motifs, and also to function as a resource for the
entire scientific community by providing full public
access to recent sequences, along with many tools to
explore and analyze those data. Users of this database are
encouraged to provide corrections, or other information,
for inclusion in the database via electronic mail mpelchat@uottawa.ca.

Various bioinformatics web tools such as ClustalW,
WebLogo and Blast (which uses the Subviral RNA dataset
as a searchable database) are now accessible directly on
the Subviral RNA Database server. In addition, in-house
tools such as QuickFasta (which offers a quick and easy
way to build fasta files from the Subviral dataset) and a
Species Identification Service have been implemented.
The latter uses a queried sequence and attempts to align it,
using ClustalW, to a set of preselected sequences for each
species and produces a report including a phylogenetic
tree. Finally, sections related to new sequences, new publications, various related links, conferences and
announcements can also be accessed through the database.

Conclusion
At the time of this writing, the Subviral RNA database contains 1949 sequences indexed in 83 species. It comprises
information on 1046 viroid sequences, 83 complete and
508 partial HDV sequences, 299 satellites RNA sequences
and 13 related RNA sequences. Users have also access to
information on 189 type I hammerhead ribozymes, 320
type III hammerhead ribozymes, 8 hairpin ribozymes,
203 delta ribozymes and 260 RY motifs. As soon as they
