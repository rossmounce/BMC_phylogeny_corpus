Abstract
Background: Microsatellite markers are popular genetic markers frequently used in forensic
biology. Despite their popularity, the characterisation of polymorphic microsatellite loci and
development of suitable markers takes considerable effort. Newly-available genomic databases
make it feasible to identify conserved genetic markers. We examined the utility and characteristics
of conserved microsatellite markers in Charadriiformes (plovers, sandpipers, gulls and auks). This
order harbours many species with diverse breeding systems, life histories and extraordinary
migration biology whose genetics warrant investigation. However, research has been largely
restrained by the limited availability of genetic markers. To examine the utility of conserved
microsatellite loci as genetic markers we collated a database of Charadriiformes microsatellites,
searched for homologues in the chicken genome and tested conserved markers for amplification
and polymorphism in a range of charadriiform species.
Results: Sixty-eight (42%) of 161 charadriiform microsatellite loci were assigned to a single
location in the chicken genome based on their E-value. Fifty-five primers designed from conserved
microsatellite loci with an E-value of E-10 or lower amplified across a wider range of charadriiform
species than a control group of primers from ten anonymous microsatellite loci. Twenty-three of
24 examined conserved markers were polymorphic, each in on average 3 of 12 species tested.
Conclusion: Genomic sequence databases are useful tools to identify conserved genetic markers
including those located in non-coding regions. By maximising primer sequence similarity between
source species and database species, markers can be further improved and provide additional
markers to study the molecular ecology of populations of non-model organisms.

Background
Microsatellites or short sequence repeats (SSRs) are relatively small 1–6 base-pair (bp) tandem repeats that are
found in the genomic DNA of pro- and eukaryotes.
Although the majority of microsatellites are located in
non-coding sequences [1,2] and considered to be selec-

tively neutral, some microsatellite loci are located in functional regions and involved in chromatin organisation,
regulation of gene activity and metabolic processes such
as DNA replication and recombination [3]. Microsatellites
exhibit high mutation rates of 10-2 to 10-6 per locus per
generation [4]. The main mutational processes responsiPage 1 of 20

ble for the variability in microsatellites are considered to
be replication-slippage and recombination [3]. Both processes change the length of the microsatellite by altering
the number of repeats of the microsatellite.
Microsatellite variability has been associated with a
number of microsatellite characteristics. Mutation rates of
microsatellites have been found to be taxon-specific [4-6].
Microsatellite variability covaries with allozyme diversity
in a taxon [7]. The number of repeats can predict the variability and stability of a microsatellite motif, with longer
loci found to be more variable, but also more unstable
than shorter ones [4,5,7-9]. The type of microsatellite
motif may affect abundance and variability. For example,
it was found that microsatellites with tri- or hexanucleotide motifs are more frequent in coding than in non-coding regions, possibly because mutations of these
microsatellites in coding regions are less likely to result in
deleterious frameshift mutations [1,2].
The high variability of microsatellite markers and their
straightforward analysis using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have led to their frequent application in studies on natural populations. However, one obstacle to the
wider application of microsatellites is the difficulty of
developing a sufficient number of suitable markers for
any given species. Although microsatellites are ubiquitous
in eukaryotic organisms, their abundance varies across
different groups [2]. Microsatellites are less common, for
example, in birds than in other vertebrates [7,10].
There are two principal strategies to obtain microsatellite
markers. First, microsatellite markers can be developed by
screening genomic libraries [11]. Success rates differ
according to the protocol and taxon, although usually a
medium to high number of polymorphic markers can be
isolated using this approach. Since microsatellites are
present at a relatively low frequency in avian genomes, in
this case their isolation is most efficient using enrichment
protocols. This involves many stages, is a skilled and timeconsuming process and requires significant funding and a
well-equipped molecular laboratory, which are not
always available in ecological and conservation research.
The second method makes use of existing microsatellite
markers isolated in different species to the species of interest (target species). For cross-species amplification tests
("transferability" [9,12]) existing primers developed in
related species are tested for amplification and polymorphism in the target species. One drawback of cross-species
amplification is that success rates decline with evolutionary distance between the target species and source species
[9,13-15]. In birds, most microsatellite markers have been
developed for the orders Passeriformes and Galliformes. Passeriformes is a species-rich relatively recent clade [16] in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/502

which more than 550 microsatellite markers have been
characterised [17]. Several studies have successfully identified additional polymorphic loci by cross-species testing
in birds. The development of complete primer sets from
cross-species amplification tests has been successful in
Falconiformes [18], Galliformes [19-21] and Passeriformes
[15,22-24]. However, in many other avian orders fewer
microsatellite loci have been isolated and, therefore, the
opportunity to develop microsatellite markers by testing
loci from other species is limited.
Cross-species amplification success varies not only
between taxonomic groups, but also among microsatellite
loci. Although many markers fail to amplify even in
closely related species, some markers have higher utility
than others [[9,13-15,25,26], DA Dawson and T Burke,
unpublished data and BIRDMARKER webpage http://
www.shef.ac.uk/misc/groups/molecol/deborah-dawsonbirdmarkers.html]. A few loci, such as HrU2 [26], LEI160
[27], LOX1 [28] and Man13 [29] can be almost universally
amplified across the avian taxa (HrU2 &LOX1: [9,13],
LEI160, DA Dawson unpubl; Man13: DA Dawson and G
Hinten, unpublished data, see also BIRDMARKER webpage). This suggests that some loci are more conserved
than others. Since the degree of microsatellite conservation is usually not known at the time of their isolation,
identifying conserved primers usually involves extensive
primer testing and only a few conserved markers have
been identified to date.
The Charadriiformes order (sandpipers, plovers, gulls and
auks) is an ancient monophyletic avian order of 365 species [30] that probably evolved around 79–102 million
years ago [31]. Recently, the Charadriiformes have become
the focus of a number of studies in evolutionary biology
because they harbour many species with an unusual diversity in mating and parental care strategies, flight metabolism, migratory behaviour and sexual size dimorphism
[32-36]. Appropriate genetic markers would help to
increase the understanding of, for example, the evolution
of breeding systems and the connectivity between populations, but markers are available for fewer than 15
Charadriiformes species. Additionally, many shorebird
populations are declining and genetic markers are needed
to monitor and manage their conservation effectively.
In this study, we examine the potential of utilising the
available published Charadriiformes microsatellite
sequences and the sequenced chicken genome to identify
conserved Charadriiformes-chicken microsatellite loci. Initially, we mapped conserved Charadriiformes microsatellites in the chicken genome. Second, we explored their
cross-species utility across members of the order Charadriiformes. One concern is that conserved microsatellite loci
are located in functional genomic regions and exhibit low

or no polymorphism. Therefore, we compared polymorphism and heterozygosity levels across different charadriiform species. Third, we examined correlates of crossspecies amplification success and polymorphism to predict the utility of other conserved microsatellite loci.

Results
Mapping
Sixty-eight Charadriiformes microsatellite sequences were
assigned to a location on the chicken genome based on
sequence homology (with E-values ranging between E-6
to E-121). Two further sequences (BmaCCAT443 and
BmaGATA464) showed homology to an unknown
chicken homologue that had not yet been assigned to a
chromosomal region. Sixty-four sequences were assigned
to fourteen autosomal chicken chromosomes and four to
the Z chromosome (Calex-26, BmaTATC353, Apy09 and
Mopl3; Additional file 1, Figure 1). The mapping of loci
assigned to the Z chromosome in chicken was validated in

Charadriiformes by analysing the genotypes of birds of
known sex (including males and females). A location on
the Z was supported if all females were homozygous
whilst at least some males exhibited heterozygous genotypes. This was confirmed for all four loci assigned to the
chicken Z chromosome: Calex-26 (based on 42 Kentish
plovers [37]), BmaTATC353 (based on genotyping of 15
marbled murrelets, Z Peery, personal communication),
Mopl3 (126 genotyped mountain plovers, SJ OylerMcCance and J St. John, personal communication) and
Apy09 in whiskered auklet (24 genotyped whiskered auklet individuals, DA Dawson and FM Hunter, unpublished
data).
The microsatellite motif of the charadriiform sequences
was not always retained in the homologous microsatellite
loci identified in the chicken genome (N = 68). A comparison with the chicken genomic sequences revealed that the
same microsatellite repeat motif was present in 32

sequences (47%), a different microsatellite motif was
found in 10 sequences (15%) whilst no microsatellite
repeat motif was found in 26 (38%) of the sequences
(Additional file 1).
Cross-species amplification
In total, we tested 55 'standard primers' (see Methods)
from different conserved microsatellite sequences and 10
primers from anonymous microsatellite sequences. In
both groups a similar proportion of microsatellite loci
was isolated in each of the three test species representing
the suborders Charadri, Lari and Scolopaci (chickenCharadriiformes conserved loci: 13 of 55, anonymous loci:
3 of 10, χ2 test: χ2 = 0.016, df = 1, P = 0.90). In 17 of 55
conserved sequences we obtained a specific product for all
three species, whilst we did not obtain specific products
for any of the anonymous sequences in all test species.
When we compared the proportion of species in which a
primer set amplified a product, primers designed from

conserved sequences significantly outperformed primers
from anonymous sequences (Figure 2a, amplification success: medianconserved = 0.667, mediananonymous = 0.167,
Wilcoxon rank sum test: N = 65 (55/10), df = 1, W = 469,
P < 0.001).
For 24 conserved sequences we designed a second, consensus, primer set with primer binding sites in the conserved regions of the flanks. Cross-species amplification
rates were higher for consensus primers than standard
primers for the same microsatellite sequence (Figure 2b,
Wilcoxon matched pair test: N = 24, df = 1, V = 96, P =
0.006). Amplification success increases when the annealing temperature is reduced [38]. Hence, the reason for the
improvement of amplification could have been that consensus primer were designed and tested at lower annealing temperatures (consensus primers: 50–62°C, standard
primers: 54–66°C). However, 19 out of 24 (79%) consensus primers amplified best at annealing temperatures of

tested in each group.

54°C (Additional file 1) and the difference in amplification success between consensus and standard primers
remained significant (Wilcoxon matched pair test: N = 19,
df = 1, V = 41.5, P = 0.023) when only the 19 loci were
analysed.
Twenty-three of 24 consensus primer pairs exhibited
between one and three base-pair mismatches between the
chicken and Charadriiformes primer binding sites. Each
mismatching primer base was replaced by a suitable
degenerate base which included both of the possible
bases. The use of degenerate bases will dilute the effective
concentration of the primer with the highest affinity to the
target, which could potentially reduce amplification efficiency. However, amplification success was not related to
the number of degenerate bases per primer pair (Kruskal
Wallis test: N = 23 (6/12/5), df = 2, χ2 = 1.20, P = 0.55).
Among conserved sequences, cross-species amplification
success was only significantly associated with the E-value
of a given sequence (Table 1, Figure 3). E-values for loci
for which primers amplified in all tested species ranged
from E-110 (Mopl18, Additional file 1) to E-21
(BmaTATC371). Standard primers from sequences with
lower E-values amplified in a higher proportion of
charadriiform species than those with higher E-values
(Figure 3, Generalised Linear Model (GLM) with binomial error structure: df = 53, B = -0.02, t = -2.58, P =
0.013).

Polymorphism and observed heterozygosity
Twenty-three of 24 conserved microsatellite loci exhibited
two or more alleles in an average of 3 of the 13 species
tested (Table 2, range 1 to 8 species per locus). There was
considerable variation among species in the number of
polymorphic markers. Excluding the markers that had
been isolated in the target species, we found on average
that 7 of 24 markers per species (range 0–11 polymorphic
loci/species) were polymorphic when tested in four unrelated individuals from a single population (Figure 4).
None of the 23 markers included in polymorphism tests
were sex-linked based on the genotypes of known male
and female birds (individuals were sexed using P2/P8
primers [39]) and on their chromosome location predicted from the assembled chicken genome (Figure 1).

The proportion of species in which a microsatellite was
polymorphic was significantly associated with three factors: i) microsatellite motif, ii) repeat length and iii)
whether the microsatellite was interrupted or not (Table
1). Microsatellite loci with dinucleotide motifs were polymorphic in more species than those consisting of tetranucleotides (GLM with quasibinomial errors: df = 19, B = 1.00, t = -2.15, P = 0.045). Microsatellites with longer
repeat regions were polymorphic in more species than
those with shorter repeat regions (GLM with quasibinomial errors: df = 19, B = 0.02, t = 2.22, P = 0.039). Interruption of the microsatellite repeat regions reduced the
proportion of species in which a locus was polymorphic
(GLM with quasibinomial errors: df = 19, B = -1.02, t = 2.09, P = 0.051).

Correlates of cross-species amplification
Amplification success was not associated with genetic distance between microsatellite source species and test species in this intraorder analysis of charadriiform
microsatellite markers. The E-values obtained from blast
searches served as a better predictor for the width of taxonomic range in which a microsatellite could be amplified.

When we examined the variability of loci in the larger
Kentish plover, whiskered auklet and ruff samples (Table
3) we found that the mean observed heterozygosities
across the three test species were lower than heterozygosities in the species in which a microsatellite had been originally isolated and characterised (Wilcoxon matched pair
test: N = 23, V = 226, P < 0.001). Heterozygosity in all
three test species declined with increasing genetic distance
to the microsatellite source species, and the decline was
highly significant in all three species combined (Figure 5,
Generalised Linear Mixed Model [GLMM]: df = 33, B = 0.04, t = -7.59, P < 0.001). An alternative model excluding
those loci that had been developed in the target species
gave the same qualitative results (model not shown).

Discussion
We have shown that sequence information from annotated genomes can be used to identify and map conserved
microsatellite loci. Our study has two major findings.
First, primers designed from conserved microsatellite loci
amplify across a wider taxonomic range than those
derived from anonymous microsatellite loci. Second,
when highly conserved regions of the flanks of a microsatellite are used as the primer binding sites amplification
success can be further improved.

Using 1147 primers derived from conserved regions of the
human genome, Housley et al. [41] identified the number
of primer mismatches and primer GC content as factors
that predicted amplification success in mammals. In contrast to our study, Housley et al. investigated amplification success using generally conserved sequences in
mammals and did not specifically use variable loci such as
microsatellite loci. Second, they aligned genomic
sequences from human with genomic sequences from
dog, rat or mouse to perform intragroup-comparisons of
amplification success, whilst we used an outgroup taxon
(chicken) for sequence alignments and comparisons.
Third, our sample size was much smaller than the one
used for the intra-mammalian comparison due to the
small number of microsatellite loci available from the
Charadriiformes. The results of both studies are very similar, despite the large differences in study design. Sequence
conservation (represented by the E-value) was the main
predictor for amplification success of a genetic marker.
Most loci with an E-value lower than E-20 in chicken
amplified in all the tested species, suggesting that this
could be a critical value that indicates the utility of a
marker for cross-species amplification within the order
Charadriiformes. Consensus primer sets that had been
designed to include the smallest number of mismatches
between sequences amplified better than standard primers, in which no action to counteract the presence of mismatches had been taken. Amplification success of
consensus primers was generally very high across the three
suborders of Charadriiformes (Figure 2b).
The number of mismatches per primer pair did not affect
amplification success among the consensus primers for a
number of possible reasons. First, we restricted the
sequence mismatches between chicken and Charadriiformes for consensus primer pairs to a maximum number
of three. Second, we introduced degenerate bases to
account for those mismatches. Under our primer design
rules we attempted to minimise the number of mismatches and positioned mismatches away from the 3' end
for a given primer, although the position of the mismatch/degenerate base did not affect amplification success significantly (data not shown). Third, inclusion of
degenerate bases might have led to amplification failure
due to the reduced concentration of suitable primer. However, we did not observe such failures, probably because
the total primer concentration in our tests was relatively

mutation rates than tetranucleotide microsatellites in

decrease in the mutation rate, which was interpreted as
being due to interruptions reducing the opportunities for
replication slippage [6].

high (1 μM, see Methods). Thus the amplification success
of our consensus primers does not suggest that primers do
not have to be a good (or perfect) match for amplification
success.
Primmer et al. [13] proposed that the proportion of microsatellite loci that can be amplified declines with increasing genetic distance between source and target species.
Our results suggest that the slope of the amplification
decline is predominantly locus- specific and will largely
depend on the conservation of the sequences flanking the
microsatellite repeat. Microsatellite loci with highly conserved flanks can be amplified in more distantly related
species whilst those with non-conserved flanks may be
useful only in a very narrow taxonomic group.
Polymorphism
Polymorphism of conserved loci varied greatly between
species. The proportion of species in which a microsatellite exhibited more than one allele was associated with
microsatellite repeat length, motif and whether it was
interrupted or not. Our results are consistent with previous theoretical and empirical studies that examined the
effect of these microsatellite properties on mutation rate
[4-6,8] and polymorphism [7,9]. A positive association
between repeat length and polymorphism was found
empirically in other vertebrates, arthropods and plants
[4,7-9]. Dinucleotide microsatellite loci exhibited higher

Although we showed that the amplification success of
existing microsatellite markers can be improved by redesigning primer sets, heterozygosity was generally lower in
test than source species. Polymorphism declines faster
with evolutionary distance than amplification success
[14]. A possible explanation is that polymorphism of
many loci evolved in the recent evolutionary past and
therefore is confined to a phylogenetically narrow range
of taxa. This argument is supported by the findings of
other studies in amphibians, birds and mammals [9,14]
that show that the probability of polymorphism drops
rapidly with increasing evolutionary distance between
source and target species. However, the steepness of the
decline appears to be locus-specific. There was large variation in the taxonomic range over which a given microsatellite was polymorphic. For instance, the locus
BmaTGAA523 was polymorphic in only two of twelve species when tested in four unrelated individuals, whilst
another locus, BmaTATC371 isolated in the same species
and with a similar repeat length, was polymorphic in
seven of twelve species tested. Of the 24 charadriiform
microsatellite markers we tested, a median of 7 markers
was polymorphic per species (12 charadriiform species
tested). Five or more polymorphic markers were found in
five of the six test species where previously no microsatellite markers had been identified. For another six species
where markers had already been characterised, we found
between three and 11 new polymorphic markers. The
number of species in which these 23 markers are useful is
likely to increase because we tested them only in 12 of the
365 species of Charadriiformes. Finally, we assessed the
variability of markers only within a single population of
each species to make the detected level of polymorphism
comparable to the polymorphism in the source population. Some markers that we found to be monomorphic
may exhibit population-specific polymorphism or have
different alleles fixed in different populations and turn
out to be useful to investigate population differentiation.
The observed decline of polymorphism in relation to the
genetic distance to the source species could be partly
explained by the selection process during the isolation of
microsatellite sequences ('ascertainment bias hypothesis',
[7,42]). During the construction of microsatellite libraries, typically long microsatellite sequences with 10–30
repeat units are selected to maximise the probability that
a locus is polymorphic in the species in which it is developed. Moreover, only the sequences of the polymorphic

loci are normally submitted to sequence databases, which
means that monomorphic loci with fewer repeat units in
the source species are lost because they are not reported.
However, repeat expansion and microsatellite polymorphism are likely to reflect the recent evolutionary history.
Therefore the submission of sequences of monomorphic
loci to genomic databases might enable the identification

of further conserved markers and the development of useful markers through cross-species amplification.
Differences in the degree of microsatellite polymorphism
among species are not exclusively attributable to recent
divergence in microsatellite evolution. Genetic diversity,
which is often reflected by microsatellite polymorphism

varies among populations and species. Low microsatellite
polymorphism can indicate depleted genetic variability
due to bottlenecks, genetic drift or inbreeding. If genetic
diversity for a given population is low, a combination of
screening of known microsatellite loci and the development of microsatellite markers using the conventional
library approach may be helpful in finding a suitable set
of polymorphic markers.
Only a handful of shorebird populations have been investigated for genetic diversity. Low genetic variability of
both allozymes and of the mitochondrial control region
has been found in several species of sandpipers that breed
in the high Arctic and it has been hypothesized that historical population fluctuations that occurred during and
after glaciations are responsible for this low genetic diversity [43]. In our study, the greater sheathbill Chionis alba
showed the least genetic diversity, being monomorphic at
all 23 microsatellite loci that we examined (Table 2).
Greater sheathbills breed exclusively in the Antarctic,
where they live as scavengers close to other bird colonies.
Current population estimates give a stable total number
of approximately 20,000 sheathbills [44], but past climatic fluctuations may have led to a small effective population size similar to those of Arctic breeders. Thus the low
observed microsatellite diversity might reflect a recent
population recovery. Alternatively, the evolutionary distance between sheathbills and the source species from
which we derived the tested microsatellites is too large,
with the microsatellite being lost or all polymorphism
being depleted. Different genetic markers, such as markers
from the mitochondrial control region, other microsatellite markers or highly variable nuclear genes, such as genes
of the major histocompatibility complex, need to be
examined to determine whether the low microsatellite
variability truly reflects a general low genetic diversity in
sheathbills.
Contrary to sheathbills, whiskered auklets and Kentish
plovers showed the highest genetic diversity in our analysis. In the Kentish plover and the whiskered auklet, twelve
of the 23 microsatellite loci tested were found to be polymorphic when tested in four individuals. Excluding the
markers that had been isolated in both species leads to ten
(Kentish plover) and eleven (whiskered auklet) newly
described polymorphic markers. Both species live in very
different habitats and geographical locations. Whiskered
auklets are pelagic feeders that inhabit a number of small
islands in the northern Pacific, whilst Kentish plovers are
cosmopolitans and found at beaches and saline lakes in
temperate and subtropical regions [45]. The high genetic
diversity in both species is reflected in the observed heterozygosities at microsatellite loci that had both been identified in these species by cross-species amplification (this
study) and isolated from enriched genomic libraries

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/502

[14,37]. The high variability of many microsatellite loci in
these species suggests that depletion of genetic variation is
not a general characteristic of the Charadriiformes order,
but rather an attribute of certain species or populations
due to their historical demography and phylogeography.
The possibilities for the application of conserved markers
go beyond examining genetic diversity. Polymorphic conserved markers can be used, for example, to investigate
chromosomal organisation by constructing linkage maps
[46,47]. A major advantage of conserved over conventional markers is that the same loci can be used to investigate and so compare chromosomal structure and genomic
organisation among several different species [17,48].
The sequence conservation of flanking regions can be the
result of a direct functional role or linkage disequilibrium
with functional genomic regions (e.g. fitness relevant
genes, [49]). Selection pressures may affect the variability
of a locus by either restricting polymorphism [1,2] or promoting polymorphism if variability is adaptive [50]. This
can be problematic for applications of genetic markers
that assume their neutrality. However, for common applications such as parentage assignment or estimating relatedness such markers will nonetheless be useful.
Furthermore, if a marker is found to be associated with a
locus that is under selection, its function can be explored
and changes or retention of functionality can be compared under different environmental conditions, and
across different populations and/or taxa.
The conserved markers we designed and characterised are
very convenient to use. All consensus primer sets for the
polymorphic loci amplify under similar PCR conditions
(Ta = 54–55°C, 2.0 μM MgCl2 concentration), which facilitates i) quick and economical screening for amplification
and polymorphism in new target species and ii) efficient
processing, since several loci can be run together in a single multiplex PCR.
Dealing with null alleles
Five of the 24 primer sets that we tested for heterozygosity
had high estimated null allele frequencies (≥ 0.1, CERVUS
2.0) in one of the three test species (Kentish plover, whiskered auklet and ruff, Table 3). There was no obvious relationship between the departure from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium and the number or position of degenerate
bases in each primer pair. Null alleles arise when the
primer sequence does not match the target sequence of a
given allele and the allele therefore fails to amplify. If not
corrected for, the presence of null alleles may interfere
with algorithms to estimate relatedness [51]. Sequencing
the locus in the study species and redesigning the primers
can be used to prevent the occurrence of null alleles. Alternatively, if the proportion of null alleles is low, their

Page 14 of 20

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:502

impact on relatedness estimates can be reduced by using
maximum-likelihood correction methods when computing relatedness relationships [52].
Development of conserved markers in other avian groups
Charadriiformes, chicken and most other modern birds
belong to the Neognathae. Recent molecular data suggest
that the Galliformes, together with the Anseriformes, form a
sister taxon to the other neognath birds [53] and therefore
have the same phylogenetic distance to all Neognathae.
Flanking regions of about one in seven charadriiform microsatellite loci were found to be conserved in chicken.
Since the proportion of microsatellite homologues is
likely to be associated with the phylogenetic distance
between genomic resource species and source species, we
expect a similar proportion of conserved microsatellite
loci to be found between chicken and other neognath
groups to that observed here between chicken and the
Charadriiformes. In fact, for taxa that are more closely
related to chicken (e.g. Anseriformes) we predict an even
higher success rate in identifying suitable microsatellite
markers through data mining.

Genomic sequencing of further organisms will facilitate
the use of already- characterised microsatellite loci for
designing consensus primer sets. In birds, the sequenced
genome of another neognath bird, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) is now available http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/projects/genome/guide/finch. The Zebra finch is phylogenetically closer to Charadriiformes and other neognath
birds than is the chicken, hence more microsatellite
homologues and conserved markers might now be
obtained using zebra finch sequences as a reference.

Conclusion
We have shown that sequence information available from
genomic databases can be used to enhance the utility of
microsatellite markers in studies of evolution and conservation, even for taxonomic groups where few sequence
data are yet available. Sequence information of translated
and untranslated parts of the genome are useful for comparing and designing consensus primers, even when they
involve genetically distantly related taxa such as Charadriiformes and Galliformes. Cross-species amplification tests
can be carried out more efficiently by identifying and utilising conserved microsatellite loci that will amplify across
a broader taxonomic range. By selecting highly conserved
regions of the microsatellite flanking sequence for primer
design, the number of species in which a locus will
amplify can be increased even further. We found that
markers derived from conserved loci with an E-value of E20 or lower amplified across the entire charadriiform
order. Our findings will facilitate the use of markers in
species where no markers have yet been identified and in
species where more markers are needed. To date, 24 verte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/502

brate and 22 invertebrate genomes have been sequenced
and fully assembled (source: http://www.genome.ucsc.ed
u, September 2008). This number is expected to increase
rapidly as sequencing costs decrease. The methodology we
have outlined will make it possible to extend population
genetic and evolutionary studies to further non-model
species that have been previously neglected because of a
lack of sufficient genetic markers.

Methods
Blast search
We searched for available nuclear microsatellite
sequences isolated in species of Charadriiformes that were
deposited before 15 July 2006 in the nucleotide sequence
databases of GenBank, DNA Data Bank of Japan, and the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) through
the EMBL web portal http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/
using the key words "Charadriiformes microsatellite" and
"Charadri* microsat*". Additionally, for one species (oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus), eight primer sets for
polymorphic microsatellite loci had been published [54]
but the microsatellite sequences were not found in the
EMBL database. In this case the authors (R. van Treuren et
al.) generously provided the sequences of the eight polymorphic and 29 further unpublished monomorphic oystercatcher microsatellite loci which were then submitted
to EMBL in agreement with the authors (accession numbers: AM600643-AM600679; see additional file 2).

Only microsatellite sequences that were polymorphic in
the source species and had sufficient flanking sequence for
primer design were considered (i.e. a minimum of 30 bp
of flanking sequence on either side of the repeat motif). In
total, we found 163 suitable microsatellite sequences. All
sequences were checked for duplicates using the MegaBLAST program available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/[55]). Four pairs of homologues were found (K32/LarsZAP26, K56/LarsZAP19,
LarsNX24/Rbg27 and LarsZAP11/Rbg29). LarsZAP26 and
K32 were identical duplicates and the primer set was
designed from K32. For the remaining duplicates the
shorter sequence of each pair was dropped from the analysis (LarsZAP19, LarsNX24, LarsZAP11).
We identified homologous charadriiform microsatellite
loci in the chicken Gallus gallus as follows. Unique microsatellite sequences from the Charadriiformes were compared against the chicken genome database v2.1
(WASHUC 1, Version e! 41, available at http://
www.ensembl.org/Gallus_gallus/) using a WU-BLAST
(Gish W. 1996-2004; http://blast.wustl.edu implemented
in the Ensembl browser with the "genomic sequence
(masked)" and "distant homologies" settings. The E-value
was used as a measure of Charadriiformes-chicken homol-

ogy. The E-value is mainly influenced by the sequence
length of the query sequence and its similarity to the
homologue in the database. In the absence of duplications and gene orthologues, lower E-values represent a
higher probability of sequence homology. All sequences
for which both flanking regions matched the chicken
genome with E-values lower than E-10 were classified as
conserved
sequence
homologues.
Microsatellite
sequences with only one flank producing a good "hit"
were not considered. In this way, we identified 55
charadriiform microsatellite sequences for which homologues were present in the chicken genome (Additional
file 1).
Mapping of charadriiform microsatellite sequences in the
chicken genome
We adapted the Blast methods from [48] to map the
charadriiform microsatellite sequences to the chicken
genome:

i) sequences hitting at one location with both flanks at an
E-value ≤ E-5,
ii) sequences that hit at one location with one flank at an
E-value ≤ E-10 (cf. [48]: ≤ E-5),
iii) sequences that hit at different locations in the genome
were mapped only if the best hit (lowest E-value) was
higher by ≥ E+5 than the next blast hit (cf. [48]: ≥ E+10).
In total, 68 charadriiform microsatellite sequences were
mapped in the chicken genome and displayed using the
program MAPCHART [56] (Figure 1). The recorded locations of centromeres are based on the regions of highest
GC content on the chromosome (following [17]; data
obtained from the NCBIs Gallus gallus Build 2.1: http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/chicken/
index.html.
Cross-species amplification rates of conserved and
anonymous microsatellites
To examine whether cross-species amplification was
affected by the presence or absence of a chicken homologue for a given sequence we designed new primer sets
('standard primers') for a total of 65 loci using PRIMER3
[57]. We did not use already published primers developed
in different laboratories because primer design methods
can be very heterogeneous between different laboratories
and this may have compromised our results [9]. We randomly selected ten microsatellite loci that had hits with an
E-value of E-10 or better of only one flank (anonymous
sequences, Additional file 1) and compared their amplification success with the success of conserved chicken Charadriiformes loci in which both flanks hit at the same
location in the chicken genome with an E-value of E-05 or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/502

lower. For the design of standard primers, we used default
options of PRIMER3 with the following adaptations:
i) melting temperature (Tm) between 50°C and 65°C,
with 62°C as the preferred Tm,
ii) Tm difference between forward and reverse primer <
0.5°C,
iii) we checked for an even distribution of all four nucleotide bases (ascertained by eye),
iv) a primer GC content of 20–60%,
v) a product size between 70 and 450 bp.
The reverse primers of seven of the eleven Kentish plover
Charadrius alexandrinus and two of the five whiskered auklet Aethia pygmaea loci were ordered with "GTTTCTT" 'pigtails' to reduce variation in stutter bands [58]. The forward
primer of each pair was labelled with a fluorescent label,
either FAM or HEX.
Following [40,59] we recognise three major lineages of
Charadriiformes: Lari, Scolopaci and Charadri. All primers
were tested for amplification success in one candidate species from each charadriiform lineage: whiskered auklet
(for suborder Lari), ruff Philomachus pugnax (suborder
Scolopaci) and Kentish plover (suborder Charadri). The
suborders are separated by ΔTmH (DNA-DNA hybridisation value [40]) of 15.6 for Charadrii/Lari-Scolopaci and
12.8 for Charadri-Scolopaci. All primer sequences are provided in a supplementary table (Additional file 1).
DNA was extracted from blood samples that were stored
either in Queen's lysis buffer [60] or absolute ethanol.
One of three extraction methods was used: an ammonium
acetate method [61], a sodium acetate method [62] or an
adapted phenol-chloroform method [63]. All samples
were visualised on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with
SYBRsafe (Invitrogen) to check for DNA quality. DNA
concentration was estimated by measuring the optical
density of a sample at 260 nm using a fluorometer. Each
sample was checked for amplification prior to tests using
the LEI160 primer set [27], a locus that amplifies across all
of approximately 100 various bird species tested to date
(DA Dawson, unpublished data).
Each 10-μl PCR contained approximately 10 ng of DNA
and 0.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline) in the
manufacturer's buffer with a concentration of 1.0 μM of
each primer, 2.0 μM MgCl2 and 0.20 mM of each dNTP.
Loci were amplified by PCR using a thermal cycler (MJ
Research model PTC DNA engine) and the following program: one cycle of 3 min at 94°C followed by 35 cycles at

94°C for 30 s, annealing temperature (temperature gradient from 54–66°C) for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s and a final
extension cycle of 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gel stained with SYBRsafe (Invitrogen) to check for amplification success. Amplification
success was a binary variable, which we defined as 'successful' if a single clean band could be visualised on the
gel; multiple band patterns or no products were recorded
as 'failed'.

an agarose gel. However, when we examined polymorphism on the ABI3730 DNA Analyzer, genotypes contained multiple peaks and the loci could not be reliably
scored. Loci K16 and Calex-08 were found to be expressed
sequence tag (EST) loci. EST loci were not included in the
present study. Microsatellite markers have been previously obtained from EST databases [66,67] and their
cross-species utility is described elsewhere [[68] and DA
Dawson, in preparation].

Cross-species amplification rates of consensus and
standard primers
In addition to the standard primers, we designed a second
pair of consensus primers with a minimal number of mismatches between chicken and shorebird sequences.
Within microsatellite flanks, the degree of sequence similarity varied. Some regions had fewer mismatches
between chicken and shorebirds than others. To identify
conserved flanking regions we aligned shorebird and
chicken microsatellite sequences for 33 sequences with an
E-value of E-19 or lower using the CLUSTAL W algorithm
[64] with the default options implemented in MEGA 3.1
software [65]. For 24 charadriiform microsatellite loci we
were able to design consensus primers with a maximum
of three base mismatches per primer pair (sequences are
provided in Additional file 1). Only one of the 24 consensus primer sets had a perfect match between the Charadriiformes and chicken sequence. Therefore, we introduced
binary degenerate bases into the primer sequence at mismatch positions that provided a consensus for both
sequences. If degenerate bases were introduced and several suggested primer candidates had the minimal
number of three or fewer base mismatches, we chose the
candidate that had base mismatches closer to the primer's
5' end. If a 'pigtail' had been added to the reverse primer
of the standard primer set for a locus, the same 'pigtail'
was also added to the corresponding reverse primer of the
consensus primer pair.

To characterise correlates of microsatellite variability we
investigated two different measures. First we examined the
proportion of 12 test species in which we found two or
more alleles for a given microsatellite locus using four
unrelated individuals. Polymorphism tests were carried
out only with a single primer pair (consensus or standard)
for any given locus. If both consensus and standard primers had amplified across all three test species we chose the
primer set that produced the cleanest product. PCRs were
performed using the same conditions as described for
amplification, with the difference that the annealing temperature was a common temperature at which the primer
set had amplified in all three species. A fraction of the PCR
product was loaded onto an ABI 3730 Analyzer using dye
set DS-30, filter set D and ROX size standard for allele size
determination, and the resulting genotypes were scored
using GENEMAPPER 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems).
The twelve test species were chosen from different
branches of the Charadriiformes to ensure phylogenetic
independence (Kentish plover, whiskered auklet, ruff, collared pratincole (Glareola pratincola), brown skua (Catharacta lonnbergi), gull-billed tern (Gelochelidon nilotica), rednecked phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus), great snipe (Gallinago media), dunlin (Calidris alpina), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta) and
greater sheathbill).

To obtain consensus primers we had to relax the conditions used for primer design (see above). Tm's for consensus primer sets were usually lower than those for the
standard primer sets. Therefore we tested all 24 consensus
primers using a lower annealing temperature gradient
(50–62°C). All other PCR conditions were kept the same
as used in standard primer PCR amplifications. Consensus primers derived from a Charadriiformes-chicken alignment are labelled with the prefix "Gga" (for Gallus gallus).
Polymorphism and observed heterozygosities
Twenty-three of 27 loci that amplified successfully in all
three species were assessed for heterozygosity and polymorphism (Tables 3 & 4). Primer sets for four loci were
dropped. Primers for BmaTATC353 and BmaGACA456
had yielded single amplified products when examined on

The second variable for polymorphism, observed heterozygosity, was determined in whiskered auklet, ruff and
Kentish plover. Here we tested primers in a total of 16
individuals per species. In addition to observed heterozygosity (Ho), we calculated expected heterozygosity (He)
and estimated the null allele frequency using the program
CERVUS v2.0 [69]. We performed tests for linkage equilibrium and compliance to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
using the program GENEPOP v3.3 [70].
Statistical analysis
Non-parametric tests were used to test whether locus conservation and primer design affected amplification success, polymorphism and observed heterozygosity.

To examine the correlates of amplification success and
polymorphism we used several statistical models. Amplification success was a proportional response variable

Page 17 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:502

which could take the value 0/3 (no amplification in any
species), 1/3 (amplification successful in one species), 2/
3 (amplification successful in two species) or 3/3 (amplification successful in all three species). The variables associated with amplification success were examined
statistically by incorporating explanatory variables of the
following three categories into the maximal model: i)
characteristics of the microsatellite locus (repeat length;
whether a microsatellite was interrupted or not; the type
of the microsatellite motif, i.e. whether the repeated base
unit was a di- or tetranucleotide; observed heterozygosity
in the species of isolation; and ΔTmH DNA-DNA hybridisation value between source species and target species as a
measure of genetic distance [40]), ii) characteristics of the
homologous sequence in chicken (single hit or hitting at
multiple locations, microsatellite retained or absent) and,
iii) properties of the standard primers (number of mismatches between chicken and charadriiform sequence).
For each locus only the amplification results for the standard primers went into the analysis.

Statistical analyses were carried out using R software version 2.4.1 [73]. All tests presented are two-tailed.

The response variables for polymorphism, Polymorphism
and observed heterozygosity were tested with the same
explanatory variables as amplification success with the
following deviation: the explanatory variable 'ΔTmH DNA
-DNA hybridisation value' was dropped for the analysis of
Polymorphism since we tested for polymorphism over a
range of species.
To identify correlates of amplification and Polymorphism
we constructed two GLMs with appropriate error structure, including all explanatory variables and two-way
interactions. GLMs were then simplified based on Akaike
information criterion (AIC, [71,72]). Model simplification was performed in rounds, removing the highest nonsignificant parameter at the beginning of each round until
the minimal AIC value was reached. The final models contained only explanatory variables with P-values smaller
than 0.1. Each microsatellite locus was considered as a
unit of analysis.
For observed heterozygosity we used a GLMMs with the
same explanatory variables as for amplification success
(see above) acting as fixed effects. Target species and microsatellite locus were included in the model as nested random effects (target species | locus (target species)).
GLMMs were simplified by removing non-significant
parameters hierarchically, starting with high-order terms
to minimise model deviance. Model simplification was
continued until the current and preceding model deviated
significantly from each other as examined by an F-test.
The final models contained only explanatory variables
with P-values smaller than 0.1.
