Abstract
Background: Investigation of two independent outbreaks of post cataract surgery
endophthalmitis identified the reservoir of epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa.
Methods: Patient isolates cultured from vitreous fluid of all the nine cases and from the peripheral
devices of phacoemulsification machine were subjected to high-resolution Fluorescent Amplified
Fragment Length Polymorphism (FAFLP) analysis.
Results: FAFLP based genotyping of the isolates confirmed nosocomial transmission. Although
biochemical characterization and antibiotic susceptibility profiles grouped all the isolates together,
FAFLP based genotyping revealed that, all the outbreak isolates were derived from 2 different
strains, with independent origins. One group of isolates was traced to phacoprobe and the second
one to the internal tubing system of the phacoemulsification machine used in cataract surgery. In
silico analysis indicated possible evolution in both the clusters of P. aeruginosa isolates due to genetic
polymorphisms. The polymorphisms were mapped to gene products (cell envelope, outer
membrane proteins) possibly having significant role in pathogenesis.
Conclusion: The present study is probably the first one to apply FAFLP typing successfully to
investigate outbreaks of postoperative endophthalmitis (POE) in an ophthalmic setting, which was
able to identify the source, and helped to make rational decisions on sterilization procedures that
halted more cases of infection in these hospitals.

Background
Cataract extraction is one of the commonest surgical procedures performed on large number of patients worldwide. Post cataract surgery endophthalmitis is a serious
sight threatening complication and no effort to prevent it
can be too intense. Over the years, the incidence has
reduced to 0.06%, largely owing to the advances made in
sterilization procedures and understanding of the modes
of post surgical infections [1]. The sources of infection
leading to endophthalmitis have been traced to conjunctival flora of the patients, contaminated irrigation fluids,
intraocular lenses and phacoemulsifiers [1].
Tools of source detection in an outbreak of postoperative
endophthalmitis (POE) have moved much beyond culture of suspected samples and antibiotic sensitivity testing
of the underlying organisms. Conclusive correlation of
suspected organism(s) and the source are necessary to
obtain useful information for outbreak investigation. A
variety of techniques have been used to investigate the
outbreaks including ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) [2]. We report herein the evaluation of
two outbreaks of POE that were investigated for detection
of the source of infection using fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP). Apart from demonstrating the utility of a FAFLP technique in outbreak
investigations, this report also seeks to emphasize the
threat of POE resulting from break in sterility during
phacoemulsification procedures, even under best of circumstances.

Methods
At the time of first outbreak, on June 8, 2003, the Infection Control Committee (ICC) at the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), Hyderabad, India was alerted about a
possibility of outbreak of POE in 4 of 14 patients undergoing cataract surgery. Only 2 of these 4 patients underwent vitrectomy for the management of POE. Table 1

describes the clinical characteristics of these 2 patients.
Preliminary data were obtained telephonically from the
surgeon at the satellite hospital and members of ICC visited the hospital for investigation. During the second outbreak, 7 of 15 patients undergoing cataract extraction on
July 14, 2003 at LVPEI were suspected to have developed
POE and the ICC was notified immediately (Table 1). The
ICC members inspected the operating room, sterilization
room, preoperative and postoperative areas. Vitreous
aspirates/biopsy were collected from all patients and processed as described earlier [3]. Samples were collected from
suspected materials/machines that could be the likely
source.
Surveillance samples
A total of 23 samples were collected from the operating
rooms at both sites of outbreaks. In the first outbreak a
total of six samples from the phacomachine, five samples
from various parts of the operating room and water samples were processed. In particular, samples were swabs
from phacoprobe, internal tubings of phacomachine, and
Ringer's lactate irrigation solution. In addition, testing of
the autoclaves using biological indicators was also performed. The sampling process was repeated and checked
for growth after thorough servicing of the instruments and
terminal sterilization of the operating room.

Similarly, 12 samples were collected in the second outbreak from phacomachines and different parts of the
operating room. In particular, samples were swabs from
phacoprobe, internal tubings of phacomachine, viscoelastic material and Ringer's lactate irrigation solution. All
four steam sterilizers and two ethylene oxide sterilizers
were tested using biological indicators. The sampling
process was repeated as in the first outbreak.
All the positive cultures were subjected to biochemical
testing for identification and characterization. Prelimi-

nary identification was as per the standard microbiological procedures. Automated Biotyping API 20NE
(bioMerieux Inc., USA) was used for phenotypic identification. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by
using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method wherein the following antibiotics were tested: amikacin, ceftazidime,
cefazolin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Results of antibiotic susceptibility were interpreted according to the NCCLS guidelines [4].
All the bacterial isolates were subjected to FAFLP.
Genomic DNA isolation and FAFLP analysis were based
on the AFLP and FAFLP methods described earlier [5-7].
The AFLP technique is based on the selective PCR amplification of restriction fragments from a total digest of
genomic DNA [7]. The technique involves 3 steps: (i)
restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide
adapters, (ii) preselective amplification of sets of restriction fragments and (iii) selective amplification, wherein
additional selective nucleotides were added to the preselective PCR primers that will reduce the total number of
bands by four fold with each additional selective base.
Furthermore, this addition always results in a fingerprint,
which was a subset of the original fingerprints and it is
easy to analyze them due to less number of bands. Thus,
AFLP uses PCR to selectively amplify defined subsets of
DNA restriction fragments from across the whole genome.
In its fluorescent form (FAFLP), one of the selective PCR
primers are fluorophore labeled, making the amplified
fragments visible to an automated DNA sequencer [8].
In brief, genomic DNA digestions were performed using
restriction enzymes EcoRI and MseI. The sequences of the
EcoRI adapters were 5' CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC 3' and 3'
CATCTGACGCATGGTTAA 5', while those of the MseI,
adapters were 5' GACGATGAGTCCTGAG 3' and 3' TACTCAGGACTCAT 5' [7]. For FAFLP secondary selective PCR,
forward primer for the MseI adapter site contained a selec-

http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/4/1/19

tive nucleotide base C and the nonselective reverse primer
for the EcoRI adapter site was labeled with a fluorophore
(EcoRI+0 and MseI+C). These primers were obtained from
commercial source (AFLP Microbial Fingerprinting kit;
California). FAFLP electropherograms were analyzed
using Genescan™ 3.7 and Genotyper™ 3.7 software packages (PE Biosystems) as described earlier [6]. Genescan
electropherograms of all the isolates were visually analyzed by superimposing color-coded amplitypes of isolates and different FAFLP profiles were identified based on
the presence or absence of monomorphic and polymorphic bands. The percentage similarities/differences
between FAFLP patterns were calculated using the Dice
correlation coefficient. Cluster analysis was performed
using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic
averages (UPGMA) algorithm [9].

Results
Vitreous samples of all 9 patients yielded significant
growth of P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa was also isolated
from the phacoprobe and internal tubings of phacoemulsification machine used during surgeries in the first and
second outbreak, respectively. Rest of the environmental
samples were sterile. Isolates belonging to the first outbreak produced green pigment along with metallic sheen,
whereas isolates from second episode were more mucoid
in nature devoid of characteristic blue-green pigmentation
of P. aeruginosa species. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of all the isolates obtained from both the outbreaks
showed identical profiles wherein they were resistant to
cefazolin and sensitive to amikacin, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.
Genescan™ electropherograms of all the isolates were visually analyzed for detection of presence or absence of
monomorphic and polymorphic bands. The single primer
combination used (EcoRI+0 and MseI+C) for FAFLP, generated a total of 19 to 36 differently sized fragments experimentally ranging in size from 50 to 500 bp from all the
isolates. Forty-nine monomorphic and 12 polymorphic
fragments were generated from a total of 11 strains analyzed. Cluster analysis generated 2 distinct clusters among
the strains having discrete genetic lineages and they were
designated as amplitype A and amplitype B (Figure 1).
Isolates belonged to amplitype A, which represented the
cause of first outbreak, generated 19 to 21 fragments.
Twenty-one fragments were monomorphic and 6 bands
were polymorphic in this group. Isolates belonging to
amplitype B that represented the cause of second outbreak
generated a total of 26 to 32 fragments, of which 28 were
monomorphic and only 8 bands were polymorphic. Representative clonal specific FAFLP amplitypes are depicted
in figure 2. Distribution of fragments among different isolates within each cluster (type strain) did not vary significantly.

I Genescan-derived FAFLP profiles from isolates belonged to two outbreaks. FAFLP profiles with similar gel mobility conditions
with equal data points were color-coded and superimposed to visualize differentially amplified fragments (visible as peaks; peak
height indicates the quantity of amplicon generated, and peak position indicates size in base pairs). Polymorphic fragments are
marked with the arrows. The horizontal scale indicates size in bp, while the vertical scale indicates level of fluorescence incorporated (peak intensity). II strains from amplitype B – Polymorphic fragments in base pairs – 76, 96, 152, 188, 256, 292, 383
and 445.

Under all experimental conditions, the characteristic
FAFLP profiles of the strains were reproducibly generated
reassuring their consistency over time. FAFLP performed
for replicates of DNA derived before and after five subcultures of the standard ATCC strain were examined. They
shared a minimum of 98% inter-gel similarity for approximately 35 fragments. Therefore, individual isolates of P.
aeruginosa that shared ≥ 98% similarity (having ≤ 2% of
difference) are likely to be identical clones [10]. Unlike
the similarity in antibiotic profile, all the 11 isolates from
the 2 outbreaks occurring at two separate hospitals
formed two distinct genetic clusters having 18% of genetic
divergence between them, when evaluated by cluster anal-

ysis (Figure 1). Two isolates that were recovered from the
first episode were 100% identical between themselves and
98% identical to a third isolate linked to the phacoprobe.
Majority of isolates (7 of 8) of amplitype B had less than
3% of genetic difference. These 7 isolates obtained from
the second outbreak were closely related, appeared clonal
in origin (Figure 1). Six isolates within this cluster were
99% identical representing identical clones. Further,
within these 6 isolates, 4 were 100% identical.
Predictive in silico methods used on genome sequence of
P. aeruginosa PA01 generated a total of 51 fragments of
sizes between 50 to 500 bp upon selective PCR with single

selectivity of MseI +C [11]. Comparative in silico analysis
with predictive annotation of sequenced PA01 strain was
performed wherein isolates belonged to the two independent outbreaks were subjected to FAFLP, and the
results were extrapolated to the computer-predicted AFLP
data of the P. aeruginosa PA01 sequence. Differential
amplification of 6 to 12 genomic regions (Figure 3–I)
among the isolates and their extrapolations revealed
genetic differences between the isolates. While comparing
GeneScan profiles of isolates belonging to two outbreaks,
L1446, L1443 and ATCC strain showed amplification of
12 bands that were absent in rest of the isolates. The corresponding polymorphisms were mapped to genes coding
for probable porin gene (PA4137), probable ATP-binding
component of ABC transporter (PA4909), rplA gene coding for 50S ribosomal protein (PA4273) and many conserved hypothetical protein ORFs namely PA0234,
PA1370, PA1788, PA2228, PA3350, PA1091, and
PA4203. When comparison of isolates belonging to
amplitype B alone was performed, eight polymorphic
bands were observed in isolates L1446 and L1443 (Figure
3–II). All the polymorphisms observed were reproducible.

ceptibility patterns, implying a single source for both the
outbreaks, which was most unlikely given the distance in
time of occurrence and separate physical location of the
hospitals. On the other hand, FAFLP analysis clearly
showed that there were two independent sources
involved. Molecular typing methods are necessary for confirming the source of an outbreak [1]. In the present study,
FAFLP conclusively identified the isolate from surgery
equipment to be the source for infection in both the outbreaks. Nosocomial contamination and acquisition was
proven in this study. Clustering of the isolates was close
enough to explain their clonal expansion in the respective
hospital settings. Distinct identity of the two strain types
involved in the outbreaks was obvious with 18% genetic
difference between them. This was highly significant with
additional distinctive phenotypic characteristics like green
metallic sheen and mucoid colonies, notwithstanding the
similarity in antibiotic susceptibility.

Discussion
Despite low incidence, POE remains a serious complication [1]. All patients included in this study required pars
plana vitrectomy with intraocular antibiotics and corticosteroid injection. One patient required therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty with intraocular lens explantation
after nine days of treatment. While intraocular amikacin
and vancomycin with dexamethasone were administered
at the time of presentation in all patients, two patients
required repeat injections of ceftazidime and dexamethasone. All patients were given ciprofloxacin eye drops topically along with mydriatics and prednisolone acetate eye
drops. Six patients were also treated with oral ciprofloxacin and corticosteroid. The outcome was satisfactory
in five of our patients and it was poor in remaining four
patients.
Outbreaks of P. aeruginosa POE most likely have an exogenous origin, as they are not normal commensal on skin
and conjunctiva [1]. Understanding the relative importance of the routes of colonization is crucial for the development of effective preventive remedies against P.
aeruginosa POE. The source of infection and routes of contamination are important issues in any hospital [2]. In the
present study, a reservoir source was suspected in each of
these independent outbreaks. Following a thorough sampling of operating room environment and equipment, P.
aeruginosa were isolated from phacoprobe at the first hospital and from the internal tubing of phacoemulsification
surgical equipment in the second hospital. All the isolates
obtained from the clinical and environmental sources
from both the outbreaks showed identical antibiotic sus-

DNA typing methods have emerged as more practical and
reliable option for the investigation of outbreaks. AFLP
analysis has been reported to provide sufficient discriminatory power comparable to the PFGE for the investigation of P. aeruginosa outbreaks [5,6]. Our study provides
additional proof for the above observations. Minor variations are more frequent in P. aeruginosa isolates with
abundant mutations and recombination that contemplates wide spectrum of microevolution in a shorter duration [5,6]. These variations were more evident in our
study wherein only 6 to 8 fragment difference was
observed within the isolates of different amplitypes. Distribution of fragments among different isolates within
each cluster (Amplitype A & B) did not vary significantly.
Comparative in silico analysis with predictive annotation
of sequenced PA01 strain showed lack of amplification of
the 6 to 12 genomic regions in many isolates belonging to
both the clusters (L1445, L1447, L1449, L1450, L1455,
OT3, L1130, L1147 and OT1) and this might be certainly
due to the mutation (indels or point mutation) in the
DNA region bearing EcoRI and MseI restriction sites.
Genetic polymorphisms mapped to genes coding for
probable porin gene (PA4137), probable ATP-binding
component of ABC transporter (PA4909) and COG functional prediction of ORFs PA1091 and PA3350 as glycerophosphate transferase involved in teichoic acid
biosynthesis and flagellar based body P-ring biosynthesis
protein respectively, appears to be significant as all these
four gene products are localized in cell envelope and outer
membrane of the organism [12]. In addition, COG prediction of ORF PA4203 as probable lysR transcriptional
regulator, is known to be very similar to the periplasmic
binding proteins. Modification of these genes in abovementioned isolates might possibly indicate enhanced

ability of these isolates to cause POE through alterations
of their outer membrane porin and efflux proteins [13].

VSS – Clinician who performed cataract surgeries, provided clinical data and evaluated the manuscript.

Genetic polymorphisms mapped to ORFs PA4137,
PA4909 and PA2228 seem to be very important. PA4137
is 52% similar to the oprE gene product of P. aeruginosa
that is homologous to OprD, which is known to be
involved in permeability of imipenem and basic amino
acids [14,15]. PA4909 is 74% homologous to braG gene
product of P. aeruginosa, which is cell membrane protein
bearing ATP- binding domains [16]. COG prediction of
PA2228 as AmpC, beta-lactamase class C family of protein
is usually associated with beta lactam resistance in P. aeruginosa [17]. Lack of amplification of these three regions
in the closely related clones of amplitype A and B appears
to be due to mutation under different stress conditions
prevailing in the host. Further studies are clearly needed to
ascertain functional role of these polymorphisms in ocular infection.

Conclusion
In order to prevent nosocomial outbreaks, apart from
constant surveillance of the hospital environment and
stringent infection control measures, it is important to
apply high utility programs such as FAFLP to determine
source of infection. This study used FAFLP typing to identify the source of infection in two outbreaks of POE. In
addition, FAFLP data extrapolated in silico, would help in
detecting genetic variations among the isolates
