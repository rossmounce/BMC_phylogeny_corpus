Abstract
Background: Horizontal transfers (HTs) refer to the transmission of genetic material between
phylogenetically distant species. Although most of the cases of HTs described so far concern genes,
there is increasing evidence that some involve transposable elements (TEs) in Eukaryotes. The
availability of the full genome sequence of two cereal species, (i.e. rice and Sorghum), as well as the
partial genome sequence of maize, provides the opportunity to carry out genome-wide searches
for TE-HTs in Poaceae.
Results: We have identified an LTR-retrotransposon, that we named Route66, with more than 95%
sequence identity between rice and Sorghum. Using a combination of in silico and molecular
approaches, we are able to present a substantial phylogenetic evidence that Route66 has been
transferred horizontally between Panicoideae and several species of the genus Oryza. In addition,
we show that it has remained active after these transfers.
Conclusion: This study constitutes a new case of HTs for an LTR-retrotransposon and we
strongly believe that this mechanism could play a major role in the life cycle of transposable
elements. We therefore propose to integrate classe I elements into the previous model of
transposable element evolution through horizontal transfers.

Background
Horizontal Transfers (HTs) are defined as the transmission of genetic information between reproductively isolated species. Contrasting with vertical transmission (i.e.
from parents to their progeny), this process has for a long
time been considered as an unusual phenomenon. However, many studies have shown that HTs are frequent

among prokaryotes and that they widely contribute to lineage evolution by acquisition of new genes [1,2]. Several
recent reports have shown that gene flow can also occur
between reproductively isolated eukaryotic species
through HTs. These can involve genes [3-6] as well as
transposable elements [7-9].

Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences
which have the capacity to move from one location to
another in their host genome. They are divided into two
classes according to their mode of transposition (see [10],
for the most recent review). Class I, or retrotransposons,
transpose through a "copy and paste" mechanism. After
their transcription, the RNA is reverse transcribed and
integrated into the genome, leading to the duplication of
the original copy. Retrotransposons can in some cases rapidly increase their copy number. In plants, it has been
shown that these elements, notably the Long Terminal
Repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons, are the main cause of
genome size increase in the genus Oryza [11], in cotton
[12] or in maize [13], beside polyploidy. Class II elements, or transposons, transpose through a "cut and
paste" mechanism. These elements are excised and reintegrated elsewhere in the genome.
Because TEs from both class I and II can be found as free
molecules (either RNA or DNA) during at least one step of
the transposition cycle, they are considered to be more
prone to HTs than other genomic sequences. In animals,
many studies have shown that TEs can move between distantly related species, as for the genus Drosophila [14]
where the P-element invasion constitutes one of the best
described cases of HT in eukaryotes [7,15,16]. In plants,
only two studies have described TE HTs, the first concerning the transfer of a Mu-like element (transposon)
between foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and rice (Oryza
sativa) [8] and the second involving multiple HT of a retrotransposon between seven species of the genus Oryza
[9].
The scarcity of cases of TE HTs in plants may be an indication that they are rare phenomena. Alternatively, it could
only reflect the technical difficulties raised by their detection and correct characterization. In that case, one could
anticipate that the recent accumulation of genomic
resources through large scale genome sequencing projects
will provide more opportunities to study HTs in eukaryotes. As an example, a large amount of genomic sequences
is now available for cereals such as rice, Sorghum and
maize. Since rice diverged from maize and Sorghum 50–70
Mya, it excludes the transfer of genetic information by
hybridization between these species and makes them
appropriate to study HTs following a comparative
genomic approach. We previously demonstrated the multiple HT of a retrotransposon within the genus Oryza [9].
By combining genome-wide comparative genomic analyses and molecular approaches, we present phylogenetic
evidence of the HT of an LTR-retrotransposon, Route66,
from a sugarcane relative to several rice species. Based on
the accumulation of evidence of the occurrence of TE-HTs
in eukaryotes, we also propose to include LTR-RTs in a
general model of TE-mediated plant genome evolution.

Results
Route66 characterization
In a previous study [17], we identified Route66, an LTRretrotransposon which is found in two copies in the
genome of the cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa ssp.
Japonica. One is located on chromosome 2 (nt 1 767 933
to nt 1 772 818, referred to hereafter as Osj2) and the
other on chromosome 6 (nt 25 706 265 to nt 25 701 456,
referred to hereafter as Osj1). Route66 is a 4,890 bp long
LTR-retrotransposon with short 203 bp LTRs. In addition,
only one copy of Route66 is found in the genome of the
indica-type variety 93–11. The copy of Route66 of Oryza
sativa ssp. japonica located on chromosome 2 is 99.5%
identical to that of indica. Dot plot analyses (Figure 1)
show that the japonica and indica sub-species share the
insertion of Route66 on chromosome 2, which implies
that either this insertion predates the radiation of the two
subspecies or that it was introgressed from one subspecies
into the other.

The structural annotation of Route66 confirmed that it is a
complete element in rice, i.e. that it harbors all the features required for its mobility: LTRs, PBS, PPT and a complete gag-pol Open Reading Frame (Figure 2). In addition,
the sequence identity observed between both copies of O.
sativa ssp. Japonica is 99.4% (Table 1). Using a substitution rate of 1,3 × 10-8 mutation/site/year [18], we estimated that Route66 has been active in rice in the last
230,000 years.
Route66 as a new candidate for Horizontal Transfers
In silico detection
In order to investigate the possible origin and the evolution of Route66 in grasses, we looked for its presence in
either the maize or the Sorghum genomes. We mined 12
additional complete copies of the element from maize
and 5 from Sorghum. For each species, the copies of
Route66 exhibit a high sequence identity, suggesting that
they have been active recently in these genomes (Additional file 1). Surprisingly, the rice Route66 copies display
more than 95% sequence identity with those found in Sorghum bicolor, which is unexpected given the date of their
radiation, i.e. more than 50 Mya [19]. Moreover, this
value is higher than that observed between the maize and
Sorghum copies of Route66 (i.e. 91% on average), although
these two species diverged only 12 Mya [20](see Table 1
and Additional files 1 and 2 for detailed results and
sequence alignments). We also compared these values
with those for seven orthologous genes in rice, maize and
Sorghum (Table 2). On average, these genes are 85% identical, which indicates that the Route66 LTR-retrotransposon is far more conserved between rice and Sorghum than
these seven genes. We also studied the phylogenetic relationships between all the Route66 elements found in rice,
Sorghum and maize genomes. The phenetic tree (Figure

3B) clearly shows that the rice copies form a cluster with
that of Sorghum. However, this result is incongruent with
the species phylogenetic relationships established with
known genes [21](Figure 3A).
Wet lab validation
In order to confirm the phylogenetic incongruence
revealed by the Route66 sequences of rice, Sorghum and
maize, we PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced 1 kb
fragments of Route66 from various species of Oryza, Sorghum and Zea. We completed this analysis with the tentative cloning of Route66 homologs in bamboo, Saccharum,
millets, wheat and Brachypodium. We then obtained additional sequences for three wild rice, three Saccharum, two
bamboos, two teosintes and five wild Sorghum species. For
each of the accessions of wild rice, Saccharum and Sorghum
bicolor used in the study, we PCR amplified and cloned the

Adh1 gene and compared the sequences obtained with
that deposited in Genbank for the corresponding species.
We therefore ruled out the possibility that our results were
due to DNA contamination or mislabelling.
The phenetic tree obtained from the cloned sequences is
given in figure 3C. This tree displays some phylogenetic
incongruences, as in the case of that based on the in silico
data above. Both Oryza and Phyllostachis genus (bamboo)
sequences are embedded among Panicoideae whereas,
according to the phylogeny of grasses, they should appear
as outgroups (Figure 3A). All homologs cloned from
Oryza species (O. sativa, O. rufipogon, O. longistaminata
and O. ridleyi) form a clear cluster near the sugarcane
accessions. Interestingly, O. sativa sequences show a 4.5%
divergence with that of the wild sugarcane, Saccharum
officinarum (see Additional file 3 for sequence identities).
By using a substitution rate of 1,3 × 10-8 mutation/site/
year [18], we estimate that this corresponds to a 1,5 My
old radiation whereas both species diverged more than 50
Mya. Surprisingly, Phyllostachis sequences are only 9%
divergent from the copies of maize and Sorghum orthologs
which correspond to a 3,3 MY radiation whereas Bamboo
and Panicoideae diverged 50 MYa.
The subsequent cloning of Route66 in these additional
species provided a better understanding of the origin of
the HT. If the transfer was recent, it is expected that the
copies of both the donor and the receiver species should
exhibit a high sequence identity. As a consequence, they
should appear in the same cluster in the phylogenetic tree.
Route66 is 95.5% identical between rice and Saccharum
officinarum, however the sequences of the genus Oryza are
clustered near to, although not within, those of Saccharum. Further studies should be made to identify the species at the origin of the transfer. Nevertheless, we expect
that this species should be phylogenetically close (or
belong) to the Saccharum genus. A similar observation is
made for the transfer involving Phyllostachis species. A
larger sample of Poaceae taxa should be tested to infer
more precisely the origin of these transfers.
Comparison of the evolutionary dynamics of Route66 with
that of selected genes in rice, Sorghum and maize
For the seven genes mentioned above, we performed an
interspecific non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratio (Ka/Ks) analysis by comparing maize, Sorghum
and rice orthologs. Table 2 shows that all the genes studied are submitted to purifying selection. All Ka/Ks ratio are
lower than 0,3 (Table 2) and they all display similar interspecific sequence identities. We performed a similar analysis on Route66 and we observed that this element is
under selective constraints when interspecific comparisons are performed (Table 1 and Additional file 4).

Discussion
Evidence for horizontal transfer of Route66
Transposable elements are known to evolve faster than
genes and are rapidly eliminated through unequal and
illegitimate recombination [22-24]. Since rice and Sorghum diverged some 50–70 Mya [19,25,26], homologous
retrotransposons are not expected to be found among
these species or, at least, they should exhibit a very low
sequence identity. On one hand, Route66 displays a high
sequence identity (>95%) between rice and Sorghum
throughout the element despite their radiation date (i.e. at
least 50 MYa). On the other hand, Route66 is more conserved between these species than between Sorghum and
maize (>91% whereas these two genera only diverged 12
MYa). This constitutes our first argument in favour of HT.
Furthermore, Route66 is also more conserved between rice
and Sorghum than genes which are under selective pressure (i.e. 85% sequence identity on average) and this constitutes the second and even stronger argument in favour
of the HT.

However, two other mechanisms, i.e. strong selective pressure throughout the sequence of this element and the
reduction of mutation rate in the region flanking the
insertions could alternatively lead to the conservation of
Route66 between rice, Sorghum and sugarcane.
TE domestication, defined as the co-option of TE-encoding proteins into functional host protein is one of the
process which could be responsible for selective pressure
on a TE sequence [27]. A number of studies have demonTable 1: Route66 sequence identity and Ka/Ks values.

strated that domestication is common in some animal
genomes [27] and most of them involved a transposaseencoding sequence [28,29]. Through Ka/Ks analyses, we
showed that Route66 has been subjected to purifying
selection, which could be in accordance with a putative
functional role of this element. However, this could also
reflect the fact that non-functional TEs can not transpose
and are rapidly eliminated from the genome through
deletions, therefore inducing a bias in the Ka/Ks ratio.
However, in the case of domestication, although the element evolves slowly, the topology of the phenetic tree
obtained with Route66 should be similar to that obtained
with the genes classically used for this purpose such as the
waxy or phytochrome genes. This is clearly not the case as
shown in Figures 3A, B and 3C since all sequences from
the Oryza genus (genomic sequences as well as 1 kb fragments) are clustered with those of the Panicoideae
(maize, Sorghum and sugarcane). They clearly cluster near
the sugarcane sequences whereas, according to the phylogenetic relationship of these species, the Oryza genus is
obviously out of the Panicoideae sub-family. This phylogenetic incongruence is thus in agreement with the
sequence identities that were calculated. The high nucleotide sequence identity between rice and Sorghum concerns the whole element. No case of domestication of a
complete element (including the non-coding LTR
regions) has ever been demonstrated so far. For these reasons, we rule out the possibility of the domestication of
the TEs.
An alternative explanation is that the elements could be
inserted into a region with a reduced mutation rate. Our
Ka/Ks survey for the genes flanking both insertions in O.
sativa ssp. japonica showed that they are submitted to
selective pressure but exhibit sequence identity similar to
that of randomly chosen genes such as Waxy, Nod2 and
Gid1 (Table 2). We therefore conclude that both insertion
regions of Route66 in rice are not under a stronger selection than other parts of the genome.
Considering all these results and taking into account current knowledge on transposable element evolution, we
propose that Route66 has been horizontally transferred

into the rice genome. Moreover, we used sugarcane to estimate the age of the transfer. Sugarcane and rice copies harbour 95.5% identity (Additional file 3) therefore we
estimate that the HT occurred recently, during the last million years. However, both sub-species, indica and japonica,
share a common insertion on chromosome 2 (therefore
inherited from their common ancestor, see Figure 1).
Knowing that divergence between indica and japonica
occurred during the last million years [30], these results
tend to demonstrate that the transfer of Route66 occurred
just before or concomitantly with the subspecies radiation. Moreover, the genome of O. sativa ssp japonica harbours one more copy than that of O. sativa ssp. indica. This
indicates that Route66 has been active since the sub-speciation.
Evidence of multiple horizontal transfers
The sequences obtained for the wild rice species, O. rufipogon, O. longistaminata and O. ridleyi, are clustered with that
of O. sativa. The wild rice copies are more than 98.5%
identical to that of O. sativa, which is incongruent with the
species radiation since, for example, O. sativa and O. ridleyi diverged 25 Mya. This data is therefore in agreement
with the occurrence of a horizontal inheritance of Route66
in the genus Oryza. However, further studies should be
made to test if the HT occured independently from the
donor species to the four Oryza species or if the copy was
first transferred to one rice species and then spread
through the genus Oryza. Nevertheless, it was previously
demonstrated that the LTR-retrotransposon RIRE1 has
been horizontally transferred between seven wild rice species [9]. We therefore consider that Route66 could constitute a second example of multiple HTs in the genus Oryza.

We suspect that another HT of Route66 occured between a
Panicoideae and Phyllostachis species. Phyllostachis
sequences display more than 92% sequence identity with
some sequence of maize and Sorghum. Moreover, Phyllostachis sequences are included in the cluster formed by
the Route66 homologs from the Panicoideae species,
although these sequences should be clearly separated
according to the species radiation (Figure 3A). The
hypothesis of HT in Phyllostachis is reinforced by the fact

size (bp)

that Route66 was not found in the Triticeae. Even if we can
not exclude that this absence is due to to a PCR bias, one
explanation is that Route66 has not been vertically inherited in grasses although we can not rule out that the element was lost in the ancestor of the Poideae sub-family.
This could be tested by the analysis of a larger sample of
Pooideae species. The high conservation of Route66
between Phyllostachis and maize as well as the phylogenetic incongruences are unexpected and could be the
result of a second HT of Route66 involving Bambusoideae.
However, this needs to be ascertained by supplementary
analyses.
Mechanisms involved in Horizontal Transfers
Based on what is known in both animals and plants, three
main mechanisms have been invoked to explain HTs [31].
The first is a direct plant-to-plant transfer. This has been
well described in the case of gene transfer between parasitic angiosperms and their hosts [3,32,33]. Direct plantto-plant transfer was estimated to be responsible for 26
HTs of plant mitochondrial genes to Amborella [3]. Even if
no case of direct plant-to-plant HTs has been reported yet
for TEs, this process is likely to occur for any DNA
sequence (either genes or TEs). In our case, no rice parasitic plants are known but we cannot exclude the possibility that such plants existed in the past and could have been
at the origin of HTs.

An alternative hypothesis is transfer by hybridization and
introgression. This hypothesis remains attractive since
interspecific hybridization is a common process in plants,
presumed to be at the origin of most allopolyploidization
events. Many examples of introgressions have been
described and are considered to be responsible for
organellar gene transfers in plants [34]. However, this
mechanism is only possible if the species are close enough
to hybridize spontaneously, which is not the case for the
Ehrhartoideae (rice) and Panicoideae.
Vector mediated transfers constitutes a third possible
mechanism. This could explain HTs between distant species and many studies suggest that bacteria [35] or fungi
[6] could be responsible for HTs. Only one example

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/58

clearly demonstrated the transfer from a reptile to a virus,
which constitutes a first step to a vector-mediated transfer
[36]. One could suppose that the integration of a retroelement into a viral genome (or other vectors such as insects)
could occur in the same way in plants. This could explain
why, if several organisms share common parasites, some
retrotransposons could be involved in multiple HTs. This
still needs to be tested by further experiments to fully
understand the mechanisms involved in HTs.

tion rate, chromosome breakage or sterility in Drosophila
melanogaster when crossing females lacking P-element and
males harbouring more than 30 copies of this element
[49,50]. Moreover, HTs often involve active elements (as
for the P-element, RIRE1 or Route66) which could make
them responsible for modification in both genome structure and gene expression. We therefore believe that HT of
TEs could have an important impact on genome evolution.

Transpositional activity of Route66 and potential impact
on genome evolution
The two Route66 copies of O. sativa ssp. japonica are 99.4%
identical. This indicates that Route66 has been active
recently, i.e. during the last 230,000 years. In plants, few
LTR retrotransposons are known to be still active. These
are for example Tos17 in rice [37], Tnt1 in tobacco [38] or
BARE1 in barley [39], whereas most TEs are silenced either
by the methylation and/or the small RNA pathways
[40,41]. As an example, the CAC1 element is transpositionaly activated when present in a ddm1 hypomethylation background in Arabidopsis [42]. Hirochika et al. have
also demonstrated that Tto1, a tobacco TE, can transpose
in a heterologous systems such as rice or Arabidopsis thaliana even if the copy number is positively correlated with
DNA methylation, leading to rapid silencing of the element [43]. One could therefore propose that by invading
a new genome a transferred element could escape epigenetic silencing and be active after its transfer. This could
explain why 3,000 and 300 copies of the horizontally
transferred copy of RIRE1 are now present in the O.
minuta and O. granulata genomes respectively [9]. The
activation process could favor the retention of the transferred copy in the new genome by decreasing the probability of its elimination by genetic drift [44] and could
explain why several cases of TE-HTs have been described.
In our case, Route66 has not undergone any burst of transposition because it is only present in two copies in the rice
genome. However the transpositional activity of the transferred copies of Route66 possibly explains how it could
have spread in several taxa of the grass family. More generally, the transpositional activity of transposable elements after their HTs could explain their evolutive success
in eukaryotes lineages since it allows retrotransposons to
persist after invasion of a new genome [45].

TEs are highly dynamic sequences known to mutate rapidly. It is also commonly admitted that they can massively
increase genome size through bursts of transpositional
activity, as in the case of the wild rice species O. australiensis where three LTR-retrotransposons comprise 60% of the
genome [11]. It is also well established that transposable
elements are rapidly deleted from the genome [24,51].
These observations led some authors to propose the
increase/decrease model for plant genome evolution [52]
which postulates that bursts of transposition are rapidly
counterbalanced by deletion. Based on the high rate of
HTs involving mariner-like elements (MLES), it was further
proposed that MLES could maintain themselves by horizontal transmission and thus counterbalance their elimination by stochastic loss and mutation [45,53]. Given the
accumulation of the recent demonstrations of TE HTs, we
propose to generalize this model of evolution to all classes
of transposable elements. Horizontally transferred TEs
can escape silencing and therefore transpose before they
are deleted, increasing their chances of survival in their
new host genome. HTs therefore allow TEs to colonize
and invade new genomes by bursts of transposition as has
been shown for RIRE1 in wild rice [9] or for the P-element
in Drosophila melanogaster [7,15]. We propose that HTs
may be a frequent process in the life cycle and evolution
of TEs and that this phenomenon explains their persistence in the genomes of almost all eukaryotic genomes.

Conclusion
There is no doubt that TE HTs could play a role in genome
and thus in species evolution by generating variability
[46], since TEs are known to have an impact on genes
[27,47] and on genome dynamics [11,24,48]. In addition,
there is some evidence that horizontally transferred TEs
could lead to structural and functional modifications in
the recipient species. As an example, the P-element is
responsible for genetic abnormalities such as high muta-

Methods
In silico analysis and identification of new candidate
We retrieved all rice retrotransposon sequences from the
RetrOryza database (http://www.retroryza.org/[54]).
These were used in a Blastn search against available maize
and Sorghum sequences. Conserved Route66 genomic copies of rice, maize and Sorghum were aligned using CLUSTALX [55] and modified by hand using SEAVIEW software
[56]. The final alignment was used to construct trees using
neighbour-joining methods with PAUP software [57].
10,000 bootstrap replicates were performed.
Route66 structural annotation
Annotation was performed using the Artemis software
[58]. ORFs longer than 100 residues were automatically
extracted from the element sequences. They were then
scanned using a combination of Pfam, ProSite and Blastp

analyses with standard parameters. The results were
imported into Artemis in order to reconstruct the complete structure of each element. The LTRs were identified
using Dotter [59] and the PBS and PPT were manually
determined.
Ka/Ks analysis and estimation of gene selective constraints
Both insertions of Route66 were mapped in silico on the
genome of O. sativa (IRGSP pseudomolecules build 4)
using RAPDB Blast http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/. We
retrieved each cDNA sequence with a flanking region
spanning 1 Mb for each insertion (chromosomes 2 and
6). We found 78 and 115 cDNAs for chromosomes 2 and
6 respectively. These sequences were subsequently used as
queries against the available sequences from the Sorghum
bicolor genome. For the most significant Blastn hits, we
used the phytozome web site http://www.phytozome.net/
sorghum to retrieve sequences corresponding to S. bicolor
mRNA. These mRNA sequences were then used for a
Blastn search against the NCBI database in order to
retrieve orthologous sequences from maize. Finally,
maize sequences were used as queries against the NCBI
database to check that they correspond to the initial rice
transcript flanking the Route66 insertion. We selected 2
genes for each region (AK072088 and AB055156 for chromosome 2 and AK072921 and AK070134.1 for chromosome 6) with orthologous sequences in rice, Sorghum and
maize. These sequences were aligned using the method
described above. Sequence identities and non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) were calculated using DNAsp software [60]. The same analyses
were carried out for three genes: Waxy (granule bound
starch synthase), Nod26-like (membrane protein) and
Gid1 (Gibberellin receptor) which are not located in the
flanking regions of Route66 but are known to be functional in the three species. Inter-specific sequence identities of coding region were thus computed for these seven
selected genes.

We performed the same analysis with all putatively functional Route66 copies (with no stop codon in the coding
region) of rice, maize and Sorghum, except that sequence
identities were computed on the entire sequence of
Route66 (4,890 pb) including both LTR and coding
regions (Figure 2). The observed divergence was translated
into an insertion date using a substitution rate of 1,3 × 108 mutation/site/year [18].
Amplification, cloning and phenetic analysis
Total DNA was extracted from 12 rice species provided by
the International Rice Research Institute, Manila, Philippines: Oryza. sativa, O. rufipogon (10591), O. longistaminata (acc.110 404), O. punctata (acc.105 690), O.
officinalis (acc.101 116), O. minuta (acc. 105 089), O. alta
(acc.105 143), O. australiensis (acc. 100 882), O. granulata

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/58

(102 118), O brachyantha (acc. 101 232), O. ridleyi
(100821) and O. coarctata (acc. 104 502). DNA from Panicum milliaceum and from two bamboo species, Phyllostachis bissetii and Phyllostachis aurea, was also extracted. DNA
from Saccharum spontaneum, Saccharum officinarum and
Saccharum robustum and from Sorghum bicolor, Sorghum
aethiopicum, Sorghum arundinaceum, Sorghum drummondii,
Sorghum propinquum and Sorghum virgatum were provided
by the Center for International Co-operation in Agronomic Research for Development (CIRAD, Montpellier,
France). DNA of Zea mays ssp mays (maize), ssp parviglumis
and ssp mexicana (teosinte) was provided by the station de
génétique végétale (Le Moulon, Gif-sur-Yvette, France).
DNA of Triticum durum, Triticum monococum and Aegilops
taushii was provided by the ENSAM (Montpellier, France).
DNA from Brachypodium distachyon was provided by the
Faculty of Engineering and Natural Science Sabanci University Orhanli (Tuzla-Istanbul, Turkey) and DNA of
wheat was provided by the INRA (Montpellier, France).
We used previous genomic sequence alignment of
Route66 to design primers for its PCR amplification (Forward primer: 5'ACGCCGGAGTAGACCTCGTT3', Reverse
primer: 5'ATATGCCATCTGTGGATATCC3'). The amplification products were cloned in pGEM-T easy vector
(Promega, http://www.promega.com/). Sequences were
obtained from both 5' and 3' ends to give a contig of
around 1 kb. Only one representative sequence was kept
per species and these were aligned with the corresponding
regions of maize, rice and Sorghum genomic copies. Alignment and tree construction were performed as described
above. Inter-species sequence identities were then calculated.
Adh1 sequencing
In order to eliminate the possibility of DNA contamination, we amplified and sequenced Adh1 genes from O.
sativa, O. rufipogon, O. longistaminata, O. ridleyi, in the
three sugarcane species and in Sorghum bicolor. We used
the primers designed by Ge et al. [61] to amplify the gene.
For all the data obtained, we exclude that these results
could be due to DNA contamination since we sequenced
Adh1 gene for all the accessions we used in this study and
confirmed that they correspond to the given species
