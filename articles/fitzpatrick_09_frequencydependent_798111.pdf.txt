Abstract
Background: Co-occurrence of distinct colour forms is a classic paradox in evolutionary ecology
because both selection and drift tend to remove variation from populations. Apostatic selection,
the primary hypothesis for maintenance of colour polymorphism in cryptic animals, proposes that
visual predators focus on common forms of prey, resulting in higher survival of rare forms.
Empirical tests of this frequency-dependent foraging hypothesis are rare, and the link between
predator behaviour and maintenance of variation in prey has been difficult to confirm. Here, we
show that predatory birds can act as agents of frequency-dependent selection on terrestrial
salamanders. Polymorphism for presence/absence of a dorsal stripe is widespread in many
salamander species and its maintenance is a long-standing mystery.
Results: We used realistic food-bearing model salamanders to test whether selection by wild birds
maintains a stripe/no-stripe polymorphism. In experimental manipulations, whichever form was
most common was most likely to be attacked by ground-foraging birds, resulting in a survival
advantage for the rare form.
Conclusion: This experiment demonstrates that frequency-dependent foraging by wild birds can
maintain colour polymorphism in cryptic prey.

Background
Maintenance of variation is a classic paradox in evolution
because both selection and drift tend to remove variation
from populations [1-3]. If one form has an advantage
(e.g., being more cryptic), it should replace all others.
Likewise, random drift alone will eventually result in loss
of all but one form when there are no fitness differences.
Maintenance of a stable polymorphism requires either
recurrent mutation, a balance between dispersal and
divergent selection between populations, or some form of
balancing selection within populations [3]. For example,
predators are expected to form a search image for the most

common form if it is easier to search for one cryptic prey
type than to simultaneously look for two [4-6]. If predators switch their search images to whichever prey is most
common, the result is frequency-dependent selection
against common prey [4-7]. Empirical tests of this frequency-dependent selection hypothesis are rare, and the
link between predator behaviour and maintenance of variation in prey has been difficult to confirm [4,8]. Here, we
test whether predatory birds can act as agents of frequency-dependent selection on terrestrial salamanders
using a manipulative field experiment.

Multiple species of small, forest floor-dwelling salamanders exhibit polymorphism for the presence of a dorsal
stripe (Fig. 1) and what maintains this polymorphism
within populations is a long-standing question [9-15].
Polymorphism is widespread both geographically and
phylogenetically, occurring in many species of Plethodon
throughout North America in addition to the distantly
related Batrachoseps of the Pacific coast of North America
[16] and Karsenia of Asia [17]. Thus, it is unlikely that this
polymorphism is merely a transitional stage in the evolution of colour pattern. Presence or absence of a dorsal
stripe appears to have a simple genetic basis in Plethodon
cinereus and is not related to sex [12,18].
What polymorphic salamander species seem to have in
common is that they are small, slender, and locally abundant. These species often comprise a substantial fraction
of the animal biomass in temperate forests and are subject
to predation by ground-foraging birds and other predators that search the leaf-litter for small animals [16]. Studies of polymorphic Plethodon cinereus have shown
differences between the morphs in behaviour
[11,14,15,19], physiology [11,13], and geographic variation in relative abundance [10,20]. However, none
directly address how these differences might relate to a
mechanism maintaining variation and there is no evidence of similar phenotypic correlations in the other polymorphic species. In fact, in P. ventralis, the frequency of
the striped form is less at higher elevations [21] whereas
the frequency of striped P. cinereus is greater at higher latitude and cooler microclimates in general [10,20]. Thus,
phenotypic correlations between appearance and physiology are not consistent (also see [13]) and this is not surprising given that dorsal colour pattern is unlikely to have
a direct function in temperature tolerance or metabolism
(Plethodon always avoid sunlight).
To explain the maintenance of a similar visual polymorphism across many taxa, we propose that selection acts
directly on appearance. The most likely function of dorsal
colour pattern is crypsis (Fig. 1), though this is an
untested assumption. Though there has been speculation
that the red stripe of P. cinereus might be an aposematic
signal [19], Brodie and Brodie [22] showed that wild birds
prey extensively upon striped P. cinereus, and give no sign
that the salamanders are unpalatable. Striped P. cinereus
were taken just as often as D. ochrophaeus, which were
assumed to be cryptic and palatable [22]. A third, completely red form of P. cinereus does appear to be a colour
mimic of the toxic Red-spotted Newt eft (Notophthalmus
viridescens), but our focus is on the more widespread
stripe/no-stripe polymorphism. Polymorphism in cryptic

prey populations might be maintained in migration-selection balance if alternative colour forms are adapted to different habitats [23], or might be promoted by frequencydependent predation causing rare form advantage within
populations [4,8].
Empirical tests of frequency-dependent foraging on cryptic prey are rare; the best-studied examples involve either
colored pellets of dough fed to free-ranging birds
[7,24,25]or digital images of moths selected by trained
Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata) [4,26-28]. These studies
demonstrate that birds can generate frequency-dependent
selection, that individual Blue Jays learn to focus on abundant prey, and that they readily switch focus in response
to changes in prey abundance. Apostatic selection by freeranging wild birds has been shown for small pastries differing in colour [7,25,29], and presence or absence of a
stripe [30,31], and also for real Cepaea snail shells differing in banding pattern [32]. However, in other studies,
selection changed from negative frequency-dependence
(rare form advantage) to positive frequency-dependence
(common form advantage) when artificial prey were provided at high densities, showing that rare form advantage
is not entirely general and may depend on abundance or
aggregation of prey [25,33]. A recent study of Trinidadian
guppies implicated frequency-dependent survival in the
maintenance of variation in conspicuously colored males
[34]. However, it is not clear whether search images are
important for predators of conspicuous prey, and other
factors might affect polymorphism in sexually-selected
traits [35,36]. Thus, whether frequency-dependent foraging can explain the maintenance of polymorphism in realistic prey at realistic densities remains a critical question
that might need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
Here, we show empirically that predatory birds can act as
agents of frequency-dependent selection on terrestrial salamanders.
To test for frequency-dependent selection by birds, we
used standardized models resembling polymorphic
Plethodon salamanders (Fig. 2). A food reward (1/2 peanut) was glued to the underside of each model, and models were set out at random in 10 × 10 m plot at the edge of
a woodlot in Knox county, Tennessee (see Methods). We
manipulated the relative abundance of striped and
unstriped prey and quantified survival by counting the
number of models with peanuts still attached at the end
of each day.

Results and Discussion
We observed at least five individual Blue Jays (Cyanocitta
cristata) foraging on model salamanders. Other birds
observed foraging on the ground in the study site included
Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), American

Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), American Robins (Turdus
migratorius), and Eastern Towhees (Pipilio erythrophthalmus). Only Blue Jays were observed taking peanuts from
salamanders.
On the first test day, after unstriped models had been
more abundant (9:1 for six days), more unstriped than
striped model salamanders were attacked (day 7: 16/25
vs. 6/25, Fisher's exact P = 0.0096). After six days with 5
unstriped and 45 striped models, fewer unstriped models
were attacked when tested at equal abundance (day 14:
11/25 vs. 19/25, Fisher's exact P = 0.0421). Whichever
form had been rare (1:9) over the past six days had a significant survival advantage over the common form when
presented at equal abundance (Table 1).

Fig. 3 shows that striped models had higher relative fitness
when at low frequency and lower relative fitness when at
high frequency. Multiple logistic regression supported a
significant relationship between frequency and survival
on non-test days (likelihood ratio G2 = 6.37, df = 1, P =
0.0116). There was also a strong effect of "day" (G2 =
58.27, df = 12, P < 0.0001), which probably reflects variation in predator activity (predation was lighter on rainy
days) and a delay in learning. There was no detectable
association between survival and morph (likelihood ratio
G2 = 0.225, df = 1, P = 0.635). Whichever form was rare
had a survival advantage within one or two days after the
relative abundances were reversed (Fig. 3). Thus, when
wild birds were "trained" to expect one form to be most
common, they preyed disproportionately on that form.
This occurred regardless of which form was common.

Selection by birds can be heterogeneous and these results
should be tested at other sites. However, decades of
research have consistently found that captive and freeranging wild birds cause frequency-dependent selection
on all manner of food items differing in appearance
[4,6,7,25,26,28]. We show that this very general process
can operate on the kind of phenotypic polymorphism
seen commonly in small salamanders.
We have not tested the perceptual and behavioural mechanisms underlying frequency-dependent foraging, therefore we have avoided invoking search image formation as
the specific ultimate cause of rare form advantage. Nevertheless, this study joins a growing body of literature showing that birds often switch foraging behaviour in response
to the relative abundance of alternative cryptic prey and
this can promote the maintenance of colour polymorphism [4,8]. The cognitive processes underlying this phenomenon are important subjects for further research.
In addition, a crucial question for the maintenance of polymorphism is to what extent frequency-dependent foraging by visual predators is counteracted by other selective
processes, including non-visual predation. Other sources
of mortality and other phenotypic differences between
morphs might interfere with or enhance the stable coexistence of distinct colour morphs. The conceptual link
between promoting polymorphism and promoting coexistence of similar species [37] merits greater attention.

Conclusion
Rare form advantage owing to frequency-dependent selection by visual predators has been proposed to explain
maintenance of polymorphism in many cryptic species
[4]. The experiment reported here provides evidence that
the key mechanism (frequency-dependent foraging) operates with realistic prey at realistic densities in the wild. The
maintenance of colour variation in terrestrial salamanders
might be explained by the oldest and most obvious
hypothesis – rare form advantage arises because predators
tend to overlook rare prey.

Model salamanders were constructed with modelling clay
(Sculpey™). One model was sculpted by hand and used to
create a flexible mould. This mould was then used to
make models of consistent size and body position. Models were either grey-brown or grey-brown with an ochre
stripe from the base of the head to the base of the tail (Fig.
2a). A food reward was associated with each model salamander by adhering one peanut half to the bottom of the
model using edible library paste (40 g corn starch, 1 L
water, boiled and cooled).

The field site was an open area adjacent to a woodlot in
Knox County, TN. Polymorphic P. ventralis are known
from within 2 km. To avoid spurious loss of models, we
used as foraging units 100 black plastic trays (0.185 m2)
placed in a 10 × 10 array and filled with partially decomposed leaf-litter (natural forest floor substrate). One m of
open lawn was left between adjacent trays. Each day, we
used a random number generator to assign model salamanders to 50 trays. The ordering of striped and unstriped
models was also random; as a result, each tray position
had a 50% chance of having a model salamander each day
and the probability that the model was striped was the frequency of striped models for that day. The resulting density of 1/2 m-2 was realistic for small Plethodon and
Batrachoseps salamanders [16]. Models were placed haphazardly within the trays and arranged so that the
attached peanut could not be seen without moving the
model. This design ensured that foraging birds had the
opportunity to learn where to look for salamanders and
that all "surviving" salamanders would be recovered at the
end of each day. In addition, it was important to make
sure that each tray was not guaranteed to provide a salamander, so that sometimes giving up and moving to
another was the right foraging decision [27].

models, and SB and UB are the numbers before selection.
This estimates the ratio of the survival probability of
striped relative to unstriped models [38]. For example,
when the two forms have equal fitness, wS = 1.0 and when
a striped individual is twice as likely to survive as an
unstriped individual, wS = 2.0.

The experiment was divided into two training periods of
six days each and two test days, similar to protocols used
with green and brown pastry pellets[7,25]. First, 5 striped
and 45 unstriped salamander models were presented each
day from 8:00 am until 7:30 pm (it usually took this entire
time for the birds to attack roughly half of the salamander
models). At the end of the day, the flats were gathered and
the number of "surviving" salamanders counted (those
with the peanut still attached). Six days of training were
followed immediately by a test day in which 25 of each
morph were presented. After the first test day, another sixday training period was started, this time with frequencies
of 45 striped and 5 unstriped salamander models. The second test day (25 of each morph) immediately followed
the second training period (Table 1).

We used 2 × 2 contingency tables to test the null hypothesis of equal predation rates for striped and unstriped
models on the two test days. For the 12 "training" days, we
tested for an effect of relative abundance on survival using
logistic regression with individual survival as the response
variable, day as a random effect, and morph and frequency category as fixed effects. The goodness-of-fit of the
model was adequate (likelihood ratio test relative to a saturated model: G2 = 4.03, df = 11, P = 0.708) and adding
interaction terms did not significantly improve the fit. For
all 14 days of the experiment, we estimated fitness (survival value) of striped relative to unstriped models as wS =
[(SA + 0.5)/(SB + 0.5)] ÷ [(UA + 0.5)/(UB + 0.5)], where SA
and UA are the numbers of surviving striped and unstriped
