Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the infectious
agent of AIDS, is believed to have originated in nonhuman primates in sub Saharan Africa. The first case of
HIV infection as well as first case of AIDS was reported in
India 1986. Presently HIV infections were identified in
104 districts spread all over India including forest areas.
The first case of HIV infection as well as first case of AIDS
was reported in India 1986. Data from sentinel surveillance and national family health survey III in year 2005-6
revealed that 2-3.1 million people were living with HIV/
AIDS in India in year 2006. Presently HIV infections were
identified in 104 districts spread all over India including
forest areas. Medical, archaeological, mythological, biological evidences point out the possibility of origin of
AIDS in Indian sub continent. The man and monkey association started in India by Paleolithic period. We can find
monkey paintings in various historic sites in Hindu, Buddhist literature. Monkey Gods are very common all over
India, tribal and rural people built monkey god temples
and preached. Many sculptures from 300 BC to 12th century AD depicted the monkey-man association. It is also
depicted that the monkeys are giving medicine to the king
that strengthens monkey-man association from many
thousand years. In ancient Indian medicine, like Charaka
Samhita (300 BC) AZOKSHYAM (degradation of immunity) an AIDS like disease was narrated. Many of the
archaeological sites of period between 3000 BC to 1000 in
India were displaced due to various viral diseases. Archaeological reports reveal that massive deaths occurred in
those areas. In Indian culture there has been a long tradition of keeping the non human primates as pets (or) performance animals, animal markets and zoos. Indian

primates are primarily captured (or) produced for various
reasons i.e. biomedical research, pets, private collection,
folklore medicine and food. Monkeys are sold in weekly
markets India Many parts of India monkey skulls are used
for witchcraft and black magic, skin used for drum making. In folklore and tribal medicine, patients are made to
drink live monkey blood (Chakmas and Riangs tribes)
and cat brain, for curing Asthma, fever, body ache, and
abnormal blood pressure and some times for gallstones.
The consumption of primate meat by certain tribal and
non tribal communities is still prevalent in north east and
eastern India. The use of meat from hunted primates as a
bait to agricultural pests is also common in the north eastern states. Portuguese and other colonial traders transported monkeys for folklore medicines. A few of these
Indian monkeys were found to be serologically and virologically positive to simian retroviruses. Assamese
Macaque (Macaca assamensis) harboured SFV (simian
foamy virus) and HMS 50, pigtailed macaque (Macaque
nemestrins) SFV-Hem-2 strain and Rhesus macaque
(Macaca mulatta) SMV-BGH-4. Natural infection by simian retrovirus (SRV-6) in hanuman languor(Semnopithecus entellus) traced in two different geographical
regions of India. Natural infection by simian retrovirus
(SRV-6) in hanuman languor (Semnopithecus entellus)
traced in two different geographical regions of India.
Analysis of HIV-1 subtype C and HIV 2 genome sequences
from India showed that these sequences were closely
related to each other and phylogentic analysis of these
sequences clustered together and showed monophyletic
lineage. Origin of AIDS in Indian peninsular should be
investigated for SIV s in wild monkeys of India.
