Potential pitfalls of modelling ribosomal RNA
data in phylogenetic tree reconstruction:
Evidence from case studies in the Metazoa

Abstract
Background: Failure to account for covariation patterns in helical regions of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes has the
potential to misdirect the estimation of the phylogenetic signal of the data. Furthermore, the extremes of length
variation among taxa, combined with regional substitution rate variation can mislead the alignment of rRNA
sequences and thus distort subsequent tree reconstructions. However, recent developments in phylogenetic
methodology now allow a comprehensive integration of secondary structures in alignment and tree reconstruction
analyses based on rRNA sequences, which has been shown to correct some of these problems. Here, we explore
the potentials of RNA substitution models and the interactions of specific model setups with the inherent pattern
of covariation in rRNA stems and substitution rate variation among loop regions.
Results: We found an explicit impact of RNA substitution models on tree reconstruction analyses. The application
of specific RNA models in tree reconstructions is hampered by interaction between the appropriate modelling of
covarying sites in stem regions, and excessive homoplasy in some loop regions. RNA models often failed to
recover reasonable trees when single-stranded regions are excessively homoplastic, because these regions
contribute a greater proportion of the data when covarying sites are essentially downweighted. In this context, the
RNA6A model outperformed all other models, including the more parametrized RNA7 and RNA16 models.
Conclusions: Our results depict a trade-off between increased accuracy in estimation of interdependencies in
helical regions with the risk of magnifying positions lacking phylogenetic signal. We can therefore conclude that
caution is warranted when applying rRNA covariation models, and suggest that loop regions be independently
screened for phylogenetic signal, and eliminated when they are indistinguishable from random noise. In addition
to covariation and homoplasy, other factors, like non-stationarity of substitution rates and base compositional
heterogeneity, can disrupt the signal of ribosomal RNA data. All these factors dictate sophisticated estimation of
evolutionary pattern in rRNA data, just as other molecular data require similarly complicated (but different)
corrections.

Background
Progress of molecular techniques has eased the use of
genomic data for phylogenetic analyses. Nevertheless,
whole genomes are currently available for relatively few
metazoans. Molecular studies of phylogenetic relationships
within higher taxonomic groups, e.g. at the intra-ordinal
level, therefore still rely on individual genes, among which

the nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes are
the most frequently sequenced. A pattern of highly variable positions, nested within conserved, slowly substituting
sites across the alignment, yields a valuable resource for
studying phylogenetic relationships of both recent and
ancient splits [1-4]. This, combined with the ease of amplification, has lead to a widespread use of rRNA genes in
phylogenetics and furthermore uncovered several specific
properties of these genes, which should be considered,
using these sequences as phylogenetic markers. Paired
regions in rRNA sequences evolve via selectively neutral
substitutions in the form of compensatory mutations [5]

to maintain energetically stable secondary structures.
Additionally, a strong bias of nucleotide composition
between paired and unpaired areas has been observed
[5,6]. Ribosomal RNA loop and stem regions are therefore
subject to very different selectional regimes, which can
hamper the use of rRNA genes for phylogenetic purposes
[2,5,7-11]. In particular, correlated variation of nucleotides
in stem regions, has been suggested to corrupt phylogenetic analyses as these covariation patterns of paired sites
do not display independent phylogenetic signal. Ignoring
this correlation results in an overestimation of phylogenetic information of these sites, which can lead to inflated
measurements of tree robustness [12,13]. As a solution,
rRNA secondary structural information as independent set
of characters have been advocated to aid tree reconstruction by the use of specific RNA substitution models
[12,14-17]. Application of RNA substitution models in
phylogenetics is still confined to a few studies [11,18-27],
most of them emphasing improvement of the analyses. In
contrast, a recent study on hexapod phylogeny found
mixed RNA/DNA model setups leading to a higher sensitivity to systematic problems ("long-branch attraction”)
[28]. This has been suggested as a result of potential
homoplasy in loop positions. RNA models virtually downweight stem partitions, leading to an increased impact of
loops. If these loop positions are saturated and/or misaligned, this “noisy” signal might dominate the phylogenetic
signal of unsaturated stem positions and lead to inaccurate
tree reconstruction.
In the present study, we want to test this hypothesis by
comparing the performance of mixed RNA/DNA model
setups in the tree reconstruction of different ribosomal
RNA data sets with the level of relative homoplasy in
loop and stem positions. Current studies on the topic of
modelling rRNA data in tree reconstruction have utilised
simulation analyses [28,29], which can generally be seen
to be a sophisticated complement to empirical studies in
order to test hypotheses in algorithmically rooted phylogenetics. However, in Letsch et al. [28], tree reconstructions on simulated data were not able to reveal a
potential correlation between homoplasy and data modelling. Consequently, the present analyses were based on
case studies. Eight ribosomal RNA data sets were initially
compiled, using from one to three mitochondrial and/or
nuclear ribosomal RNA gene partitions, covering a broad
spectrum of phylogenetic levels (Echinodermata (18S),
Tunicata (18S), Heterobranchia (18S) Chilopoda (18S),
Hexapoda (18S + 28S), Mammalia (12S + 16S), Primates
(12S + 16S) and Anisoptera (12S + 16S + 28S)). All data
sets were aligned with the RNASALSA alignment software [30], considering rRNA secondary structures.
Ambiguously aligned positions where identified and
excluded prior to the tree reconstruction. Based on the
complete aligned data sets, we further conducted

Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree reconstructions with the
RAxML v7.2.6 software package [31-33] with (1) a standard DNA model setups and (2) 13 mixed RNA/DNA
model setups. In the latter, loop positions are covered by
a standard DNA model and stem positions are covered
by a specific RNA model. Performance of different model
setups was compared according to recent morphological
and molecular expectations of taxonomy. To test the
relative homoplasy between stem and loop regions, all
alignments were divided into unpaired (loop) and paired
(stem) positions according to a consensus secondary
structure. Both partitions were then separately tested for
homoplasy by estimating the level of substitutional
saturation. Additionally, ML analyses were conducted on
loop and stem partitions separately and the results were
compared to the trees from the combined data sets. The
analyses setup is depicted in Figure 1.

impact of homoplasy in loop regions on the behaviour
of mixed RNA/DNA models setups in the tree reconstruction, the tree reconstruction results of all 13 RNA

recent morphological and molecular understanding of
the accordant group, where we mainly focus on “benchmark clades” to check the reliability of each model
setup. Clades were defined as “benchmark clades”, if
they have repeatedly received support in previous studies, based on independent morphological and/or molecular data.

The position of Appendicularia within Tunicata

Molecular approaches to the phylogeny of Tunicata are
generally hampered by the base composition biases and
elevated substitution rates in Aplousobranchia, Appendicularia and Mogulidae (Stolidobranchia). Appendicularia
retain larval characters throughout their lifespan, which
made an understanding of their phylogeny crucial for
understanding the evolution of body plans and developmental modes in Tunicata [27]. Recent molecular studies using phylogenomic or rRNA data to target the
phylogeny of Tunicata usually recover Appendicularia as
sister group to all other tunicate groups [39-42]. However, this position is suspected to be a result of a “long

Phylogeny of echinoderm classes

Echinodermata is divided into five extant classes, the
Crinoidea (sea lilies), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), Asteroidea (starfishes), Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) and
Echinoidea (sea urchins). Monophyly in these five
classes is well founded [34], whereas the relationships
among them are still debated. Nevertheless, there is
some consensus regarding major aspects of echinoderm
phylogeny [34-36]. Crinoids are seen as the most basal
split within Echinodermata, forming the sister group to
the four remaining classes (Eleutherozoa). Furthermore,
there is strong support for a sister group relationship of
echinoids and holothurians (Echinozoa). Debates on the
phylogenetic position of the stellate forms (starfishes
and brittle stars) revolve around two competing hypotheses: are the ophiurids alone sister group to Echinozoa
[37,38] or do asteroids and ophiuroids form a clade
(Asterozoa), which is then the sister taxon to Echinozoa
[34]? The above outlined hypotheses are only reflected
by the results of the GTR and the RNA6A model setups.
These trees all show basal Crinoidea and Eleutherozoa
divided into Asterozoa and Echinozoa. In contrast, all
other mixed RNA/DNA model setups show either
Holothuroidea or a clade of Holothuroidea + Echinoidea
the sister taxon to the rest of Echinodermata (Figure 2),
thus clearly contradicting current expectations of echinoderm phylogeny.

branch attraction” artefact, due to genome-wide elevated
substitution rates in this group [27,40]. As an alternative, Appendicularia as sister to Stolidobranchia has
been recovered through analyses of 18S rRNA genes
[27,39,43,44]. However, this position was generally
weakly supported and has been discussed as a possible
result of base composition bias in Appendicularia and
Mogulidae, a family of Stolidobranchia [27]. These problems are reflected by the results of our study on tunicates (Figure 3), which either show Appendicularia as
first split within Tunicata (RNA7C, E, F and RNA16A
model setups) or as sister group to Stolidobranchia (all
other model setups). According to the currently unresolved position of Appendicularia, none of these alternatives can be chosen as superior.
Relationships within Mammalia

The first molecular analyses on the phylogeny of
Mammalia, using mitochondrial genes have remarkably
challenged previous morphological hypotheses on the
relationship among mammalian groups [45]. However,
subsequent studies on nuclear markers and more
sophisticated analyses of mitochondrial genomes led to
more consistent hypotheses of mammalian relationships,
which are in several aspects congruent to morphological

studies [45-51]. General congruence among these independent markers has resulted in a well resolved and
strongly corroborated backbone tree of mammalian
groups, representing the four “superorders” Xenarthra,
Afrotheria, Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria and several subgroups, e.g. monophyletic Theria, the Paenungulata (containing elephants, hyraxes and sirenians),
Tetytheria (elephants and sirenians), and Euarchonta
(Scandentia + Dermoptera + Primates). Consequently,
the evaluation of tree reconstructions targeting mammalian phylogeny has been formalised by defining theses
groups as “benchmark clades” [52], whose appearance is
used to evaluate the performance of the method that
was used. In the present study, most analyses are highly
congruent in their results of mammalian relationships
and display many of the proposed benchmark clades
with sufficient support. However, in the RNA6A,
RNA16 and RNA16A analyses, a clade combining
Afrotheria + Xenarthra is sistergroup to Laurasiatheria
and Rodentia appear paraphyletic to the remaining
eutherian groups, with Muroidea + Anomalurus as first
split within Eutheria. This reflects the suggestions of
several previous analyses based on mt genes, but must
been interpreted as a result of model misspecification
ignoring among-site rate variation [53,54] and compositional bias [55]. In contrast, all other analyses show
Afrotheria + Xenarthra as first split within Eutheria and
paraphyletic Rodentia, but the latter are nested within
monophyletic Laurasiatheria. It is notable, that bootstrap
support values for potentially correct groupings
increased, if mixed RNA/DNA model setups are applied
(cf. Figure 4 and Additional file 2 for complete mammalian trees).

that defines a threshold for significant saturation in the
data. The ISSc is compared with the observed ISS of the
data. If the ISS value is larger than the critical ISSc
values, saturation is assumed. To contribute to different
tree shapes, the ISSc is estimated, using a symmetrical
(balanced) and an asymmetrical (pectinate) tree topology. The test for homoplasy reveals striking differences
between paired and unpaired positions. In the stem portions of all data sets, the asymmetrical and the symmetrical ISSc is always larger than the observed ISS. The
differences are significant, thus indicating that the paired
partitions are not saturated. In contrast, we detected
potential saturation of substitution in the unpaired positions of several data sets. For Echinodermata, Hexapoda,
Tunicata, Chilopoda and Heterobranchia, the ISS of was
notably larger than the asymmetrical ISSc, suggesting
substantial saturation in these alignments. The complete
results of the saturation tests are summarised in Table 1.

substitution saturation in the loop partitions. The saturation test results of the loop and stem partitions were
additionally compared to the saturation test results of the
combined data sets of the groups exhibiting saturation in
the loop regions. As displayed in Table 2 saturation
vanishes in all of the combined data sets.
Subsequently, ML tree reconstructions were conducted on the separated loop and stem partitions, using
a DNA model setup. To characterise the phylogenetic
signal in both partitions, we checked whether the trees
from the paired or the unpaired partition were more
congruent to the combined data results. Trees resulting
from all three setups (combined, paired, unpaired) were

compared with the Robinson-Foulds [58] (RF) distance
score, which accounts for topology differences. This
indicates a closer similarity of trees based on combined
and unpaired data. Comparisons between the combined
data set, analysed under different mixed model schemes,
usually strengthen this effect. With the exception of
Chilopda and Hexapoda, most RF distances between the
combined data and the unpaired data diminished,
whereas RF distances between the combined data and
the paired data often increased (cf. Figure 6 and Additional file 3 Table S4 and S5).

function in protein biosynthesis, paired and unpaired
positions can be expected to evolve differentially and
might therefore also differ in their sensitivity to numerous substitutions occurring at the same position, thus
hiding or completely erasing phylogenetic signal. Our
results indicate separate exploratory analyses of loops
and stems as crucial, because homoplasy due to multiple
substitutions in loop positions could not be detected if
the combined data sets (loops + stems) are tested for
excessive homoplasy (Table 2). Pooling loop portions
may be subject to the same kind of underestimation of
homoplasy, if rates among loop regions are highly heterogeneous, as is apparent in Van de Peer et al. [59]. Thus, it
may be advisable to estimate homoplasy in each loop
region separately. These homoplastic substitution patterns have generally been addressed as “substitutional
saturation” [60,61]. However, “saturation” is a concept
that is only relevant to distance based analyses, where
“saturation” refers to saturation curves, in which increasing phylogenetic depth does not increase pairwise distances. Phylogenies have nodes at many levels, from the
tips to the root, and character based analyses can insulate

Page 6 of 12

homoplasy and mediate errors due to homoplastic sites
in ways that distance based analyses cannot [62,63], for
example by increasing the taxon sampling to break up
long branches [64-69]. In this context, it can further be
stated that “saturation” is not an inherent character of an
aligned sequence position in a given alignment, it rather
depends on the considered phylogenetic level. Additional
measurements of the ISS in the tunicate data set, applied
to the loop partitions of distinct monophyletic subgroups
within Tunicata, shows an ISS significantly smaller than
the ISSc for both symmetrical and asymmetrical topologies, thus indicating a decrease of homoplasy in these
groups (Table 3). The ISS method applied here accounts
for position specific nucleotide frequency pattern in a
given alignment, which are supposed to reflect the occurrence of multiple substitutions in the data set [57], thus
implying relative homoplasy. Therefore, the use of the
ISS might be a reasonable heuristic to estimate the level
of homoplasy according to the deep splits discussed in
the considered data sets.
As depicted in Figure 5, most of the RNA models only
lead to reasonable tree hypotheses, if the loop regions
are found to contain meaningful phylogenetic data. In
data sets identified as saturated, nearly all RNA models
failed to recover an expected hypothesis. In contrast, the
standard DNA model setup usually led to trees congruent with recent views on the relationships in the accordant groups. In this context, especially the results of the
hexapod data are interesting, as these analyses did not
provide superior trees by the DNA models setups,
although saturation is detected. In the case of hexapods,
no model setup led to the expected tree hypothesis.
This indicates a generally insufficient phylogenetic signal
of the 18S and 28S RNA data to resolve the shortest of
the internodes among the deep hexapod splits. However,
in [28], Bayesian inference analyses of the identical data
set led to wrong tree hypotheses in the mixed RNA/
DNA model setup, but not in the standard DNA model
setup. Kjer [11] found that topologies were virtually

identical between the standard and RNA models, but
support values varied: in some cases, expected nodes
were more strongly supported with GTR models
(Archaeognatha, Pterygota, Paraneoptera + Holometabola, and Hymenoptera) other cases favoured the doublet model (Hexapoda, lestoids sister to other Zygoptera).
Similarly, support for a paraphyletic Anisoptera (presumably incorrect) went down with the doublet model.
Nevertheless it is noteworthy, that mixed RNA/DNA
model setups frequently led to an increased support for
probably correct clades in data sets without homoplastic
loops (Mammalia and Primates), thus supporting previous studies on RNA models in phylogenetics
[14,19,23].
Our analyses setup also allows comparisons between
the different RNA model setups. Current RNA substitution models can be divided into two distinct classes,
rooted in population genetics [5,10]. Models of the first
class assume a one-step process of compensatory substitution in paired positions, thus allowing double substitutions (e.g. AU ↔ GC): a mutation in a base pair (AU ®
GU) may led to slightly deleterious UG or GU pairs. If
selection against these intermediates is strong, these are
kept in low frequency in the population. If a second
mutation occurs at the corresponding site (GU ® GC),
drift in gene frequency may lead to a domination of this
new base pairing in the population (RNA6A-D, RNA7AB, D and RNA16A). In contrast, models of the second
class assume a two-step process of compensatory substitution in paired positions, considering one substitution
in base-pairs, with a probability of zero for all double
substitutions. This approach considers a fixation of
intermediate states in the population at a high frequency, after a mutation in a base pair and before a second mutation at the corresponding site (RNA7C, F and
RNA16, B). RNA models can be further discriminated
by their treatment of mismatches: 6-state models completely ignore these pairings, 7-state models lump all
mismatches in one category, whereas 16-state models
apply distinct frequency and substitution rate parameters to the individual mismatches.
Previous studies on RNA models in phylogenetics
have predicted the superiority of models allowing double
substitutions and the superiority of the most general
models (RNA6A, RNA7A) [5,10,70]. The latter is corroborated by the AICc modeltest of the present analyses,
which frequently show higher likelihoods and AICc
values for the most general models (see Additional file 3
Table S2 and S3). Furthermore, the RNA6A model led
to the expected topologies in two data sets (Echinodermata and Chilopoda) showing relative homoplasy in
loop partitions, whereas all other RNA models fail to
display presumably correct trees, if significant homoplasy was identified (Figure 5). In this context, the

Page 7 of 12

RNA6D and RNA16B models are performing worst, as
both are only able to display one potentially correct tree
hypotheses. Additionally, congruencies between the performance of RNA models and the results of the AICc
modeltest can be drawn from our results. According to
the AICc modeltest, in the class of the RNA6 models,
the most general RNA6A model is always superior to all
other RNA6 models (see Additional file 3 Table S2 and
S3), which is further congruent to its performance in
tree reconstruction analyses. This is not reflected by the
RNA7 and RNA16 models, where the models with the
highest AICc scores (RN7A-B and RNA16 did not perform best (cf. Figure 5).
Potential pitfalls of RNA modelling

Consequences of different evolutionary constraints in
stem and loop regions of rRNA sequences for phylogenetic analyses has long been suspected and led to different recommendations for weighting stem positions in
parsimony analyses [2,7,8]. Beside suggestions for simple
one-half weighting of paired positions [7], empirical
investigation of compensatory substitution rates in stem
positions [8] reveals a rate of about 40% of that
expected under a hypothesis of perfect compensation.
Therefore, the weighting of stem characters is suggested
to be reduced by no more than 20%. Consequently, in
model based tree reconstruction methods, like Bayesian
inference and Maximum Likelihood, it should be reasonable to use specific RNA models (which can be seen
as an algorithmic equivalent to weighting stem positions
in Maximum Parsimony) as simply applying a standard
DNA model to data from one part of the helical regions.
Application of these RNA models has frequently been
justified by a consistent phylogenetic signal of coevolved
paired sites, decreasing the information content in the
data [5,18]. Analyses ignoring this interdependence
should tend to overestimate the support for dubious or
even wrong nodes in a tree [13]. Due to a reduced number of effective sites, the application of specific RNA
models, which take interdependencies into account,
reduces tree confidence, but is more reliable in the light
of the information content in the data [12,16].
Our results actually imply a reduced impact of stem
positions in the combined data set, if mixed RNA/DNA
model setup are used. This is depicted by the tree distance results of the separate analyses of the stem and
loop partitions. In most data sets, the distances between
the trees based on only the loop partition and the combined data are reduced, if RNA models are applied for
the combined data, whereas the distances between the
stem partition and the combined data are mostly
enlarged (Figure 2). This could have been expected, if
coevolution in paired sites is assumed and thus these
positions do not provide independent phylogenetic

Letsch and Kjer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/146

information. However, for several of the currently tested
data sets, the substitution saturation test reveals that the
unpaired positions clearly experience excessive homoplasy, which indicates a loss of phylogenetic information,
as these positions are no longer informative [71]. In this
context, stem positions in the current data sets should
contain more reliable signal, compared to loop regions,
as they exhibit a much lesser grade of homoplasy due to
multiple substitutions. Consequently, the application of
RNA models increases the relative impact of noisy positions in the data set and reduces the influence of more
informative portions. Thus, the results of the current
analyses corroborate the hypothesis proposed by Letsch
et al. [28].
RNA models doubtlessly provide a better depiction of
the phylogenetic information content of rRNA data sets,
but this might be a trap, if homoplasy is far greater in
loop positions. In this case, the informative phylogenetic
content is obscured by noise. The situation might probably be depicted best, if we thought of a weighting
scheme for rRNA data sets: in standard DNA model
setup, the signal of paired positions is virtually weighted
twice, as both positions are linked and signal of pairs
can be seen redundant. As outlined above, previous studies have mostly targeted this as a problem
[5,10,12,13,18,19], but the current analyses showed relative homoplasy as delimiting the confidence of the phylogenetic signal provided by loop regions, revealing a
more or less hidden coherence between two factors covariation and homoplasy - contributing to the phylogenetic signal of the rRNA data sets. For this scenario it
can be stated, that in contrast to a previously proposed
overestimation of wrong support by ignoring site interdependencies [13], the application of RNA models will
tend to overestimate the support for dubious or wrong
nodes in a tree.
As depicted above, loops and stems can be expected
to experience different selectional regimes, which has
resulted in the development of the specific RNA models.
Nevertheless, it has been noted as early as 1991 [72]
that substitution rates do not fit neatly into stem-loop
partitions, and thus weighting according to stems vs.
loops might be problematic, which was later demonstrated by Van de Peer [59]. Consequently, selectional
constraints on rRNA may not only differ between paired
and unpaired regions, but also among the individual
loop or stem regions, which would depend on the individual function and their relative location in the 3D
rRNA molecule. Binding sites of ribosomal proteins, for
example protein L11-binding domain (L11-BD) within
the LSU rRNA domain II and the sarcin-ricin loop
within domain VI, constituting the GTPase-associated
center [73] or the LSU rRNA domain V, which contains
the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) [74], are highly

Page 8 of 12

conserved throughout metazoa. Furthermore, many of
the rRNA regions of domain IV that are involved in
tRNA and inter-subunit interactions are also preserved
[74,75]. In contrast, the domain I of the mt LSU is
highly variable on sequence level and until now, no conserved secondary structures could be detected [4,73].
Consequently, the partitioning into loops and stems
must be seen as only an relative coarse approximation
to model rRNA sequences. In future phylogenetic studies on rRNA, more sophisticated partitioning schemes,
depending on the function, base composition and relative location of rRNA regions, would be able to enhance
model based tree reconstruction analyses

Conclusions
The results of the present study can be interpreted as a
trade-off between using specific RNA models for a
hopefully more accurate estimation of covariation in
paired sites and the risk of augmenting relatively homoplastic unpaired positions in the tree reconstruction. For
future phylogenetic studies based on rRNA sequences,
we would therefore highly recommend a separate test
for saturation of substitution in loop and stem partitions
of the aligned data set. The use of a mixed RNA/DNA
model setup should be avoided if saturation occurs in
the loop partitions, as otherwise the valuable phylogenetic signal of the stem partitions might be masked by
potentially noisy signal provided by the loops. In contrast, if no substantial homoplasy is detected in the data,
the use of mixed RNA/DNA models can be highly
recommend, as these lead to an increased support to
probably correct clades.
Based on the presents results, we cannot advocate an
general exclusion of the potentially noisy loop positions:
First, noise is not an inherent character of a certain
nucleotide position, but depends on the considered phylogenetic level. And second, differences among loop (or
stem) regions can be expected and excluding these
regions as a whole reduces the phylogenetic signal of
the data set. Consequently, we rather recommend to
think about enhanced partitioning strategies, which
would allow a more careful modelling of rRNA
sequences and provide a first approach to detect noisy
signal among loop (or stem) partitions.
However, covariation and substitution saturation are
only two parameters of the evolutionary inherent pattern displayed (or hidden) in the data. Other phenomena, like non-stationarity of substitution rates across
sites and branches as well as base composition heterogeneity, might also maul the signal content of the data set.
A previous study [26] based on nuclear rRNA genes,
identified deviation of base composition in certain clades
as probably misleading tree reconstruction analyses,
rather than the covariation pattern in stem regions. A

Letsch and Kjer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/146

sophisticated estimation of evolutionary pattern in rRNA
sequence data is therefore principally desirable and
newly developed methods should be applied, which are
able to consider background knowledge as covariation,
non-stationary processes or heterogeneity in the data
[26,76].

Methods
Compilation of data sets

As exemplary data sets to test the performance of we
chose Echinodermata (18S), Tunicata (18S), Heterobranchia (18S) Chilopoda (18S), Hexapoda (18S + 28S),
Mammalia (12S + 16S), Primates (12S + 16S) and Anisoptera (12S + 16S + 28S). All sequences were downloaded from NCBI Genbank (Additional file 4 provides
complete taxon tables, including Genbank accession
numbers). To apply mixed RNA/DNA models in the
tree reconstruction, we had to infer reliable individual
secondary structures. Consequently, we only considered
18S sequences with at least 1700 bp and 28S sequences
with at least 3000 bp. 12S and 16S rRNA sequences in
the primate and mammalian data sets were taken from
entire mitochondrial genomes and therefore span the
entire rRNA locus. In Anisoptera, the 12S and 16S
rRNA sequences have minimum lengths of 500 bp and
1250 bp respectively. For the combined data sets, we
only considered taxa that were represented by all genes.
Alignment procedures

Alignment was done with the RNASALSA software [30],
which aligns ribosomal RNA sequences by utilising existing hypotheses of structural patterns, in order to constrain thermodynamic folding algorithms and favour the
alignment of sites that contain compensatory substitutions. In three steps, RNASALSA accumulates structure
information, until each sequence receives its individual
secondary structure string. In the first steps, conserved
structure features are recognized via primary sequence
conservation and consistent and/or compensatory substitution, which provides a structure skeleton for the next
step, where the more variable regions gain structures by
thermodynamic folding. Finally, the combined sequence
and structure strings are simultaneously aligned, where
sequence and structure information come into account.
The program uses structural constraints as an input file,
and our constraints of nuclear and mitochondrial SSU/
LSU genes (see Supplement S1), were originally retrieved
from the European Ribosomal Database (ERDB) [77-79].
The structures of these sources are coded in the proprietary DCSE format and were recoded into the required
dot-bracket format with the program extractfromdcse of
the PHASE software package [18,80]. The ERDB homepage is offline now, but readily recoded constraint structure files (representing various metazoan groups), as well

Page 9 of 12

as tools to divide loop and stem partitions, are available
at the RNAsalsa homepage http://rnasalsa.zfmk.de. RNASALSA also requires a “pre-alignment” input file, which
was obtained from the E-INS-i algorithm of the MAFFT
alignment package [81], using default settings. The stringency settings for adoption of secondary structures in different alignment steps was relaxed (0.51), as we wanted
to retain as much structure information as possible (see
[30] for a detailed description of the RNASALSA
method). Subsequent evaluation of the alignments was
done with ALISCORE[82], which identifies ambiguously
aligned regions in multiple sequence alignments. For gap
treatment (g), window size (ws) and random pairwise
comparisons (pc), the following settings were used (g:
gaps as ambiguous characters; ws: four positions; pc:
taxa2).
Maximum Likelihood analyses

Maximum Likelihood analyses were conducted with
RAxML v7.2.6 [31-33], which is an enhanced program
for computing phylogenetic trees based on Maximum
likelihood inference that includes RNA substitution
models (RNA6A-D, RNA7A-F, RNA16, RNA16A and
RNA16B, for a detailed description of the RNA models,
please refer to the manual of the PHASE software package [80]). To define paired an unpaired partitions, the
consensus structures in dot bracket format were used,
obtained from the RNAsalsa alignments. In the standard
DNA setup, the GTR model was used with all model
parameters estimated from the data, with among site
rate variation modelled with gamma distributed rates
across sites with four discrete rate categories. Additionally, model parameters were optimised for different partitions, representing SSU and LSU rRNA sequences
respectively. In the RNA model setups, a third partition
is defined, according to the consensus secondary structure of the whole alignment and all paired position are
extracted and pooled in third partition. The consensus
structure provided by RNAsalsa Model fitting in both
single nucleotide partitions is applied as in the standard
model setup and the in paired nucleotide partition a
specific RNA model is used. Within each class of RNAmodels, the best model is evaluated by an Akaike Information criterion (AICc) test.
Test for homoplasy

Relative homoplasy was examined between loop and
stem regions. For this purpose, the aligned data sets
were divided into paired and unpaired partitions,
according to the consensus structures, provided by the
RNASALSA alignments. Subsequently, each partitions
was compared for the level of homoplasy in the data,
using the substitution saturation test of the program
package DAMBE v5.2.9 [56,57], which estimates an

Letsch and Kjer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/146

“index of substitution saturation”, based on the notion
of entropy in information theory. Prior to the saturation
test, we accounted for invariant sites, which provides a
more reasonable estimation of potential saturation in
the data sets [57].
