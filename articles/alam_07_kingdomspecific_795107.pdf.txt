Abstract
Background: Pfam is a general-purpose database of protein domain alignments and profile Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs), which is very popular for the annotation of sequence data produced by
genome sequencing projects. Pfam provides models that are often very general in terms of the taxa
that they cover and it has previously been suggested that such general models may lack some of
the specificity or selectivity that would be provided by kingdom-specific models.
Results: Here we present a general approach to create domain libraries of HMMs for sub-taxa of
a kingdom. Taking fungal species as an example, we construct a domain library of HMMs (called
Fungal Pfam or FPfam) using sequences from 30 genomes, consisting of 24 species from the
ascomycetes group and two basidiomycetes, Ustilago maydis, a fungal pathogen of maize, and the
white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. In addition, we include the Microsporidion
Encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite, and two non-fungal species, the
oomycetes Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum, both plant pathogens. We evaluate the
performance in terms of coverage against the original 30 genomes used in training FPfam and
against five more recently sequenced fungal genomes that can be considered as an independent test
set. We show that kingdom-specific models such as FPfam can find instances of both novel and well
characterized domains, increases overall coverage and detects more domains per sequence with
typically higher bitscores than Pfam for the same domain families. An evaluation of the effect of
changing E-values on the coverage shows that the performance of FPfam is consistent over the
range of E-values applied.
Conclusion: Kingdom-specific models are shown to provide improved coverage. However, as the
models become more specific, some sequences found by Pfam may be missed by the models in
FPfam and some of the families represented in the test set are not present in FPfam. Therefore, we
recommend that both general and specific libraries are used together for annotation and we find
that a significant improvement in coverage is achieved by using both Pfam and FPfam.

Background
The number of genomes being sequenced now exceeds

2000. Of these, as of February 2007, 510 are completed
while 1091, 695 and 62 bacterial, eukaryotic and archaeal

genomes (respectively) are still underway [1]. Much of
this genomic sequence is relatively poorly annotated and
one of the major challenges in bioinformatics is the computational annotation of this massive amount of data in a
high-throughput manner [2]. Genome annotation can be
classified into three levels: the nucleotide, protein and
process levels [3]. Databases such as PROSITE [4], PRINTS
[5], SMART [6], TIGRFAMs [7] or Pfam [8], which keep
information in the form of motifs, alignment blocks, or
profiles, provide a reference for the annotation at the protein level [9] where the main aim is to identify conserved
regions and domains within the protein sequences predicted at the nucleotide annotation stage. InterPro [10]
provides an integrated resource to cross-reference these
motif or domain databases.
The Pfam database, in particular, has a wealth of information about approximately 8000 domains and plays a
major role in achieving such high-throughput annotation
of newly sequenced genomes, due to its specialized profile
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [11,12]. TIGRFAMs is
another similar database of protein families based on
HMMs designed to specifically support large sequencing
projects, although this has less coverage with under 2500
models in release 4.1, and is focused more towards complete proteins than domains. Profile HMMs are flexible,
probabilistic models that can be used to describe the consensus patterns shared by sets of homologous protein/
domain sequences. They summarise the shared statistical
features of these homologous sequences in a way that
allows efficient searching for matches in translated DNA
sequences corresponding to predicted protein-coding
genes. HMMs in the Pfam database are constructed from
an alignment of a representative set of sequences for each
protein domain, called a seed alignment. The seed alignments are tested and improved by manual curation, and
by application to large databases like the Universal Protein (UniProt) database [13]. A key issue, though, is the
trade-off between sensitivity and specificity of the representative seeds and the corresponding models. If the seeds
get larger and increasingly general, then they may lose specificity.
It has previously been reported that more specific HMMs,
built from sequences obtained from a less diverged set of
species, can lead to improved sensitivity and specificity in
the detection of domains and will therefore provide
improved coverage when annotating proteins in related
species [14]. The HMM library TLFAM-Pro has been developed for use with prokaryotes and some results of using
the method have been described [15]. About 3000 ClustalW alignments from NCBI's database of Clusters of
Orthologous Groups (COGs) [16], as of 2001, were used
to compile HMMs. It was found that, although TLFAMPro demonstrated higher scores and longer alignments, a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/97

search of the test dataset against Pfam yielded more total
hits, suggesting that TLFAM-Pro may provide a useful
complementary resource to Pfam. This preliminary study
was carried out in 2002, when both the number of
domains in Pfam and the number of available genomes
was much smaller than now and therefore it is unclear
whether these results remain valid. It was also reported
that archaeal- and fungal- specific TLFAM databases had
been constructed, or were to be constructed in the near
future, but we are not aware of any publications describing them and no implementation is currently available. In
other restricted applications, it has been shown that kingdom-specific HMMs improve performance -, as shown for
example, in the prediction of N-terminal myristoylation
sites in plants [17]. However, as far as we are aware no
large-scale study of the effectiveness of kingdom-specific
HMMs for protein domain searching has been carried out.
Given the rapidly increasing availability of un-annotated
or partially annotated genomes across all kingdoms, it is
important to determine whether more specific HMMs are
useful for the annotation of these genomes. In this paper,
we test this hypothesis specifically, taking the case of fungal genomes as an example.
A large number of complete and partial genome
sequences have recently become publicly available for
fungal species. We are involved in the development of the
e-Fungi data warehouse, which provides tools for the
comparative analysis of these genomes and associated
functional data [18]. As part of this project we are developing a pipeline for the automated annotation of new
genomes as they become available. We are therefore interested in developing methods for identifying protein
domains and it is important to obtain the best coverage
possible. In this paper we describe a fungal-specific HMM
library that was developed to carry out this task. This
serves as an example of a kingdom-specific HMM library,
and we evaluate its performance in comparison to the
more general Pfam database [19]. We compile the fungalspecific HMMs using genomic data from the 30 species
represented in the current version of the e-Fungi data
warehouse [18]. We evaluate the increase in coverage provided by the fungal-specific models over those 30 species.
In order to test the method on previously unseen data, we
then evaluate its performance on five more recently
sequenced genomes that were not included in the first
release of the e-Fungi database used to construct the models. Our results demonstrate that a fungal-specific library
does provide a significant increase in coverage and that
best performance is achieved by combining results from
the kingdom-specific HMM library with results from the
standard Pfam library. We investigate how this improved
coverage affects the distribution of identified multidomain proteins and we investigate the functional anno-

tation of families that show the largest difference in performance between the two libraries.

be obtained in the annotation of novel genomes by applying both general and species-specific domain libraries.

Results and discussion

Examples of domain instances missed by Pfam
The frequency or the number of domain instances recovered using Pfam and FPfam can be divided into two categories; category A, where both models identify domains
and category B, where only one of the two models produce
hits. Category A represents cases where both the libraries
are broadly effective, while category B defines the libraries
that are most effective in identifying additional domain
instances. For clarity, the category B hits can further be
divided into category Bf (FPfam alone) and category Bp
(Pfam alone) hits. The number of domains and domain
instances for category A, category Bf and category Bp in the
training set of 30 and test set of five genomes are shown
in Table 2 and Table 3. By looking at category Bf and category Bp, in addition to category A hits, this shows clearly
that the performance of FPfam is much better than Pfam,
detecting both a higher number of domains and domain
instances. This improved performance of the FPfam
library is consistent across both the training and test set of
genomes.

Comparison of FPfam and Pfam results for sequences from
30 fungal genomes
For each of the original 30 genomes (see Table 1) we calculated the percentage of sequences containing at least
one domain using the two HMM libraries (see Figure 1).
In this figure we only show result for the 2953 domains
represented in this version of FPfam, since we are interested in comparing the sensitivity of the fungal-specific
models compared to the general models for the same
domains in Pfam. We found matches against these 2953
domains, with 56.55% average coverage of sequences in
genomes by using Pfam, 64.29% by using FPfam, and
65.60% by combining them. Using FPfam, 15 genomes
showed coverage of more than 70% of their sequences,
while the other genomes had 46.99–69.89% of sequences
covered. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii,Saccharomyces castelli, Candida glabrata, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Eremothecium gossypii, Kluyveromyces waltii and
Schizosaccharomyces pombe achieved the highest coverage
of above 75% of sequences. Coverage of sequences with
domains using Pfam models is 2–13% lower than the coverage using FPfam models at the same E-value threshold.
The combination of FPfam and Pfam improved the overall average coverage further. In addition to 151854
sequences commonly detected across all genomes, 24878
sequences were picked up using FPfam that were missed
by Pfam, while only 3603 found with Pfam were missed
by FPfam (for further details, see section on domain
instances missed by Pfam below). These sequences could
be added to the FPfam HMM seed alignments in order to
improve coverage, but (in practice) both FPfam and Pfam
will be used for annotation and it is therefore not necessary for FPfam to reproduce all Pfam hits.
FPfam and Pfam results comparison for the test set of five
fungal species
We have shown that the fungal-specific HMM library provides improved coverage over sequences within the original 30 genomes that were used to construct the library.
Principally, however, we are interested in whether FPfam
will be useful for searching new genomes that contain
sequences not used to construct the library. A comparison
of FPfam and Pfam results on the five new fungal
genomes is shown in Figure 2. An average coverage of
60.10% and 61.53% was obtained using Pfam and FPfam,
respectively; while combining the methods gives an
improved coverage of 64.58%.

In addition to these results, Pfam also picked up some
more domains that are not yet included in the FPfam
libraries. This suggests that a further improvement could

Going further, we considered the LICD family of proteins
[PF04991] which are involved in phosphorylcholine
metabolism [20]. From the Pfam database, available
online [21], there are currently no hits for this family of
proteins in fungal species. However, in this study, the
original Pfam models and the FPfam models picked up 16
instances of category A hits. Furthermore, there are 53
instances of category B hits, where 51 were picked up by
FPfam alone (category Bf hits) and 2 by Pfam alone (category Bp hits). Further examples of novel domains from the
top category B hits, where there was no fungal hit previously known in the Pfam database, include the LamininB [PF00052] and Fascin [PF06268] domains. Interestingly, it has previously been reported that standard PFam
HMMs are poor at distinguishing laminin domains compared to PANTHER [22]. Here, we note that the speciesspecific FPfam HMMs can indeed detect these domains
with good sensitivity in fungal species. Another interesting example is Ribosomal_S6 [PF01250], a common and
fundamental domain, currently assigned to 22 eukaryotic
species by Pfam, only one of which is fungal. Here, FPfam
is able to recover 26 Bf instances alone, no Bp hits were
observed, while 13 Category A hits were found. This
shows that the method is able to recover novel hits from
both well-studied and rare domains, offering a similar
sensitivity to alternative HMM building approaches [22]
and extending the depth of annotation above that of the
standard Pfam approach. More examples are shown in
Table 4, where the top 20 domain families are sorted
based on the fraction of category Bf hits compared to the
Bp and category A hits. There are about 1400 domain fam-

Figure 1
Comparison of FPfam and Pfam results for sequences from the original 30 fungal genomes
Comparison of FPfam and Pfam results for sequences from the original 30 fungal genomes. For each of the 30
original genomes, the Figure shows the percentage of sequences found to contain at least one domain using Pfam, FPfam and a
combination. The average coverage was found to be 56.55% (Pfam), 64.29% (Fpfam) and 65.60% (combination). These matches
were found against 2953 domains represented in the FPfam library. Please note that genome names are shown as a four letter
code; comprising of the first letter from the genus name and 3 letters from the species name, also shown in the Table 1.

ilies where the contribution of category Bf hits is at least
10% of the total, and this coverage goes up to at least 50%
among 79 different families. It is due to these category B
hits appearing in both columns (Bf and Bp) that a combination of FPfam and Pfam results provides better coverage
than either library by itself. The complete table for these
results is shown in Additional File 1.
Domains per sequence analysis
To look at the coverage of domains in fungal sequences in
a different way, the number of domains per sequence is
presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4, averaged over the 30
original and five new fungal genomes, respectively. FPfam
obtains less single-domain proteins and more multiple
domain proteins than Pfam. It is clear from these figures
that FPfam not only finds more proteins containing at
least one domain but also unveils more domains per
sequence.

Comparison of bit-scores from Pfam and FPfam model
searches
In all of the analyses presented in this study we used the
E-value as the only criterion to discriminate between true
and false positives. By calibrating each library in the same
way, these E-values should provide a similar false positive
rate for each library and therefore make the results for
each library comparable. However, it is also interesting to
compare the distribution of bitscores on which these Evalues are based, in order to identify any large differences
between the corresponding models from each library. The
bitscore is a normalized alignment score taking into
account the underlying HMM scoring scheme, which is
the same (in our case) for both models. To assess which of
the two libraries produce a higher bitscore, histograms
were constructed for the observed frequency of category A
cases where bitscores for Pfam are higher than FPfam and
vice versa (termed "Pfam>FPfam" and "FPfam >Pfam",
respectively) and for the frequency of category B cases
where either Pfam or FPfam results were available (termed
"Pfam-alone" and "FPfam-alone"). The bitscores were

placed in six bins of bitscore ranges. Only the maximum
score from a pair was used to assign a hit to a bin when
scores were available from both Pfam and FPfam, so each
hit is counted only once. The histogram of frequencies for
different ranges of bitscores from 30 fungal genomes is
shown in Figure 5 and for five test genomes in Figure 6.
From both Figures, it can be observed that for the higher
bitscore ranges (>50) there are a larger number of cases
where FPfam scores are greater than Pfam scores (see
Fpfam>Pfam), while in the intermediate range (0 to 50)
we see that although category A hits have larger Pfam
scores on average, the number of cases found by Fpfamalone is greatest in this range. In the lowest range (<0) we
observe that for Category A hits FPfam also typically has
higher bitscores. However, in this range we also see a relatively large number of cases found by Fpfam-alone in
comparison to Pfam-alone.

Effect of E-value cut-offs on sequence coverage
To avoid any potential bias in the results due to selecting
a single E-value cut-off to define hits, we reanalyzed the
hmmpfam results using three different cut-offs, 1e-1, 1e-5
and 1e-10, as shown in Figure 7. The difference in results
using the Pfam or FPfam libraries alone is most pronounced for the 30 fungal genomes that were used to train
the FPfam library; while, for the five new genomes this difference is not as high (i.e. improved coverage of 1.43%,
0.79%, 1.96% for 1e-1, 1e-5, 1e-10, respectively). However, for the five test genomes if we look at the combination results they give (4.48%, 4.26%, 5.56% for 1e-1, 1e5, 1e-10, respectively), i.e. significantly better coverage
than using Pfam alone. This confirms that our fungal-specific HMM library produces many additional hits and suggests that the combination of the general Pfam library and
a kingdom-specific library improves coverage, regardless
of the E-value search sensitivity selected by the user.

Comparison of FPfam and Pfam results for sequences in the five new fungal genomes; the test case. For each of
the five fungal genomes, considered as a test case here, the Figure shows the percentage of sequences found to contain at least
one domain using Pfam, FPfam and a combination. The average coverage was found to be 60.10% (Pfam), 61.53% (Fpfam) and
64.58% (combination) for the 2903 domains represented in the FPfam library. Please note that genome names are shown as a
four letter code; comprising first letter from the species name and 3 letters from the genus, also shown in the Table 1

Conclusion
We have constructed a fungal-specific HMM library,
FPfam, using sequences from 30 genomes and tested its
performance against sequences from five new genomes.
Our results show that FPfam provides improved sensitivity and coverage for domains represented in the library. By
using FPfam, more sequences can be annotated as containing at least one of these domains and more multidomain proteins are found at a given E-value cut-off. The
best performance is obtained by combining FPfam with
the general-purpose Pfam library, which finds some
sequences missed by FPfam and allows additional
domains to be located that are not represented in the cur-

rent version of the FPfam library. Use of a kingdom-specific HMM library therefore effectively reduces the
"twilight" zone and finds a significant number of difficult
cases that might otherwise be missed. Indeed, the method
demonstrates the ability to annotate additional examples
of otherwise well-characterised, ubiquitous domains that
Pfam and fungal-specific, rare motifs that are generally
not well represented in the standard PFam HMM library.
Currently we are applying the domainer/mkdom algorithms [23] for all predicted proteins from the 35 fungal
species, in order to have a database like Pfam-B providing
coverage for all protein sequences in our e-Fungi fungal

classify all fungal sequences into super-families, families
and subfamilies in a hierarchical fashion. The FPfam families will be made available as full alignments of these
domains.

Methods
The Pfam database
Pfam is a database of multiple alignments of conserved
regions or domains in proteins. Current release 18 of
Pfam comprises alignments for more than 7973 domains
[8]. The Pfam database has two parts: Pfam-A contains
models constructed from human-curated multiple alignments covering 75% of UniProt [24] (the largest available
collection of protein sequences), while Pfam-B has models constructed from alignments obtained by an automated clustering of the rest of UniProt derived from the
Prodom database [25]. A recent development in the Pfam
infrastructure is called Pfam clans or Pfam-C; this contains
information about Pfam families that arise from a common ancestor. With ever-increasing coverage in protein
databases, and based on human curated alignments, Pfam
is a highly suitable and useable database for the large-scale
annotation of proteins arriving from newly sequenced
genomes. The easiest way to do this is to scan newly pre-

dicted Open Reading Frames (ORFs) against the HMMs
using hmmpfam, provided in the HMMER package [26].
A typical Pfam-A entry contains a seed alignment, an
alignment of a representative set of sequences, an HMM
built using the seed alignment, a full alignment of all
(detectable) sequences in the family and a description of
the family with additional details such as the threshold
parameters used to create the full alignment. Pfam seed
alignments are saved and remain stable as long as they are
able to detect all the known members of the family; otherwise the missing members are added to the alignment to
improve the sensitivity of the HMMs. Seed and full alignments are curated manually and then the Pfam-A entry is
annotated and linked to other motif databases [19].
Identifying Pfam domains in 30 fungal species
Predicted ORFs from 30 fungal genomes, including two
oomycetes, were obtained from the Broad Institute. These
sequences were filtered for a length of more than 40
amino acids and the resulting proteome sizes for each
genome are shown in Table 1. Pfam database release 18
was downloaded and installed locally. Each fungal
sequence was scanned against Pfam HMMs using hmmpfam, from the HMMER package, applying an E-value cut-

Figure different E-value cut-offs on sequence coverage
Effect of7
Effect of different E-value cut-offs on sequence coverage. The average percentage of sequences with at least one identified domain for the 30 original and five new fungal genomes is shown, for three different E-value cut-offs: 1e-1, 1e-5 and 1e10. The percentage coverage using the FPfam library is higher than using Pfam alone. The best results are obtained when the
outputs from the Pfam and FPfam library are combined.

off of 0.1. With this cut-off, 57.15% of the total fungal
proteins were found to contain at least one Pfam domain
and 5314 different Pfam domains were detected in these
30 fungal species.
Constructing a fungal-specific HMM library (FPfam)
We adopt the following procedure to construct a fungalspecific HMM library from the 30 original genomes:

a. For each domain, a maximum of two protein sequences
per genome below an E-value cut-off of 1e-3 were
obtained from the training dataset of fungal genomes. The
training set of genomes is shown without asterisks in both
Table 1 and the fungal species tree [see Additional File 2].
To avoid any bias towards the more closely related set of
five genomes from Saccharomyces 'sensu stricto' clade, the
number of sequences to be included in the seed alignment
from this group was reduced to a maximum of six. The Evalue of 1e-3 was used to reduce the probability of introducing false positive hits into the seed alignments. A
restriction of at least five sequences per model with an E-

value less then 1e-3 reduced the number of domains to
2953. Furthermore, to avoid models becoming too specific, a maximum of four sequences were added from representative species of the different domains of life,
selecting one homologue from Human, Mouse, plants
and bacteria where available.
b. The set of sequences gathered for each of the 2953
domains was aligned using ClustalW [27]. To be compatible with Pfam, the alignment format was converted to
selex.
c. All domain alignments were gathered into a single flatfile, adding the default Pfam-A annotation and parameters.
d. Global and local HMMs were constructed using
hmmbuild from HMMER.
e. HMMs were calibrated using hmmcalibrate from
HMMER.

sidering the results from both libraries, applying a range
of different E-value cut-offs (0.1, 1e-5, 1e-10).

Authors' contributions
Protein sequences from 30 fungal genomes were scanned
through the fungal version of Pfam (FPfam) database with
the E-value cut-off of 0.1. FPfam results were compared
with those obtained from searches against Pfam HMMs
using the same E-value cut-off.
Testing FPfam on five new genomes
As a test case, ORFs from five more recently sequenced
fungal genomes were obtained from the Broad Institute
[28] and from the DSM [29]. These are the species marked
with asterisks in Table 1 and the phylogenetic tree [see
Additional File 2]. These genomes were filtered removing
protein sequences with lengths less than 40 amino acids.
The resulting size of the proteome for each of the five new
fungal genomes used in this test is shown in Table 1.

To perform the Pfam and FPfam comparison, each
sequence from the five new fungal genomes was scanned
against the HMMs from both libraries, using hmmpfam.
The same E-value cut-off of 0.1 was applied in both cases.
The libraries are calibrated in the same way, so we expect
that the same E-value will result in a similar number of
false positives in each case.
Comparison of bitscores between FPfam and Pfam hits
After the completion of all the hmmpfam searches against
the training and test set of genomes, using both the Pfam
and FPfam HMMs, the hmmer normalized alignment
scores (known as bitscores) were extracted. We divided
the results into two main categories: A, where hits were
available from both the Pfam and FPfam libraries and B,
where one of the libraries did not produce any hits.
Bitscores were assigned to six bins of bitscore ranges and
the frequency of hits calculated for category A, where the
FPfam score is higher than Pfam and vice versa (named
Pfam>FPfam and FPfam>Pfam respectively) and for category B where either FPfam or Pfam results (named Pfamalone and FPfam-alone), respectively, were missing. To
avoid frequencies being counted twice for category A
where both Pfam and Fpfam bitscores were available, only
the maximum score of the two was used to determine its
respective bin.
Effect on the coverage of domains by varying E-value
thresholds
The probability of false positives when searching a database of sequences is expressed in terms of E-values. To test
the effect of E-value changes, we compared the coverage of
sequences with at least one domain detected by either
FPfam or Pfam alone to that of domains detected by con-
