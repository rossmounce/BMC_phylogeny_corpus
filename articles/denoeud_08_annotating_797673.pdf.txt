<p>A method for de novo genome annotation
G-Mo.R-Se: gene modeling using RNA-Seq using high-throughput cDNA sequencing data.</p>

Abstract
Next generation technologies enable massive-scale cDNA sequencing (so-called RNA-Seq). Mainly
because of the difficulty of aligning short reads on exon-exon junctions, no attempts have been
made so far to use RNA-Seq for building gene models de novo, that is, in the absence of a set of
known genes and/or splicing events. We present G-Mo.R-Se (Gene Modelling using RNA-Seq), an
approach aimed at building gene models directly from RNA-Seq and demonstrate its utility on the
grapevine genome.

Background

Next generation sequencing technologies generate many
short reads of DNA fragments in a reduced time scale and
have lowered the cost per nucleotide [1,2]. Genomic short
reads have been used to investigate genetic variation [3],
genomic rearrangements [4], DNA methylation [5], and transcription factor binding sites (Chip-Seq) [6,7]. New algorithms had to be developed for genome resequencing, in
order to map very high numbers of reads efficiently [8-11], as
well as for de novo genome assemblies, in order to cope with
the short length of reads (usually less than 35 nucleotides)
[12-16]. The next-generation sequencing methods have also
been applied to sequence cDNAs rather than genomic DNA,
in order to catalogue microRNAs [17-19] or analyze the tran-

scriptional landscape of a number of eukaryotic genomes: this
technology is called RNA-Seq [20-26].
Before the development of the RNA-Seq technology, largescale RNA analysis could be performed with two types of
approaches. The first, tag-based approaches [27], such as
serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) [28] and massively
parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) [29], were based on the
sequencing of previously cloned tags located in specific transcript locations (usually 3' or 5' ends). Transcript abundance
could be derived from tag counts in already known loci, but no
new genes or new alternative splice forms could be discovered. The alternative approach, hybridization-based microarrays, has the potential of monitoring the expression level on

the whole transcriptome (not necessarily biased towards
known genes, when using whole genome tiling arrays [3032]) at low cost, but it is biased by the background levels of
hybridization and the fact that probes differ in their hybridization properties. Nevertheless, the gold standard method for
transcript discovery remains expressed sequence tag (EST)
sequencing (by Sanger technology) of cloned cDNAs [33-35].
Its main limitation, in addition to the relatively high cost, is
that this method is sensitive to cloning biases. The RNA-Seq
technology combines the advantages of the previous largescale RNA analysis methods by enabling the monitoring of
the transcriptional landscape of a whole genome at low cost,
without the biases introduced by arrays, and has the additional advantage of providing information on the transcript
structures (exon-exon boundaries), as EST Sanger type
sequencing does on a longer range, but without cloning
biases. Moreover, because a large number of reads can easily
be obtained, RNA-Seq is sensitive enough to detect transcription for genes with low expression levels, which are usually
missed by EST analysis [21,23,25].
In recent studies, RNA-Seq has mainly been used to quantify
the expression levels of already annotated loci, identify differentially expressed genes, and measure expression outside of
those loci (in intronic or intergenic regions) [21-24,26]. Additionally, structural information has been used to detect
already known alternative splice forms [22,23], identify new
transcriptional events in relation to known loci (alternative
splicing, 5' ends) [24,26], and refine annotated gene structures or propose novel gene models [21,23]. However, no
attempts have been made to take advantage of the connectivity information contained in RNA-Seq data for building gene
models de novo, that is, in the absence of a set of known genes
and/or splicing events.
Traditionally, EST, cDNA and protein sequences are the most
accurate resource for identifying gene loci and annotating the
exon/intron structure on genomic sequences [36]. These
resources can be mapped on a genomic sequence with a global
alignment strategy that allows gap insertions of genomic
regions corresponding to potential introns bordered by splice
sites [37-41]. The resulting positions of exon and intron
boundaries can then be assembled to build complete transcript structures [42]. But the methods used to build spliced
alignments of ESTs on genomes are not applicable to short
reads, since they require that the sequence blocks surrounding a splice junction are long enough and highly similar to the
genomic region in order to build a non-ambiguous alignment
covering the exon-exon boundary. New methods are now
emerging for building spliced alignments of short sequence
reads [43]. However, they still require a priori information
about the genome analyzed (splice site characteristics) in
order to reduce the number of junctions to test, since testing
all possible 'GT/C-AG' pairs in a genome is obviously unfeasible.

Volume 9, Issue 12, Article R175

Denoeud et al. R175.2

In this study, we present a method aimed at using RNA-Seq
short reads to build de novo gene models. First, candidate
exons are built directly from the positions of the reads
mapped on the genome (without ab initio assembly of the
reads), and then all possible splice junctions between those
exons are tested against unmapped reads: the testing of junctions is directed by the information available in the RNA-Seq
dataset rather than by a priori knowledge about the genome.
Exons can then be chained into stranded gene models. We
demonstrate the feasibility of this method, which we call GMo.R-Se (for Gene Modelling using RNA-Seq), on the grapevine genome [44] using approximately 175 million Solexa/
Illumina RNA-Seq reads from four tissues. This allowed the
identification of new exons (in known loci) and alternative
splice forms, as well as entirely new loci. We show that this
approach is an efficient alternative to standard cDNA
sequencing: it detects more transcripts at lower cost. It could
be particularly helpful in the case of species for which few
resources are available (that is, that are very distant from the
species currently present in the ESTs/protein databases). GMo.R-Se can also be combined with other data into an automatic or manual eukaryotic genome annotation. All the data
described in this article are available from the G-Mo.R-Se
website [45].

Results and discussion
Building gene models from RNA-Seq reads
We obtained 173 million Solexa/Illumina RNA-Seq reads
from mRNAs extracted from four tissues (leaf, root, stem, callus). Of these, 138 million reads could be mapped unambiguously with SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package)
[8] to the Vitis vinifera genome sequence assembly [44]. The
mapped reads were contiged to build candidate exons, which
we call 'covtigs' (for coverage contigs, that is, regions obtained
by contiging adjacent positions with coverage depth greater
than a threshold). Candidate junctions between covtigs were
then tested using the unmapped reads. Finally, a graph
approach was used to chain the exons through validated junctions into gene models (see Materials and methods; Figure 1).
All possible chainings between exons were retained, which
allowed the annotation of alternative splice forms. The covtigs that were not involved in any validated junction were discarded, implying that no mono-exonic transcripts were
annotated. The procedure, which we named G-Mo.R-Se, produced 46,062 transcript models, clustered in 19,486 loci (an
average of 2.4 transcripts per locus). A plausible coding
sequence (CDS) was found for 28,399 models, clustered in
12,341 loci.
Covtig definition was essential for the subsequent testing of
junctions to be efficient, especially with respect to the splits
and fusions of exons (see Materials and methods). The splitting of exons into separate covtigs can occur when the read
coverage depth goes down (below the depth threshold used
for building covtigs), which can be due either to repeated

G-Mo.R-Se method for building gene models from short reads
Figure 1
G-Mo.R-Se method for building gene models from short reads. The five black boxes show the 5 steps of the approach. Step 1 (covtig
construction) is the construction of covtigs (coverage contigs), which are built from positions where short reads are mapped above a given depth
threshold. Step 2 (candidate exons) is the definition of a list of stranded candidate exons derived from each covtig. Splice sites are searched 100
nucleotides around each covtig boundary, which allows the orientation of the candidate exons on the forward or the reverse strand, as shown in the
second box. Step 3 (junction validation) consists of the validation of junctions between candidate exons using a word dictionary built from the unmapped
reads. During step 4 (graph of candidates exons linked by validated junctions), a graph is created where nodes are candidate exons (black boxes) and
oriented edges (purple arrows) between two nodes represent validated junctions. The two last connected components show an example of a split gene
that can be corrected using open reading frame detection between the last exon of the first model and the first exon of the second model. In the final step,
step 5 (model construction and coding sequence detection) we go through the previous graph and extract all possible paths between each source and each
sink. Each path will then represent a predicted transcript, and a CDS will be identified for each transcript. Models M1, M2, M5 and M7 (untranslated regions
are in grey, introns in black and coding exons in red) correctly model real transcripts T1, T2, T3 and T5 (untranslated regions are in grey, and introns and
exons are indicated by black lines and boxes, respectively). As all possible paths are extracted from the graph, some of them may not correspond to real
transcripts (for example, models M3, M4 and M6).

regions (we only retained the reads that mapped at a unique
position on the genome), to mismatches/gaps in the genomic
sequence (we only kept the reads mapped with at most two
mismatches and no indels), or to experimental biases leading
to depth variations in the cDNAs sequenced and to non-normalization of the library. Indeed, some biases in the coverage
uniformity of reads have been observed in previous RNA-Seq
studies [23].
We aimed at correcting the splits in two ways. First, at the
covtig definition step (step 1 in Figure 1), we extended the cov-

tigs using all 16-mers found in the reads, in order to step over
mismatches and short repeats. Then, at the model building
step (step 4 in Figure 1), we fused together models that were
linked by an open reading frame.
The artifactual fusing of exons into one single covtig can occur
when the mRNA sample contains immature transcripts with
retained introns, providing reads that map into the introns.
Since the immature transcripts are expected to be under-represented in the set of mRNAs, the depth in the retained
introns is expected to be lower than in the adjacent exons: set-

ting an appropriate depth threshold for the building of covtigs
should avoid such fusions.
The depth threshold used for covtig construction was set to
balance the number of splits and the number of fusions.
Indeed, low thresholds will generate few splits but numerous
fusions, and conversely, high thresholds will generate few
fusions but numerous splits. In order to correct more fusions,
we could extend the testing of junctions inside the covtigs,
instead of testing junctions only between covtigs.
We evaluated the direct mapping of reads, the initial candidate exons (covtigs), and the final models produced by GMo.R-Se at the nucleotide level in comparison to the reference V. vinifera annotation [44] (Table 1). The depth threshold set to build the covtigs discards most of the noise (63% of
the nucleotides covered by reads are located in intergenic or
intronic compartments compared to only 40% of the nucleotides covered by covtigs) while retaining the signal falling in
exons (66% of the exonic nucleotides are covered by reads,
and 56% are covered by covtigs). This noise is likely to correspond to transcriptional background, expression of transposable elements, or genomic contamination in the samples
sequenced, rather than to SOAP mapping artifacts, since we
only retained positions where reads could be mapped
uniquely, with at most two mismatches. When considering
final models instead of initial covtigs, the sensitivity
decreases slightly (from 56% to 43% of exonic bases covered)
but the specificity increases greatly (from 60% to 80% of the
nucleotides - in covtigs or models - fall in the exonic compartment), suggesting that most of the covtigs that could not be
linked to any other covtig resulted from transcriptional or
experimental noise. The models still include about 1% of the
nucleotides from the intergenic compartment, indicating that
this compartment harbors new, previously unannotated,
genes.
We managed to select a satisfying depth threshold with
respect to the splits/fusions (Figure S1 in Additional data file

Volume 9, Issue 12, Article R175

1), as well as the signal/noise ratios. Obviously, the optimal
depth threshold will be highly dependent on the characteristics of the dataset analyzed, such as the complexity of the
transcriptome, the amount of alternative splicing, the amount
of transcription outside of protein-coding genes, and the
sequencing depth, and must be carefully selected in order for
G-Mo.R-Se to work optimally.

Comparing the G-Mo.R-Se pipeline with direct
assembly of reads
We compared the final G-Mo.R-Se models and the structures
obtained by assembling the reads with Velvet [14] and mapping the assembled contigs to the genome with est2genome
[37] (Table 2). Fewer reference genes are overlapped (on at
least one nucleotide) by spliced Velvet contigs than by models
(40.3% and 50.3%, respectively). The number of genes overlapped on at least 75% of their nucleotides drops even more
for Velvet contigs compared to G-Mo.R-Se models (from
30.6% to 11.8%), indicating that most of the genes that are
overlapped by Velvet contigs are not covered over their whole
length. The average number of models or Velvet contigs per
gene - 1.28 and 2.05, respectively - also reflects that the reference genes are more fragmented by Velvet contigs than by GMo.R-Se models. Additionally, we investigated the accuracy
of the G-Mo.R-Se models and Velvet contigs on the structural
point of view using a collection of cDNAs: 56% of the cDNA
loci are predicted exactly (all exon/intron boundaries) by GMo.R-Se models, and 32% by Velvet contigs (Table S1 in
Additional data file 1). We compared the average coverage
depth of reference genes that are correctly annotated by GMo.R-Se models and Velvet contigs (that is, that have at least
75% of their nucleotides covered). A minimal depth of 4 is sufficient for G-Mo.R-Se models to annotate genes satisfactorily,
whereas a minimal depth of 13 is required for Velvet contigs
(Figure 2). Since G-Mo.R-Se relies on the genome sequence,
no significant overlap between reads is necessary to put them
together in a covtig: they just need to be adjacent on the
genome. This explains why a much lower coverage depth is
required for G-Mo.R-Se than for Velvet. Unlike direct assem-

bly of reads, the G-Mo.R-Se pipeline is able to detect transcripts that are weakly represented in the reads set (either
because they are weakly expressed or problematic to extract).

Comparing the G-Mo.R-Se approach to a classic cDNA
sequencing approach
We compared the G-Mo.R-Se pipeline to a classic cDNA
sequencing approach, using a reference set of 112,175 V. vinifera cDNA sequences from five tissues (including 87,199
multi-exonic cDNAs clustered in 7,895 loci) that were
sequenced with the Sanger technology during the course of
the V. vinifera genome sequencing and annotation project
[44] (Table 3).
The 46,062 G-Mo.R-Se models overlap about 70% of the
7,895 cDNA loci (on more than 75% of their nucleotides). The
most obvious reason why about 15% of the cDNA loci are not
overlapped by any model is that they correspond to repetitive
DNA. We compared the proportion of unique 32-mers (in the
whole V. vinifera genome) for the 5,449 cDNA loci well covered by models and the 1,064 cDNA loci uncovered by models. It appears that most of the cDNA loci that were missed by
models are mainly constituted of non-unique 32-mers (Figure 3). When considering only the 4,822 loci where all the 32mers are unique, 95% of the cDNA loci are hit by a model
(Table 3). Among the 5% of cDNA loci that are missed, some
are too poorly covered by reads for covtigs to be built and/or
junctions to be validated, and others have reads in their
introns, which create fused exons, preventing the models
from being detected as spliced, since one large covtig spans
the whole locus.
Interestingly, G-Mo.R-Se detects 2.5 times as many loci as the
standard cDNA sequencing approach (19,486 loci versus
7,895). Among the 19,486 G-Mo.R-Se loci, only 36% overlap
cDNA loci. We compared the characteristics of the 5,698 GMo.R-Se loci that overlap cDNAs on at least 50% of their
nucleotides and the 12,392 loci that are outside cDNA loci
(Figure 4). The G-Mo.R-Se loci that are new with respect to
standard cDNAs tend to be expressed at lower levels than the
loci that overlap cDNAs. These loci are investigated in more
detail in the section 'Identifying novel genes and improving
gene annotation'. The RNA-Seq technology, combined with
G-Mo.R-Se, is able to detect gene expression that would be
scored silent with a standard cDNA cloning and sequencing
approach, or would necessitate an extensive Sanger sequencing effort.
On average, we annotated 2.4 models per locus. By removing
the redundancy (structures fully included in other structures;
see Materials and methods) from the cDNA sequences, we
retained 9,827 representative sequences, with an average of
1.25 transcripts per locus. The models appear to be capturing
more alternative splice forms than the cDNAs. However, as
we build all possible models that correspond to the longest
possible paths going from one covtig to another through vali-

Denoeud et al. R175.5

dated junctions, some of the models probably do not correspond to real transcripts (for instance, if they link alternative
exons that are incompatible, like models M3 and M4 in Figure
1). Since the long-range splice contiguity can not be inferred
from short reads, we quantified short-range alternative splicing events in the models (all models, and only CDS portions
of coding models) and in the cDNAs [46] (Table 4).
The G-Mo.R-Se pipeline does not allow the detection of
intron retentions (IRs), since we do not currently test junctions inside covtigs: if the depth in the retained intron is
greater than the threshold we used to build the covtigs, we
will get only one splice variant containing the retained intron.
It is likely that most of the exon fusions we detected by comparison with the cDNAs (Figure S1 in Additional data file 1)
correspond to cases of IRs. However, we were able to detect
alternative donors or acceptors, skipped exons, and mutually
exclusive exons. The relative abundance of these different
classes of events is similar in the models and the cDNAs (from
the most prevalent to the least prevalent: alternative acceptors/donors, skipped exons, mutually exclusive exons), but
the total number of alternative splicing events in models
(11,842 in all models, 5,152 in CDS portions) is much higher
than in cDNAs (944 events, when removing the 1,227 IRs).
The splice forms expressed at low levels, which could not be
detected with cDNA cloning and Sanger sequencing, appear
to harbor an unexpected number of alternative splicing
events. It is likely that all these events are not compatible with
the coding capacity of the transcripts. However, when
restraining the analysis to the coding portions of models with
plausible CDSs (that is, likely to be correctly predicted), the
number of alternative splicing events remains higher than for
cDNAs and the proportions of the different types of events
remain unchanged. As an example, Figure 5 shows a locus
where three alternative coding models were predicted: two of
them (M2 and M3) are already supported by EST evidence, but
the third model (M1) corresponds to a novel alternative splice
form. Although the number of alternative splicing events is
higher in the RNA-Seq dataset than in the cDNA dataset, the
proportion of loci where alternative splicing occurs is similar
for cDNA clusters and G-Mo.R-Se models (10% and 8%,
respectively). These results are in agreement with previous
studies that showed that the fraction of alternatively spliced
genes is lower in plants than in animals [47]. Notably, of the
944 non-IR events detected in cDNAs, the models detect only
175 (18.5%): though some of these events might result from
incorrect mapping of the cDNAs, most of them are likely to be
real, and to have been missed by G-Mo.R-Se (Table 5). The
pipeline detected only 7.2% of the skipped exons and 25% of
the mutually exclusive exons, which is likely due to the limited number of neighboring covtigs (20) we tested to validate
the junctions. Only 22.6% of the alternative donors/acceptors
were detected because we searched for junctions only 100
nucleotides around the covtig boundaries, which limited the
window where alternative splice sites could be discovered
(see Materials and methods). Obviously, the model construc-

tion was not designed to capture the whole alternative splicing landscape of a genome. But still, the non-exhaustive view
that we obtain is much richer than what could have been suspected from classic EST sequencing. In order to study alternative splicing exhaustively, which is out of the scope of this
study, specific tools will need to be developed.

Identifying novel genes and improving gene annotation
Expectedly, since V. vinifera belongs to a phylogenetic
branch where a profusion of resources are available, most of
the models (95%) that fall outside of cDNAs overlap the reference annotation [44], or other resources such as GeneWise
hits with Uniprot proteins [39,49], and ESTs from other species (Table S2 in Additional data file 1). However, 675 models
are completely novel, or 116 when considering only models
with a plausible CDS. We compared the characteristics of the
models that are novel and the models that are supported by
evidence, which we now call 'known' models (Table 5).
The proportion of models with a plausible CDS drops when
considering the novel models compared to the known models
(from 65% to 17%), as well as the average number of exons per

model (from 8.2 to 2.3 for all models). It is likely that some of
the novel models correspond to false predictions: if one junction is validated erroneously, it will create a false two-exon
model. Nevertheless, the proportion of models with more
than two exons is higher in the subset of novel models having
plausible CDSs (53%) compared to all novel models (17%),
which suggests that at least some of them are genuine novel
coding loci. In addition, the novel loci that are non-coding
could either correspond to coding transcripts that were misannotated by the pipeline (wrong splice site generating a
frameshift, models associating incompatible exons), to coding transcripts where no CDS could be detected because of
frameshifts in the genomic sequence, to genuine non-coding
transcripts, or to transcriptional/experimental noise (Figure
1). The structure of one of the novel models, spanning eight
exons, is shown in Figure S2 in Additional data file 1. A Blast
[48] search against Uniprot [49] revealed an homology to a
transcription regulator from Arabidopsis thaliana. The
homology was below the sensitivity threshold required to
map proteins to the genome during the annotation process. In
addition to the discovery of novel splice forms and novel loci,
G-Mo.R-Se models enrich the reference annotation by
extending (in 5' or 3') about 40% of the reference genes they
hit. G-Mo.R-Se models thus constitute a valuable resource for
improving V. vinifera gene annotation.

Conclusion

In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of building gene
models de novo, using only RNA-Seq reads and the corresponding genomic sequence, with a relatively straightforward
annotation pipeline that we call G-Mo.R-Se. Using a dataset
of approximately 175 million Solexa reads, it could detect
more loci than could be identified by cloning and sequencing
approximately 120,000 cDNAs, at a cost about 20 times lower
(55% of the multi-exonic genes from the annotation are overlapped by models versus only 35% by V. vinifera cDNAs).
Especially, G-Mo.R-Se allowed the annotation of loci
expressed at very low levels. We show that this approach efficiently deciphers real transcripts from transcriptional/experimental noise since the junction validation step removes false

be exhaustive in the detection of alternative splicing events,
G-Mo.R-Se detected more alternative splice forms than the
cDNA resource, with no need for a priori knowledge of the
exon-exon junctions to test. Finally, we could also identify

putative novel genes (that had been missed by the automatic
annotation procedure) in a genome that is already very well
annotated owing to the plethora of resources available in this
phylum. We tested the G-Mo.R-Se pipeline with Solexa/Illumina RNA-Seq reads but it can readily accept any other type
of short reads, or combine reads from different technologies.
For future genome projects, it is conceivable to think of performing the annotation using RNA-Seq runs treated with GMo.R-Se as the unique resource, provided that the tissues or
cell types sampled are representative enough to drive a comprehensive annotation. This approach will be particularly valuable in phyla where few resources are available (that is, that
are very distant from the species currently present in the
EST/protein databases), where the expensive and time-consuming step of constructing cDNA libraries could be avoided.
When other resources are available, the gene models can also
be combined with other data into automatic or manual
eukaryotic genome annotation pipelines.
Although the G-Mo.R-Se pipeline works satisfactorily on the
V. vinifera dataset, it is still fairly simple and we can think of

several refinements. First, at the moment, no mono-exonic
models are produced (such models represent only 8% of
annotated grape genes), but we could easily bring back the
covtigs that were not linked to any other covtig by a validated
junction, if they contain a CDS that exceeds a certain length.
Next, at the covtig building step, instead of using a fixed depth
threshold, we could adapt it to the environment: the covtigs
would be built to coincide with sharp increases/decreases in
depth. Such a strategy should enable the annotation of separate exons in case of IR. In order to correct even more fusions,
it would also be straightforward to test candidate junctions
inside the covtigs in addition to the junctions tested between
covtigs. Since the scope of this study was to annotate as many
genes as possible, we chose to pool together the reads from all
four tissues before building the covtigs. But we could also
consider building covtigs and gene models separately in different samples, in order to investigate differential expression,
although to the detriment of sensitivity. A last, more elaborate refinement would be to use the depth information in
order to link together only covtigs that are likely to be part of
the same transcript, instead of building all models that correspond to the longest possible paths in the graph of covtigs

Materials and methods
RNA-Seq experiments
RNA-Seq reads were obtained (as described in Del Fabbro et
al., unpublished data) by sequencing cDNA obtained from
four tissue samples with the Solexa/Illumina technology: leaf
(11 lanes), root (9 lanes), callus (9 lanes), and stem (9 lanes).
The mRNA molecules were purified from total RNA extractions and fragmented before cDNA synthesis (with random
hexamer primers). The protocol was not strand-specific. The
single-end reads obtained were 32 nucleotides long, except
for 5 lanes in the callus sample, where the reads were 35
nucleotides long. The resulting 172,545,778 usable reads (5.4
Gbases) were mapped to the V. vinifera genome [44] using
SOAP [8] with a seed length of 12 and default parameters:
138,326,238 reads (4.6 Gbases) were mapped at one unique
position with at most two mismatches and no indels. As a consequence, reads that align to exon-exon junctions could not
be mapped to the genomic sequence.

Building gene models from short reads
The G-Mo.R-Se method for building gene models from short
reads is summarized in Figure 1. The first step is the definition of covtigs (coverage contigs). They are built by contiging
the positions where short reads are aligned above a certain
coverage depth threshold. This threshold is a parameter that
needs to be adjusted in order to balance sensitivity and specificity as well as splits and fusions. In the absence of a training
set to quantify the splits and fusions, this parameter can also
be optimized by maximizing the number of junctions validated in the next step. Before the subsequent testing of junctions, the covtigs were extended using all 16-mers found in

short reads, in order to step over mismatches and short
repeats. It is important to note that the read length limits the
detection of very short exons (< 35 nucleotides).
In the next step, we searched for donor (GT or GC on the forward strand, and AG or AC on the reverse strand) and acceptor (AG on forward strand and CT on reverse strand) splice
sites 100 nucleotides inside and outside each covtig boundary. This enabled us to create a list of oriented candidate
exons (with putative alternative donor and/or acceptor splice
sites) for each covtig.
The third step was the validation of junctions between candidate exons using unmapped reads, since reads that align to
exon-exon junctions were not mapped to the genomic
sequence. We tested all candidate exons derived from a given
covtig with the candidate exons derived from the 20 next covtigs. All the putative junctions were tested using a word dictionary approach. The dictionary (with a word size of 25) was
built using the unmapped reads. Ten words (8 nucleotides on
the first exon and 17 nucleotides on the second exon, 9/16, 10/
15, 11/14, 12/13, 13/12, 14/11, 15/10, 16/9, 17/8) were derived
from each putative junction, and their presence in the dictionary was tested. In order to validate a junction, at least five
different words need to be found in the dictionary, and the
total number of occurrences of all words derived from each
junction needs to be of the same order of magnitude as the
average depth of the adjacent covtigs (greater than 1/10 of
their average depth).
The efficiency of the junction validation procedure relies on
the covtig definition step for the following reasons: only the
junctions between each covtig and the 20 next covtigs are
tested, meaning that if more than 20 'false' covtigs are defined
between 2 'real' covtigs, the junction between the two real
covtigs will not be tested; only 100 nucleotides around the

GeneWise alignments of Uniprot proteins. Alignment of V. vinifera cDNAs from [44] are in red, and public V. vinifera ESTs are in light green. The next track
displays the models predicted by G-Mo.R-Se (untranslated region in grey, CDS in red). Initial covtigs are displayed as brown boxes (average depth of covtigs
is written below each covtig). Alignments of velvet contigs are displayed in purple. Ab initio models produced by geneID [51] and SNAP [52] are displayed
in blue and pink, respectively. The short reads coverage depth is plotted on the last track (black): the dashed red line shows the threshold used to build
covtigs. Model M2 is confirmed by numerous resources, model M3 seems to be a minor alternative splice form (it is only supported by two public ESTs: E1

Models were clustered in loci as described in Materials and methods.

covtig boundary are scanned for putative splice sites, meaning that if the covtigs are too short or too long, the correct
junction will not be tested; only junctions between covtigs are
tested, meaning that if a covtig corresponds to a fusion
between two exons, the correct junction will not be tested,
and the final model will include a retained intron. On the
other hand, if an exon is split between two covtigs, no junction
will be valid between those covtigs, leading to the splitting of
a gene into separate models. As a consequence, in the absence
of a training set (annotated genes, ESTs, and so on) to calibrate the depth threshold used for building covtigs, it is possible to optimize the threshold by maximizing the number of
validated junctions. G-Mo.R-Se can thus be used for de novo
annotation.
For the last step, the model construction relies on the graph
of candidate exons linked by validated junctions on the same
strand. The models correspond to all the longest paths linking
candidate exons through validated junctions. Candidate
exons that are not involved in any validated junction are discarded, implying that no mono-exonic models are produced.
In order to correct potential gene splits, we fuse together
adjacent models (on the same strand) that are linked by an
open reading frame.
Additionally, all models produced by G-Mo.R-Se are searched
for CDSs. When the longest CDS (if greater than 50 amino
acids) spans at least two-thirds of the nucleotides of a model
or the number of non-coding exons is lower than the number
of coding exons, the CDS is qualified as plausible. Models
with plausible CDSs are likely to correspond to protein coding
genes. Plausible CDSs could be detected for about two-thirds
of the models. The G-Mo.R-Se models can be downloaded
from the G-Mo.R-Se website [45] and visualized on the V.
vinifera genome browser [50].

G-Mo.R-Se models and cDNA analysis (clustering,
alternative splicing detection)
The same clustering procedure was applied to models and
cDNA sequences aligned on the genome. We used a single

linkage clustering approach, where a link between two models was created if they had a cumulated exonic overlap (on the
same strand) of at least 100 nucleotides (only overlaps of at
least 10 nucleotides were considered). A graph-based
approach was used to resolve the single linkage clustering.
Additionally, the redundancy was removed from the cDNAs
by discarding all transcript structures that were fully included
in longer structures. We detected all pairwise alternative
splicing events between intron pairs, with the same method
as described in [46]. All tandemly duplicated genes were discarded from the alternative splicing events detected, since
such genes may be artificially linked by cDNA mapping as
well as model construction, and would generate false alternative splice forms spanning several loci instead of one. However, it is notable that, since the pipeline builds all possible
models, it will always predict the two separate correct models
in addition to the incorrect joined model(s).
