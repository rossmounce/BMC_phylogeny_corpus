Abstract
Background: In some genomic applications it is necessary to design large numbers of PCR primers in exons
flanking one or several introns on the basis of orthologous gene sequences in related species. The primer pairs
designed by this target gene approach are called "intron-flanking primers" or because they are located in exonic
sequences which are usually conserved between related species, "conserved primers". They are useful for largescale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and marker development, especially in species, such as
wheat, for which a large number of ESTs are available but for which genome sequences and intron/exon
boundaries are not available. To date, no suitable high-throughput tool is available for this purpose.
Results: We have developed, the ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline, for designing intron-flanking primers for largescale SNP discovery and marker development, and demonstrated its utility in wheat. This tool uses non-redundant
wheat EST sequences, such as wheat contigs and singleton ESTs, and related genomic sequences, such as those
of rice, as inputs. It aligns the ESTs to the genomic sequences to identify unique colinear exon blocks and predicts
intron lengths. Intron-flanking primers are then designed based on the intron/exon information using the Primer3
core program or BatchPrimer3. Finally, a tab-delimited file containing intron-flanking primer pair sequences and
their primer properties is generated for primer ordering and their PCR applications. Using this tool, 1,922 binmapped wheat ESTs (31.8% of the 6,045 in total) were found to have unique colinear exon blocks suitable for
primer design and 1,821 primer pairs were designed from these single- or low-copy genes for PCR amplification
and SNP discovery. With these primers and subsequently designed genome-specific primers, a total of 1,527 loci
were found to contain one or more genome-specific SNPs.
Conclusion: The ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline for designing intron-flanking primers was developed and its
utility demonstrated. The tool can be used for SNP discovery, genetic variation assays and marker development
for any target genome that has abundant ESTs and a related reference genome that has been fully sequenced. The
ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline has been implemented as a command-line tool as well as a web application. Both
versions are freely available at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/ConservedPrimers/.

Background
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a valuable
marker system with many genetic and genomic applications. For large scale SNP discovery, several strategies have
been developed: (1) comparing sequences of multiple
genotypes in the public databases to identify putative polymorphic sites [1], (2) sequencing random DNA fragments [2-4], (3) re-sequencing [5], and (4) using a target
gene approach [6]. With the target gene approach, primer
pairs are designed on the basis of comparisons of conserved regions (exons) of orthologous genes in related
species [7]. These primers are used to amplify sequences
flanking less conserved regions (such as introns) in a targeted genome. Such gene-specific PCR primer pairs can
help to identify unique loci in virtually any genome. For
comparative gene mapping, such loci are equivalent to
sequence tagged sites (STS) or expressed sequence tags
(EST). Therefore, they have been termed comparative
anchor tagged sequences (CATS) [8]. Since primer pairs
spanning introns are picked from two conserved exon
regions of a gene, they are also called conserved primers
[9], intron-flanking primers [9,10], or exon-primingintron-crossing (EPIC) primers [8,11]. In this paper, the
terms intron-flanking primers and conserved primers are
used interchangeably. The general strategy of intronflanking primer design is to align EST sequences of a targeted species with the genomic sequence of a related species for prediction of intron/exon junctions (splice sites)
and estimation of intron lengths from the reference
genome. The information obtained is used to design
intron-flanking primer pairs for PCR amplification and
sequencing from different exons through intervening
introns and other exons.
The target gene approach for SNP discovery and marker
development is based on three basic assumptions or findings. First, most exons or gene regions are conserved
among related species [12]. Second, intron positions and
approximate intron lengths of a gene are conserved features, even over long evolutionary distance [12-15]. Thus,
the size of an intron between two consecutive exons can
be approximately predicted from genomic sequences of
related species. Third, non-coding regions (introns) of a
gene evolve faster than the coding regions (exons), and
are more diverse and polymorphic than the exons [1618]. Therefore, marker development using a gene
sequence with intron information is more effective. A prerequisite for this approach, satisfied now for many species, is the availability of public databases of a large
number of EST sequences. By the end of 2008, a total of
59,586,036 EST entries for 1,654 species had been generated [19,20]. Most of the economically important species
have large numbers of EST sequences available but lack
information about their genomic sequences and intron/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/331

exon boundaries. Many of these species have a large and
complex genome that cannot be sequenced efficiently and
accurately with the current sequencing techniques. The
target gene approach will be particularly useful for marker
development in those species.
To date, the target gene approach has been used to discover SNPs and assay genetic variations in several species,
such as Rhododendron catawbiense [10] and Medicago truncatula [21] using Arabidopsis as the reference species, and
non-human vertebrates [6,8,11,22] referenced to the
human or mouse genomes. However, these applications
were on a small scale. No suitable high-throughput tool is
available for large-scale conserved primer design. Expeditor [23] is a web-based program for designing conserved
primers using human gene structure and livestock animal
EST information. The major limitations of this program
are its input format of reference sequences, which must be
specifically formatted for the Ensembl ExonView, and limited primer design throughput due to its web implementation. GeMprospector [24,25] is another web-based
pipeline tool for designing cross-species intron-flanking
primers in the legume and grass families. However, this
program requires ESTs of several related species in order to
find conserved regions. For example, the ESTs of rice, sorghum and barley were used in an application in the grass
family. Because the target sequence has to be conserved
among the three species, a limited number of conserved
primers can be designed. Clearly, this tool may not be
suitable for the high-throughput design of conserved
primers on the basis of only two related species.
UniPrime2 [26,27] is the most recently released web tool
for cross-species universal primer design. This tool automatically retrieves and aligns homologous sequences
from GenBank, identifies conserved regions from the
alignments, and generates suitable primers. However,
intron regions are not taken into consideration.
For a wheat SNP project [28], the target gene approach
was adopted to discover genome-specific SNPs. Wheat
(Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42) is an allohexaploid
with the A, B and D genomes. It was formed through
hybridization of three diploid species, Triticum urartu
(AA), Aegilops tauschii (DD), and a wild diploid species
thought to be extinct and closely related to Aegilops
speltoides (SS) [29]. The first step in the SNP discovery
pipeline was to design conserved primers, which was followed by the PCR amplification of gene targets from
wheat diploid and tetraploid ancestors and sequencing of
the amplicons. Genome-specific primers were then
designed on the basis of amplicon sequences and verification with appropriate aneuploid genetic stocks [30]. In
the second step, DNA was amplified with genome-specific
primers and SNPs were discovered in amplicons [7].

To effectively design a large number of conserved primers,
we developed a high-throughput pipeline software tool,
named ConservedPrimers 1.0, in 2003. This tool has been
further improved for general use and used in several
projects for SNP discovery and genetic variation studies.
In this paper, we describe the development and characteristics of ConservedPrimers 2.0 as a generalized pipeline
and illustrate its utility in wheat SNP discovery.

Intron-flanking Primer Design Pipeline and its
Implementation
The pipeline and its command-line tool
The pipeline (Figure 1) consists of three steps:
Step 1: sequence alignment and intron/exon junction analysis
At this step, non-redundant ESTs of a target genome are
aligned to a genomic sequence of a related species (reference genome), such as rice, Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, or
human. Hereafter the term "EST" represents a singleton
EST as well as an assembled EST contig which is a gene
transcript assembled from a set of ESTs that appear to
come from the same or closely related orthologous and
paralogous genes. The use of non-redundant ESTs is
strongly recommended for two reasons; i.e., to avoid
duplicate primer pairs being designed for the same locus,
and to facilitate identification of primers that would recognize paralogous genes. The unique EST contig
sequences of a large number of species can be downloaded from the NCBI UniGene database [31] and the
TIGR plant transcript assemblies database [32]. Alignments are performed with the BLASTN program (NCBI
Blast 2.0) [33] to determine the existence of a colinear
"exon block" between an EST and the reference genome.
A colinear exon block is an intragenic linear alignment of
exons along a reference genome that has at least two consecutive exon matches in the reference genome (Figure
2A). Each block must start and end with an exon and have
one or more introns of less than 1.5 Kb in length. We
restrict the intron length to no more than 1.5 Kb to make
PCR amplification and sequencing more efficient. If an
intron is longer than 1.5 Kb, the alignment should be split
into two smaller colinear exon blocks if possible (Figure
2B). A single candidate primer pair should be generated
from each colinear exon block, and only a single primer
pair should be chosen for each gene locus. If the same
region of an EST sequence has two or more colinear exon
blocks detected in more than one location in the reference
genome, these colinear exon blocks are considered to be
non-unique (Figure 2C) and will be eliminated from further consideration. The non-unique colinear exon blocks
are probably due to paralogous genes within gene families
(paralogs). Paralogs originate by gene duplications either
prior to speciation (outparalogs) or after speciation
(inparalogs) [34]. The purpose of this step is to find a
unique colinear exon block for each EST.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/331

In order to identify colinear exon blocks and predict
intron lengths from alignments of each EST sequence,
BLASTN reports are further parsed and analyzed. First, one
should thoroughly search for matches (alignment of an
exon in an EST with the reference genome sequence) with
expect values â¤ a user specified cutoff (e.g. 1e-10) and then
identify colinear exon blocks. ESTs with non-unique
colinear exon blocks are eliminated to avoid paralogous
genes. ESTs with a single exon match from the BLASTN
alignments will also be excluded. The length of each exon
and intron will be calculated, and their coordinates determined. Finally, a new sequence string will be recorded for
each EST that has a unique colinear exon block. In the
sequence string, the intron sequences from the reference
genome are inserted between two consecutive exons with
intron sequences replaced by "Ns" (e.g., "....GATCGGTTTACN....NGGTTCAATT....") - these N-marked sequences
will be used to design conserved primers.
Using the N-marked sequences instead of the original EST
sequences has several advantages. First, primer pairs can
be more easily designed from the exons. In addition, the
size of a PCR product and the number and length of
introns and exons in the amplified PCR product can be
estimated. Finally, in the primer analysis step (Step 3),
one can check whether the designed primer pairs come
from different exons or from the same exon. This process
has been implemented in a Java program named "IntronExonAnalysis.jar". The entire process has been implemented in a Perl script "est_alignment.pl". This script
takes two files as inputs: a FASTA file of ESTs (e.g. wheat)
and a FASTA file of reference genome sequences (e.g. rice).
The script first calls the formatdb program to make a
BLAST database for the reference genome and then calls
the blastall program (NCBI blast 2.0) [33] to perform
alignments (BLASTN searches). The Java program "IntronExonAnalysis.jar" is used to parse and annotate the alignment results. This script generates two files: an intronmarked sequence file for primer design and an alignment
summary file for primer analysis.
Among all of the parameters that are set in the BLASTN
search, the most important parameter is the expect value
(or E-value). The selection of E-value relies on the evolutionary distance between the target species and genomic
reference species. For closely related species, a more stringent (smaller) value may be required. The pipeline uses
1e-10 as the default.
Step 2: Batch primer design
Within this step, primers will be batch-designed using a
Perl script (pick_primers.pl). This script takes the intronmarked sequence file exported from Step 2 as input and
calls the Primer3 core program [35]. Alternatively, the
BatchPrimer3 web software [9] can be used to design

primers. However, some of the primer-designing parameters need to be set before running the software. The default
primer-designing parameters used in the pipeline are as
follows: primer length of 18 to 25 bases with the optimum 20 bases, Tm of 55 to 65Â°C with the optimum 60Â°C,
GC content of 20% to 80%, and an 800-base optimum

product size with a range from 400 to 1,500 bases. Usually
only one primer pair is picked for each EST. Two or more
primer pair candidates may be obtained if multiple
unique colinear exon blocks are found in an EST. A tabdelimited primer table file is subsequently generated from
this script or from the BatchPrimer3 web software [9].

Step 3: Primer analysis
To increase the success rate in PCR amplification with the
primers and polymorphism discovery rate, the designed
primers should be unique and span at least one intron. A
Perl script (primer_analysis.pl) has been implemented to
analyze the designed primer pairs. This script takes several
files exported from Step 1 and Step 2 and performs two
major tasks. First, all designed primers are compared with
all of non-redundant ESTs or other user-specified nonredundant EST databases with the BLASTN program to
exclude the primer pairs with more than one hit. This step
reduces failed PCR amplifications and avoids amplifying
duplicate genes. The primer pairs picked from the same

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/331

exon regions are also removed, since no intron can be
amplified if a primer pair comes from the same exon
region. Such primer pairs are removed since exon
sequences are expected to have fewer polymorphisms.
Information about the alignments and PCR primers from
Step 1 and Step 2, such as the number of matched exons,
coordinates of the exons in sequences, match scores of
each exon, the numbers and lengths of introns and exons
included in the amplified product, is combined in a final
table of primers for primer selection and ordering.
These three steps can be done separately. However, for
ease of use we have integrated them into a simple, auto-

only takes two sequence files as inputs (Figure 1B). All
executables and source code of the pipeline and a user's
guide are available for public use [36] [see Additional file
1].
Web implementation of the pipeline
To assist users who need to design a small number of
primers at a time, the web version of ConservedPrimers
2.0 pipeline has been implemented. A similar interface
and implementations with BatchPrimer3 [9] were applied
to provide users with target EST sequence input, reference
sequence selection, and flexible parameter settings for
BLAST search and primer design (Figure 3). Genome
sequences of eight plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana [37],

Oryza sativa (rice) [38], Sorghum bicolor (sorghum)
[12,39], Brachypodium distachyon [40], Glycine max (soybean) [41], Medicago truncatula [42], Vitis vinifera (grapevine) [43] and Populus trichocarpa (poplar) [44], are
currently available as reference sequences. More reference
genome sequences can be easily embedded into the web
application if needed. As in BatchPrimer3 [9], target gene
(or EST) sequences can be input by either a copy-andpaste to the sequence text box (Figure 3) or uploading a
sequence file. The sequences must be in FASTA format.
Unlike BatchPrimer3, sequences masking with "{}", "<>"
or "[]" pairs to represent including, excluding or target
regions are not allowed in the sequence input. All unrecognized characters in the sequences are automatically
removed. In order to balance the workload on the server,

a limit of 200 sequences is set on the web application. For
a larger number of EST sequences, the command-line
based pipeline is recommended.

Intragenic colinear exon blocks between wheat ESTs and

The command-line based pipeline was used to analyze
wheat EST data. A total of 6,045 wheat ESTs (including
contigs and singletons) [46] that had been mapped in
wheat deletion bins were compared using the BLASTN
program (NCBI blast 2.0) against the rice genome (IRGSP
pseudomolecules Build04 [38]) at the expect value < 1e-10.
A total of 4,003 ESTs (66.2%) were matched to the rice
genome. Out of the 4,003 ESTs, 1,922 (58.0%) had
unique colinear exon blocks, 794 (19.8%) had nonunique colinear exon blocks, and 1,287 (32.2%) had only
one exon matched. The ESTs with unique colinear exon
blocks were included in the pipeline for designing conserved primers.

exon blocks were normally distributed with a mean of
88.8 Â± 3.7% (Figure 4A). The alignment length or the exon
length and the predicted intron length had a skewed distribution with averages of 137.2 Â± 96.2 bp and 354.7 Â±
341.9 bp, respectively (Figure 4B and 4C). The average
number of introns in unique colinear exon blocks was 2.5
Â± 2.1 (ranging from 1 to 15).
Intron-flanking primer design, PCR amplification and SNP
discovery
After removing the ESTs that had no colinear exon blocks
or had non-unique colinear exon blocks, a total of 1,922
ESTs which yielded 1,975 N-marked sequences were carried forward in the pipeline for primer design. From 1,870
EST loci, 1,946 conserved primer pairs were generated
with a 97% success rate for primer design. The failure in
primer design for some ESTs was primarily because their
N-marked sequences were too short to meet the minimum PCR product size requirement. Since the intron
length was restricted to 1.5 Kb, longer colinear exon alignments were split into two or more shorter colinear exon
blocks, and one N-marked sequence for each of the
shorter blocks was generated for primer design. Fifty-two
wheat ESTs were found to have multiple colinear exon
blocks. The primers were manually screened to determine
how many were derived from single- or low-copy genes in
wheat. A total of 1,821 such primer pairs were used for
PCR amplification and amplicon sequencing of six wheat
diploid ancestors and one tetraploid wheat in a cooperative effort from seven different laboratories [47]. For
example, of the 155 conserved primer pairs used for SNP
discovery in wheat chromosome 1A, 1B and 1D, 145
(93.5%) produced amplicons that resulted in successful
sequencing of wheat diploid ancestors and discovery of
polymorphisms in at least one of the three wheat
genomes.

Wheat intron lengths were correlated significantly (r2 =
0.45, p < 0.0001) with the predicted intron lengths from
the rice genome (Figure 5B). The same linear correlation
was also observed between the actual PCR product sizes
and their predicted sizes (r2 = 0.33, p < 0.0001) (Figure
5A). Despite a larger genome size, the average wheat gene
intron lengths were smaller (259.8 bp) than those of rice
(354.7 bp) (Figure 4B). Similar results were also observed
between Gossypium, Arabidopsis, and rice [14]. Gossypium
has a genome larger than Arabidopsis and rice, but the Gossypium introns are generally smaller (149.5 bp). The difference in intron lengths between wheat and rice was
small enough to allow using rice to predict wheat intron
lengths in the 200 to 1,500 bp range.
Sequences of amplicons produced with the 1,821 conserved primers were used to design genome-specific prim-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/331

ers for amplifying and sequencing the target DNA
sequences from a single genome of hexaploid wheat. A
total of 1,527 loci containing one or more genome-specific SNPs were discovered. In the previously mentioned
145 loci that had been mapped to wheat chromosomes
1A, 1B and 1D, a total of 114 loci (78.6%) were found to
have at least one genome-specific SNP. Among them, 73
loci were located in the A genome, 64 loci in the B genome
and 82 loci in the D genome.
Running time of the ConservedPrimers pipeline
The three-step pipeline sequentially uses three separate
command-line Perl scripts together with one Java program for intron/exon junction analysis, the NCBI Blast 2.0
software [33] for alignments, the Primer3 core program
[35] or BatchPrimer3 [9], and three Perl packages for
primer design (Figure 1B). A user can run scripts step by
step, or run the single pipeline program,
primer_design_pipeline.pl, which integrates all of the
three steps into one script. The performance is primarily
related to genome size of reference species, the number of
ESTs, and the speed of the computer. For instance, 6,045
wheat ESTs and the rice genome were used for conserved
primer design. The size of the rice genome (IRGSP pseudomolecules Build04) is 382 Mb. It took a desktop computer (Asus P6T, Intel core i7 920, 12 GB of RAM, and a
Ubuntu Linux 9.04 64 bit operating system) a total of 9.10
minutes for running the entire pipeline and 8.46, 0.47
and 0.17 minutes for Step 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A
majority of running time (93%) was taken by Step 1 to
perform BLASTN searches and intron/exon analysis. The
web version of the ConservedPrimers pipeline will take
more time than the command-based pipeline since the
sequences are loaded to the server before processing. Client internet speed will also affect sequence loading. Therefore performance of the web application may vary among
different users. A random sample of 200 sequences chosen from 6,045 wheat ESTs were used for testing the web
application through intranet set-up. A total of 25 seconds
were needed to finish the entire pipeline.

Discussion
Intragenic colinear exon blocks and intron-flanking primer
design
A basic prerequisite has to be satisfied for designing
intron-flanking primers: both the positions and the
lengths of the exon and the intron must be relatively conserved between the target genome and the reference
genome, i.e., a colinear exon block must be identified in
an EST locus. Extensive colinear exon blocks within genes
were observed between wheat and rice. Since wheat and
barley are more closely related to Brachypodium than to
rice [48,49], Brachypodium may be a better reference species for comparative genomic researches than rice.

Intron length variation has been investigated in animals,
plants (including rice, sorghum and maize) and fungi [1215,50]. Although intron lengths in orthologous genes vary
among species, the positions and approximate lengths of
introns tend to be conserved [12,13,15,50]. Since intron
lengths were significantly correlated between rice and
wheat, the wheat intron lengths can be approximately predicted from the rice introns for the purpose of designing
intron-flanking primers.
ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline
The ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline is a high throughput
software tool for designing intron-flanking primers, and is
usable with two evolutionarily related species. The primary requirement is the availability of abundant unique
ESTs for the target species and an evolutionarily related
model or reference species with a fully sequenced
genome. Depending on their evolutionary distance, a different E-value cutoff should be used in a BLASTN search
of colinear exon blocks. For two closely related species,
such as wheat, barley, sorghum, maize or sugarcane referenced to rice or Brachypodium, a more stringent E-value
cutoff, such as 1e-10, should be used. Otherwise, a less
stringent E-value cutoff would be more suitable. For
example, Rhododendron is phylogenetically distant from
Arabidopsis, and 1e-4 was used in the BLAST search against
Arabidopsis genomic sequences [10]. The more stringent
the E-value cutoff, the fewer colinear exon blocks are identified. This results in fewer, but higher-quality, intronflanking primer pairs being selected. Besides the E-value,
all parameters for primer design also can be easily
changed within the Perl script, pick_primers.pl.

The ConservedPrimer 2.0 pipeline has been implemented
as a command-line tool as well as a web application. The
command line style makes it possible to design intronflanking primer pairs or marker candidates for polymorphism discovery in a high-throughput manner and to use
any genome size of the model species and any number of
the ESTs as inputs without memory and speed restrictions.
The web-based pipeline serves as a convenient and easyto-use tool for primer design of a small number of ESTs.
Compared to the web-based system, a novice user may
need some basic computer skills for initial set-up and running the command line programs.

Conclusion
The ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline for designing intronflanking primers was developed and its utility demonstrated. The tool can be used for SNP discovery, genetic
variation assays and marker development for any target
genome that has abundant ESTs and an evolutionarily
related reference genome that has been fully sequenced.
The ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline has been implemented as a command-line tool as well as a web applica-
