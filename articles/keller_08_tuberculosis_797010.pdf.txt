Abstract
Background: The current tuberculosis vaccine is a live vaccine derived from Mycobacterium bovis
and attenuated by serial in vitro passaging. All vaccine substrains in use stem from one source, strain
Bacille Calmette-Guérin. However, they differ in regions of genomic deletions, antigen expression
levels, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy.
Results: As a RecA phenotype increases genetic stability and may contribute restricting the
ongoing evolution of the various BCG substrains while maintaining their protective efficacy, we
aimed to inactivate recA by allelic replacement in BCG vaccine strains representing different
phylogenetic lineages (Pasteur, Frappier, Denmark, Russia). Homologous gene replacement was
achieved successfully in three out of four strains. However, only illegitimate recombination was
observed in BCG substrain Russia. Sequence analyses of recA revealed that a single nucleotide
insertion in the 5' part of recA led to a translational frameshift with an early stop codon making BCG
Russia a natural recA mutant. At the protein level BCG Russia failed to express RecA.
Conclusion: According to phylogenetic analyses BCG Russia is an ancient vaccine strain most
closely related to the parental M. bovis. We hypothesize that recA inactivation in BCG Russia
occurred early and is in part responsible for its high degree of genomic stability, resulting in a
substrain that has less genetic alterations than other vaccine substrains with respect to M. bovis
AF2122/97 wild-type.

Background
Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of enormous global
importance. It is estimated that about one third of the
human population is latently infected with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis with 1.6 million people dying annually from
the disease [1]. The currently employed tuberculosis vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)
was originally derived from a virulent strain of M. bovis
back to 1921, by repeated passages on potato slices
soaked in glycerol-ox byle. The primary attenuation is

attributed to loss of RD1 locus, which affects a protein
secretion pathway [2-5]. Subsequent propagation of BCG
in several laboratories around the world resulted in further in vitro evolution, which is still ongoing. Genetic
alterations are mainly due to deletions and duplications
[6], although single nucleotide polymorphisms (e.g. in
mmaA3 and sigK) have also been described [7,8]. The various genetic alterations – some presumably involving
RecA-mediated recombination – affect the antigenic, protective, and metabolic properties of BCG. Thus, the term

BCG does not refer to an entity but comprises a set of different substrains. Since the early sixties, freeze dried and
lyophilized secondary seed lots are used as source of commercially available vaccine strains. WHO vaccine production guidelines [9] call for fresh cultures from secondary
seed lots and propose not to exceed twelve passages from
the primary seed lot. These recommendations have been
modified recently, suggesting not to exceed four passages
as phenotypic alterations were observed in vaccine
batches undergoing as little as twelve subcultivations [10].

clones arising from homologous recombination events
readily resulted in recA deletion mutants as demonstrated
by Southern blot analyses. In striking contrast, all transformants (16/16 analyzed) of substrain Russia resulted
from illegitimate recombination (Table 1 and Figure 1B).
Southern blot analysis shows a virtually at random integration of the suicide knock-out plasmid containing the
inactivated recA in substrain Russia. The presence of a 1.9kb fragment corresponding to the original recA and the
presence of a second fragment of varying size indicates
non-homologous illegitimate recombination.

Results
Generation of recA knock-out strains
To establish BCG as a vector for stable heterologous antigen expression we intended to stabilize the genome of
four BCG substrains representing different phylogenetic
lineages by deletion of recA. A recA phenotype is desirable
for live mycobacterial vaccines as homologous recombination is an important contributor of genomic evolution
[11,12]. We constructed a replacement vector (Additional
file 1) carrying an unmarked, inactive deletion of the recA
allele. In this vector, a hygromycin resistance cassette and
the counterselectable marker sacB were cloned downstream of the recA allele. Transformation of this kind of
vector allows generation of allelic replacement mutants by
two subsequent selection steps. In a first step, transformants that have integrated the knock-out plasmid into the
bacterial chromosome are selected on hygromycin B containing media. Integration of the vector by homologous
recombination, i. e. 3' or 5' of the genomic recA, is
revealed by Southern blot analyses. In a second step,
sucrose-selection is used to select for mutants that have
undergone a second intramolecular recombination resulting either in inactivation of the recA gene or in reversion
to wild-type.

Most of the transformants obtained in substrains Pasteur,
Frappier, and Denmark resulted from homologous integration of the targeting vector (3'or 5') at the recA locus
(Table 1 and Figure 1A). Subsequent counter-selection of

Genomic recA sequence
The absence of marker integration by homologous recombination prompted us to examine the genomic recA
sequence in BCG Russia in comparison to the annotated
sequence of BCG Pasteur 1173P2 [6]. We found a single
insertional mutation 413 bp from the recA start (Figure 2),
which leads to a translational frameshift and a premature
stop codon at amino acid position 140 in the major central RecA domain (residues 31–269). The truncated RecA
has a length of 139 instead of 790 amino acids and lacks
the complete C-terminal part of the protein including
loops L1 (residues 156–165) and L2 (195–210) implicated in DNA binding [13]. BCG Frappier, Denmark, and
Pasteur recA were identical with the annotated reference
sequence encoding a functional RecA.
RecA expression at the protein level
Bacteria respond to DNA-damage by coordinated expression of a multitude of genes involved in repair and control
of cell division – the SOS response [14]. The SOS response
was induced by addition of the DNA-damaging agent
mitomycin C (0.2 μg mL-1) to a BCG culture, followed by
incubation for an additional 24 hours [15]. Western blot
analysis using a polyclonal mouse α-RecA antibody demonstrated induction of RecA in strain BCG Pasteur, but
absence and failure of induction of RecA in BCG Russia
(Figure 3). A genetically engineered BCG Pasteur recA
mutant (this study) was used as a negative control.

Discussion
Replication errors, transpositions and recombination
events contribute to genetic alterations and drive genome

evolution. For BCG various differences in morphology,
growth rate, protein expression and genetic make-up have
been noted among commercially available substrains

[16]. This is presumably a result of the numerous serial
passages on natural (potato slices trenched in ox bile) and
artificial media, which have led to the acquisition of
genomic alterations and further attenuation. Of note,
meta-analyses of BCG vaccination trials have indicated
protective efficacies ranging from 0–80%. A correlation
between the number of serial in vitro passages and the
decrease in protective efficacy has been observed [17].
Several reasons have been put forward to explain the varying protective efficacies of BCG, among others genetic
differences between vaccine substrains as well as within
an individual substrain [18]. More recently it has been
suggested that the protective efficacy of ancient vaccine
strains charcterized by few regions of difference (Figure 4)
may be superior to that of the later ones that are more
widely used [6]. We have added the newly identified single nucleotide polymorphism to an existent phylogenetic
tree. It will be of interest to see whether recA is functional
in other ancient strains (e.g. BCG Moreau or Japan).
Sequencing of recA may also help to clarifiy the uncertain
origin of the two subcultures of BCG Japan [6].
The RecA-family recombinases have a central role in DNA
repair, restoration of stalled replication forks, induction of
SOS response, mutagenesis and homologous recombination [19]. In E. coli, RecA is involved in several homolo-

gous recombination pathways, where it promotes the
central steps, i.e. aligning and pairing two DNA molecules, and then promoting a strand switch followed by
branch migration [19]. RecA is both ubiquitous and
highly conserved among a range of organisms, but variations of the prototypic E. coli paradigm exist. recA of pathogenic mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis complex, M. leprae)
but not of non-pathogenic mycobacteria (e.g. M. smegmatis) is interrupted by an in-frame open reading frame
encoding an intein [20]. RecA intein is removed from the
precursor RecA by an autocatalytic protein splicing reaction and active RecA, which can complement a M. smegmatis recA mutant [21,22] is generated by ligation of
amino- and carboxy terminal fragments mediated by
intein. M. tuberculosis RecA activity differs from E. coli
RecA activity with respect to single strand DNA-dependent
ATP-hydrolysis, co-factor requirement and pH-optimum
[23]. Homologous recombination in M. tuberculosis complex is sometimes masked by a high degree of illegitimate
recombination in certain experiments [24]. The high
degree of illegitimate recombination has been attributed
to the unusual structure of recA [25]. Alternatively, the
high degree of illegitimate recombination may be due to
the absence of a mismatch repair system [26], which has
anti-recombination activity [27]. However, homologous
recombination essentially depends on recA as demon-

strated in a gene conversion assay in a M. bovis BCG recA
mutant [28]. Of note a homologue of E. coli RecT, a protein functionally overlapping RecA, is missing in M. tuberculosis [29]. Likewise, other recombination genes are also
absent from the M. tuberculosis genome (e.g. recE, recJ)
[26].

lar loci remain obscure and subsequent alterations may
mask initial events, e.g. tandem duplication of the DU2
region in M. bovis BCG Pasteur arose from duplication of
a 100 kb genomic segment that subsequently incurred an
internal deletion of 64 kb [18].

Conclusion
Comparative genomics indicate that recombination
events are a major driving force of bacterial evolution
[12]. There is extensive evidence for large-scale rearrangements, duplications and deletions resulting from homologous recombination in M. leprae [30], M. tuberculosis [31]
and M. bovis BCG [6]. Half of the proteins present in the
tubercle bacillus originate from gene duplications [32].
Tandem duplications are generally caused by unequal
crossover between homologous sequences or by recombination of short DNA homologies. Homologous recombination between similar sequences may invert or delete
genes. Several deletions in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv
genome resulted from recombination between adjacent
repeats of IS6110 elements [31,33]. Sometimes, the
molecular mechanisms underlying alterations at particu-

Comparative genome and transcriptome analyses indicate
that BCG Russia is an ancient BCG strain most closely
related to the original strain attenuated by Calmette and
Guérin [6]. However, a key piece of the puzzle was missing. What was the molecular mechanism underlying the
high degree of genome conservation in BCG Russia? Here,
analysis of the recA locus provides a possible clue. RecA,
which is the key element of homologous recombination
and a driving force in mycobacterial genome evolution
but which is not mandatory for conferring protection of
BCG in animal models of tuberculosis [11], is disrupted
by single nucleotide insertion in BCG Russia. This mutation results in a frameshift and premature translational
stop and most probably contributed to the genome stability of this substrain of BCG. Of note genome stability of

the obligate endosymbionts of aphids, Buchnera aphidicola, is also associated with lack of recA [12].

Methods
Bacterial strains
Escherichia coli DH5α was obtained from Pharmacia (GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and was used for plasmid
propagation. M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P2 was obtained
from the strain collection of the Institute Pasteur, Paris,
France (strain #CIP105050). M. bovis BCG Denmark
(1331) was obtained in the form of a vaccine production
lot through the Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen,
Denmark. M. bovis BCG Frappier (Montreal, ATCC
#35735) primary lot, dated 1973, lot number 1376141,

was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), Rockville, MD, USA. The Frappier strain held by
ATCC was initially transferred from the Institut Pasteur to
Frappier's Institute in Montreal in 1937, was integrated in
the Trudeau Mycobacterial Culture Collection and finally
went to the ATCC. A vaccine production lot 547–1104 K.
1491 of M.bovis BCG Russia (corresponding to ATCC
#35740) was obtained through Medgamal Inc. (TD Allergen, Moscow, Russia). This was the first documented
daughter strain distributed by Institut Pasteur in 1924
[34] going directly to Russia. It is referred as an 'early
strain' with regards to its genetic characteristics (regions of
difference, insertional elements, antigen expression pattern).

The identity of the BCG substrains was confirmed using
morphological features (roughling, generation time), PCR
amplification and sequencing of described regions of difference as described by [35].
Media, transformation and DNA damage induction. The
media for growing E. coli DH5α, and substrains of Mycobacterium bovis BCG have been described previously [22].
M. bovis BCG substrains were revitalised by addition of 1
mL Middlebrook 7H9 medium to a lyophilized batch. For
DNA damage induction experiments M. bovis BCG was
grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium with addition of
10% (vol/vol) OADC in motionless tissue culture flasks in
a 37°C incubator. Published protocols were followed for
the preparation of electrocompetent cells of mycobacteria
and for electroporation [22]. The recA mutants of BCG
Pasteur, Denmark and Frappier were generated by allelic
replacement using a suicide knock-out vector.
To induce DNA damage, mitomycin C (0.2 μg ml-1) was
added to 20 mL of growing cultures (at an OD600 of 0.6)
and incubated for 24 h. Thereafter, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and prepared for cell lysis.
Construction of recA knock-out plasmid
Suicide vector pGEM7-recA::3xstop-hyg-aph was generated
as follows. A 5.2-kb ApaI fragment from plasmid pEJ126
[36] containing the M. tuberculosis recA gene was subcloned into the PstI site of plasmid pBluescript-KSII(-)
after blunting of both fragments with T4 DNA polymerase, resulting in plasmid pBluescript-recA. From this vector a 1.3-kb internal PstI fragment (recA bps 504–1758,
corresponding to protein residues 169–586) was replaced
by a 22-mer triple translation stop insert with an internal
MunI restriction site and PstI overhanging ends (Additional file 1). This 22-mer was generated by annealing of
dimeric oligonucleotide primers with 5'-phosphorylated
ends. Briefly, two complementary 5'-phosphorylated oligonucleotides (Microsynth, Belgach, Switzerland) were
mixed in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 50
mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA) at equal volumes (resulting in a
final concentration of 5 μM per oligonucleotide). The
mixture was heated to 96°C for 5 minutes and cooled
down to 25°C over a period of 8 hours. The annealing
product was diluted 1:10 and used for ligation to result in
plasmid pBluescript-recA::3xstop.

An hsp60-sacB construct in form of an EcoRV/BamHI fragment from plasmid pLO2 [37] was ligated to the BamHI/
EcoRI site of pMV361 [38] to result in pMV361-hsp60sacB, wherefrom an XbaI/XhoI fragment was ligated in the
XbaI/SacI site of pBluescript-IIKS(-) (Strategene, La Jolla,
CA, USA), to result in pBluescript-IIKS-hsp60-sacB. The
later plasmid was digested with ApaI and NheI and a 2514bp fragment ligated into pGEM7-Zf(+) (Promega, Madi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/120

son, WI, USA) digested with XbaI and ApaI, thereby excising 17 bps from the multiple cloning site to result in
pGEM7-hsp60-sacB (5494 bps), expressing sacB under the
control of the mycobacterial hsp60 promoter. A 1.3-kbp
aph cassette isolated as a PstI fragment from plasmid
pUC4K (Pharmacia) was ligated into the NsiI restriction
site of pGEM7-hsp60-sacB to result in pGEM7-hsp60-sacBaph. Then we introduced a 1.3-kb hyg fragment (cut with
Bpu1102I and Van91I, treated with T4 DNA polymerase to
create blunt ends) encoding the hygromycin B resistance
cassette into pGEM7-hsp60-sacB-aph (cut with SacI and
treated with T4 DNA polymerase). The resulting plasmid
pGEM7-hsp60-sacB-aph-hyg was cut with EcoRV and SpeI.
We subsequently introduced a 4-kb recA::3xstop fragment
from pBluescript-recA::3xstop (cut with EcoRV and SpeI),
the resulting suicide vector pGEM7-recA::3xstop-hsp60sacB-hyg-aph was used for transformation of BCG strains.
DNA isolation, sequencing and alignment
DNA was extracted from BCG colonies grown on 7H10.
The recA gene was amplified from genomic DNA (10 ng)
by Pfu DNA polymerase using primers #1 and #2. The
product was cleaned via gel purification and sequenced
using primers #1 to #9 (Additional file 2) using an ABI
PRISM 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Forster
City, CA, USA). The sequences were aligned using Lasergene (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA) SeqMan (version 6).
The aligned sequence was compared via BLAST software
to the recA sequence of M. bovis BCG substrain Pasteur
1173P2 [6]. Standard techniques were applied for Southern blot analysis. Approximately 500 ng of genomic DNA
was digested with SmaI and hybridized to a recA probe.
Preparation of cell-free extracts
Untreated and mitomycin-C-treated bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS buffer (pH 7.2)
and resuspended in 300 μL PBS containing 0.5% protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Bacteria were lysed in screwcap tubes in a water immersion (ice-chilled) sonicator
(Elma, Singen, Germany), using maximum duty-cycle
during 1 h 20 min with a cooling interval every 20 min.
The crude lysate was clarified by spinning at 1 000 × g during 10 min.
Western blotting
Cell-free extracts corresponding to 50 μg total protein
(quantification via Bradford assay) were used for Western
blot analyses. Following SDS-PAGE in a 13.3% polyacrylamide gel, proteins were blotted to a PVDF membrane
using a semi-dry blotter (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) at
constant current (0.3 A) for 30 min. Equal loading of proteins was confirmed by Coomassie staining, and by blotting with antibodies against the constitutively expressed
mycobacterial protein KatG using a polyclonal mouse αKatG antibody (1:2500). Detection of RecA was carried
