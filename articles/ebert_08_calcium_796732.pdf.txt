Abstract
Background: Cardiomyocyte contraction is initiated by influx of extracellular calcium through
voltage-gated calcium channels. These oligomeric channels utilize auxiliary β subunits to chaperone
the pore-forming α subunit to the plasma membrane, and to modulate channel electrophysiology
[1]. Several β subunit family members are detected by RT-PCR in the embryonic heart. Null
mutations in mouse β2, but not in the other three β family members, are embryonic lethal at E10.5
due to defects in cardiac contractility [2]. However, a drawback of the mouse model is that
embryonic heart rhythm is difficult to study in live embryos due to their intra-uterine development.
Moreover, phenotypes may be obscured by secondary effects of hypoxia. As a first step towards
developing a model for contributions of β subunits to the onset of embryonic heart rhythm, we
characterized the structure and expression of β2 subunits in zebrafish and other teleosts.
Results: Cloning of two zebrafish β2 subunit genes (β2.1 and β2.2) indicated they are membraneassociated guanylate kinase (MAGUK)-family genes. Zebrafish β2 genes show high conservation
with mammals within the SH3 and guanylate kinase domains that comprise the "core" of MAGUK
proteins, but β2.2 is much more divergent in sequence than β2.1. Alternative splicing occurs at the
N-terminus and within the internal HOOK domain. In both β2 genes, alternative short ATGcontaining first exons are separated by some of the largest introns in the genome, suggesting that
individual transcript variants could be subject to independent cis-regulatory control. In the
Tetraodon nigrovidis and Fugu rubripes genomes, we identified single β2 subunit gene loci.
Comparative analysis of the teleost and human β2 loci indicates that the short 5' exon sequences
are highly conserved. A subset of 5' exons appear to be unique to teleost genomes, while others
are shared with mammals. Alternative splicing is temporally and spatially regulated in embryo and
adult. Moreover, a different subset of spliced β2 transcript variants is detected in the embryonic
heart compared to the adult.
Conclusion: These studies refine our understanding of β2 subunit diversity arising from
alternative splicing, and provide the groundwork for functional analysis of β2 subunit diversity in
the embryonic heart.

Background
Voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (V-LTCC) are
essential for the initiation and regulation of excitationcontraction coupling in cardiac muscle. In addition, Ca2+
entry through V-LTCC channels can also serve as a second
messenger to modulate regulatory protein kinases, calmodulin and beta-adrenergic responses [3]. Genetic
mutation of key Ca2+ homeostasis proteins is frequently
associated with defects in both cardiac cell differentiation
and contractility, suggesting Ca2+ signaling is essential for
normal cardiac development [4-7]. Ca2+ signals can also
contribute to the control of gene expression [8]. Ca2+
influx through V-LTCC can dramatically affect the phosphorylation, activity, or expression of many genes [5,810]. These data support the hypothesis that Ca2+ signaling
through V-LTCC impacts not only cardiac contraction but
also embryonic cardiac growth and morphology, physiology, and gene expression.
V-LTCCs are oligomeric proteins composed of a poreforming α1 subunit and up to four auxiliary subunits,
termed α2, β, γ, and δ, associated in a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry [11,12]. Mammals encode 10 distinct α1 subunit
genes (four of which form V-LTCC) and four distinct β
subunit genes (β1 – β4). Particular α1 and β subtypes are
able to associate non-exclusively to form heterogeneous
channels [13-17]. V-LTCC that contain the α1c subunit
(Cav1.2) constitute the vast majority of L-type channels
expressed in adult cardiac muscle [17-22].
The V-LTCC β subunit genes have important functions in
cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, the central nervous
system and the retina [2,23-28]. β subunits modulate Ca2+
channel function in two distinct ways. First, they facilitate
transport of the α1 to the plasmalemma. In addition, they
interact with α1 to modulate both the kinetics and voltage-sensitivity of the channels [29-31]. As members of the
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family,
the V-LTCC β subunit genes include conserved SH3 and
guanylate kinase (GK) domains connected by a bridging
region termed the HOOK domain [32]. The larger
MAGUK protein family appears to be specific to metazoans, and its core structure, including the SH3 and GK
domains, can be traced back to early metazoan history
[33]. All known β genes undergo alternative splicing of 5'
exons, and some exhibit alternative splicing of internal
exons as well [34-36]. Alternative splicing in internal
exons can create truncated proteins, some of which have
been shown to mediate calcium channel-independent
functions in the cell [1,36,37].
In the mouse, the earliest documented expression of a cardiac β protein is a Western blot showing β2 protein in the
linear heart tube (E8.5) [2]. By E9.5 (chamber morphogenesis stages), β4 and β2 mRNA and protein are clearly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/38

present in the embryonic myocardium [2,10,38]. β2 and
β4 proteins show detectable differences in spatial distribution as early as E9.5, which become more pronounced in
mid- to late embryogenesis (E10.5 – E15.5) and in later
fetal development [38]. In rat postnatal development (4.5
weeks), RT-PCR studies indicate all four β subunits are
expressed in cardiac tissue, though they differ in abundance [39]. Significantly, by 4.5 weeks RNA from atria and
ventricles show different β subunit RT-PCR expression
profiles [39]. In brain and heart, newborn and juvenile
animals express different subsets of β genes (including different transcript variants) than the adult [39,40]. The
physiological significance of these observations is not
known. However, a recent report describing the targeted
mutagenesis of mouse β2 indicated that homozygous loss
of this gene (β2-/-) is embryonic lethal at E10.5, significantly earlier than the α1C-deficient mouse [2,19]. No upregulation of other β subunits was observed in β2-/mutants. In β2-/- mutant mice, cardiac contractility is
severely compromised and V-LTCC currents diminished.
Hearts in mutant mice exhibit severe bradycardia and vascular patterning defects, but these phenotypes may be secondary to severe morphological defects that develop in
the heart or to the overall reduced embryonic growth [2].
In contrast to β2, mice with null mutations in β1, β3 and
β4 have no reported cardiac phenotypes [23,25-28]. However, the zebrafish β1-/- mutant relaxed develops pericardial edema and reduced circulation at 4 dpf (days postfertilization), suggesting a possible compromise in cardiac
function [41]. Thus, while multiple β subunits are clearly
present in the embryonic heart, much remains to be
learned about their functional roles in development.
As a model for the study of β subunit developmental function in the heart, zebrafish has several advantages, including the external fertilization of embryos and rapid,
transparent development of the larvae, which allows
experimental access to the developing heart and circulatory system. Moreover, for about the first 6 days of development the small zebrafish larvae subsist on oxygen
acquired via diffusion, enabling them to survive without a
functional heart [42]. As a first step in establishing a
zebrafish model, we cloned two β2 subunit gene
homologs from zebrafish. We find one β2 subunit is
much more similar than the other to known vertebrate β2
subunits. Significant alternative splicing occurs involving
several ATG-containing first exons in both zebrafish
genes, as well as two other teleost species. The separation
of these short exons by extremely large introns suggests
potential independent cis-regulatory control of alternatively spliced transcripts. Unexpectedly, both β2 subunits
were maternally expressed, consistent with possible early
roles for this gene in morphogenetic movements or patterning. Additionally, both genes showed evidence of tis-

embryos and adults.

sequences found on chromosome 2 (NC_007113.1) [4345]. Alternative splicing occurred at the N-terminus for
both genes and within the HOOK domain for β2.1 (see
Figs. 1 and 2D for descriptions of transcript variants). In
the initial RACE analysis for β2.1, we recovered four
β2.1_tv1 clones, and five β2.1_tv6 clones, suggesting
these may be the most abundant transcript variants. One
clone each was found for the β2.1_tv2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8
transcripts, suggesting they may be less abundant. For
β2.2, we recovered two β2.2_tv1 and three β2.2_tv2 5'
RACE clones. In additional RT-PCR analysis using primers
closely flanking the HOOK domain, we confirmed that
β2.1 transcript variants containing more than one exon
between exons 6 and 10 (i.e. β2.1_tv3, 4, 7 and 8) could
be detected in the RNA samples (see Additional file 2).
Conversely, we confirmed that no alternative splicing
occurred in the β2.2 HOOK domain (see Additional File
2). Several 3' RACE clones were of a single variant for β2.1

Results
Identification of zebrafish and pufferfish calcium channel
β2 subunit (CACNB2) genes
TBLASTN searches of the GenBank database at NCBI using
human β2 subunit sequences suggested that zebrafish
encode two β2 homologues [43]. We therefore designed
primers to highly conserved sequences within the SH3
and GK protein domains, and performed 5' and 3' RACEPCR on RNA extracted from embryos aged 1–3 dpf. Using
RACE and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), we isolated cDNAs representing two zebrafish β2 genes, termed
β2.1 and β2.2 (see Figs. 1, 2 and Additional File 1). The
β2.1 gene showed a near perfect match with genomic
sequences located within Genbank zebrafish chromosome 22 (NC_007133.1), whereas β2.2 matched genomic

and a single variant for β2.2, suggesting that no alternative
splicing occurred in the GK or C-terminal regions of the
genes.
To better assess the conservation of the new genes, we performed a comparative search for orthologous β2
sequences in the pufferfish Tetraodon nigrovidis and Fugu
rubripes genomes [45-47]. We identified a single β2 subunit gene in each pufferfish genome (Fig. 2A). All four teleost β2 genes contained highly conserved SH3 and GK
domains characteristic of MAGUK family proteins (Fig.
2B). The size and number of exons comprising these
domains are nearly identical in teleosts and mammals
(Fig. 2A, yellow and green sections). Pairwise comparisons of amino acid sequences within these core (SH3
through GK) domains, using the most similar transcript
variants available, indicated the zebrafish β2.1, Fugu and
Tetraodon β2 genes shared ~87% identity with other vertebrate β2 genes (Figs. 2C; see Fig S3 for alignment of core

regions). We extended this analysis to five teleost species
by including ESTs or proteins derived from genomic
sequences. Three crystallographic studies on mammalian
CACNB genes have identified a total of 21 amino acid residues as critical for interaction of the β subunit with the α
subunit AID (alpha interaction domain). In our five different teleost species, we observed that all 21 residues
were nearly 100% conserved with mammals (see Additional File 3) [48-50].
In contrast, the more divergent zebrafish β2.2 core region
shares only ~62% amino acid identity (see Additional File
4 for alignment of core regions). The most extreme
sequence divergence in the zebrafish β2.2 gene occurs at
the 5' end of the gene, both 5' of and within the SH3
domain, although high levels of divergence exist throughout the entire protein. We identified a single EST, termed
DW608729, from three-spined stickleback as a possible
ortholog to the zebrafish β2.2 gene. Within the core

domain, DW608729 is 74% identical to zebrafish β2.2
(EU301442) but only 52% identical to zebrafish β2.1
(EU301434). In addition, DW608729 maps to a genomic
contig, AANH01005391.1, which contains sequences
homologous to zebrafish β2.2 exon 1 (encoding MFCCGLGHWRREQSTY) and β2.2 exon 2 (encoding MPPKKK)(Fig. 3). In the β2.2 gene(s), regions of high
divergence encompass sequences both within and outside
of inferred secondary structures [32]. Nevertheless, 19 of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/38

21 β subunit residues noted for interaction with the α subunit AID are conserved in zebrafish β2.2 (see Additional
File 4) [48-50]. High sequence divergence in β2.2 relative
to other vertebrate β genes is reflected in the branch
lengths on the phylogeny (Fig. 6). This pattern contrasts
with that seen in the β4 group, where the two zebrafish
paralogs have experienced similar rates of amino acid substitution.

Alignment of residues in the C terminus of the β subunit
genes shows that sequences 3' to the GK domain are not
highly conserved even among the teleost species (see
Additional File 5). It has previously been noted among
multiple vertebrate β subunit genes that the C terminal
regions are not highly conserved. Specific functions for C
terminal domains are poorly defined, although studies of
truncated β2 proteins suggest the C terminus could contribute to protein function [35].
Alternative splicing at the N terminus and within the
HOOK domain
The zebrafish β2.1 and β2.2 genes undergo alternative
splicing within the N-terminus and within the internal
HOOK domain (Figs. 1, 2A, and 2D). The β2.1 and β2.2
genes each encode two mutually exclusive N termini (Fig.
3). Zebrafish β2.1 and β2.2, as well as the Tetraodon and
Fugu β2 genes, share some 5' exons in common with
mammals (Fig. 2A, lines 4 and 8; Fig. 3). In contrast, the
β2.1 exon 1 sequence could not be found in any mammalian, Xenopus or chick databases, but was present in the
Tetraodon and Fugu genomes, suggesting this exon may be
specific to teleosts (Fig. 2A, line 6). The β2.2 exon 2 was

found only in one other sequence, the stickleback EST
DW608729, although the small size of this exon (6 amino
acids) could make it difficult to recognize if it had
diverged in other species (Fig. 2A, line 5). Additional 5'
exons occur in mammals that were not observed in any
teleost cDNAs or in genomic sequences available to date,
although the limitation of this analysis is that complete
genomic sequences are not available for all teleost species
examined, and that our data relies in part on genome mining rather than extensive cDNA analysis. However, our
data support the hypothesis that each of the teleost β2 loci
have evolved to contain a unique combination of 5'
exons, each of which is predicted to encode an alternative
protein N-terminus.
Alternative splicing also occurs internally for one
zebrafish β2 subunit gene. β2.1 encodes three alternatively spliced HOOK domain exons (exons 7, 8 and 9;
Figs. 1 and 4). The high conservation of β2.1 exons 8 and
9 with mammalian counterparts (Fig. 2A, lines 15 and
16), and exon 8 with several other teleost genes (Fig. 4),
suggests that these internal sequences could have functional relevance. The β2.1 exon 7, which appears to be

Sequences and alignments of alternatively spliced exons contributing to the HOOK domain. Four distinct exons
occur in zebrafish β2 transcript variants which differentially join to exon 6 to encode the HOOK domain (see Fig. 1C). (A-C)
Three of these exons are alternatively spliced in β2.1, whereas the sequence in (D) was the sole sequence found in all β2.2
transcripts. Species names are abbreviated as in Figure 3.

unique to zebrafish, includes a premature in-frame stop
codon expected to truncate the protein in the HOOK
domain (Fig. 2A, line 14). In β2.1 transcripts that contain
both exon 8 and 9, the reading frame is altered such that
a premature in-frame stop codon truncates the protein in
exon 10.
No alternative splicing was observed for β2.2 transcripts
in the HOOK domain; instead, all variants encode a short
exon (exon 7) specific to fish that contains several positively charged residues (Fig. 2A, line 13). Likewise, the
Tetraodon and Fugu genomes contain only one recogniza-

bly homologous exon (exon 9), similar to human exon 11
(Fig. 2B, line 15). The variety of β2 transcript variants is
expected to encode an array of different β2 subunit proteins in teleosts.
The large size of 5' introns
Remarkably, the introns that separate the first few 5' exons
of the β2 loci are among the largest introns known in the
zebrafish, pufferfish or human genomes. Each Tetraodon
and Fugu β2 locus contains one intron over 10 kb, a size
that ranks within the top 5% of the largest introns in pufferfish [51]. In addition, the two pufferfish genes, the stick-

leback β2.2-like gene, and both zebrafish β2.2 and β2.1
each contain introns of > 5000 bp that separate 5'-most
exons (Fig. 5). In pufferfish, the modal value for intron
size is 79 bp, with 75% of introns < 425 bp in length [51].
Given the compact nature of the pufferfish genomes [52],
it was not surprising that introns of the human β2 locus
exceeded the size of those in fish. Nevertheless, the trend
of megasized introns in the N-terminus of β2 loci extends
to the human genome. Three giant introns ranging in size
from 60–100 kb each separate the human β2 exons in the
N-terminus. Thus, when human exon 3 is spliced to exon
7 (beginning GSAD...), the splicing machinery must
exclude over 250 kb of intronic sequence. In contrast,
introns in the remaining part of the human β2 gene averaged 3261 bp in size. In humans, the mean size of introns
adjoining coding sequences is 3749 bp, but 75% of
introns are smaller than 2609 bp [51,53,54]. A recent
analysis of the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila,
mouse and human indicated that the median sizes of
introns separating 5' UTR (non-coding) sequence are significantly larger than introns separating coding sequence
[54]. Even so, the median size of human 5' UTR introns
(8223 bp, [54]) is still much smaller than the human 5' β2
introns, which separate coding sequences.
Divergence of the calcium channel β2 genes in zebrafish
We used CLUSTALW software to align the β2 subunit core
domain amino acid sequences and TreePuzzle and PAUP*
to construct phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony, respectively [55]. By
using only core domains (~SH3-GK), we minimized differences due to alternative splicing (Fig. 6). The Fugu and
Tetraodon β2 subunit genes, zebrafish β2.1, zebrafish β2.2,
and other vertebrate β2 genes form a monophyletic group
(MLQP = 87%, MPBP < 50%). The sequence of β2.2 is
substantially more diverged from other vertebrate β2
genes than is β2.1, both in amino acid replacements (see
branch lengths in Fig. 6) and insertions/deletions. Portions of the gene were sufficiently divergent to be essentially random in sequence with respect to all other taxa,
and the region 5' of the SH3 domain also contained an
18-amino acid deletion. No convincing region of synteny
could be established between any of the teleost β2 genes
and human β2, despite the fact that human chromosome
10 and mouse chromosome 2 share a region of synteny
inclusive of the β2 genes. Thus, a syntenic approach was
not useful to confirm or refute the orthology of zebrafish
β2.1 or β2.2 with mammalian β2 genes.
Heterogeneity of calcium channel β2 expression in the
embryo and adult
To determine whether β2 genes are expressed in a stage- or
tissue-specific manner in early embryogenesis, we performed RT-PCR on RNA isolated from embryos of several
stages in early development. To track the expression pat-

terns of specific transcript variants (Fig. 2D), we used forward primers specific to the 5' exons 1 or 2, and reverse
primers in exon 10 (the GK domain) in RT-PCR experiments (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, amplification of β2.1 and
β2.2 transcripts occurred in embryos as young as the 4-cell
and 1000-cell stages (Fig. 7A). Since zebrafish zygotic
transcription does not initiate until the 10th cell division
(~the 1000-cell stage) [56], the presence of mRNA in 4cell embryos indicates that the transcripts are of maternal
origin. The β2.2 transcript variant 2 was expressed steadily
from the 4-cell stage through 72 hours post-fertilization
(hpf). In contrast, β2.2 transcript variant 1 showed a pulse
of expression in early epiboly stages. β2.1 transcript variant 6 was robustly detected from 26 hpf through at least 3
dpf. Other β2.1 transcript variants (1 and 2) were detected
more sporadically or were undetectable in this assay, consistent with their rare recovery in RACE reactions. Thus,
both β2.1 and β2.2 are expressed from the earliest stages
of embryogenesis, but show significant heterogeneity in
patterns of transcript variant expression throughout the
first three days of embryogenesis.
To determine which transcript variants of the zebrafish β2
genes are expressed in the embryonic heart, we performed
RT-PCR on RNA extracted from cardiac tissue at 72 hpf
(Fig. 7B). These data indicate that only a subset of β2.1
and β2.2 transcript variants are expressed in the embryonic heart relative to the adult heart. In humans, at least
seven β2 transcript variants are expressed in the heart,
including β2a and β2e [34,35,39]. In zebrafish, the β2.1
transcript variant 6 (resembling β2e at the N-terminus)
was expressed only in the embryo, whereas the β2.2 transcript variant 1 (resembling human β2a at the N-terminus) was expressed in the adult but not embryonic heart.
The expression of β2 subunits in several adult organs or
tissues was assayed. In most adult tissues, we observed
transcript variant-specific patterns of expression for the
β2.1 and β2.2 genes (Fig. 7C). Mutually exclusive expression of β2.1 transcript variants 1 and 6 occurred in the
heart and brain, respectively. Some other tissues express
more than one β2.1 transcript variant. Many adult tissues
express both β2.2 transcript variants 1 and 2, but a few tissues (muscle, gill and skin) expressed only β2.2 transcript
variant 2. Thus, adult tissues also show significant heterogeneity in expression of β2 subunit transcript variants.

Discussion

Teleost calcium channel β subunits and embryonic
development
We have identified four new calcium channel β2 subunits
in teleosts, including two in zebrafish and one gene each
in the Fugu and Tetraodon genomes. Like the mammalian
calcium channel β subunits, the four teleost β2 subunit
genes encode characteristic MAGUK family proteins, with

Expression of β2 subunit transcript variants in the embryo and adult
Figure 7
Expression of β2 subunit transcript variants in the embryo and adult. RT-PCR analysis using transcript variant-specific
primers (located in the 5' exons 1 or 2 and exon 10) was performed on RNA samples from A) whole embryos at various
developmental stages, B) cardiac tissue dissected from cmlc2:GFP embryos or from adult fish, and C) adult organs and tissues.
Expression of a housekeeping gene, EF1α, was used as a control for RNA integrity. In B, 72 hpf or adult RNA reactions were
run on single gels, subsequently subdivided to multiple panels for clarity in presentation. Transcript variant numbers are listed
to the right of panels; refer to Fig. 1D.

SH3 and GK domains that are highly conserved with other
vertebrates. We show that several alternatively spliced
transcripts arise from both β2.1 and β2.2 subunits, which
are expressed in the embryo and adult but subject to both
temporal and spatial regulation. Only selected transcript
variants of each β2 subunit gene are expressed in the
embryonic heart, and these differ from adult transcript
variants. Thus, the heterogeneity of β subunits and their
transcript variants in teleost species is extensive.
Gene structure of teleost calcium channel β2 subunits
Alternative splicing occurs within the N-terminus as well
as internally in the β2.1 and β2.2 subunit genes. Notably,
each zebrafish β2 subunit gene encodes at least two mutually exclusive 5' exons, each with a separate translation
initiation site. Each gene has one 5' exon conserved with
mammals, and one 5' exon unique to fish. Similarly, some
of the internal alternatively spliced exons are similar to
those in mammals, while others are unique to teleosts.
This variety of transcript variants potentially encodes an
array of different β2 subunit proteins. Previous studies
have demonstrated that 5' variation due to alternative
splicing can be functionally significant in β subunits.
When expressed in HEK 293 cells, human 5' β2 subunit
variants β2a and β2e (starting with human exons 4 or 6,
respectively) showed differential sub-cellular localization
compared to transcript variants β2b, β2c and β2d (starting
with human exons 4, 1 and 2, respectively) [57]. Moreover, the five human 5' β2 subunit variants differentially
affected open probability, peak current and availability of
L-type channels [57,58]. Likewise, in Xenopus oocyte

expression studies, human β4 subunits with alternatively
spliced N-termini showed functionally distinct electrophysiological properties [59,60]. Domain swapping
experiments further indicate the functional significance of
the N-terminal sequences in β subunit proteins. Replacing
the β1b N-terminus with β2a N-terminus created a chimeric β protein with slow inactivation kinetics [61]. Conversely, replacing β2a N-terminus with the nonpalmitoylated β3 N-terminus created a chimeric β protein
with β3-like inactivation kinetics [62]. Post-translational
modifications such as phosphorylation or palmitoylation,
present on exons near the N-terminus, may account for
some of the functional diversity, although this functional
relationship has been experimentally demonstrated for
only a few genes to date [63,64]. Intriguingly, a recent
report indicates that the length of the β2 N-terminus is,
independent of sequence, an important factor in mediating the magnitude of channel modulation [58]. Further
functional studies using the zebrafish model system will
be necessary to determine whether the array of zebrafish
β2 subunit proteins indeed have different biochemical
functions within the cell.
A curious feature of at least five species of teleost β2 subunit genes, as well as the human β2 subunit gene, is that
some of the largest introns of the genome separate the several short, alternatively spliced 5' coding exons. Do these
large introns have any adaptive significance for β2 subunit
biology? In several instances, introns have been shown to
incorporate enhancer or repressor elements that influence
transcription [65]. Expanding this idea, we propose that

Page 10 of 16

BMC Molecular Biology 2008, 9:38

the unusual β2 gene structure may provide a mechanism
for independent cis-regulation of each transcript variant;
that is, sequences within individual introns might independently direct the tissue and temporally-specific expression of transcript variants utilizing the associated ATGcontaining 5' exon. This hypothesis is supported by the
observation that transcript variant-specific patterns of
expression do in fact occur in both embryo and adult.
However, it is increasingly becoming appreciated that,
beyond regulatory elements, introns can impact mRNA
metabolism in a number of other ways. Potential effects
include modulating transcription rates by regulating DNA
accessibility, modulating editing and polyadenylation of
the pre-mRNA, and affecting nuclear export, translation
and mRNA decay rates [65,66].
The inclusion of different subsets of 5' exons (and their
associated introns) among each of the pufferfish or
zebrafish β2 subunit genes is interesting from an evolutionary standpoint. A canonical view is that variations in
protein structure and function form the basis of evolutionary innovation and phenotypic divergence. However,
as more genomes are sequenced and annotated, it is
becoming evident that alternative splicing substantially
increases the proteome in many species. (For example,
about 40–50% of human and mouse genes contain alternative promoters [67]). A corollary to this hypothesis is
that the regulatory circuitry regulating alternative splicing
or the expression of particular transcript variants is also an
important source of evolutionary innovation [67,68]. The
mechanisms by which new introns arise during evolution,
and the impact of large intron size per se on cis-regulation
or other adaptive phenomena, remain actively debated
areas of research [69-71].
The evolutionary origin of the duplicated calcium channel
β2 subunit genes
Zebrafish β2 duplication may be the consequence of a
genome-wide duplication thought to have occurred in teleosts approximately 300 million years ago [72-74]. Alternatively, duplication could be the result of an ancient
region-specific duplication. The β2 subunit gene does not
appear to be duplicated in either the Fugu or Tetraodon
genomes. The existence of single β2 subunit homologs
was of itself not particularly surprising since phylogeny
and synteny data suggest that the common ancestor of
zebrafish and pufferfish underwent a large-scale gene or
complete genome duplication event [75]. Subsequently,
pufferfish may have lost many duplicates that were
retained in the zebrafish [75]. Data from the other β gene
paralog groups (β1 and β4) are equivocal, as zebrafish
have one described copy of β1 and two copies of β4
[41,76]. The fate of most duplicated genes is the accumulation of degenerative mutations in coding or regulatory
regions that leads to gene loss or silencing [73]. Alterna-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/38

tively, genes may acquire separable patterns of expression
or separable functions that then require the maintenance
of functional copies of both genes in the genome (subfunctionalization) [73]. Since the two zebrafish β2 genes
are both robustly but differentially expressed, our data are
more consistent with subfunctionalization.
Developmental expression patterns of calcium channel β2
subunit transcript variants
Calcium is an important signal in the embryo even prior
to gastrulation [77]. Calcium gradients, waves and pulses
have been described in the blastula and early gastrula that
may represent key pattern forming events. The mechanism underlying these calcium signals, and whether they
encompass voltage-gated calcium channels, is not clear.
Surprisingly, both β2 subunits show maternal as well as
the early zygotic expression of several transcript variants.
Our recent study of two zebrafish β4 subunits, which are
also expressed maternally and zygotically in the gastrulating embryo, indicates that these genes are essential for
normal epiboly. Initially, we predicted that β subunits
might be involved in the gastrulating embryo voltagegated calcium channel-related functions. However, our
study showed that the zebrafish β4 subunits, at least,
operate independently of voltage-gated calcium channels
in mediating epiboly [76].

In addition to possible early roles, we find that expression
of β2.1 or β2.2 is under strong temporal control in the
post-gastrula embryo and in adult tissues. Of particular
interest, given the cardiac lethality observed in mouse β2deficient embryos, is the observation of differential subsets of β2.1 and β2.2 transcript variants expressed in the
embryonic and adult heart. This observation supports the
hypothesis, previously proposed by others, that the heterogeneity of β subunit transcript variant expression within
the heart may provide a mechanism for fine-tuning the
cardiac voltage-activated current as the organism
progresses through embryonic, juvenile and adult stages
[38,39]. In addition, the expression levels of particular β2
transcript variants has also been linked to pathophysiology of heart failure in humans [78-80]. Clearly, the first
step in interpreting the function of β subunits in any
model system is simply to understand when and where
the various transcript variants are expressed.

Conclusion
The primary novel findings of this study are as follows: 1)
We have cloned two new β2 subunit genes in zebrafish,
one of which is phylogenetically quite divergent in amino
acid sequence. They are classified as MAGUK proteins on
the basis of high conservation with mammalian MAGUK
core regions. 2) Alternative splicing occurs at the β2 N-termini and internally. A comparative analysis showed that a
subset of 5' exons present in several teleosts species is

Page 11 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Molecular Biology 2008, 9:38

shared with mammals, while a different subset appears to
be unique to teleosts. 3) Some of the largest introns in the
human or teleost genomes separate the small, alternatively spliced 5' exons of β2 genes, leading us to hypothesize that β subunit transcript variant expression may be
under independent cis-regulatory control. 4) The
zebrafish β2 genes are expressed maternally and zygotically in the gastrulating embryo and show strong evidence
of temporal and spatial regulation in embryogenesis and
in adults. 5) Only a subset of β2 subunit transcript variants is expressed in the embryonic heart, and they differ
from those expressed in the adult heart. In sum, this work
provides the groundwork for a study of functional aspects
of β2 subunit biology. The high degree of temporal and
spatial control of β subunits, combined with recently
identified non-canonical functions for particular β subunits or transcript variants, suggests that a functional analysis of these genes would provide intriguing insight.

Methods
Zebrafish strains and care
This study used the WIK zebrafish strain. Zebrafish care
was provided in accordance with animal care policies of
Colorado State University. Embryos were staged as
described [81].
Isolation of zebrafish β2 cDNAs
Total RNA was prepared from embryos aged 24–72 hpf
using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufactuer's protocol. Poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared using magnetic beads (µMACS mRNA kit Miltenyi Biotec), and
resuspended in RNase free dH2O at a concentration of 1
mg/ml. RNA was stored in aliquots as an ethanol precipitate at -80 degrees Celsius. RACE Ready cDNA was created
using the SMART RACE cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA). RACE reactions were carried out as per
manufacturer's protocol using gene-specific primers
designed to hybridize within the SH3 and GK domain
encoding regions of β subunit genes identified by BLAST
searches of the zebrafish genome (Fig. 1 and Additional
File 2A). RACE PCR products were separated in ethidium
bromide-stained agarose gels, excised and purified over a
silica matrix column (Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit,
Zymo Research). cDNA fragments were cloned into pCR
2.1-TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Pufferfish sequence identification and amino acid
alignments
We used human and zebrafish β2 sequences to identify
homologous Fugu and Tetraodon β2 sequences by a multistep process. First, we performed protein vs. translated
DNA (TBLASTN) searches using human or zebrafish β2
sequences against the NCBI, Sanger Centre, UCSC
Genome Bioinformatics and pufferfish genome databases

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/38

[43-47]. This process identified the best matches among
the Fugu or Tetraodon predicted proteins derived from contig assemblies and other sequences available for pufferfish. The homologous predicted Fugu or Tetraodon
proteins were re-tested by TBLASTN against mammalian
Refseq proteins to confirm they were more similar to β2
subunit genes than other β subunit family members. Next,
we used the homologous Fugu or Tetraodon seqeunces in
BLAT searches of UCSC Genome Bioinformatics database
sequences to identify the genomic location of Fugu or
Tetraodon β2 exons 3–14 and to determine conserved
splice donor and splice acceptor sites [45]. To identify the
short N terminal exons (exons 1 and 2) or search for alternative HOOK domain exons in pufferfish, we used
zebrafish or human exons in 1) BLAT searches of UCSC
Genome Bioinformatics pufferfish (Fugu or Tetraodon)
sequences, 2) MEGABLAST, peptide motif and BLASTP
searches of NCBI, and 3) BLAST or BLAT searches of the
Fugu Genome Browser, the Tetraodon Genome Browser,
or the Sanger Center Ensemble Genomic databases [4347]. Exons were numbered according to their sequential
location in the genome, and probable splice donor and
splice acceptor sites were identified for each exon. The
pufferfish sequences were submitted to the Third Party
Annotation database of NCBI. Additional teleost
sequences from trout, medaka, and stickleback were
obtained by searching the NCBI EST or WGS databases, or
from JGI [82].
Phylogenetic analysis
Amino acid sequences representing the β subunit "core"
(i.e., from the amino acids "GSAD" just prior to the SH3
domain through the end of the GK domain) were aligned
using ClustalW, varying gap opening and extension
parameters; regions for which reliable homology could
not be established because of indels were excluded from
analysis [83]. Portions of the zebrafish β2.2 gene were sufficiently divergent in sequence from all other genes
(including those from Drosophila and mosquito) to be
essentially random. To minimize the phylogenetic analytical problems associated with such extreme rate variation
among lineages, we excluded regions of the alignment in
which zebrafish β2.2 contained autapomorphic amino
acid substitutions for ≥ 3 adjacent amino acid positions.
Such exclusions resulted in an alignment of 252 amino
acids. Maximum likelihood analyses were implemented
in TreePuzzle [84] using the Müller & Vingron (VT) model
of amino acid substitution with a mixed model of rate heterogeneity; amino acid frequencies, the gamma distribution parameter alpha, and the proportion of invariant
sites were estimated from the data [85]. Nodal support
was assessed using quartet puzzling. Equally-weighted
maximum parsimony analyses were carried out using
PAUP* [55]. A heuristic search was performed with 25
random additional replicates and TBR branch-swapping.

Reverse transcription assays
As an RNA source, we used whole embryos, or individual
organs or tissues dissected from adults aged approximately 1 year. Cardiac tissue from embryos was isolated
on the basis of its GFP expression from the cmlc2:GFP
transgenic line, in which the cmlc2 promoter drives
expression of GFP only in the heart [86]. RNA was
extracted using the Trizol method and stored at -80°C. RTPCR was performed for β2.1 and β2.2 genes using the
Access RT-PCR System (Promega) using high-fidelity
polymerases. The thermal cycling program was as follows:
48°C for 45 minutes (reverse transcription), followed by
94°C for 2 minutes (activation of PCR enzyme) and 40
cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute, and
68°C for 2 minutes. A final step of 68°C for 7 minutes
allowed for a final extension. Electrophoresis of the final
product was performed on a 2% agarose gel containing
ethidium bromide. Gels were imaged using a digital camera and imaging software (Scion Corporation, Frederick,
MD).

(B) A representative RT-PCR analysis of Danio rerio β2.1 and β2.2
transcripts. In lanes 1–3, a single band of the expected sizes amplified for
β2.2, consistent with a lack of alternative splicing in the HOOK domain
(spanning exons 5–8 in β2.2). In lanes 6 and 7, products consistent with
β2.1_tv1 (697 bp) or β2.1_tv6 (580 bp) tended to amplify robustly.
Potentially, larger amplicons from less abundant transcript variants may
be out-competed in these reactions. We therefore tested primers closely
flanking the HOOK domain (spanning exons 5–10 in β2.1). In lane 8,
products consistent with all HOOK domain transcript variants were
observed (a 647 bp band, a 415/394 bp doublet band, and a 280 bp
band). Cloning and sequencing of these products of Lane 8 confirmed that
the bands represented are the transcripts indicated. Lanes 4 and 9 are positive controls using primers to the house-keeping gene EF1α (220 bp).
Lanes 5 and 10 are negative controls. Reactions were run on two gels, as
shown (some lanes have been removed). (C) For each primer pair, the
