Abstract
Background: Distantly related proteins adopt and retain similar structural scaffolds despite length
variations that could be as much as two-fold in some protein superfamilies. In this paper, we
describe an analysis of indel regions that accommodate length variations amongst related proteins.
We have developed an algorithm CUSP, to examine multi-membered PASS2 superfamily
alignments to identify indel regions in an automated manner. Further, we have used the method to
characterize the length, structural type and biochemical features of indels in related protein
domains.
Results: CUSP, examines protein domain structural alignments to distinguish regions of conserved
structure common to related proteins from structurally unconserved regions that vary in length
and type of structure. On a non-redundant dataset of 353 domain superfamily alignments from
PASS2, we find that 'length- deviant' protein superfamilies show > 30% length variation from their
average domain length. 60% of additional lengths that occur in indels are short-length structures (<
5 residues) while 6% of indels are > 15 residues in length. Structural types in indels also show classspecific trends.
Conclusion: The extent of length variation varies across different superfamilies and indels show
class-specific trends for preferred lengths and structural types. Such indels of different lengths even
within a single protein domain superfamily could have structural and functional consequences that
drive their selection, underlying their importance in similarity detection and computational
modelling. The availability of systematic algorithms, like CUSP, should enable decision making in a
domain superfamily-specific manner.

Background
Protein databanks such as the PDB [1], with nearly 47,000
structures in the current year, are growing at a rapid pace.
Interestingly, the increase in the number of protein structures in the last decade is not accompanied by a concomitant rise in the number of novel folds. This suggests that
protein folds are resilient to exploit their large degrees of
conformational freedom and can tolerate large modifications in sequence and length. Structural comparisons of
related proteins show that changes, in the form of substitutions, deletions or insertions are accommodated into
existing protein scaffolds. Protein domains show from
two-three residue variation to over two-fold length variations as in the PDB entries for P-loop NTP hydrolases and
the TIM fold.
Recent studies correlating domain length variations with
the taxonomy spans of domains report that over one-third
of all domains tend to increase/decrease in domain size.
The fraction of domains that increase in domain size is
two-fold larger than domains that decrease in size[2].
Analysis of protein length distributions across the main
kingdoms have also shown that mean protein lengths are
40–60% greater in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes[3].
Such expansions in length correlate with the accretion of
functional motifs during the evolution of sophisticated
regulation networks in higher eukaryotes.
Structural variation is influenced by the number, length
and location of insertions and deletions of residues
(indels) [4]. Pascarella and Argos [5], noted that less than
2% of indels are longer than 10 residues suggesting that a
gradual accretion of protein length through shorter indels
can achieve structural diversity. Reeves and co-workers
[6], in an analysis of domain variations in CATH superfamilies have shown that even at low sequence identities
(< 30%), 50% of the domain structure is conserved. However, changes in the form of structural re-orientations and
the number of structural elements are high between
remotely related proteins. Domain length variations
although discontinuous in sequence co-locate in 3D space
and mediate functional variety.
In a separate analysis on the study of physical parameters
between related domains of a superfamily, "structural
templates" were shown to have a strong correlation of
physical parameters such as solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding patterns, spatial orientations and interactions between different members [7]. Such segmental
conservation of features suggests that such features are not
as well preserved in poorly conserved regions resulting in
structural and functional diversity amongst related
domains through variable regions. Length accretions are
critical in mediating structural and functional variety in
proteins and it is, therefore, important to understand their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/28

properties and determine if class-distinct trends operate
on protein domains. We extend earlier analysis on indel
properties further by annotating such regions in terms of
their preferred structural types, lengths and biochemical
parameters and look for class-specific trends, if any. Such
indels also extend functional and structural support to
protein domains and this is also discussed briefly for a few
superfamilies.
We report an algorithm, CUSP, which identifies conserved
units of structure in proteins and distinguishes such
regions from indels where length variations are introduced. The PASS2 database[4] provides structure-based
alignments of non-redundant representatives of protein
superfamilies sharing < 40% sequence identity. Since initial equivalences are specified using STAMP 4.0[8] or LSQMAN[9], such alignments maximize structurally similar
regions amongst related domains and distinguish them
from indels that are structurally variable across different
members. These alignments derived through COMPARER[10] have examined protein domains that show
not only low sequence conservation but also demonstrate
variety in length and thus serve as ideal starting points to
describe indel regions.
CUSP was used to examine length variations in 353 multimembered superfamily alignments (> 3 sequence diverse
relatives) from the PASS2 database [4]. To determine if
observed trends are affected by the inclusion of more proteins, sequence homologues of the structural entries in
PASS2 were included from the GenDis database[11]. In a
separate analysis, the CUSP algorithm was also applied to
such alignments to detect core features of a domain superfamily. Further, we have extended the study to analyze the
conservation of a biochemical property such as solvent
exposure in structurally conserved and unconserved
regions.

Methods
Dataset
353 structure-based superfamily alignments from PASS2
database [4], with more than 3 members, at < 40% identity cutoff and nearly equal representation from the four
major structural classes (72, 81, 88 and 112 superfamilies
from α, β, α/β (AorB) and α+β (AplusB) classes respectively) were considered for the analysis. Since PASS2
derives from SCOP hierarchical schemes[12], only nonredundant representatives are considered in the alignments and biases due to over-representation of similar
structures are avoided.
CUSP: Detection of conserved units of structure in protein
structural alignments
Starting from PASS2 alignments [4], CUSP maps DSSP
assignments of secondary structure[13] to the alignment

(see Figure 1). Likewise, solvent accessibility scores computed through PSA program [14] are also mapped to every
sequence. Each alignment position is scanned and the
assignments H, C and E at each position are retained if
such a structural type shows > 75% occurrence. This is
applied to capture consensus trends observed in the
majority of members as described earlier in JOY assignments [15] and in the detection of equivalent structures
amongst superfamily representatives [6]. Gaps (-) are
retained to account for insertions or deletions in any
member. A '*' replaces a structural type at a position in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/28

alignment when such a structural type shows < 25%
occurrence at that position. To determine the consensus
residue at each position, a scoring scheme that scores
absolute matches of a structural type as 5, mismatches as
3.75 and gap exchanges as 1 (Figure 1), is employed.
Although score assignments were chosen non-empirically, they were optimized on analyzing a large variety of
alignments that varied in the number of representatives
and the employed scheme was effective in differentiating
strictly structurally conserved positions from indel
regions. The scoring scheme was applied to score all

Schema of CUSP algorithm and the scoring scheme employed for identifying structurally conserved and
unconserved blocks [SSB and USB]. Steps 1–4 illustrate the steps involved in processing structure-based alignments of an
example domain superfamily. Scoring schemes that capture structural type exchanges at each position in the alignment (represented as X1 and X2 exchanges for comparisons of each pair) are first applied to each position. Consecutive positions with
high scores are merged to identify structurally conserved blocks and distinguish them from indels. An average score is associated with each such block and used to annotate the alignment to distinguish indel regions (USB) from 'core' regions (SSB). In
the example, highly conserved structural blocks (H, E and C) identified by high block scores (> 4.5), are indicated in maroon,
dark blue and dark green respectively. Conserved blocks that show 'medium' conservation are also indicated (red (helix), cyan
(strand) and light green (coil)). The remaining regions are treated as USB.

exchanges between observed structural types at each position (Figure 1: described as X1–X2 exchanges) and an
average score (Figure 1: Sc[i]) and a consensus structural
type was assigned to every alignment position. Next, consecutive alignment positions of identical structural types
were merged to form a structural block and a Block score,
an average of the sum of scores at each position, was associated with every block (Figure 1: Block_score[i] [j]). Thus,
a block represents a consensus unit that is conserved in all
members in the alignment.
In a similar manner, average solvent accessibility scores
were also associated with each structural block (not
shown in the figure). Since the score is averaged over each
position in the alignment, the block score is indicative of
the extent of conservation of each structural type (H, C, E
or -) in each block. Each structural block was associated
with the tags 'Poor' (block score < 3), medium (block
score 3–4.5) and high (block score 4.5–5.0). Finally, a
consensus structural alignment is derived for the protein
superfamily that not only delineates the structurally conserved blocks (SSB: H, E or C) from structurally unconserved blocks (USB: *, -) but also annotates such regions
based on block scores as 'high, medium or poor' to indicate degree of conservation.
Validation of the algorithm and scoring schemes
The scoring scheme that we have employed was arrived at
after examining domain superfamily alignments that varied in the number of representative members in the alignment. Although it is well appreciated that different
approaches produce quite different alignments[16], structural alignments of ten superfamilies, derived independently using other alignment methods such as CE[17] and
CDD[18], were also tested with the CUSP scoring scheme.
Primarily, we wanted to determine if the applied scores
were robust in identifying structurally conserved features
in related domains. The number of structurally equivalent
positions reported by either method was obtained and
compared with the number of 'core' conserved residues
identified by the CUSP scoring scheme when applied to
domain superfamily alignments from PASS2. In each of
the superfamilies considered, the CUSP scoring scheme
was robust in capturing strictly conserved features. Specifically, inherent biases in the superfamily, for instance, the
conservation of a minimum of 4 helices in the cytochrome C superfamily, could be captured independent of
the alignment method and to that extent the schemes
employed are predictive and can describe the strictly conserved features of a superfamily.
Length variation in protein superfamilies
Mean domain sizes for each superfamily were determined
by averaging over the lengths of individual members.
Standard deviations in length from the mean domain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/28

sizes were calculated for every member using standard formula and averaged for the entire superfamily. The degree
of length variation for every member from the mean
domain size of its superfamily was calculated by expressing as a ratio the length difference of each member to its
mean domain size.

|l − M|
Length difference = i
∗ 100
M
where li = length of a protein superfamily member
M = Mean domain size of each superfamily
The distribution of length differences of the ~2500 proteins in the 353 superfamilies was plotted. Superfamilies
in which a majority of the members (> 75%) show > 30%
length variation were considered as "length-deviant"
superfamilies and others with less than 10% variation in
length from the mean domain size were considered as
"length-rigid" superfamilies. The extent of deviation and
the number of members that distributed in various length
ranges were both employed in the distinction of superfamilies as length-rigid and length-deviant (also see Additional information Section I: S1–S5, Figures 2 and S1, and
Results later).
Application of CUSP on diverse folds and functional
implications of indels
Structurally conserved features of several domain superfamilies, by careful examinations of multiple alignments,
have been studied in detail in the past and are available in
literature. We have applied CUSP to a few classical
domain superfamilies such as globin, ferritin and cytochrome C domain superfamilies (see Additional information) to determine CUSPs performance in identifying core
regions and in distinguishing indel regions in these well
characterized folds. In addition, other structure alignment
methods were also applied to such folds. The functional
and structural implications of indel regions detected by
CUSP were also examined.

Results and Discussion
Extent of length variation in protein domain superfamilies
Length variations in protein domains are universal and
observed in all protein classes. Figure 2a shows that
domain superfamilies from all classes show long length
variations (> 50 residue standard deviation from the average domain size). ~20% of protein superfamilies from the
α/β class exhibit > 50 residue deviations in domain
length. ~70% of the superfamily members in all classes
show < 50 residue deviation (Figure 2a). The extent of
length variation in different multi-membered superfamilies from all classes ranges from 5 to > 45% of the
mean domain size (Figure 2b) and has been used to dis-

CUSP assignments of structurally conserved and
unconserved blocks in proteins
Structural modifications, it is observed, can form extensions of pre-existing structures or insert as new structural
elements in the middle of domains. Such insertions
although not contiguous in sequence may lie close to each
other in structure and even form sub-domain like structures. Alternately, they may accrue as additional regular
(α-helix, β-strand) and irregular structures (coils) at the N
and C terminal ends (Table S2). Since CUSP delineates
protein alignments into structurally conserved regions
and unconserved regions, it would be useful to identify if
a selection principle is operational in identifying where
structural modifications, because of additional lengths,
can occur in related protein domains.
Extent of length variation accommodated in SSB and USB
80% of length variations in length-deviant superfamilies
from all classes are observed in USB regions with some
superfamilies from the α/β class accommodating a wider
range of length variation (Additional information, Section I: S2 – S4). Truncated structural elements account for
10% of these length differences (Additional Figure S1a).

Structural characteristics and lengths of 'indels'
We have examined the nature and lengths of secondary
structures that appear in indels. Here, we find that regular
secondary structures such as helices and strands are
observed in indels, in addition to coils (Figure 3a). In fact,
a class-specific trend emerges in the present analysis (Figures 3a and 4) and we find that additional length between
related proteins is accrued in ~50% of protein superfamilies of the α-β (α/β or α+β) class as α-helices. Examination of protein structures of representative 'giant' and
'dwarf' members of length-deviant protein superfamilies
confirm these trends. 56% of protein superfamilies from
the α-class such as the Cytochrome C (Figure 4a) show
additional coils in indels while β-class proteins introduce
either additional β-strands/coils (Figure 4b). The giant
and dwarf members of the Actin-like ATPase and Lysozyme superfamilies (Figure 4c and 4d) accommodate up
to two-fold variation in length primarily as additional helices and coils. On consideration of the 64 length-deviant
superfamilies alone, similar trends are obtained and helices and coils are both highly favored in indels (Figure
S1c). For 70% of the highly populated length-deviant
domain superfamilies (Table 1), nearly 40% of indels are
coils (Figure S1d). Manual examination of the locations
of these additional structures shows that such indels can

Length adjustments in length-deviant superfamilies from the four major classes
Figure 4
Length adjustments in length-deviant superfamilies from the four major classes. Panels' I-IV depict 'dwarf and giant'
representative members (left and right respectively) of a deviant superfamily from alpha, beta, alpha/beta and alpha +beta class.
Representative members are indicated with PDB id and domain length. CUSP reported structurally conserved regions (SSB),
whose lengths and structural type are retained across all domain superfamily members (in brown), are distinguished from
unconserved regions/indels (USB, in green). (a) Cytochrome C superfamily 'giant' members are 56% more likely to adjust extra
length as coils and short length helices.(b) Viral proteins from β-class have acquired additional strands and coils in indel regions.

either act as extensions of previous secondary structures or
occur as insertions in the middle of domains. Some of
these insertions extend from the N and C terminal
domains and in superfamilies such as the SAM domain

and lysozyme (Figures 4c and 4d), such indels are long
and sub-domain like.
The length distributions of such indels in different classes
also show interesting trends. We find that 60% of indels

BMC Structural Biology 2008, 8:28

are < 5 residues (Figure 3b). Medium-sized indels of
between 5–10 residues are noticed in 20% of all indels in
the dataset. Only 6% of all indels are found to be > 15 residues in length. Similar trends were also observed in earlier analysis on homologous superfamilies [5,6] although
on smaller and different datasets.
45% of the additional α-helices in indels of helix-rich
length-deviant superfamilies are shorter than 5 residues
(Figure 3c). A majority of the α-helices appearing in USB
regions of β and α-β protein superfamilies are < 5 residues
although in all superfamilies, longer α-helices (between 5
and 15 residues) are also observed (~20%). ~70% of
indels appearing as β-strands are short length (< 5 residues) and this may relate to the cost involved in satisfying
the inherent nature of β-strands to form sheets. Additional
strands of longer length (> 10 residues) are observed in
fewer than 5% of all length-deviant β-rich superfamilies.
Such strands in indels could be extensions of pre-existing
strands or occur as shorter length β-hairpins and, therefore, strands longer than 15 residues are not noticed in
indel regions.
We observe that percentage variation in terms of the total
number of α-helices, coils and β-strands is more in lengthdeviant superfamilies than in length-rigid superfamilies
(see Additional information, Section I: S1, and Tables S4
and S5). In some of the length-deviant superfamilies
(Additional Tables S2 and S5), the number of additional
structures is large enough to form domain like structures.
Manual examination of the structural alignments of the
giant and dwarf domains of length-deviant domain superfamilies shows that in all classes, the accretion of single,
long secondary structures is less common and instead
many short length indels are arranged to form super secondary structural motifs (Table S2). Thus, isolated or solvent-exposed extra secondary structures are avoided and
additional units confer structural or functional support in
each domain superfamily. In order to address if these
trends are observed after including immediate sequence
homologues of these superfamiles, we consulted the precurated results from GenDis database [11] for the top-five
length-deviant and length-rigid superfamilies belonging
to the four major structural classes. For each superfamily,
between 250 to 800 sequence homologues were considered for assessing trends in length variation. We find similar trends of length variation in the superfamilies
distinguished as "length-rigid" and "length-deviant" using
structural homologues alone, even on the inclusion of
sequence homologues in these superfamilies (data not
shown). This suggests that superfamilies identified as
length-deviant/rigid are likely to remain so even with the
availability of more structures.

Solvent accessibility in conserved structural blocks
The conservation of a biochemical property such as solvent accessibility in regions annotated as SSB and USB was
analyzed (see Additional information, S5) to determine if
such regions behaved distinctly from each other. Additional Figure S2a shows that in Beta class superfamilies,
structurally unconserved regions (USB) arising from
indels or structural replacements are usually exposed to
the solvent. Amongst these, in structurally conserved
regions (SSB), β-strands show a distinct preference for
avoiding solvent while coils and α-helices are partially/
well- exposed to the solvent. Likewise, Additional Figure
S2b shows the distribution of the average PSA scores in
different types of structurally conserved blocks in all
classes. (Additional Figures S3–S5 show trends in these
parameters for other classes).
Application of CUSP algorithm in the identification of
structural scaffolds
The CUSP algorithm examines structure-derived alignments to delineate structurally conserved regions from
structurally variable regions in protein domain superfamilies. Thus, applications of the algorithm on domain
superfamily alignments are well capable of identifying
'core' regions, common to all members, from 'variant'
regions. In order to verify this, we have examined the
scores assigned to various conserved blocks identified by
the program on some well characterized folds such as the
Globins, Ferritins and Cytochrome C (see Additional
information). Each of these folds is known to show considerable variations in length that are accommodated as
indels.
Globins
The three-dimensional structures of globins are known,
from crystallographic analyses, to be very similar. In an
earlier analysis of the conserved features of this fold
involving 226 sequences, it has been shown that the
globin family of proteins differ greatly in their amino acid
sequences and conserve only two residues in all
sequences. Residue identities of some pairs of sequences
are even as low as 16% [19]. Structure-guided alignments
generated for these proteins have shown that although
individual chains vary in size between 132 and 157 residues, only 102 residue sites are common to all globins
due to many deletions and insertions. These sites form six
separate regions that lie in the core conserved helices.
Insertions and deletions between these regions involve
separations of different lengths in different sequences.
Other detailed reviews on the phylogenies and differences
between constituent members universally agree on the
conservation of a core fold constituted by the A, B G and
H helices [20]. Functional variety is attributed to differences in the remaining structural elements. As shown in
Figure 5a, the CUSP algorithm attributes high scores to

Page 9 of 14

BMC Structural Biology 2008, 8:28

such well conserved regions and recognizes the four core
helices. In fact, these scores and structurally conserved
blocks are also identified by using alignments involving
different members and methods. For the same superfamily, we have examined the alignments generated by CE
[17] and CDD[18]. Irrespective of the number of
sequences and the alignment algorithm applied to align
the sequences, CUSP is seen to detect the structural scaffold involving the core A, B, G, H helices to a high accuracy. Figure 5a and Table S3 show that in the globin
domain superfamily, CUSP reports 107 residues as structurally equivalent, CE derived alignments treat 119 resi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/28

dues as structurally conserved while CDD reports 84
residues as strictly conserved.
Ferritin like superfamily
This superfamily of the alpha-rich fold includes members
that are di-iron carboxylate proteins. The average domain
size of the superfamily is 250 residues and includes small
domains such as ruberythrin (1dvba1, 147 residues) and
giant domains such as methane monoxygenase hydroxylase/MMO (1mtyd,512 residues). The two domains catalyze
dioxygen-dependent
oxidation-hydroxylation
reactions[21]. All members are characterized by the pres-

ence of a duplicated motif consisting of two consecutive
helices. An iron-coordinating glutamic or aspartic acid is
located in the first helix and there is an EXXH (single-letter
code for amino acids) motif in the second, but there are
no other obvious sequence homologies. CUSP when
applied to structure-based alignments for the domain
superfamily detects the consecutive helices that strictly coordinate Fe (Figure 5b). These conserved helices, in fact,
typify the conserved scaffold of the domain superfamily
and are also detected from independently derived CE
alignments of Ferritin domains. As seen in Table S3, both
CE and CUSP agree well on the number of structurally
equivalent residues for the domain superfamily. Large difference in size that occurs as additional helices and several
loops are found to be associated with the number of interacting domains in the giant member MMO which is far
more than ruberythrin. This difference could account for
the acquisition of extra structural elements that can interact with different domains.
Role of indels in structural and functional diversity
Indels, irrespective of their location, seem to confer a
structural or functional variation to the domain superfamily in which they occur (Table S2). For instance, the
members of the SH3 domain superfamily (Src Homology) show up to two-fold length variation. This is a family
of molecular modules that is conserved amongst diverse
proteins which function in protein-protein interactions
for intracellular signal transduction. These interactions are
effected through the recognition of a short proline-rich
sequence, that adopts a left-handed polyproline type II
helical conformation, embedded in proteins [22]. A giant
member of this domain superfamily, MIA (Melanoma
inhibitory activity protein), differs from the typical members in structural and functional aspects. In contrast to the
typical members that are intracellular and modular, MIA
is a single domain, extracellular protein. Here, additional
lengths are not only seen as N and C terminal extensions
that result in wider and larger barrels (Figure 6a–c) but
also as additional sheets and 310 helices in the middle of
the structure. Length differences extend to the RT loop and
60s–70s loops that flank the ligand binding region of SH3
domain. A superposition of four domains in this superfamily shows incremental additions to the termini and
acquisition of additional structures in the middle of the
domain such as in the RT and 60s–70s loops (Figure 6d).
These indels mediate functional differences from the typical domain members and involve in the ability to recognize ligands other than conventional polyproline helices.
Thus, in the SH3 domain superfamily, structural add-ons
tune a conventional scaffold to meet new requirements of
location, structure and function.

Conclusion
In our analysis, we have estimated the extent of length variation in protein superfamilies and employed it as a measure of structural variation between homologous proteins.
Numerous measures have been used to quantify protein
structural similarity and these include RMSD, SSAP, contact maps, DALI and VAST scores [23-26]. We are interested in the tolerance of folds to large variations in length
and have, therefore, employed standard deviation and
mean length variation to determine this. Proteins of similar lengths may still differ in the orientations of individual
secondary structures and adopt different folds. To that
extent, a simple scoring scheme that parses pre-derived
structural alignments of known related proteins from the
PASS2 database and quantifies the extent of length variation in all protein superfamilies is used to empirically estimate trends emerging in the dataset. We have also
performed the analysis on multi-membered domain
superfamilies (> 3 members) for an empirical assessment
of the data involving 353 domain superfamilies. Additionally, trends obtained in the dataset are noticed on
consideration of the most length-deviant or highly populated domain superfamilies alone.
We have presented a method, CUSP, which processes protein structure-driven alignments to identify conserved
structural units, common to all related proteins. In doing
so, regions that allow variations to accumulate and confer
uniqueness to each protein, annotated as USB, are also
identified for every superfamily. The scoring schemes were
arrived at after examining alignments derived independently from other approaches such as CE and CDD. In 8 of
the 10 superfamilies examined, CUSP detects > 60% of
the conserved residues reported by other alignment methods. For the two superfamilies which show < 45% coverage, the large difference in the number of structural entries
examined may be responsible for the difference in performance. While the alignments from CDD included very
close sequence homologues, the structural representatives
considered in the CE alignment included domain members of similar lengths and also include more sequence
diverse members. A strict cut-off of 75% is employed to
characterize structural types at each alignment position as
H, E or C and this in fact, increases the stringency of the
scores. These assignment and scores therefore, are representative and predictive of SSB assignments in all and new
sequence relatives in the superfamily. Cut-off schemes
similar to ours have been employed earlier in JOY representations of structural alignments[15] and in estimating
equivalences of secondary structures (SSE) for deriving
matrices[27].
We have also attempted a study of the domain contexts,
associations of length deviant domains and their functional consequences (Table S2, and manuscript under

preparation). Reeves et. al., [6] have examined equivalent
secondary structures between CATH superfamilies and
suggest that such additional structural elements contribute effectively to functional variety in the highly populated superfamilies.
Since the CUSP algorithm works with a scoring scheme to
detect consensus trends in a majority of the superfamily
members, the extent of conservation of each structural
type in each block is annotated and it is possible, therefore, to extract features that correlate with the extent of
conservation of each structural type. An analysis of the
nature of such USBs shows that additional lengths can
either occur as extensions or insert in the middle of a protein structure. A class-specific trend for the type of structure adopted in indel regions has also emerged in the
current analysis and each class prefers a specific type of
structure (Figure 3, Figure S1 (b-d)). Figure 4 shows exam-

ples of different superfamilies that exhibit class-specific
nature in accommodating length variations.
We find that in all superfamilies examined, the structurally unconserved regions amongst related proteins do not
all retain a uniform pattern in solvent accessibility. This
coincides with the expectation that it is in such regions
that variation in lengths between proteins is introduced.
To preserve the core scaffold, which may be the driving
force in limiting the number of folds, indel regions are
more prone to structural changes and this may result in
greater solvent exposure in some proteins or alter protein
surfaces to modify interaction interfaces. β-strands show a
universal preference for solvent avoidance and this reflects
the preference of such strands to avoid isolations from the
protein core and integrate into the structure as wellordered sheets (Table S2). In proteins of the α-β class,
coils show a clear preference for solvent exposure, more so

in α + β class superfamilies where they are vital in segregating α and β units. Inferences on solvent exposure, in
the present analysis, are limited to individual domains of
the proteins and do not consider multi-domain contexts
and oligomerisation states of the proteins.
Based on the extent of length variation observed in different superfamilies, we have clustered all the superfamilies
into length-rigid and length-deviant groups. Interestingly,
length-rigid proteins are not as well-populated (as
reflected in the number of members that are functionally
diverse and in the number of families) as length-deviant
proteins. While on the one hand, this does indicate that
with the availability of more structures, trends in lengthdeviations could be affected in the identified rigid superfamilies, one may argue that such superfamilies are not
preferred due to their strict length limitations and limited
functional promiscuity (as reflected in the number of families). Length-deviant proteins, on the other hand, are
found to include superfolds such as the P-loop NTP
hydrolases, Ferredoxin folds etc., that have already been
shown to be well represented in many genomes.
In many length-deviant protein superfamilies, despite
large differences in length (over two fold in some cases),
the core is often well preserved. The large additional
lengths often do not involve the active site and in many
cases they affect the oligomerization states and interacting
surfaces of the protein (Ferritin like domain superfamily),
introduce substrate-specificity (SH3 domains) and in
some cases play an auto-regulatory role (Table S2). Since
our analysis is derived from the PASS2 database of
domain superfamilies, which in turn is guided by the
domain definitions of SCOP, it is highly likely that severe
length deviation, exhibited as additional domains, have
escaped our attention.

These interesting trends that we have obtained on the
nature and type of indels in protein superfamilies from
different classes could impact the area of comparative
modeling in indel regions of newer superfamily members.
We have obtained some distinct trends on indels that are
class-specific, with information on typical lengths. Such
information, we expect, will be useful in the choice of specific structural types for newer relatives of protein superfamilies. Each superfamily shows a distinct trend in length
variability and such information can be fed, by the assignment of variable gap penalties, into sequence alignment
approaches to improve homology detection amongst
members that vary considerably in length. We trust that
such analyses would provide guiding principles during
sequence searches, alignment and homology modeling of
distant relationships.
