Abstract
Background: Population genetic studies of dogs have so far mainly been based on analysis of
mitochondrial DNA, describing only the history of female dogs. To get a picture of the male history,
as well as a second independent marker, there is a need for studies of biallelic Y-chromosome
polymorphisms.
However, there are no biallelic polymorphisms reported, and only 3200 bp of non-repetitive dog
Y-chromosome sequence deposited in GenBank, necessitating the identification of dog Y
chromosome sequence and the search for polymorphisms therein. The genome has been only
partially sequenced for one male dog, disallowing mapping of the sequence into specific
chromosomes. However, by comparing the male genome sequence to the complete female dog
genome sequence, candidate Y-chromosome sequence may be identified by exclusion.
Results: The male dog genome sequence was analysed by Blast search against the human genome
to identify sequences with a best match to the human Y chromosome and to the female dog
genome to identify those absent in the female genome. Candidate sequences were then tested for
male specificity by PCR of five male and five female dogs.
32 sequences from the male genome, with a total length of 24 kbp, were identified as male specific,
based on a match to the human Y chromosome, absence in the female dog genome and male
specific PCR results. 14437 bp were then sequenced for 10 male dogs originating from Europe,
Southwest Asia, Siberia, East Asia, Africa and America. Nine haplotypes were found, which were
defined by 14 substitutions. The genetic distance between the haplotypes indicates that they
originate from at least five wolf haplotypes. There was no obvious trend in the geographic
distribution of the haplotypes.
Conclusion: We have identified 24159 bp of dog Y-chromosome sequence to be used for
population genetic studies. We sequenced 14437 bp in a worldwide collection of dogs, identifying
14 SNPs for future SNP analyses, and giving a first description of the dog Y-chromosome phylogeny.

Background
Population genetic studies of the earliest history of the
domestic dog have so far mainly been based on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which represents a
single genetic marker and, since it is maternally inherited,
can only describe the history of females [1-4]. In order to
have a second marker to corroborate the results based on
mtDNA and to obtain a picture also for the history of male
dogs, studies of the dog Y chromosome would be valuable. The Y-chromosomal genetic variation has been analysed in a few studies so far, but only for microsatellite
variation [5,6]. Microsatellites have the disadvantage that
mutations may be recurrent, rendering the phylogenetic
relations between haplotypes not entirely clear. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the other hand are
an, in practice, digital form of information, since multiple
mutations in the same nucleotide position is unlikely. It
has been shown for humans that individuals may have Ychromosomal haplotypes that are identical based on a
large number of microsatellite markers even though the
haplotypes as defined by biallelic markers are different, a
contradiction which is due to recurrent mutations of the
microsatellites [7]. This shows that Y-chromosomal biallelic markers are imperative for phylogenetic studies
where they can serve as a backbone for the Y-chromosome
phylogeny upon which the more detailed microsatellite
variation can be imposed. Furthermore, for the dating of
ancient population genetic events, analysis of DNA
sequence variation offers a better tool than do microsatellites. There is thus a need for DNA sequence information
for the dog Y chromosome.
However, so far only 3200 bp of nonrepetetive Y-chromosomal dog sequence has been reported in GenBank [8,9].
With the recent sequencing of the dog genome [10] the
sequence for the autosomal and the X chromosomes were
identified but, since the sequence was from a female dog,
the Y chromosome sequence was not obtained. The
genome of a male dog has earlier been surveyed by the
sequencing with 1.5× coverage of a male dog [11], but
because of the low coverage of this genome sequence an
assembly into the different chromosomes is not possible
and a definite identification of Y chromosomal sequences
is therefore not possible.
In order to identify Y-chromosomal sequence we therefore compared the two genome datasets by Blast analysis,
identifying sequences present in the male genome and
absent in the female genome, and also compared the
sequences with human Y chromosome sequence for further screening. The candidate sequences were then
checked for male specificity by PCR analysis of male and
female dogs. In order to identify SNPs to be used for population genetic studies we thereafter sequenced 14437 bp
of the identified Y-chromosome sequence in 10 individu-

als representing dogs from all major populations around
the world, giving a phylogenetic backbone for future population genetic studies of the Y-chromosome variation in
dogs.

Results and discussion
Identification of Y chromosomal sequence
In order to identify Y-chromosome sequences in the male
dog genome sequence we performed a combination of
Blast and PCR analysis. For a sequence to be accepted as Y
specific three criteria had to be fulfilled: (i) it should, in a
Blast search against the human genome, have a best hit or
be linked to a read with a best hit, to the human Y chromosome, (ii) it should in a Blast search against the reference female dog genome sequence have a negative result
and (iii) it should in a PCR against samples from five male
and five female dogs yield PCR product only for the male
samples.
Identification of candidate Y-chromosome sequences by
Blast analysis
The Blast analysis was performed in two steps; to reject the
thousands of male sequences that lack identity with the
female genome sequence owing to gaps in the female
genome assembly or polymorphisms between the two
genomes, a screen of the male dog genome sequence
against the human Y chromosome sequence was done
before comparing with the female dog genome sequence.
Assembled survey-sequence data, based on approximately
two million contigs and singleton reads, from the genome
of a male poodle [11] was compared to the reference
human genome sequence using blastn. For 32 contigs, the
highest-scoring alignments were with a single region on
the human Y-chromosome (Additional file 1; rows 1–32).
Component reads from these contigs were linked physically to mate reads from the other end of the insert in the
same clones and these were, in turn, often part of distinct
contigs consisting of several other reads. These sequences
were also considered as possible Y-chromosome sequence
(Additional file 1; rows 33–93) giving totally 93 potential
Y-chromosome sequences which were further compared
to the reference female boxer genome sequence [11].
Sequences sharing >95% nucleotide identity for more
than 90% of their lengths with regions of the boxer
genome sequence were discounted, resulting in 43
remaining sequences considered as potential Y-chromosome sequences (Additional file 1; Boxer Hit:"-").
Confirmation of male specificity by PCR analysis
The 43 sequences considered potential Y-chromosomal
sequence were tested for male specificity by PCR in two
steps, first against a panel of two male and two female
dogs (DNA sample panel 1), and the sequences passing
this screen were further tested against a panel of three
male and three female dogs (DNA sample panel 2). To

investigate the correctness of excluding sequences with
match to the female genome sequence, even though they
had a best hit to the Y chromosome in comparison to the
human genome, 29 of the sequences excluded based on
this criterion were also tested. Upon agarose gel electrophoresis, sequences giving bands or smears of the same
size for both males and females were excluded from further analysis, as were sequences giving no bands at all.
Sequences giving bands only for males were kept as candidates.
35 sequences, of the 43 considered potentially Y-chromosome specific, passed the first PCR screen (Additional file
1). Of the eight sequences which did not pass, seven gave
bands or smears for both males and females and one gave
no bands at all. Of the 29 sequences excluded based on
match to the female genome all failed, 28 giving both
male and female bands and one giving no bands at all.
The 35 sequences that passed the first screen were selected
for the second PCR screen against three more male and
female dogs to confirm the male specificity. 32 of the 35
candidates were approved (giving bands of correct size for
all five males, and no band at all for all five females) and
thus considered male specific. Of the three failed
sequences two had a band for only one of the male dogs
and the third one had a weak band for one female dog.
The GenBank Accession number for these sequences,
totally 24159 bp in length, can be found in Additional file
1.
Sequence variation
In order to study the genetic variation for the Y-chromosome among dogs, and to identify nucleotide diversity to
be used in population genetic studies, we performed DNA
sequencing of 10 male dogs for 24 of the sequences iden-

tified as male specific, for a total of 14437 bp. Twelve of
these sequences formed six pairs obtained from the same
shotgun clone, with intervening unknown sequence. This
sequence was determined through primer walking. The
sequence data generated for the ten samples, including
the here defined intervening sequence, have been deposited in GenBank, under accession numbers DQ973626–
DQ973805. In order to avoid geographical bias for the
identified polymorphisms and to cover a large amount of
the genetic variation among dogs globally, the 10 dogs
were chosen to represent several different populations
and types of domestic dogs from all continents except
Australia (DNA sample panel 3).
Among the 10 dogs, 9 haplotypes were found which were
defined by a total of 14 polymorphic positions, 13 substitutions and 1 indel (Figure 1). As expected for haploid
sequence, none of the individuals were heterozygous for
any nucleotide position. The average number of differences between two individuals was 4.2, giving a π value of
2.91 × 10-4. A π value for the wolf Y chromosome of 0.4 ×
10-4 has earlier been reported [12], seven times lower than
the here reported value for dogs. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. One explanation might be that the
here analysed dog sequences probably mostly derive from
non-genic regions while the wolf sequences were mostly
intronic sequence, possibly giving different substitution
rates for the two data sets. Another explanation might be
a geographical bias for the wolf sample (30/36 animals
were from Russia (unspecified region)/the Baltics/Scandinavia, which because of the great mobility of wolves may
be quite closely related populations). It can be noted that
for the human Y chromosome π = 1.51 × 10-4 (2.3 Mb of
the NRY sequenced) [13], which is in best agreement with
the value for the dogs in this study.

Phylogenetic relationships
The fact that analysis of ten individuals resulted in nine
haplotypes indicates that there are numerous more Ychromosome haplotypes to be found in the global dog
population. A phylogenetic tree displays the relationship
between the nine haplotypes (Figure 2). There is no clear
geographic pattern for the distribution of haplotypes; possibly the sample is too small to show any such trends. The
nucleotide substitution rate for the human Y chromosome is approximately 1.65 × 10-9 per bp and year [14],
and it has been shown that the average genome mutation
rate is approximately constant among mammals [15].
Assuming a mutation rate of 1.65 × 10-9 substitutions per
year and bp also for the dog Y chromosome, in the lack of
a species specific rate, we get a rate of one substitution per
42000 years for the analysed region. Assuming that the
domestic dog originated around 15,000 years ago [2,16]
this suggests that the nine dog Y-chromosomal haplotypes, several of which are more than one mutation step
from its nearest neighbours, would originate from at least
five wolf haplotypes. This agrees with an origin from a
minimum of six female wolves according to mtDNA studies [2] and of totally a minimum of 21 individuals according to a study of dog MHC-variation [17].

Conclusion
We have in this study, using Blast analysis and PCR
screening among male and female dogs, identified 24159
bp of dog Y-chromosome sequence to be used for population genetic studies. We sequenced 14437 bp of this
sequence in a worldwide collection of 10 dogs, giving a
first glimpse into the dog Y-chromosome phylogeny. Nine
haplotypes were found among the ten dogs, indicating
that there are numerous more Y-chromosome haplotypes
to be found in the global dog population. The 14 identified SNPs can be used for SNP analyses, and the SNP
based phylogeny will serve as a backbone for studies of Y
chromosome microsatellite variation.

Methods
Blast analysis of genome shotgun sequences
Assembled survey-sequence data from the genome of a
male poodle [11] was searched against the reference
human genome sequence [18] to identify sequences with
a best match to the Y chromosome, using NCBI-blastn
with the following parameters; -e 1e-3 -q -11 -r 10 -G 20 E 10 -X 150 -F T -b 1 -v 1 -m 8. Sequences with several
matches were excluded as repetitive sequences. The male
poodle sequences were also searched against the reference
female boxer genome sequence [19] using NCBI-blastn
with the following parameters; -W 40 -b 1 -v 1 -m 8. A
match was defined as an alignment with >95% nucleotide
identity for >90% of the length of the poodle sequence,
and sequences without a match were considered to be
potential Y-chromosome sequences (Additional file 1).

factor of eight. Buccal epithelial cell samples were collected using Whatman FTA-indicating cards according to
the manufacturer's specifications [20].
DNA amplification for test of male specificity
PCR amplification of target sequences was performed
using a forward and reverse primer (Additional file 2). The
PCR mixture consisted of 2 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen), 20
mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.4 (Invitrogen), 50 mM KCl (Invitrogen), 200 mM of each dNTP (GE Healthcare), 1 unit PlatinumTaq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and 200 mM of
each primer in a total volume of 50 µl. The DNA template
was 1 µl DNA extract from blood samples or a ∅ 2 mm
piece from an FTA indication card. The reaction was run
in a ThermoHybaid MBS 0.2 S (Thermo Electron Corporation) and the PCR program consisted of a predenaturation step (94°C, 2 min), followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation (94°C, 30 sec), primer annealing (55°C, 30
sec) and extension (72°C, 3 min) followed by a final
extension step (72°C, 10 min). The presence of amplification products was checked by analyzing five µl PCR product with agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with
ethidium bromide.
DNA amplification for sequence analysis
PCR amplification of target sequences was performed in a
nested configuration to improve specificity of the amplification (Additional file 2). Both outer and inner PCRs had
PCR mixtures and PCR programs identical to the amplification for test of male specificity, with the exceptions that
the template for the inner PCR was 0.5 µl of PCR product
from the outer PCR and the number of cycles for the outer
and inner PCR was, respectively, 15 and 35.
DNA sequence analysis
All nucleotide positions were sequenced by at least one
forward and one reverse sequence read, using the primers
given in Additional file 2. For the cycle sequencing reaction, 1 µl of the inner amplification product was mixed
with 13 µl 1× cycle sequencing buffer (26 mM Tris, pH
9.0, 6.5 mM MgCl2), 1 µl big dye terminator (ABI Prism
Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
v2.1, Applied Biosystems) and 0.25 µM primer, for a total
reaction volume of 20 µl. The reaction was run in a ThermoHybaid MBS 02 S. The cycle sequencing program consisted of 30 cycles of denaturation (96°C, 10 s), primer
annealing (55°C, 15 s) and extension (60°C, 4 min). The
cycle sequencing products were ethanol precipitated and
analysed on an ABI 3700 according to the manufacturers'
directions (Applied Biosystems). The DNA sequences
were edited using Sequencing Analysis 2.1.1 (Applied Biosystems) and assembled into contigs and further edited in
Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation). Alignment
and comparison of sequences were performed in
Sequencher 4.1.
