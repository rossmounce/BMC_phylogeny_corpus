Abstract
Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) tests are crucial diagnostic tools for the prevention of
neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix. However most commercial methods are designed to detect
high-risk (HR) HPV types and a limited selection of low-risk ones, thus missing a fair number of
intermediate/low-risk types. As a result, many HPV infections remain undiagnosed, generating
distrust in virological diagnosis among gynaecologists, who continue to rely preferentially on
cytological and colposcopic findings.
Results: In this study, we tested 6,335 consecutive clinical samples, most of them from Italian
patients with cytological abnormalities. The samples, collected in 2000–2007, were analyzed using
PCR amplification of a 173–206 bp (depending on HPV type) conserved region in the L1 open
reading frame, restriction endonuclease analysis and, where required, sequence analysis for type
determination. Analysis of a smaller male sample and long term follow-up of a few female subjects
was also performed. A total of 2,161 samples tested positive for HPV DNA (32.1%); 21.3% of them
were mixed infections. Overall, 59 known and 2 unknown HPV types were detected. Their relative
prevalence was calculated; notably, types not clearly identifiable using the most common
commercial method accounted for 36% of infections. Clinical findings associated with the
underdiagnosed types ranged from H-SIL to low-grade abnormalities, although none of these
infections resulted in invasive cancer.
Conclusion: Given the high prevalence of some underdiagnosed HPV types in the population
(principally HPV53, HPV66, HPV84, and HPV87) and their frequent association with cytological
abnormalities, techniques capable of detecting and typing them would prove extremely useful.

Background
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the genital
tract are highly prevalent in the population worldwide;
indeed, it is estimated that the great majority of sexually

active individuals become infected with one or more of
these viruses in their lifetimes. Most conditions are transient and are cleared without consequences. However, in
a small proportion of cases, infections associated with the

so-called high-risk (HR) HPV types can persist in typical
lesions with a high viral load for years, and a fraction of
such lesions eventually progress to invasive malignancies.
Although many cofactors normally concur in this process,
the HPV type implicated (the type-specific viral oncogenes) and the inability of the immune system to clear the
infection are by far the most important determinants of
HPV-related diseases (for review see: ref [1]). Recent work
by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) network has contributed to clarify the role of HPV
genotypes [2,3], and has assigned to each HPV type an
Odds Ratio for the risk of cancer development. This information is crucial for prognosis and correct management
of infected individuals. From a diagnostic and clinical perspective, HPV typing appears to be as important as HPV
DNA detection. Several diagnostic tests for HPV DNA
detection and typing are available. Some are based on
PCR amplification of HPV DNA using primers recognizing a conserved sequence of the viral L1 region, followed
by typing using restriction endonuclease polymorphism,
solid phase hybridization with type-specific probes, or
sequencing of the amplified product [4-7]. Other assays
are based on liquid-phase hybridization without previous
template amplification, like the only FDA-approved test
for HPV DNA detection, Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Digene/
Quiagen, Gaithesburgh, MD, USA), which detects a
selected number of types, i.e. low-risk types 6, 11, 42, 43,
and 44, and HR types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52,
56, 58, 59 and 68. Finally, assays like INNO-LiPA [8]
(Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) and Amplicor/LA (Roche
Molecular Systems, Alameda, CA, USA) use hybridization
(after PCR amplification) with a variable number of
probes organized into arrays for detection and typing. The
diagnostic approach to HPV infections is thus strongly
affected by the choice of diagnostic strategy, and a number
of types fail to be detected in the vast majority of virology
laboratories worldwide. As a consequence, the pathogenic
potential of a large proportion of mucosal HPV types cannot be correctly evaluated and the possible changes in the
molecular epidemiology of HPVs cannot be adequately
monitored.
We investigated the distribution of underdiagnosed HPV
types in genital infections, using a molecular strategy
capable of detecting a large number of known (and possibly unknown) HPV types, and calculated their relative
prevalence and their role in the arising of cytological
abnormalities and dysplastic lesions.

Results
Detection and typing of HPV DNA in samples from female
patients
A total of 6,029 female genital samples (including 47
biopsies) received from 7 different clinical centres in
2001–2007 were analyzed for HPV DNA; 2,110 (33.8%)
tested positive for HPV DNA. A total of 54 different restric-

tion patterns were detected, identifying up to 62 different
known types; of these, 46 unique restriction patterns identified single types, while 8 restriction patterns identified
two different types each. Interestingly, most of the latter
patterns identified couples of HPV types phylogenetically
related within the same species (29/77, 44/74 and 62/72
among low-risk, and 26/69, 51/82 and 70/85 among
ones), while in two cases they identified pairs made up of
two more distantly related types: 27/39, a low-risk cutaneous/mucosal and a high-risk type and 40/63, a low risk
mucosal and a cutaneous type. In the case of mixed infections, the individual co-infecting types were mostly
resolved by the analyses of the mixed restriction patterns,
up to four different types. In cases where restriction analysis of the amplified product resulted in a clear but
unknown pattern, the amplification product was
sequenced to achieve a definitive result, mostly showing
the presence polymorhisms in the restrictions sites. Most
of these variants are extremely rare, while common variants were detected for HPV type 66 and 54. Nonetheless,
some mucosal HPV types were never detected in our samples, including HPV32, HPV71, HPV73, HPV86 and the
most recently characterized types from HPV97 to HPV106
(except HPV102, which was detected once). A few exclusively cutaneous types, i.e. types 1, 4, 5, 8, 19, 22, 50, 75,
and 76, were single findings. The source of these samples
is unknown, possibly they derive from warts in the groin
area. The frequency distribution of the types detected in
the present study is summarized in Figure 1. As in most
other settings, HPV16 was the most prevalent virus, followed by other types: HPV31, HPV66 and HPV52. Not
surprisingly, given that sampling was driven mostly by
cytological abnormalities rather than by the presence of
condylomata, the most prevalent true low-risk type
(HPV42) was the 6th most frequent type. According to the
technique used, 21% of all fully typed infections were
mixed, 17% were double, 3% were triple and less than
0.2% were quadruple or more. However, the latter figure
might be inaccurate, because some multiple infections
were untypeable and the precise number of coinfecting
viruses could not be determined. In Figure 1 the types
marked by an asterisk are those that would not have been
correctly identifiable by the HC2 technique (with either a
false negative or a wrong type result), accounting for 36–
38% of those detected by our method. Similarly, 28–32%
and 14–16%, respectively, would not have been identifiable by INNO-LiPA (25 genotype version) and ROCHE LA
(37 genotype version). The uncertainty of these figures
depends on the fact that some HPVs are typed as couples
(as described previously) by our assay, and other assays
detect only one type in some of those couples.

Positive samples for which cytological information was
available were subdivided into grade of abnormality
(ASCUS through H-SIL) and type prevalence was calcuPage 2 of 7

+100%, HPV61: +60%, HPV29/69: +37% and HPV87:
+15%), although on the basis of limited numbers. To
identify the clinical significance of HC2-undetectable
types, we analyzed the associated cytological findings,
again excluding the mixed infections with HC2-detectable
viruses. Of 289 HC2-undetectable infections for which
cytological findings were available, serious abnormalities
(H-SILs) were detected in 17 samples (5.9%) (compared
with 12.5% of infections with HC2-detectable viruses, i.e.
119/951). In six HC2-undetectable infections the clinical
and cytological findings had led to surgery, irrespective of
the HPV type involved; however, none of these patients
showed CINIII/carcinoma in situ (CIS) at histological
analysis of the surgical piece.

Finally, in 4 subjects who underwent surgical excision
without prior virological testing, but whose lesion was
indeed histologically classified as CINIII/CIS, the followup genital swabs tested positive only for HC2-undetectable viruses (HPV53 or HPV87) suggesting that these
viruses might have been implicated in the pathology
observed. However, the analysis of their available formalin-fixed surgical samples revealed HPV16 infection in 3
cases and HPV31 in one, indicating that HC2 undetectable viruses were co- or subsequent infections. This underlines the importance of HPV testing and, in particular, of
typing prior to excision, in order to perform the correct
prognostic evaluation and a reliable subsequent followup.

lated. As shown in Figure 2, the prevalence of high-risk
types increased with lesion grade, while the opposite was
true for most low-risk types. Although the proportion of
HC2-undetectable viruses decreased, these viruses were
still found in 31/143 (22%) H-SIL samples (excluding all
mixed infections with HC2-detectable viruses) and a few
of them, as the main high risk ones, showed a rise in prevalence in H-SIL samples compared to ASCUS, (HPV67:

HPV DNA in samples from male patients
Of all the samples analyzed, 306 were genital swabs from
male subjects. Clinical information on the reasons leading to HPV DNA testing was available for a minority of
these samples, the main two causes being an HPV DNApositive female sexual partner and detection of condylomata acuminata. Overall, 51/306 samples were positive
for HPV DNA (16.5%). Of note, 83/255 (33%) of the
samples collected at the glans penis were positive for HPV
DNA, as opposed to 4 of the 51 urethral samples (7.8%).
This suggests that the urethra is not a major site of replication for most HPV types and that it may not be the ideal
site for sampling in male subjects (just as it is not a site for
the development of HPV-related tumours [9,10]). Data
from 52 positive male samples analyzed before 2001
(from a comparable population and tested by the same
method) were added to these 51 cases to enrich the analysis. The overall type distribution is shown in Figure 3.
Untypeable infections due to faint bands were more frequent among male than among female samples, suggesting a very low viral load in some of these specimens. The
difference with female samples was striking, as low-risk
types HPV6 and HPV11 were more prevalent than HPV16,
and the whole general pattern was different. This can be
attributed to the fact that in males specimen collection

was not guided by cytological abnormalities, and therefore, although biased by the fact that the obvious presence
of condylomata in males may lead to the request of HPV
analysis more frequently than in females, the male sample
probably reflects more accurately the general circulation
of HPV types in the normal sexually active population.
To gain further insights into the discrepancy observed in
type prevalence between the genders, we next tried to
identify stable couples where both partners were positive
for HPV DNA. We were able to document 26 such couples. Type concordance (including mixed infections with
at least one type in common) was very low: 8/26 (30.8%);
in all other cases the partners harboured different HPV
types, confirming a high turnover of HPV infections in the
population. In addition, no correlation could be found

between persistence in the female partner after treatment
and the presence of same virus in the male partner. The
latter finding, despite the small sample, argues against the
systematic investigation of male partners, which has lately
become fashionable. Moreover, the usually obvious
nature (and the low incidence) of dangerous HPV-related
lesions in males does not justify widespread virological
testing, even in partners of HPV-positive women.
Long-term virological follow-up of HPV-infected subjects
The extended observation period by the same method
enabled some longitudinal analysis. Although with different schedules, depending on the different clinical centres
or practitioners, a significant number of patients were followed-up after the initial sampling. Of these, 157 showed

no reason of impaired immunocompetence was reported
in these patients. If we consider all the other patients in
follow-up, virtually all high-risk infections were either
spontaneously cleared or successfully treated within two
years. Treatment was performed in 16,5% of the subjects
with HR infections in one of the clinical centres (no data
were available from the other centres). None of the over
6000 patients included in this study, undergoing pap-test
and virological analysis, was reported to develop invasive
cervical cancer, demonstrating the high success rate of correctly implemented prevention based on screening and
typing. In the same time period of the study, a few cervical
cancers were reported in the clinical centres, but only in
patients who underwent no screening; their samples were
therefore not included.

in at least 2 consecutive samples, in the absence of treatment. Persistence >2 years was observed in 30 perfectly
immunocompetent individuals; in 10 of them the same
type infection persisted in the absence of treatment. The
HPV types identified in these 10 cases were 31, 52, 53, 54,
56, 61, 66, 84. HPV66 persisted longest (6 years) in one
patient, without cytologically (ASCUS) and colposcopically alarming lesions; to our knowledge the virus has not
yet been cleared. These data confirm the notion [11] that
cervical HPV persistence is not an exclusive feature of the
most dangerous types, although in our sample many
high-risk infections underwent some sort of treatment
and no reliable comparison was possible. The remaining
20 subjects showed consecutive multiple infections with
different HPV types. The sequence of the infections was
particularly striking in three cases (Figure 4). Despite the

Despite the recent progress in the understanding and definition of the risk of cancer associated with the so-called
"high risk" HPV infections, the epidemiology and clinical
significance of rare HPV infections and those that are not
associated with cancer has not been completely clarified.
Most data come from studies limited either by sample size
or by the inadequacy of the technique applied in detecting
and typing a sufficient number of the HPV types circulating in the population. Since all such infections give rise to
a range of cytological abnormalities that are readily
detected by the Pap smear test, deeper insights into their
distribution and role in generating cytological changes
could guide clinicians towards aetiology-driven therapeutic approaches, confining invasive treatment to those
infections really requiring it. Most clinical laboratories use
commercial assays which, though sufficiently sensitive in
detecting most high-risk HPV genotypes and other common low-risk ones, fail to identify many infections
responsible for cytological abnormalities. We used a PCR
amplification method capable of detecting the HPV DNA
sequences of a large number of mucosal HPV genotypes,
associated with different strategies for typing the amplified viral DNA. Over the past few years, several untyped
sequences have been detected at our laboratory using this
method. Analysis of the sequences (all deposited in the
databases, and published elsewhere) led to the complete
sequencing and molecular characterization in our lab of a
novel virus that was officially designated candHPV87 [12].
To date, two of the sequences detected in the former study
remain untyped (representing either subtypes or potential
novel types) but, unlike HPV87, they have not been found
again in the population. Using this strategy, we demonstrated a high overall relative prevalence of HPV types not
identifiable using the most common commercial methods, accounting for more than one third of all infections
harbouring detectable HPV DNA (in the case of HC2).
These results are in agreement with those obtained by

sequencing in Germany [13], and suggest that this distribution is not restricted to italian patients. This could represent a problem worldwide, since only a minority of
facilities use assays that detect most genotypes. The clinical findings associated with these types ranged from HSILs to (more frequently) low-grade abnormalities, as
shown in the present study. Although we could find no
link between underdiagnosed HPV genotypes and histologically confirmed CINIII/CIS lesions (but histological
data were available only for 22/117 patients from a single
clinical centre, no data were available from the other clinical centres), some potentially dangerous infections might
remain undetected. In other cases, lesions falsely negative
for HPV DNA or with inaccurate typing may generate confusion and/or alarm. Indeed, in some reports (for comprehensive meta-analyses see refs. [2] and [11]) a small, but
consistent proportion of malignancies was observed to
arise from infections with HPV73 and HPV82, and other
authors [14] found a few CINIII/CIS cases associated to
underdiagnosed types. In addition, some of these underdiagnosed viruses, i.e. HPV26, HPV30, HPV53, HPV66,
HPV67, HPV69, HPV70, and HPV85, are phylogenetically
related [15] to the HPVs more frequently associated with
cancer. Only a multicentric analysis, based on a very large
number of patients, could clarify this aspect.

than specificity and range of types identifiable. The most
promising technology, capable of providing the necessary
information with relative ease of execution and good
potential for standardization, is based on macro- or
micro-arrays. Current assays using such flexible molecular
methods are still limited in terms of number of probes
and specificity [16], therefore the development and use of
more powerful and reliable arrays should be encouraged
(rather than hampered by the protection of intellectual
property, as it sometimes happens). Detecting and typing
all possible genital papillomaviruses circulating in the
human population should also turn out to be a useful aid
both for the design and the use of successful preventive
(and possibly therapeutic) vaccines.

Methods

Conclusion

Patients
Genital samples (swabs and biopsies) from Italian female
and male patients were referred to our laboratory for a
range of HPV-related genital conditions including cytological abnormalities, colposcopically detected lesions
and condylomata. Known HIV-positive or transplant
recipient patients were excluded from this study. Overall,
6,335 consecutive clinical samples received in 2000–2007
were evaluated for the presence of HPV DNA. The samples
included a small number of fixed bioptic or surgical specimens.

Although the present study is limited in terms of the geographical distribution and selection criteria of the sample
population, and might not have the solidity of a formal
epidemiological study, the sheer number of samples and
the extended period in which they have been collected
provide firm support for the notion that ideal assays for
the diagnosis of HPV infection should detect and type reliably the large majority of HPV types affecting the genital
mucosa. Sensitivity to low copy numbers is less important

DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and typing
The technique for DNA extraction and amplification from
clinical samples has been described elsewhere [9]. Briefly
the MY11 [4] and GP6+ [6] primers (modified and synthesized as follows: sense primer GCA CAG GG(T/A) CAT
AA(T/C) AAT GG, antisense primer: AAC TGT AAA TCA
(A/T)AT TC(T/C) TC) were used to amplify the L1 conserved region of the HPV genomes. In our hands this com-

bination of primers has proved to be more sensitive and
capable of amplifying a broader range of genotypes than
both the original MY11/09 and GP5+/6+ pairs. In each
extraction/amplification session a negative control sample (plain water) was subjected to extraction and amplification along with the clinical samples, to exclude crosscontamination. Extraction of DNA from fixed samples
was performed on 20-μm-thick slices deparaffinized with
xylene and hydrated by serial passages in ethanol with
growing proportions of water. After hydration, samples
were processed like the cytological material. The amplified product (173–208 bp) was subjected to restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, after
digestion with RsaI and Tru91 restriction endonucleases,
directly applied to an aliquot of the amplification reaction. To resolve cases with similar restriction patterns
(HPV 10/27/39/67/70/85, HPV2/30/53 or HPV52/84),
the amplified product was also digested with AflIII restriction endonuclease. In a limited number of samples restriction analysis did not yield a satisfactory result, due to (in
order of frequency): 1) faint bands in the presence of nonspecific products, 2) multiple infections with many different types, 3) unknown restriction pattern due to polymorphisms (mostly subsequently resolved by sequencing the
amplified product).

HPV DNA sequencing and sequence analysis
In some of the cases yielding unidentifiable restriction
patterns, the amplified product was sequenced by the
cycle sequencing technique, followed by detection on an
ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis automated sequence
analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Sequences were subsequently analyzed using the NCBI
BLAST tool and phylogenetic analysis (Phylip package)
after multiple alignment (Clustal) of HPV sequences
available from public databases.

Authors' contributions
SM, PB and KM performed some of the sampling and all
the restriction and sequencing analyses, SM and MC conceived the study and organized the data, AC selected specific clinical cases, provided clinical data and performed
colposcopy and, in a few cases, cytology, SS performed
histological analysis. SM drafted the manuscript, with
helpful advise by MC and PB.
