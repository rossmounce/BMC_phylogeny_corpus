Abstract
Background: The deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus harbors thiotrophic and
methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria in its gills. While the symbiotic relationship between this hydrothermal mussel
and these chemoautotrophic bacteria has been described, the molecular processes involved in the cross-talking
between symbionts and host, in the maintenance of the symbiois, in the influence of environmental parameters
on gene expression, and in transcriptome variation across individuals remain poorly understood. In an attempt to
understand how, and to what extent, this double symbiosis affects host gene expression, we used a transcriptomic
approach to identify genes potentially regulated by symbiont characteristics, environmental conditions or both.
This study was done on mussels from two contrasting populations.
Results: Subtractive libraries allowed the identification of about 1000 genes putatively regulated by symbiosis and/
or environmental factors. Microarray analysis showed that 120 genes (3.5% of all genes) were differentially
expressed between the Menez Gwen (MG) and Rainbow (Rb) vent fields. The total number of regulated genes in
mussels harboring a high versus a low symbiont content did not differ significantly. With regard to the impact of
symbiont content, only 1% of all genes were regulated by thiotrophic (SOX) and methanotrophic (MOX) bacteria
content in MG mussels whereas 5.6% were regulated in mussels collected at Rb. MOX symbionts also impacted a
higher proportion of genes than SOX in both vent fields. When host transcriptome expression was analyzed with
respect to symbiont gene expression, it was related to symbiont quantity in each field.
Conclusions: Our study has produced a preliminary description of a transcriptomic response in a hydrothermal
vent mussel host of both thiotrophic and methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria. This model can help to identify
genes involved in the maintenance of symbiosis or regulated by environmental parameters. Our results provide
evidence of symbiont effect on transcriptome regulation, with differences related to type of symbiont, even
though the relative percentage of genes involved remains limited. Differences observed between the vent site
indicate that environment strongly influences transcriptome regulation and impacts both activity and relative
abundance of each symbiont. Among all these genes, those participating in recognition, the immune system,
oxidative stress, and energy metabolism constitute new promising targets for extended studies on symbiosis and
the effect of environmental parameters on the symbiotic relationships in B. azoricus.

Background
Symbiosis, defined as an interdependent relationship
between two species, is an important driver of evolution,
diversity, and increased plasticity in eukaryotes. The
underlying biological processes of these associations were
highlighted by recent analyses coupling genomic and evolutionary data [1] that showed that a part of biological
adaptation and phenotypic novelty in a species is due to
the acquisition of functional systems from other species
in a mutualistic symbiosis. In the ultimate mutualistic
association, the symbionts are located in host cells and
are transmitted vertically through successive generations.
This kind of association was at the root of mitochondria
and chloroplast establishment in eukaryotes [2]. Similarly, associations between chemoautotrophic bacteria
(thiotrophic and/or methanotrophic) and invertebrates
are ubiquitously described in reducing marine ecosystems, such as mangrove mud, anoxic sediments, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps [3]. The symbiotic
relationship between chemoautotrophic bacteria and
invertebrates at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold
seeps, as well as the parameters influencing the regulation and variations of mRNA expression across individuals, remains poorly understood at the transcriptome
level, even though symbiotic organisms are the major
component of biomass in these ecosystems. Different studies have focused on the process of symbiont acquisition
and characterization of genes differentially regulated
between organisms at different symbiotic states [4-10].
These transcriptomic approaches are based on sequence
libraries and expression levels determined by real-time
PCR that are mainly descriptive and therefore do not give
information about the source of inter-individual gene
expression variations. For example, are these variations
due to the symbionts and/or environmental conditions?
Moreover, these studies were mainly conducted on
organisms under laboratory conditions to identify regulated genes and analyze their mRNA expression during
the process of symbiont acquisition. In their work, Voolstra et al. [9] followed gene expression of larvae of the
corals Acropora palmate and Montastraea faveolata after
exposure to Symbiodinium algal strains that differed in
their ability to establish symbiosis. They showed that the
corals’ transcriptomes remained almost unchanged during infection by competent symbionts, but were altered
by symbionts that failed to establish symbiosis. The
authors suggested that successful coral-algal symbiosis
depended mainly on the symbionts’ ability to enter the
host in a stealth manner rather than by provoking a more
active response from the coral host. Environmental factors, such as water temperature, had a major impact on
the symbiotic relationship between coral and zooxanthellae by compromising the acceptance of the symbiont by

the host during the acquisition step, and consequently,
variations in gene expression of the host were observed
[10]. These studies on symbiotic marine organisms provide evidence of the combined impact of symbionts and
environmental factors on the mRNA expression of the
host.
Hydrothermal vent mussels of the genus Bathymodiolus are distributed worldwide and often constitute a
major component of the fauna inhabiting hydrothermal
vents and cold seeps. The majority of hydrothermal and
cold-seep organisms developed a single endosymbiosis,
generally with sulfur-oxidizing (SOX) bacteria, though
occasionally with methanotrophs (MOX). Vent and seep
mussels harbor either a single endosymbiont strain, like
B. thermophilus (SOX bacteria) or B. childressi (MOX
bacteria) [11,12], or possess a double symbioses with
both SOX and MOX bacteria, such as B. brooksii, B.
heckerae, B. azoricus and B. puteoserpentis [13-16]. In
contrast to gutless chemosymbiotic organisms in which
the relationship with bacteria is obligatory, these mussels possess a functional digestive tract and isotope analyses have shown that they are able to obtain food by
suspension feeding when necessary [17-19]. Moreover,
Fisher and Childress [20] used both stable isotopes and
histology to demonstrate that nutrient transfer from
symbionts to mussel tissues results from the digestion of
symbionts rather than nutrient translocation. The phylogeny of symbionts, especially those of both vent and
seep mussels, has been thoroughly studied [15,21,22], as
well as their (co-) localization in gill filaments
[15,21-23]. Large genome- and transcriptome-scale analyses of hydrothermal vent host organisms have so far
been done on symbiosis in tubeworms [4,6] and heat
adaptation [24-26]. No such studies have been done on
symbiosis in tubeworms [4,6] and heat adaptation
[24-26]. No such studies have been done on Bathymodiolus symbiosis, despite its importance in hydrothermal
vent ecosystems.
In the context of investigating chemoautotrophic symbiosis in vent taxa, we focused on the effect of both
environmental factors and symbiont content on the
established double symbiosis of vent mussels at the transcriptome level. Our approach combined the analysis of
microarrays comprised of differentially expressed genes
determined through suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) between hydrothermal vent mussels of B.
azoricus inhabiting two different vent fields of the MidAtlantic Ridge (MAR) - different in depth, fluid temperature, pH, and metal and methane concentrations.
Our objective was to determine the effects of symbiont
quantity and type, as well as environmental factors, on
host gene expression at the transcriptome level in order
to identify clusters of genes involved in the maintenance

Results
Quantification of symbiont-specific gene expression

Real-time PCR measured significant differences (P <
0.05) of both MOX and SOX quantities, and of symbiont-specific gene expression of ATP sulfurylase and
monooxygenase A (pmoA), between the three vent
fields: Menez Gwen (MG), Lucky Strike (LS) and Rainbow (Rb) (Table 1, Figure 1). Mussels collected at MG
had a higher SOX content (273) and ATP sulfurylase
expression (1.1 × 10-5) compared to mussels collected at
LS (167 and 8 × 10-6, respectively) and at Rb (119 and
4.5 × 10-6, respectively). Conversely, higher MOX content and pmoA expression were recorded in mussels
collected at Rb (209 and 0.29, respectively) compared to
mussels from MG (26 and 0.12, respectively) and LS (16
and 0.07, respectively).
Sequencing of subtractive libraries

The sequencing of the SSH libraries allowed the identification of 1058 unique, expressed genes distributed as

genes potentially regulated by symbionts and/or environmental parameters.
Gene expression according to vent site characteristics

To assess the influence of environmental parameters,
the ratio of expression of each gene was calculated by
dividing signal intensity of the gene for one given sample by the mean intensity of the gene in all samples in
both populations. Our analyses showed that 120 genes
(3.5% of all genes) are differentially expressed between
MG and Rb: 50 genes had higher expression at Rb
than at MG and 70 genes had higher expression at
MG than at Rb (Figure 3, list available in Additional
File 1: Tables 1, 2).
Gene expression according to quantity and type of
symbiont at a vent field scale

In order to identify genes potentially regulated by symbiont content and their respective activity, we conducted eight distinct analyses by classifying individuals
according to their MOX and SOX content and ATP
sulfurylase and pmoA expression levels for each population separately. For this study, the ratio of expression
of each gene was calculated by dividing signal intensity
of the gene for one given sample by the mean intensity
of the gene in all samples from the same population.
Our analyses indicated that symbiont quantity did not
significantly affect the number of regulated genes
(Table 2). One exception was observed for MOX quantity at MG, where a high MOX content regulated more
genes than in mussels with a low MOX content (285

vs. 180, Table 2). We further analyzed the genes commonly regulated by both symbionts within each site.
At the MG vent field, only 1% of all genes were regulated by SOX and MOX (Table 3), while 5.6% were
regulated in mussels collected at Rb (Table 2). Interestingly, MOX symbiont impacted a higher proportion
of genes than SOX in both vent fields (14-20% vs. 816%, Table 2), as well as genes commonly regulated by
each symbiont in the two vent fields (1.1% vs. 3% for
SOX and MOX, respectively, Table 2). A list of regulated genes in all conditions is available in Additional
File 1: Tables 3-14. Regarding symbiont gene expression, we obtained a result in accordance with symbiont
quantity at each site: ATP sulfurylase expression is
higher at MG where SOX are abundant and pmoA
expression is higher at Rb where MOX are abundant
(Table 1, Additional File 1: Tables 15-26).

Discussion
Deciphering effects of symbionts and environmental factors on gene expression in field populations of symbiotic
organisms is an important goal in molecular ecology. In
the case of the vent mussel B. azoricus, genes regulated
and/or involved in its symbiotic relationship with two
symbionts were unknown. To address this issue, we used a
combination of subtractive libraries and a cDNA microarray approach to characterize putative differentially
expressed genes in the hydrothermal vent mussel B. azoricus inhabiting two physically and chemically contrasting
vent fields. Then, we determined if the expression of these
differentially expressed genes was, in part, influenced by
symbiont content and/or symbiont metabolism, and/or
environmental factors. Because we used mussels collected
in their natural environment, we did not expect to identify
genes involved in the establishment of symbiosis, but
rather genes involved in an established symbiosis that
were differentially regulated with respect to symbiont type,
quantity and activity, and environmental factors.
Vent field environmental conditions impact activity and relative
abundance of both symbionts as well as host gene expression

content across the two vent fields. The relative abundance of the two symbionts is influenced by the hydrothermal fluid characteristics, especially methane and
sulfide concentration. This correlation explains, for
example, the higher abundance of MOX in mussels collected at Rb vent field where high concentrations of
methane were detected [27,28], compared to individuals
from the MG vent field [14,15,23]. The average quantity
of each symbiont was significantly different between the
two vent fields, but we observed a large inter-individual
variation in symbiont abundance within each field. This
symbiotic plasticity allows mussels from one vent field
to harbor the same amount and/or proportion of symbionts as mussels from another field. Mussels from each
vent field were collected in a restricted area of the mussel bed, but given the highly chaotic mixing conditions
encountered at hydrothermal vents, we have to consider
variations in both sulfide and methane availability, even
at the scale of the sampling patch. These variations in
gas availability in vent fields impact the distribution and
diet of vent fauna at a micro-spatial scale [19] and may
explain these differences in symbiont content.
The symbiotic vent mussel B. azoricus inhabits a variable
environment due to the highly chaotic mixing of hydrothermal fluid with seawater within the site [29,30], and
because of the bathymetric position of these hydrothermal
fields [31]. Thus, a strong effect for environmental factors
was expected due to the very different characteristics of
the vent fluid in the two populations sampled (especially
gas and heavy metals concentrations, temperature and
pressure), and therefore specific signatures of the mRNA
expression in mussels were expected for the different vent
fields. Our microarray data showed that 120 genes (3.5%
of all genes) clearly distinguish both sites, indicating a relatively moderate effect of source vent on transcriptome regulation. However, cluster analysis of all individuals showed
a clear separation between samples from MG and Rb, indicating that the physical characteristics of the two vent
fields were strong enough to influence transcriptome
expression in a way that distinguishes populations.

Among the up-regulated genes in mussels collected at
the Rainbow vent field, we identified a 60S acidic ribosomal protein and a selenoprotein. The 60S acidic ribosomal protein, known as a P protein, is mainly
associated with the protein elongation step of translation, but potential roles in transcription, DNA repair
[32], in response to pesticide exposure [33], and in
intracellular iron sequestration [34] have also been
described. The selenoprotein has multiple functions
such as antioxidant defense, selenium transport and
heavy metal chelation [35]. Up-regulation of these genes
in mussels from the Rb vent field is consistent with the
high metal concentrations at this site, the highest
observed in the MAR hydrothermal area [27,36].
Among the genes significantly up-regulated in mussels
collected at the MG vent field, we identified some metabolic genes such as arginine kinase and carbonic anhydrase (CA). Arginine kinase is known to play a key role
in cellular energy metabolism in invertebrates [37] and
its regulation in response to temperature has been previously described in B. azoricus [25]. Carbonic anhydrase
is known to be involved in the transfer of CO2 from the
environment to the cell in many symbiotic animals. This
enzyme catalyzes the reversible hydration of CO2, and
was found to be regulated at the transcriptome level
according to the state of symbiosis, in both plants and
animals [38], but also in B. azoricus in response to temperature variations [25].
Regarding the limited number of known genes and the
lack of experimental studies performed on B. azoricus in
response to various stressors, as well as the lack of
information about the micro-environmental characteristics around mussels (especially for concentrations of
H2S and CH4), it remains difficult to link these significantly regulated genes to environmental parameters.
Moreover, our sampling strategy of collecting mussels
directly from their environment did not allow us to
assess a cause and effect relationship. For example, we
cannot establish whether a change in environmental factors drives symbiont metabolism, and in turn host physiology; or conversely, if a change in environment
directly effects host physiology leading to a regulation of
symbiont population. This point will be discussed more
extensively below.
Do symbiotic bacteria drive gene expression in
Bathymodiolus azoricus?

Double symbiosis enables B. azoricus to colonize sulfide
and/or methane rich environments, in which the primary production of the symbionts ensures a part of the
host’s nutrition. Additionally, these mussels are able to
filter feed and can survive senescent vent conditions.
Mixotrophy is a major advantage in highly variable
environments. In the particular case of B. azoricus, the

Page 6 of 13

mussel has to host two different symbionts that are present in varying abundance in different individuals. The
identification of genes showing a similar regulation
according to SOX and/or MOX content in two contrasted populations should help to distinguish genes that
are mainly regulated by symbiont content from those
that are regulated by both symbiont content and environmental parameters. The microarray analysis showed a
relatively low number of genes significantly regulated by
either SOX (8%) or MOX (14%) content in the MG
population compared to the Rb population which had
16% regulated by SOX content and 20% by MOX content. These results suggest that symbiont content is less
influential on the transcriptome in mussels from MG.
However, because of the lack of studies on this particular dual-symbiont model, we have no information about
a potential competition between SOX and MOX symbionts, and in turn, how mussels control each kind of
symbiont. One could hypothesize that this difference is
partly due to the bathymetric position of the two vent
fields. We noticed that very few genes seem to be commonly regulated by both SOX and MOX content at
MG, only 1% of all genes, suggesting that each symbiont
may affect different pathways in mussels inhabiting this
vent field, compared to Rb where 5.6% of all genes are
commonly influenced by SOX and MOX content. The
MG vent field is located at a depth of 800 m versus
2300 m for the Rainbow vent field. Thus, the mussels at
MG benefit from a higher particle flux [39] which lessens the contribution to carbon nutrition needed from
the symbiont, and possibly also the impact of symbionts
on the host’s transcriptome. In contrast, the mussels at
the deeper Rainbow vent field experience lower particle
flux and rely more on symbionts to meet their carbon
needs. The pattern of gene expression obtained in this
study could reflect the relative carbon contribution of
symbionts compared to the availability of particles to
host nutrition.
While the number of sequences available for bivalves
has increased dramatically during the past few years
[40-43], very few genes are either fully annotated and/or
functionally characterised, often leading to a mean proportion of unknown sequences higher than 50%. In a
bivalve such as B. azoricus, it is particularly difficult to
find a relationship between the regulation of gene
expression and a symbiotic state, even if the gene was
described as involved in symbiosis-related functions in
other organisms. However, we identified several genes
previously described in host/symbiont relationships in
other marine models, such as the sea anemone Anemonia viridis [8], the squid Euprymna scolopes [44], and
the hydrothermal tubeworms Ridgeia piscesae and Riftia
pachyptila [4,6], and one could hypothesize that their
roles are potentially quite similar in hydrothermal

mussels. It is, for example, well established that participation of sugar residues and lectins is a major process
in host-microorganism recognition [45]. In this study,
we identified five lectins belonging to different families
and showing significant regulation according to symbiont quantity or activity. Lectins are known to bind
carbohydrate structures on foreign cells [46,47]. Previous
work conducted on corals [48] showed that specific lectins may bind to both pathogens and algal symbionts,
suggesting that lectins may have been co-opted from an
ancient innate immune system into a role of selecting
and maintaining the photosynthetic endosymbionts in
host tissues. In our analysis, we also identified a lysozyme and observed that this gene is more expressed in
mussels with a high SOX content (MG vent field). The
ancestral function of this enzyme is in defense against
pathogens by degrading bacterial wall [49,50], but its
implication in digestion in ruminants [51] and mollusks
[52] has also been demonstrated. Lysozyme is strongly
involved in the control and maintenance of the bacterial
flora in the aphid bacteriocytes [53] and in the digestion
of chemoautotrophic bacteria by their deep-sea bivalve
hosts [54]. This change of lysozyme function from antibiotic defense to digestion may have arisen through convergent evolution via positive selection [55]. An example
of such change has been recently identified in the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica in the i-type lysozymes
family [52]. The regulation of lysozyme and lectins in B.
azoricus agrees with previous observations, an indication
that these two gene families are potentially good candidates for proteins that might be involved in the control
and maintenance of symbionts. We also noticed the regulation of several genes directly or indirectly implicated
in immune defense and inflammatory reaction. Among
them are some receptors to melatonin [56], acetylcholine and laminin [57], synthaxin [58], kininogen, cystatin
[59] and prostaglandin E2 synthetase and receptor [60],
and all are significantly regulated by symbiont abundance and/or activity in B. azoricus. However, due to
the multi-functionality of these proteins coupled with a
lack of knowledge about their roles in hydrothermal
mussels, we cannot be conclusive about their respective
function(s) in the mussel/symbiont relationship. Complementary analyses of function and biochemical properties should help to determine to what extent these
proteins are involved in the breakdown of symbionts
and the elimination of microbial intruders in hydrothermal vent mussels.
The influence of bacteria on the cytoskeleton of host
cells has been extensively studied in both host-pathogen
interactions [61,62], and host-symbiont relationships
[44,63,64]. These studies showed that various pathogens
and symbionts increase their intimacy with the host tissues
by altering the host cytoskeleton. For example, several

Page 7 of 13

microfilament and microtubule proteins are strongly regulated at both RNA and protein stages during the establishment of the symbiotic association between the squid E.
scolopes and Vibrio fischeri [44,63]. In B. azoricus, some
genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins are differentially
regulated according to symbiont content, suggesting a
potential effect of symbionts on host cell structure.
Among these genes, five (tubulin, dynein, annexin, betathymosin and actin-related protein 2/3) present an interesting pattern of up-regulation in mussels hosting a high
symbiont content, especially those with a high MOX level.
Disentangling environment and symbiont effects on host
gene expression: what is the order of event?

We established that the expression of several genes is correlated with either symbionts (quantity and/or activity) or
environmental factors, but we were not able to determine
which factor is directly responsible for transcriptome variations in mussels. The analysis of the transcriptome of a
symbiotic organism often generates confusion when considering the combined effect of both symbionts and interrelated environmental factors. While they used a robust
experimental design, DeSalvo et al. [65] were not able to
determine if a thermal challenge changed coral (Montastraea faveolata) physiology which, in turn, induced a
change in symbiont type dominance, or if a thermal stress
directly changed symbiont type dominance and, in turn,
the physiology of the host. In our case, we could assume
that environmental factors directly influenced symbiont
abundance in mussels [present study; [23]]. But we also
observed a large inter-individual variation in symbiont
abundance (measured at both sites), indicating that environmental factors alone do not drive symbiont quantity,
but probably in association with host and/or symbiont
need and/or physiological state.
The expression pattern of several genes was also
ambiguous. For example, ferritins are significantly regulated by symbiont content in both populations of vent
mussels, and their regulation in host-pathogen as well as
in host-symbiont interactions has been previously
demonstrated [66,67]. But ferritins are also known to
play a pivotal role in iron homeostasis and the oxidative
stress response. In our study, ferritins are more
expressed in mussels harboring high SOX and MOX
content collected at Rb vent field, compared to MG
mussels in which ferritins are more expressed in low
MOX content mussels. In this case, it was not possible
to link the ferritin expression pattern to either symbiont
content or the high level of iron measured at Rb vent
field. A similar analysis applies to carbonic anhydrase
(CA). We showed that CA is regulated by environmental
factors (see discussion above). But, it has previously
been demonstrated that CA plays a major role in transport and supply of CO 2 to autotrophic symbionts

Boutet et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:530

housed in host tissues, such as in the two hydrothermal
worms R. pachyptila and R. piscesae [6,68-70]. In these
two species, the metabolism of the thiotrophic symbionts (sulphide oxidation) entails a fast and high production of protons, with which the worms have to cope,
partly by induction of CA at both the level of enzymatic
activity and mRNA expression. In our study, we
observed that CA is highly expressed in the mussels collected at MG in which a higher SOX content was
observed compared to Rb.

Conclusion
In this study, we derived a list of candidate genes whose
evolutionary trajectory in symbiont acquisition and host
mechanisms for symbiont content regulation can now be
explored. We also showed that in B. azoricus, the transcriptome appears to be regulated by symbiont content
with a strong effect of vent field characteristics. However,
we do not exclude that some of the genes in this study
identified as being regulated could also be associated with
parameters other than symbiont content and environment.
Sampling and transport to the surface can modify transcriptome expression. However, we submit that those
effects would be similar for all samples, mitigating their
effect on the analysis. Adaptive evolution at the molecular
level is more likely to be discovered from genes associated
with regulatory networks underlying the expression of
symbiosis related genes. Our study has produced a preliminary description of a transcriptomic response in a
hydrothermal mussel symbiotic model, which we hope can
help identify genes that progressively evolved to be
involved in the acquisition and regulation of symbiosis on
both ecological and evolutionary timescales.
Methods
Biological samples

The hydrothermal vent mussels, B. azoricus, were collected during the MoMARETO cruise [71] along the MidAtlantic Ridge with the N/O Pourquoi Pas? and ROV Victor 6000. Samples were collected at three vent fields, MG
(37°50’ N, 31°31’ W; n = 25), LS (37°17’ N, 32°17’ W; n =
30) and Rb (36°14’ N, 33°54’ W; n = 25), which have contrasting physical and chemical characteristics (Table 1).
Samples were collected at the end of the dive, kept in hermetic boxes containing vent seawater, brought onboard
about 1.5 hours later, and immediately measured and dissected to minimize sampling effect. Harvested gill tissues
were swiftly frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Detection of symbiont quantity and symbiont gene
expression by real-time PCR
Symbiont quantification

Genomic DNA of both mussel and bacteria was
extracted together from gill tissue using a CTAB/PVP

Page 8 of 13

extraction procedure (2% CTAB, 1% PVP, 1.4 M NaCl,
0.2%®-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM Tris HCl pH8, 0.1 mg.
mL-1 proteinase K, 1 mg.mL-1 lysozyme). After complete
digestion of tissues (1 h at 60°C), the mixture was incubated with 1 μL of RNase for 30 min at 37°C. An equal
volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was then
added and tubes were slowly mixed by inversion for 3
min before a 10 min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and
4°C. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube, and
DNA was precipitated with 2/3 volume of cold isopropanol (1 h at -20°C). The DNA pellet was recovered by
centrifugation (14,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min), washed
with 75% cold ethanol, air-dried and suspended in 100
μL of sterile water. Genomic DNA from muscle was
extracted by using the same protocol and used as a
negative control in real-time PCR amplification. The
relative quantity of symbionts was estimated by realtime PCR amplification using 16S specific primers
designed according to the probes developed previously
for FISH analysis [15] (Table 4). All experiments were
carried out using a Chroma4 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA) and 1× ABsolute™QPCR SYBR® Green mix (ABgene, Epsom, UK),
70 nM of each primer, and diluted DNA (2.5 ng) in a
final volume of 10 μl. A 120 bp-fragment of cytosolic
malate dehydrogenase gene (MDH) from the host was
used as an internal PCR control (Table 4). The relative
quantity of each symbiont type was estimated by using
the comparative Ct method using the formula: RQ = 2⊗Ct
(⊗Ct = Ct16S-CtMDH). No amplification of MOX or
SOX 16S was recorded when muscle genomic DNA
(negative control) was used in amplification reactions.
Significant differences in bacteria content between vent
fields were detected with a nonparametric WilcoxonMann-Whitney test with multiple test correction of
Holm [72] (R-language ‘stats’ package).
Symbiont gene expression

We study the expression of two bacterial genes, the ATP
sulfurylase which is specific to SOX and catalyses the
reaction of sulfate at the expense of ATP to generate
adenosine phosphosulfate and the particulate methane
monoxygenase pmoA which is specific to MOX and
involved in methane oxidation) was followed to estimate
the activity of each symbiont. Total RNA of both mussels and bacteria was extracted together from gill tissue
by using Tri-Reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Five μg of total RNA
were reverse transcripted using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), random hexamers
(Promega) and an anchor-oligo(dT) primer (5’CGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCT(17)-3’). The relative
gene expression of symbionts was estimated by realtime PCR amplification using specific ATP sulfurylase
and pmoA primers (Table 4; GenBank accession

volume of 4.6 μl of each diluted reverse transcription
product (1:20) was subjected to real-time PCR in a final
volume of 10 μl containing 70 nM of primers and 1×
ABsolute™ QPCR SYBR ® Green Mix (ABgene). The
amplification was carried out as follows: initial enzyme
activation at 94°C for 15 min, then 40 cycles of 94°C for
15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. A fragment of ribosomal
protein L15 gene (RpL15) from the host was used as an
internal PCR control (Table 4). Relative expression of
each gene was calculated according to comparative Ct
method using the formula: RQ = 2-⊗Ct(⊗Ct = CtATP sulf
or pmoA-CtRpL15). Significant differences in bacteria gene
expression between vent fields were detected by using a
non parametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test with multiple test correction of Holm [72] (R package).
Suppressive Subtraction Hybridization (SSH)

Mussels from three hydrothermal vent fields Menez
Gwen, Lucky Strike and Rainbow have been used in the
SSH design in order to optimize the chance to characterize genes potentially regulated by symbiont content
but also by environmental parameters. Total RNA was
isolated from frozen gill tissues with Tri Reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma). Four mussel
groups, named S+ (n = 3, high SOX content), M+ (n =
3, high MOX content), M- (n = 3, low MOX content)
and SM- (n = 8, low SOX and MOX content), were created based on their respective bacteria content (Figure
1) and used in the following suppression subtraction
hybridization (SSH) design: S+ ↔ M+, S+ ↔ M-, S+ ↔
SM-, M+ ↔ M- and M+ ↔ SM-, with S (+/-) and M
(+/-) designated the level of SOX and MOX, respectively. Poly(A+) RNA were isolated from each of the 4
pools of total RNA using the PolyATract® mRNA Isolation system (Promega) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The SSH were obtained by using the PCRSelect™ cDNA Subtraction kit (Clontech, Mountain

View, CA), amplified with Advantage® cDNA PCR kit,
and finally cloned into pGEM®-T vector (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The ligation
mixtures were used to transform DH5〈E. coli competent
cells and colonies were then grown in liquid ampicillinLB medium supplemented with 7.5% glycerol. Bacteria
cultures were transferred to 384-plates and the sequencing of a total of 3840 clones was performed at Genoscope (Evry, France) using an ABI 3730 automatic
capillary sequencer and the ABI BigDye Terminator
v.3.1 sequencing kit.
Sequence annotation

Prior to clustering and contig construction, the
sequence traces were analyzed and trimmed of low quality 5’ and 3’ extremities (quality value <15), using the
phred software [73,74]. Sequences were cleaned to
remove low complexity regions, short length (<100 bp),
and vector and adaptor sequence using seqclean [75].
Clustering and contig construction was performed using
the TGICL software from TIGR [75]. Contig and singleton sequences were compared to protein sequences of
the UniprotKB database [76] using BLASTX [77]. Coding frames were deduced from BLASTX best hit alignments (E-value ≤ 1e-03) and the CDS were created
according to the protocol detailed in Gagniere et al.
[78]. The protein sequences were then aligned to their
homologs using the PipeAlign toolkit [79]. Gene Ontology (GO) [80] annotations for the B. azoricus sequences
were provided by GOAnno [81] after analysis of the GO
terms mined from the protein family.
cDNA microarray preparation, hybridization and analysis

For this study, we used a microarray containing 3425
clones from B. azoricus: clones issued from the present SSH libraries and from a previous cDNA library
[41]. Protocols for slide printing, hybridization and
analysis of the microarray were carried out according

Boutet et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:530
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/530

to those established by the Plateforme Puces à ADN
(Biogenouest ® , Nantes, France, http://cardioserve.
nantes.inserm.fr/ptf-puce). All clones have been submitted to PCR and purified according to standard
protocols. Microarray slides were then printed with a
Lucidea Arrayer (Amersham) on Epoxy slides. Each
slide contained a total of 3425 features spotted.
Printed slides were stored in a dark cool dry location
until use.
Microarray hybridizations

A quantity of 20 μg of total RNA of each sample was
directly labeled by reverse transcription (using random
hexamer and dT primer) using a master mix containing
1 nmol of Cy5 or Cy3 dUTP (GE Healthcare). A loop
design was used (one individual from Menez Gwen vent
field against one individual from Rainbow vent field) in
order to generate a replicate for each sample (dye swap).
Following RT, single-stranded RNA was treated with
RNAse A. Then, RT reactions were cleaned using Illustra CyScribe GFX purification Kit (GE Healthcare).
Equimolar amounts of cDNA from both samples were
mixed in a single pool with hybridization buffer, boiled
for 2 min at 99°C then placed at 37°C for 30 min.
Hybridization took place in Corning hybridization
chambers overnight at 42°C. Microarrays were washed
once in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS followed by a rinse in 1×
SSC and two rinses in 0.2× SSC and finally dried by
centrifugation.
Microarray scanning and normalization

Slides were immediately scanned after centrifugation
using an Axon 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments Inc.)
with standard dual laser excitation at 532 nm (17 mW)
and 635 nm (10 mW) according to the following parameters: Cy 5 Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) 570 and Cy
3 PMT 610. This process was repeated for each of the
24 hybridized slides with a 5-μm resolution mode. The
images (16-bit TIF images) were then analyzed with
Genepix pro 5.1 software (Axon Instruments Inc.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The spot
density files output from GenePix Pro 6.0 were analyzed
by eyes to remove bad spots. The normalization was
then carried out using the programming language R/
BioConductor [82] and Limma library [83]. The background correction of the probe intensity was carried out
using the normexp method [84]. Then lowess normalization, intra- and inter-slide normalization were applied
to remove intensity dependent trends. Replicated values
of each gene were then averaged. The data obtained
from the microarray and used in the following analysis
have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), with the series accession number (under
process).

Microarray data analysis

All genes kept for analysis were used for hierarchical
clustering analysis using TmeV [85] (http://www.tm4.
org/mev.html) with Pearson correlation and complete
linkage clustering parameters. KMC support parameters
were used to identify clusters of genes that behave most
similarly in all samples. Differentially expressed genes
were identified by significance analysis of microarray
using a fold-change of 2. False-discovery rate is estimated by analyzing permutations of the measurements
and expresses the percentage of genes identified as significant by chance for a given value of a threshold parameter delta. This rate was manually adjusted to zero in
order to only include a reasonable number of candidate
genes with acceptable and well-defined error
probabilities.
