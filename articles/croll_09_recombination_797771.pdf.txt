Abstract
Background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important symbionts of most plant species,
promoting plant diversity and productivity. This symbiosis is thought to have contributed to the
early colonisation of land by plants. Morphological stasis over 400 million years and the lack of an
observed sexual stage in any member of the phylum Glomeromycota led to the controversial
suggestion of AMF being ancients asexuals. Evidence for recombination in AMF is contradictory.
Results: We addressed the question of recombination in the AMF Glomus intraradices by
sequencing 11 polymorphic nuclear loci in 40 morphologically identical isolates from one field.
Phylogenetic relationships among genotypes showed a reticulate network pattern providing a
rationale to test for recombination. Five statistical tests predicted multiple recombinant regions in
the genome of a core set of isolates. In contrast, five clonal lineages had fixed a large number of
differences.
Conclusion: Our data show that AMF from one field have undergone recombination but that
clonal lineages coexist. This finding has important consequences for understanding AMF evolution,
co-evolution of AMF and plants and highlights the potential for commercially introduced AMF
inoculum recombining with existing local populations. Finally, our results reconcile seemingly
contradictory studies on whether AMF are clonal or form recombining populations.

Background
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form symbioses with
the majority of plants and influence their species diversity
and productivity [1,2]. The symbiosis is thought to have
existed ever since the colonization of land by plants [3].
Growth of AMF is thought to be entirely clonal by producing asexual spores and no sexual reproductive structures
have been observed. Based on this fact, and the suggested
400 million years of morphological stasis [4], AMF were
suggested to be ancient asexuals [5]. But over the past decade, the question whether AMF are asexuals or exhibit
recombination has become a controversial issue [6,7].

Molecular evidence for recombination was previously
found by analysis of the highly polymorphic BiP and
rDNA sequences from Glomus intraradices and other AMF
[8]. Recombination was detected among sequence variants present within single isolates. Due to the multigenomic nature of AMF, recombination could have been
restricted to nuclei co-existing in the same cytoplasm,
without recombination of DNA from genetically different
individuals [9,10]. In populations of two related species,
arbitrary genetic markers showed significant evidence for
recombination [11]. Alternative explanations such as
recurrent mutations or sequences from contaminating

microorganisms could also explain these results because
the AMF were not cultivated in clean culture prior to analysis. In contrast, two studies suggested a strict clonal evolution in populations through analysis of multiple
polymorphic loci from spores of field populations
[12,13]. In the first study, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was scored for spores originating from
a single pot of a cultured AMF isolate. Genetic diversity
was found among spores but no evidence of recombination. The lack of replicate amplifications from single
spores makes it difficult to reach a definite conclusion.
Furthermore, the material originated for each species from
a single pot culture and the fungi may not have had the
opportunity to recombine with other genotypes from a
field. In the second study, clonal reproduction in AMF was
suggested by complete linkage of alleles at three loci
among spores of field populations. Ideally, a much larger
number of polymorphic loci should be investigated to
draw conclusions about recombination. Using field-collected spores directly for genotyping would provide a
more representative sample of the actual genetic diversity
in an AMF population than using in vitro fungal cultures,
as factors such as host plants used during cultivation
could bias the composition of successfully established isolates [14]. However, currently only the in vitro system provides the required DNA quantities from fungi grown
under sterile laboratory conditions necessary for reliable
genotyping at a large number of loci [15]. Croll et al. [14]
developed a set of 11 sequence-based markers to survey
genetic diversity and host plant preferences in a population of 40 G. intraradices isolates established in an in vitro
cultivation system. The genotyping was based on length
polymorphism at nuclear and mitochondrial loci and
sequencing of all loci in representative isolates was used to
confirm locus specificity of the genotyping method. However, length polymorphism data alone are not suitable for
recombination tests as length homoplasy of distinct
sequences could introduce a strong bias. Using sequence
information from all identified genotypes would allow a
variety of tests for recombination and could, therefore, be
used to challenge the fundamental assumption of ancient
asexuality in AMF [16].
In strict terms, members of a morphospecies of unknown
reproductive mode found together in the same location
should not be called a population, as interbreeding of
individuals is implied by the term population. For simplicity and in accordance with previous literature, we continue to use the term population to describe isolates of the
same AMF species found in one location.
In this study, we use multi-locus sequence data of one G.
intraradices population established in an in vitro system to
(1) resolve phylogenetic relationships among genotypes
that would indicate recombination or clonal evolution,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/13

and (2) use multiple sequence-based and population
genetics methods to test for recombination in AMF.
Detecting recombination in AMF would be important
because it would further our understanding of a main fungal phylum, could have important consequences for
understanding the co-evolution of AMF with plants and
could have far reaching consequences for the use of commercial AMF inoculum.

Results and Discussion
Multi-locus genotypes of G. intraradices population
We used a set of 40 in vitro cultivated isolates of G. intraradices originating from one population in Tänikon, Switzerland, to address the question of occurrence of
recombination in AMF. For reference, we included the isolate DAOM181602 originating from Québec, Canada. All
isolates were clonally subcultured to obtain sufficient
quantities of clean DNA [17]. Sequences of 11 polymorphic nuclear markers were used for a total alignment
length of 3037 bp. These markers were initially developed
to reveal sequence length polymorphisms and were identified using repeat-finding software. However, sequencing
of the different alleles showed that the large majority of
the detected polymorphism was found in regions flanking
the repeat motifs. We found 75 polymorphic sites and 72
indel mutations (for details on polymorphism at each
locus see additional file 1). The high degree of sequence
polymorphism identified within the population corroborates earlier data on polymorphism in coding regions
[18,19] and random genetic markers [17]. The distinct
combinations of alleles at the 11 loci identified 17 genotypes in the population (labeled I–XI and XIII–XVIII). Isolate DAOM181602 was a unique genotype not found in
the Swiss population (labeled XII). A sequence alignment
of all 11 loci from the 18 genotypes is available as additional files 2 and 3. Identifying organisms by multi-locus
sequence typing was pioneered by Maiden et al. [20] for
bacteria and successfully applied to fungi to e.g. infer
sources of human pathogen outbreaks [21].
Phylogenetic relationships among genotypes
We first estimated the phylogenetic relationships among
the genotypes to identify potentially recombining genotypes and clonal lineages. Then, a series of statistical tests
were performed on sequences from all genotypes to test
whether there is significant evidence of recombination in
the population. By applying a neighbour-network algorithm [22] reticulate paths connecting the core genotypes
could be observed (I–X, DAOM181602, XIII, XIV; Fig. 1).
A reticulate pattern suggests that recombination among
genotypes may have contributed to the evolution of the
genotypes, but multiple alternative mechanisms such as
lack of phylogenetic resolution or homoplasy may also
contribute to a reticulate pattern [23]. However, if recombination occurred within the population it is most likely

among the core group of genotypes connected through a
network (Fig. 1). The core genotypes weakly clustered into
two subgroups, but multiple branches connect the two
subgroups (I, IV–X and II, III, XIII, XIV, DAOM181602
respectively; Fig. 1). Five genotypes (XI, XV–XVIII) were
distinguished by a comparatively large number of mutations from the set of core genotypes with very high bootstrap support (100%; Fig. 1). Three more genotypes were
significantly differentiated from the core genotypes, but
branch lengths were considerably shorter (IX,
DAOM181602, XIV; Fig. 1). The reticulate pattern among
the genotypes was conserved if all indel polymorphisms
were excluded from the analysis (see additional file 4).
This confirms that potential recurrent mutations, due to a
higher indel mutation rate observed in repeat-rich
regions, do not qualitatively alter the results of the analysis. The reticulate pattern among the core genotypes was
still observed when the strongly differentiated genotypes
(XI, XV–XVIII) were excluded, and this further supports
the evidence of recombination (see additional file 4).

concatenation. In total, we used three different concatenation orders, two of which were random orders and the
third separates loci with strong signals of recombination.
We found that five isolates from the population (II, III, XI,
XIII and XIV) and the commercially cultivated isolate
DAOM181602 showed recombination breakpoints
detected by two or more tests in all three concatenation
orders. Furthermore, isolate XVIII showed recombination
breakpoints by at least one test in all three concatenation
orders. Isolate X did not show any recombination breakpoints in any of the concatenation orders. The graphical
results showing significant recombination breakpoints are
shown in additional files 5, 6, 7. Detailed results with significance thresholds for each predicted recombination
breakpoint of the concatenation order shown in additional file 5 can be found in additional file 8. The presented recombination breakpoint analysis is not suitable
to distinguish between intragenic recombination or reassortment of loci as sequences of individual loci are too
short to perform the tests on each locus separately.

Recombination detection in concatenated sequences
To examine evidence of recombination, we used multiple
sequence-based tests, because detection abilities can vary
strongly among tests depending on the degree of polymorphism and phylogenetic divergence of sequences
[24,25]. We performed six tests of recombination on concatenated sequences of 11 loci. The concatenation of loci
was necessary in order to overcome the limiting number
of polymorphic sites within individual loci. Firstly, we
used the Φw test that has been shown to reliably discriminate between recurrent mutations and recombination
[26]. The test uses a sliding-window procedure to assess
phylogenetic compatibilities of nearby polymorphic sites
in the concatenated sequences. A total of 72 sites were
informative and significant evidence of recombination
was found among the genotypes (p < 0.0001). We then
used two phylogenetic (Bootscanning and RDP) and three
nucleotide substitution based (Geneconv, MaxChi and
Chimaera) tests [27-32]. These tests had already been
applied to several fungal datasets in a critical analysis of
statistical power of different recombination tests [24]. As
sliding-window based tests are sensitive to the phylogenetic signals of neighbouring polymorphic sites, the concatenation order of our loci is likely to affect the detection
abilities of the different tests. A pair of concatenated loci
that would have been inherited clonally within the population is not expected to show evidence of recombination.
However, for a pair of concatenated loci that show a
reshuffling within the population, the tests are likely to
provide evidence for recombination (i. e. a significant
recombination breakpoint). As not all pairs of loci are
expected to show similar levels of clonal inheritance or
reshuffling, multiple concatenation orders are useful to
control for a potential bias through the arbitrary nature of

Congruence analysis among loci
Recombination creates conflicting phylogenies among
distant loci through reshuffling of DNA sequences among
different genomes. To test this prediction, we used a further, independent recombination test. The partition
homogeneity test creates artificial datasets by sampling
randomly among all observed sites of the genotypes and
then swapping sites among loci [33,34]. The length of
maximum parsimony trees for all loci are calculated and
summed. If recombination occurred among the genotypes
in the population, the actual summed tree length should
be shorter than the summed tree lengths based on the artificially created datasets, because recombination should
have introduced incongruence among loci. The partition
homogeneity test showed that the actual summed tree
length was 8 steps shorter than the shortest observed
summed tree length in the artificially created dataset (p <
0.001, Fig. 2). Results were qualitatively similar if all indel
polymorphisms were excluded (see additional file 9).
Such conflicts in phylogenetic congruence among loci are
most likely explained by recombination among the genotypes. The extent and frequency of recombination cannot,
however, be inferred from these results. Results from the
partition homogeneity test were shown to be sensitive to
bias in base composition and mutation rate across loci
[35,36], but as our study included individuals only from
one population, we expect this influence to be negligible.
Index of association among loci
The index of association measures the degree of linkage
among different loci. This test has been widely used to
detect linkage disequilibrium, following the initial application to bacterial genotypes [37]. In our study, we calculated the index of association for the complete set of

genotypes as well as for the two different subsets of genotypes. According to the phylogenetic relationships among
the 18 genotypes (Fig. 1), including all 18 genotypes in
the analysis of index of association would be unlikely to
reveal recombination because of a number of lineages
that appear not to recombine with the core isolates.
Indeed, analysis using all 18 genotypes revealed strong
linkage disequilibrium (IA = 4.076, p = 0.0001), suggesting
a population that deviates significantly from recombinant. If the five genotypes showing the strongest evidence for clonal evolution are excluded (see Fig. 1;
bootstrap value = 100%; genotypes XI, XV–XVIII
excluded) the linkage disequilibrium is no longer significant (IA = 0.226, p = 0.087). No linkage disequilibrium
was detected either (IA = 0.167, p = 0.183) if all significantly separated genotypes are excluded (see Fig. 1; bootstrap value > 90%; genotypes IX, XI, XII, XIV–XVIII
excluded), indicating that this subset of genotypes is
potentially recombining. Two previous analyses of index
of association in AMF populations showed opposite
results from each other, although they studied different
AMF species to those in the present study. Stukenbrock
and Rosendahl [13] found strong linkage among three
loci in three Glomus species, suggesting a strict clonal evolution. Vandenkoornhuyse, Leyval and Bonnin [11]

found no evidence for linkage disequilibrium in two
Glomus species based on ISSR loci. Our analysis showed
that in a partially recombining AMF population, choosing
various subsets of genotypes depending on the evidence
of clonality changes the outcome of linkage analyses, but
that groups of genotypes without significant linkage disequilibrium can indeed be detected.
Evidence for recombination in an AMF population
Taken together, the graphical and statistical tests of recombination strongly suggest that recombination occurred
among some of the genotypes in the field. The network
analysis of the genotypes does not provide direct evidence
for recombination, as other processes than recombination
could lead to a reticulate pattern [22]. However, the analysis suggested that a core group of genotypes are the most
likely candidates to have undergone recombination. The
index of association analysis showed that, indeed, the
strongest signal of recombination is among this core
group of genotypes. The analysis of phylogenetic congruence among all genotypes using the partition homogeneity test strongly suggested the occurrence of
recombination within the population. Furthermore, by
combining the results of the six sequence-based tests
using a sliding-window analysis, five isolates of the popu-

lation showed significant recombination breakpoints supported by two or more tests in all three tested
concatenations. Interestingly, the commercial inoculum
DAOM181602 grouped into the core group of recombining G. intraradices isolates, with evidence supported by
multiple tests. Recurrent mutations or homoplasy are
unlikely to explain these results as excluding indel polymorphism and using robust methods do not qualitatively
influence the results. A previous study of genetic diversity
in the same population used length polymorphism data
at the same loci as in this study to identify different isolates [14]. The reticulate relationships among the different
genotypes suggested the occurrence of recombination as
pointed out by Young [16]. However, complete sequencing of all loci in all genotypes and appropriate analyses
would be required to reach a clear conclusion [16].
Homoplasy in the dataset would artificially increase signals of recombination as a pair of genotypes showing alleles of identical length but distinct sequence at a particular
locus would be considered as potentially recombinant.
The present study was based on sequences from all loci
and all identified genotypes, therefore, allowing the control of size homoplasy. In future studies, data on genomic
locations of the different loci could elucidate the frequency of recombination events and distinguish between
inter- and intra-chromosomal recombination.
Genetic heterogeneity in AMF
An alternative hypothesis could potentially explain patterns of recombination in sequences, as in some AMF it
has been shown that isolates harbour genetically different
nuclei [9,10]. The previous use of linkage disequilibrium
analyses (i.e. index of association) on AMF spores using
AFLP were shown to be misleading if only genetic variation within isolates was considered [10]. The sensitivity of
fingerprinting techniques may artificially increase linkage
disequilibrium and potentially mask recombination.
Kuhn et al. [10] concluded that genetic heterogeneity
found among nuclei within isolates has most likely arisen
by accumulation of mutation, instead of recombination.
To avoid the potentially confounding factor of within-isolate variation, we deliberately chose markers that did not
reveal any significant within-isolate polymorphism (see
Supporting Information in [14]). We have found other
markers showing multiple alleles within single spore isolates. These were excluded from the analysis to rule out
confounding within-isolate recombination but are the
subject of further research. Thus, the genotypes included
in our study describe the unique, or at least the overwhelmingly predominant, nuclear genotype present in
each isolate. The evidence for this is that only single alleles
were found at each locus within isolates using capillary
electrophoresis (see Supporting Information in [14]). This
argues against a potential explanation that is an alternative to recombination, namely that differences between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/13

isolates arise as a result of shifts in the relative frequency
of pre-existing nuclear variants.
Clonal evolution and potential for cryptic speciation
Our study reveals that a five isolates of G. intraradices isolates show strong evidence for recombination. However,
we also identified five genotypes (XI, XV–XVIII) that were
distinguished by a comparatively large number of independent mutational events, suggesting a clonal evolution
in these lineages (Fig. 1). Statistical support for a clonal
evolution of these genotypes was shown by very high
bootstrap values separating these five lineages from the
core group of genotypes (100%; Fig. 1). Several statistical
tests identified putative recombination breakpoints in all
these genotypes. However, these findings were not corroborated by different concatenation orders (additional files
5, 6, 7). This suggests that recombination between these
latter genotypes and other genotypes in the population is
either absent or rare. However, a much higher sampling
effort in the field could yield genotypes that recombined
with those lineages. Very few morphological criteria are
known to distinguish isolates from the different clonal
lineages, but the clonal lineages show clear differences in
hyphal and spore densities produced in root organ cultures [17]. Furthermore, genetic differences among a subset of the currently studied AMF population were shown
to affect symbiotic functions with host plants [38].
Knowledge of the effects on host plants by different clonal
lineages and recombining genotypes would be important
to understand the potential effects of recombination on
AMF – host plant interactions. Recombination may have
reduced genetic and phenotypic differentiation among
the core genotypes, while clonal evolution in the separate
lineages may have led to the fixation of a large number of
genetic differences. In order to consider genotypes of different lineages as belonging to one biological species (i.e.
forming an interbreeding population), all individuals
should have the potential to undergo genetic exchange
among each other. Our data, however, suggests that several lineages are independently evolving and may give rise
to cryptic speciation.
Detection of recombination in supposed ancient asexuals
The detection of recombination in a population of AMF is
in strong contrast to the previous assumption of ancient
asexuality in the phylum of Glomeromycota. The main
argument for asexuality was based on morphological stasis over 400 million years, suggested by fossil evidence,
and a lack of observed sexual structures [3,5]. Together
with bdelloid rotifers and ostracods [5], AMF represent
what Maynard Smith termed "evolutionary scandals" as
accumulation of deleterious mutations and a slow rate of
adaptation should strongly disadvantage asexual reproduction in comparison to sexuality in the long term [39].
While several theories tried to address this issue, recent

Page 6 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:13

evidence suggests that very few true asexuals might actually exist [8]. A more likely scenario is that genomes of
most organisms undergo at least sporadic recombination
events to cope with the deleterious effects of long term
asexuality. Genomic signatures of recombination seem to
be more pervasive than previously thought [8], highlighting the fundamental role of sex in the evolution of
genomes.
Sexual reproduction and vegetative incompatibility
Sexual reproductive cycles involving the fusion of genetically different hyphae (i.e. mating) are thought of being
the main mechanism in fungi allowing recombination
among different genomes [40]. But the lack of laboratory
evidence of sexual structures involved in mating proved to
be inconclusive about the occurrence of recombination in
the species. Over the past decade, molecular evidence
strongly suggested the occurrence of recombination in a
number of fungal species that were presumed to strictly
reproduce clonally. The human pathogen Coccidioides
immitis, the pathogenic Aspergillus flavus and A. fumigatus,
as well as the ant cultivated fungi in the fungus-growing
ant symbiosis were all shown to undergo at least sporadic
recombination events or even to possess functional genes
required for meiosis [41-44]. In the case of Cryptococcus
neoformans, where a known sexual cycle exists, population
genetic structures were found to be almost completely
clonal. Nevertheless, reproduction between individuals of
the same mating type was shown to allow recombination
to occur [45]. In a related species, a similar mechanism
was shown to be at the origin of a major human pathogen
outbreak [46].

In AMF, vegetative incompatibility was shown to occur
when mycelia from different locations come into contact
[47,48]. Such mechanisms, in combination with a lack of
a known sexual cycle, were thought to exclude the possibility of recombination between genetically different isolates [49]. Our study suggests that these mechanisms need
to be further researched within AMF populations as they
are the most likely mechanisms allowing the mixing of
nuclei and subsequent recombination among different
AMF in the soil.

Conclusion
Evidence for recombination in AMF has further implications than simply to remove these fungi from the list of
putative ancient asexuals. Whether AMF are truly asexual
or form recombining populations is critical to understanding AMF co-evolution with plants. Stability in mutualism can be favoured by asexuality of one partner, but
this does not allow the symbiont to rapidly adapt to
changes in the host [50]. Our study, therefore, has consequences for understanding the evolutionary potential of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/13

this mutualism. Different AMF genotypes in the population have different effects on plant growth [38]. Recombination among different genotypes may, therefore,
produce AMF genotypes with novel effects on plant
growth. Furthermore, evidence for recombination in AMF
has an impact on commercially harnessing the beneficial
traits of AMF for increasing crop production. The assumption of commercial AMF inoculum use is that an introduced AMF will not recombine with the local population.
Our results highlight the potential that recombination
could occur with the native AMF population and, by this,
introduce new genes into the population. Finally, our
findings reconcile previously published studies as recombination and clonality were both detected in AMF.

Methods
Origin of fungal isolates
A total of 40 G. intraradices isolates using in this study
originated from an agricultural field site in Tänikon,
Switzerland [51]. The same set of isolates was used for
population genetic analyses using AFLP, simple
sequence repeat and mitochondrial markers [14,17].
Species identity of all isolates was verified by Croll et al.
[14] by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region
and subsequent comparison with deposited sequences
of the same species. The G. intraradices isolate
DAOM181602 originated from a field site at Pont
Rouge, Quebec, Canada (Biosystematics Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada). G. intraradices is widely used as a
commercial AMF inoculum for agricultural applications
(Premier Tech Inc., Canada) and is the first AMF isolate
to be entirely sequenced [52]. It is a haploid fungus with
a compact genome of 15 Mb and is the only AMF for
which ploidy has been measured [53]. Ploidy could be
different for other AMF species [54].
In vitro cultivation and DNA extraction
In vitro cultures of each isolate were established from single spores with Ri T-DNA-transformed carrot root on
standard M growth medium [55]. Five to ten two-compartment plates were inoculated by clonal subculturing to
allow the proliferation of the fungus in one compartment
that is kept root-free, while remaining connected to the
roots in the other compartment [17,56]. Root-free fungal
compartments of all plates were pooled per single spore
line for extraction of hyphae and spores. Freshly isolated
hyphae and spores of each isolate were separately dried
overnight at 48°C and ground into a fine powder using a
Retsch MM300 mixer mill (Retsch, GmbH). The DNA was
extracted using a modified version of the Cenis method
for fungal DNA extraction with an additional step of 1:1
dilution with a solution of 24:1 of chloroform isoamyl
alcohol before the final precipitation, to remove remaining impurities [57].

PCR amplification of polymorphic loci
We applied tests of recombination on 18 different G.
intraradices genotypes that were identified by Croll et al.
[14] on the basis of variation at 11 nuclear loci. In the
Swiss population, 17 genotypes were identified. The isolate DAOM181602 showed a unique genotype. Ten loci
were shown to contain short regions of repetitive DNA,
indel polymorphism and SNPs in the flanking regions of
the repeats (see Supplementary Material in Croll et al.
[14]). In addition, one nuclear gene intron was used [14].
The function of the gene is currently unknown. Each
marker revealed only one allele per single spore isolate
[14]. We identified other markers with multiple alleles per
isolate but chose not to include these in the analysis to
avoid confounding potential intra-isolate recombination
with among isolate recombination (data unpublished).
Croll et al. [14] identified alleles at each locus based on
length differences and sequenced each allele that was seen
to be different due to length polymorphism. For this
study, we extended the sequencing, by sequencing all 11
loci in all the 18 genotypes identified by Croll et al. [14]
so that any additional polymorphisms that were not
based on length differences could be detected and also to
check whether alleles with the same length in different
isolates were also the same sequence. PCR amplifications
were performed according to Croll et al. [14]. PCR products were purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit
(Qiagen, Inc.). Purified and quantified PCR products were
directly cycle sequenced with BigDye Terminator v1.1
(Applied Biosystems, Inc.) following the supplier's
instructions. Cycle sequence products were purified by
ethanol precipitation. An ABI PRISM™ 3100 Genetic Analyzer was used for automated sequencing. All sequence
profiles were visually checked using 4 peaks software (A.
Griekspoor and T. Groothuis, http://mekentosj.com/
4peaks). Sequences of all loci were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm implemented CLCbio Free Workbench
4.0 software http://www.clcbio.com and alignments were
checked manually. Independent PCR and re-sequencing
of alleles was performed to check for potential genotyping
errors for all loci and in several isolates. No sequence variation was found in these tests. Identical labels (roman
numerals I–XVIII) were used to name the genotypes as in
the previous study [14]. The sequences at all 11 loci of the
18 genotypes were deposited: locus Bg32 [GenBank:
EU534209–26]; Bg42 [GenBank: EU534227–44]; Bg62
Bg196

Phylogenetic analysis and tests for recombination
The neighbour-net algorithm implemented in SplitsTree
4.8 was used to construct a network based on the uncorrected p distance using concatenated sequences of all loci
[22]. The robustness of the branching pattern was assessed
with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Analyses were performed
in two ways: (1) coding indel and repeat polymorphisms
with Gapcoder using 1/0 to code for presence or absence
of gaps in the alignment [58] and (2) ignoring all indel
polymorphisms (see additional file 4). Ignoring gaps
reduces the risk of including polymorphisms that may be
due to recurrent mutations occurring in short repeat
motifs, confounding potential signatures of recombination. Nevertheless, the majority of indel mutations are not
in repetitive stretches of DNA and are, therefore, unlikely
to be recurrent mutations.

Following Posada [24] and Posada and Crandall [30], we
applied several recombination tests to evaluate the robustness of our results. To test for evidence of recombination
based on phylogenetic compatibilities of nearby polymorphic sites along concatenated sequences, the Φw test
implemented in Splitstree 4.8 was used [26,59]. The test
was run with the default settings of a window size of 100
and k = 2. Five additional recombination tests were run in
order to predict putative recombinant regions in the concatenated sequences: (1) Geneconv [29,32] was performed scanning sequence triplets and treating indel
blocks as single polymorphisms. (2) MaxChi [28] was
used to scan all possible sequence triplets with 30 variable
sites per window, alignments gaps (indels) were not considered as this could generate false positives [27]. (3) General recombination detection (RDP test implemented in
RDP software; [27]) was performed with a window size of
10 and without specifying a reference sequence. (4) Bootscanning [31] was used with a window size of 100 and a
step size of 20, standard distances were used for calculations and p values were binomial. (5) Chimaera [30] is a
modification of the MaxChi test and was run with 30 variable sites per window. All five tests were run with RDP
v2.08 [27], setting the significance threshold to p = 0.05.
Multiple comparison corrections were performed by a
Bonferroni correction [27].
Partition homogeneity test
The partition homogeneity test [33,34] implemented in
PAUP 4.0b10 [60] was used to estimate the degree of
incongruence among loci created by recombination. To
compare the degree of incongruence, 1000 datasets were
artificially created by re-sampling all sites without replacement, regardless of the loci boundaries. The summed tree
length of the maximum parsimony trees of each locus
found for the original dataset was compared to the
summed tree lengths of the maximum parsimony trees of
each locus for the artificially created dataset. Firstly, the

analysis was performed giving equal weight to substitutions and indel polymorphisms, giving a total of 77 parsimony-informative sites. An additional 70 variable sites
were parsimony-uninformative. Secondly, the analysis
was performed considering only substitutions in the
sequences. This provided 32 parsimony-informative characters and 43 parsimony-uninformative characters (for
results see additional file 9).

Summary of five recombination tests based on the concatenated
sequences of 11 nuclear loci. Loci are concatenated arbitrarily according
to the locus labelling. For individual tests, recombinant regions can overlap as all significant recombinant regions were kept in the analysis. Significance was based on p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. For
exact p values for all putative recombinant regions see additional file 2.
The total alignment length is 3037 bp.

Index of association
The index of association (IA) measures the degree of linkage equilibrium among a set of genotypes. IA = VO/VE -1,
where VO is the observed variance of the number of loci
being different within all pairs of genotypes and VE is the
variance of the number of loci being different within all
pairs of genotypes expected under complete linkage equilibrium. Therefore, IA = 0 if genotypes recombine freely.
The IA and the significance threshold of a deviation from
linkage equilibrium (with 10'000 randomizations) were
calculated with the program MultiLocus v1.3b developed
by P.-M. Agapow and A. Burt [61].
