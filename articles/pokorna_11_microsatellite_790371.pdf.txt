heterochromatinization in two lizard species

Lacertidae: Eremias velox)

Abstract
Background: The accumulation of repetitive sequences such as microsatellites during the differentiation of sex
chromosomes has not been studied in most squamate reptiles (lizards, amphisbaenians and snakes), a group which
has a large diversity of sex determining systems. It is known that the Bkm repeats containing tandem arrays of
GATA tetranucleotides are highly accumulated on the degenerated W chromosomes in advanced snakes. Similar,
potentially homologous, repetitive sequences were found on sex chromosomes in other vertebrates. Using FISH
with probes containing all possible mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide sequences and GATA, we studied the genome
distribution of microsatellite repeats on sex chromosomes in two lizard species (the gecko Coleonyx elegans and
the lacertid Eremias velox) with independently evolved sex chromosomes. The gecko possesses heteromorphic
euchromatic sex chromosomes, while sex chromosomes in the lacertid are homomorphic and the W chromosome
is highly heterochromatic. Our aim was to test whether microsatellite distribution on sex chromosomes
corresponds to the stage of their heteromorphism or heterochromatinization. Moreover, because the lizards lie
phylogenetically between snakes and other vertebrates with the Bkm-related repeats on sex chromosomes, the
knowledge of their repetitive sequence is informative for the determination of conserved versus convergently
evolved repetitive sequences across vertebrate lineages.
Results: Heteromorphic sex chromosomes of C. elegans do not show any sign of microsatellite accumulation. On
the other hand, in E. velox, certain microsatellite sequences are extensively accumulated over the whole length or
parts of the W chromosome, while others, including GATA, are absent on this heterochromatinized sex
chromosome.
Conclusion: The accumulation of microsatellite repeats corresponds to the stage of heterochromatinization of sex
chromosomes rather than to their heteromorphism. The lack of GATA repeats on the sex chromosomes of both
lizards suggests that the Bkm-related repeats on sex chromosomes in snakes and other vertebrates evolved
convergently. The comparison of microsatellite sequences accumulated on sex chromosomes in E. velox and in
other eukaryotic organisms suggests that historical contingency, not characteristics of particular sequences, plays a
major role in the determination of which microsatellite sequence is accumulated on the sex chromosomes in a
particular lineage.

Background
The evolution of sex chromosomes from autosomes has
been documented many times in different organisms [1];
recently reviewed e.g. in [2]; but see e.g. [3]]. During
their evolution, sex chromosomes go progressively
through several steps. Briefly, the first step is the acquisition of sex determining locus or loci. Subsequently,
the genetic content of both members of the pair diverge.
The specialization of sex chromosomes for their sexspecific roles [e.g. [4]] selects for the reduction of the
interchange of genetic material between sex chromosomes and thus for lower levels of recombination. However, lack of recombination leaves the unpaired sex
chromosomes (Y and W) without the possibility to correct mutations in coding sequences, which leads to an
unusually low content of functional genes. Moreover,
cessation of recombination opens doors for the accumulation of various repeats on sex chromosomes (e.g.
microsatellites, transposons, rDNA sequences; [5]).
Alternatively, the accumulation of repetitive sequences
may not be a consequence of reduced recombination,
but its cause [6]. By generating asynchrony in the DNA
replication pattern of X and Y, respectively Z and W
chromosomes, it can reduce the crossing-over frequency
between them [e.g. [7]]. The accumulation of repeats on
a heterogametic sex chromosome (Y or W) may be so
massive that the chromosome is finally much larger
than its homologous counterpart in the pair. The heterogametic sex chromosome may even become the largest chromosome in the genome such as the Y
chromosome in the plant Silene latifolia [[8], [9]]. On
the other hand, in some lineages, heterogametic sex
chromosomes may progressively decrease in size [e.g.
[10]] and such degeneration can result in their elimination from the genome [e.g. [11]]. In yet other cases, sex
chromosomes may stay homomorphic for a long evolutionary time [e.g. [10,12,13]]. In many organisms, the
heterogametic sex chromosome has been found to be
highly heterochromatinized [e.g. [12,14]]. The heterochromatinization may be a mechanism for the defence
against the activity of transposable elements or other
repetitive sequences to safeguard genome integrity [e.g.
[15,16]].
Squamate reptiles, the lineage encompassing lizards,
snakes and amphisbaenians, represent an interesting
group for the exploration of the evolution of sex chromosomes, as they possess substantial variability in sex
determining mechanisms [17-19]. Squamate reptiles
include species with environmental sex determination, i.
e. without sex chromosomes; species with homomorphic
sex chromosomes, and those with heteromorphic sex
chromosomes. All three situations can be found even in
a single family, for example in dragon lizards or eye-lid

geckos [20-22]. Sex chromosomes are at various stages
of the general process of sex chromosome evolution in
different squamate species and they evolved within
squamates independently several times as supported by
differences in their size, shape and type (male or female
heterogamety) but also by molecular-cytogenetic tests of
synteny of sex chromosomes and phylogenetic distribution of sex determining systems [10,19,20,23].
At the time of submitting, to our knowledge, the accumulation of repeats during the degeneration of sex chromosomes has been studied only in a single lineage of
squamate reptiles, in that of snakes [7,24,25]. Pythons,
the group in the rather basal position of snake phylogeny [26], with homomorphic sex chromosomes, do not
show any accumulation of repeats, while the degenerated W sex chromosomes in many advanced snakes
from the crown clade Colubroidea such as colubrids or
elapids, exhibit a massive accumulation of repeats
[24,25]. For example, the W chromosome in an elapid
snake Notechis scutatus is composed almost entirely of
repetitive sequences, including 18S rDNA and the
banded krait minor-satellite (Bkm) repeats [26]. The
Bkm repeats consist of tandem arrays of 26 and 12
copies, respectively, of two tetranucleotides, GATA and
GACA [27]. Bkm-related repeats are also accumulated
on the heterogametic sex chromosomes in many vertebrates, including humans, and also in plants [28-33]. It
was speculated that the Bkm-related repeats are functional, playing a role in the transcriptional activation of
sex chromosome heterochromatin [7]. A common origin
of the Bkm-related repeats across different eukaryotic
lineages was assumed [e.g. [34]], however, a convergent
evolution is also likely [35]. Recently, based on the
results of chicken W chromosome painting in snakes,
O’Meally and colleagues [25] concluded that heterogametic sex chromosomes in birds and derived snakes
may share repetitive sequences. They suggested that this
observation could be explained by yet undetected synteny of parts of the sex chromosomes between these
lineages. The homology of repetitive sequences accumulated on sex chromosomes could be tested by the evaluation of the identity of repeats on sex chromosomes
in other lineages of squamates phylogenetically nested
between snakes, birds and vertebrates with the Bkmrelated repeats.
The aim of the present study is to compare the distribution of microsatellite sequences on differently differentiated sex chromosomes in two lizard species with
independently evolved sex chromosomes and to determine whether the distribution of microsatellite repeats
on sex chromosomes corresponds to the stage of their
heteromorphism or heterochromatinization. Multiple
sex chromosomes (X1X1X2X2/X1X2Y) are heteromorphic

Pokorná et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:90

and fully euchromatic in the first studied species, the
gecko Coleonyx elegans from the family Eublepharidae
[21]. On the other hand, the ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes
in the second species, Eremias velox from the family
Lacertidae, are homomorphic and the W chromosome
is highly heterochromatic [36]. Moreover, the gekkotan
lizards represent one of the basal groups of squamate
reptiles, while lacertids are much more closely related to
snakes [37]. The knowledge of repetitive sequences on
the sex chromosomes in the two selected species should
therefore be informative for the determination of the
homology of the Bkm-related and other repeats across
vertebrate lineages.

Methods
The lizard individuals involved in the study were captive
bred animals maintained in the breeding room at the
Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Czech
Republic (accreditation No. 24773/2008-10001). The
procedures on animals were held under the approval
and supervision of the Ethical Committee of the Faculty
of Science, Charles University in Prague (permission No.
29555/2006-30). Metaphase chromosome spreads were
prepared from cultures of whole blood from a male of
C. elegans and a female of E. velox following the protocols described by Ezaz and colleagues [14] with slight
modifications. C-banding was performed following the
method described by Pokorná and colleagues [21].
Oligonucleotides containing microsatellite sequences
were directly labelled with Cy3 at the 5’ end during
synthesis by VBC-Biotech (Wien, Austria). All possible
mono- (d(A)30, d(C)30), di- (d(CA)15, d(GA)15, d(GC)15,
d(TA) 15 ), and tri-nucleotides (d(CAA)10 , d(CAG)10 , d
(CGG)10, d(GAA)10, d(CAC)10, d(CAT)10, d(GAC)10, d
(GAG) 10 , d(TAA) 10 , d(TAC) 10 ) and d(GATA) 8 were
used. The tetranucleotide was included to test for the
presence of the Bkm-related repeats. Slide denaturation
was performed in 7:3 (v/v) formamide:2xSSC for two
minutes at 72°C, then the slides were dehydrated using
50%, 70% and 100% ethanol (-20°C) serie and air-dried.
The probes were denatured at 70°C for 10 minutes in a
mix containing 50% formamide (v/v), 2xSSC and 10%
dextransulfate (w/v) and subsequently applied to the
slides, covered with plastic coverslips, and hybridized for
18 hours at 37°C. The slides were washed at room temperature twice for 5 minutes in 2xSSC and twice for 5
minutes in 1xSSC. The slides were analysed using an
Olympus Provis microscope and the image analysis was
performed using ISIS software (Metasystems). The FISH
results were confirmed in at least three different metaphases per treatment.
The heterogametic sex chromosomes in both studied
species of lizards are easily recognizable. The Y chromosome is the largest and the only metacentric

Page 3 of 7

chromosome in karyotype of C. elegans [21]. The W
chromosome of E. velox is an acrocentric chromosome
of similar size to the Z chromosome, but only the W is
conspicuously DAPI-positive [23].

Results
There was no accumulation of mono-, di-, tri-nucleotides or GATA repeats detected on sex chromosomes in
C. elegans. All tested sequences showed relatively uniform distribution throughout the genome of this species.
Strong accumulations of several microsatellites were
detected either on the W chromosome or on some
autosomes in E. velox (Figure 1). The W chromosome
showed an interspersed distribution pattern of microsatellite sequences typical for the Z chromosome and
autosomes only in three cases, i.e. in the probes d(C)30,
d(CAA)10 and d(GAC)10. The d(CGG)10 and d(CAC)10
sequences exhibited notable accumulations just on small
autosomes. Only in two cases (d(A) 30 , d(TA) 15 ) was
there a concurrently notable accumulation of microsatellites on the whole W chromosome and on two different pairs of autosomes. In all other cases, the W
chromosome showed a more highly distinct pattern
than the Z chromosome and all autosomal pairs. Some
microsatellites with tri-nucleotide motifs (d(CAG)10, d
(CAT)10, d(GAG)10, d(TAC)10, d(TAA)10) were extensively accumulated over the whole length of the W
chromosome, while three di-nucleotide repeats (d(CA)
15, d(GA)15, d(GC)15) were accumulated just in the centromeric parts of the W chromosome. Three microsatellite sequences (d(GA) 15 , d(GAA) 10 , d(GATA) 8 ) were
conspicuously lacking on the W chromosome, although
the signal was otherwise uniformly distributed across
the rest of the genome.
Discussion
The FISH patterns using the probes bearing microsatellite repeats in the two lizard species contrasted greatly.
The FISH experiments did not reveal a substantial accumulation of microsatellites neither on X1, X2 and Y sex
chromosomes nor on autosomes in the gecko C. elegans.
The Y chromosome is the largest chromosome in the
karyotype and certain parts of the Y and the X1 chromosome consist largely of repetitive elements. Specifically, both these chromosomes carry notable
accumulations of 28S rDNA repeats [Figs. two d, i in
[21]]. Nevertheless, these accumulations are restricted to
just nucleolus organizer regions (NORs), although
rDNA-related repeats have the potential to spread over
sex chromosomes [38]. Previously, through chromosome
painting, we documented that the Y and X 1 and X 2
chromosomes in C. elegans share similar DNA content
and concluded that sex chromosomes of this species are
only poorly differentiated [21]. The results of the

painting with the microsatellite probes further support
this conclusion.
The heterochromatinized W chromosome and some
autosomes show strong microsatellite accumulation in
the lacertid lizard E. velox (Figure 1). The distribution of
microsatellite sequences on the W chromosome differed

greatly in various microsatellites. We found enrichment
of some microsatellite sequences over the whole W
chromosome, while the accumulation of some sequences
(CA, GA, and GC repeats) was restricted to a part of the
W chromosome near the centromere. This unequal distribution could reflect constitutional characteristics of

Pokorná et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:90
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/90

individual microsatellites, e.g. their convenience for centromere formation; however, no accumulation of CA,
GA, and GC repetitive sequences was detected in the
centromeres of the Z chromosome and the autosomes
(Figure 1). Alternatively, the unequal distribution could
reflect an instantaneous stage of competition of individual microsatellite sequences over a limited number of
positions on the W chromosome. Some sequences are
present on the Z chromosome and autosomes, but they
are notably lacking on the W chromosome (Figure 1).
Generally, sex chromosomes at the earliest stages of differentiation mutually differ only in a small non-recombining sex-determining region and are otherwise similar
to autosomes [e.g.[4]]. Therefore, it seems likely that the
comparable distribution of these sequences on the
recent Z chromosome and on autosomes in E. velox
reflects the ancestral situation and that the sequences
were present on the W chromosome at an early stage of
its differentiation as well and were later replaced by
more successful sequences. The alternative explanations
on unequal distribution of particular repeats can be
tested by the reconstruction of evolutionary dynamics of
microsatellite distribution on sex chromosomes across
lacertids in future comparative analyses.
The microsatellite distribution in C. elegans and E.
velox corresponds to the general scenario of sex chromosome evolution. Sex chromosomes in C. elegans,
although heteromorphic, probably represent an early
stage of sex chromosome differentiation. The lack of
microsatellite accumulation on sex chromosomes in this
species is comparable to the situation on homomorphic
sex chromosomes in relatively basal snakes [7,25]. The
present study documents that the DNA content strongly
differs between the euchromatic Z and the heterochromatic W chromosomes in E. velox (Figure 1), although
the sex chromosomes are homomorphic in this species
and in many other lacertids [12]. Heteromorphic sex
chromosomes are not always simply more diverged than
homomorphic ones. The changes of DNA sequences
and of karyotype during the evolution of sex chromosomes can be quite different stories. However, in most
cases, the accumulation of microsatellites precedes the
evolution of the heteromorphy of sex chromosomes.
Heteromorphic sex chromosomes with accumulated
repeats, e.g. in the advanced snakes from the families
Elapidae and Colubridae [25], may represent only the
later stage of the evolution of sex chromosomes.
Members of many genera in the family Lacertidae
from both its subfamilies (Gallotiinae and Lacertinae)
have the ZZ/ZW sex-chromosome system with sex
chromosomes at various stage of differentiation
[12,39,40]. Phylogenetic distribution of species with
known sex chromosomes suggests that female heterogamety is ancestral for the family [e.g. [19]; cf. to

Page 5 of 7

phylogenetic relationships within the family in [39] or
[41]]. A molecular clock based on mitochondrial DNA
sequences indicates that the separation of the Gallotiinae and Lacertinae occurred around 20 My ago [39].
The mechanism keeping homomorphy of sex chromosomes in the lineage leading to E. velox and in other
lacertids for such a long time in the face of the highly
divergent DNA content of sex chromosomes is not
known.
The Bkm-related repeats containing tandem copies of
GATA sequence have been shown to be accumulated
on the sex chromosomes of various eukaryotes including
advanced snakes [25]. The GATA repeats are uniformly
distributed over the autosomes and sex chromosomes in
C. elegans, and the W chromosome of E. velox even
exhibits a conspicuous depletion of this sequence (Figure 1), which supports the independent origins of the
Bkm-related repetitions on sex chromosomes in snakes
and other vertebrates. O’Meally and colleagues [25] reasoned that as derived snake and bird sex chromosomes
share common repetitive sequences, this may be due to
the cryptic homology of parts of the sex chromosomes
between these lineages. However, no FISH signal on the
W chromosome was observed after hybridization of the
Bkm probe to chicken metaphase chromosomes in their
study. Moreover, sex chromosomes in snakes and birds
evolved from different autosomal pairs [10], and basal
snake and avian lineages have homomorphic sex chromosomes without an accumulation of repetitive
sequences [13,24,25]. The independent origins of repetitive sequences on degenerated W sex chromosomes in
both these lineages therefore seem more likely, especially when high dynamism of repetitive DNA is taken
into account.
Due to different biochemical characteristics, particular
microsatellite sequences should differ in their potency
to accumulate on sex chromosomes. We should then
observe an accumulation of the same sequences on
independently evolved sex chromosomes in different
organisms. However, the data accumulated so far does
not support this prediction. For example, among all possible trinucleotide sequences, tandem copies of CAA,
CAG, GAA and TAA showed the most notable accumulation on the Y chromosome in the plant Silene latifolia
[42]. However, out of these four sequences, only CAG
and TAA tandem copies are accumulated on the W
chromosome, while CAA repeats are uniformly distributed across all chromosomes and GAA repeats are even
lacking on the W chromosome in E. velox (Figure 1).
Similarly, the CGG repeats are accumulated on the Y
chromosome of the fish Hoplias malabaricus [43], but
they are missing on the W chromosome of the lizard. In
conclusion, various repetitive sequences follow very different trajectories on sex chromosomes in different

Pokorná et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:90

organismal lineages. The identity of particular microsatellite sequences accumulated on sex chromosomes
seems to largely reflect historical contingency.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our results support the view of sex chromosome evolution as a colourful myriad of situations
and trajectories where many processes, often opposing,
are in action. The evolution of DNA sequences and the
evolution of karyotypes can represent different stories of
the shaping of sex chromosomes. Microsatellite
dynamics can be tied rather to heterochromatinization
than to heteromorphism of sex chromosomes. Microsatellites are the most dynamic component of genomes,
and as non-recombining regions of the sex chromosomes give them the chance to expand here, their contribution to sex chromosomes dynamics is significant. It
seems that historical contingency, not the characteristics
of particular sequences, plays a major role in the determination of which microsatellite sequence is accumulated on the sex chromosomes in a particular lineage.
