Simian Foamy Viruses (SFVs) infect many non-human
primates, (NHP) by species-specific strain of SFV. Infection in humans occurs through zoonosis form NHP in
areas where hunting for bush meat is common, as in
Africa. To investigate natural retroviral infection of wild
Indian simians, blood samples were collected from
forested regions of Rajasthan state. Using degenerate primers from the pol region of retroviral genome, 3 out of
24 (~12%) wild rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) gave
positive signals. Direct sequencing of PCR products
revealed novel SFV infection of wild Indian rhesus macaques, M1, M2 and M4. The sequences were aligned with
known SFV sequences from various NHP species. The
SFV sequences from pol (Integrase) region had the characteristic core domain and the conserved zn finger
domains (His 2-Cys2). Pol sequences of SFV infecting
wild Indian rhesus macaques were 8-10% divergent from
available SFVmac sequences. Overall the novel SFV
sequences were related to other SFV sequences from
Genbank but formed a unique cluster in Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree. Close man-monkey interaction has
existed in India for centuries because of the religious
connotation of simians, but bush meat consumption is
not common except in some tribal populations from the
northeastern regions. Future investigation with specific
rather than degenerate primers will determine the actual
prevalence of SFV infection in wild simian population
from India. Similarly, analyses of blood samples from
humans with history of bleeding monkey bite at temple
and tourist sites will reveal if simian to human transmission of SFV exists in India.
