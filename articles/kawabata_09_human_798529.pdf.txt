Abstract
In general, enveloped viruses are highly dependent on their lipid envelope for entry into host cells.
Here, we demonstrated that during the course of virus maturation, a significant proportion of
human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) envelope proteins were selectively concentrated in the detergentresistant glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membranes (rafts) in HHV-6-infected cells. In
addition, the ganglioside GM1, which is known to partition preferentially into lipid rafts, was
detected in purified virions, along with viral envelope glycoproteins, gH, gL, gB, gQ1, gQ2 and gO
indicating that at least one raft component was included in the viral particle during the assembly
process.

Introduction
Glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEM) are organized
areas on the cell surface enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored
proteins. These areas have been described as "rafts" that
serve as moving platforms on the cell surface [1]. These
domains exist in a relatively ordered state, which confers
resistance to Triton X-100 detergent treatment at 4°C [2].
The infection of host cells by enveloped viruses relies on
the fusion of the viral envelope with either the endosomal
or plasma membrane of the cell [3]. Therefore, the protein
and lipid compositions of both the viral envelope and
host cell membrane play crucial roles in virus infection.
For all enveloped viruses, the envelope is derived from the
host cell during the process of virus budding. Many

viruses are known to utilize lipid rafts during budding.
Lipid rafts of the plasma membrane function as a natural
meeting point for the transmembrane and core components of a phylogenetically diverse collection of enveloped viruses [4]. The rafts are implicated as the areas of
the plasma membrane where human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly and budding occur in
infected cells [5,6]. In the case of influenza, budding takes
place at the apical plasma membrane and is heavily
dependent on the presence of lipid microdomains or rafts
[7-9]. Measles virus (MV) has also been suggested to use
raft membrane in its assembly and budding processes
[10,11]. The integrity and organization of cholesterol rich
membrane lipid rafts has been suggested to be critical for
ordered assembly and release of infectious Newcastle disease virus particles [12].

Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a beta herpesvirus and a
human pathogen of emerging clinical significance. HHV6 was first isolated from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with lymphoproliferative disorders
and AIDS [13]. HHV-6 isolates can be categorized into
two variants, A (HHV-6A) and B (HHV-6B); HHV-6B is
the causative agent of exanthem subitum [14]. Recently
we have shown that HHV-6 virion buds into TGN derived
membrane which has characteristics of late endosome
[15].

rum specific for HHV-6A gH were described previously[17]. The rabbit antiserum specific for HHV-6 gB was
described previously [15,18]. Anti-CD59 mouse MAb
(AbD serotec), anti-Linker for activation of T cells (LAT)
mouse MAb (upstate biotechnology), anti-human transferrin receptor (TfR) mouse MAb (Zymed laboratories),
anti-CD46 mouse MAb (Immunotech) and anti-CD3zeta
mouse MAb (Santa Cruz) were purchased. Cholera toxin
B subunit, type Inaba 567B, peroxidase conjugate was
obtained from Calbiochem.

Here we report that upon membrane fractionation, HHV6 envelope glycoproteins, glycoproteins H, L, Q1, Q2, O
and B (gH, gL, gQ1, gQ2, gO and gB) are present in the
detergent-resistant, GM1-rich fractions, confirming their
association with lipid rafts. In particular, the mature
forms of gQ1, gQ2 and gO, which are expressed only in
mature virions, were localized to the detergent-resistant
lipid rafts. In addition, HHV-6 virions incorporated the
lipid-raft-specific ganglioside, GM1, indicating that HHV6 virions may assemble through rafts.

Immunoblotting
The lysed proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane for immunoblotting. After being blocked, the
membranes were incubated for 1 h with blocking buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 0.15 M NaCl, 5% skim milk,
0.75% Tween 20) containing the MAbs or antisera. The
reactive bands were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary conjugate and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (GE Healthcare).

Methods

Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)
The IFA was performed as described previously [17].

Cells and viruses
T-cell lines (HSB-2 cells) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with
8% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HHV-6A strains GS were
propagated in HSB-2, and the titers of the viruses were
estimated using HSB-2 cells. HHV-6 cell-free virus was
prepared as described previously[16]. When HHV-6infected HSB-2cells showed evidence of more than 80%
infection by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), the cells
were lysed by freezing and thawing twice, and spun at
1,500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used as cell-free
virus. Nycodenz gradient-purified virions were obtained
as follows. HSB-2 cells were infected with HHV-6, and at
3–4 days postinfection (pi) the infected cells were combined with newly prepared cells for cell-cell spread of
HHV-6. At 3–4 days later, the cells were spun at 1,500 × g
for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant from the cells was
used for purification of virus particles. The viruses in the
supernatant were precipitated with polyethylene glycol
(PEG, molecular weight 20,000, 10%) in the presence of
NaCl. The viruses were re-suspended, layered over a gradient of 15–60% nycodenz (Sigma), and centrifuged for 1 h
at 27,000 rpm in an SW40Ti rotor (Hitachi). The fractions
were collected from the bottom. The fractions containing
virions were examined by analysis of viral DNA with PCR
using primer pair, AgB2232F (5'-acacctagtgttaaggatgttg)
and AgBR (5'-tcacgcttcttctacatttac), which could amplify
HHV-6A glycoprotein B gene.
Antibodies (Abs)
The monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against HHV-6A,
anti-gQ1 (AgQ1-119), anti-gQ2 (AgQ2-182), anti-gL
(AgL-3) and anti-gO (AgO-N-1), and the mouse antise-

Isolation of raft fraction
Raft fractions were prepared as described previously
[19,20]. Cells (1 × 108) were washed in PBS and then
lysed with 1 mM MES-buffered saline (25 mM MES, pH
6.5, and 150 mM NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 5
mM sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mM EDTA. The lysate
was homogenized with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and gently mixed with an equal volume of 80%
sucrose (w/v) in MES-buffered saline. The sample was
then overlaid with 6.5 ml of 30% sucrose and 3.5 ml of
5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline and spun at 200,000 ×
g at 4°C for 16 h. Following the centrifugation, the fractions were collected from the top of gradient. The fractions were analyzed on a Western blot.

Results
Association of HHV-6 proteins with rafts in infected cells
Raft membranes were isolated from HHV-6A-infected T
cells (HSB-2) and mock-infected HSB-2 cells using a flotation assay, based on their resistance to solubilization by
TX-100 at 4°C and buoyancy at low-density in fractions of
a bottom-loaded discontinuous sucrose gradient, with
steps of 5, 30, and 40% sucrose.

As shown in Fig. 1A, in mock-infected cells, the GPIanchored CD59 protein (a) and linker for activation of T
cells (LAT) protein (c) were mainly detected in detergent
insoluble fractions which indicate lipid rafts with strongest signal in fraction 4, while transferrin receptor (TfR)
protein (e) which is a nonraft marker, CD3zeta protein

Isolation1of raft membranes from HSB-2 cells; the detection of cellular proteins
Isolation of raft membranes from HSB-2 cells; the detection of cellular proteins. (A) Mock-infected HSB-2 cells.
Bottom-loaded sucrose step gradients (fraction 1 represents the top of the gradient) were analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblots of proteins from each fraction (equal volume loaded) were labeled with anti-CD59 (a), -CD3zeta (b), -LAT (c), -CD46
(d) or -TfR (e) antibody for cellular proteins. GM1(f), which migrated with the dye front, was detected by reaction with HRPcoupled cholera toxin. (B) HHV-6A, strain GS-infected HSB-2 cells. HSB-2 cells were infected with GS, at 4 days later, the cells
were combined with newly prepared cells, and the step was repeated. When HHV-6 infected HSB-2cells showed evidence of
more than 80% infection by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), the cells were harvested for the isolation of raft fractions. The
population of infection was examined by the expression of late proteins (gQ1, gQ2, gB and gL). P indicates pellet. The experiment was done three times independently, and one of three experiments was shown here. All of these blots came from the
same experiment, but the exposure time of each blot was not identical.

(b) and CD46 protein (d) were distributed broadly with
stronger signals in fractions 10–12 which are detergent
soluble fractions. The binding of the cholera toxin β subunit (CTx), which specifically detects the raft-associated
glycosphingolipid GM1 (f), was mostly partitioned into
fractions 3–5 with strongest signal with fraction 4. Therefore, the rafts were mostly recovered in fractions 3–5 in
mock-infected HSB-2 cells. Fig. 1B shows that in HHV-6Ainfected HSB-2 cells, CD59 protein (a), which is concentrated in lipid rafts was mostly migrated to fractions 4–5

and 11 with strongest signals in fractions 4–5. LAT protein
(c), which is concentrated in lipid rafts, was also detected
in fractions 4–5, 10,11 and 12 in infected cells. Similarly,
the raft-associated glycosphingolipid GM1(f), was partitioned into fractions 3–5, 11, 12 and pellet with the
strongest signals in fractions 4. Therefore, the rafts were
mostly recovered in fractions 3–5, especially in fraction 4
of HHV-6 infected cells, which we referred to as the raft
fractions. Insoluble cytoskeleton components and nuclear
remnants were recovered in the pellet at the bottom of the

tube. Interestingly, CD46 protein (d), which is a cellular
receptor of HHV-6, also migrated to fraction 3–5 with
strongest signal in fraction 4 after HHV-6 infection.
CD3zeta (b) and TfR (e) proteins were also detected in
fraction 4 with stronger signal in HHV-6-infected cells.
They may be migrated into raft fractions after infection.
These results showed that non-raft proteins could be
migrated into raft fractions after infection, suggesting that
the cellular machinery may be modified by HHV-6 infection.
Next, we examined the raft association of viral glycoproteins in HHV-6A-infected HSB-2 cells. As shown in Fig.
2A, a proportion of the HHV-6 envelope glycoproteins,
glycoprotein H (a), L(b), Q1(c), Q2(d), B(e) and O(f)
(gH, gL, gQ1, gQ2, gB and gO) colocalized with the raft
fractions (Fig. 2A). The distribution between DRM and
soluble fractions was quantitated by KODAK MI software
(Fig. 2B). Interestingly, although gQ1-74K, gQ2-34K and
gO-120K were broadly distributed in fractions, the mature
forms 80-kDa gQ1 (gQ-80K), 37-kDa gQ2 (gQ2-37K)
and 80-kDa gO (gO-80K) proteins that contain complex
type N-linked oligosaccharide and are expressed in
mature virions[17,21,22] were distributed in fraction 4
(14.1%, 8.9% and 7.1% respectively) in addition to fractions 11–12 (53.9%, 46.2% and 56.9 respectively), indicating that the mature forms of gQ1, gQ2 and gO colocalized with the lipid rafts. In contrast, almost of the
nonstructural protein, the immediate early 1 (IE1) protein
(g), which is mainly expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, was recovered from the soluble fractions (fractions
5–12) and the pellet, but it was rarely recovered from fraction 4 (1.3%).
Raft membranes are included in the HHV-6 envelope
HHV-6 obtains its lipid envelope from the host cell membrane during the maturation process of the virions. We
next investigated whether raft-associated HHV-6 proteins
contributed to HHV-6 envelope maturation and were
incorporated into the viral envelope. Viruses released
from HHV-6A-infected cells were purified twice by
nycodenz gradient. The fractions were collected from the
bottom. The fractions containing virions were determined
by analysis of viral DNA with PCR (Fig. 3B), and the
results suggested that the fraction 8 contained most abundant virions

As shown in Fig. 3A, the ganglioside GM1 (j) was detected
in fractions containing virions, similar to the other HHV6 envelope glycoproteins (Fig. 3A-a, b, c, d, e and 3A-f)
indicating that the HHV-6 envelope contains lipid rafts.
However, CD59 (h) and LAT (i), proteins that were
detected in the raft fractions of HHV-6-infected cells, were
not recovered from the virion fractions as well as IE1(g)

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/127

which is not a viral structural protein, indicating that these
host proteins expressed in lipid rafts are not incorporated
into viral particles.

Discussion
In this study, we found that raft membranes contain a proportion of viral envelope proteins at late phase in HHV-6
infected cells.
Previously, we reported that HHV-6 gQ1 and gQ2 each
exist in two forms, gQ1-74K, gQ2-34K and gQ1-80K,
gQ2-37K respectively, and that only gQ1-80K and gQ237K, which contain complex type N-linked oligosaccharides, are incorporated into viral particles [17]. Furthermore, we reported that HHV-6 gO also exists in two
forms, gO-120K and gO-80K, and gO-80K contains complex type N-linked oligosaccharides, are incorporated into
viral particles[22]. Here we observed that a subpopulation
of HHV-6 envelope proteins, gH, gL, and gB, and interestingly, a subpopulation of the mature proteins gQ1-80K,
gQ2-37K and gO-80K are associated with rafts, but the
nonstructural protein, IE1 remains excluded from raft
membrane, indicating that as the HHV-6 envelope glycoproteins mature through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and Golgi, the raft association of HHV-6 glycoproteins
may occur during the maturation step in post Golgi compartment. Since lipid rafts occur in the Golgi complex[23],
such a glycoprotein concentrating function of lipid rafts
may also be significant for efficient beta herpesvirus budding and particle formation as has been hypothesized in
alpha herpesviruses[24,25]. The budding of the HHV-6
has been reported to be preceded by the assembly of viral
components at special sites that are TGN-derived vesicles
[15]. Therefore, we speculate that lipid raft microdomains
may provide a cellular location for HHV-6 assembly in
infected cells.
Interestingly, in mock-infected HSB-2 cells, CD59 and
LAT proteins, which are concentrated in lipid rafts were
tightly migrated to fraction 4, while in HHV-6-infected
cells, they were migrated to fractions 4, 5, 10, 11 and 12.
Because cellular machinery is possibly modified at the late
phase of infection and the structure of cellular membrane
appears to become loose, CD59 and LAT may have been
also detected in fractions 10, 11 and 12 in addition to fractions 4 and 5.
We show here that HHV-6 virions incorporated GM1 as
well as virus envelope proteins, but not CD59 and LAT,
indicating that the raft membrane was incorporated into
viral particles. HIV-1 particles carry the lipid-raft-specific
ganglioside GM1 and a number of cellular GPI-anchored
proteins, such as CD59, on their surface [6]. This incorporation of particular cell membrane constituents is likely to

be a direct consequence of the preferential budding of
HIV-1 through the so-called raft microdomains of the
plasma membrane [6].
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) tegument protein, virion host
shut-off protein (vhs) appears to be associated with lipid
rafts, and this raft population is enriched in a cytoplasmic
membrane fraction, which contains assembling and
mature HSV particles, and the raft association of vhs is
speculated to correlate with the assembly of vhs into tegument [25]. HSV-2 UL56p is also reported to associate
with rafts [26]. By using detergent solubilization experiments, HSV gB, but not gC, gD or gH has been shown to
localize to raft fractions during virus entry [27]. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) gB has been show to be a strong, detergent-resistant raft association whereas gC and gD not to be
strong lipid raft association in PRV-infected cells [28]. Our
results suggest that HHV-6 mature virions may bud
through lipid rafts in TGN-derived vesicles, thus incorporating host-cell cholesterol and sphingolipids.
