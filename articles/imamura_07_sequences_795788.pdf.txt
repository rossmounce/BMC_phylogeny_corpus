Abstract
Background: Little is known, either experimentally or computationally, about the genomic
sequence features that regulate malaria genes. A sequence conservation analysis of the malaria
species P. falciparum, P. berghei, P. yoelii, and P. chabaudi could significantly advance knowledge of
malaria gene regulation.
Results: We computationally identify intergenic sequences conserved beyond neutral
expectations, using a conservation algorithm that accounts for the strong compositional biases in
malaria genomes. We first quantify the composition-specific divergence at silent positions in coding
sequence. Using this as a background, we examine gene 5' regions, identifying 610 blocks conserved
far beyond neutral expectations across the three mouse malariae, and 81 blocks conserved as
strongly across all four species (p < 10-6). Detailed analysis of these blocks indicates that only a
minor fraction are likely to be previously unknown coding sequences. Analogous noncoding
conserved blocks have been shown to regulate adjacent genes in other phylogenies, making the
predicted blocks excellent candidates for novel regulatory functions. We also find three potential
transcription factor binding motifs which exhibit strong conservation and overrepresentation
among the rodent malariae.
Conclusion: A broader finding of our analysis is that less malaria intergenic sequence has been
conserved by selection than in yeast or vertebrate genomes. This supports the hypothesis that
transcriptional regulation is simpler in malaria than other eukaryotic species. We have built a public
database containing all sequence alignments and functional predictions, and we expect this to be a
valuable resource to the malaria research community.

Background
Malaria is a disease caused by parasites in the genus Plasmodium. It afflicts 500 million people worldwide and kills
more than one million each year [1]. In the last few years,
significant progress has been made towards characterizing
the molecular biology of malaria, including the sequencing of the genomes of P. falciparum and several other
malaria species [2]. While this sequencing has led to the

identification and characterization of many malaria
genes, little is known about the transcription factor binding sites or other sequence features that are involved in
gene regulation. Only a handful of gene regulatory interactions have been characterized experimentally [3-8]
(reviewed in [9]) – such studies are generally more difficult than in comparatively facile models such as yeast. A

iments is a computational comparative genomic analysis.
Cross-species sequence comparisons can provide a great
deal of information about potential functional sites, as
has been shown in other phylogenies [10-12]. Specifically, the extensively sequenced genomes of P. falciparum
[2] and three related mouse malaria species, P. berghei, P.
yoelii, and P. chabaudi [13-15], are a rich resource for identifying novel functional sites in malaria.
Novel computational studies of gene regulation may be
particularly valuable for malaria. It has been speculated
that the malaria gene regulatory program is simpler than
that of most eukaryotic organisms, due to the small
number of proteins homologous to known transcription
factors in other species [16] and the relative homogeneity
of P. falciparum mRNA expression patterns [17,18]. A few
such computational studies have been performed.
Militello et al [3] identified a GC-rich motif (the G-box)
occurring in the sequences 5' of several P. falciparum genes
and their counterparts in P. yoelii, P. berghei, and P. vivax,
and verified the activity of this sequence experimentally.
van Noort and Huynen [19] predicted 12 motifs based on
correlation of unaligned P. falciparum and P. yoelii promoter sequences with mRNA expression data. Similarly,
multiple groups have used protein/mRNA ratios to identify motifs likely to affect mRNA degradation, with varying levels of confidence [14,20]. As in the Militello et al
work, sequence conservation provided support for one of
these motifs [14]. However, a more thorough sequence
conservation analysis, involving comprehensive alignments and conservation measurements, has the potential
to be much more powerful. Conservation may reveal
functional sequences throughout all alignable regions of
the genome, rather than merely next to genes with particular expression patterns.
In this paper we therefore undertake a large scale sequence
conservation analysis, computationally identifying intergenic sequences conserved beyond neutral expectations
across several malaria genomes. This technique, commonly referred to as phylogenetic footprinting, has been
shown to effectively detect functional regions in yeast and
vertebrate phylogenies[11,12,21]. Our work makes use of
publicly available sequence data from the genomes of the
human malaria P. falciparum and the rodent malariae P.
berghei, P. chabaudi, and P. yoelii (Figure 1). Neafsey et al
considered a similar paradigm in a comparison of P. falciparum to the chimpanzee malaria P. reichenowi [22].
Because of the extreme sequence identity of P. falciparum
and P. reichenowi (>90%), these genomes are not wellsuited for distinguishing specific sequences under selective constraint. However, Neafsey et al did observe an
unusual excess of CpG sites in intergenic regions proximal
to genes, suggesting that these regions contain functional
sequences. Because our study analyzes species at greater

Phylogeny of Rodent and Human Malariae. The three
mouse malaria species, P. chabaudi, P. berghei, and P. yoelii, are
closely related, with 0.757 of the alignable 4-fold sites identical across all three mouse species. P. falciparum has saturated
divergence from these three, with 0.359 of the alignable 4fold sites identical across all four species. AT sites are much
more commonly identical than GC sites in each grouping.

phylogenetic separations, we are able to refine this
approach to identify specific locations likely to be functional.
In this work, we first quantify the neutral divergence
between the species, using silent positions in coding
sequence. The statistics of silent sites provide a background for evaluating conserved intergenic sequences of
differing lengths and base composition. Composition is a
crucial consideration in malaria, since the genome has a
strong bias for AT, with P. falciparum having 81% AT content [15].
Given this neutral background, we take two approaches to
identifying sequences conserved by selection. In the first,
we determine contiguous blocks of intergenic sequence
which are conserved beyond the neutral background, and
which are therefore presumably functional. We consider
the total amount of such unusually conserved sequence
and analyze the genes next to which these regions occur.
We are able to identify 610 blocks conserved strongly
across the three mouse malariae, and 81 blocks conserved
strongly across all four species including P. falciparum.
In the second approach, we identify sequence motifs
whose instances are conserved more frequently than random sequences. Such motifs are good candidates for transcription factor binding sites, which typically occur in
each of the promoters of co-regulated genes. We focus on
three motif families with compelling evidence for functionality. The motifs in each of these families are highly
conserved and occur much more often than would be
expected by chance.
Our phylogenetic footprinting findings provide a valuable
new resource for understanding functional intergenic
sequences in malaria. Given the small number of known
regulatory sequences in malaria, our predictions provide a

substantial improvement to the knowledge in this area. To
ensure the usefulness of our findings to others in the field,
we have made all of the alignments and predictions available in a user-friendly website [see Additional file 1].

Results
Malaria Species Divergence
To estimate the background neutral conservation level, we
calculated the substitution rate in silent positions in
aligned orthologous coding sequence, in particular 4-fold
degenerate sites. Silent sites, such as 4-fold degenerate
sites, have conventionally been chosen as a good proxy for
neutral sequence [23], which is why we have chosen to
use them to determine the neutral background in our
study. Previous studies in yeast [10] also suggest that the
selective pressures on 4-fold sites are small enough that
they are a reasonable approximation to neutrality (see
Discussion). We observed 4-fold site substitution rates
(the fraction of 4-fold sites in which the bases differ
between the species) of 0.121 (P. berghei-P. yoelii), 0.191
(P berghei-P. chabaudi), and 0.194 (P. yoelii-P. chabaudi).
These divergences are qualitatively consistent with the
maximum-likelihood inferences reported by Hall et al,
who found median dS values of 0.03 (P. berghei-P. yoelii),
0.5 (P. berghei-P. chabaudi), and 0.5 (P. yoelii-P. chabaudi).
The quantitative differences are due to their use of a heterogeneous codon-based approach, as well as the multiple
substitutions allowed in a maximum likelihood formulation. For the three mouse malaria species, 0.757 of the 4fold sites are identical across all three mouse species. This
leads to the rough expectation that random intergenic
regions of length N should be identical with a probability
0.757N, if one were to ignore alignability or base composition considerations. Under this assumption a block
needs to be of length ~50 to have a conservation p-value
of 10-6. In practice, the strong AT bias in malaria species
allows blocks of shorter length to be identified. Identical
GC bases are rare in 4-fold sites, which increases their significance for discriminating unusual blocks. Overall, the
fraction of 4-fold sites which are an identical A or T is
0.694, the fraction which are an identical G or C is 0.063,
and the fraction which are not identical is 0.243. We use
these values to assess unusually conserved regions.

The fraction of P. falciparum 4-fold sites identical across all
4 species is 0.359, which yields an estimate that conserved
sequences must be ~13 bases long for detection at p-value
10-6. The fraction of 4-fold sites which are an identical A
or T is 0.3504, the fraction which are an identical G or C
is 0.0085, and the fraction which are not identical is
0.6411. Hall et al reported that all three mouse species
have saturated neutral divergence with respect to P. falciparum. In our dataset, the fraction of 4-fold sites identical
between P. yoelii and P. falciparum is 0.441. This is close to,
but slightly higher than what would be expected (0.379)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/372

if the 4-fold bases have no remnants of shared history and
are not under selection, given each species' 4-fold base
compositions. The higher observed conservation may be
influenced by small codon usage biases or perhaps other
selective effects, which are known to perturb silent site
conservation in several other species [24]. In any case, any
such selective pressures acting on this presumed neutral
sequence will make our functional predictions more conservative.
Conserved Intergenic Blocks in P. chabaudi, P. berghei, and
P. yoelii
To determine intergenic regions likely to be functional, we
searched regions upstream and downstream of orthologous mouse malaria genes for aligned blocks with strong
conservation. The three mouse malaria species were generally well-aligned in both the 5' and 3' regions. In the 300
bp upstream of gene translation starts, the fraction of sites
with the same base in all three species was 0.51, and in the
300 bp downstream of the translation stop the conservation rate was also 0.51. The conservation rate was somewhat lower (0.39) for the full 5' sequences up to 2500 bp.
This suggests the prevalence of functional sequence closer
to the gene, as has been observed in yeast and mammals
[see also Additional file 2].

To detect blocks of unusually conserved sequence among
the three mouse malaria species, we identified 40 bp windows with a conservation score above a threshold level
(see Methods). The conservation score was calculated as
the sum of contributions for each base within the window
identical across all three species. For a given window, the
score is calculated as a sum over all identical positions in
the alignment i of the base-dependent score σ(bi). Nonidentical positions provide no contribution. In other
words, the score S is defined as

S = ∑ σ (bi )δ (i),
i

where δ(i) = 1 if the site is identical across all the species
and is 0 otherwise. In practice, because A and T compositions are similar to each other, as are G and C compositions, we use only two values of σ, σAT and σGC. This
composition dependence is important in evaluating
sequence conservation across malaria genomes, due to
their strong AT bias. This scoring approach is quite stringent in its requirement of identity across all the species,
which has the advantage of decreasing false positives.
While this is a simplification of the information in the
phylogeny, alternative methods with a more complex
approach to the species' phylogenetic relationships are
not noticeably better, and have additional caveats (see
Discussion).

We set a threshold score Smin such that the multinomial
probability of a random sequence having that score or
greater was < 10-6 (see Methods), in order to limit the
number of false positives. This corresponded to a minimum score Smin of 64.0. Since the total amount of alignable P. yoelii sequence is 1.5 Mb, we expect ~1.5 false
positives.
In total, we observed 610 5' blocks with a score greater
than or equal to Smin. This is 400 times the expected
number of false positives, indicating widespread conservation for functional reasons. An example of one strongly
aligned region is shown in Figure 2, which shows a region
5' of the gene PY02186, a conserved hypothetical protein.
Because the background conservation level is high, the
hallmark of this region is the clustering of conserved GC
bases, rather than conservation alone.
The average length of the 5' conserved blocks is 61 bp.
Their localization is not strong – they are typically located
503 bp from the P. yoelii ATG, with a standard deviation
of 459 bp. They comprise a total length of 37.2 kb, which
corresponds to 2.4% of the length of the alignable P. yoelii
5' sequence data. In the 3' regions, we find 208 blocks
with an average length of 60 bp, comprising 2.4% of the
total 3' dataset.
Conserved Intergenic Blocks in Alignments including P. falciparum
P. falciparum is significantly further diverged from the
three mouse malaria species. Only 0.31 of P. falciparum
bases in the 300 bp upstream of genes are identical across
all four species, with the same fraction in 300 bp downstream of genes. Because of this low neutral sequence conservation and the extreme AT content, alignments of the
four species are less reliable except in regions with strong
conservation. This is an additional reason for focusing the
analysis on regions with a stringent conservation p-value
(10-6).

To detect conserved blocks among the four species, we
applied the same method we used for the three species
comparisons but with a window size of 15 bp. Setting a pvalue of 10-6 corresponds to a cutoff score of 26.5. In the
PC000832.03.0

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/372

5' intergenic regions, we find a total of 81 regions exceeding the cutoff. As there are 1.5 Mb of alignable P. falciparum sequence, we expect ~1.5 false positives, which is
once again much less than the number of observed hits.
The conserved blocks cover only 0.1% of the alignable P.
falciparum sequence. Thus, P. falciparum appears to have a
substantially lower fraction of shared functional sequence
with the mouse species than they share with each other. In
the 3' regions, we find 17 conserved blocks. The 5' blocks
have an average length of 24 bp, with an average location
451 bp upstream of the P.f. start (std. dev. = 425 bp).
These 81 blocks occur upstream of 73 distinct genes and
29 of them have functional annotation. These 29 are
shown in Table 1. Several of these genes are involved in
ribosomal function, including PF07_0079, PF08_0014,
PF11_0313, and PFE0960w. The alignments for these and
all other regions are available in the online website.
Five examples of such regions with conservation well
beyond the neutral background are shown in Figure 3.
These regions are upstream of the unannotated genes
PF14_0091, PF14_0682, and PF14_0212, as well as the
annotated genes PF14_0437 (a putative truncated helicase) and PFA0400c (a putative beta3 proteasome subunit). As discussed above, the expected fraction of identical
sites based on 4-fold positions is ~1/3, and all of these
regions are clearly conserved beyond that level. These
example blocks are significantly longer than would be
expected for a single transcription-factor binding site
(approximately 6–12 bp [25,26]), though we also observe
some conserved blocks that correspond to the size of a
binding site.
We believe that these examples, as well as many others in
the set of blocks we have identified, are strong candidates
for having novel functional activity. These five blocks each
occur within 300 bp of the annotated start of the downstream gene. Typical P. falciparum 5' UTR lengths are 350
bp (with some examples as long as 990 bp)[27], and some
of the conserved blocks are probably in a 5' UTR. Analogous highly conserved sequences have been recently
shown to act as enhancers in the vertebrate phylog-

site substitution patterns. While the unhighlighted sections are mostly conserved as well, the highlighted region stands out for
its high density of conserved G's and C's, which are rare (6.3%) in 4-fold degenerate positions.

eny[28], suggesting that these and other strongly conserved regions could be important for P. falciparum gene
regulation.
Three examples of such conserved blocks within 300 bp
downstream of a gene are shown in Figure 4. These blocks
are adjacent to the hypothetical genes PF10_0096,
MAL8P1.157, and PFL2145w. Each of these occurs within
the first 200 bp downstream of its respective gene, suggesting the blocks may be in their respective 3' UTRs.
Most Conserved Blocks Are Not Unknown Coding
Sequences or Microsatellites
Although the current database of malaria genes is imperfect, most of the blocks which we have identified do not
appear to be previously unknown coding sequences. We
BLASTed our conserved blocks against a large dataset of
experimentally verified full length cDNA sequences from
P. falciparum and P. yoelii and manually inspected the
results. These data sets were downloaded from the Comparasite cDNA database [29]. In the dataset of 610 predicted 5' functional regions across the 3-species, 50

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/372

overlap with experimentally validated cDNAs from P. yoelii. The number of P. yoelii genes which have available
cDNA data is 1212 in our dataset, and our complete dataset is made of 3711 orthologs shared across the 3-species.
If all the predicted functional regions were in cDNAs we
would expect 610 * (1212/3711) = 199 regions to overlap
the cDNA data. However, we only observe 1/4 of this
number. In our dataset of 81 predicted 5' functional
regions across the 4-species, only 2 overlap with experimentally validated cDNAs. There are 2805 4-species gene
orthologs in our dataset and 1465 have cDNA data available. So we observe far fewer conserved blocks overlapping cDNAs than would be expected (81 * 1465/2805=
42.3) if all conserved blocks were parts of cDNAs. Note
that even if a conserved region overlaps a cDNA it could
be in a UTR region rather than an exon, in which case the
region's function could still be regulatory.
We have also analyzed the periodicity of the pattern of
conservation, which would be expected to have an unusual signal at multiples of 3 nt if the conserved regions
were coding sequence. We calculated the autocorrelation
of the conservation pattern of the conserved blocks and
compared this to the autocorrelation in known exonic
regions (see Methods). In the known exonic regions, the
autocorrelation value at 3 nt was more than 10% above
the value at the neighboring distances (2 nt or 4 nt) in
both the 3-species and 4-species data. This was also true at
6 nt, 9 nt, 12 nt, ..., 30 nt. However, this 3 nt periodicity
was not observed on average for our predicted functional
regions, demonstrating that they are generally not exonic.
For the predicted regions, the 3 × nt autocorrelation values
were not consistently larger than their neighbors, and
were even negative at many of the distances, suggesting
that most blocks are not exons [see Additional file 3]. A
finer comparison of the autocorrelation pattern of individual 4-species blocks to the idealized exonlike conservation pattern 110110110110... (where 1 and 0 represent a
match and mismatch, respectively) did, however, suggest
that 11 of the 81 blocks may be exonic [see Additional file
4].
If the predicted conserved regions are important for function, one would expect them to not be made of highly
repetitive DNA, which occurs commonly in malaria intergenic regions. To test this, we have run the microsatellitefinding program Tandem Repeats Finder[30] on our conserved 5' regions, using parameters from the previous
study of malaria microsatellites by Volkman et al[31].
Microsatellites are predicted in less than 10% of the conserved blocks. In the 610 blocks from the three mouse
malariae set, 43 instances of microsatellites are predicted.
Furthermore, the predicted microsatellites are different
than those that typically occur in malaria intergenic
regions. Volkman et al reported that the majority of

Upstream blocks conserved beyond neutral expectations among P. falciparum and the three mouse malaria species
Figure 3
Upstream blocks conserved beyond neutral expectations among P. falciparum and the three mouse malaria
species. These blocks were identified by searching the aligned regions upstream of orthologous genes and are strong candidates for having novel functions. These are (A) at 275 bp upstream of PF14_0091, a hypothetical gene, (B) at 81 bp upstream of
PF14_0682, a hypothetical gene, (C) at 185 bp upstream of PF14_0212, a hypothetical gene, (D) at 275 bp upstream of
PF14_0437, a helicase truncated putative gene, and (E) at 1 bp upstream of PFA0400c, a beta3 protesome putative gene. In
total, we observe 81 P. falciparum 5' regions with a conservation p-value of 10-6or lower.

malaria intergenic microsatellites are repeats of sequences
one or two bases long, but the 610 conserved blocks contain only a single instance of 12 consecutive A's and one
instance of 12 consecutive T's. Other than that, all the predicted microsatellites occur in at most 4 tandem copies
with copy lengths ranging from 4–8 bases. These small
numbers are not a side effect of the average conserved
block size (61 bp), which is large enough to contain significantly more repeats. For the 4-species set, we observe
only 3 predicted instances of microsatellites in 81 total
blocks. One of these is an instance of 13 consecutive T's.
The other two are repeats that occur 2 and 4.25 times,
respectively. These results are consistent with our scoring

function having been designed to favor GC-rich blocks,
which would exclude many simple repeating units such as
microsatellites.
Conserved Motifs
An alternative approach to identifying conserved blocks is
to search for sequence motifs whose instances are conserved unusually often. This approach has been used successfully to identify short functional sites in yeast [11,32]
and mammals [12]. Such motif-based methods take
advantage of the fact that some types of functional motifs,
such as transcription factor binding sites, occur repetitively throughout the genome, and this allows them to be

Downstream blocks conserved beyond neutralexpectations among P. falciparum and the three mouse malaria species
Downstream blocks conserved beyond neutralexpectations among P. falciparum and the three mouse malaria
species. The blocks are located (A) at 172 bps downstream of PF10_0096, a hypothetical gene, (B) at 108 bps downstream of
MAL8P1.157, a hypothetical gene, and (C) at 140 bps downstream of PFL2145w, a hypothetical gene. 15 conserved blocks in
downstream regions had a p-value of 10-6 or lower.

more easily detected. To discover such motifs, we enumerated all N-mers (5 ≤ N ≤ 10) and measured how often they
are conserved across the three mouse malaria species.
For each motif of length N, we calculated the fraction of
its occurrences in which all three mouse species had the
identical motif in the alignment, and we then compared
this value to the fraction of all N-nucleotide windows
which are identical across the species. For example, the
fraction of P. yoelii 8-bp windows which are identical
across all three species is 0.10 (quite close to the expectation from the 4-fold sites of 0.7578 ~ 0.11). We used these
values and the number of instances of each motif to calculate a conservation z-score zp. Gaussian statistics were
then used to assign a p-value at given zp, and motifs were
retained if they satisfied: p-value < 4-N. Because of the
strong AT content of malaria genomes, we found that
some AT-rich motifs occurred in frequencies much higher
than would be expected for transcription factor binding
sites, and these high frequencies led to excessive values of

zp. Therefore, we restricted to motifs occurring no more
than 1000, but at least 10 times in the genome.
As a second restriction, we calculated another z-score zn
based on the number of copies of the motif and the
expected number given the base composition of the motif
and average base frequencies in the P. yoelii genome. This
additional criterion was applied because we expect that
functional motifs should occur more frequently than
would a random sequence of comparable base composition. Only motifs with zn > 5 (p < 6 × 10-6) were retained.
In the 5' upstream regions, we found 33 motifs with significant conservation among the three rodent malaria species. These motifs were clustered using MUSCLE [33],
resulting in 3 major families, though the motifs in each
family were similar enough to be easily clustered by eye as
well. The first of these families includes the core motif
AGCTAGCT and 14 other similar sequences (Figure 5).
The AGCTAGCT motif occurs in 72 instances in the align-

Variants5 the AGCTAGCT motif
Variants of the AGCTAGCT motif. Each of these variants of the AGCTAGCT motif was found to have a statistically significant z-score for conservation across the rodent malaria species (Zp) and for overoccurrence in P. yoelii (Zn). Interestingly,
this motif is also its own reverse complement. Of the 33 motifs with significant values of Zp and Zn, 15 of them cluster by
sequence similarity into this family.

able regions and is conserved in 22 of them, whereas one
would expect only 7.4 to be conserved by chance (zp = 5.4,
zn = 33.6). It is worth noting that this motif is its own
reverse complement, which is often a sign of functional
transcription factor binding sites. Other related variants
include the motifs TTAGCTAGCT (zp = 8.2, zn = 18.6) and
CTAGCTAA (zp = 5.8, zn = 5.5). Interestingly, a merging of
these sequences suggests an extended motif of
TTAGCTAGCTAA, which is also its own reverse complement. Although the AGCTAGCT motif is not conserved in
the aligned P. falciparum sequence, 4 of the 7 P. falciparum
genes contain an AGCT motif within 200 bp of the corresponding alignment position, and a fifth gene contains an
AGCT 600 bp upstream. These findings suggest that,
despite the lack of clear conservation, the corresponding
function may have persisted in P. falciparum.
There are two additional motif families which make up
most of the remaining significant motifs: TGCACAC and
TGTGTG. As in the case of AGCTAGCT, each of these
motifs has several variants which are also significantly
conserved. The TGCACAC motif has 8 additional variants,
and the TGTGTG motif has 5 additional variants. These
motifs are also nearly reverse complements of one
another, suggesting that they correspond to binding sites

of the same transcription factor but on opposite DNA
strands.
For each of the three motifs AGCTAGCT, TGCACAC, and
TGTGTGT, there is a bias to be localized closer to the gene,
suggesting the motifs may be involved in gene regulation.
This is especially true in the first 400 bp upstream of the
translation start [see Additional file 5]. We also analyzed
the fraction of these three motifs' instances conserved
across the three species, as a function of their distance
from the P. yoelii translation start (in bins of 100 bp).
Although we observed conserved instances of motifs at
many different distances, the bin with the highest conservation rate was from 300–400 bp. This was true for each
of the three motifs (AGCTAGCT: 61%, TGCACAC: 56%,
TGTGTGT: 40%). This is particularly suggestive of gene
regulatory function since malaria 5' UTRs have been
measured to be on average 346 bp long. [27].
We next performed a motif search in the 300 bp 3' of the
genes, as 3' regions have been shown to be binding sites
for microRNAs in other species [12]. The evidence for
these motifs was not as strong, as there were only 5 distinct motifs. 4 of these appear to be part of the core motif
pattern TTTTCGA (zp = 4.5, zn = 4.9), and the last is the

motif TTTGTG (zp = 4.5, zn = 4.9). Details are given in
Additional file 6.
Unfortunately, due to the extreme sequence divergence
between P. falciparum and the other species, we found no
identifiable motifs in a conservation analysis across all
four species. Of the motifs meeting the prescribed z-score
and copy number cutoffs, none was conserved in more
than one instance, making the results unreliable.
Previously, van Noort and Huynen predicted motifs likely
to be functional in P. falciparum and P. yoelii based on a
correlation with gene expression and functional classification. They also found a motif similar to our TGTGTG
motif (motif 3 of their supplement), and a similar motif
(ATGTGTA) was found by applying the FastCompare
algorithm [34], which looks for motifs occurring in
orthologous promoters but does not require them to be
aligned, to P. falciparum and P. yoelii (M. Llinas, personal
communication). Our TGCACAC motif was not observed
in the expression analysis, but a variant was found with
FastCompare (ATGCACA). Our AGCTAGCT motif was
not observed by either of the other methods.
Conservation of Previously Characterized Functional
Sequences
There are several genomic regions with previous experimental evidence for either regulating expression of the
downstream gene or for binding to proteins. We surveyed
a number of these to determine if they agreed with the
conserved regions we identified.

One of the best-characterized functional sequences in
malaria intergenic regions is the G-box, which was first
observed upstream of the heat shock protein hsp86
(PF07_0029) in P. falciparum [3]. In our data, the P. falciparum and P. yoelii sequences are conserved in the section
of the alignment containing two copies of the G-box,
which has consensus (A/G)NGGGG(C/A). Unfortunately,
there was no sequence for either P. chabaudi or P. berghei
in that region, preventing us from assessing conservation
with our 4-species score. However, we calculated an analogous score using just the P. falciparum (GCCCCGCGGAAAGGGGC) and P. yoelii (GCCCCGTGGTAAGGGGC)
sequences. The p-value for their conservation pattern is
10-29, indicating extremely strong conservation beyond
the background.
The next best example of conservation was for a 120 bp
region, in front of the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase gene, likely to contain sequences controlling gene
expression [4]. Although we found no unusually conserved block in the corresponding region using our scoring function, we did observe one 12 bp stretch where all
the bases in each species are consistently either purine or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/372

pyrimidine (CATTCCATTTA in P. falciparum). Crabb and
Cowman also experimentally identified a 172 bp region
adjacent to the dhfr in P. chabaudi with regulatory activity
[4]. Surprisingly, this region does not contain the same 12
bp purine/pyrimidine pattern and does not align to the
functional P. falciparum region.
We observed that, in general, most known functional
regions do not exhibit conservation between P. falciparum
and the mouse malariae. We considered several other
aligned regions which have been reported to have functional activity in P. falciparum, and none exhibited significant sequence conservation. These include the
characterized regions of the DNA Polδ promoter [7],
"Sequence B" in the PfCDS promoter [6], and the PAF-1
transcription factor binding site in the pfs25 promoter [5].
The regulatory region of the P. falciparum calmodulin gene
[4] was inconclusive, because the previously reported
upstream sequence [8] has discrepancies with that currently in PlasmoDB [35]. This overall lack of conservation
suggests high turnover in regulatory sites since P. falciparum diverged from the other malariae. This is not unexpected given the long divergence times, as evidenced by
the saturated Ks values, between P. falciparum and the
other species. However, it also indicates that the unusually conserved blocks we have identified among the four
species must be under a considerable amount of selective
pressure.

Discussion
We have identified 610 intergenic sequence blocks likely
to be conserved for functional reasons in the mouse
malaria species, as well as 81 blocks conserved across
these species and P. falciparum. Our statistical analysis suggests that the majority of these do not encode protein,
though a minor fraction may be previously unknown coding sequences. We have used stringent p-value cutoffs to
predict these regions (p < 10-6), making them strong candidates for being functional. Given the small number of
known intergenic functional sites in malaria, this high
stringency approach should have the most practical utility. Many of our predicted functional blocks have even
higher stringency. For example, at a required p-value of
10-9, we still find 20 4-species blocks meeting the cutoff.
In addition we have identified 3 recurrent motifs,
AGCTAGCT, TGCACAC, and TGTGTG, with strong evidence for being functional in the mouse malaria species,
based on both conservation and overrepresentation. One
caveat is that these motifs are only mildly conserved with
P. falciparum, and it is unclear whether the gene regulation
pattern would be the same in all four species. In general,
most of the known P. falciparum regulatory regions in our
dataset are not conserved with the mouse malariae, which
is likely due to the large divergence time between P. falci-

parum and the other species. Intriguingly, a recent study
has shown that a TGCAC motif is functional in P. falciparum [36].
We have estimated that 2–3% of the alignable sequence is
functionally conserved among the mouse malariae, and
~0.1% is functionally conserved among the 4 species.
Both of these numbers are considerably less than the estimates for the amount of functional intergenic sequence
shared among sensu stricto yeasts [10] (~30% of the alignable sequence, ~90 bp per promoter) or for mammals
[37,38] (2× as much conserved non-coding sequence as
coding sequence). This result is consistent with previous
suggestions that transcription regulation may be less
important in malaria than in other eukaryotes [16]. A mitigating consideration is that P. falciparum is at saturated
divergence from the other malaria species. This makes it
difficult to estimate the total amount of functional intergenic sequence in P. falciparum, since some may be functional but under different selective constraint than in the
rodent malaria species. However, this mitigating factor
should be less relevant when only the rodent malariae are
considered, since they are much more closely related. For
the aforementioned yeasts, the fraction of identical 4-fold
sites is 0.33[10], while for P. yoelii-P. berghei-P. chabaudi,
the fraction of identical 4-fold sites is 0.757. So the 3
malaria species are more similar at their 4-fold sites than
the yeast species, yet have a lower fraction of constrained
intergenic sequence. One other caveat is that the methods
used to predict the amount of functional sequence in the
yeast and mammalian phylogenies are not identical to
ours, though they are similarly based on the concept of
calibrating versus neutrally evolving sequence.
The small amount of predicted conserved functional
sequence is not an artifact of our stringently set score cutoff. At each possible cutoff score, we measured the percentage of sequence in conserved blocks and subtracted
the estimated percentage of false positive sequence (the pvalue multiplied by the typical block length at that cutoff
score). For the 4-species comparison, this quantity has a
maximum value at approximately 1% (cutoff score ~57),
which is much less than what is observed for the sensu
stricto yeasts. A similar calculation for the three mouse
malariae yielded a maximum value of ~9%, which is also
significantly less than the yeast estimate of 30%.
For the P. falciparum analysis, we have restricted our predictions to regions with sequence in all four species, making it a conservative estimate. However, there do not
appear to be many additional regions conserved between
P. falciparum and only one mouse malaria species. We
found 81 blocks using all 4 species, but only 15 more conserved blocks in comparisons between P. falciparum and P.
yoelii, which has significantly more sequence data than the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/372

two remaining species. Adding the contributions from all
of these comparisons would not be sufficient to bring the
fraction of unusually conserved sequence up to that of
yeast.
Regional inversions and transpositions do not appear to
have significantly affected our efficacy in detecting functional sequences. We performed a BLAST local alignment
of all P. yoelii and P. falciparum orthologous promoters.
We found only 4 additional conserved blocks from such
local alignments (e-value < 10-6), which is again only a
minor perturbation to the total amount of predicted functional sequence.
One interesting question is how the different minimum
length requirements of the 4-species and 3-species methods affect the predictions. Among the 81 blocks conserved
across four Plasmodium species, 21 overlap with the 610
conserved in the three species. (Note that even though the
3-species method detects only 1/4 of the 4-species predicted blocks, adjustment by this factor would still yield
less functional predictions than the yeasts – which have
10× as much predicted functional sequence.) The partial
disjointness of the predictions suggests that the minimum
lengths give differences in the abilities to detect different
types of functional sequence. Qualitatively, we expect the
15 bp method to be better at detecting short functional
sequences (e.g. single transcription factor binding sites),
while the 40 bp method will be better at detecting longer
sequences with a diffuse conservation signal (e.g. clusters
of weak transcription factor binding sites and RNAs). The
40 bp method may also detect some short sequences provided they have a strong enough conservation signal (e.g.
a highly conserved GC-rich transcription factor binding
site). Conversely the 15 bp method may detect binding
site clusters and RNAs provided those regions contain at
least one shorter block that is sufficiently conserved.
Empirically, we have observed that the amount of predicted sequence is relatively stable to the block size. For
example, in the 5' predictions for the 4-species, we have
analyzed block sizes of 15 bp, 20 bp, 40 bp, and 60 bp.
For this range of sizes, the number of predicted blocks
ranges from 81 to 109. For the 3-species analysis, the
number of predicted blocks has a somewhat broader
range but of a consistent order of magnitude, from 282 to
781.
There is some evidence for codon usage selection in
malaria; however we do not believe that these effects are
strong enough to substantially alter the neutral model we
have inferred from the 4-fold sites. This is suggested by
analogy with yeast. For example, Chin et al [10] decomposed selective and neutral pressures on silent sites in
yeast, using a combination of information from substitu-

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:372

tion rate distributions, functional annotations, and codon
usage. We have reanalyzed that dataset, observing that the
decomposed neutral substitution rate (0.67) differs by
only 3% from the overall 4-fold substitution rate (0.65).
These decomposed yeast 4-fold site substitution rates were
successfully used as a calibration for detecting known
transcription factor binding sites, which supports the use
of 4-fold sites as a neutral background in malaria as well.
In P. falciparum, Peixoto et al showed that GC content at
the 3rd codon position correlates positively with gene
expression [39]. Nevertheless, AT-ending codons still
dominate virtually all genes. There are only 18 P. falciparum genes with a 3rd codon position GC content of over
40%, and the intergenic GC content (15%) is comparable
to synonymous site GC content (17%) [22]. While codon
usage selection is not completely understood in malaria,
these facts suggest that silent sites are mostly neutral.
Finally, we would like to comment on our block evaluation method. While several alternative algorithms to identifying conserved regions exist, ours has advantages over
each of them for studying malaria. One is to build a predictive log-odds statistic for functional regions by contrasting a training set of functional regions against neutral
sequence [40]. Unfortunately, because of the paucity of
known functional intergenic sequences, this approach is
not possible in malaria. A second approach is a phylogenetic hidden Markov model. We applied one such model,
phastCONS [37], to our data. However we observed that
phastCONS had difficulty resolving many obvious conserved blocks, such as those in Figure 3, even under a variety of reasonable choices of input parameters (functional
block size, fraction of protein coding regions predicted to
be functional, etc.). phastCONS makes use of phylogenetic distances, but this feature does not appear to have
much benefit in the malaria phylogeny due to the close
grouping of the three mouse malariae and their extreme
divergence from P. falciparum. A third algorithm that has
shown promise in vertebrate phylogenies is a composition-independent scoring of conservation patterns with
respect to neutral expectations, with p-values assigned by
Karlin-Altschul statistics [41]. However, for a strongly
compositionally biased genome such as malaria, it is critical to distinguish between AT and GC sites, since they
have extremely different conservation statistics. We have
implemented a method similar in spirit to this third
approach, but making the important correction for compositional effects. Another valuable feature of our method
is its calculation of p-values based on multinomial statistics, which are more exact than Karlin-Altschul statistics.
Based on these considerations, we believe our method is
the most appropriate for analyzing selective conservation
in the malaria phylogeny.

Conclusion
We have identified a large number of strongly conserved
intergenic regions in malaria species which are excellent
candidates for regulatory function. Given the tiny number
of previously studied regulatory sequences, this is a significant improvement on the previous knowledge. We have
built a database to provide all sequence alignments and
predictions of functional sequence, which will be valuable
to researchers with interest in any of the individual
regions. From a broader perspective, our results indicate
that less malaria intergenic sequence has been conserved
by selection than in yeast or vertebrate genomes. This supports the hypothesis that transcriptional regulation is simpler in malaria than other eukaryotic species.

Methods
Published genomic sequence data for the four species P.
berghei, P. chabaudi, P. yoelii and P. falciparum were downloaded from PlasmoDB [35]. Gene locations for P.
chabaudi and P. berghei were obtained via the Sanger
center, using the annotations reported by Hall et al [14].
We calculated a set of orthologs using a reciprocal best
BLASTP criterion for these genes. The results were largely
in agreement with the annotations from Hall et al. For
consistency, the results in this paper are based on the Hall
et al ortholog set. We produced alignments of regions 5'
of the annotated translation start and 3' of the annotated
translation stop site for each gene. For the 5' sequences, up
to 2500 basepairs of sequence were taken, with the
sequence truncated at any adjacent gene or contig break.
This inclusive length was chosen because some known
enhancer elements have been observed as far as 1600 bp
upstream of Plasmodium genes [6]. For the 3' sequences,
up to 300 basepairs of sequence were aligned, which is
comparable to sizes analyzed in 3' UTR studies in yeast
[42]. Similar 5' and 3' lengths have been used in previous
studies of malaria as well [22,43]. Alignments were produced first for the three mouse malaria species P. yoelii, P.
berghei, and P. chabaudi using MUSCLE [33], and another
set of alignments was produced using these three species
together with P. falciparum. In total, we analyzed 3711
gene ortholog triplets between P. chabaudi, P. berghei, and
P. yoelii, and 2805 quadruplets including P. falciparum.
Our sequence data are based on 3× coverage of the P.
berghei and P. chabaudi genomes, 5× coverage of the P. yoelii genome, and essentially complete coverage of the P. falciparum genome. While contigs for P. berghei and P.
chabaudi are shorter than for the other species, we were
still able to extract a considerable amount of intergenic
sequence. In a multiple-species sequence alignment, there
may be regions where a gap character occurs in at least one
species. Since not all of the species have fully sequenced
genomes, this gap may occur either because there is an
indel, or because one of the species has not yet been

sequenced in the region. We considered only portions of
the alignment for which each species had at least one
sequenced base 5' to the region in question, and at least
one sequenced base 3'. Because of this restriction, gaps in
the alignment should correspond to insertions or deletions, rather than regions which have not yet been
sequenced. Such indels contain information about
sequence differences across species, while sequencing
gaps do not.
After this restriction, the amount of alignable sequence
per promoter was 359 bp (PB), 316 bp (PC), and 474 bp
(PY) for the 3 way alignments, considering only those
(3248) orthologs with non-zero amounts of sequence.
For the 2544 4-way alignments, the numbers were 360 bp
(PB), 318 bp (PC), 475 bp (PY), and 605 bp (PF). The
amount of alignable sequence in tails was 157 bp (PB),
148 bp (PC), and 159 bp (PY) for the 3280 3 way alignments, and 159 bp (PB), 148 bp (PC), 163 bp (PY), and
166 bp (PF) for the 2580 4 way alignments.
For the alignment of coding sequence, sequences were
translated, aligned at the amino acid level, and then backtranslated to produce alignments at the DNA level. Silent
substitutions were then calculated using 4-fold degenerate
codon positions. These provide a homogeneous set of
bases under relatively weak selection and which are likely
to be aligned correctly. To ensure equivalent sequence
context we restricted the 4-fold degenerate positions to
those in which the preceding two bases and subsequent
base were identical in all the species, and we excluded data
from any genes containing fewer than 10 alignable 4-fold
sites.
Detection of Conserved Blocks
In the comparison of the 3 mouse species, we analyzed
40-bp windows and evaluated a score for each window.
The score was calculated based on the number of A or T
bases identical across all the species and the number of
identical G or C bases, with non-identical bases giving no
contribution. i.e. the score was set to S = nATσAT + nGCσGC.
This separation into G/C or A/T bases is crucial in malaria
because of the strong AT bias in the genome. For a given
species, the values of σAT and σGC are set equal to -log10((fA
+ fT)/2) and -log10 ((fC + fG)/2), respectively. fA, fT, fC and
fG represent the frequency of A, T, C and G bases in
upstream untranslated sequences up to 2500 bp. In this
computation, we have used only the upstream sequences
and not the downstream untranslated sequences to avoid
double counting of bases where they overlap. Since the
base compositions of each species are similar but not
identical [15], the overall values of σAT and σGC are the
sum of their respective values in each species. Thus S is a
score function based on the logarithm of the likelihood of
observing a particular pattern of conserved sites. The spe-

cies-specific base compositions are given in Additional file
7.
To evaluate the statistical significance of a given score, we
calculated the exact probability of observing a random
intergenic block of 40 bp with score greater than the
observed value. For random blocks, the probabilities of an
identical G/C base, an identical A/T base, and non-identical base were set equal to their respective frequencies at
shared 4-fold sites, and each site was assumed to be independent. The p-value was calculated using a multinomial
expansion of the quantity (pGC + pAT + q)40, where pGC is
the frequency of identical G or C bases, pAT is the frequency of identical A or T bases, and q is the frequency of
non-identical bases. A sum of the contributions of terms
with score greater than that of the given sequence was calculated using Mathematica.
Windows with p-value < 10-6 were accepted. This p-value
was chosen in order to make the expected number of false
positives approximately one. Because the aligned
sequence data is 1.5 Mb, we expect ~1.5 false positives at
this cutoff threshold. This allows one to infer that the predicted regions are unlikely to be false positives. A similar
calculation was done for the 4-species comparison,
though using 15 bp windows instead of 40. Detected windows were then extended by accepting any adjacent identical bases, and overlapping blocks were merged. These
window sizes were chosen to be just larger than the smallest sizes sufficient to detect regions with p-value of 10-6 or
better, since longer window length gives greater discriminating power. Note that the lengths differ in the two sets
of comparisons because the 4-species phylogeny has
greater phylogenetic divergence, which allows equivalent
discriminating power at a shorter window size. As a guide
to intuition, our 3-species blocks necessitate at minimum
9 conserved GC's in a 40 bp block to give a p-value of 106 or better, though the number of conserved AT bases is
also important. The 4-species method requires at minimum 2 conserved GC's in a 15 bp block.
Block Analysis
The autocorrelation analysis was performed using the ACF
and Pearson correlation functions in the R statistical computing environment. An aggregate autocorrelation was
calculated for all genes by weighting the autocorrelation
value of each single gene by its length, then dividing the
result by the total length of all genes. An analogous procedure was applied for determining the aggregate autocorrelation in conserved blocks. The microsatellite analysis was
performed using the P. yoelii sequence for the 3-species
analysis and using P. falciparum for the 4-species analysis
since these two species have most comprehensive genome
data in their ortholog groups.
