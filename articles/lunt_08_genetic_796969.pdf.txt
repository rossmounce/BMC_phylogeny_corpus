Abstract
Background: The existence of "ancient asexuals", taxa that have persisted for long periods of
evolutionary history without sexual recombination, is both controversial and important for our
understanding of the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction. A lack of sex has
consequences not only for the ecology of the asexual organism but also for its genome. Several
genetic signatures are predicted from long-term asexual (apomictic) reproduction including (i) large
"allelic" sequence divergence (ii) lack of phylogenetic clustering of "alleles" within morphological
species and (iii) decay and loss of genes specific to meiosis and sexual reproduction. These genetic
signatures can be hard to assess since it is difficult to demonstrate the allelic nature of very
divergent sequences, divergence levels may be complicated by processes such as inter-specific
hybridization, and genes may have secondary roles unrelated to sexual reproduction. Apomictic
species of Meloidogyne root knot nematodes have been suggested previously to be ancient asexuals.
Their relatives reproduce by meiotic parthenogenesis or facultative sexuality, which in combination
with the abundance of nematode genomic sequence data, makes them a powerful system in which
to study the consequences of reproductive mode on genomic divergence.
Results: Here, sequences from nuclear protein-coding genes are used to demonstrate that the
first two predictions of ancient asexuality are found within the apomictic root knot nematodes.
Alleles are more divergent in the apomictic taxa than in those species exhibiting recombination and
do not group phylogenetically according to recognized species. In contrast some nuclear alleles, and
mtDNA, are almost identical across species. Sequencing of Major Sperm Protein, a gamete-specific
gene, from both meiotic and ameiotic species reveals no increase in evolutionary rate nor change
in substitution pattern in the apomictic taxa, indicating that the locus has been maintained by
selection.
Conclusion: The data strongly suggests the tropical root knot nematode apomicts have a recent
origin and are not anciently asexual. The results support that interspecific hybridization has been
involved in the origin of this asexual group and has played a role in shaping the patterns of genetic
diversity observed. This study suggests that genetic signatures of ancient asexuality must be taken
with caution due to the confounding effect of interspecific hybridization, which has long been
implicated in the origins of apomictic species.

Background
The evolution of sexual reproduction and its maintenance
in so many extant taxa has attracted much attention both
as a major innovation of eukaryotes and a process that
fundamentally shapes the diversity on which natural
selection acts [1]. Sexual reproduction is so ubiquitous
that some debate has focused on whether metazoan lineages can really exist for protracted evolutionary periods
without it [2-6]. Yet despite this several groups have been
suggested to persist without sexual reproduction for long
periods [4]. The existence of asexual taxa over such timescales appears to present problems for the body of theoretical work concerning the evolution and maintenance of
sexual reproduction [1].
The genetic signatures of asexuality
Asexual reproduction solely by mitotic division
(apomixis), when compared to species that undergo meiotic recombination (sexuality), makes a number of predictions concerning the genetic diversity within these
species. One such prediction is that of large allelic
sequence divergence (ASD, "Meselson Effect") between
"alleles" in apomictic lineages [7]. This happens because
apomictic alleles do not recombine and coalesce in a reticulate manner as they would in sexual taxa, rather diverging by the accumulation of mutations (Figure 1).

A second consequence of asexual reproduction without
recombination is that phylogenetic analysis of sequence
data produces an allele tree that may not match the species tree accepted for these lineages. This "paralogous
allele effect" (PAE) is observed because "alleles" in asexual
species behave more like paralogous loci do in a sexual
species [7]. Thus the closest relative of an allele's sequence
in one species will be the orthologous allele in another
species, rather than the other (paralogous) allele sequence
within the same species. This observation of PAE can,
along with ASD, be a strong signature of long-term asexual reproduction.
If apomixis arises in a diploid individual that is heterozygous (AB) at a locus, then without the action of recombination, "alleles" A and B are independent in their
accumulation of mutations and their gene sequences will
divergence from one another (Figure 1A). In effect, A and
B behave as different paralogous loci do in sexual taxa.
Sequence divergence will correspond to the time since the
alleles last coalesced prior to the switch to apomixis. Since
there is no transfer of gametes nor recombination
between individuals, A and B are also independent of similar sequences in conspecifics, and have separate evolutionary trajectories. The divergence of A and B within a
given individual (or apomictic species) is expected to be
much greater than the divergence between alleles in a sexual species, where recombination operates and the coales-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/194

cence of the alleles will be much more recent than the
formation of the species. Apomictic individuals in a population are not related by the homogenizing processes of
mating and recombination, but by descent from a single
common ancestor with diversity due to the accumulation
of mutations. Divergence between two copies of allele A,
one from an individual in lineage 1 and one from an individual in lineage 2, will date to the divergence of those
two lineages from a common ancestor. The divergences
between alleles within an individual are expected to be
greater than (predate) or equal to the divergences between
lineages. This is similar to the concept of segregating
ancestral polymorphism that can confound phylogenetic
analysis at some loci of sexual species, although it is a
characteristic of the entire genome of apomictic organisms and may persist over much greater timescales.
Ancient asexuality may not be the cause of large ASD if the
origin of apomixis is interspecific hybridization (Figure
1B). In many parthenogenetic vertebrates [8], and other
parthenogenetic taxa [9-14] interspecific hybridization
has been implicated in the origins of asexuality and the
asexuals may carry genes from two parental species. In
such a case an apomictic lineage might possess alleles A,
B, C, or D at a particular locus since the two parental species may not have shared alleles. In this situation, the pairs
of alleles within each sexual parent (A and B; C and D)
would share an ancestor within that species and not be
highly diverged, whereas the divergence of the two sets of
alleles (A, B vs C, D) would depend on the age of separation of the two parental species [15] and might be very
large. Figure 1B illustrates the situation for diploid hybrid
apomicts. Triploids would contain both alleles from one
parent and thus have a mixture of closely related and
highly divergent ASD values. Extreme ASD results from
the cessation of recombination, either due to ancient asexuality or the independent evolution of diverged species
that subsequently produce a hybrid. Since the causes and
genetic signatures are very similar it is important to carefully distinguish between these alternatives, especially
since the existence of ancient asexuality is so important
and controversial for evolutionary biology [16].
An additional prediction of long-term asexual reproduction is that genes involved only in meiosis and associated
processes (e.g. gamete production, sexual dimorphism)
will have no required function and will not be actively
maintained by selection [17]. In such genes mutations are
expected to accumulate at an accelerated rate, the ratio of
non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN:dS)
is expected to be different from that in genes under selection, and pseudogenisation (indels, frameshifts, stop
codons) is likely to result. Although great progress is being
made in identifying meiotic genes their roles in other
processes are sometimes hard to exclude and different tax-

onomic groups may use the generally well-conserved meiotic machinery in different ways [18,19]. An alternative to
meiosis-specific genes is the investigation of genes
involved in gamete production. Nematodes possess
amoeboid (crawling) sperm and the major sperm protein
genes (msp) are a relatively well-investigated gene family
with a major role in sperm structure and movement [2022]. In Caenorhabditis elegans this sperm protein has also
been shown to act as an extracellular signal for the completion of oocyte meiosis and contraction of the gonadal
sheath cells, which is required for ovulation [23]. These
two activities are determined by separate parts of the msp
amino acid sequence [23]. Expression of msp is restricted
to the sperm and spermatocytes in C. elegans and has been
shown to be male specific in other species of nematodes
[24-26]. Root knot nematode species are known to reproduce by both sexual and asexual means [27] and their msp
may be a good candidate to examine the consequences of
asexual reproduction for genes exclusively associated with
sexual reproduction.
Root Knot Nematodes
Root knot nematodes (RKN) of the genus Meloidogyne are
very widely distributed plant pathogens that are estimated
to be responsible for worldwide annual crop losses of
~5% [28]. The genus contains in excess of 80 species that
differ in morphology, host-range, geographic distribution, cytology and mode of reproduction [29,30]. The
three most agriculturally widespread and damaging taxa
(M. incognita, M. javanica and M. arenaria) are obligatory
apomicts in which bivalent chromosomes have never
been detected [27] and cell division is exclusively mitotic
[31]. Extensive aneuploidy is observed among populations of apomictic RKN [32] a state that has been predicted to be common in species that have lost meiosis [7].
In addition, the chromosomes of these apomicts cannot
be placed into homologous pairs (as they can in automictic and sexual Meloidogyne species) and variation in chromosome size follows a continuous rather than discrete
size pattern, indicating that many instances of karyotype
change have occurred [32,33]. The decay of homologous
chromosome pairs in ameiotic species has previously
been identified as a key characteristic of truly asexual
organisms [7,17,34] and such karyotype evolution may be
rapid [35]. The apomictic RKN form "dyads" characteristic
of mitotic divisions, and exhibit a single maturation division forming one polar nucleus and one egg nuclear each
with the somatic chromosome number [27]. Cytological
evidence therefore strongly supports their status as obligatory mitotic (apomictic) parthenogens that cannot go
through meiosis.

The apomictic RKN, like many apomicts [36-39], produce
occasional individuals that are morphologically male.
Although these have sometimes been observed to intro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/194

duce spermatozoa into females this resulted in the degradation of the sperm nucleus [32] and reproduction was
still mitotic. The Meloidogyne apomicts have been highlighted as putative ancient asexuals [4], although their age
has never been clear. Esbenshade and Triantaphyllou [40]
make tentative estimates of age of divergence within Meloidogyne from multi-enzyme banding patterns. Using their
figure 2 one can infer that the apomictic Meloidogyne may
be approximately 17 million years old.
Perhaps surprisingly since many suggestions for the benefits of sex stress the importance of novel genotypic combinations in host-pathogen competitions, apomictic RKN
are exceptionally wide ranging and successful pathogens.
The potential host range for RKN may include most of the
estimated 250,000 species of flowering plants, and a
plant-nematode arms race of virulence and resistance is
ongoing [41]. An additional apomictic species is M. mayaguensis, although this may be distinct from the three
main species of apomictic RKN [42]. Also of economic
concern, especially in temperate regions, are the facultative (automictic) meiotic parthenogens M. hapla (race A),
M. fallax and M. chitwoodi. These species posses homologous chromosomes, go through a standard meiosis
involving bivalents, and restore the somatic chromosome
number (when reproducing by automixis) by fusing the
second polar nucleus with the egg pronucleus [27,29,43].
Here Meloidogyne species with and without meiosis are
compared to determine the effects of asexual reproduction
on genomic diversity. Sequence analysis of three nuclear
protein-coding genes is carried out to examine differences
in ASD and PAE between the different reproductive
modes. In addition a sperm-specific gene is sequenced
and compared between the species utilizing sperm in their
reproduction (facultative meiotic parthenogens) and
those for whom sperm appear to have no function (obligatory mitotic parthenogens).

Results
Structure of loci
Elongation Factor 1-alpha primers amplified an approximately 780 bp fragment that included sequence from 4
exons and 3 introns. RNA polymerase II large subunit
primers amplified an approximately 710 bp fragment that
included coding sequence from 2 exons and a single
intron. Dystrophin primers amplified a fragment of
approximately 670â770 bp consisting of 3 exons and 2
introns. Major Sperm Protein primers amplified approximately 370 bp comprising 2 exons and a single intron.
Intron boundaries conformed to the C. elegans consensus
splice sequence [44]. The introns themselves contained
indels and were considerably more A+T-rich than exons, a
feature known to be characteristic of C. elegans introns.
mtDNA primers amplified a 773 bp fragment of the Mel-

oidogyne non-coding region between the 102 bp and 63 bp
repetitive arrays, corresponding to bp 5419â6192 of Okimoto et al. [45].
Sequences have been deposited with the international
databases with accession numbers EU699810â
EU699942.
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignments and phylogenetic analyses were carried out on
exon sequence data to minimize the influence of alignment ambiguities in the indel-rich intron regions. The
alignments of coding regions contained no indels and
were unambiguous for all genes. Models of evolutionary
change selected by MODELGENERATOR [46] using the
AIC1 criterion were GTR+G (dystrophin), TVM+G (RNA
polymerase II), TIM+G (elongation factor, msp). These
were used in maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction although gross tree topology was observed to be
stable across a range of different models. Trees for all
genes were similar in the phylogenetic relationship
between groups recovered (Figures 2, 3, 4). There was generally good support for grouping the tropical apomictic
species (M. incognita,M. javanica and M. arenaria) in a single clade, with the other apomict M. mayaguensis very
closely related. In two of the three phylogenies M. mayaguensis was clearly distinct, although in the EF1-alpha
tree its alleles were not resolved from those of the other
three species. The apomictic species were placed as a sister
group to the automict M. hapla. The (automictic) meiotic
parthenogens M. fallax and M. chitwoodi were found to be
very closely related and together formed the most basal
grouping well diverged from the other automict M. hapla.
Tree topologies were stable to the use of Globodera pallida,
Pratylenchus penetrans, C. elegans as outgroup, or midpoint
rooting.
Paralogues of elongation factor 1-alpha
The EF1-alpha phylogeny (Figure 4) indicates that gene
duplication might have occurred with some sequences
representing paralogous loci. The alleles for both M. hapla
and the M. chitwoodi-fallax complex each form two clusters
with divergences greater than observed for other loci. An
Ensembl blastp search with the translation of a M. incognita sequence revealed two matches in the C. elegans
genome, one on chromosome III and the other on chromosome X, indicating that duplicate EF1-alpha genes
have been evolutionarily conserved in nematodes. The
differences between paralogues in all species are small at
the amino acid level and the clustering of EF1-alpha
sequences within species indicates that concerted evolution must have played a role in homogenizing these paralogous copies. If this were not the case then one would
see a very basal dichotomy with the species grouping
reflected within each of those two groups.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/194

Diversity levels
Phylogenetic analysis (Figures 2, 3, 4), and Table 1, indicates that within-species divergence was relatively low for
automictic species. The exception to this was for elongation factor 1-alpha. Here diversity was similar within all
species, although, as discussed above, it is likely that
duplicate (paralogous) gene copies have been sequenced
(Figure 4). Within each phylogenetic gene copy of EF1alpha diversity was again low for automict species. More
diversity was present between sequences in the apomict
group. This diversity was not partitioned between species,
with identical exon sequences being shared between different species for both RNA polymerase II and dystrophin
(Table 1).

Five mtDNA sequences representing the three tropical
apomictic RKN were obtained and added to the published
M. javanica sequence [45] making an alignment of 614 bp.
The mitochondrial sequences were extremely AT-rich
(~80%) and sequence divergences were low (<2%)
between the isolates sequenced and by comparison to a
published sequence [45]. No amplification was obtained
with these primers in any automict. The region of the
mitochondrial genome sequenced does not have a recognizably homologous counterpart in M. hapla [47] and presumably not either in the even more divergent M. fallax
and M. chitwoodi.
Diversity and relative rates of msp genes
The Meloidogyne major sperm protein exon dataset (Figure
5) was examined for relative rates of substitution for all
pairwise combinations of taxa with respect to the outgroup (Pratylenchus penetrans MSP3). No significant test
was observed, with p-values for the apomictic sequences
ranging from 0.147â1.000, indicating that there is no
increased rate of evolution in apomictic msp genes. Fifteen
substitutions in apomictic msp genes were synonymous
and a further seven were non-synonymous. Alignment of
intron sequences, even within the apomict group, was not
straightforward, with small changes in gap weight penalties or manual alignment choices influencing the location
of indels and diversity statistics recovered. It was notable
that the 5' and 3' ends of the introns aligned almost
unambiguously and that this alignment confidence
decayed rapidly once outside of the regions usually associated with the intron splicing sequences. Although exact
quantification of genetic distances without subjective
alignment decisions was difficult, intron sequences were
clearly much more divergent than exon sequences for all
automated or manual alignments considered. A plot of
sequence diversity along msp (Figure 6) highlights the relative diversity of the intron.

Finally, in order to compare the pattern of sequence
change, the msp sequences were divided into two groups

Discussion
It is clear that apomictic Meloidogyne contain divergent
alleles in comparison to the meiotically recombining taxa,
with ASD values larger than those found in automicts
(Table 1). In addition the phylogenetic signal of alleles
within the apomict taxa does not recover species designations identified by traditional methods. These observations are characteristic of the predictions of ASD originally
put forward by Meselson and developed by Birky [7] and
Judson and Normark [4]. In contrast to the expectations
of ancient asexuality however, no evidence is found of
'decay' of the gamete-specific msp sequences. How might
this apparent contradiction be explained?
Causes other than very prolonged periods of asexuality
may also result in the observed difference in ASD between
apomictic and automictic species. Two of these with relevance to the Meloidogyne system are the reduction of diversity in automict species and interspecific hybridization.
Diversity levels in automictic species
Recent work examining the genetics of M. hapla [48] has
highlighted the potential for the automictic meiotic par-

thenogens to rapidly lose diversity. In this mode of reproduction M. hapla regains diploidy by fusing terminal
products of meiosis that contain sister chromatids. Thus
the diploid genome will be homozygous except in those
locations in which both recombination has occurred and
where the chromosomes were initially different at the start
of the first meiotic division. Where apomictic taxa are
closely related to automictic relatives, including the Meloidogyne system presented here, allelic divergences may be
exaggerated in apomictic species by comparison to
automictic species for which the breeding system keeps
allelic divergences low or absent.
Interspecific hybridization
An alternative explanation for large ASD values in
apomictic species is interspecific hybridization. It is
thought that many apomictic species may be of hybrid
origin, a process that can prevent normal meiosis [49,50].
The three most agriculturally important RKN apomicts,
M. incognita, M. arenaria and M. javanica, have been suggested before to have arisen as a result of hybridization
between unspecified automict or sexual taxa [43,51,52].
Certainly, if these taxa possess hybrid genomes their
parental species have not been sampled in this study since
their alleles do not cluster with those from any other species. This may not be too surprising however since
although there are more than eighty species of Meloidogyne
described, only a small number of the major agricultural
pathogens were surveyed here.

Figure diversity
Genetic 6
Genetic diversity. Shannon's alignment uncertainty or "entropy" [67] is plotted along an alignment of apomictic msp
sequences illustrating the variability of the intron with respect to exons.
Evidence of possible interspecific hybrid origins for
apomictic RKN comes from analysis of nuclear rDNA and
internal transcribed spacer sequences [53]. This reveals a
pattern of diversity concordant with those presented here
from nuclear protein coding genes. Apomictic species
show both very divergent ribosomal ITS sequences within
individuals and very similar ones between species. Ribosomal ITS sequences from apomictic species can be placed
into two deeply diverging groups, which presumably represent the divergence of the parental species.
If the major sperm protein has no novel function in
apomictic RKN then the pattern of diversity observed
across the msp sequence alignment (Figure 6) provides
strong evidence for interspecific hybridization. Since this
is data from exclusively apomictic species with a monophyletic origin the mutations observed should have accumulated since the common origin of those taxa. Without
a requirement for functional major sperm protein these
mutations should be approximately randomly distributed, irrespective of whether the origin of the taxa was
recent or ancient. The substitutions however clearly cluster within the intron, strongly suggesting that they have
accumulated over a period in which purifying selection

was operational. If these msp alleles had initially diverged
in sexual species, and had subsequently been brought
together in an interspecifc hybridization event, one would
predict exactly the pattern observed in Figure 6 where the
majority of substitutions occur in the intron.
Although there can be large sequence divergences between
gene copies in a single apomictic RKN individual there is
also striking sequence similarity between apomictic species at some, but not all sequences. Genes may show larger
sequence diversity between "alleles" within individuals
than between the same sequences in different species
(Table 1). Thus M. arenaria has a dystrophin sequence
also shared by M. javanica, although other M. arenaria
sequences differ by as many as 32 substitutions from the
first. For RNA polymerase M. javanica and M. incognita
also posses some identical sequences, although alleles
within these species may differ by 16 changes. If these
asexual species were truly ancient, then one would expect
the minimum sequence divergence to be much greater,
reflecting the many mutations since they last shared a
common ancestor. Similarly, mitochondrial DNA studies
based on RFLPs have indicated very low levels of sequence
divergence between these species [54], and sequencing of

614 bp of non-coding mtDNA in this study also revealed
the three tropical apomicts to be very similar.

mtDNA with the apomicts while the male parent will have
distinct mtDNA.

The ASD data presented here is compatible with the predictions of interspecific hybdridization events, an idea
also discussed by Hugall et al [53] and Castagnone-Sereno
[51]. If females from an ancestor of the tropical apomicts
engaged in interspecific hybridization with males from a
distinct species then sibling lineages would emerge and
might today represent the different apomictic species.
They ought to show several genetic signatures of these
hybridizations. First, they should initially share very similar mtDNA. Second, the nuclear loci within individuals
would exhibit instances of high ASD, reflecting the independent divergence of alleles in two stages; (a) divergence
in different species up until the hybridization event and
(b) divergence since that event due to the absence of
recombination. Thirdly, nuclear loci within individuals
would exhibit instances of low ASD, reflecting that they
were, until the hybridization event, recombining alleles in
a sexual parental species. Fourthly, alleles should exhibit
PAE and not cluster by species since these are mosaic
genomes and individuals have not experienced the type of
coalescence that we observe in sexual species. All these
predictions have been met.

Major Sperm Protein genes in asexual Meloidogyne
It might be anticipated that if meiosis had been abandoned in M. arenaria, M. javanica and M. incognita their
major sperm protein genes would be redundant, and
hence under relaxed selection. It would follow then that
there would be no particular penalty for non-synonymous
changes, frameshifts, or stop codons, and they would
evolve much faster than genes under strong selection to
maintain function (msp in sexual species). In contrast to
this prediction the msp genes in apomicts showed none of
these types of change. Although pseudogenes are common in large multigene families such as msp [22], the msp
genes sequenced from apomictic RKN are unlikely to be
pseudogenes, with no frameshifts or stop codons
observed. As part of this study DNA database searches of
previously published EST collections [55] were carried out
and indicate that msp genes are still expressed in apomictic
M. incognita. Relative rate tests indicate that the sequences
from apomictic taxa are evolving at a similar rate to those
in sexual species, and analysis of the substitution patterns
in msp sequences from apomictic and meiotic species cannot reject that they are the same. Finally, most substitutions since the coalescent of the apomict sequences occur
in the intron, as is typically observed for sequences under
purifying selection. The intron does not appear to be
homogeneous however with relatively few indels or substitutions occurring at the intron boundaries in the
sequence regions typically identified as being important
for correct intron splicing. These patterns of intron diversity were also observed in the three other nuclear genes
sequenced indicating again that they are typical of actively
maintained genes. The primary function of major sperm
protein genes is in the formation of sperm, their expression being restricted to sperm and spermatocytes [20,25].
These sperm proteins are known to act as extracellular signals in C. elegans and are involved in both the resumption
of oocyte meiosis (maturation) and sheath cell contractions involved in ovulation. These two functions are
known to be dependent on different regions of the peptide sequence with amino acids 1â106 influencing maturation but not ovulation and amino acids 106â126 only
ovulation [23]. Since the msp sequences obtained in this
study correspond to amino acids 24â106 the functions of
this regions are likely to be restricted to those involved in
sexual reproduction (sperm structure/movement and the
completion of the oocyte meiosis). Although it could be
that this section of msp has an additional role unrelated to
sexual reproduction, which might still be essential in
ameiotic species, there is no evidence of this in C. elegans
or any other nematode. In addition, a rapid change of
function (such as the loss of the two major functions of
msp with the transition to apomictic reproduction) might

If multiple hybridization events account for the origins of
the apomictic species this can occur in two ways. It is very
likely that since the apomicts share closely related mtDNA
types that their maternal parent was the same or very
closely related. The first option is that females from this
parent species mated with males from several other distinct species. The alternate situation is that females from
the parent species mate with males from a single other
species. These two hypotheses make different predictions.
One would expect that alleles from the female parent
would be found in all apomictic taxa and form a multispecies clade on the tree. In the first case, alleles from the
distinct male parental species would form multiple discrete clades on the tree each containing only individuals
from the single apomictic species descended from that
hybridization event. This is not observed in this study, nor
that of Hugall et al. with rDNA sequences [53]. Unless we
say that the parental species were very closely related and
their alleles were not phylogenetically distinct even before
the hybridization this multi-species origin for the
apomicts can be rejected. The second case predicts that no
single-species clades will be found, as is observed in this
study. The tools for identifying the parental species are
now clear. They will be sexual, or facultatively so, which
can be detected by the presence of homologous chromosome pairs. Both species will have nuclear alleles that cluster within the diversity found at the four nuclear loci of
the apomictic species. The female parent will share

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:194

be expected to be accompanied by a rapid change in evolutionary rate or dN:dS with respect to close sexual relatives, neither of which is observed. Together these results
provide compelling evidence that apomictic RKN msp
sequences are either maintained by selection or that they
have only very recently escaped from such control.
Change in gene function might not necessarily require
large changes in evolutionary rate or amino acid sequence
however, with more subtle changes in sequence or regulation also able to bring about functional change. Detailed
study of the expression and exact role of major sperm proteins in meiotic and ameiotic species will be required to
properly elucidate its action. In summary then, although
the data from ASD is compatible with either ancient asexuality or recent hybrid origins, the lack of synonymous
site sequence divergence, low mtDNA divergence and msp
sequence data are only compatible with a recent origin of
asexuality.
How ancient are the apomictic RKN?
The evidence presented here indicates that although some
of the genetic signatures of long-term asexuality appear to
be fulfilled for RKN, they are more likely to be recent asexuals. No degeneration of msp sequences in apomictic taxa
is observed; with dS>dN and the clustering of mutations
in the intron instead indicating that purifying selection
has been the dominant force shaping sequence diversity.
It is likely therefore that loss of a requirement for apomictic msp occurred very recently (or that the sequences have
alternative functions strongly maintained by selection).
From the almost identical alleles at nuclear loci and the
very shallow mtDNA divergence levels we can reasonably
conclude that these species are only recently diverged
from one another. Although cryptic sexuality might currently seem unlikely for the tropical root knot nematodes,
since careful cytological studies have revealed no evidence
for it, several species previously thought to exhibit obligatory asexuality have been discovered to engage in some
form of sexual reproduction [56-59]. Population genetic
data from wild-caught individuals, or females with associated egg-masses, ought to be an excellent source of data to
understand the nature of reproduction actually occurring
in these and other Meloidogyne species.

If the genomes of these apomicts are hybrids between
divergent species then assessing the coalescent point for
diversity between apomicts using pooled multilocus data
will give an age of separation of the parental taxa, not of
the asexual species themselves. Consequently there will be
a large overestimate of the age of origin of asexual lineages. Sequence based approaches, such as presented here,
can treat sequences as separate entities and thus tease
apart deeper and more recent divergences in the evolutionary history of this important group. It is clear from
this work that the origin of the three main species of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/194

apomictic RKN is very recent indeed, since some
sequences are shared between them without change, even
at synonymous sites. Determining how recent this split is
will require much more sampling, more loci, the development of well-calibrated molecular clocks and appropriate
coalescent population genetics.

Conclusion
The genetic signatures of ancient asexuality are often similar to those produced by interspecific hybridization followed by asexual reproduction, even if this has occurred
recently. Since hybridization as a cause of apomixis is suggested to be common, extreme care is needed when examining putative ancient asexuals by genetic means. The
apomictic tropical root knot nematodes despite sometimes-large allelic sequence divergence and a lack of clustering of alleles as predicted for ancient asexuals, are
almost certainly recent asexuals. In support of this the
apomict species show instances of very small ASD, with
some alleles unchanged between different species, and the
major sperm proteins, a gamete-specific gene family,
show no sign of increased substitution rate, changed substitution pattern, nor pseudogene formation despite no
apparent functional requirement for the maintenance of
these sequences by natural selection. Taken together these
results indicate that these species likely arose recently
through interspecific hybridization events. The diversity
of reproductive strategies present in the genus Meloidogyne, their rapid reproductive rate, ability to be cultured,
rapidly increasing genomic resources and recent origins
will make them a powerful system for the experimental
study of the evolution and maintenance of reproductive
modes.

DNA and amplification
DNA samples of isofemale nematode isolates were provided by colleagues V. Blok and M. Phillips (M. incognita,
Martinique, USA; M. javanica, Spain, Portugal; M. arenaria, Ivory Coast, West Indies; M. mayaguensis, Puerto

meiosis, and none of the 20 amino acid region involved
in signaling for sheath cell contraction [23].
PCR reactions for all loci were typically carried out in a 10
Î¼l volume with 1Ã PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 uM
dNTP, 100 nM each primer and 2 units Taq polymerase.
Cycling conditions were 94Â°C 3 mins; (94Â°C 45 s, 50Â°C
1 min, 72Â°C 2 mins) Ã35; 72Â°C 10 mins.
PCR products were purified using Wizard spin columns
(Promega) and 5 Î¼l ligated into pGEM T-easy (Promega)
or pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) cloning vectors. After transformation, the presence of inserts was confirmed by PCR using
M13 primers. Plasmid DNA was prepared using QIAspin
purification columns (Quiagen). Approximately 1 Î¼g of
plasmid DNA, or 1 Î¼l of colony-PCR product, was used to
inoculate a cycle-sequencing reaction using the ThermoSequenase kit (Amersham/Pharmacia). Template was
sequenced on both strands using fluorescently labeled
M13 primers.
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX [61] and intron
boundaries identified by reference to the nematode splice
signals described in Blumenthal and Steward [44] and the
amino acid sequence of C. elegans. For the msp gene published sequences from close relative Pratylenchus penetrans
was also included as outgroup [60]. Maximum likelihood
phylogenetic analyses were carried out using PHYML
v2.4.4 [62] using the optimal model of sequence evolution identified with MODELGENERATOR v0.83 [46] and
approximate likelihood ratio test support values [63]. The
maximum likelihood model was set with 4 substitution
rate classes with gamma distribution parameter estimated
by PHYML. The potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida (a
close relative of Meloidogyne) was chosen as outgroup for
the elongation factor 1-alpha tree whereas midpoint rooting was employed for RNA polymerase II and dystrophin
trees. Using the described rooting procedures, midpoint
rooting, or rooting with C. elegans made no change to the

branching order of the major groups (unpublished
results). Estimates of nucleotide diversity were obtained
using DNAsp v4 [64]. Relative rate tests and comparison
of codon based ML substitution processes for msp data
were carried out with HYPHY v0.99 [65]. Relative rate
tests were carried out using P. penetrans as the outgroup for
all pairwise combinations of Meloidogyne msp sequences
using the "PaiwiseRelativeRate.bf" test in HYPHY with
codon-based substitution models. For the comparison of
evolutionary change the species were divided into two
pools; those exhibiting meiosis and those reproducing
apomictically. The "TestBranchDNDS.bf" analysis in
HYPHY was then employed to determine if the apomictic
species evolved under different dN (nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site) and dS (synonymous
substitutions per synonymous site) than the rest of the
tree. Absolute number of differences between exon
sequences (Table 1) was calculated using PAUP* [66] with
the data corrected to remove identical sequences recovered from the same isolate as these may represent multiple
instances of the same sequence.
