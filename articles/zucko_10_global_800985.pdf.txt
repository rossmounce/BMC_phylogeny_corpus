Abstract
Background: A central tenet in biochemistry for over 50 years has held that microorganisms, plants and, more
recently, certain apicomplexan parasites synthesize essential aromatic compounds via elaboration of a complete
shikimic acid pathway, whereas metazoans lacking this pathway require a dietary source of these compounds. The
large number of sequenced bacterial and archaean genomes now available for comparative genomic analyses
allows the fundamentals of this contention to be tested in prokaryotes. Using Hidden Markov Model profiles (HMM
profiles) to identify all known enzymes of the pathway, we report the presence of genes encoding shikimate
pathway enzymes in the hypothetical proteomes constructed from the genomes of 488 sequenced prokaryotes.
Results: Amongst free-living prokaryotes most Bacteria possess, as expected, genes encoding a complete shikimic
acid pathway, whereas of the culturable Archaea, only one was found to have a complete complement of
recognisable enzymes in its predicted proteome. It may be that in the Archaea, the primary amino-acid sequences
of enzymes of the pathway are highly divergent and so are not detected by HMM profiles. Alternatively,
structurally unrelated (non-orthologous) proteins might be performing the same biochemical functions as those
encoding recognized genes of the shikimate pathway. Most surprisingly, 30% of host-associated (mutualistic,
commensal and pathogenic) bacteria likewise do not possess a complete shikimic acid pathway. Many of these
microbes show some degree of genome reduction, suggesting that these host-associated bacteria might sequester
essential aromatic compounds from a parasitised host, as a ‘shared metabolic adaptation’ in mutualistic symbiosis,
or obtain them from other consorts having the complete biosynthetic pathway. The HMM results gave 84%
agreement when compared against data in the highly curated BioCyc reference database of genomes and
metabolic pathways.
Conclusions: These results challenge the conventional belief that the shikimic acid pathway is universal and
essential in prokaryotes. The possibilities that non-orthologous enzymes catalyse reactions in this pathway
(especially in the Archaea), or that there exist specific uptake mechanisms for the acquisition of shikimate
intermediates or essential pathway products, warrant further examination to better understand the precise
metabolic attributes of host-beneficial and pathogenic bacteria.

Background
Chorismic acid is the direct precursor of many aromatic
compounds, including aromatic amino acids, folate, ubiquinones and other isoprenoid quinones [1]. The biosynthesis of chorismic acid occurs via the shikimic acid

pathway in the seven enzyme-mediated steps shown in
Figure 1. Considered restricted to bacteria, fungi, yeasts,
algae, plants and certain apicomplexan parasites, the
lack of a shikimic acid pathway in metazoans, including
humans, is evinced by their dietary requirements for
aromatic compounds. The universality of this traditional
view has been challenged previously by our finding of
genes encoding enzymes for the shikimic acid pathway
in the genome of a basal metazoan, the starlet sea

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the shikimic acid pathway. The first step is an aldol condensation between phosphoenol pyruvate [1]
and erythrose-4-phosphate [2] catalyzed by 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHP, or aroG/F/H according to E. coli
nomenclature, EC 4.1.2.15) to synthesize 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate [3]. The second step is carried out by 3-dehydroquinate
synthase (DHQ synthase, aroB, EC 4.6.1.3), affording 3-dehydroquinate [4]. The third step synthesizes 3-dehydroshikimate [5] catalyzed by 3dehydroquinate dehydratase (DH-quinase, aroD, EC 4.2.1.10). Step 4 is catalyzed by shikimate dehydrogenase (Shikimate_DH, aroE, EC 1.1.1.25) to
synthesize shikimate [6]. Steps 5 and 6 are catalyzed by shikimate kinase (SKI, aroK, EC 2.7.1.71) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase
(EPSP, aroA, EC 2.5.1.19) to give shikimate-3-phosphate [7] and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate [8], respectively. The last reaction, catalyzed
by chorismate synthase (aroC, EC 4.6.1.4) affords the final product of the pathway, chorismate [9].

anemone Nematostella vectensis, a cnidarian [2]. Bioinformatic analyses established that horizontal transfer of
ancestral genes of the shikimic acid pathway into the N.
vectensis genome occurred from both bacteria and algae
(a dinoflagellate). Molecular evidence suggesting also the
presence of an unsuspected bacterial symbiont in this
sea anemone gives a complementary view for the biogenesis of shikimate-related metabolites as a “shared
metabolic adaptation” between the symbiotic partners [2]. Similarly, analysis of the genomes of aphids
reveals genes acquired from endosymbiotic bacteria by
lateral transfer, genes that after subsequent deletion by
the bacterial symbiont underlie the obligate nature of
the metabolic relationship in Buchnera spp. [3].
In a comparative genomic study of four thermophilic
microorganisms (Aquiflex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and
Methanococcus jannaschii), genes encoding DAHP
synthase and DHQ synthase (the first two steps in the
pathway) appear missing from these archaeans [4]. For
genes to be missing from an essential biosynthetic pathway might be accounted for by the presence of genes
having low sequence similarity to the known genes, or
substitution by alternative enzymes having an analogous
function. Another possibility is that steps of a biosynthetic pathway may be bypassed if substrates and endproducts are readily obtained from the surrounding
environment [5]. Evolutionary pressures would then lead
to loss of genes encoding discrete elements of the pathway, which is an underlying cause of extreme genome
reduction and instability as observed in the small

genomes of some intracellular pathogens and symbionts,
e.g. Mycobacterium leprae, Rickettsia, Bartonella and
Buchnera [6-8]. The recent surge in microbial genome
sequencing has produced a wealth of genetic data available for comparative genomic analyses to make possible
the identification of diverse essential enzymes in critical
metabolic pathways within the Archaea and Bacteria.
Here we interrogate the hypothetical proteomes of prokaryotes, constructed from their published genomes, to
profile the universality of the shikimic acid pathway with
a view to understanding a key metabolic process of freeliving and host-associated bacteria.

Results
Hypothetical proteomes translated from the completed
genomes of 488 prokaryotes listed in the NCBI database
were interrogated using HMM profiles generated to
describe enzymes of the pathway [Table 1]. There is a
high degree of amino acid sequence diversity amongst
the 3-dehydroquinate synthase and shikimate kinase
enzymes. For this reason, two separate HMM models
were generated for each of these enzymes and the best
bit-scores, e-values and protein coverage were utilized for
analysing the predicted microbial proteomes. A cut-off
score of >50 with a stringent e-value of <10 -8 were
required, together with protein coverage of >90%, for
inclusion of an enzyme in the hypothetical proteome. It
was expected that as an essential anabolic sequence, the
shikimic acid pathway would be under strong selective
constraints and that most prokaryotes would have a complete and recognizably conserved pathway. Surprisingly,

this was not the case: although two thirds (69%) of the
predicted prokaryotic proteomes contained a complete
shikimic acid pathway, nearly one-third (31%) did not
[Table 2].
The proteomes were then divided according to the
two prokaryotic domains, the Bacteria and the Archaea.
The proteomes of Bacteria studied could be further
divided into free-living and host-associated phenotypes.
Of the free-living bacteria [Additional File 1], most as
expected contained a complete pathway [Table 2], and
those having an incomplete pathway were missing just
one or two enzymes [Figure 2], although there was no
pattern to which enzymes were absent [Figure 3]. Of the
host-associated bacteria, which included pathogenic,

commensal and mutualistic relationships [Additional
File 2], surprisingly more than one-quarter (91/295 proteomes) of these bacteria had an incomplete pathway,
missing one or more enzymes [Table 3]. Of these bacteria, most appear refractory to culture [Table 3]. As
with the other prokaryotic proteomes studied, there was
no overall pattern to which enzymes of the pathway
were absent [Figures 4 and 5].
Of the Archaea sequencing projects to date, all of the
selected microorganisms are free-living and have not
been described as usually associated with a known host.
Table 2 [and Additional File 3] shows that all except one
(45/46) of the archaeans have an incomplete pathway,
missing generally only one or two enzymes [Figure 6],

All bacteria are reported in the literature as host-associated (pathogenic,
commensal or mutualistic). Species that are reported to yield to laboratory
culture ex hospite were classed as culturable.

predominantly either DAHP synthase or shikimate kinase
[Figure 7]. Previous genomic surveys of the distribution
of genes encoding the shikimic acid pathway in a limited
number of archaeans have shown by sequence comparison methods that these two enzymes are frequently missing [4], in the case of shikimate kinase perhaps as a result
of a non-orthologous displacement by an enzyme distantly related to homoserine kinases (EC 2.7.1.39) of the
GHMP-kinase superfamily [9]. To test this hypothesis, a
HMM profile for the GHMP kinases was developed and
tested against the proteomes of Achaea, as well as freeliving and host-associated Bacteria. The proteomes of all
488 prokaryotes were found to contain a serine kinase

enzyme, however, it is likely that our model for GHMP
kinases was not specific for the shikimate kinase previously reported [9] and instead identified all serine
kinase enzymes encoded in the archaean genomes. It has
also been shown in Escherichia coli that 2-keto-3-deoxy6-phosphogalactonate (KDPGal) aldolase provides an
alternative reaction to that catalyzed by DAHP synthase
(the first step in the pathway) for the synthesis of 3deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate from phosphoenol pyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate [10]. Analysis of the 14 E. coli proteomes available showed that all
14 contained DAHP synthase while 13/14 contained
KDPGal aldolase. However, the HMM profile constructed to recognise KDPGal aldolase could only
demonstrate the presence of this enzyme in 14 of the 108
prokaryotic proteomes from which DAHP synthase was
missing [Additional Files 4, 5, 6].
Results were also checked against the BioCyc curated
reference database of bacterial genomes and metabolic
pathways [11]. Overall, the results were in agreement in
84% of cases (Additional Files 7, 8, 9). Of the 85 nonhost associated bacteria represented in the database, 75
were predicted to contain a complete complement of
shikimic acid pathway enzymes when compared to the
HMM models. An additional 4 complete pathways were
detected that were missed by the rapid, yet automated

Figure 4 HMM analysis showing the distribution of enzymes forming the shikimic acid pathway in the predicted proteomes of 250
host-associated Bacteria that can be cultured in the laboratory ex hospite shows that there is a nearly equal loss of enzymes across

HMM search. The HMM search did, however, predict 4
complete pathways that were missing in the BioCyc
database. Similarly, of the 204 host-associated bacteria
that were evaluated using the BioCyc database, 168 were
found to contain a complete shikimic acid pathway
using both BioCyc and HMM searches, with 23 additional complete pathways detected using BioCyc and 12
additional complete pathways detected by the HMM
search (Additional File 8). For the Archaea, 33 proteomes could be evaluated, of which 27 were common
to both searches with 5 additional complete pathways
found in the BioCyc database and 1 using the HMM
search (Additional File 9). In searching the human genome for genes encoding enzymes of the shikimic acid
pathway, only one previously annotated gene was found
when interrogated using HMM profiles. This alignment
gave a score of 149 with an e-value of 10-44, but corresponded only to the ATP-binding domain of shikimate
kinase encoded on chromosome 10 (accession number
NT_008705.15).

Discussion
The shikimic acid pathway is well recognized in classical
biochemistry to be essential for the synthesis of aromatic compounds in prokaryotes, fungi, certain apicomplexans and plants [1]. The lack of the shikimic acid

pathway in metazoans, most notably humans as evinced
by our dietary requirement for shikimate-derived aromatic compounds, has stimulated much study of this
pathway as a possible target for antimicrobial chemotherapy [12]. The emergence of microbial pathogens
resistant to many drugs in our current pharmacopeia
has prompted widespread efforts to identify suitable
novel targets for the design of antimicrobial drugs that
lack untoward side effects and, since the pathway is
lacking in humans, forms a rational basis for drug selectivity in lead target identification [13,14]. Accordingly,
the structure and evolution of this pathway in eukaryotes has been comprehensively investigated [15],
although conservation of the pathway in prokaryotes has
not been subjected to widespread comparative genomic
analysis. A pan-genomic bioinformatics evaluation of the
conservation of enzymes forming the shikimic acid pathway in prokaryotes was therefore undertaken using
automated HMM searching, leading to the unexpected
result that nearly one-third of all prokaryotes examined
lack a complete, recognizable pathway [Table 2]. Our
results were comparable to data in the comprehensively
curated BioCyc database (Additional Files 7, 8, 9). Data,
however, had to be extracted from this database manually which proved labour intensive and time consuming,
nevertheless useful for method validation.

Zucko et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:628
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/628

Expression of the shikimic acid pathway is regulated
via feedback inhibition by pathway intermediates and
downstream products [16]. Although a variety of functional, biophysical, and fitness-related variables influence
the evolutionary rates of proteins [17], the level of gene
expression is one of the major determinants [18]. If a
protein is highly expressed, its overall indispensability to
the organism is greater than if it were expressed only at
low levels, so that the functionally active amino acid
residues of the protein would be under strong purifying
selection [19]. Such selection on a large number of
these protein residues leads to an overall reduced evolutionary rate and overall conservation of the metabolic
pathway, since mutations in essential proteins are apt to
be deleterious [20]. Regulation of the shikimic acid pathway can, therefore, be coupled to the exogenous availability of products of its component enzymes, giving a
positive selective force leading to the loss of pathway
genes. This follows from the surprising result that large
numbers of host-associated bacteria lack a complete shikimic acid pathway.
Many of these bacteria are associated with the human
microbiome, but no enzymes of the shikimic acid pathway could be detected using the HMM profiles on the
translated human genome. This supports current dogma
that the human host does not synthesize shikimatederived aromatic compounds de novo, and leads to the
strong inference that human-associated heterotrophic
bacteria having genomes that encode an incomplete shikimic acid pathway may have evolved highly efficient
means of extracting essential shikimate-related metabolites from their microbial environment. In symbiosis this
could be from trophically derived metabolites assimilated
by the host or from metabolites produced by other bacterial consorts having a complete and functional shikimic
acid pathway. Uptake mechanisms for intermediates in
the shikimic acid pathway and for some of the products
of chorismate-utilizing enzymes are known in bacteria.
For example, the shikimate permease ShiA [21], various
aromatic amino acid permeases [22], and transporters for
vitamins [23] and folic acid [24] are known, but the full
phylogenetic distribution of these uptake systems and
their relevance in complementing shikimic acid pathwaydepleted prokaryotes are yet to be determined. Sequestering of other shikimate-derived metabolites, for example,
ubiquinones, menaquinones, iron chelating siderophores
and vitamins remains unknown. Substituting these essential metabolites into synthetic growth media might be
one approach to successfully culturing those symbionts
so far refractory to laboratory culture ex hospite.
On examination of the 91 host-associated bacteria
lacking a complete pathway in detail [Additional File 1],
most (67/91) had lost five or more of the genes encoding enzymes of the shikimic acid pathway, whereas

Page 8 of 10

nearly all of the rest (20/91) have only lost a single
enzyme. In the entire set of host-associated bacteria,
genes encoding the seven different enzymes are lost
rather uniformly [Figure 4], with the first enzyme of the
pathway accounting for only 67/440 of lost genes. However, in the 20 host-associated bacteria that have only
lost one gene, the majority (16/20) have lost the gene
encoding the first enzyme of the pathway. This pattern
would be expected if selection were occurring under
conditions in which the pathway was induced, because a
later block might result in the accumulation of redundant intermediates of the pathway, which would likely
be deleterious for the bacterium. A possible scenario is
that functional loss of the shikimic acid pathway could
be an early step toward sustaining a host-associated life
style in which bacteria are prevented from outgrowing
their hosts in times of nutritional stress.
The phylogenetically widespread and differential lack
of orthologous genes encoding shikimic acid pathway
enzymes in free-living Archaea [Figures 6, 7] seems unlikely to be circumvented by evolving specific uptake
mechanisms for essential aromatic compounds since
metabolites derived from the shikimic acid pathway are
known to be limiting in natural environments. Indeed,
the presence of these compounds secreted by bacteria
can act as predatory chemoattractants for soil amoebae
[24]. Given the variability in which particular enzymes
are missing from such a wide sample of the Archaea
and host-associated Bacteria, cultivable or not, there is
no easy genetic explanation for this loss, since the genes
encoding individual enzymes of the shikimate pathway
are not clustered in these prokaryotes [Additional
File 10]. In bacteria there is evidence for the intriguing
possibility that in pathway equilibrium, lost intermediates from “missing” enzymic reactions could be supplied
by reverse biosynthesis, as was demonstrated in E. coli
for quinic and dehydroquinic acids derived from shikimic acid uptake [25].
Reductive evolution is the process whereby host-associated consorts decrease their genome size by abandoning genes that are needed by free-living microorganisms
but that are dispensable when living in association if
essential gene products are readily available from the
host or from other symbiotic partners. A domino effect
would follow: the more enzymes that are lost, the less
likely are bacteria able to survive without the provision
of shikimate pathway intermediates or end-products,
driving survival toward obligate symbiotic associations
and loss of the metabolic independence needed for culture ex hospite. This scenario is especially true for the
accelerated evolution of endosymbiotic lineages as
expected by the combined effects of the accumulation of
irreversible mutations (Muller’s ratchet) and mutational
bias [26].

Zucko et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:628
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/628

The most obvious explanation for “missing” enzymes
is the existence of functionally equivalent proteins that
lack homology to the HMM models used in this study.
Examples of non-orthologous gene replacements encoding enzymes that catalyze the same reaction indeed are
known for the shikimic acid pathway and were tested in
this study. These include the first step catalyzed by
DAHP synthase [13], and the fifth step, catalyzed by shikimate kinase [12]. However, in our study there was no
evidence based on HMM profiling using the nonorthologous proteins as models to indicate that such
non-orthologous enzymes replaced those missing in the
prokaryotes studied, which strongly suggests that other
enzymes that have yet to be identified may fill these
gaps [Additional File 4, 5, 6]. This would suggest that, at
least in the Archaea, these prokaryotes can synthesize
aromatic compounds by a novel biochemical pathway
that is yet to be discovered. Indeed, examining the
nutritional requirements of the Archaea, as evinced by a
survey of the growth media recommended by the DSMZ
culture collection http://www.dsmz.de/, reveals that
most of the favoured media are minimal, lacking exogenous aromatic amino acids.

Conclusions
This comparative bioinformatics analysis of genes of the
shikimic acid pathway in prokaryotes provides essential
details that should help guide the choice of key organisms for future studies designed to reveal new metabolic
processes in shikimic acid biosynthesis or to validate the
loss of key biosynthetic genes. Such studies will
undoubtedly provide new insight into the evolutionary
history of the shikimic acid pathway that is particularly
important in understanding how pathogenic bacteria
synthesize or acquire shikimate-derived products and
thus to identify new targets for antibiotic treatment.

This study analysed the completed genome sequences of
organisms on the NCBI Microbial Genome Projects
page http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi
listed on June 3, 2009. The genomes were grouped
using the ‘all bacteria’ and ‘all archaea’ selection tool
and then filtered using the ‘organism info’ page to select

‘pathogenic in’ and ‘habitat - host associated’. Free-living
prokaryotes were taken as all other entries with the key
words ‘habitat - multiple, aquatic, specialized or terrestrial’. The predicted proteomes from these genomes for
each of the prokaryotes were downloaded from the FTP
server at the NCBI ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/. The DNA sequences of all 23 haploid chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA of the human genome
