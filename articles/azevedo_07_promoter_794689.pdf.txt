Abstract
Background: Heterologous promoter analysis in Plasmodium has revealed the existence of
conserved cis regulatory elements as promoters from different species can drive expression of
reporter genes in heterologous transfection assays. Here, the functional characterization of
different Plasmodium vivax promoters in Plasmodium falciparum using luciferase as the reporter gene
is presented.
Methods: Luciferase reporter plasmids harboring the upstream regions of the msp1, dhfr, and vir3
genes as well as the full-length intergenic regions of the vir23/24 and ef-1α genes of P. vivax were
constructed and transiently transfected in P. falciparum.
Results: Only the constructs with the full-length intergenic regions of the vir23/24 and ef-1α genes
were recognized by the P. falciparum transcription machinery albeit to values approximately two
orders of magnitude lower than those reported by luc plasmids harbouring promoter regions from
P. falciparum and Plasmodium berghei. A bioinformatics approach allowed the identification of a motif
(GCATAT) in the ef-1α intergenic region that is conserved in five Plasmodium species but is
degenerate (GCANAN) in P. vivax. Mutations of this motif in the P. berghei ef-1α promoter region
decreased reporter expression indicating it is active in gene expression in Plasmodium.
Conclusion: Together, this data indicates that promoter regions of P. vivax are poorly or not
recognized by the P. falciparum transcription machinery suggesting the existence of P. vivax-specific
transcription regulatory elements.

Background
Control of gene expression in malaria parasites seems
unique among eukaryotes. Thus, global expression analysis of the intraerythrocytic cycle of Plasmodium falciparum
at 1 h resolution demonstrated a tight regulation in which
most genes are transcribed only once in the life cycle [1].
These include genes constitutively expressed in other
organisms such as calmodulin, ribosomes, and histones,

among others. Moreover, very few transcription factors
mostly involved in RNA binding and possibly RNA stability have been annotated [2]. Furthermore, cooperation
between introns and promoters has been demonstrated to
be important for the silencing of var genes [3]. In addition, close to 10% of the parasite genes are transcribed by
Pol II as antisense transcripts whose function, if any, is
presently unknown [4,5]. Together, this data calls for a

better understanding of control of gene expression in
malaria parasites as it can reveal alternative control strategies.
The advent of transfection technology in Plasmodium
allowed initiating functional studies of promoters [6-8].
Like higher eukaryotes, promoters of protein coding genes
in malaria are transcribed by polymerase II and have a
bipartite structure with a basal promoter followed by
upstream regulatory elements [9]. Indeed, TATA boxes
[10], INR elements [11] or downstream elements [12]
could be acting depending on the promoter. Unlike
higher eukaryotes however, the few cis acting elements
functionally identified are distinct from their homologues
in other higher eukaryotes [12-19], and the only transcription factor functionally characterized, the TATA binding
protein (TBP), contains a C-terminus with low similarity
compared to other TBPs [10]. In addition, the transcriptional machinery of malaria parasites is unable to recognize promiscuous viral promoters such as the CMV and
SV40 promoters widely used in heterologous systems. Yet,
important elements for transcriptional control are conserved among different Plasmodium species as promoters
from different species drove the expression of reporter
genes in heterologous transfection systems in the same
pattern and activation timing of homologous systems [2023]. To date however, no functional analysis of promoters
from P. vivax, the most widely distributed human malaria
parasites, have been conducted.
P. vivax infects reticulocytes, produces lower parasitaemia
and rarely kills the host as compared to P. falciparum.
Interestingly, its genome harbors regions with distinct ATcontent in which central regions are GC-rich and syntenic
with P. falciparum whereas subtelomeric regions are ATrich and P. vivax-specific [24]. The objective of this study
was to characterize P. vivax promoters having different ATcontent through heterologous transient transfections in P.
falciparum. We showed that P. vivax promoters are poorly
or not recognized by the P. falciparum transcriptional
machinery independent of the AT-content. Moreover, a
functional regulatory motif identical in five Plasmodium
species but degenerate in P. vivax was identified in the promoter region of the elongation factor one alpha (ef-1α)
gene. This data suggests the existence of P. vivax-specific
transcription regulatory elements.

Methods
Plasmid construction
Plasmid pE(A)b.luc.^D harbors the intergenic region
between the two Plasmodium berghei ef-1α genes, the firefly
luciferase gene and the P. berghei dhfr 3' UTR and has been
previously described [25]. Excepting for plasmid pPvmsp1, all other plasmids were constructed by digesting
pE(A)b.luc.^D with NdeI and/or HindIII, making it blunt

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/20

and replacing the P. berghei ef-1α intergenic region by the
intergenic regions of the P. vivax dhfr (0.733 kbp), msp1
(1.3 kb), vir3 (1.8 kb), vir24 (1.3 kb), and ef-1α (1.4 kp).
All intergenic regions from P. vivax were amplified with
specific oligonucleotides (Table 1), subcloned into
pGEM-T (Promega) or pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and after
being released from the vectors with appropriate restriction enzymes all inserts were cloned into pE(A)b.luc.^D.
Plasmid pPv-msp1 was constructed by replacing the hrp3
promoter region from plasmid pHLH (kindly donated by
Dr. Thomas Wellems) with 1,326 bp of the intergenic
region from the P. vivax msp1 gene from the Sal-I strain.
The P. falciparum ef-1α intergenic region was PCR amplified, cloned in both orientations in pPCR4-TOPO,
digested with NotI, blunted, digested with SpeI and cloned
in p0,5A(tetO)5' (NdeI/blunt/NheI), creating pPf-EF(A)
and pPf-EF(B). p0,5A(tetO)5' is a plasmid derived from
pE(A)b.luc.^D with approximately half of the Pb ef-1α
promoter region. Plasmids with one or two copies of the
EF motif were made by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides EFM01 and EFM01-2 (Table 1), cloning it
in pPv-EF(B) (HindIII/blunt) to create plasmid pPv-EF(B)HEF and then cloning it in pPv-EF(B)-HEF (NdeI/blunt)
to create pPv-EF(B)-HNEF. Plasmids with mutated versions of the EF motif were made by site directed mutagenesis of pE(A)b.luc.^D. For all constructs, the thimidines
(T) on positions 4 and 6 were replaced by cytosines (C).
pE(A)b.luc.^D was hyper methilated, amplified by
inverse PCR with oligonucletides mutPbEF1cc-F and
mutPbEF1cc-R and transformed into DH5α-T1 cells (Invitrogen) to created pPb-1cc. Plasmid pPb-2cc containing
the second EF motif mutated was created following the
same methodology and using pE(A)b.luc.^D as a template and oligonucleotides mutPbEF2cc-F and
mutPbEF2cc-R (Table 1). To make plasmid pPv-EF(B)Pb0,2A, the P. vivax ef-1α intergenic region was cloned in
pCR4-TOPO, digested with NotI, made blunt, digested
with SpeI and cloned into pE(A)b.luc.^D (HindIII/blunt/
SpeI). Plasmid pPv-EF(B) was created by digesting
pE(A)b.luc.^D with NdeI, making it blunt and digesting it
with KpnI, releasing the luc-dhfr 3' UTR cassette, which was
cloned in pPv-EF(B)-Pb0,2A (Spe1/blunt/KpnI). pPvEF(B)-Pb0,2A contains a minimal promoter of circa 0.2 kb
from P. berghei. Authenticity of all plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Parasite culture and transfection
The P. falciparum 3D7 clone was continuously cultured in
vitro [26] and transiently transfected as described elsewhere [27,28]. Briefly, 100 μg of each plasmid were used
to electroporate 600 μl of uninfected red blood cells and
this mix was added to about 107 parasites, which were
kept in culture. Parasites were harvested 4 days after
eletroporation and luciferase assays performed according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).

Luciferase assay
Erythrocytes were harvested by saponin lysis, parasites
washed twice in PBS and pellets ressuspended in 50 μl of
1× lysis buffer (Promega). To 20 μl of lysed parasites, 100
μl of luciferase essay reagent (Promega) were added and
luciferase activity measured in the Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG and G Berthold) for 45 seconds. Reporter
activity values represent the mean of at least three independent experiments done with two or three different
DNA preparations. They are expressed in relation to the
values of a reference control plasmid indicated in each
experiment. Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the data (p value ≤ 0.005).
Bioinformatics analysis
Sequences of the intergenic region between the two ef-1α
genes of six Plasmodium species (Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium reichenowi, Plasmodium yoelii, P. falciparum, P.
berghei and P. vivax) were retrieved from PlasmoDB [29].
The Gibbs matrices algorithm [30] of the Regulatory
Sequence Analysis tools [31] was used to search conserved
motifs in these intergenic regions. This algorithm finds
optimized local alignments in related sequences in order
to detect short conserved regions or motifs that may not
be in the same positions. The matrix length was set from
4 to 20, which allowed the detection of very short and also
longer and more complex conserved sequences. Matrices
generated, which represent the nucleotide conservation in
each position of the motifs, were used to search for the
motifs positions, copy number and conservation using
the Patser algorithm [32]. The Patser algorithm was
applied to each of the matrices generated from the Gibbs
analysis and sequences of the intergenic regions. The
Alphabet parameter was set to a:t 0.4 c:g 0.1. Sequences of
the most conserved motifs were input in the WebLogo
program [33] to generate the visual representation of the

sequence of the motif in the P. vivax intergenic region.

Results
Upstream regions of the P. vivax dhfr, msp1, and vir3
genes are not recognized by the P. falciparum
transcription machinery
Initially, luciferase reporter plasmids containing 0.733 kB
of the 5' upstream region of the P. vivax dhfr-ts gene with
circa 49% AT-content (pPv-dhfr), 1.326 kbp of the
upstream region of the P. vivax msp1 gene with circa 59%
AT-content (pPv-msp1), and 1.818 kbp of the upstream
region of vir3 gene with circa 81% AT-content (pPv-vir3),
were constructed (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, transient
transfections of these recombinant plasmids into P. falciparum produced luciferase activity values similar to the
background where the luminescence of the substrate
alone or of the plasmid p-.luc^D, which has luciferase, P.
berghei 3'UTR, but no promoter, was measured and used
as negative controls. This contrasts with parasites transfected with plasmid pE(A)b.luc.^D which contains a P.
berghei promoter and had been previously shown to give
high luciferase values in transient transfections assays in
P. berghei and P. falciparum [23,25]. This plasmid was used
as reference and positive control plasmid throughout this
study (Figure 1B).
Entire intergenic regions of vir and ef-1α genes from P.
vivax contain minimal promoter elements poorly
recognized by the P. falciparum transcriptional machinery
To guarantee that all cis acting regulatory elements within
P. vivax promoter regions were included in these transient
transfection assays, a new plasmid termed pPv-vir24 containing the entire 1.3 kb intergenic region between vir23
and vir24 genes [34] was constructed (Figure 2A). Transient transfection of pPv-vir24 into P. falciparum produced

luciferase activity levels significantly above background,
suggesting this P. vivax intergenic region contains cis regulatory elements capable to recruit the P. falciparum transcriptional machinery (Figure 2B). However, the reporter
activity was about 1% of that observed with the positive
control (pE(A)b.luc.^D) indicating poor recognition of
these cis regulatory elements.
To provide further evidences of this observation, reporter
plasmids with the entire intergenic regions of the ef-1α
genes of P. falciparum, P. berghei and P. vivax were transfected into P. falciparum. These genes are orthologs in Plasmodium containing two copies each per haploid genome
in opposite orientations. In addition, the ef-1α intergenic
region from P. berghei had already been functionally characterized and shown to have promoter activity in both orientations in P. berghei and in P. falciparum [23,25]. As
shown in Figure 2, recombinant plasmids harboring the
entire intergenic regions of the ef-1α genes from P. falciparum and P. berghei reported high and comparable luciferase values in either orientation. In contrast, plasmids
containing the intergenic region of the ef-1α genes of P.
vivax, cloned in both orientations, reported luc values relative to pE(A)b.luc.^D that were 0.8% (pPv-EF(A)), which
is not significantly different from the negative control,
and 2.7% (pPv-EF(B)), which is significantly above background (Figure 2B). Together, these results indicate that
cis regulatory elements within promoter regions of P. vivax
are poorly or not recognized by the transcriptional
machinery of P. falciparum.
A 6 bp motif is divergent in the P. vivax ef-1α intergenic
region
An in silico approach was undertaken to identify divergent
elements in the P. vivax ef-1α intergenic region. The ef-1α
intergenic regions of six Plasmodium species (P. berghei, P.
falciparum, P. knowlesi, P. reichenowi, P. yoelii and P. vivax)
were searched for conserved motifs using the Gibbs sampling and Patser algorithms [30,32]. Some short motifs,
conserved in all Plasmodium species were found. These
included homopolymeric poly(dA)poly(dT) tracts,
poly(dAT) tracts and also GC rich motifs (data not
shown). Using a matrix length of 27, the motif TGG [G/
T]G [C/T]T [A/T] [A/T]GAGGGGTGA [A/G]C [A/C] [G/
T]TTAAA was found. This sequence is conserved in the
intergenic region of P. berghei, P. falciparum, P. reichenowi
and P. yoelii, but not in P. vivax and P. knowlesi, where the
central part of the motif is conserved (GAGGGGTG), but
the extremities are degenerate. This data indicated that P.
vivax and its evolutionary related species P. knowlesi could
share motifs distinct from the species with AT rich
genomes. When the matrix length was set to six, a motif
(GCATAT) identical among all Plasmodium species excepting P. vivax (GCANAN) was found. The Patser algorithm
was used to determine its position, conservation and copy

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/20

number in the six ef-1α intergenic regions. The motif is
present in two to five copies and its position relative to the
start codon of the two ef-1α genes is maintained in pairs
of phylogenetically closely related parasites P. falciparum/
P. reichenowi and P. berghei/P. yoelii, but not in P. vivax/P.
knowlesi (Figure 3A). This motif, referred to here as the EF
motif, has no similarities to known eukaryotic transcription-factor binding sites.
The EF motif is active in gene expression
Since the highly conserved EF motif is degenerate only in
P. vivax, two complementary approaches were performed
to demonstrate that it is active in gene expression. Firstly,
two recombinant plasmids containing one or two copies
of the EF motif in the P. vivax ef-1α intergenic region, were
generated (Figure 3B). pPv-EF(B)-HEF, having one copy
of the EF motif, significantly reduced the promoter
strength to 65% whereas pPv-EF(B)-HNEF, having two
copies of the EF motif in different strands, restored
reporter activity close to values of the original plasmid
pPv-EF(B) (Figure 3C). Secondly, the EF motif in the P.
berghei ef-1α promoter was mutated to create a sequence
similar to the motif of P. vivax. To do so, thymidines (T)
on positions 4 and 6 of the first or the second copy of the
EF motif in plasmid pE(A)b.luc.^D were mutated to cytidines (C) (Figure 4A). Interestingly, luciferase activity significantly dropped to 56% and 55% relative to activity
detected with the original plasmid (Figure 4B). Together,
this data suggests that both copies of the EF motif are
important for promoter activity and that this motif is
active in gene expression in Plasmodium.

Discussion
Here, heterologous promoter analysis of the P. vivax dhfr,
msp1 and vir3 genes as well as the entire intergenic regions
of the vir23/24 and ef-1α genes in P. falciparum, is presented. Noticeable, in spite of being from another human
malaria parasite, cis regulatory elements within promoter
regions of P. vivax are poorly or not recognized by the
transcriptional machinery of P. falciparum. An in silico
search of cis regularory sequences in Plasmodium, identified a conserved identical 6 bp element (GCATAT) in the
ef-1α intergenic regions of six Plasmodium species analyzed. The exception was P. vivax where this element was
degenerate (GCANAN). Functional analysis of this element through site-directed mutagenesis showed that it is
active in gene expression in Plasmodium. This data demonstrated that important cis regulatory elements are lacking
or divergent in the P. vivax promoter regions reported
here.
Previous studies have shown that cis regulatory elements
within promoter regions of different species of Plasmodium can drive gene expression in heterologous transfection assays [20-23]. Due to the difficulties in maintaining

P. vivax continuously in culture, heterologous promoter
analysis was used to determine if P. vivax promoter
regions of different sizes and AT-contents are functional in
P. falciparum. Interestingly the dhfr, msp1 and vir3
upstream regions analyzed, harboring very distinct AT
contents were unable to recruit the transcriptional
machinery of P. falciparum as determined by the lack of
luciferase reporter activity. Size of promoter regions in
Plasmodium however, varies considerably in genes of the
same species and in the same gene among the different
species. Thus, it was formally possible that the promoter
regions for these P. vivax genes reside in longer intergenic
regions as those used in the constructs. To exclude this
possibility, full intergenic regions of the P. vivax vir23/
vir24 genes and ef-1α A/B genes were chosen to determine
whether P. vivax promoters were poorly recognized by P.
falciparum. Luciferase values significantly above the background were detected in plasmids bearing these entire
intergenic regions demonstrating that they were able to
recruit the transcriptional machinery of P. falciparum. Yet,
values were about two orders of magnitude lower than
plasmids bearing promoter regions from P. berghei showing poor recognition. Interestingly, although the P. falciparum ef-1α intergenic region is longer and AT richer
(1,752 bp/89.7% AT) than the P. berghei promoter region
(1,052 bp/83.7% AT), reporter activity was not significantly different indicating that cis regulatory elements are
conserved in these two species. These results suggest that
cis acting elements are divergent in P. vivax. Alternatively,
translation efficiency and/or RNA stability of the luciferase transcript in P. falciparum is lower in the context of
the P. vivax 5' UTRs.

approaches suggest that the EF motif is functional in gene
expression in Plasmodium. Of importance, in silico analysis
of the P. vivax and P. falciparum genomes revealed the
presence of this motif in several upstream regions further
suggesting its functional role in gene expression.

A bioinformatics approach recently enabled a functional
regulatory element in the promoter region of the malaria
heat shock protein genes to be identified [19]. A similar
approach was used to try to identify divergent motifs in
the ef-1α promoter region of P. vivax that could explain
the low luciferase reporter activity in P falciparum. The
sequence of ef-1α of six species of Plasmodium was
searched for conserved motifs using the Gibbs algorithm.
This enabled the identification of a motif, identical in the
ef-1α intergenic regions of five of these species but degenerate in P. vivax. To determine whether this motif, termed
EF motif, is active in gene expression, two complementary
approaches were taken. First, the conserved sequence of
the EF motif was cloned into the P. vivax ef-1α promoter
region. Unexpectedly, the insertion of one copy decreased
luciferase reporter activity to 65% whereas cloning of a
second motif restored promoter strength. Second, either
EF motif in the P. berghei ef-1α promoter of our reference
plasmid was mutated as to create an EF motif identical to
that of P. vivax. Significantly reduced reporter expression
was achieved with either motif mutated suggesting that
both copies are functional. Regardless, these two

The evolutionary reasons that could explain why cis regulatory elements in P. vivax promoter regions are poorly or
not recognized by P. falciparum are presently unknown.
The absence of a species barrier for promoters of some
species of Plasmodium has been demonstrated. Indeed,
dhfr promoters of P chabaudi are functional in P. falciparum [20]. Moreover, P. falciparum and P. berghei promoters are recognized in P. knowlesi [21]. Furthermore, a
recent study established transient transfection in P. vivax
using a P. falciparum promoter [35]. Thus, promoters from
phylogentically distant species are functional in heterologous assays although a direct comparison of promoter
strengths in these different systems is lacking. Transfection
methodologies for these four Plasmodium species have
been developed and constructs harbouring promoters
characterized for a least three of them are available. It is,
therefore, feasible now to pursue functional comparative
studies which may identify promoter elements conserved
and distinct among parasites of the genus, elucidating
many aspects of gene regulation in Plasmodium.
