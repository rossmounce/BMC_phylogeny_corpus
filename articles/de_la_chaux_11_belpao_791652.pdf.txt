BEL/Pao retrotransposons in metazoan genomes
Nicole de la Chaux1,2* and Andreas Wagner1,2,3

Abstract
Background: Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are a widespread kind of transposable element present
in eukaryotic genomes. They are a major factor in genome evolution due to their ability to create large scale
mutations and genome rearrangements. Compared to other transposable elements, little attention has been paid
to elements belonging to the metazoan BEL/Pao subclass of LTR retrotransposons. No comprehensive
characterization of these elements is available so far. The aim of this study was to describe all BEL/Pao elements in
a set of 62 sequenced metazoan genomes, and to analyze their phylogenetic relationship.
Results: We identified a total of 7,861 BEL/Pao elements in 53 of our 62 study genomes. We identified BEL/Pao
elements in 20 genomes where such elements had not been found so far. Our analysis shows that BEL/Pao
elements are the second-most abundant class of LTR retrotransposons in the genomes we study, more abundant
than Ty1/Copia elements, and second only to Ty3/Gypsy elements. They occur in multiple phyla, including basal
metazoan phyla, suggesting that BEL/Pao elements arose early in animal evolution. We confirm findings from
previous studies that BEL/Pao elements do not occur in mammals. The elements we found can be grouped into
more than 1725 families, 1623 of which are new, previously unknown families. These families fall into seven
superfamilies, only five of which have been characterized so far. One new superfamily is a major subdivision of the
Pao superfamily which we propose to call Dan, because it is restricted to the genome of the zebrafish Danio rerio.
The other new superfamily comprises 83 elements and is restricted to lower aquatic eumetazoans. We propose to
call this superfamily Flow. BEL/Pao elements do not show any signs of recent horizontal gene transfer between
distantly related species.
Conclusions: In sum, our analysis identifies thousands of new BEL/Pao elements and provides new insights into
their distribution, abundance, and evolution.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that
have the ability to replicate within a genome using a
variety of mechanisms [1]. They are present in almost
all eukaryotic genomes, and they play an important role
in genome evolution by creating genetic variation
through their mobility [2]. Although most new TE insertions have a negative effect on the host’s fitness, they
significantly contribute to genome evolution [3]. TEs
can be divided into two classes based on their replication mechanism: retrotransposons (class I) and DNA
transposons (class II) [1]. While retrotransposons use an
RNA intermediate for transposition, DNA transposons
use a DNA intermediate. Because of their replication

mechanism retrotransposons are generally present in
larger numbers than DNA transposons, and can reach
very high copy numbers. They also show a broader phylogenetic distribution [4]. Retrotransposons can be
further subdivided into two major classes based on
whether they have long terminal repeat (LTR)
sequences, i.e., LTR retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons [4]. We here do not discuss non-LTR retrotransposons further.
LTR retrotransposons are similar to retroviruses [5]
and consist of a protein-coding region which is flanked
by two LTR sequences. The LTR sequences regulate
transcription and play important roles in the copying of
the element’s RNA into DNA. The protein coding
region usually contains one or two open reading frames
(ORFs) which are similar to gag and pol genes from retroviruses. While the gag gene encodes proteins that
form virus-like particles, the pol gene encodes various

enzymatic activities like aspartic protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. A small fraction of LTR elements additionally contains an env gene captured from
retroviruses [6], where this gene is important for the
infectivity of the virus. In the few LTR elements where
this gene occurs, it is usually non-functional [7-9].
LTR retrotransposons can be further divided into four
subclasses based on their sequence similarity and various structural features: Ty1/Copia, Ty3/Gypsy, BEL/Pao
(also sometimes named only BEL or Pao) and DIRS
[10]. Most of the known LTR elements belong to the
two large Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy subclasses. Elements from these subclasses are present in almost all
eukaryotic genomes and are already intensely studied. In
contrast, the other two subclasses contain fewer elements and were identified only recently [11,12]. While
elements from the Ty1/Copia, Ty3/Gypsy and DIRS
subclasses are widespread in eukaryotic genomes, BEL/
Pao elements are only present in metazoan genomes,
suggesting that they arose later in eukaryote evolution
or that they have been lost (or not yet identified) in several major eukaryotic lineages. Even in animal genomes
they do not show a continuous distribution. For example, no elements have been identified in mammals so
far.
The evolutionary history of the BEL/Pao subclass is
not well understood. More and more BEL/Pao elements
are being reported in different genomes, which raises
the question if the BEL/Pao subclass is really as small as
previously assumed [13-17]. Around 160 different BEL/
Pao families in approximately 40 species have been
reported and the number is still growing
[6,11,14,16,18-21]. BEL/Pao elements are usually
between 4.2-10 kb long. They are flanked by LTR
sequences that are 0.2-1.2 kb long [22]. BEL/Pao elements show the same domain arrangement as elements
of the Ty3/Gypsy subclass and few BEL/Pao elements
contain an env gene [22].
Contradictory evolutionary relationships for elements
within the BEL/Pao subclass and for the relationship of
the BEL/Pao subclass to the other three subclasses have
been reported [6,16,23]. Current research focuses mainly
on the identification of new BEL/Pao elements in one
genome of interest. For studying the evolutionary history
of these elements, just a few elements from other organisms are typically added as outgroups [16,24]. The most
comprehensive phylogenetic analysis thus far was carried out by Copeland et al. (2005), who analyzed the
phylogenetic relationship of 20 different BEL/Pao elements. Although these authors identified five distinct
BEL/Pao lineages in insects, nematodes and vertebrates,
namely Tas, BEL, Pao, Sinbad, and Suzu [16], no
exhaustive analysis of the BEL/Pao subclass of LTR elements is available. Here, we search for BEL/Pao

elements in 62 non-mammalian metazoan and in 11
mammalian genomes. We use a de novo search
approach to identify all BEL/Pao elements in this set of
genomes. After separating the elements into families, we
study the phylogenetic relationship between these
families, and extend the current classification of BEL/
Pao elements. An origin in very early metazoan evolution is often assumed for BEL/Pao elements, but no
conclusive evidence exists. Alternatively, BEL/Pao elements might have evolved later, only in a subset of
metazoan genomes, and were then transmitted to other
metazoan phyla by horizontal transfer. This might
explain why, for example, no BEL/Pao elements are present in mammalian genomes. Our sequence data allows
us to address this possibility in a preliminary fashion.

Results
Element occurences

Figure 1 shows the species in whose genomes we
searched for BEL/Pao elements. Species in which our
approach did identify BEL/Pao elements are highlighted
in green. Species without BEL/Pao elements are shown
in red. The taxonomic range of the species we analyzed
is broad. It includes both eumetazoa and parazoa, bilateria and radiata, protostomes and deuterostomes, and
comprises species from 11 different phyla. Of the 62
genomes we analyzed 27 (44 percent) are from arthropods, reflecting a bias in currently available genome
sequences.
The majority of species whose genomes we analyzed
belong to one of the three eumetazoan phyla Nematoda,
Arthropoda and Chordata. In all of these three phyla
BEL/Pao elements had been identified previously. In
contrast to previous work, we also had access to species
from new superphyla and from the subkingdom parazoa.
This allowed us to identify elements in these new
metazoan clades as well. For example, no BEL/Pao element has been identified thus far in the subkingdom
parazoa. We identified 24 BEL/Pao elements in the
sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, a member of this
subkingdom. In addition, we identified new BEL/Pao
elements in the cnidarian, echinoderm, and hemichordate phyla.
In total, we identified 7,861 BEL/Pao elements in 53 of
our 62 genomes, including 20 species where no BEL/Pao
elements have been identified before. These elements
include full length elements and fragments with a minimum length of 2,000 base pairs. Previous studies
reported around 160 BEL/Pao families, but in most genomes the copy number of these families has not been
reported [6,11,14,16,18,25]. Our analysis thus is the first
to determine the abundance of BEL/Pao elements in
multiple genomes. The nucleotide sequences of all BEL/
Pao elements are listed in additional file 1.

Variable abundance of elements

The abundance of BEL/Pao elements is highly variable
between different species. Nine of our 62 studied genomes do not contain any BEL/Pao elements, and 14
further species contain no more than ten elements. The
relative majority of species (22 in total) contain between
eleven and 100 elements, and 16 species contain
between 101 and 1000 elements. Only one species, the
yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, harbors more than
1000 elements (a total of 2524 elements). The number
of BEL/Pao elements in each species’ genome is listed in
additional file 2 and in Figure 1. Previous results
reported that no BEL/Pao elements are present in mammalian genomes [16]. We could confirm this finding
using eleven mammalian genomes which we analyzed in
addition to the 62 genomes we just discussed (see Methods for list of genome names).

Because genome size can influence the abundance of
elements in a species [26], we compared the number of
BEL/Pao elements per mega base pair (Mbp) between
species. Additional file 3A shows a histogram of this
LTR element density for the species we studied. The
number of BEL/Pao copies ranges from less than 0.01
copies per Mbp in 17 species to 3.55 copies per Mbp in
the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae. Most genomes contain fewer than one BEL/Pao element per Mbp. Only
the mosquito and fruit fly genomes contain more. Five
species have between one to two copies per Mbp. These
are (in ascending order of element density) the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (mean copy number per Mbp
1.14), the fruit flies Drosophila virilis (1.34), Drosophila
melanogaster (1.37), the mosquito Aedes aegypti (1.85),
and the fruit fly Drosophila yakuba (1.96). Two fruit fly
species have between two and three copies per Mbps

genomes we analyzed are grouped by phylum. 11 additional mammalian genomes we analyzed are summarized as “11 Mammals”. Next to
each species, the number of BEL/Pao elements we identified is shown. If we were not able to identify any element in one genome, the genome

(D. willistoni (2.14) and D. persimilis (2.9)). The species
with the highest overall copy number (A. aegypti) is not
the species with the highest density of BEL/Pao elements. This observation can be explained by the fact
that A. aegypti has, with 1.3 Gb, a more than 6 times
larger genome than the mosquito and fruit fly genomes
[26]. Additional file 3B shows that the total copy number per species and the number of copies per Mbps
show a statistically significant association for the genomes we analyzed (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient 0.78, p = 5 × 10 -12, n = 53).
BEL/Pao elements are the second most abundant subclass
of LTR retrotransposons

To evaluate how important BEL/Pao elements are as a
genome constituent, we compared their abundance to
that of the other three LTR element subclasses. Figure 2
shows for each genome containing BEL/Pao elements
the fraction of LTR elements that our de novo search
identified, and that we were able to classify into one of
the four LTR classes. BEL/Pao, Ty1/Copia, Ty3/Gypsy
and DIRS elements are represented by different shades
of grey in the figure. Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy are
commonly considered the most abundant LTR elements,
but our analysis invalidates that pattern. Although Ty3/
Gypsy elements still are the most abundant class of LTR
elements, they are followed by BEL/Pao elements, with
Ty1/Copia a distant third. Specifically, while Ty3/Gypsy
elements constitute an average of 68.9 percent of classifiable elements in a genome, BEL/Pao comprise 21.6
percent, and Ty1/Copia elements contribute an average
of 6.7 percent. DIRS elements are a distant fourth with
2.8 percent, and they occur only in 19 genomes. In
terms of absolute numbers, we identified 25,024 Ty3/
Gypsy elements, 7861 BEL/Pao elements, 2445 Ty1/
Copia elements and 1009 DIRS elements. The roundworm Brugia malayi is the only organism in which we
only identified BEL/Pao elements (29 elements) and no
elements belonging to the other three classes. Because
our identification procedure of transposable elements
purposedly excludes small element fragments, we cannot
exclude that this organism may have contained elements
from other families in the past. We also note that B.
malayi is not the sole species containing only elements
from one LTR subclass. For example, there are also 11
species which do not contain any BEL/Pao elements
(Figure 2).
Many different families

We next wished to group our identified BEL elements
into families based on their sequence similarity on the
nucleotide level. To this end, we pursued a graph-based
approach. The nodes in the graph we studied are BEL/
Pao elements. Edges represent sequence similarity

Page 4 of 16

between elements. The approach we pursued clusters
the elements in the graph into families, using a fast and
scalable unsupervised Markov cluster algorithm (MCL)
for graphs, which is based on the simulation of stochastic flow on graphs [27,28] (see Methods for details).
To validate the accuracy of our clustering approach,
we first clustered only the BEL/Pao elements from the
especially well-studied genome of D. melanogaster. We
then compared our classification of the 178 D. melanogaster elements with (i) the annotation of elements in
the genome sequence of D. melanogaster, and (ii) the D.
melanogaster elements in Repbase Update [25]. Our
approach resulted in the family classification shown in
Figure 3, where the 178 BEL/Pao elements we identified
form ten families labeled from a) to j). In this figure,
each node represents an element and different node colors indicate different families. In the figure, we labeled
elements in each family with the established names
from the genome sequence (left name in each panel),
and with the name of the most similar Repbase Update
element (right name). Our classification is identical to
the previous classification of these elements, with the
exception of one family. This family (d)) contains two
elements belonging to the previously described ninjaDsim-like family, and one belonging to the aurora
family. The other three elements in this family were not
previously annotated. Additionally, we find three more
ninja-Dsim-like elements that belong to the family in
panel h) in our classification. In sum, the method we
use classifies only one out of 178 (0.6 Percent) D. melanogaster BEL/Pao elements in a different family than
previous annotations and divides one family. This low
incidence of misclassification motivated us to apply the
method to larger sets of elements.
We next applied our method to all 7,861 BEL/Pao elements we had identified. This resulted in 817 families
with at least two elements and 908 singletons. We
assigned a unique identifier to each family, which we
report in additional file 4. Most (696) families have ten
or fewer member elements. Only three families have
more than 100 copies. One of these families is present
in the fruit flies of the melanogaster subgroup (143
copies). This family corresponds to the roo family which
has been described earlier to have a high copy number
in D. melanogaster [29]. The family with the second
highest copy number (207 copies) is present in the fruit
fly D. ananassae, and that with the highest copy number
(397 copies) in the carolina anole Anolis carolinensis, an
arboreal lizard. These two families, however, do not
share any similarity to families of known elements.
Table 1 shows the ten families with the highest copy
number.
Only 42 of the families (2.4 percent) we identified are
not restricted to one genome, but contain elements

Figure 3 Markov clustering of D. melanogaster BEL/Pao elements. We clustered all 178 BEL/Pao elements from D. melanogaster into ten
families based on their sequence similarity using the MCL algorithm [27] from within BioLayout [46]. We refer to these families as MCL families.
A node in the graph represents one element. Edges represent nucleotide sequence similarity between two elements (see Methods for details).
Elements clustered into the same family are shown in the same color. The absence of an edge between two elements, indicates that the
elements do not share sufficiently high sequence similarity over at least 500 bp (see Methods). We compared the elements of the MCL families
to previous annotation of these elements in the D. melanogaster genome and in Repbase Update. Each MCL family is labeled with two names
separated by a slash. The left name is from the Drosophila genome annotation, the right name is from Repbase Update. Dashes ‘-’ indicate that
a family has not been previously annotated. Note that one family has two names: 3S18 in the genome annotation and BEL in Repbase Update.
Elements from family d) were previously annotated as belonging to two different families.

from different genomes. Most (35) of these families
occur in the Drosophila melanogaster and obscura
groups. Four families have elements in two mosquito
genomes and three families are distributed in the three
Nasonia wasps. All these families are therefore restricted
to closely related species. In addition to the family classification we just described, which clusters elements
regardless of which genome they occur in, we carried
out an analogous classification, but separately for elements within each genome. The two classifications do

Phylogenetic relationship among BEL/Pao families

We next wanted to use our large data set to validate the
existing classification of BEL/Pao elements into the previously identified superfamilies BEL, Tas, Suzu, Sinbad
and Pao. To this end, we used the protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase domains of each element. We
constructed a consensus sequence for each domain in
each of our element families or used the domain
sequences themselves for elements that were singletons
(see methods for details). We then used these (consensus)
sequences to construct a multiple alignment of each of
the domains using Mafft [30] (three alignments in total).
Subsequently, we concatenated these alignments and constructed a phylogenetic tree from them using PhyML_aLRT [31], a version of PhyML [32] that incorporates
an approximate likelihood ratio test to estimate the statistical support of the tree topology. In this tree reconstruction, we included as outgroups the domains of the
canonical sequence from the Gypsy and Copia elements
from D. melanogaster, as given by Repbase Update [25].
The consensus sequences for each of the families and
domains we identified are listed in additional file 6.

support for a clade ranging from 0 (least significant) to 1
(highly significant). Figure 4C shows the same tree for
the purpose of comparing it to previously proposed phylogenetic trees of BEL/Pao elements. For clarity, this
panel does not show the divergence within each major
clade, and the order of the branches is reorganized to
ease the comparison to these previous phylogenetic trees
(shown in Figure 4D and 4E) [16,23]. To avoid confusion,
we note that if we refer to BEL/Pao elements below, we
mean the entire subclass of LTR elements we studied. If
we refer to only BEL or Pao elements, we mean the BEL
and Pao superfamilies, respectively.

Additionally, we provide the relevant alignments in additional file 7. We defined superfamilies in this tree as
major, deep-branching clades, which are easily identifiable
based on the tree structure, and further discussed below.
The complete phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure 4A,
and in additional file 8 with partly collapsed clades, and
representative species names assigned to branches. Figure
4B shows an additional version of the tree with collapsed
major clades. In Figure 4B the triangles represent the
divergence between the elements within each major
clade, with long triangles indicating great divergence.

Figure 4 Phylogenetic tree of BEL/Pao families. The phylogenetic tree is based on the concatenated amino acid sequence of the three
protein domains protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. The tree is based on 893 transposable element families for which we could
construct a consensus sequence for all three domains. In addition to data from these families, we used in this analysis all BEL/Pao elements from
Repbase Update [25] where we could identify all three domains (total of 92 elements). Some of these Repbase Update elements are from
species whose genomes we did not analyze here. Furthermore, we included 16 elements from the Gypsy element Database GyDB [23], in order
to associate clades in the tree to previously described subclades of the BEL/Pao element class. A list of these elements is found in additional file
2. Different colors indicate major clades. A) Same phylogenetic tree as in A) but with major clades collapsed into triangles indicating superfamily
divergence and statistical support values for the branches. We constructed the tree using PhyML with an approximate likelihood ratio test to
estimate the statistical support of the tree topology [31]. This statistical support is indicated by the numbers at the branches which range from 0
(least significant) to 1 (highly significant). All branches leading to the major clades have very high support. C) Same phylogenetic tree as in A)
but without divergence triangles, and branches are reorganized to facilitate comparison with trees in D) and E). D) and E) Phylogenetic
relationship of BEL/Pao clades as described by Copeland et al. [16] and Llorens et al [23], respectively. High resolution tree and graphic files are
available from the authors upon request.

Previous studies identified five different superfamilies of
BEL/Pao elements which are named after the first identified element in the subclade: BEL [33], Tas [18], Suzu
[14], Sinbad [16] and Pao [11]. Two previous phylogenetic studies both found that BEL and Tas elements
formed one clade and Sinbad and Pao another one. In
both studies, Suzu elements alone formed a third clade
[16,23]. However, the trees that emerged from these two
studies differ in one major way. Copeland et al. identified
elements belonging to the Suzu superfamily as more distantly related to the other four clades than these clades
are to each other (Figure 4D) [16]. In contrast, the study
by Llorens et al. grouped the Suzu superfamily with the
Pao/Sinbad clade (see Figure 4E) [23].
Two new superfamilies of BEL/Pao elements

Our phylogenetic analysis shows some similarities to the
previous studies. For example, we find that Pao and Sinbad form part of the same clade as do BEL and Tas.
Similar to what Copeland et al. (2005) [16] reported, the
elements from the Suzu family are more distantly
related to the other clades than these clades to each
other. However, there are two major differences. First,
we found that the Pao superfamily groups into two
separate clades (green clades in Figure 4A and 4B). We
kept the name Pao for the larger of these clades,
because it contains the original Pao element identified
in Bombyx mori [11]. We propose the new name Dan
for the second, smaller clade, because we have identified
it in the zebrafish Danio rerio, and it currently only contains elements from this organism. Second, we identified
a new superfamily (discussed below), for which we propose the name Flow. Table 2 shows the number of
families and elements per superfamily and additional file
9 the minimal, maximal, and median element and LTR
sequence lengths for each superfamily. We note that we
could have classified our data into many more superfamilies, but our aim was not to proliferate the number of
superfamilies unnecessarily, while preserving previous
classifications as much as possible. Fortunately, the clear
partitioning of our family tree into few major clades
made this task easy and unambiguous. We also note

that our phylogenetic analysis is based on more than 40
times more sequence data than previous analyses.
Table 3 shows the average amino acid similarity in
percent between the consensus sequences within a
superfamily and among different superfamilies. Not
unexpectedly, the average similarity of elements within
one superfamily (diagonal in Table 3) is generally higher
than the average similarity of elements in different
superfamilies (off-diagonal in Table 3). The only exception are elements belonging to the Tas superfamily.
They are on average slightly less similar to each other
than elements in some different families, e.g., elements
in the Dan and Sinbad superfamily. The average similarity within one superfamily varies between 37.4 percent
for the sequences belonging to the Tas superfamily, to
63.53 percent between sequences belonging to the Dan
superfamily. The average similarity between different
superfamilies ranges from 26.51 percent between elements from the Tas superfamily and the Suzu superfamily, to 39.07 percent between elements from the Dan
and Sinbad superfamilies.
Distribution of superfamilies

The number of species and phyla covered by each
superfamily is shown in Table 2 and a list of phyla covered by each superfamily can be seen in additional file
10. Some superfamilies are restricted to one phylum.
The Dan and Pao superfamilies have the most restricted
host range and occur only in the fish Danio rerio and in
arthropods, respectively. Pao elements occur mainly in
the different Drosophila and mosquito genomes, with
the exception of a few elements that are present in the
parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis.
Other superfamilies are present in different phyla and
in a wider range of host organisms. An example is the
Tas superfamily, which is present in Cnidaria, Nematoda, Arthropoda, Hemichordata, and Porifera. It also
occurs in different host organisms within all phyla, e.g.,
in almost all our nematode genomes (11 genomes).
Some superfamilies are present in a wide range of phyla
but all species are restricted to a certain habitat type,
such as aquatic habitats for the Suzu superfamily.

We note that our study is the first to identify elements
of the BEL/Pao subclass in the subkingdom parazoa.
These elements fall into the BEL and Tas superfamilies.
Elements of the Flow superfamily

The five families belonging to the new superfamily we
discovered are all present in lower animals that live in
aquatic habitats, hence the name Flow. One of Flow’s
families occurs in the starlet sea anemone Nematostella
vectensis (7 copies), and two families occur in the fresh
water hydra Hydra magnipapillata (55 copies). Both
species belong to the phylum Cnidaria. We found the
other two families in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea (21 copies), phylum Platyhelminthes. The elements
are between 3303 to 16272 base pairs long with an average of 7452 base pairs.
The five families of the Flow superfamily are not
highly similar to one another. Specifically, the amino
acid similarity ranges from 33.89 percent between the
consensus sequence of N. vectensis and one of the consensus sequences from S. mediterranea, to 53.95 percent
between the two consensus sequences from S. mediterranea. The average similarity is with 45.48 the second
lowest similarity within a superfamily. The average similarity to the other BEL/Pao superfamilies varies from
29.96 percent (Suzu superfamily) to 37.42 percent (Pao
superfamily).
Highly similar elements in closely related species

We used blastn[34] to compare each BEL/Pao element against all other 7,860 elements to search for possible signs of horizontal transfer of BEL/Pao elements
between our studied species. If an element is only transferred vertically from parent to offspring, we expect to
find no high similarity between elements from distantly
related species. In contrast, highly similar elements
occurring in very distantly related species might indicate
horizontal transfer of an element between these species.
In this analysis, we required an identity of at least 80
percent over at least 20 percent of the length of an element, but at least over 300 bp. This criterion is a liberal
threshold for recent transfer events and allows for some
divergence of sequence since the transfer. Using this criterion, we found no signs of similar sequences in very
different species. The only similar sequences in different
species occurred in closely related species within the
same genus, i.e., in fruit flies of the genus Drosophila, in
parasitoid wasps of the genus Nasonia, and in roundworms of the genus Meloidogyne.
Previous work had identified a horizontal transfer of a
BEL element between the fly Drosophila ananassae and
the endosymbiont Wolbachia [35]. Motivated by this
observation, we attempted to identify further possible
horizontal transfers to endosymbiont genomes and

Page 9 of 16

viruses through a blast search [34] of our consensus
sequences for the concatenated protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase domains for each of the seven
superfamilies against the non-redundant protein and
nucleotide databases of GenBank. The BEL element in
the endosymbiont Wolbachia was the only one we
found, suggesting that such horizontal transfer is not
widespread for BEL/Pao elements.

Discussion
Many BEL/Pao elements in metazoan genomes

We identified 7,861 BEL/Pao elements in 53 out of our
set of 62 non-mammalian metazoan genomes. This is the
first time genome-wide abundances of BEL/Pao elements
are reported. Previous studies identified around 160
families of BEL/Pao elements but in most cases the copy
number of a family was not reported. The genomes we
studied span a wider range of species than previously
analyzed for BEL/Pao elements, and so does the distribution of BEL/Pao elements we identified. For example, we
were able to identify 24 BEL/Pao elements in the sponge
Amphimedon queenslandica, a species belonging to the
metazoan subkingdom parazoa. All previous BEL/Pao
elements had only been identified in the subkingdom
eumetazoa. Previous studies reported the lack of BEL/
Pao elements in mammalian genomes [16]. We screened
eleven mammalian genomes for BEL/Pao elements but
did not identify any elements. This observation supports
the view that BEL/Pao elements are not present in mammalian genomes. This might be explained by stochastic
loss of BEL/Pao elements in early mammalian evolution.
Alternatively, the BEL/Pao subclass might only have originated after the origin of the mammalian clade. However, the presence of BEL/Pao elements in species
belonging to both metazoan subkingdoms makes this
unlikely. Most previous studies identified BEL/Pao elements in the three phyla Nematoda, Arthropoda and
Chordata. Most of our elements also come from these
three phyla because 53 of our 62 sequenced genomes
belong to these phyla. We identified BEL/Pao elements in
46 of these genomes (86 percent), including 18 genomes
where, to our knowledge, no BEL/Pao elements had been
identified so far. This shows that BEL/Pao elements are
more abundant than previously thought. We found BEL/
Pao elements in seven of the remaining nine genomes,
which do not belong to either of the three phyla Nematoda, Arthropoda and Chordata. In two of these seven
species no BEL/Pao elements had been identified so far.
The wide distribution of BEL/Pao in different metazoan
phyla and the occurrence in both metazoan subkingdoms
makes it likely that BEL/Pao elements evolved during
early metazoan evolution.
The number of BEL/Pao elements we identified in different species varies from zero to more than 2,500

de la Chaux and Wagner BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:154
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/154

copies in A. aegypti. The high number in A. aegypti is
not surprising because the genome of this species is
with 1.3 Gb our largest studied non-mammalian genome, and it has been previously reported that more than
50 percent of the A. aegypti genome consists of transposable elements [26]. More generally, transposable elements in A. aegypti are a major factor for its genome
size increase compared to related mosquito and fruit fly
species [26]. The reason why we find such a big difference in the abundance of BEL/Pao elements in some
species remains unknown (as it is for many other transposable elements).
Several factors may influence variation in TE numbers.
They include stochastic loss of transposable elements
[1], transposition bursts in response to environmental
stressors [36], and differences in effective population
sizes that render selection against the deleterious effects
of transposable elements more or less effective [10].
Additionally, we note that our transposable element
identification approach might only give a lower bound
for the number of BEL/Pao elements in a genome. The
reason is that genome sequences differ in their quality.
Many genomes are represented by many small sequence
contigs instead of one sequence per chromosome. This
might prevent the identification of some elements at the
end of a sequence contig. However, we note that this
cannot be the only cause for the differences we find. For
example, the genome sequences of A. aegypti and D.
melanogaster are available as contigs with a median
length of 683 kb and 10,805 kb, respectively. Even
though the genome of D. melanogaster has longer contigs than A. aegypti, it contains fewer BEL/Pao elements
(178 versus 2524 elements, respectively).
Overall, BEL/Pao elements are the second most abundant class of LTR retrotransposons in the genomes we
studied, a pattern that also holds for most of our study
genomes individually. Only elements belonging to the
Ty3/Gypsy class are, on average, more abundant. By
comparison, Ty1/Copia and DIRS elements account for
only a small fraction of LTR retrotransposons (6.7 and
2.8 percent, respectively). Only some genomes, such as
that of Brugia malayi and the two Nasonia species,
show a different distribution of LTR element classes. B.
malayi, a causative agent of the tropical disease lymphatic filariasis, contains only BEL/Pao elements and no elements from the other classes. The Nasonia species on
the other hand, harbor all four classes and BEL/Pao elements are only the third most abundant class (11.7 percent over all three species). Our observations are
broadly consistent with previous studies. For example,
one study in A. gambiae [24] and one in B. mori [17]
report the Ty3/Gypsy class to be the most abundant
LTR class in these two organisms, followed by BEL/Pao
and Ty1/Copia. Another study focused on LTR elements

Page 10 of 16

in C. elegans [37], and it found the BEL/Pao class to be
the most abundant, followed by the Ty3/Gypsy class. It
did not identify any Ty1/Copia elements [37]. Our
results agree with this finding.
While previous studies concentrated on elements from
one species, we analyzed elements from multiple species.
However, our data set still only represents a small fraction of all metazoan species. The NCBI’s genome
sequencing project site lists 88 non-mammalian
metazoan genomes as “in progress” http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genomes/leuks.cgi. Some of these species
cover phyla which have not been studied so far with
respect to BEL/Pao elements. Therefore, the results of
our study will likely be extended with every new genome
release.
A ten-fold increase in family number

We clustered our BEL/Pao elements into 1,725 families
(817 multi-element families and 908 singletons) which is
more than a ten-fold increase in family number compared to the approximately 160 BEL/Pao families known
so far. Part of this increase can be explained by the 251
families identified in the 20 previously not analyzed genomes. However, the bulk of this increase in family number comes from newly identified families in previously
studied species. For example, we identified two previously unknown families with a copy number of more
than 200 elements.
One potential explanation for the high family number
might be that our clustering approach divided the elements from one species into too many small families.
However, our analysis of the well-studied and wellannotated fruit fly D. melanogaster genome argues
against this possibility. This analysis finds that the ten
families we identify are largely congruent with previous
annotation. The only exception are elements belonging
to the ninja-Dsim-like family (nine elements). Our clustering approach divided this family into two families.
Additionally in one of the two ninja-Dsim-like families,
we find an element from the aurora family. However,
this change in annotation affects only one in 178 elements (0.6 percent). The aurora element is the only element of that family in D. melanogaster, raising the
possibility that one of the ninja-Dsim-like elements was
falsely annotated as an aurora element. Indeed, the
alignment of all annotated ninja-Dsim-like elements in
D. melanogaster shows a high average sequence divergence (in both ninja-Dsim-like families the elements
have an average similarity of 64 percent) and the aurora
element is very similar to large parts of some of the
ninja-Dsim-like elements.
Overall, the comparison of our families to the previously annotated TEs in D. melanogaster shows that
our clustering does not separate the elements into too

de la Chaux and Wagner BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:154
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/154

many small families. Our approach correctly classified
177 out of 178 elements. We therefore believe that the
high number of BEL/Pao families we identified is a
faithful reflection of actual BEL/Pao element diversity.
Major subclades separated early

Previous studies, which were based on fewer than 25
BEL/Pao elements, identified five superfamilies of BEL/
Pao elements: Pao, Sinbad, BEL, Tas and Suzu [16,23],
named after the first element identified in each superfamily. Our phylogenetic tree is based on 893 BEL/Pao
families and it also identified these five known superfamilies. Additionally we found one completely new
superfamily (Flow), and a deep separation of the Pao
superfamily into the two highly divergent superfamilies
Pao and Dan.
We separated the Dan superfamily from the Sinbad
superfamily for two reasons. First, one element from the
Dan clade was previously annotated to belong to the
Pao superfamily. In contrast, we find that the Dan clade
is more closely related to the Sinbad superfamily. The
best way to resolve this conflict, in our view, is to propose Dan as a second superfamily. Second, because the
Sinbad superfamily also contains elements from Danio
rerio, the Dan clade is not simply a subbranch of the
Sinbad superfamily that contains all elements from
Danio rerio. In sum, we think that the Dan clade should
be viewed as a separate superfamily. It is very likely that
new elements of this superfamily will be identied in genomes that we did not study.
The superfamily tree topology we find differs somewhat from previously reported topologies [16,23]. We
find a very high statistical support for our tree topology
(see Figure 4B). This high support makes it unlikely that
our tree topology is not correct, especially as it is also
supported by many more sequences than any of the previous studies. Additionally the average sequence similarity of elements within one superfamily almost always
shows greater amino acid sequence similarity than elements in different superfamilies, which supports our
classification into superfamilies.
Most (656 of 893) of our families belong to the Pao or
BEL superfamily. This is not surprising because these
superfamilies are mainly restricted to arthropod genomes and 27 of our genome sequences (44 percent)
belong to this phylum. The other five superfamilies
show a more diverse distribution of host genomes. Here,
the host genomes come from more than one phylum
and, for the Tas and BEL superfamily, even from both
metazoan subkingdoms.
The variation in the host species range that we
observe has several candidate explanations that our data
cannot resolve. On the one hand, BEL/Pao superfamilies

Page 11 of 16

might have been lost in some phyla. On the other hand,
horizontal transfer of BEL/Pao elements between species
belonging to different phyla might be at work. For
example, if BEL/Pao elements originated in the eumetazoa, a horizontal transfer event to Amphimedon queenslandica might explain the presence of BEL/Pao
elements in the parazoa. We did not find any evidence
of recent horizontal transfer between distantly related
species, because no such species contain highly similar
BEL/Pao elements. This, however, does not exclude the
possibility of ancient horizontal transfer events. To identify such transfer events is beyond the scope of our
study. But regardless of whether element loss or horizontal transfer explains the current BEL/Pao element
distribution, BEL/Pao elements probably originated early
in metazoan evolution. This is because BEL/Pao elements occur in both metazoan subkingdoms, and in a
wide range of host species from different phyla.
Flow, a new superfamily of BEL/Pao elements

We found a new BEL/Pao superfamily (Flow) which consists of five families and a total of 83 elements present in
lower animals. We identified three of these families in two
species belonging to the phylum Cnidaria (Hydra magnipapillata, Nematostella vectensis), and the other two
families in a species belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes (Schmidtea mediterranea). In both phyla, Cnidaria and Platyhelminthes, only eleven and two BEL/Pao
elements, respectively, had been identified before
[16,23,38]. The five Flow families are quite diverse (average
similarity 45.48 percent). This is not surprising, because
they occur in very distantly related species. The new
superfamily supports and strengthens the view that BEL/
Pao elements arose in early metazoan evolution, because
none of its families are present in one of the three well
studied phyla Nematoda, Arthropoda, and Chordata.

Conclusions
We identified 7,861 BEL/Pao elements in 53 metazoan
genomes, making the BEL/Pao elements the second
most abundant class of LTR retrotransposons in
metazoan genomes. The elements we identified can be
divided into 1,725 families based on the similarity of
their nucleotide sequence. Our analysis increases the
number of known BEL/Pao families by more than tenfold. These families can be separated into seven superfamilies based on their phylogenetic relationship. Five of
these superfamilies have been known previously, one
new superfamily emerges from a highly divergent existing superfamily, and one superfamily is completely new.
BEL/Pao elements are present in both metazoan subkingdoms, which suggests that they arose during early
metazoan evolution.

Methods
Element identification

We downloaded a total of 73 non-mammalian metazoan
genomes from the NCBI’s eukaryotic genome sequencing project site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/
leuks.cgi with a sequencing status of “Assembly” or
“Complete” as of August 25, 2010. If more than one
genome sequence was available for one species, we used
the sequence that covered most of the genome. Functional LTR elements are at least 5 kb long. To reduce
the search time and avoid falsely identifying elements,
we excluded contigs from the genome sequences with a
length of less than 10 kb from our analysis. The available genome sequence for eleven genomes comprised
fewer than 1.5 Mbps. We also excluded these genomes
from our analysis because they are too short for a genome-scale analysis. A complete list of all genomes we
analyzed is present in additional file 2.
Although previous studies did not identify any BEL/
Pao elements in mammalian genomes, we downloaded
eleven mammalian genome sequences from the NCBI’s
eukaryotic genome sequencing project site to validate
this observation: Bos taurus, Canis lupus familiaris,
Equus caballus, Monodelphis domestica, Mus musculus,
Ornithorhynchus anatinus, Rattus norvegicus, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, Cavia porcellus, Lama pacos, Pteropus vampyrus.
We used a combination of two de novo identification
algorithms to identify all LTR elements in our set of
genomes. Specifically, we applied the two de novo LTR
identification algorithms LTRharvest [39] and find_ltr
[40] to identify all possible LTR elements in our genomes. Subsequently, we separated our de novo identified
elements into the four LTR classes Ty1/Copia, Ty3/
Gypsy, BEL/Pao and DIRS, merged the two sets of BEL/
Pao elements from each algorithm into one set, and
assigned an identifier to each element. We now explain
important details of this procedure.
LTRharvest and find_ltr both search for structural features, such as LTR sequences, to identify full length
LTR elements in a genome sequence. Among all de
novo LTR identification programs LTRharvest and
find_ltr give the best results with regard to the number
of true LTR elements detected [41]. However, the number of false positives can also be high for both programs.
Therefore we accepted only candidate elements for
further analysis that contained at least one functional
domain known to be present in LTR retrotransposons
and at least one open reading frame longer than 300 bp.
To identify these domains we used hidden Markov
models [42] obtained from Pfam [43] (Asp_protease,
Peptidase_A17, RVT_1, RVT_2, rve, Integrase_Zn,
GP36, Retrotrans gag, Integrase, Integrase_Zn,
TLV_coat) and used Hmmer http://hmmer.janelia.org to

Page 12 of 16

compare these Pfam domains to our de novo candidate
elements. Only if Hmmer had found at least one domain
with an E-value smaller than 0.01 in an element, we
kept the element for further analysis.
We used LTRharvest [39] with the minimum distance
between two LTR sequences (option-mindistltr) set to
2000 base pairs and allowed overlapping hits (optionoverlaps). We used find_ltr with default values. Both
programs, but especially LTRharvest, return overlapping
and nested elements. Where several elements were
nested, we only took the innermost element, because it
probably represents the younger element. Where elements overlapped, we randomly chose one of the elements for further analysis.
To divide our elements from both de novo sets into
Ty1/Copia, Ty3/Gypsy, BEL/Pao and DIRS classes, we
constructed specific hidden Markov models for each
class. To this end, we downloaded all canonical LTR
sequences, prototypic sequences that either represent
consensus sequences or a sequence example for a TE
family, for each of the four classes from Repbase
Update, a database containing repetitive DNA elements
in eukaryotes (478, 941, 106 and 68 sequences for Ty1/
Copia, Ty3/Gypsy, BEL/Pao and DIRS, respectively). We
then used the Pfam hidden Markov models [43] for the
domains listed in the previous paragraph, and identified
these domains in all sequences from a given class using
Hmmer (http://hmmer.janelia.org; E-value<0.0001). For
each LTR class we took all identified domain sequences
and aligned the sequences belonging to the same
domain using Mafft [30], checked the alignments manually for obvious errors, and constructed a new hidden
Markov model using Hmmer. We next used Hmmer to
compare each of the new candidate elements that we
had identified against these class-specific hidden Markov
models [42]. For each candidate element and each element class we obtained in this way an E-value that
reflects how well the element matches the class. We
assigned the candidate element to an element class if it
matched this class with the smallest (most significant)
E-value among all four classes we matched it with. If we
did not find a model with an E-value below 10-20, we
did not classify the element. By the time we had finished
this (time-consuming) analysis, a larger set of specific
hidden Markov models for each of the four element
classes than our set became freely available [22]. We
tested if this new set improved the classification substantially, which was not the case (results not shown).
At this stage, our analysis had created two sets of elements classified as BEL/Pao elements, one set from each
of our de novo searches. For each species, we then
merged these two BEL/Pao sets into one set of elements
according to the following rules: If only one of the
search algorithms had identified an element at a given

de la Chaux and Wagner BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:154
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/154

genome position, this element was used for the final set.
If both algorithms had identified an element at the same
position, we took the element identified by find_ltr,
because in our experience find_ltr identified the LTR
start and end positions more accurately. If both algorithm had identified an element within 20 bp of each
other, we took the element identified by find_ltr. Otherwise, if both algorithms had identified an element, and if
these elements were overlapping but their start and end
positions differed by more than 20 bp, we took the element which had a length between 2,000 to 15,000 bp.
We chose these length thresholds, because based on
known elements they are lower and upper bounds for
full length elements. If both elements were within this
length range, we randomly chose one element. If neither
element fulfilled this length criterion, we eliminated the
element from further analysis. This occurred only for
0.7 percent (53 out of 7914) of elements we analyzed.
In sum, our final set of BEL/Pao elements for each
species is a merged set from de novo identified elements
by LTRharvest [39] and find_ltr[40].
Family identification

The next stage of our analysis began with the BEL/Pao
elements we had identified, and grouped them into different families. To this end, we used the Markov cluster
(MCL) algorithm, a fast and scalable unsupervised Markov clustering algorithm for graphs based on simulation
of stochastic flow in graphs [27,28]. This algorithm subdivides a graph whose nodes are transposable elements,
and whose weighted edges reflect sequence similarity
among elements, into subgraphs. The algorithm defines
a family based on the higher connectivity between elements of one family than to elements of a different
family. It can therefore overcome the limitations of a
fixed similarity threshold (usually 80 percent) for classifying sequences into families. Such a threshold can lead
to an inconsistent classification of families, because
some element pairs within a family may be more similar
than the threshold, whereas others may be less similar.
Also, the mere choice of a single threshold lends an element of arbitrariness to the classification procedure,
which our approach avoids. Similar clustering
approaches were also used to identify protein families
between different species (for example [28,44]), and for
the reconstruction of a cyanobacterial tree from conserved protein families [45]. To create a graph out of
our BEL/Pao elements, we used a procedure suggested
by the author of MCL [27]http://www.micans.org/mcl/
man/clmprotocols.html. To be able to compare our
clustering to previously annotated families for selected
species, we additionally carried out clustering for each
species separately. We next describe our procedure in
greater detail.

Page 13 of 16

We first carried out an all-against-all nucleotide
sequence comparison of all elements using Blast[34],
and recorded all matches with an overlap of at least 500
bp (which corresponds to an average E-value cutoff
below e-5). If any pair of sequences matched over more
than one stretch of nucleotides, and thus showed two or
more matches, we only used the match with the lowest
E-value. For each pair of elements with a match, we
then converted the E-value into a similarity score in the
interval 0[200] by calculating the negative decadic logarithm of the E-value, and assigning all logarithmically
transformed scores greater than 200 a value of 200, thus
effectively truncating the score distribution at highly significant E-values. We then normalized these scores to
the interval 0[1]. Thus, a match with an E-value <e-200
received the score one, and a match with an E-value of
1 received the score zero.
In the graph-based grouping procedure we used, our
elements correspond to nodes and the similarity score
between two elements correspond to the edge weight
between the two nodes. We loaded the scores into BioLayout [46], a 3D graph visualization tool, and started MCL
[27] from within this tool. The inflation option of the
MCL algorithm affects the cluster granularity. We tested
different inflation values on our set of 178 BEL/Pao elements from the well studied Drosophila melanogaster genome, and compared the resulting clustering to the genome
annotation. We found that an inflation value of 4.0 and a
pre-inflation value of 3.0 best reproduced the known D.
melanogaster families. We also used these values for our
clustering analysis among genomes. Additionally, we set
the smallest detectable cluster size to one. BioLayout
assigns an arbitrary color to each element family, and
paints the nodes belonging to a family in that color.
Changing the length threshold for our blast matches
above would influence the number of element pairs we
find, and therefore the number of edges in our graph. A
lower length threshold would increase the edge number,
whereas a higher threshold would decrease it. We
explored different length thresholds and did not find qualitative differences between the clustering of the elements.
Also, the number of families with multiple elements did
not vary much. By decreasing the length threshold progressively, however, our approach identified fewer singletons (families with only one member), because increasing
numbers of singletons got added to existing multi-element
families. Conversely, increasing the length threshold,
results in more singletons, as families become more and
more fragmented. These new singletons typically are the
most diverged elements in a family.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction

We next describe how we constructed the phylogenetic
tree that helped us classify elements into superfamilies.

de la Chaux and Wagner BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:154
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/154

Our procedure had three steps. In the first, we defined,
separately for each family, a consensus sequence for
each of the protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase
domains (three consensus sequences per family). Second, we used these consensus sequences to produce a
multiple sequence alignment of elements in all families.
Third, we constructed a phylogenetic tree from this
alignment. We now describe important details of each
step.
In the first step, we constructed for each of the
families we had identified multiple alignments of the
protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase domains
using Mafft version 5 [30]. To this end, we used the
amino acid sequences of the domains of all elements
within one family. From the resulting alignments, we
constructed a consensus sequence for each domain
using the most common amino acid at any given position. If two or more amino acids were equally most
common, we chose one of them randomly.
Additionally, we required that an amino acid had to be
present (i) in at least one third of the sequences in the
alignment, and (ii) in at least two sequences. If we could
not identify a consensus amino acid at any one position
based on these rules, we used the letter ‘X’ in the consensus sequence at that position. If the average pairwise
similarity in the multiple alignment of one domain was
below 70 percent and/or more than 5 positions in the
consensus sequence correspond to an ‘X’, we validated
the alignment and consensus sequence manually.
In the second step, we used all families where a consensus sequence for all three domains was available (893
families in total, or 51.8 percent of all our families). To
be able to also include previously identified elements
and elements from species we had not analyzed, we
included all BEL/Pao elements from Repbase Update
[25] and from the Gypsy Database (GyDB) [23] where
we were able to identify all three domains (92 and 16
elements in total, respectively). Using these elements
and the families we had identified we constructed a
multiple alignment for each domain (three alignments
in total) based on the consensus sequences for each
family described in the preceding paragraph. We then
concatenated these three alignments into one alignment
in the order in which these domains occur in BEL/Pao
elements (protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase)
[16]. We concatenated sequences only after the alignment instead of before aligning them to avoid falsely
aligning sequences from different domains.
Based on the concatenated multiple alignment, we
then computed a phylogenetic tree of BEL/Pao elements
using PhyML_aLRT [31] a version of PhyML [32] that
incorporates an approximate likelihood ratio test to estimate the statistical support of the tree topology. This

approach is superior to a bootstrap calculation with
respect to accuracy and power, and it is computationally
much more efficient [31]. The method assigns to each
branch a statistical significance ranging from 0 (least
significant) to 1 (highly significant). We used the default
options of PhyML_aLRT with the JTT matrix for amino
acid substitutions, the proportion of invariable sites set
to zero, and with only one category of substitution rate
[32]. We chose the c2-based parametric branch support
for approximate likelihood ratio tests [31]. As outgroups
we used the domain sequences from the Copia and
Gypsy element in Drosophila melanogaster, as given by
Repbase Update [47,48].
We then separated our BEL/Pao families into superfamilies based on the major clades in the phylogenetic
tree. Using the protdist program from the PHYLIP
package [49] we calculated the average percent similarity
of sequence pairs within a superfamily, as well as for
sequence pairs whose members belonged to different
superfamilies.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Nucleotide sequence of all identified BEL/Pao
elements. Nucleotide sequence of all BEL/Pao elements that we
identified de novo in fasta format. Each record (element) has a unique
fasta identifier consisting of three parts: (i) element identifier, (ii) internal
family identifier as listed in additional file 4, and (iii) species identifier as
listed in additional file 2. All identifier are joined by the underscore
symbol ‘_’. For example, the identifier 5_NC-3_1 represents element 5
belonging to family NC-3 and is present in species 1 (Drosophila
melanogaster).
Additional file 2: List of used genomes, Repbase Update, and Gypsy
Database elements. All used metazoan genomes are listed together
with an internal identifier. Additionally we give the current URL from
which the genome sequence can be accessed, the accession numbers,
number of sequences of the genome included in our analysis, overall
number of nucleotides, the number of BEL/Pao elements we identified in
that genome, the number of different BEL/Pao families we identified in
that genome, and to which subkingdom/superphylum/phylum the
species belong. Additionally we list all mammalian genomes we used
and all genomes we excluded from our analysis. Furthermore, we give
the name of all BEL/Pao elements from Repbase Update and from the
Gypsy Database, together with the species name they occur in, and an
internal identifier. The internal identifiers are also used for the nucleotide
sequences in additional file 1 and in the sequence alignment of
additional file 7.
Additional file 3: BEL/Pao copy number per Mbps. A) The histogram
shows the number of genomes containing a given copy number of BEL/
Pao elements per Mbps. The inset shows the number of genomes
containing between zero and one BEL/Pao elements per Mbps. The
eight genomes containing more than one BEL/Pao element per Mbps
come from either fruit fly or mosquito species. B) Relationship between
total copy number and copy number per Mb for each genome. Each
point in the graph represents one genome and shows the total BEL/Pao
copy number and the copy number per Mbps. Note the logarithmic
scale on both axes.
Additional file 4: BEL/Pao families and their copy numbers. For each
BEL/Pao family we list the copy number, species, and the superfamily in
which they are present. Families that we did not use in the phylogenetic
tree construction are not assigned to a superfamily.

Additional file 5: Species specific family classification. We describe
the differences and agreements between the among-species family
classification as used in the main text and the within-species family
classification.
Additional file 6: Amino acid sequences of consensus domains. A
fasta file with all amino acid sequences for the domain consensus files
we used for the phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The identifier consists
of the family identifier (see additional file 4) and the domain name, for
example NC-1_integrase represents the consensus sequence of the
integrase domain of family NC-1.
Additional file 7: Multiple alignment of family domains. The multiple
alignment of 893 concatenated domain sequences. The phylogenetic
tree is based on this multiple alignment.
Additional file 8: Phylogenetic tree of BEL/Pao elements with
species names. The Figure shows the same tree as in Figure 4 in the
main text but with the species names shown in which the elements
occur. If a clade of elements contained only element families from the
same species or from very closely related species (e. g. mosquito
species), the clade was collapsed to reduce the size of the tree. All
species names are shown at the leaves of the tree. If all species in one
clade of the tree belonged to the same genus, such as the genus
Drosophila, only the genus name is shown, with the number of species
in brackets. Major clades are highlighted in different colors.
Additional file 9: Structural information of superfamilies. The table
shows the minimal, maximal, and median element lengths (in basepairs)
and the minimal, maximal and median LTR length for the major
superfamilies we identified.
Additional file 10: List of phyla covered by each superfamily. The
table shows the phyla in which BEL/Pao superfamily members were
identified.
