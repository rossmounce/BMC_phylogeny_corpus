Abstract

Homeobox genes have crucial roles during embryogenesis
and have been deeply studied from the point of view of the
evolution of development. Changes in their number and regulation may have been instrumental in body-plan evolution
and diversification [1]. Whether the physical linkage of many
homeobox genes is maintained by regulatory constraints or

is simply a reflection of their evolutionary origin by tandem
gene duplication has not yet been fully elucidated. The clustering of the Antennapedia superclass of homeobox genes in
contemporary genomes is proposed to be the outcome of
tandem gene duplication and cluster duplications from an
ancestral UrArcheHox gene during metazoan evolution
[2,3]. However, genome rearrangements, clade-specific

Conclusions: Most studies dealing with the origin and evolution of Hox and ParaHox clusters
have not included the Hox-related genes Mox and Evx. Our phylogenetic analyses and the
available linkage data in mammalian genomes support an evolutionary scenario in which an
ancestor of Evx and Mox was linked to the ProtoHox cluster, and that a tandem duplication of a
large genomic region early in metazoan evolution generated the Hox and ParaHox clusters, plus
the cluster-neighbors Evx and Mox. The large ‘coupled’ Hox-like cluster EvxHox/MoxParaHox was
subsequently broken, thus grouping the Mox and Evx genes to the Hox clusters, and isolating the
ParaHox cluster.

refereed research

Results: We claim that neither Mox nor Evx is a Hox or ParaHox gene. We propose a scenario
that reconciles phylogeny with linkage data, in which an Evx/Mox ancestor gene linked to a
ProtoHox cluster was involved in a segmental tandem duplication event that generated an array
of all Hox-like genes, referred to as the ‘coupled’ cluster. A chromosomal breakage within this
cluster explains the current composition of the extended Hox cluster (with Evx, Hox and Mox
genes) and the ParaHox cluster.

deposited research

Background: Hox and ParaHox gene clusters are thought to have resulted from the duplication
of a ProtoHox gene cluster early in metazoan evolution. However, the origin and evolution of the
other genes belonging to the extended Hox group of homeobox-containing genes, that is, Mox
and Evx, remains obscure. We constructed phylogenetic trees with mouse, amphioxus and
Drosophila extended Hox and other related Antennapedia-type homeobox gene sequences and
analyzed the linkage data available for such genes.

duplications and gene losses obscure the complete evolutionary chronicle.
The analysis of the human genome led Pollard and Holland
to suggest that four such clusters, namely the extended Hox,
the ParaHox, the NKL and the EHGbox clusters, arose by
successive tandem gene duplications and cluster duplications from an ancestral UrArcheHox gene early in metazoan
evolution [3]. The extended Hox array includes the Hox
cluster genes plus the former orphan classes Evx and Mox.
The evolutionary sister of the Hox cluster, the ParaHox
cluster, is believed to have resulted from the non-tandem
duplication of a four-gene ProtoHox cluster that gave rise to
the primordial Hox and ParaHox clusters [4]. Hence, Hox
and ParaHox genes have the same evolutionary age.
Although extensive studies have been performed to trace the
origin and evolution of the Hox genes [5-7] and more
recently the ParaHox plus Hox genes [4,8,9], Evx and Mox
have rarely been considered in these analyses. They have
been unified into the extended Hox group, owing to their
linked disposition in the genome of certain organisms; for
example, Evx genes are closely linked to the 5؅ end of the
Hox gene cluster in most vertebrates and in a cnidarian
species [10-12]. Likewise, Mox genes map near the opposite
extreme of the HoxA and HoxB clusters in the human
genome. These linkage data prompted Pollard and Holland
to propose that Evx and Mox genes originated during the
tandem duplication events that produced the ancestral Hox
cluster genes [3]. In a phylogenetic tree, Hox genes alone do
not form a monophyletic clade, but a clade containing both
Hox and ParaHox genes. Evx genes fall basal to the
Hox/ParaHox clade [8,13,14], while the Mox gene has
vaguely been referred to as a ParaHox gene and suggested to
represent the missing ParaHox gene related to the central
group (PG4 to PG8) of Hox genes. [14]. Unfortunately, most
studies on Hox/ParaHox relationships do not include the
Mox class [2,8,9]. Nonetheless, the two views of the evolutionary relationship between the Mox and the Hox and
ParaHox genes (Hox-related or ParaHox-related) are contradictory. If Mox genes are derived from the tandem duplication of a particular Hox gene (and thus linked to the Hox
gene cluster), they are not ParaHox genes. If Mox is a
descendant of the missing central ParaHox gene, it is not a
Hox gene, although it is linked to the Hox cluster. Following
the same reasoning, if Evx is the sister of Hox plus ParaHox
genes, it cannot have originated from the tandem duplication of a Hox gene.
All these discordant points of view led us to construct phylogenetic trees and search for data backing up the proposed
evolutionary relationships between the extended Hox group
(including Evx and Mox) and ParaHox genes. We discuss
outlines that may not have been considered yet, and draw an
evolutionary scenario, which attests that both Evx and Mox
were generated in the same duplication event that gave rise
to the Hox and ParaHox clusters.

Results and discussion
Mox and Evx are neither Hox nor ParaHox genes
Phylogenetic trees constructed with the homeodomain and
the homeodomain plus flanking residues showed similar
topologies. Figure 1 shows a neighbor-joining (NJ) unrooted
tree with the homeodomain plus flanking residues of
amphioxus, mouse and Drosophila sequences. Maximum
parsimony (MP) trees showed the same relationships (data
not shown). The resulting quartet puzzling (QP) tree was a
comb-like tree without any clear internal relationship. QP is
based on a maximum likelihood analysis of quartets and is
believed to be too conservative. Furthermore, none of the
clades below 50% support is retrieved at the final tree, which
may be due to the few amino-acid positions of the data, the
current lack of any reliable amino-acid model for the evolution of homeodomain-containing proteins and the stringency of the QP method. The trees obtained had three
outstanding features (Figure 1). First is the consistent grouping of the already proposed relationship for the Hox and
ParaHox genes: that is, Cdx is the posterior ParaHox gene
more closely related to the posterior group of Hox genes;
Xlox/Pdx1 is the ParaHox gene more closely related to group
3 of Hox genes; and Gsx is the ParaHox gene more closely
related to the anterior group of Hox genes. Second is the lack
of a ParaHox central gene, as only Hox genes are grouped
within the central group. The third feature is the grouping of
Mox and Evx class genes. The bootstrap value that supports
this relationship is 60%, higher than values reported elsewhere for Hox/ParaHox relationships [4,8,14]. Two major
conclusions can be drawn from the analyses: Mox is not the
central ParaHox gene, and not only Evx but also Mox genes
are equally related to both Hox and ParaHox genes, suggesting an early origin for both classes.
To investigate these relationships further, we constructed
various phylogenetic trees to which we added the sequences
of other closely related Antennapedia-type homeobox genes,
which have been shown to be linked to the extended Hox
cluster in certain mammalian genomes [3], that is, the Dlx
and the Msx classes of NKL homeobox genes and the
Engrailed, the Gbx and HB-9 classes of EHGbox homeobox
genes. As before, similar topologies were obtained when
trees were constructed with the homeodomain or with the
homeodomain plus 10 flanking residues each side, and by
NJ or MP analyses. Figure 2 shows an unrooted NJ tree
(Figure 2a) or the same tree rooted with selected EHG class
genes (En) as outgroup sequences (Figure 2b). Again, none
of the trees revealed a close relationship between Mox and
the central Hox genes. Besides, the resulting trees groups
together Evx and Mox classes, in a basal position with
respect to the monophyletic Hox and ParaHox group.

Alternative scenarios that include the non-tandem duplication of the ancestral Hox-like cluster would require further
steps, including the jumping of Mox across clusters. An
ancient duplication of the Evx/Mox ancestor gene, followed
by inversion of Evx/ProtoHox plus a local (non-tandem)
duplication restricted to the ProtoHox cluster, would
account as well for the present situation. Although they

Linkage data and phylogenetic trees allow us to envisage a
feasible scenario for the extended Hox/ParaHox cluster
origin and evolution (Figure 4). We propose that an ancestral precursor of Mox and Evx genes (here referred to as the
Evx/Mox ancestor) was linked to the UrProtoHox gene (step
1). The ProtoHox cluster was then generated by tandem
duplication of the UrProtoHox gene, thus forming, with the

Evx/Mox ancestor gene, an ancestral Hox-like cluster (step
2). Tandem duplication of the whole cluster and adjacent
regions gave rise to the ‘coupled’ Hox-like cluster (Evx plus
primordial Hox cluster and Mox plus primordial ParaHox
cluster, step 3). Thereafter, chromosomal breakage between
Mox and the primordial ParaHox cluster caused the loose
linkage of Mox at the anterior end of the Hox cluster (step
4). Finally, the further independent evolution of the primordial Hox and ParaHox clusters (expansion by internal
tandem duplications in the former and loss of the central
gene in the latter) accounts for the current composition of
the extended Hox and the ParaHox arrays in chordates (step
5). Note that steps 4 and 5 are interchangeable, and that Hox
cluster expansion and ParaHox reduction may have preceded chromosomal breakage.

remnant of such linkage. If this is so, a ParaHox Evx-type
gene is expected to be adjacent to and 5؅ of the Cdx gene, provided the Hox/ParaHox split involved genes adjacent to the
ProtoHox cluster. This is supported by the presence of genes
for tyrosine kinase receptors and collagens, among others, in
the vicinity of both Hox and ParaHox clusters ([15] and
Figure 3). Our phylogenetic data attractively suggest that
Mox may well be this gene. Furthermore, careful checking of
the mouse and human genomes revealed that, with the exception of mouse Mox2, Mox and Evx genes are linked to the
Hox clusters, but at either side of it: whereas Evx is tightly
linked to the 5؅ end of the Hox cluster (under 50 kb), Mox is
loosely linked to its 3؅ end (more than 5 Mb) (Figure 3).

Most studies dealing with the origin and evolution of Hox
and ParaHox clusters have not included the Hox-related
genes Mox and Evx. We have constructed phylogenetic trees
with Hox, ParaHox, Mox and Evx genes and analyzed the
available linkage data in mammalian genomes. We support
an evolutionary scenario in which an ancestor of Evx and
Mox was linked to the ProtoHox cluster, and that a tandem
duplication of a large genomic region early in metazoan evolution generated the Hox and ParaHox clusters, plus the
cluster-neighbors Evx and Mox. The large ‘coupled’ Hox-like
cluster EvxHox/MoxParaHox was subsequently broken,
thus grouping the Mox and Evx and the Hox clusters, and
isolating the ParaHox cluster. Whether this breakage happened only once early in evolution, or multiple times in
several places is unknown. It is tempting to speculate that a
particular extant lineage retains an unbroken version of the
‘coupled’ cluster.

This evolutionary scenario nicely squares linkage data on
Hox and ParaHox syntenic regions with phylogenetic evidence. It involves regional tandem duplication and chromosomal breakage but no polyploidization events or gene losses
at either side of the ParaHox cluster. Such breakage can be
dated before the duplication of the Hox and ParaHox clusters at the origins of vertebrates [4,16], since Mox1 and
Mox2 are linked to the HoxB and HoxA clusters in humans,
respectively (Figure 3). However, current linkage data in
protostomes do not allow us to trace such breakage further
back or determine whether such breakage took place independently in specific lineages. The Drosophila Evx homolog,
even-skipped, is not linked to the Hox cluster and the Mox
homolog, buttonless, is not in the proximity of the Hox
cluster nor close to the cad and ind ParaHox genes [17]. The
fly genome is probably highly derived from the protostome
ancestor, as is the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, which
lacks two ParaHox genes and the Mox gene [18]. Unfortunately, no linkage data from other invertebrates are available. Moreover, cnidarians probably have Hox and ParaHox
clusters derived from the primordial clusters (step 4 in
Figure 4). Interestingly Evx is linked to Hox genes in anthozoans [9,12], but nothing is known about the chromosomal
position of the cnidarian Mox homolog with respect to Hox
or ParaHox genes [19]. Thus, the existence of cnidarian Mox

reports

Current linkage data strongly favor the proposed outline. It
has been proposed that a segmental (non-tandem) duplication restricted to the ProtoHox cluster was involved in the
genesis of the extended Hox and ParaHox gene clusters
[3,4]. This seems unlikely, as in the neighborhood of the
mammalian Hox and ParaHox clusters, there are members
of other gene families (for example, tyrosine kinase receptors and collagens ([15] and Figure 3), implying that a larger
syntenic region can be traced back to the time of ProtoHox
cluster duplication.

and Evx genes, plus Hox and ParaHox, places the tandem
duplication of the ancestral Hox-like cluster in early metazoan evolution, before cnidarian divergence.

reviews

The evolutionary scenario proposed here stresses not only
the ancient origin of both Mox and Evx classes but also the
necessity of a tandem duplication event to originate the
extended Hox and ParaHox clusters. Moreover, not only the
ProtoHox cluster, but also neighboring regions (including
the Evx/Mox ancestor gene), were tandemly duplicated.

cannot be formally discarded, these scenarios seem unlikely,
as they demand more events of gene duplication and local
rearrangements than the model proposed here. Furthermore,
current linkage data for non-homeobox genes in the vicinity
of the Hox and ParaHox clusters (see below) suggest that a
larger region was implicated in these duplication events.

ParaHox clusters, forming a continuous array containing all the Hox-like genes (the ‘coupled’ Hox-like cluster; step 3). See text for details.

(mEn1, P09065); mouse engrailed2 (mEn2, P09066);
mouse HB9 (mHB9, NP064328). Sequences from other
organisms were omitted as the full set of genes is not available or the homeobox is not fully sequenced.

Trees were constructed using the homeodomain sequence
alone or the homeodomain plus ten flanking residues on both
sides. The phylogenetic methods used were maximum parsimony (MP), neighbor joining (NJ) and quartet puzzling (QP).
First, an alignment was constructed using the ClustalX
program [21] and was then edited by eye. NJ trees were
inferred by either ClustalX or MEGA 2.0 [22] using a Poisson
model for amino-acid evolution. Nodal support was assessed
by 1,000 bootstrap replicates. MP trees were inferred using
the MEGA 2.0 program, by applying the close-neighborinterchange method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. A QP
tree was inferred by TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 [23], using the JTT
model [24] with a Gamma distribution (eight categories
inferred from the data) and 10,000 replicates.

11.

Linkage information was obtained from the human and
mouse genome working draft web page [25].
