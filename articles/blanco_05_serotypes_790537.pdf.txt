Abstract
Background: Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli
(STEC) share the ability to introduce attaching-and-effacing (A/E) lesions on intestinal cells. The
genetic determinants for the production of A/E lesions are located on the locus of enterocyte
effacement (LEE), a pathogenicity island that also contains the genes encoding intimin (eae). This
study reports information on the occurrence of eae positive E. coli carried by healthy cattle at the
point of slaughter, and on serotypes, intimin variants, and further virulence factors of isolated EPEC
and STEC strains.
Results: Of 51 eae positive bovine E. coli strains, 59% were classified as EPEC and 41% as STEC.
EPEC strains belonged to 18 O:H serotypes, six strains to typical EPEC serogroups. EPEC strains
harbored a variety of intimin variants with eae-β1 being most frequently found. Moreover, nine
EPEC strains harbored astA (EAST1), seven bfpA (bundlin), and only one strain was positive for the
EAF plasmid. We have identified a new intimin gene (η2) in three bovine bfpA and astA-positive
EPEC strains of serotype ONT:H45. STEC strains belonged to seven O:H serotypes with one
serotype (O103:H2) accounting for 48% of the strains. The majority of bovine STEC strains (90%)
belonged to five serotypes previously reported in association with hemolytic uremic syndrom
(HUS), including one O157:H7 STEC strain. STEC strains harbored four intimin variants with eaeε1 and eae-γ1 being most frequently found. Moreover, the majority of STEC strains carried only
stx1 genes (13 strains), and was positive for ehxA (18 strains) encoding for Enterohemolysin. Four
STEC strains showed a virulence pattern characteristic of highly virulent human strains (stx2 and
eae positive).
Conclusion: Our data confirm that ruminants are an important source of serologically and
genetically diverse intimin-harboring E. coli strains. Moreover, cattle have not only to be considered
as important asymptomatic carriers of O157 STEC but can also be a reservoir of EPEC and eae
positive non-O157 STEC, which are described in association with human diseases.

Background
Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Shiga toxinproducing Escherichia coli (STEC) represent two of the at
least six different categories of diarrheagenic E. coli recognized at present [1]. Unlike other diarrheagenic E. coli,
EPEC and STEC share the ability to introduce attachingand-effacing (A/E) lesions on intestinal epithelial cells. A/
E lesions are characterized by destruction of the microvillus brush border through restructuring of the underlying
cytoskeleton by signal transduction between bacterial and
host cells, intimate adherence of strains to the intestinal
epithelium, pedestal formation and aggregation of
polymerized actin at the sites of bacterial attachment
[1,2]. The genetic determinants for the production of A/E
lesions are encoded in a pathogenicity island called the
locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) [3]. The LEE encodes
the outer membrane protein intimin, which is encoded by
the eae gene (for E. coli attachment effacement) localized
in the central region of LEE, a type III secretion system, a
number of secreted proteins (ESP), and Tir (for translocated intimin receptor), a protein encoded upstream of
the eae gene, which is translocated into host cells [2].
Characterization of eae genes revealed the existence of different variants. At present, 17 genetic variants (α1, α2, β1,
ξR/β2B, δ/κ/β2O, γ1, θ/γ2, ε1, νR/ε2, ζ, η, ι1, µR/ι2, λ, µB,
νB, ξB) have been identified (Table 4) [4-9]. The heterogeneous C-terminal (3') end of intimin is responsible for
receptor binding, and it is discussed that different intimin
variants may be responsible for different host and tissue
cell tropism [6,10-12]. Adu-Bobie et al. [4] found that
antigenic variation exists within the cell-binding domain
of intimins expressed by different clinical human EPEC
and STEC isolates and defined four intimin types (α, β, γ,
δ) based on type-specific PCR assays that used oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 3'end of specific eae
genes. Oswald et al. [5] described a type-specific PCR
assay which identifies a fifth intimin variant (intimin ε;
referred in the present study as ε1). They divided the
intimin alleles α, β, and γ based on restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR products
into α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1 and γ2 subtypes. Furthermore,
Oswald et al. [5] reclassified the δ type of Adu-Bobie et al.
[4] as a β2 subtype (referred in the present study as d/
β2O). Tarr and Whitam [13] presented a paper on the
molecular evolution of intimin genes in human STEC and
EPEC O111 clones and found two new types (ζ and θ).
The new ζ intimin type also was identified by Jores et al
[11] in bovine STEC and Blanco et al. [7] in ovine STEC.
Zhang et al. [6] observed that the sequences of eae-γ2 and
eae-θ were almost identical (99%), and they believe that
these two sequences should be considered one eae variant
(γ2/θ), as is referred in the present study. Recently, Zhang
et al. [6] determined the sequences of three new intimin
variant genes (κ, η, and ι; intimin ι referred in the present
study as ι1) found in human STEC strains. The sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/23

of the 3'variable region of eae gene of a new intimin (λ)
has been submitted to GenBank by China (unpublished
data) (Accession no. AF439538) and the whole intimin λ
gene was sequenced by Blanco et al. (unpublished data)
from a human strain (Accession no. AJ715409) and Ramachandran et al. [14] (Accession no. AF530557) from a
bovine strain. Ramachandran et al. [14] identified three
new intimin genes in ruminant E. coli strains belonging to
serotypes ONT:H- (intimin µ, referred in the present study
as µR/ι2), O2-related:H19 (intimin ν, referred in the
present study as νR/ε2) and ONT:HNT (intimin ξ, referred
in the present study as ξR/β2B) and they have also developed an intimin typing PCR-RFLP scheme that reliably
differentiates 14 intimin variants. When Ramachandran et
al. [14] submitted to GenBank the nucleotide sequences
of µ, ν, and ξ genes these intimin types were designated ι2,
ε2 and β2, respectively. Blanco et al. [8] have identified
four new intimin variant genes that they originally designated as β2, µ, ν, and ξ when the sequences were submitted to EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, and before
knowing the results obtained by Ramachandran et al.
[14]. The intimin β2 found by Blanco et al. (unpublished
data) in human typical EPEC strains of classical EPEC
serotype O119:H6 is identical to intimin ξ described by
Ramachandran et al. [14] in one bovine strain of serotype
ONT:HNT. Thus, in this study our β2 intimin is referred as
ξR/β2B. The other three intimins (µ, ν, and ξ) discovered
by Blanco et al. [[8], unpublished data] are different to the
existing intimin types and are referred to as µB, νB, and ξB
in this study, respectively.
EPEC strains are defined as eae-haboring diarrheagenic E.
coli that possess the ability to form A/E lesions on intestinal cells and that do not possess Shiga toxin genes [15].
Most EPEC strains belong to a series of O antigenic groups
known as EPEC serogroups: O26, O55, O86, O111,
O114, O119, O125, O126, O127, O128, O142, and
O158. EPEC are further classified as typical, when possessing the EAF (for EPEC adherence factor) plasmid that
encodes localized adherence (LA) on cultured epithelial
cells mediated by the Bundle Forming Pilus (BFP);
whereas atypical EPEC strains do not possess the EAF plasmid [15,16]. Typical EPEC, a major cause of infant
diarrhea in developing countries, are rare in industrialized
countries, where atypical EPEC seem to be a more important cause of diarrhea [1,16]. Typical and atypical EPEC
strains usually belong to certain serotype clusters, differ in
their adherence patterns on cultured epithelial cells (typical: LA; atypical: diffuse adherence (DA); aggregative
adherence (AA); localized adherence-like adherence
(LAL)), are typically found in different hosts (typical
EPEC strains have only been recovered from humans),
and display differences in their intimin variants [16].
Atypical EPEC appear to be more closely related to STEC
and as such are considered emerging pathogens [16,17].

STEC are responsible for a number of human gastrointestinal diseases, including diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and
hemorrhagic colitis (HC). In a proportion of individuals,
particularly in children, these conditions may be complicated by neurological and renal sequelae, including
hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) [18-20]. Most outbreaks and sporadic cases of HC and HUS have been
attributed to O157:H7 STEC strains [20-22]. In contrast,
especially in continental Europe, infections by non-O157
STEC, such as O26:H11/H-, O91:H21/H-, O103:H2,
O111:H-, O113:H21, O117:H7, O118:H16, O121:H19,
O128:H2/H-, O145:H28/H-, and O146:H21, are more
common and frequently associated with severe illness in
humans [1,23-27]. Probably, non-O157 STEC also play a
more important role in disease in Argentina [28], Australia [29], Chile [1], and South Africa [1]. STEC are characterized by elaborating two groups of potent phageencoded cytotoxins called Shiga toxins [18,19]. Pathogenic STEC very often possess other putative virulence factors as intimin (eae) and Enterohemolysin (ehxA)
[19,30,31].
Although a number of studies have determined the eae
subtypes of STEC strains isolated from humans, only a
limited number of studies have been undertaken to determine the intimin variants from a diverse collection of
STEC and EPEC isolated from cattle. Ruminants, especially cattle, represent an important reservoir of atypical

EPEC and STEC [16,20,32,33]. This study reports information on the occurrence of eae positive E. coli carried by
healthy cattle at the point of slaughter, and on serotypes,
intimin variants, and further virulence factors of isolated
EPEC and STEC strains.

Results
Detection and isolation of eae positive E. coli strains
Of the 330 fecal samples collected from cattle at slaughter,
132 (40%) tested positive for eae genes. From 51 randomly selected eae PCR-positive samples, 51 eae positive
E. coli strains were isolated by colony dot blot hybridization, confirmed as E. coli by biochemical properties, and
further characterized by phenotypic and genotypic traits.
Thirty strains carried no stx genes and were therefore
classified as EPEC, whereas the remaining 21 strains possessed at least one Shiga toxin gene, and were therefore
considered as STEC.
Serotypes of bovine eae positive E. coli strains
The 51 eae positive E. coli strains belonged to 18 O serogroups, 9 H types, and 23 O:H serotypes. However, 46%
of strains were of three serogroups, namely O26 (6
strains), O103 (12 strains), and O145 (5 strains), and
43% belonged to two H types, namely H2 (17 strains),
and H45 (5 strains). Thirty-two percent of strains were of
only three serotypes: O26:H- (3 strains), O103:H2 (11
strains), and O145:H- (5 strains). EPEC strains belonged

β2O, γ1, θ/γ2, ν R/ε2, η1, µR/ι2, λ, µB, νB, and ξB were
neither detected in bovine EPEC nor in bovine STEC.
EPEC strains harbored a variety of nine intimin variants
(α1, β1, ξR/β2B, κ, θ/γ2, ε1, ζ, η2, ι1). In 15 strains (52%)
eae-β (twelve times β1, twice β2), which was associated
with nine serotypes, in three strains eae-ε1, in three strains
eae-ζ, in three strains eae-η2, in two strains eae-ι1, in two
strains eae-κ, in one strain eae-α1, and in one strain eae-γ2/
θ were detected (Table 1). In contrast, STEC strains harbored only four intimin variants (β1,γ1,γ2/θ, ε1) with eaeε1 (10 strains, all of serotype O103:H2) and eae-γ1 (5
strains of serotype O145:H-, and one strain of serotype
O157:H7) being most frequently found (Table 2).
Intimins β1, ε1 and γ2/θ were present in both EPEC and
STEC strains.
Identification of a new intimin variant gene (eae-η2).
Sequence comparison
The complete nucleotide sequence of the new η2 variant
gene in three bovine bfpA and astA-positive EPEC strains
of serotype ONT:H45 was determined. Furthermore, a
fragment (566 bp strain FV5126 to 1728 bp strain
FV5114/2) of the 3'variable region of the eae gene of seven
representative strains was amplified and sequenced. The
eae sequences were deposited in the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database)
and the accession numbers assigned are indicated in table
3.

By using CLUSTAL W for optimal sequence alignment, we
determined the genetic relationship of the new intimin
gene (η2) and the remaining eae variants (Table 4). Thus,
the eae-η2 sequence is very similar to eae-η1 (identy of
98%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed six groups of the
closely related intimin genes: (i) α1, α2, ζ, and νB; (ii) β1,

δ/β2O, κ, ξR/β2B; (iii) ε1, ξB, η1, η2 and νR/ε2; (iv) γ1,
µB, and γ2/θ; (v) λ ; and (vi) ι1 and µR/ι2.
Further characterization of EPEC and STEC strains
Nine EPEC strains harbored the astA gene encoding for
EAST1 (Table 1). Additionally, three astA positive strains
of serotype ONT:H45 harbored the bfpA gene encoding
bundlin, whereas only one strain was positive for the EAF
plasmid. Overall, 23 different associations of serotypes
with virulence factors were identified in EPEC strains.

Of the 21 eae positive E. coli harboring genes encoding for
Shiga toxins, the majority (13 strains) carried only stx1
genes, 4 strains only stx2 genes, and 4 strains both toxin
genes (Table 2). The only stx1 positive strains belonged to
serotypes O5:H- (2 strains), O103:H2 (10 strains) and
O111:H21 (1 strain), the only stx2 positive strains to serotypes O26:H-, O26:H2, O145:H-, and O157:H7, and all
the strains positive for both toxin genes to serotype
O145:H-. Moreover, the majority of STEC strains (86%)
tested positive for the ehxA gene encoding for Enterohemolysin. Overall, ten different associations of serotypes
with virulence factors were identified.

Discussion
Of 51 eae positive E. coli strains, 59% were classified as
EPEC and 41% as STEC. The serogroups O26, O103, and
O145 and serotypes O26:H-, O103:H2, O145:H- were
most frequently found. Comparable distributions of
EPEC (57%) and STEC (43%) strains and serogroups
(44% of strains serotyped as O26, O103, O145, or O156)
were reported in strains isolated from healthy cattle in
Japan [34]. Of the typical EPEC serogroups (O26, O55,
O86, O111, O114, O119, O125, O126, O127, O128,
O142, and O156), only six strains were found in the
present study: four O26 strains, one O119 strain, and one

O128 strain. In bovine STEC strains, only a restricted
number of serotypes have been most commonly found
[8,20]: the predominant serotype in the majority of surveys realized in Europe was O113:H21, in America and
Australia O26:H11, and in Japan O45:H8/H- and
O145:H-. As in the present study, authors in Argentina,
Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United States
have found that many STEC recovered from cattle
belonged to serotypes previously associated with human
disease [8,35-38].
Intimin mediates the intimate bacterial attachment to the
host cell surface of EPEC and STEC, and is required for the
formation of the characteristic A/E lesions. In EPEC and
STEC strains isolated from human patients and from
healthy infants from Germany and Australia, intimin variants α1, β1, γ1 and γ2/θ were most frequently detected
[5,6,8,17,26]. Moreover, STEC serotypes commonly
recovered from outbreaks of HUS and hemorrhagic colitis
(O157:H7/H-; O111:H-; O26:H11/H-) typically possess
intimin γ1, γ2/θ, and β1 [5,6,8,14].
Overall, the 51 isolated eae positive bovine E. coli strains
comprised a variety of 10 intimin variants, and most of
them harbored eae-β1(33%), eae-ε1 (26%) and eaeγ1(16%). As it is known that different intimin variants are
associated with distinctive phylogenetic lineages of LEEpositive E. coli [4,39,40], the identified variety of bovine
eae positive strains further substantiates the reservoir function of cattle for infections of humans with LEE positive
strains.
Intimin β1 appears to be the most widespread variant
[7,8,14,27,39,41,42]. In that it has been found in both
EPEC and STEC strains from humans and several animal
species, and its presence is associated with multiple E. coli
serotypes. Strains harboring eae-β1 include important
human diarrheagenic serotypes such as EPEC O26:H11,
O111:H2, O114:H2, O126:H2, O128:H2 and STEC
O26:H11/H-, O118:H16 and O177:H- [5,26,27], serotypes partly also detected in this study.
Intimin ε1 was described for the first time in human and
bovine STEC of serogroup O8, O11, O45, O103, O121,
and O165 [5]. In this study, eae-ε1, was detected in three
bovine EPEC strains including one O103:H2 strain, and
in all 9 bovine STEC O103:H2 strains. Furthermore, in a
recent study performed on sheep in Switzerland, intimin
ε1 was detected in all STEC O103:H2 [43]. STEC O103:H2
strains have frequently been associated with HUS and
hemorrhagic colitis [26,27,44,45].
Intimin γ1 was restricted to STEC and associated with
serotypes considered as highly pathogenic to humans:
O145:H- (five strains) and, O157:H7 (one strain). In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/23

addition to these serotypes, eae-γ1 was previously
described in association with STEC O145:H28, and with
EPEC O55:H7/H-, from which STEC O157:H7 are
believed to have evolved [8,26,27,46].
Interestingly, one bovine EPEC O157:H45 strain harboring eae-α1 was detected. Moreover, eae-α1 was also
recently detected in bovine EPEC O157:H45 [33], in two
EPEC O142:H6 isolated from monkeys [47] and in a
human STEC O177:H7 strain [25]. These findings disagree with the suggested restriction of intimin α1 to human
EPEC strains of serotypes O55:H6, O127:H6, H34/H-,
O142:H6 [4,5].
We have identified a new intimin gene (η2) in three
bovine bfpA and astA-positive EPEC strains of serotype
ONT:H45. The complete nucleotide sequences of the new
eae-η2 (AJ879898, AJ879899, AJ879900) variant genes of
the three strains were determined. The new intimin η2
also was found in one EPEC ONT:H45 strain isolated
from a patient with diarrhea in Spain by Blanco et al.
(unpublished data, EMBL nucleotide sequence
AJ876652). Recently, a food-borne outbreak of diarrhea
involving 41 students (ages 12 to 15) was reported in
Japan by Yatsuyanagi et al. [48]. The implicated organism
was a EPEC ONT:H45, which hybridized with the probes
for eaeA, astA and bfpA genes.
In our study, about one third of EPEC strains harbored
astA as further putative virulence factor; whereas only
seven EPEC strains harbored bfpA encoding bundling, the
structural subunit of the bundle-forming pilus in typical
EPEC strains, and only one EPEC of serotype O157:H45
was positive for the EAF plasmid. Overall, bfpA seems to
be isolated very rarely from bovine EPEC strains, since
there are scarcely any reports of E. coli strains with bfpA
isolated from cattle. However, in a recent study, we characterized 11 O157:H45 EPEC strains isolated from cattle
in Switzerland and found 10 bfpA positive strains among
them [33].
To assess the pathogenicity of STEC, further evaluation of
virulence factors in addition to serotype is necessary.
O157 and non-O157 STEC strains isolated from patients
with severe symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, HC, and
HUS frequently show a typical virulence spectrum, with
such strains tending to be stx2 and eae positive [49-51].
Moreover, it was previously shown that bovine and
human strains harboring the eae gene were statistically
more likely to be positive for the ehxA gene encoding for
Enterohemolysin [7,26,52]. However, the impact of
Enterohemolysin, which was found in the majority of
STEC strains, is controversially discussed. Additionally,
STEC commonly recovered from outbreaks of HUS and
HC typically possessed eae-β1, eae-γ1 and γ2/θ [5-7,39]. In

consequence, apart of the stx2 gene, which was previously
reported to correlate with severe disease in humans,
intimin subtyping may facilitate further understanding of
associations among serotype, eae and stx subtype. In consequence, seven STEC strains (14% of all eae positive
strains and 33% of STEC strains) showed a virulence pattern characteristic of highly virulent human strains: four
O145:H- strains harboring stx1, stx2, eae-γ1, and ehxA, one
O26:H- strain harboring stx2, eae-β1, and ehxA, one
O145:H- strain harboring stx2, eae-γ1, and ehxA, and one
O157:H7 strain harboring stx2, eae-γ1, and ehxA.

secondary wash buffers, the presence of labeled probe was
detected with in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody detection kit and NBT/BCIP stock solution according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche).
Positive colonies were picked from the original sheep
blood agar and confirmed as E. coli by biochemical properties (acid production from mannitol, the o-nitrophenylβ-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) test, H2S and indole production, and proof of urease and lysine decarboxylase
activities) and by PCR to be eae positive [7]. One randomly chosen colony per sample was used for further
strain characterization.

Conclusion
Our data confirm that ruminants are an important source
of serologically and genetically diverse intimin-harboring
E. coli strains. Moreover, cattle have not only to be considered as important asymptomatic carriers of O157 STEC
but can also be a reservoir of EPEC and eae positive nonO157 STEC, which are described in association with
human diseases. The fecal carriage of foodborne pathogens among livestock animals at slaughter is strongly correlated with the hazard of carcasses contamination. In
order to reduce the risk represented by STEC and EPEC,
the maintenance of slaughter hygiene is consequently of
central importance in meat production.

Methods
E. coli strains
From 330 fecal samples, collected from Swiss cattle at
slaughter, 10 g were each enriched in 100 ml brilliant
green bile broth (BBL, Cockeysville, Md.) at 37°C for 24
h. The enriched samples were streaked onto sheep blood
agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.; 5% sheep blood
Oxoid, Hampshire, UK), and after incubation at 37°C for
another 24 h, the colonies were washed off with 2 ml of
0.85% saline solution. Two µl of each plate eluate were
then evaluated by PCR with primers EAE-1 and EAE-2
(Table 5) targeting sequences at the 5' eae conserved
region detecting all types of eae described at the moment.
From the 132 eae PCR-positive samples, 51 eae PCR-positive samples were then randomly selected for strain isolation with an eae DNA probe and colony dot-blot
hybridization.

The eae probes were prepared by labeling eae-PCR amplicons from E. coli O157:H7 strain 857/03 with DIG High
Prime kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, for colony hybridization, the 51 eae positive samples were plated
onto sheep blood agar and incubated overnight at 37°C.
Colonies were transferred to a nylon membrane (Roche),
and lysed following standard methods. After washing,
crosslinking, and prehybridization in DIG-Easy-Hyb
buffer (Roche) at 37°C for about 30 min, hybridization of
membranes with eae DNA probes was performed overnight at 42°C. After washing in pre-heated primary and

Further strain characterization
Determination of O and H antigens was performed by the
method described by Guinée et al. [53] with all available
O (O1 to O185) and H (H1 to H56) antisera. E. coli isolates that are nonmotile are described as having an Hflagellum type. Antisera were obtained and absorbed with
corresponding cross-reaction antigens to remove nonspecific agglutinins. O antisera were produced in the Laboratorio de Referencia E. coli (LREC) http://www.lugo.usc.es/
ecoli, and H antisera were obtained from the Statens
Serum Institut (Copenhagen, Denmark). E. coli strains
representing the new O groups O182 to O185 [unpublished data] were kindly provided by Flemming Scheutz
(International Escherichia Centre, Statens Serum Institut,
Copenhagen, Denmark).

All PCR assays applied in this study for characterization of
eae positive E. coli strains were performed in a T3 thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). PCR reagents
were purchased from PROMEGA (Madison, Wis.), and
primers were synthesized by MICROSYNTH (Balgach,
Switzerland). The 50-µl PCR mixtures normally consisted
of 2 µl of bacterial suspension boiled at 100°C for 5 min
in 42 µl of double-distilled water, 5 µl of 10-fold-concentrated polymerase synthesis buffer containing 2.0 mM
MgCl2, 200 µM (each) desoxynucleosid triphosphate
(dNTP), 30 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 U of Taq DNA
polymerase. The PCR primers, target sequences, product
sizes and references are listed in Tables 5 and 6. Differences in the normal PCR mixture and cycling conditions
for each PCR were previously described in the cited literature. To identify eae variants, intimin type specific PCR
assays using primers complementary to the heterogeneous 3' end of intimin genes were performed [8,9]. For
detection of further putative virulence genes all strains
were examined for the presence of stx genes with primers
VT1 and VT2 [54]. Stx positive strains were examined for
the presence of stx1 and stx2 genes [55,56]. Stx negative
strains were further examined for the presence of the EAF
plasmid [57], the bfpA gene on the EAF plasmid [58], and
the astA gene encoding EAST1 [59].
