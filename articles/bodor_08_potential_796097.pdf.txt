Abstract
Background: The autoinducer-2 (AI-2) group of signalling molecules are produced by both Gram
positive and Gram negative bacteria as the by-product of a metabolic transformation carried out
by the LuxS enzyme. They are the only non species-specific quorum sensing compounds presently
known in bacteria. The luxS gene coding for the AI-2 synthase enzyme was found in many important
pathogens. Here, we surveyed its occurrence in a collection of 165 marine isolates belonging to
abundant marine phyla using conserved degenerated PCR primers and sequencing of selected
positive bands to determine if the presence of the luxS gene is phylogenetically conserved or
dependent on the habitat.
Results: The luxS gene was not present in any of the Alphaproteobacteria (n = 71) and Bacteroidetes
strains (n = 29) tested; by contrast, these bacteria harboured the sahH gene, coding for an
alternative enzyme for the detoxification of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in the activated methyl
cycle. Within the Gammaproteobacteria (n = 76), luxS was found in all Shewanella, Vibrio and
Alteromonas isolates and some Pseudoalteromonas and Halomonas species, while sahH was detected
in Psychrobacter strains. A number of Gammaproteobacteria (n = 27) appeared to have neither the
luxS nor the sahH gene. We then studied the production of AI-2 in the genus Shewanella using the
Vibrio harveyi bioassay. All ten species of Shewanella tested produced a pronounced peak of AI-2
towards the end of the exponential growth phase in several media investigated. The maximum of
AI-2 activity was different in each Shewanella species, ranging from 4% to 46% of the positive
control.
Conclusion: The data are consistent with those of fully sequenced bacterial genomes and show
that the potential for luxS related signalling is dependent on phylogenetic affiliation rather than
ecological niche and is largest in certain groups of Gammaproteobacteria in the marine environment.
This is the first report on AI-2 production in Shewanella species; its signalling role in these organisms
remains to be elucidated.

Background
Cell to cell communication – also called quorum sensing
– by self-produced small signalling molecules (autoinducers) is a mechanism by which bacteria coordinate gene
expression within their population and in such a way
obtain optimum timing and efficiency, for example when
infecting a eukaryotic host, degrading polymers, or colonizing surfaces. While most quorum sensing mechanisms
studied to date are species specific, Bassler et al. [1] discovered an autoinducer in the marine pathogen Vibrio harveyi
which is the byproduct of a reaction carried out by a metabolic enzyme and thus has the potential to act as a universal bacterial signal.
Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) refers to a group of compounds
resulting from spontaneous cyclisation and hydration of
dihydroxypentanedione (DPD), which yields (2S,4S)-2methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran (S-THMF)
and
(2R,4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran (R-THMF) in chemical equilibrium. S-THMF spontaneously reacts with borate ions to form the active
compound detected by V. harveyi [2], while R-THMF, the
other stereoisomere, is unable to complex borate and is
sensed by Salmonella typhimurium [3] and probably by
Escherichia coli [4], but not by V. harveyi. The receptor proteins for S-THMF and R-THMF are not homologous, and
their three dimensional structures determine the specificity of their interaction with the respective signalling molecules [2,3].
DPD is produced only in the domain Bacteria as a byproduct of the activated methyl cycle. The pathway leading to DPD involves a two-step detoxification of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), namely by a MTA/SAH
nucleosidase (also called Pfs enzyme) and a S-ribosylhomocysteinase. The latter enzyme is also known as LuxS
enzyme or AI-2 synthase. The products of the reaction carried out by the LuxS enzyme are homocysteine and DPD,
which spontaneously forms the AI-2 group of compounds. However, all Eukarya, Archaea, and some phyla
within the domain Bacteria employ an alternative onestep detoxification of SAH using only a SAH hydrolase
(SahH) enzyme. These bacteria are therefore unable to
produce AI-2 [5,6].
The presence of the luxS gene (two step detoxification of
SAH leading to AI-2) versus the sahH gene (one step
detoxification) was previously surveyed in the genomes of
fully sequenced bacteria [6,7]. Thus, the luxS gene was
found in some Gamma- and Betaproteobacteria, all Epsilonproteobacteria, none of the Alphaproteobacteria, none of
the Actinobacteria, all Firmicutes and some Spirochaetes.
Since the majority of the fully sequenced bacteria at the
time were pathogens, and the number of genomes within
the various phylogenetic groups was sometimes very

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/13

small, it had to remain open if the presence of the luxS
gene is phylogenetically conserved or if it has been
acquired through lateral gene transfer by pathogens.
In the sea, the three most abundant groups of heterotrophic bacteria are members of the Alphaproteobacteria,
Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes [8-10]. Therefore,
here we studied a collection of 165 marine isolates from
these three phylogenetic groups [11,12] for the presence
of the luxS gene using PCR amplification with conserved
degenerated primers and sequencing of selected bands.
Since the absence of the luxS gene could theoretically be
due to lack of primer specificity, we confirmed our results
by determining the presence of the sahH gene, representing the alternative pathway for SAH detoxification. Most
bacteria have either the luxS or the sahH gene in monocopy. There are several exceptions, e.g. Escherichia blattae
carries both genes, and some bacteria have neither luxS
nor sahH [6,7].
Within the Gammaproteobacteria, the luxS gene was
detected in all Shewanella strains consistently. The genus
Shewanella was first described in 1985 [13] and includes
organisms that have been associated with spoilage of proteinacous food (S. putrefaciens) as well as opportunistic
human pathogens (S. algae) [14,15]. During the past two
decades, members of the genus Shewanella have mostly
been studied for their involvement in anaerobic transformations important for biogeochemical cycling of elements. The coupling of growth and energy generation to
the dissimilatory reduction of iron and manganese oxide
have been demonstrated in S. oneidensis MR-1 for the first
time in 1988 [16-18]. Although the luxS gene has been
found in S. oneidensis and in several draft genomes of
Shewanella strains which are currently sequenced, AI-2
production has not yet been investigated in this genus,
which comprises both pathogenic and free living species.
Therefore, here we determined the ability of nine
Shewanella type strains and one new marine Shewanella
isolate to stimulate luminescence of the AI-2 biosensor
strain V. harveyi BB170 and indeed confirmed the production of AI-2 in all of them for the first time.

Results
In this study, 148 strains were investigated which have
been isolated from various habitats of the North Sea near
the island of Helgoland, e.g. the surface of microoalgae
(diatoms, dinoflagellates) and macroalgae (laminaria),
suspended particles, in situ grown biofilms, and the picoplankton [11,19]. In addition, 8 strains from the hypersaline Antarctic Ekho Lake were also included [12]. The
marine isolates were identified on the basis of near complete 16S rRNA gene sequences and belonged to 3 different phylogenetic groups: Alphaproteobacteria (71 isolates),
Bacteroidetes (29), and Gammaproteobacteria (64). In order

to confirm the results which were obtained on the marine
Shewanella isolates, eight type strains of the genus
Shewanella and one Alishewanella fetalis type strain were
also investigated (see Additional file 1 for a complete list
of strains tested).
Identification of the luxS gene
All marine isolates were screened with primers
LuxS_degfor3 and LuxS_degrev4; for the Gammaproteobacteria,
the
primer
set
luxS_gamma_for
and
luxS_gamma_rev (Table 1) was also used. The luxS gene
was not found in any of the Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes strains tested (Additional file 1), consistent with
the survey of fully sequenced microbial genomes published previously [6,7].

In the Gammaproteobacteria, the fully sequenced genomes
available through NCBI in January 2007 revealed that
some representatives use the two step detoxification of
SAH, hence contain the pfs gene and the luxS gene, while
others use the one-step detoxification of SAH, thus harbour the sahH gene. There are several parasitic and also
some free living species which have neither luxS nor sahH,
but only the pfs gene. We screened 64 marine Gammaproteobacteria for the presence of the luxS gene (Additional
file 1). It was found in all strains of Alteromonas, consistent
with the full genome sequence of Alteromonas hydrophila.
It was also found in seven of 13 strains of Halomonas
tested; no complete genome sequence is available in this
genus yet. In the genus Pseudoalteromonas, two genome
sequences have been completed, i.e. P. haloplanktis and P.
atlantica. Both species have neither a luxS nor a sahH
homologue, but contain only the pfs gene. We tested 28
Pseudoalteromonas isolates, and found a PCR band of the
expected size in 12 of them. In one strain the band could
be confirmed by sequencing to represent a luxS gene fragment. Finally, the luxS gene was identified in the marine
Shewanella (three strains) and Vibrio (three strains) isolates, as expected from the completed genomes in these
genera. In order to determine if the luxS gene was consistently present in the Shewanellaceae family, nine type
strains were investigated (including A. fetalis). In all of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/13

them the luxS gene could be amplified and verified by
sequencing.
Identification of the sahH gene
The sahH gene is responsible for the S-adenosylhomocysteinase enzyme, which is able to detoxify SAH in one
step without production of AI-2. In bacteria, usually either
sahH or luxS is present as a single copy. All strains were
tested with both sahH primers (Table 1). The sahH gene
was identified in 66 out of 71 Alphaproteobacteria and in all
29 Bacteroidetes strains (Additional file 1), confirming that
the strains from these phyla do not have the ability to produce AI-2 through the LuxS enzyme. Interestingly, the
sahH gene was also found in some Gammaproteobacteria,
namely in three strains of Psychrobacter sp. (HEL-6, HEL32 and HEL-44). Two Psychrobacter species have been fully
sequenced and also have the sahH gene (Additional file
1). Full genome sequences of representatives of two additional species of Gammaproteobacteria (Idiomarina loihiensis and Saccharophagus degradans) also revealed the
presence of sahH (Additional file 1).
Lack of both the sahH and the luxS gene
In five of the 31 Alphaproteobacteria investigated, and in 27
of the 64 Gammaproteobacteria investigated, neither the
luxS nor the sahH gene was detected. Available whole
genome sequences of the phylogenetically closest organisms in the NCBI database were checked for comparison,
since it can never be excluded that a negative result in PCR
is caused by a primer mismatch. Within the Alphaproteobacteria, lack of both luxS and sahH has previously only
been seen in the parasitic Ricksettia species [7], as well as
in the genera Neoricksettia, Wolbachia, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia [6]. In the Gammaproteobacteria, the lack of both
genes has previously been observed, and SAH recycling
presumably occurs through the MTA/SAH nucleoidase
alone [7]. Ten of the 27 strains where neither luxS nor
sahH could be identified belonged to the genera Glaciecola, Halomonas or Marinobacter, where genome
sequences are not yet available. However, 17 strains
belonged into the genus Pseudoalteromonas. The fully
sequenced genomes of P. haloplanktis and P. atlantica also

have neither luxS nor sahH, suggesting that this result
might not be caused by primer mismatch but is actually
correct and indicates SAH detoxification by the Pfs
enzyme in these strains. However, confirmation of band
identity proved difficult due to the simultaneous amplification of another gene of similar size. It can therefore not
be excluded that more luxS genes might have been
detected using different primers.
AI-2 production in Shewanella and Alishewanella species
Several of the Gammaproteobacteria species which did not
have the luxS gene were tested for AI-2 activity using the V.
harveyi bioassay. AI-2 could not be detected, confirming
the PCR result (data not shown). All Shewanella and Alishewanella strains contained the luxS gene and were tested
for AI-2 activity, which was detected in all of them. Table
2 shows the summary of all 73 bioassays conducted; for
each species, the maximum A1-2 activity is averaged for
the indicated number of bioassays. Average maximum
fold induction values were between 4% (e.g. S. hafniensis,
S. marinintestina) and 46% (S. japonica). Figure 1 shows a
subset of these data; for each species, two different cultures are shown, each of which was tested in two different
bioassays independently. Variability between cultures and
between replicate bioassays was sometimes very high.
Independent of the level of AI-2 activity detected, the
same growth phase dependent pattern of production was
observed in all investigated strains. Fig. 2A shows this for
two representative species, A. fetalis with low, and S.
japonica with high maximum AI-2 activity. In all
Shewanella strains AI-2 activity reached its maximum
towards the end of the exponential growth phase and
decreased during stationary phase. In species with high
AI-2 activity, this decrease occurred gradually. By contrast,
if the AI-2 activity was low, it disappeared rapidly at the
beginning of the stationary phase within 2 – 4 hours. At
the late stationary phase (after 24 h of growth), no AI-2
activity was detected in any of the strains tested. The same

example, Fig. 2B shows AI-2 production of S. hafniensis

AI-2 activities at the same growth phase in both of them.
S. oneidensis was also cultivated anaerobically using iron
as an electron acceptor (with 10 and 20 mM ferric citrate,
respectively). Under these conditions, growth was very
slow and AI-2 activity was not found (data not shown).

Within the Gammaproteobacteria, the luxS gene was found
in all strains of the genera Alteromonas, Shewanella and
Vibrio consistent with results from fully sequenced
genomes in these genera. It was for the first time found in
some strains of the genus Pseudoalteromonas. In this genus,
whole genome sequencing and PCR amplification indicate that many representatives have neither the luxS nor
the sahH gene and thus use only the Pfs enzyme for
removal of SAH.

Isolates belonging into the Alphaproteobacteria had the
sahH gene consistently and did not contain the luxS gene.
Therefore, they use the one-step detoxification of SAH and
do not have the potential for communication by AI-2.
These results confirm previous work based on fully
sequenced genomes [5,7].

The same is true for the genus Halomonas, where the luxS
gene was found in some but not all representatives. Species from several other genera of fully sequenced Gammaproteobacteria (Marinobacter, Glaciecola, Colwellia) also
contained neither the luxS nor the sahH gene. In addition,
in the genus Psychrobacter (3 isolates) the sahH gene was
found consistently, in accordance with fully sequenced
genomes in this genus.

Discussion
Phylogenetic distribution of the sahH and luxS genes
In all Bacteroidetes isolates tested here, and in all fully
sequenced Bacteroidetes strains, the SahH pathway was
present, with the exception of Porphyromonas gingivalis,
which uses the Pfs/LuxS pathway [20,21]. This may indicate that horizontal gene transfer occurred in this species.
The main habitat of this bacterium is the oral cavity,
where many of the cultivated species use the Pfs/LuxS
pathway [22,23] and gene transfer might have a high
probability. Several events of gene transfer have been
demonstrated for the LuxS enzyme previously [7,24]. A
recent report demonstrated AI-2 activity in some Bacteroides isolates, although the luxS gene could not be identified [25].

The data strongly support the conclusion that the distribution of the luxS gene is dependent on the phylogenetic
position of an organism rather than on the ecological
niche which it has occupied, with rare exceptions which
may have been caused by horizontal gene transfer. The
complex pattern of presence/absence of luxS versus sahH
in the Gammaproteobacteria requires a thorough analysis of
the organismal phylogeny and possible gene transfer
events in this group, which may not be monophyletic
[26,27].
The genus Shewanella and the production of autoinducer2
The Shewanella type strains investigated here were isolated
from the sediment of Lake Oneida (S. oneidensis) [17], the
intestines of marine animals (S. marinintestina, S. sairae, S.
schlegeliana)[28], Antarctic sea ice (S. frigidimarina) [29], a
human fetus (A. fetalis) [30], and marine seawater and
mussel samples (S. japonica) [31]. S. algae was isolated
from red algae [32] and was differentiated from the first
described member of the genus, S. putrefaciens, only
later[33]. S. hafniensis [34] was isolated from fish in the
Baltic Sea, and is 98% similar to the marine isolate DT-1
obtained from the surface of a diatom [11].

All Shewanella/Alishewanella strains were able to induce
luminescence in the V. harveyi BB170 reporter strain, indicating that they produced the DPD derivative S-THMF
which can be sensed by V. harveyi and which is usually

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:13

referred to as AI-2. The large differences in the levels of AI2 seen in the various species of Shewanella are partly due
to the variability of the bioassay; however compounds
inhibitory to V. harveyi might also be produced by some
strains. For example, stationary phase culture supernatants of S. algae and S. oneidensis were able to inhibit V.
harveyi luminescence (data not shown). Alternatively, the
highly unstable DPD might be converted to compounds
other than AI-2 in Shewanella, or the chemical equilibrium
between S-THMF and R-THMF might be shifted towards
the R-THMF molecule which cannot be detected by Vibrio.
Production of AI-2 during growth
In all Shewanella strains, the pattern of AI-2 production
during growth was the same. The amount of AI-2 detected
in the culture supernatant had a maximum towards the
end of the logarithmic growth phase. Subsequently, it
decreased and disappeared completely in the late stationary phase. A similar pattern is observed in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli [4,35]. In these bacteria, AI-2
triggers its own uptake through induction of an ABC
transporter in the late logarithmic growth phase, followed
by intracellular degradation. AI-2, or rather, R-THMF, is
specifically sensed by Salmonella through the LsrR protein
which bears remote resemblance to ribose transporters. In
Salmonella and E. coli, there is little evidence of cell-cell
communication through AI-2. However, nothing is
known at the moment about the mechanism responsible
for the disappearance of AI-2 from the culture supernatant
in Shewanella species. A protein with weak homology
(27% identity) to the LsrB protein is present in S. oneidensis, but most of the other genes in the lsr operon are missing.

Conclusion
In this study, a phylogenetically and ecologically well
characterized collection of 165 marine isolates was examined for their potential for communication by AI-2. For
this aim, the presence of the luxS and sahH genes – representing the two pathways for SAH recycling – was determined by PCR with degenerate primers and sequencing.
The majority of the isolates tested here belonged to phyla
where whole genome sequence analysis had indicated the
presence of the sahH gene rather than the luxS gene (Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes), and this was clearly confirmed
in
our
work.
Within
the
marine
Gammaproteobacteria, the more complex picture which
was already seen in earlier investigations [5-7] was confirmed in this study, with some strains harbouring the
luxS gene, while the sahH gene was present in others, and
many strains containing neither of those genes, raising
questions regarding the evolution of the Gammaproteobacteria and of the Pfs/LuxS and SahH pathways, respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/13

In the second part of our work, we focused on the genus
Shewanella. The luxS gene was consistently found in all
marine Shewanella isolates and all Shewanella type strains
tested. The ability to induce luminescence in the V. harveyi
reporter strain was demonstrated in 10 species of the
genus Shewanella, both opportunistic pathogens and free
living species. The kinetics of AI-2 production was very
similar in all Shewanella species, showing a peak in the late
logarithmic growth phase, and the disappearance of AI-2
from the culture medium during stationary phase. It will
be the aim of future studies to elucidate the role of AI-2 in
Shewanella.

Methods
Strains, Media and Cultivation Conditions
A total of 176 strains was investigated, of which 167 had
been isolated from marine or hypersaline environments
previously [11,12] and 9 were type strains of the genera
Shewanella and Alishewanella. The environmental strains
were identified on the basis of near complete 16S rRNA
gene sequences as described [11]. A complete list of investigated strains and their phylogenetic affiliation is given in
Additional file 1.

V. harveyi BB152 ATCC® BAA1119™ and V. harveyi BB170
ATCC® BAA-1117™ [1] were used for the bioassay to detect
AI-2. V. harveyi BB170 carries a transposon insertion in the
luxN gene, coding for the sensor for AI-1, and is therefore
sensitive to AI-2 only. It is used as the sensor strain. V. harveyi BB152 carries a transposon insertion in the luxM gene
responsible for AI-1 synthesis and thus produces AI-2, but
not AI-1. Its culture supernatant was used as a positive
control [1].
Shewanella strains were cultivated under aerobic conditions at room temperature with shaking at 160 rpm in
Erlenmeyer flasks, with the exception of S. oneidensis
(30°C), A. fetalis and S. algae (37°C), and S. sairae
(20°C). Media used were Luria broth (LB, Sigma), LBSS
(LB with sea salts, composed of LB (Sigma) and 7 g/L sea
salts (Sigma)), MB (marine broth, MB 2216, Difco) or SM
(Shewanella Marine Medium) [36]. SM medium contained 5 g bacto peptone, 1 g yeast extract, 1× salt solution
(5× salt solution: 2.58 M NaCl, 0.125 M MgCl2, 0.125 M
MgSO4, 0.1 M KCl) per litre.
S. algae was also cultivated under anaerobic conditions
without shaking at 30°C in LB medium supplemented
with 20 mM Na-D,L-lactate (Fluka) and 10 mM or 20 mM
ferric citrate (Sigma). Oxygen was removed from the
medium by purging with N2. The bacterium was inoculated from an aerobic LB plate into anaerobic liquid
medium (first transfer). After the third transfer growth was
monitored and culture supernatants were collected for AI2 determination.

V. harveyi BB152 and V. harveyi BB170 were cultivated in
modified autoinducer bioassay (AB) medium [37]. The
AB basic solution contained 0.3 M NaCl and 0.05 M
MgSO4, and was autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min. After
cooling down, the following components were added
from sterile stocks: 20 ml casamino acids (10%), 20 ml
glycerol (50%), 10 ml potassium phosphate buffer (1 M,
pH = 7) and 10 ml L-arginine (0.1 M).
Growth was monitored by measuring optical density
(OD) at 600 nm in a Ultraspec Plus Spectrophotometer
(Pharmacia).
Design of primers for the luxS and sahH genes
Degenerate primers were designed targeting highly conserved regions of the luxS and sahH gene, respectively,
based on multiple alignments (ClustalW) of LuxS and
SahH amino acid sequences. The alignment of the corresponding nucleic acid sequences was used to decide on a
nucleotide in the primer sequence in case of degeneracy of
the code.

Since the luxS gene is only moderately conserved, the consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer design
strategy (CoDeHOP) [38] was chosen for primers
LuxS_degfor3 and LuxS_degrev4 (Table 1). According to
this approach the primers are composed of two parts: a
highly degenerate 5' end and a specific 3' end. The function of the degenerate 5'end is to bind to all possible templates in the first PCR cycles. Therefore, it targeted a region
of 3–4 highly conserved amino acids, and covered all possible variations present in the nucleic acid sequence alignment. The role of the specific 3'end is to stabilize the
binding of the primers in the later PCR cycles. Its sequence
was identical to the most frequent nucleic acid sequence
in the alignment and was about 20 bp long. At the time of
primer design (July 2004) 24 complete luxS sequences of
Gram negative bacteria were available. The luxS gene is
about 500 bp long; and the primer pair LuxS_degfor3 and
LuxS_degrev4 amplified ca. 400 bp (Table 1).
In addition, a second, more specific, primer set was
designed especially for the luxS gene in Gammaproteobacteria without using the CoDeHOP approach. The
LuxS_gammafor1 primer targeted the same region as
LuxS_degfor3. The LuxS_gammarev2 primer targeted the
highly conserved mGC*TG*y region in the middle of the
luxS gene. A fragment of about 250 bp was amplified with
this primer set.
The sahH gene is highly conserved and much longer than
the luxS gene (about 1400 bp). Therefore, longer conserved amino acid sequences could be identified and it
was not necessary to use the CoDeHOP strategy. 60 bacterial sahH sequences were used for the alignment and a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/13

universal primer set (SahH_degfor and SahH_degrev; see
Table 1) was designed which worked from 40°C till 60°C
and amplified about 470 bp.
In some Alphaproteobacteria, these primers did not amplify
the sahH gene. Therefore primers specific for this group
were designed (Table 1). Primer SahH_alphafor targeted
the AETEMPGL region that is completely identical in all
sequenced sahH genes in Alphaproteobacteria. The primer
SahH_alpharev targeted the G*G*VGKGS conserved
region around the middle of the gene which is part of the
NAD binding domain reported previously [39]. This
primer set amplified about 700 bp and was able to
amplify sahH genes in additional Alphaproteobacteria at an
annealing temperature of 60°C.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Sequencing
DNA was isolated using the Nucleospin Tissue kit (Macherey & Nagel). The PCR primers are listed in Table 1. The
PCR reaction mix contained: 1× PCR buffer (Qiagen); 3
mM MgCl2 (Qiagen); 1.25 U Taq polymerase (Qiagen); 1
µM forward and reverse primer each (Gibco); 200 µM
dNTPs (Fermentas); 1 µl DNA and MilliQ water (Fluka)
up to an end volume of 50 µl. The PCR protocol was as
follows: Predenaturation at 94°C for 1 min, followed by
30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 10 sec, annealing for
30 sec at the temperatures given in Table 1, and elongation at 68°C for 40 sec (luxS gene) resp. 50 sec (sahH
gene); finally postelongation was carried out at 68°C for
1 min 30 sec. The annealing temperatures listed in Table
1 were determined by PCR with a temperature gradient
from 40 to 60°C. All of the PCRs were done in an Eppendorf Mastercycler.

The PCR products were visualised on 1.5% agarose gels
(agarose NEEO ultra-quality, Roth). Bands that were chosen for sequencing were excised from the gel and purified
using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit. Excised bands were
sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit on an ABI 3730 × l DNA analyser.
Determination of AI-2 using the Vibrio harveyi bioassay
AI-2 activity was always determined throughout the complete growth curve for at least 24 h. Samples were taken
every 30 – 60 min until stationary phase was reached,
then larger sampling intervals were used. Sterile culture
supernatants were prepared from 1 ml of culture fluid by
centrifugation (13.000 rpm, 2 min) and filtration (0.22
µm) and were stored at -20°C until use. The assay was
conducted in white micro titre plates (Nunc) which were
prepared before the assay by pipetting 20 µl of samples,
reference and control in at least four replicas into the
wells. Plates were stored at -20°C until use. DPD was synthesized as described [40]. The concentration of DPD (M
= 132 g/mol) was 0.7 mg/ml, e.g. ca. 5.3 mM. This solu-

tion was diluted 1:1000 in AB medium and served as a
positive control. In some bioassays culture supernatant
from V. harveyi BB152 served as a positive control.
The assay described by Bassler [41] was slightly modified
[42]. Briefly, the sensor strain V. harveyi BB170 was inoculated from a freshly prepared AB plate with a well luminescent culture into 20 ml AB liquid medium in an
Erlenmeyer flask with baffles and incubated (160 rpm,
30°C) until it reached an OD600nm = 1.0 and showed
strong luminescence in the dark room. At this growth
stage the sensor strain was diluted 1:5000 in fresh AB
medium. 180 µl of the diluted culture were immediately
added to the previously prepared, warmed-up micro titre
plates with the samples. Plates were incubated at 30°C
with shaking at 600 rpm on a Heidolph Titramax -1000
micro titre plate shaker and luminescence was measured
every hour for up to 8 hours in a Wallac Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter (Perkin Elmer). AI-2 activity was calculated as the fold change between luminescence of the
sample and luminescence of the reference. The reference
for the positive control was AB medium, and the reference
for the test samples was the growth medium in which the
respective test strain had been cultivated. The percentage
of AI-2 activity was calculated as the fold induction of test
sample divided by that of the positive control.
