Abstract
Background: The invasive garden ant, Lasius neglectus, is the most recently detected pest ant and
the first known invasive ant able to become established and thrive in the temperate regions of
Eurasia. In this study, we aim to reconstruct the invasion history of this ant in Europe analysing 14
populations with three complementary approaches: genetic microsatellite analysis, chemical
analysis of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles and behavioural observations of aggression behaviour.
We evaluate the relative informative power of the three methodological approaches and estimate
both the number of independent introduction events from a yet unknown native range somewhere
in the Black Sea area, and the invasive potential of the existing introduced populations.
Results: Three clusters of genetically similar populations were detected, and all but one population
had a similar chemical profile. Aggression between populations could be predicted from their
genetic and chemical distance, and two major clusters of non-aggressive groups of populations
were found. However, populations of L. neglectus did not separate into clear supercolonial
associations, as is typical for other invasive ants.
Conclusion: The three methodological approaches gave consistent and complementary results.
All joint evidence supports the inference that the 14 introduced populations of L. neglectus in
Europe likely arose from only very few independent introductions from the native range, and that
new infestations were typically started through introductions from other invasive populations. This
indicates that existing introduced populations have a very high invasive potential when the ants are
inadvertently spread by human transport.

Background
Exotic species are a major threat to biodiversity and
human welfare, and infestations by invasive species have
generally proven difficult and expensive to exterminate [1-

3]. The cheapest and most effective control strategy would
thus be to prevent invasive species from infesting new
localities from the beginning [4]. This is only possible,
however, if detailed knowledge of the pathways of introPage 1 of 14

duction into new localities is available [5-7]. This type of
information is difficult to obtain by direct monitoring, as
today most invasive species are introduced unintentionally by human activities: one example is the transport of
ballast water, by which ships regularly mix marine species
across continents, creating an enormous potential for species invasions [8]. Furthermore, population sizes of introduced species are typically small and thus unrecognisable
on arrival, therefore only becoming obvious after lag
phases that can reach up to several decades [9]. An increasing number of studies have thus used genetic markers in
an attempt to trace back source populations and estimate
the number of independent introduction events [10-13],
as in the case of an avocado-infecting thrips species
recently introduced to California that is now an agricultural pest [11]. Genetic marker studies are of great general
significance as they can be used to not only unravel phylogeographic relationships between populations, but also
to estimate the genetic diversity within populations,
which typically reflects the severity of founder effects in
each population (genetic bottlenecks) [14,15]. These
genetic effects should be even more pronounced in populations that are a result of sequential introduction events
(see, for example, [16]).
Invasive species are not limited to specific taxa or habitats
and range from terrestrial plants such as the fire tree
(Myrica faya) to aquatic animals such as the zebra mussel
(Dreissena polymorpha) [17]. Social insects, particularly
ants, seem to be especially efficient invaders, with the ants
representing 5 species of the list of "100 of the world's
worst invasive alien species" [17]. The best known invasive ants are the red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the
Argentine ant Linepithema humile and the Pharaoh ant
Monomorium pharaonis [18]. However, with the exception
of invasive Pharaoh ants that inhabit buildings, pest ants
have so far remained restricted to climates with warm winters and have not been able to penetrate any cold-temperate regions.
This picture changed in 1990 when the invasive garden
ant Lasius neglectus was described in Hungary [19]. L.
neglectus is well adapted to cold winters and is currently
spreading quickly throughout Europe and Asia with 30
populations known in 2000 and 100 populations identified to date [20]. It has been estimated that the invasive
garden ant can survive mean winter temperatures down to
-5°C (see [21]), which indicates that it has not even come
close to reaching the limits of its potential distribution:
from Southern Sweden and Scotland in the West to China
and Japan in the East [21,22]. L. neglectus typically occurs
in human-disturbed urban habitats such as parks, greenhouses and gardens [19] and has so far not been found in
any natural habitat. Partly because of this, its native range

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/11

is not yet known, but the Black Sea area is the most likely
candidate [21].
Similar to other invasive ants [18,23], L. neglectus forms
large networks of interconnected and mutually tolerant
nests, each of which contains multiple queens [24]. This
'supercolonial' population structure differs from the
social organisation of native ant species, which typically
show high aggression against neighbouring nests [25].
Supercoloniality is an important factor contributing to the
ecological dominance of invasive ants as it allows very
high nest densities, which greatly benefits foraging efficiency [26]. In addition to this exploitation competition
advantage, invasive ants are often highly aggressive
towards native ants [27-29], and this is also true for L.
neglectus [30]. It is therefore not surprising that the invasive garden ant normally out-competes native ant species
and eliminates most other arthropods where it has been
introduced [31,32].
Invasive ants have generally lost the typical mating flights
that characterise most ants: they mate inside the nest and
found new colonies by nest-budding [18,23]. For long
distance dispersal, they rely on human mediated transport, which often occurs when soil and plant material is
moved from an infested site to another area. Newly
founded populations that share the same origin are thus
expected to be genetically similar and mutually nonaggressive, but genetic markers and aggression are not
necessarily tightly correlated with geographic distance
because human transport may often result in 'jump dispersal' over long distances [33]. Supercolonies of invasive
ants can therefore span mutually tolerant populations
that are geographically separated but all derived from the
same introduction. The largest supercolony to date has
been described for the Argentine ant in Southern Europe
and spans populations as far apart as 6000 km [34].
The geographic extension of invasive ant supercolonies
(either continuous or disjunctive) is widely used to reconstruct their invasion history [35] and represents an additional source of behavioural information not available in
studies of invasive species in general. Recognition and
aggression behaviour are based on the expression of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, which represent the recognition cues of social insects [34,36-38]. In this study, we
therefore combine genetic and behavioural analyses with
chemical analysis of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles to
estimate supercolony expansion of the invasive garden
ant. Our aim is to evaluate the efficiency of these three different approaches to detect supercolony boundaries and
to test whether they give consistent information for reconstructing the invasion history of L. neglectus in Europe. We
also try to obtain an estimate of how many independent
introductions from the native range might have occurred,

and how often new populations might have arisen from
already existing invasive populations. This type of information is pertinent in the development of efficient biocontrol strategies against the further spread of the invasive
garden ant.

Results
Size and range of supercolonies
Estimates from genetic analysis
As expected for unicolonial ant populations [25,39], the
study populations (Figure 1) were not genetically substructured at the nest level so that the five sampled nests
per population represent a random sample of the overall
genetic composition of the local supercolony (mean
regression relatedness, 0.015; 95% confidence interval, 0.028–0.057). We therefore used 30 individuals per population as independent samples when performing our
between-population analyses and did not consider the
nest level any further. The overall genetic differentiation
among populations (FST) was on average 0.334 (with pairwise estimates ranging from 0.249 to 0.431; 87 of the 91
pairwise estimates were significant; see Additional file 1).
The six studied microsatellite loci thus carry enough information to differentiate between populations in spite of
their moderate polymorphism. This result remains
unchanged and significant when omitting any of the six
loci. Phylogenetic analysis of the microsatellite data
revealed two clusters with two and three populations of
high genetic similarity (Figure 2). These were, first, two of
the three populations within Edirne, Turkey (Edirne 1 and
Edirne 3; bootstrap value 98%) and, second, the two populations in Hungary (Budapest and Debrecen) and the
population from Italy (Volterra; bootstrap value 91%).
Additional Bayesian clustering analysis supported these
two clusters and also grouped the populations in France

(Paris and Toulouse) and Belgium (Ghent; posterior
probability for this partitioning to be correct of over
99%). The genetic analysis therefore revealed three genetically different but internally similar clusters of populations, whereas six populations could not be consistently
clustered into genetic groups (overall FST between Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) clusters and
populations not assigned to clusters was 0.345; pairwise
values ranging from 0.108 to 0.551, all significant).
Estimates from chemical analysis
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of cuticular compounds produced a total of 24 different hydrocarbons, of which 23 were consistently found in
each population, and with the remaining single compound (peak 15*) only present in the population from
Warsaw, Poland (Figure 3a; for details see Additional file
2). Discriminant analysis based on the 8 factors extracted
from the 24 hydrocarbons in a principal component analysis (PCA; explaining 82% of the total variance) and using
population as a grouping variable, showed that the multiple nests analysed per population always clustered very
closely and that populations were distinct (Figure 3b;
Wilks' lambda: 0.00058; F104,334 = 6.27; P < 0.0001). The

100% posterior probability to be correctly assigned to this
particular population based on their chemical profiles. In
the remaining populations, correct assignments were in
the range 35–97%, with a total of 11 out of 68 nests misclassified; see Additional file 3 for details). To test whether
the considerable difference between Warsaw and the
other populations might have masked differences among
the remaining populations, we repeated the analysis without the Warsaw population. This lead to very similar posterior probabilities of nests being assigned to their
original populations in the range 33–94%, with only a
slightly higher proportion of nests (13/63) being misclassified.

bon peak 15* was considerably separated from all other
populations, so that all nests of this population had a

Estimates from analysis of aggression behaviour
Aggression never occurred within nests (n = 60) nor
between nests of the same population (n = 179), confirming our genetic results that populations consisted of single
supercolonies. In the between-population tests, aggression was detected in none of the replicates (mean 7) in
14% of the 91 independent pairwise combinations of
populations (total n = 579 tests), but always occurred in
19% of the combinations. The remaining 67% showed
aggression in some replicates, but not in others. However,
the variation between population pairs was significantly
higher than the variation between replicates (KruskalWallis: χ281 = 201; P < 0.0001). Based on these data, we
generated an 'aggression network' (Figure 4a), connecting
only those populations that were always non-aggressive
and thus were inferred to be part of the same supercolony
with black solid lines. This revealed one supercolony containing the two genetic clusters Belgium-France and Hungary-Italy, and another smaller one, including the Edirne
1+3 cluster. Despite this grouping, the boarders of these
behavioural supercolonies remained somewhat blurry, as,
for example, the populations in Budapest and Seva and
the populations of Seva and Volterra showed no mutual
aggression, yet ants from Budapest and Volterra did react
aggressively when encountering one another. It is therefore not possible to predict the outcome of encounters
between two populations based on their behaviour
towards a third party. Three populations were not part of
any behavioural supercolony: one of the Spanish populations (Bellaterra), the third population collected in
Edirne, Turkey (Edirne 2) and the Polish population in
Warsaw. In addition, we created a multidimensional scaling plot (Figure 4b) of the populations based on their
'behavioural distances' (that is, the aggression probabilities of pairwise population encounters; see Additional file
1 for details).
Correlations between geographic, genetic, chemical and
behavioural distance
Partial correlation analysis showed that the geographic
and genetic distances between the populations were not

significantly associated (Mantel test, rgeo,gen: P = 0.44), as
expected under a scenario of jump dispersal. Also, the
chemical distances between populations were not significantly correlated with geographic (Mantel test, rgeo,chem.gen:
P = 0.34) or genetic distances (Mantel test, rgen,chem.geo: P =
0.48). However, the behavioural distance between populations, that is, the pairwise aggression level, was significantly correlated with geographic (rgeo,behav.gen.chem =

0.296, P = 0.009), chemical (rchem,behav.gen.geo = 0.353, P =
0.003) and genetic distance between populations
(rgen,behav.chem.geo = 0.375, P = 0.001). As it turned out,
aggression was lower when populations were geographically closer, chemically more similar and genetically more
related (see Additional file 1 for plots).
Age and diversity of populations
The true age was unknown for most populations, so we
used 'year of discovery' as the best possible (minimal)
estimate. As all populations were assumed to have started
with a small founder group of a single or very few nests,
the present size of a population was also expected to be an
indicator of age and both were indeed highly correlated
(Pearson correlation, n = 14, r = -0.838, P = 0.0002; see
Table 1 for details). We determined the chemical variation
within populations (that is, the mean chemical distance
of nests to their group centroid; Table 1) and found that
the chemical variation was significantly negatively correlated with the discovery date of the populations (Pearson
correlation, n = 14, r = -0.513, P = 0.060) and positively
correlated with present population size (r = 0.688, P =
0.006). We found similar results for correlations of the
allelic richness for each population based on the microsatellite analysis, with both year of detection (Figure 5;
Pearson correlation, n = 14, r = -0.600, P = 0.023) and
population size (r = 0.632, P = 0.0154), as well as a high
correlation between allelic richness and chemical withinpopulation variation (r = 0.745, P = 0.002). Also, the
number of polymorphic loci (out of the six studied; Table
2) was typically low in the youngest populations, discovered after 1995 (Table 1). Genetic bottlenecks were
detected in three populations (Bayramiç, Edirne 3, Jena;
Table 1) when using the software M RATIO, but the software BOTTLENECK did not detect any recent decrease in
effective population size. Investigating the allelic distributions among populations within the same genetic cluster
showed that the smaller Edirne 3 population only contained a fraction of the alleles found in the larger Edirne 1
population (except for two rare alleles, 272 and 292, in
L10–174 that were only found in Edirne 3; see Table 3).
Likewise the alleles present in the smaller populations in
Debrecen and Volterra were subsets of the alleles in the
larger Budapest population (with the exception of one
rare allele, 284, found in Volterra in L10–174). Similarly,
the alleles in the small Toulouse population were a subset
of the larger population in Paris (except for two rare alleles, 240 and 274, in L10–174 found in Toulouse). This led
us to draw a likely scenario for the history of introductions
of the European populations of L. neglectus as shown in
Figure 5.

and behavioural data allowed us to evaluate the relative

suitability of these different methods, and to (at least in
part) reconstruct the likely introduction history of L.
neglectus in Europe. First of all, we could not detect any
aggression between nests of the same population, or any
genetic substructure within populations, confirming that
our study populations represented single supercolonies.
When performing between-population analyses, the phylogenetic tree of the 14 L. neglectus populations revealed
two clades supported with high bootstrap values, but otherwise remained relatively unresolved despite high variation in the microsatellite loci. This indicates that most
introduced populations of L. neglectus in Europe are likely
of rather recent date and of fairly similar origin. The Bayesian clustering analysis confirmed the two well-supported
clades from the microsatellite tree, and detected a third
cluster of populations. Together, the genetic data therefore
indicate that the populations within these three clusters
Belgium-France, Hungary-Italy and Edirne 1+3 share a
recent common introduction history.
The chemical analysis separated the population in Warsaw, Poland, from all other populations, a split that was
not detected by genetic analysis, but that was confirmed
by aggression data (see below). All other populations
showed high similarities in their chemical profile, consist-

ent with a possible joint origin or with similar environmental conditions. A comparable degree of chemical
uniformity was found by Errard et al. [40] when analysing
introduced populations of the invasive ant Wasmannia
auropunctata in the New Caledonia archipelago.
Overall aggression levels between L. neglectus populations
were very low in our laboratory experiments, which is
consistent with the generally high similarities in the
genetic and chemical analyses. Remarkably, the observed
aggression patterns could be predicted by the genetic and
chemical distances between the populations, as well as by
their geographic distance. Although Mantel tests do not
directly allow testing of the proportions of variance
explained by the different predictor variables, the partial
correlation coefficients suggest that genetic distance was
the best predictor of aggression, followed by chemical and
geographic distances. This is in line with other studies
showing that aggression is based on chemical recognition
cues encoded in the ants' hydrocarbon profiles [36,41]
and suggests that these hydrocarbon profiles have a significant genetic component [42-44]. However, considerable
amounts of variation in aggression remained unexplained
by the overall genetic distance at the microsatellite marker
loci, suggesting that environmental conditions in the hab-

itat and food also likely affected the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles.
Although other invasive ants typically have populations
that show a clear affiliation to a specific supercolony
[34,40,45], no such clear association could be found in L.
neglectus. Only three populations, Bellaterra, Edirne 2 and
Warsaw, performed aggression in all replicates towards all
other populations (Figure 4). As L. neglectus shows
extremely high aggression in inter-specific aggression tests
performed under the same laboratory conditions [30], we
assume that our data reflect the natural situation and are
not a laboratory artefact.
Similar to other invasive ants [18,46,47] and invasive species in general [48,49], there was no pattern of 'isolation
by distance', that is, a positive correlation between genetic

and geographic distances among populations. Given the
limited dispersal of L. neglectus queens, this suggests that
jump dispersal via human mediated transport is very
likely. This was also suggested by earlier studies on L.
neglectus linking the local appearance of new populations
to the introduction of, for example, potted plants
[19,32,50], and is complementary to our findings on
regional and continental expansion patterns in L. neglectus
[19]. Some invasion 'hotspots' could be found in several
regions, such as the surroundings of Barcelona and within
Budapest, Edirne and Warsaw (N Aktaç, personal communication; see also [[19,20,32,51,52]]). These likely arise
because of frequent human transport of ant-infested potted plants or soil between nearby construction sites within
regions. However, no a priori general inferences could be
made on the supercolony affiliation of geographically
close populations. Two of the three populations in Edirne,

Turkey, were extremely similar, whereas the third was different, and the same was true for the two sites studied in
the surroundings of Barcelona, Spain.
It was unexpected that so few populations showed detectable signs of a recent genetic bottleneck, as introduced
populations in general show low levels of genetic diversity
[15], which is the most powerful method in detecting
genetic bottlenecks [53]. However, as this method
requires data from native populations in equilibrium as a
comparison, which are not available for L. neglectus, we
chose two software packages that do not require this, but
instead rely on polymorphic loci only. The applied methods (M-ratio and heterozygosity excess) were recently
evaluated by Williamson-Natesan [54], who concluded
that the M-ratio was most likely to detect bottlenecks
when they lasted for several generations, when the population had recovered and when the pre-bottleneck population sizes (θ) were large. The heterozygosity excess
method, on the other hand, was better at detecting bottlenecks when they were recent, less severe and when prebottleneck population sizes were small. The low number
of detected bottlenecks in the present study could be an
artefact of our analysis as many of the young populations
of the invasive garden ant, however, have few polymorphic loci, which in itself is an independent indication of
genetic bottlenecks, but it compromises the detection
power of these programs [55]. It is therefore likely that the
sensitivity of these methods was not sufficient, and that
more populations have gone through a recent genetic bottleneck than the three that we could detect. Alternatively,
we see the same pattern as in the study by Clegg et al [16]
on silvereye birds colonising islands. They found that a
single colonisation event was not followed by severe
founder effects, but four to five successive colonisation
events were required.
In addition to these well-known and broadly applied
methods to detect founder effects based on microsatellite
data, we have (as far as we are aware for the first time)
tested the suitability of the within-population variation of
cuticular hydrocarbons. We found that this chemical variation behaves in a very similar manner to allelic richness
and, at least in our study, similarly correlates with both
the age and size of populations. Our data showed that the
younger populations of L. neglectus are characterised by
the lowest chemical variation and genetic diversity in
terms of allelic richness (strongest evidence), the number
of polymorphic loci and also the detection of genetic bottlenecks. These data and the considerable similarity
between introduced populations make a high number of
independent introductions from the native range
unlikely. As the founder populations of all extant invasive
populations were apparently rather similar, the patterns
observed are best explained by assuming that younger

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/11

populations tend to arise as daughter populations from
older introduced populations, consistent with the allelic
subset pattern discussed above. This implies that L. neglectus experienced serial genetic bottlenecks, which explains
the low genetic diversity of young infestations compared
with older invasive populations. The higher genetic diversity in the older populations is unlikely to be a result of
accumulation of mutations after population founding, as
the differences in age are only a few decades. The total evidence available thus allowed us to tentatively infer the
most likely chains of ancestry across the investigated 14
populations (Figure 5) as a working hypothesis for further
research on the invasion history of L. neglectus in Europe.
The prevailing pattern is that secondary infestations both
have a later discovery date and a smaller population size.

Conclusion
To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study
to simultaneously implement genetic, chemical and
behavioural methodology to assess the affiliation of populations of invasive ants to supercolonies, as similar studies mostly rely on aggression behaviour and genetic
analyses. We found that the three approaches revealed
consistent but also complementary data and that both
genetic and chemical variation within populations can be
used as a powerful tool for the detection of founder
effects. Still, microsatellites seem to be a more powerful
tool to reconstruct introduction histories, as they moreover reveal the possible direction of spread (Figure 5). The
cheapest and easiest of the three methods, behavioural
observation of aggression, which can also be performed
quickly in the field, was also quite informative, given that
we and other studies showed that aggression levels
between populations depend on the chemical profiles,
which themselves are genetically based [35].
Our complementary approach revealed that all extant
European populations of the invasive garden ant are probably derived from very few independent introductions out
of the hitherto unknown native species range. Even if we
do not yet know where the native populations of this new
pest ant can be found, the development of highly variable
microsatellite markers and the genetic 'barcode' of the
introduced sites that we have obtained in this study will
allow potential candidates for the native population from
which introductions into Europe have occurred to be
tested quickly. Our data indicate that most of the younger
introductions of L. neglectus have likely arisen from other
already established invasive populations. This implies
that many more infestations of the invasive garden ant are
likely to have taken place already, but have remained
undiscovered owing to the usual lag phase for invasive
species [3]. Many of these small and not yet well-established populations will likely have escaped notice because
their negative effects on native communities are not cur-

rently apparent. However, recent decades have shown that
established populations of L. neglectus do expand very fast
[19,20,50] and are nearly impossible to eliminate [56].
We hope that our present study will contribute to the
establishment of greater awareness to this pest ant, so that
new infestations can be exterminated before they become
damaging [57].

Methods
Study populations
L. neglectus was collected from 14 populations (Figure 1),
representing a well-balanced subset of localities from the
European distribution range of this species: Belgium
(Ghent), France (Paris, Toulouse), Germany (Jena), Hungary (Budapest, Debrecen), Italy (Volterra), Poland (Warsaw), Spain (Bellaterra, Seva; both in the Barcelona area)
and Turkey (Bayramiç, three separated populations in
Edirne: 1, Sanayi Sitesi; 2, Selimiye Mosque; 3, Muammer
Aksoy Caddesi). For each population, live workers from at
least five randomly selected nests (minimum distance 20
m) were collected in 2003. Population boundaries were
determined by mapping the presence of foraging workers
on trees and shrubs. Sharp transitions were (almost)
always found and were marked by GPS. These GPS measurements allowed us to estimate the approximate area in
square kilometres for each population. Information about
the year of discovery for each population was obtained
from [20,31].
Genetic analysis
DNA extraction and microsatellite polymerase chain reaction
DNA was extracted from 30 workers (5 nests and 6 workers/nest) per population, that is, from a total of 420 individuals. From each individual, the mesosoma was crushed
in 200 μl of a 5% Chelex solution and boiled at 99°C for
15 min. For each sample six polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci were amplified, three of them originally developed for L. niger [58], and three newly developed for L.
neglectus (Table 2). The number of individuals that amplified at each locus ranged from 402 to 417. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) conditions were as follows: initial
denaturation 5 min at 95°C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30
s at the locus specific annealing temperature of 55/62°C,
60 s at 72°C; final elongation of 60 min at 72°C; reaction
volume 20 μl; primer concentration 10 μM; Hybaid PCR
Express Thermal Cycler. PCR products were run on 5%
polyacrylamide gels using an ABI 377 automated
sequencer with internal size standard (Rox500) and were
analysed with GENESCAN 3.1 and GENOTYPER 3.1
(Applied Biosystems). Cross-amplification of all loci was
tested for L. alienus, L. austriacus, L. niger, L. turcicus and L.
sakagamii. All loci amplified under the same conditions as
for L. neglectus, except in L. austriacus where locus Lng1 did
not reliably amplify. Furthermore, all loci were found to
be polymorphic in all tested species (although for L. niger

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/11

this information does not exist for the three newly developed loci).
Genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships
The genetic relationship between nestmate workers was
assessed by measuring intra-nest regression relatedness
using RELATEDNESS v. 5.0.8 [59] in all but the two populations in Spain (from which only a single nest had been
sampled). Nests were weighted equally in this analysis.
Allelic richness within populations (k') and pairwise
genetic distances between populations (FST) were calculated in FSTAT 2.9.3.2 [60] using 2000 permutations. A
phylogram was created based on a distance matrix of
allele frequency data (following the 'additive tree model')
obtained from the six microsatellite loci using PHYLIP 3.6
[61]. Genetic distances for constructing the phylogram
were calculated using Cavalli-Sforza chord measures, and
bootstrap values were obtained by 2000 permutations. In
addition, the Bayesian clustering program BAPS 2.0 [62]
was used to group populations in clusters according to
overall genetic similarity. We used populations without
any sub-level as the level of sampling in these analyses.
Estimations were performed across 50,000 iterations with
'thinning = 3' and a burn-in period of 10,000. The executed P-values give the probability of specific populations
separating into one or more clusters of populations.
Detection of genetic bottlenecks
The populations were tested for the occurrence of genetic
bottlenecks using both M RATIO [63] and BOTTLENECK
1.2.02 [55,64]. These two programs were chosen as they
detect genetic bottlenecks without requiring a native reference population, which is unknown in L. neglectus. The
two programs differ in that M RATIO is more likely to
detect older bottleneck events than BOTTLENECK. M
RATIO exploits the fact that allele distributions tend to
shift after a genetic bottleneck and that the number of alleles is expected to decline faster than the overall range size
of alleles. The program thus compares the ratio M (the
number of alleles divided by the allele size range) to a distribution obtained by simulating 10,000 runs of a population at equilibrium. Based on earlier estimates of the
effective population size ne of a L. neglectus population
[24,65] and after comparing the size of this population
with our data, we set ne = 5000. The mutation rate was set
at μ = 10-4/locus/generation, which is the commonly used
mutation rate for microsatellite loci in ants [66,67], resulting in a parameter setting of θ = 4ne*μ = 2. BOTTLENECK,
on the other hand, detects divergences from allelic equilibrium in populations that have undergone a recent
decrease in effective population size through estimating
across 1000 permutations: (1) any reduction in genetic
diversity, that is, a lower number of alleles than expected;
and (2) any excess of heterozygosity per locus compared
with an equilibrium population. In both software pack-

ages the two-phased model (TPM) was chosen as it provided the best fit for the evolution of microsatellite
markers [55].
Chemical analysis
Sampling and extraction
The cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of 68 nest samples
from the 14 populations (3–7, mean 4.9 ± 1.1 nests per
population) were analysed. Immediately after transportation of the live ants to the laboratory, five ants per nest
were placed together in glass vials (Supelco; 1.8 ml), and
stored at -20°C until solvent extraction. To extract cuticular compounds from the ants, pentane (50 μl) was added
after the individuals had been transferred into small glass
inserts (200 μl). After 10 min (during which the vials were
vortexed three times) the ants were removed from the
pentane and discarded. The vials were left open at room
temperature until all of the pentane had evaporated. The
dry extracts were kept frozen (-20°C) until they were analysed using GC-MS.
GC-MS
Shortly before GC-MS analysis, the samples were rediluted in 20 μl of hexane. We injected 2 μl of each extract
(split-less and via an auto-sampler) onto the GC-MS (Agilent Technologies 6890N coupled to a 5973N MSD)
equipped with a HP-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm
film thickness). The initial oven temperature was set at
70°C. After 1 min the oven temperature was increased to
280°C at 20°C/min, after which it was increased further
to 340°C at 2°C/min, and kept at this temperature for
another 5 min. Other machine settings and characterisation of compounds followed the methods described by
Lommelen et al [68].
Analysis and choice of compounds
Cuticular hydrocarbons (alkanes and mono-, di- and trimethyl alkanes) were characterised using standard MS
databases and diagnostic ions and by determining Kovats
indices [69]. The position of double bonds in the alkenes
was determined by derivatisation with di-methyl disulfide
[70]. The methyl position in the methyl branched alkenes
was first determined via a hydrogenation reaction with
hydrogen and a palladium catalyst. The extracts contained
both hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons (ketones,
aldehydes and alcohols), but in the statistical analysis
only the hydrocarbons were used, because other substances could be pheromones (e.g. alarm substances)
rather than compounds used for nestmate recognition.
For the same reason, n-undecane (C11), which occurred
in some extracts, was excluded from the analysis, since it
has been reported as an alarm substance from Dufour
glands in two other Lasius species [71]. The final data set
consisted of 24 remaining hydrocarbons, which varied in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/11

chain length between C31 and C35 (see Figure 3a and
Additional file 2 for details).
Statistical hydrocarbon analysis
For all 68 nest samples, the area below each peak was integrated (CHEMSTATION, Agilent Technologies) and the
relative proportions of the 24 hydrocarbon peaks were
analysed using PCA in STATISTICA 6 (Statsoft) as in
D'Ettorre and Heinze [72] revealing eight factors with
eigenvalues over 0.7 explaining 82% of the total variance.
A discriminant analysis based on these PCA factor scores
was run with the 14 populations as a grouping variable.
Mahalanobis distances between all pairwise populations
were calculated as estimates for the chemical distances
between populations (see Additional file 1). Mean Mahalanobis distances of all nests per population to the respective population mean (group centroid) were also
calculated as an estimate for the within-population variation in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. For each nest, the
posterior probability of this nest to be correctly assigned
to its original population from where it was sampled was
determined. Nests were classified as mismatches in cases
where the posterior probability was higher for an alternative population than the population it was sampled in
(see Additional file 3).
Behavioural assays
Within the first five weeks after the ants had been collected from the field, aggression tests were carried out in
the laboratory between pairs of workers. To test whether
single populations consisted of single supercolonies, the
five sampled nests were tested in all pairwise combinations (one replicate each; for all but the two Spanish populations from which only a single nest could be sampled;
total number of within-population between-nest aggression tests: n = 179). In addition, within-nest aggression
tests were performed with two workers collected from
identical nests (one replicate for each nest, that is, total n
= 60). Aggression was never observed between any nests
within the same population. We therefore chose one nest
per population at random, with which we performed
between-population tests. The 14 populations allowed for
91 independent pairwise combinations and each was
tested in 7 replicates on average (range 3–12). As the
Edirne 3 population behaved identically to the Edirne 1
population in all test trials we did not perform all replicates for Edirne 3. Taken together, a total of 579 aggression tests were carried out.

Five minutes before each aggression test, individual ants
were removed from their rearing boxes and placed in individual plastic vials (diameter 2 cm, height 5 cm; fluon
coated sides). The ants were then put into an 'arena' (Petri
dish, 5.5 cm diameter; preliminary tests revealed that the
outcome of any fight was independent of the order of

putting the ants into the dish), and observed for 10 min at
an ambient temperature of 22.5 ± 2°C following Giraud
et al [34]. The frequency of six behaviours was recorded:
ignorance behaviour (no interactive behaviour expressed
when the two ants meet), antennation (one or both ants
touch the other with their antennae), avoidance behaviour (one or both ants flee), gaster raising (aggressive
behaviour often linked to the spraying of formic acid), biting and escalated fight. Encounters were classified as 'nonaggressive' when only ignorance and antennation behaviour occurred and as 'aggressive' when gaster raising, biting or fighting took place. The proportion of aggressive
replicates per population pair was calculated as the
number of aggressive replicates on the total number of
replicates, revealing the behavioural distance between
populations. In 1% of the encounters (7/579) only avoidance behaviour occurred in addition to ignorance and/or
antennation. These encounters were excluded from the
analysis as they could not be clearly assigned to either the
aggressive or non-aggressive category.

between sampled populations of L. neglectus, using the six microsatellite
loci (Table 2). Bold figures indicate significance after multiple comparisons, P < 0.05. Order of populations after geography as in Figure 4. (b)
Pairwise chemical (Mahalanobis) distances based on discriminant analysis of the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles between the sampled L. neglectus
populations (see Figure 3 and Additional file 2). (c) Pairwise behavioural
distance (aggression probabilities) between the sampled L. neglectus populations (Figure 4). (d) Pairwise geographic distances (in kilometres)
between the study populations of L. neglectus (Figure 1). (e) Partial correlations between genetic, chemical, behavioural and geographic distance
between the L. neglectus populations. Correlation coefficients (rx,y.z) are
given for each plot. Mantel tests showed that correlation coefficients were
only significant for behavioural distance versus geographic, genetic and
chemical distance.

Correlations between geography, genetics, chemistry and
behaviour
Partial Mantel correlation tests using distance matrices
from inter-population geographic (in kilometres), genetic
(as pairwise FST), chemical (as Mahalanobis distances
received from the discriminant analysis) and behavioural
distance (as proportion of aggressive interactions) were
carried out in FSTAT 2.9.3.2 using 2000 randomisations.
Two-tailed P-values are reported.

Cuticular hydrocarbon compounds of L. neglectus. Peak number (see
profile Figure 3(a)), short and full name of the 24 cuticular hydrocarbon
compounds in the profile of L. neglectus.

Additional file 3
Correct and incorrect posterior assignment of nests to their population
based on cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Posterior probabilities of each
nest to be assigned to its original population in which it was sampled based
on the chemical hydrocarbon profile. For cases in which posterior probabilities were higher for another population (bold), this posterior probability, as well as the identification of the other population, is given.

Authors' contributions
Ant populations were sampled by SC, JSP and LVU. Microsatellite primers were newly developed by DJCK and
data were obtained by LVU. Cuticular hydrocarbon analyses were performed by FPD and SC. Aggression tests were
carried out by SC and LVU. The study was designed by SC,
JSP and JJB, the paper was written by these authors and
LVU. All authors read and approved the manuscript.
