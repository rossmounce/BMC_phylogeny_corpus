Abstract
Background: In the contexts of genomics, post-genomics and systems biology approaches, data integration
presents a major concern. Databases provide crucial solutions: they store, organize and allow information to be
queried, they enhance the visibility of newly produced data by comparing them with previously published results,
and facilitate the exploration and development of both existing hypotheses and new ideas.
Results: The FLAGdb++ information system was developed with the aim of using whole plant genomes as physical
references in order to gather and merge available genomic data from in silico or experimental approaches.
Available through a JAVA application, original interfaces and tools assist the functional study of plant genes by
considering them in their specific context: chromosome, gene family, orthology group, co-expression cluster and
functional network. FLAGdb++ is mainly dedicated to the exploration of large gene groups in order to decipher
functional connections, to highlight shared or specific structural or functional features, and to facilitate translational
tasks between plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera).
Conclusion: Combining original data with the output of experts and graphical displays that differ from classical
plant genome browsers, FLAGdb++ presents a powerful complementary tool for exploring plant genomes and
exploiting structural and functional resources, without the need for computer programming knowledge. First
launched in 2002, a 15th version of FLAGdb++ is now available and comprises four model plant genomes and over
eight million genomic features.

Background
Holistic approaches require the organization of data and
metadata in order to allow the hypothesis-driven querying of heterogeneous objects. In many systems biology
considerations, data management and integrative
approaches are identified as key to the thorough exploitation of omics data and their translation into knowledge
[1]. Many biologists that would like to take advantage of
the rapid increase in the number and size of sequenced
genomes do not have the skills required to derive function from sequence or vice versa. They encounter a
major problem, i.e. connecting heterogeneous pieces of

information quickly and accurately in the absence of a
methodological approach to organizing them efficiently.
Indeed, huge quantities of data are stored and managed
by different databases, but linking this information is
highly complex [2]. This is particularly true when users
with no computer programming skills wish to retrieve a
large set of information from a list of tens or hundreds of
genes, a frequent case nowadays since the advent of different omics approaches. For instance, a transcriptomics
experiment yields large lists of differentially expressed
genes dependent on two alternative conditions and
researchers need to know as much information as possible about them in order to progress to the next step in a
hypothesis-driven process. The same applies to proteomics or interactomics approaches. Thus, it helps greatly
to use a tool that quickens this task whilst providing
highly accurate results. FLAGdb++ is designed to be such
a tool, efficiently navigating in and between plant model

genomes in order to analyze large sets of genes. The
main design criteria included (i) using a common information system for all genomes within a unified interface,
(ii) providing reliable data by combining and re-analyzing
raw data derived from different sources, i.e. ridding users
of format heterogeneity problems, (iii) considering data
in various contexts such as chromosomal location, or
gene family or orthology group membership, (iv) providing access to original data through collaboration with
data producers, and (v) facilitating the formulation and
testing of hypotheses based on links between gene structure and function. In order to satisfy these criteria, the
choice was made to develop a data warehouse connected
to original interfaces and capable of helping build
hypotheses based on a number of interactive graphical
displays. Deciphering the functional relevance of a gene
cluster and inferring hypothesis from common characteristics are both complex processes involving multiple
information sources, steps and queries which may not
necessarily be fully predictable at the start. In FLAGdb++,
the graphical displays are centered on highly connected
map-like representations, intended to act together as
mnemonics to guide hypothesis establishment progression. When initially launched in 2002 FLAGdb++ focused
solely on the Arabidopsis thaliana genome [3], but has
now expanded to incorporate other plant genomes and is
involved in an increasing number of genomic projects.
Due to close collaboration with biologists, data producers
and experts in genomic resources, the development and
improvements made to FLAGdb++ allow the clear presentation of original data, thanks to an intuitive graphical
tool box. Beyond the adding of novel data types and
cross-references, the new functionalities allow the users
to compare gene structures and promoters, and to navigate into gene classification, segmental duplications, feature density curves, phylogenetic profiles and orthology
groups. Finally, FLAGdb ++ efficiently completes other
plant genome databases and browsers [4-7].

Construction and content
Architecture

FLAGdb++ is based on a client-server model. The n-tier
architecture is composed of a relational database (under
RDBMS PostgreSQL) and a client application, implemented in JAVA (JDK 1.6), and contains the application
server and user interfaces. Communication with the
database relies on the JDBC driver. The client application has to be locally installed by the users in order to
query the FLAGdb ++ database through the graphical
interfaces. The JAVA WEB START technology is used
to facilitate and automate the installation and updates of
the application. The JAVA solution has been selected
for its compatibility with all operating systems (JAVA
Runtime Environment is now available by default on

Page 2 of 10

almost all computers) and to enhance the possibilities of
development around the user-side application. Concerning the database, the schema has been designed to scale
well with very large quantities of diverse data, allowing
the connection of features and information not only
around genomic loci, but also around biological functions or gene families. Thus, this architecture proves a
good compromise between performance, scalability and
development issues.
Data

FLAGdb++ has been developed in a generic way in order
to be applied to different genomes. Therefore, it is able
to store, organize, explore and analyze numerous types
of genomic resources (called features). Data integration
is based on mapping to genomic sequences using the
genomic coordinates as an index system. The database
schema and interfaces consider different types of data
along with their origin, quality and biological relevance,
and the diversity of possible queries in order to access
and analyze them.
In addition to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome
(Columbia 0, [8]) FLAGdb++ now contains the genomes
of Oryza sativa (spp japonica cv. Nipponbare [9]), Populus trichocarpa (Nisqually-1 clone [10]) and Vitis vinifera (PN40024, 12x assembly [11]). These four complete
plant genomes, representing four distinct angiosperm
taxa in the plant kingdom, are stored in the same database instance and can be queried using the same tools
within the FLAGdb++ application.
Beyond the basic genome-wide annotation of CDS,
FLAGdb++ aims to merge different genomic resources in
order to improve the structural and functional annotation of genomes. These resources derive from several
origins: general or specific databases, internal and collaborative projects, experimental high-throughput
approaches, manual biocuration or in silico prediction
works (Table 1). The diversity and quality of features
and annotations vary between species due to unequal
community sizes and the time elapsed since the end of
the sequencing project. The integration task involves
several steps of selection, expertise and possible enrichment through data post-processing, filtering (with quality cut-off) and additional predictions. For example, with
the aim of having an homogeneous overview, the functional annotation of all protein-coding genes (from the
four genomes) has been completed by (i) the prediction
of targeting signals by a unique pipeline combining Predotar [12], WoLF PSORT [13] and CBS tools [14] and
(ii) the definition of phylogenetic profiles based on the
presence or absence of homologs in 11 different phyla.
For Arabidopsis, secondary and 3 D structures have
been predicted from primary protein sequences and
local similarities in PDB proteins [15,16] with such

results constituting an original resource for functional
insights and being complementary to another similar
initiative based on different method [17]. Also concerned with data improvement, which is of central

interest to FLAGdb++, all the transcript sequences available in GenBank/dbEST are consistently mapped on and
spliced-aligned against integrated genomes. Results are
then exploited to redefine the 5’ and 3’ UTR extremities

of each transcriptional unit. The deduced new transcription start sites allow for better definition of promoter
regions and further help to characterize motifs of biological relevance [18]. Indeed, FLAGdb++ is more than a
collection of data since the genomic resources are carefully selected, verified, improved, completed and finally
integrated in order to increase both their complementarity and biological content. FLAGdb++ constitutes a
significant step in transforming data into knowledge.
For both Arabidopsis and the grapevine, we have completed the structural annotation of the genomes using
an additional genome-wide prediction of CDS via the
predictor-combiner software EuGène [19]. The relevance
of hundreds of genes previously only predicted by
EuGène has now been ascertained using transcriptomic
and sequencing data [20] and they are now recognised
by TAIR [21]. For Vitis vinifera also, previous manual
annotation of gene families validates the complementary
contribution of EuGène in the structural annotation of
the genome [22]. This illustrates one of the roles that a
specific intermediate database such as FLAGdb++ may
play in providing access to original new resources to the
community for their deep analyses and expertises before
release, after validation, into renowned large
repositories.
The EuGène results have also been used, in a complementary manner to AGI annotation work, to design the
probes for different versions of the CATMA micro-array
[23,24]. Beside Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips, CATMA
micro-arrays provide a significant amount of transcriptome data covering a large spectrum of physiological
conditions and mutants [25]. FLAGdb ++ is used as a
repository for different kinds of CATMA probes, i.e.
gene-specific and gene-family tags, as well as for primers
tagging predicted smallRNA precursors. FLAGdb++ provides access to probe specificities, to primer sequences
and to updates of their relationships with gene annotation. The management of Arabidopsis micro-array
probes has been extended to other transcriptomic
resources. Indeed, FLAGdb++ also integrates the oligonucleotide sets of the Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip, the
probes of two tiling-arrays of different resolutions [26]
and the PCR probes of the promoter-dedicated array
SAP [27]. The support for these resources allows us to
(i) manage the dynamic relationships between microarray probes and gene annotation, thus facilitating the
biological interpretation of differentially expressed gene
lists, and (ii) propose interactive links to transcriptomic
databases and tools, i.e. Genevestigator [28], eFP Browser [29] and CATdb [30].
Gene classification is another major topic in FLAGdb+
+
. The different Gene Ontology categories [31] and the
detection of conserved protein motifs using the HMM
profiles available in PFAM [32] are used to define

Page 4 of 10

connections between genes in the four genomes.
Furthermore, the integration of expert manual annotation on a selection of gene families provides original
information about their organisation, structure and
function [33]. For instance, the large pentatricopeptide
repeat (PPR) family, involved in the maturation of mitochondrial and plastidial transcripts, has been characterized in detail. This involves 451 Arabidopsis and 477
rice genes, and includes the checking, and correction, of
intron-exon structures as well as the organization of the
six protein motifs, the complexity of which is a particularity of the family [34,35]. The FLAGdb++ database also
contains the location and classification of all the Arabidopsis genes that encode transcription factors, comprising 2,182 genes distributed among 75 distinct families.
Similarly, we have integrated 31,876 transposable elements (mainly relics) annotated using a semi-automatic
method based on established reference sets [36] and
classified within 327 subfamilies.
Beyond the integration of data, FLAGdb++ also provides cross references and web links to external
resources and tools (Table 2). With a selection of more
than 20 complementary databases, FLAGdb++ constitutes a structuring portal, helping users to build their
functional analysis and data mining approaches.

Utility and discussion
The main view displayed in FLAGdb++ is of different
features spanning the chromosome sequence of the
selected species. Each data type is situated on a track
with a specific graphical object and colour code. This is
a classical representation mode for many genome browsers, however the FLAGdb++ application offers marked
differences. For example, an original multi-lined display
has been preferred in order to display a large genomic
environment in a single view, whilst maintaining an
important level of detail (Figure 1) thus allowing access
to numerous genes without losing information. This
multi-lined solution avoids continual zooming in and
out or scrolling actions and therefore makes it easier to
study gene organization along chromosomes, such as
large gene clusters for instance. Furthermore, FLAGdb++
includes a dual-component interface with an interactive
genome-wide view displaying additional information and
facilitating access to specific loci (Figure 1) thereby making the detection of localisation bias or syntenic regions
straightforward. The chromosomal view allows users to
visualize and memorize the topological organisation of
repeated sequences, members of gene families, blast
results or any other features.
The FLAGdb++ interface system simplifies the navigation from genomic sequences to final protein products
through the spliced alignments of transcripts, promoter
regions, tagged mutations and protein motifs. Also,

The cross-references with complementary databases are proposed to the users in the ‘Link to...’ pop-up menus associated with the concerned features.

predicted models of 3 D protein structures are viewable
courtesy of to the embedded KiNG software [37]. The
display of additional feature tracks is controlled by the
user via the ‘Feature manager’ tool, avoiding data overload which may cloud their biological interpretation.
Clicking on any item reveals pop-up windows showing
additional data such as functional annotations, prediction and quality scores, or sources.
Aside the ability to access loci through classical
queries (such as gene IDs, keywords, sequence similarities, or genomic coordinates), FLAGdb++ also provides
tools for exploring the integrated genomes by groups of
genes: genes belonging to the same family or to the
same GO classification group [31] can be retrieved in a
batch with a few clicks of the mouse. Specific interfaces
have been developed to allow the selection of a transcription factor or repeat element subfamilies, and also
filter GO groups using their evidence code, mirroring
the quality and origin of the classification. All these
batch queries lead users to synthetic and interactive
tables concentrating information on the gene lists: number of cognate transcripts (EST, cDNA, MPSS), presence
of T-DNA or transposon mutant lines, phylogenetic
profile, functional annotation, subcellular localization,
GO terms, PFAM motifs and micro-array probes (Figure
2a). The content of the table of results can be defined
by the user and exported in a tabulated text file format.

Furthermore, the tables provide a tool for extracting
sequences in batches (FASTA format) comprising CDSs,
complete genes, proteins or regulator 5’ regions defined
from the first ATG or the transcription start site. For
instance, in order to look for over-represented DNA
motifs, which are good candidates for common transcription factor binding sites, such a tool is very useful
for retrieving all the promoter sequences from a list of
co-expressed genes resulting from a transcriptomic
assay. Similarly, for in-depth phylogeny study, all the
protein sequences of a gene family are retrievable in a
few clicks of the mouse. The tool ‘compare gene structures and promoters’ graphically displays the structural
annotation of a list of genes (Figure 2b), thus facilitating
the analysis and characterization of gene families as the
user can visually and quickly detect different gene structures within a large group of paralogs, highlighting a
possible subfamily, an interesting divergent member or
putative erroneous annotations.
A recently added tool dedicated to the orthology relationships makes cross-linking between the integrated genomes possible, a particularly powerful feature when
inferring function and making comparative analyses. To
control whether the BLAST best hits are reciprocal, all
against all BLASTP comparisons are graphically represented for a selected gene (Figure 3). Intron-exon structures of candidate orthologous genes are also available for

resources. (b) ‘Zoom in’ upon selection of a specific feature opens a new window displaying additional data (according to the user setting selected

to detect eventual erroneous annotation or alternative splicing events, as illustrated in this example.

comparison as well as the detection of erroneous annotation. A global protein alignment can be run by launching a
Clustal process, whereas the presence of conserved cis-acting regulatory motifs can be tested in the context of a phylogenetic footprinting approach. Numerous other tools are

available in the FLAGdb++ application allowing the user to

of features or motifs along the chromosomes, (iii) extract
sequences or annotations (GFF, EMBL or GenBank

browser window and provide cross-links and tools in order to download the data, retrieve sequences (genes, CDS, proteins, promoters relative to
ATG or TSS), and to display gene structures (see 2b). Here, the example concerns the bHLH transcription factor family in Vitis vinifera. The table
presents for each gene, its chromosome, its phylogenetic profile through different phyla (color legend is explained in the pop-up window), the

are available in the pop-up text), and the functional annotation inferred from sequence similarities. (b) A button opens a tool dedicated to gene

genes in the four integrated species in order to assist the prediction of orthology relationships. The results of all the reciprocal best BLASTP hits
(RBH) are displayed together graphically, along with the global protein alignment and intron-exon structures of the genes concerned. In this
way, gene structure can also be considered in the prediction of orthologs and eventual erroneous structural annotation (such as gene merging),
which render the RBH approach futile, can be easily detected and removed. In this example, all the BLASTP best hits are reciprocal between all

each session, and each graphical object (feature) can be

laboratory books or manuscripts.
We acknowledge the various skill profiles of FLAGdb+
+
users; they are either biologists or bioinformaticians
whishing to address different queries using the database.
Some are interested in gene-by-gene or high-throughput
approaches, looking for either mutants in their target
gene(s) or shared functional characteristics in large coexpressed gene sets. Others are focused on either gene
families or large genomic segments for evolution and
functional analyses. Since its first release eight years ago,
we now have concrete proof of the usefulness of
FLAGdb++, as it is reflected by its citation in numerous
publications (see the website [38]).

Conclusion
Through a user friendly application, FLAGdb ++ offers
plant biologists access to a rich array of original
genomic resources. JAVA interfaces, combined with
intrinsic tools and four annotated complete plant

genomes considerably help users to build hypotheses
in their translational research or in comparative genomics approaches. Development and integration tasks
are directed at highlighting biological correlations
between data and speeding up the analyses of groups
of genes in a wide range of contexts including genomic regions, gene families or gene function.
We have not described in this paper all the tools and
types of display available in FLAGdb++. They are however extensively documented on-line [38]. The database
is ready for the integration of further plant genomes,
dependant of collaborations within the scientific community to provide an equally level of quality as seen in
the four presently integrated genomes. The biological
data will continue to be updated and enriched through
novel experiments, expert works, and results of genomic
projects (specifically those concentrated on RNAseq and
interactome data), generating further interest in
FLAGdb++ within the plant science community over the
coming years.

Availability and requirements
The FLAGdb++ home page [38] provides both access to
the installation guide and complete documentation
regarding tools and data. To run the FLAGdb ++

application, JAVA (JRE version 1.6 or higher) should
already be installed on the computer. Database architecture, integrated data and all the pipelines developed (in
Perl) to fill the database are available on request for
users who want to use the FLAGdb++ environment with
other eukaryotic genomes. A Perl script allowing to
open the FLAGdb++ application on a specific feature is
also available on request in order to create interactive
