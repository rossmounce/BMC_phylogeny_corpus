Abstract
Background: Cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements in mammalian genomes typically
contain specific combinations of binding sites for various transcription factors. Although some cisregulatory elements have been well studied, the combinations of transcription factors that regulate
normal expression levels for the vast majority of the 20,000 genes in the human genome are
unknown. We hypothesized that it should be possible to discover transcription factor
combinations that regulate gene expression in concert by identifying over-represented
combinations of sequence motifs that occur together in the genome. In order to detect
combinations of transcription factor binding motifs, we developed a data mining approach based on
the use of association rules, which are typically used in market basket analysis. We scored each
segment of the genome for the presence or absence of each of 83 transcription factor binding
motifs, then used association rule mining algorithms to mine this dataset, thus identifying frequently
occurring pairs of distinct motifs within a segment.
Results: Support for most pairs of transcription factor binding motifs was highly correlated across
different chromosomes although pair significance varied. Known true positive motif pairs showed
higher association rule support, confidence, and significance than background. Our subsets of highconfidence, high-significance mined pairs of transcription factors showed enrichment for cocitation in PubMed abstracts relative to all pairs, and the predicted associations were often readily
verifiable in the literature.
Conclusion: Functional elements in the genome where transcription factors bind to regulate
expression in a combinatorial manner are more likely to be predicted by identifying statistically and
biologically significant combinations of transcription factor binding motifs than by simply scanning
the genome for the occurrence of binding sites for a single transcription factor.

Background
Substantial differences of phenotype can be primarily the

result of differences in gene expression levels rather than
in protein structure. Genes are dynamically regulated, pri-

marily at the transcriptional level, by protein transcription
factors that bind DNA at cis-regulatory regions to activate
or repress expression. Mammalian cis-regulatory regions
range in length from the 60 bp human muSK enhancer [1]
to the 450 bp human TGFβ enhancer [2] to the 1100 bp
enhancer of murine Pax6 [3], but they are generally a few
hundred base pairs in length. Enhancers contain binding
sites for transcription factors, sometimes for a single factor
and sometimes for many [4]. A detailed understanding of
the transcriptional regulatory programs of any organism
requires knowledge of the binding sites of transcription
factors, the circumstances and cellular conditions under
which these transcription factors bind to their targets, and
the genes that are regulated by combinations of transcription factors.
Cis-regulatory regions for most of the approximately
20,000 protein-coding genes encoded in the human
genome have not yet been characterized [5]. Transcription
factor binding sites, and thus cis-regulatory regions, can
be identified using high-throughput methods such as
ChIP-chip [6-9], but there are more than 2000 transcription factors encoded in the human genome [10,11]. This
diversity of transcription factors, coupled with the fact
that many are likely to be expressed and to combinatorially regulate target genes in a developmental, cell-, or tissue-specific manner, makes experimental identification of
cis-regulatory regions challenging even with genome-wide
ChIP-chip. Computational identification of cis-regulatory
motifs based on signatures of their presence in the
genomic sequence is an attractive alternative.
A major class of computational methods for identifying
regulatory elements relies on the occurrence of TF binding
sites in close proximity within regulatory elements. For
example, the stripe 2 enhancer of the even-skipped (eve)
gene in Drosophila melanogaster has twenty binding sites
for four TFs within an area of roughly 600 bp [12]. The
knirps gene of Drosophila is regulated by two enhancers
containing six binding sites each for the transcription factors bicoid and caudal as well as two hunchback sites [13].
The HS2 enhancer of the human β-globin locus contains
four NF-E1 binding sites and 2 CACC boxes within 250 bp
[14], while a 300 bp region near the interleukin 2 transcriptional start site contains multiple binding sites for
Ap-1 and Oct1 as well as sites for NFκB and NFAT [15].
Thus, the density of TF binding sites may be used as a
means to locate cis-regulatory regions computationally
[16].
Computational location of cis-regulatory modules by
clustering of transcription factor binding sites has been
implemented in genomes ranging from yeast [17] to
human [18]. Previous approaches include "sliding window" [19-21] to Hidden Markov models [16,18] to posi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/445

tion weight matrix clustering [22-26], while clusters have
been defined both homotypically [19,21] and heterotypically [20,27-29]. These computational methods have
been used to locate many cis-regulatory regions and novel
target genes, notably in Drosophila. One limitation of these
heterotypic clustering methods is the need to know which
combinations of transcription factors should define the
heterotypic clusters.
Numerous transcription factors are known to cooperate in
certain contexts; for example, it is known that many genes
involved in inflammation are regulated by Ap-1 and NFκB
[30]. Similarly, interactions between PU.1 and GATA family TFs mediate cell differentiation in B-cell development
[31]. Prediction of transcription factor cooperativity has
been carried out in yeast [32,33] and human [34], but elucidation of the entire network of transcription factors that
cooperate with one another in cis-regulatory regions is far
from complete. In order to better define biologically relevant, heterogeneous combinations of transcription factors, we have developed an association rule data mining
approach to search genome sequence information and
identify over-represented adjacent motifs for transcription
factor binding. Predicting transcription factor cooperation
by data mining using association rules has previously
been attempted in yeast as well as C. elegans and human
chromosome 22 [35-37] but these attempts have been
limited to mining known promoters [35] or repetitive elements such as microsatellites [36,37] rather than applied
to the entire human genome.
Association rule data mining [38] was originally used in
market basket analysis to determine which items are frequently purchased together. Basket analysis uses a database of transactions in which each tuple is a list of items
purchased in one customer's transaction. Mining seeks to
discover rules such as "spaghetti ⇒ parmesan cheese,"
meaning "People who buy spaghetti also often buy
parmesan cheese." Association rules can be formally
described as follows: [38]
• I = {i1, i2...in} is a set of literals called items.
• D is a set of transactions. Each transaction T is a set of
items such that T ⊆ I.
• A transaction T contains X, a set of items in I, if X ⊆ T.
• An association rule is an implication of X ⇒ Y, where X
⊂ I, Y ⊂ I, and X ∩ Y = ∅.
• C is the confidence of a rule X ⇒ Y in transaction set D
if c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y. It
is also known as the conditional probability of Y given X,
or P(Y|X).

• S is the support of rule X ⇒ Y in set D if s% of transactions in D contain both X and Y. It is also known as the
joint probability of both X and Y, or P(X ∩ Y).
If a rule X ⇒ Y has high confidence, it is likely that transactions containing X will likely also contain Y. However,
the existence of such a rule does not by itself imply any
causal relationship between X and Y.
Determining over-represented transcription factor partners may help to reveal biological roles for less well-studied transcription factors. Therefore, in our studies, we
used data mining to determine whether two transcription
factors whose experimentally determined binding motifs
were frequently proximal to one another were also likely
to have biologically meaningful interactions. For example, the rule "Nuclear Factor Kappa B ⇒ Ap-1" would indicate "Where there is a motif for NFκB, there is often also
an Ap-1 motif." To allow application of association rules
to transcription factor motifs in the human genome, we
divided the genome into segments and scored each segment for the presence or absence of each of 83 transcription factor binding motifs (Figure 1). Thus, the set of 83
motifs becomes I, each individual transcription factor
binding motif becomes an item, and each small segment
of genome becomes a transaction T whose contents X are
the motifs located within.

Results
Our major aim was to determine whether a pair transcription factors whose motifs were frequently near one
another were more likely to have a biological association
than a pair of transcription factors whose motifs were not.
In order to test this hypothesis, we located all possible
binding sites in the human genome for the position
weight matrices (PWMs) of each of 83 transcription factors (Additional file 1). We then divided the genome into
100 bp regions and used association rule data mining to
calculate support and confidence for each transcription
factor pair in the human genome.
Straightforward association rule mining that simultaneously considers all motif positions discovers high numbers of transcription factor pairs that bind identical or
highly similar motifs. For example, two different transcription factors A and B may both bind to the motif
"CACGTG", so the confidence C of the rule A ⇒ B will be
100%. Similarly, if A binds to "CACGTG" and B binds to
"CACGTGA," this high overlap between binding motifs
will result in the confidence being very high while the rule
is neither interesting nor surprising, although it may still
be biologically valid. To avoid discovery of enriched overlapping motifs, for each transcription pair AB, all overlapping binding sites between A and B were removed before
calculating support and confidence (Figure 2). We also
calculated a P-value based on the hypergeometric proba-

bility of observing the association between A and B by
chance. We ensured that associations between transcription factor motifs were not an artifact caused by the presence of repetitive DNA, by considering repeat masked
regions separately (Methods and Additional file 2). Furthermore, in order to rule out the possibility that associations were generated by nucleotide bias, we ascertained
that dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies of segments containing motif pairs were not significantly different from segments containing one member of the pair or
background (data not shown).
In order to determine whether biologically significant
associations between PWMs arise in promoter regions, we
applied the same pairwise mining algorithm to the subset
of the genome that was 1 kb upstream of the transcrip-

tional start site of all human RefSeq genes [39]. Because
transcription factor function is often phylogenetically
conserved, we also examined whether the combinations
we identified by mining the human genome were identifiable in the mouse genome; we performed identical pairwise mining for significant associations among the same
83 transcription factors on mouse chromosome 1.
Identifying meaningful TF pairs
Due to the size of the human genome and the tendency of
PWMs to match at a large number of genomic locations,
all TF pairs showed some co-occurrence. This support for
possible transcription factor PWM pairs ranged from 9 x
10-6 to 0.2. Support for the association of a given pair of
transcription factors was highly conserved, not only
between promoters and the entire genome (Figure 3A),

Mining without overlap

once for each pair AB. All overlapping motifs between A and B are removed before calculating support, confidence, and P-values, then restored upon subsequent iterations.

ity distribution. We defined the dataset "all" as the complete set of 3403 PWM pairs, and we selected three subsets
with high confidence and significance for further analysis:
"genomewide," "mouse," and "promoter" (Additional file
3).

Association rules with the highest support and confidence
are typically regarded as being interesting; however, if two
different transcription factors each have large numbers of
independent binding motifs in the genome, they could
appear to be associated with high support values merely
by chance. To minimize this possibility and to select those
TF pairs occurring more frequently than by random
chance and thus likely to be biologically meaningful, we
also calculated the statistical significance (P-value) of
observing each TF pair using the hypergeometric probabil-

The subsets "genomewide", "promoter", and "mouse"
were defined as P < 0.05, greater than median difference
between confidence A ⇒ B and confidence B ⇒ A. For the
subset "genomewide" this was measured on the entire
human genome and resulted in 66 TF pairs. For the subset
"mouse," this was measured on mouse chromosome 1
and resulted in 184 pairs. For the subset "promoter", this
was measured only across regions 1 kb upstream of the
transcriptional start site of each RefSeq gene and resulted
in 28 pairs.

The subsets of PWM pairs chosen for further inspection
were of exceptionally high support and statistical significance. They co-occurred within the same short segment of
DNA throughout the human genome much more often
than the others, and much more frequently than expected
by chance given their individual distributions. Transcription factors binding to the motifs represented by these
PWMs were therefore expected to bind and jointly regulate the expression of target genes.
Microarray verification
We hypothesized that high-support, high-significance TF
pairs or their target genes might be co-expressed in microarray data more often than other pairs. Therefore, we calculated the Pearson correlations of expression for all genes
across 4742 human microarrays from the Stanford Microarray Database, but we saw no difference between the
expression correlations of selected TF pairs and all TF pairs
and no difference between genes containing both members of a high-support, high-significance motif pair 1 kb
upstream of the transcriptional start site and genes without (data not shown).
Verification In the literature
We next manually examined the literature for evidence of
biological associations and joint regulation of target genes
by the "genomewide" and "mouse" subsets of PWM pairs
that were identified by data mining. We found that many
of these TF pairs were readily verifiable in the literature as
true co-regulators of human and mouse genes (Table 1).
For example the subsets "mouse" and "genomewide"
both included the pair "Ap-2, Egr1." Genes known to be
regulated by these two transcription factors include tumor
necrosis factor α [40,41], human phenylethanolamine Nmethyltransferase [42], and rat chromogranin B [43]. The
subsets "mouse" and "genomewide" contain the pair
"Sp1, p53"; each has been shown to regulate ICAM1[44,45]. A comparison of distributions for all pairs compared to 131 true positives collected from the literature
revealed that true positive pairs exhibited higher support
and confidence and lower P-values than did all pairs (Figure 4), regardless of whether the entire human genome,
human promoters, or mouse chromosome 1 were mined.
As an exhaustive manual analysis of the literature for all
TF pairs was not feasible, we used high-throughput cocitation analysis to further assess the biological relevance
of the high-support, high-confidence TF pairs.
High-throughput co-citation
In order to determine whether the members of a TF pair
were co-cited in the literature more often than expected by
chance and more often than the pairs that were not significant, we used the CoCiteStats package in R [46] to calculate PubMed co-citation rates for all TF pairs and subsets.
For each pair of PWMs, CoCiteStats calculates co-citation

by determining the concordance, Jaccard index, and
Hubert's Γ, as well as the P-values for these indices, which
are significant at P < 0.05 [47]. Concordance is a straightforward measure of how many papers in PubMed co-cite
both genes. The Jaccard index is the ratio of the number of
papers containing both genes to the number of papers
containing at least one of the two genes. Hubert's Γ measures the degree of association between two binary variables, ranges from -1 to 1, and can be interpreted similarly
to the Pearson correlation [47]. Because papers that cite a
large number of genes are less likely to contain meaningful information about interactions between any two genes
cited in that paper than papers citing fewer genes, CoCiteStats also weights data for paper size (number of genes
cited in a paper), gene size (number of papers that cite a
gene), and both gene and paper size [47].

sets showed substantially higher proportions of TF pairs
enriched for low co-citation P-values in all cases than the
set of all pairs, indicating that transcription factors binding to the PWMs that showed substantial association with
one another on the genome were more likely to be cocited in the literature, reflecting a likely biological association between them. This enrichment of "genomewide"
was significant for most values at all adjustments. The
subset "mouse" was enriched for significant concordances
and Jaccard values when unadjusted or adjusted by paper
size and was significant for all values when adjusted by
both gene and paper size. The subset "promoter" was
more significant after adjustments for gene size or both
gene and paper size.

Discussion
Data mining using association rules discovered biologically meaningful cooperating TF pairs. Known true positive TF pairs showed higher support, confidence, and
significance than did all pairs. Mined pairs with high sig-

nificance as measured by the hypergeometric probability
distribution and a large difference between confidence
A=>B and confidence B=>A were frequently verified in the
literature and showed enrichment of low co-citation Pvalues. We found that data mining the entire human
genome was a better indicator of biological significance
than was mining mouse chromosome 1, as measured by
co-citation.
Given that phylogenetically conserved transcription factor
binding motifs are thought to be biologically useful [48],
it is interesting that 60% of the TF pairs in the subset
"genomewide" were also present in the subset "mouse."
Comparison of TF pairs for multiple mouse chromosomes
or across more than two mammals may lead to even better
results. The smaller overlap between "promoter" and
"mouse" (14%) and "promoter" and "genomewide"
(42%) may be due in part to differences in sequence size
and nucleotide frequency; the sequence mined for "promoter" was a tenth the size of the sequence mined for

"mouse" and ~1/200 the size of the sequence for "genomewide." Furthermore, the "promoter" sequence has a
much higher GC content of 53% GC, while the human
genome and mouse chromosome 1 are 41% GC; the
PWMs used for mining have an average GC content of
46%.
Approximately 2900 of the TF pairs in our analysis were
non-significant on mouse chromosome 1, human 1 kb
promoter regions, or the human genome. The most confident of the remaining ~550 TF pairs may merit further

study. Our estimated error rates for PWM matches located
by Patser ranged from 3.5% to 61.5% with an average of
20% and a median of 18% (Additional file 4). Pairs containing a TF with a very high error rate are less likely to be
of predictive value, but most TF pairs with high confidence and significance did not have very high Patser error
rates.
Our approach is novel, low-cost, and straightforward to
implement. The main advantage of this approach is that
the signal for the association of transcription factors is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/445

detectable using only the genome sequence and is not
limited by lack of prior knowledge about physiological
conditions or cell types in which the transcription factor
combination may be active. Unlike clustering algorithms,
which require items to be assigned to only one cluster,
association rules allow items to be members of many
groups and may discover these relationships. This algorithm also enables us to analyze a great number of motifs
and large amount of sequence data for which Gibbs sampling is not currently feasible. One limitation of our current implementation is that we have applied it to identify
only combinations of two distinct transcription factors.
Although it is possible to discover associations of multiple
transcription factors in the genome sequence through
association rule mining, this is more computationally
demanding.

thermore, the short, degenerate nature of position weight
matrices means that thousands of 1 kb upstream regions
are likely to contain any given PWM pair. We found that
each PWM was present in the upstream regions of 10,948
genes on average, while the promoter region of each gene
contained an average of 70 PWMs (data not shown).
Thus, any comparisons of subsets became comparisons of
most genes versus most genes, making it difficult to detect
a change in the distribution of correlation coefficients.
Observing correlated expression of the target genes of
highly supported TF pairs would be much more likely if
target genes could be more rigidly defined and a subset of
microarray experiments was chosen to reflect likely conditions for transcription factor activity, but choosing these
experiments is nontrivial, particularly for transcription
factors that have not been well-studied.

As with any computational prediction, the significant
challenge is verification of the predicted TF pairs. Co-citation analysis was particularly useful given that expected
measures of biological association between the members
of predicted TF pairs, such as correlated expression of target genes and network connectivity, were not useful. There
are several possible explanations for why we did not
observe correlations for significant mined TF pairs in
microarray data. First, the activity of transcription factors
may not be primarily regulated transcriptionally. Rather,
transcription factors may require degradation of chaperones to become active, as does NFκB, or ligand binding
may be needed to cause an active receptor to relocalize to
the nucleus, as in the case of the estrogen receptor. While
some transcription factors, such as targets of immediate
early genes, may have similar mechanisms of transcriptional activation, it is likely that many, if not most cooperating transcription factors will have diverse means of
transcriptional regulation and will thus not be coexpressed. Furthermore, due to noise and the fact that
transcription factors may be inactive in many cell types
and experimental conditions, any co-expression signature
may be lost in large amounts of microarray data even for
transcription factors known to be co-expressed. For example, across the 4247 microarrays we analyzed, the Pearson
correlations for Fos with JunB and Jun were -0.11 and
0.146, respectively; the correlation was -0.116 for Gata2
and Gata3 and 0.24 for Sox5 and Sox6. Thus, even for
known pairs of transcription factors, there is little detectable coexpression across a large microarray dataset.

Co-citation is not without drawbacks. The fact that two
proteins are cited in a paper does not necessarily mean
that they interact with one another. Furthermore, wellstudied proteins are likely to be overrepresented while
less-studied proteins will be missed. Validation by coexpression, however, requires knowledge of target genes
and conditions for transcription factor activity; this may
not be known or be feasible for experimental analysis.
Future experimental validation of predicted associations
could be accomplished by identifying binding targets for
these transcription factors by genome-wide chromatin
immunoprecipitation analyses and determining joint
occupancy of target promoters by predicted combinations
of transcription factors. Current maps of human proteinprotein interactions [49-53] may not yet define many
interactions for human transcription factors or may contain high rates of false positives [54], but they are constantly improving. We anticipate that better human
protein-protein interaction maps will eventually provide a
superior means of assessing performance of TF pair data
mining, allowing this method to be refined to reveal both
novel transcription factor interactions and biological context for previously uncharacterized transcription factors.

We found that genes containing significant pairs of PWMs
in their promoters were no more likely to be co-regulated
than a background set. One possible explanation is that
our list of 4742 microarrays represented a wide variety of
experimental conditions, but many of the transcription
factors we studied are active only under specific conditions satisfied in only a small number of experiments. Fur-

Conclusion
Here we have described a novel genomic method for predicting biologically relevant, heterogeneous combinations of cooperating transcription factors by data mining
using association rules to search genome information and
identify over-represented proximal motifs. Using this
approach, we show that that true positive cooperating TF
pairs tend to have higher support, confidence, and significance, and that mined TF pairs with high confidence and
significance are frequently verified in the literature and
enriched for low co-citation P-values. Data mining the
entire human genome enabled better discovery of biologically meaningful pairs than mining mouse chromosome
1, as measured by co-citation.

Methods
Data transformation
We collected 163 human position weight matrices
(PWMs) from TRANSFAC [55] and removed those which
were redundant or could not be mapped to RefSeq genes
[39], leaving 83 PWMs for analysis (Additional file 1). We
used Patser [56] to map all locations in the human
genome assembly hg17 and in the repeat-masked human
genome assembly hg18 [57] to which each transcription
factor could bind with P < 0.001. We then divided the
genome into 100 bp regions and scored each region for
the presence or absence of each PWM. We chose a region
size of 100 bp because it is compatible with the size of
known cis-regulatory regions and large enough to contain
multiple non-overlapping transcription factor binding
motifs. PWMs tend towards large numbers of possible
binding sites in the genome; 100 bp regions are small
enough to prevent most regions from containing most
motifs. We mined this matrix of genomic regions and
motifs they contained for frequent itemsets, using association rules to search for X ⇒ Y with high support S. Support and confidence were highly correlated between hg17
without repeat masking and hg18 with repeat masking
(Additional file 2). High-support, high-confidence, significant PWM pairs were comparable between region sizes
ranging from 75 bp to 225 bp, although larger region sizes
yielded greater numbers of significant pairs.
Estimating Patser error rate for PWMs
We estimated Patser error rates for each position weight
matrix by calculating its average P-value across the
genome as given by Patser, multiplying this by the size of
the genome minus the length of masked repeats and then
dividing by total number of matches to approximate the
number of overestimated Patser matches.
Mining without overlap
In order to avoid enrichment of PWMs with highly similar
binding motifs, we mined the human genome without
allowing motif overlap, one motif pair at a time. That is,
for each TF pair AB (83 transcription factors taken two at
a time, or 3403 pairs), after all possible binding motifs for
A and B respectively were identified, any overlapping A
and B motifs were removed before assigning the remaining non-overlapping sites to their respective 100 bp
regions (Figure 2). The full set of matches for each factor
was restored at the beginning of each iteration, so overlaps
between A and C were unaffected by overlaps between A
and B. For example, if transcription factor A had a binding
motif of width 5 which was present at positions 100, 130,
and 150, while factor B had a binding motif of width 7
present at 102, 160, and 175, the binding sites 100A and
102B would be removed from calculations due to overlap;
the remaining binding sites would still allow the region
from 100 to 200 to be scored as containing A and B. After

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/445

scoring each 100 bp region, we calculated association rule
support (proportions of regions) for A, B, and AB for each
pair on each chromosome, correcting for the proportion
of the genome that was repeat-masked. Additionally, we
calculated confidence for A ⇒ B and B ⇒ A and a P-value
based on the hypergeometric probability of observing the
association between A and B by chance, given the individual distributions of their binding motifs in the genome,
again correcting for repeat masking. To allow phylogenetic comparison and comparison of promoters versus
the entire genome, we performed identical pairwise mining on mouse chromosome 1 and on the subset of the
human genome that was 1 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of all human RefSeq genes.
Microarray data
To determine whether transcription factor pairs with high
support and high confidence were highly co-expressed, we
downloaded and analyzed a dataset consisting of 4742
human microarrays from the Stanford Microarray Database [58] and calculated the Pearson correlation for each
gene pair with 100 or more experimental data points. We
defined a list of potential target genes for TF pairs by scanning 1 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of
each RefSeq gene for each PWM.
True positives
From the Compel database [59] and the literature, we collected 131 transcription factor pairs known to co-regulate
mammalian genes [40,41,44,45,60-131].
