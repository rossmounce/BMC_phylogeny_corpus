robertsoni in an historically endemic
schistosomiasis area

Abstract
Background: Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni is the sole intermediate host for Schistosoma japonicum in western
China. Given the close co-evolutionary relationships between snail host and parasite, there is interest in
understanding the distribution of distinct snail phylogroups as well as regional population structures. Therefore, this
study focuses on these aspects in a re-emergent schistosomiasis area known to harbour representatives of two
phylogroups - the Deyang-Mianyang area in Sichuan Province, China. Based on a combination of mitochondrial
and nuclear DNA, the following questions were addressed: 1) the phylogeography of the two O. h. robertsoni
phylogroups, 2) regional and local population structure in space and time, and 3) patterns of local dispersal under
different isolation-by-distance scenarios.
Results: The phylogenetic analyses confirmed the existence of two distinct phylogroups within O. h. robertsoni. In
the study area, phylogroups appear to be separated by a mountain range. Local specimens belonging to the
respective phylogroups form monophyletic clades, indicating a high degree of lineage endemicity. Molecular clock
estimations reveal that local lineages are at least 0.69-1.58 million years (My) old and phylogeographical analyses
demonstrate that local, watershed and regional effects contribute to population structure. For example, Analyses of
Molecular Variances (AMOVAs) show that medium-scale watersheds are well reflected in population structures and
Mantel tests indicate isolation-by-distance effects along waterways.
Conclusions: The analyses revealed a deep, complex and hierarchical structure in O. h. robertsoni, likely reflecting a
long and diverse evolutionary history. The findings have implications for understanding disease transmission. From
a co-evolutionary standpoint, the divergence of the two phylogroups raises species level questions in O. h.
robertsoni and also argues for future studies relative to the distinctness of the respective parasites. The endemicity
of snail lineages at the regional level supports the concept of endemic schistosomiasis areas and calls for future
geospatial analyses for a better understanding of respective boundaries. Finally, local snail dispersal mainly occurs
along waterways and can be best described by using cost distance, thus potentially enabling a more precise
modelling of snail, and therefore, parasite dispersal.

Background
The parasite species of the trematode genus Schistosoma
cause human schistosomiasis, one of the most prevalent
parasitic diseases in the world, infecting more than 200
million people and leading to a substantial burden of
disease [1]. Schistosoma japonicum, the causal agent of
the disease common in East and Southeast Asia, remains
a public health threat for millions of people living in the
tropical and subtropical zones of China [2]. Though
overall prevalence and intensity of infection have
decreased greatly in recent decades [3], cases of reemergence remain of concern [4,5]. The considerable
medical importance of S. japonicum has spurred numerous parasitological, ecological and genetic studies.
Genetic variation between strains of S. japonicum from
widely separated geographical areas, for example, have
been reported based on allozyme, nucleotide sequence,
microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses [6-15]. Indeed, the genetic distance between some
S. japonicum populations is so immense as to indicate
that they represent distinct taxa [10]. In particular,
researchers consider that parasites from Sichuan Province, which are transmitted by the nominal snail subspecies Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni, possibly
belong to a separate strain [10-12].
Given the demonstrated close co-evolutionary relationships between S. japonicum and its intermediate
snail host O. hupensis ssp. [16], there is an increased
interest in understanding snail phylogenetics and population structure. The importance of the snail host for
comprehending disease transmission is further reinforced by three principal findings:
1) Oncomelania hupensis is the sole intermediate host
for Schistosoma japonicum: unlike S. mansoni and S.
haematobium, host switching does not appear to occur.
2) Given the close genetic interactions between snail
and parasite in terms of co-evolutionary relationships, a
snail population likely reflects population genetic parameters of the parasite and vice versa [17,18].
3) Genetically diverse snail populations appear to be
more susceptible to infection with S. japonicum than
homogeneous populations [19].
Molecular and morphological analyses, together with
breeding experiments and biogeographic studies of O.
hupensis indicate that there are three subspecies on the
mainland of China [16,20-22]. Oncomelania h. hupensis
primarily occurs in the Yangtze River drainage below
the Three Gorges; it has spread to Guangxi Province via
the Grand Canal from Hunan (note that some authors
consider the latter populations to belong to a distinct
subspecies, O. h. guangxiensis [23,24]). Oncomelania h.
tangi is restricted to Fujian Province along the coast,
and O. h. robertsoni has a patchy distribution in Sichuan

Page 2 of 18

and Yunnan Provinces above the Three Gorges.
However, subspecies validity and assignment remains
controversial [24,25], including the western subspecies
O. h. robertsoni. Genetically, it is highly distinct from all
other known subspecies of O. hupensis [16,22,26,27],
raising questions about whether it deserves full species
status. Moreover, based on mitochondrial (mt) DNA
sequence data, the existence of at least two major phylogroups within O. h. robertsoni was demonstrated, with
pairwise K2P-distances for two mtDNA genes of up to
0.12 (= 12%) [26]. Because such a high divergence typically reflects genus-level relationships within the snail
superfamily Rissooidea [28], it was initially not clear
whether the patterns observed are due to the presumed
long evolutionary history of this subspecies [16] or are
simply artefacts. Note that O. hupensis is a dioecious
species (i.e., an individual specimen is distinctly male or
female). Thus selfing cannot explain the overall high
diversity within this species either.
Only recently, an independent study based on DNA
sequencing data of a nuclear (nc) gene confirmed the
existence of two phylogroups [27]. However, the regional distribution of these groups is not well understood.
Moreover, possible co-evolutionary implications of these
two genetically and sexually isolated snail host taxa for
the genetic structure of S. japonicum remain unknown.
At the same time, little knowledge exists about smallerscale population structures in O. h. robertsoni, such as
those within schistosomiasis transmission areas. As a
consequence, local effects of barriers (such as watershed
boundaries or mountain ranges) and means of dispersal
(such as along water networks or bird-mediated) on
snail and thus parasite distributions are poorly understood. Given these knowledge gaps, there is a need for
better understanding of the phylogroup distribution in
O. h. robertsoni and regional population structures in
time and space.
This study focused on these aspects in a formerly endemic schistosomiasis area previously reported to harbour
representatives of two distinct phylogroups [26] - the
Deyang-Mianyang area in Sichuan Province (Figure 1).
Based on a combination of mtDNA and genome-wide
ncDNA, we studied:
1) The phylogeography of the two O. h. robertsoni
phylogroups, with an interest in understanding how
these groups are distributed on a micro-scale, e.g.,
whether they occur in sympatry.
2) Regional and local population structures in space
and time, focusing on the degree of population admixing
as well as the potential correlation of population structure with physical barriers. Our working hypothesis is
that strong habitat fragmentation in the study area,
together with the long evolutionary history of the

structure of the intermediate snail host affects susceptibility to schistosome infections, the means of snail, and
thus parasite, dispersal, and phylogenetic tracking in
Schistosoma japonicum.

subspecies, causes a clear population structure reflecting
the spatial structure of watersheds.
3) Patterns of dispersal under different isolation-bydistance scenarios to test whether isolation-by-distance
can explain the phylogeographical patterns observed and
if so, which dispersal scenario (i.e., straight line vs.
waterway distances, etc.) is supported by genetic data.
The hypothesis to be tested is that active or passive dispersal along waterways best explains the phylogeographical patterns observed.
Our study constitutes the first effort to combine mitochondrial and genome-wide nuclear data on the one
hand, with phylogeographical, molecular clock, and phylogenetic analyses on the other hand, to unravel the
microevolution of Oncomelania h. robertsoni. The findings of this study relate to the allopatric distribution of
the two distinct snail phylogroups, the existence of presumably endemic lineages within the study area, the
high degree of population admixing, the roles of large
and small scale effects on population structure, and patterns of snail dispersal along watersheds, all of which
have important parasitological implications. The results
contribute to a better understanding of how population

The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of specimens of
Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni from throughout
its distribution area under the relaxed-clock assumption resulted in the consensus tree shown in Figure 2
(left). The tree topology is very robust with all major
and most medium-level clades being highly supported (i.e., Bayesian posterior probabilities [BPP] ≥
0.95). In the tree, all O. h. robertsoni specimens form
a monophyletic clade, clustering as sister group to
O. h. hupensis (BPP = 1). Within O. h. robertsoni,
two major phylogroups (BPP = 1) are evident. Phylogroup I (numbering according to Wilke et al. [26])
is primarily distributed in central and southern
Sichuan as well as Yunnan. Specimens of phylogroup
II occur mainly in western, but also in southern
Sichuan.
All specimens from the northern Deyang-Mianyang
area studied in the present paper cluster within phylogroup I, whereas all specimens from the southernmost
population in the study area (Z3, see Figure 1) belong to
phylogroup II. In our study area, these two phylogroups
do not spatially overlap. However, overlapping is evident
in southern Sichuan (see specimens GB-A8a, h vs.
GB-A8d, j, k in Figure 1).
All specimens from the northern Deyang-Mianyang
area (except for the extreme southern ones belonging
to phylogroup II) form a monophyletic group (BPP =
0.98). Note that specimen GB-M4, previously studied
by Attwood et al. [29], also clusters within this group
as it comes from the same area. Within this monophyletic Deyang-Mianyang clade, two subclades (BPP = 1
each) are evident. Subclade Ia is highly diverse, comprising several deep lineages. Subclade Ib, however, is
relatively shallow with fewer distinct groups. The two
subclades do not show a clear geographical structure,
with specimens from different groups occurring
sympatrically.
The molecular clock analysis of the reduced data set,
comprising phylogroup I specimens from the DeyangMianyang area (see strict clock Bayesian tree in Figure
2, right), indicates that the MRCA of the two subclades
is approximately 1.09 My (95% CI: 0.69-1.58 My) old.
Note that CI estimation includes both the error of
branch length variation in the Bayesian analysis (i.e.,
0.73-1.54 My) and the error of the clock rate for the
HKY model (i.e., ± 0.22% My-1; see Methods section for
details).

Figure 2 COI phylogeny of Oncomelania h. robertsoni. Bayesian phylogenetic tree for Oncomelania h. robertsoni under the relaxed clock
model inferred from the mitochondrial COI gene (left). The outgroup taxon, O. minima, was removed a posteriori. The two major phylogroups
within O. h. robertsoni are labelled I and II. For specimen codes see Table 3 (ingroup sequences taken from GenBank are indicated by the prefix
“GB”). A strict clock Bayesian tree of selected specimens of O. h. robertsoni from the Deyang-Mianyang area is shown on the right. Haplotypes
from this area are color-coded according to counties (note that specimen GB-M4, previously studied by Attwood et al. [29], also originates from
this area). For reasons of clarity, outgroups were removed posteriori and the overall topologies of the two distinct subclades Ia and Ib are
indicated by triangles. The age of the MRCM of the two subclades and the respective 95% confidence interval are illustrated by a black bar. For
both trees, all Bayesian posterior probabilities ≥ 0.95 are given next to the nodes.

Figure 3 COI network of Oncomelania h. robertsoni. Statistical parsimony haplotype networks for specimens from the Deyang-Mianyang area
based on the COI gene (connection limit 95%). The three separate networks correspond to phylogroup II and the two subclades (Ia and Ib) of
phylogroup I (see Figure 2). Haplotypes are color-coded according to counties. Areas of circles representing the haplotypes found are
proportional to the number of specimens sharing the respective haplotype. Missing haplotypes are indicated by black dots. Haplotypes with the
highest probability of being the ancestral haplotype in the individual networks are indicated by bold circles.

Network analyses (COI and AFLP data)

The COI-based TCS network (Figure 3) largely reflects
the relationships seen in the phylogenetic trees presented above. The analysis resulted in three individual
networks, which could not be connected by the statistical parsimony network algorithm in a parsimonious
fashion (connection limit 95%).
The first network (Ia) consists of specimens from
throughout the Deyang-Mianyang area (except for specimens from Z3) and corresponds to subclade Ia in the
phylogenetic analysis (see Figure 2). The network consists of several distinct haplotypes with the putative
ancestral haplotype (bold circle) being shared by only
four specimens from three populations. In contrast, network two (Ib) shows a star-like structure with the putative ancestral haplotype being shared by 43 specimens
from eight populations. This network corresponds to
subclade Ib in Figure 2. The third network (labeled II)
consists of nine specimens from the southernmost
population Z3 (see Figure 1). Specimens belonging to
this population are the only ones from the Deyang-Mianyang area studied that belong to phylogroup II (see
Figure 2).
The AFLP-based network generated in SplitsTree 4.10
(Figure 4) shows a star-like topology. Geographical

structuring is weak, though specimens belonging to the
same population tend to cluster together. This is particularly evident for the representatives of the southernmost population Z3 (see Figure 1; also see phylogroup II
in Figure 2), which form the most distinct cluster in the
network.
AMOVA and SAMOVA analyses (COI and AFLP data)

A global AMOVA of populations by scaling order (SO)
revealed for the COI data that about 73% of total molecular variation is distributed among, and only 27%
within, populations (Table 1). For the AFLP data, the
highest portion of genetic variation (87%) was found
within populations and only 13% among populations.
When using watersheds as scaling order (see Method
section), the highest proportion of variance in the
COI gene can be found at small to medium scale levels
(70-75%).
For the AFLP data, the variation among watersheds is
much smaller: the highest value of 6% was found at the
medium scale level WS 3 (Table 1). However, the highest among-group variation in both the COI gene and
AFLP data was detected when using the two distinct
phylogroups (see Figure 2) as SO (86% and 11% in COI
and AFLP data, respectively; see Table 1).

Figure 4 AFLP network of Oncomelania h. robertsoni. NeighborNet network for specimens from the Deyang-Mianyang area based on AFLP
data. The scale bar indicates ML distances. Specimen labels are color-coded according to counties. The distinct specimens from population Z3,
which correspond to phylogroup II, are encircled.

In contrast to the AMOVA, the spatial groupings suggested by the SAMOVA are less distinct. For the AFLP
data, none of the F CT values (i.e., the variance among
geographically adjacent groups relative to the total variance) is supported with p ≤ 0.1. For the COI gene, the
highest FCT value (0.86) was obtained for a spatial clustering corresponding to the distribution of the two phylogroups. However, the respective p-value was only
0.058.

Exact test and mismatch distribution (COI data)

Exact test and mismatch distribution analyses were carried out for specimens from the Deyang-Mianyang area
belonging to the two distinct COI networks within phylogroup I (i.e., Ia and Ib in Figure 3). The exact test of
sample differentiation based on haplotype frequencies
rejected the global null hypothesis of panmixia for both
subclades (p < 0.001). Pairwise analyses of individual
populations indicated significant differences (p ≤ 0.05)

use mismatch distribution analyses only for testing the
spatial extension model and not the demographic one
(see Method section).
The individual mismatch distribution for subclade Ia
shows a bimodal pattern with a maximal number of
pairwise differences of 12 (Figure 5, left). Particular
comparisons involving pairs with high nucleotide differences cluster outside the 95% confidence intervals of the
coalescent simulations. Nonetheless, with a sum of
squared deviation (SSD) value of 0.057 (p = 0.262), the

in favour of a demographic equilibrium. In contrast, the
mismatch distribution for subclade Ib shows a relatively
uniform distribution with the maximum number of pairwise differences being low (Figure 5, right). With a SSD
value of 0.017 (p ≤ 0.001), the spatial expansion model
for this subclade is rejected (note, however, that the variation in subclade Ib is very low, therefore, this result
has to be treated with caution).

Indices for correlation of genetic (COI and AFLP data) distances and

area (rM). Statistically significant results are marked with asterisks: * p ≤ 0.05,
** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001

distances for 10 out of 13 different geographic distance
variables (Table 2). The best correlations were found for
the following variables: Cost distance (rM = 0.59), total
path (rM = 0.50), linear 1:10 and binary 1:10 (both rM =
0.49), as well as isotropic least-cost on-stream segments
(rM = 0.48).
The Mantel tests for the AFLP data showed very similar results. Here, 9 out of 13 different geographic distance variables showed significant correlations with
genetic distance (Table 2). Moreover, the five best values
were obtained for the very same variables as in the COI
gene with values of rM = 0.25, 0.25, 0.30, 0.25 and 0.24,
respectively. The distance variable with the overall best
correlation in both data sets was cost distance.
The Mantel test performed on genetic distances calculated for the COI and AFLP data sets also showed a significant relationship between these two different sets of
genetic data (rM = 0.486, p = 0.048).

Discussion
Phylogeny of Oncomelania h. robertsoni

From the present study it becomes evident that the two
deviant phylogroups in O. h. robertsoni have no clear
spatial structure. Though phylogroup II appears to have
a more southern and eastern distribution [26], ranges
are adjacent (e.g. in the southern part of our study area)
or even overlap as previously shown for an area in
southern Sichuan [26].
Interestingly, the disjunctive distribution of the two
phylogroups in the Deyang-Mianyang area cannot be
explained with watershed classifications (Figure 6) or

other limnological parameters. Instead, the two groups
remain separated by the largest mountain range in the
area, the Longquan Mountains, reaching altitudes of >
1000 m (Figure 1). This geographical barrier might be
the reason why phylogroup II specimens have not (yet)
reached the northern Deyang-Mianyang area, while we
did find a sympatric population in southern Sichuan
(see GB-A8a, h vs. GB-A8d, j, k in Figure 1).
The observed geographical patterns could be the
result of increasing secondary contact of phylogroups I
and II. However, whether time of isolation has been
long enough to allow for the development of pre- or
postzygotic barriers to speciation [30] remains unclear
as the age of the MRCA of phylogroups I and II could
not be estimated due to the rejection of the strict molecular clock model in the full data set.
Nevertheless, given the topology of the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 2), this MRCA must be much older than
0.69-1.58 My, possibly dating back to the early Pliocene
or even late Miocene.
The generally patchy distribution of the phylogenetically old phylogroups I and II throughout Yunnan and
Sichuan might be largely due to the highly fragmented
and often isolated habitats of O. h. robertsoni in the hilly
and mountainous regions of western China [31,32]. In
this regard, O. h. robertsoni differs considerably from its
eastern Chinese sister taxon, O. h. hupensis. Being distributed mainly within and along the floodplains of the
Yangtze River, the latter taxon is strongly affected by
annual flooding [16,22], leading to extensive gene flow
and population admixing [19,33].
Unfortunately, the two phylogroups are not as clearly
separated in the AFLP data set compared to the
mtDNA data, further complicating decisions as to the
taxonomic status of these two groups. While phylogroup
II specimens form a distinct cluster in the AFLP-based
network (Figure 4) and show a significant grouping in
the AMOVA analyses (Table 1), overall divergence
remains low. Possible explanations include the exchange
of genes and the differential performance of AFLP.
While this method works well for closely related genotypes, unrelated genotypes may contribute considerable
noise to the data set [34]. This is due to the fact that
AFLP only uses fragment length as a criterion and not
the actual DNA sequences. Accordingly, co-migrating
fragments (i.e., those of the same length) are considered
to be homologous. This assumption, however, is an
oversimplification [35] and the fraction of non-identical
co-migrating (i.e., homoplasious) fragments largely
depends on phylogenetic distance. Values can range
from approximately 10% in closely related genotypes to
as much as 100% in distantly related taxa [34]. Given
these findings, it appears possible that the lack of a clear
differentiation of the two ancient phylogroups based on

robertsoni. For county and site codes see Table 3.

AFLP data is due to noise problems (also see Caballero
& Quesada [36]). However, at a lower taxonomic level
(i.e., within phylogroups), this problem seems to be less
severe as indicated by, for example, the tendency of specimens originating from the same population to cluster

together in the network analysis (Figure 4) and the
results of the Mantel test showing concordance of COI
and AFLP data.
No matter whether the two O. h. robertsoni phylogroups represent distinct species or not, implications

Hauswald et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:206
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/206

for understanding disease transmission might be substantial due to the close co-evolutionary relationships
between S. japonicum and its hosts, both intermediate
and definitive. Not only are there distinct parasite
strains that correlate to snail subspecies [10-12], but
also to definitive host species (i.e., buffalo, cattle and
humans vs. goats, pigs, dogs and cats [13,37]; for a
review of host species see McManus et al. [38]). These
data indicate a distinct hierarchical genetic structure in
S. japonicum: 1) genotype groups according to intermediate snail host taxa, 2) subgroups corresponding to
definitive hosts, and 3) possibly MLGs within strains.
This presumably high degree of host specificity calls
for a closer investigation of the parasites within the
respective O. h. robertsoni phylogroups. Of interest is
also whether snails belonging to different phylogroups
show different rates of susceptibility to infection or even
different scales of resistance ("Red Queen” [39]). Finally,
cases of schistosomiasis re-emergence in Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces should be studied in respect to snail
phylogroups (i.e., phylogroup admixing and/or
replacement).
Regional and local population structures in space and
time

Our phylogenetic analyses show that specimens of all
but the southernmost population from the Deyang-Mianyang area (Z3) belong to phylogroup I. Moreover,
these specimens form a relatively old and well supported
monophyletic group in our analyses (Figure 2), indicating distinct geographical pattern at a regional scale and
corroborating the status of the area as being historically
endemic for schistosomiasis. Within this clade (i.e.,
within the Deyang-Mianyang area), the geographical
structure appears to be weaker. Nonetheless, the results
of the AMOVAs show significant partitioning of genetic
variance according to watersheds (Table 1), both for the
COI and, to a lesser, extent, the AFLP data sets. In addition, local demographic processes appear to act heavily
on individual populations, causing medium (COI gene)
to high (AFLP data) partitioning of variation within
populations (Table 1).
Interestingly, the Deyang-Mianyang clade consists of
two well supported subclades (see subclades Ia and Ib in
Figure 2). These two groups do not appear to be spatially structured as specimens belonging to both groups
occur in sympatry. However, individual mismatch analyses of subclade Ia and Ib specimens reveal contrasting
patterns in terms of ruggedness and number of maximum pairwise nucleotide differences (Figure 5).
Acknowledging that mismatch patterns are difficult to
interpret [40], the pattern seen in Ia might suggests the
existence of old and diverse lineages and possibly indicates a relatively stable population structure (also see

Page 10 of 18

Figure 3). In contrast, the pattern seen in Ib points to
young lineages with no sudden spatial expansions being
detectable. The most parsimonious explanation for these
striking differences in age, structure and spatial history
between the two subclades is that both groups were previously isolated and only recently came in contact. In
fact, our genetic data indicate a long and diverse evolutionary history of O. h. robertsoni populations in the
Deyang-Mianyang area starting some 0.69-1.58 My ago
(see Figure 2).
Overall, the combined results of our phylogenetic
and phylogeographical analyses indicate, for the first
time, a hierarchical population structure in O. h.
robertsoni, caused by small to medium scale factors.
Scales of concern are: 1) the population level characterized by local demographic processes, 2) the
watershed level with watershed boundaries acting
against gene flow to different degrees, and 3) the regional level of a formerly endemic schistosomiasis area,
supporting a high degree of endemic snail lineages. In
addition, we see large scale effects such as increasing
secondary phylogroup contact, possibly caused by
long-range dispersal of O. h. robertsoni throughout
Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.
Of these scale effects, watershed effects are important
but do not appear to be the dominant factor. Therefore,
our null hypothesis that the strong habitat fragmentation in the study area and the long evolutionary history
of the subspecies are best reflected in a population
structure corresponding to watershed distribution, has
to be rejected.
Instead, larger scale effects together with considerable
population admixing might also contribute to the
genetic patterns observed. Using the words of Ian Flemings’s fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond
as a metaphor, which were first introduced in the 1956
novel “Diamonds are Forever“, the population structure
of O. h. robertsoni within this formerly endemic schistosomiasis area is stirred, but not shaken.
Patterns of dispersal under different isolation-by-distance
scenarios

For both data sets AFLP and COI, we see clear isolation-by-distance effects, that is, a significant correlation
between geographic and genetic distance. This is a
rather unexpected finding as, to our knowledge, such an
effect has not been shown before for a currently or historically endemic schistosomiasis area in China. Though
this might be partly due to the fact that only few
detailed regional studies exist, previous studies mainly
suggested either large scale admixing effects caused by
long-range dispersal [26] or strong fragmentation effects
at the landscape level [25,32] as the prevailing biogeographical processes in O. h. robertsoni.

Hauswald et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:206
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/206

Moreover, both marker systems used, although being
very different in terms of performance and target molecules, indicate the very same distance parameters as
those having the highest effect (see Table 2). Though
these effects are relatively small in the AFLP data set,
three isotropic least-cost and two anisotropic least-cost
distance variables show the highest rM values. In contrast, Euclidean distance (i.e., simple straight-line distance) shows a weaker influence in both data sets, and
is non-significant in the AFLP dataset.
Acknowledging that the biology and ecology of O. h.
robertsoni are still not fully understood, these findings
argue for a primary dispersal along waterways. This
could be caused either passively by currents or flooding,
attachment of eggs to aquatic or amphibious animals, or
human-mediated [16,39,41]. It could also be actively as
O. h. robertsoni is known to be negatively rheotropic
[39].
Water birds and other vectors not bound to waterways
likely play only a minor role for the regional dispersal of
O. h. robertsoni. This, in turn, means that our null
hypothesis (active or passive dispersal along watersheds
best explains the phylogeographical patterns observed)
cannot be rejected. The implications for understanding
disease transmission, however, might be considerable.
This is because our findings now allow for incorporating
genetically-derived snail data in models of disease transmission. Acknowledging that further studies are necessary for a better understanding of dispersal pathways in
space and time, we suggest using an anisotropic cost
distance measure of O. h. robertsoni in future analyses,
including network-based transmission models [42].

Conclusions
Our multi-locus genetic analyses of the Schistosoma
japonicum snail host Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni
in a formerly endemic schistosomiasis area revealed a
deep, complex and hierarchical structure, likely reflecting a long and diverse evolutionary history. It is characterized by population, watershed, regional and large
scale effects acting together to different degrees. Despite
the strong admixing of genotypes at various spatial
scales, we were able to identify local processes affecting
distribution patterns. Our data indicate that small and
especially medium-level watershed scaling orders well
reflect the observed population structures, with clear
isolation-by-distance effects along waterways being evident. In addition, all snail lineages within our study
area, i.e., at the regional level, appear to be endemic,
supporting the concept of endemic schistosomiasis
areas. Finally, large scale effects are evident (e.g., the
presence of phylogenetic subclades), likely reflecting secondary contact of previously isolated lineages. In fact,
our study raises the question about the existence of two

Page 11 of 18

distinct and partly sympatric Oncomelania species in
western China. At least from a strictly phylogenetic
standpoint, such a possibility can no longer be dismissed
outright.
Finally, there are several important implications for
understanding disease transmission arising from our
study:
1) From a co-evolutionary standpoint, the existence of
two distinct phylogroups in O. h. robertsoni argues for
future studies relative to the distinctness of the respective parasites.
2) The admixing of previously isolated regional groups
(here subclades Ia and Ib) calls for testing for increased
rates of susceptibility to infection in these populations.
3) The high level of snail lineage endemicity within a
formerly endemic schistosomiasis area warrants future
geospatial analyses for a better understanding of the
boundaries of transmission areas.
4) Most, but not all, snail populations are genetically
highly diverse, raising questions about the effect of mollusciciding campaigns on snail population structure, and
thus susceptibility to infection.
5) Local snail dispersal mainly occurs along waterways
and can be best described by using cost distance, thus
potentially enabling a more precise modelling of snail,
and therefore parasite, dispersal.
While our study demonstrates the usefulness of phylogeographical analyses for reconstructing medium- and
long-term evolutionary histories of snail host populations, it also calls for future longitudinal studies to better clarify short-term dynamics. These studies should
also be based on larger sampling sizes per population to
enable sophisticated population genetic analyses for better addressing local snail dynamics and the impact of
demographical effects.
Moreover, as O. h. robertsoni shows a high degree of
diversity and as the fraction of noise in AFLP data sets
increases with genetic distance, we suggest that future
larger-scale studies utilize additional markers, such as
microsatellites, in order to better unravel the deeper,
“stirred” structures in this taxon.

Methods
Study area and field work

The Deyang-Mianyang area is located in the northwestern part of the Sichuan Basin (Sichuan Province). Being
separated from the Tibetan Plateau by the Longmenshan
Fault, the area is characterized by a series of low hills
and alluvial plains. Several major rivers flow into the
Yangtze River, which passes through the southern part
of Sichuan Basin.
Our sampling design comprised 18 sites located in
Anxian, Jinyang and Zhongjiang counties (Figure 1,

Populations collected and genetic markers studied in Oncomelania h. robertsoni from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Previously studied populations are marked
with asterisks: *Wilke et al. [26], **Attwood et al. [29].

is approximately 63 km. Amphibious Oncomelania
hupensis robertsoni specimens in each site were handcollected in April 2008 from vegetation along small irrigation channels (< 3 m across at bank flow) and immediately preserved in 80% ethanol. Strictly for semantic
reasons, specimens coming from the same site are here
referred to as a population.
For assessing local phylogroup distribution (see Goal
1), we also included in our study additional specimens
of O. h. robertsoni from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces
(Table 3) for comparison. These specimens, previously
studied by Wilke et al. [26], largely cover both the

distribution area of the subspecies and its overall genetic
variation.
Watershed classification and calculation of geographical
distances among populations

For analyses of genetic structure and for assessing the
role of physical barriers (see Goal 2), a hierarchical
watershed assignment was inferred from a digital elevation model (DEM) using Spatial Analyst in ArcGIS 9.2
(ESRI), with scaling orders being determined using
Strahler stream ordering (Figure 6) [43]. Study sites
were classified according to watershed membership

Hauswald et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:206

based on five scales of watersheds, with the largest based
on the highest Strahler stream order (stream order 9)
and the smallest based on the lowest stream order in
which changes in watershed classification were observed
(stream order 4, for which almost all sites resided in
their own watershed) (Figure 6).
Geographical distance variables among study sites
were calculated for testing patterns of snail dispersal
under different isolation-by-distance scenarios (see Goal
3). Distance scenarios include A) simple straight-line
Euclidean distances, B) least-cost distances, (isotropic)
and C) least-cost distances taking vertical distance and
direction into account (anisotropic) (see Table 4). All
Euclidean and cost distances were calculated using Spatial Analyst in ArcGIS 9.2. Euclidean distance was the
simple straight-line distance between each pair of study
sites, not including elevation. Straight-line distance is
known to ignore the influence of heterogeneous landscape and topographic factors [42], thus alternative distance measures were generated to test the influence of
streams and topology on snail dispersal. The isotropic
least-cost distances were based on on-stream versus off-

stream movement, with the least-cost distance model
favouring on-stream movement over off-stream movement by an order of magnitude penalty for each offstream distance unit. To incorporate the influence of
uphill/downhill and upstream/downstream movements,
on-stream versus off-stream weights and vertical weights
were combined into four alternative models, which we
refer to as anisotropic owing to their directional dependence related to slope. The four models used binary or
linear vertical response functions, and two weighting
approaches (Table 4). For binary anisotropic models, all
positive slopes (uphill) were weighted as more costly, by
a factor of ten, than negative slopes (downhill). For linear anisotropic models, the most extreme uphill slope in
the DEM was weighted as ten times as costly as the
steepest downhill slope, transitioning linearly between
the two values [44]. Off-stream versus on-stream movement in these models was weighted either as described
above for the isotropic model (one order of magnitude
weighting difference: “10:1”), or two orders of magnitude
("100:1”). Moreover, two different measures of distance
were used for all isotropic and anisotropic model

variants, the cost distance and the proportion of the
least-cost path that consisted of onstream segments, the
latter emphasizing the importance of paths dominated
by stream cells (Table 4). Finally, for two other isotropic
distance models were explored: the cumulative distance
of on-stream segments, and Euclidean distance along
the least-cost path.
DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from 207 ethanol preserved specimens using parts of the foot muscle or
whole animals. For details of the CTAB isolation protocol used see Wilke et al. [26]. Final isolation products
were diluted in 40 μl of purified water, and quantity and
quality of DNA determined using a Thermo Scientific
Nanodrop
2000
micro-volume
UV-VIS
spectrophotometer.
DNA vouchers are stored at -80°C in the University of
Giessen Systematics and Biodiversity collection (UGSB).
Note that individual specimens typically had to be
destroyed during DNA isolation. Therefore, high-resolution images of the respective specimens were generated
using the digital microscope Keyence VHX-600, and
deposited in the UGSB database.
PCR and DNA sequencing

To explore intraspecific diversity and evolutionary relationships among populations, a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was sequenced.
Forward and reverse primers for PCR amplification and
DNA sequencing were LCO1490 [45] and COR722b
[46]. Bidirectional determination of sequences was performed either on a Long Read IR2 4200 sequencer (LICOR, Lincoln, NE, USA) using the Thermo Sequenase
Fluorescent Labeled Primer Cycle Sequencing kit
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) or
on a ABI 3730 XL sequencer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using the Big Dye Terminator Kit (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Forward and reverse
sequences were then aligned and trimmed in BioEdit
7.0.9 [47], resulting in a 638 bp long overlapping fragment of the COI gene.
All newly generated sequences for specimens from the
Deyang-Mianyang area were deposited at GenBank
(JN818846-JN818999). For accession numbers of the
remaining ingroup sequences (prefix “GB”) see Wilke et
al. [26].
AFLP genotyping

For micro-scale analyses of the genetic structure of O. h.
robertsoni within the Deyang-Mianyang area, genomewide ncDNA was studied applying the AFLP method
with the protocol being slightly modified from the one
suggested by Vos et al. [48]. Major steps are as follows:

Page 14 of 18

1) Digestion and ligation were performed simultaneously in a total reaction volume of 10 μl containing
ddH2O, 100X bovine serum albumin, 10X reaction buffer, 0.2 μl of 5 μM EcoRI and MseI adapter each, MseI
(4 u/μl) and 0.16 μl EcoRI enzyme (20 u/μl), 400 u/μl
T4 ligase, and 1 μl genomic DNA. The mixture was
incubated for 12 hours at 37°C and products were
checked on 1% agarose gels.
2) Ligated products were diluted 1:40 and an initial
selective amplification step was performed in a 13 μl
reaction mixture containing ddH2O, 1.3 μl ThermoPol
buffer (10X), 1.5 μl dNTPs (2.0 mM each), 0.1 μl preselective primers EcoRI (+1) and MseI (+1 or +2 selective bases) (each 75 ng/μl), 0.2 μl MgCl (2.5 μM), 0.1 μl
taq polymerase (5 u/μl), and 1 μl ligated product.
Cycling conditions comprised 2 min at 50°C, 3 min at
94°C, 30 cycles with each 30 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 56°C
and 1 min at 72°C, and a final elongation step of 7 min
at 72°C.
3) Final selective amplification was conducted in a 6 μl
reaction mix containing ddH2O, 0.6 μl ThermoPol buffer (10X), 0.6 μl dNTPs (2.0 mM each), 0.06 μl taq polymerase (5 u/μl), 0.10 μl and 0.18 μl of 700 nm and 800
nm fluorescent labeled EcoRI primers (1 μM), respectively, and 0.20 μl MseI primers (10 μM, +3 or +4).
Exact sets of primer pairs (with only selective bases indicated) were: EcoRI-AAC/MseI-ACTA, EcoRI-AAC/MseIACAT, EcoRI-AAC/MseI-CAC, EcoRI-AAC/MseI-CAT,
EcoRI-AGC/MseI-ACAT, EcoRI-AGC/MseI-CAC, EcoRIAGC/MseI-CAT and EcoRI-AGC/MseI-CGT (also see

studies of 20 primers sets, these combinations were
found to generate clear AFLP profiles. Primer combinations with low reproducibility and/or producing fuzzy
bands were discarded. Cycling reactions comprised 10
cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 65°C, and 1 min at
72°C, followed by 25 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at
55°C, and 1 min at 72°C. Final extension lasted 2 min at
72°C.
Selective amplified fragments were separated on a
6.5% LI-COR KBPLUS denaturing polyacrylamide gel utilizing a LI-COR LongRead IR 2 4200 sequencer. AFLP
bands and respective sizing standard (LI-COR Biosciences) were digitally captured with the e-Seq v. 2.0
software (LI-COR Biosciences).
Fragment scoring of AFLP profiles for 135 specimens
of O. h. robertsoni was performed with the SagaMx module (LI-COR Biosciences), with bands recognized as present (1) or absent (0).
To obtain correctly sized bands, to minimize the
effects of homoplasious fragments (see Discussion), and
to further increase reproducibility, only bands ranging
from 65-375 bp in length and being present in at least
two samples were recognized and compared to the sizing standard [49]. Using eight primer combinations, a
total of 237 highly polymorphic bands (ranging from 2240 bands per combination) were screened.
Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses (COI gene)

The phylogenetic data set consisted of 154 specimens
from the Deyang-Mianyang area, additional 66 specimens from Sichuan und Yunnan provinces as well as
the 3 outgroup taxa (O. minima [GenBank: DQ212795],
O. h. hupensis [GenBank: AF254488] and O. h. tangi
[GenBank: DQ212796]).
To avoid a bias of model selection and subsequent
phylogenetic analyses towards population-level relationships, we reduced our data set of 220 O. h. robertsoni
sequences to a subset of 74 ingroup sequences, representing all populations and most haplotypes.
From this “full” data set, we inferred the best-fit model
of sequence evolution based on the Bayesian information criterion by conducting dynamical likelihood ratio
tests in jMODELTEST 0.1.1 [50].
We then ran two phylogenetic analyses in order to
test whether the molecular clock hypothesis is
accepted (i.e., whether a strict molecular clock can be
assumed). As model-choice criterion, we used the
Bayes factor (BF) [51]), that is, the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of two given models. If the models
differ by a factor of 2 ln(BF) > 6, then there is strong
evidence against the null model [52]. The marginal
likelihood can be approximated by using the harmonic
mean of the likelihood values from a MCMC sample.
An advantage of the Bayes factor compared to

Page 15 of 18

likelihood ratio tests is that it allows for comparison of
non-nested models [52]. In order to generate the Bayes
factor, we conducted Bayesian Inference analyses (strict
clock vs. relaxed clock assumption) in BEAST v1.6.1
[53]. The nucleotide substitution model to be applied
was the one obtained from jMODELTEST (i.e., the
HKY+I+Γ model) and the clock model either a strict
clock or a relaxed clock with an uncorrelated exponential distribution. MCMC progress was monitored with
TRACER 1.5.0 [53], and the analysis was terminated
after stationarity of chain likelihood values was
achieved (i.e., after 10.000.000 generations). The posterior output of each of the models was then used to
estimate the Bayes factor in order to decide whether a
strict clock can be assumed. With harmonic means of
-ln = 2865.2 and -ln = 2828.4 for the strict clock and
relaxed clock models, respectively (inferred with TRACER), and a Bayes factor of 73.6, there is strong evidence against the strict clock model. Therefore, the
relaxed-clock model was applied to subsequent analyses of the full data set.
In order to achieve an optimal reconstruction of phylogroup distribution within the Deyang-Mianyang area
(see Goal 1), we generated a second ("reduced”) dataset
by keeping only Deyang-Mianyang specimens as
ingroups and one specimen each of O. minima and O.
h. hupensis as outgroups. This data set was subjected to
the same analyses as the full data set. Based on the best
fit HKY model, the harmonic means of the strict clock
and relaxed clock models were -ln = 1800.4 and -ln =
1800.0, respectively. The resulting Bayes factor of 0.8
indicated no evidence against the strict clock model. We
therefore considered this reduced data set suitable for
molecular clock analyses under a strict clock
assumption.
For estimating the age of the most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) of the Deyang-Mianyang specimens
(see Goal 2), we used the molecular clock approach suggested by Wilke et al. [54]. In the absence of an Oncomelania-specific molecular clock rate, we utilized the
trait-specific COI Protostomia rate of 1.24% ± 0.22%
My-1 for the HKY model [54]. This external clock rate,
applicable to strict clock models only, has been shown
to be valid in protostomian taxa with a similar biology
and life-history (i.e., dioecious tropical or subtropical
taxa with a generation time of approximately one year
and a body size of approximately 2-50 mm). All these
conditions are met by O. h. robertsoni. We then calculated the 95% confidence interval for our time estimate
incorporating both the error of the phylogenetic analysis
(i.e., the node-depth variation of individual trees calculated in BEAST) and the error of the clock rate (see
above) by utilizing a propagation of uncertainty
approach [54].

Hauswald et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:206
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/206

Note that we did not correct our clock estimates for
ancestral polymorphism since the trait-specific Protostomia COI clock applied here is also not corrected [54].
As this external clock is based on phylogenetic events
that are, on average, 3 My old, there might be a small
bias towards overestimation of divergence times for
events younger than 3 My and towards underestimation
for events older than that.
Phylogeographical analyses (COI gene)

For phylogeographical analyses (both network analysis
and test for genetic structure) of O. h. robertsoni, we
used COI sequences from a total of 154 specimens
(here called the “Deyang-Mianyang” data set). In a first
step we constructed a statistical parsimony haplotype
network utilizing the program TCS 1.21 [55] for understanding the degree of populating admixing (see Goal
2). The analysis was set to run with a connection limit
of 95%.
In order to assess the degree of populating admixing
as well as possible demographic effects of watersheds in
O. h. robertsoni (Goal 2) and to test different isolationby-distance scenarios (Goal 3), we analysed the genetic
structure by performing hierarchical AMOVAs. The significance of the F statistic was tested by generating
null-distributions based on 10,000 permutations of the
original data set using Arlequin 3.5.1.2 [56]. Hierarchical
grouping variables were (i) between groups of populations, (ii) between populations, (iii) within populations.
An alternative test for group structure was performed
using spatial analyses of molecular variance implemented in SAMOVA 1.0 [57] with significance being tested
by 1,026 permutations. The optimal number of groups
(K) was revealed by increasing K until the variance
among geographically adjacent groups relative to the
total variance (FCT) reached a maximum value [57].
Then, for inferring possible past demographic and
spatial expansion events (Goal 2), we studied the demographic and spatial histories of O. h. robertsoni populations within those clades that did not exceed the 95%
connection limit of the network analysis (see Result section). Utilizing mismatch analyses [58-60], we attempted
to link the amount and distribution of sequence differences to relative time since divergence.
As a demographic expansion model requires panmixia
(whereas a spatial expansion model does not), we first
tested the null hypothesis of a random distribution of
different haplotypes among populations (i.e., panmixia).
Using the exact test as suggested by Raymond & Rousset [61] and implemented in Arlequin 3.5.1.2, significance was evaluated by running the Markov chain for
1,000,000 steps.
Finally, we attempted to detect possible correlations
between genetic and geographic distances (see Goal 3),

Page 16 of 18

conducting simple Mantel’s matrix correlation tests [62]
with the geographical distance variables suggested in
Table 4 and K2P genetic distances calculated in Arlequin 3.5.1. For all runs, the null hypothesis of no correlation between geographic and genetic distances was
tested in TFPGA [63] with 10,000 permutations.
Phylogeographical analyses (AFLP)

For AFLP-based phylogeographical analyses of O. h.
robertsoni from the Deyang-Mianyang area, we used
profiles from a total of 135 specimens.
First, we performed a NeighborNet analysis with the
program SplitsTree 4.10 [64] in order to visualize relationships among AFLP genotypes for a better understanding of the degree of populating admixing (Goal 2).
The NeighborNet algorithm, which is based on maximum likelihood genetic distances, was chosen here
because empirical data show that it works well in resolving large or divergent data sets [64].
For studying the correlation of population structure
and physical barriers (see Goal 2), we performed
AMOVA and SAMOVA analyses similar to the ones
conducted for our COI data set.
Finally, we attempted to test patterns of dispersal
under different isolation-by-distance scenarios (Goal 3)
by using Mantel tests based on Nei’s [65] unbiased
genetic distances calculated in Genalex 6.4 [66].
In addition, we applied a Mantel test to infer the correlation between genetic distances generated based on
the COI gene and AFLP data.
