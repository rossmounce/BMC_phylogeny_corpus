Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important human pathogen affecting around 3% of the human
population. In Brazil, it is estimated that there are approximately 2 to 3 million HCV chronic carriers. There are few
reports of HCV prevalence in Rondônia State (RO), but it was estimated in 9.7% from 1999 to 2005. The aim of this
study was to characterize HCV genotypes in 58 chronic HCV infected patients from Porto Velho, Rondônia (RO),
Brazil.
Methods: A fragment of 380 bp of NS5B region was amplified by nested PCR for genotyping analysis. Viral
sequences were characterized by phylogenetic analysis using reference sequences obtained from the GenBank (n
= 173). Sequences were aligned using Muscle software and edited in the SE-AL software. Phylogenetic analyses
were conducted using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC) to obtain the MCC tree using BEAST
v.1.5.3.
Results: From 58 anti-HCV positive samples, 22 were positive to the NS5B fragment and successfully sequenced.
Genotype 1b was the most prevalent in this population (50%), followed by 1a (27.2%), 2b (13.6%) and 3a (9.0%).
Conclusions: This study is the first report of HCV genotypes from Rondônia State and subtype 1b was found to be
the most prevalent. This subtype is mostly found among people who have a previous history of blood transfusion
but more detailed studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to understand the HCV dynamics in the
population of Rondônia State, Brazil.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects around 170 million
people, 3% of the world population, and is considered
a worldwide public health problem [1,2]. The HCV
genome is a 9.4 Kb single stranded RNA sequence
with two untranslated regions at both ends (5 ‘UTR
and 3’ UTR) [3]. This coding region contains a single
open reading frame encoding a polyprotein of approximately 3,000 amino acids that originate at least 10
viral gene products (C, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A,
NS4B, NS5A, NS5B) [4,5].

The virus represents the genus Hepacivirus of the
family Flaviviridae [6] and it is classified into six major
genotypes (1 to 6) and more than 80 subtypes. HCV
genotypes may show extensive subtype diversity in some
regions of the world, representing the spreading of this
epidemic [7,8]. These genotypes differ by 31 to 34% in
their nucleotide sequence and by around 30% in their
amino acid sequence. Accurate HCV genotyping can be
used for predicting response to anti-viral therapy, as
genotypes 1 and 4 are less likely than genotypes 2 and 3
to respond to interferon [9].
Molecular tests are essential for confirmation of persistent HCV infection and to monitor and verify the
success or failure of therapy. The advantages of these
tests include the possibility of early diagnosis in acute
viral infection, diagnosis of infection in patients unable

to mount antibody response, and confirmation of active
infection [10]. Besides its use for determining the type
or duration of HCV, HCV genotyping is useful epidemiological studies, as genotypes vary among geographical regions and among different risk groups [11,12].
Sequencing of the NS5B has been standardized and
used for identification of HCV subtypes, as the region
contains subtype-specific motifs, and it is also appropriate for epidemiological applications [13].
In Brazil, it has been estimated that around 1.5% of
the Brazilian population (> 2.5 million people) is antiHCV positive [14,15]. Distribution of cases of chronic
hepatitis C by transmission routes from 1998 to 2006
showed 21% of cases associated with intravenous drug
use and 16% with blood transfusion, but in 40% of cases
there was not any known risk factor [16]. An extensive
review on HCV infection data in Brazil showed the following prevalence in healthy adults and/or blood donors
in the different Brazilian regions: 0.9 to 2.4% (North),
1.7 to 3.4% (Northeast), 1.0 to 1.4% (Middle West), 0.8
to 2.8% (Southeast) and 1.1 to 2.1% (South) [17].
Rondônia (RO) State, in North-Western Brazil, has
characteristics of a highly endemic region for viral hepatitis. A study carried out with the local population in
the Madeira River at Porto Velho-RO showed the prevalence of hepatitis C reached 7.4% [18]. Ferrari et al. [19]
investigated HCV seroprevalence among Karitiana
Indians living in Rondônia and found that the HCV prevalence was 1.7%. According to the Brazilian Ministry of
Health, during the period from 1999 to 2005, 1831 cases
of hepatitis C were confirmed in the North Region and
400 (21.8%) of these cases were from Rondônia [18].
Recently, we reported the genotype distribution of
HBV in Rondônia [20] and the present study is the first
report on HCV distribution in this state. The aim of
this study was to characterize the HCV genotypes circulating in Rondônia State (RO), Brazil.

Valencia, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The synthesis of the complementary DNA
(cDNA) was made immediately after the RNA extraction. To avoid false-positive results, rigorous procedures
proposed for nucleic acid amplification diagnostic techniques were followed [21].
Synthesis of the complementary DNA (cDNA)

The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed using
the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase of Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus and random primers. The final volume
of the reaction was 60 μL with the following concentrations: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dNTP (10 mM), 450
ng random primers, 30 units RNAse enzyme inhibitor
(RNase OUT™) and 300 units M-MLV. Samples were
submitted to the following temperature cycles: 70°C for
10 minutes, 25°C for 15 minutes, 37°C for 60 minutes
and 95°C for 15 minutes in a thermocycler (Eppendorf
Mastercycler ®, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

Methods
This study was carried out in the state of Rondônia,
Brazil (Figure 1) and included 58 anti-HCV positive
patients (29 males, 29 females, age ranging from 27 to
85 years old). All patients signed a consent form for this
study. The samples were collected between January 2007
and October 2009 in the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation,
Fiocruz Noroeste, Porto Velho-RO, Brazil. Data on previous blood transfusion and presence of liver cirrhosis
or fibrosis were obtained from the review of each
patient medical data.

Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) were carried out in
two stages, first and second PCR, aiming to increase the
reaction sensitivity. The NS5B (380 bp) region was
amplified for genotyping analysis. Amplification primers
and cycling conditions are previously described [22,23].
Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 50 μL.
The cDNA (5 μl) was added to 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH =
8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP
(10 mM), 0.4 pmol/μL of each primer, and 2.5 units
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase. All the reagents used
were from Invitrogen ™ Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA.

kit - Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The
quality of each electropherogram was evaluated using

sequences were obtained by alignment of both
sequenced strands (sense and antisense) using CAP3
software available at the web page Eletropherogram

phph/.
Phylogenetic Analysis

The HCV sequences were genotyped by phylogenetic
reconstructions using reference NS5B sequences from
each HCV subtype obtained from GenBank (n = 173).
The sequences were aligned using Muscle software
[26] and edited in the SE-AL program (available at
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/). Phylogenetic
analyses were conducted using the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation implemented in
BEAST v.1.5.3 [27] by both relaxed uncorrelated lognormal and relaxed uncorrelated exponential molecular
clock using the best model of nucleotide substitution
(GTR+G+I) obtained by MODELTEST [28]. Twenty
million generations were run to obtain the convergence of parameters. The maximum clade credibility
(MCC) tree was obtained from summarizing the substitution trees and then it was removed 10% of burn-in
using Tree Annotator v.1.5.3 [27].

Results and Discussion
Among the 58 positive anti-HCV samples, only 22 were
positive by nested PCR for NS5B region.
After sequencing, the phylogenetic analyses in this
study showed that subtype 1b was the most prevalent in
this population (50%). Also, the subtypes 1a (27.3%), 2b
(13.6%) and 3a (9,0%) were detected in Rondônia State
(Figure 2). Sequences were deposed in GenBank at
accession numbers: HQ630386 - HQ630407.
Several studies were carried out to investigate the
HCV distribution in the different states and different
risk groups in Brazil [29-32]. Campiotto et al., [33]
reported that genotype 1 was the most frequently genotype found in all regions of Brazil. Specifically, in the
North region, genotype 1 was the most prevalent in
Amazonas and Acre states (78.0 and 64.3%, respectively), followed by genotype 3. Genotype 2 was only
observed in Amazonas state (7.1%). Also, genotype 1
predominates in the Southeastern Region of Brazil
where the prevalence is around 70% in the states of Rio

Page 3 of 5

de Janeiro and São Paulo [34-36], and 84% in Minas
Gerais [37]. In Salvador, Bahia state, genotype 3 was the
most common genotype (53.3%), followed by genotypes
1 (40%) and 2 (6.7%) but, as the number of positive
cases was small, other studies are necessary to confirm
the high frequency of genotype 3 in Salvador [15].
Another study in Piauí state, Brazil, found 49.0% of subtype 3a, 26.0% of subtype 1a, 24.0% of subtype 1b and
1.0% of subtype 2b [38]. Furthermore, subtypes 1a
(34.3%), 1b (30.0%) and 3a (25.7%) were frequently
found in Brazilian blood donors, while 2b was rare, and
2a was not detected [39].
HCV subtypes found in Brazil represent several
independent lineages probably originated from multiple introductions of each subtype into Brazil; analysis
of Brazilian-specific clades provides a more accurate
representation of the population dynamics of HCV in
the country [40]. Furthermore, as Brazil is a large
country with many different population backgrounds,
a large variation in the frequencies of HCV genotypes
is expected throughout its territory. In this study, as
shown in Figure 2, phylogenetic analyses showed that
subtypes 1a and 2b sequences from Rondônia clustered together but subtypes 1b and 3a have a more
heterogeneous distribution along the tree. Since there
are only 22 sequences reported in this study we cannot make any further inferences about HCV genetic
variability.
Subtype 1b is mostly found among older members of
the population who have a previous history of blood
transfusion [41-43] but in this study the patients did
not report previous blood transfusion. Also, subtype 1b
is associated with a higher rate of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis, and with a poorer response to treatment with a-interferon than genotypes 2 or 3 [16]. In
this study, all patients were naïve and two subtype 1a
patients, as well as one subtype 1b patient had
cirrhosis.
Genotype 3 has been associated with transmission
through intravenous drug users what could have contributed to a large dissemination of this genotype [44].
The two subtype 3a female patients did not report
previous drug injection and it is possible that this
association is not valid in this region. However,
the present study was not intended to analyze the
association between HCV subtypes and routes of
transmission.
In conclusion, this study is the first report on HCV
genotypes from Rondônia state where subtype 1b was
found to be the most prevalent. There was not any data
from this region previously published. Rondônia state is
one region where the population is growing faster in
