Characterization of the genome of bald cypress

Abstract
Background: Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum var. distichum) is a coniferous tree of tremendous ecological and
economic importance. It is a member of the family Cupressaceae which also includes cypresses, redwoods, sequoias,
thujas, and junipers. While the bald cypress genome is more than three times the size of the human genome, its 1C
DNA content is amongst the smallest of any conifer. To learn more about the genome of bald cypress and gain insight
into the evolution of Cupressaceae genomes, we performed a Cot analysis and used Cot filtration to study Taxodium
DNA. Additionally, we constructed a 6.7 genome-equivalent BAC library that we screened with known Taxodium genes
and select repeats.
Results: The bald cypress genome is composed of 90% repetitive DNA with most sequences being found in low to
mid copy numbers. The most abundant repeats are found in fewer than 25,000 copies per genome. Approximately
7.4% of the genome is single/low-copy DNA (i.e., sequences found in 1 to 5 copies). Sequencing of highly repetitive Cot
clones indicates that most Taxodium repeats are highly diverged from previously characterized plant repeat sequences.
The bald cypress BAC library consists of 606,336 clones (average insert size of 113 kb) and collectively provides 6.7-fold
genome equivalent coverage of the bald cypress genome. Macroarray screening with known genes produced, on
average, about 1.5 positive clones per probe per genome-equivalent. Library screening with Cot-1 DNA revealed that
approximately 83% of BAC clones contain repetitive sequences iterated 103 to 104 times per genome.
Conclusions: The BAC library for bald cypress is the first to be generated for a conifer species outside of the family
Pinaceae. The Taxodium BAC library was shown to be useful in gene isolation and genome characterization and
should be an important tool in gymnosperm comparative genomics, physical mapping, genome sequencing, and
gene/polymorphism discovery. The single/low-copy (SL) component of bald cypress is 4.6 times the size of the
Arabidopsis genome. As suggested for other gymnosperms, the large amount of SL DNA in Taxodium is likely the
result of divergence among ancient repeat copies and gene/pseudogene duplication.

Background
The conifer family Cupressaceae contains many remarkable and important trees including junipers, redwoods,
sequoias, cypresses, and thujas [1]. One Cupressaceae species that is of tremendous ecological importance to the
southeastern U.S. is bald cypress, Taxodium distichum (L.)
Rich var. distichum [2]. Bald cypress is the cornerstone
species in the aptly named “cypress swamps” where it
serves as a source of food and shelter for numerous and
sundry organisms [3]. Though native to the U.S. South,
bald cypress is a popular ornamental throughout much of
the world; indeed, it has been cultivated in Europe since at

least the mid 17th Century [4]. Bald cypress wood is extremely resistant to wind, water, pathogens, and pests, something that perhaps is not surprising when one considers
that individual trees may spend their entire life (sometimes
> 1500 years - [5]) partially submerged in water. The
highly durable wood of bald cypress is used in construction of boats, docks, bridges, and roofing shingles [6],
although the tree’s relatively slow growth-rate has limited
its use as a wood crop. Unlike most conifers, bald cypress
is deciduous with leaves that change from light green to
brown in the fall. Its attractive appearance and hardiness
have made it a popular ornamental throughout the eastern
U.S. [2].
The genus Taxodium consists of one to three extant
species, depending upon taxonomic preference. The
most conservative treatment places all trees in a single
species (T. distichum) with three varieties; specifically

bald cypress (T. distichum var. distichum), pond cypress
(T. distichum var. imbricarium), and Montezuma bald
cypress (T. distichum var. mexicanum). While the single
species treatment is phylogenetically warranted [7-9],
sociological reasons have kept the multi-species nomenclature in place - e.g., Montezuma bald cypress is the
national tree of Mexico [10].
The bald cypress 1C DNA content is 9731 Mb [11]
which places it amongst the smallest of conifer genomes [12]. Bald cypress possesses 2n = 2x = 22 chromosomes [13] and is a diploid like most members of
the Cupressaceae [12].
Taxodium has not been the subject of molecular mapping and/or EST sequencing. In the Cupressaceae, molecular research has largely focused on Cryptomeria
japonica, and molecular maps based upon EST, RFLP,
RAPD, and isozyme markers exist for this species [14-16].
However, these genetic maps cover only a small part of
the entire Cryptomeria genome.
To advance understanding of Taxodium and the
Cupressaceae in general, we utilized three experimental
tools. Specifically:
(1) Cot analysis - The study of DNA reassociation
kinetics in solution is known as Cot analysis [17]. It is one
of the earliest means of studying genome structure predating cloning and DNA sequencing techniques by several
years (see 18 for review). Cot analysis is based upon the
observation that the product of DNA concentration (C0),
reassociation time (t), and a “buffer factor” accounting for
cation concentration (δ) has a predictable effect on the
amount of reassociation occurring in a denatured DNA
sample [18]. The major unknown factor influencing reassociation is the underlying sequence composition of the
DNA. Consequently, one can indirectly study genome
sequence composition by exploring how changes in C0tδ
(known by the colloquialism “Cot”) influence reassociation. Typically, a graph is created in which the fraction of
reassociated DNA is plotted against the logarithm of Cot
(from Cot ~ 0 to Cot values at which reassociation is
essentially complete). The resulting scatter plot is analyzed
using nonlinear regression analysis, and a least-squares
curve is fit through the data. This graph, known as a Cot
curve, provides a visual representation of the genome.
Analysis of Cot data provides the number of kinetic components in a genome, the reassociation rate (k) of each
component, the fraction of the genome found in each
component, the kinetic complexity (i.e., estimated
sequence complexity) of each component, and each component’s average sequence iteration. Additionally, in some
instances the genome size of an organism can also be estimated through comparison of the k value for the single/
low copy component of the organism of interest with the
k and genome size of E. coli [19].

(2) Cot filtration (CF) - CF represents a merger between
Cot analysis and high-throughput DNA sequencing
[19-21]. In short, the results of a Cot curve are used to
guide fractionation of a genome into its kinetic components, and isolated components are sequenced in full or
part. The value of CF and other reduced-representation
sequencing techniques lies in their ability to enrich for
subsets of genomic DNA of interest [19,22]. Since the
majority of genes are single/low-copy in nature, CF has
been used to enrich for gene space including the promoters and introns missed by cDNA approaches [20,23,24].
Alternatively, sequencing of a highly repetitive component
represents a means of efficiently exploring the repetitive
landscape of a genome [25].
(3) BAC library analysis - Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) have been the most popular large-insert
cloning vectors for nearly 20 years [26], and ordered BAC
libraries (i.e., libraries in which clone is individually
archived) remain highly useful tools in modern genomics
research [27]. One can efficiently map molecular markers
to corresponding BACs via multiplex macroarray hybridization techniques or by using multiplex PCR strategies
[28-30]. By combining macroarray/PCR mapping data
with data from BAC end sequencing, DNA fingerprinting,
and/or sequencing of BAC pools, one can generate highly
accurate physical (DNA sequence) maps and identify
minimum BAC tiling paths representing whole or nearly
whole chromosomes [27]. Though construction of BAC
minimum tiling paths will likely become less important as
DNA sequencing becomes cheaper and faster, BAC
libraries will likely remain a key means of bridging gaps
and resolving anomalies in shotgun sequence-based scaffolds [31].
The bald cypress BAC library generated in this study
affords 6.7 genome equivalent coverage of the bald cypress
genome. Though BAC libraries exist for several Pinaceae
conifers [31-33], to our knowledge the bald cypress BAC
library is the first constructed for a Cupressaceae species.
The library was shown to be useful in gene isolation and
genome characterization. The Cot and CF-based repeat
analyses suggest that highly diverged, low-copy repeats
account for much of bald cypress’ genomic DNA.

Results
Cot analysis

The CotQuest [34] nonlinear regression model providing
the best fit of the renaturation kinetics data was a threecomponent fit in which outliers had been removed (using
CotQuest’s built in outlier detection) and the reassociation
rate (k) of the slowest reassociating component had been
fixed based upon the genome size of bald cypress. This
best fit Cot curve is shown in Figure 1 while the major
biological characteristics obtained from curve analysis are

Figure 1 Cot curve for bald cypress. (A) A least-squares curve (black line) was fit through the data points (gray circles) using the CotQuest
program of Bunge et al. [34]. The curve consists of highly repetitive (HR), moderately repetitive (MR) and single/low copy (SL) components,
characterized by fast, intermediate, and slow reassociation, respectively. Blue, green, and red diamonds mark the Cot1/2 values of the HR, MR,
and SL components. The brackets centered at a particular Cot1/2 marker show the “two Cot decade region” in which 80% of the sequences in
that component will renature [63]. The blue shaded region at the top of the curve shows the double-stranded HR DNA (plus foldback
sequences) isolated for sequencing. Biological data obtained from curve analysis is shown in Table 1. (B) The predicted individual renaturation
profiles of the HR component, MR component, and SL component are shown.

shown in Table 1. Of note, the curve is composed of
highly repetitive (HR), moderately repetitive (MR), and
single/low-copy (SL) components accounting for 47.0,
41.1, and 7.4% of the genome, respectively. Because the
best fit was obtained when the reassociation rate of the SL
component was fixed based upon genome size, the curve
cannot be used to produce an estimate of DNA content.
Assuming that the SL component has a repetition frequency of 1, the average repetition frequency of the DNA
in other components can be estimated by dividing their k
values by the k value of the SL component [35]. The mean
predicted repetition frequencies of sequences in the MR
and HR components are 61 and 2054, respectively.

For each component, 80% of the sequences in that
component will reassociate in the “two Cot decade
region” (TCDR) flanking the component’s Cot1/2 value,
i.e., if a component’s Cot1/2 is y, then 80% of sequences
can be found between 0.1y and 10y. Because k (and
hence Cot1/2 which is the inverse of k) can be directly
related to sequence copy number, one can use the
TCDR to predict the range in sequence iteration for
80% of the sequences in a particular component. For
example, the bald cypress MR component has a mean
repeat frequency of 61 while 80% of the MR sequences
are repeated from 6.1 to 610 times. Likewise, for the HR
component which has a mean repetition frequency of

Cot filtration

BAC library construction and characterization

743 high-quality HR capillary sequence reads were analyzed using the Sequence Read Classification Pipeline
(SRCP) of Chouvarine et al. [36]. As shown in Figure 2,
the vast majority of reads (72.49%) showed no obvious (S’
≥ 60) homology to previously characterized repeat
sequences, gene sequences, and/or each other. Chloroplast
DNA, rDNA, and “Probable Repeats” (i.e., sequences that
appear to be repetitive based upon their relative frequency
in the HR sequence set) each account for about 6-8% of
the HR reads. Only 0.54% of sequenced HR sequences
shared significant sequence identity with known mobile
elements.
The program MUST [37] was used to identify potential
miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs)
in the HR sequences. MITEs are non-autonomous DNA
elements characterized by terminal-inverted repeats, target-site duplications (direct repeats), and an internal
region with no coding sequence [38]. Those potential
MITEs found in sequence reads classified as “Unknown”
or “Probable Repeats” by the SRCP are provided in Additional file 1. Using the criteria described in the Materials
and Methods, 53 potential MITEs were identified. The
mean MITE length was 246 bp, the mean direct repeat

The bald cypress BAC library consists of 606,336 individually-archived clones in 1579 384-well microtiter
plates. The library was given the designation TDD_Ba in
accordance with the library naming standards used by
the Mississippi Genome Exploration Laboratory (MGEL;
see http://www.mgel.msstate.edu/dna_libs.htm), the
Clemson University Genomics Institute (http://www.
genome.clemson.edu), and the Arizona Genomics Institute (http://www2.genome.arizona.edu). The library and
its associated products are distributed by MGEL (http://
www.mgel.msstate.edu).
Periodically during BAC library construction, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis analysis was used to check the
insert size of randomly-selected NotI-digested BACs.
Inserts ranged in size from 10 kb to 202 kb (Figure 3A),
and the mean insert size for the library was 113 kb (Figure
3B). The origin of the BAC insert DNAs was confirmed by
Southern hybridization using radiolabeled bald cypress
genomic DNA as a probe. As shown in Figure 3C, there is
considerable variation in hybridization intensity between
BAC inserts (Figure 3C) that cannot be accounted for by
differences in DNA amount per lane (compare Figures 3B
and 3C). Those clones with the strongest hybridization
signals ostensibly contain more repetitive DNA than those
with weaker signals.
Approximately 1.8% of clones in the library were false
positives (i.e., they possessed a vector plasmid but had no
discernible insert). The proportion of false positive clones
was greater earlier in library construction - e.g., the first
660 plates had a false positive percentage of 3.05 while the
remaining 919 plates had a false positive percentage of
0.95. The addition of a “pre-electrophoresis” size-selection
step (see Materials & Methods) was likely responsible for
the reduced number of false positives in the latter threefifths of the library.
The level of chloroplast DNA contamination in the
library was estimated by macroarray hybridization. Four
loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) sequences representing different regions of the chloroplast genome [31] were used to
probe five 4 × 4 double-spotted bald cypress macroarrays.
We found that 2348 (approximately 2.5%) inserts of the
92,160 Taxodium clones represented on the macroarrays
contained chloroplast DNA. This is the highest level of
chloroplast contamination for any plant BAC library we
have constructed, but still within the range of reported
values (see reference [31] for discussion).
While macroarray screening with mitochondrial DNA
was not performed, sequencing of nuclear DNA prepared
using our nuclear DNA isolation protocol suggests that
mitochondrial DNA contamination is 10 to 100 times

less frequent than contamination from chloroplast DNA
(reference 31 and Figure 2).
After subtracting the fractions of false positive clones
and chloroplast DNA-containing clones, the number of
clones containing bald cypress nuclear DNA was estimated to be 580,263. Thus the fraction of clones in the
library containing nuclear DNA was 0.957 (i.e., 606,336
÷ 580,263 = 0.957), and the number of nuclear DNAcontaining clones on each macroarray was determined
to be 17,639 (i.e., 18,432 × 0.957). Using the average
insert size of 113 kb, the library contains approximately
6.74 genome equivalents of bald cypress nuclear DNA
[(580,263 × 113 kb) ÷ 9731 Mb = 6.74)]. This level of
genome equivalent coverage affords a 99.88% chance
that a particular genomic sequence of interest will be
found at least once in a library [see 39].
To further assess the quality and the utility of the
library, eight T. distichum var. distichum single-copy
gene sequences, employed previously in molecular phylogenetics research [40-42], were used to screen five 4 ×
4 macroarrays. The five macroarrays collectively represented 1.02 (rounded to 1.0 for simplicity) genome

equivalents of bald cypress nuclear DNA. The gene
sequences (Table 2) were used to design PCR primers
and/or overgo probes for each gene (Additional file 2,
Tables S1 and S2), and macroarrays were separately
screened with a pool containing the radiolabeled overgos
and a pool containing the radiolabeled PCR amplicons.
As shown in Table 3, the average number of positive

of the library in gene isolation, positive clones 1069I8,

revealed that clones 1069I8, 1052C3, and 1137O7 contained the Chi1, HemA, and Pat genes (in full or part),
respectively.
Library screening with repetitive sequences of bald
cypress

For estimation of repetitive DNA content, blots prepared
from pulsed-field gels of random NotI-digested BAC
clones were probed with radiolabeled Cot ≤ 1 M·s (i.e.,
Cot-1) DNA. Based on the Cot data, Cot-1 DNA should
contain sequences repeated, on average, 9523 times.
Among the 328 clones on the various Southern blots,
273 showed obvious hybridization signals using the Cot1 probe, i.e., approximately 83.2% of the BAC clones in
the library appear to have inserts containing repetitive
elements found hundreds to thousands of times in the
genome (data not shown).
To study the distribution of a particular retroelement in
the Taxodium genome, a 4 × 4 macroarray was screened
with an overgo probe (Additional file 2, Table S3)
designed from a bald cypress HR Cot-filtered sequence
[GenBank: ET185333] with high sequence identity (S’ =
128) to two Gingko biloba copia-like retroelement reverse
transcriptase sequences [GenBank: DQ054445, GenBank:
DQ054446]. Of the 17,639 nuclear DNA-containing clones
on the macroarray, 888 (i.e., 10.1%) exhibited hybridization
to the overgo which represents a reverse transcriptase
gene we have deemed TdCRT1 for Taxodium distichum
copia-like reverse transcriptase 1 (Figure 4). Densitometer
analysis of the macroarray suggests that TdCRT1 is found
in roughly 23,892 copies in the bald cypress genome. An
initial glance at TdCRT1 hybridization to macroarrays
suggests that the element is found in clusters, i.e., it is not
distributed randomly throughout the genome. To test this
hypothesis, we used the probabilistic “urn model” method
of Holst [43] as detailed in Shan et al. [44]. Using an average BAC insert size of 113 kb, an estimated 17,639 nuclear
DNA-containing clones per macroarray, and a genome
size of 9731 Mb, we calculated that each macroarray
represents about 0.205X coverage of the Taxodium genome [i.e., 17,639 · 113 kb)/9731 Mb = 0.205]. Thus one
would predict that one macroarray should contain 4,898
copies of TdCRT1 (i.e., 23,892 copies · 0.205 = 4,898). If
TdCRT1 distribution were indeed random, we would
expect that the distribution of clones lacking TdCRT1 (i.e.,
lacking hybridization signal) would approximate normality.
The mean number of clones expected to lack a TdCRT1-

portion of a bald cypress 4 × 4 macroarray probed with the TdCRT1

positive signals are indicated by closely adjoined dots of similar
hybridization intensity (e.g., colored circles). Presumably clones
exhibiting the most intense hybridization (e.g., clone in red circle)
contain the highest number of TdCRT1 sequences while clones with
intermediate or low numbers of TdCRT1 exhibit moderate and low
hybridization, respectively (e.g., clones in green and blue circles).

4,898), and pk is the probability of any copy of the element “falling” within a clone (i.e., 1/17,639). Insertion of
the preceding values into the equations produced a
mean of 13,362 clones per macroarray with a standard
deviation of 26. However, we determined that 16,751 of
the 17,639 clones on the macroarray did not exhibit
TdCRT1 hybridization. Consequently, the observed
number of clones lacking TdCRT1 hybridization is 642
times (16,751/26 = 642) the expected standard deviation
for a normal distribution, strongly supporting the premise that the distribution of TdCRT1 is not random.
Of note, nine overgos representing common Ty1copia-like or Ty3-gypsy-like repeats from loblolly pine
were hybridized to bald cypress macroarrays. None of

Discussion
The genome of bald cypress, a Cupressaceae conifer, is
three times the size of the human genome but only half
the size of the genomes of most Pinaceae conifers [12].
Bald cypress appears to be a diploid like its Pinaceae cousins and, since evidence suggests that conifers do not
likely require or utilize more genes than other seed plants
[45], a natural hypothesis is that the bald cypress genome
contains lots of repetitive, non-coding DNA. Our Cot
analysis supports this general tenet as the repetitive fraction of the bald cypress genome is substantial (HR + MR
= 90.5%). However, the HR and MR components of bald
cypress have relatively low mean repetition frequencies
(2054 and 61, respectively). The idea that bald cypress
repeats tend to be found in low copy numbers is supported by analysis of the HR sequences with the de novo
repeat detection functions of the Sequence Read Classification Pipeline (SRCP) [36]. SRCP analysis reveals that
only 6.2% of 743 bald cypress HR reads showed enough
sequence identity with each other to be grouped by the
SRCP into the “Probable Repeats” category. In comparison, SRCP evaluation of random Sanger sequence reads
from Sorghum bicolor (sorghum), a plant with a genome
one-thirteenth the size of bald cypress [46], resulted in
categorization of 27% of Sorghum reads as “Probable
Repeats” despite the fact that the Sorghum sequences
were not specifically enriched for repeats [36].
Why the Taxodium genome has so much low-copy
repetitive DNA is unknown. A reasonable guess is that
the majority of mobile element amplification events in
bald cypress occurred tens to hundreds of millions of
years ago, and since then element proliferation/activity
has been severely restricted. If mobile element amplification was suppressed long ago, the copies of each repetitive element would presumably begin to diverge until
they were eventually no longer readily recognizable as
being derived from the same source. Indeed, the limited
studies of mobile elements in conifers do indicate that
there is considerable sequence divergence among members of retroelement families [31,47,48]; moreover, much
of the DNA within sequenced regions of conifer genomes
lacks features characteristic of known mobile elements,
low-complexity repeats, or genes [31,49]. Since all conifers possess enormous genomes, it is possible that some
of the mobile element amplification events that underlie
the behemoth C-values of conifers occurred prior to the
divergence of the major conifer families; this idea should
be much easier to test once genome sequences become
available for conifers.
Only 0.54% of reads (i.e., four reads total) showed reasonable homology (S’ = 60) to previously annotated

transposons; top hits were to copia-like retroelements
from Ginkgo biloba (GenBank: DQ054445, GenBank:
DQ054446), Sequoiadendron giganteum (AJ290723), and
Picea glauca [GenBank: AF229252], and a gypsy-like element from Abies veitchii [GenBank: AJ002621]. The HR
read with the highest level of similarity to a previously
characterized retroelement [GenBank: ET185333] was
used to design an overgo probe (see Additional file 2,
Table S3) that was hybridized to bald cypress macroarrays. The element represented by the overgo, i.e.,
TdCRT1, was estimated to be present in approximately
23,892 copies per 1C genome. As described above, 80%
of HR sequences are present in copy numbers between
205.4 and 20,540. If half the remaining 20% of sequences
in the HR component reassociate after 10·Cot1/2, then
we would predict that the remaining half (i.e., 10%)
would reassociate prior to 0.1·Cot1/2. In other words, we
would expect less than 10% of HR sequences to have an
iteration frequency greater than 20,540. Since TdCRT1
has a frequency of 23,892 copies per genome, it seems
reasonable to assume that few, if any, genome sequences
are more redundant than TdCRT1. Statistical evaluation
of the distribution of TdCRT1 among clones on a macroarray suggests that it is found in a decidedly non-random
distribution throughout the bald cypress genome. That
one of the most redundant sequences in the 9.7 Gb Taxodium genome is found in only 23,892 copies and is distributed in a decidedly non-random fashion initially
struck us as a bit surprising. However, as Baucom et al.
[50] note, “Two of the many misconceptions about TE
(transposable element) properties in higher eukaryotes
are that they are highly repetitive and are randomly scattered about the genome.”
Our previous studies on the loblolly pine genome suggest that, as in bald cypress, the majority of pine repetitive
DNA sequences are highly diverged and ostensibly
ancient. However, in contrast to bald cypress, there appear
to be at least a few retroelement families in loblolly pine of
more pronounced conservation (and ostensibly of more
recent origin). For example, the retroelement IFG7 [51] is
found in 210,557 copies and accounts for about 5.8% of
the pine genome [31] while the Athila-like retroelement
Gymny is found in approximately 21,700 copies and
accounts for 1.3% of the loblolly pine genome [47].
Together, IFG7 and Gymny make up 1.54 Gb of the
loblolly pine genome, a value 9.8 times that of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome [52]. As the pine genome is
roughly twice the size of that of bald cypress, it is possible
that the activity of IFG-7, Gymny, and other mobile element families are, in part, responsible for the larger genome of loblolly pine (and other Pinaceae conifers)
compared to bald cypress.
The SL component of bald cypress accounts for 7.4% of
its genome. This is an amount 4.6 times the size of the

Liu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:553
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/553

Arabidopsis genome. Because conifers appear to have
functional gene numbers similar to those of diploid
angiosperms [45], it is possible that much of the SL DNA
of Taxodium is composed of repetitive elements that
have diverged to the point that they are now “singlecopy” in nature, and indeed, studies on other conifers
have suggested that the high sequence complexity of
their low-copy DNA is likely due, in part, to repeat divergence [31,47,48]. Duplication of genes and/or pseudogene production may also contribute to the size of the SL
component. It is interesting to note that the macroarray
hybridization results using probes for Taxodium “singlecopy” genes (Table 2) indicate that there are 1.4-1.5 positive clone hits per probe per estimated 1C genome
equivalent. This result could indicate that BAC library
coverage is actually greater than what we calculated
based on insert size and clone number or that the genome size of bald cypress is actually smaller than previously reported. Alternatively, some of our probes may
be hybridizing to multiple loci. Because our analysis was
based upon macroarray hybridization and not PCR, it is
also possible that some of the amplicon and/or overgo
probes we developed contain regions with significant
sequence identity to loci not amplified using the primers
from the previous phylogenetic studies. Such loci could be
paralogous genes or pseudogenes. Of note, pseudogenes
have been described in a number of Pinaceae conifers
including pines [49,53-56], larches [57], and spruces
[58,59]. In a recent examination of ten BAC sequences
from loblolly pine, Kovach et al. [49] found that pseudogenes were five times more common than genes with
potential protein coding functions - whether such a high
pseudogene level holds for the genome as a whole is
unknown. To our knowledge, pseudogenes have not been
reported in Cupressaceae conifers, although the amount
of sequence information for Cupressaceae is minute compared to that for Pinaceae. As a means of exploring
whether pseudogenes are common in bald cypress, we
plan to sequence Taxodium BAC clones including those
recognized by the probes listed in Table 2.
Hybridization of loblolly pine retroelement sequence
probes to macroarrays of Taxodium produced no positive
signals. This is not particularly surprising as fossil evidence
indicates that the Pinaceae and the Cupressaceae have
been separate lineages for roughly 250 million years [1].
Analysis of the bald cypress HR sequence with MUST
[37] resulted in detection of 53 potential MITEs (Additional file 1). None of the MITEs shared terminalinverted repeats, and hence each potential MITE was
considered a member of its own MITE family. Further
analysis of the potential MITEs will be facilitated by
sequencing of bald cypress BACs and random genomic
DNA.

Conclusions
We have explored the genome of bald cypress using several molecular techniques. Of particular note, we have
generated a BAC library for bald cypress. This is the first
large-insert library for a member of the Cupressaceae and
a logical tool in eventual sequencing and assembly of the
bald cypress genome. With regard to genome biology, the
nuclear DNA of bald cypress appears to be largely composed of relatively low-copy repeats. These low-copy
sequences may have arisen from ancient mobile element
amplification events followed by millions of years of
mobile element quiescence. Sequencing of BACs should
provide key information on gene structure while helping
to define the roles that gene duplication, pseudogenes, and
repeat sequence divergence have played in shaping the
Taxodium genome.
Methods
Plant materials and DNA isolation

Young leaves were collected from a bald cypress tree
located at 33° 27.2729’ N, 88° 47.5898’ W on the Mississippi State University campus, and nuclear DNA was isolated according to the protocol described in Additional file
3. The DNA was sonicated into fragments with a mean
length of 450 bp (Additional file 4), and metal ions were
removed from the DNA solution using Chelex-100 (Additional file 5). The fragmented DNA was ethanol precipitated and re-dissolved in 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer
(Additional file 6) for Cot analysis or 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0) for other uses.
Melting curve and Cot analysis

DNA preparation and melting analyses were performed
as described previously [60]. Cot analysis was performed
according to Peterson et al. [20,60]. Cot data was analyzed using the program CotQuest [34].
Cot filtration and highly repetitive DNA library
construction

From the Cot analysis we determined that the Cot1/2
value of the HR component was 4.64 M·s (Table 1). To
isolate the HR component and foldback DNA, a bald
cypress DNA sample was denatured and allowed to reassociate to Cot 6 M·s (rounded up from 4.64 M·s for simplicity). The resulting double-stranded DNA (Cot ≤ 6 M·s)
was isolated using hydroxyapatite chromatography and
ligated into either the pGEM T-Easy (Promega) or TOPO
TA (Invitrogen) cloning vector. The resulting recombinant
molecules were used to transform ElectroMAX DH10B
T1 Phage-Resistant E. coli cells (Invitrogen) according to
Peterson et al. [20]. HR clones were end-sequenced (single-pass) using an ABI 3730×l DNA analyzer. We obtained
high-quality reads for 743 clones. The HR clone sequences

represented by a gold highlighted internal sequence flanked on each
end by a terminal inverted-repeat sequence (green highlight) and a
target site duplication (direct repeat, yellow highlight).

HR sequence analysis

The HR sequence reads were analyzed using the Sequence
Read Classification Pipeline (SRCP) previously described
in Chouvarine et al. [36]. Additionally, the sequences were
evaluated using the miniature inverted-repeat transposable
element (MITE) identification tool MUST [37] with the
following parameters: minimum TIR length = 8 nt; maximum TIR length = 50 nt; minimum DR length = 2 nt;
maximum DR length = 30 nt; minimum MITE length =
100 nt; maximum MITE length = 1000 nt; minimum incluster identity = 1. In Figure 2, potential MITEs detected
by MUST were only included under the MITE heading if
they were categorized as either “Unknown” or “Probable
Repeat” by the SRCP. For a putative MITE in an SRCPclassified “Unknown” or “Probable Repeat” read, only the
length of the MITE itself (TIR and inter-TIR sequence)
was considered MITE sequence; the remainder of the
bases in the read were classified based upon the read’s
SRCP categorization.

BAC library construction and characterization

Young leaves were obtained from a bald cypress tree
located at 33° 27.4330’ N, 88° 47.3777’ W on the Mississippi State University campus. We have designated this
tree MSSTATE#1, and rooted cuttings from the tree have
been sent to the USDA’s Southern Institute for Forest
Genetics (Saucier, MS) for maintenance and distribution.
A BAC library was produced from MSSTATE#1 leaf
nuclear DNA according to Peterson et al. [61]. A “preelectrophoresis” step, as detailed in Magbanua et al. [31],
was added to the BAC library protocol during the sizeselections preceding the production of plates 661-919.
Introduction of the “pre-electrophoresis” step appears to
have led to a decrease in false positives clones in the latter
60% of the library compared to the first 40% (see Results).
Preparation of radiolabeled probes and macroarray
hybridization were conducted as described in Magbanua
et al. [31]. Southern hybridization was conducted using
standard techniques [62].
Assessment of repeats in BAC library

The macroarray image showing TdCRT1 hybridization
was analyzed using an AlphaInnotech densitometer.
Repeat copy numbers were estimated from macroarrays
as described in Magbanua et al. [31].
