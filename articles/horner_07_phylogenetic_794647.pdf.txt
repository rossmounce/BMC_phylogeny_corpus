Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic relationships between Lagomorpha, Rodentia and Primates and their
allies (Euarchontoglires) have long been debated. While it is now generally agreed that Rodentia
constitutes a monophyletic sister-group of Lagomorpha and that this clade (Glires) is sister to
Primates and Dermoptera, higher-level relationships within Rodentia remain contentious.
Results: We have sequenced and performed extensive evolutionary analyses on the mitochondrial
genome of the scaly-tailed flying squirrel Anomalurus sp., an enigmatic rodent whose phylogenetic
affinities have been obscure and extensively debated. Our phylogenetic analyses of the coding
regions of available complete mitochondrial genome sequences from Euarchontoglires suggest that
Anomalurus is a sister taxon to the Hystricognathi, and that this clade represents the most basal
divergence among sampled Rodentia. Bayesian dating methods incorporating a relaxed molecular
clock provide divergence-time estimates which are consistently in agreement with the fossil record
and which indicate a rapid radiation within Glires around 60 million years ago.
Conclusion: Taken together, the data presented provide a working hypothesis as to the
phylogenetic placement of Anomalurus, underline the utility of mitochondrial sequences in the
resolution of even relatively deep divergences and go some way to explaining the difficulty of
conclusively resolving higher-level relationships within Glires with available data and
methodologies.

Background
Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times within
the superorder Glires (Rodentia, and Lagomorpha)

remain controversial, with many discrepancies between
estimates from morphological, molecular and fossil data.
The problem is exacerbated both by the fact that Rodentia

represents the most abundant and diversified order of living mammals and by variations in molecular evolutionary
rate and mode in some families. For example, several
molecular studies have suggested paraphyly of Rodentia
or Glires [1-3], while others (and the majority of morphological data) support the monophyly of both groups [4-6].
Both molecular approaches and morphological analyses
have their limitations. Critics of conclusions based on
molecular characters cite the limited number of sequences
considered and the apparent dependence of conclusions
on the analytical methodologies employed, while adherents of molecular data point out that the predominantly
dental and cranial characters employed in morphological
analyses are likely subject to homoplastic evolution as a
result of shared ecological constraints. Some intra-ordinal
phylogenetic relationships in Rodentia also remain
poorly resolved. For example, while the monophyly of
many classically diagnosed Rodentia groups (Hystricognathi – a grouping of Myoxidae and Sciuridae – and the
Muroidea/Dipodidae group) have been supported by
molecular analyses (eg [4,7]), relationships between these
groups as well as the placement of a few under-studied
taxa (such as the Anomaluridae) are controversial. Discrepancies between molecular and other data are not
restricted to tree topologies. Molecular dating approaches
(typically employing mitochondrial DNA sequences)
have tended to provide estimates of divergence times
which conflict with inferences drawn from the fossil
record. More recently the availability of relaxed and local
molecular clock approaches [8], which allow evolutionary
rates to differ across the tree, has allowed some reconciliation of molecular and fossil derived divergence time estimates within Euarchontoglires [9,10].
In the current study, we have sequenced and analysed the
complete mitochondrial genome of Anomalurus sp. as a
representative of the Anomaluridae, a family of flying
squirrel-like rodents which possess two rows of pointed,
raised scales on the undersides of their tails and whose
cranial anatomy does not indicate a close relationship
with sciurid flying squirrels. Indeed, the phylogenetic
affinities of the Anomaluridae, which consists of three
extant genera and whose geographic distribution is currently restricted to central Africa, have remained enigmatic
owing both to the aforementioned weakness of morphological characters in the systematics of Rodentia and a relative lack of available molecular sequence data (currently
restricted to five nuclear and two mitochondrial gene
sequences). Previous studies based on molecular data
have suggested alternative phylogenetic placements for
Anomalurus, while weakly supporting various relationships between the Hystricognathi, the Sciuridae, and the
Muroidea/Dipodidae group [11-13], while morphological classifications have suggested almost all possible
placements for Anomalurus (reviewed in [14]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/16

We have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of the
protein coding regions of all available Primates, Lagomorpha and Rodentia mitochondrial genomes at both nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequence levels. We show
that the sequence data suggest a phylogenetic affinity
between Anomalurus and the Hystricognathi. However,
statistical tests of alternative tree topologies do not
exclude other phylogenetic hypotheses, either for the
placement of Anomalurus sp. or for higher-level relationships within Rodentia. These observations are at least partially explained by a Bayesian relaxed molecular dating
approach which generates estimates of divergence times
within Euarchontoglires that are compatible with fossil
and biogeographical data and suggest that a rapid evolutionary radiation within Glires occurred around 60 million years ago.

Results
The mitochondrial genome of Anomalurus
The mtDNA of Anomalurus is 16,923 bp long and presents
the common vertebrate gene organization. The entire
genome sequence has been submitted to the EMBL
sequence database under accession number AM_159537.
Start and end positions of all protein coding, tRNA and
rRNA genes were easily identifiable through homology
searches using characterized mammalian mitochondrial
protein sequences as probes. The control region (D-loop
containing region) is 1439 bp long and shows the typical
tripartite structure observed in mammals with the central
conserved domain (15,770–16,062) and the CSB domain
(16,063–16,923) both identifiable. Of the two conserved
blocks known to be located in the ETAS domain, ETAS1
and ETAS2 [15], only a 40 bp long conserved sequence
corresponding to ETAS1 can be identified (15641–
15681). Indeed, only this element is conserved across
Rodentia [16]. The CSB domain includes all the three
known conserved sequence blocks (CSB1, CSB2 and
CSB3), and contains a tandem repeat array made up of a
40-fold repetition of an 8 bp long monomer (CGTACAGC).
Phylogenetic analyses
While a concatenated dataset of unambiguously aligned
regions of H-strand protein sequences (all protein-coding
genes apart from NAD6) passed the compositional homogeneity test implemented in TREE-PUZZLE [17], many
corresponding DNA sequences failed the equivalent test.
Compositional heterogeneity was reduced by the removal
of third codon positions from the DNA dataset, although
several sequences still failed the chi square test. We have
previously shown that first position synonymous leucine
codon usage (Leu-SynP1) varies extensively between
mitochondrial genomes and is a source of compositional
heterogeneity [6]. Accordingly, we removed (Leu-SynP1)
codons from the alignment resulting in a dataset where

only sequences from the Cercopithecinae (Papio, Macaca,
Chlorocebus) failed the test of compositional homogeneity. Bearing this result in mind, phylogenetic analyses at
the DNA level were performed both in the presence and
absence of sequences from Primates.
Fig. 1 shows the Bayesian consensus tree of Euarchontoglires relationships inferred from protein sequences (with
Bayesian Posterior Probabilities (PP) and distance bootstrap (BP) values associated with branches). Relationships
recovered within Anthropoidea all have high bootstrap
and posterior support and are uncontroversial. However,
Primates emerge as a paraphyletic group with a clade
defined by Tarsius, Nycticebus and Lemur diverging before
the Dermoptera. Both the placement of Tarsius as sister to
Nycticebus and Lemur, and the paraphyly of primates have
been observed in other analyses of mitochondrial
sequences (e.g. [18,6]). Scandentia (represented by the
tree-shrew Tupaia) emerge basal to the Primates – Glires

respect to these relationships, we conducted Approximately Unbiased (AU) tests [19] of competing topologies
representing all plausible inter-relationships of Primates,
Dermoptera, and Scandentia. At the 5% confidence level,
the protein data exclude monophyletic primates regardless of whether Tarsius is sister to Anthropoidea or to
Lemur and Nycticebus, while the DNA data permit monophyly of primates with Tarsius placed as sister to Anthropoidea (P = 0.059) or to Lemur and Nycticebus (P = 0.178).
The protein (P = 0.062), but not the DNA sequences allow
Scandentia to emerge immediately basal to Primates/Dermoptera (see discussion) but both datasets exclude a sister
relationship between Scandentia and Dermoptera.

protein distance-based bootstrap support for this partition is low (30%). Inspection of bootstrap partitions
reveals that decay in support of Rodentia monophyly is
caused by the sequence of Anomalurus and to a lesser
extent those of Thryonomys and Cavia (Hystricognathi)
that have a tendency to cluster with the outgroup
sequences. Likewise, the monophyly of Glires receives
high posterior support but does not emerge on the bootstrap consensus tree, owing to a tendency of Lagomorpha
to emerge basal to the Rodentia/(Primates + Dermoptera)
divergence in some bootstrap datasets. In accordance with
other molecular studies [11,12], Bayesian analyses of protein sequences strongly support the monophyly of Hystricognathi, the monophyly of Myoxidae and Sciuridae and
the monophyly of the Muroidea/Dipodidae grouping (all
with BP = 100, PP = 1.0). In both Bayesian and distance
bootstrap trees, Anomalurus emerges as sister of the Hystricognathi. Both methods suggest that the Hystricognathi/
Anomalurus group is sister to a clade composed of Myoxidae/Sciuridae and the Muroidea/Dipodidae cluster. However, both the position of Anomalurus and the
interrelationships between super-families within Rodentia receive only moderate posterior or bootstrap support.
Bayesian analysis of the DNA data in the presence of the
Cercopithecinae sequences yielded an identical tree topology apart from the position of Anomalurus which emerged
as a poorly supported basal branch in the Primates/Dermoptera clade while Bayesian analyses of Glires, Scandentia and outgroup sequences alone generated an identical
topology for Glires as the protein sequences (not shown).
In order to evaluate the degree of support for alternative
hypotheses of relationships between Rodentia superfamilies, we generated a series of topologies where the
constitution and internal topology of uncontroversial
clades (outgroup, Primates/Dermoptera, Lagomorpha,
Muroidea/Dipodidae, Myoxidae/Sciuridae and Hystricog-

nathi) were constrained, but where inter-relationships of
these groups and the placement of Anomalurus were varied. These topologies were tested under the AU test of
alternative tree topologies. Selected results are shown in
Table 1. In brief, both the protein and DNA data reject (at
the 5% level) all topologies where Anomalurus is placed as
sister to the Myoxidae/Sciuridae group, while all topologies depicting Anomalurus as sister to either Hystricognathi
or the Muroidea/Dipodidae grouping are accepted as are
various topologies placing Anomalurus either as the basal
divergence among Rodentia or as sister to clades of Hystricognathi + Muroidea/Dipodidae, Hystricognathi + Myoxidae/Sciuridae or Muroidea/Dipodidae + Myoxidae/
Sciuridae. Rodentia monophyly is moderately supported
in that we were unable to identify acceptable topologies
depicting Rodentia as non-monophyletic apart from
those suggested by Bayesian analyses of the DNA data
(Anomalurus as a basal divergence among Primates) –
topologies where Anomalurus emerges as the basal branch
of Glires were rejected by the protein data (P = 0.048) but
were accepted by the DNA data. However, many topologies depicting non-monophyly of Glires (Lagomorpha
divergence prior to the Rodentia/(Primate/Dermoptera)
split, or Lagomorpha as sister to Tupaia – as suggested by
other authors using mitochondrial sequence data [20,21])
were accepted by the AU test.
Slow-fast method
Given the apparent lack of resolution of Rodentia infraordinal relationships afforded by the mitochondrial
sequence data and the tendency of the Anomalurus
sequence to emerge in unexpected positions, especially
for the DNA data, we wished to investigate whether undetected compositional or other types of systematic (or stochastic) biases manifested in faster evolving sites should
be responsible for apparent decay in the phylogenetic signal. Accordingly we have used a variation on the "Slow-

Fast" phylogenetic analysis methodology [22] where
faster evolving sites are progressively removed from the
protein alignment and bootstrap partitions recalculated.
In the presence of misleading signal derived from homoplasy or biases at fast evolving sites, we might expect support for correct basal splits to increase as signal from
slower evolving sites begins to predominate. We have
used the SiteVarProt methodology [23] to estimate sitespecific relative amino-acid substitution rates. We
removed the fastest evolving 5% or 25% of sites (beyond
this level, the preponderance of constant and autapomorphic sites tends to lead to the generation of very poorly
resolved and supported topologies). Distance bootstrap
analyses were performed on these datasets and support for
key partitions was compared with support derived from
the complete dataset (see Table 2). The set with the 5% of
fastest evolving sites removed generated an identical bootstrap topology to the full set with comparable (+/- < 10%)
bootstrap support values at all nodes with respect to the
original data. However, when the most variable 25% of
sites were removed, Anomalurus was recovered as sister to
the Muroidea/Dipodidae clade, albeit with low (30%)
bootstrap support, while bootstrap support for the partition Anomalurus+Hystricognathi fell to 28%. Additionally,
support for Muroidea+Dipodidae+Sciuridae+Myoxidae
fell to 13% while Hystricognathi emerged as sister to the
Anomalurus/Muroidea/Dipodidae clade (23% BP, not
shown in Table 2). Strikingly, and in accordance with the
AU tests, Anomalurus never emerged as monophyletic with
Sciuridae and Myoxidae, regardless of which set of sites
were analysed.
Molecular dating
We employed the Bayesian protein phylogeny for use in a
Bayesian relaxed clock dating approach [24] to estimate
divergence times between major lineages. Relaxed clock
methods allow substitution rates to vary over the tree and
thus do not rely on strict clock-like evolution of the
sequences under consideration. Following the method of
Amer and Kumazawa [25] we have incorporated the
mtREV24 + gamma model into the MULTIDISTRIBUTE

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/16

software in order to use a substitution model developed
with mitochondrial protein sequences. We also estimated
divergence times using the DNA codon position 1 and 2
data under the F84 + gamma substitution model. For calibration points we specified that: 1) the Rodentia/Lagomorpha divergence should have occurred between 61 and
90 Million Years Ago (MYA) [26,27], 2) the basal divergence in the sampled Lagomorpha should have occurred
between 35 and 40 MYA [28] and 3) the divergence of
Pongo should have occurred between 13 and 18 MYA [29].
The inferred times of some key divergences (with associated errors) are shown in Table 3. Notably the divergence
of Glires from Primates and Dermoptera is estimated to
have occurred just over 65 Million Years Ago (MYA) by
both DNA and protein data, the divergence of the Hystricognathi + Anomalurus group is dated at 58.7MYA (protein) or 57.5MYA (DNA), while the divergence of the
Muroidea+Dipodidae clade from the Sciuridae+Myoxidae
clade is estimated to have occurred 53.4MYA (protein) or
51.8 MYA (DNA). Importantly, nodes which were not
used as calibration points were consistently dated in
accordance with estimates from nuclear genes and the fossil record (Old world monkeys from New world monkeys
36.8MYA (protein) 38.4MYA (DNA), Homo from Pan
5.7MYA (protein) 6.4MYA (DNA), Mus from Rattus
15.1MYA (protein) 15.9MYA (DNA)) [13,30]. The estimates presented were generated using prior assumptions
that the mean and standard error of the probability distribution describing the substitution rate at the root of the
tree (a parameter required by the MULTIDIVTIME software) were equal to the mean of the substitution rate over
the tree (assuming that Euarchontoglires is 75 million
years old). However, the results of the Bayesian dating
were extremely robust to the value specified for this
parameter. Repeated runs with differing values yielded
extremely similar estimates of divergence times (not
shown).
Evolutionary rates
The Bayesian dating analysis also permits estimates of variation in evolutionary rates across the tree. Evolutionary

rates of proteins estimated for branches leading to some
nodes of interest are shown in Table 3. Like the estimates
of divergence dates, the rate estimates were rather robust
to the parameterization of the distribution of evolutionary rates at the base of the tree. The amino acid substitution rate inferred for the divergence between Primates/
Dermoptera and Glires 0.13%/MY) remains relatively
constant until the divergence of the Tarsius+Nycticebus+Lemur clade (0.15%/MY), wherein a sharp rise in substitution rates is observed (0.24%/MY at the divergence of
Cynocephalus and 0.35%/MY at the divergence between
old world and new world monkeys. Rates remain high (or
continue to increase) within the old world monkeys, but
within the Hominoidea there is a notable decrease in substitution rates (0.26%/MY at the divergences both of
Homo and Gorilla. With respect to the Glires, there is a
slight tendency to increased amino acid substitution rates
in the Muroidea, Hystricognathi and Anomalurus (0.23–
0.26%/MY), while rates remain relatively stable in Lagomorpha and Sciurus. We wished to investigate whether the
observed lineage specific shifts in amino acid substitution
rates were a general property of mitochondrial protein
coding genes or whether particular genes (or respiratory
complexes) have undergone changes in evolutionary rates
(a scenario that might indicate adaptive or functional
changes). Accordingly, we used estimates of site-specific
relative variability generated by the SiteVarProt methodology. For each major lineage in our dataset, we both
counted the number of amino acid positions that are perfectly conserved within the group and calculated mean
gene-specific normalized relative substitution rates for all
variable sites (Table 4). Intriguingly, our data show that
for proteins that are part of the cytochrome-c oxidase
complex (COX1, COX2, COX3) and the cytochrome b

protein, the normalized mean relative variability (of variable sites) is higher in Primates/Dermoptera than in
Rodentia, while the number of perfectly conserved sites is
lower in Primates/Dermoptera. These observations are
highly consistent with previous studies that have identified accelerated rates of evolution of nuclear and mitochondrially encoded components of the cytochrome c
oxidase complex and cytochrome b in some Primates (eg
[31-33]). Conversely, for proteins that are components of
complex I (NADH dehydrogenase complex) the mean relative variability of variable sites is somewhat lower in Primates/Dermoptera than in Rodentia while the number of
perfectly conserved sites tends to be higher in Rodentia.

Discussion
Protein vs. DNA sequences
The relative merits of performing phylogenetic analyses
on nucleotide or corresponding amino acid sequences
have been discussed extensively (eg [34]). In brief, while
DNA sequences allow the complete parameterization of
substitution models through the use of the data under
examination, amino acid substitution models typically
allow only amino acid frequencies to be adjusted according to the available data. On the other hand, the degree of
substitutional saturation and homoplastic character evolution is expected to be higher among nucleotide
sequences due to the restricted number of character states
and mild to moderate compositional biases in DNA
sequences are expected not to cause extensive perturbation of amino acid composition due to the degeneracy of
the genetic code, but see [35]. It is clearly desirable that
DNA and associated inferred amino acid sequences
should generate congruent phylogenetic hypotheses; in
the absence of such congruent results it is necessary to

assess whether inferences derived from DNA and protein
sequences are statistically incongruent and, if so, attempt
to explain observed differences in terms of characteristics
of the data. In the current investigation, neither dataset
discriminates between the two Bayesian consensus trees
according to the approximately unbiased test. It is of some
concern that the Bayesian consensus tree generated from
the DNA data recovers Anomalurus not within Rodentia
but among Primates. However, we note that the DNA
dataset considered includes several primate sequences
that fail the chi square test of compositional homogeneity. When Primates are excluded, Anomalurus is recovered
in an identical position to the amino acid analyses (as sister to the Hystricognathi). Furthermore, while distance
bootstrap analyses of protein sequences support, albeit
weakly, the monophyly of Rodentia (Fig. 1), equivalent
analyses performed on DNA sequences yield poorly supported consensus trees depicting non-monophyletic
Glires, Rodentia and Primates/Dermoptera (not shown).
Finally, no potential amino-acid synapomorphies link
Anomalurus with the Primates/Dermoptera clade (while
potential synapomorphies with the Hystricognathi and
with the Muroidea/Dipodidae clade have been identified). We therefore consider results derived from protein
sequences to be more reliable in this case, although we
suggest that there is no significant incongruence between
inferences derived from the protein and DNA data.
The phylogeny of Euarchontoglires and the evolutionary
placement of Anomalurus
Bayesian and distance bootstrap analyses of concatenated
first and second codon positions and inferred protein
sequences of Rodentia, Primates/Dermoptera, Scandentia
and Lagomorpha generated well-supported hypotheses of
relationships within Primates/Dermoptera. In accordance
with other analyses of mitochondrial sequences [21,6],

we recover Primates as paraphyletic with Dermoptera
emerging as sister-group to the Anthropoidea with high
bootstrap and posterior support. Our protein, but not
DNA data reject monophyly of primates as assessed by the
AU test of competing tree topologies. Analyses of concatenated nuclear (or nuclear and mitochondrial) data usually
(eg [36-38]), but not always [39] prefer the traditional
hypothesis of Primates monophyly. However, support for
the position of Dermoptera as sister to Scandentia is often
scarce and or dependent on the analytical method
employed [36]. The positioning of Tarsius as sister to
Lemur and Nycticebus is unexpected in the light of morphological and nuclear data, but consistent with other
analyses of mt (for discussion see [18]) and some analyses
of nuclear data [39,36]. The evolutionary affinities of
Scandentia (represented in our analyses by Tupaia) have
not been satisfactorily resolved by molecular data (see
[40,20,39,36,37,41,21,38] and references therein)
although current thinking tends to favour a sister relationship with Dermoptera in a clade which emerges basal to
the primates. The analyses of mt protein data presented
here are in accord with our previous analyses of mt DNA
data [6] in suggesting that Tupaia represents the basal
divergence of Euarchontoglires rather than constituting
the sister taxon of Lagomorpha, Primates, Primates/Dermoptera or Dermoptera. However, where tests of competing tree topologies have been performed, the position of
Scandentia has remained unclear [36]. Thus, while our
mitochondrial dataset refutes what must be considered a
weakly supported nuclear consensus for relationships
between Dermoptera, Scandentia and Primates, it is not
clear how inconsistent the nuclear data may be with the
mitochondrially-derived hypothesis. Importantly, the
question of Dermoptera/Primates relationships at least
has recently been addressed through examination of the
distribution of Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements in

these organisms [42]. These data should be free of many
of the problems associated with analysis of molecular
sequences (substitutional saturation, model choice, compositional bias etc) and strongly support the traditional
hypothesis of Primate monophyly – suggesting that available mitochondrial and (to a lesser extent) nuclear
sequence data have failed to correctly resolve Primates/
Dermoptera relationships.
With respect to relationships within Glires, inferred protein sequences suggested a specific relationship between
Anomalurus and the Hystricognathi. However, first and
second codon positions of the gene sequences tended
place Anomalurus among the basal divergences in the Primates/Dermoptera clade. This placement was not
robustly supported and indeed Bayesian analyses of
nucleotide sequences in the absence of Primates (some of
whose sequences failed tests of compositional homogeneity) favoured the same placement as suggested by the protein sequences. While we are not aware of published
hypotheses suggesting this relationship, it should be
noted that a relationship between Anomaluridae and
Ctenodactylidae has been proposed on the basis of morphological features [14]. Recent molecular and many classical studies have suggested an affinity between
Hystricognathi and Ctenodactylidae (e.g. [11,7,13]).
Unfortunately, at the present time, no complete mitochondrial genome sequences from Ctenodactylidae are
available. Some molecular data have suggested that the
Anomaluridae are specifically related to the Pedetidae
(Spring Hares) [12]. Recent analyses that have included
sequences from either of these taxa have tended to place
these organisms as weakly supported basal branches in a
clade containing Dipodidae, Muridae, Geomyidae and
Heteromyidae (sister to the Dipodidae/Muroidea clade in
our sampling) [36,11,7,43]. Our analyses of constrained
tree topologies recovered this placement as a viable alternative to our preferred hypothesis of a relationship
between Anomalurus and Hystricognathi (and presumably
Ctenodactylidae).
With respect to relationships between other families/
superfamilies within Rodentia, we consistently recover
previously proposed relationships between Dipodidae
and Muroidea and between Sciuroidea and Gliridae with
high bootstrap and posterior probability support. Our
analyses however, like those based on other genes or gene
concatenations [39,36,37,41,11,12,38,7,43] fail to unambiguously resolve relationships between these groups and
the Hystricognathi in the sense that high posterior probabilities for higher order relationships within Rodentia are
often accompanied by moderate or low bootstrap support
and valid probabilistic tests of alternative topologies have
seldom been presented. While our data and analyses prefer the hypothesis that the basal divergence within Roden-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/16

tia consists of Hystricognathi (and by inference
Ctenodactylidae) + Anomaluridae, leaving the Dipodidae/Muroidea and Gliridae/Sciuridae clades as sisters to
each other, our data do not exclude a multitude of other
evolutionary scenarios.
The Slow-Fast method – in which faster evolving sites are
progressively removed from the dataset and changes in
support for nodes of interest are examined – was
employed to investigate whether sites supporting different
hypotheses of relationships could be partitioned according to evolutionary rates. Exclusion of fast evolving sites
has little impact on the resolution of either the position of
Anomalurus (when the 25% of sites inferred to be fastest
evolving were removed, we recover Anomalurus as a
weakly supported sister to the Muridae/Dipodidae clade
in accordance with constrained topologies discussed previously) or other relationships within Rodentia, suggesting that "noise" from fast evolving sites is not obscuring
phylogenetic signal present in slower evolving sites. We
interpret this finding as an indication that phylogenetic
signal for higher-order relationships within Rodentia is
rather scarce. In accordance with this proposal, we observe
that the inferred amino acid sequences derived from
Anomalurus (3519 unambiguously aligned amino acids)
share only three potential synapomorphies with the Hystricognathi and three with the Muroidea/Dipodidae clade.
There are no potential synapomorphies linking all Rodentia, or associating Anomalurus with Lagomorpha, the
Myoxidae/Sciuridae clade, Primates/Dermoptera, or any
possible sister group set of Rodentia families.
Molecular dating of divergences in Euarchontoglires
Molecular dating of divergences within Euarchontoglires
based on mitochondrial sequence data and a global
molecular clock has historically yielded estimates in conflict with the fossil record, particularly with respect to
Rodentia e.g. [44,45]. More recently several approaches
that allow substitution rates to vary over the tree have
been developed (for review see [8]). We have employed a
Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach that does not
require the user to specify where rate changes occur on the
tree and allows specification of calibration points as intervals rather than fixed dates. Using 6 constraints (upper
and lower limits on three nodes) we have generated estimates of divergence times which are highly consistent
with estimates of divergence dates based on the fossil
record. Notably, the divergence dates recovered for Homo
vs. Pan (5.7 and 6.4MYA for Protein and DNA data respectively), old world vs. new world monkeys (36.8 and
38.5MYA for Protein and DNA data) are highly consistent
with both fossil data and other recent molecular dating
studies using molecular sequences [46]. We estimate that
the divergence of Rodentia occurred 62.8 (protein) or
62.7 (DNA) MYA, the divergence of Hystricognathi +

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/16

Anomalurus occurred 58.8 (protein) or 57.5 (DNA) MYA
while the divergence of Anomalurus occurred 48.1 (protein) or 52.3 (DNA) MYA and the divergence of the Sciuidae/Myoxidae and Muroidea/Dipodidae clades occurred
53.6 (protein) or 51.8 (DNA) MYA – with the Mus/Rattus
split occurring 15.1 (protein) or 15.9 (DNA) MYA. These
estimates are generally consistent with the fossil data and
recent estimates using local clock approaches [13,9,10].

higher-level
relationships
within
Rodentia
[36,37,11,12,38]. Given the aforementioned considerations, we suggest that difficulties in the reconstruction of
correct and unambiguous higher-order relationships
within Glires do not reflect limitations of either nuclear or
mitochondrial sequence data, but are likely to be inherent
consequences of a rapid evolutionary radiation which
occurred around 60 million years ago.

Given the relative lack of resolution of relationships
within Rodentia, we were interested to investigate the
impact of the tree topology on estimates of divergence
dates. Changes in the phylogenetic position of Anomalurus
yielded relatively minor differences in divergence time
estimates. For example, placing Anomalurus as the basal
divergence in Rodentia or as sister to the Dipodidae/
Muroidea/Myoxidae/Sciuridae group altered estimates of
divergence of Rodentia and Lagomorpha by a maximum
of 0.12MY. Estimates of the divergence of the Hystricognathi lineage from the Dipodidae/Muroidea/Myoxidae/
Sciuridae never varied by more than 3.5MY and the divergence of Anomalurus by at most 2.8MY (not shown).

Methods

These findings are notable as they highlight a fundamental problem in the resolution of higher order relationships
within Rodentia. Accounting for the 5% error intervals of
our dating estimates, the divergence of Rodentia from Lagomorpha, the divergence of Hystricognathi from other
Rodentia and the divergence of Sciuridae/Myoxidae and
Muroidea/Dipodidae potentially occurred within 3.1 million years of each other around 60 million years ago –
leaving relatively little time for the evolution of lineagespecific characters (molecular or morphological) which
may be used in the reconstruction of phylogenetic affinities. Conversely, the relatively long subsequent independent evolutionary history of lineages considered here, in
conjunction with the limited available taxonomic sampling is likely to have lead to extensive symplesiomorphy
and homoplasy, further complicating phylogenetic reconstruction.

Conclusion
The use of mitochondrial sequences for the investigation
of even relatively shallow phylogenetic relationships
within Rodentia has recently been questioned [47,48].
Indeed it has long been suspected that fast evolutionary
rates and compositional biases can lead to misleading
phylogenetic signal and poorly supported splits for deeper
relationships. While we agree that saturation and compositional biases present a major problem for the reconstruction of ancient divergences, we stress that conclusions
from mitochondrial sequences regarding divergence times
are consistent with fossil data. Indeed recent studies using
individual and concatenated nuclear or nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences also fail to robustly resolve

DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from 4.5 g of frozen
liver of an Anomalurus sp (scaly-tailed flying squirrel) specimen captured in central Africa (specimen provided by F.
Catzeflis), according to previously described methods for
mammalian species [49].

The entire mitochondrial genome was amplified, using
the Polymerase Chain Reaction with eight pairs of heterologous primers designed on the basis of highly conserved regions of the complete mitochondrial sequence of
several representative species mammalian species [6].
Amplifications were performed in 100 μl reaction volumes containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 0.25 mM of each
dNTP, 0.5 μM of each primer, and 2.5U of TaqGold
polymerase (Roche Applied Science). PCR cycling conditions were 10 min of hot start at 95°C for the activation of
the enzyme, followed by 30–35 amplification cycles (45 s
of denaturation at 95°C, 45 s of primer annealing at temperatures from 55 to 65°C, and 2 to 3 min of extension at
72°C) followed by a final cycle of 7 min at 72°C. Single
amplification products with length between 1.2 and 3.5
Kb were consistently obtained and produced overlapping
fragments that covered the whole mitochondrial genome.
PCR products were purified using the Amicon MicroconPCR Centrifugal Filter Devises (Millipore) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Fragments were sequenced
either directly or after cloning in the pGEM-t easy vector
(Promega). Sequencing reactions were performed using
the Thermo Sequenase Cy5.5 Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 8 μl
reaction volumes and following the manufacturer's
instructions. After purification, DNA sequences were analyzed on a Seq4×4 automated sequencer (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech). Double strand primer walking strategy provided contiguous sequence information for both
strands in all fragments. All overlapping regions between
amplified fragments matched perfectly and all predicted
open reading frames followed the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code, leading us to exclude the possibility
that we had amplified fragments of mitochondrial
genome that had been inserted into the nuclear genome.
The mtDNA sequence of the flying squirrel Anomalurus sp.

AM159537.
Phylogenetic analyses
Conceptually translated coding sequences H-strand genes
derived from all available complete mitochondrial
genomes of Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia
and Lagomorpha species were aligned using the program
MUSCLE [50] [see Additional file 1]. Sequences from the
Laurasiatheria species sheep, dog and mole were included
as outgroups (a total of 41 taxa, see table included in supplementary materials). Alignments were manually
adjusted and DNA sequences reverse aligned to correspond with protein alignments. Regions of low alignment
quality were identified using the program G-Blocks [51]
and excluded from subsequent analyses. Protein
sequences and the ungapped first and second codon positions (after exclusion of codons with first position leucine
synonymous substitutions (Leu-SynP1)) of DNA
sequences, were included in concatenated datasets for
phylogenetic analyses (5358 nucleotides, 3519 amino
acids).

Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the program
MrBayes 3.1 [52] using the General-Time-Reversible
(GTR) substitution model for nucleotide sequences and
"mtrev24" model for protein sequences, in both cases
with the invariant site plus gamma options (eight categories). Two parallel analyses, each composed of one cold
and three incrementally heated chains were run for
2,000,000 generations. Trees were sampled every 50 generations and 20,000 trees were discarded as "burn-in"
(sufficient to allow convergence according to the tests
indicated by the program).
Distance bootstrap analyses were performed by using the
shellscript
PUZZLEBOOT
(available
from
the
TREE_PUZZLE website) in conjunction with TREE-PUZZLE [17] and the programs SEQBOOT, NEIGHBOR and
CONSENSE from the PHYLIP package [53], using the substitution models employed in Bayesian analyses with rate
heterogeneity parameters estimated by TREE-PUZZLE on
the relevant Bayesian tree topology.

plex model available in BASEML) was employed. For protein sequences, following the method of Amer and
Kumazawa [25], a modified version of CODEML was used
to estimate model parameters for the mtrev24 + gamma
model. In both cases the program ESTBRANCHES [24]
was used to estimate variances of branch lengths and
MULTIDIVTIME [24] used to estimate divergence times.
Analyses of compositional homogeneity were performed
using the Chi square test implemented in the program
TREE-PUZZLE. Site-specific relative substitution rates
were estimated using the SiteVarProt algorithm [23].
