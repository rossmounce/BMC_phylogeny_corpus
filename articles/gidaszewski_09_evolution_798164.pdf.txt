Abstract
Background: Sexual dimorphism of body size has been the subject of numerous studies, but few
have examined sexual shape dimorphism (SShD) and its evolution. Allometry, the shape change
associated with size variation, has been suggested to be a main component of SShD. Yet little is
known about the relative importance of the allometric and non-allometric components for the
evolution of SShD.
Results: We investigated sexual dimorphism in wing shape in the nine species of the Drosophila
melanogaster subgroup. We used geometric morphometrics to characterise wing shape and found
significant SShD in all nine species. The amount of shape difference and the diversity of the shape
changes evolved across the group. However, mapping the divergence of SShD onto the phylogeny
of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup indicated that there is little phylogenetic signal. Finally,
allometry accounted for a substantial part of SShD, but did not explain the bulk of evolutionary
divergence in SShD because allometry itself was found to be evolutionarily plastic.
Conclusion: SShD in the Drosophila wing can evolve rapidly and therefore shows only weak
phylogenetic structure. The variable contribution of allometric and non-allometric components to
the evolutionary divergence of SShD and the evolutionary plasticity of allometry suggest that SShD
and allometry are influenced by a complex interaction of processes.

Background
Sexual dimorphism is one of the most striking and widespread sources of phenotypic variation in animals and
plants and has therefore attracted considerable interest in
evolutionary biology. The evolution of sex dimorphism
has been extensively studied, but most studies have concerned dimorphism of size [1-4]. In contrast, sexual shape
dimorphism (SShD) has been much less investigated.

Of those studies that considered SShD, most have discussed it as a diagnostic-trait for diverse purposes, such as
sex identification or the analysis of ontogeny [5-14]. Only
relatively few investigations have specifically considered
the evolution of SShD, covering a wide range of study systems including the skull in primates [15-18], body proportions of lizards [19,20], newts [21] or flies [22], the
head shape of Chironomus larvae [23] and Lycium flowers

[24]. With few exceptions, these studies used only small
numbers of species and no explicit phylogenetic framework for analyzing evolutionary change.
A factor that many studies have identified as playing a particularly important role for SShD is allometry, the relationship between size and shape [25-29]. Particularly in
primatology, SShD has often been explained by allometric variation of shape and ontogenetic scaling [6,17,27],
which raises the possibility that SShD may evolve primarily as a by-product of the evolution of sexual size dimorphism. To address this question, it is useful to separate an
allometric component of SShD, for which size dimorphism accounts, from a non-allometric component of
residual SShD from other sources. For instance, several
studies in primates found that allometric scaling tends to
account for much of SShD, but that non-allometric shape
variation also contributes a significant part of SShD [1618]. Similarly, allometric scaling accounts for most of
SShD in some species of lizards [13], but other species
show sexual dimorphism in body proportions without
sexual size dimorphism [30]. Altogether, these studies
suggest that the role of allometry in SShD is more complex
than previously assumed and therefore requires systematic investigation.
Here we address this issue by investigating the evolution
of SShD and the role of allometry of the wing in the nine
species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Drosophila
is a long-standing model organism in evolutionary biology, and the melanogaster subgroup has been particularly
well studied [31,32]. The Drosophila wing is a model trait
in evolutionary studies, which has a remarkable potential
to evolve under selection [33,34]. Because the intersections between wing veins provide landmarks that can be
located precisely, shape variation is easy to quantify with
the landmark-based methods of geometric morphometrics [35] and the Drosophila wing has therefore been
widely used for morphometric studies [36-40]. SShD in
the wing of Drosophila melanogaster has been found to be
quite constant over latitudinal clines of wing shape on different continents, suggesting that SShD may be evolutionarily constrained [36]. Allometry appears to be one of the
evolutionary processes possibly involved in this SShD
[36,41], although this question has not been addressed
directly. This study uses geometric morphometrics to

examine SShD of the wing shape in all nine species of the
melanogaster subgroup, to test for the presence of a phylogenetic signal in SShD and to study the role of allometry
in its evolution.

Results
Variation of wing size and shape
Size and shape of the wings were characterized by a set of
15 landmarks (Figure 1) and analyzed with the methods
of geometric morphometrics. To quantify wing size, we
used centroid size, which is a measure of the spread of
landmarks around their centre of gravity [35]. An analysis
of variance indicates that both species and sex have significant effects on centroid size (Table 1). Moreover, the significant species × sex interaction indicates a divergence of
sexual size dimorphism among species.

Wing shape was extracted from the landmark coordinate
data with a generalized Procrustes fit [35]. A multivariate
analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test the
effects of species, sex, size and their interactions on wing
shape (Table 2). Species of the melanogaster subgroup differ in their wing shapes (significant main effect of species). The MANOVA results also indicate that there is
sexual shape dimorphism; however, the marginal significance of the main effect of sex and the highly significant
species × sex interaction suggest that sex dimorphism has
diverged considerably among species. Allometry contributed to differences in wing shape (significant main effect
of centroid size), but there appear to be differences in the
allometric patterns among species and sexes (significant
interactions of centroid size × sex, centroid size × species
and centroid size × species × sex).
Variation in sexual shape dimorphism
To quantify the amount of SShD, we computed the Procrustes tangent distance [35] between the mean shapes of
the males and females of each species. On the whole,
these shape changes were fairly subtle. The magnitudes of
total SShD differed among species, with D. orena displaying the least shape dimorphism and D. mauritiana being
the most dimorphic species in the subgroup (Figure 2;
numbers next to the diagrams for total SShD).

To visualize the shape changes associated with SShD, we
graphed the shape changes from male to female average

shapes for all nine species (Figure 2, left). Here we also
describe the shape features associated with SShD as
changes from the male to female shape. A common feature of SShD in most species is an overall narrowing of the
distal part of the wing blade from male to female, particularly in the region between the L3 and L4 veins (landmarks 13 and 14; weaker in D. erecta) and to some extent
also the distal ends of the L2 and L5 veins (landmarks 12
and 15). This general narrowing was accompanied by various species-specific shape changes from male to female:
a posterior shift of landmark 5 (D. orena, D. santomea, and
D. sechellia) and a distal shift of the posterior crossvein (D.
mauritiana, D. teissieri and D. yakuba), of the anterior
crossvein (D. erecta) or of both crossveins (D. melanogaster
and D. simulans).
The SShD of different species were distinct from each
other (Table 3): pairwise distances between the SShD vectors of different species ranged from 0.0078 (D. teissieri
versus D. yakuba) to 0.0140 (D. mauritiana versus D. melanogaster). The differences between SShD of different species were therefore of a similar magnitude as the SShD in
each species (Figure 2), indicating a considerable diversification. Bootstrap tests [42] against the null hypothesis of

equal SShD vectors were all nominally significant (all P <
0.05; Table 3) and the false discovery rate [43] is controlled at the 5% level (i.e. it is expected that fewer than 5%
of the significant tests are false positives).
The variation of SShD in the melanogaster subgroup was
displayed graphically by a principal component analysis
(Figure 3). None of the principal components (PCs)
accounted for a very large proportion of the variation
(25.56% for PC1), indicating that the variation of SShD
diverged in many directions of the shape space. The confidence ellipses for the SShD of most species were fairly
large (Figure 3), which suggests a considerable degree of
uncertainty about the SShD for those species. The overlap
of the confidence ellipses in the PC plots, despite the significant separation of all species from each other, points
to the high-dimensional nature of the variation.
Phylogenetic signal
To reconstruct the evolutionary history of SShD, we
mapped the SShD onto a phylogeny of the melanogaster
subgroup (Figure 4) assembled from published sources
[44-46]. The values of SShD corresponding to the internal
nodes of the phylogeny were estimated by squaredchange parsimony [47,48] and the tree was graphed in the
principal component plots [24,49-51] so that reconstructed evolutionary trajectories of SShD can be visualized (Figure 3).

In the resulting graph (Figure 3), many terminal branches
of the tree appeared to be fairly long, whereas the internal
branches tended to be relatively short. This reflected the
fact that some closely related species showed clearly different SShD (e.g. the pairs of sister species D. simulans and D.
mauritiana, D. santomea and D. yakuba). Moreover, there
were many sharp changes of direction in the reconstructed
trajectories of evolutionary change and branches
appeared to cross in all three PC plots in Figure 3, indicating the presence of homoplasy. Yet, the divergence of
SShD also seemed to contain some phylogenetic structure, as the shape dimorphisms of the species belonging
to the same complexes were often found in the same areas
of the PC plots.

Tabled values are the magnitude of the difference between the SShD of each pair of species (in units of Procrustes distance, upper value in each
table cell) and the P-value for the respective bootstrap test of the null hypothesis of no difference in SShD (lower value in each table cell).

To test for the presence of a phylogenetic signal in SShD,
we used a permutation procedure that is a multivariate
generalization of the method previously used for scalar
traits such as body size [52]. This test simulated the null
hypothesis of the complete absence of a phylogenetic signal by randomly permuting SShD vectors among the terminal nodes of the phylogenetic tree and evaluated the
resulting tree length for each permutation. The tree length
obtained by mapping of the original data onto the phylogenetic tree by weighted squared-change parsimony was
0.000392 (in units of squared Procrustes distance). The
permutation procedure resulted in an equal or shorter tree
length in nearly half the permutations (proportion 0.48,
which corresponds to the P-value of the test) and therefore provides no evidence for a phylogenetic signal in
SShD.

regression vectors for males and females are the same.
There was a significant and substantial difference between
regression vectors for males and females in D. melanogaster (sum of squared differences 0.023; P = 0.022) and
smaller differences in D. santomea (0.0045; P = 0.0094),
D. orena (0.00096; P = 0.037), D. teissieri (0.0050; P =
0.023). The differences in the other species were small
(0.0011 – 0060) and not statistically significant (P-values
0.12 – 0.55). Therefore, the separation of allometric and
non-allometric components of SShD for D. melanogaster is
likely to be unreliable, and should be interpreted with
some caution in the remaining species as well.

Allometry in SShD
To assess the role of allometry for SShD, we decomposed
the total SShD for each species into allometric and nonallometric components (Figure 5). We used multivariate
regression of shape on centroid size [53] as the general
approach to analyze allometry. To obtain a common estimate for the allometry in both sexes, we ran a pooled
within-sex regression in each species. The allometric component of SShD is the part predicted by the sexual size
dimorphism (and is thus in the same direction in the
shape tangent space as the regression vector), whereas the
non-allometric component is the difference between the
total SShD and the allometric component (Figure 5).

The magnitudes of the allometric and non-allometric
components of SShD tended not to add up to the magnitude of the total SShD (Figure 2), as would be expected if
all are in the same direction of shape tangent space.
Instead, the magnitudes of the allometric and non-allometric components were variable and often of a similar
magnitude as the total SShD. In some species, the magnitudes of both components exceeded that of the total SShD
(D. melanogaster, D. orena, D. teissieri), but these were
among the species where the allometric regressions differed significantly between the sexes, so that this result
may be related to poor estimates of a common allometric
regression. In all species, however, the magnitudes of the
total SShD and its components suggested that the direction of total SShD and the allometric component (and
therefore also the non-allometric component) differ considerably.

Because this approach assumes that the allometric regression vectors in males and females are parallel, we conducted a bootstrap test [42] of the null hypothesis that the

This expectation was confirmed by inspection of the
shape changes associated with SShD and its components
(Figure 2). The allometric component of SShD was associ-

ated with a wide range of shape changes, which differed
considerably from those of total SShD in most species.
Allometric SShD tended to consist of a slight expansion of
the proximal part of the wing and various changes in the
distal part of the wing, which often included a distal shift
of landmark 12. In contrast, non-allometric SShD did not
include a distal shift of landmark 12 or only a slight one.
Non-allometric SShD also showed variety of other shape
changes, but there were no other shape features that were
shared by most species and there was no apparent relation
to the relatedness of species.

Discussion
This study has yielded three main results concerning the
evolution of sex dimorphism in Drosophila wing shape.
First, we have shown that SShD has diverged among the
nine species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Second, the evolution of SShD is little constrained by the
phylogenetic structure of the subgroup. Third, allometry is
an important component of sexual shape dimorphism in
the wing but is not its main evolutionary driver. Here we
present the implications of our results for the evolution of
the Drosophila wing and sexual shape dimorphism.
Our study found substantial evolution of SShD in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. The MANOVA of shape
revealed a clearly significant sex × species interaction
(Table 2), which indicates that the effect of sex depends
on the species. Similarly, most of the pairwise comparisons of SShD showed highly significant differences
between species (Table 3). With a range of 0.0078 to
0.014 (in units of Procrustes distance, Table 3), the magnitudes of pairwise differences between the SShD of different species are therefore of a similar to the magnitudes
of SShD, which ranged from 0.0077 to 0.017 (same units,
Figure 2). This result is in marked contrast with the find-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/110

ing of Gilchrist et al. [36], who found SShD to be remarkably conserved across latitudinal clines of wing shape that
had evolved separately on three continents. Those authors
attributed the relative evolutionary conservatism of SShD
to constraints by high genetic correlations between male
and female wing traits [54], which would be expected to
impede the evolution of differences between the sexes. As
Gilchrist et al. [36] pointed out, such constraints by
genetic correlations can be broken over longer-term evolution. Our results suggest that this may have happened in
the evolution of the melanogaster subgroup. At the evolutionary scale of the entire clade, rather than a single species, SShD appears to be a trait that readily evolves.
The shape changes involved in SShD consist of the same
features that are widely observed in variation within or
between populations of Drosophila [36,38,40], such as
proximal or distal shifts of the crossveins along the longitudinal veins or variation in the positions at which the L2
and L5 veins meet the wing margin. For SShD in different
Drosophila species, shape features like these seem to be
combined in various ways. The PCA of SShD variation
among species suggested that variation is distributed over
many dimensions rather than being concentrated primarily in one or a few dimensions (the PC1 accounted for
25.6% of the variation and the subsequent eigenvalues
decreased gradually). Moreover, the scatter of SShD in
shape space is irregular with no dominant patterns or
strongly preferred directions (Figure 3). This suggests that
evolutionary divergence may flexibly combine a set of
wing shape features to make up the SShD for each species.
This impression of flexibility is further reinforced by the
observation that there was little phylogenetic structure in
the divergence of SShD. There appeared to be no association between relatedness of species and the difference of
their SShD (Table 3). The mapping of SShD onto the phylogeny by squared-change parsimony indicated that
changes tended to be small for internal branches and large
for terminal branches (Figure 3), suggesting that much of
the evolutionary divergence of SShD is separately derived
for each species. This overall impression was confirmed by
the permutation test that yielded a clearly non-significant
result, consistent with the null hypothesis of the lack of
any phylogenetic structure in SShD.
Allometry has been generally recognized to be a key factor
for SShD [6,13,16-18,27] and previous studies have demonstrated allometry in Drosophila wings [36,41,55]. Our
study confirms that allometry is an important component
in the evolution of SShD in the melanogaster subgroup; yet,
the results also suggest that allometry is not a stringent constraint on the evolution of SShD. In all nine species, both
the allometric and non-allometric components of SShD are
fairly large (at least half the magnitude of the total SShD,
Figure 2). On the one hand, this indicates that allometry

metric and non-allometric components
The decomposition of total sexual shape dimorphism in alloThe decomposition of total sexual shape dimorphism
in allometric and non-allometric components. Allometric and non-allometric components of SShD are quantified
by a multivariate regression of shape on centroid size (for
simplicity, the regression is displayed in just two dimensions,
i.e. with a single shape variable). Allometric regression lines
in females and males are assumed to be parallel. The allometric component of SShD is the shape change predicted by the
size difference between sexes, and the non-allometric component is the difference between this and the total SShD.
can account for a considerable part of SShD, but on the
other hand, it also shows that the directions of the total
SShD and the allometric regression vector differed considerably from each other and that a substantial part of SShD
therefore cannot be explained by allometry. Clearly, factors
other than allometry are contributing substantially to SShD
in the melanogaster subgroup. This is in agreement with
studies in other organisms [13,16-18] that also have found
non-allometric components of SShD.
Not only is there a substantial contribution by non-allometric SShD, which suggests that allometry is not a severe
constraint on the evolution of SShD, but the allometries
themselves seem to be variable. The shape features associated with allometry differ from species to species (Figure
2) and the bootstrap test indicated that for some species
even the allometries of the two sexes are not the same.
This suggests that allometry itself can evolve, which may
further erode its role as an evolutionary constraint.
Overall, SShD appears to be a trait that can readily respond
to selection or may evolve by drift. The absence of a detectable phylogenetic signal may be the consequence of such
selection that has overridden phylogenetic structure in SShD
or, alternatively, it may be the result of evolution by random
drift (e.g., in association with speciation and founder
events). It is plausible that both sexual selection and natural

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/110

selection affect the evolution of SShD. For instance, the convergent evolution of an unusual sexual dimorphism of body
shape in two distantly related species of flies appears to be
due to sexual selection from male-male interactions [22],
whereas dimorphism of body proportions in lizards has
been related to ecological factors [19,20]. In Drosophila, the
two most likely selective pressures influencing the evolution
of SShD in the wing are flight and the production of courtship song. Because females fly to find oviposition sites
whereas males search mating opportunities, flight requirements and optimal wing shapes may differ between sexes
and result in different regimes of natural selection. Such a
difference has been reported for a midge, where different
flight behaviour in males and females is associated with sexual shape dimorphism in the wings [56]. Sexual selection
may affect SShD in Drosophila wings because males use the
wings for producing courtship songs with species-specific
characteristics [57]. Experimental alteration of sexual selection can produce changes in courtship song [58], which may
be related to changes in wing shape. Because the species of
the melanogaster subgroup live in a range of different environments [59,60], flight behaviour and mating systems differ
between species and are likely to yield divergent regimes of
natural and sexual selection that may affect SShD in the
wings. Because little is known about natural or sexual selection on wing shape, any hypotheses about their effects on
SShD must remain very tenuous until more information is
available.

Conclusion
This study characterised SShD in all nine species of the
Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. We showed a significant divergence of SShD in this clade. There was no detectable phylogenetic signal in the differences, and SShD has
both allometric and non-allometric components. Overall,
there was little evidence for evolutionary constraints and
our results suggested that SShD can readily evolve in
response to selection. Particularly because little is known
about the natural and sexual selection on wing shape in
Drosophila, the mechanisms involved in the evolution of
SShD are far from being understood.

Methods
Samples and measurements
We used flies from long-term laboratory populations of
each of the species known to belong to the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup: D. erecta (49 females; 51 males), D.
mauritiana (47 females; 43 males), D. melanogaster (49
females; 53 males), D. orena (49 females; 50 males), D.
santomea (50 females; 50 males), D. sechellia (50 females;
34 males), D. simulans (47 females; 37 males), D. teissieri
(52 females; 53 males), D. yakuba (52 females; 52 males).
The right wing of each fly was mounted on a microscope
slide in a 70% lactic acid/30% ethanol solution and photographed in standard conditions with camera mounted
on a Leica microscope.

Wing shape was assessed with 15 landmarks located at vein
intersections with other veins and margins (Figure 1). The
landmarks were digitised from the images with ImageJ [61]
and a plug-in specifically written for this purpose.
Morphometric and statistical analyses
To quantify wing size, centroid size [35] was computed
from the raw coordinates of the landmarks. A generalised
Procrustes superimposition [35] was performed on the
landmark coordinates to extract the information on wing
shape (Procrustes coordinates). All morphometric and
statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.01 software [62], including routines for the Procrustes fit as well
as the permutation and bootstrap procedures.

Because sex dimorphism is computed from the mean sizes
or shapes of the sexes within each species (unlike, e.g.,
studies of fluctuating asymmetry [63]) and because our
sample sizes are relatively large, measurement error is not
a serious concern. Moreover, the methods like those used
to acquire coordinate data produce measurement errors
that are much smaller than the variation among individuals [39], so that the effect of measurement error on the
estimates of sex dimorphism or their statistical variability
is negligible.
The effects of species and sex on centroid size were tested
with an ANOVA (type III sums of squares). The effects of
species, sex and centroid size on shape were tested with a
MANOVA (type III sums of squares and cross-products).
SShD for each species was computed as the mean vector
for female shape minus the mean vector for male shape.
Because male and female samples are independent within
each species, covariance matrices for SShD were computed as the sum of the covariance matrices for the mean
shapes of the males and females.
To compare SShD between pairs of species, we used a bootstrap test [42] against the null hypothesis that the species
share the same SShD. To simulate this null hypothesis, the
data for each pair of species were first modified so that they
had the same SShD. Bootstrap samples were then repeatedly drawn from the modified data, SShD was computed in
both species, and the magnitude of the difference in SShD
was then compared to the value obtained from the original
data. For each pairwise combination of species, 10,000
rounds of bootstrap resampling were used.
The principal component analysis of SShD was based on
the covariance matrix of the SShD vectors for the nine species, and therefore maintains the metric of the Procrustes
tangent distances [35]. The 95% confidence ellipses [64]
for PC scores were computed from the covariance matrices
for SShD of the respective species.

Phylogenetic signal in SShD
The topology of the phylogenetic tree of the Drosophila
melanogaster subgroup was assembled as a consensus from
the highly supported phylogenetic information based on
the entire genomes of five species of the melanogaster subgroup [46] together with single-sequence phylogenies of
the entire subgroup [44,45] and information from several
other studies focussing on specific species complexes [6569]. Points of disagreement concerned the rooting of the
tree, for which the whole-genome analyses [46] provide
decisive support, and the sequence of splits between D.
simulans, D. sechellia and D. mauritiana, where several
sources of evidence favour an earlier divergence of D.
sechellia [69-71]. Branch lengths for the resulting consensus tree (Figure 4) were compiled from published estimates of divergence times [66,72-75].

To reconstruct the SShD corresponding to the internal
nodes of the phylogeny, we used squared-change parsimony, weighted by branch lengths [47,48]. To visualize
evolutionary trajectories, we computed the PC scores corresponding to the reconstructed SShD values for the internal nodes of the phylogeny and included them in the PC
plots of Figure 3 [49-51].
To test for a phylogenetic signal in SShD against the null
hypothesis of the absence of any phylogenetic signal, we
used a permutation procedure that is a multivariate extension of a method developed by Laurin [52]. The test uses
a permutation approach [76] to simulate the null hypothesis that there is no phylogenetic signal. The nine
observed SShD vectors were reassigned to the terminal
nodes of the phylogenetic tree in all 362,880 possible permutations of the original order. For each permutation, the
new values were mapped onto the phylogeny by weighted
squared-change parsimony and the tree length (the sum
of the squared Procrustes distances between ancestral and
descendant SShD for all branches of the tree) was computed. If the phylogenetic signal in the data is strong, it is
expected that random permutation of SShD will usually
result in a greater tree length than that of the original data.
Therefore, the test computes the P-value as the proportion
of permutations that result in a tree length that is equal to
or less than the one observed for the original data (more
detail in Klingenberg and Gidaszewski, unpublished).
Allometric and non-allometric components of SShD
Total SShD was decomposed into allometric and non-allometric components of variation in each species (Figure 5). We
characterized allometry with a multivariate regression of
shape (Procrustes coordinates) on centroid size [53]. To
obtain a single allometric regression for each species, we
used pooled within-sex regression of shape on centroid size.

To test the assumption that the allometric regression is the
same in both sexes of each species, we conducted bootstrap
Page 9 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:110

tests [42] with the null hypothesis of a common allometric
regression between sexes. To simulate this null hypothesis,
separate regressions of shape on centroid size were conducted in each sex and the residuals from these regressions
were computed. A pooled within-sex regression of shape on
centroid size was then used to obtain a common regression
vector. The predicted values from this common regression
were added to the residuals of the two separate within-sex
regressions to generate a modified dataset for which the
null hypothesis of a common allometry in both sexes holds
true, but which otherwise corresponds to the original samples. Bootstrap samples for males and females were randomly drawn, with replacement, from the modified dataset
and the multivariate regressions of shape on centroid size
were computed. To quantify the difference between the
regression vectors, the sum of squared differences between
corresponding elements was computed, and this value was
compared to the difference obtained from the allometric
regressions with the original data. The bootstrap resampling procedure was repeated 10,000 times for each species
and the achieved significance level was computed as the
proportion of the rounds of bootstrap resampling for
which this difference was equal to or greater than the difference obtained for the original data.

The allometric component of SShD was computed as the
vector of coefficients of allometric regression times the
difference of centroid size between males and females
(Figure 5). We computed the non-allometric component
of SShD as the total SShD minus the allometric SShD. The
magnitudes of total SShD and the allometric and nonallometric components are the lengths of the corresponding vectors, expressed in units of Procrustes distance.
