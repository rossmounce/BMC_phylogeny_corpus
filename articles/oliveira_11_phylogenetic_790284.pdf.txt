Abstract
Background: With nearly 1,100 species, the fish family Characidae represents more than half of the species of
Characiformes, and is a key component of Neotropical freshwater ecosystems. The composition, phylogeny, and
classification of Characidae is currently uncertain, despite significant efforts based on analysis of morphological and
molecular data. No consensus about the monophyly of this group or its position within the order Characiformes
has been reached, challenged by the fact that many key studies to date have non-overlapping taxonomic
representation and focus only on subsets of this diversity.
Results: In the present study we propose a new definition of the family Characidae and a hypothesis of
relationships for the Characiformes based on phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences of two mitochondrial and
three nuclear genes (4,680 base pairs). The sequences were obtained from 211 samples representing 166 genera
distributed among all 18 recognized families in the order Characiformes, all 14 recognized subfamilies in the
Characidae, plus 56 of the genera so far considered incertae sedis in the Characidae. The phylogeny obtained is
robust, with most lineages significantly supported by posterior probabilities in Bayesian analysis, and high
bootstrap values from maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses.
Conclusion: A monophyletic assemblage strongly supported in all our phylogenetic analysis is herein defined as
the Characidae and includes the characiform species lacking a supraorbital bone and with a derived position of the
emergence of the hyoid artery from the anterior ceratohyal. To recognize this and several other monophyletic
groups within characiforms we propose changes in the limits of several families to facilitate future studies in the
Characiformes and particularly the Characidae. This work presents a new phylogenetic framework for a speciose
and morphologically diverse group of freshwater fishes of significant ecological and evolutionary importance across
the Neotropics and portions of Africa.

Background
One of the largest components of the freshwater fish
fauna world-wide is the order Characiformes with nearly
2,000 species now recognized from myriad drainages of
the New World and Africa [1]. Over 300 characiform
species have been described in the last decade, primarily
from the Neotropics and the pace of descriptions of

new species gives no sign of abating. The characiform
faunas on the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean demonstrate pronounced asymmetry in terms of numbers of
both species and supraspecific taxa. The African components of the order include circa 220 recognized species.
These range south from the Nile River basin in the
deserts of North Africa through much of the rest of the
continent, with maximum diversity in the wetter areas
such as the Congo River Basin, West Africa and Lower
Guinea. On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, over
1,700 species are now recognized extending from the

southwestern portions of the United States south
through Mexico and Central and South America to central Chile and Argentina. Major drainage basins in
South America are all home to large and taxonomically
overlapping assemblages of characiform species. Characiforms inhabit a range of ecosystems extending from
the swiftly flowing rivers and streams of the Andean
piedmont and cordilleras of the Neotropics through to
the lentic backwaters of lowland flood plains in the
Americas and Africa. Within these habitats, characiforms range from dozens of miniature and diminutive
species (sensu Weitzman and Vari [2]) through to hundreds of midsized to giant species. Among the larger
forms, many are economically and ecologically important, with some dominant in various drainages in terms
of the total fish biomass. These and other characiform
species play key roles for intra-ecosystem energy flux
and material cycling in lowland river systems and as
ecosystem engineers (e.g. Prochilodontidae - [3,4]).
African characiforms are now apportioned among four
families, the Alestidae, Citharinidae, Distichodontidae
and Hepsetidae, with the Alestidae and Distichodontidae
accounting for 95% of the species among those families
[1]. A single Neotropical genus (Chalceus) has been
assigned to the otherwise African family Alestidae [5].
In contrast, the more speciose assemblage of New
World characiforms is split into 14 families (Acestrorhynchidae, Anostomidae, Characidae, Chilodontidae,
Crenuchidae, Ctenoluciidae, Curimatidae, Cynodontidae,
Erythrinidae, Gasteropelecidae, Hemiodontidae, Lebiasinidae, Parodontidae, and Prochilodontidae) [6]; with the

Serrasalmidae also recognized as a family by some
authors (e.g. [7]).
To date, a single publication [8] has addressed higher
level relationships across major components of the
Characiformes based on morphological data. This
study used 80 characters and 27 ingroup terminal taxa
with representatives from all recognized characiform
families except the Cynodontidae, Gasteropelecidae
and Serrasalmidae (Figure 1a). Other morphologically
based studies, although important, are more taxonomically restricted, focusing on phylogenetic questions
ranging from the relationships among a few families
through to relationships within families or their components. These included the Alestidae [5], Anostomidae [9,10], Characidae [11-23], Chilodontidae [9,24],
Citharinidae [25], Crenuchidae [8], Curimatidae [9,26],
Distichodontidae [25], Hemiodontidae [27] and Prochilodontidae [9,28].
Notwithstanding these efforts, no published hypothesis
of phylogenetic relationships across characiforms based
on an in-depth sampling of their morphological diversity
is available. The most problematic group within this
order is the family Characidae, whose composition and
relationships within the Characiformes remains
unsettled. With nearly 1,100 species, this family represents approximately 58% of the species within the Characiformes [1], and is the most active taxon in terms of
new species descriptions (over 250 new species in the
course of the last ten years). Considering the poor
understanding of species-level diversity, particularly
among miniature to small sized species, it is likely that

al. [32]. Note that these phylogenies differ in the number of families included.

the Characidae includes a disproportionate percentage
of species yet to be described.
A classification of the family Characidae proposed by
Reis et al. [6] highlighted some of these uncertainties.
Twelve of the recognized subfamilies in that classification were assumed to represent monophyletic groups
based on published results (Agoniatinae, Aphyocharacinae, Bryconinae, Characinae, Cheirodontinae, Clupeacharacinae,
Glandulocaudinae,
Iguanodectinae,
Rhoadsiinae, Serrasalminae, Stethaprioninae and Tetragonopterinae). Nonetheless, 88 characid genera, many
monotypic but others notably speciose (Astyanax, Bryconamericus, Creagrutus, Hemigrammus, Hyphessobrycon,
Jupiaba and Moenkhausia), were placed as “incertae
sedis in the Characidae” by Lima et al. [29]. Included

Page 3 of 25

among these incertae sedis were 620 of the 952 species
assigned to the Characidae at that time. Concurrently,
Malabarba and Weitzman [19] advanced a cladogram
for the group based on four osteological features: (i) the
presence of bony hooks on various fins, (ii) the absence
of the supraorbital bone, (iii) the possession of two
unbranched and eight branched rays in the dorsal fin,
and (iv) the presence of four teeth in the inner tooth
row of the premaxilla (Figure 2a). Of particular note is
that the latter two characters delimited what Malabarba
and Weitzman [19] identified as Clade A. This group
included many of the genera considered to be incertae
sedis in the Characidae by Lima et al. [29] along with
taxa previously assigned to the Glandulocaudinae and
Stevardiinae.

More recently, Mirande [22,23] advanced a comprehensive cladistic analysis for the Characidae based on
360 morphological characters scored for 160 characiform species. Although this study is the most comprehensive to date, it did not include representatives of 60
genera of the Characidae and or representatives from
the characiform families Alestidae, Chilodontidae,
Citharinidae, Ctenoluciidae and Hepsetidae. Interestingly, Mirande’s [23] hypothesis (Figure 2b), obtained by
weighted parsimony analysis, recovered the previously
proposed Clade A of Malabarba and Weitzman [19] that
he named Stevardiinae. On the other hand, Mirande’s
hypothesis [23] is incongruent with prior concepts of
relationships among some taxa, with two examples of
note being the close relationship among Agoniates, Acestrorhynchus, Rhaphiodon and Salminus and the inclusion of Markiana within Astyanax.
The first molecular investigations on this subject were
published by Ortí and Meyer [30] and Ortí [31]. These
were based on partial sequences of the mitochondriallyencoded 12S and 16S rRNA genes (about 880 bp) for 53
taxa. Although Ortí and Myer [30] noted that relationships among characiform families could not be reconstructed with confidence except for a few wellsupported clades, their phylogenetic hypothesis (Figure
1b) suggested some interesting results. For example,
they obtained a basal position of the African families
Citharinidae and Distichodontidae, the hypothesis that
the African and Neotropical characiform assemblages

Page 4 of 25

did not each constitute monophyletic groups and the
finding that the Serrasalmidae is not closely related to
groups then considered to form the family Characidae.
Calcagnotto et al. [32] presented a more extensive
molecular study of characiforms (Figure 1c) based on
sequence analysis of two mitochondrial and four nuclear
genes (about 3700 bp) for 124 characiform taxa (including 59 African representatives but excluding representatives of the Neotropical families Curimatidae and
Gasteropelecidae). The large number of African taxa
analyzed in that study supported the monophyletic nature of the families Citharinidae, Distichodontidae, Alestidae and Hepsetidae (the latter, however, being
monotypic) and again rejected the concept of a monophyletic African assemblage. Five years later, Javonillo et
al. [33] advanced a phylogenetic hypothesis for the
Characidae (Figure 3) using DNA sequences of three
mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene. They analyzed 2940 bp for 98 taxa, including representatives of
eight recognized subfamilies of the Characidae, and 33
genera considered incertae sedis in the Characidae by
Lima et al. [29], plus the Acestrorhynchidae (2 species),
Gasteropelecidae (3 species), and Serrasalmidae (3 genera). Their hypothesis supported three main clades
within the Characidae (clades A, B, and C). Interestingly,
all species included in clade A of Javonillo et al. [33]
belong to Clade A of Malabarba & Weitzman [19], thus
providing independent support for this hypothesis. Not
surprisingly, however, representatives of some speciose

and ill-defined genera such as Astyanax, Bryconamericus, Hemigrammus, and Hyphessobrycon appeared as
polyphyletic.
Partial taxonomic overlap and use of disparate molecular markers in each of these studies has hindered
combination of data sets for a more comprehensive analysis. Attempting to improve our knowledge and to test
previous hypotheses of relationships among members of
the Characidae, the present study is based on a broad
taxon sampling (including all major lineages within the
Characiformes and the Characidae) and a large molecular dataset with sequence data from two mitochondrial
and three nuclear genes, with greater overlap with published data.

Methods
Taxon sampling

We follow the classification of the Characiformes with
18 families proposed by Nelson [1] as a framework for
the selection of species included in this analysis: Acestrorhynchidae, Alestiidae (Alestidae), Anostomidae,
Characidae (including the subfamilies Agoniatinae,
Aphyocharacinae, Bryconinae, Characinae, Cheirodontinae, Clupeacharacinae, Glandulocaudinae, Iguanodectinae, Rhoadsiinae, Stethaprioninae, Tetragonopterinae),
Chilodontidae, Citharinidae, Crenuchidae, Ctenoluciidae,
Curimatidae, Cynodontidae, Distichodontidae, Erythrinidae, Gasteropelecidae, Hemiodontidae, Hepsetidae,
Lebiasinidae, Parodontidae, and Prochilodontidae. We
additionally recognize the family Serrasalmidae and in
the Characidae, the subfamilies Stevardiinae as proposed
by Weitzman et al. [20] and Triportheinae as proposed
by Buckup [34] in selecting taxa for the present study.
According to this classification, taxonomic sampling for
the ingroup included 127 specimens representing all 13
recognized subfamilies of Characidae listed above, as
well as 54 genera considered incertae sedis in the Characidae by Lima et al. [29], plus an undescribed characid
genus. To study the delimitation of Characidae and its
affinities with other families of Characiformes, we compiled a large and diverse outgroup (76 specimens) representing all 18 families of Characiformes, plus two genera
of Cypriniformes to root the Characiform phylogeny. A
complete list of taxa (205 specimens) is presented in
Additional file 1. Tissue samples were primarily
obtained from fish collected during the course of this
study, supplemented by material obtained through the
aquarium trade, or kindly donated by colleagues.
DNA extraction and sequencing

Total DNA was extracted from ethanol preserved muscle, fin, and liver samples with the DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen), following manufacturer’s instructions. Partial
sequences of the genes 16S rRNA, cytochrome b (Cytb),

Page 5 of 25

Myosin, heavy chain 6, cardiac muscle, alpha (Myh6),
recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1), and recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers described
in Additional file 2. Nested-PCRs were used to amplify
the genes Myh6, Rag1, and Rag2 (Additional file 2).
Amplifications were performed in a total volume of 25
μl with 2.5 μl of 10X buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl+15 mM
MgCl 2 ), 2.5 μl dNTPs (200 nM of each), 1 μl each 5
mM primer, 0.1 μl Taq Gold polymerase (Invitrogen), 1
μl template DNA (50 ng), and 17.9 μl ddH2O. The PCR
reactions consisted of 35 cycles, 30 s at 95°C, 45-120 s
at 48-58°C (according to primer and species), and 90 s
at 72°C. All PCR products were first visually identified
on a 1% agarose gel and then purified using ExoSap-IT®
(USB Corporation) following instructions of the manufacturer. The purified PCR products were sequenced
using the “Big DyeTM Terminator v 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit” (Applied Biosystems), purified
again by ethanol precipitation and loaded on an automatic sequencer 3130-Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) in the Instituto de Biociências, Universidade
Estadual Paulista, Botucatu, São Paulo. Contigs were
assembled and edited in BioEdit 7.0.9.0 [35]. Where
uncertainty of nucleotide identity was detected, IUPAC
ambiguity codes were applied. Sequences have been
deposited in GenBank (Additional file 3).
Sequencing alignment and phylogenetic analyses

Sequences of each gene were independently aligned
using the Muscle algorithm under default parameters
[36] and the alignments inspected by eye for any
obvious misalignments that were then corrected. A quality control step was included in our workflow to detect
potential cases of sequencing errors due to contamination or paralogy. Alignments for each gene were initially
analyzed by maximum likelihood (ML) [37] using the
web servers RAxML BlackBox [38] to control for potential sequencing errors involving pseudogenes, paralogous
copies or even laboratory cross-contamination or mistakes during the sequencing process. Sequences that
were found misplaced in the resulting gene tree (as, for
example, species of one family grouped with species of a
obviously non-related family) were re-sequenced or
eliminated from subsequent analyses. Given the degree
of redundancy in taxonomic sampling, errors can be
detected when sequences from putative congeneric or
conspecific specimens are not placed together in the
tree. This procedure was conducted only to check
sequence quality and by the end of the study we found
11 CytB, 19 Myh6, 18 Rag1, and 24 Rag2 suspicious
sequences that were excluded from the analysis. Genetic
distances among sequences were calculated in Mega
5.04 [39]. To evaluate the occurrence of substitution

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:275

saturation, we estimated the index of substitution
saturation (Iss) in DAMBE 5.2.31 [40], as described by
Xia et al. [41] and Xia and Lemey [42]. To investigate
the relative contribution of each gene to the final phylogeny obtained by maximum likelihood analysis, we did a
partitioned branch support analysis (PBS, [43,44]) using
the program TreeRot [45] with 20 replicate heuristic
searches.
Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses were conducted
with PAUP* 4.0b10 [46]. Heuristic searches were performed with minimally 1000 random addition replicates
and TBR branch swapping. All characters were unordered, all character transformations were equally
weighted, and branches with maximum length of zero
were collapsed. Gaps were treated as missing data.
Clade robustness was assessed using 1000 bootstrap
pseudoreplicates [47] with the same parameters as
above.
RAxML [37] using the web servers RAxML BlackBox
[38] was used for all maximum likelihood analyses using
a mixed partition model. Random starting trees were
used for each independent ML tree search and all other
parameters were set on default values. All ML analyses
were conducted under GTR +G since RAxML only
applies this model [37]. Topological robustness was
investigated using 1000 non-parametric bootstrap
replicates.
Phylogenetic analyses using a partitioned Bayesian
approach (BA) were conducted in MrBayes 3.1.2 [48]. A
mixed model analysis was implemented, allowing individual models of nucleotide substitution to be estimated
independently for each partition. A set of six reasonable
partitioning schemes, ranging from 1 to 13 partitions
(Table 1), was tested following the procedures outlined
by Li et al. [49] under the AIC and BIC criteria. The
best-fit model of nucleotide substitution was calculated
in Paup* 4.0b10 [46] with the program Modeltest 3.7
[50] under default parameters using the Akaike information criterion [51, for justification]. Because MrBayes

Page 6 of 25

3.1.2 only implements 1, 2, and 6 substitutions rate
models, often it was not possible to implement the preferred model as selected by the AIC. In these situations,
the nearest overparameterized model was used to avoid
negative consequences of model violation or underparameterization [52,53]. As a consequence, the model for
all partitions was set as: ‘’lset nst = 6” (GTR, TrN,
TVM), ‘’rates = invgamma” (G + I), and the commands
‘’unlink” and ‘’prset ratepr = variable” were used to
unlink model parameters across data partitions and
define a rate multiplier for each partition. Two independent Bayesian analyses were conducted. Four independent MCMC chains were run with 30,000,000 replicates
each, sampling one tree every 1000 steps. The distribution of log likelihood scores was examined to determine
stationarity for each search and to decide if extra runs
were required to achieve convergence, using the program Tracer 1.4 [54]. Initial trees estimated prior to
convergence were discarded as part of a burn-in procedure, and the remaining trees were used to construct a
50% majority rule consensus tree in Paup* [46].
Alternative phylogenetic hypotheses were compared
using likelihood-based tests implemented in the program Treefinder [55]. These tests assess the statistical
significance of differences in likelihood scores between
two or more hypotheses. Probabilities for alternative
hypotheses were obtained for the Shimodaira-Hasegawa
(SH) and the approximately unbiased (AU) tests [56,57].
Both testing procedures are adequate to compare
hypotheses a posteriori based on the same data set, but
since the SH test is more conservative [57], significance
was determined when P-values obtained were P < 0.05
and P < 0.01 for SH and AU, respectively. Several
hypotheses reflecting previous results (e.g., Lucena and
Menezes [58], Calcagnotto et al. [32], Mirande [23]) and
a set of alternative branching patters subtended by the
basal nodes of the phylogeny obtained in this study
were tested. Alternative hypotheses were constructed by
performing tree-searches under specific topological

constraints to find the ML tree that satisfies the branching pattern enforced. The constraints either fixed the
topology or the composition for major clades, but in
each case multifurcations within these clades or elsewhere in the tree were resolved by the tree search.
Searches were conducted under ML using the program
Treefinder with a 13-partition scheme and a GTR+G
model independently optimized for each partition (the
same approach used with RAxML). Results from each of
these constrained tree searches were saved individually
and subsequently joined into a single hypothesis file to
perform the topology tests according to the Treefinder
manual [55].

Results
Partial sequences of two mitochondrial (16SrRNA and
Cytb) and three nuclear genes (Myh6, Rag1 and Rag2)
were obtained for 213 specimens (Additional file 3). The
final matrix was deposited in TreeBase http://www.treebase.org under number 11474. Missing data, due to problems with PCR experiments, sequencing, or missing
data in Genbank, corresponded to 11.7% of the total
data set (Table 2). Data absence was more prevalent
among nuclear (16.6% missing) than mitochondrial
genes (5.0% missing), perhaps due to non-conserved
priming regions and higher risk of cross-contamination
in the nested PCR procedure. For each gene, the number and percentage of sequences obtained, their size
(bp), number of variable sites, base pair composition,
overall mean genetic distance (p-distance), the best substitution model for the gene, a (shape) parameter of Γ
distribution, proportion of invariants (I) sites, number of
informative characters under parsimony, and proportion
of informative characters under parsimony are presented

in Table 2. Under the MP criterion, about one-half of
the positions were phylogenetically informative. The
overall mean of genetic distance observed was between
0.087 ± 0.005 (Myh6) to 0.208 ± 0.007 (CytB), suggesting that the analyzed sequences have enough genetic
variation for the phylogenetic studies of species, genera
and families. Each gene and codon position partition
was tested further to investigate the occurrence of substitution saturation [41,42], and the results showed that
there is significant saturation only for the Rag2 3rd
codon positions in the asymmetrical topology test
(results not shown); however, considering that the Iss.c
value is greater than the Iss value the information found
in this position can be used in the phylogenetic analysis
[41,42]. The best-fitting model of nucleotide substitution
calculated for each partition was: GTR+ I+Γ (CytB 1st
and 2nd position, Myh6 1st and 2nd position, Rag1 1st
position), TVM+I+F (Myh6 3rd position, Rag1 2nd position, Rag2 1st position), K81uf+I+ Γ (Rag2 2nd position,
Rag2 3rd position), TIM+I+ Γ (CytB 3rd position), TrN
+I+ Γ (Rag1 3rd position).
The combined data set contains significant phylogenetic information, given that most major lineages along
the backbone of the tree were supported by high bootstrap values (> 70%). A partitioned Bremer support analysis was applied to the maximum likelihood majority
rule consensus tree. The results show many positive
scores, indicating positive contribution and some negative scores indicating conflicting signal for particular
nodes. In general, the positive contributions were higher
for the mitochondrial genes (especially 16S), than for
nuclear genes (Table 3).
Six different partitioning schemes, ranging from one
to 13 partitions (Table 1), were tested to establish the

optimal number of data partitions (following Li et al.
[49]) for the final analysis. The results showed that the
13 partition model was the best choice (Table 1); however, ML analysis conducted with the other partitioning

schemes resulted in the same final topology, with minor
differences in branch length and support values (not
shown).
Throughout the text and in the figures, measures of
support are indicated as a series of three numbers on
selected internal branches of the trees subtending
labelled clades, starting with posterior probabilities in
Bayesian analysis (B) and followed by non-parametric
bootstrap percentages from ML and MP analyses,
respectively (e.g. 0.9/87/75, see Figure 4), dashes represent values lower than 0.5 (B) or 50% (ML, MP), and
asterisks represent nodes that were not obtained by B or
MP analyses. Nodes without support values greater than
0.5 (B) or 50% (ML, MP) were collapsed in all trees. A
ML tree summarizing the phylogenetic results is presented in Figure 4. The general tree topology observed

split obtained in Bayesian analysis (B), percentage of bootstrap support obtained by ML, and percentage of bootstrap support obtained by MP
analysis, respectively (1000 bootstrap replicates). Dashes represent values lower than 0.5 (B) or 50% (ML, MP). Nodes not supported by values
higher than 0.5 (B) or 50% (ML, MP) were collapsed. Asterisks represent nodes that were not obtained by B or MP analyses. Clades labelled with
numbers within ovals are discussed in the text and shown in subsequent figures.

in all analyses was very similar, although statistical support was not strong for some nodes. An important difference between results of B and ML versus MP
analyses was that under MP, the Neotropical Ctenoluciidae appeared as sister group of the African Hepsetidae
(instead of sister to Lebiasinidae as in Figure 4), however
this hypothesis has low statistical support in the MP
analysis (Figure 5). Since the most highly resolved

topology was obtained by ML analysis, this topology will
be used to discuss relationships among taxa (Figures. 4,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), but important differences with
results obtained by B and MP analyses will be discussed
in the text. For convenience, clades discussed in the text
also are labelled with numbers in the figures. Base composition was computed for all taxa on the concatenated
alignment excluding constant sites to gauge the effect of

possible base compositional bias on the resulting phylogeny. The percent of G+C (GC content) among 2885
variable sites was relatively homogeneous, ranging
between 41.6% to 53.6%, but only few taxa had extreme
values. For example, sequences with the lowest GC content (lower than 46%) were found among 12 taxa that
are placed widely apart in the resulting phylogeny (e.g.
Phenagoniates, Catoprion, Crenuchus). Likewise,
sequences with the highest GC content (higher than
52%) were found in taxa such as Cyanocharax, Xenocharax, Hollandichthys, Cheirodon, Cynopotamus, and
Chalceus that also are nested in widely separate clades.
Hence, base compositional bias as a source of systematic
error does not seem to affect the phylogenetic results.
Phylogenetic relationships

Although a test of the monophyletic nature of the Characiformes was not the objective of the present study,
rooting the tree in the Cypriniformes resulted in the
Characiformes (clade 01) appearing as a well supported
monophyletic group (values representing B posterior
probability/MP bootstrap/ML bootstrap are: 1/100/87)

Page 10 of 25

in all analyses (Figure 4). Within the Characiformes, the
African families Citharinidae and Distichodontidae (Figure 6, clade 02, 1/78/68) form the sister group to all
remaining members of the order (clade 03). Although
the clade formed by those two families has been found
in all analyses, monophyly of the Distichodontidae was
not supported by the data since Citharinus (Citharinidae) is embedded within that family (Figure 6).
Clade 03 (Figures 4, 6, 1/52/-) is composed by the
Crenuchidae (clade 04) plus all remaining components
of the Characiformes (clade 05). The monophyly of the
Crenuchidae was strongly supported (Figure 6, 1/100/
99) and the data show a clear separation of Crenuchus
and Poecilocharax, subfamily Crenuchinae (1/100/100),
from Characidium and Melanocharacidium, subfamily
Characidiinae (1/100/100). Characidium, however, was
not supported as a monophyletic group, since Melanocharacidium is nested within it (Figure 6).
Although clade 05 (Figure 6, 1/51/*) is not unanimously supported in all analyses, it contains a well-supported group (Figure 6, clade 06, 1/98/57) that includes
the African families Hepsetidae (clade 08, a single

specimen analyzed) and Alestidae (clade 09, 1/100/100).
These two families are the sister group to the remaining
taxa (clade 07, Figure 4, 0.89/-/*), but note that this
topology only received marginal support from Bayesian
analysis.
Clade 07 (Figure 4) is composed by two major
groups, clades 10 (0.98/51/-) and 11 (0.97/-/*) none of
which received unanimous support. Clade 10, however,

Page 11 of 25

is formed by several readily recognized and well-supported characiform families (Figures 4, 7). Within this
clade, the Erythrinidae (clade 12, 1/99/100) is the sister
group of all remaining members (Figure 7, clade 13, 1/
88/63), and has Hoplias as the sister group of Erythrinus plus Hoplerythrinus. Among the remaining taxa in
clade 13, the Parodontidae (clade 14, 1/100/100) form
the sister group to clade 15 (1/100/90), a well

supported group that includes the characid subfamily
Cynodontinae (Figure 7, clade 16, 1/100/100), represented by all three of its recognized genera. Cynodontinae is the sister group to all remaining taxa in this
clade (Figure 7, clade 17, 0.99/81/57). These remaining
taxa within clade 17 are split into two well supported
groups. One of these groups is clade 18 (Figure 7,
0.99/72/80) composed of the Hemiodontidae plus Serrasalmidae. The other group is the “Anostomoidea”
(clade 19, 1/99/86), previously obtained by Vari [9,26],
Buckup [8] and Calcagnotto et al. [32], and composed
by the families Anostomidae, Chilodontidae, Prochilodontidae and Curimatidae, all of which receive unanimous
support,
however,
their
reciprocal
interrelationship could not be solved herein.
The second group within clade 07 is clade 11 (Figures
4, 8, 0.97/-/*), obtained by ML, but only supported by a
significant Bayesian probability. It is composed by the
clade 29 (1/61/-) formed by the families Ctenoluciidae
(clade 31, 1/98/99) and Lebiasinidae (clade 32, 1/100/

Page 12 of 25

100), and clade 30, that received strong support in all
analyses (1/99/94). Within clade 30, the genus Chalceus
(clade 33, 1/100/100) is the sister group of all remaining
taxa (Figure 8, clade 34, 1/96/65).
Clade 34, although well supported (1/96/55), includes
three monophyletic subunits, clades 35 (1/96/68), 36 (1/
92/-), and 37(1/100/92) whose relationships were not
resolved (Figure 4). Clade 35 is itself split into two well
supported groups. One of them is clade 38 (1/100/97)
composed by the Iguanodectinae and Bryconops affinis,
and the other group is clade 39 (1/100/98) that contains
the Acestrorhynchidae, Roestinae and a well supported
group (clade 43, 1/97/94) with Hoplocharax goethei,
Heterocharax macrolepis and Gnathocharax steindachneri. Some differences from the ML topology shown in
Figures 4 and 8 were obtained by MP analysis, where
Gnathocharax and Hoplocharax are sister taxa (Figure
5). In the Bayesian analysis, the Acestrorhynchidae
appeared as the sister group of Roestinae (with low posterior probability = 0.71).

Clade 36 includes two monophyletic units (Figure 9,
1/92/-). Clade 44 (1/100/64) formed by representatives
of the characid subfamilies Triportheinae (Lignobrycon
myersi and Triportheus), Clupeacharacinae, and the
Agoniatinae and the incertae sedis characid Engraulisoma taeniatum. Clade 45 (0.97/77/-) is formed by the
distinctive family Gasteropelecidae (clade 46, 1/100/100)
and clade 47 (1/100/100) by the characid subfamily Bryconinae plus Salminus.
Clade 37 is very well supported (1/100/92) and composed by four monophyletic groups. The first is the
genus Spintherobolus (Figure 9, clade 50, 1/100/100).
This is a striking phylogenetic placement, since
Spintherobolus was until now considered a component
of the characid subfamily Cheirodontinae, but the other
putative members of this subfamily are nested within
clade 77 (Figure 11), one of the groups nested in clade
53. Spintherobolus is the sister group of clade 51 (Figure

Page 13 of 25

9, 1/89/-), composed by three monophyletic units, clade
52 that is the sister group of the monophyletic unit
composed by clades 54 and 55 (Figure 9). Clade 52 (Figure 10, 1/100/100) includes elements of the subfamilies
Stethaprioninae, Rhoadsiinae and species of other 29
genera such as Gymnocorymbus, Nematobrycon, Moenkhausia, and Oligosarcus. Within this group also are
placed species of Astyanax, Hemigrammus, Hyphessobrycon, and Jupiaba but the monophyly of these genera is
not supported by the results.
Within clade 54 (Figure 11, 1/68/*), Exodon paradoxus
and Roeboexodon guyanensis form the sister group to
two species of Tetragonopterus (clade 73), the only
genus in the Tetragonopterinae, plus Microschemobrycon casiquiare, and five genera of the Characinae (clade
75). Microschemobrycon casiquiare appears as the sister
group of all the Characinae (Figure 11, clade 74, 1/100/
100). In all analyses, the monophyly of the Characinae

recently be considered to be the Stevardiinae according

to Mirande [23]; albeit with the addition of Markiana

from those of the earlier study by Weitzman et al. [20]
under which the members of their more restricted Stevardiinae fall into different subunits of clade 55 (Figure
12). These are clade 80 (1/100/100) including

Tyttocharax madeirae and Xenurobrycon pteropus, part
of clade 82 formed by Corynopoma riisei, Gephyrocharax atracaudatus, Pseudocorynopoma heterandria,
and by Planaltina which is located inside clade 83. The
Stevardiinae of Weitzman et al. [20] additionally differs
from clade 55 in not including representatives of Bryconamericus, Bryconadenos, Ceratobranchia, Creagrutus,
Cyanocharax, Hemibrycon, Hypobrycon, Knodus, Odontostoechus, Piabarchus, and Piabina all of which were
considered incertae sedis in the Characidae by Lima et
al. [29]. In the analysis, Bryconamericus emperador does
not form a monophyletic group with B. exodon, the type
species of this genus, a result indicating the non-monophyly of the genus.
Some key alternative hypotheses were tested to assess
their support in light of the new molecular evidence.
The topologies derived from studies by Lucena and
Menezes [13], Calcagnotto et al. [32], and Mirande
[22,23] produced likelihood scores that are significantly
worse than the score of the ML tree (lnL = - 159175.3

obtained with Treefinder), and are therefore rejected by
the new data (Table 4). However, the ML tree (summarized in Figure 4) and several topologies with alternative
branching patterns among at the basal-most nodes are
statistically indistinguishable under maximum likelihood
(Table 4). Ln Likelihood differences of up to 40 units
from the ML tree score are not significantly rejected by
the SH and AU tests. A set of nine topologies tested
involve alternative placements among the following
early-branching lineages of Characiformes: Distichodontidae + Citharinidae (clade 02), Crenuchidae (clade 04),
Alestidae + Hepsetidae (clade 06), Parodontidae (clade
14), Erythrinidae (clade 12), Lebiasinidae (clade 32), Ctenoluciidae (clade31) and clade 15 (Cynodontidae, Anostomoidea, Serrasalmidae and Hemiodontidae). Although
an exhaustive search of all possible trees with alternative
branching patterns of these lineages was not performed,
results from the tested topologies show that at least five
of the nine trees cannot be rejected under this criterion.
This result is consistent with the low support values

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:275
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/275

obtained for clades 03, 05, 07, 10, 11, 13, and 29 (Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Therefore, the relative position of
these groups remain unresolved in our study, as
reflected in Figure 13. Interestingly, a topology that
reflects reciprocal monophyly of African and Neotropical groups obtained a LnL score only 37.2 units worse
from the ML score and is only marginally worse than
the ML topology.

Discussion
Although many important studies have been conducted
to infer relationships among families in the Characiformes at different levels, this problem was previously
only partially tested because of incomplete sampling
across the order [8,22,23,32,59] or due to a lack of resolution in the data [30]. But some consensus seems to be
emerging [60]. The studies of Ortí and Meyer [30],
Buckup [8], Calcagnotto et al. [32] and the present
results (Figures 4, 6) corroborate the hypothesis of Vari
[25] that the Citharinidae and Distichodontidae form a
monophyletic lineage and are the sister group to all
other Characiformes. Topology tests suggest that alternative placement of this lineage cannot be rejected, and
our data suggest that some components of the Distichodontidae (Distichodus) may be more closely related to
the Citharinidae (Citharinus) than to other taxa now
assigned to the Distichodontidae (Figure 6). This conclusion runs counter to the morphological evidence, in
particular the very unusual mobile hinge between the
dentary and more posterior components of the lower
jaw [24] and should be further tested using additional
taxa and molecular characters.
The second lineage observed in our results is the
family Crenuchidae (Figures 4, 6). Up to this time, the
position of the Crenuchidae among characiforms has
been problematic (Figures 1, 2b) with different authors
suggesting alternative phylogenetic placements
[8,23,30,32]. Even though our results suggest that this
group forms one of the early branching events within
the order, support for this position is not strong and
should be considered provisional. Only five taxa of the
Crenuchidae were included in this analysis (Figure 6),
but the monophyly and distinctiveness of these taxa
received strong support in our study, as does its division
into the subfamilies Crenuchinae and Characidiinae as
proposed by Buckup [8]. On the other hand, the two
analyzed species of Characidium did not appear as sister
taxa, suggesting the genus may be polyphyletic (Figure
6) a hypothesis that should be tested in the future with
additional data.
Results based on Bayesian and ML analyses strongly
suggest a close relationship between the Alestidae and
Hepsetidae (clade 06, Figures 4, 6), a conclusion at variance with hypotheses proposed by Ortí and Meyer [30],

Page 17 of 25

Buckup [8], Calcagnotto et al. [32], and Zanata and Vari
[5]. In our MP analysis the Hepsetidae appears, however,
as the sister group of the Ctenoluciidae as proposed by
Buckup [8]. Unfortunately, the backbone nodes in the
phylogeny separating Hepsetidae and Ctenoluciidae (Figure 4) are all weakly supported by ML and MP analyses,
and the topology tests suggest that alternative placements of this lineage are not significantly different
(Table 4). Interestingly, our study (in agreement with
Calcagnotto et al. [32], and Arroyave and Stiassny [61])
indicates that the Alestidae is not the sister group of
Chalceus as proposed by Zanata and Vari [5] and Mirande [22,23] based on morphological evidence.
All of the analyses in this study strongly support a
large Neotropical clade composed by the “Anostomoidea” (Anostomidae, Chilodontidae, Curimatidae, Prochilodontidae), plus Cynodontinae, Serrasalmidae,
Hemiodontidae (Figure 7, clade 15, 1/100/90).
Although other authors suggested a close relationship
among some of these families [8,9,30,32] the final composition and arrangement of this group arrived at in

this study represents a novel hypothesis of relationship
among these taxa. In some of our results, the Erythrinidae appears as the sister group of clade 13, (albeit
with low support especially by ML and MP criteria), a
hypothesis at variance with morphologically based studies which associated the family in varying combinations with the Ctenoluciidae, Hepsetidae and
Lebiasinidae [62]. In contrast, Calcagnotto et al. [32]
obtained support for a sister group relationship
between the Erythrinidae and Crenuchidae. If supported by future studies our hypothesis would indicate
that many of the apparent morphological synapomorphies among the Ctenoluciidae, Hepsetidae and Lebiasinidae may be convergences perhaps associated with
modifications necessary for predatory life styles. At
this stage, however, relationships among these early
branching lineages of characiforms (Erythrinidae, Crenuchidae, Ctenoluciidae, Alestidae, Hepsetidae, Lebiasinidae, Parodontidae, and clade 15) remain poorly
resolved. Our results, however, indicate that within the
Erythrinidae, Erythrinus and Hoplerythrinus form a
monophyletic group which is the sister group of
Hoplias. This is the first published hypothesis of

relationship among genera of the Erythrinidae and
should be tested in further studies in this family.
The monophyly of Cynodontidae, as proposed by
Lucena and Menezes [13], is rejected by our phylogenetic analysis and topology tests (Figure 6 and Table 4);
instead, representatives of Roestinae (Roestes and Gilbertolus) are placed more closely related to the Acestrorhynchidae (Figure 8). The monophyly of the
Cynodontinae as proposed by Toledo-Piza [17] was,
however, corroborated but internal relationships among
the genera of the Cynodontinae found in the present
study differ, since herein we find Rhaphiodon and
Hydrolycus as sister groups while Toledo-Piza [17] proposed Rhaphiodon as the sister group of Cynodon.
A sister group relationship between the Hemiodontidae and Serrasalmidae (clade 18, Figure 7) has never
been proposed. Calcagnotto et al. [32], however,
hypothesized that the Serrasalmidae forms the sister
group of a clade consisting of five Neotropical families,
one of which was the Hemiodontidae (Figure 1). The
monophyly of the Hemiodontidae as proposed by Langeani [27] is corroborated. The piranhas and pacus form
a distinct and strongly monophyletic group, historically

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:275
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/275

considered a subunit of the Characidae; however, the
distinctive external anatomy of the members of the serrasalmids [63] and its phylogenetic separation from
other taxa typically associated with the Characidae lead
various authors to consider this group as a family distinct from the Characidae (e.g., Ortí et al. [7]). Based on
the arrived at scheme of relationships, and in order to
keep the family Characidae monophyletic, we also
recognize the family Serrasalmidae as valid. Although
some genera and many species of the Serrasalmidae
were not included in the present study, phylogenetic
relationships within the family are in agreement with
more detailed studies (e.g., Ortí et al. [7]).
The large assemblage composed by the Anostomidae,
Chilodontidae, Prochilodontidae and Curimatidae supported in our results (Figures 4, 7) is similar to that
obtained by Vari [9] and corroborated by Buckup [8]
based on data from Vari [9]. In light of an extensive series of unusual modifications of the gill arches and anterior portion of the vertebral column, Vari [9] found a
close relationship between the Chilodontidae and Anostomidae. Herein, the position of the Chilodontidae was
unresolved, thus, the hypothesis of Vari [9] about the
pattern of relationships among these families should be
tested in the future with the inclusion of more data and
taxa.
Monophyly and composition of Characidae

At present two conflicting hypothesis are available
regarding the family Characidae. A broad concept is
that employed by Nelson [1] and Reis et al. [6] in which
12 subfamilies and about a hundred incertae sedis genera are included in this family. This concept is very
close to that proposed by Mirande [22,23] that differs
from the schemes of previous authors by the exclusion
of Serrasalmidae from, and inclusion of the Acestrorhynchidae and Cynodontidae in, the Characidae (Figure
2). According to Mirande [23] this broad Characidae is
characterized by eight synapomorphies, only one of
which, the fusion of the anteriormost procurrent caudalfin rays into medial bony plates running parallel to the
remaining rays (character 305), is an unreversed and
uncontradicted synapomorphy of the Characidae. A
more restricted concept of the Characidae is that proposed by Malabarba and Weitzman [19] according to
whom this family is composed only by characiform species lacking the supraorbital bone (Figure 2). This
restricted group is recognized by Mirande [22,23] who
proposed that the absence of a supraorbital bone characterizes a monophyletic group of “distal” characids.
The present results could be interpreted in alternative
modes taxonomically but in order to maintain the previously recognized families Cynodontidae, Acestrorhynchidae and Gasteropelecidae and in order to simplify

Page 19 of 25

the recognition of the family Characidae we suggest
usage of a more restricted composition for this family,
as described below.
Clade 30, a robust result in all analyses (Figures 4, 8),
encompasses all species currently grouped in the Characidae (sensu Reis et al. [6]), with the exception of the
Serrasalmidae but with the addition of the Gasteropelecidae, Acestrorhynchidae and Roestinae (a subfamily of
the Cynodontidae sensu Lucena and Menezes [13]) (Figures 4, 5, 8). The genus Chalceus, previously placed
with Alestidae by Zanata and Vari [5] and Mirande
[22,23] based on morphological features, was found here
as the basal branch in clade 30, a hypothesis also congruent with results of Calcagnotto et al. [32]. Since
Chalceus belongs to an important monophyletic lineage
either as the sister group of a large assemblage of Neotropical characids, as proposed herein, or closely related
to the Alestidae as suggested by the morphological analysis [5] we recognize the family Chalceidae in the sense
of Albert et al. [64] consisting of the species of Chalceus, to highlight this phylogenetically significant monophyletic group (Figure 13).
Clade 35 (Figure 8) contains the representatives of
Acestrorhynchidae, the subfamilies Iguanodectinae and
Roestinae, some genera of Characinae and Bryconops.
The Iguanodectinae (two valid genera) is placed as the
sister group of Bryconops affinis (Figure 8). Mirande
[23] also found a monophyletic Iguanodectinae closely
related to a named ‘Bryconops’ clade. In order to recognize this monophyletic assemblage within the Characiformes, we propose that Iguanodectes, Piabucus and
Bryconops be united in the family Iguanodectidae (Figure 13).
Acestrorhynchidae is placed as the sister group of the
Roestinae, a subfamily that is presently assigned to the
Cynodontidae, along with some species of the Characinae (Gnathocharax, Heterocharax, Hoplocharax) (Figure
8). A close relationship between the Acestrorhynchidae
and Roestinae was previously proposed by Lucena and
Menezes [13]. Alternatively, Malabarba and Weitzman
[19] questioned the relationship between the Roestinae
and Cynodontinae because of the presence in adults of
Gilbertolus and Roestes of bony hooks on the fin rays
versus the absence of those elaborations in the fins of
Cynodon, Rhaphiodon and Hydrolycus. Our results indicate that the Cynodontinae and Roestinae are not closely related, refuting the monophyly of the
Cynodontidae of Lucena and Menezes [13]. Mirande
[22] found a monophyletic group composed by Acestrorhynchus pantaneiro and Rhaphiodon vulpinus (the only
species of the Cynodontidae analyzed in that study), a
hypothesis which is refuted in the present study since
Rhaphiodon and the other two genera of the Cynodontinae, are grouped with high support in clade 10 (Figure

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:275
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/275

7). Lucena [65] was the first author to propose the
monophyly of a clade composed of Gnathocharax, Heterocharax, Hoplocharax and Lonchogenys. Mirande [22]
found the same monophyletic group and proposed the
subfamily Heterocharacinae to contain Gnathocharax
(not studied by that author), Heterocharax, Hoplocharax
and Lonchogenys. Although representatives of Lonchogenys were not analyzed in the present study, a monophyletic group formed by Gnathocharax, Heterocharax
and Hoplocharax also was obtained in our results (clade
43, Figures 4, 5, 8). The genera Gnathocharax, Heterocharax, Hoplocharax and Lonchogenys were assigned to
the Characinae by Lucena and Menezes [58] but differ
from the other members of this subfamily in several
synapomorphies [22,23]. Therefore, we suggest the
retention of the Heterocharacinae (sensu Mirande [22])
to refer to taxa in clade 43. In order to delimit our
clade 39 as monophyletic unit within characiforms we
propose that the Acestrorhynchidae as currently defined
[66] be ranked as a subfamily (Acestrorhynchinae); and
the group composed by the Roestinae, Heterocharacinae
(sensu [22]) and Acestrorhynchinae, as newly defined,
form a more encompassing Acestrorhynchidae (Figure
13).
Another well supported group of note is clade 36 in
which the Agoniatinae (both of the recognized species
included in our analysis) forms a monophyletic lineage
with the Clupeacharacinae (only one recognized species)
and the group formed by these taxa is the sister group
of Engraulisoma (a single described species). This
monophyletic clade is, in turn, the sister group of Triportheus (two of nineteen species included) in the B and
ML analyses (Figure 9) or as the sister group of the Triportheinae in the MP analysis (Figure 5). In the B and
ML analyses Lignobrycon (a single Recent species) is the
sister group of all remaining taxa in the clade 44 (Figures 4, 9). Relationships across the spectrum of these
groups were not previously investigated since earlier
phylogenetic studies involving characiforms and/or characids included only a few representatives from this clade
[22,23,30,32,33]. Malabarba [15] found eight synapomorphies supporting a close relationship between Triportheus and Lignobrycon, but it is uncertain whether
the intervening taxa in the phylogeny arrived at herein
were considered in her analysis. It would be informative
to revisit the morphological hypothesis within the context of the results arrived at herein. In order to highlight
this monophyletic lineage we expand the Triportheinae
to include the genera Agoniates, Clupeacharax, Triportheus, Engraulisoma, and Lignobrycon and recognize
it as the Triportheidae (Figure 13).
The Gasteropelecidae (clade 46) is placed as the sister
group of the Bryconinae plus Salminus (clade 47, Figures 4, 5, 9), albeit without unanimous support. The

Page 20 of 25

three genera of the Gasteropelecidae formed a monophyletic group in which Carnegiella is the sister group
of Gasteropelecus (Figure 9). In contrast, Javonillo et al.
[33] found Thoracocharax to be the sister group of Gasteropelecus with Carnegiella the sister group of that
clade. In his pre-cladistic analysis of the Gasteropelecidae, Weitzman [67] considered Carnegiella to be an
evolutionary “development” of Gasteropelecus, mainly
through structural losses. Subsequently Weitzman [68]
stated that Thoracocharax has a “somewhat more primitive morphology with respect to other members of the
Gasteropelecinae (= Gasteropelecidae)” and arose from a
common ancestor with Gasteropelecus. He also proposed that Carnegiella “seems to be a neotenic form of
Gasteropelecus and directly derived from it”. Our results
are, thus, congruent with the proposals of Weitzman
[67,68] but not the hypothesis of Javonillo et al. [33].
A close relationship between Brycon and Salminus
(Figure 9) was recognized by Géry [63] who suggested
that the tribe Salminini was part of the Bryconinae. This
hypothesis was corroborated in the phylogenetic studies
of Ortí and Meyer [30], Calcagnotto et al. [32], and
Javonillo et al. [33]. Calcagnotto et al. [32] found that
Salminus was placed inside Brycon and Javonillo et al.
[33] found Salminus to be the sister group of the two
analyzed species of Brycon. Herein, the monophyly of
Brycon was rejected since B. insignis appeared more closely related to Henochilus wheatlandii than it is to B.
amazonicus. This would indicate that further studies are
necessary to determine whether Henochilus must be
synonymized with Brycon I. Mirande [22] previously
proposed the subfamily Salmininae which is corroborated in the present study. To highlight the monophyletic group composed by the Bryconinae and Salmininae
we expand the previous concept of the Bryconidae to
include the Salmininae (Figure 13).
A strongly supported monophyletic group, clade 37,
was observed in all our analysis including what we
recognize as the family Characidae (Figures 9, 13). The
composition of this group is largely comparable to the
taxon of that name previously recognized by Malabarba
and Weitzman [19] and is characterized morphologically
by the lack of a supraorbital bone in its members, a
synapomorphy of the Characidae as per this definition
(Figure 2a, character 2). The sole difference between the
Characidae of this study and that of Malabarba and
Weitzman [19] is that under our results the Iguanodectinae is more closely related to Bryconops than it is to
the taxa herein assigned to the Characidae (see discussion above).
An additional morphological character potentially supporting the hypothesis of the monophyly of clade 37 is
the emergence of the hyoid artery from the anterior ceratohyal proximate to the articulation of that bone with

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:275
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/275

the posterior ceratohyal. This feature noted by Castro
[69], was more recently used by Mirande ([23]; character
178) as a synapomorphy of his node 204 which in that
phylogeny included all characiforms without a supraorbital bone.
In all analyses Spintherobolus (clade 50) appears as sister group of all remaining characids in clade 37 (Figure
9). Three of the four recognized species of Spintherobolus were sequenced, excluding the type species (S. papilliferus). This result indicates that the subfamily
Cheirodontinae as now defined [70] is not monophyletic
in that the remaining members of the subfamily do not
resolve as the sister group of Spintherobolus in this analysis. Recent investigations of the monophyly of the
Cheirodontinae and the placement of the Spintherobolus
involved only a subset of the members of the subfamily
[22,23,33,71] and the results herein indicate that the
question should be reinvestigated utilizing more complete intrasubfamilial representation.
The remaining species of the Characidae are included
in three clades, each with large numbers of species:
clade 52 (Figure 10), clade 54 (Figure 11), and clade 55
(Figure 12) in the Bayesian and ML analyses. Interestingly these three same clades, named clades C, B, and
A, respectively, were found in the molecular phylogeny
of Javonillo et al. [33] using sequences of some different
genes. Clades 54 and 55 (Figure 9) also form a monophyletic group, as proposed by Javonillo et al. [33].
Clade 55 was recognized by Mirande [22,23] as a broad
Stevardiinae which is partially in agreement with our
results and this name was here applied to clade A. In
light of the still evolving state of knowledge of many
genera and species in the Characidae we prefer to not
formally name the clades B, and C as proposed by Javonillo et al. [33].
Clade 52 (Figure 10) is equivalent to clade C of Javonillo et al. [33]. This is the most species-rich group
within the Characiformes with more than 500 species
[72]. This clade encompasses the speciose genera Astyanax, Hemigrammus, Hyphessobrycon, and Jupiaba, all of
which are polyphyletic according to the results of this
study and Moenkhausia which was previously demonstrated to be polyphyletic by Mirande [23] and Javonillo
et al. [33]. Although we found several strongly supported groups discussed below, some basal nodes could
not be resolved. Several groups with overall similar morphology and body shape were well supported, such as
the group composed by Hollandichthys, Rachoviscus and
Bario and the group consisting of Ctenobrycon plus Psellogrammus. An interesting and well supported group
was formed by Stygichthys typhlops, a cave fish [73], and
Coptobrycon bilineatus, as sister group of Probolodus
heterostomus, Deuterodon iguape and Myxiops aphos.
All of these species inhabit very ancient land formations

Page 21 of 25

in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil,
which are also the areas of residence of primitive
lineages in other groups of fishes such as the Trichomycteridae [74] and Loricariidae [75].
Clade 52 has the four genera of Stethaprioninae as a
monophyletic group, thereby corroborating the hypothesis advanced by Reis [12] based on morphological evidence. Reis [12] found that Brachychalcinus and
Stethaprion are sister-groups to each other, Orthospinus
is sister to that clade, and Poptella is the most basal
genus in the group. The phylogenetic relationships
found herein (Figure 10) differ from that hypothesis. We
also found Gymnocorymbus ternetzi to be the sister
group of the Stethaprioninae as proposed by Mirande
[22,23]. The Rhoadsiinae, represented in our study only
by Carlana eigenmanni, also falls within clade 52 and is
hypothesized to be closely related to Nematobrycon palmeri (Figure 10), a result at variance with the hypothesis
of Mirande [22,23].
The second of the large clades in the Characidae is
clade 54 (Figure 11). A similar monophyletic group but
represented by a smaller number of taxa was observed
in the study by Javonillo et al. [33] and named clade B
by those authors. This group is composed by two main
lineages (clades 69 and 70). Within clade 69, clade 71
includes two genera, Exodon and Roeboexodon, now
considered incertae sedis in the Characidae, as a monophyletic group that is sister to all remaining taxa in the
clade. These species share a number of distinctive external features, most prominent among these being the
mammiliform teeth external to the upper jaw. Exodon
and Roeboexodon were grouped with Bryconexodon (not
analyzed herein) in a monophyletic clade by Mirande
[22] who hypothesized that the group was closely related
to the Characinae. In contrast, our study has this group
related to a larger clade composed of the Tetragonopterinae, Microschemobrycon casiquiare, and the Characinae
(clade 72, Figure 11). A relationship of Exodon with the
Tetragonopterinae and Characinae was also proposed by
Javonillo et al. [33].
One of the interesting results in our study was the sister group relationship between Microschemobrycon casiquiare and the Characinae (clade 74, Figure 11).
Mirande [22,23] found Microschemobrycon to be closely
related to the other genera in his Aphyoditeinae, a
group which had a composition similar to that initially
proposed by Géry [63]. The Characinae in our results is
similar to the group of that name as defined by Mirande
[22,23] but as noted above, excluding Exodon and Roeboexodon. The Characinae of our study differs from that
proposed by Lucena and Menezes [58] by the exclusion
of Gnathocharax, Hoplocharax and Heterocharax (see
discussion above). In our results, the two analyzed species of Cynopotamus, C. kincaidi and C. venezuelae do

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:275
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/275

not form a monophyletic group thereby raising questions as to the monophyly of the genus. The Tetragonopterinae, restricted to the genus Tetragonopterus by
Reis [76] is monophyletic and the sister group of the
Characinae plus Microschemobrycon. Our data refutes
the hypothesis of Mirande [23] who proposed a large
Tetragonopterinae, including several genera which are
not related to Tetragonopterus in the present study.
The second large group included in clade B is clade 70
(Figure 11) that is composed by the Aphyocharacinae
and several genera currently considered incertae sedis in
the Characidae. This group has a composition similar to
that of the Aphyocharacinae plus Paragoniatinae of Géry
[63] which was grouped by Mirande [22] in his redefined Aphyocharacinae (a subfamily that also includes
Inpaichthys and Rachoviscus - not sampled in that
study). The inclusion of Rachoviscus in the Aphyocharacinae was previously refuted by Thomaz et al. [77]. In
our study, Inpaichthys and Rachoviscus belong to clade
52 (Figure 10) while Aphyocharacidium bolivianum
appears as the sister group of all members of clade 76.
Mirande [22,23], alternatively, suggested that Aphyocharacidium be included in his Aphyoditeinae. Relationships among these genera in our results differ notably
from those proposed by Mirande [22]. In our results,
the Aphyocharacinae appears as the sister group of Prionobrama and this group is, in turn, the sister group of
the clade composed by Paragoniates, Phenagoniates,
Xenagoniates and Leptagoniates. These last four genera
share a very characteristic morphology with a very compressed, elongate body and a long anal fin [63].
The third large group in clade 54 is the subfamily
Cheirodontinae (clade 77, Figure 11). As discussed
above, however, the position of Spintherobolus at the
base of the Characidae renders the Cheirodontinae
sensu Malabarba [70] paraphyletic. The monophyly of
the Cheirodontinae was previously supported by Calcagnotto et al. [32], Mirande [22] and Javonillo et al. [33]
but without the analysis of a significant number of genera and species, most notably Spintherobolus. The division of the Cheirodontinae into the tribes Compsurini
and Cheirodontini [14] was also not supported by the
results of our analysis. Notably, we found that the transAndean cheirodontin species, Nanocheirodon insignis
and Pseudocheirodon arnoldi, are the sister group of
genera and species occurring in the cis-Andean region.
This suggests a very old origin for this clade and more
inclusive clades, predating the uplift of the northern
Andean cordilleras.
Clade 55 (Figure 12) partially corresponds to clade A
of Malabarba and Weitzman [19] who noted the similarity in composition of their clade A to a group proposed
by Géry [63]. The monophyly of this clade was corroborated in the taxonomically broad study of Weitzman et

Page 22 of 25

al. [20] and Menezes and Weitzman [21], and in the
analyses of Calcagnotto et al. [32] and Javonillo et al.
[33], albeit based on a fewer number of analyzed taxa in
these latter studies. Inside this group, we found a monophyletic Glandulocaudinae, sensu Menezes and Weitzman [21] (clade 84, Figure 12) in which Glandulocauda
appears as the sister group of Lophiobrycon and with
the clade formed by those taxa as the sister group of
Mimagoniates. This is the first real test of the hypothesis of the monophyly of the Glandulocaudinae as
delimited in recent studies, since only Mimagoniates
was analyzed in previous studies [22,32,33]. This
hypothesis differs from that of Castro et al. [78] and
Menezes and Weitzman [21] who found Glandulocauda
to be the sister group of Mimagoniates and the clade
consisting of those taxa as the sister group of Lophiobrycon. An analysis incorporating additional species of
Glandulocauda and particularly Mimagoniates is necessary to thoroughly investigate the relationships among
these genera.
The second previous recognized characid subfamily
found in clade 55 is the Stevardiinae, sensu Weitzman et
al. [20]. Although only six of the seventeen recognized
genera of the Stevardiinae were included in this study,
the results indicate that this subfamily, as proposed by
Weitzman et al. [20], is polyphyletic (Figure 12).
Gephyrocharax and Corynopoma (tribe Corynopomini)
are the sister group of Pseudocorynopoma (tribe Hysteronotini) with this group the sister group of the Glandulocaudinae. Xenurobrycon and Tyttocharax (tribe
Xenurobryconini), appear as more basal clades within
clade 79 while Planaltina (tribe Diapomini) appears as
more derived but not closely related to the remaining
analyzed species of the Stevardiinae, sensu Weitzman et
al. [20].
The most basal group within clade 55 is composed of
Markiana nigripinnis and Bryconamericus emperador
(clade 78, Figure 12). The inclusion of M. nigripinnis
within clade A is a novel hypothesis. Although this species has ii+9 dorsal-fin rays, the plesiomorphic condition
according Malabarba and Weitzman [19], other morphological characteristics including spermatozoa ultrastructure which is very similar to those of the noninseminating members of clade 55, the presence of only
four teeth in the inner premaxillary tooth row, and a
short triangular ectopterygoid which is never more than
twice the length of the palatine [79] corroborate the
hypothesis that M. nigripinnis belongs to clade 55. Mirande [22,23] did not find Markiana to be a member of
clade A, but did propose a sister group relationship
between M. nigripinnis and Bryconamericus scleroparius.
Although only two species of Bryconamericus were
included in the present study, the genus appears as
polyphyletic since B. exodon, the type species of the

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:275
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/275

genus, is hypothesized to be more closely related to
Odontostoechus and Hypobrycon than to its nominal
congener (Figure 12). A polyphyletic Bryconamericus
was also obtained in the analyses by Mirande [22,23]
and Javonillo et al. [33]; results emphasizing the need
for a reappraisal of the limits of the genus. A monophyletic clade composed by Odontostoechus, Hypobrycon
and some species of Bryconamericus and Cyanocharax
was proposed by Javonillo et al. [33] and parallels the
results of this study. The sister group of these genera in
our analysis is the clade composed by Piabina argentea
and Piabarchus analis. Our study is the first one to
investigate the relationships of Piabarchus and this conclusion runs counter to the hypothesis of a sister group
relationship between Piabina and Creagrutus proposed
by Vari and Harold [18] and Mirande [22,23] based on
morphological characters, but not that arrived at by
Javonillo et al. [33] in their molecular analysis. A final
monophyletic lineage within clade 55 is composed of
Knodus meridae (the type species of the genus), Bryconadenos tanaothoros, and Ceratobranchia cf. delotaenia
(Figure 12). A sister group relationship between Knodus
and Bryconadenos was previously suggested by Weitzman et al. [20] and corroborated by Javonillo et al. [33].
Leaving aside differences in the included species, Mirande’s [22] concept of the Stevardiinae is equivalent to
clade 55 of this study other than for the addition of
Markiana nigripinnis. As discussed previously the concept of the Stevardiinae proposed by Weitzman et al.
[20] differs significantly from our results. We consequently recognize clade 55 as the Stevardiinae in the
sense of Mirande [22] expanded to include Markiana
nigripinnis.

Conclusions
The definition of the Characidae (our clade 37) as proposed herein (Figure 13) is the most significant contribution of the present study, with both molecular (B = 1,
ML = 100, MP = 92) and morphological evidence (lack
of a supraorbital bone and emergence of the hyoid
artery from the posterior portion of the anterior ceratohyal) supporting the recognition of a proposed monophyletic group encompassing approximately one-half of
all Recent characiforms.
As noted in the introductory comments, the Characiformes in general and within that order, the Characidae
in particular, are speciose assemblages encompassing a
number of very distinctive taxa. The results of the present analysis of a large number of species including on
the one hand representatives of all of the main lineages
of the Characiformes and on the other a large dataset
including genes with slow to moderate evolutionary
rates provided insight into the phylogenetic relationships
of a number of previously problematic taxa. Most

Page 23 of 25

notable among these were various genera previously
placed as incertae sedis within the Characidae. These
results demonstrate that this combination of large numbers of taxa and large datasets should be a productive
method for future investigations of phylogenetic relationships among large groups such as the Characiformes. Such future analysis both within the
Characiformes and in other groups will presumably provide insight as to the degree to which differences in
results between studies with varying degree of taxonomic inclusiveness are a function of the absence of critical taxa versus inadequate datasets resulting in poor
degrees of phylogenetic resolution. Notwithstanding the
fact that the present study was based on multiple genes
and the largest number of species to date in a molecular
analysis of the Characiformes, future studies including
additional genera and particularly species of species-rich
genera are necessary to resolve the questions noted in
the discussion and to further improve our understanding of phylogenetic relationships across the
Characiformes.
