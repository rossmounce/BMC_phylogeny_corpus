Abstract
Background: Brazil holds the largest commercial cattle populations worldwide. Local cattle breeds can be
classified according to their origin, as exotic or Creole. Exotic breeds imported in the last 100 years, both zebuine
and taurine, currently make up the bulk of the intensively managed populations. Locally adapted Creole breeds,
originated from cattle introduced by the European conquerors derive from natural selection and events of breed
admixture. While historical knowledge exists on the Brazilian Creole breeds very little is known on their genetic
composition. The objective of this study was to assess the levels of genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships
and patterns of taurine/zebuine admixture among ten cattle breeds raised in Brazil.
Results: Significant reduction of heterozygosity exists due both to within-population inbreeding and to breed
differentiation in both subspecies (taurine and zebuine). For taurine breeds the number of markers that contribute
to breed differentiation is larger than for zebuine. A consistently similar number of alleles was seen in both
subspecies for all microsatellites. Four Creole breeds were the most genetically diverse followed by the zebuine
breeds, the two specialized taurine breeds and the Creole Caracu. Pairwise genetic differentiation were all
significant indicating that all breeds can be considered as genetically independent entities. A STRUCTURE based
diagram indicated introgression of indicine genes in the local Creole breeds and suggested that occasional Creole
introgression can be detected in some Zebuine animals.
Conclusion: This study reports on a comprehensive study of the genetic structure and diversity of cattle breeds
in Brazil. A significant amount of genetic variation is maintained in the local cattle populations. The genetic data
show that Brazilian Creole breeds constitute an important and diverse reservoir of genetic diversity for bovine
breeding and conservation. The genetic data was able to shed light on a number of issues related to the local
breeds origin and structure. The Brazilian Creole breeds are all important and viable targets for conservation for
they display peculiar traits both phenotypic and of cultural and historical nature that deserve conservation efforts.

Background
Brazil holds the largest commercial cattle populations
worldwide, with over 190 million animals raised both for
dairy products and meat [1]. Bovine breeds presently
raised in Brazil can be classified into two groups, according to their origin, as exotic or Creole. The group of exotic
breeds includes those imported in the last 50 to 100 years,
both zebuine and taurine, that currently make up the bulk
of the intensively managed populations. Strong directional selection has been shaping these bovine populations in Brazil in the last 40 years mainly through the
intensive use of a small number of elite sires in artificial
insemination as well as embryo transfer procedures. In
spite of the very large census number for some of the most
proeminent breeds such as the zebuine Nellore, Gyr and
their taurine hybrids, the effective population size has
been greatly reduced, although no firm estimate is yet
available. A few years back, Georges and Andersson [2]
estimated an effective population size of nearly 1,000 for
a 10 million animal population of Holstein in the US. It
is reasonable to think that with the increased accessibility
to assisted reproduction practices, a similar picture is currently the case for all intensively managed bovine breeds
in Brazil.
Likewise most European countries and the US, the rapid
growth of these commercially proeminent breeds has happened to the expense of the second group of locally
adapted, genetically heterogeneous breeds. This group of
Creole breeds, also referred as native, local or naturalized
breeds includes those derived from the first cattle populations introduced by the European conquerors around
1500. While all other South American countries received
only Spanish breeds, due to its peculiar colonial origin
Brazil was the only one that received Portuguese breeds
[3]. Natural selection acting in remarkably variable environments throughout the country, together with the
recurrent events of breed admixture led to the development of Creole breeds adapted to a wide range of environments with outstanding levels of phenotypic variability
and improved fitness to local conditions. In the Northeastern regions the Curraleiro breed arised and then
moved to the central states of Minas Gerais and Goías. In
the Southeastern regions the Junqueira and Franqueiro
breeds developed together with the Caracu and Mocho
Nacional. In the South the Criolo Lageano breed appeared
and in the Pantanal region the Pantaneiro breed.
While historical knowledge has been accumulated on the
Brazilian Creole breeds [4-8], very little is known on their
genetic composition. Some studies have analyzed
sequence variation in the hypervariable regions of the
mtDNA and showed, as expected, that both African and
European taurine haplotypes are present in American Creole breeds which is consistent with historical records

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/83

[9,10]. A few reports described preliminary surveys of the
genomic polymorphism of some Creole Brazilian cattle
breeds, based on low information content RAPD markers
that do not allow comparative analyses across independent studies [11,12]. A more systematic and wider scope
study based on the "common language" of microsatellite
markers is needed to understand the genetic diversity of
Brazilian bovine breeds with their peculiar historical origin and present state of endangerment.
In the context of the Guidelines for Development of
National Farm Animal Genetic Resources Management
Plans [13], the FAO proposed an integrated program for
global management of cattle genetic resources using a
common set of reference microsatellite markers. Studies
of genetic relationships between cattle breeds using a
common measuring tool not only provides useful and
comparable information on the evolution of breeds to
present stage, but also supplies data for a scientifically
based development of marker-assisted conservation plans
[14,15]. In recent years a number of studies have reported
the characterization of cattle breeds throughout the world
[16-23]. These studies have progressively used common
sets of microsatellite markers thus facilitating comparative
surveys of diversity and relationship and the consolidation and analysis of large data sets for multiple breeding,
evolutionary and conservation applications.
Following the project proposed for the Animal Genetic
Resources by FAO (MoDAD – Measurement of Domestic
Animal Diversity)[13] the objective of this study was to
assess the levels of genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships and patterns of taurine/zebuine introgression and
admixture among ten cattle breeds raised in Brazil. Diversity was measured at a set of 22 internationally recommended microsatellites, both by FAO and ISAG
(International Society of Animal Genetics) to elucidate
the genetic relationship of a total of 915 animals belonging to five Creole cattle breeds (Pantaneiro – PAN, Curraleiro – CUR, Criolo Lageano – CRL, Mocho Nacional –
MON, and Caracu – CAR) both among them and in comparison with specialized taurine European breeds (Holstein – HOL and Jersey – JER) as well as three major
zebuine breeds raised in Brazil (Nellore – NEL, Gyr – GYR
and Guzerat – GUZ).

Results
Microsatellite markers
A total of 915 animals representing ten Brazilian breeds
was analyzed (Table 1). All microsatellite markers showed
high polymorphism content in all breeds. A total of 278
alleles were detected over all loci in the 915 animals
assayed. Additional file 1 lists all the allele frequency estimates for each microsatellite in each breed. Data will be
submitted to the Cattle Diversity Database[25]. The mean

number of alleles per locus was 13.2 (ranged between 8 at
INRA63 and 23 at TGLA122). Table 2 summarizes the
locus specific descriptive statistics for the 22 microsatellite
markers, consolidating data across breeds for each Bos
subspecies (taurine and zebuine) and for both subspecies
together. Expected locus heterozygosities in both subspecies and all the breeds combined were nominally larger
that the observed heterozygosity for all loci. The only
exception was observed at locus ETH3 in the group of
zebuine breeds although it did not result in a statistically
significant excess of heterozygotes. In the group of taurine
breeds only loci INRA63 and HEL1 and in the zebuine
group only loci INRA35, INRA37, CSSM66, SPS115,
TGLA227, INRA23, ETH3 and BM1824 were found to be
in HWE. All other loci displayed deviations from HWE.
When all breeds combined were analyzed all loci deviated
from HWE (Table 2). The overall loci estimates of
inbreeding showed that in both subspecies groups and the
consolidated set significant reduction of heterozygosity
exists due both to within population inbreeding (FIS) and
to breed differentiation estimated both under the infinitesimal model (FST) and the step-wise mutation model
(RST). A higher estimate of within subspecies inbreeding
was seen for zebuine (0.113) when compared to taurine
(0.074), although the larger sample size assayed for taurine could be partly accountable for this difference. However when an analysis was carried out on equalized
samples sizes of 292 animals per subspecies, results were
the same.
The contribution of the microsatellite markers for breed
differentiation was estimated by the significance of the
FST statistics. The number of loci that contributed to breed
differentiation varied between the two subspecies with a
larger number for taurine when compared to zebuine.
Among the taurine breeds only loci ILSTS5 and HEL5 did
not contribute to breed differentiation. All other twenty
loci had a significant FST with INRA63, INRA5, CSSM33,
ETH10 and TGLA227 as the top five loci with the highest
nominal values with INRA5 with the highest value at
0.102 (Table 2). In the zebuine group on the other hand,

only eight markers contributed to breed differentiation
with a significant FST statistics. These were INRA35,
INRA37, ILSTS5, INRA5, CSSM66, CSSM33, CSSM9 and
ETH152 with the highest significant FST value at 0.054 for
INRA5. Interestingly, the nominally highest FST was estimated for locus ETH10 however it was deemed not significant by the jackknife resampling. Estimated values of
differentiation due to genetic drift under the step-wise
mutation model (RST) were in general more pronounced
than by the FST statistics in absolute values. The overall
loci estimates of FST and RST were similar in both subspecies groups however RST was much higher that FST when
all breeds together were analyzed. The global deficit of
heterozygosity when all breeds of both subspecies were
combined amounted to 0.176 and the global differentiation among all breeds was estimated by FST at 0.098 and
at 0.1861 by RST. Most of this differentiation is likely due
to the well known and marked subspecies genetic difference although genetic variation between breed of the
same subspecies is also significant (see below).
Genetic diversity within breeds
Diversity measures for each breed showed a remarkably
similar mean number of alleles per locus fluctuating
around 8.5. (Table 3). The Creole breeds CRL and PAN
were the most diverse populations with the two highest
mean allelic richness above 9.0. CAR had slightly less than
8 alleles per locus and was the breed with the smallest
allelic richness. Among the zebuine breeds (NEL, GYR,
GUZ) the average allele number was very similar, around
8.7 while the two domesticated taurine breeds were less
diverse with a smaller average number of alleles slightly
above 8.0. Although JER has a smaller sample size than
the other breeds this difference did not generate a noticeable reduction of mean allele number when an equalized
resampling of 50 animals per breed was analyzed. Average
observed and expected heterozigozity ranged from 0.6316
and 0.7409 and 0.7151 and 0.7839 respectively. In all
breeds observed heterozygosity values were nominally
smaller than the expected ones. Out of the 220 marker by
breed HWE tests, 43 were significant, well above the

expected 5%. In all breeds at least one microsatellite
marker deviated from HWE expectations. MON was the
breed where observed and expected heterozigozities were
the closest and where the one deviation observed is less
than the expected number by chance alone (5% of 22 =
1.1). In all other breeds the number of deviated marker
loci cannot be accounted by chance alone. All three
zebuine breeds showed several loci deviated from HWE.
On the taurine side both the commercial breeds HOL and
JER but also the Creole PAN and CUR displayed similar
numbers of significantly deviated loci. Highest values of
FIS were seen for JER followed closely by the three zebuine
breeds GYR, GUZ and NEL and the taurine CUR. The average proportion of shared alleles among animals within
breeds were similar for all breeds although PAN, MON
and CRL had lower values consistent with their highest
observed heterozigosities.
Genetic variation and relationship between breeds
The partitioning of the genetic variation at different levels
resulted in small but significant (p < 0.001) between
breed proportions of the variation in all structures tested
(Table 4). Among the five local Creole breeds variation
was the lowest, estimated at 4.43% closer to the value
found among the three zebuine breeds, at 4.96%. As
expected, highest between groups proportion of variation,
almost 17%, was estimated when only the two specialized
taurine breeds (HOL and JER) were compared together
with the three zebuine breeds. When all breeds were analyzed together, almost 12% of the variation was found
among breeds.

Estimates of pairwise genetic differentiation based on the
infinitesimal model (FST) were all significant after Bonferroni corrections (p < 0.01), indicating that all breeds can
be considered as genetically independent entities. Different genetic distance measures were estimated but all
showed a very high correlation so that only Nei distance,

DA, is reported (Table 5). As expected the highest genetic
distances were observed between taurine and zebuine
breeds such as between JER and NEL (0.3820). Small pairwise distances were observed among the three zebuine
breeds. Among the local Creole breeds the lowest distances were observed between PAN and CUR (0.0841).
CAR is genetically closer to MON (0.099) which in turn is
closer to CRL (0.0861). Among the Creole breeds CRL and
PAN were the closest to the zebuine breed NEL suggesting
a higher frequency of indicine gene introgression in these
two breeds (0.2101 and 0.2320 respectively).
The phylogenetic reconstruction from a UPGMA clustering based on the DA distance matrix yielded a tree with
higher bootstrap values than by the Neighbor Joining
method and consistent with known historical and morphological information (Figure 1a). The tree topology was
confirmed by the relatively high bootstrap values. Four
local Creole breeds CRL, CUR, PAN e MON clustered
closer together, with the other three taurine breeds joining
in separate branches, JER and HOL closer together. GYR,
GUZ and NEL formed a well separated cluster with GYR
and GUZ closer together. A Neighbor-Net analysis further
corroborates this picture, yielding a better view of the
intermediate position of the Creole breeds between the
purely taurine and zebuine breeds, and showing a greater
proximity of the PAN and CRL breeds to the zebuine
group when compared with the other Creole breeds (Figure 1b). An individual-animal-based neighbor-joining
dendrogram built from the estimates of allele shared distances among all the 915 individuals shows that the
majority of animals within each breed closely assembled
in discrete branches, but some exceptions were observed
(Figure 2). Taurine and zebuine breeds were clearly segregated in two discrete branches. However while the taurine
breeds HOL, CAR and JER formed almost compact subbranches with few individuals from these breeds misplaced in other breed's clusters, a high frequency of mis-

Model based clustering at k = 2 resulted in the grouping of

directional matings from the exotic breeds into the local
genomes. Based on the values of Q, the most likely k

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge this is the most comprehensive report on the genetic structure and diversity of bovine
cattle breeds in Brazil, the country with the world largest
commercial cattle population and a peculiar mixed composition of both taurine, zebuine and hybrid breeds. The
genotype data gathered shows that significant amounts of
genetic variation is maintained in the local cattle populations. The Creole breeds CRL, CUR, MON and PAN displayed a distinctly higher allelic richness than both
specialized breeds and still nominally higher than the
zebuine breeds (Table 3) most likely resulting from the
mild selection pressure and a more liberal pattern of herd
management. Exception to this trend is the behavior of
the Creole breed CAR, the one with the smallest allelic
richness and low observed heterozygosity consistent with
its unique history of selective breeding. Our results are

consistent with the observations of Liron et al. [23] when
analyzing a group of ten breeds in Argentina and Bolivia
that included Creole, taurine and zebuine breeds.
Microsatellite diversity
The overall average number of alleles observed at each
locus, consolidating data for all ten breeds, is above the
estimates found in other studies [21,22,26-29]. This larger
number can be explained by the relatively larger sample
sizes analyzed for the several breeds. Rare alleles, with frequencies below 5% were observed in all breeds in almost
every locus (Additional file 1). Estimates of such frequen-

cies below the rule-of-thumb suggested threshold of 5/2n
(where n = number of individuals)[30] which corresponds to ~5/200 = 2.5% for most breeds should be seen
with caution. Several markers displayed a significant deficit of heterozygotes due to within-population inbreeding
in both subspecies and in the combined analysis. Such
result has been commonly observed in surveys of bovine
breeds in other countries [21,23,27]. The occurrence of
null alleles and genotyping errors could also lead to deficiency of heterozygotes. However considering that the
estimates of deficit of heterozygotes for the same marker
locus varied by subspecies and that the set of microsatel-

lites used has been carefully recommended and broadly
used for diversity surveys worldwide [31] this explanation
is unlikely.
Within and between breed genetic variation
The global deficit of heterozygotes (FIT) in the sample of
915 animals studied was relatively high, higher than estimates in other studies that involved local breeds both of
taurine and zebuine origin [23,29,32]. However it is
important to note that in this study Creole taurine breeds
were analyzed in conjunction with specialized taurine
breeds and zebuine breeds thus deliberately inflating the
value of FST. The observed overall reduction of heterozygosity is therefore due in almost equivalent proportions to
within-population inbreeding (FIS = 0.086) and genetic
drift among all ten breeds (FST = 0.098). All breeds displayed a significant reduction in heterozygosity due to
non-random matings within populations (Table 3). The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/83

three zebuine breeds, JER and CUR had the highest and
significant within-population inbreeding coefficients
(FIS). This result most likely reflects the more intense
reproductive management that the zebuine breeds and
JER have been subjected to, with the use of a relatively
small number of high value bulls as semen donors in
assisted reproduction practices.
Two Creole breeds, CAR and MON showed the lowest
inbreeding coefficients among all ten breeds. These two
breeds have been the subject of concerted efforts to conserve them. MON breed was recovered from a very small
number of animals by directed matings coupled to
embryo transfer procedures [7]. Furthermore CAR is phenotypically very similar to MON, the only difference
being the presence of horns in CAR. The horn removal
from CAR animals and matings with MON has led to
absorbing crossbreeding of the MON breed by CAR. As

Clustering assignment of the ten Brazilian bovine breeds obtained by STRUCTURE analyses
Figure 3
Clustering assignment of the ten Brazilian bovine breeds obtained by STRUCTURE analyses. Each of the 915 animals is represented by a thin vertical line that is divided into segments whose size and color correspond to the relative proportion of the
animal genome corresponding to a particular cluster. Breeds are separated by thin black lines. Panels with K = 2 inferred clusters, taurine (red) and zebuine (green) breeds are discriminated; with K = 3, taurine Creole breeds of Iberian origin (blue) are
further separated from the specialized taurine breeds (red) and zebuine (green); with K = 10 inferred clusters corresponding
to the ten breeds, complex breed admixture patterns can be visualized.

the effective population size of MON is still very small, the
understanding is that this irreversible breed absorption,
although resulting in an uniformization of the two
breeds, should ultimately be positive from the practical
standpoint as potentially useful alleles will be then conserved in the larger populations of CAR. Such a position
has also been advocated as not necessarily undesirable
when it constitutes an integral part of the evolution of a
breed. Among the five Creole breeds the highest inbreeding was detected in CUR. This was expected as the number
of bulls available for this breed is very limited. Current
conservation actions for this breed have included the
exchange of bulls amongst the few properties that raise
these animals as well as expansion of germplasm sampling and cryoconservation [3].
Significant genetic differentiation was observed among all
ten breeds estimated both by FST = 0.098 and RST = 0.1861

(Table 2). Similar FST values have been estimated among
taurine and zebuine African breeds (FST = 0.06) [29];
0.112 among seven taurine European breeds [17]; 0.035
among taurine Belgian breeds [33]; 0.107 in a group of
northern European breeds [28]; around 0.07 among Iberian and French breeds [19,32] and 0.089 among local
taurine Portuguese [22]. In a study similar to ours, when
a group of Creole taurine and zebuine breeds from Argentina and Bolivia were analyzed differentiation was estimated at FST = 0.088 and RST = 0.144 [23]. The much
higher estimates of differentiation by the RST when compared to FST suggests that differences among breeds
involve not only allele frequencies but also allele size differences due to the mutational behavior of microsatellites.
The significance and values of the overall estimates of FST
among all ten breeds for the 22 microsatellites are useful
indicators of markers that could be powerful tools for

BMC Genetics 2007, 8:83

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/83

breed differentiation. Differentiation of breeds that
belong to different subspecies, taurine or indicine, is a relatively trivial task as several markers with a significant FST
could easily diagnose the most likely breed as well as the
proportions of zebuine and taurine genomes. Within each
subspecies however it would be more difficult. In taurine,
for example, out of the twenty markers significantly contributing to interbreed differences, markers INRA63,
INRA5, CSSM33, ETH10 and TGLA227, the top five
ranked by FST values, could be tested for this purpose. In
zebuine, only eight markers showed a significant FST, and
all of very low value, so that breed differentiation in this
subspecies could demand other kinds of markers such as
carefully selected and validated ancestrally informative
single nucleotide polymorphisms. Both FST and RST estimates within the taurine and zebuine groups taken separately showed a lower differentiation among the three
zebuine breeds when compared to the taurine group. The
possible explanation resides in the way that these two
groups were introduced and are currently managed in Brazil. No specific breed segregation was practiced at the time
and all animals coming from the Indies were generically
classified as Zebu [6]. Furthermore, the currently existing
tens of millions of zebuine animals have resulted in most
part from absorbing crossbreeding between indicine bulls
and local dams. Very rarely, if at all, are genetically pure
herds still available, directly descending from imported
animals on both sexes and totally immune to taurine gene
flow [34]. Finally only in 1938 the racial standards for
zebuine breeds were described and implemented. Until
then, all breeds were registered in a single Herd Book of
Zebu breed [35].

(Table 3). This is the only Creole breed that has a history
of artificial selection and the decline of this breed in the
60's and 70's could have also contributed to this reduction
of genetic variation.

Four of the five Creole breeds CRL, CUR, MON and PAN
displayed a higher allelic richness than all other breeds.
The same comparative pattern of genetic variation was
observed by Liron et al. [23]. The introduction of taurine
animals in the American continent was one of the last dispersal movements of bovines in the world. The founder
population of the local current Creole breeds was a small
groups of Iberian animals that faced a significant selective
pressure due to the tropical climate and biotic stresses and
an almost extinction due to the introduction of more productive breeds [7]. However an opposing evolutionary
force was the admixture with breeds from very diverse
geographical origins [3]. The dispersion of these populations to distinct regions following human migrations,
together with the very diverse environmental conditions
found in a continental country, very mild directional
selective pressure and recurrent breed hybridizations,
most likely have shaped the current status of genetic diversity of these breeds. Furthermore, in more recent years,
introgression from zebuine breeds has also occurred.
Only the CAR breed contrasted to this picture showing a
reduced observed heterozygosity and allelic richness

A comparison of autossomal microsatellite, mtDNA haplogroups and Y-chromosome microsatellite haplotypes
has shown that for Bolivian and Argentinean Creole
breeds significant male mediated zebuine introgression
has taken place [23,36]. The expected pattern for Brazil
would be an even larger zebuine ancestral genome proportion in the Creole taurine breeds as one moves north,
consistent with the introduction and use of zebuine animals for improved adaptation to tropical climates. Such a
trend was detected in our study for all Creole breeds analyzed, and particularly so for CRL and PAN that showed
the smallest interbreed genetic distances in relation to the
three zebuine breeds (Table 5), and from the STRUCTURE
analysis, best seen with k = 3 (Figure 3). Several animals
of CRL and PAN displayed a discernible amount of
zebuine genome and the proximity of these two breeds
with the zebuine group was clearly observed in the Neighbor-Net graph. Historical data gathered in the locations
where these animals were sampled, do report the presence
of Nellore males or their hybrids in the herds. In CUR and
MON zebuine introgression was less pronounced and
almost none for CAR animals consistent with the history

Genetic relationship among breeds and conservation
The partitioning of the genetic variation from an AMOVA
also revealed that the largest amount of variation was
always found among individuals within breeds, irrespective of the different structures tested (Table 4). Maximum
differentiation was found when comparing zebuine and
specialized taurine breeds. A very similar pattern of variance partitioning has been seen in several other studies of
bovine breeds [19,22,23] where 90% or more of the variation is contained within breeds. Liron et al. [23] however,
found only 1% of the variation to be due to differences
among Argentinean and Bolivian Creole breeds, smaller
that the 4% we found between the Brazilian Creole
breeds. Although no formal comparative test for significance can be done on these estimates, the nominally
higher value might result from two distinctiveness of the
Brazilian Creole breeds. First, Brazil was the only country
in South America that received Portuguese taurine breeds
[3] that have been shown to have both an European and
African evolutionary lineages represented by the Brown
Concave and Red Convex groups [22]. Second, as will be
shown later, some of these Brazilian local breeds have
experienced an increased introgression of zebuine genes.
It would be interesting to carry out an extensive joint analysis of the local breeds from several countries in South
America together with all Iberian breeds to reconstruct a
region-wide picture of the patterns of genetic variation

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genetics 2007, 8:83

of a more systematic and segregated breeding management of CAR as a taurine breed. Within the zebuine
branch, GYR and GUZ breeds are closer together and in
the single-animal dendrogram animals of these two
breeds are intermingled, consistent with the geographical
proximity of their center of origin in India. The STRUCTURE analysis was able to differentiate these two breeds,
however a number of animals showed mixed ancestries.
Ibeagha-Awemu et al. [29] when analyzing a larger set of
African zebuine breeds pointed out, in fact, that the
model-based clustering approach implemented by the
STRUCTURE program cannot effectively discriminate
individuals with very closely related genotypes or very low
levels of differentiation to their rightful breed without
prior population information.
Much controversy has been going and several approaches
have been proposed to assess conservation priorities on
the basis of molecular markers [19,37]. No attempt was
made in this study to define conservation precedence. All
Brazilian Creole breeds are important and viable targets
for conservation [3]. They are genetically unique and display peculiar traits that deserve conservation efforts. For
example, CUR animals are small, low weight, highly
adapted to the semi-arid regions of Brazil and able to survive in very harsh conditions with little food and water
while displaying marked resistance to several parasites
and high fecundity.

Conclusion
This study reports on a comprehensive study of the genetic
structure and diversity of bovine cattle breeds in Brazil.
The genetic analysis showed that a significant amount of
genetic variation is maintained in the local cattle populations and all breeds studied could be considered as distinct genetic entities. Four of the five Creole Brazilian
breeds displayed a markedly higher allelic richness than
all other breeds most likely as a result of a combination of
natural selection in diverse environmental conditions,
mild artificial selective pressure and recurrent breed
hybridizations including introgression from zebuine
breeds. The genetic data corroborate historical records in
that they indicate that variable patterns of breed admixture have occurred since colonial times shaping the current genetic status of the local breeds. Brazilian Creole
breeds constitute an important and diverse reservoir of
genetic diversity for bovine breeding and viable targets for
conservation for they display peculiar traits both phenotypic and of cultural nature. As pointed out by several
authors, many other aspects besides the amount and distribution of genetic diversity have to be taken into account
when dealing with conservation strategies of livestock species. Historical, cultural and traditional aspects regarding
the use of particular breeds are relevant issues. Furthermore one should not forget the fact that directional selec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/83

tion practiced by man has shaped animal genomes in
unexpected ways favoring alleles or genes complexes for
which the surrogate neutral markers used in diversity surveys are not necessarily fully representative.

Methods
Animals
Ten Brazilian bovine breeds were analyzed, involving a
total of 915 animals. The breeds studied can be classified
into three groups: (a) Taurine Creole breeds (Caracu –
CAR; Criolo Lageano – CRL; Curraleiro – CUR; Mocho
Nacional – MON and Pantaneiro – PAN); (b) European
taurine breeds (Holstein – HOL and Jersey – JER) and (c)
Brazilian zebuine breeds (Nellore – NEL; Gyr – GYR and
Guzerat – GUZ) (Table 1). For the breeds where pedigree
information was available, unrelated individuals for at
least three generations were selected. Total genomic DNA
was extracted using a routine salting-out procedure [42].
This study followed the legal aspects and rules to which
Embrapa is committed and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Embrapa Genetic Resources and Biotechnology. Moreover, it followed the legal requirements
set by the Genetic Heritage Management Council – CGEN
of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment.
Microsatellite marker typing
Twenty-two microsatellites were amplified by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) in five different multiplex systems
where the forward primer of each microsatellite was
labeled either with 6-FAM, HEX or NED fluorochromes
according to the expected allele size range. Several of these
microsatellites have been commonly used by other groups
worldwide thus making possible future comparative analysis or consolidation of data sets. The multiplex systems
used were: a 7-plex composed by markers INRA35,
INRA37, HEL9, HEL5, INRA63, ILSTS5, ETH152 (annealing temperature Ta = 56°C); a 2-plex of markers CSSM9,
CSSM33 (Ta = 72°C – 60°C, touchdown program); a 2plex of markers HEL1, INRA05 (Ta = 56°C); a 5-plex of
markers BM2113, ETH10, SPS115, TGLA122, ETH225 (Ta
= 61°C) and a 5-plex of markers TGLA227, TGLA53,
INRA23, ETH3, BM1824 (Ta = 61°C). Microsatellite
CSSM66 was amplified alone (Ta = 61°C) and the PCR
product injected together with markers HEL1 and INRA5
before electrophoresis. Only markers CSSM9 [43] and
CSSM33 [44] were not included in those recommended
for cattle population diversity studies by the MoDAD program of FAO for Management of Farm Animal Genetic
Resources. References and primer sequences for the microsatellites used are available in the Cattle Diversity Database [25].

PCR amplified products were electroinjected on an ABI
PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and
data collected under virtual filter D using GeneScan 2.0

and Genotyper 2.1 (Applied Biosystems) to declare alleles. An internal size standard labeled with ROX [45] was
used for sizing alleles. Genotypes for eight ISAG recommended loci (BM2113, ETH10, SPS115, TGLA122,
ETH225 TGLA227, INRA23, BM1824) were calibrated
using reference samples genotyped in the 2005–2006
ISAG comparison test (D. Grattapaglia pers. comm.). The
AlleloBin software was used to classify observed microsatellite allele sizes into representative discrete alleles using
the least-square minimization algorithm of Idury and
Cardon [46].
Data analyses
Allele frequencies were estimated by direct counting.
Parameters of locus diversity were estimated for all microsatellite markers in all breeds using the Cervus software
[47], including: observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected
heterozygosity (He) and polymorphic information content (PIC) Wright's F-statistics for each locus were calculated using Weir and Cockerman's method [48] using
FSTAT [49]. A significance test on the estimates of Wright's
F-statistics (FIT, FIS and FST) for each microsatellite locus
were obtained by constructing 95% and 99% confidence
intervals based on the standard deviations estimated by
jackknifing across populations using FSTAT.

An exact test was used to determine deviations from
Hardy-Weinberg proportions and heterozygosity deficiency using the GENEPOP software package [50]. The
Markov Chain method [51] was used to estimate unbiased exact P-values. Estimates of genetic variability for
each breed (He, Ho with their associated standard error)
were calculated using the Excel Microsatellite Toolkit [52].
FSTAT software was used to calculate the allelic richness
(AR) standardized for variation in sample size. Breed differentiation was estimated by Wright's F-statistics (FIT, FIS
and FST) and the indicative P-value was adjusted by a Bonferroni procedure using the same software package [49].
Using breed information different groupings were formed
based on their origin (taurine × zebuine) and prior information (Creole × specialized breed). With these definitions, a hierarchical analysis of variance was carried out
using an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
approach implemented in the ARLEQUIN package [53].
Genetic distances between breeds was estimated by DA
[54] using DISPAN [55]. The traditional Reynold's distance (FST) was calculated using FSTAT. The log-likelihood
G-statistics [56] was used to estimate P-values and the
pairwise significance was established after a standard Bonferroni correction [49]. RST [57] was also estimated using
the Microsat program. The product moment correlation
(r) and Mantel test statistic were computed for pairwise
comparisons of distance matrices. A UPGMA
(Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/83

tree and a neighbor-joining tree were constructed based
on DA distances using the Dispan package. Bootstrap values were computed over 1,000 replicates. Additionally a
Neighbor-Net graph [58] based on DA distances was constructed with SplitsTree4 program [59].
The pairwise genetic distances between all individual animals were estimated by the logarithm of the proportions
of shared alleles (Dps) [60], using Microsat [61]. The clustering method [62] was used to construct a tree based on
the genetic distance matrix using the Phylip package [63]
and the result file was entered into TreeExplorer [64] in
order to find a suitable graphic display.
Based on genotypes at the 22 marker loci, individual animals were clustered into a given number of populations
and assigned probabilistically to clusters inferred with a
Bayesian approach implemented by the STRUCTURE software [65]. The tests were done based on an admixture
model where the allelic frequencies were correlated applying burn-in period of 50,000 and 500,000 iterations for
data collection. Two to fifteen inferred clusters were performed with three independent runs each. Results were
entered into the DISTRUCT program [66] to provide a
graphic display.
