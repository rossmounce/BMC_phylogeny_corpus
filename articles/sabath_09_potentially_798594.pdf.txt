Abstract
The Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) is a honeybee-infecting virus that was found to be associated
with colony collapse disorder. The IAPV genome contains two genes encoding a structural and a
nonstructural polyprotein. We applied a recently developed method for the estimation of selection
in overlapping genes to detect purifying selection and, hence, functionality. We provide
evolutionary evidence for the existence of a functional overlapping gene, which is translated in the
+1 reading frame of the structural polyprotein gene. Conserved orthologs of this putative gene,
which we provisionally call pog (predicted overlapping gene), were also found in the genomes of a
monophyletic clade of dicistroviruses that includes IAPV, acute bee paralysis virus, Kashmir bee
virus, and Solenopsis invicta (red imported fire ant) virus 1.

Background
Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is a syndrome characterized by the mass disappearance of honeybees from hives
[1]. CCD imperils a global resource estimated at approximately $200 billion [2]. For example, it has been estimated that up to 35% of hives in the US may have been
affected [3]. Many culprits have been suggested as causal
factors of CCD, among them fungal, bacterial, and protozoan diseases, external and internal parasites, in-hive
chemicals, agricultural insecticides, genetically modified
crops, climatic factors, changed cultural practices, and the
spread of cellular phones [1]. The Israeli acute paralysis
virus (IAPV), a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the
family Dicistroviridae, was found to be strongly correlated
with CCD [4]. It was first isolated in Israel [5], but was
later found to have a worldwide distribution [4,6,7].

ORF encodes a structural polyprotein; the 3' ORF encodes
a non-structural polyprotein [5]. The non-structural polyprotein contains several signature sequences for helicase,
protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [5]. The
structural polyprotein, which is located downstream of
the non-structural polyprotein, encodes two (and possibly more) capsid proteins.
Overlapping genes are easily missed by annotation programs [8], as evidenced by the fact that several overlapping genes were only detected by using the signatures of
purifying selection [9-13]. Here, we apply a recently developed method for the detection of selection in overlapping
reading frames [14] to the genome of IAPV and its relatives.

Results and Discussion
The genome of IAPV contains two long open reading
frames (ORFs) separated by an intergenic region. The 5'

In the fourteen completely sequenced dicistroviral
genomes (Table 1), we identified 43 same-strand overlap-

ping ORFs of lengths equal or greater than 60 codons on
the positive strand. Ten overlapping ORFs were found in
concordant genomic locations in two or more genomes.
The concordant overlapping ORFs were assigned to three
orthologous clusters (Table 2). The overlapping ORFs in
all three clusters are phase-1 overlaps, i.e., shifted by one
nucleotide relative to the reading-frames of the known
polyprotein genes. Two of the orthologous clusters overlap the gene encoding the nonstructural polyprotein and
one overlaps the reading frame of the structural polyprotein. (In appendix 1, we present the results concerning the
overlapping ORFs on the negative strand. We note, however, that dicistroviruses are not known to be ambisense
[15].)
We identified a strong signature of purifying selection in
cluster A that contains overlapping ORFs from four
genomes: IAPV, Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Kashmir
bee virus (KBV), and Solenopsis invicta virus 1 (SINV-1)

[16-18]. This ORF overlaps the 5' end of the structural
polyprotein gene (Figure 1A). The detection of purifying
selection is based on a method for the simultaneous estimation of selection intensities in overlapping genes [14].
To ascertain that each overlapping ORF is indeed subject
to selection, we used the likelihood ratio test for two hierarchical models. In model 1, we assume no selection on
the overlapping ORF. In model 2, the overlapping ORF is
assumed to be under selection. If model 2 fits the data significantly better than model 1 (p < 0.05), then the overlapping ORF is predicted to be under selection and is most
probably functional. The signature of selection was identified for the ORFs in the three bee viruses (IAPV, ABPV,
and KBV). The protein product of the orthologous ORF in
SINV-1 could not be tested for selection because the
amino acid sequence identity between the ORF from
SINV-1 and the ORFs from the three bee viruses (Table 3)
is lower than the range of sequence identities for which
the method can be applied (65-95%).
An additional indication for selection on these ORFs was
obtained by comparing the degrees of conservation of the
hypothetical protein sequences of the overlapping ORFs
against the protein sequences of the known genes (structural and nonstructural polyproteins, Table 3). The degree
of amino-acid conservation and, hence, sequence identity
between orthologous protein-coding genes is influenced
ceteris paribus by the intensity of purifying selection. If
both overlapping genes are under similar strengths of
selection, the amino-acid sequence identity of one pair of
homologous genes would be similar to that of the overlapping pair. On the other hand, if a functional gene overlaps a non-functional ORF, the amino-acid identity
between the hypothetical protein sequences of the nonfunctional ORFs would be much lower than that between
the two homologous overlapping functional genes. We
found that the degree of amino-acid conservation of the
overlapping sequence identity between pairs of overlapping ORFs in cluster A is only slightly lower than that of
the known gene (maximum of 12% difference between
IAPV and SINV-1 in cluster A, Table 3). In contrast, the
amino-acid sequence identity between ORF pairs in clusters B and C is much lower than that between the pairs of
known genes (maximum of 44% difference between CrPV
and DCV in cluster C, Table 3).
The signature of purifying selection on the ORFs in cluster
A suggests that they may encode functional proteins. We
provisionally term this gene pog (predicted overlapping
gene). In Figure 1, we show that pog is found in the
genomes of four viruses that constitute a monophyletic
clade, but not in any other dicistrovirid genome (Figure
1A). Its phylogenetic distribution suggests that pog originated before the divergence of SINV-1 from the three bee
viruses. The phylogenetic distributions of the ORFs in

clusters B and C (Figure 1B) are patchy. This patchiness is
an additional indication that the overlapping ORFs in
clusters B and C are spurious, i.e., non-functional.
An examination of the DNA alignment of pog (Figures 2)
reveals a conservation of the first potential start codon
(ATG or CTG) in the +1 reading frame in three out of the
four viral genomes (IAPV, ABPV, and SINV-1). As seen in
Figure 3, this conservation cannot be explained by constraints on the overlapping polyprotein, in which the corresponding site is variable and encodes different amino
acids (His, Asn, and Pro, in IAPV, ABPV, and SINV-1,
respectively). We note, however, that we did not find a
conserved Kozak consensus sequence [19] upstream of
the potential initiation site. This situation is similar to that
described in [13].
A protein motif search resulted in several matches, all with
a weak score. Two patterns were found in all four proteins:
(1) a signature of rhodopsin-like GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors), and (2) a protein kinase C phosphorylation site (Figure 3). Prediction of the secondary structures
[20] suggests that the proteins contain two conserved
helix domains, separated by 3-5 residues (except for SINV1, in which one long domain is predicted), at the C-terminus (Figure 3). A search for transmembrane topology [21]
indicates that the longer helix may be a transmembranal
segment (Figure 3). Although viruses often use GPCRs to
exploit the host immune system through molecular mimicry [22-25], the lengths of the proteins encoded by pog are
shorter than the average virus-encoded GPCR. Therefore,
these proteins may have a different function.

Conclusion
In this note, we provide evolutionary evidence (purifying
selection) for the existence of a functional overlapping

gene, pog, in the genomes of IAPV, ABPV, KBV, and SINV1. To our knowledge, this putative gene, whose coding
region overlaps the structural polyprotein, has not been
described in the literature before.

Methods
Sequence Data, Processing, and Analysis
Fourteen completely sequenced dicistrovirid genomes
were obtained from NCBI (Table 1). Each genome was
scanned for the presence of overlapping ORFs. We used
BLASTP [26] with the protein sequences of the known
genes to identify matches of orthologous overlapping
ORFs (E value < 10-6). Matching overlapping ORFs were
assigned into clusters. Within each cluster, we aligned the
amino-acid orthologs by using the sequences of the
known genes as references. If alignment length of the
overlapping sequence exceeded 60 amino-acids, and if the
amino-acid sequence identity among the hypothetical
genes within a cluster was higher than 65%, we tested for
selection on the hypothetical gene (see below).

We aligned the protein sequences of the two polyproteins
with CLUSTAW [27] as implemented in the MEGA package [28]. Alignment quality was confirmed using HoT
[29]. We reconstructed two phylogenetic trees (one for
each polyprotein) by applying the neighbor joining
method [30], as implemented in the MEGA package [28].
Trees were rooted by the mid-point rooting method [31]
and confidence of each branch was estimated by bootstrap with 1000 replications.
Detection of Selection in Overlapping Genes
We used the method of Sabath et al. [14] for the simultaneous estimation of selection intensities in overlapping
genes. This method uses a maximum-likelihood framework to fit a Markov model of codon substitution to data

from two aligned homologous overlapping sequences. To
predict functionality of an ORF that overlaps a known
gene, we modified an existing approach for predicting
functionality in non-overlapping genes [32]. Given two
aligned orthologous overlapping sequences, we estimate
the likelihood of two hierarchical models. In model 1,
there is no selection on the ORF. In model 2, the ORF is
assumed to be under selection. The likelihood-ratio test is
used to test whether model 2 fits the data significantly better than model 1, in which case, the ORF is predicted to be
under selection and most probably functional.

tional. We therefore conclude that dicistroviruses most
probably do not encode proteins on the negative strand.

Motifs
We looked for motifs within the inferred protein
sequences encoded by the overlapping ORF by using the
motif search server http://motif.genome.jp/ and the MyHits server http://hits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN with the
following motif databases: PRINTS [33], PROSITE [34],
and Pfam [35]. We used PSIPRED [20] to predict secondary structure, and MEMSAT [21] to predict transmembrane protein topology.

Appendix 1
Overlapping ORFs on the negative strand
In the fourteen completely sequenced dicistroviruse
genomes (Table 1), we identified 240 overlapping ORFs
of length equal or greater than 60 codons on the negative
strand. Of the 240 ORFs, 113 were found in concordant
genomic locations in two or more genomes. The concordant overlapping ORFs were assigned into 29 clusters
(Additional file 1). There are 9, 1, and 19 clusters in phase
0, 1, and 2, respectively. The cluster size ranges from 2 to
9. In two clusters, 5 and 10, both in phase 2, there is a
weak signature of selection. However, this signature seems
to be a false positive, which was driven by the unique
structure of opposite-strand phase-2 overlap (Additional
file 2). In this structure, codon positions one and two of
one gene match codon positions two and one of the overlapping gene. This structure leads to a situation where
most changes are either synonymous or nonsynonymous
in both overlapping genes and occasionally, to false signal
of purifying selection on the overlapping ORF. In addition, one of the clusters (cluster 10) does not constitute a
monophyletic clade, and is, therefore, unlikely to be func-
