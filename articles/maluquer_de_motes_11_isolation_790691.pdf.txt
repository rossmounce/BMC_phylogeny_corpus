Abstract
Adenoviruses of primates include human (HAdV) and simian (SAdV) isolates classified into 8 species (Human
Adenovirus A to G, and Simian Adenovirus A). In this study, a novel adenovirus was isolated from a colony of
cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and subcultured in VERO cells. Its complete genome was purified and
a region encompassing the hexon gene, the protease gene, the DNA binding protein (DBP) and the 100 kDa
protein was amplified by PCR and sequenced by primer walking. Sequence analysis of these four genes showed
that the new isolate had 80% identity to other primate adenoviruses and lacked recombination events. The study
of the evolutionary relationships of this new monkey AdV based on the combined sequences of the four genes
supported a close relationship to SAdV-3 and SAdV-6, lineages isolated from Rhesus monkeys. The clade formed by
these three types is separated from the remaining clades and establishes a novel branch that is related to species
HAdV-A, F and G. However, the genetic distance corresponding to the newly isolated monkey AdV considerably
differs from these as to belong to a new, not yet established species. Results presented here widen our knowledge
on SAdV and represents an important contribution to the understanding of the evolutionary history of primate
adenoviruses.
Findings
Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, icosahedral, doublestranded DNA viruses known to cause gastroenteritis,
keratoconjunctivitis, and acute respiratory disorders [1].
Adenoviruses infecting primates belong to the genus
Mastadenovirus. To date, at least 52 distinct human
adenovirus (HAdV) types have been described. Phylogenetically, HAdVs cluster into 6 species (named
Human Adenovirus A to F, HAdV-A to F), although
recently a new species (HAdV-G) has been described to
include the types HAdV-52 and SAdV-1 [2]. Moreover,
at least 25 simian adenovirus (SAdV) types have been
recognized: 20 types (SAdV-1 to 20) were isolated from
Old World monkeys and are more related to species
HAdV-A and F [3,4], whereas 5 types (SAdV-21 to 25)
were isolated from chimpanzees and are closely related
to HAdV-4 (HAdV-E) and to HAdV-B [5-7]. Recently,
new isolates from chimpanzee, bonobo, orangutan,

gorillas, and macaques have been described and characterized, largely expanding the SAdV taxonomy [8,9].
HAdVs have traditionally been classified according to
their immunochemical and biological properties. Nowadays, however, microbiologists favour to classify HAdVs
based on their evolutionary relationships as inferred in
phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of viral protein
genes. This approach allows for a classification based on
the evolutionary history of the viruses, besides avoiding
misleading classification due to cross-reaction in neutralization and hemagglutination tests. In addition to the g
determinant of the fiber protein, the main type-specific
epitope in adenovirus is the ε determinant present on
the hexon capsid protein. DNA amplification and
sequencing of these informative regions in the adenoviral genome have been used to provide molecular data
for typing strains and identification of new prototypic
isolates [10,11]. Moreover, the hexon and the protease
genes have been characterized in most adenovirus types
providing a large amount of data for taxonomic classification of new isolates.

In this study we describe the isolation and identification of an adenoviral type strain from cages inhabited by
a colony of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis).
Viral concentrates were obtained from a mix of excreta
and waste collected from bedding areas of a colony of
M. fascicularis showing no signs of gastroenteritis or
pathogenic disorders. Viruses were eluted and concentrated from the samples as described previously [12].
African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero)
were infected blind with the viral concentrates and cytopathic effect was rapidly observed. Supernatant from
infected Vero cells was prepared for analysis by transmission electron microscopy using copper grids coated
with formvar film and carbon that were negatively
stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0. Analysis
of the grids using a JEOL JEM-1010 identified adenoviral particles characterized by typical 70 nm icosahedral-shaped capsids (Figure 1). The virus (hereafter
referred to as CynAdV) was purified by infection of
end-point limiting dilutions in Vero cells for 3 passages.
A purified stock was generated and the virus titer was
determined as 10 7.5 TCID50 ml -1 by calculation using
the Reed-Muench cumulative method.
The entire viral DNA genome was purified as
described by Kovács et al. [13]. A random library of
DNA fragments was prepared and some clones were
sequenced. To address the identification of the new isolate, a genome fragment encompassing traditionally studied viral genes like the hexon and the protease gene
was targeted for amplification and sequencing. Two
fragments of approximately 3,500 bp covering the whole
coding sequence for the hexon, protease, DBP genes,
and part of the 100 kDa gene were then amplified with
FideliTaq (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The fragments were purified with
the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAgen) and

sequenced with the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems)
using primer walking. The sequence was deposited in
the GenBank with accession number EU293065.
The CynAdV genome contained a 2,775 bp-long
hexon gene, a 615 bp-long protease gene, and a 1,320
bp-long DBP gene. The overall base composition of the
7,481 bp sequence was 21.43% A, 21.61% T, 26.55% G,
and 30.41% C. The GC content was 56.96%, similar to
those reported for the complete genome of HAdV-52
(55.1%) and SAdV-1 (55%). Interestingly, no intergenic
region was observed between the hexon and protease
genes, suggesting that the CynAdV genome size might
be smaller than other SAdVs. When the predicted
amino acid sequences were used as queries in BLASTp
searches, CynAdV showed an overall amino acid identity
of 75-88% for the hexon protein, a structural protein
with long conserved domains (Table 1). Amino acid
identity was reduced in the non-structural proteins, protease and DBP. The CynAdV protease consisted of a
protein of 205 residues and showed 75-80% amino acid
identity to most human and simian adenovirus protease
sequences, whereas the DBP consisted of 493 residues
and showed 46-59% amino acid identity to most adenoviral DBP sequences (Table 1).
Recombination among adenovirus serotypes generates
new strains (intermediate types) that are difficult to classify. Due to selective pressure of neutralizing antibodies
and viral escape, recombination events involving the
hexon are common, as has recently been described
[14,15]. The hexon protein in HAdVs can be divided
into 4 conserved (C1-4) and 3 variable regions (V1-3)
[16]. It contains the type-specific neutralization epitope
(ε determinant) which consists of 6 hypervariable
regions located in L1 and an extra one located in L2
[17]. High identity of these variable regions with other
HAdVs lineages could indicate recombination in this
particular gene. To assess whether recombination
occurred in the newly isolated monkey AdV hexon
gene, we performed bootscan analysis of the prototypic
hexon sequences available using SimPlot software [18].
Hexon gene sequences were aligned using ClustalW and
the CynAdV sequence was analyzed against those of
HAdV and SAdV types grouped according to species.
Grouping reduces effects of variation in individual
sequences. However, considering the similarity between
CynAdV and SAdV-7 and members of the species
HAdV-G, these sequences were left ungrouped. The
results of the bootscan analysis failed to identify recombination events (Figure 2).
In order to classify the new isolate, the evolutionary
relationships of CynAdV were assessed in a phylogenetic
analysis including all publicly available genomes of
HAdVs and SAdVs. Sequences were aligned with

MAFFT [19] using standard gap parameters and 100
refinement iterations. The alignment was then trimmed
to match the coding regions of the genes sequenced for
CynAdV: hexon, protease, DBP, and 100 kDa genes.
Tree searches were performed on each gene individually
and on the combined dataset (coding sequences of all 4
genes concatenated) using maximum likelihood methods
as implemented in the program RAxML 7.0.4 [20]. For
all matrices, the evolutionary model used was the
GTRGAMMA and 20 search replicates were performed.
In the analysis of the combined dataset, model parameters were obtained for each gene separately (partition
wise). Statistical significance of clades was obtained with
100 bootstrap searches. A second analysis of the combined dataset was done after removing highly variable
regions including many gaps that could cause low accuracy in the alignment.
The resulting trees (combined dataset in Figure 3, individual gene trees in Figure 4) recovered all adenovirus

species groups as in Roy et al. [8]. The combined dataset
tree had high support for all previously described HAdVs
species and for most relationships among groups. In this
tree, CynAdV clustered the closest with a clade including
species SAdV-3 and SAdV-6 with moderately high bootstrap support (88%). The support for this relationship
increased (94%) when highly variable regions were
removed (Figure 3). Individual gene trees (Figure 4) disagreed on the relationships among species HAdV-A, F,
G, the clade formed by types SAdV-3 and SAdV-6, and
CynAdV. The conflicting relationships, however, did not
receive high bootstrap support in any of the gene trees.
The only exception was the DBP gene tree that agreed
and showed high statistical support for the relationships
of CynAdV depicted in the combined dataset tree. To
check whether high levels of variation in DBP (as illustrated by low sequence identity across species, Table 1)
could be biasing the combined analysis [21], we reanalyzed this gene using this time its amino acid sequence.

Figure 2 Recombination analysis in the hexon gene of the newly isolated monkey AdV: A) schematic representation of the adenoviral
hexon gene, B) bootscan analysis and C) Simplot of CynAdV against the hexon genes of described human and simian adenoviruses. The
following settings were used: 200-bp window size, 20-bp step size, 100 replicates, gap stripping, Kimura-2 parameter distance model, Neighbour
Joining tree model, and parental threshold 85.

The resulting tree is very similar to the one based on
nucleotides, suggesting that this gene is not highly
affected by sequence bias and that it is probably a
good marker to use in the classification of adenoviruses
(Figure 5).
Phylogenetic signal conflict among genes was assessed
with the incongruence-length difference (ILD) test [22]
as implemented in the software PAUP*. The IDL test

showed significant conflict among the phylogenetic signal of individual genes (p = 0.001). One explanation for
this conflict is nucleotide substitution saturation, which
may blur phylogenetic signal in individual genes [23].
This explanation is supported by the increase in bootstrap percentages when highly variable regions were
removed from the combined dataset. An alternative
explanation is recombination between an ancestor of the

groups A, F, or G. The low bootstrap percentages
obtained for CynAdV in individual gene analyses (except
for DBP), however, precludes the formulation of a specific hypothesis for the recombination event. As shown
before, the test for recombination involving the hexon
gene was negative.
In a previous study [8], three different lineages of adenovirus isolated from cynomolgus macaques were identified. Interestingly, these three lineages were also
associated to SAdV-3 and SAdV-6 (isolated from Rhesus
monkeys) in trees based on the DBP gene. Nevertheless,
these relationships were not observed for two of the

newly described varieties (SAdV-49, and SAdV-50) in
trees obtained with other genes. In fact, their results
were very similar to ours in that the relationships of the
lineages classified as species A, F, and G were largely
discordant. Unfortunately, since the sequences of the
other cynomolgus macaque’s adenoviruses - SAdV-48,
SAdV-49, and SAdV-50 - were not publicly available,
they could not be included in the phylogenetic analyses
presented here.
In the past years, sequencing of the AdV hexon gene
has proved to be sufficient for typing new isolates
[11,16]. However, phylogenetic data inferred from hexon
gene analysis needs to be contrasted against other viral

genes since selective pressure on the hexon (and fiber
genes) may lead to recombination events and convergent evolution. In this study, analysis of a genomic
region encompassing 4 different genes including the
hexon gene distinguished the newly isolated monkey

AdV as an independent clade close to the types SAdV-6
and SAdV-3. The trees shown here suggest that SAdV-6
may belong to species SAdV-A together with SAdV-3.
However, CynAdV seems to adequately differ from
these to belong to a separate (not yet established)
