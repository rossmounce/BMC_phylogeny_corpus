Abstract
Background: DNA viruses have a wide range of genome sizes (5 kb up to 1.2 Mb, compared to
0.16 Mb to 1.5 Mb for obligate parasitic bacteria) that do not correlate with their virulence or the
taxonomic distribution of their hosts. The reasons for such large variation are unclear. According
to the traditional view of viruses as gifted "gene pickpockets", large viral genome sizes could
originate from numerous gene acquisitions from their hosts. We investigated this hypothesis by
studying 67 large DNA viruses with genome sizes larger than 150 kb, including the recently
characterized giant mimivirus. Given that horizontally transferred DNA often have anomalous
nucleotide compositions differing from the rest of the genome, we conducted a detailed analysis of
the inter- and intra-genome compositional properties of these viruses. We then interpreted their
compositional heterogeneity in terms of possible causes, including strand asymmetry, gene
function/expression, and horizontal transfer.
Results: We first show that the global nucleotide composition and nucleotide word usage of viral
genomes are species-specific and distinct from those of their hosts. Next, we identified
compositionally anomalous (cA) genes in viral genomes, using a method based on Bayesian
inference. The proportion of cA genes is highly variable across viruses and does not exhibit a
significant correlation with genome size. The vast majority of the cA genes were of unknown
function, lacking homologs in the databases. For genes with known homologs, we found a
substantial enrichment of cA genes in specific functional classes for some of the viruses. No
significant association was found between cA genes and compositional strand asymmetry. A
possible exogenous origin for a small fraction of the cA genes could be confirmed by phylogenetic
reconstruction.
Conclusion: At odds with the traditional dogma, our results argue against frequent genetic
transfers to large DNA viruses from their modern hosts. The large genome sizes of these viruses
are not simply explained by an increased propensity to acquire foreign genes. This study also
confirms that the anomalous nucleotide compositions of the cA genes is sometimes linked to
particular biological functions or expression patterns, possibly leading to an overestimation of
recent horizontal gene transfers.

Background
During the last decade the study of virus evolution has
been neglected to the point where 'virus evolution' most
often refers to studies more akin to population genetics,
such as the worldwide scrutiny of new polymorphisms
appearing daily in the H5N1 avian flu virus [1], than to
the fundamental question of where viruses come from [24]. Phylogenetic studies on viruses have long been considered unfeasible for two main reasons: 1) their reputed
propensity to randomly acquire genetic material from
their host or the environment and 2) their reputed very
high sequence divergence rate. The generality of this
vision, probably inherited from the study of RNA viruses
(in particular retroviruses), now deserves to be revisited
for DNA viruses in light of the increasing amount of available genomic sequence data, and the recent characterization of some giant viruses [5-8].
When analyzing DNA virus genome sequences on a global
scale [9] one is immediately struck by their tremendous
variation in size. Even if viral DNA genomes are expected
to be larger than viral RNA genomes due to the improved
accuracy of the replication system, it is not as easy to
understand how DNA viruses with apparently similar "fitness" (as judged from their virulence and burst sizes) may
have come to exhibit sizes ranging from a few kilobases up
to more than a megabase [5,6].
Even more intriguing is the fact that such a genome size
variation is commonly found among viruses infecting the
same or similar hosts, for prokaryotic viruses (e.g. bacteriophage ranging from 30 kb up to nearly 670 kb for bacteriophage G [10]), as well as animal viruses [from less than
5 kb (polyomaviruses) to 360 kb (poxviruses)]. Currently
the largest known eukaryotic DNA viruses are plankton
parasite Emiliania huxleyi virus 86 (407 kb) [7] and the
amoeba-infecting mimivirus (1.2 Mb) [5].
Finally, unlike the situation for eukaryotic cellular organisms, the increase in viral genome size is not correlated
with either accumulation of "junk" DNA (e.g. low complexity sequences or non-coding regions), invasion of
mobile elements, gene duplication or repeat expansion
[5,7,11].
In the present work, we now examine to which extent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from host might account for
the exceptional genome size of several families of large
double stranded DNA viruses (LDVs) with genomes
exceeding 150 kb in size.
These viruses are found in a wide variety of viral families
including those classified in Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large
DNA viruses [12] (Asfarviridae, Poxviridae, Phycodnaviridae,
Iridoviridae, Mimiviridae) as well as herpesviruses, nimavi-

ruses, baculoviruses, and bacteriophages. At the time of
this study, 67 LDV genomes (>150 kb) were available in
public databases (Table 1). Each of these genomes
encodes hundreds of predicted protein-coding genes.
With this increasing body of data, it has now become possible to analyze different structural and functional aspects
of those LDV genomes. Note that polydnaviruses were not
analyzed due to their anomalous low gene density, atypical chromosomal organization and life style [13].
Nucleotide composition is one of the specific properties
of viral and cellular genomes [14-16]. The mimivirus
genome is A+T rich (72%), and exhibits rather homogenous nucleotide compositions along the chromosome
[5]. In contrast, some betaherpesviruses exhibit a clear
bimodal heterogeneity in G+C composition along their
genomes [17]. Different factors can shape compositional
heterogeneity within and across genomes [18], including
mutational biases, physical constraints on DNA molecules, functional requirements at the level of transcription
[19] and translation [20-22], and genetic exchanges with
other genomes by horizontal transfer [23-26]. Many of
the initial surveys of LDV genomes characterized nucleotide compositional properties of individual genomes.
However, there are few studies systematically addressing
their compositional properties in a comparative way [27].
Here we analyzed the nucleotide compositional properties of 67 LDV genomes. We first compared global nucleotide compositions across these viruses and their hosts. We
next identified compositionally anomalous (cA) genes in
the viral genomes, examined their correlation with strand
asymmetry, a possible cause of compositional biases, and
described their functional and physical (i.e. chromosomal
co-localization) properties. Finally, we investigated
potential exogenous origins of the cA genes through phylogenetic tree reconstruction.

Results
Global compositional bias differs across LDVs and their
hosts
G+C content is a simple measure of genomic nucleotide
composition, and it has been shown to be species-specific
for prokaryotes [15]. LDVs also present a large variation in
global G+C content across viral families (27%–76%;
Additional file 1). Large variations in G+C content are also
observed within a viral family or subfamily (Additional
file 2), for instance, the lumpy skin disease virus (26%)
and the molluscum contagiosum virus (64%) belonging
to the same chordopoxvirus subfamily. Large variations in
G+C content were previously noted for herpesviruses [28].

Nucleotide word frequency is a finer indicator of genomic
specificity [29]. We computed the frequencies of tetranucleotide words in the LDV genomes (i.e. genomic signa-

tures [30]) and genomic signature distances for all possible pairs of the 67 LDVs (see Methods). The genomic
signature distance was strongly correlated with the difference in G+C content (R2 = 0.92) as a consequence of the
important role of G+C content in shaping nucleotide
word frequencies (Fig. 1). However, we observed a large
variation in the genomic signature distance for similar differences in G+C contents. This variation suggests the existence of higher order compositional biases that are
independent of G+C content. We shuffled every LDV
genome sequence to erase tetra-nucleotide word biases
that were independent of base compositions, and re-computed the genomic signature distances for all the pairs of
the 67 randomized sequences. We observed a significant
deviation in the genomic signature distances between the
real and the randomized data (t-test, p < 0.001; Fig. 1).
Thus LDVs maintain species-specific global compositional biases at both single and tetra-nucleotide levels, as
previously observed for cellular organisms [30] and for a
few viral families [28]. In other words, these LDVs have a
certain level of homogeneity in nucleotide composition
within their genomes, as Mrázek and Karlin previously
suggested for eighteen large DNA viruses [27].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/456

Viruses replicate intracellularly in their hosts, using the
host nucleotide pool. One may expect that the global
nucleotide compositional biases in viral genomes are similar to those of their hosts [31,32]. Host genomes are also
potential sources of genes for viruses, as viral genomes are
known to incorporate host genes. Thus the comparison of
the nucleotide compositional properties between LDVs
and their hosts is of particular interest. We compared
nucleotide compositional biases between the LDVs and
their hosts (i.e. modern hosts or their close relatives). We
observed a clear lack of correlation between the G+C content of the coding regions, (G+C)CDS, of the LDV
genomes, and the (G+C)CDS of the cellular host genomic
sequences (Fig. 2). A genomic signature analysis also
revealed distinct tetra-nucleotide word preferences
between LDVs and their hosts independent of their base
composition differences (Fig. 3). After a base-by-base random shuffling of the analyzed sequences, we observed a
significant deviation between the real and the randomized data in the genomic signature distances for the
LDV-host pairs (t-test, p < 0.001; Fig. 3). Thus the speciesspecific global compositional biases of LDVs are distinct
from that of their hosts. This invalidates the concept that

viruses tend to adapt their global DNA signatures to the
host machinery. Furthermore, HGTs from their modern
hosts are not as frequent, if any, as they could have influences on global nucleotide compositions of LDV
genomes.
Compositionally anomalous genes in LDVs
We next analyzed compositional heterogeneities across
different genes encoded in individual LDV genomes.
Genes with nucleotide compositions substantially deviating from the average in a genome tend to be under distinct
selection pressures or have particular evolutionary histories. We denote such genes as compositionally anomalous
(cA) genes. To identify cA genes with a robust statistical
support, we used a method [26] based on Markov modeling and Bayesian inference originally developed for the
identification of horizontally transferred genes within
prokaryotic genomes. Composition-based approaches
have a clear limitation in detecting HGTs; they detect only
a subset of HGTs (i.e. recent horizontal gene acquisitions
by a recipient genome from a donor genome with nucleotide compositions that are different from the recipient

genome). Our aim here is to examine the nature of cA
genes in LDVs in the light of previous observations of cA
genes for prokaryotic genomes.
We identified cA genes in all the analyzed LDV genomes.
In many LDV genomes, the cA genes were more A+T rich
than the remaining genes (for 43 out of 67 LDVs; binomial test, p < 0.05). The proportion of cA genes per
genome was highly variable across the 67 LDVs, ranging
from 1% to 53% (Table 1, Fig. 4). In contrast, the proportion obtained by the same method is less variable for
prokaryotes (0% to 25%) [9]. Herpesviruses exhibited the
widest range of cA gene proportion (6% to 53%). All but
two of the analyzed NCLDVs, including mimivirus, had a
relatively low level of cA proportion (1%–17%). Two
exceptions were Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1
(28%) and molluscum contagiosum virus (31%). Phages
showed a relatively low proportion (4% to 21%). The cA
gene proportions for other viruses were 5% to 26% for
four baculoviruses, 39% for nimavirus and 24% for Heliothis zea virus 1. The very high cA proportions in some
betaherpesviruses appear to be linked with genomic

islands harboring betaherpesvirus-specific genes, which
we will discuss below (in the "Co-localization of cA
genes" section).
Nakamura et al. reported a significant positive correlation
between the cA gene proportion and the total number of
genes in a genome for prokaryotes [26]; larger prokaryotic
genomes tend to more rapidly acquire foreign genes (of
"anomalous nucleotide compositions") than smaller
ones. In contrast, we found no such correlation for the 67
LDVs (R2 = 0.03) (Additional file 3).
We observed a weak but significant positive correlation
(R2 = 0.53, p < 0.005) between the proportion of cA genes
and genomic G+C content (Additional file 4). This correlation was not due to a bias induced by a given viral family
or subfamily. For example, when we excluded herpesviruses, many of which exhibit both a high cA gene proportion and a high G+C content, the correlation was reduced
but still remained significant (R2 = 0.24, p ≤ 0.005). Such
a significant correlation was observed also within a single
subfamily (i.e. alphaherpesviruses, R2 = 0.66, p ≤ 0.005).
A potential variation in gene prediction quality (which

could be dependent on genomic G+C compositions) does
not appear to explain these correlations (Monier et al.,
unpublished data). We also examined a possible relationship between the cA gene proportion and chromosome
topology. There was no difference in the cA gene proportions between linear LDV genomes (15.5% on average)
and circular LDV genomes (17.3% on average; t-test, p =
0.63).
Our global genomic signature analysis revealed remarkably different nucleotide compositions between LDVs and
their hosts. To investigate further the discrepancy of
nucleotide compositions, we examined if the identified cA
genes are enriched in "host-like" sequences in terms of
their nucleotide compositions. We determined the
genomic signature distances (di-nucleotides for word
length) from individual cA genes to the viral genome
where they originate as well as to the host genomic
sequences. As shown in the Additional file 5, we observed
a marked enrichment of genes with host-like signatures
among the identified cA genes (19%) relative to non-cA
genes (3.3%). The host-like signatures in these cA genes
could be due to a large variation in their nucleotide com-

positions, being unrelated to possible host origins for
some of the cA genes. To test this hypothesis, we performed the same analysis by randomizing the pairings
between viruses and their hosts. A comparable fraction
(23% versus 19%) of the cA genes indeed exhibited
smaller distances to the genomic signatures of randomly
chosen hosts than to the viral genomes where they originate. Thus the enrichment of genes with host-like signatures in cA genes may not suggest their horizontal
acquisitions from hosts.
Correlation between cA genes and replication-associated strand
asymmetry
Genome sequences of many prokaryotes and vertebrates
[33,34] show strong strand asymmetry in nucleotide composition between the leading and the lagging strands. For
most bacteria, compositional strand asymmetry is characterized by an excess of G and T bases in the leading strands
relative to the lagging strands [33,35,36]. A substantial
part of compositional strand asymmetry is independent
of gene distribution in the two distinct DNA strands, and
is probably due to mutational biases linked to asymmetric
mechanisms of DNA replication [37,38]. Compositional

strand asymmetry spanning large genomic segments has
been described also for some large DNA viruses, including
mimivirus [5,39] and several herpesviruses [40,41]. Such
replication-associated strand bias can potentially result in
two classes of genes with distinct nucleotide compositions, depending on which strand they are located. We
thus examined if there is a correlation between the distribution of cA genes and compositional strand asymmetry.
We first generated cumulative GT-excess plots [42] for all
of the 67 LDV genomes to assess their compositional
strand asymmetry. LDVs presented various GT-excess patterns. Several LDVs, mostly phages, showed strong global
strand asymmetry with a monotonous increase (or
decrease) of the cumulative GT-excess curve along their
entire genome. Some LDVs including mimivirus exhibited
a few peaks in their GT-excess profiles. For other LDVs, the
GT-excess curves locally fluctuated with no long genomic
segments exhibiting a consistent compositional asymmetry. We selected fifteen LDVs presenting long (>10 kb)
genomic segments with uniform compositional asymmetry (Additional file 6). After identifying the genomic coordinates where the sign of the nucleotide-skew (G+T versus

C+A) changes, we split the genomic sequences into substrands. Those sub-strands were classified into two classes:
class I consists of sub-strands having a positive nucleotide-skew (i.e. G+T% > C+A%), and class II with a negative
skew (i.e. G+T% < C+A%). Genes were then classified into
either class I or II according to the sub-strand they originated from. For instance, the plus strand (according to the
GenBank entry) of the Pseudomonas phage phiKZ genome
is G and T rich along its entire length, thus being classified
as class I. This class I strand contains 229 genes (≥ 300 nt),
of which 22 were detected as cA genes. The complementary strand is classified as a class II and contains 49 genes,
of which 5 were cA genes. No significant correlation was
found between the distribution of cA genes and the compositional strand asymmetry (Fisher's exact test, p-value =
0.99). The mimivirus genome shows a clear switch of
nucleotide-skew (G+T versus C+A) at position 380,000 nt
as previously noted [5]. Thus a part of the plus strand
(from 0 to 380,000 nt) and a part of the complementary
strand (from 380,000 to 1,118,404 nt) constitute the class
I strands. Class II is represented by the remaining strands
(Additional file 6). Again, no significant correlation was
found between the distribution of cA genes and the compositional strand asymmetry (p-value = 0.63). Of the fifteen LDVs that we analyzed, only three showed a
significant correlation between cA gene distribution and
strand asymmetries (p-values < 0.05). The three viruses are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/456

the fowlpox virus and two strains of the human herpesvirus 5 (the wild type strain merlin and the laboratory strain
AD169). These results suggest that replication-associated
compositional strand asymmetry accounts for only a
small part of the nucleotide compositional biases of the
cA genes observed in LDVs.
Co-localization of cA genes
In prokaryotes, horizontally transferred genes are often
clustered in the chromosome and make genomic islands
[26,43,44]. We investigated co-localization of the cA
genes along the chromosomes of the LDVs using a MonteCarlo simulation (see Methods). None of the genomes of
entomopoxviruses, baculoviruses, iridoviruses, mimivirus, nimavirus or phycodnaviruses exhibited a significant
propensity for cA genes to be clustered along the genome.
Of the 67 LDVs, only 12 presented a significant frequency
of pairs of co-localized cA genes (p ≤ 0.01; Table 1). Using
the same Monte-Carlo simulation, we identified significantly large sized cA gene islands (ranging from 3 up to 32
neighboring cA genes) in 11 LDV genomes (p ≤ 0.01;
Additional file 7). Those were 6 betaherpesviruses, 1
alphaherpesvirus, 2 chordopoxviruses, African swine fever
virus, and the cyanophage P-SSM4. Betaherpesviruses
showing cA islands of significant sizes include murid herpesvirus 2 with an extravagant 53% of cA gene proportion.

parallels the mosaicity in G+C composition along their
genomes [17]. It is known that betaherpesvirus genomes
are composed of core genes located in the middle of their
genomes and shared by different subfamilies of Herpesviridae, plus betaherpesvirus-specific genes located at the
extremities of the genomes [45]. As shown in Fig. 5, many
of the beta-family genes were identified as cA genes making genomic islands.
Correlation between cA genes and functional properties
Functional constraint on specific genomic regions can be
a cause of atypical nucleotide compositions of genes. We
selected five genomic regions to examine if there were correlations between cA genes and certain of their functional
attributes. For the first three cases (gamma- and betaherpseviruses), the correlation between the nucleotide compositional biases and gene functions has already been
described, and could serve as a positive control for our
method. For the last two cases (Emiliania huxleyi virus-86
and mimivirus), no such correlation has been previously
reported.

Human herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus) of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily has two different life cycle modes:
latent and productive. Nine genes are known to be
expressed during latency [46]. Those genes are hardly
expressed during the productive mode. They are highly
A+T rich compared to the remaining genes. Karlin et al.
hypothesized that the unique codon usage of those genes
helps to minimize the competition with host genes for
various host resources during latency [19]. We found that
eight of the nine latency genes were indeed detected as cA
genes (89%). In contrast, the cA gene proportion was significantly lower for the remaining genes (29/81, 36%, p =
0.003).
The immediate-early transcription region (≈10-kb) of the
murid herpesvirus 1 (murine cytomegalovirus, betaherpesvirus subfamily) genome is known to be CpG suppressed [47]. Experimental data suggest that the
methylation of the cytosines in CpG dinucleotides in the
enhancer/promoter of these regions has a regulatory role
in gene expression [48]. The CpG suppressed region of the
murid herpesvirus 1 genome encodes 10 genes. We found
that the cA gene proportion in this region (6/10 genes,
60%) was twice as important as in the remaining regions
(46/146, 32%) of the genome, though their difference
might be due to chance (p = 0.085).
The murid herpesvirus 1 genome possesses three (19-kb,
10-kb and 17-kb) regions that are A+T rich relative to
other parts of the genome [47]. Those regions are enriched
in genes encoding membrane glycoprotein (e.g. m02 and
m145 families). Some of those proteins were suggested as
responsible for the evasion from natural killer cell-medi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/456

ated immune surveillance through their interaction with
inhibitory natural killer cell receptors [49,50]. Of 37 genes
within the A+T rich regions, 67% (24 genes) were detected
as cA genes, which is significantly higher than the cA gene
proportion for the remaining genes (23.5%, 28/119
genes, p < 10-5). It is uncertain if the increased A+T levels
of these regions have functional roles. However, it should
be noted that these A+T rich regions contain five of the
seven genes exhibiting significant sequence polymorphisms between strains of murid herpesvirus 1 [51].
Emiliania huxleyi virus-86 (EhV-86) of the Phycodnaviridae
family exhibits two distinct transcription phases during its
lytic infection to the host alga, E. huxleyi [52]. The primary
phase is characterized by the transcriptions of a group of
genes by 1 hour post-infection. The secondary phase
involves the transcriptions of other genes between 2 and
4 hours post-infection. Respectively thirty-eight and 253
genes in our data set (ORF length ≥ 100 codons) correspond to the primary and the secondary transcription
phases. We found a significantly greater fraction of cA
genes in the primary phase (8/38, 21%) than in the secondary phase genes (19/253, 7.5%; p = 0.014). Genes
expressed during the primary phase map in the 104-kb
central genomic region (bases 200,000 to 304,000),
which shows a similar G+C content as the rest of the
genome [53]. It has been suggested that promoter-like elements (family A repeats) uniquely found in this region
control this early expression pattern of EhV-86 [7]. The
functions of the early expression are unknown as most of
the transcribed genes lack detectable homologs in the
databases. Allen et al. postulated that an ancestral EhV
acquired the 104-kb region by horizontal transfer [53].
Mimivirus has unusually well conserved promoter-like
AAAATTGA motifs in the upstream regions of half of its
predicted genes in the genome [39]. Based on the putative
associated gene functions, Suhre et al. predicted that these
promoter-like elements regulate gene expression during
the early stages of the viral infection, whilst most of the
genes contributing to the virus particle are devoid of this
motif [54]. Of 402 genes with the promoter-like motifs in
our data set, 43 (10.6%) were detected as cA genes. Of 508
genes lacking the motifs, 40 (7.9%) were detected as cA
genes. The difference is not statistically significant (p =
0.16).
In summary, we found a significant correlation between
cA genes and previously described functional categories of
genes for three of the five cases. It should be noted that in
the case of EhV, no relationship between expression timing and gene nucleotide composition was previously
reported. This suggests the possible use of nucleotide
composition analysis to predict expression patterns of
viral genes. These results indicate that anomalous nucleo-

tide compositions of some of the cA genes can be due to
functional constraints, although the distinction between
functional constrains and horizontal transfer events is
generally difficult given the known bias in functions of
horizontally transferred genes in prokaryotes [24,26].
Many eukaryotic LDVs exhibit cA genes with putative
functions associated with host defense systems
We classified the cA genes according to their putative functions based on their annotations and further similarity
searches against sequence databases (Additional file 8,
Fig. 6). The vast majority of the cA genes have no predicted
functions. A notable feature among the remaining cA
genes concerns eukaryotic LDVs. We observed that many
eukaryotic LDVs possess cA genes putatively associated
with the control of host defense systems, such as innate/
adaptive immune systems or apoptosis pathways (Additional file 9). Poxviruses, betaherpesviruses and gammaherpesviruses are particularly rich in cA genes of this
category (p ≤ 10-5). They present cA genes having host
homologs such as cytokine (interleukin), chemokine and
MHC class I genes [55]. Remarkably, in nearly all the families of eukaryotic viruses (except for phycodnaviruses),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/456

we found species exhibiting cA genes encoding proteins
putatively involved in apoptosis pathways (Additional file
9). This suggests a possible central role of apoptotic pathways in eukaryotic LDV-host interactions. Those cA genes
may endow these large DNA viruses a capacity to prolong
the integrity of the host cells and thereby "buy time" to
pursue their replication cycles. Alternatively, viruses may
induce host apoptosis to facilitate host cell exit as previously suggested for EhV-86 [7]. The biased nucleotide
compositions of cA genes associated with host defense
systems may be due to their relatively recent origins (i.e.
horizontal gene transfer) and/or particular functional
constraints on their nucleotide compositions.
We found that the protein product from a cA gene in mimivirus (MIMI_L211 previously annotated as unknown
function) exhibits significant sequence similarities to the
C-terminal half of the etoposide-induced 24 (EI24) proteins (pfam07264, E-value < 10-7). EI24 (also known as
PIG8) is directly induced by p53, a critical tumor suppressor coordinating DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular stresses. It has been suggested
that EI24 acts as a pro-apoptotic factor and prevents

tumor spreading in mammals [56]. The N-terminal part of
the EI24, which is missing in MIMI_L211, binds to Bcl-2,
while the function of the C-terminus of EI24 is unknown.
This is the first identification of an EI24-like domain in a
viral genome. The presence of such a domain in mimivirus is puzzling since, to the best of our knowledge, no
apoptotic phenomenon has been described for its unicellular host Acanthamoeba polyphaga. It is notable that
another amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, which carries
out apoptotic processes, possesses a hypothetical ORF
(Q54PW9_DICDI) matching the EI24 domain (E-value <
10-19).
Phylogenetic evidences for horizontal gene transfers
Horizontally acquired genes may or may not exhibit
anomalous nucleotide compositions depending on their
origin. Phylogenetic reconstruction is a more powerful
approach to examine horizontal gene transfers. However,
the approach could be used only for a limited part of our
data set, as most of the cA genes have no detectable
homologs in the databases. Wherever possible, we systematically conducted phylogenetic reconstructions for the cA
genes. Out of a total of 1633 phylogenetic reconstruction,
only eight candidate horizontal gene transfer events were
supported by the reconstructed trees (using conservative
criteria, see Materials and Methods). All these trees
revealed striking phylogenetic incongruities (Additional
file 10): glutathione peroxidase of molluscum contagiosum virus (Additional file 10) (A), interleukin 10 of Cercopithecine herpesvirus 15 (B), hypothetical protein
(R1R) of monkeypox virus (C), G protein-coupled receptor of fowlpox virus (D), photosystem II D2 protein (E)
and site-specific DNA methylase (F) of bacteriophage SPM2, thymidylate synthase of cyanophage P-SSM2 (G)
and cytosine methyl-transferase of cyanophage P-SSM4
(H).

Discussion
We demonstrated that there is no significant correlation
between the G+C content of LDV genomes and that of
their modern hosts, and that the genomic signatures of
LDVs are also significantly different from those of the
hosts. Recently, Mrázek and Karlin reported a similar
result for large DNA viruses based on a smaller data set
than the one used in this study [27]. This simple observation does not favor the "gene pickpockets" depiction of
viruses which supposedly frequently acquire genetic material from their hosts [57,58]. Various factors can potentially account for the existence of species-specific global
nucleotide compositions [18,22]. Most importantly,
LDVs carry their own genes for the major components of
replication machinery. Several authors have suggested
that viruses are ancient and that their evolutionary trajectory could be largely dissociated from those of their
present hosts [2-4]. Accordingly, specific genomic signa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/456

tures of LDV genomes may originate from intrinsic properties of their replication machinery. As an alternative, we
speculate that viruses may take advantage of the compositional differences to re-orient host machineries towards
viral DNA/RNA molecules.
We found no significant correlation between the cA gene
proportion and the size of the LDV genomes. This observation suggests that extremely large sizes of the genomes
of some LDVs such as mimivirus are not due to recent
accretion of foreign genes. By extrapolation, the capacity
to capture foreign genes is unlikely to be the major factor
that determines the tremendous variation in genome size
for DNA viruses [6].
We showed that the degree of intra-genome heterogeneity
was highly variable across LDVs (i.e. the proportion of cA
genes ranging from 1% to 53%). In prokaryotes, anomalous gene nucleotide composition is usually attributed to
horizontal gene acquisition events. It has been argued that
traces of horizontal gene transfer events as old as 100 million years can be detected through the identification of
anomalies in nucleotide composition for bacterial genes
[44]. The composition-based method used in this study
identified horizontally transferred gene candidates for
prokaryotes, which constitute 0% to 25% of their gene
complements. Surprisingly the same method identified
only a comparable level of cA gene proportions for half of
the analyzed LDVs. Furthermore, several LDVs exhibited a
cA proportion as low as that of small parasitic intracellular
bacteria, rarely exchanging genes with other bacteria.
Thus, the nucleotide compositions of LDVs could indicate
no general differences between LDVs and prokaryotes in
the frequency of horizontal gene acquisitions.
Most of the identified cA genes were of unknown functions and did not exhibit cellular homologs in the databases. This also argues against massive HGTs from hosts
to LDVs. One may speculate that cellular homologs could
not be detected due to a faster viral sequence evolution.
However, a recent study showed that evolutionary rates
are similar between LDV genes with database homologs
and those lacking detectable homologs (i.e. ORFans) [8].
Furthermore, functional and structural constraints can
also cause intra-genome compositional heterogeneity. In
this study, we explored several mechanisms that could
potentially cause compositional anomaly in LDV
genomes. These mechanisms include specific gene functions and replication associated strand asymmetry. We
validated a significant enrichment of cA genes in specific
functional categories of genes for some of the LDVs
including EhV-86. We evidenced the presence of a nucleotide composition bias in the EhV-86 genes expressed in
the primary phase that was previously overlooked. In con-

trast, we showed that replication associated compositional asymmetry is not a major cause of cA gene
compositional bias for most of the LDVs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/456

tially arise from particular biological functions at the
nucleic acid level and/or inter-virus gene transfers.

Methods
It should be noted, that highly expressed genes exhibiting
biased codon usages are usually pre-excluded in quantifying the number of horizontally transferred genes in
prokaryotic genomes [26]. Due to the lack of such a general knowledge on viral codon usage bias with functional
consequences, we did not apply such a filter in our computational identification of cA genes. In this regard, possible functional constraints on the nucleotide compositions
will tend to contribute to an overestimation of recent horizontal gene transfers in viruses relative to prokaryotes.
The lack of database homologs or phylogenetic evidences
does not exclude the possible HGT-origins of cA genes.
The hugely diverse world of viruses is probably the most
underrepresented in the current database [59]. Thus, we
speculate that a significant part of these cA genes might
have been transferred from other viruses that are not yet
sequenced. Such inter-virus gene exchange can be
achieved by illegitimate or homologous recombination
[60-62] occasionally leading to the fusion of two viral
genomes [63], or with the aid of mobile elements [64]
upon co-infection of a cell by multiple virus species. Li et
al. described a clear case of HGT from Xestia c-nigrum granulovirus to Mamestra configurata nucleopolyhedrovirus B
[65], though this HGT event was not detected by our study
due to the similar nucleotide compositions of these two
genomes.
Goldenfeld and Woese pointed out the important role of
viruses in the gene flux among microbial communities
[66]. They conceptualized the viral gene pool as a large
dynamic repository of genetic information accessible to
microorganisms. Inter-virus gene transfer may be central
to the dynamics of the viral gene pool. Given the known
diversity of genetic material in the virus world and their
under-representation in the current sequence databases
[67], this hypothesis appears as plausible as the functional/structural scenario in explaining the existence of
compositionally anomalous genes in large DNA viruses.

Conclusion
The genomes of large DNA viruses exhibit nucleotide
compositions largely differing from their host genomes.
Our results based on nucleotide composition analyses,
database searches and phylogenetic tree reconstructions
suggest that horizontal gene transfer to these viruses from
their current hosts is infrequent and does not account for
the large variation in their genome size. However, the viral
genomes still show a variable proportion of compositionally anomalous genes. Such compositional biases poten-

Viral genome data
Viral genome data were downloaded from the viral section of the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database
[68]. We have selected 67 non-redundant double-strand
DNA viral genomes larger than 150 kb from the dataset
(Table 1).
Host sequence data
We prepared 32 sets of protein coding sequence (CDS)
data for viral hosts (Table S6). For viral hosts species for
which complete genome sequences are available, we
downloaded sequence data from KEGG [69]. For other
viral hosts, we retrieved CDS data from GenBank [70]. We
used only CDS longer than or equal to 300 bp. For some
of the CDS data sets built from GenBank, we included
sequences from organisms that are closely related to the
viral host species (Additional file 11). We removed the
sequence redundancy in each CDS data set from GenBank
by keeping only one representative from a cluster of
homologs. Clustering of homologous protein sequences
was performed using BLASTCLUST [71]; we used 40% for
the minimal sequence identity (-S option) and 75% for
the minimal coverage by alignment (-L option) for at least
one sequence (-b option). Of the 32 host sequence data
sets, 26 sets were composed of more than 20 sequences,
and used in this study. These represent the host sequence
data for 61 LDV genomes.
Viral ORF and intergenic sequence data
Based on the RefSeq annotation, we prepared a dataset for
CDSs and non-coding sequences (NCDSs) for viral
genomes. We retained only CDSs longer than or equal to
300 bp, and discarded shorter ones.
Genomic signature distance
For the comparison of statistical nucleotide sequence
properties of CDSs among viruses and their hosts, we used
the method proposed by Sandberg et al. [30]. This method
defines a genomic signature as a set of frequencies of all
overlapping oligonucleotides of specific length k (k = 4 in
this study) in the forward strand of the whole nucleotide
sequences available for a given genome. The distance
between two genomic signatures (X and Y) is calculated as
an Euclidian distance DE, using the following formula:

⎡
D E( X , Y ) = ⎢
⎢
⎣

n

∑
i =1

1
⎤2
( X i − Yi ) 2 ⎥ ,
⎥
⎦

where n = 256 for k = 4.

Identification of compositionally anomalous genes
To detect cA genes in LDV genomes, we used the computer
program developed by Nakamura et al. [26]. We used a
Markov order of 3 with a 96 bp window sliding with a step
size of 12 bp along the genome. A Monte-Carlo simulation was used to compute the statistical significance of the
nucleotide composition bias in a gene as in Nakamura et
al.. The threshold for the statistical was set to 1% significance (unilateral statistical test). In addition to the dataset
derived from RefSeq, a control dataset was generated from
the viral genomic sequences by conserving only open
reading frames longer than or equal to 300 bp that exhibit
significant sequence similarity hits to database sequences
from cellular organisms or distantly related virus, using
BLASTP [71] against SwissProt/TrEMBL [72] and the viral
RefSeq databases. The proportions of the cA genes for the
control dataset varied from 0% to 54% across different
viruses, and correlated with the cA gene proportions for
the dataset derived from RefSeq (R2 = 0.73, p < 0.001, not
shown). In the manuscript we show only the results
obtained from the RefSeq dataset.
Statistical test for cA genes co-localization
We conducted two distinct statistical tests for physical
proximity of cA genes in a viral genome (i.e. clustering of
genes along the chromosome) using a Monte-Carlo simulation. First, we counted the number of pairs (n) of cA
genes that were consecutively encoded in the genome. We
shuffled the order of genes in the genome 1000 times and
obtained the distribution of n in the randomized data.
The distribution was used to determine p-value for n from
the real data. Second, we recorded the size (number of
genes, N) of each cA gene cluster. From the Monte-Carlo
simulation, we obtained the p-value for the observation of
at least one cA gene cluster with the size equal to or greater
than N genes.
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction
All the cA genes were searched against the SwissProt/
TrEMBL database using BLASTP (E-value < 10-5) to identify homologous sequences. For each gene, we retrieved
50 best hits at the maximum from the database, and
aligned them to the candidate sequence using MUSCLE
[73]. We improved these initial alignments by removing
highly divergent or fragmented sequences with visual
inspection of the alignments. The alignments were used to
generate neighbor-joining (NJ) trees using CLUSTALW
[74] with Kimura's correction for distance. Some of the NJ
trees were selected for further analyses by the neighborjoining method with Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model [75] using MEGA [76] and the maximum
likelihood method by PHYML [77]. The results of the
BLAST searches were also served to assign putative functions to the cA genes where the annotations in the RefSeq
database were inadequate for our analysis.

Phylogenetic evidences for HGT
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is usually invoked, when
a phylogenetic tree based on gene sequences is incongruent with a species tree. In this study, we assumed deep
phylogenetic origins for large DNA virus lineages (i.e.
before the divergence of major phyla of cellular organisms), which have been indicated by the analyses conserved genes (e.g. DNA polymerase) [5,78]. To list up
candidates of HGT, we first identified cases where the
grouping of viral sequences, V, and their cellular
homologs, I, is supported with a high bootstrap value (i.e.
≥ 80% for (V, I)]). As the reconstructed tree is unrooted, V
could represent an outgroup of I and other cellular
homologs. In this case, HGT between viruses, V, and cellular organisms, I, is not required to account for the gene
tree topology. To eliminate this possibility, we demanded
one of the following two additional criteria for potential
HGT events.
Additional criteria 1
- From independent evidences, one can chose a group of
sequences, O1, representing an outgroup of I.

- From independent evidences, one can chose a group of
sequences, O2, representing an outgroup of I and O1.
[Consequently, the tree topology will become (O2, (O1,
(V, I))), when rooted by O2.]
Additional criteria 2
- There are only a few species and/or genera in I.

- Other sequences outside the (V, I) group are from a wide
variety of genera.
- The branches from the root of (V, I) to V and I are relatively shorter than the branches from the root of (V, I) to
other peripheral nodes.

(horizontal axis) and from host genome (vertical axis) were computed.
(A): non-cA genes. (B) and (C): cA genes. In (C), the vertical axis corresponds to the distance between the cA genes and a randomly chosen host
genome.
