The complete genome sequence and genetic
analysis of FCA82 a novel uncultured
microphage from the turkey gastrointestinal
system
Laszlo Zsak1*, J Michael Day1, Brian B Oakley2 and Bruce S Seal2

Abstract
The genomic DNA sequence of a novel enteric uncultured microphage, FCA82 from a turkey gastrointestinal
system was determined utilizing metagenomics techniques. The entire circular, single-stranded nucleotide
sequence of the genome was 5,514 nucleotides. The FCA82 genome is quite different from other microviruses as
indicated by comparisons of nucleotide similarity, predicted protein similarity, and functional classifications. Only
three genes showed significant similarity to microviral proteins as determined by local alignments using BLAST
analysis. ORF1 encoded a predicted phage F capsid protein that was phylogenetically most similar to the
Microviridae FMH2K member’s major coat protein. The FCA82 genome also encoded a predicted minor capsid
protein (ORF2) and putative replication initiation protein (ORF3) most similar to the microviral bacteriophage SpV4.
The distant evolutionary relationship of FCA82 suggests that the divergence of this novel turkey microvirus from
other microviruses may reflect unique evolutionary pressures encountered within the turkey gastrointestinal system.

Introduction
Metagenomics analyses have lead to the discovery of a
variety of microbial nucleotide sequences from environmental samples [1]. These techniques have also allowed
for the discovery of uncultured viral nucleotide
sequences that are commonly from bacteriophages [2-4]
that has also resulted in the discovery of useful enzymes
for molecular biology [5]. There has been a resurgent
interest in bacteriophage biology and their use or use of
phage gene products as antibacterial agents [6-8]. Bacteriophages are thought to be the most abundant life form
as a group [9] and the importance of phage to bacterial
evolution [10,11], the role of phage or prophage encoded
virulence factors that contribute to bacterial infectious
diseases [12-14] and their contribution to horizontal gene
transfer [15] cannot be over stated. Additionally, the

contribution to microbial ecology [16] and to agricultural
production [17,18] is also extremely important.
Enteric diseases are an important economic production problem for the poultry industry worldwide. One of
the major economically important enteric diseases for
the poultry industry are the poult enteritis complex
(PEC) and poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) in
turkeys and a runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) in broiler chickens [19]. Consequently, studies have been
ongoing to identify novel enteric viruses among poultry
species at our laboratory. In a recent study, we utilized
the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile an RNA virus metagenome from turkey flocks
experiencing enteric disease [20]. This approach yielded
numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the
BLAST nr protein database, many of which have not
been described in turkeys.
Additionally, we have successfully applied a random
PCR-based method for detection of unknown microorganisms from enteric samples of turkeys that resulted in identification of genomic sequences and subsequent

determination of the full-length genome from a previously
uncultured parvovirus [21]. During these ongoing investigations to further characterize the turkey gut microbiome
and identify novel viral pathogens of poultry, bacteriophage genomic sequences have also been identified. Herein
we report the complete genomic sequence of a putative
novel member of the Microviridae obtained from turkey
gastrointestinal DNA samples utilizing metagenomics
approaches. The protein sequences of FCA82 were most
similar to those of Chlamydia phages.

Materials and Methods
Assembly of FCA82, a novel member of the Microviridae
family

Forty-two complete intestinal tracts (from duodenum/
pancreas to cloaca, including cecal tonsils) from a turkey
farm in California, U.S.A. with histories of enteric disease
problems were received at the Southeast Poultry Research
Laboratory (SEPRL). The intestines were processed and
pooled into a single sample, as previously described [22].
A sequence-independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
protocol was employed to amplify particle-associated
nucleic acid (PAN) present in turkey intestinal homogenates, and has been described elsewhere in detail [22].
Using this approach, a total of 576 clones were identified
and sequenced with the M13 forward and reverse primers
on an AB-3730 automated DNA sequencer. The
sequenced clones were used as query sequences to search
the GenBank non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases using the blastn and blastx algorithms [23]. In total,
the majority of clones with inserts had no hit in the databases using tblastx [24]. However, 46% of the cloned DNA
had homology to cellular DNA, bacterial DNA, bacteriophage DNA, and several eukaryotic viral DNA genomes.

Twelve DNA clones had sequence similarity to singlestranded DNA microphages, which have also been identified predominantly in microbialites [25]. A contig, CA82
with an average of eightfold coverage and length of 1962
nt was assembled from eight of those clones. This contig
had no significant nucleotide similarity to database
sequences, but the deduced amino acid sequence revealed
significant similarity to the members of the family Microviridae. This initial contig was used to design PCR primers
in the opposite orientation of the circular ssDNA to
assemble into a contiguous FCA82 genome. The PCR
amplification resulted in a 3.4 kb product that closed the
gap between the CA82 contig and the rest of the circular
genome. The final sequence was confirmed by sub-cloning
and primer walking with primers resulting ~1 kb fragments containing 250 bp overlapping sequences across the
genome. The circular DNA genome was assembled from
contigs exhibiting 100% nucleotide identity within the
overlapping regions.
Sequence analysis

The FCA82 genome and ORFs were aligned with selected
microvirus sequences using ClustalW [26]. Putative ORFs
within the FCA82 genome were predicted using the FGENESV Trained Pattern/Markov chain-based viral gene prediction method from the Softberry website [27]. Searches
for conserved domains within the FCA82 genome were
performed with the Conserved Domain Database (CDD)
Search Service v2.17 at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website [28].
Comparative genomics of the Microviridae

The sequence of phage FCA82 was compared to 14

from the integrated microbial genomes (IMG) system
[29]. To first determine nucleotide level similarities,
tetra-nucleotide comparisons between genomes were
performed with jspecies [30]. Pairwise genome comparisons were based on regressions of normalized tetranucleotide frequency counts and the distributions of the
R2 values from these comparisons were visualized in R
[31]. To compare genomes based on similarity of predicted gene sequences, the program CD-HIT [32] was
used.
Genomic functional comparisons were based on pfam
categories for each predicted gene as classified by the
IMG annotation pipeline [29]. A data table of pfam
categories and gene counts for each genome was used
to construct a similarity matrix and dendrogram in R.
To determine which predicted genes were unique to
FCA82 and those which were shared with other Microviridae members, the Microviridae pangenome was constructed as the union of all predicted genes from the 14
Microviridae genomes and compared to predicted genes
for FCA82 using both CD-HIT and our data analysis
pipeline as described above and blastp run with default
parameters except for an e-value cutoff of 0.01.
Nucleotide accession number

The nucleotide sequence of FCA82 genome was deposited in GenBank under accession number HQ264138.

Results and Discussion
The FCA82 genome

The entire circular, single-stranded nucleotide sequence
for the uncultured microvirus FCA82 genome was
determined to be 5,514 nucleotides. The complete genome sequence had a nucleotide composition of A
(38.6%), C (19.6%), G (20.1%), and T (21.6%) with an
overall G + C content of 39.7%, which is similar to the
chlamydial phages (37-40%). The FCA82 genome was
organized in a modular arrangement similar to microviruses [33,34] and encoded predicted proteins homologous to those chlamydial bacteriophage types [35] and
to the Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus FMH2K [36]. The coding capacity of the genome is 91% as it encodes ten
ORFs, greater than 99 nucleotides similarly to other
chlamydial microvirus genomes [35]. The genome size,
number of ORFs and total coding % of nucleotides as
depicted in Figure 1 is larger than most of the chlamydial phages and is closer in size to the FX174 genome
[33,34].
Capsid proteins of FCA82

The amino acid identities and homologies between
FCA82 ORF gene products and predicted proteins from
selected phages are presented in Table 2. A total of ten
genes could be identified of which only three gene

products could be assigned with a known function
based upon BLAST analysis. The predicted major capsid
protein VP1 encoded by ORF1 belongs to the family of
single-stranded bacteriophages and is the major structural component of the virion that may contain as many
as 60 copies of the protein [37,38]. The closest sequence
similarity of the 565 amino acid FCA82 VP1 protein
was with the Spiroplasma phage 4 (SpV4) capsid protein
[39] and the chlamydial phage VP1 proteins
[35,38,40-42], as well as the Chlamydia prophage
CPAR39 [43] and Bdellovibrio phage FMH2K major
capsid protein [36]. A putative minor capsid protein of
234 amino acids was encoded by ORF2 that had similarity to the chlamydial bacteriophages [35,40-43] and the
Bdellovibrio phage FMH2K [36] that was originally postulated to be an attachment protein [38].
Recent studies using a comparative metagenomic analysis of viral communities associated with marine and
freshwater microbialites indicated that identifiable
sequences in these were dominated by single-stranded
DNA microphages [25]. Partial sequence analysis of the
VP1 gene from these microphages showed that the similarity between metagenomic clones and cultured microphage capsid sequences ranged from 47.5 to 61.2% at
the nucleic-acid level and from 37.2 to 69.3% at the protein level, respectively. Interestingly, the VP1 gene of
FCA82 has a similarly high level of sequence similarity
(69.1% at the amino acid level) with the seawater metagenomic phages within the same VP1 region (data not
shown). This observation is consistent with an environmental origin of modern poultry phages that have since
undergone significant host-specific evolutionary divergence in agricultural settings.
A multiple alignment of major capsid proteins among
diverse members shows similarities within the entire

Figure 2 Multiple amino acid alignment of the major structural protein, VP1 of FCA82 with VP1 proteins from other Microviridae
members. Deletions (-), non-homologous amino acids (dots in the sequence), identical amino acids (*), residues with strong similarity (:), and
weak similarity (.) are indicated. Variable large IN5 and short Ins regions are shaded gray.

short variable Ins sequences of FCA82 are putatively
located from residues 459 through 464 of the VP1
protein.
Chipman et al [44] predicted that the IN5 trimer
structure in VP1 may function as a substitute for spike
proteins of the FX174-like viruses, which are not found
in SpV4 or the Chlamydia phages, and as such may be
responsible for receptor recognition. It has also been
suggested that the diverse sequence in this region is
associated with host range of phages [36,41,43,44]. The
presence of a large insertion in FCA82 further supports
that it is closer to the intracellular phage subfamily and
the sequence dissimilarity within this region between
the FCA82 and various other phages strongly indicates
that this domain indeed may function as a host range
determinant.
Rep protein of FCA82

ORF3 encoded a putative replication initiation protein
that was most similar to the SpV4-rep [39] and the
Bdellovibrio phage FMH2K-rep [36] proteins (Table 2).
Pairwise alignment of the FCA82 VP3 (rep) protein and
SpV4 p1 (rep) protein revealed the presence of two conserved domains (Figure 3) from residues 73 through 176
and 195 through 320 of the FCA82 protein. Overall, the
two rep proteins only had 22.6% identity, but shared
many of the same sequences throughout the conserved
regions that were recognized by BLAST as putative
replication initiation protein regions. Rep protein plays
an essential role in viral DNA replication and binds the

origin of replication where it cleaves the dsDNA replicative form I (RFI) and becomes covalently bound to it via
phosphotyrosine bond (see active sites in Figure 3). The
conservation of the functional domains between the
FCA82 phage rep protein and other microviral replication initiation proteins suggests a similar pathway/
mechanism for DNA replication and virion packaging.
Full genome comparisons of FCA82 with other members
of the Microviridae

The FCA82 genome is quite different from other members of Microviridae as indicated by comparisons of
nucleotide similarity, predicted protein similarity, and
functional classifications. Comparisons of FCA82 to 14
other Microviridae genomes showed very low correlations of tetra-nucleotide frequencies as a measure of
genome similarity. FCA82 was most similar to SpV4,
but the correlation of tetra-nucleotide frequencies was
poor (R2 = 0.33; Figure 4A). Only FMH2K had lower
similarities to other Microviridae (Figure 4A). Clustering
of predicted proteins showed FCA82 was most closely
related to a clade comprised of the chlamydial phages,
but as in the nucleotide comparisons, the predicted proteins of FCA82 are quite distinct from those of the
other microviruses (Figure 4B). Function-based clustering of genomes using pfam categories showed that
FCA82 was most similar to SpV4 (Figure 4C), based on
shared membership of the FCA82 ORF1 in pfam02305,
an F super family capsid protein. These results were
confirmed by comparisons of predicted proteins from

Figure 4 Genome-based comparisons of FCA82 and 14 other Microviridae. A) Comparisons of tetra-nucleotide frequencies as a measure of
genome similarity at the nucleotide level. Boxplot represents the distributions of R2 values for pairwise comparisons of tetra-nucleotide
frequencies for each genome compared to all others. For each genome, the closest match (highest R2) is shown to the right. B) Genomic
sequence similarity as assessed by clustering of predicted amino-acid sequences. Clustering was completed with CD-HIT as described in the text,
which accomplishes an all-versus-all comparison of each predicted protein. Sequence clusters were determined with a 40% similarity cutoff
(sequences must be >40% similar for membership within the same cluster); tree is based on cluster memberships across all genomes. C)
Genomic functional similarity as assessed by gene counts for each genome in pfam categories as classified by IMG. Tree construction
methodology is essentially identical to (B), but based on functional cluster membership rather than clustering based on sequence similarity. D)
Shared and unique predicted genes between FCA82 and all 14 other Microviridae members as determined by the CD-HIT clustering used for (B)
and BLAST as described in the text.

the FCA82 genome to a Microviridae pangenome. This
analysis showed only three genes with significant similarity as determined by local alignments using blastp
with no overlap between FCA82 and the Microviridae
pangenome based on global alignments at a 40% similarity cutoff (Figure 4D). FCA82 is only distantly related to
other Microviridae, but is most similar to SpV4 and the
chlamydial phages. In summary, the whole genome
comparisons of FCA82 to other Microviridae members
indicate a distant evolutionary relationship, perhaps suggesting that the divergence of FCA82 from other microviruses reflects unique evolutionary pressures
encountered within the turkey gastrointestinal system.
