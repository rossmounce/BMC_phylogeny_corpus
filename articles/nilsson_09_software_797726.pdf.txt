Abstract
Background: Fungi from environmental samples are typically identified to species level through
DNA sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for use in
BLAST-based similarity searches in the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases. These
searches are time-consuming and regularly require a significant amount of manual intervention and
complementary analyses. We here present software – in the form of an identification pipeline for
large sets of fungal ITS sequences – developed to automate the BLAST process and several
additional analysis steps. The performance of the pipeline was evaluated on a dataset of 350 ITS
sequences from fungi growing as epiphytes on building material.
Results: The pipeline was written in Perl and uses a local installation of NCBI-BLAST for the
similarity searches of the query sequences. The variable subregion ITS2 of the ITS region is
extracted from the sequences and used for additional searches of higher sensitivity. Multiple
alignments of each query sequence and its closest matches are computed, and query sequences
sharing at least 50% of their best matches are clustered to facilitate the evaluation of hypothetically
conspecific groups. The pipeline proved to speed up the processing, as well as enhance the
resolution, of the evaluation dataset considerably, and the fungi were found to belong chiefly to the
Ascomycota, with Penicillium and Aspergillus as the two most common genera. The ITS2 was found to
indicate a different taxonomic affiliation than did the complete ITS region for 10% of the query
sequences, though this figure is likely to vary with the taxonomic scope of the query sequences.
Conclusion: The present software readily assigns large sets of fungal query sequences to their
respective best matches in the international sequence databases and places them in a larger
biological context. The output is highly structured to be easy to process, although it still needs to
be inspected and possibly corrected for the impact of the incomplete and sometimes erroneously
annotated fungal entries in these databases. The open source pipeline is available for UNIX-type
platforms, and updated releases of the target database are made available biweekly. The pipeline is
easily modified to operate on other molecular regions and organism groups.

Background
The fungal kingdom is thought to comprise upwards of
1.5 million species, a figure that contrasts sharply with the
97,000 species of fungi described so far [1,2]. The discrepancy between the estimated and the known fungal diversity is largely ascribable to the non-conspicuous nature of
fungal life; most species are readily visible, and thus amenable for collection, only when they form fruiting-bodies
or other propagation structures [3,4]. Yet fungi are ubiquitously present in all biota as mycelia or other, non-hyphal
life stages, and studies have revealed that fungi may
account for as much as 90% of the living biomass of some
ecosystems [5]. The important ecological roles played by
fungi in terms of nutrient recycling, symbiosis, and parasitism call for a deeper, taxonomy-oriented understanding
of the mycoflora of the world, and one far more detailed
than any fruiting-body based field inventory could ever
bring about [6,7]. Mycologists of today thus face the
daunting task of locating and identifying large sets of
fungi from non-trivial substrates such as soil, decaying
wood, and plant debris, often in the complete absence of
any physical manifestation of the fungi present.
The last ten years have seen a surge in the use of DNA
sequences as a means to seek to identify fungi from various substrates and in different life stages to species level
[8,9]. The most frequently sequenced region for such purposes is the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the
nuclear ribosomal DNA [10]. Though it does not come
without complications [11], this ~550 base-pair (bp),
transcribed but non-coding region is present in upwards
of 250 copies per cell [12], which makes it relatively
straightforward to amplify even from scanty input material. The high level of variability in two of its three subregions (ITS1 and ITS2) coupled with the very low
variability of the intercalary third subregion (5.8S) make
the region an advantageous choice for assignment of a
query sequence to species level or a higher fungal taxon
[13,14]. Such inferences are typically achieved through
similarity searches using BLAST [15] against the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases (INSD: GenBank,
EMBL, DDBJ; [16]).
While BLAST is a powerful and versatile software package,
its use over the web is dependent on server load and web
traffic intensity. To compile and interpret its output in the
case of multiple query sequences tends to be time-consuming and involve a significant amount of manual intervention. It is furthermore often necessary to re-run a
certain proportion of the query sequences after the
removal of overly conserved sequence segments – here the
nuclear small subunit (nSSU/16S/18S), the 5.8S, and the
nuclear large subunit (nLSU/25S/28S) – in order to obtain
fine-grained detail [13,17-19]. It may even be necessary to
compile a multiple alignment of certain query sequences

http://www.scfbm.org/content/4/1/1

and their respective best matches and analyse the alignment under more powerful optimality criteria than similarity – such as phylogenetic analysis – in order to obtain
sufficient resolution [cf. [20-23]]. To process an authentic
set of fungal sequences obtained through environmental
sampling thus often proves a lengthy and laborious process. The present study attempts a remedy in the form of a
Perl-based software pipeline for rapid BLAST processing of
large sets (10–100,000 s) of fungal query sequences. The
pipeline streamlines functions such as automated ITS2based BLAST runs for finer precision, the computation of
multiple alignments for subsequent use, and the generation of comprehensible and easily analysed summaries of
the results. The pipeline is designed to work in any UNIXtype environment (including MacOS X, Linux, and BSD)
for which NCBI-BLAST, HMMER [24], and one or more of
Clustal W [25], DIALIGN-TX [26], and MAFFT [27] are
available.
To evaluate the performance of the pipeline on a large,
authentic dataset, 350 ITS sequences were obtained from
fungi growing on buildings in Sweden. Fungal growth on
building material causes significant economic loss and is
frequently connected to the Sick Building Syndrome [28].
The present sampling was carried out as a part of a larger
study to characterize such fungal communities; detailed
knowledge of the taxonomic affiliations of these fungi is
likely to form a key element in assessing health risks
caused by mass occurrence of fungi in moist damaged
buildings [29].

Implementation and methods
The pipeline [Additional file 1] was written in Perl 5 [30]
and acts as a wrapper for NCBI-BLAST, HMMER, and
Clustal W/DIALIGN-TX/MAFFT. By default, all fungal ITS
sequences annotated as such in INSD are used as target
database (approximately 110,000 sequences as of December 2008). Optionally, the user may choose to include
only sequences identified to species level in the database.
Tailored, biweekly updated versions of these databases are
made available by the authors at [31].
For each query sequence, blastn of the NCBI-BLAST package is run locally, and the result is parsed to retrieve the 15
(default; adjustable) best (topmost) matches in INSD. An
attempt is then made to locate and extract the ITS2 from
the same query sequence using HMMER and the Markov
models employed by Nilsson et al [14]. If successful, the
ITS2 of the query sequence is used as the query in a new
BLAST run against the same database, again with the 15
(default) best matches saved. The fifteen best matches of
the first BLAST run are aligned jointly with the query
sequence using Clustal W (default), DIALIGN-TX, or
MAFFT to present the sequences in a more integrative context than the pairwise alignments of the BLAST output.

The default value of the number of sequences to retain in
the above steps was set to 15 as a product of the present
focus on very similar sequences and the computational
capacity at hand.
Upon completion of the BLAST runs, all query sequences
that share at least 50% (default; adjustable) of their 15
best BLAST matches are clustered and aligned accordingly.
Conspecific and closely related sequences are likely to be
grouped into clusters in this step. Similarly, all sequences
not a member of any such group are listed – in all likelihood, these singleton sequences represent species present
only once among the query sequences. Ample screen output is given for each of the query sequences, and the
results are summarized in a joint tab-separated file for
viewing in any spreadsheet-type program (e.g., Open
Office or Excel). The pipeline is released under the GNUGPL software license version 2 and makes use of only
freely available software. Although distributed over the
web, the pipeline does not require an Internet connection
to run.
The fungi were isolated from different kinds of building
materials, e.g. wood, fibreboard, and linoleum mat, with
varying extent of mould growth on the surface. The surface of the sample was scraped with a sterile needle and
the scraped product was mixed with distilled water. The
suspension was spread out on Petri dishes (Ø 9 cm) containing 2% malt extract agar (MEA) or dichloran 18% –
glycerol agar (DG18). The samples were incubated in daylight at room temperature (20°C). Subsequently, fungal
colonies were sub-cultured to new Petri dishes (Ø 6 cm)
as part of the cleaning process. A total of 350 sequences
were extracted using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN,
Hilden); amplified using READY-TO-GO PCR beads
(QIAGEN) and the ITS1F and ITS4 primers; purified using
the QiaQuick Spin Procedure Kit (QIAGEN); and
sequenced using the ITS1F and ITS4 primers and the CEQ
2000XL DNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton). Full details of the laboratory procedures are available in [32]. The sequences were pooled and fed to the
pipeline using its default settings. Decisions of taxonomic
affiliations were done considering the results from both
the full ITS region and from the ITS2 region, including
studying the alignments in non-trivial cases, with priority
given to the ITS2 data where the results differed.

Results and discussion
The 350 query sequences from mould growth on building
material were found to be distributed among 42 distinct
groups, each composed of mutually similar sequences to
the exclusion of the other groups, and 27 singletons that
did not match any other query sequence closely. The absolute majority (98%) of the fungal species recovered were
found to belong to the Ascomycota, with a modest 2% of

http://www.scfbm.org/content/4/1/1

the sequences belonging to the Zygomycota (Fig. 1; Additional file 2). The two most common genera, Penicillium
and Aspergillus, were totally dominant among the
sequences with an occurrence of 58% and 16%, respectively. The most frequently occurring Penicillium species
were P. chrysogenum, P. corylophilum, P. glabrum, and P.
commune. The three latter species have as a rule not been
identified to species level – but rather only to genus level
– in prior biodiversity studies of building material due to
the considerable difficulties in telling them apart using
morphological analysis [33,34], a shortcoming that
molecular data and the present software package are set to
address. Aspergillus versicolor, A. niger, and A. ustus were the
three most common species of the genus Aspergillus,
which again represents a finer view than that presented in
many surveys based on traditional techniques. Indeed, the
view of the building mycoflora as revealed by the software
pipeline shares many overall similarities with those from
similar studies [35] but stands out through the level of resolution obtained on the species level [36,37]. The taxonomic and nomenclatural issues surrounding Penicillium
and Aspergillus are far from trivial, however, and the lack
of inclusive modern revisions and well-identified reference sequences are likely to have influenced the results of
the present and many other efforts.
The evaluation dataset took two hours to run on a singlecore 2.3 GHz Pentium 4 workstation. This is a considerable improvement in speed over any attempt at performing
the corresponding BLAST runs over the web at INSD – particularly if complementary analyses have to be performed
for some subset of the query sequences – and additional
speed gains are to be attained if the pipeline is run on
multiple-core processors. Manual inspection of the results
revealed that the function to extract, and base the BLAST
run on, the ITS2 gave a different taxonomic result than did
the complete ITS region for about 10% of the cases (Additional file 2). This observation highlights the usefulness of
excluding the very conserved genes encoding for the ribosomal small subunit, 5.8S, and large subunit, particularly
when sequences from species not present in the target
database are used as query. The magnitude of the discrepancy between the taxonomic signal obtained from the
ITS2 and from the entire ITS region (including any portions of the flanking genes) can be expected to vary among
different groups of fungi.
The largest shortcoming of the present pipeline, as indeed
with all sequence-based identification procedures, is the
wanting state of taxonomic coverage and reliability in the
public sequence databases. These vary among different
taxonomic groups but form a tangible problem for the
fungal entries. A mere 13,300 (14%) of the 97,000
described species of fungi are represented by at least one
fully identified ITS sequence in INSD, a number that, in

turn, pales in comparison with the estimated 1.5 million
extant species of fungi. More than 10% of the fungal INSD
sequences under study have, furthermore, been shown to
be incorrectly identified to species level [38,39]. Adding to
the complexity, 39% of the fungal ITS sequences in INSD
are not identified to species level in the first place, and
their sheer number often serves to mask the presence of
explanatory, fully identified sequences in the BLAST hit
list [40-42]. This is, however, a problem to which the
present study offers a partial remedy in the form of the
option to use only fully identified sequences in the BLAST
reference database.

in-depth analyses. As with BLAST itself, however, the pipeline should be used on the understanding that definite
assignment of a query sequence to species level is not
amenable to algorithmic interpretation other than in a
trivial sense, and in consideration of the fact that additional analysis steps may be needed, particularly for problematic query sequences.
