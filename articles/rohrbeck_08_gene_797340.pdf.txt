Abstract
Methods: We examined gene expression profiles of tumor cells from 29 untreated patients with lung cancer (10
adenocarcinomas (AC), 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and 9 small cell lung cancer (SCLC)) in comparison to 5
samples of normal lung tissue (NT). The European and American methodological quality guidelines for microarray
experiments were followed, including the stipulated use of laser capture microdissection for separation and purification
of the lung cancer tumor cells from surrounding tissue.
Results: Based on differentially expressed genes, different lung cancer samples could be distinguished from each other
and from normal lung tissue using hierarchical clustering. Comparing AC, SCC and SCLC with NT, we found 205, 335
and 404 genes, respectively, that were at least 2-fold differentially expressed (estimated false discovery rate: < 2.6%).
Different lung cancer subtypes had distinct molecular phenotypes, which also reflected their biological characteristics.
Differentially expressed genes in human lung tumors which may be of relevance in the respective lung cancer subtypes
were corroborated by quantitative real-time PCR.
Genetic programming (GP) was performed to construct a classifier for distinguishing between AC, SCC, SCLC, and NT.
Forty genes, that could be used to correctly classify the tumor or NT samples, have been identified. In addition, all
samples from an independent test set of 13 further tumors (AC or SCC) were also correctly classified.
Conclusion: The data from this research identified potential candidate genes which could be used as the basis for the
development of diagnostic tools and lung tumor type-specific targeted therapies.

Background
Lung cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases
in terms of their biology and the clinical course. The diagnosis and classification of lung cancers are primarily
based on the histological morphology and immunohistological methods for distinguishing between small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) [1]. The molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer,
as far as it has been deciphered, consists of genetic and
epigenetic alterations, including the activation of protooncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes [24]. This leads to a malignant phenotype, resulting in
changes in cell structure, adhesion and cell proliferation
[5].
Oligonucleotide microarray studies are commonly used
to extend the knowledge of the differences in the biology
of lung tumors and to identify new candidate genes with
diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value [6-9]. Several
gene expression profiling studies in lung cancer have been
published, however, it is still difficult to compare these
studies due to the differences in methodologies, array
platforms, normalization of the data and biostatistical
analyses approaches, which may influence the reproducibility and comparability [10-12]. Such differences could
have led to divergent results, with limited overlap of
described genes.
Another crucial step in the field of oligonucleotide microarray studies is the preparation of the solid tumor sample
itself. It contains a variable amount of mesenchymal
stroma cells, blood vessels, fibroblasts, tumor-invading
lymphocytes and necrotic areas next to the tumor cells
themselves. Analyzing the complete tumor sample without efficient separation of the tumor cell confounds the
true gene expression profile of the tumor.
In order to overcome these methodological limitations,
we followed the guidelines from the Microarray Gene
Expression Data Society [13] and the MicroArray Quality
Control (MAQC) Consortium [14,15], the External RNA
Controls Consortium (ERCC) [16] as well as the European consensus guidelines for gene expression experiments [17]. The purification of the tumor cells was carried
out by laser capture microdissection (LCM), which has
been shown to greatly improve the sample preparation for
microarray expression analysis [18]. Few reports on LCM
and microarray gene expression analysis have been published to date, comparing all distinct lung cancer subtypes
to normal lung tissue [19-21].
In this report, we performed a comparison of gene expression profiles, using microarray analysis and LCM, according to the methodological quality consensus guidelines
for microarray experiments, with the aim of identifying

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/6/1/69

genes that are differentially expressed in the major histological lung cancer subtypes, as compared to normal lung
tissue. In addition, 14 differentially expressed genes in
human lung tumors were corroborated by quantitative
real-time PCR. Furthermore, using genetic programming,
we found a subset of 40 genes, that could be utilized for
the classification of different types of lung tumors.

Materials and methods
Lung tumor samples
Samples of lung tumors were obtained using bronchoscopy or CT-guided needle aspiration from 29 patients,
newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer. The samples
that were immediately fixed in RNA-later consisted of 10
adenocarcinomas, 10 squamous cell carcinomas and 9
small cell lung carcinomas. Control samples of normal
lung tissue were obtained from 5 patients with suspected
tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, without presence of malignant lung tumors. The histopathological diagnosis was
based on routinely processed hematoxylin-eosin stains
and confirmed by immunohistochemical staining looking for pan-cytokeratin, cytokeratin 5 and 7, chromogranin A, synaptophysin and tissue-transcripion-factor1. For validation of the classificator from genetic programming, 13 lung cancer samples were selected as a test-set
from patients with advanced NSCLC lung cancers. All
patients gave their informed consent and the study was
approved by the ethics committee of the Heinrich-Heine
University, Duesseldorf.
Laser capture microdissection
From each frozen tumor tissue, we prepared 8-μm thick
sections. The sections were fixed in methanol/acetic acid
and stained in hematoxylin. The tumor cells were identified and ascertained in the sample by an experienced
pathologist using the Autopix 100 automated LCM system
and collected on a CapSure HS LCM Cap (Arcturus,
Mount View, CA). Following microdissection, total RNAextraction was performed with the RNeasy Micro Kit
(QIAamp DNA MicroKit Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA, USA),
according to the manufacturer's instruction. A standard
quality control of the total RNA was performed using the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, USA).
RNA isolation, cRNA labeling and hybridization to
microarrays
The described procedures strictly adhered to the guidelines from the Microarray Gene Expression Data Society
and the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) Consortium, the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC), as
well as the European consensus guidelines for gene
expression experiments [13-17]. The full description of
the Extraction protocol, labeling and labeling protocol,
hybridization protocol and data processing is obtainable

(accession
number
GSE6044). Total RNA (median: 375 ng; range: 250 – 500
ng) was used to generate biotin-labeled cRNA (median:
6,5 μg; range: 3–10 μg) by means of Message Amp aRNA
Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Quality control
of RNA and cRNA was performed using a bioanalyzer
(Agilent 2001 Biosizing, Agilent Technologies). Following
fragmentation, labeled cRNA of each individual patient
sample was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-Focus GeneChips, covering 8793 genes, and stained according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Quantification, normalization and statistical analysis
The quality control, normalization and data analysis, were
assured with the affy package of functions of statistical
scripting language 'R' integrated into the Bioconductor
project http://www.bioconductor.org/, as described previously [22]. Using histograms of perfect match intensities,
5' to 3' RNA degradation side-by-side plots, or scatter
plots, we estimated the quality of samples and hybridizations. To normalize raw data, we used a method of variance stabilizing transformations (VSN) [23]. To compare
the normalized data from AC, SCC, SCLC and normal
lung tissue, we used the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) algorithm v2.23 http://www-stat.stan
ford.edu/~tibs/SAM/ which contains a sliding scale for
false discovery rate (FDR) of significantly up- and downregulated genes [24]. All data were permuted 1000 times
by using the two classes, unpaired data mode of the algorithm. As a cut-off for significance, an estimated FDR of
2.6% was chosen by the tuning parameter delta of the
software. The significance level of each gene was given by
the q-value describing the lowest FDR in multiple testing
[25], and a cut-off for fold-change of differential expression of 2 was used.

Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was used to determine components of variation in the data in this study.
For these analyses we used the unsupervised complete
linkage algorithm.
The data points were organized in a phylogenetic tree with
the branch lengths represent the degree of similarity
between the values. Significantly expressed genes were
uploaded to KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes) and functional annotation was performed.
Genes that were not listed or could be classified in more
than one functional group were reviewed for the function
based on the literature available using Pubmed, OMIM
and GENE available in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Corroboration of RNA expression data was performed by
realtime PCR using the ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/6/1/69

Detection System Instrument (Applied Biosystems,
Applera Deutschland GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany).
Total RNA, ranging between 600 – 1000 ng, underwent
reverse transcription using a High capacity cDNA Archive
Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Applied
Biosystems, Applera Deutschland GmbH, Darmstadt,
Germany). PCRs were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer, using commercially available
assays-on-demand (Applied Biosystems, Applera Deutschland GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Ct values were calculated by the ABI PRISM software, and relative gene
expression levels were expressed as the difference in Ct
values of the target gene and the control gene ribosomal
protein S11(RPS11). RPS11 was selected as reference gene
for the quantification analyses, because the expression
levels of the gene were similar between the examined
tumor samples and normal tissue.
Classification using genetic programming
In order to generate a classifier that distinguishes between
AC, SCC and SCLC, as well as the normal lung tissue, a
Genetic Programming (GP) approach was used. The software DISCIPULUS which implements GP [26] was utilized. A leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was
performed, whereby one sample is removed from the
training set. The other samples are reduced to those 50
genes with the highest signal-to-noise ratio, which are
used as a training set in a training series. A training series
generates a number of classifiers. After each series, the 30
best resulting classifiers are applied to that sample
removed before, and the number of exact predictions were
counted. The procedure was iterated, so that every sample
was outside the training set once. The percentages of exact
predictions for all samples of a class using 1020 classifiers
(34 tissue samples and 30 classifiers = 34 * 30 = 1020 classifiers) were calculated. Each classifier used 50 different
genes of a sample, queried their expression values and
made the decision of "part of the class" or "outside the
class". For each classifier and LOOCV iteration, the frequency of a gene (how often a gene occurs as appropriate
classifier) was determined. The frequency was used as a
quality criterion. The 10 genes with the highest frequency
in each of the four classes were chosen in order to generate
a final classifier of 40 genes. The accuracy of correct classification of the tissue is calculated as percentage using 30
classifiers of all left-out samples.

Results
Expression profiles and hierarchical cluster analysis
In this study, we examined gene expression profiles of
untreated tumor cells from 29 patients with lung cancer
(10 adenocarcinomas, 10 squamous cell carcinomas, 9
small cell lung cancer) in comparison to 5 normal lung
tissues. The original data set and the patients characteristics are available in the GEO DATA base under http://

Comparing AC, SCC and SCLC to normal lung tissue
using significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), we
found 205, 335 and 404 genes with an at least 2-fold different expression level and an estimated false discovery
rate (FDR) of <2.6%. For an overview, a Venn diagram
shows the overlaps of the three among groups (Figure 1)
and the differentially expressed genes were further
grouped in 14 functional classes (Table 1). Following
SAM analysis, an unsupervised complete linkage clustering algorithm for cluster analyses was performed. The
closest pair of the highest expression values of 198 differentially expressed genes was grouped together and a clear
segregation of the analyzed groups (adenocarcinomas,
squamous cell carcinomas, small cell lung cancer and normal lung tissue) was obtained (Figure 2)
Adenocarcinomas
We found 205 deregulated genes in AC; 43 were upregulated and 162 were downregulated. Looking at oncogenes
and tumor-associated genes, only the paraneoplastic anti-

gen MA2 gene was upregulated. Focusing on genes
involved in cell structure, 7 genes were upregulated 2 to
7.9-fold, compared to normal lung tissue. Next to the
intermediary filament keratin 7 gene, 3 genes were
involved in the actin metabolism such as thymosin beta10, actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1B and
plastin 3. Four downregulated genes, involved in cell
structure, were found in AC compared to normal lung tissue. These genes were tubulin alpha 3 and beta 2 involved
in the assembly of microtubules and intermediary filaments, as well as keratin 5 and 15.
We also looked for genes involved in cell adhesion and
migration and found integrin alpha 3, integrin beta 2 and
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 to be upregulated in
adenocarcinomas, while 6 genes, including the desmosomal cadherins desmoglein 3 and desmocollin 3, were
significantly downregulated compared to normal lung tissue.
Examining the genes involved in cell cycle control and
proliferation, we found only 2 genes differentially
expressed. The chromosome condensation protein G was

box G1 were upregulated which has not been described in
the context of lung cancer so far.
In comparison to normal lung tissue, a different pattern of
cell adhesion molecules was found in SCLC, showing 8
genes up- and 7 genes downregulated between 2 to 12.8fold and 2.1 to 4.6-fold, respectively. In particular, the
neural cell adhesion molecule 1 and the neuronal cell
adhesion molecule, both members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, were overexpressed. Looking for genes
involved in cell cycle regulation, we found 56 genes upregulated between 2.1 to 5.1-fold compared to normal lung
tissue among them the key molecules for progression of
cell cycle, the cyclines A2 and B2, cyclin-dependent kinase
4 and the cell division cycle 2 genes and cyclin E. The
expression patterns of genes of the centromer/kinetochore
complex and genes involved in DNA repair were similar to
the expression patterns in SCC (Table 4).
Corroboration of array data by quantitative real-time (RT)
PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was used to verify the microarray
data for 13 genes found to be differentially regulated in
the different histologic lung cancer subgroups as compared to normal lung tissue. The 13 tested genes that were
selected from different functional classes, with focus on
the genes presented in tables 2–4, were: CASK (calcium/
calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase), CCNB2
(cyclin B2), COL1A1 (collagen, type I, alpha 1), IFNGR2
(interferon gamma receptor 2), PCNA (proliferating cell

nuclear antigen), PRKCI (protein kinase C, iota), PLS3
(plastin 3), PTTG1 (pituitary tumor-transforming 1),
PTTG1-IP (pituitary tumor-transforming 1 binding protein), UBE2C (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C),
MAGED4 (melanoma antigen family D 4), FOX (forkhead box G1) and FYN (FYN oncogene related to SRC)
and NRCAM (neuronal cell adhesion molecule). The
expression data generated by the oligonucleotide array
and RT-PCR were highly concordant, supporting the reliability of the array analysis (Figure 3). Of interest, the
pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 was 2.56 and 2.49fold significantly differentially expressed in SCLC and
SCC, respectively, in comparison to normal lung tissue
using microarray analysis. In AC, the difference of expression was not significant in microarray analysis. However,
using RT-PCR for corroboration, the pituitary tumortransforming gene 1 was 5.7, 8.0 and 8.3 overexpressed in
SCLC, SCC and AC, respectively, in comparison to normal
lung tissue. In a previously conducted immunohistochemical study, we have demonstrated a strong pituitary
tumor-transforming gene 1 expression in SCLC, adenocarcinomas, as well as in SCC, whilst a weak expression was
only found in the luminal layer of normal lung epithelia,
thus supporting the data of RT-PCR [27].
Class prediction using genetic programming
In order to identify genes that enable accurate distinction
between AC, SCC and SCLC, as well as normal lung tissue,
a genetic programming data analysis was performed. The
percentages of exact predictions for all samples of a class

SCLC = small cell lung cancer, NT = normal lung tissue

using 1020 classifiers (34 tissue samples and 30 classifiers
= 34 * 30 = 1020 classifiers) are shown in Table 5 and the
10 genes with the highest frequency in each of the four
classes were chosen in order to generate a final classifier of
40 genes. Using microarray training set of 34 samples (10
AC, 10 SCC, 9 SCLC and 5 normal lung tissues), a minimal set of 40 genes (Table 6) provided a classification
accuracy for division into the 4 different cell tissues. For
external validation, the test set included 13 different
NSCLC samples from pretreated patients (9 recurrent AC
and 4 recurrent SCC). All test set samples were correctly
classified using the 40 genes found with genetic programming.

Discussion
In this study, a comparison of the expression pattern of
the 3 major histological lung cancer subtypes, as meas-

ured by array analysis, is presented. In comparison to the
normal lung tissue, 205, 335 and 404 genes in AC, SCC
and SCLC were found to be at least 2-fold differentially
expressed. Fourteen genes of different gene families were
corroborated using RT-PCR.
In AC, we found an up-regulation of keratin 7, a characteristic finding for pathologists to diagnose this subtype of
lung cancer. On the other hand, keratin 5 was downregulated in AC. The differential expression is already
described as a separator between AC and SCC, in line with
our results [28,29]. Looking at adhesion molecules in AC,
a down-regulation of the desmosomes desmoglein 3 and
desmocollin 3 was found. In this context, it was shown
that the invasive behavior of cells is inhibited when transfected with desmosomal components [30], suggesting
that down-regulation of the desmosomes in adenocarci-

nomas of the lung plays a role in the loss of cell to cell
contact and tumor spreading.
The extracellular cell matrix receptors integrin alpha-3 and
integrin beta-2 as well as the collagen binding protein-1
(SERPHINH1) were upregulated in AC. These genes have
a high affinity to collagen IV and laminin, both essential
components of the basement membrane [31], possibly
mediating adhesion and invasion. Additionally, we found
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), a cell-adhesion molecule also binding to integrin beta-2 and promoting metastasis due to tumor cell adhesion to
endothelium overexpressed in AC [32,33].
Looking at the oncogenes in SCC, we found genes of the
RAS associated gene family, the myc myelocytomatosis
viral oncogene homolog (MYC) and musculoaponeurotic
fibrosarcoma oncogene (MAF) upregulated. MAF encodes
for nuclear transcriptional regulating proteins with a leucine zipper motif, and was identified in the genome of the
acute transforming avian retrovirus AS42, which induces
fibrosarcomas and has the ability to transform chicken
embryo fibroblasts [34].
It is noteworthy that in SCC 5 members of the collagen
family type I, V, VI, and XI were upregulated. An increased
collagen synthesis might be associated with carcinogenesis, as in patients with breast cancer the emerging fibrotic
focus is regarded as an indicator of tumor angiogenesis
and independent predictor of early metastasis [35].
SCLCs show an up-regulation of 3 proto-oncogenes,
which have not been described in this context so far. The
DEK oncogene encodes for a 375 amino acid chromatin
binding protein, which introduces supercoiling in DNA. It
has been described to be upregulated in other tumor
types, such as bladder cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma
and leukemia [36]. The Qin oncogene, originally isolated
from avian sarcoma virus, causes oncogenic transformation. Qin is the avian orthologue of mammalian brain factor-1 or forkhead box G1 (FOXG1B), a gene which
belongs to the human forkhead-box gene family [37].
Possibly related to the neuroendocrine differentiation of
SCLC, forkehead box G1 is essential for the proliferation
and survival of cerebro-cortical progenitor cells [38]. Further, we found the Fyn oncogene upregulated in SCLC.

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/6/1/69

Fyn is a member of the src family which is activated in
colorectal cancer, and has also been identified in
melanoma cells with elevated cell motility and spreading
ability [39,40].
With regard to adhesion molecules, the overexpressed
neural cell adhesion molecule 1 is useful for the diagnosis
of SCLC [41,42]. Next to neural cell adhesion molecule 1
we found other genes significantly upregulated such as the
Purkinje cell protein 4, secretory granule neuroendocrine
protein 1, synaptotagmin 1 and the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) that seems to reflect the neuronal heritage of this particular lung tumor subtype.
NRCAM belongs to the L1 family immunoglobulin-like
CAMs, which are involved in the guidance, growth and
fasciculation of neuronal cells [43]. Neuronal cell adhesion molecule has also been described in 2006 by Taniwaki and colleagues', who performed comprehensive
gene expression profiles of pure SCLC cells derived from
laser-microdissected tissue samples [44]. In order to confirm the overexpression of the neuronal cell adhesion
molecule using a different technique, we corroborated the
result of microarray analysis using RT-PCR, showing a 9.3fold overexpression of the neuronal cell adhesion molecule in SCLC in comparison to lung tissue.
The imbalance of activated oncogenes and lost tumor suppressor genes, found in different types of lung cancer, may
be associated with the different tumor growth kinetics.
SCLC is the fastest growing lung tumor with a median
tumor doubling time of 50 days [45]. This is reflected by
our data with regard to the number and strength of upregulated cell cycle genes affecting growth rate. Several
cyclines, their associated cyclin-dependent kinases and
cell division cycle (CDC) genes controlling cell cycle progression, such as cyclin A2, B2 and E2, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and 4, as well as cell division cycle 2, 20 and
25B were upregulated [46]. The activation level of different cell cycle genes may be relevant with regard to new
antitumor agents, which selectively target cell cycle proteins. For example, flavopiridol has the ability to induce
cell cycle arrest by binding and inhibiting different cyclindependent kinase such as 2 and 4 [47,48]. Both CDKs are
significantly upregulated in SCLC. On the other hand, the
upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2, that is critical
for cell entry and progression through S phase of the cell
cycle, is missing in NSCLC. Preclinical data support this
finding since most NSCLC cell lines are resistant to flavopiridol-induced apoptosis unless they were treated during S phase. Furthermore, the IC 50 of flavopiridol-treated
cells in SCLC cell lines is three times lower compared to
NSCLC cell lines [49]. Consequently, this drug might be
more promising in patients with SCLC.We have further
shown that genes involved in mismatch repair, such as
mutS homolog 2 or 6, were upregulated in SCLCs, which

is in line with other reports showing that these gene transcripts and proteins are present [50,51], in contrast to
NSCLCs, where high resolution deletion mapping reveals
frequent allelic losses at the DNA mismatch repair loci
mutS homolog 3 [52]. Similar to the latter report, we have
observed a downregulation of mutS homolog 3 in ACs.
After outlining potentially important molecular differences in different subtypes of lung cancer to normal lung
tissue, we were interested in defining how many and
which genes are necessary for correct classification of the
lung tumor subtype. Using genetic programming (GP), a
training set of 34 tissue samples was applied. With an evolutionary algorithm of GP, 40 genes were sufficient for a
correct discrimination between all lung tumor tissue types
and normal lung tissue. The 40 selected genes, identified
using GP, were a subset of the genes, which were previously identified to be differentially expressed using cluster
analysis. Following identification of the 40 genes with GP,
further 13 tissue samples of previously treated patients
NSCLC lung cancers were correctly classified with 100%

prediction accuracy. It is important to note that the samples of the training set were from treatment naïve patients,
while the test set came from those that were previously
treated for their cancer using platinum-based chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the presented genes for distinction
seem to maintain their value, independent from whether
or not the patient had been treated. However, caution
must be applied, since in the test set did not contain additional SCLC samples and larger sample size is needed
which includes samples from all lung cancer subtypes in
order to confirm the predictor.

Conclusion
Our data show the different gene expression profiles in
dependence from the histological type of lung cancer,
which reflects the specific biological characteristics of the
respective tumor subtype. These data may form the basis
for a molecular classification system and allows a further
insight into the altered genomic progress of the lung cancer cell, which may help to develop molecularly targeted
drugs.
