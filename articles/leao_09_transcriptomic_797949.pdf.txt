Abstract
Background: Micrurus corallinus (coral snake) is a tropical forest snake belonging to the family
Elapidae. Its venom shows a high neurotoxicity associated with pre- and post-synaptic toxins,
causing diaphragm paralysis, which may result in death. In spite of a relatively small incidence of
accidents, serum therapy is crucial for those bitten. However, the adequate production of
antiserum is hampered by the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of venom from a small snake
with demanding breeding conditions. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of this venom and
to uncover possible immunogens for an antiserum, we generated expressed sequences tags (ESTs)
from its venom glands and analyzed the transcriptomic profile. In addition, their immunogenicity
was tested using DNA immunization.
Results: A total of 1438 ESTs were generated and grouped into 611 clusters. Toxin transcripts
represented 46% of the total ESTs. The two main toxin classes consisted of three-finger toxins
(3FTx) (24%) and phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) (15%). However, 8 other classes of toxins were
present, including C-type lectins, natriuretic peptide precursors and even high-molecular mass
components such as metalloproteases and L-amino acid oxidases. Each class included an
assortment of isoforms, some showing evidence of alternative splicing and domain deletions. Five
antigenic candidates were selected (four 3FTx and one PLA2) and used for a preliminary study of
DNA immunization. The immunological response showed that the sera from the immunized
animals were able to recognize the recombinant antigens.
Conclusion: Besides an improvement in our knowledge of the composition of coral snake
venoms, which are very poorly known when compared to Old World elapids, the expression
profile suggests abundant and diversified components that may be used in future antiserum
formulation. As recombinant production of venom antigens frequently fails due to complex
disulfide arrangements, DNA immunization may be a viable alternative. In fact, the selected
candidates provided an initial evidence of the feasibility of this approach, which is less costly and
not dependent on the availability of the venom.

Background
The coral snake (genus Micrurus) is the most abundant,
diverse and representative member of the family Elapidae
in the New World. It has a wide geographic distribution
which covers the southwest United States, Central America, and southern Argentina [1]. Compared to the family
Viperidae, the numbers of accidents caused by the coral
snake are not great. Coral snakes are not aggressive and
only attack when threatened. Still, when an accident
occurs, the symptoms are usually severe, leading to death
by asphyxia after only 5 or 6 hours due to strong neurotoxic effects [2].
In Brazil, cases of envenoming by coral snakes are caused
mainly by Micrurus corallinus and Micrurus frontalis, species inhabiting in highly populated areas in the Central,
South and Southeast regions. Many of their characteristics, such as ophiophagous diet, fossorial habit and living
in tropical latitudes, make it difficult to obtain and keep
them in captivity. This limitation in maintenance, the
small size of their venom glands and, consequently, low
production of venom have been the major factors hindering the production of Brazilian anti-elapidic serum. Furthermore, the Butantan Institute, in Sao Paulo, utilizes
almost all of the venom obtained to produce the anti-elapidic serum, limiting biochemical studies [3]. In fact, the
quantity of venom available for the generation of serum is
not enough to supply the national needs. While the incidence of accidents is small when compared to that for
other genera, the wide geographic dispersion of Micrurus
and the lethality of its bite require the serum to be distributed all over the country, raising its demand.
Nowadays, the transcriptomic analysis of venom glands
to obtain a general profile of the toxins composing the
venom is a common experimental approach, applied
especially in snakes of the families Viperidae [4-8] and
Colubridae [9]. Nevertheless, there are no systematic transcriptome reports of this kind for the family Elapidae, neither from American coral snakes nor from African-Asian
species. Moreover, considering the difficulties in obtaining the venom even for antiserum production, a complete
set of the most abundant cDNAs from the venom glands
of coral snake species could open possibilities for alternative ways of immunization. One of them is the production
of recombinant proteins for immunization, which is an
obvious choice, since horse hyper-immunization
demands large amounts of proteins and requires robust
expression systems, such as those using E. coli. However,
prokaryotic systems fail to express complex disulfidebonded proteins, as in the case of snake toxins. Several of
our attempts to produce M. corallinus recombinant toxins
involved complicated refolding and eventually resulted in
time-consuming procedures [10,11]. A more elegant
approach is the DNA immunization with plasmids

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/112

expressing exogenous DNA in animal cells, thus stimulating immunological responses [12]. For snake toxins, Harrison and colleagues [13] produced high titers of
antibodies after DNA immunization using snake toxin
cDNAs, showing a potential systemic treatment of injuries
caused by Viperidae snake bites. They then immunized
mice with a synthetic chimeric DNA containing seven different epitopes from snake venom metalloproteases
expressed in the venom glands of the viper Echis ocellatus
[14].
The dataset of Micrurus corallinus transcriptome presented
here aims not only to describe the putative toxins
expressed by this sinuous Elapidae snake, but also to be a
source of potential antigens for an alternative production
of antiserum. Therefore, some cDNAs meeting eligible criteria, such as abundance, were selected and injected into
mice for a preliminary evaluation of their capacity to produce an immune response as DNA immunogens.

Results and Discussion
Transcriptomic analysis
The EST databank of M. corallinus contains 1438
sequences grouped into 611 clusters using CAP3 software
with 98% identity. Since the three-finger proteins (3FTx)
present in M. corallinus venom are very diverse and a few
substitutions of residues could change the clade in which
they are classified, some of the clusters were inspected and
manually regrouped to avoid joining different EST products in the same cluster.

The 611 clusters of contiguous sequences include 483
formed by individual clones (singlets) and 128 clusters
with two or more sequences (contigs). After the application of a filter against sequences of ribosomal RNA, mitochondrial DNA and other contaminants, 5% of the clones
were removed for the subsequent statistical analysis.
The analysis using Blast revealed that 485 clusters (corresponding to 1250 clones, or 92% of the total) produced
significant similarities with the database (e-value < 10-05),
and that 103 clusters (107 clones or 8% of total) could
not be identified. The information obtained was separated into two general functions of venom gland transcripts: toxins (toxic functions) and other transcripts
involved in all cellular functions (non-toxins). Toxin transcripts totaled 46% of all clones in 93 clusters. Non-toxins
also totaled 46% of all clones but in 392 clusters. Therefore, the non-toxins are less redundant (1.6 clone/cluster)
than toxins (6.7 clones/cluster), which means that each
toxin is, on average, four times more transcribed than a
cellular transcript.
Among the 10 particular types of toxins observed (Figure
1), three-finger proteins (3FTx) are the most abundant

transcripts, followed by type A2 phospholipase (PLA2). In
smaller numbers are the C-type lectins and the precursor
of natriuretic peptide (NP). The other classes of toxins are
less abundant. The profile of putative cellular proteins
(Figure 1, left) showed a pattern expected from a secretory
gland. The most expressed of these transcripts are related
to mRNA transcription and protein translation.
Analysis of the putative toxins
Three-Finger Toxins (3FTx)
The 3FTx are the most abundant group of possible toxins,
comprising the majority of expressed sequences (~52% of
the total toxin clones). These proteins are small, with less
than 80 amino acids and generally have four or five
disulfide bonds. They have very different pharmacological
effects, but are generally associated with post-synaptic
blockade.

The analysis of the 3FTx revealed that 326 clones (~24%
of total) could be grouped into 55 clusters. Many clusters
had to be recreated manually after the initial grouping
made by the CAP3 program, because it was noted that
some initial contigs were actually grouping different variants. Therefore, each initial contig was inspected to identify the SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) common to
more than one sequence in the contig. When these com-

mon SNPs were found, the quality of their base pairs at
each point was evaluated, and the respective sequences
were removed and rearranged in a new cluster. It was not
possible to determine if a single animal shows all these
isoforms or if they are expressed by distinct animals, since
the cDNA library was constructed using 10 coral snakes.
It is not an easy task to classify this kind of toxins based
on their sequences, since they are short proteins subjected
to high evolutionary pressures, resulting in extreme diversity [15], leaving conserved only the cysteines and some
particular features such as the size of the C-terminal
region [16]. The many attempts to group them usually
resulted in orphan groups that mostly do not reflect their
known activities. Besides that, since only few cDNAs are
known from Micrurus, it is even more complicated to
identify the possible functions of the toxins based on
orthologs in other species. Therefore, we opted to group
these toxins according to the similarity among themselves
and their relative abundances (Figure 2) and [see Additional file 1].
Two groups are much more abundant than the rest, representing the majority of the 3FTx (Figure 2). Both contain
sequences that are very similar to α-neurotoxin isoforms
previously described in Micrurus corallinus [3]. The first

group, named here Atg1 (selected as antigen 1, as discussed later), was similar to a cDNA called neurotoxin
homolog 8 (nxh8), previously isolated by Ho et al.
(1995), which is a peculiar form that differs from most
3FTx. After a 21-amino acid signal peptide, the mature
form consists of 65 amino acids, along with the possible
presence of an extra disulfide bond in the first loop. Most
short 3FTx have only four very conserved disulfide bridges
but few unrelated toxins show this extra pair of cysteines
(Figure 2). The second group, named Atg2 (selected as
antigen 2, as discussed later), refers to more typical 3FTx,
the neurotoxin homologs 7/3/1 (nxh7, nxh3, nxh1
cDNAs), as previously described [17]. Some of the clusters
showed differences in the signal peptide region and some
amino acids in the mature protein region. The mature protein consists of 57 amino acids. Comparing these two
groups, Atg1 displays just 42% similarity with the Atg2
group. The rest of the 3FTx, some of them also highly transcribed, represent new proteins with an identity value of
no more than 50% to the sequences of 3FTx in the databanks (Figure 2).
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
With 120 amino acids and 6 or 7 disulfide bonds, PLA2 are
ubiquitous enzymes in venoms, composed of alpha-helix
and some beta-sheet structures [18]. Some PLA2s are presynaptic neurotoxins or β-neurotoxins with specific targets in neuromuscular junctions [19], promoting an inhibition in the release of neuromediators. Some others act

like a myotoxin that depolarizes muscular cell membranes[20], leading to necrosis. PLA2 may exert neurotoxic
actions by binding to nerve cell membranes and catalyzing phospholipid hydrolysis, with the production of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids [21].
The most abundant cluster obtained was MCOR0036C,
with 196 clones. This cluster shows 100% identity with
the PLA2 sequence of Micrurus corallinus from the database
(AY157830). This PLA2 was expressed in E. coli and immunologically characterized [11]. It has, in position 49, one
aspartate (Asp49) intimately involved in Ca2+ binding,
having an essential function in the catalytic activity of this
enzyme. This residue is highly conserved in catalytically
functional PLA2, but in many Viperidae myotoxic PLA2s,
it is substituted by a lysine residue (Lys49) [22]. No such
latter form was detected in this transcriptome.
It was interesting to note that the singlet cluster
MCOR0404S, shows a peculiar sequence due to a 114-bp
insertion in position 110, within the mature protein (Figure 3). Comparing the sequence of this insertion against
databases, it is possible to see that it corresponds to the
last 114 bp of the fourth intron of some elapidic PLA2
genes, such as that from Laticauda semifasciata [23]. These
introns 4 of PLA2s usually have around 500 bp, but only
114 bp are present in the insertion of MCOR0404S cDNA.
Assuming a conserved gene structure of PLA2 genes among
species, this insertion may represent possible incomplete

splicing of the transcript, since a 3' portion of the intron
remained attached to the mRNA. In fact, the insertion
starts with the dinucleotide GT and ends with AG, precisely the canonic sequence for intron/exon junctions
(Figure 3). Besides, the insertion of 114 bp is a multiple of
3, and hence, it corresponds to 38 codons (without stop
codons). This allows, after the insertion, the continuity of
the reading frame, keeping the original C-terminal region.
Although this insertion could originate from a random
mistake in the splicing process, the absence of stop
codons or cysteine residues (which would destabilize the
structure) and the fact that it keeps the translational phase
are indicative that it could result in a new protein product.
Nevertheless, the analysis of the inserted amino acid
sequence does not display similarity with any known
domain. This is another example of indels frequently
observed in toxin cDNAs [24].
C-type Lectins
C-type lectins are non-enzymatic proteins present in the
venom of snakes of all families. Like plant lectins, some of
the venom lectins are able to bind to carbohydrates. In the
presence of Ca2+, the C-type lectins begin several biological processes, such as adhesion, agglutination, endocytosis and neutralization of the pathogen. The lectins could
be divided into seven different groups according to their
structural characteristics [25]. The C-type lectins that have
lost their capability of binding to carbohydrates are called
lectin-like, because they still maintain the structural characteristics in common with true lectins. Venom lectins
may act as agonists or sometimes antagonists in platelet
aggregation and affect thrombosis and homeostasis by
activating and inhibiting specific receptors in platelet
membranes [26].

The C-type lectins found here were also abundant toxins.
Sixty-five clones show similarity with these proteins and
were grouped into 13 clusters, representing approximately
5% of the total transcripts expressed in the tissue. Many of
the clusters correspond to full-lengths ORFs that could be
aligned with other C-type lectins from venom [see Additional file 2].
C-type lectins are ubiquitous components of the venom,
but are very diversified in structure-function terms, and
thus, it is interesting to understand how the C-type lectins
from M. corallinus fit in the phylogeny of lectins. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis revealed that the proteins of
snake venom set in a unique group, distinct from the animal physiologic lectins [see Additional file 2]. Within the
group of venom lectins, it is possible to see a clear distinction between the true C-type lectins (carbohydrate-binding) and their structural homologs, the lectin-like
(probabilities 0.81 and 1.0, respectively). All the M. corallinus lectins are arranged inside the true C-type lectin
group, together with the other elapids lectins. The only
exception is the cluster MCOR0067C (clearly distinct
from the others in alignment), which is more similar, in
terms of identity, to the short physiologic proteins related
to lithostatin than to the venom lectins (true or not).
Recently, the same kind of sequence was observed in the
B. insularis transcriptome (BINS0004C). Thus, the finding
of another lectin with those characteristics supports the
possibility that this lectin could be a third group of venom
lectins or that it has a specialized function in the venom
gland.
For the organization inside the branch of true lectins, the
majority of clusters are grouped together with the lectin of

Lapemis hardwick, an elapid of the Hydrophiinae subfamily
(sea snakes). Only one cluster, MCOR0090C, is grouped
with the real lectins of other elapids and viperids. Either
way, these components seem to be well diversified in M.
corallinus.
Natriuretic Peptide (NP)
NPs have been described in snake venoms, where their
precursors are organized in different ways. In the Elapidae, a 110- to 140-amino acid ORF contains a signal peptide, a short propeptide and the NP with a C-terminal
extension resembling that of vertebrate atrial and brain
NPs (A/BNPs) [27]. In contrast, in the Viperidae (Crotalinae subfamily), the precursor is a more complex molecule
with a 180- to 270-amino acid ORF containing a signal
peptide, a region with a variable number of the pharmacologically relevant bradykinin-potentiating peptides
(BPPs) (from one to seven in different snake species) followed by a long intervening linker sequence and the Ctype NP (CNP), without a C-terminal extension [28]. In
the venom of the dipsadid snake Philodryas olfersii, it is
similar to the Viperidae BPP/CNP precursor, including the
signal peptide, the linker and the CNP (without C-terminal extension), but lacking the entire BPPs region [9]. The
BPPs are important inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme that served as basis for the design of the antihypertensive drug captopril.

Here we found 5 clusters, totaling 14 clones. The cDNA
representing the cluster MCOR0001C (6 clones) is very
similar to the one previously characterized [27], except for
the absence of the extra cysteine observed in that cDNA.
In fact, resequencing the original clone from Ho and colleagues, it was clear that the sequence described earlier
was incorrect (data not shown), and that the correct one
corresponds to that of the MCOR0001C cluster. All the
natriuretic peptides described represent a structural ring
with 17 amino acids formed by an expanding disulfide
bond with a few amino acids in the N-terminal. In the Cterminal region, the type B and C of mammalian NPs have
4 to 7 amino acids. The natriuretic peptide of M. corallinus
has some peculiarities: a) the peptide has an unusually
longer C-terminal extension; and b) this possible natriuretic peptide is flanked by 2 homologous regions with
unknown function [27].
Besides this archetypal type, three other clusters
(MCOR019C, MCOR0193S and MCOR0195S) show a
deletion of 237 bp relative to MCOR0001C, resulting in
the absence of 79 amino acids (Figure 4). The reading
frame is maintained after the deletion and the resulting
polypeptide has a signal peptide, part of the pro-domain,
including one part of the repeated region, and the rest of
the C-terminal. Therefore, the deleted section corresponds
to mature NP and part of the flanking region. Unlike the
insertion in the cDNA of PLA2 (Figure 3), the deleted sec-

tion does not follow the GT-AG rule of splicing and, therefore, does not seem to be derived from an alternative
splicing. Besides that, some clusters (MCOR0195S and
MCOR0551S) still show insertions corresponding to four
residues (VH/NPE) next to the C-terminal end.

be more similar to the inhibitors than to the neurotoxins,
matching several Viperidae inhibitors, although the
degree of conservation between these two types is low,
and further analysis is needed in order to define their exact
function.

It is difficult to determine the importance of such molecule that is abundant, with part of the pro-domain and the
C-terminal end, but not showing the NP. One clue could
be the presence, even in the deleted form, of one of the
repetitive regions, which has been suggested to have typical elements of active biological peptides [27]. This precursor may be chosen to produce a new peptide based on
this segment. It is interesting to note that the BPPs/CNPs
precursors, whose structures have been known for a while,
are now revealing new active peptides in their pro-peptide
regions. Graham and colleagues, in 2005 [29], found
bradykinin inhibitory peptides in the same precursor of
the BPPs. Recently, Wagstaff and colleagues described that
the conserved spacing region from some precursors generates peptides (EKW) capable of inhibiting the metalloprotease in the same venom, in a supposed mechanism of
protection against proteolysis in the gland [30].

Metalloproteases
Venom metalloproteases are normally grouped according
to the presence of a specific domain. All of them have a
proteolytic domain characterized by the presence of a catalytic site conserving the motif HEXXHXXGXXH, responsible for the binding of a metal ion, generally Zn2+. After
the catalytic domain, there may be a disintegrin domain,
capable of binding to platelet integrins or to endothelial
cells. This region could contain the RGD motif (RGD disintegrins) or have its sequence changed to another, such
as ECD (non-RGD disintegrins), which would change its
specificity. The C-terminal region of non-RGD disintegrins could also have a cysteine-rich domain with
unknown function. These enzymes are very abundant in
the family Viperidae but are not so common and diversified in the Elapidae.

L-Amino Acid Oxidase
These are larger enzymes of 58 kDa and act basically on Lamino acids, converting them to keto acids and generating
H2O2, which seems to contribute to the inhibition of
platelet aggregation and to cause cellular injury [31]. It
was not possible to obtain a full-length clone from our
dataset, probably due to the very long cDNA (2.8 kb) [32].
Two clusters, MCOR0200S and MCOR0263S, each one
containing just one clone (singlet), were found in the M.
corallinus databank. L-amino acid oxidase has already
been reported in elapids (ex.: AAY89682), but not in
Micrurus.
Kunitz Inhibitors
In snake venoms, the scaffold of Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors occurs as two functionally distinct molecules: the non-neurotoxic serine protease inhibitor, and
the neurotoxic ones, also called dendrotoxins, lacking
major inhibitory action on proteases. The former ones are
capable of inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin, being
common in both the Viperidae and Elapidae [33]. The
dendrotoxins are present in the venom of some elapids
[34], such as the black mamba (Dendroaspis) and the kraits
(Bungarus). They exert their toxic action by increasing the
release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, from
pre-synaptic membranes of cholinergic synapses. The specific targets of dendrotoxins are high-voltage-activated
Ca2+ channels (L-, N-, and P-type) in neuronal cell membranes, which are blocked [35].

Two low expressed clusters, MCOR0110C and
MCOR0611S, were found in this database. Both seem to

The metalloprotease found here is represented by one partial cluster, MCOR0063C, containing just 4 clones (1123
bp). It is similar to cobrin found in Naja naja, a species of
the family Elapidae from the Old World. It is an example
of a P-III type of metalloprotease, i.e., the sequence shows
a non-RGD disintegrin type followed by a cysteine-rich
domain [36].
Serine Proteases
Snake venom serine proteases act on elements of the coagulation cascade and are believed to occur as trypsin-like
enzymes, widely described in the Viperidae, or as the
more complex factor X-like proteins found in some terrestrial Elapidae [37]. Recently, some trypsin-like enzymes
were described in the Elapidae, e.g., ABN72544, showing
that the factor X-like is not the only serine protease fold in
this family.

In the transcriptome of M. corallinus, we did not find
either type, but only a partial singlet cluster
(MCOR0160S), showing more similarity to non-venom
serine proteases from mammals (~52% identity), than to
snake ones (~39%). The main hits are with prostasins
from basal mammals such as platypus (Monotremata) and
opossum (Metatheria). This is a channel-activating protease involved in the growth of epithelial cells. The portion matching MCOR0160S corresponds to a part of the
peptidase S1 domain, indicating that proteolytic activity
should be present. Since the sequence is partial, it is not
possible to define the presence of extra domains, such as
the transmembrane or the propeptide C-terminal end.
Due to the ubiquitous presence of serine protease in snake
venoms, we include this one among the possible toxins

from M. corallinus, although further confirmation is still
needed.
NGF
Like their homologs in mammals, responsible for regulating neuronal differentiation, NGFs (neurotrophic factor
family) of venom act as low potential agonists of TrkA
receptors (tyrosine-kinase), competing with endogenous
NGF in binding to the receptor and influencing the development of cholinergic neurons. Besides inducing a typical
growth of fibers in cell culture, snake venom and human
NGFs also exhibit non-neuronal effects, such as the induction of plasma overflow or the release of histamines from
blood cells [38]. The effect of these factors in envenoming
probably renders the bite site more susceptible to other
components of the venom and distribute the substances
that are difficult to infiltrate the target tissue [39].

This component was also found in our library, although
less abundant than in other transcriptomes. Probably due
to the length of the sequence, the only cluster obtained
(MCOR0149S) is partial.
WAP
WAP proteins (whey acidic proteins), or waprin or nawaprin (described first in Naja nigrocollis), play a possible
role as a protease inhibitor. It is similar to elafin (elastase
inhibitor of human leukocytes), clatrin-like (calcium
transport inhibitor) and other extra cellular protease
inhibitors [40]. The WAP domain generally consists of 50
amino acid residues, with 8 conserved cysteine residues
forming 4 disulfide bridges. Although the cysteines residues are conserved, the inter-cysteine segments are totally
different from those of other WAP family members.
Among the ESTs of M. corallinus, we obtained only one
cluster, MCOR0526S, containing just one clone coding
for a WAP protein. It is a partial sequence without signal
peptide and part of the mature protein.
General considerations on M. corallinus transcriptome
Whereas other snake families have been well investigated
through the transcriptomic approach, Elapidae cDNA
sequences were obtained only from timely cloning efforts.
The toxins in the M. corallinus transcriptome presented
here represent approximately 46% (625 clones grouped in
93 clusters) of all the information. This very high expression of a functionally related group of protein is expected
since this tissue is specialized in toxin synthesis, and is
similar to the results observed from other snake families
such as the Viperidae [5-7] and Colubridae [9].

The general profile of toxins revealed a complex diversity
of toxins (10 different classes of toxins). Protein profiles
of Micrurus venoms (e.g., [10,41]) usually show a large
number of proteins of around 6–24 kDa (mainly 3FTx

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/112

with various activities and PLA2) with minor bands at
higher molecular mass. Although PLA2 and 3FTx make up
the vast majority of ESTs, 8 other classes were found,
including proteins with a predicted higher molecular
mass. All these classes have been previously observed in at
least one species of the Elapidae, but as far as we know,
not in the same species or genus. Olamendi-Portugal and
colleagues [41] investigated the proteome set of a Central
America coral snake (Micrurus surinamensis) and found
that the main group of toxins corresponded to 3FTx. However, they also identified PLA2, other low-molecular mass
proteins and L-amino acid oxidase. Together, these data
suggest that the complexity of venom components in
Micrurus is readily comparable with that of the family
Viperidae. Of course, other datasets are needed to extrapolate these Micrurus profiles.
Nevertheless, the neurotoxic action of pre- and post-synaptic toxins still predominate. Considering this action, M.
corallinus venom is frequently compared and contrasted
with that of M. frontalis, because both are the major species in terms of occurrence and accidents in Brazil, but the
latter shows an almost exclusively post-synaptic venom,
whereas the former has both pharmacological actions [2].
The presence of elevated levels of PLA2 messengers in M.
corallinus, almost equal to the 3FTx levels, is in agreement
with this, suggesting that the responsibility for this action
may be associated with the level of this component.
Unfortunately, we still do not have the M. frontallis transcriptome data in order to compare them.
Besides the existence of diverse classes of toxins, it is worth
noting the large number of different cDNAs in each class.
3FTx, for example, are represented by 52 differently
assembled cDNAs. It is true that many forms may result
from the assembly of non-overlapping segments or correspond to cDNAs with few nucleotide polymorphisms
(with many silent substitutions), which may be associated
with individual variation resulting from the pool of the
venom glands used. Nevertheless, exclusively considering
the amino acid sequences from the full-length 3FTx, 10 of
the 28 full-length 3FTx proteins observed are less than
80% conserved relative to any other, and 7 of them are
less than 50% conserved relative to any other. If we
exclude the signal peptide from the analysis, percentages
are obtained that reflect even more diversity. This indicates the great variability of these sequences in a single
species. It is surprising that a species with a very specialized diet (feeding mainly on other small snakes) shows
this diversity. However, in the proteome of M. surinamensi
various subtypes of 3FTx are present. Five of the most
abundant, including short- and long-chain 3FTx, were
functionally characterized and shown to be acetylcholine
receptor with different affinities and peculiar specificities.
M. surinamensi is also a diet specialist, feeding on fish, but

many of their toxins seem to be active also in mammals
[41]. In a family of short toxins subjected to high evolutionary pressures on structure-function relationships, this
may represent very different kinds of activities, such as
several receptor specificities.
Identification of putative antigenic candidates
Considering the problems in the production of M. corallinus antiserum for humans due to the difficulties in obtaining its venom, alternative ways to obtain their antigens are
important. The direct use of M. corallinus recombinant
proteins as immunogens have been tested before [10,11]
and although they were shown to produce immune
responses indicating the recognition of the native proteins, very complicated steps were required for protein
refolding and to obtain active toxins. Therefore, we
decided to evaluate the feasibility of using cDNAs derived
from this transcriptome initiative as immunogens for producing an antiserum. By analyzing the dataset, we confirmed the predominant toxins in this venom and
suggested some proteins that could represent good antigenic candidates.

The proposed candidates should code for proteins that are
abundant in the venom. Since 3FTx and PLA2 account for
85% of toxin ESTs, they were chosen for this first evaluation of immune response through DNA immunization.
The 3FTx candidates were selected based on the abundance of each transcript, with aim of choosing the toxins
that would be abundant in the venom. Among them, we
considered only the most divergent forms, indicated by a
neighbor-joining tree, avoiding the selection of closely
related isoforms. Thus, we aimed to select diverse abundant (potentially important) cDNAs of 3FTx, which are
the major toxins, and one representative of PLA2, rather
than to choose the most immunogenic ones, as used elsewhere [14].
The 35 clusters of 3FTx with full length sequences were
aligned and self-compared, giving rise to groups of clusters showing more similarity (Figure 2) [see Additional
file 1]. One group containing 5 clusters and 45 clones was
represented by MCOR0604C, here named Atg1, and is
similar to the nxh8 (AJ344067). The second group (Atg2)
is the most abundant 3FTx set, containing 117 clones, represented by the MCOR0599C cluster, which is similar to
the neurotoxin homologs 7/3/1 (nxh1, nxh3, nxh7).
Among the remaining 3FTx, two subgroups were defined:
Atg3 included 29 clones (represented by the MCOR0039C
cluster) and Atg4 had 27 clones (represented by the
MCOR0100C cluster).
The obvious fifth candidate (Atg5) was the MCOR0036C
cluster, representing the most abundant cluster obtained
(196 clones), corresponding to the putative M. corallinus
PLA2.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/112

DNA immunization and immune response
The five selected candidates were subcloned in the mammalian vector, pSecTag2A and the DNA injected in mice.
In parallel, some constructions of the same cDNAs cloned
in prokaryotic expression systems were used to produce
recombinant antigens (data not shown) for the evaluation
of the antisera.

In order to determine if the DNA immunizations would
be capable of generating an immunological response to
the proposed 3FTx candidates, ELISA tests were performed
using the anti-sera raised from DNA immunization with
Atg1 and Atg2 to recognize the respective recombinant
proteins. The results are presented in Figure 5, where it is
possible to see a much stronger recognition of the recombinant proteins by the immune sera than by the preimmune one. The highest titers were obtained for Atg2
(1:10240) and then Atg1 (1:5120). These results indicate
that there were differences between the production of
antibodies in all three candidates. Besides the ELISA tests,
immunodetection by Western blotting was performed
(inserts in Figure 5). In this case, the recombinant proteins
could also be recognized by their respective sera, Atg1 and
Atg2. The two tests indicate that the 3Ftx candidates produced antibody titers with DNA immunization in mice.
However, the amplitudes of the responses were quite low,
reaching optical density values ranging from 0.25 to 0.5.
To evaluate the antiserum raised against the two other
3FTx antigens, ELISA plates were coated with the 3FTx
recombinant proteins available (Atg1 and Atg2) and
exposed to the sera obtained from Atg3 and Atg4 DNA
immunization. Therefore, a positive response would indicate that there is cross reaction between the selected antigenic candidates. In this test, the sera of mice immunized
with Atg3 or Atg4 showed better recognition of the recombinant proteins corresponding to Atg2 than those corresponding to the Atg1 [see Additional file 3]. This indicates
that Atg1 has less conserved epitopes with the other antigens analyzed, which is in accordance with its sequence
properties that showed MCOR0604C (nxh8) as a truly
distinctive type of 3FTx. Besides, the low cross-reaction titers even with the most conserved Atg2 suggests that the
distinct 3FTx isoforms selected, alone, may not elicit a
response sufficient to neutralize the venom. For this reason, a set of these toxins should be used together to ensure
complete protection.
The immunological response against Atg5 (PLA2) only
showed low reaction titers (1:160), but was also capable
of recognizing the recombinant proteins in Western blots
(Figure 5).
Atg1, Atg2 and Atg5 DNA were then co-administered in
mice and the serum tested against the respective recombinant proteins and against crude venom from M. coralliPage 9 of 14

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/112

against recombinant proteins. Meanwhile, the venom was
poorly recognized by these sera in ELISA. Perhaps, optimizing the immunization strategy would improve the recognition. For practical reasons, in this first evaluation we
utilized here a simple intra-muscular protocol, by injecting
the DNA in mice in their anterior tibia muscle or quadriceps. Epidermal injection should improve the immune
response, as previously demonstrated [42], particularly if
associated with biobalistic protocols. This procedure has
already been shown in several studies to be the most efficient to induce an immunological response of the Th2
type (IL-4, IL-5, IL10), efficient to generate more antibodies, which is desirable for hyperimmune serum production. Nevertheless, the reaction titers of anti-toxin sera are
not directly related to its efficiency; if some important
epitopes were neutralized, the general toxicity of the
venom could be blocked even with low-titer serum, as
clearly shown before [14].

nus (Figure 6). The best recognition was seen with Atg2
(1:5120), followed by Atg1 (1:320), Atg5 (1:120) and M.
corallinus venom (1:120).
Therefore, our results indicate that immunization with
DNA is able to generate an immunological response

Years of DNA immunization studies have shown that,
unlike with inactivated antigen vaccines or subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines result in an antigenic presentation
via MHC class I and MHC class II molecules, which mimics the resulting process of natural infection to activate T
lymphocytes CD4+, CD8+ and the production of antibodies. The different types of induced immunological
response for DNA administration clearly justify their
application in the infectious disease field [11]. The question is how to derive this specific answer for the purpose
of generating a hyperimmune serum, and less cellular protection. Some attempts to achieve this objective are in
progress. Besides the few DNA immunization works referring to snake toxins, some efforts are being made to investigate the generation of hyperimmune serum against
bacterial or viral diseases. Fischer and colleagues in 2003
[43], for example, using a cationic lipid composition
together with DNA, generated reasonable titers of antibodies against rabies virus in horses. Herrmann and colleagues in 2006 [44] were capable to produce an
antiserum in rabbits against anthrax that was capable of
neutralizing the deleterious effects of the Bacillus anthracis
toxin. Thus, quoting Harrison et al., 2000, [42]: "The
application of DNA-based methodologies to the development of therapeutic antivenom represents the first major
conceptual change in antivenom production in over a
century and has the potential to provide a more cost-effective, less hazardous and more immunologically specific
therapy than those used currently to treat envenoming by
snakes"

Conclusion
The transcriptome analysis of M. corallinus provides a
large profile of Elapidae toxin cDNAs. Ten classes of possible toxins were found, representing a great diversity of
toxins for a venom believed to be almost exclusively neu-

rotoxic. Nevertheless, the possible neurotoxins (3FTx and
PLA2) are in fact the majority, totaling 85% of toxin transcripts. The possible post-synaptic components (3FTx) are
very diverse in terms of sequences, possibly aiming to
achieve different kinds of receptors. The pre-synaptic component (PLA2), in contrast, is more conserved, with the
main transcript being represented by 196 of the 1438 ESTs
analyzed here. Nevertheless, the high expression of both
types of possible neurotoxins is in agreement with the
known presence of pre- and post-synaptic activities in the
venom of this species.
From a biotechnological point of view, this transcriptome
set represents a library of naturally selected templates,
especially for molecules acting on nicotinic receptors or
ion channels which may be useful for pharmacological
purposes. Regarding envenomation treatment, the utilization of genetic immunization based on the survey of transcriptome data carried out here was shown to be feasible

for generating immune responses, although more optimization is still needed. Although far from therapeutic application, these findings represent the first steps in the
production of an alternative anti-M. corallinus venom
serum.

Methods
cDNA library preparation
Two cDNA libraries were constructed in 1992, with RNA
poli(A+) extracted from 10 specimens of M. corallinus [27].
The cDNAs were divided in two fractions (400 to 600 bp
and >600 bp) and the transcripts were linked to λgt11D
(Pharmacia, USA) pre-digested phage with EcoRI/NotI
restriction enzymes. The phage library was amplified after
infection in E. coli Y1088.

To isolate bacteriophage plaques, first a colony of E. coli
Y1088 was inoculated in 5 mL of NZCYM culture media
containing 0.2% of maltose [45]. After the addiction of

Page 11 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:112

0.01 M MgSO4, the absorbance was accomplished until
reaching 2.0 and then kept at 4°C. Dilutions of phage
libraries were mixed with 100 μL of this E. coli Y1088
preparation and incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C.
NZCYM culture media containing top agarose (0.7% agarose) was then added to the mixture and it was distributed
over a bottom agar (1.5% agar) plate prepared with
NZCYM culture media. After 12–16 hours at 37°C, the
phage plaques were ready to be isolated.
Amplification of phage cDNA insert by PCR and DNA
sequencing
Each lytic colony was collected using a Pasteur pipette tip
and inserted into a microcentrifuge tube containing 200
μl of SM media [45]. After 1 hour of incubation with agitation at room temperature, 10 μl of this solution was
used to amplify the cDNA inserted in the genetic material
of each phage with Taq polymerase enzyme (Platinum
Taq DNA Polymerase – Invitrogen) and λgt11F and R
primers by PCR, in a 96 well plate. Eight microliters of the
amplified product was then chemically cleaned by the
addition of 5 units of Exonuclease I (GE Healthcare), 1
unit of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP) (GE Healthcare) for 1 hour at 37°C and then inactivated for 15 minutes at 80°C. From the purified PCR product, 300 ng was
sequenced with BigDye2 dideoxy-terminators (Applied
Biosystems) and λgt11F primer on an ABI 3100
sequencer.
Cluster assembly and identification
After sequencing the DNA, the electropherogram files
were analyzed in a semi-automatic way, as described [5].
The Phred program was used http://www.phrap.com to
remove bad quality sequences (window length of 75 bases
with 75% of standard quality < 25). Then, adapter and
phage sequences were removed by the CrossMatch Program. An examination was carried out manually and
sequences below 150 bp were discarded. ESTs were then
assembled in clusters of contiguous sequences using the
CAP3 program [46], set for 98% or more of base identity
in a high-quality region. The cluster sequences were
searched in the GeneBank NCBI database with BLASTX
and BLASTN algorithms. Non-identified sequences and
those with unpredicted function were checked for the
presence of signal peptide by SignalP 3.0 program http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/. A final annotation
table was generated in Microsoft Excel format containing
all the relevant information about clusters. ESTs
sequences were deposited in Genbank dbEST under accession numbers FL589790 to FL591230.
Antigenic candidates selection, cloning and immunization
Five cDNAs were selected after an analysis of the Micrurus
corallinus transcriptomic databank and named Atg1 to
Atg5 (Antigens 1 to 5), as described in the Results. Specific
oligos were drawn for each antigenic candidate. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/112

mature protein region was amplified by PCR and cloned,
first, in pGEM-T vector, then digested and subcloned in
the eukaryotic expression vector, pSecTag2A (Invitrogen).
This vector allows the secretion of the protein to the
medium due to the secretion signal from the kappa chain
of immunoglobulins. The expressed protein also contains
some tags like a poly-histidine (His) and the myc epitopes
(c-myc). To obtain the large amount of DNA needed for
the immunization process, maxipreps were made with the
Qiagen Plasmid Purification kit (Qiagen). They were then
quantified and its purity was determined (OD 260/280)
by spectrophotometry.
The DNA immunization of the candidates was made in
five groups of BALB/c mice, females of homogenous
weight (18–22 g) and age (6–8 weeks old). The experiments in animals was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Butantan Institute, under protocol 258/06, according
to international guidelines. Each group of five animals
was immunized with an antigenic candidate. The animals
were anesthetized i.p. with approximately 200 μL of anesthetic (ketamine 500 μL/10 mL and xilazine 1000 μL/10
mL). The injection of the DNA vaccine was intramuscular
(IM). Each animal received 100 μg of DNA per dose and
one dose every 15 days for a total of three doses (300 μg/
animal). The same procedure was used to immunize a
group of five animals with a pool of three immunogens
(33 μg of Atg1, 33 μg of Atg2 and 33 μg of Atg5 per dose).
Immune response analysis
Mice were bled individually from the retro-orbital plexus
to detect antibodies in the blood through ELISA (Enzymelinked Immunosorbent Assay). An initial bleeding was
done before the immunizations, in order to obtain the
pre-immune serum and the final bleeding was made after
the third dose. Recombinant proteins from 3 of the 5 candidates (Atg1, Atg2, Atg5) were produced in E. coli, as His
tagged fusion proteins, and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, as described previously [10,11]. These proteins (1 μg) were used for the ELISA coating in NaHCO3
and Na2CO3 0,05 M pH 9,6 buffer. After blocking it with
10% milk in PBS, dilutions of the sera were prepared in
ranges from 1:20 to 1:10240 and incubated during 1.5
hour with a 1% BSA + 0.1% PBS-T solution, in 37°C. The
plates were then incubated with a secondary antibody,
IgG anti-mouse conjugated with peroxidase for 1 hour in
37°C and revealed with 100 μl of 0.4 mg/ml OPD (ortofenilenodiamine), 0.05% H2O2 in citrate-phosphate buffer
(0.1 M citric acid + 0.2 M sodium phosphate). The reaction was blocked with the addition of 50 μl of 8N H2SO4
after 15 minutes. The experiments were realized in triplicates.
