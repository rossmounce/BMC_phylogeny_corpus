Abstract
Background: Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs) are important factors in the plasticity of
microbial genomes. An element related to the ICE Tn4371 was discovered during a bioinformatic
search of the Ralstonia pickettii 12J genome. This element was analysed and further searches carried
out for additional elements.
A PCR method was designed to detect and characterise new elements of this type based on this
scaffold and a culture collection of fifty-eight Ralstonia pickettii and Ralstonia insidiosa strains were
analysed for the presence of the element.
Results: Comparative sequence analysis of bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of a
number of uncharacterised Tn4371-like ICEs in the genomes of several β and γ- Proteobacteria.
These elements vary in size, GC content, putative function and have a mosaic-like structure of
plasmid- and phage-like sequences which is typical of Tn4371-like ICEs. These elements were found
after a through search of the GenBank database. The elements, which are found in Ralstonia, Delftia,
Acidovorax, Bordetella, Comamonas, Acidovorax, Congregibacter, Shewanella, Pseudomonas
Stenotrophomonas, Thioalkalivibrio sp. HL-EbGR7, Polaromonas, Burkholderia and Diaphorobacter sp.
share a common scaffold. A PCR method was designed (based on the Tn4371- like element
detected in the Ralstonia pickettii 12J genome) to detect and characterise new elements of this type.
Conclusion: All elements found in this study possess a common scaffold of core genes but contain
different accessory genes. A new uniform nomenclature is suggested for ICEs of the Tn4371 family.
Two novel Tn4371-like ICE were discovered and characterised, using the novel PCR method
described in two different isolates of Ralstonia pickettii from laboratory purified water.

Background
Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs) carry functional
modules involved in their conjugative transfer, chromosomal integration and for control of expression of ICE
genes [1]. ICEs are maintained in their host via site-spe-

cific integration and establishment at a unique site or sites
in their host [2-7]. ICEs have been discovered in the
genomes of various low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, various α, - and -Proteobacteria, and Bacteroides species [8].
The first ICE found was Tn916 from Bacteroides species [8].

One of the best models of ICEs is a family of elements
called the R391\SXT family that are found in -Proteobacteria. These are interesting elements as over 25 have been
found to date in organisms spread across the world. They
share a common core scaffold of genes related to integration, excision, transfer and regulation. Different elements
can possess different fitness determinants such as antibiotic resistances, heavy metal resistances, and error-prone
DNA repair systems [9].

mon scaffold with apparent hotspots containing insertions of different presumably adaptive genes. Using
sequences from the common scaffold a PCR method was
developed to discover and characterise new Tn4371-like
ICEs in different bacteria. Here we report on the use of this
method to discover and characterise two new Tn4371-like
ICEs in Ralstonia pickettii strains isolated from a purified
water system. Furthermore we propose a uniform nomenclature for newly discovered ICEs of the Tn4371 family

Tn4371 is a 55-kb ICE, which allows its host to degrade
biphenyl and 4-chlorobiphenyl. It was isolated after mating between Cupriavidus oxalaticus (Ralstonia oxalatica) A5
carrying the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid RP4
and Cupriavidus metallidurans (Ralstonia metallidurans)
CH34. Selection was applied for transconjugants that
expressed the heavy metal resistances from CH34 and
grew with biphenyl as a sole source of carbon and energy
[10]. The transconjugants carried an RP4 plasmid with a
55-kb insert near its tetracycline resistance operon. The
insert was shown to transpose to other locations and
hence was called Tn4371 [10-12]. Tn4371 has been
sequenced [13] and closely related elements have been
found in the genome sequences of a number of bacteria
including Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000, a phytopathogen from French Guyana [14], Cupriavidus metallidurans
CH34, a heavy metal resistant bacteria from Belgium [15],
Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937, aphytopathogen [16] and Azotobacter vinelandii AvOP, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from soil in the USA [13,17]. None of these other
elements possessed the biphenyl and 4-chlorobiphenyl
degradation genes.

Results and Discussion

The Tn4371-like ICEs characterised to date are mosaic in
structure consisting of Ti-RP4-like transfer systems, an
integrase region, plasmid maintenance genes and accessory genes [13]. All the characterised elements integrate
into sites on the bacterial genomes with a conserved 5'TTTTTCAT-3' sequence, termed the attB site [11]. Tn4371
transposition most likely involves a site-specific integration/excision process, since the ends of the element can be
detected covalently linked as a transfer intermediate
[11,13]. Integration is catalysed by a tyrosine based site
specific recombinase related to bacteriophage and ICE
family integrases [18].
A small number of putative ICEs have been discovered following sequence analyses of genomes of various low G+C
Gram-positive bacteria [19], various , - and -Proteobacteria [20-22], and Bacteroides species [23].
We now report the discovery and comparative analysis of
a number of novel uncharacterised Tn4371-like ICEs from
several different bacterial species. These elements are also
mosaics of plasmid and other genes and posses a com-

Bioinformatic analysis of Tn4371-like ICEs
Using bioinformatic analysis tools, searches of the
genome databases for elements similar to the Tn4371 element were carried out using the original Tn4371 sequence
as a probe. The method used was similar to that used to
detect novel members of the R391/SXT family of ICEs in
Enterobacteriaceae [22]. In this study novel unreported
ICEs closely related to Tn4371 were discovered in the
genome sequences of several different bacteria including
the β-proteobacteria, two elements in Delftia acidovorans
SPH-1, and a single element Comamonas testosteroni KF-1,
Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli AAC00-1, Bordetella petrii
DSM12804, Acidovorax sp. JS42, Polaromonas naphthalenivorans CJ2 plasmid pPNAP01, Burkholderia pseudomallei MSHR346 and Diaphorobacter sp. TPSY [Table 1]. Novel
elements were also found in the γ-proteobacteria Congregibacter litoralis KT71, Shewanella sp. ANA-3, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa 2192, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA7, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PACS171b, Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPPPA14, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a, Thioalkalivibrio
sp. HL-EbGR7 [Table 2]. The element in Bordetella petrii
DSM12804 was previously identified but not analyzed in
a paper by Lechner et al., [24]. The elements found in Delftia acidovorans SPH-1, Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 and
Bordetella petrii DSM12804 were also partially characterised along with further information on the elements in
Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 in a paper by Van Houdt
et al., [25]. Geographically all these bacteria were found in
different locations in both Europe and the Americas and
were isolated from many different environments including activated sludge, polluted water and clinical situations
[Table 1 and 2]. All elements contained different inserts
[containing accessory genes] in the core backbone except
for those found in Delftia acidovorans SPH-1 and Comamonas testosteroni KF-1. The size of the newly discovered
elements varied from 42 to 70 Kb and the GC content
from 59 to 65% [Table 1 and 2].

phylogenetic tree can be seen in Additional file 2. These
Tn4371-like int genes grouped with the int genes of ICE
Hin1056, an ICE from Haemophilus influenzae and from
phages related to the P22 phage. The int gene was found
in all characterised elements and was followed by nonconserved ORFs which differed from element to element.
These ORFs include putative DNA helicases and nucleases, proteins with β-lactamase domains, similar to RadC

ment have an arsenate resistance system located in this
region. This system is related to the ars system, and has the
genes arsH, arsC, arsB and arsA in the operon in this bacterium. The function of arsH is unknown; however it is
necessary for resistance to arsenic in the Yersinia enterocolitica virulence plasmid pYV [27]. The arsC gene encodes a
soluble arsenate reductase which reduces intracellular
arsenate to arsenite for efflux from the cell [28]. The arsA
gene codes for a unique ATPase which binds to the ArsB
membrane protein forming an anion transporting arsenite pump [28]. The arsD gene encodes an inducer independent regulatory protein which controls the upper level
of operon expression [29]. The second Delftia acidovorans
SPH-1 element has genes related to the Mer (Mercury
Resistance) operon: merR, merT, merP and merA. The merR
gene controls regulation of the operon, merT and merP
transport of the mercury ions and merA reduction of the
mercury ions [30]. This region also contains a predicted
czc [Cd/Zn/Co] efflux system [31,32]. Czc mediates the
inducible resistance to Co2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+, the protein
products of gens czcA, czcB and czc form a membranebound protein complex catalysing an energy dependant
efflux of these three metal ions [33].
Following the integrase gene two conserved genes
[ORF00013 and ORF00014 in Tn4371] were present in
most elements except those in C. litoralis KT71 and
Shewanella sp. ANA-3. These ORF's are related to proteins
encoded by genes located near the transfer origin of
Escherichia coli F plasmid [Q9WTE4 and Q9S4W2].
Although the function of the first protein is unknown, the
second shows similarity to ParB-like nucleases initially
identified as a critical element in the faithful partitioning
of plasmid DNA during cell division in the absence of
selection pressure [34,35]. Subsequently, a number of
similar proteins have been identified in prokaryotes and
archea which carry out the function of segregation of
genomic DNA during cell division. ParB homologs are
present in almost all eubacteria chromosomes [36].
The next region on all elements contains proteins similar
of the XRE [Xenobiotic Responsive Element] family of
transcriptional regulators, a putative lipoprotein with a
DNA binding domain and a protein of unknown function. The XRE family behave as lambda repressor-like proteins associated with different phages, including
Staphylococcus aureus phage phi 11 [37] and the Bacillus
subtilis defective prophage PBSX [[38], Fig. 1]. Two different homologues of the XRE were found in different elements one related to that found in the original Tn4371
element (R. pickettii 12J, D. acidovorans SPH-1, A. avenae
subsp. citrulli AAC00-1, C. testosteroni KF-1 and Acidovorax
sp. JS42, C. litoralis KT71, Shewanella sp. ANA-3, P. aeruginosa 2192 and P. aeruginosa PA7, P. aeruginosa PACS171b,
Thioalkalivibrio sp. HL-EbGR7 and B. pseudomallei

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/242

MSHR346). A different XRE was found in the remaining
elements: B. petrii DSM 12804, S. maltophilia K279a, P.
aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14, Diaphorobacter sp. TPSY, P. naphthalenivorans CJ2 plasmid pPNAP01 and the second element of Delftia acidovorans SPH-1.
Following on from the XRE transcriptional regulators, a
protein [ORF00035 of Tn4371] was found with similarity
to the RdfS excisionase [CAD31514] of ICEMlSymR7A, the
symbiosis island of Mesorhizobium loti R7A [39]. Most
excisionases, also called recombination directionality factors [RDF's], share a number of conserved features: they
are small [usually <100 amino acids] DNA-binding proteins, that are typically basic with the majority of known
RDFs having isoelectric points in the range of pH 8-10
[40]. The size of the ORF00035 protein homologues
found in this comparative analysis ranged from 89-98 aa
[amino acid] and had pI's ranging from 8.14 to 9.59.
BlastP scores showed approximately 50% aa identity with
the ICEMlSymR7A RdfS, over approximately 55 aa for all of
the putative RdfSs discovered in this study [Fig. 1]. No
excisionase was found in the second Delftia acidovorans
SPH-1 element. The location of this ORF is also of interest
as usually excisionases are found close to the integrase
gene in most ICEs particularly the SXT/R391 family [41].
The next sequence region of the elements contained plasmid-related genes whose predicated products were related
to the RepA [replication] protein of Pseudomonas plasmid
pVS1 [BAA96327, 42], plasmid pMLb of M. loti
MAFF303099 [NP_109574, 43] and plasmid pEMT8
[CAC94910, 44]; this gene maybe involved in replication
of the element [13]. The ParA partition protein of the type
Ib family [45] and its associated ParB protein was also
found but in all cases the ParB was truncated. Rep and Par
proteins have been proposed to act as a stabilisation system for the maintenance of mobile elements in bacterial
genomes [19,36], similar to the toxin-anti-toxin system
encoded by ORFs s044 and s045 of the SXT-ICE [46]. Qui
et al. found that the P. aeruginosa ICE PAPI-1 contains a
homologue of the plasmid and chromosome partitioning
gene soj (parA). They demonstrated that deletion of the soj
homologue from PAPI-1 resulted in complete loss of
PAPI-1 from P. aeruginosa. The mechanism by which the
Soj protein promotes PAPI-1 maintenance remains to be
elucidated [47]. Similar genes to soj have been found in
ICE Hin1056 and ICEA [20,48]. This region was followed
by an ORF encoding a conserved hypothetical protein
[ORF00040 in Tn4371] whose function is unknown [Fig.
1].
This sequence is followed by a region containing transfer
like proteins, the first being a putative conjugation protein
TraF related to the pilus assembly proteins of IncP plasmids. This TraF protein is a protease that acts upon the

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:242

pilus assembly protein TrbC [49]. The second is a putative
relaxase-like protein [ORF00041 in Tn4371] that has similarity to the VirD2 protein of Ti plasmids and to the RlxS
[relaxase, CAD31511] of ICEMlSymR7A. Transfer and
maintenance of ICEMlSymR7A in cells has been shown to
be dependent on the relaxase protein RlxS [[39], Fig. 1]. A
relaxase, usually encoded by the plasmid, recognizes oriT,
makes a single-strand DNA break (a nick) in oriT, and covalently attaches to the 5' end of the nicked DNA strand via
a phosphotyrosyl linkage. No helicase domain was found
in examining the protein so this indicates that the element
may use leading-strand DNA synthesis (rolling-circle replication) from the nicked 3' end to promote strand displacement and single-strand DNA transfer [50,51].
Following the putative relaxase-like protein is a variable
region encoding a number of different ORFs, which vary
from element to element; these genes encode putative
antibiotic genes, heavy metal resistance pumps and degradative and metabolic enzymes which may have originated
by transposition into the element. The sequence between
the putative relaxase gene and the first gene of the variable
region, in all elements, is similar to the sequence of an
area of Tn5 [U00004] indicating that the diversity in this
region maybe due to one or a number of Tn5 mediated
insertion events. This variable region in the novel ICE in
R. pickettii 12J encodes a putative set of lipid metabolising
genes [Fig. 1]. These are closely related to genes from Pseudomonas putida W619 [NZ_AAVY01000010.1] and from
the pREC1 plasmid from Rhodococcus erythropolis PR4
[NC_007486] [52]. A. avenae subsp. citrulli AAC00-1 contained insertion sequences and homologues to general
metabolism proteins whose exact functions are unknown.
D. acidovorans SPH-1 and C. testosteroni KF-1 contain a predicted czc [Cd/Zn/Co] efflux system [31,32] in their variable regions. The novel element in Acidovorax sp. JS42
contains genes that show similarity to a multidrug resistance pump and insertion sequences [InterPro Scan] in this
region. In the variable region in B. petrii DSM 12804 there
are various proteins that are putatively involved in degradation, however their exact function is unknown. Burkholderia pseudomallei MSHR346 has genes that are putatively
involved in xenobiotic metabolism; however again their
exact function is unknown. Polaromonas naphthalenivorans
CJ2 plasmid pPNAP01 contains a putative antibiotic
resistance pump and metabolism proteins whose role
have not been identified. Diaphorobacter sp. TPSY contains
a predicted czc [Cd/Zn/Co] efflux system similar to those
in D. acidovorans SPH-1 and C. testosteroni KF-1. The second D. acidovorans SPH-1 contains a copper resistance system Cop related to that of Pseudomonas syringae. The genes
in this system are laid out in the following order copSR copABFCD. copSR is a two-component signal transduction
system, which is required for the copper-inducible expression of copper resistance [53]. CopA and CopC are abun-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/242

dant periplasmic copper binding proteins, and CopB is
associated with copper accumulation in the outer membrane. No specific function for CopD has been determined yet [54]. CopF is involved in the cytoplasmic
detoxification of copper ions [55]. In the novel element
associated with Shewanella sp. ANA-3 the variable region
encodes genes that shares similarities with a chloramphenicol efflux pump [InterPro Scan]. C. litoralis KT71
and P. aeruginosa 2192 have a putative resistance nodulation division [RND] type multidrug efflux pump related
to the mex system of P. aeruginosa [56] and the oqx system
of E. coli plasmid pOLA52 [57] encoded. Apart from antibiotics, the broad substrate range of the Mex efflux systems of P. aeruginosa also includes organic solvents,
biocides, dyes, and cell signalling molecules [58]. In the
ICE of P. aeruginosa PA7 this variable region encodes
homologs of genes for antibiotic resistance including neomycin/kanamycin resistance, bleomycin resistance, and
streptomycin resistance related to the antibiotic resistance
genes from Tn5 [U00004]. There are also a set of genes
with similarity to the kdpFABC system. The KdpFABC
complex acts as a high affinity K+ uptake system. In E. coli,
the complex is synthesized when the constitutively
expressed low affinity K+ uptake systems Trk and Kup can
no longer meet the cell's demand for potassium due to
external K+ limitation Altendorf et al., 1992 K. Altendorf,
A. Siebers and W. Epstein, The KDP ATPase of Escherichia
coli, Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 671 (1992), pp. 228-243. Full Textvia CrossRef|View Record in Scopus Cited By in Scopus
(22)[59]. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a had a putative Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) efflux pump that
usually function as specific exporters for certain classes of
antimicrobial agents. This is related to the emrAB system
from E. coli [60]. P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 has a predicted czc [Cd/Zn/Co] efflux system similar to those in D.
acidovorans SPH-1 and C. testosteroni KF-1. P. aeruginosa
PACS171b contains a homolog of UspA- the Universal
Stress Protein. The UspA protein is important for survival
during cellular growth arrest in E. coli, but the exact physiological role of the protein is unknown [61]. Thioalkalivibrio sp. HL-EbGR7 has a set of genes with approximately
88% aa identity to the putative KdpFABC system in P. aeruginosa PA7. This variability is suggestive that this region
may be a hotspot for insertion or recombination where
insertion clearly does not disrupt or affect the expression
of neighbouring genes. The variation in predicted gene
function, size and lack of homology between elements is
suggestive of this region contributing a number of different adaptive traits to hosts containing these ICEs.
Following this variable region is encoded a putative transcriptional regulator protein TraR and a homologue of the
type IV coupling protein TraG [similar to those in IncP
plasmids]. TraG is responsible for DNA transfer during
conjugation and is a putative DNA binding protein [62].

Interestingly the gene order of this region and the order of
genes preceding it are also suggestive of an insertion [of
the variable region just discussed] into a primordial transfer module.
The putative DNA binding gene traG is followed by a
group of genes encoding proteins [TrbBCDEJLFGI] with
similarity to the mating-pair formation [mpf] apparatus
or type IV secretion system closely related to IncP and Ti
plasmids. This system presumably mediates the DNA
transfer of the ICE to recipient cells [63,64]. These genes
show similarity to those required for conjugative transfer
of the Agrobacterium Ti plasmid, pNGR234a and RP4,
except that two genes, trbK and trbH, found on these plasmids are missing [65]. In the Tn4371-like elements the
gene order was trb BCDEJLFGI in all the characterised elements found in this study and similar to the molecular
organisation in ICEMlSymR7A [[19], Fig. 1]. The TrbB,
TrbC, TrbE, TrbG, and TrbL proteins are involved in the
creation of the mpf apparatus, TrbC is involved in pilus
formation and TrbE displays ATPase activity [65].
The novel ICEs detected in this study are integrated into
various locations in the genomes of the host bacteria
where they were discovered. In Acidovorax sp. JS42 other
partial copies of Tn4371-like elements were also found in
addition to the full element reported here. Two elements
were discovered and characterised in D. acidovorans SPH1. A further partial element was found in B. petrii this however lacked the intTn4371 gene. This situation is similar to
that found in R. metallidurans CH34 and indicates that
duplication or multiple insertions of the elements occur
in bacteria. Near complete copies of Tn4371-like elements
were also found in Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD and Burkholderia multivorans ATCC17616, where both were found
to lack the Tn4371-like integrase gene suggesting that the
elements may no longer be mobile. New elements were
also found in Ralstonia solanacearum MolK2 and a second
element in Diaphorobacter sp. TPSY, these share similarities in the stabilisation and transfer regions of the element
to Tn4371-like elements but they have a different integrase region not related to the intTn4371 gene.
All of the elements reported here [Table 1 and 2] appear
to share a common scaffold or backbone that is approximately 24 kb in size containing a 1.5 kb integrase gene; an
8.5 kb replication/stability gene cluster and a 14 kb conjugal transfer/mating pair formation cluster [Fig. 1]. A visual representation of this can be seen in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5
where the various sequences were aligned for comparison,
the core scaffold identified and 'adaptive' genes highlighted which vary from element to element.
Bioinformatic comparisons were performed between the
genes that make up the core scaffold region of the ICE and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/242

these ranged from the highly conserved traG gene, with 84
to 96% aa identity, trbE gene, with 76 to 94% aa identity,
and the parA gene, with 90 to 97% aa identity, to the lessconserved traR gene, with 53 to 84% aa identity. On average the genes that we ascribed to the core showed > 75%
aa identity and were also related by gene order. All gene
numbers and a basic description of the genes are included
in Additional file 3.
Defining the Tn4371 family of ICEs and nomenclature
These elements have been classed as ICEs as we believe at
this moment in time this is the best terminology currently
available. They follow all the criteria of ICEs having integration and transfer modules, possessing an excisionase
gene and having genes and gene layout (rdfS, rlxS and the
trb genes) similar to other ICEs namely ICEMlSymR7A. The
original element can also excise from bacterial chromosome and form a circular intermediate [9], however the
element has not been shown to transfer between different
bacteria, and this could be due to the original element
lacking the trbD gene [13].

Although the elements identified in this study are not
identical, they share a similar core backbone that, in our
view, warrants their inclusion into the Tn4371 ICE family.
All encode a related integrase, related maintenance and
transfer genes and the gene order of homologous genes
are similar, if one were to remove variable inserted regions
which differ from element to element. We propose that
any ICE that encodes an integrase gene closely related to
intTn4371, defined as over 70% protein homology and that
has similar maintenance and transfer genes be considered
part of the Tn4371 family of ICEs.
Given the number of Tn4371-like elements discovered in
this study, it seems sensible to name newly described ICEs
of the Tn4371 family with a uniform nomenclature. We
propose adapting the system used for naming transposons
described by Roberts et al., [66]. This system is a website
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/eastman/tn/ based system which
assigns Tn numbers in sequence e.g. Tn6033, Tn6034, etc
and the elements were then called ICETn43716033,
ICETn43716034, etc to distinguish that they are ICEs of the
Tn4371 family. The names assigned to the elements discovered in this study are listed in Table 1 and 2. This system was chosen as other systems such as that used by
Burrus et al., [8] for naming members of the SXT\R391
family of ICEs are not regulated and can differ between
laboratories leading to confusion.
Tn4371-like ICE detection and molecular characterisation
Following the discovery of the widespread nature of
Tn4371-like ICEs in the genomes of many new organisms,
PCR primers were designed to amplify important genes of
the core scaffold to aid in the rapid identification of new

Tn4371-like elements. We tested this on a culture collection of fifty-eight Ralstonia pickettii and Ralstonia insidiosa
strains from various environments and geographic locations. The PCR primers were based on conserved consensus sequences of core genes identified from all the
elements identified in this study and those reported previously.
The results in Fig. 6 show the genes encoding a putative
integrase [int], the putative stabilisation system [repA,
parA, parB], a homologue to the DNA transfer protein
[traG] and a putative pilus assembly and synthesis protein
[trbI]. DNA sequencing of the four amplicons in the tester
strains demonstrated that Tn4371-like sequences exist in
the genome of R. pickettii ULM001. While this data clearly
demonstrates the presence of Tn4371-like elements in
tester strains the possibility of multiple elements in such

strains cannot be excluded, although out sequencing of
resulting amplicons is suggestive of only one element.
Three of the fifty-eight Ralstonia isolates, ULM001,
ULM003 and ULM006 [which were laboratory purified
water isolates from different locations in France] showed
positive amplification for intTn4371 integrase gene when
tested with the intFor1 and intRev1 primer pair in PCR
amplification [Table 3]. Sequencing revealed that the
ULM001 int gene showed 85% and 99% nucleotide identity to the Tn4371 int gene and ICETn43716033 int gene,
respectively. The RepAF and RepAR primers also amplified the repA gene and the parA gene in ULM001, ULM003
and ULM006. Sequencing these amplicons revealed that
in ULM001 the repA and parB genes were present and
showed 88% and 99% nucleotide identity to the RepA and
ParA genes from Tn4371 and ICETn43716033 respectively.

A traGTn4371 homolog was also detected in ULM001,
ULM003 and ULM006 following PCR amplification.
Sequencing revealed that the ULM001 traGTn4371 gene
showed 91% and 89% nucleotide identity to traG from
Tn4371 and ICETn43716033 respectively. TrbIF and TrbIR
primers were used to amplify the trbI gene in ULM001 and
ULM003 while no amplification occurred in ULM006.
Sequencing showed that the ULM001 amplicon was a
homolog, which had 88% and 99% nucleotide identity to
the trbI gene from Tn4371 and ICETn43716033 respectively.
The absence of a trbI gene amplicon in ULM006 may indicate a deleted gene or truncated element in this strain. The

use of these primer sets has thus revealed the presence of
two new elements, which can then be further characterised. The ICEs detected in this study from Ralstonia pickettii
were named ICETn43716043 and ICETn43716044 using the
nomenclature system described above, a general map of
the elements can be seen in Fig. 6.

elements analysed in this study with Tn4371-like element
from previous studies showed the attL site had a sequence
of TTTTC/TA/GT and attR had a sequence of TTTTC/TA/
GT for some bacteria, while others had no direct repeats.
These alignments can be seen in Additional file 4. The
exact sequence of the direct repeat for each element is presented in Table 4. The absence of direct repeats in some of
these elements may mean that they are no longer mobile.
Tn4371 has been shown to excise from the RP4 plasmid
in Ralstonia eutropha forming a circular extrachromosomal
intermediate [[10], Fig. 7a] as a transfer intermediate. The
strains in which we detected Tn4371-like elements were
examined to see if they also excised forming extrachromo-

somal intermediates [CirIm] using a PCR assay that
allowed amplification across the circular junction but
which would not amplify if the element were integrated.
Primer LE1 is specific to integrated Tn4371-like ICE DNA
at the attL left-end where as primer RE1 is specific to integrated Tn4371-like ICE at the attR right-end [Fig. 7a, Table
3]. Both primers are oriented towards the Tn4371- like
ICE junctions, and PCR product will be generated only if
the respective left and right ends [attL and attR sites] excise
from the chromosome and circularise [CirIm], reconstituting attP [attachment locus on the element]. A model of
integration and excision of the ICE can be seen in Fig. 7a.

form of the element is present in these cells, while no PCR
product was obtained from ULM006 [Fig. 7b]. The
sequencing of the attP region of ICETn43716043 gave an
attL region of TTTTTCAT and an attR region of TACTTTTT.
This rapid amplification across the circular attP junction
can also be utilised for the rapid identification of Tn4371like elements. It is possible that the PCR may have picked
up tandems of the element if those happened to be intermediates in "transposition".

Conclusion

Tn4371-like ICEs are found in a wide range of γ-proteobacteria and β-proteobacteria from both clinical and environmental sources. These types of bacteria are known for

their large metabolic repertoires and these elements could
potentially be a source of acquisition of adaptive functions for these organisms. The discovery of the Tn4371like ICEs in the P. aeruginosa strains, S. maltophilia K279a
and B. pseudomallei MSHR346 are the first reports of these
elements found in human pathogens. This along with the
discovery of putative antibiotic resistance genes in their
genomes indicates that these elements may have an
impact in clinical situations. The discovery and characterisation of novel Tn4371-like elements as reported here
adds significantly to the repertoire of such elements and
helps define the core scaffold of such elements. It is clear
that these elements are highly adaptable and may contribute significantly to the metabolic capabilities of their host.
This study increases the knowledge available about these
elements adding data on eighteen new elements to the

five already known. A new nomenclature system for
Tn4371-like elements was designed to avoid confusion in
the naming of these elements. The primer system used to
detect and characterise the Tn4371-like ICEs in Ralstonia
pickettii ULM001 and ULM003 could be adapted and used
for other bacterial species for the rapid screening of such
elements.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
The strains used in this study are shown in Table 5. All the
strains were stored at -20°C in Nutrient Broth [Biolab,
Budapest, Hungary] with 50% glycerol. Isolates were
grown aerobically on Nutrient Agar [Biolab, Budapest,
Hungary] and incubated overnight at 30°C.

Molecular analysis of genes of Tn4371-like ICEs
PCR primers were designed based on the conserved
aligned scaffold common to all ICEs characterised in this
study and from the consensus sequence of the Ralstonia
pickettii 12J Tn4371 ICE using the Primer 3 program [[67],
http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/]. All primers are listed in Table 5.
The cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (98°C, 2 min); 35 cycles consisting of denaturation
[98°C for 15 s], primer annealing [TA [estimated primer
annealing temperature], 1 min], and extension [72°C, 1
min/kb]; followed by a final extension step [72°C, 10
min]. Amplification was carried out with a GC buffer [in
a total reaction of 100 μL containing 0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 100 pmol of each primer, 8 μL of
genomic template DNA, and 3 units of Phusion polymer-

Bioinformatic Analysis of the Tn4371-like ICEs in genomes
All analysed DNA sequences were retrieved from the GenBank database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

DNA and protein sequences similar to Tn4371 [[13],
AJ536756] were detected within the NCBI nonredundant
nucleotide
and
protein
databases
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov via blastp and blastn analysis
using the original Tn4371 sequence as a probe [69].
Assembly and comparison with other Tn4371-like
sequences was performed with the Artemis Comparison
Tool [ACT] [[70], http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/
ACT]. The complete DNA sequences were also manually
annotated to verify the deposited sequence. The similarity
of proteins encoded by the element was determined as %
aa identities over the entire protein to its Tn4371 equivalent via blastp. Unknown ORFs were analysed using Inter-

ProScan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/, [71]] to
locate motifs or domains where similarity with known
proteins was low or absent. Size and total % GC content
was determined using the GC-Profile program [[72],
http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/GC-Profile/]. Phylogenetic and
molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using
genetic-distance-based neighbour-joining algorithms
within MEGA version 4.0 [[73], http://www.megasoft
