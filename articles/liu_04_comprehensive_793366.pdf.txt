Background: Pseudogenes often manifest themselves as disabled copies of known genes. In
prokaryotes, it was generally believed (with a few well-known exceptions) that they were rare.

Background

in younger, more lineage-specific, protein families, and is in
many cases linked to the generation of functional diversity
[3]. However, pseudogene formation in most prokaryotes has
not been analyzed as a matter of course, and has, historically,
been assumed to be minimal [11]. Some recent substantial
populations of pseudogenes have been discovered in pathogenic bacteria, most notably in the leprosy bacillus Mycobacterium leprae, where around 1,100 pseudogenes (compared
to around 1,600 genes) were found, with pseudogene formation providing a 'fossil record' of recent wholesale loss of

information

Genes that have recently fallen out of use for an organism are
often detectable in the genome as pseudogenes - disabled
copies of genes characterizable by disruptions of their reading
frames due to frameshifts and premature stop codons [1-3].
Surveys of the pseudogene populations of eukaryotes (budding yeast, nematode worm, fruit fly and human) have
recently been completed [4-10]. These pseudogene analyses
have yielded insights into eukaryotic proteome evolution,
showing that duplicated pseudogene formation tends to occur

interactions

Conclusions: We find suggestive evidence that a large fraction of prokaryote pseudogenes arose
from failed horizontal transfer events. In particular, we find that pseudogenes are more than twice
as likely as genes to have anomalous codon usage associated with horizontal transfer. Moreover,
we found a significant difference in the number of horizontally transferred pseudogenes in
pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli.

refereed research

Results: We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the occurrence of pseudogenes in a
diverse selection of 64 prokaryote genomes. Overall, we find a total of around 7,000 candidate
pseudogenes. Moreover, in all the genomes surveyed, pseudogenes occur in at least 1 to 5% of all
gene-like sequences, with some genomes having considerably higher occurrence. Although many
large populations of pseudogenes arise from large, diverse protein families (for example, the ABC
transporters), notable numbers of pseudogenes are associated with specific families that do not
occur that widely. These include the cytochrome P450 and PPE families (PF00067 and PF00823)
and others that have a direct role in DNA transposition.

To address these broad questions, we have adapted a pipeline
developed for eukaryotic pseudogene identification to 64
prokaryotic genomes [4]. The species analyzed include
archaea, pathogenic bacteria and non-pathogenic bacteria,
and many of the pathogenic bacteria are also important
organisms in current biodefense research. We have found
nearly 7,000 pseudogenes, with notable numbers of pseudogenes for specific families linked to DNA transposition and
also that have some role in environmental responses. Our
results, which we have derived consistently across all the
genomes, are available from our prokaryote pseudogene
information website [13].

Results and discussion
Pseudogenes are pervasive in prokaryotes
To identify pseudogenes in prokaryotic genomes, we performed a conservative and comprehensive search, as outlined
in Figure 1 and Materials and methods. We used a proteome
set consisting of sequences from the 64 genomes and SwissProt [14] with relatively high confidence in annotation (that
is, excluding those annotated as hypothetical proteins). Intergenic regions in prokaryotic genomes were searched against
the proteome set using FastX [15] for homology matches with
disablements as pseudogene candidates. We then applied
several checks to reduce false positives (see Materials and
methods). Overall, we found 6,895 candidate pseudogenes.

Pseudogenes in prokaryotes. (a) Procedure for assigning pseudogenes.
The flow chart shows the steps in identifying pseudogenes in 64
prokaryote genomes. The steps include: separate intergenic regions from
coding sequence (hypothetical ORFs were excluded); six-frame FastX
search on intergenic regions for pseudogene candidates; quality control to
reduce false-positive results introduced by artificial disablement or by
different codon usage. (b) The occurrence of relative disablement
positions in pseudogenes, which were normalized on a 100-residue scale
based on ratios of the distances from starting residues to disablements to
the length of pseudogenes. The yellow bars indicate the distribution of
disablement positions before the last quality-control step and the green
bars show the distribution after minimizing false-positive pseudogenes.

pathways involved in lipid metabolism and anaerobic respiration [12].
Here we want to address the question of whether these large
populations are exceptional, or whether there are substantial
populations of pseudogenes in other prokaryotic genomes. If
so, from a holistic 'polygenomic' perspective, what sorts of

Previously, the pseudogene fraction was defined as the ratio
of the number of pseudogenes to the number of all gene-like
sequences (genes plus pseudogenes) [16]. By this measure, we
find that pseudogenes are pervasive in prokaryotes (Figure
2). Pseudogenes are detectable at a low 'background' level in
most prokaryotes, ranging from 1 to 5% of the genome (Figure
2). Application of a more restrictive cutoff (E-value less than
0.001, instead of E-value less than 0.01) in FastX alignment
results in slightly smaller percentage of pseudogenes (0.1%
less on average) in all the genomes, and generates essentially
the same results (data not shown). Our census is in general
agreement with previous assessments of pseudogene content
in the genomes of M. leprae, Escherichia coli and Rickettsia
prowazekii [12,16-19]. In these previous studies, however,
different criteria were used for pseudogene identification in
different genomes, leading to inconsistencies in comparing
results. This is avoided in our study by using a method applied
uniformly across all genomes. All these assessments suggest
that most prokaryotes have similar net genomic DNA deletion
rates, resulting in similar low-level 'background' pseudogene
fractions in their genomes.
To check for a correlation with microbial 'lifestyle', we classified the 64 species into three categories: archaea, pathogenic

Fractions of pseudogenes in the 64 prokaryote genomes. The genomes are divided into three categories: archaea (green), non-pathogenic bacteria (blue)
and pathogenic bacteria (purple). The yellow bars represent the fractions of pseudogenes that overlap with hypothetical ORFs, and the green bars
represent those that do not overlap. Genomes in each category are sorted by the green bars.

bacteria and non-pathogenic bacteria. The pseudogene fractions for these groupings were assessed. M. leprae has a very
large pseudogene fraction (36.5%) and is clearly a unique outlier. When this genome is set aside, the three groups have
similar pseudogene fractions (3.6%, 3.9% and 3.3%). Note
that three other pathogenic species/strains have relatively
large pseudogene fractions, including Neisseria meningitidis
MC58 (12.4%), N. meningitidis Z2491 (11.6%) and Rickettsia
conorii (9.7%). The higher pseudogene fractions of some
pathogenic species have previously been suggested to be a
result of a rapidly changing environmental niche, with loss of
metabolic and respiratory pathways [12].
We found that about 2,300 of our 6,895 candidate pseudogenes overlap with more than 2,600 annotated hypothetical
open reading frames (ORFs), whose fractions were indicated
in Figure 2. The overlap could arise from erroneous gene
annotations or sequencing errors [16]. In either case, the
pseudogene annotation in prokaryotic genomes is evidently
an important part of decontaminating gene annotation.

Pseudogene families
We used the Pfam classification [20] to analyze the families
and functions of candidate pseudogenes. The 20 top-ranking
domain families in terms of pseudogenes are shown in Figure
3a. Many large divergent gene families are among the top
pseudogene families, including 9 of the top 10 gene families
such as: the ABC transporter (PF00005), short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (PF00106), sugar transporter (major
facilitator superfamily) (PF00083), and histidine kinase-like
ATPase (PF02518). As the largest family of proteins in
prokaryotes, the ABC transporter functions to translocate a
variety of compounds across biological membranes [21-23]. It
consists of two ATP-binding domains (PF00005) [24,25] and
two transmembrane domains (PF00664). These domains are
present in large copy numbers across genomes (2,172 and 245
gene copies as well as 67 and 13 pseudogene copies
respectively).
There are notable protein families that rank high in pseudogene number, but low in terms of gene number. They include
the PPE family (PF00823) which is thought to be linked to
antigenic variation in mycobacteria and is highly polymorphic [26]; the cytochromes P450 (PF00067), which are
involved in processing diverse substrates; the GGDEF
domain (PF00990), which is of unknown function and is
associated with a wide diversity of other protein domains
[27]; alpha/beta-hydrolase enzymes (PF00561), which have
diverse catalytic functions; and pseudo-U-synthase-2
enzymes (PF00849), which help synthesize pseudouridine
from uracil. Note that the first two families in this list have
sequence diversity that has some link to environmental
response.
Figure 3b shows the relationship between the number of
pseudogenes and genes for Pfam families. One might expect

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R64

this relationship to be linear, with bigger families having
more pseudogenes, but Figure 3b shows this is not the case.
Two large families that have a relatively high ratio of pseudogenes to genes are the transposase DDE domain (PF01609)
and integrase core domain (PF00665). Transposase facilitates DNA transposition and horizontal gene transfer and its
DDE domain may be responsible for DNA cleavage at a specific site followed by a strand-transfer reaction [28]. Many
transposons contain transposases for their transposition
[29,30]. We found that two strains of N. meningitidis (MC58
and Z2491) carry 26 and 22 copies of transposase pseudogenes, respectively, and have only 11 and 5 copies of transposase genes. In the MC58 strain, transposase pseudogenes
have been found in most of the 29 remnant insertion
sequences [31]. This suggests that N. meningitidis strains
probably undergo high selection pressure for transposases.
The integrase core domain family (PF00665) is the catalytic
domain of integrase, which mediates integration of a DNA
copy of a viral/bacteriophage genome into the host genome
[32]. It catalyzes the DNA strand-transfer reaction by ligating
the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration
site [32]. The large number of transposase and integrase
pseudogenes might result from harmful foreign genes being
disabled in transposable elements. Several species contain
many integrase pseudogenes, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, M. leprae, M. tuberculosis, and E. coli strain
O157:H7. The large number of pseudogenes relative to genes
for these two gene families may reflect an overall high selective pressure for them - that is, a gene family that is rapidly
duplicating and evolving may generate many pseudogenes.

Origins of pseudogenes
Retrotransposition and genomic DNA duplication generate
pseudogenes in mammals and other eukaryotes [2,3]. In contrast, in prokaryotes, based on the experience annotating E.
coli and M. leprae [12,16], pseudogenes are suggested to arise
from three process: the disablement of detectable native
duplications; the decay of native single-copy host genes; and
failed horizontal transfers.
However, the complete extent of the processes forming
prokaryotic pseudogenes is not yet well understood. We realize that there are many methods of defining horizontal transfer [33-36] and an active debate on the best way of doing this
[37,38], so we applied two independent methods to predict
horizontal gene transfer events. The first method (GC-content) is based on the GC content bias at particular codon positions of recently acquired genes [33,39]. The second method
(GeneTrace) is based on the analysis of phylogenetic distribution of protein families on species tree [40]. In the GC-content method, the number of pseudogenes resulting from
horizontal transfer in each genome was estimated by applying
the same criteria to them as had been previously used to identify horizontally transferred genes. Overall, we found that the
ratio (19.9%) of pseudogenes from potential horizontal transfer to those derived from the host is significantly higher than

information

In summary, we report here for the first time an estimate of
how often horizontal transfer in prokaryotes introduces genes
that are redundant, useless or even detrimental. Firstly, ORFs
from dangerous genetic elements are under strong selection
pressure to be deleted from the host's genome [11]. Secondly,
horizontally transferred genes have a higher chance than
non-transferred genes of becoming pseudogenes in most
prokaryotes, which may be a result of deactivation/disablement of non-beneficial transferred genes.

interactions

To confirm our findings based on a method relying on GC
content bias we applied the GeneTrace method (see Materials
and methods). We analyzed a subset of pseudogenes and
found that 18% result from failed horizontal transfer events,
consistent with the previous method. Note that GeneTrace
and the GC-content method are very different in the criteria
they use to assess horizontal transfer and thus make for good
independent verification of each other.

By examining closely related strains of the same species, we
found that most close strains have a similar value for the
failed horizontal transfer index. In particular, M. tuberculosis
(strains H37Rv and CDC1551), N. meningitidis (strains Z1491
and MC8), and Helicobacter pylori (strains 26695 and J99)
share similar index values within species. However, E. coli
has different index values in the three strains studied. The
free-living E. coli K12 strain has an index value of 4.6, comparable to values calculated from previous results [16], while the
two pathogenic E. coli strains O157:H7 and O157:H7 EDL933
have much lower values (1.8 and 0.8). This can be readily
explained in two ways: the intracellular pathogenic E. coli
strains could have moved into a different environment that
results in lower exposure to incoming DNA and thus to a
lower rate of horizontal gene transfer [41]; or these strains
could have an increased rate of gene loss or pseudogene formation of their host genes.

the ratio of genes in the host (8.6%). We dubbed the ratio of
these two quantities the 'failed horizontal transfer index', and
observed that it implies that pseudogenes are 2.3 times more
likely to arise from horizontal transfer than host genes are
(Table 1).

The fraction of disabled residues (per 1,000 residues) versus the number

shows how the overall level of decay of a pseudogene population relates to age (which corresponds to the degree of overall
match to the closest homologs). There is a general power-lawlike behavior governing this measure, with recent pseudogenes having few disablements and divergent pseudogenes
having many (Figure 4). Archaea and most non-pathogenic
bacteria cluster together at higher rates of disablement
(between 10 and 28 per 1,000 residues) and less significant
matches, indicating comparatively greater retention of
ancient gene remnants in those species and fewer young
pseudogenes. On the other hand, obligate pathogenic bacteria
tend to have younger pools of pseudogenes, even though they
exhibit high disablement rates. Interestingly, four species of
obligate bacterial pathogens clearly stand out from the general tendency: these are M. leprae and three closely related
mycoplasma species: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pulmonis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Pseudogenes in these four pathogenic bacteria carry several times
more disablements, suggesting that these bacteria have an
accelerated disabling mutation rate. It is known that M.
leprae has lost the dnaQ-mediated proofreading activities of
DNA polymerase III [12,42], which could contribute to a
higher mutation rate. The higher mutation rates in these species might suggest that these pathogens are under adaptation
to their new environment, or have specific genome regions
that are hypermutable.
It is important to note here that the current sequence databases are derived from an uneven sampling of genomes.
Therefore, genomes of organisms with more sequenced relatives may appear to have, on average, a seemingly younger
population of pseudogenes, while others may appear to have
older and fewer identifiable pseudogenes. Using data from 64
genomes, our results indicate an overall trend for

We have shown that pseudogenes in prokaryotes are not
uncommon, occupying 1-5% of all gene-like sequences. We
find that specific gene families with clear links to DNA transposition and environmental responses have higher pseudogene/gene ratios.
The pseudogene data has many implications for the study of
genome reduction and expansion [43,44]. A significant proportion of the pseudogenes arose from putative failed horizontal transfer - at more than two times the rate for genes.
Obligate pathogenic bacteria have high rates of disablement
in younger pseudogene populations, consistent with recent
accelerated genome reduction [44], while, in contrast,
archaea and non-pathogenic bacteria have relatively older
pseudogene populations, but similar rates of disablement.
In terms of methodological implications, it is evidently necessary to include prokaryote pseudogenes as part of systematic
annotation pipelines in the future. In addition, it was also
shown to be helpful to identify potential short ORFs [45].
Furthermore, our survey shows that trends can be observed
'polygenomically' for prokaryotes, where they are not obvious
or significant in individual genomes.

Materials and methods
Database releases used
We used the following datasets in our prokaryotic pseudogene analysis: Swiss-Prot (release 40.19 and updated to 27
May, 2002) [14] containing 43,094 prokaryotic protein
sequences; nucleotide sequences from 64 prokaryotic
genomes from EMBL database release 70 on March-2002
[46], including 11 genomes from archaea and 53 from bacteria
as listed in Figure 1; Pfam release 7.3 of May 2002, containing
3,849 families and 498,152 protein domains in the alignments [20].

Pseudogene identification pipeline
Figure 1a shows the basic procedure for identifying prokaryotic pseudogenes. The general schema was adapted from pipelines for pseudogene analysis in eukaryotes [4]. We generated
a prokaryotic proteome set by collecting all the prokaryotic
protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot database and those annotated in the 64 prokaryotic genomes. To be conservative, we
did not include hypothetical or putative proteins, a large proportion of which might be overannotated [47,48]. All the protein sequences were masked by SEG using the default lowcomplexity filter parameters (122.22.5) [49]. To maximize the
efficiency of the pseudogene search, we only considered the
intergenic DNA regions in the 64 prokaryote genomes

Estimation of horizontally transferred genes and
pseudogenes
Here we used a method (GC-content) to estimate horizontal
transferred genes on the basis of their base compositions
[33,39]. We analyzed each of the 64 genomes individually,
and atypical genes and pseudogenes were identified if the GC
content at first and third codon positions was two or more
standard deviations higher or lower than the mean values at
those positions in genes.

Genome Biology 2004, 5:R64

information

The results for the 64 genomes are shown in Table 1. The
failed transferred index in the last column represents the
ratio of the fraction of putative horizontally transferred pseudogenes to the fraction of horizontally transferred genes

interactions

To ensure that we had the codon positions accurately
assigned for the GC-content method, we only analyzed
codons for pseudogenes that aligned well with annotated protein sequences, specifically excluding the regions of the alignment around frameshifts. While it is true that the local
alignment in some regions of a pseudogene may be ambiguous, causing some difference in the GC-content calculation in
that region, the impact on the overall GC-content estimation
is minimal, given how many positions we average over to calculate the failed transfer index score.

refereed research

Sequencing errors could also be a potential problem in the
detection of pseudogenes. However, this effect is expected to
be small, as comparison of independently sequenced isolates
of the same E. coli strains indicated that only about 7% of candidate pseudogenes could be due to sequencing error [16]. To
further consider the possibility of sequencing error, we examined the stop codons in the pseudogenes detected in the S.

All genes in the 64 genomes were assigned to Pfam families by
cross-referencing of their Swiss-Prot ID. Pseudogenes were
assigned to Pfam families through ID of their closest
homologs. Only the homologs that cover more than 70% of
the Pfam domain were selected. A pseudogene could be
assigned to multiple Pfam families if it contains multiple
domains.

deposited research

We considered non-standard codon usage in some bacteria,
such as when TGA encodes tryptophan rather than a stop
codon in mycoplasma species, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, M. pulmonis and U. urealyticum. By manual examination of E. coli genes with translational frameshifts in the
RECODE database [50], we found that those genes were
included in coding sequences (CDS) and therefore were
excluded from our pseudogene search.

Family classification of genes and pseudogenes

reports

We also assessed the potential pseudogenes by examining the
distribution of the disablements within pseudogene
sequences. Given that mutations within pseudogenes are
unconstrained, we would expect disablements on pseudogenes to be evenly distributed. Figure 1b shows the position of
disablements within pseudogene fragments whose length is
normalized to 100 residues. By removing those potential
pseudogenes that only had disablements at their flanking
regions at both ends, the distribution is almost evenly distributed. We used it as a 'control filter' to minimize false-positive
pseudogenes. In the final pseudogene set, the length of pseudogenes ranges from 33 to 4,969 amino acids, with a median
length of 130 amino acids, as compared with the proteome
set, where the length ranges from 7 to 10,920 amino acids
with a median length of 291 amino acids.

pneumoniae genome (frameshift positions are not considered as they are difficult to locate.). This genome and eight
others found in the trace archive of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [51] and Ensembl [52]
were all sequenced by TIGR. We selected S. pneumoniae as a
case study as it is a relatively big genome available in the
archive. By adapting a previous method [53], we examined
the overall quality values (Q) for each nucleic acid of stop
codons in the pseudogenes. Pseudogene sequences were
aligned to the archived sequences (≥ 95% identity), and the
quality values for nucleotides in stop codons were summed
up. We chose 10-2 as a cutoff of the error rate (err = 10SUM(0.1Q)) for all nucleic acids. The stop codons with all three
nucleic acids above the cutoff were validated. Out of 116 pseudogenes in this genome, 73 were found to contain 150 stop
codons in total. Using the available data in the trace archive,
we identified 54 pseudogenes with stop codons being aligned
with the original sequences, and validated 47 of these (87%).
In addition, a similar fraction of stop codons (101 out of 116)
was confirmed.

reviews

To ensure that spurious disablements were not introduced at
ends of sequences as an alignment artifact, we excluded
homology matches whose disablements occurred only within
a 'cutoff region' at either end. We used 16 residues for the cutoff region for short sequences (160 amino acids or fewer) - a
parameter that has been applied previously [6]. For longer
sequences (more than 160 amino acids), 10% of the sequence
length was applied as the cutoff region as FastX tends to
include more residues at the ends of alignments.

comment

(including the regions encoding hypothetical proteins) as
query sequences, and searched their forward and reverse
complement sequences against the proteome set using FastX
[15]. Significant homology matches (E-value less than 0.01)
that contained more than one disablement (either a
frameshift caused by insertion or deletion of nucleotides or a
premature stop codon) were considered as potential pseudogenes. If an intergenic region had multiple matches, these
matches were sorted by E-value (increasing) and then by the
number of matching residues (decreasing), if they have the
same E-value. The match with the most significant E-value
and the maximum matching residues was selected and redundant matches were removed.

similar to the measure previously used in E. coli [16]. This
essentially gives a likelihood ratio for horizontal transfer for
pseudogenes relative to that of genes.
Note that to minimize the effect of more divergent sequence
alignments, for the horizontal-transfer calculations we only
analyzed 1,748 'recent' pseudogenes, which have more than
50% sequence identity to their closest matches over an
aligned subsequence of more than 100 residues.

We have investigated the statistical robustness of the failed
transfer index using resampling approaches [54]. For each of
the 64 genomes, we randomly picked 90% of its genes and
calculated their GC content. Using the new GC content, we
then identified the putative horizontally transferred genes
and pseudogenes and calculated the failed transfer index. We
applied the process 1,000 times, generating a distribution of
1,000 indexes, which has a mean value of 2.32 with standard
deviation of 0.01.

We also applied an alternative method (GeneTrace) to estimate horizontally transferred pseudogenes [40]. In this
method, potential horizontal transfer events are inferred
within a protein family when it is present only in distantly
related species and is absent from members of the same phylogenetic clade. We analyzed a subset of pseudogenes - 225
pseudogenes across 62 genomes - whose closest Swiss-Prot
homologs share more than 70% sequence identity across at
least 100 amino acids, and identified 41 of them (18%) as from
failed horizontal transfer events.
