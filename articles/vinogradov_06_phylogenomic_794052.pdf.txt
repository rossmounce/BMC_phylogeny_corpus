Abstract
Background: Globins occur in all three kingdoms of life: they can be classified into single-domain
globins and chimeric globins. The latter comprise the flavohemoglobins with a C-terminal FADbinding domain and the gene-regulating globin coupled sensors, with variable C-terminal domains.
The single-domain globins encompass sequences related to chimeric globins and «truncated»
hemoglobins with a 2-over-2 instead of the canonical 3-over-3 α-helical fold.
Results: A census of globins in 26 archaeal, 245 bacterial and 49 eukaryote genomes was carried
out. Only ~25% of archaea have globins, including globin coupled sensors, related single domain
globins and 2-over-2 globins. From one to seven globins per genome were found in ~65% of the
bacterial genomes: the presence and number of globins are positively correlated with genome size.
Globins appear to be mostly absent in Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Chlamydia, Lactobacillales,
Mollicutes, Rickettsiales, Pastorellales and Spirochaetes. Single domain globins occur in metazoans
and flavohemoglobins are found in fungi, diplomonads and mycetozoans. Although red algae have
single domain globins, including 2-over-2 globins, the green algae and ciliates have only 2-over-2
globins. Plants have symbiotic and nonsymbiotic single domain hemoglobins and 2-over-2
hemoglobins. Over 90% of eukaryotes have globins: the nematode Caenorhabditis has the most
putative globins, ~33. No globins occur in the parasitic, unicellular eukaryotes such as
Encephalitozoon, Entamoeba, Plasmodium and Trypanosoma.
Conclusion: Although Bacteria have all three types of globins, Archaeado not have
flavohemoglobins and Eukaryotes lack globin coupled sensors. Since the hemoglobins in organisms
other than animals are enzymes or sensors, it is likely that the evolution of an oxygen transport
function accompanied the emergence of multicellular animals.

A Venn diagram of the distribution in the three kingdoms of
life, of the three globin lineages: 3/3 FHbs/SDgbs, 3/3 GCSs/
Pgbs and 2/2 Hbs. The number of genomes that have globins
is shown as a fraction of the total number of genomes.

Background
The number of globin families has grown markedly since
the 1970's, when they were limited to the α- and β-globins
and Mbs, mostly of vertebrates, and the SHbs (legHbs) of
legume plants [1-3]. The ensuing years brought to light
several new globins: SHbs in plants other than legumes,
NsHbs in a wide variety of plants [4-6], and FHbs, chimeric proteins (~400aa) comprising an N-terminal globin
domain and a C-terminal FAD- and NAD-binding
domain, related to the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases,
found in E. coli [7] and in yeasts [8,9]. Concurrently,
"truncated" globins, sequences shorter than normal
(<130aa), were discovered in protozoa [10], cyanobacteria [11-13], a nemertean [14], and bacteria [15,16]. Globins longer than normal (>160aa), similar to the
"truncated" Hbs, were observed in a green alga [17,18]
and in plants [19]. The crystal structures of several "truncated" Hbs showed them to have a novel 2-over-2 α-helical fold instead of the canonical 3-over-3 α-helical fold,
with an abbreviated A helix, a decreased CE interhelical
region and most of the F helix occurring as a loop [20-22].
Consequently, we advocate using 2/2 Hb instead of "truncated", to indicate the distinctive secondary structure of
this group of globins and to bring order to the chaotic terminology in the existing databases, where "truncated",
"cyanobacterial", "protozoan" and "2-over-2" are all in
current use.
The utilization of molecular biological techniques
allowed the detection of globins in organisms where their
presence was unsuspected, such as the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans and in other nematodes [23-30], the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/31

dipteran Drosophila melanogaster [31] and the urochordate
Ciona intestinalis [32]. The recent, rapid accumulation of
genomic information has resulted in a substantial
increase in newly recognized globins. This list includes the
Ngbs [33,34] and Cygbs [35-37], which are believed to
occur in all vertebrates from humans to birds and fish
[38], GbE, the eye-specific globin in the domestic chicken
Gallus gallus, related to Cygb [39], and GbX, a new and
fifth type of globin gene in fish and amphibians, thought
to have been lost in the higher vertebrates [40]. FHbs were
found in a variety of bacterial groups [16,41-43] together
with SDgbs, which align with the FHb globin domains
[42,43]. Furthermore, globin coupled sensor proteins,
chimeric two-domain gene regulators (~300 to >700aa)
comprising an N-terminal globin domain, were discovered in an archaean and several bacterial groups [44-47].
Lastly, "protoglobins" (~195aa) related to the former,
were found in archaea and in several bacteria [48] and
proposed to represent the "ancestral" globin.

Results
Overview
The 245 bacterial, 26 archaeal and 49 eukaryote genomes,
and the identified known and putative globins, are listed
in Supplemental Data Tables 1–6 [see Additional File 1].
An alignment of the sequences is provided in Supplemental Data Fig. 1 [see Additional File 2]. All the globins identified in our survey can be assigned to two general classes:
single chain globins and globin domains within chimeric
proteins. The former group comprises the vertebrate αand β-globins, Mbs, Ngbs and Cygbs, the metazoan intraand extracellular Hbs (including multi-domain and/or
multisubunit Hbs), the plant SHbs and NsHbs, the
~195aa Pgbs and the 2/2 Hbs. The two groups of chimeric
proteins, which generally have an N-terminal globin
domain, are the ~400aa FHbs with an NAD and FADbinding C-terminal domain, and the GCSs with highly
variable (~50 to >700a) C-terminal domains. Thus, all
globins belong to one of three globin lineages: the 3/3
FHbs and SDgbs (eukaryote and bacterial), the 3/3 GCSs
and Pgbs and the 2/2 SDgbs [49]. Fig. 1 provides the
number of genomes that have globins and illustrates a key
result: only one of the three globin lineages, the 2/2 Hbs,
are represented in all three kingdoms of life. Fig. 2 shows
the approximate phylogenetic relationships between the
main groups of the three kingdoms of life based on Baldauf et al. [50] and depicts the phylogenomic profile of
globins.

It should be emphasized, that the presence of putative
globins inferred using SUPERFAMILY and blastp and psiblast searches of the GenBank database, does not require
having a completed genome. On the other hand, the
absence of a globin is certain only when a complete
genome is searched and no sequence is found.

Archaea
Table 2 in the Supporting Data [see Additional File 1] lists
the archaeal genomes, their sizes and the presence of globins. SUPERFAMILY identified putative globins in four
Archaea: Halobacterium, Methanobacterium, Methanosarcina
and Sulfolobus. In addition, another globin was identified
in the SWISSPROT/TrEMBL database (tr|Q96ZL6). Examination of these sequences showed that they are not likely
to be globins due to lack of size (< 100aa) and/or the
absence of a suitable F8His. However, Hou et al.

[44.45,48] have recently discovered GCSs and Pgbs in a
couple of archaea, and we found a 2/2 Hb1 in Haloarcula
marismortui [49]. This survey has uncovered a 2/2 Hb1 in
still another euryarcheote halophile Haloferax volcanii.
Thus, only five of the 20 Euryarcheote genomes have globins: Haloarcula marismortui (2/2 Hb1, GCS), Halobacterium
salinarum (GCS), Haloferax volcanii (2/2 Hb1, GCS), Methanosarcina acetivorans and M. barkeri (Pgbs). Of the 5 Crenarcheote genomes, only Aeropyrum pernix, has a globin
(Pgb) and the only Nanoarcheote genome has no globins.

The paucity of globins in Archaea is one of the surprising
results of our survey. Except for Aeropyrum pernix, the
archaeal genomes comprising globins are, coincidentally,
among the largest known archaeal genomes. It is interesting to note that none of the GCSs or Pgbs have been identified by the hidden Markov chain model used by
SUPERFAM, although they align readily with the globin
fold, based on the recent crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis
GCS [51]. Most of the archaeal genomes sequenced to
date have been those of extremophilic organisms with
small genomes. It is now known that there are many more
non-thermophilic terrestrial and marine archaea than
hitherto suspected [52]. It remains to be seen whether
additional archaeal genomes will reverse the situation.

globins: all the Caulobacterales, Rhizobiales (except Bartonella), Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirilalles and Sphingomonadales, but only one of the 10 Rickettsiales
(Pelagibacter ubique). All 24 genomes representing the Betaproteobacteria have globins, except 2 of the 4 Neisseriaceae. The 50 Gammaproteobacteria genomes represent
10 groups, of which only 3 of the 10 Enterobacteriales
(Buchnera, Blochmannia and Wigglesworthia), one of two
Legionellales, the 5 Pasteurellales, the two Psychrobacter of
the 10 Pseudomonadales, and the one Thiotrichales
(Francisella) are devoid of globins. The 10 genomes of
Deltaproteobacteria have globins, except for Desulfovibrio.
Two of the 8 genomes representing the Epsilonproteobacteria have no globins: Helicobacter pylorii and Wolinella;
however, Helicobacter hepaticus has a globin. The lone
unassigned proteobacterium Magnetococcus has a GCS. Of
the 128 genomes representing the Proteobacteria, 99 have
globins (~75%).

Bacteria
Table 3 in Supporting Data [see Additional File 1] lists the
completed and unfinished bacterial genomes used in this
study, their sizes, the type and number of globins present,
2/2 Hbs (classes 1, 2 and 3), FHbs (SDgbs) and GCSs
(Pgbs), and the oxygen requirement and habitat of the
organism. A diagrammatic representation of the phylogenetic relationships between the main bacterial groups
based on Baldauf et al. [50], shown in Fig. 3, summarizes
the globin distribution among the bacteria. The one representative of the Acidobacteria has globins, and only 4 of
the 26 genomes representing the Actinomycetes have
none: Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium, Symbiobacterium
and Trophyrema. The 3 Aquificales/Thermotogales have
globins except Thermotoga, and the 5 Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi (except Cytophaga) lack globins, as well as the 6
Chlamydiae/Verrumicrobium genomes, except Parachlamydia and Verrumicrobium. Of the 3 Chloroflexi
genomes, Dehalococcoides, has no globins. The Cyanobacteria are represented by 12 genomes, of which 5 lack globins: Anabaena, Crocosphaera, Prochlorococcus, Synechocccus
elongatus and Trichodesmium. Both Deinococcus and Thermus have globins. Among the 49 Firmicutes, apart from
the Lactobacillales and the Mollicutes, the 17 Bacilli have
globins (except Listeria), as well as 4 of the 7 Clostridia.
Although Fusobacterium lacks globins, the lone Nitrospirae and the two Planctomycetes have globins. The
majority of the 35 genomes of Alphaproteobacteria have

Alignment of bacterial 2/2 Hb sequences indicates that
they can be divided into three separate classes [16,53]. The
length of the 2/2 Hbs varies from 118aa for the cyanobacterium Nostoc (ZP_00112318) to 260aa in Streptomyces
avermitilis (NP_824492), with the majority (>60) being
<140aa. Examination of coexistence of the three classes of
2/2 Hbs (Table 1) shows an interesting trend: although
only the Alphaproteobacterium Hyphomonas neptunium
has both 1 and 3 and two have all three classes, 14
genomes have classes 1 and 2 and 18 have classes 2 and 3.
These results suggest that the class 1 and 3 2/2 Hbs are
derived from the class 2 2/2 Hbs, as pointed out very
recently by Vuletich and Lecomte [53].
The finding of an FHb in E. coli [7] led to the discovery of
some 30 bacterial FHbs [16,42,43,54]; currently, the
number is over 70 (Supplementary Data Table 3). R.
Poole and his group [43] and Frey and Kallio [42] were
the first to point out the similarity between the FHb
globin domains, the first bacterial Hb to be sequenced,
that of Vitreoscilla stercoraria [55], and several other SD
bacterial globins. We now have a total of 25 SDgbs in 22
genomes. The crystal structures of the P. aeruginosa (PDB:
1tu9) [56] and Vitreoscilla stercoraria (PDB: 2vhb) [57],

show them to be very similar to the globin domains of the
FHbs from E. coli (PDB: 1gvh) [58] and Ralstonia (Alcaligenes) eutropha (PDB: 1cqx) (59]. It is appropriate to note
here that Ralstonia has undergone two name alterations
recently, to Wautersia eutropha and now to Cupriavidus
necator [60]. Although 22 genomes have SDgbs, three of
them have two different globins: Bradyrhizobium, Rhodopseudomonas and Novosphingobium. Table 2 shows that
FHbs and SDgbs coexist in only 6 genomes: Chromobacte-

rium, Photobacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhodopirellula, Thermobifida and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Table 3
shows the statistics of occurrence of 2/2 Hbs with the
FHbs/SDgbs; the latter tend to occur with class 2 and with
both class 2 and 3 2/2 Hbs.

tophilus (3.59 Mbp), each with 3 globins. At the other end
of the scale, the smallest genome (1.31 Mbp) to have a
globin, a 2/2 Hb1, is that of the marine Alphaproteobacterium Pelagibacter ubiques (Rickettsiales), followed by
Aquifex aeolicus (1.59 Mbp), and the Epsilonbacterium
Campylobacter jejuni (1.64 Mbp), with one (SDgb) and
two (2/2Hb and SDgb) globins, respectively.
The bacterial divisions represented by 10 or more
genomes, rank in the following order of having globins:
Betaproteobacteria – 92% (22/24) > Actinobacteria –
85% (22/26) > Gammaproteobacteria – 76% (38/50) >
Alphaproteobacteria – 69% (24/35) > Cyanobacteria –
58% (7/12) > Firmicutes – 49% (19/39). Overall, 161 of
the 245 (~65%) bacterial genomes have globins and the
number of globins varies from 1 to 7.

(197aa) and Thermosynechococcus elongatus NP_682779
(194aa) [48]. Blastp searches found an additional two
dozen GCSs, and Pgbs in Thermus thermophilus
YP_005074 (203aa) and the actinobacterium Rubrobacter
xylanophilus ZP_00200180 (196aa) [49,61]. The recent
crystal structure of B. subtilis GCS shows it to have a 3/3
fold
[62].
The genomes with the largest number of globins, 5 to 7,
are all from the Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria; they do
include however, redundant sequences. The following
have all three lineages of globins:Burkholderia fungorum
(9.67 Mbp), Chromobacterium violaceum (4.75 Mbp), Novosphingobium aromaticivorans (4.21 Mbp) and Silicibacter
sp.TM1040 (4.14 Mbp), each with 5 globins, the three
Bordetella species (4.09–5.34 Mbp), Exiguobacterum
sp.255–15 (2.89 Mbp), Shewanella baltica (5.01 Mbp),
Sinorhizobium meliloti and Thermobifida fusca (3.64 Mbp),
each with 4 globins, and Azotobacter vinelandii (5.42
Mbp), all the Bacillus species (except B. licheniformis and B.
stearothermophilus) (4.20–5.50 Mbp) and Geobacillus kaus-

Fig. 4 depicts the size distribution of bacterial genomes
lacking globins (upper panel) and comprising globins
(lower panel); the stippled columns represent the
genomes associated with a host (given in Supplemental
Data Table 3 [see Additional File 1]). Although the two
distributions overlap, it is evident that presence of globins
is correlated with genome size and that the majority of
genomes lacking globins are host associated. Table 4
shows the mean genome size for completed genomes
lacking globin and with one or more globins. The mean
size of the genomes shows a positive correlation with the
number of globins present. About 80% (65/82) of
genomes <2.5 Mbp lack globins (mean 2.1 Mbp). Very
small genomes are characteristic of bacteria with lifestyles
characterized by continuous association with a host [63].
The majority of the bacteria whose genomes have been
sequenced, are human, animal and plant infectious
agents. Thus, it is likely that the estimate of approximately
two thirds of all bacteria having globins obtained in the
present study, is on the low side.
Eukaryotes
The globins identified in eukaryote genomes are listed in
Supplemental Data Tables 4–6 [see Additional File 1]. The
globins listed for the vertebrate genomes, Danio (Brachydanio) rerio, Fugu (Takifugu) rubripes, Gallus gallus, Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Xenopus tropicalis, include the familiar α- and β-globins and Mb, as well
as the recently discovered Ngbs [33,34] and Cygbs [3537]. A recent addition to human α-globins is µ-globin
(gi|51510893|NP_001003938, 141aa) which appears to
be very similar to the avian α-D globin [64]. In addition,
an eye-specific globin, GbE, was found in Gallus gallus
[39] and a new globin, GbX, was discovered in the fish,
bird and amphibian genomes [40]. Curiously, no Mb-like
sequence was found in either Xenopus tropicalis or X. laevis.
The zebrafish Danio rerio has 6 embryonic globins [65],
three α and three β- only 5 are listed in the GenBank. The

pufferfish Fugu rubripes, appears to have four α-globin
chains [66]; only three of them are listed in the GenBank.
The four globins found in the genome of the urochordate
Ciona intestinalis (sea squirt), have been identified earlier
[32]. This important finding corrects the erroneous claim
of total absence of globins in the report of the genome
[67].
At least one putative globin (gi|72169631|XP_795670,
175aa) was found in the recently completed genome
assembly of the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
(sea urchin). Used as query in blastp searches it hits the
GlbXs and Cygbs of fish, and other vertebrate Cygbs,
before
recognizing
the
coelomic
globin
(gi|729576;P80018) of a fellow echinoderm, the holothurian Caudina arenicola.
There appear to be 4 putative globins in Anopheles gambiae:
gi|55246163|
EAA03862.3
(150aa),
gi|31201271|XP_309583
(192aa),
gi|31198253|XP_308074
(215aa)
and
gi|57914327|XP_555006 (182aa). Their alignment shows
that the first three are closely related, sharing essentially
identical globin domains: gi|55246163 has an 18aa deletion in the BC helix and the CD corner, while
gi|31198253 lacks part of the G and all of the H helices.
Thus, it is likely that gi|31201271 and gi|57914327 are
the only stable globins. The C-terminal 115aa globin
domain of gi|31198253 is reminiscent of the Mb gene
sequence from the antarctic icefish Champsocephalus esox
(gi|24266940|AAN52371, 103aa) that does not appear to
be expressed [68]. It remains to be determined whether
the N-terminal domain of gi|31198253 stabilizes it
enough to be expressed.
At least 33 putative globins and globin domains were
identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, together with their
orthologs in C. briggsae [30]: they are listed in Supplemental Data Table 5 [see Additional File 1]; their alignment is
provided in Supplemental Data Fig. 2 [see Additional File
2]. Several C. elegans/C. briggsae orthologs have unusually
long interhelical inserts between the G and H helices:

40aa in CE01012/CBP03870) (216aa), 21aa in CE01528
(CBP00622) (266aa), 22aa in CE34964/CBP23619
(196aa) and 21aa in CE34658/CBP07299 (230aa).
Although three pairs, CE17437/CBP02580, CE04582/
CBP03989 and CE35828/CBP14482, have N-terminal
globin domains, several have C-terminal domains:
CE03523/CBP15914, CE04843/CBP01576, CE05316/
CBP02907, CE12774/CBP21478), CE36044/CBP02078),
CE29586/CBP02293,
CE30683/CBP02390
and
CE31132/CBP15597. The N-terminal portion of the latter
is identified as a G protein-coupled receptor-like domain
with 7 putative transmembrane helices (identified using
TMHMM Server V.2.0). The nonglobin domains in the
remaining proteins could not be identified via blastp
searches.
Although globin genes were thought to be absent in the
genome of Drosophila melanogaster [69], the presence of at
least one (CG9734) has been demonstrated unequivocally by Burmester and Hankeln [31,70]. There appear to
be two more putative globins, CG15180 (209aa) and
CG14675 (195aa); both provide acceptable alignments.
Three putative globins are also found in D. pseudoobscura,
EAL28410 (152aa), EAL28093 (641aa, 40–150) and EAL
28094 (130aa) [71], and appear to be orthologs of D. melanogaster CG9734, CG15180 and CG14675, respectively.
Although the D. pseudoobscura EAL28093 and EAL28094
are scored by FUGUE as certainly globins (Z ~10), the
former lacks an appropriate F8 His residue and the latter
appears to be missing the A helix. Psiblast searches show
that the ortholog pairs CG15180/EAL28093 and
CG14675/EAL28094) recognize each other but not the
CG9734/EAL28410 pair, and also recognize the Anopheles
globins (ENSANG19788, 22287 and 26474), together
with distant recognition of echinoderm globins and vertebrate β-globins. The CG9734/EAL28410 pair hits the
other known insect globins (Gasterophilus, Chironomus
species, Kiefferulus, Tokunagayusurika), the vertebrate
Cygbs and the arthropod multidomain Hbs.
Three of the four Arabidopsis thaliana sequences, GLBs 1–3
have been identified earlier [19,72]: GLB1 and GLB2 are
NsHbs and GLB3 is a 2/2Hb. A 693aa protein

(gi|7486404|T04457) was found to have an N-terminal
2/2Hb domain, with the first 138aa (up to position H13),
identical to GLB3. Although the ~500aa C-terminal portion does not correspond to any known protein
domain(s), a blastp search using it as query found an
identical sequence in the N-terminal portion of the
2154aa protein TEBICHI (gi|62241195|BAD93700).
Both proteins share the same region on Arabidopsis chromosome 4 and TEBICHI has a helicase domain at 490–
890aa and a polymerase domain at 1700–2150aa; furthermore, this N-terminal portion is missing in animal
homologues of TEB protein, MUS308/POLQ (Dr. Soichi
Inagaki, personal communication).
The genome of Oryza sativa contains the four NsHbs identified by Arredondo-Peter et al. [73,74], a 172aa 2/2Hb
(gi|50725383|BAD32857) and a 145aa globin
(gi|50932383|XP_475719). A blastp search identified the
latter as another NsHbs.
Several putative globins occur in the genome of the green
alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: 160981 (C_240146)
(136aa), 160982 (C_240147) (147aa), 157690
(C_1780015) (231aa), and two larger sequences, 168934
(C_60169) (476aa) with one N-terminal globin-like
domain, and 153190 (C_100138) (837aa) with two consecutive N-terminal globin domains. Two globins were
found in the genome of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum: PTMM3909 and 05212. Two globins occur in the
genome of another diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana,
Scaffold_137 (158aa) and Scaffold_18 (160aa), and a single 185aa globin, CMR319C, in the genome of the red
alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Blastp searches identified all
the C. reinhardtii globins, the Phaeodactylum PTMM 05212
and the Thalassiosira Scaffold_18 as 2/2 Hbs, and the Cyanidioschyzon CMR319C,Phaeodactylum PTMM 3909 and
Thalassiosira Scaffold_137 as SDgbs, closely related to the
bacterial and fungal FHbs and the bacterial SDgbs.
The globins present in the fungi are listed in Supplemental
Data Table 6 [see Additional File 1]. All the recently completed fungal genomes, which belong overwhelmingly to
the Ascomycota (17 of 19), have FHbs; 14 have two to
four FHbs, probably due to genome duplication [75]. In
addition to Saccharomyces cerevisiae NP_014165 (426aa,
154–302) which was known to have a central globin
domain [76], we found an additional 12 FHbs to have
globin domains within the central portion of their
sequences. All belong to the Saccharomycotina: Candida
albicans EAK92722 (563aa, 298–463), Candida glabrata
XP_448033 (432aa, 124–267), Eremothecium (Ashbya)
gossypii NP_982746 (436aa, 184–339), Kluyveromyces lactis XP_453939 (430aa, 181–323), Kluyveromyces waltii
Kwal_22190 (421aa, 171–314) Kwal_4395 (460aa, 202–
352) and Kwal_24852 (543, 173–315), Saccharomyces

bayanus ORFP:20532(424aa, 171–303), Saccharomyces
mikatae ORFP:18051 (410aa, 135–290), Saccharomyces
paradoxus ORFP:18484 (426aa, 155–306) and Yarrowia
lipolytica XP_502881 (463aa, 186–325) and XP_499869
(471aa, 194–333). Although the globin domains align
well with the other FHbs, the N- and C-terminal portions
do not recognize the C-terminal moieties of the other fungal and bacterial FHbs or any other known protein, as
found earlier for the S. cerevisiae FHb [76]. Surprisingly,
the percent identities between the CDFHbs and the fungal
and bacterial FHb globin domains is about 40% and 30%,
respectively.
Among the lower eukaryotes, the diplomonad Giardia
lamblia has one FHb [77] and the mycetozoan Dictyostelium discoideum has two [78]. The Giardia sequence has a
21aa insert between helices E and F.
No globin genes appear to exist in the genomes of the Apicomplexans Entamoeba histolytica and Plasmodium falciparum, as well as the Microsporidian Encephalitozoon
cuniculi and the Euglenazoan Trypanosoma brucei.
Although a Plasmodium bergei globin-like protein of 228aa
(Q86QI8) is listed in the GenBank, it is probably an artefact, since when used as a query in blastp searches, it hits
only vertebrate β- and α-globins.
Compared to Archaea and Bacteria, the fraction of eukaryote genomes with globins is much higher, over 90%.
Although all vertebrates have Hb and Mb and probably
Ngb and Cygb as well [38], the Antarctic icefish belonging
to the family Channichthyidae do not express Hb [79].
Furthermore, at least 6 of the 16 icefish species also do not
express Mb [80]. The lack of Hb is due apparently to deletion of the β-globin gene [81], which occurred during the
last 10 to 16 Myr, the approximate date of divergence of
the Notothenioid lineage including the Channichthyidae
[82]. In contrst, the lack of Mb appears to be due to errors
in Mb gene transcription [68]. It is not known whether the
icefish have Ngbs and/or Cygbs. In the remaining two
chordate phyla, the urochordate Ciona has 4 globins (see
above), which when used as queries in psiblast searches,
recognize the vertebrate globins and the eukaryote and
bacterial FHbs and SDgbs. The report of a Hb in the notochord of the cephalochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma
californiense) [83], suggests that globins are present in all
chordates. Among the remaining deuterostome phyla,
intracellular Hbs have been reported in two of the 5
classes of echinoderms [84,85], and we find a putative
globin in the recent assembly of the genome from the sea
urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, which belongs to
another class. No globins have been reported so far in
hemichordates.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:31

Among the remaining metazoans, direct visual observation of Hbs is highly episodic among the metazoans, and
varies from total absence of Hb in porifera and cnidaria,
to frequent presence in some nematode and platyhelminth groups [3]. In the largest metazoan group, the
insects, of which about 900,000 species have been
described, and which outnumber the combined total of
all other animal species, with estimates ranging from 2 ×
106 to 100 × 106 [86], globins are so far known to be
present only in Dipterans, such as Gasterophilus, Drosophila
and Chironomus. It is evident that much work needs to be
done before we have any clear idea of globin distribution
in metazoans other than deuterostomes.
Among the lower eukaryotes, our census suggests that
globins could be ubiquitous in fungi (FHbs), mycetozoa
(FHbs), diplomonads (FHbs), ciliates (2/2 Hbs), stramenopiles (SDgb, 2/2Hb), rhodophytes (SDgb), chlorophytes (2/2Hb) and plants (SHbs, NsHbs, 2/2 Hbs). In
contrast, the genomes of pathogenic microsporidians,
entamoebae, apicomplexans anad trypanosomes are
devoid of globins. In view of a very large potential diversity of small, bacterial-sized eukaryotes revealed by recent,
culture-independent surveys [87,88], much remains to be
done.
Since our census indicates that GCSs do not occur in
eukaryotes, it is necessary to consider the heme-regulated
eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (~630aa), which
was found recently to have two heme-binding domains,
of which the N-terminal domain was considered to be
globin-like [89,90] Although it was demonstrated that
His78 and His123 were the two residues involved in heme
binding [91], we find that the N-terminal 138aa of the
rabbit protein (gi|462439|P33279|E2AK1 RABIT) is not
recognized as a globin in CD or FUGUE searches. A blastp
search of the GenBank database found at least 6 mammalian counterparts; clearly, a structure is required to determine whether these sequences are globins.
Molecular evolution
The broad distribution of the three lineages of globins, the
3/3 FHbs/SDgbs, the 3/3 GCS/Pgbs and the 2/2 Hbs, is
illustrated in the Bayesian phylogenetic tree shown in Fig.
5, based on a global manual alignment of 175 sequences
representing all the major groups of globins (Supplemental Data Fig. 3, [see Additional File 2]). The 2/2 Hbs and
the GCSs/Pgbs cluster separately (upper left hand side),
with the three classes of 2/2 Hbs clearly delineated.
Within the 2/2Hb clusters, the archaeal (Haloarcula), ciliate (Paramecium) and chlorophyte (Chlamydomonas) globins occur with the class 1 and the diatom (Thalassiosira)
and plant (Oryza, Arabidopsis) Hbs group with the class 2.
The remaining stem encompasses the bacterial and
eukaryotic FHbs and related SDgbs (marked with an aster-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/31

isk), including the Cyanidioschyzon and Thalassiosira
SDgbs, the separate clusters of plant NsHbs and SHbs
(lower right hand side) and all the known metazoan globins, including the vertebrate globins (lower left hand
side). Noteworthy is the clustering of bacterial SDgbs with
the globin domains of bacterial and eukaryote (fungal,
diplomonad and mycetozoan) FHbs, suggestive of past
lateral gene transfer events [49]. Likewise, the clustering of
the archaeal 2/2 Hbs with the class 1 bacterial 2/2 Hbs,
could be indicative of a past lateral gene transfer. Very
recently, a 2/2Hb and an FHb were found in the multicellular red alga Chondrus crispus (X. Bailly et al., unpublished
results): these two sequences cluster with the Thalassiosira
2/2Hb and Aquifex SDgb, respectively. An interesting
result is the close grouping of Amphitrite ornata dehaloperoxidase [92] with the intracellular hemoglobin of the
hydrothermal vent annelid Alvinella pompejana [93], suggesting that the latter may be a dehaloperoxidase also. The
Gallus and Xenopus HbX group with the vertebrate Ngbs as
found earlier [40]. Of particular interest is the large C. elegans globin family: all except F21A3.6 and ZK637.13,
cluster together, and appear to be closest to the vertebrate
Ngbs. ZK637.13 groups with globins from other nematode species, F21A3.6 clusters with crustacean (Daphnia
and Artemia) and platyhelminth (Paramphistomum and
Clonorchis) sequences. It should be noted that the locations of these three globins is dependent on the number
of globin sequences used to construct the phylogenetic
tree.
We have discussed elsewhere [49] the possible evolutionary scenarios for the emergence of the proposed three lineages of globins in two structural classes: (1) the 3-over-3
SD globins and FHbs, (2) the 3-over-3 GCS/Pgbs, and (3),
the 2-over-2 SDgbs. Here, we would like to reiterate our
proposal that all metazoan and plant globins originated
from a SDgb related to the present day bacterial and algal
SDgbs and the N-terminal globin domains of fungal and
bacterial FHbs. This proposal is based on two results, one
of which, is the clustering of all metazoan and plant
sequences with the bacterial and eukaryote FHbs and
SDgbs and separate from the branches encompassing 2/2
Hbs and GCSs/Pgbs, in the Bayesian phylogenetic tree
obtained earlier [49] and in the one shown in Fig. 5.
Another key result, is that bacterial SDgbs and eukaryote
FHb globin domains used as queries in iterated psiblast
searches, recognize (i.e. have E values substantially lower
than threshold) vertebrate globins, particularly Ngbs, and
other metazoan globin groups, ahead of the 2/2 Hbs and
GCSs/Pgbs [49]. Conversely, vertebrate Ngbs as a group,
recognize the bacterial SDgbs ahead of other vertebrate
globins. Furthermore, the tree shown in Fig. 5 is in very
good agreement with recent models of vertebrate globin
evolution [36,62,94], wherein duplication of the ancestral
globin gene resulted in neuroglobin and cellular globin

genes, with subsequent duplication of the latter into cellular and Hb gene loci, followed by additional duplications of the cellular globin locus into Mb and Cygb and of
the Hb gene into the α- and β-globin genes.
The first attempt at defining the molecular phylogeny of
globins [95] was a tree based on 245 sequences, all from
eukaryotes. A subsequent study by Moens et al. [96] based
on 700 sequences, including bacterial ones, proposed that
all globins «evolved from a family of ancestral, ca. 17 kDa
hemeproteins, which displayed the globin fold and functioned as redox proteins». The present survey of extant
globins in the three kingdoms of life provides some interesting additional details: we now know that there are three
lineages of globins, two with a 3/3 α-helical fold and one
with the 2/2 fold, and that only the latter occurs at present
in all three kingdoms of life. Furthermore, it appears likely
that formation of chimeric proteins containing globin
domains occurred, as separate events, prior to the emergence of the three kingdoms of life. There are no obvious
explanations for the absence of FHbs in Archaea and of
GCSs in eukaryotes. Although it is not possible at present
to decide which of the two folds originated from the
other, the occurrence of 2/2 Hbs in all three kingdoms of
life would suggest that it is the ancestral fold. A recent
computational study of plant Hb folding showed that one
of the folding modules of rice 3/3 NsHb overlaps the 2/2
fold of Mycobacterium tuberculosis HbO (class 2) suggesting
that it is an ancient structural feature of globins [97].
Globin function
The pesence of multiple globins in all three kingdoms of
life raises the question of their function, paticularly
among the unicellular organisms. Although a complete
discussion is not possible here, some general observations
can be made, limited to organisms other than Animalia.
The bacterial FHbs appear to have a role primarily in the
detoxification of NO, via two NADH dependent activities,
an NO dioxygenase activity under aerobic conditions, or
an NO reductase activity under anaerobic conditions
[42,43,98-100]. Furthermore, the recent demonstration
that the E. coli FHb binds lipids and is an efficient alkylhydroperoxide reductase, suggests that it may be involved in
the repair of lipid membranes damaged by oxidative/nitrosative stress [101-103]. The function(s) of bacterial
SDgbs appear to be somewhat similar to the FHbs.
Although the function of Vitreoscilla Hb is to increase the
effective intracellular O2concentration under microaerobic conditions [42,104], that of Campylobacter SDgb was
shown recently to function only in NO scavenging and
detoxification and not provide resistance against superoxide or peroxides [105]. In eukaryotes, such as yeasts and
Dictyostelium, FHbs also provide protection against NO
[43,106,78], as well as enhancement of respiration,
directly by functioning as an O2 buffer and indirectly, by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/31

reducing the NO concentration in the mitochondria
which otherwise inhibits respiration [107-110]. In pathogenic microorganisms, FHb provides protection from
human macrophage NO-mediated killing and promotes
the virulence of bacteria, e.g. Salmonella [111], and of
yeasts, Candida [112] and Cryptococcus neoformans, a
worldwide pathogen causing pulmonary infection in animals and humans [113,114]. It is interesting to note, as
suggested by one of the reviewers, that since most of the
Archaea are not pathogenic, they may have dispensed
with the FHbs and their protective role in bacteria.
In plants, the SHbs have been shown to be required for
establishing a low oxygen concentration for the effective
functioning of the bacterial nitrogenase necessary for
nitrogen fixation [115]. Although the role of 2/2 Hbs in
plants is completely unknown, the NsHbs, induced in
plant cells upon exposure to low oxygen concentrations,
are thought to play a role in a metabolic pathway which
also involves nitric oxide and which provides an alternative type of respiration to the mitochondrial electron
transport under hypoxic conditions [116,117].
The GCSs represent one of the four known families of
heme-based sensors [118], and can be subdivided into
two groups, the HemATs and the gene regulators. The
former are aerotactic heme sensors, with a C-terminal
domain that is related to chemotaxis methyl-accepting
proteins. Although Bacillus subtilis HemAT elicits an aerophilic response, that from the archaean Halobacterium
salinarum provides an aerophobic response [44,45]. The
gene regulators have C-terminal domains, some of which
may regulate second messengers and others that have
unknown functions [47,48.59,118]. Although little is
known about the specific function of the Pgbs, they have
a Cys at position E19, similar to globins of the annelids
living in sulfide-rich environments, including deep sea
hydrothermal vents and marine sediments, where this residue has been implicated in sulfide binding [119,120].
Recent studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 2/2 Hbs, HbN
(2/2 Hb1) and HbO (2/2Hb2), indicate that the former
functions in NO detoxification, while HbO, which differs
substantially from HbN in structure [121], is expressed in
association with cell membranes and significantly
enhances respiration, suggesting an interaction with the
electron transport chain [122-126]. It remains to be seen
whether these findings apply to other bacterial 2/2 Hbs.
Although nothing is known about the function of the 2/
2Hb3s, it is safe to assume that it must differ from the
other two classes, since 32 bacteria have two and Mycobacterium avium ssp. tuberculosis and Methylococcus capsulatus
have all three classes of 2/2 Hbs.

Finally, it is appropriate to mention here the case of the
extracellular Hb from the nematode Ascaris suum, an
octamer of two-domain globin chains, long known for its
high oxygen affinity [127], whose function appears to be
that of an NO reductase [128], similar to that of fungal
and bacterial FHbs. Interestingly FUGUE searches using
FHb and SDgb sequences as queries, invariably include
the Ascaris Hb domain 1 structure (1ash) among the highest scoring globin structures. This case provides an additional bit of evidence in support of our proposal that the
FHbs and related SDgbs from bacteria, algae and unicellular eukaryotes, including fungi, are part of one of the three
globin lineages, and the one from which originated all
metazoan globins and all plant SHbs and NsHbs [49].

Conclusion
The phylogenomic profile derived from our survey of
genomes from the three kingdoms of life presented here,
delineates the present day limits of the occurrence of the
three lineages of globins, and provides a clear view of the
work that remains to be done. It appears likely that in contrast to archaea, where ~20% of the known genomes have
globins, the majority of bacteria will be shown to have
globins. Based on the prevailing opinion that all plants
have globins, it is likely that this will also hold true for the
unicellular, photosynthesizing eukaryotes. Globin occurrence in other unicellular eukaryotes is likely to be episodic, just as in the case of nonvertebrate metazoans.
Another obvious conclusion is that globins are mostly
enzymes and less frequently sensors, and that transport of
oxygen is a function that developed relatively recently,
accompanying the emergence of multicellular organisms.
There are at least two more known instances of evolution
from enzyme to transporter. One, is the convergent evolution of indoleamine dioxygenase into a muscle heme protein with Mb-like oxygen binding properties, in gastropod
molluscs [129]. Another are hemocyanins, the copper
containing respiratory proteins in molluscs and arthropods, which have evolved from phenoloxidases, prior to
the divergence of Protostomes and Deuterostomes [130].
The recent finding of hemerythrins, similar to the nonheme iron respiratory protein of Sipunculids, Brachiopods and Priapulids, in the methanotrophic
Gammaproteobacterium Methylococcus capsulatus, and in
other prokaryotes [131], and also in the hydrothermal
vent annelid Riftia pachyptila (X. Bailly et al., unpublished
observations), where they may have an enzymatic function, suggests yet another possible instance.

Methods
Identification of globin sequences
Putative globins and globin domains were identified in
the genomes of 49 eukaryotes, 26 archaea and 245 bacteria, listed in Supplementary Data Table 1, using two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/31

approaches. In one, we examined the gene assignments
based on a library of hidden Markov models [132], listed
on
the
SUPERFAMILY
site
http://supfam.mrclmb.cam.ac.uk, discarded sequences shorter than 100aa
and checked the alignments for the presence of His at Mbfold position F8. In the other, we performed blastp and
tblastn (version 9.2.2) searches with pairwise alignment
[133], of completed and unfinished genomes in the GenBank, using the NCBI Entrez retrieval system http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/, including the genomes of
the rhodophyte (red alga) Cyanidioschyzon merolae http://
merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp, chlorophyte (green algae)
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii http://www.biology.duke.edu/
chlamy/, and the diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum http:/
/avesthagen.szbowler.com and Thalassiosira pseudonana
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/thaps1/thaps1.home.html.
Blastp searches use the Expect value (E) to assess the
matches between the query sequence and each of the
sequences in a database. Thus, E = 0.1 signifies that the
probability of finding by chance, another match with the
query sequence having the same score, is 1 in 10. We
define recognition to be a hit with E < 0.005, the default
threshold, and with the pairwise alignment fulfilling the
following two criteria: proper alignment of the F8 His residues and of helices BC through G. It should be noted that
blastp searches often misalign the E helices when the E7
residues are different, e.g. His and Q; however, the rest of
the alignment is unaffected.
In cases where the identification of a putative globin was
uncertain, searches employing CD-Search v.2.02
[134]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, PFAM [135]http://
www.sanger.uc.uk and FUGUE [136]http://wwwcryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk were used to determine whether the
borderline sequence should be accepted as a globin.
Alignment of sequences
The putative globin sequences were aligned manually,
using the procedure employed earlier in the alignment of
over 700 globins [137], based on the myoglobin fold
[138,139], the pattern of predominantly hydrophobic residues at 37 conserved, solvent-inaccessible positions with
mean solvent-accessible areas of <15Å2 [140], including
33 intra-helical residues defining helices A through H, A8,
A11, A12, A15, B6, B9, B10, B13, B14, C4, E4, E7, E8, E11,
E12, E15, E18, E19, F1, F4, G5, G8, G11, G12, G13, G15,
G16, H7, H8, H11, H12, H15, and H19, the three interhelical residues at CD1, CD4 and FG4, and the invariant
His at F8. Only amino acids which occur at the 33 intrahelical positions in the foregoing alignment were allowed
in the alignment of the putative globin sequences.
Although earlier alignments by Kapp et al. [137] and by
Moens et al. [96] had indicated that there were two invariant residues in globins, F8His and CD1Phe, the 2/2Hb
family can accommodate other hydrophobic residues,

such as Tyr/Met/Leu/Ile/Val at the CD1 position as well as
Ala/Ser/Thr/Leu at the distal E7 position, in addition to
His and Gln [16,20-22]. Hence, in our alignments, we
required a His at the proximal F8 position, a residue at the
distal E7 position in the order of preference
His>Gln>Leu~Thr>Ala~Val~Ser~Tyr, a hydrophobic residue at position CD1 in the order of preference
Phe>Tyr>Leu>Met>Ile>Val. At position C4, usually a Pro,
we accepted Ala or Ser or Thr but not a charged residue. At
the interhelical position CD4, we sought a hydrophobic
residue, when available, and at position FG4 we placed a
hydrophobic residue in the order of preference
Ile>Leu~Val>Met>Phe~Tyr. Furthermore, we avoided
deletions in any of the helical regions and placed no limit
on the number of residues within the interhelical regions.

Molecular phylogeny
Bayesian phylogenetic trees were obtained employing
MrBayes Version 3.1.1 [141]; four chains were run simultaneously for 2000000 generations and trees were sampled every 100 generations generating a total of 20000
trees. PAUP version 4.0b10 [142] was used for viewing
and editing. The JTT transition matrix [143] was used as
the stochastic model of amino acid substitution.
