HIVBrainSeqDB: a database of annotated HIV
envelope sequences from brain and other
anatomical sites

Abstract
Background: The population of HIV replicating within a host consists of independently evolving and interacting
sub-populations that can be genetically distinct within anatomical compartments. HIV replicating within the brain
causes neurocognitive disorders in up to 20-30% of infected individuals and is a viral sanctuary site for the
development of drug resistance. The primary determinant of HIV neurotropism is macrophage tropism, which is
primarily determined by the viral envelope (env) gene. However, studies of genetic aspects of HIV replicating in the
brain are hindered because existing repositories of HIV sequences are not focused on neurotropic virus nor
annotated with neurocognitive and neuropathological status. To address this need, we constructed the HIV Brain
Sequence Database.
Results: The HIV Brain Sequence Database is a public database of HIV envelope sequences, directly sequenced
from brain and other tissues from the same patients. Sequences are annotated with clinical data including viral
load, CD4 count, antiretroviral status, neurocognitive impairment, and neuropathological diagnosis, all curated from
the original publication. Tissue source is coded using an anatomical ontology, the Foundational Model of Anatomy,
to capture the maximum level of detail available, while maintaining ontological relationships between tissues and
their subparts. 44 tissue types are represented within the database, grouped into 4 categories: (i) brain, brainstem,
and spinal cord; (ii) meninges, choroid plexus, and CSF; (iii) blood and lymphoid; and (iv) other (bone marrow,
colon, lung, liver, etc). Patient coding is correlated across studies, allowing sequences from the same patient to be
grouped to increase statistical power. Using Cytoscape, we visualized relationships between studies, patients and
sequences, illustrating interconnections between studies and the varying depth of sequencing, patient number,
and tissue representation across studies. Currently, the database contains 2517 envelope sequences from 90
patients, obtained from 22 published studies. 1272 sequences are from brain; the remaining 1245 are from blood,
lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, colon, lung and other non-brain tissues. The database interface utilizes a
faceted interface, allowing real-time combination of multiple search parameters to assemble a meta-dataset, which
can be downloaded for further analysis.
Conclusions: This online resource, which is publicly available at http://www.HIVBrainSeqDB.org, will greatly
facilitate analysis of the genetic aspects of HIV macrophage tropism, HIV compartmentalization and evolution
within the brain and other tissue reservoirs, and the relationship of these findings to HIV-associated neurological
disorders and other clinical consequences of HIV infection.

Introduction
The population of HIV replicating within a host consists
of independently evolving and interacting sub-populations, as demonstrated by the various degrees of phylogenetic compartmentalization seen across and within
anatomical compartments and various rates of decay in
viral load during HAART therapy [1,2]. Several factors
contribute to this genetic compartmentalization: (i) viral
target cell tropism–HIV infects CD4+ T cells and
macrophages in the periphery, and primarily infects
macrophages and microglia (and rarely, astrocytes) in
the brain [3]; (ii) viral adaptation in response to immune
selection pressures that differ between anatomical compartments [3,4]; (iii) physical barriers such as the bloodbrain barrier [5]; and (iv) variable antiretroviral drug
penetration into different tissues [6,7]. An important
viral sub-population is HIV replicating within the brain
[8-10]. HIV replicating in the brain causes neurocognitive and neuropathological disorders in up to 20-30% of
infected individuals, particularly in later stages of disease; in the era of HAART, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) have emerged as a significant
cause of mortality and morbidity [4,6]. Additionally, the
brain is a sanctuary site for the development of drug
resistance, because poor antiretroviral drug penetration
into the CNS leads to sub-therapeutic drug concentrations and incomplete suppression of viral replication [6].
The primary determinant of HIV neurotropism is
macrophage tropism, which is primarily determined by
genetic variation in the viral envelope (env) gene [8].
Phylogenetically related populations of macrophage-tropic virus are found across brain and other macrophagerich tissues, such as lung and bone marrow [11,12].
Thus, studies of the genetics of HIV replicating in the
brain are pertinent to important clinical aspects of HIV,
as well as the biology of the virus replicating within specific anatomical compartments.
There are several excellent existing repositories of
HIV sequences in the public domain, two of the most
widely used being Genbank at the NCBI [13] and the
HIV Sequence Database at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory (LANL) (http://hiv.lanl.gov). However,
neither is focused on neurotropic virus nor contains
clinical annotations of neurocognitive and neuropathological diagnosis. Though more than 20 publications have
clonally sequenced HIV env from the brain, assembling
a meta-dataset of these sequences presents significant
technical challenges. To address these challenges, we
constructed the HIV Brain Sequence Database (HBSD),
the first comprehensive database of HIV envelope
sequences clonally sequenced from brain and non-brain
tissues, which is publicly available at http://HIVBrainSeqDB.org

The HIV Brain Sequence Database

The HBSD contains 2517 envelope sequences from 90
patients. Sequences were obtained from 22 published
studies (Table 1) ranging in publication date from 1991
to 2009 and in number of sequences per publication
from 1 to over 700. 1272 of these sequences are brainderived; the remaining approximately 1245 are derived
from blood, lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, colon,
lung and other non-brain tissues. 44 independent tissue
types are represented within the database. These tissue
types are grouped into 4 categories: (i) brain, brainstem,
and spinal cord; (ii) meninges, choroid plexus, and CSF;
(iii) blood and lymphoid; and (iv) other (bone marrow,
lung, liver, etc) (Table 2). Figure 1 shows the database
sequence content aligned to the env gene of HXB2. V3
region and near full-length gp120 region sequences
comprise the majority of the database, with approximately 1100 and 800 sequences, respectively. There are
also approximately 200 near full-length env sequences,
150 V4-V5 region, and 100 V1-V2 region. As new publications emerge, facilitated by new sequencing technologies, we expect the size of the HBSD to follow the

completed, we hope to expand the database to include
significant numbers of sequences cloned via single genome amplification.

Collection and assembly of HIV sequences

The HBSD attempts to contain all available, published
HIV sequences meeting stringent inclusion criteria. For
inclusion in the HBSD, sequences must meet the following criteria: (i) be deposited in Genbank; (ii) include
some portion of the HIV env region; (iii) be clonal,
amplified directly from tissue; and (iv) be sampled from
the brain, or sampled from a patient for which the
HBSD already contains brain sequences. We identified
sequences for inclusion both by searching the public
sequence databases–Genbank and the LANL
HIV sequence database–and by identifying publications
that sequenced HIV from the brain. In several cases, we
communicated directly with study authors to encourage
deposition of sequences that had not been previously
submitted to Genbank. Additionally, BLAST alignment
was used to screen for possible contamination with
commonly used lab strains (i.e., ADA, HXB2, JR-CSF,
NL4-3, SF2, BaL, IIIB, MN, SF162, and JR-FL)
Annotation Structure

The HIV Brain Sequence Database contains three
categories of annotations: publication references, patient
and sampling information, and sequence properties
(Table 3). The publication annotations include bibliographic information identifying the study that generated
the sequences. Patient sampling annotations contain
information describing the individual patients, as well as
clinical information at the time of sampling. This information was obtained by manual curation of the original
publications and in some cases direct communications
with the study authors. In cases where multiple studies
examined tissue samples from the same patient, the
resulting sequences are linked to the same patient code
to increase statistical power. Sample timepoint annotations describe the patient’s clinical health status, neurocognitive, neuropathological status, CD4 counts, viral
load, and anti-retroviral treatment history at the time of
sampling. Clone and sequence annotations describe the
individual sequences, the tissue from which they were
cloned, and the method of PCR amplification and cloning. This includes the sequence start and end locations
numbered based on alignment to the HXB2 reference
genome, and tissue source coded using terms from a
formal anatomical ontology. Alignment to HXB2 was
performed using the HIV Sequence Locator tool located
at the LANL HIV Sequence Database (http://hiv.lanl.
gov). Currently, amplification and cloning methods
included in the database are: bulk PCR then cloning
(1736 sequences) and limiting-dilution PCR then cloning
(781 sequences). As new sequencing projects are

Annotation of Tissue Type

Annotation of tissue source presented several challenges.
First, the granularity of tissue annotation varied by publication–we encountered tissue type annotations as general as “Brain” and as specific as “White matter of
occipital lobe”. However, within the HBSD a search for
a more general tissue type, such as cerebrum should
also return sequences from sub-parts of the cerebrum,
such as caudate nucleus and putamen. Second, publications utilize non-standard tissue names that are humanreadable but difficult to parse in a database search. To
address these challenges, we utilized a formal anatomical
ontology, the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) to
code tissue source [14]. The FMA defines terms for
approximately 75,000 human anatomical structures, ranging in scale from biological macromolecules to whole
organ systems. These terms are linked by ontological
relationships defining subpart relationships, allowing the
calculation of transitive closure within the database. In
addition, we assigned sequences into one of four classes:
(i) Brain; (ii) Meninges, choroid plexus, and CSF;
(iii) Blood and lymphoid; and (iv) Other. Meninges,
choroid plexus, and CSF were grouped separately from
Brain because phylogenetic evidence suggests that the
CSF represents an intermediate compartment, containing virus from both the brain and periphery [8]. “Other”
includes organs such as lung, liver, stomach and prostate, bone marrow, and fluid samples such as lung
epithelial lining fluid.
Annotation of Neurocognitive and Neuropathological
Diagnosis

Neurocognitive and neuropathological status were classified for each patient at the sampling timepoint, usually
perimortem (Table 4). Neuropathological and neurocognitive disorders can be due either to virus replicating in
the brain or to non-HIV related causes such as toxoplasmosis, CMV encephalitis, or CNS lymphoma. Neuropathological status was coded as HIV encephalitis
(HIVE) of varying severity, lymphocytic perivascular
cuffing, or “Other”, specifying the predominant nonHIV neurological pathology. Neurocognitive diagnosis
was annotated using the nomenclature consensus published in Antinori et al, 2007 [4]. We further classified
the HAD diagnosis into mild, moderate, and severe to
capture information included in the publication as mild,
moderate, or severe (most commonly) or MSK scores
(rarely). Additionally, there were several unique cases
that fell outside the AAN or HNRC criteria, but which
we felt were important to annotate within the database.

HXB2 numbering

sequences are not internally aligned so gaps are not represented. The x-axis shows HXB2 nucleotide numbering with a schematic of the env
gene plotted above. The y-axis shows arbitrary numbering of the plotted sequences.

Diagnosis for patient 196 stated: “insufficient information for patient 196 for the diagnosis of HAD, though
there was evidence for neuropsychiatric disease.”[15].
Given that we lacked the further information to meet
the strict criteria for an ANI or MND diagnosis, we
chose the more general NPI: unknown defined in
Woods et al. 2004 [16]. Diagnoses for patients 1 through
6 stated, “Clinical material was obtained from six HIV-1
infected patients with significant neurological signs and
symptoms requiring image-guided stereotactic brain
biopsy for definitive diagnosis. ... Neurological signs and
symptoms were consistent with the onset of global neurological dysfunction, with clinical evidence supporting
acute rather than chronic HIV-1-associated neurological
disease.”[17]. As an acute diagnosis, this does not fit the
criteria for HAD, so it was annotated in the database as
acute HIV encephalopathy [17].
Design and Implementation

The HBSD structure is sequence-centric and uses NCBI
GI and Genbank accession numbers as identifiers, simplifying correlations with other databases. The database
exists in two forms. The master version is kept internally as a relational SQL database utilized for sequence
management and curation. This is replicated to an
external interface that uses the Apache Solr search platform to optimize for flexible search and data retrieval.
The search interface (Figure 2) is based on a filtering
paradigm; the user begins with the set of all sequences
and narrows by applying filtering criteria to the
sequence annotations. Filtering criteria are specified by
two means. A faceted search interface presents all values

for categorical annotations, such as tissue class or neurocognitive status. Clicking on a value adds it to the
search criteria and filters for matching sequences. Additionally, a global search box allows direct entry of search
terms. Multiple searches in the global search box
sequentially add filtering criteria, allowing the construction of complex searches. Sequences are initially presented with a default set of annotations, however, users
can select to add or remove columns from the set of all
annotations available. The final filtered set of sequences
and annotations can be downloaded for local analysis in
tab-separated and FASTA formats.
Visualization of the contents of the database

To better understand the highly complex network of
publications, patients, and sequences, we used Cytoscape
to visualize the connections between patients and the
publications that sequenced virus from those patients
(Figure 3). This network visualization demonstrates that,
while most publications examine a unique set of
patients, there is an emerging network of patients from
the Edinburgh MRC HIV Brain and Tissue Bank (coded
as NA#) that are shared among multiple publications.
Additionally, Figure 3 illustrates the dramatic differences
in sequencing depth between patients, and in number of
patients between studies.
Many experimental designs examining compartmentalization or tissue specific effects depend on overlap in the
viral regions sequenced and matched tissue source. In
order to quantify the power of the database to make
these comparisons, we visualized the total number of
across-tissue and within-tissue comparisons possible with

overlapping sequences. Each comparison is ontologically
inclusive–for example entries under Frontal lobe also
consider sequences from White matter of frontal lobe,
Cortex of frontal lobe, etcetera. This visualization reveals
structures within the dataset useful for experimental
design. For example, while a large number of patients
contain overlapping sequences from lymph node and
another tissue, in 8, 11, and 7 patients, respectively, it is
possible to compare frontal lobe to occipital, temporal, or
parietal lobes. Figure 4B is a complementary visualization
counting the number of pairwise patient to patient

comparisons possible within each tissue type. This illustrates, for example, that while many patients have overlapping sequences from the cerebrum, frontal lobe is a
particularly well-represented tissue. Conversely, though
the database contains sequences from the cerebellum,
there are no across patient comparisons that can be
made. The numbers in both A and B of Figure 4 do not
represent simple sums or permutations, because each
considers sequence overlap. If hypothetical patients A, B,
and C contained full-length env, V3 region, and V5
region sequences, respectively, then only 2 pair-wise
comparisons would be possible (A to B and A to C), not
the 3 given by a simple permutation.

Discussion
The HBSD is a public database designed to facilitate the
assembly of a large meta-dataset of HIV env sequences
that will be invaluable to investigations into the different
patterns of viral evolution in the brain and other tissue
reservoirs, and the relationship of these findings to each
other and to clinical consequences of HIV infection,
particularly development of HAND. The database contains 2517 env sequences cloned from 90 patients and
44 tissues sources. 1272 of these sequences are brainderived; the remaining 1245 are derived from blood,
lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, colon, lung, and
other non-brain tissues. The majority of these sequences
are from the V3 region (45%) or near full-length gp120
region (31%), with the remainder being near full-length
env (9%), V4-V5 region (6%), V1-V2 region (4%) and
others (5%) (Figure 1). The HBSD is unique compared
to other sequence databases, such as the LANL HIV
Sequence Database or Genbank, because of its specific
focus on HIV in the brain, its stringent inclusion of only
clonal sequences from patients with brain sequences,
and its rigorous curation with detailed clinical, patient,
and HAND annotations.

An HIV env meta-dataset annotated with detailed
clinical information will allow studies that previously
have not been feasible. Combining datasets to increase
the number of sequences and tissue-types increases the
statistical power available. This increased statistical
power can be used to examine questions such as the
genetic variations within env important for macrophage
tropism, which is the primary requirement for HIV
replication in the brain, and nucleotide positions within
env under positive genetic selection during HIV replication in the CNS. Annotation of neurocognitive status,
neuropathological status, and AIDS progression will
facilitate correlation of viral genotype to clinical phenotypes, and may help to reveal how viral genotypes affect
the development of HAND.
During the assembly and annotation of the HBSD, we
encountered a number of challenges. Non-uniform tissue coding made consistent database annotation difficult. To overcome this obstacle, we utilized the FMA
anatomical ontology to convert various tissue source
descriptions into a set of defined terms with ontological
linkages. We encountered several instances of ambiguous patient coding. Because tissue samples are shared

that were coded differently by multiple studies
(NA118_p5, NA420_p6 and NA21_UK1) and 2 cases of
separate patients that were coded identically by different
studies (NA20 and NA234). Combining sequences from
multiple publications and grouping by patient can
increase the diversity of tissue types and the depth of
sequencing available, while carefully tracking patient
coding can avoid incorrect grouping of non-identical
patients. Many publications included in the HBSD contain duplicate sequences cloned from the same tissue
sample. These duplicate sequences could result either
from PCR resampling in studies utilizing bulk PCR
before cloning, or could represent valid cloning of
copies of a majority viral variant. Fifteen publications
utilized bulk PCR then cloning, 5 utilized limiting dilution then cloning, and 2 used both approaches, based
on patient. The database contains 490 repeated

sequences in 161 groups. However, 217 of these
repeated sequences were obtained by limiting dilution
PCR and therefore are unlikely to represent PCR resampling. Comparison of the distribution of the percentage
of duplicated sequences between bulk PCR and limiting
dilution demonstrated that studies utilizing bulk PCR
then cloning did not show a higher rate of sequence
duplication than those utilizing limiting dilution (data
not shown). Thus duplicated sequences in the database
likely represent appropriate cloning of majority viral
variants.
The HBSD includes several unique datasets, which,
though previously available in the public domain, are
now collected in a standardized annotation format for
meta-analysis. 15 patients included in McCrossan, 2006
[18] are pre-symptomatic, having died from HIV-unrelated causes [alcohol/drug overdose (n = 11), cirrhosis
(n = 2), suicide (n = 1), and bronchopneumonia
(n = 1)]. During late-stage AIDS, declining CD4 counts
lead to immune deficiency and reduced selection pressure, allowing viral population expansion that may alter
the distribution of sequence variants. Based on

Figure 3 Network representation of interconnections between publications, the patients they sequenced, and the number and tissue
classes of sequences available for each patient. The network was constructed using Cytoscape. Black nodes, containing the name of the first
author, represent publications. Publication nodes are connected by edges to the patients they sequenced, represented by clear nodes with
patient code printed at the bottom. In cases where multiple publications sequenced virus from the same patient, multiple publication nodes
connect to a single patient node (patient NA118 in the upper right). Individual HIV sequences for each patient are represented by the colored
dots within patient nodes: Brain-red, Meninges, choroid plexus, and CSF-yellow, Blood and Lymphoid-green, Other-blue. The total number of
sequences for each patient scales the size of the patient node.

treatment history and year of death, the majority of
patients in the HBSD died prior to the HAART era. 49
out of 90 patients have annotations for antiretroviral
treatment history. Of these 49 patients, 19 are drug
naïve and 30 received antiretroviral drugs. The majority
of antiretroviral treated patients were on pre-HAART
regimens, and 9 received only AZT. Different ART
drugs have differing CNS penetration, affecting selection
pressures on virus replicating in the brain [6]. Additionally, the majority of neurocognitive diagnoses occurred
before the 2007 HNRC consensus document [4] that
defined criteria for asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI). Future improvement of the quality and
relevance of the database to the current epidemic
requires generating more sequences sampled from the
brains of pre-symptomatic patients at earlier stages of
disease and HAART-treated patients.

Our laboratory will continue to maintain the HBSD as
new sequences are deposited in the public domain. We
expect the HBSD to expand in several ways. New deep
sequencing projects will increase the number of
sequences and expand the diversity of patients, sampling
a wider spectrum of stages of disease and HAART
treatment regimens. Curation of patient coding may
allow us to identify longitudinal sets of sequences
sampled from the periphery, which can be paired with
brain sequences sampled from the same patient at
autopsy. Finally, we chose to focus on env for the initial
database release because it plays a key role in brain
infection and provides a tractable scope for development of a highly curated database. As we consider
further database additions, we will continue to weigh
the benefits of inclusion against the resources required
to maintain our high standards of database curation.

Figure 4 Heatmap representation and counts of all possible comparisons between sets of overlapping sequences within the database.
Counts of possible comparisons were generated using 2 custom Perl scripts and SQL statements, then visualized as a heatmap using R. A.
Number of patients for which within-patient comparisons across tissue-types can be made. For pairs of tissues from the X and Y-axis, numbers
indicate the number of patients for which overlapping sequences from both tissues are available. For example, there are 11 patients with
overlapping sequences from both Frontal lobe and Temporal lobe. B. Number of possible pair-wise comparisons across patients within each
tissue type. For each tissue on the Y-axis, numbers indicate the count of possible pair-wise comparisons between patients. For example, there
are 2 patients with overlapping sequences from White matter of neuroaxis, giving 1 possible comparison, and 4 patients with overlapping
sequence from Left occipital lobe, giving 6 possible pair-wise comparisons. Tissue definitions are ontologically inclusive, i.e. Frontal lobe also
includes White matter of frontal lobe, Cortex of frontal lobe, etc. Cells are colored as a heat map accentuating high values, and range from light
yellow (low values) to dark red (high values). Black indicates no comparisons possible.

Tat and nef are two logical next steps, as these genes
influence brain infection and development of neurocognitive disorders. Drug resistance mutations in pol and
RT would also be a useful addition that will be considered in the future.

Conclusions
The HBSD is a unique resource for the research community investigating unique genetic and biological characteristics of HIV in the brain. Though nearly all the
sequences and annotations included were previously

Holman et al. AIDS Research and Therapy 2010, 7:43

available in the public domain, the data did not exist in
a well-annotated and accessible format and its assembly
and curation represented a significant hurdle. The
HBSD will be an invaluable resource for studying the
viral genetics of HIV evolution within the brain and
other tissue reservoirs, and the relationship of these
findings to each other and to the development of HIVassociated neurocognitive disorders.
