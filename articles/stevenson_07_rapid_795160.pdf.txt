Abstract
Background: Cancer/testis (CT) genes are normally expressed only in germ cells, but can be
activated in the cancer state. This unusual property, together with the finding that many CT
proteins elicit an antigenic response in cancer patients, has established a role for this class of genes
as targets in immunotherapy regimes. Many families of CT genes have been identified in the human
genome, but their biological function for the most part remains unclear. While it has been shown
that some CT genes are under diversifying selection, this question has not been addressed before
for the class as a whole.
Results: To shed more light on this interesting group of genes, we exploited the generation of a
draft chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) genomic sequence to examine CT genes in an organism that is
closely related to human, and generated a high-quality, manually curated set of human:chimpanzee
CT gene alignments. We find that the chimpanzee genome contains homologues to most of the
human CT families, and that the genes are located on the same chromosome and at a similar copy
number to those in human. Comparison of putative human:chimpanzee orthologues indicates that
CT genes located on chromosome X are diverging faster and are undergoing stronger diversifying
selection than those on the autosomes or than a set of control genes on either chromosome X or
autosomes.
Conclusion: Given their high level of diversifying selection, we suggest that CT genes are primarily
responsible for the observed rapid evolution of protein-coding genes on the X chromosome.

Background
Cancer/testis (CT) genes are a growing family of genes
defined by a unique pattern of expression: amongst normal tissues, they are expressed only in cells of the germ
line and in embryonic trophoblasts, but their gene products are also found in a significant number of malignant

cancers [1]. The first CT genes were discovered because of
the immune responses that they elicit in some cancer
patients, and can thus be classified as CT antigens [2,3];
systematic exploration of publicly available gene expression profiles (as documented in EST libraries, SAGE and
MPSS data, and microarray experiments) uncovered a sig-

nificant number of additional CT genes [4,5], against
most of which immune responses have not yet been documented. Nevertheless, all CT genes are in principle
attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy, because the
gonads are immunoprivileged organs and anti-CT
immune responses will therefore target tumours specifically. Vaccination using peptides derived from the NYESO-1 (CTAG1B) and MAGEA1 CT genes has already been
proven to bring clinical benefits to melanoma patients
[6,7].
CT genes comprise more than 240 members from 70 families, and can be subdivided into two broad categories
based on chromosomal localization. CT-X genes are
located on the X chromosome, are mostly members of
gene families organized into complex direct and inverted
repeats, and are expressed primarily during the spermatogonial stage of spermatogenesis [8]. Non-X CT genes are
located on autosomes, are mostly single-copy genes, and
are expressed primarily during the meiotic and reduction
division stages of spermatogenesis [8]. Careful annotation
of the sequence of the human X chromosome has revealed
that as many as 10% of all genes present on the chromosome are members of known CT families [9]; further analysis of the expression patterns of genes of unknown
function located in repeated regions could even increase
this estimate [5]. The biological functions of most CT-X
genes have not been characterized in any detail. However,
evidence is emerging that the best studied of these, the
MAGE genes, can act as signal transducing transcriptional
modulators. Moreover, MAGE genes appear to be able to
mediate proliferative signals [10-12] and a member of the
GAGE family has been shown to repress apoptosis [13],
thus directly contributing to the malignant phenotype
when aberrantly expressed in cancer. Available data suggest that many CT genes are involved in the re-programming of the transcriptional machinery that occurs during
the transition from mitotic to meiotic division during
spermatogenesis. It has been suggested that a similar reprogramming may be responsible for some of the phenotype of malignant cancer cells [8,14].
There is mounting evidence that the evolutionary history
of the human X chromosome is significantly different
from that of autosomes. It contains a disproportionate
number of tandem and interspersed segmental duplications, both direct and inverted, containing genes with a
testis-specific expression pattern including many CT-X
genes [9]. These duplications are unstable in the genome,
and subject to copy number polymorphisms, both within
the human population and between humans and chimpanzees [15,16]. While its overall DNA sequence has
diverged significantly less than that of autosomes since
speciation of hominoids from chimpanzees [17], a significant proportion of protein-coding genes located on the X

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/129

chromosome are under higher diversifying (positive)
selection than those on autosomes [18]. Genes located on
the X chromosome are also the most abundant source of
functional retrogenes in the primate lineage, and constitute a reservoir of genetic material for the generation of
new genes and functions in this lineage, again with a bias
toward testis-specific functions [19,20].
For all of these reasons, it is of interest to trace the evolutionary history of CT genes, and particularly of the CT-X
subset, and to measure the selective pressures that act on
them. Many of the human CT-X genes do not have easily
identifiable orthologues in the mouse, rat or dog
genomes, precluding such an analysis among Eutheria
using currently available genome data. For example, it has
been shown that the large MAGE family of CT-X genes has
expanded independently in the primate and rodent lineages [21]. The recent availability of a draft genome for the
chimpanzee has made it feasible to study the evolution of
the CT genes within the primate lineage. We show here
that the CT genes in general and the CT-X genes in particular are under strong diversifying pressure and amongst
the fastest-evolving genes in the human genome.

Results
Identification of CT gene families in chimpanzee
To date at least seventy CT gene families, many with multiple members, have been identified in human. We took
the opportunity afforded by the publication of the initial
sequence of the chimpanzee genome [18] to ask whether
CT genes were conserved in man's closest evolutionary
neighbour. To this end we assembled a list of human transcript sequences representing all CT gene families, and
searched for homologous sequences in the human and
chimpanzee genomes. We expected that given the relatively short time elapsed since human-chimpanzee divergence (~ 6 million years ago [17]) the human sequences
would be able to detect CT gene homologues in the chimpanzee genome. Moreover, since the majority of CT genes
isolated thus far were detected and characterized using
transcript information via cDNA cloning protocols, performing the same search in human allowed us to identify
all CT genes present in the current assembly of the human
genome. We implemented a two-stage approach in order
to accurately define the structure of each CT gene locus.
First, we used MegaBlast [22] to search for regions homologous to the CT transcript sequences. Then we applied the
SIBsim4 cDNA to genome alignment program (an
improved version of sim4 [23]) to these regions to establish a gene structure from a locus-specific spliced alignment (see Methods). As can be seen in Table 1, almost all
human CT families are found in chimpanzee, and the
chromosomal locations of the CT genes in chimpanzee
correspond to those in human. In terms of copy number,
the biggest family, PRAME, is well represented in chim-

CT gene families are presented in numerical order according to proposed nomenclature [1]. The largest family, PRAME, has not yet been assigned
official CT designation. Total gene number for each family was determined according to sequence identity and completeness (see Methods).
Numbers in brackets denote the number of intronless gene copies, which in the case of multi-exon genes may indicate putative retrocopy genes.

panzee (37 genes), as are MAGEA (9 genes) CTAGE (15
genes), XAGE (12 genes) and SSX (8 genes). The number
of CT genes in each family is probably underestimated
because of the relatively low sequence coverage in the current version of the chimpanzee genome assembly. This is
especially true for the X chromosome, where the sequence
coverage is only about 2-fold [18], and where most of the
human multi-gene CT families are located. Nevertheless,
the current data indicate that some chimpanzee CT families (FTHL17/CT38, TSPY/CT78 and PRAME) may contain more members than in human.
In order to investigate more closely the relatedness of CT
genes in these two species, we sought putative human and
chimpanzee orthologues for as many CT genes as possible, based on nucleotide sequence identity to the cognate
human transcript sequence. Ninety-eight orthologous CT
pairs were defined in this way (see Methods and additional file 1). The average identity of the human and
chimpanzee orthologues to the human transcript
sequences was 99.6% and 97.8%, respectively. Since we
were interested in the characteristics of CT genes as a
group, we also defined a group of human-chimpanzee
orthologous non-CT control genes from chromosome X,
where most of the CT genes are located, and from autosomal chromosomes 18 and 19 (see Methods). The reasons for choosing a limited set of control genes were twofold: first, this allowed us to generate manually curated
alignments of the same quality as for the CT genes, and
second, it provided test and control groups of similar sizes
for statistical analysis. The average identity of the human
and chimpanzee control orthologues to the human transcript sequences was 99.6% and 98.7%, respectively. The
finding that the chimpanzee and human CT orthologues
were on average less closely related than the control orthologues (97.8% versus 98.7%; p < 2.2e-16 by a chi-squared
test) suggested a possible difference in the divergence rates
between the CT group and the control group. We tested
this by analysing the substitution rates between human
and chimpanzee ORF sequences (see below). Given the

high accuracy of the human genomic sequence, the finding that the average human identity was less than 100%
for both CT genes and non-CT control genes presumably
reflects polymorphisms and/or sequencing errors in the
original transcript sequences.
CT genes on chromosome X are evolving faster than those
on other chromosomes
We estimated the divergence rates of the CT genes from
pairwise sequence alignments of the human and chimpanzee orthologues using phylogenetic analysis (PAML
package [24]). Mutations in a protein-coding gene can
either have no effect (synonymous changes) or alter the
sequence of the encoded protein (non-synonymous
changes). The rate of synonymous changes (dS) indicates
the background mutation frequency, while the ratio of the
non-synonymous to synonymous mutation rates (dN/dS)
indicates the type of evolutionary pressure acting on the
gene. A dN/dS ratio value less than 1 suggests negative or
purifying selection, a ratio equal to 1 suggests neutral evolution, and a ratio greater than 1 suggests positive or diversifying selection [25]. To test what type of evolutionary
pressure might be acting on the CT genes, we aligned the
ORFs in the human-chimpanzee orthologue pairs and
used the codeml program from the PAML package [24] to
estimate the dN/dS ratios. Again, for comparison purposes, the control genes were subjected to an identical
procedure. Figure 1 shows the distribution of dN/dS ratios
for the CT genes and controls by chromosomal location.
In contrast to the control genes, which show the distribution of ratios expected if most genes are under purifying
selection, CT genes located on chromosome X have an
excess of ratios greater than one. At the level of individual
genes, SSX1, PAGE2B, SSX4, MAGEB2, GAGE4 and
CPXCR1 have rate ratios greater than 2, indicative of
strong evolutionary selective pressure acting on the gene
products (Table 2). CT genes located on chromosomes
other than chromosome X (CT-nonX) have a distribution
of ratios skewed towards lower values, suggesting that this
subgroup is evolving slower than the CT-X genes. In con-

Synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) nucleotide substitution rates were estimated using codeml from PAML [24] as described in Methods.
Genes are presented by chromosomal location. 'â' denotes cases in which the dN/dS ratio cannot be calculated because the number of
synonymous substitutions between the human and chimp sequences is zero.

trast, the majority of control genes, irrespective of chromosomal location, have rate ratios less than 0.5,
suggestive of purifying selection. In addition, the nonsynonymous substitution rates for CT genes which had no
synonymous changes between human and chimpanzee
was on average higher than for the controls (see additional file 2).
The apparent difference between the dN/dS distributions
for the CT genes and the controls was assessed for significance using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, which
indicates whether the medians of the two populations are
significantly different. The difference in dN/dS values
between all CT genes and all controls is highly significant
with a p-value of 1.128e-11 (Table 3). Moreover, the difference between CT genes and the controls is significant
whether the CT genes are located on chromosome X (p =
4.686e-10) or not (p = 1.498e-05). The distribution of

dN/dS values is also significantly different for CT genes on
chromosome X compared to those elsewhere (p = 2.812e05), suggesting that there is stronger selective pressure on
CT genes located on chromosome X. In contrast, there is
no significant difference in the distribution of dN/dS
ratios between the control genes located on chromosome
X or elsewhere (p = 0.4962). Previous work has shown
that the protein-coding genes on the hominid X chromosome have a higher average dN/dS value than other chromosomes [18]. Our results suggest that the CT genes
contribute strongly to this difference, and thus to the
rapid evolution of protein-coding genes on the X chromosome.

Discussion
Several recent publications have taken advantage of the
chimpanzee draft genome to identify genes that are under
diversifying selection in the primate lineage ([26] and refPage 6 of 11

erences therein). Their conclusions were concordant, in
that they identified the X chromosome as containing a
high number of positively selected genes, they found that
positively selected genes are predominantly testis-specific,
and that their functions are linked to gametogenesis as
well as sensory perception and immunity against invading
pathogens. Because most of these studies were performed
at the whole genome level, they tended to focus on genes
for which orthologues could be easily identified and pairwise alignments of coding regions generated automatically. This may explain why they failed to identify CT

genes as a dominant group of positively selected genes. A
review of recently published literature confirms that only
a limited number of CT genes have been recognised as
undergoing positive selection (Table 4). Moreover, a large
proportion were identified through investigation of individual CT gene families (SPANX [27] and PRAME [28]). In
the present study, we have focused on the comparison
between human and chimpanzee CT genes, with an
emphasis on generating high-quality manually curated
data. This was made necessary by the fact that many CT
genes are located within segmental duplications and
hence have multiple paralogues, and that we tried to be
exhaustive in our analysis of all known CT gene families.
Because of the large number of gaps that remain in the
current assembly of the chimpanzee genome and the relatively high stringency we imposed on the extent of the
alignments, we have certainly underestimated the number

of CT homologues present in the chimpanzee genome,
and some of the human:chimpanzee pairs may not correspond to true orthologues. However, neither of these
problems should significantly affect the main conclusions
of our study.
Given the close evolutionary kinship between humans
and chimpanzees it is not surprising that all known CT
gene families are shared between the two species. On the
other hand, homologues of many CT antigens have not
been found outside the primate lineage so far, and the
available genome data are still too sparse to track the
appearance of CT gene families during mammalian evolution. Even though the data are still incomplete, it is clear
that most CT gene families are undergoing copy number
expansions in the primate lineage, presumably driven by
non-allelic homologous recombination between segmental duplications. The best-studied CT family in this respect
is SPANX, which is present as a single-copy gene in
rodents and has duplicated and acquired new sub-families in the primate lineage, including at least one (SPANXC) found to be specific to humans on the basis of its
genomic position [27]. SPANX genes have been shown to
have copy number polymorphisms in the human population, potentially linked to susceptibility to prostate cancer,
and to undergo very rapid evolution affecting both dN
and dS [29]. An elegant study of the PRAME cluster on
human chromosome 1 [28] revealed the recent expansion
in the human lineage of these genes via two large segmental duplications, and subsequent smaller duplications that
may be polymorphic in the human population. The large
MAGE family of CT antigens, which also comprises genes
that do not show a CT expression pattern, has expanded
in both the primate and rodent lineages, but independently [21]. Our data also show that many MAGE genes are
under diversifying selection (Table 2).
By definition, CT genes are expressed in testis, and for
those for which data exists expression has been shown to
be restricted to cells involved in spermatogenesis. It is
believed that many CT genes are also expressed during
oogenesis, but data on this process are still very sparse
[30,31]. There is abundant evidence in the literature that
many genes expressed predominantly during gametogenesis, as well as those implicated in reproduction in general
(e.g. those encoding proteins found in the seminal fluid
or expressed predominantly in the prostate) are undergoing positive selection during evolution [32-34]. In this
respect, CT genes seem to behave much like other reproductive genes.
However, the CT-X genes are a special case, in that diversifying selective pressure seems more intense on this class.
It is probable that the evolutionary pressures driving
changes in the encoded protein sequences and those driv-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/129

ing the expansion of the CT-X gene families are similar.
Strikingly, the X chromosome is enriched in intrachromosomal tandem segmental duplications relative to autosomes [9]. Several hypotheses have been put forward to
explain why a subset of genes located on the X chromosome is evolving faster than those on autosomes [34-36].
Our data do not shed new light on this subject. However,
it is interesting to note that CT-X genes contribute very significantly to the high average positive selection observed
in protein-encoding genes on this chromosome, against a
genomic background that is much more highly conserved
than on the autosomes [17]. One may speculate that transcriptional controls on recently duplicated genes could be
relaxed relative to the parental copies, thereby allowing reexpression in tumours and the partial replication in these
tumours of the transcriptional changes accompanying
gametogenesis.

Conclusions
Essentially all human CT families have homologues at the
same chromosomal locations in the chimpanzee genome.
The copy numbers in the multi-gene CT families may differ between the two species but until a high-quality assembly of the chimpanzee genome is available this cannot be
assessed in a reliable way. On the average, CT genes are
under stronger positive selection than a set of randomly
selected control genes. CT-X genes as a group are evolving
very rapidly, not only relative to control genes on the X
chromosome or on autosomes, but also relative to autosomal CT genes.

Methods
CT genes and human/chimpanzee genomic sequences
Human Reference sequence (RefSeq [37]), or GenBank
(where no RefSeq was available) entries were obtained for
transcripts representing all documented CT gene families
in the CT Gene Database [38]. Transcript sequences were
also obtained for additional candidate CT genes described
in recent publications, which have not yet been added to
the CT Gene Database. In some cases, multiple alternatively spliced transcript sequences from the same gene
were selected to maximize sequence representation of the
locus. Although PRAME has not been designated a CT
gene, due to its trace level of expression in some normal
adult tissues other than testis, it does exhibit the other
main characteristics of CT genes, i.e. strong expression in
the testis and up-regulation in various tumours, and was
included in the set of CT genes selected for this study.
Non-CT control genes were randomly chosen from lists of
genes having a RefSeq identifier on chromosomes X, 18
(low gene density) and 19 (high gene density), generated
using BioMart [39,40]. Control genes were selected from
locations distributed uniformly along the lengths of the
chromosomes to average out site-specific differences in
mutation rates. The human (Homo sapiens) genomic

Identification of CT gene loci in human and chimpanzee
CT gene loci were identified in both human and chimpanzee based on sequence identity between the human transcript sequences and human or chimpanzee genomic
sequences. We used MegaBlast [22] to identify genomic
regions homologous to the RefSeq sequences and SIBsim4
[41] (an improved version of sim4 [23]) to produce high
quality spliced alignments at those sites, from which
locus-specific transcript sequences were generated. A gene
was considered complete if the alignment contained at
least 80% of the cognate transcript length or 80% of the
annotated open reading frame (ORF), and had at least
85% identity to the human transcript sequence. Putative
orthologues were identified as the sequences in human
and chimpanzee genomes having the highest identity
(and satisfying the 80% length threshold) to the same
human transcript sequence. In many cases the poor quality (gaps, incorrect assembly) of the published chimpanzee genome sequence prevented us from finding a
chimpanzee orthologue to the human gene. High quality
sequence alignments for putative human/chimpanzee
orthologues were obtained for 98 of the initial list of 135
CT genes (73%) and 153 of the 180 control genes (85%)
selected randomly from chromosomes 18, 19 and X.
Divergence of CT genes
The genome-based transcript sequences derived from
human and chimpanzee for each putative orthologous
pair were aligned using clustalw (version 1.81 [42]), with
gap extension penalties set to zero to allow gaps in the
alignment arising from sequences missing in the chimpanzee assembly. Both sequences in the alignment were
then trimmed to the extent of the human ORF based on
annotation in the RefSeq or GenBank entry. Each nucleotide alignment was manually curated and revised, if necessary, to reflect the corresponding protein alignment.
ORFs containing stop codons were dropped from the
analysis. Rates of synonymous (dS; also known as Ks) and
non-synonymous (dN; also known as Ka) substitutions
between aligned ORFs were estimated using the codeml
programme from the PAML package [24] with the F3x4
codon frequency model (and runmode = -2 in the codeml
control file). Note that incomplete codons in either the
human or the chimpanzee sequence are ignored by
codeml. The statistical significance of differences in the
distributions between human-chimpanzee divergence
rates (dN/dS) among CT genes and controls was assessed
using a Mann-Whitney (Table 3) or Welch two sample ttest (additional file 3) in the R package [43].
