December 8, 2006, Whistler, British Columbia, Canada
The field of computational biology has seen dramatic
growth over the past few years, both in terms of available
data, scientific questions and challenges for learning and
inference. These new types of scientific and clinical problems require the development of novel supervised and
unsupervised learning approaches. In particular, the field
is characterized by a diversity of heterogeneous data. The
human genome sequence is accompanied by real-valued
gene expression data, functional annotation of genes, genotyping information, a graph of interacting proteins, a set
of equations describing the dynamics of a system, localization of proteins in a cell, a phylogenetic tree relating
species, natural language text in the form of papers
describing experiments, partial models that provide priors, and numerous other data sources.

premier scientific meeting on neural computation, with
session topics spanning artificial intelligence, learning
theory, neuroscience, etc. The goal of this workshop was
to present emerging problems and machine learning techniques in computational biology, with a particular
emphasis on methods for computational learning from
heterogeneous data.
We received 37 extended abstract submissions, from
which 13 were selected for oral presentation. The current
supplement contains seven papers based on a subset of
the 13 extended abstracts. Submitted manuscripts were
rigorously reviewed by at least two referees. The quality of
each paper was evaluated with respect to its contribution
to biology as well as the novelty of the machine learning
methods employed.
