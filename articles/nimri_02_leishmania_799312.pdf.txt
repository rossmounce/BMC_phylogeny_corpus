Abstract
Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is endemic in the Middle Eastern countries. New
cases are emerging in areas previously free of the disease. In Jordan, the diagnosis of cases during
the 1960s and 1970s was mainly reported in military hospitals in Amman. Endemicity of the disease
was ascertained after reporting a total of 524 cases during 1973–1978.
Results: Leishmania major and Leishmania tropica were isolated from seventy-six autochthonous
and imported cases of CL, during eight-year period. The highest infection rates recorded were in
the central part of Jordan (60.5%), in males (72.4%) and in the age group 21–30 years (30.5%).
Lesions were on the exposed sites of the body, mainly on the face (40%). Both Leishmania spp. were
isolated from all parts of the country, although L. major was the predominant species (75% of cases)
in all areas except in the north part of Jordan. Isoenzyme characterization of the isolates identified
four previously undescribed zymodemes (Z). Four Leishmania major zymodemes were found, one
of which was a new zymodeme (ZMON-103 variant in GLUD220); L. major ZMON-103 was the
most common zymodeme. Four Leishmania tropica zymodemes were identified, of which three
were previously unreported. Of these, ZMON-54 var PGD96–97 was isolated from autochthonous
cases, whereas ZMON-59 var MDH100 and ZMON-75 var FH110 were obtained from both
autochthonous and imported cases, or from an imported CL case, respectively.
Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate the emergence of the CL disease in new areas. New
foci are reported, where the sporadic nature of the cases indicates recent spread of the disease to
these areas and the urge for the implementation of control measures.

Background
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is still considered as an important health problem in many parts of the world especially the Mediterranean and Middle East countries [1–4].
Difficulty in identifying these parasites due to the similar
morphology of amastigotes of different Leishmania species
has been solved using isoenzyme characterization [5].

This is the most common method used to study the variability of Leishmania spp. in general. Several PCR assays using specific primers were reported to be extremely
sensitive and promising in the detection and identification of the New World [6] or Old World [7,8] species of
Leishmania directly in clinical samples. The first cases of
CL in Jordan were reported by Adler and Theodor in 1929

[9]. No further reports appeared until 1968 when WHO
reported 33 cases in East Jordan [10]. The endemicity of
the region was recognized in the 1970s due to the increase
in the number of cases diagnosed. A total of 524 cases
were reported during 1973–1978, half of them occurred
in the Jordan Valley [11]. Further information on human
cases [12] sandfly vectors [13], and reservoir hosts [14]
from several localities were reported on both the incidence and the spread of the disease to other geographical
locations in Jordan. Cases of CL were reported from many
locations in the country [2,11,12]; both L. major and L.
tropica were reported. More cases of L. major were reported
in the central part of the Jordan valley. Cases of L. tropica
were more sporadic and reported mainly in the northern
regions, species identification was based on the isoenzyme characterization [15].
While many facts of the epidemiology and clinical aspects
of CL caused by L. major (dry type) and L. tropica (wet
type) have been revealed, information on the parasites
distribution and the epidemiologic factors governing their
transmission are sparse. Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by L. major was reported for many years
to be the only causative agent prevalent in Jordan mainly
in rural areas [16]. In Jordan, the diagnosis of CL cases
during the 1960s and 1970s was mainly reported in military hospitals in Amman [11]. Endemicity of the disease
was ascertained after reporting a total of 524 cases during
1973–1978 [17]. Almost 50% of these cases came from
the Jordan Valley, which is considered a hyper endemic region in Jordan. The Ministry of Health became increasingly aware of the seriousness of the leishmaniasis as a public
health problem, procedures for the diagnosis and isolation of the parasite in cultures were added to their parasitologic procedures and isolates obtained were identified
by isoenzyme characterization.

This study was initiated to investigate the emergence of
the CL disease in new areas. It reports on the species identification and their zymodeme composition among Leishmania stocks isolated from human CL cases collected from
different locations in the country during an eight year-period. Several new foci are reported for the first time indicating the spread of the disease. In addition, four
previously undescribed Leishmania zymodemes are reported, of which three are endemic in Jordan and one isolated from an imported CL case.

Methods
Subjects
Patients clinically suspected of having CL were referred to
the Ministry of Health, Central Laboratories in Amman,
for parasitologic diagnosis during the period 1992–2000.
These patients came from different governorates in Jordan
mainly from cities and towns within 50 Km from Amman,
the capital of Jordan.

For each case having cutaneous lesions (ulcers or scars), a
questionnaire was completed to record the necessary information such as name, age, sex, sites of ulcer(s) on the
body, address, date and place of acquiring the disease,
previous travel history or location of work if other than
the permanent address.
Parasitologic procedures
Skin scrapings from the edge of the lesion were obtained
from each patient. Part of it was immediately cultured in
Evan's Modified Tobie's Medium with L-proline, foetal
calf serum and antibiotics (gentamicin, nystatin or 5Fluorocytosine as antifungal agent). Culture media were
incubated at 22°C and examined at regular intervals to
monitor the growth of the parasite or the presence of contaminants. The contaminated cultures were discarded.
The remaining skin scraping portion was smeared on a

slide for staining with Giemsa stain and examined microscopically for presence of amastigotes.
Isoenzyme characterization
Promastigote cultures isolated from specimens were air
mailed to the Leishmania Reference Center of the Istituto
Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy for cryopreservation and
isoenzyme characterization. All Leishmania isolates were
then cryopreserved, mass cultured in Brain Heart Infusion
culture medium and characterized by starch-gel electrophoretic analysis of 13 isoenzymes (15 enzymic loci). The
enzymes studied are: PGM, phosphogucomutase
(E.C.2.7.5.1);
GPI,
glucose-phosphate
isomerase
(E.C.5.3.1.9); GOT, glutamate-oxaloacetate transmainase
(E.C.2.6.1.1); ME, malic enzyme (E.C.1.1.1.40); 6PGD,
glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (E.C.1.1.1.49);
G6PD,
glucose

phosphate
dehydrogenase
(E.C.1.1.1.37); NP, nucleoside purine phosphorylase
(E.C.3.2.2.1);
MDH,
malate
dehydrogenase
(E.C.1.1.1.37.), MPI, mannose phosphate isomerase
(E.C.5.3.1.8);
ICD,
isocitrate
dehydrogenase
(E.C.1.1.1.42); DIA, diaphorase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) (E.C.1.6.2.2); GLUD, glutamate dehydrogenase (E.C.1.4.1.3); FH, fumarate hydratase
(E.C.4.2.1.2). The techniques employed and the zymodemes nomenclature adopted were those of Montpellier
centre [18]. World Health Organization (WHO) reference
strains of L. infantum zymodeme (Z) MON-1 (MHOM/
TN/80/IPT1), L. donovani ZMON-2 (MHOM/IN/80/
DD8), L. tropica ZMON-60 (MHOM/SU/74/K27) and L.
major ZMON-4 (MHOM/SU/73/5-ASKH) were used as
references. Furthermore, strains of L. tropica and L. major
zymodemes previously isolated in Jordan and neighboring countries were also used as references. When a new zymodeme was identified, this was provisionally named as
"variant" (var) from the most similar classified MON zymodeme, and the electrophoretic mobility of the variant
enzyme(s) was reported along.
Phenetic analysis
For the taxonomic study 17 operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) corresponding to the zymodemes, were used. Of
these, 12 were included in the phylogenetic complexes reported by Rioux et al (1993)[19]; 6 in the L. tropica complex (ZMON-54, 59, 60, 75, 76 and 137), 5 in the L. major
complex (ZMON-4, 26, 68, 103, 229) and 1 in the L. infantum complex (ZMON-1); 1 was a L. tropica zymodeme
from the Arabic Peninsula (71-var PGD95, G6PD85,
NP1450, NP2100, FH100); and finally, 4 were the new zymodemes detected during the present study. Apart from
the three WHO reference zymodemes of L. infantum
(MON-1), L. tropica (MON-60) and L. major (MON-4), all
the other zymodemes were from the Middle East, ex Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Yemen and Arabic Peninsula.

The phenogram was built using the UPGMA method [20]
based on the Jaccard similarity index values (Sj), as implemeted by the NTSYS-pc computer software.

Results
Epidemiologic data
Parasites were isolated in culture from skin ulcers with detailed sociodemographic data from 76 patients.

The age groups and sex distribution for both species are
shown in Table 1. The highest infection rate of 72.4% was
recorded in males compared to 27.6% in females. The age
range of the patients was from 10 months to 64 years
while that forL. tropica was from 7 months to 54 years. Infections with L. major were recorded in 48 males (84.2%)
and in 9 females (15.8%). The opposite was recorded in
L. tropica, where higher infection rates were recorded in females (63.2%) than in males (36.8%). The highest rates
in both species were recorded in adults in the age group
21–30 years (30.5%) and in children less than five years
(23.7%), followed by 10.5% in the age groups of 11–20,
31–40, and 41–50 years. The lowest rates (6.6% and
7.7%) were recorded in the age groups 5–10 years, and >
50 years respectively.
Lesions were mainly located on the face and neck (47%)
compared with (20%) on the hands and arms, and (17%)
on the legs. Multiple lesions appeared on two or more
sites of the body in 16% of the cases.
Patient's residence, working place, travel history and the
time of appearance of the lesions were important data for
determining the locations where the infections might
have taken place. The numbers of positive cases in the
north, central and south parts of Jordan are shown in Table 2. The highest infection rate (60.5%) was recorded in
patients who are living or contracted the disease in the
central part of Jordan (Figure 1) followed by the infection
rate (14.5%) recorded for patients from the north. The
lowest rate (13.2%) was recorded for patients living or
contracted the disease in the south. The infection rate in
patients who contracted the disease in the neighboring
countries was 11.8 %. These patients worked and lived
outside Jordan previous to the appearance of the lesions.
The countries where they contacted the disease were Saudi
Arabia (three in Taif and two in Riyadh), Iraq (two in
Baghdad) and Syria (two in Aleppo); these countries are
known to be endemic with CL.
Parasite species and zymodemes
L. major and L. tropica were isolated from patients coming
from Jordan and neighbouring countries. The zymodemes
of Leishmania spp. that were isolated varied from one region to another as reported in Table 3. A total of eight zymodemes were identified, of which four previously

were isolated: ZMON-103 (e.g. Amman, Salt, S.
Shouneh), ZMON-103 var GLUD220 (S. Shouneh), and
MON-229 (Karameh). Finally, L. major ZMON-103 was
isolated from a patient from Karak in the South of the
country.
Three L. tropica zymodemes were identified from autochthonous CL cases in Jordan. L. tropica ZMON-54 var
PGD96–97 (reference strain MHOM/JO/94/JCL34) was
isolated from the North (e.g. Um Qais, Hammeh,) of the
country. In the Central region (e.g. S. Shouneh) ZMON-

54 var PGD96–97 and ZMON-137 were isolated. A newly
described variant, ZMON-59 var MDH100, PGD95,
G6PD85, GLUD80, MPI110 (reference strain MHOM/JO/
92/JCL27) was isolated from the South (Tafila).
Both Leishmania species were also isolated from patients
who contracted the disease during their work in the neighboring countries. L. major ZMON-26 was isolated from
two patients living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. L. tropica
ZMON-59 var MDH100, PGD95, G6PD85, GLUD80,

FH110 (reference strain MHOM/SY/93/JCL29), which is a
newly described zymodeme, AND was isolated from a patient who contracted the disease in Aleppo, Syria.
L. major ZMON-103 was also isolated from four jirds that
were caught in the central rural area.
Phenetic analysis
The phenogram in Figure 2 shows 2 principal branches
clearly individualized, with a third branch supported by L.
infantum (A). The first branch (B) is highly polymorphic
with a first branch at Sj value as low as 0.27, and includes
all the zymodemes of L. tropica. The second one (C) is
more monomorphic (Sj = 0.70) and includes the group of
L. major zymodemes. L. infantum links to L. tropica delimiting two principal clusters of this species: a) the first one
is made of 7 zymodemes that show links between the
WHO reference MON-60 (from ex Soviet Union) and
MON-76 (from Syria); between MON75 (from ex Soviet
Union) and the new zymodeme MON-75 var FH110 (Sj =
0.76); and between the close pair MON-54 (from Israel)
and the new zymodeme MON-54 var PGD96–97 (Sj =
0.87); MON-59 (from Afghanistan) is grouped as a single
entity; b) the second cluster is made of 3 zymodemes, of
which MON-137 (from Israel) links to a group of very
similar zymodemes MON-59 var MDH100, PGD95,
G6PD85, GLUD80, MPI110 and MON-71 var PGD95,
G6PD85, NP1450, NP2100, FH100 (from Arabic Peninsula)
(Sj = 0.76). As regards L. major, two principal clusters are
identified: a) the first closely links zymodemes MON-4
(WHO reference from ex Soviet Union) and MON 26
(from Yemen) (Sj = 0.87) to ZMON-229 from Jordan; b)
the second identifies the paired MON-103 from Jordan
and the new zymodeme MON-103 var GLUD220 (Sj =
0.87). As external group MON-68 from Israel links L. major to L. infantum. (Sj = 0.17), confirming the high distance
between the two species [21]

Discussion
This study reports on cases of human CL caused by L. major and L. tropica from different regions in Jordan. Figure 1
shows the locations where cases are reported in this study.
Cases are reported for the first time from cities in the
north (e.g., Kufrsoum, Kufrangeh, and Saham), the central region (e.g. Azraq, Falha) and the south (e.g., Aqaba,
Al Hasa, Karak, and Tafila). The sporadic nature of the cases in these areas indicates the recent spread of the disease
to these areas. Clustering of cases was recorded in endemic
areas along the Jordan Valley; highest number of cases was
reported mostly in the central part. Several studies reported on the endemicity of CL on both sides of the Jordan
Valley [11,13,22]. The disease is endemic for many years
in Jericho (Jericho boil), the endemicity of the disease has
been maintained due to the presence of the vector Phlebotomus papatasi, and the reservoir host Psammomys obesus
in that area [22].
The highest number of cases reported in our study was
mainly in the central part of Jordan (Karameh, S. Shouneh
and Sweimeh). These results are in agreement with previous studies, which also reported higher infection rates in
Sweimeh in the Jordan Valley [17]. The number of cases
diagnosed in one military hospital in Amman during
1979 through 1981 was 207 cases, where 71% of these
came from the same area, Sweimeh in the Jordan Valley.
A report of an outbreak of zoonotic CL in 80 nonimmuned soldiers in Southern Jordan confirmed the endemicity of the disease in the Jordan Valley [23].
The infection rates reported in the north particularly along
the Jordan Valley came second. Isolation of the parasite
from new areas indicates that the geographical distribution of CL in Jordan is far wider than previously thought.
The higher infection rates (72.4%) recorded in males
compared to females (27.6%) in all age groups were also

reported by others [12]. This difference might be explained by more exposure of males to the sandflies bites
during their travel and work activities in the endemic areas. The high rates in children less than five years old
(23.7%) might be explained by non immunity and frequent exposure to bites of the sandflies inside their homes
since most of the cases in this age group were from the
central endemic areas (e.g., S. Shouneh and Sweimeh)
and other cities in the south (e.g., Aqaba and Al Hasa).
The low rates recorded in the age group > 50 years (7.7%)
might be explained by development of immunity over
time as a result of previous exposure, which is well known
in CL. The low rate in the age group 5–10 years (6.6%)
could not be explained. It might be due to the exclusion
of some of the cases in this age group among other cases
due to incomplete information about the patients.
In a study of the distribution of phlebotomine sandfly
species in Jordan [16], Phlebotomus papatasi, the vector of

L. major was collected from both domestic and rural areas
in many localities in Jordan. It was reported as the predominant or the abundant species in localities where cases were reported in this study such as the Jordan Valley,
suburbs of Amman and in the newly reported localities
such as Azraq, and Aqaba. Evidence on the role of P. papatasi as a vector of L. major was provided after the isolation
of the parasite from P. papatasi females collected from the
Southern Jordan Valley [13]. L. major was also isolated
from four Psammomys obesus, the principle reservoir host
caught in endemic foci in Jordan [14]. CL is also known to
be endemic in the neighboring countries where nine patients contracted the disease [24–26]. L. major was the predominant species (75%) that was isolated from all
localities in this study and in previous studies [13,14]. CL
caused by L. tropica is less common in Jordan as well as in
the other endemic neighboring countries [27,28]. L. tropica was mainly isolated from the north, few cases from the
central region, and one case in the south. It was also iso-

lated from cases imported from Saudi Arabia and Syria
where it is endemic [24,29].

seems that no "clinical" association is evident for different
L. tropica zymodemes.

The isoenzyme characterization of the isolates identified
four L. major zymodemes MON-26, MON-103 (the predominant zymodeme), and MON-103 var GLUD220
(newly described enzymatic variant), MON-229 and
MON-26, from an imported CL case from Saudi Arabia.
As already reported for this species, a general enzymatic
homogeneity among the strains was observed, variations
being limited to 1–2 enzymes only (Tab. 5, Fig. 2). L. major zymodeme MON-26 is known as the agent of ZCL in
the sub-Saharan Sahel to the Near and Middle East [30].

To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports on zymodemes of both L. major and L. tropica isolated from different parts of the country. L. tropica with isoenzyme
profiles characteristics resembling MON-54 that was reported for eight isolates from towns in the north [15] is
confirmed by isolating ZMON-54 var PGD96–97 from the
same towns in this study. The isolation of L. major ZMON103 from Salt in this study and L. tropica ZMON-137 from
Salt district in another study [32], indicates the presence
of both spp. in the same area and calls for further investigation on the status of the disease in that area.

Four L. tropica zymodemes were identified, MON-137,
MON-54 var PGD96–97, MON-59 var MDH100, PGD95,
G6PD85, GLUD80, MPI110, and MON-75 var FH110, the
last three being newly described zymodemes. Zymodeme
MON-59 var MDH100, PGD95, G6PD85, GLUD80, MPI110
was identified in both autochthonous (Tafila) and in imported cases from Saudi Arabia, while zymodeme MON75 var FH110 was only identified from imported cases
from Aleppo, Syria. L. tropica zymodemes differed in one
to five enzymes, confirming the high degree of intraspecific polymorphism reported for this species (Tab. 4, Fig. 2).
Diversification into "small variants" is apparently the result of recent mutations, possibly associated with genetic
exchange [31]. Unlike L. major, which is known to have a
zoonotic transmission cycle, the transmission cycle of L.
tropica is mainly anthroponotic and associated to urban
environment. If the transmission cycle in the areas where
it was isolated is man-fly-man, then the geographical distribution of intraspecific variants will be greatly influenced by the movement of the infected individuals. Thus
a zymodeme may be spread from city to city, becoming established if the species of the sandfly vector is present.
This could explain the wide distribution of zymodeme
MON-54 var PGD96–97 identified in cases from the north
and the central regions. An explanation for the greater variation noticed in L. tropica than L. major may be that L.
tropica simply has greater genetic diversity than L. major.
The importance of finding an isoenzymatic variant could
be applied to identify a geographical entity, with the possibility of identifying the origin of the infection especially
in highly polymorphic Leishmania species such as L. tropica, when an appropriate panel of isoenzymes is analyzed.
The phenetic analysis confirms this hypothesis linking zymodemes for similarity distance according their geographical origin. Then most zymodemes from Middle East
are progressively linked (Figure 2). Although in some
Leishmania species the enzymatic variation of an isolate
could also be used as a clinical marker (for example
NP1140 in L. infantum could be used as a marker for cutaneous, rather than visceral leishmaniasis ; however, it

Conclusions
Based on the findings of this study, the new localities
where cases were reported should be added to the list of
CL foci. The data clearly demonstrate the clustering of cases in endemic areas and the spread of the disease to new
areas that were not previously reported indicated by the
sporadic nature of the disease in these areas. Further studies on the vector and reservoir host are needed to investigate the transmission cycle in these areas.
