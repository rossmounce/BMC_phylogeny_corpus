Characterization of the past and current
duplication activities in the human 22q11.2 region
Xingyi Guo1, Laina Freyer2, Bernice Morrow2, Deyou Zheng1,2,3*

Abstract
Background: Segmental duplications (SDs) on 22q11.2 (LCR22), serve as substrates for meiotic non-allelic
homologous recombination (NAHR) events resulting in several clinically significant genomic disorders.
Results: To understand the duplication activity leading to the complicated SD structure of this region, we have
applied the A-Bruijn graph algorithm to decompose the 22q11.2 SDs to 523 fundamental duplication sequences,
termed subunits. Cross-species syntenic analysis of primate genomes demonstrates that many of these LCR22
subunits emerged very recently, especially those implicated in human genomic disorders. Some subunits have
expanded more actively than others, and young Alu SINEs, are associated much more frequently with duplicated
sequences that have undergone active expansion, confirming their role in mediating recombination events. Many
copy number variations (CNVs) exist on 22q11.2, some flanked by SDs. Interestingly, two chromosome breakpoints
for 13 CNVs (mean length 65 kb) are located in paralogous subunits, providing direct evidence that SD subunits
could contribute to CNV formation. Sequence analysis of PACs or BACs identified extra CNVs, specifically, 10
insertions and 18 deletions within 22q11.2; four were more than 10 kb in size and most contained young AluYs at
their breakpoints.
Conclusions: Our study indicates that AluYs are implicated in the past and current duplication events, and
moreover suggests that DNA rearrangements in 22q11.2 genomic disorders perhaps do not occur randomly but
involve both actively expanded duplication subunits and Alu elements.

Background
Segmental duplications (SDs) or low copy repeats
(LCRs), defined as continuous non-repetitive DNA
sequences that are found at two or more genomic locations, comprise ~5% of the human genome [1-3]. SDs
can mediate meiotic unequal non-allelic homologous
recombination (NAHR) events, resulting in genomic
rearrangement and sometimes altered gene dosage
within the intervening regions such as those on 22q11.2.
Segmental duplications or low copy repeats on 22q11.2
(often referred to as LCR22s) [4,5] are of great interest
because they have been associated with four different
human disorders [6]: velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS) (MIM #192349 [7] or MIM
#188400 [8,9]), the reciprocal duplication syndrome
[5,10], der(22) syndrome [11], and cat-eye syndrome

[12]. Despite extensive molecular studies in the past
decade, the precise position of the breakpoints within
the two LCR22s associated with most of these syndromes, LCR22-2 and -4, remain largely elusive. This is
due to their high sequence similarity (97%-99%) and
that there are eight related LCR22 blocks on 22q11.2,
comprising over 11% of the region, making it difficult to
identify paralogous sequences unique to one or the
others [5,13,14]. Interestingly, characterization of the
genomic sequence within and near LCR22s demonstrated that both Alu repeat elements and AT-rich
repeats were enriched and likely involved in many of the
past unequal crossover duplications that have shuffled
DNAs among blocks and given rise to the current complex genomic architecture of LCR22s [14]. This is consistent with findings from genome-wide analyses of
human SDs [15,16].
To understand the duplication architecture of LCR22
and more importantly to gain insight to the molecular
mechanism behind high incidence of pathogenic LCR22

syndromes, we have applied A-Bruijn graph algorithm
to decompose the LCR22 architecture to fundamental
duplication subunits at nucleotide-level resolution, without any bias to either genes or pseudogenes as was in
the case of previous studies focused on LCR22s that are
mentioned above (Figure 1). Our study moreover found
unexpectedly high genetic variation between and within
SDs, indicating them as highly dynamic in the genome.
This is supported by the fact that many subunit copies
emerged recently, at either the human or the African
great ape lineage, through both small and large-scale

duplication loci (see Figure 2B).

duplications. Highly active subunits were found with significant enrichment of AluY, a young short interspersed
nuclear element (SINE), at their ends or short adjacent
sequences. This repeat and some subunits associated
with it, continue to actively mediate CNV generation in
human LCR22 region. These CNVs could alter risk to
genomic disorders on 22q11.2 by making them better or
worse substrates for meiotic recombination.

Results
Segmental duplications on 22q11.2 and their gene
content

Segmental duplications (SDs) or low copy repeats
directly contribute to the genome dynamics and meiotic
instability of human 22q11.2. In this study, we began by
surveying the content and extent of duplications within
the 22q11.2 region using SDs with sequence identity
≥ 90% and length ≥ 1 kb that have been annotated by
Dr. Eichler’s group through Whole Genome Assembly
Comparison (WGAC) and Whole Genome Shotgun
Sequences Detection (WSSD) [1,2]. In total, 202 pairs of
SD sequences (often termed duplicons) were located on
22q11.2 (chr22:17,000,000-24,000,000, NCBI36/hg18),
accounting for ~1.8 Mb (26%) of its bases. The rest of
the DNA sequence between SDs was referred here as
“unique sequences” (the corresponding locations thereby
as “unique regions” as they were not explicitly involved
in duplications within this region). The sequence divergence of the SDs on 22q11.2 was relatively low, with a
median of 3.6%, and with 58% of them diverging < 4%
(Additional file 1, Figure S1). By comparison, the average sequence divergence for all human SDs was 6%
while 25% of them diverged < 4%. The average length of
SDs in 22q11.2 was 13 kb (ranging from 1 to 162 kb),
while a significant negative correlation between length
and divergence was observed for these SDs (r = -0.46,
p < 6 × 10-12; Additional file 1, Figure S1), suggesting
that either many old duplicated sequences have experienced significant nucleotide loss after their emergence
or recent duplication events produced mainly large SDs.
It is well known that DNA duplications can lead to
new copies of genes or create pseudogenes [17,18]; and
both genes [1] and pseudogenes [19] are enriched within
SDs. Using the most recent and comprehensive data
from the ENCODE gene annotation group [20], we have
surveyed the pseudogene and gene content on 22q11.2
(Figure 2A). Overall, the SD regions of 22q11.2 were
enriched with about three times more pseudogenes than
non-SD regions, as 6% and 2% of the base pairs in the
two regions were annotated as pseudogenic, respectively
(p < 0.001). The percentages of base pairs corresponding
to coding exons, however, were more similar (6% in SD
vs 8% in the unique regions). These numbers are higher

than average for the human genome, which reflect the
known enrichment of genes in 22q11.2.
Decomposition of 22q11.2 SDs to duplication subunits
and blocks

To establish a reference frame for studying intra-LCR22
duplication activity and to gain insight to their disease
susceptibility, we decided to decompose SDs to basic
duplication subunits, which represent the smallest continuous sequences that have been involved in at least
one independent intra-LCR22 duplication event. As illustrated in Figure 1, the boundaries of subunits denote
potential breakpoints, although some of which may be
implicated in more duplications than others. Indeed,
those recurrent subunits (e.g., subunits in orange and
green in Figure 1) constitute core duplicons that have
given rise to the majority of human SDs [21]. Applying
the program, RepeatGluer that utilized A-Bruijn graphs
to resolve mosaic structures of repeat sequences [22],
we have decomposed the 202 pairs of SDs in 22q11.2 to
523 non-overlapping subunits (Figure 2; Additional file
2, Table S1). These subunits ranged from 30 bp to 63.8
kb, with a mean length of 3,240 bp (median is 1,333
bp). Previously, Jiang et al have applied the A-Bruijn
graph algorithm to decompose the human SDs to subunits [21,23] and the resulting subunits were defined very
similar to current ones (see Methods). With previous
definition of blocks as guidance [24], we further partitioned the 523 subunits into eight duplication blocks,
LCR22-2’, LCR22-3a’, LCR22-3b’, and LCR22-4’ to
LCR22-8’ (Table 1 and Figure 2A; the “ ‘ “ denotes a larger interval than the classic LCR22s, delineated previously with LCR22-2 and LCR22-4 as the base
reference for defining duplications [14,25]). In comparison with the past definition, currently defined blocks
were typically longer and encompassed more SDs. Our
current analysis has particularly expanded the duplicated
content of LCR22-4’ and LCR22-7’ with newly described
SDs (the distal part of LCR22-4’ and the proximal part
of LCR22-7’ in Figure 2). As shown with paralogous
relationship (depicted by same colors) in Figure 2, the
newly incorporated SD subunits are surely components
of the evolutionary products of the past DNA duplications in 22q11.2, and thus should be added to the “classic” definition of LCR22s and included for future study.
Additionally, the delineation of SDs to individual subunits shows the mosaic evolutionary relationship within
LCR22s much more clearly.
As shown in Figure 2, the eight LCR22’ blocks are
separated and flanked by unique (i.e., non-SD)
sequences. The clustering of subunits in these blocks
suggests that some sequence features may have rendered
them as targets of duplication “hotspots”. The shared
similarity at macro-scale in their subunit arrangements

Page 4 of 16

among LCR22-2’, LCR22-3a’ and LCR22-4’ confirms
that these three blocks may arise from few instances of
large-scale duplication events involving many adjacent
subunits simultaneously [26,27]. Note that part of
LCR22-3a’ remains a missing gap in the reference
human genome sequence. In contrast, LCR22-3b’,
LCR22-5’, LCR22-6’, LCR22-7’, and LCR22-8’ display a
different architectural pattern consisting mostly of small
subunits connected in a discrete manner. For example,
the average size of subunits in LCR22-4’ is 5,420 bp,
which is approximately twice as large as that of LCR225’ (2,593 bp) and four times larger than that of LCR227’ (1,171 bp). Analysis of the relative abundance of large
subunits, defined by either >5 kb, >10 kb or >20 kb
(data not shown), also showed that large subunits
were predominantly located in LCR22-2’, LCR22-3a’
and LCR22-4’. Since large SDs overall show low
sequence divergence as described above (Additional file
1, Figure S1), this result further suggests that the bulk
DNAs constituting these three blocks was likely generated more recently during evolution than other LCR22
blocks. The sporadic presence of a few small subunits
specifically in each of the three “young” blocks indicates
that new micro-scale duplications have occurred after
their initial formation.
Occurrence of LCR22s in other primate genomes

As mentioned above, the majority of SDs on 22q11.2
shows < 4% sequence divergence. Accordingly, we estimated that the majority (>58%) of duplicated sequences
emerged between 10-20 million years ago and after the
divergence of human and macaque lineages, based on
an estimation of 3% divergence between duplicated
sequences per 10 million years [16]. To further explore
the evolutionary history of these SDs, we have surveyed
and characterized the syntenic regions of human LCR22’
sequences in the chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque
genomes.
Using multiple genome alignment data from the
Ensembl database [28] and with extra filtering to
improve syntenic map for duplicated sequences (see
Methods for details), we found that 70%, 61%, and 26%
of the 22q11.2 SD subunits had unambiguous syntenic
sequences in chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque
(Table 1), respectively, and all together 81% of subunits
had syntenic sequences detected in at least one of the
three current assembles of non-human primate genomes
(Figure 3A). More specifically, 39%, 21%, and 26%
of duplicated subunits in LCR22-3a’, LCR22-2’, and
LCR22-4’, respectively, appeared specific to the human
genome (Table 1; Figure 3A). By comparison, only 3%
to 19% of the subunits in LCR22-3b’, LCR22-5’, 6’, 7’,
and 8’ exhibited human specificity. We have also carried
out a PCR assay to support our syntenic analysis

Figure 3 Synteny of SDs on 22q11.2. (A) The syntenic relationship of the subunits with chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque is shown as
present (matching color boxes) or absent (white). This map was derived from our analysis of the multi-genome alignment data in the Ensembl
database (see Methods). The boxed region in LCR22-5’ was subsequently confirmed by PCR to be absent in the macaque genome (see
Additional file 3, Figure S2). (B) Comparison of primate segmental duplications. The data were retrieved from a previous study using WSSD
analysis for SD detection [29]. The depth of sequence read coverage (number of shot-gun sequencing reads in 5-kb windows) is depicted for
human (HAS), chimpanzee (PTR), orangutan (PPY) and macaque (MMU) based on alignment of reads against the human genome. Putative
duplicated regions with excess read depth (more than three standard deviation of the mean) are shown in red with unique regions in green.
Human and chimp SDs derived from depth analysis are also shown below the human SDs derived from WGAC analysis (top). The data here
suggest that most of the sequences in LCR22-2’, -3a’ and -4’ are shared between human and chimpanzee and their duplications likely occurred
after the split of the African great apes from Asian great apes. Interestingly, the human-specific SDs in LCR22-3a’ and -4’ show higher sequence
identity (represented by light to dark orange color) than the rest of the SDs (light to dark grey). (C) Past duplication events that may have
generated the homology between LCR22-3a’ and LCR22-4’. Arrow lines represent putative duplication directions. The large cyan subunit in
LCR22-3a’ may have arisen from either the proximal or distal paralogous sequences in LCR22-4’.

(Additional file 3). Together with the results from our
analysis of subunit distribution in 22q11.2 (above), our
cross-species syntenic analysis demonstrates that most
sequences in LCR22-2’, LCR22-3a’, and LCR22-4’ were
generated from more recent duplication events.
This is also supported firstly by FISH mapping experiments using probes to four well-characterized genes in
the LCR22 region that detected signals for the presence
of LCR22-6, LCR22-7, LCR22-8 sequences in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque [24]. Secondly, phylogenetic analysis of BCR, GGT, GGTLA and USP18 genes
or pseudogenes in human LCR22s also indicated
LCR22-2, LCR22-3a and LCR22-4 were evolutionarily
close but they were distant from the other LCR22 blocks
[24]. Thirdly, previous comparative analysis of SDs in
four primate genomes indicated in particular that those
located in the distal halves of LCR22-2 and LCR22-4,
were generated more recently (Figure 3B). This important finding is probably relevant to the fact that most of
the genomic disorders on 22q11.2 are mapped to
LCR22-2, LCR22-3a and LCR22-4 regions, although
ascertainment due to deletion of critical dosage sensitive
genes associated with known syndromes provides significant bias.
Re-construction of large duplication events

One of the main goals of our study is to identify and
characterize subunits that are implicated in frequent
duplications, as such subunits may host recombination
“hotspots” of genomic disorders in 22q11.2. We started
by grouping subunits into paralogous families (see
hypothetical example in Figure 1) to capture their putative intra-LCR22 duplication relationships. A total of
122 subunit families were assembled from the 523 subunits (Additional file 2, Table S1). The sizes of these
families range from 2 to 16 subunits, with one third of
these families having fewer than six members.
As shown with cartoons in Figure 1, both SD duplicons and subunits need to be appropriately merged and
aligned in order to identify past duplication events from
multiple candidates correctly. As such, we first merged
physically overlapping SD duplicons to obtain duplication loci [see Methods for details, a duplication locus
here was defined as a genomic region containing one or
more (overlapping) duplicons not disrupted by unique
sequence]. We determined a total of 147 duplication
loci from the 22q11.2 SDs, and they were further separated to 33 groups based on sharing of paralogous subunits (Figure 2B). Finally, aligning all duplication loci to
the largest locus of their respective group, as illustrated
in Figure 1D, yielded a hierarchical structure representing putative duplication relationship of all SDs in
22q11.2 (Figure 2B). At the top first level, 33 distinct
duplication loci were identified (top row in Figure 2B)

Page 6 of 16

and they accounted for 47% of all SD sequences in
22q11.2, suggesting that the remaining 53% SD
sequences might have arisen from these 33 loci.
One feature emerging from the data in Figure 2B is
that some subunit families are frequently located at the
ends (i.e., breakpoints) of putative duplications, suggesting that they might have been highly active in mediating
past duplication events. For example, at least six duplication events might have been mediated by subunits in
the family that included a member at the 5’ end of
LCR22-2’ (most left arrow in Figure 2B). Somewhat surprisingly, analysis of such subunit families significantly
enriched at the boundaries of duplications (arrows in
Figure 2B) revealed that 46% of the subunits implicated
in frequent past duplication events harbored or were
adjacent to Alu elements.
As shown in Figure 2B, most of the putative duplications in 22q11.2 involved relatively small (<10 Kb)
duplicons and thus were not further pursued due to the
limitation of our approach in resolving the donor and
acceptor of a duplication event, but at least three duplication events operated on large duplicons (boxes in
Figure 2B). The largest one (involving 40 subunits and
containing 162 kb sequence) occurred between LCR222’ and LCR22-4’ (first box in Figure 2B). The other two
large-scale duplications involved the largest subunit
(~64 kb, second box in Figure 2); one occurred between
LCR22-3a’ and LCR22-4’, and the other at the distal half
of LCR22-4’ (Figure 3C).
Further syntenic analysis (described above) showed
that the duplication between LCR22-3a’ and LCR22-4’
occurred after the split of the macaque lineage, while
the duplication at LCR22-4’ might have occurred earlier
(Figure 3A, C), although a previous complementary analysis comparing SDs in four primate genomes [29] indicated that both duplications occurred in the ancestral
lineage of human and chimpanzee (Figure 3B). Future
experiments, such as FISH mapping, are needed to
resolve these two different findings. Interestingly, it
appears that two independent duplications had inserted
two subunits (blue and green subunits in Figure 3C) in
front of the distal cyan subunit of LCR22-4’ before the
resulting sequence was then duplicated to LCR22-3a’.
Alternatively, some subunits in LCR22-3a’ may have originated from the proximal part of LCR22-4’. This uncertainty could not be resolved from sequence similarity, as
the pair-wise sequence identity from the duplication
events marked by the blue and red arrow is 99.5% and
99.6%, respectively, highlighting the challenge in reconstructing past duplication events accurately.
Repeat elements and duplications on 22q11.2

As shown in Figure 2, most duplication events involved
in short sequences. We thus decided to investigate to

Guo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/71

what degree such small duplications have contributed to
the mosaic duplication patterns of SDs in 22q11.2 and
sequence shuffling between LCR22 blocks. The majority
of subunit families (69%) had paralogs presence in two
to four blocks, which seemed to be mostly a result of
recent inter-block duplication among LCR22-2’, LCR223’ and LCR22-4’ (Figure 4A). The subunit families in
LCR22-2’, -3’, -4’, -6’ and -8’ were quite active as more
than 95% of their subunits had paralogs in other blocks.
In contrast, 70% and 80% of the subunits in LCR22-5’

Page 7 of 16

and LCR22-7’, respectively, existed as intra-block duplications (Figure 4A). Syntenic sequences to the tandem
subunits of LCR22-7’ were found in the genomes of
chimpanzee and orangutan but not macaque (Figure 3),
indicating the underlying duplication events occurred
~25 million years ago. Interestingly, 39 families occupied
only in a single block, indicating their expansion was
largely a result of local and potentially tandem
duplications.
To search for potential sequence features mediating
active duplications, we characterized the short sequences
immediately adjacent (±10 bp) to duplicated subunits in
22q11.2. First, we calculated the abundances of different
sequence features, e.g., Alu, LINE-1, gene, and pseudogene, and correlated them with the “duplication activity”
of individual subunit families, measured by the number
of blocks a family resided. The result showed that Alu/
SINE elements were associated much more frequently
with subunit families that have undergone active expansion (Figure 4B), suggesting Alu-mediated duplications
might be responsible for most of the inter-block duplications. Interestingly, direct survey of the adjacent
sequences of all 22q11.2 SD subunits also found that
Alu was the most prevalent repeat, present in 32% of
the 523 subunits. Of all the 339 Alu repeats next to the
subunits, 30% of them were AluSx and 28% were AluY,
followed by AluJo (11%), AluSq (8%), and AluSg (6%).
A random simulation indicated that the associations of
subunits with each of these different Alu types were
significantly more than expected (p < 0.001). These findings are consistent with previous reports that Alumediated recombination events actively shuffled genes
within LCR22 blocks and that young Alu elements
(AluY and AluS) were frequently enriched at the end of
SDs [15,30].
CNVs flanked by paralogous subunits

Figure 4 Subunit family spreading in multiple LCR22’ blocks is
often adjacent to Alu repeats. (A) The SD subunits were assigned
to different layers of circles, whereas the numbers represent the
total blocks in which a subunit family has one or more members.
For example, a subunit family is given 3 if its members are found in
3 of the 8 blocks, and consequently all subunits of this family will
be drawn in the circle labeled with “3”. (B) Relationship between
selected sequence features and block occupancy for SD subunits.
The x-axis describes the number of blocks a subunit family occupies
(A). The y-axis shows the percentage of subunit endpoints with a
given sequence feature. No subunit family was found in and only in
five blocks.

SDs are a major source of genome instability and they
have been suggested to play an important role in the
etiology of copy number variations (CNVs), but the
extent and features of CNVs in 22q11.2 have not been
characterized to date. To explore this, we obtained all
previously annotated human CNVs and overlaid them
on our map of 22q11.2 SD subunits. Due to the high
sequence identity of 22q11.2 SDs, which may cause
cross-hybridization signals, we only considered genomewide CNVs detected using relatively high-resolution
technology (either using microarray with short probes
or based on direct sequencing). We collected 452 CNVs
from previous studies (69 gains and 72 losses > 460 bp
[31]; 133 gains and 178 losses > 1 kb [32]; and other
CNVs obtained from the Database of Genome Variants
based on either paired-end fosmid clone mapping or
individual personal genomes) (Figure 5). Respectively,

the two breakpoints for 13 of these CNVs (mean length
65 kb) were located to the same duplication subunit
family (i.e., paralogous subunits), providing direct evidence that some pairs of paralogous subunits could
indeed mediate CNV formation by NAHR (Table 2).
Interestingly, 12 of these 13 CNVs were deletions. More
surprisingly, except one in LCR22-2’, all SD-overlapping
CNVs were located to either LCR22-5’ or LCR22-7’
regions (Figure 5), where paralogous subunits frequently
exist in tandem.
CNVs flanked by Alu elements

In addition to publicly available CNV data, we have
employed a BAC/PAC clone mapping approach to
uncover CNVs on 22q11.2. We collected DNA sequence
from 191 large insert clones, cosmids, PACs and BACs,
from GenBank, and their alignment to the reference
22q11.2 sequence revealed 10 insertions and 18 deletions

of sizes > 200 bp (Figure 6; Table 3). Four of these CNVs
were more than 10 kb in size, one 11.9 kb insertion, and
the other three were 25.9 kb, 37.1 kb and 54.3 kb deletions (Table 3). A total of 11 of the remaining CNVs
were relatively small (< 1 kb), whereas 13 of them were
intermediate in length (1 ~10 kb). Moreover, 19 and nine
of these CNVs (p < 0.001) were in the duplicated and
unique regions, respectively, providing additional line of
evidence that SDs show significant genetic variation.
As the CNVs from large insert clone mapping
(Figure 6) identified breakpoints down to the base-pair
level, we further characterized the sequence in the vicinity of them. We found that 15 (54%) of the 28 CNVs
had at least one breakpoint terminating at an Alu
repeat (Table 3; Figure 7). Again, the most prevalent
group was AluY, which was next to nine CNVs. The
enrichment of AluY is highly significant (p < 0.001)
based on simulation. Furthermore, we have compared
the sequence similarity between the two short
sequences immediately adjacent (±10 bp) to the two

breakpoints of each CNV and found that nine (50%) of
the 18 deletion CNVs might be the result of meiotic
NAHR events (Table 3). A pair of AluY repeats (AluYAluY) was located at the two breakpoints of four of
the nine CNVs (Figure 7). Likewise, same repeats, one
in the form of AluSx-AluSx and the other in the form
of L1-L1 LINE, were next to the breakpoints of two
CNVs. Another two CNVs may be results of NAHR
mediated by two different sub-groups of Alu, one with
AluY-AluSx and the other with AluY-AluJo. More
interestingly, we found that the generation of one
CNV (chr22:22,673,453-22,727,704) may have been
mediated by paralogous subunits. These subunits are
part of two non-processed pseudogenes derived from
glutathione S-transferase theta (GSTT) gene. In summary, our analysis suggests that AluY plays a key role
in the genome dynamics of 22q11.2 by mediating the
generations of both SDs and CNVs, largely through
NAHR.

Discussion
Segmental duplications on 22q11.2 are some of the
most complicated SDs in the human genome but the
value in understanding their structure and variation
among humans is because they form substrates for
NAHR events that can lead to gene dosage imbalance
and genomic disorders. Such major disorders include
VCFS/DGS, the reciprocal duplication in the same
interval, and cat-eye syndrome, a partial tetrasomy
[5-12]. Patients with VCFS/DGS and separately, the
duplication syndrome have been ascertained for physical
malformations including craniofacial and cardiac
defects, but also due to cognitive or neurobehavioral

disorders such as learning disabilities or schizophrenia
(reviewed in: [33,34]).
To understand structure features in 22q11.2 and
mechanisms by which SDs on 22q11.2 confer genetic
variation and CNV formation, we have decomposed
them into fundamental duplication subunits to investigate sequence shuffling within LCR22s, past duplication
events, and current duplications (i.e., CNVs). Our key
finding is that some subunits are highly active in duplications and AluY, a young repeat emerging very recently
during primate evolution [15], is significantly associated
with them, suggesting subunits next to AluY or AluY
itself may be responsible for historic and current genomic rearrangements in SDs on 22q11.2. We also found
that LCR22-2’, LCR22-3a’, and LCR22-4’, the three
young blocks implicated most frequently in genomic
disorders, contained duplicated sequences emerging
more recently than the other SDs on 22q11.2. The high
sequence identity among these three blocks may explain
why most pathogenic deletions are mapped to these
three blocks. Alternatively, phenotypes arising from
genes whose function is sensitive to altered copy number will incur an ascertainment bias of these deletions.
Overall, SDs on 22q11.2 share many similar and
known features with other SDs in the human genome in
addition to Alu enrichment discussed above. The cluster
of SDs in eight blocks is a testament of “preferential
attachment” [35] or “duplication shadowing”, meaning
that unique regions next to SDs are ~10 times more
likely to be duplicated than random regions [16]. Our
syntenic analysis also suggests that most (~70%) 22q11.2
SDs are shared between human and chimpanzee but
only a small proportion of them is shared between

human and macaque, a finding that is entirely consistent
with previous proposition that SD activity increases after
the divergence of African great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla
and human) from the Asian great ape (orangutan)
[29,36]. Our current study used SDs in the human chromosome 22q11.2 as reference, and thus sequence amplifications occurring specifically in the chimpanzee, gorilla

and macaque genomes were not analyzed, but previous
studies have observed amplifications specific to those
lineages [24,29].
We found that Alu elements, especially young AluY,
were enriched in the immediate adjacent regions of frequently duplicated sequences (subunits, duplication loci,
and CNVs). Our results thus extend previous findings

that have shown the presence of Alu elements at the
endpoints of SDs at a higher frequency than expected
by chance (24% vs 10%) [15,16] and more specifically a
three-fold enrichment of Alu in the junctions of LCR16
[37]. In addition, we have previously shown that both
simple and complex Alu-mediated duplications stimulated by crossovers at the ends of Alu elements may
have contributed to the formation of unprocessed pseudogenes from the four LCR22 genes [14,26]. In Figure 7,
we show that most of the breakpoints are at the ends,
while a subset in the middle of Alu elements, suggesting
that homology based alignment is essential for CNV and
SD formation, but likely there two distinct molecular
mechanisms responsible, L1 endonuclease-mediated retrotransposition and NAHR events [14].
Taken together, these results suggest that de novo and
disease-implicated recombination events between
LCR22-2 and LCR22-4 may not occur randomly but

more frequently at Alu-embedding subsequences, an
interesting hypothesis deserving of further investigation
in the future. In this regard, it is important to mention
that common breakpoints found in the rearrangement
of distal LCR22 blocks in two patients [38] is located to
one of the highly active subunits identified in this study
(the subunit in red color at the end of the first duplication group in Figure 2B), supporting that our map of
duplications could be useful for studying human genomic disorders. Some interesting directions to further
explore our findings are, (i) Alu sequences may be preferential sites of double strand breakage after homology
based alignment [14], and (ii) chromatin modification in
the vicinity of Alu sequences may make a region prone
for duplications as local chromatin structure (e.g., accessibility) is an important factor influencing DNA duplication and its subsequent evolution [19,39]. Along the
same line, we should note here that AluY insertion sites

have been reported to show elevated recombination
rates [40]. Furthermore, we found that the recently
discovered recombination hotspot motif (CCNCCN
TNNCCNC) [41] was significantly enriched at the
breakpoints of both SD subunits (1.6-fold enrichment,
p= 0.026) and CNVs (2.3-fold enrichment, p = 0.016;
using data derived from our BAC mapping analysis) in
22q11.2.
In this report we describe our efforts of interpreting
large duplication events and employing cross-genome
comparison to narrow down the potential evolutionary
periods. Our work provides some important insights, but
also highlights the complexity and challenge ahead. It
is difficult to identify and time individual duplication
events that have left the mosaic genome architecture of
LCR22s as shown in Figure 2 and 3. During our study,
we explored other complementary approaches but without significant success. For example, we examined phylogenetic relationship of orthologous and paralogous
subunits using both human and syntenic sequences from
other primates, but the resulting phylogenetic trees were
often difficult to interpret or were only able to help
resolve the precise emerging times of a limited number
of duplication subunits, suggesting extensive gene conversion may have occurred among paralogous subunits.
It is clear that, to achieve more from cross-species comparison, we would need more great Ape genomes to be
sampled more densely at finer scale of evolutionary time.
Otherwise, it is like trying to re-construct primate evolution with too many missing fossils. Additionally, we
believe that low-coverage (e.g., 1-4x) sequencing will provide limited help. As an example, the syntenic regions of
human LCR22-2’ and LCR22-4’ in the reference chimpanzee genome contain some large gaps so that we were
unable to extract critical evolutionary information for
certain important duplication events in these two blocks
- their synteny was considered ambiguous in our analysis.
Our study suggests that special care must be taken for
comparing duplicated regions across genomes to resolve
the ambiguity between overlapping alleles and duplicated
paralogs with high level of sequence identity (>98%). In
order to employ comparative genomics to study the
molecular mechanism of genome disorders involving in
complex duplicated regions, we propose that an alternative and probably more effective strategy is to establish a
good reference of common CNVs for those regions. In
the case of LCR22s, this will mean specifically targeting
LCR22s for deep sequencing with a large number of
human samples. One critical challenge is how to distinguish duplications (i.e., CNVs) with high level of
sequence identity (>98%) from allelic overlapping when
sequence reads are too short to be aligned uniquely or
assembled correctly.

Conclusions
Our detailed analysis of the human 22q11.1 region
showed that many of its duplicated sequences emerged
recently through both small and large-scale duplications.
We also found a great number of copy number variations in 22q11.2 and some of them may be generated by
DNA recombination mediated by paralogous subunits
or young SINE, AluY. Our results suggest that genomic
rearrangements in 22q11.2 do not occur randomly and
active duplicated subunits, subunits adjacent to Alus,
and AluY elements all play a role in making some
sequences better substrates for recombination.
Methods
Segmental duplications, subunit identification and
classification

A total of 202 pairs of segmental duplications from
human chr22:17,000, 000-24, 000,000 (hg18) were
obtained from the segmental duplication track in the
UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). SDs
involving sequences outside of 22q11.2 were not
included, as our goal was to study the intra-LCR22 duplications implicated in human disorders. The pair-wise
alignment information of these SDs was provided to the
program RepeatGluer [22] for decomposing the 404 SDs
into 523 non-overlapping duplication subunits. This
approach is motivated by previous study [21,23]; a comparison of our subunits with those defined previously by
Jiang et al [23] with the same algorithm found that 69
subunits were only defined by us although the breakpoints for 84% of the common subunits differed <200 bp
in the two definition (see Additional file 4, Figure S3 for
details). This data suggest that inclusion of SDs outside
22q11.2 could have some impacts on our results.
Individual subunit sequences were classified to 122
families based on their sequence homology (>90% identity) (Figure 1) and segregated to eight duplication
blocks based on their physical distance. In the latter
analysis, we took the previous definition of eight LCR22
blocks as a guideline and assigned adjacent subunits
(<500 kb) to the same block. The selection of 500 kb
was to include as many SDs in the eight blocks as possible and to use one consistent threshold for all blocks.
As a result, some non-SD sequences embedded in SDs
were included in LCR22-5’, -6’, and 7’.
Constructing hierarchical map of putative duplication
events

As shown in Figure 1, SD pair-wise alignment data are a
good summary of the paralogous relationship for a pair or
a group of SDs but they do not directly reveal the underlying historical duplication events. Our overall strategy for
re-constructing past intra-LCR22 duplication events was

Guo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/71

to first merge overlapping duplicons to form individual
duplication locus, and then group duplication loci based
on SD pair-wise relationship, and then project all duplication loci to the largest duplication locus on a group based
on sequence alignment (Figure 1C). The resulting alignment map illustrated the hierarchical order of putative
duplications (Figure 2), as the donor and acceptor of a
duplication event would have the same subunits arranged
in the identical order, unless disruption had occurred.
With the caveat that sometimes duplications could produce a merged sequence and uncertainty of donor assignment grew for shorter SDs, we have only interpreted this
map for duplications involving long sequence and multiple
subunits, i.e., at the top of the hierarchy.
Syntenic analysis of SDs on 22q11.2

Multiple genome alignment data from the Ensembl site
(http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/compara/index.
html) was used to search syntenic sequences for human
22q11.2 SD sequences. More specifically, the pair-wise
alignment data was generated by the program Blastz-net
[42] between human and each of other three primate
species: chimp, orangutan and macaque. We first analyzed the synteny of unique sequences in human
22q11.2 and utilized the result to establish a global syntenic reference map. Then, the occurrence of aligned
sequence in the expected syntenic location on this map
was considered as evidence that a human duplication
subunit (or entire SD) had a syntenic partner in a subject species. To account for the confounding factors in
sequencing and assembling duplicated sequences, we
also considered syntenic sequence present if the syntenic
location of a human sequence was a stretch of “N”
nucleotides and homologous sequence was located in
unassembled contigs (e.g., chr_random). Furthermore, we
utilized the syntenic locations of two unique sequences
(i.e., landmarks) bracketing each human duplicated
sequence to help identify missing syntenic relationship;
the synteny of a human sequence was considered absent
if no aligned sequence was found in the expected syntenic location and the distance of the two adjacent landmarks in the target genome was 2x shorter than that in
the human 22q11.2. All these measurements certainly
cannot account for the draft nature of the non-human
genomes fully, so some degree of uncertainty is expected
from our syntenic analysis. On the other hand, we found
supportive evidence for our syntenic results from all 15
chimp BACs available in GenBank and mapped onto
LCR22. Specifically, 9 of these 15 chimp BACs were in
the regions where 22 subunits were found missing in
chimp; all of these 22 subunits were confirmed to be
absent from their respective BAC sequences.
We also carried out similar syntenic analysis using
either in-house constructed global alignments with

Page 14 of 16

BLASTZ [42] or cross-species liftOver data from the
UCSC browser and obtained similar result, and thus was
not discussed here. The comparative data of segmental
duplications in human, chimp, orangutan and macaque
based on Whole Genome Shotgun Sequences Detection
was obtained from a previous study [29].
Analysis of copy number variations in LCR22s

Previously annotated CNVs were collected from
three sources (the Database of Genomic Variants (
http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/, downloaded on August
2009); [31,43]). Also, 191 BACs or PACs were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank and aligned to the
human reference genome using the FASTA software
package [44]. Gaps of > 200 bp in the alignments were
defined as CNVs and annotated as insertions or deletions with respect to the reference genome.
Analysis of repetitive elements

In the search of sequence features associated with either
subunits or CNVs, we annotated the ± 10 bp sequences
adjacent to breakpoints as suggested previously [15,45].
Our annotation included micro-sequence homology
detection and the presence of repetitive elements as
defined by RepeatMasker. Here, micro-homology was
defined as > 80% identity of 10-bp sequences. To assess
the statistical significance of the Alu enrichment in subunits (or CNVs), we randomly put these subunits in the
human genome and calculated the expected number of
subunits with Alu elements. After repeating this procedure 1,000 times, we derived an empirical p-value for
Alu enrichment. This method was also employed to
assess the significance of gene and pseudogene enrichment in SD regions.
