Abstract
Background: Brucella species are Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacteria that cause
brucellosis in humans and animals. Sequences of four Brucella genomes have been published, and
various Brucella gene and genome data and analysis resources exist. A web gateway to integrate
these resources will greatly facilitate Brucella research. Brucella genome data in current databases is
largely derived from computational analysis without experimental validation typically found in peerreviewed publications. It is partially due to the lack of a literature mining and curation system able
to efficiently incorporate the large amount of literature data into genome annotation. It is further
hypothesized that literature-based Brucella gene annotation would increase understanding of
complicated Brucella pathogenesis mechanisms.
Results: The Brucella Bioinformatics Portal (BBP) is developed to integrate existing Brucella
genome data and analysis tools with literature mining and curation. The BBP InterBru database and
Brucella Genome Browser allow users to search and analyze genes of 4 currently available Brucella
genomes and link to more than 20 existing databases and analysis programs. Brucella literature
publications in PubMed are extracted and can be searched by a TextPresso-powered natural
language processing method, a MeSH browser, a keywords search, and an automatic literature
update service. To efficiently annotate Brucella genes using the large amount of literature
publications, a literature mining and curation system coined Limix is developed to integrate
computational literature mining methods with a PubSearch-powered manual curation and
management system. The Limix system is used to quickly find and confirm 107 Brucella gene
mutations including 75 genes shown to be essential for Brucella virulence. The 75 genes are further
clustered using COG. In addition, 62 Brucella genetic interactions are extracted from literature
publications. These results make possible more comprehensive investigation of Brucella
pathogenesis. Other BBP features include publication email alert service, Brucella researchers'
contact database, and discussion forum.
Conclusion: BBP is a gateway for Brucella researchers to search, analyze, and curate Brucella
genome data originated from public databases and literature. Brucella gene mutations and genetic
interactions are annotated using Limix leading to better understanding of Brucella pathogenesis.

Background
Brucella is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular coccobacillus which causes brucellosis in humans and animals
[1]. Brucella are taxonomically placed in the alpha-2 subdivision of the class Proteobacteria. Traditionally there are
six species of Brucella based on the preferential host specificity: B. melitensis (goats), B. abortus (cattle), B. suis
(swine), B. canis (dogs), B. ovis (sheep) and B. neotomae
(desert mice); two new species B. cetaceae (cetacean) and
B. pinnipediae (seal) have recently been discovered [2]. The
first four species are pathogenic to humans in decreasing
order of severity making brucellosis a zoonotic disease.
These Brucella species have been identified as priority
agents amenable for use in biological warfare and bio-terrorism and listed as CDC/NIAID category B priority pathogens.
Complete genome sequences of 4 Brucella strains are currently available [3-6]. A typical Brucella genome usually
has two circular chromosomes of approximately 2.1 MB
and 1.2 MB. There are approximately 3,200 – 3,400 genes
in each genome. The DNA sequences of different Brucella
spp. share greater than 90% identity [4,6,7]. Genome
sequences and annotated data are publicly available from
existing databases such as RefSeq [8], Swissprot [9], and
the TIGR Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) [10].
These databases come from different sources and have different focuses. Different data visualization and analysis
tools are also available in these database systems and
other genome analysis systems. A web portal that integrates these data and analysis resources will greatly help
Brucella gene research.
Brucella genome data in current databases is largely
derived from computational analysis without literature
support. It is partially due to the lack of a literature mining
and curation system. The large amount of literature data
can be used to not only validate the data obtained from
computational analysis but also provide new insights not
available from computational analysis. Literature mining
techniques are being developed rapidly in the context of
the genomic fields [11,12]. For example, Hu et al., [13]
describe a rule-based system, RLIMS-P, for literature mining and database annotation of protein phosphorylation
from MEDLINE abstracts. Stephens et al., [14] present an
association and function discovery method to extract
gene-gene interactions from co-occurring genes in
MEDLINE abstracts. Hoffmann et al. [12] list more than
20 main text mining repositories and systems that are currently available. Compared to basic keyword search, many
effective literature retrieval programs connect textual evidence to ontologies as main repository of formally represented knowledge. Ontologies are conceptual models that
support consistent and unambiguous knowledge sharing
and provide a framework for knowledge integration. Tex-

tPresso is a natural language processing (NLP) and ontology-based literature search engine with significant
efficiency in biomedical literature retrieval [15]. Since
computational literature mining techniques (e.g., TextPresso) still cannot guarantee precise retrieval, time consuming manual literature curation is required to obtain
accurate results for database storage. It is possible for
manual curation and computational text mining to work
together for rapid retrieval and analysis of facts with
standardization of the extracted information [16]. The
PubSearch literature curation software is a literature curation management system with a powerful manual curation capability [17]. Our strategy of integrating different
computational text mining tools including a TextPressopowered program with a PubSearch-powered manual
curation system has led to the development of a literature
mining and curation system coined "Limix" that is currently applied to Brucella genome annotation.
The brucellae infect phagocytic macrophages and nonphagocytic epithelial cells (e.g., HeLa cells) in vivo and in
vitro [18-20]. Brucella virulence relies on its ability of intracellular survival and replication. It is still unclear how
many Brucella genes are essential for intracellular virulence and how virulent Brucella genes interact. It is
hypothesized that mechanisms of Brucella pathogenesis
can be better understood by systematically annotating
Brucella gene mutations and genetic networks from all
Brucella literature papers.
We have developed the Brucella Bioinformatics Portal
(BBP) with focus on integrating Brucella genome data and
analysis tools from existing resources and annotating Brucella genes and gene-gene interactions from literature publications. The updated information allows more
comprehensive examination of Brucella pathogenesis.
These genome annotation systems, together with other
programs including publication email alert, Brucella
researchers' contact database, and discussion forum,
makes BBP an ideal bioinformatics portal for the Brucella
research community. The BBP website is publicly available [see Additional file 1].

Results and discussion
System architecture
A three-tier system architecture is implemented with two
Linux servers (Figure 1). Users submit database or analysis
queries using front-end web browsers via HTML forms.
These requests are processed using PHP/Java/Perl/(middle-tier, application server) against the Oracle relational
database (back-end, database server), or XML and MySQL
databases in application server. The result of each query is
then presented to the users through the web browser. The
BBP Oracle database stores all the data schema and data
for the programs developed in-house, including the liter-

The BBP system architecture for Brucella genome analysis and literature mining and curation
Figure 1
The BBP system architecture for Brucella genome analysis and literature mining and curation. A PubMed literature extraction and parsing program loads all Brucella-related papers from PubMed into the Brucella Limix database and the
TextPresso-powered text processing pipeline. An automatic literature update program also extracts Brucella papers published
in the recent and previous months. The Limix system provides an efficient way for literature searching and data extraction, edition, and submission by integrating computational text mining programs with manual literature curation and management features. InterBru integrates Brucella genome data from different data sources including our in-house curated data from the
Brucella Limix database. The Brucella Genome Browser (BGBrowser) features graphic visualization of Brucella genome data and
offers many analysis tools. InterBru and BGBrowser also share the same output page displaying comprehensive Brucella gene
and protein information.

ature MeSH data, ContactsDB, registration information,
and Forum data. The Brucella Limix and BGBrowser databases are implemented in the application server using
MySQL since both systems are modified from open
sources with MySQL as the default database management
system. The TextPresso XML database is also implemented
in the application server. Table 1 shows all the data and
analysis resources incorporated by BBP.
Brucella genome data query, browsing, and analysis
Two complementary programs, the InterBru database system and Brucella genome browser (BGBrowser), have
been developed for Brucella genome data query, browsing,
and analysis. Both programs allow query of Brucella gene

data from all four complete genomes: B. melitensis 16 M
[5], B. suis 1330[3], and B. abortus strain 9–941 [4] and
strain 2308 [6]. The InterBru web query interface allows
users to search Brucella genes based on different gene features such as gene name, locus tag, protein molecular
weight (MW) and isoelectric points (PI), RefSeq identifier,
and Swissprot accession number (Figure 2A). The Generic
Genome Browser, also known as GBrowse [21], is a popular genome browser tool due to its portability, simple
installation, and convenient data input and easy integration with other software programs. Developed as a member of the GBrowse family, the BBP BGBrowser program
provides web query interface and graphic representation
of specific Brucella genes, proteins, and RNA features (Fig-

Table 1: Public databases and software programs linked or used in BBP. Unique database identifiers (e.g., RefSeq ID) are usually stored
for linking to public database web pages. Brucella literature abstracts and full text PDF files are also extracted from PubMed. Software

ure 2B). BGBrowser also provides many data analysis programs for tasks such as annotating restriction sites, finding
short oligos, and downloading protein or DNA sequence
files. Both InterBru and BGBrowser share the same gene
information page, which contains detailed Brucella gene
and protein information and links to many databases and
analysis programs (Figure 2C).
The following is a typical scenario when a Brucella
researcher searches for more information about B. abortus
sodC gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD).
The user starts with querying "sodC" gene in InterBru (Figure 2A). Four Brucella sodC genes from 4 Brucella genomes
will be found, including one from B. abortus strain 2308
and one from B. abortus strain 9–941. The detail information about the sodC gene in strain 2308 is shown in the
detailed Brucella gene information page (Figure 2C). This
page includes basic gene information and through unique
database identifiers links to many public databases, such
as RefSeq, GenBank, Swissprot, InterPro, and PubMed.
This page also contains sodC-specific gene annotation and

genetic interaction data curated by the BBP team from literature using the Brucella Limix system. A link to the Brucella Limix is also available for users to annotate sodC
gene. A direct link to PubMed allows users to access all
Brucella sodC-related publications. Both DNA and protein
sequences are provided with additional links to internal
BLAST search services (regular Blast, Psi/Phi Blast, and
Mega Blast) where different Brucella nucleotide and protein sequence libraries have been created for convenient
use. For example, a simple Blastn search indicates that the
sodC DNA sequence in B. abortus strain 2308 is 100%
identical to that in B. abortus strain 9–941 but 99% identical to that in B. melitensis strain 16 M and B. suis strain
1330. The protein sequences in the four genomes are
100% identical to each other. The user is also directed to
the BGBrowser to inspect the genes next to sodC in the
genome, annotate restriction sites, or perform other analyses (Figure 2B). To get more information, the user can
submit questions in the BBP discussion Forum or email to
the Brucella listserv.

(e.g., RefSeq, Swissprot) for Brucella genes and proteins via different characteristics or identifiers. Here a user searches for Brucella sodC gene. (B) BGBrowser localizes the sodC gene and it neighbor genes in Brucella genomes and provides many add-on

Brucella literature search
Four computational literature search methods have been
developed to search Brucella literature: TextPresso for Brucella, MeSH browser, keyword search, and automatic Brucella publication update.

Textpresso is an information retrieval system available
from the Generic Software Components for Model Organism Databases (GMOD) [22]. It splits papers into sentences and further to XML-tagged words or phrases, which
are classified using categories of ontology. The specifically

Page 5 of 14

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:347

designed ontology can be used to query information on
specific classes of biological concepts (e.g., gene, mutant)
and their relationships (e.g., association, regulation). It
has been used in WormBase [23] and many other projects
[24]. We have adopted and extended TextPresso for Brucella literature text mining. Currently it stores abstract
information of 3930 Brucella publications. Among them
1083 papers have full-text contents. While it takes approximately 24 hours for TextPresso to preprocess these 3930
PubMed abstracts and 1083 full text PDF files in our
server, the online query process is fast (~0.5 sec/query).
MeSH is the controlled vocabulary of medical and scientific terms assigned by experts and used for indexing articles in PubMed. MeSH terminology provides a consistent
approach to retrieve information that may use different
terminology for the same concepts. The BBP MeSH
browser enables users to locate Brucella articles by the
MeSH terms in the hierarchical MeSH tree structure. Figure 3 illustrates the detailed tree display for those who
want to search for gene deletion.
A user can also search the locally built Brucella literature
database by keywords such as author, journal, year, issue,
and abstract. Although the Brucella literature database is
updated periodically, it may miss the newest Brucella literature publications. In order to capture this portion of the
literature, a BBP internal program has been developed to
automatically extract the newly published Brucella papers
from PubMed.
Brucella literature mining and curation system (Limix)
Although the text mining approaches efficiently provide
queried articles and even sentences, the retrieved results
are not precise and cannot be directly edited and stored in
database. By contrast, a manual literature curation and
management system usually allows edited literature data
to be stored in database. The Brucella Limix system is
developed through integrating literature text mining technologies (including TextPresso for Brucella, keywords
search, and latest literature updates) and the PubSearchpowered manual literature curation and management
program. Within one web page, a data curator is able to
perform computational text mining, copy highlighted text
from the computational search to an editable text field,
edit, and further submit reviewed results to the backend
database (Figure 4). Limix allows curators to conveniently
search, update, validate and insert gene information. Figure 4 shows an example of using Limix to search and
annotate phenotypes of a sodC mutation from Brucella literature. Limix is also a distributed curation system that is
capable of involving external experts to support our curation efforts. Direct submissions from scientists will help
keep the database as comprehensive, updated and accurate as possible.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/347

Literature-curated Brucella gene mutations and
pathogenesis
We have applied the Brucella Limix system for annotation
of more than 900 Brucella genes. Out of more than 200
possible gene mutations from TextPresso-powered computational search, 107 mutations are manually confirmed, and 75 mutated genes are found to be attenuated
inside macrophages or HeLa cells, or in an in vivo mouse
model. It suggests that these 75 mutated Brucella genes are
essential for Brucella virulence and pathogenesis.
Although this list does not include those genes with attenuated mutation phenotype but without defined gene
names, the number of attenuated mutations we have
found is much more than any single research or review
paper has discussed. The NCBI Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COGs) approach provides phylogenetic classification of proteins encoded in complete genomes [25].
The 75 Brucella genes are classified using the COG method
for further analysis (Table 2). It first confirms the wellknown pathogenesis mechanisms of Brucella type IV secretion system encoded by the virB operon [26], the BvrRBvrS two-component regulatory system encoded by bvrR
and bvrS [27], and the complete Brucella lipopolysaccharide [28]. Significant and stable attenuation are obtained
in Brucella strains with mutations (e.g., wboA) resulting in
the loss of normal lipopolysaccharide O-side-chain biosynthesis [29]. In addition, our curation clearly indicates
the critical importance of transport and metabolism of
various metabolites including amino acid, carbohydrate,
lipid and inorganic ions (Table 2). Since the brucellae survive inside phagosomes of eukaryotic cells, bacterial
attenuation after disruption of these genes suggests that
the corresponding metabolites are not accessible to the
bacteria inside the phagosomes, but they are essential for
intracellular growth. Limix has also uncovered many gene
mutations with important implications in understanding
Brucella pathogenesis. For example, studies with a B. abortus sodC mutant suggest that Cu/Zn SOD protects B. abortus from respiratory burst of host macrophages [30]. The
presence of an attenuated fliF mutant suggests a possible
role for flagella in virulence [31], and it further leads to
the recent discovery of a polar and sheathed flagellar
structure in the early log phase of a growth curve in 2YT
nutrient broth [32]. This finding has changed previous
dogma that non-motile Brucella species do not have functional flagella.
Literature-curated Brucella genetic interactions and
pathogenesis
Brucella pathogenesis relies on interactions between individual Brucella genes. Besides individual Brucella gene
mutations, we have also analyzed Brucella genetic interactions using all accessible Brucella literature publications.
As defined in the original TextPresso paper [15], Brucella
genetic interactions are retrieved using a TextPresso-pow-

ered method to search for sentences containing >= 2
'gene', and >= 1 'association' or >= 1 'regulation' categories. Such a sentence is counted as one match. A program
is developed to run pairwise searching of Brucella-related
publications for every two Brucella genes from 951 Brucella genes obtained from NCBI and EBI databases. Manual curation is performed to confirm if a possible
interaction hit is true (i.e., a true positive) and to assign a
gene ontology (GO) evidence code indicating the evidence of the finding [17]. Table 3 indicates that the
number of true genetic interactions found in Limix
depends on how many matches and publications are
counted as the cutoffs for TextPresso search and if full text
contents are searched for in addition to abstracts. On the
condition that only one match is required for positive hits
during computational text mining, 58 out of 1330 possible genetic interactions (true positive rate is 4.4% (58/
1330)) are confirmed to be true interactions if both
abstracts and full text contents are used, and only 17 out
of 38 genetic interactions are confirmed to be true (true
positive rate is 44.7% (17/38)) if only abstracts are considered (Table 3). This indicates that inclusion of full text
contents results in more confirmed results (58 vs. 17),
while inclusion of only abstracts leads to higher true positive rate (44.7% vs. 4.4%). It is possible to significantly
increase true positive rate by raising the searching threshold of the number of matches in case both abstracts and
full text contents are used. For example, the true positive
rate becomes 23.5% (50/213) if the cutoff becomes 2
matches from at least one paper (Table 3).
Limix also allows curators to add Brucella genetic interactions that are not detected by the TextPresso-based text

mining approach. Currently 62 genetic interactions are
available in the Limix databases. There are 48 genes
involved in these interactions, and 28 of them are shared
with the attenuated Brucella gene mutation list as discussed above. The finding of these genetic interactions has
provided more comprehensive investigation of Brucella
pathogenesis. For example, it not only confirms the
importance of type IV secretion system and the BvrR-BvrS
two-component regulatory system in Brucella pathogenesis but also provides specific pathway details. Furthermore, our curation results indicate that the secretion of
the N-terminal fragment of BvrR fused to a CAT report
gene is diminished in virB1 and virB10 mutants, suggesting that BvrR is probably an effector protein secreted by
the VirB type IV secretion system [33]. Another interesting
observation is the interactions among sodC, hfq, and ctrA.
B. abortus host factor 1 (HF-1) protein encoded by hfq contributes to stress resistance during stationary phase and is
a major determinant of virulence in mice [34]. Bacterial
sodC genes are typically regulated in a growth-phasedependent manner, and their expression is usually maximal during stationary phase. B. abortus hfq gene mutation
results in greatly reduced sodC expression [35]. CtrA is a
master response regulator that is essential for viability and
is transcriptionally autoregulated. The hfq gene is likely to
be negatively regulated by CtrA [36]. These two interactions suggest that CtrA may also regulate Brucella sodC
expression.
A software program based on Graphviz [37] is developed
to display all the genetic interactions in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format [38] (Figure 5). SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics and

ure 4 demonstrates the interaction between two Brucella
genes sodC and hfq. A future direction is to integrate our
curated genetic interaction data with known interaction
and pathway knowledge from existing databases, such as
KEGG [39], BIND [40], and DIP [41].

Other portal features: ContactsDB, Forum, and
publication Email alert service
BBP is designed to link international Brucella scientists
and researchers. BBP contains a ContactsDB database that
currently provides contact information for more than 100
Brucella researchers in the world. The ContactsDB can be
queried based on first name, last name, address, city, institute, state, zip code, and country. Any Brucella researcher
can also enter new contact information or update existing
information using an interactive web page. The BBP discussion Forum has been created to facilitate discussion
between scientists. Only registered BBP members can initiate a topic, reply to a message, or edit their own messages. Unregistered users can view all discussions. Up to
now more than 50 Brucella researchers from 18 different
countries have registered in BBP. Another BBP feature is
the Publication Email Alert Service. This service automatically notifies users of newly published papers within a
user-defined time interval. Those users who have not registered for this service can view new publications by visiting our automatic new Brucella paper updating website.

Conclusion
Many different databases related to Brucella genomes and
genes exist. A variety of computational tools are also available for functional genomic analysis. The Brucella Bioinformatics Portal is a gateway to provide or link functional
Brucella gene information and analysis tools useful for the
Brucella researchers. Besides summarizing Brucella genomics related databases and analysis tools in HTML formats,
we have also developed the InterBru database and the Brucella Genome Browser (BGBrowser). InterBru allows users
to search for specific Brucella gene information and provide links to existing databases. BGBrower provides
graphic visualization and analysis tools. Since most of
current Brucella genes and gene-gene interaction data are
derived from computational analysis and often lack literature support, we further developed several computational Brucella literature search tools for efficient retrieval
of Brucella articles. The Brucella Limix system is also developed to allow retrieved data from text mining tools to be
directly copied, edited and submitted to a backend relational database. The Brucella Limix system has been used
to annotate a large number of Brucella genes and to find
62 Brucella genetic interactions and 75 attenuated gene
mutations from literature publications in PubMed. These
annotated results provide more comprehensive understanding of Brucella pathogenesis. These programs,
together with other portal features including the ContactsDB and Forum, facilitate the Brucella research community to obtain and annotate Brucella genome
sequences in one website. BBP is the first integrated system for Brucella genome analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/347

BBP adopts and extends many open-source software programs for Brucella genome annotation including three
GMOD open-source software programs, GBrowse, TextPresso, and PubSearch (Table 1). Many interactive graphical interfaces (e.g., MeSH browser and genetic interaction
map) have also been developed for efficient literature
mining and database curation. While many NLP-based
text mining tools (e.g., TextPresso) significantly improve
the capability of biomedical text mining, an automatic literature retrieval tool that can be as accurate as manual literature curation still does not exist [12]. As far as we know,
among existing web-based dedicated genome databases,
BBP is the first to strongly integrate a literature manual
curation and management system (e.g., PubSearch) with
NLP-based computational literature mining techniques
(e.g., TextPresso for Brucella) into an efficient literature
mining and curation system (Limix). The BBP Limix system also provides a genetic solution for annotating other
genomes and genes based on published literature data.

Methods
Server and programming tools
This BBP system is built on two Dell Poweredge 2580 servers, one serving as database server and another as application server. Both servers are running the Redhat Linux
operating system (Redhat Enterprise Linux ES 4). The
database server is powered by Oracle 10g database management system. Two open source software programs,
Apache HTTP Server and Apache Tomcat, are installed as
the HTTP application server and the servlet container
respectively. Different programming languages including
PHP, Perl, and Java are implemented for development of
a variety of BBP modules. The two servers also back each
other regularly to secure the data.
InterBru and BGBrowser
InterBru is a web-based relational database system that
contains various Brucella data and links to public databases. The protein MW and PI are calculated from the protein
sequences
using
the
modules
(Bio::Tools::pICalculator and Bio::Tools::SeqStats) from
Bioperl [42]. The InterBru data can be searched by different features and sorted for proper display (Figure 2A). The
Brucella Genome Browser (BGBrowser) (Figure 2B) is
developed based on the GBrowse [21], one of the GMOD
software programs [22]. In order to speed up the query
process, all Brucella sequence and annotation information
for BGBrowser are stored in the database server instead of
flat files. Both InterBru and BGBrowser share the same
output page of detailed gene information (Figure 2C).
Blast@BBP
The Blast module in BBP uses the latest web server version
of BLAST obtained from NCBI [43]. It includes regular
BLAST services (blastn, blastp, blastx, tblastn, tblastx),

Page 11 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:347

PSI/PHI BlAST, Mega BLAST, and BLAST 2 sequences.
These services are implemented in the BBP application
server and can be used to search nucleotide or protein
BLAST libraries containing sequences from individual or
combined Brucella genomes. The sequence libraries are
updated periodically to reflect newly curated annotations
and when new genomes are added.
TextPresso-powered Brucella literature search
As a software program from the GMOD, Textpresso uses a
modified GNU license and is free for academic purposes
[24]. The TextPresso package is downloaded from the TextPresso website [24]. An automatic download program is
first used to download and extract from PubMed all Brucella-related article information, including titles, authors,
publish years, volumes, pages, journal names and
abstracts. A BBP script is also developed to extract all Brucella-related full-text PDF files from PubMed. The PDF
files are converted into plain text files using the open
source XPDF [44]. The converted full text together with
abstracts and titles are tokenized into sentences and then
to XML-tagged words or phrases representing different
ontology categories according to a pre-defined ontology
format. All the processed information, including fully
annotated abstracts, titles, full texts, citation information,
authors, years, keywords and categories, is indexed for
efficient query. A web query interface is installed and
modified for users to search against the indices and check
detailed matching records.
Brucella Limix
To develop the literature mining and curation system, the
PubSearch version 0.81 is first adopted and extended
from GMOD [22]. PubSearch is originally designed for
Arabidopsis in the TAIR project [17]. We replace the TAIR
data from the software download with new Brucella
genomic data from NCBI, Swiss-Prot and other repositories. Currently Limix stores information for 6033 Brucellarelated articles downloaded from PubMed, including
those without abstract content. The 20346 GO ontology
terms downloaded from the GO database [45] allow users
to associate Brucella gene names with specific GO terms.
Limix also includes batch mode loading of data from
other databases (e.g., PubMed and GO databases), and
data indexing. We have also modified many PubSearch
features to make it fit in with bacterial genome annotation. The PubSearch-powered page programmed in Java is
used as the primary Limix web page specifically for manual curation and management. Since TextPresso uses Perl
CGI instead of Java, we use a HTML frame inside the primary page to hold the TextPresso-powered computational
text mining program (Figure 4). The text mining HTML
frame also contains literature keywords search and automatic Brucella literature update programs. A JavaScript
program is developed to copy highlighted sentences from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/347

the text mining frame to an editable text field in the primary curation page.
MeSH Browser
The Brucella literature MeSH browser is developed by utilizing the hierarchy tree structure of MeSH terms downloaded from PubMed and stored in the BBP Oracle
database. MeSH Browser allows users to search associated
articles to a specific MeSH term in the MeSH tree by clicking and expanding the MeSH nodes. The nodes in the
MeSH tree can be dynamically expanded with no waiting
for pages to reload by using the Asynchronous JavaScript
and XML (Ajax) technique [46].
Publication email alert service and automatic updates
The BBP publication email alert service is initiated by a
subscribed user to specify the notification frequency
(daily, weekly, bimonthly or monthly) and the keywords
to be searched against the PubMed database. A daily Linux
cron job checks the subscription database, searches for
updates in PubMed, and sends the updated paper notification to the users through email. The automatic literature
update program allows all Brucella-related publications
from the current and previous months automatically
updated in the BBP website. It is implemented by dynamically querying PubMed for updated publications during a
certain month when the page is opened. This program is
also integrated into the Brucella Limix for data curators to
obtain the newest publications not stored in local publication database.
ContactsDB and forum
The ContactsDB database stores contact information of
individual Brucella researchers in an Oracle database. A
PHP program is developed for the users to query, submit,
and update contact information in the BBP ContactsDB
web page. The discussion forum program is also implemented with PHP and Oracle database.
