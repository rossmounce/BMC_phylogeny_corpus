Abstract
Background: Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is the largest member of the SIBLING family
and is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in dentin. DSPP is also expressed in nonmineralized tissues including metabolically active ductal epithelia and some cancers. Its function,
however, is poorly defined. The carboxy-terminal fragment, dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) is
encoded predominantly by a large repetitive domain that requires separate cloning/sequencing
reactions and is, therefore, often incomplete in genomic databases. Comparison of DPP sequences
from at least one member of each major branch in the mammalian evolutionary tree (including
some "toothless" mammals) as well as one reptile and bird may help delineate its possible functions
in both dentin and ductal epithelia.
Results: The BMP1-cleavage and translation-termination domains were sufficiently conserved to
permit amplification/cloning/sequencing of most species' DPP. While the integrin-binding domain,
RGD, was present in about half of species, only vestigial remnants of this tripeptide were identified
in the others. The number of tandem repeats of the nominal SerSerAsp phosphorylation motif in
toothed mammals (including baleen whale and platypus which lack teeth as adults), ranged from ~75
(elephant) to >230 (human). These repeats were not perfect, however, and patterns of intervening
sequences highlight the rapidity of changes among even closely related species. Two toothless
anteater species have evolved different sets of nonsense mutations shortly after their BMP1 motifs
suggesting that while cleavage may be important for DSPP processing in other tissues, the DPP
domain itself may be required only in dentin. The lizard DSPP had an intact BMP1 site, a remnant
RGD motif, as well as a distinctly different Ser/Asp-rich domain compared to mammals.
Conclusions: The DPP domain of DSPP was found to change dramatically within mammals and was
lost in two truly toothless animals. The defining aspect of DPP, the long repeating phosphorylation
domain, apparently undergoes frequent slip replication and recombination events that rapidly
change specific patterns but not its overall biochemical character in toothed animals. Species may
have to co-evolve protein processing mechanisms, however, to handle increased lengths of DSP
repeats. While the RGD domain is lost in many species, some evolutionary pressure to maintain
integrin binding can be observed.

Background
Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is the most centromeric of five tandem SIBLING (Small Integrin-Binding
LIgand N-linked Glycoprotein) genes that are clustered
together within 375 kb at 4q22.1 in humans [1]. Due to
shared intron/exon structures and exon-specific motifs, all
of the SIBLINGs have been proposed to have been
sequentially derived from a single ancient gene by duplication [1]. To our knowledge, there are no reports of any
of the five SIBLING genes being located outside of their
tandem gene cluster in any species. The SIBLING family
has recently been suggested to be included as a distinct
subclass (called the "acidic" gene cluster) of a larger cluster of genes, the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) [2]. The inclusion of the SIBLINGs gene
family into the SCPP gene cluster is due to the predicted
ability of all members to bind calcium ions and the observation that they all tend to remain clustered together on a
single chromosome for many species studied to date. All
SIBLINGs are expressed by cells responsible for the assembly and/or maintenance of mineralized type I collagen
matrices (bone and dentin) and for many years most were
thought to be limited to such calcified tissues. The human
DSPP gene is comprised of five exons, the last four of
which encode the ~1300 amino acid protein. Two other
SIBLINGs, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin
(OPN or SPP1), have been shown by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) analysis to be completely flexible in
solution [1] and DSPP is expected to also be unstructured
in solution. Like many other flexible proteins in biology,
members of the SIBLING family are thought to function
by binding to a number of different proteins using short
motifs that remain conserved while many of the intervening amino acids are permitted to change with time. A conserved MQXDD peptide motif encoded within the largest
and most 3' exon of DSPP is where bone morphogenic
protein-1 (BMP1) is hypothesized to cleave the protein (at
the amino-terminus of the first aspartic acid) into the
amino-terminal dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and the carboxy-terminal dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) in at least
type I collagen matrix-producing cells [3-6]. BMP1 has
been shown to cleave another SIBLING member, dentin
matrix protein-1 (DMP1), at this same motif [6,7]. (This
protease also releases the C-propeptide from type I collagen and processes several other secreted bioactive proteins
such as biglycan and members of the TGFβ superfamily
[6]). Human DPP contains the classic integrin-binding
tripeptide, arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD, a hallmark of
the SIBLING gene family) found 26 amino acids carboxyterminal to the BMP1-cleavage site.
Most (~85%) of the human DPP sequence is comprised of
a phosphorylated serine/aspartate-rich repeat domain.
The size of this repeat domain is unique to DSPP and
appears to have developed through many separate expan-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/299

sions of a nominal 9-basepair microsatellite-like repeat
encoding the phosphorylation tripeptide motif, serineserine-aspartate (SSD). It was established long ago that
tandem repeats of short DNA sequences are unstable.
They are susceptible to slip replication errors as well as
unequal recombination events during meiosis such that
the total number of the repeats can change in relatively
few generations. Humans, having recently (in evolutionary terms) gone through a population bottleneck, are a
genetically restricted species but we have recently shown
that the 3' 1 kb portion of DPP's repeat domain in 188
chromosomes selected from geographically diverse
humans had 37 different haplotypes due to various combinations of 37 SNPs and 20 insertions/deletions (indels)
[8]. According to the HapMap project http://hap
map.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, the human DSPP gene appears to
currently be within a recombination cold spot suggesting
that these recent indels were likely caused by slip replication errors. Similar repeat-length differences have also
been described for pig DPP [5]. Because most humans and
other non-inbred mammals have many different DPP
haplotypes involving indels, most individual animals are
heterozygotic with respect to this gene and analysis of
their DPP domains can usually be accomplished only by
cloning and sequencing of each allele. Furthermore, the
combination of repeat length polymorphisms and the
inherent difficulties of sequencing long stretches of microsatellite-like repeats have resulted in sequence gaps (N's)
in the DPP domain of many animal genome sequencing
projects. Indeed, deciphering of the DPP domain within
future genome projects may remain problematical as the
next generation technologies of high-throughput genome
analysis are relying on the compilation of short (40-100
bp) sequencing reactions that cannot be uniquely assembled for long stretches of microsatellite-like repeats.
The function of DSPP has not been fully defined. DSPP
was originally thought to be expressed solely in dentin
where it is by far the most abundant noncollagenous protein entrapped within the mineralized matrix. Due to its
high degree of phosphorylation that results in a high calcium ion-binding capacity, DPP has long been hypothesized to directly nucleate and/or control the growth of
hydroxyapatite crystals within the type I collagen dentin
matrix. Independent studies estimate that ~50% of the
serines in DPP are phosphoserines [5,9,10] making this
perhaps the most acidic and hydrophilic protein in mammals. In humans, all verified cases of non-syndromic dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentin dysplasia have been
shown to be due to dominant negative mutations in the
DSPP gene, many resulting from -1 frameshifts within
DPP's repeat domain [8,11,12]. In mice, the Dspp-null
mutation is recessive and homozygotic null mice have a
dentinogenesis imperfecta phenotype with incomplete
mineralization of the dentin matrix [13]. Recent work

showing that the Dspp-null mouse was not completely rescued by expression of the DSP domain alone [14] suggests
that the DPP domain plays an important direct or indirect
role in dentin matrix production and/or mineralization.
All of the SIBLINGs including DSPP, however, have also
been shown to be expressed in the epithelial cells of ducts
such as salivary gland, kidney, and sweat glands of both
primates and rodents [15-18]. Because they are not
expressed within the passive ducts of the lachrymal gland,
we have hypothesized that expression of DSPP and all
other SIBLINGs may be important in metabolically active
ducts [15] and their associated cancers [19], perhaps by
interacting with specific members of the matrix metalloproteinase family [20]. Interestingly, mutations in DSPP
that are known to cause dominant negative defects in
human dentin have not been reported to affect these soft
tissues. The homozygotic Dspp-null mouse, however, has
been reported to exhibit aberrant organogenesis in the
kidney and the lung although no adult phenotype was
reported to be associated with these soft tissue [21].
In this report, the sequences of the DPP in lizard, chicken,
and 26 mammalian species (including at least one member of each major branch of the mammalian phylogenetic
tree) were analyzed to investigate through an evolutionary
lens, the retained motifs and thereby the possible functions of this unusual protein. We examined toothless animals to address the hypothesis that the DPP portion of
DSPP may perform an irreplaceable function only in dentin.

Methods
Identification of DPP in mammals, chicken and lizard
As specifically denoted in Table 1, the DPP sequences used
in this study were obtained by one of the following methods: 1) previously annotated and complete sequences
found in noted databases or identified as being related to
DSPP on the UCSC genome browser http://
genome.ucsc.edu; 2) derived from scaffolds on the UCSC
browser as open reading frames and appropriately located
within the SIBLING-SPARCL1 gene cluster but not specifically identified as DSPP/DPP; 3) manual scanning of all
open reading frames in conjunction with the SplicePort
program http://spliceport.cs.umd.edu/ for conserved
motifs within possible exons 5' to DMP1 and up to the
SPARCL1 gene when present; 4) PCR amplification of
genomic DNA of species whose DSPP/DPP domain was
partially complete and available on one of the databases
but required cloning and sequencing to complete DPP's
repetitive domain; and 5) PCR amplification/cloning/
sequencing of genomic DNA from species with no published DPP sequences. Novel sequences were submitted to
GenBank (FJ204896-FJ204920 and FJ204922-FJ204927).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/299

PCR, Cloning, and Sequencing of DPP
Genomic DNA was obtained from a variety of generous
sources noted in Table 1. Genomic DNA (50-300 ng) was
thermocycled with Platinum® Taq DNA-Polymerase (Invitrogen) using 0.1 mM dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 μM
each of forward (AGTCCATGCAAGGAGATGATCC) and
reverse
(CTAATCATCACTGGTTGAGTGG)
primers.
Standard PCR conditions: 94°C for 5 min followed by 35
cycles (94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, 3 min at 72°C)
and a final 5 min at 72°C. Opossum, manatee, whale,
dolphin, and giant anteater required optimized conditions (Additional File 1). Amplicons were gel-purified,
cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), and sequenced by
the NIDCR DNA Sequencing Core facility as previously
described [8]. All species were sequenced using the M13
forward and reverse primers associated with the cloning
vector while some species required the use of optimized
DPP-associated primers described in Additional File 2. To
separate true allelic differences (SNPs) from DNA replication errors cause by the Taq DNA polymerase itself, the
sequence of each allele was verified by the analysis of at
least 3 independent clones.

Results and Discussion
Identification and sequencing of DPP domain in mammals
At the start of this study, the complete DPP sequences of
4 species (human, chimp, mouse, and rat) were available
in GenBank from a combination of cDNA and genomic
results. Comparison of these relatively few amino acid
sequences showed that although there was a significant
difference among the species, fortunately the domains
that define the two ends of translated DPP protein (the
amino terminal BMP1-cleavage motif and the end-oftranslation domain) were sufficiently conserved to permit
the design of a small set of oligonucleotide pairs for priming the PCR reactions. Amplification of DPP from European hedgehog, eastern hedgehog, northern shrew, ornate
shrew, sperm whale, as well as three animals that are
toothless in adulthood (pangolin, fin whale, and
echidna) was unsuccessful suggesting that one or both
primer-annealing sites may occasionally become sufficiently unlike any of our current primer-pairs to permit
amplification in the PCR reactions. Following the protocols developed for the human DSPP studies, the DPP
amplicons from 22 species were completely analyzed for
at least one DPP-encoding allele. Except for highly inbred
species (e.g. guinea pig) two different alleles/haplotypes
that usually included both indels and SNPs of DPP were
observed in each genomic DNA sample although the
repeat domain of both alleles was not always fully
sequenced for every species. The spectrum of differences
observed between haplotypes from a single species were
similar to those described in humans [8] and pigs [5].
These differences were mostly characterized by synonymous C→T transitions and small indels. This study dif-

fers, however, from our previous approach of haplotyping
many different human DPP alleles. In the current study,
we compared differences in DPP motifs/domains among
many species using a single allele from each. For example,
we looked for characteristic motifs that had remained
invariant among human haplotypes such as the integrinbinding RGD motif and asked if this motif was conserved
among other species. In general, the longest available
allele for each species was arbitrarily used for analysis in
this study and if a motif was found to be different in a new
species (e.g. loss of RGD), that difference was verified in
the second allele. (Data of second allele for species are not
shown). Figure 1 is a molecular phylogenetic tree illustrating one combined set of estimates (from a variety of published sources [22-32]) of the relationships of all the
species for which at least portions of the DPP domain
sequences have been obtained. For 26 mammalian species and the lizard (green anole), the complete DPP
sequence was obtained. For two species (bat and horse),
we were able to obtain amplicons but we were unsuccessful in compiling a complete sequence of either allele.
However, the 5' non-repetitive region of cloned horse
DPP was deemed accurate and direct sequencing of the
bat amplicon yielded sequence information used in some
analyses.
Conservation of the BMP1-cleavage domain in DPP
The amino-terminal sequence of DPP has been known for
many years to start with aspartate-aspartate-proline
(DDP) [9]. This sequence corresponds to the motif,

MQGDDP, in the deduced sequences of DSPP. The protein encoded by DSPP's 3' neighbor SIBLING gene, DMP1,
has been shown to be cleaved at the same motif by the tolloid-related metalloprotease, BMP1 [6,7]. Although not
yet directly proven, it has been hypothesized that BMP1
will also be the protein that cleaves human DSPP into
DSP and DPP. In all of the mammals successfully investigated, including the distantly related monotremes, platypus (~230 million years ago, MYA) and marsupials
(opossum, ~180 MYA), have conserved the MQXDD
motif suggesting that the ability to separate DSP from DPP
using the BMP1/tolloid protease family is retained
throughout mammalian evolution. 19 of the 21 (90%) of
the mammalian species whose BMP1-cleavage motif was
independently sequenced (i.e., not the result of the 5' PCR
primer) contained the smallest amino acid, glycine (G), in
the variable "X" position (Figure 2A). The guinea pig had
the next largest amino acid, alanine (A), and the gray
short-tailed opossum had the much larger and charged
amino acid, arginine (R). While the presence of an
arginine at the -1 position of a tolloid-related protease
cleavage site is not novel [33], it is important to eventually
verify that DPP isolated from the dentin of short-tailed
opossum begins with the classic aspartate-aspartate-proline (DDP) amino acid sequence. Interestingly, the kangaroo rat is noted in the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/ for this region of DSPP
to have substituted a glycine for the second aspartate (D)
resulting in a MQGDG motif. The first aspartate is generally thought to be important for cleavage of nearly all of

BMP1's protein substrates [33], but the importance of the
second aspartate has not been experimentally tested in
either DSPP or DMP1.
For the other 13 mammalian species in this study, the
sequences encoding the MQGDD motif were directly the
result of the 5' primer used in making the PCR amplicon
(underlined in Figure 2A). Therefore without verification
by an independent sequencing reaction, these 13 species
cannot be used to query the identity of the amino acid in
the "X" position. The 8 species whose genomic DNA templates did not result in amplicons may have been the
result of: 1) synonymous changes that would affect priming but not coding; 2) nonsynonymous changes that
affect both priming and coding; or 3) completely missing
BMP1-cleavage and/or end-of-translation motifs. The
high degree of conservation of the BMP1-cleavage motif at
the protein level in all studied DSPP sequences, however,
does suggest that separation of the two domains (DSP and
DPP) is important to their proper physiological functions

in at least one critical tissue throughout the class of mammals. By comparison, the BMP1 cleavage domain in several species' DMP1 sequences predominantly had another
relatively small amino acid, serine (S), for the "X" in the
motif but other species had the glycine seen in DSPP as
well as the large polar amino acid, asparagine (N) (data
not shown).
Conservation of the RGD integrin-binding domain in DPP
The RGD tripeptide is one of the major defining motifs of
the SIBLING gene family and its presence is necessary but
not always sufficient for interaction with specific integrins
including αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, αvβ1, α5β1, and α8β1 [34].
For example, an intact RGD within both DMP1 and osteopontin (OPN) was necessary for supporting in vitro
attachment of specific types of cells expressing αvβ3
integrins while another SIBLING, bone sialoprotein
(BSP), was found to support such RGD-dependent attachment through either αvβ3 or αvβ5 integrins [7]. Changing
the RGD into the chemically similar KAE amino acids

Alignment of DPP's deduced amino acid sequences from the BMP1-cleavage domain through the RGD/vestigial integrin-binding
Alignment of DPP's deduced amino acid sequences from the BMP1-cleavage domain through the RGD/vestigial integrin-binding motifs. (A) Note the conservation of the BMP1/tolloid-related protease cleavage domain (MQXDD).
The underlined MQGDDP sequences were directly encoded by the 5' PCR primer during the production of an amplicon for
that species. Due to direct sequencing of the original amplicon, only a portion of the bat sequence was available. The conserved
RGD domains (red) are aligned with the vestigial tripeptides (bold). (B) In addition to the loss of their original RGD domains,
the platypus was found to contain an RGD domain in a portion of DSP while the common shrew had two RGD motifs within
DPP and 5' to the stop codon (*).

destroyed these interactions. Interestingly, OPN's ability
to effectively use the α9β 1 integrin remained cryptic until
thrombin cleaved this SIBLING at a highly conserved site
near the RGD domain [35]. It is not known at this time if
the RGD motif of intact human DSPP can interact with
any one or a subset of the RGD-dependent integrins and
support cell attachment in vitro. It will also be interesting
to eventually see if the integrin specificity of such interactions (if any) can be modified by cleavage at the BMP1
site.
While more than half of the mammals had the intact
integrin-binding motif within 20-28 amino acids downstream of the BMP1 cleavage site, 16 of the 35 (46%) species lacked the RGD. Most of the species that lost their
RGD motif within this region had sequences that were
presumably inactive remnants of the tripeptide (Figure
2A). At least one species within the orders Pilosa, Cingulata, Carnivora, Cetacea, Primates, Didelphimorphia,
Monotremata, Rodentia, and Soricomorpha, had lost this
RGD domain. (When two alleles from a single species
were available, the conservation or loss of RGD was
always verified in the second allele, data not shown). The
diversity of the animals missing the RGD domain suggests
that the requirement of DPP to bind to a cell surface
through this specific site was present in the ancestral DSPP
gene but was independently lost many times over mammalian evolution. Although several routes to RGD loss
can be observed, the most frequent change was the
arginine codon, CGA, changing into a glutamine, CAA.
This sense strand G-to-A transition likely reflects the
deamination of a methylated CpG dinucleotide to TpG on
the antisense strand similar to that previously noted for
other CpG motifs within the methylated human DPP
repeat [8]. (Deamination of the sense strand CpG motif
itself would result in a nonsense codon that would presumably be selected against.)
The appearance of RGD missense mutations widely scattered across the mammalian phylogenetic tree would
seem to support a hypothesis of harmless random loss of
the integrin-binding property with time. However, two
other observations need to also be considered; first, the
appearance of one new RGD motif in a DSP-encoding
portion of platypus DSPP and second, two new RGD
tripeptides near the carboxy-terminal end of the European
shrew's DPP (Figure 2B). These other RGD motifs caution
us to acknowledge that at least some animals may retain
the requirement for tethering DSPP to at least one cell
type through an RGD at some point during their reproductive life spans. In addition, it has not been empirically
shown that those DSPP/DPP proteins lacking the RGD are
functionally incapable of binding to integrins or other cell
surface proteins that do not require this specific tripeptide. Rat DSPP, for example, has changed the original

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/299

RGD into the presumably inactive HGD but it also has
acquired the REDV sequence within its DSP domain. This
tetrapeptide is reported to be involved in specific cell
attachment of splice variants of fibronectin [36]. In summary, it can be noted that nearly half of the mammalian
species do not require an intact RGD but it is possible that
the ability to bind DSPP/DPP to a cell surface may remain
under evolutionary constraint in some species.
Conservation of the Repeat Domain in DPP
DPP's serine/aspartate-rich domain generally begins ~5070 amino acids carboxy-terminal to the RGD (intact or
remnant) and continues until ~25-35 amino acids before
the stop codon. By far the most common element of this
domain is the phosphorylation motif, serine-serine-aspartate (SSD). The number of times this nominal tripeptide
was repeated differed greatly among mammal species
ranging from ~75 for elephant to >230 for humans. (SSD
motifs are highlighted in grey in Figure 3 and a larger print
version of Figure 3 is also available in Additional File 3.)
Except for highly inbred species such as the guinea pig, the
exact number of nominal repeats for a single species varied due to allelic differences. For example, among a group
of geographically diverse humans, we reported earlier that
the length of the repeat domain averaged ~700 amino
acids with 95% of haplotypes among 188 chromosomes
studied differing by less than 71 amino acids [8]. A DPP
repeat length variation was also reported among 8 pigs in
which their four haplotypes differed by up to 43 amino
acids [5]. Therefore, the sequences in Figure 3, whether
derived from database mining or new sequencing, represent only a single allele.

As first discussed in detail by McKnight et al. [8], the SSD
units in humans are likely to have originated with the primordial 9 bp sequence, AGC AGC GAC, and expanded by
a combination of slip replication and unequal recombination events. Single basepair changes, usually attributable
to deamination of the methylated CpG and CpApG
sequences, explained the most common variations within
tripeptides. It was also noted that virtually all of the ~450
serine codons within the human repeat domain were of
the AGC/T-type and not TCN-type codons. The only
exceptions to the AGC/T-serine codon rule were three
SKSD (and the single, related SKSE) tetrapeptides located
near the 5' end of the repeat (highlighted in blue in Figure
3). The four SKSD/E tetrapeptides not only used the TCNtype serine codon (TCA), they also accounted for 83% of
the positively charged amino acids within the entire ~700
amino acid repeat domain. Because the change of the
AGC/T-type serines of a SSD unit would require five
sequential single basepair changes to become a KSD, it is
reasonable to conclude that this motif was probably introduced a single time into the repeat domain and then

duplicated along with portions of the SSD repeat by slip
replication and/or recombination events.
As seen by the pattern of the blue-highlighted SKSD
tetrapeptides in Figure 3, the total number and general
location of these motifs are the same for all higher primates (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, macaque, and spider
monkey) although the number of nominal SSD repeats
between them differs to some extent. This difference is
probably due to slip replication events expanding or contracting the number of the microsatellite-like SSD repeats
similar to that seen within the modern human population. Interestingly, the more distantly related primate,
lemur, had additional (eight in total) SKSD motifs. This
expansion/contraction of a segment of SKSD-containing
sequences has apparently occurred by either slip replication or unequal recombination events in the ~75-80 million years since human, for example, shared an ancestor
with the prosimian lemur.
The patterns by which SKSD motifs interrupt the SSD
repeat domain in primate's closest mammalian relatives,
the rodentia and lagomorpha orders, show differences
with respect to each other and with primates. The closely
related mouse and rat species both have only one SKSD
motif found at the amino-terminus of DPP's repeat
domain (Figure 3). The two rodents' sequences are very
similar with respect to repeat length and lack of SKSD content but a closer look at other imperfections in the SSD
motifs illustrates differences in their repeat domain "texture". For example, the motif SSSSS (highlighted in green,
Figure 3) whereby the first SSD's aspartic acid group was
replaced by a rare third serine, is found eight times in the
mouse but not at all in the rat and only once in each primate. Furthermore, the pattern of interspersed dipeptides
motifs, predominantly SD and SN (related to the original
SSD/SSN motifs by loss of a single serine codon, highlighted in pink, Figure 3) also suggests many different and
presumably neutral evolutionary slip replication/recombination events within the ancestor of these two rodents
over the last ~15 million years to reach their texturally different but biochemically similar DPP repeat domain.
The other rodent (guinea pig) and the more distantly
related lagomorph (rabbit) both lack the SSSSS motif but
have many more SKSD motifs throughout their entire
repeat domain. This suggests that the common ancestor of
rodents and lagomorphs was probably rich in SKSD
motifs but the majority of the repeat was lost and replaced
with new SKSD-poor repeats by the time of the common
ancestor for mouse and rat. (We define a sequence as
being "SKSD-rich" if there were, on average, more than 2
SKSD units per 100 amino acids of repeat.) Whether this
occurred from a single large recombination event or many
smaller events, it demonstrates that over 70 million years,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/299

a repeat texture can be highly transformed but the overall
serine/aspartic acid-rich nature of the long repeat remains
intact. Molecular evolution studies estimate that lagomorphs and rodents separated ~82 MYA; guinea pigs then
separated from other rodents (i.e. mouse and rat) about
72 MYA [23]. At first, our data would appear to support
these molecular evolution estimates in that both rabbit
and guinea pig are SKSD-rich in contrast to mouse and rat
which are SKSD-poor. However, the apparent independent loss of the SKSD-rich repeat segments by the primates
since their separation from their common ancestor with
the rodents/lagomorphs shows that over such time spans,
virtually any combination of specific repeat texture motifs
may appear, disappear, and/or reappear in the DPP repeat
domain.
Most mammals with an intact repeat domain can be considered SKSD-rich. The exceptions include all currently
studied primates, elephant, rat, and mouse. Thus, most
superorders have both SKSD-rich and SKSD-poor animals
suggesting that both sequence types are successful evolutionary pathways and that both textures may appear and
disappear within evolutionary lines over time. A closer
look at SKSD-rich repeat domains also uncovered textural
differences. For example, the abundance and location of
the dipeptide motifs (highlighted in pink, Figure 3) are
useful to denote the differences and similarities of the
repeat domain in these species. As was observed for the
SKSD-poor domains, closely related mammals tend to
have similar repeat textures. For example, cow and
whitetail deer have long SKSD-rich repeats with many
dipeptide motifs while their more distant relatives, pig
and dolphin are also SKSD-rich but have significantly
fewer dipeptide motifs.
The observation in older literature that the amino acid
composition of DPP isolated from cow dentin was lysinerich [10] compared to the DPP of rat [9] and human [37]
dentin was the first indication of this evolutionary spectrum. Because both SKSD-rich (cow) and SKSD-poor (rat
and human) DPP appear to be well phosphorylated, the
presence of positive charges spaced along the repeat
domain does not appear to change the outcome of kinase
activities. However, verification by a single facility using
purified DPP from the teeth of two or more species of each
type would be required to definitively conclude that the
extent of phosphorylation in both SKSD-rich and poor
species is indeed equal.
The overall repeat always remained very acidic due to the
presence of many aspartic acids and the presumably phosphorylated serines. Among all the species studied, however, there were some exceptions to the SSD repeat motif
that went beyond the introduction of positive amino
acids as in SKSD motifs or the loss of a single codon. There

Page 10 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:299

were surprisingly few substitutions of the otherwise chemically similar glutamic acid (E) for the aspartic acid (D)
even though this substitution would require only a single
basepair change. This suggests there was strong evolutionary pressure on retaining D over E amino acids. Because
phosphorylation of serines also occurs near glutamic acid
residues such as in the SSEE motif found in the early exons
of many SIBLINGs, the restriction does not appear to be
related to a simple requirement for phosphorylation. (The
other acidic SIBLINGs (BSP, DMP1, and OPN) also permit many changes in their protein sequence but appear to
have similar restrictions on changes between the two
acidic amino acids within their respective acidic
domains.)
There was also a curious lack of threonine (T) that could
reasonably appear due to a single basepair change of a serine codon (AGC/T to ATC/T) within the repeat domain.
Threonine is chemically very similar to serine (S) and can
usually be phosphorylated by the same family of kinases
so we would have predicted this to be a neutral substitution with respect to most biochemical properties of the
phosphorylated DPP. Many species encoded one or two
threonines near the 3' end of the repeat domain, but few
species had any within the middle of the repeat. Perhaps
the efficiency of cooperative phosphorylation along the
complete length of the repeat domain by the appropriate
kinase(s) could be hindered by intervening threonines, a
hypothesis that can be tested in future experiments using
DPP sequences that have specific T-for-S substitutions.
Curiously, the single basepair change of the negatively
charged D to the similarly sized and polar but uncharged
asparagine (N) occurred so frequently in mammals that
the SSN can be quite common within of the overall "SSD
repeat" for most species.
There appears to be a limit on the other amino acids tolerated within the DPP repeat structure. Characteristic of
SIBLING genes as a whole and most specifically in DPP,
very few hydrophobic amino acids were observed. There
were only few exceptions to this rule. For example, one or
two isoleucines (I) were found in cow, Asian elephant,
and dolphin as well as the single valine (V) in manatee
and guinea pig. There were no leucines (L), methionines
(M), phenylalanines (F), tryptophans (W) or tyrosines (Y)
within the intact repeat domains of any species. Interestingly, mutations resulting from the loss of a single basepair within the DPP repeat changed its normally
hydrophilic amino acids (SSD) to predominately hydrophobic amino acids (I, V, and A, for example) causing
many cases of human dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentin dysplasia [8,11,12]. Proline was another amino acid
highly selected against in the DPP repeat domain with
only a single example (SKPD) occurring in armadillo
probably within what was previously a SKSD unit (Figure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/299

3). Two cysteines (C) were found within the repeat
domains of the platypus DPP although it is not known at
this time if intra or intermolecular disulfide bonds form in
the dentin or ductal epithelial cell environment in this
creature. (All mammals whose DSP domain is available,
however, encoded a single cysteine of unknown function
within this domain, data not shown.)
Next, we looked for correlations between SSD repeat
length and texture with biochemical properties and gross
tooth anatomy/function. We could find no obvious correlation between gross tooth phenotype and either the
length of the SSD repeat or its relative SKSD content. For
example, among carnivores with similar tooth structures,
the dog had nearly twice as long a repeat as the cat. Mouse
and elephant both had relatively short repeat domains
despite the obvious difference in the size of their teeth.
Animals that have teeth whose functional surfaces are
entirely enclosed in enamel had both long (primates) and
short (mouse molars) repeat length as well as SKSD-rich
(guinea pig) and SKSD-poor (primates) repeats. Similarly
animals with alternating enamel and dentin matrices on
their grinding surfaces also had long (whitetail deer) and
short (elephant) as well as SKSD-rich (cow) and SKSDpoor (elephant) repeats. While this would suggest that the
SSD repeat domain of DPP can perhaps be of any length
from ~70 to greater than 230 repeats and be either SKSDrich or poor and still result in high quality dentin, it
remains to be seen if there are some microscopic or biophysical properties we have failed to consider that correlate with specific repeat length and/or specific elements of
texture.
It is intriguing that although we have presented evidence
that closely related species have significant differences in
their specific DPP sequences (as witnessed by the texture
of the imperfect repeats), the total length of related species' repeat domains tended to be similar. At least among
our limited number of alleles sequenced for each species,
examples of difference in lengths of DPP (from their mean
value) included: humans and chimpanzees (whose shared
ancestor existed ~7 MYA) by ~2%; whitetail deer and cow
(~30 MYA) by ~4%; rat and mouse (~15 MYA) by ~5%;
and the two elephant species (~7 MYA) by ~7%. The two
dolphin species (~20 MYA) were a clear exception to this
observation among the mammals completely sequenced
to date, differing by ~33% from their mean. There are several distinct selective pressures that one can hypothesize
acting upon a gene product's composition over generations. Probably the one most commonly considered is
whether the final product (e.g., DPP), at its final location
(dentin matrix), performs its function in a way most
advantageous to the survival and reproductive success of
the species. However, the translation of the DSPP protein
itself as well as the addition of post-translational modifi-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:299

cations, packaging, and secretion are complex processes
that can also place selective pressures on the cells performing these critical functions. Odontoblasts make unusually
large amounts of this very acidic protein during dentinogenesis, probably second in abundance only to the two
alpha chains of type I collagen. In our laboratory, we have
had significant difficulty over expressing even the relatively short mouse DSPP using the same viral vector/cell
culture system that we have been successful in over
expressing the other three acidic SIBLING proteins (BSP,
DMP1, and OPN). We have been able to make small
amounts of human DSPP lacking nearly all of the repeat
domain [38], suggesting that the repeats may cause a significant portion of the problems during biosynthesis/
secretion. One example of a possible cellular stress is that
the cell must keep DSPP from precipitating or forming a
gel in the relatively high calcium ion environment of the
rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). Since the length of
the repeat may contribute to such stresses, slip replication
or unequal recombination events significantly increasing
the size of the repeat domain may be selected against
unless the animal co-evolves the mechanisms within the
cell machinery to deal with the increased stresses. In the
end, some species may, for example, be co-evolving the
benefits of a larger repeat (for as yet undefined functions
of DPP in the extracellular matrix environment) with the
increased stress of actually translating and processing this
very acidic phosphoprotein. It is not yet known if animals
that make significantly shorter DPP repeat domains,
translate more copies of DSPP such that the total content
of phosphorylated repeat in their dentin is similar to that
found in the dentin of mammals that make DPP with
longer repeats.
Serine, Glycine, and Asparagine-Rich Domains Before and
After SSD Repeat
The amino acid sequences between the BMP1 site and
beginning of the SSD repeat as well as immediately after
the repeat are rich in serine, glycine, and asparagine for all
mammals with an intact DPP repeat domain. These areas
usually contain several motifs for N-linked oligosaccharide addition (NXS/T), but identifying which of these
motifs are actually glycosylated has been solved only for
the pig [5]. It is not known at this time if this domain represents a significant retention of sequences due to selective pressures or merely the random drift of this domain
with time.

The amino acids near the stop codon (typically SDSNHSTSDD-stop) are interesting because they remain conserved even though a single base pair addition (or 2 bp
loss) anywhere within the repeat domain would rapidly
result in the appearance of a new stop codon and a foreshortened protein. As discussed above, the repeat lengths
can vary within a single species so the shortening of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/299

repeat length by a relatively late (3') +1 frameshift, resulting in a premature stop codon does not appear to be the
critical selective force behind the lack of such frameshifts
or other introduced nonsense codons. Rather, the nonrepetitive amino acid sequence near the stop codon itself
appears to be under direct selective pressure. Among the
toothed mammals in this study, platypus is the only species that has a short peptide extension (~9 amino acids,
highlighted in red in Figure 3) beyond the conserved carboxy-termini. It is interesting to note that we found the
carboxy-terminal regions (20-50 amino acids) of each
SIBLING to be among the most conserved and therefore
most useful motifs for identifying their respective
orthologs in more distantly related animals and this
observation appears to have held for DSPP.
Expression of DPP in Toothless Mammals
One way to help distinguish if a protein that is expressed
in several tissues is performing a critical function in one
particular tissue is to study the gene in species that have
lost that tissue/function. For example, Demere et al. [39]
recently showed that the genes of two enamel-associated
proteins, ameloblastin and enamelin, are degraded into
pseudogenes in baleen whales, animals that do not make
enamel. A short time later, Sire et al. [40] noted the loss of
the same two enamel genes in the chicken. With such
results, one can hypothesize that even if these genes were
expressed in other tissues, they cannot serve critical functions outside of the enamel. Although DSPP (DSP + DPP)
is the most abundant noncollagenous gene product
entrapped within the mineralized matrix of dentin, it is
also expressed in metabolically active ductal epithelial
cells including kidney, salivary gland, and sweat gland
[15-17]. Therefore, one goal was to analyze genetic conservation of the single exon-encoded DPP in species that
have lost their ability to make teeth. (DSP is usually
encoded within several exons that are not sufficiently conserved to permit similar PCR amplification and sequencing studies at this time.) Genomic DNA was collected
from available "toothless" mammals to test the hypothesis that the intact DPP domain of the DSPP gene may not
be important to species lacking dentin. Baleen whales capture their food using enormous filters made of keratin. As
mentioned above, they lack teeth as adults and at least
one species has lost two enamel genes, AMBN and ENAM
[39]. We found that one baleen whale (bowhead) had an
intact DPP domain that looks very much like other mammals including the relatively closely related dolphins (Figure 3). It turns out, however, that fetuses of at least some
baleen whale species develop and then resorb before
birth, a dentin-like tooth structure that lacks an enamel
covering [39,41]. It is not known if the retention of the
DPP domain in these animals is due to selective pressures
associated with: 1) the direct production of dentin in their
embryonic tooth structures; 2) DPP released during the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:299

biosynthesis of these temporary teeth modulating the
responses of other nearby tissues (e.g., baleen); or 3) critical expression of DPP in the kidney or some other nondental tissue.
The platypus, known for its sensitive, rubbery, and "toothless" bill, develops a single, functional if temporary "egg
tooth" (apparently used solely for opening its leathery
eggshell during hatching) and dentin-containing vestigial
molars that are lost by the time they leave their breeding
burrow [42,43]. We identified an intact platypus DPP
domain with a slightly elongated carboxy-terminus (Figure 3). It is curious that Dspp-null mice [13] produce at
least minimally functional incisors and molars (teeth that
seem likely to function well enough to serve briefly as an
"egg tooth" if required) yet the platypus appears to have
retained an intact DPP domain. Therefore, either the functional structure of the platypus tooth is more dependent
on DPP over evolutionary time periods than is the laboratory Dspp-null mouse or this acidic protein is participating
in some other, perhaps soft tissue function in this
monotreme.
The DPP domain of two genera of anteater (diverging ~13
MYA) that are toothless throughout their entire lifespan
were cloned and sequenced. As seen in the translated
sequences of Figure 3, each species independently introduced a stop codon near the beginning of DPP. The giant
anteater had a stop codon three amino acids after the
BMP1 motif while the Tamandua exhibited two single
basepair deletions leading to two successive frameshifts
about where the repeat would normally begin. The first
frameshift caused the production of ~30 alternative
amino acids (12 of which are hydrophobic) and then the
next frameshift caused the reading frame to shift into one
that had many stop codons. (A substantial amount of the
remnants of the repeat domains can be observed by translating all three reading frames beyond the stop codons.) It
is clear that if DSPP is translated, it will lack a discernable
DPP domain. (We did not, however, sequence the more
poorly conserved DSP-encoding exons which could also
have deleterious mutations in these two animals. If this
were the case, then the common ancestor of the two anteaters may have already lost their functional DSPP and the
mutations we observed in DPP may have occurred later.
The future publication of the entire DSPP-encoding
domain of either anteater genome will, of course, shed
light on this interesting point.) The only other Xenarthra
we successfully sequenced was the armadillo, an animal
with crude, peg-like teeth that contain dentin but little or
no enamel covering. This only living Cingulata shared a
common ancestor with the Pilosa order (anteaters and
sloths) about 9 million years prior to the divergence of the
two anteater genera and had an intact DPP domain (Figure 3). In summary, it appears that the two truly toothless

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/299

animals sequenced to date have independently lost their
functional DPP suggesting that DPP (but not necessarily
DSP) may perform a critical function only in dentin. The
extremely narrow diet and focused lifestyle of both anteaters, however, does raise an interesting question as to
whether or not the possible functions of DPP in their kidneys and specialized salivary glands, for example, are not
as important to the physiology of anteaters as they may be
for many other mammals. (Indeed, it is not known if
DSPP is expressed in ductal epithelial tissues in mammals
other than primates and rodents.) Therefore, the analyses
of the DSPP gene from other "toothless" animals would
be helpful in determining the validity of the hypothesis
that DPP may be required only for dentin.
Unfortunately our attempts to PCR amplify and sequence
the DPP domain was unsuccessful for the only other truly
toothless animal for which we could obtain genomic
DNA, the pangolin (Manis tricuspis). The lack of a PCR
amplicon at first suggests that this mammal may lack a
functional DPP domain, but as discussed earlier, we were
also unsuccessful at amplifying this domain from several
other species with fully functional teeth. We expect that in
the next few years, the pangolin genome project conducted by The Genome Sequencing Center at Washington
University in St. Louis School of Medicine, will elucidate
an entire DPP domain (or its remnant) or, as was the case
for several mammals in this report, at least the 5' and 3'
ends thereby permitting the design of new pangolin-specific PCR primers.
DSPP Gene Analysis of Non-Mammalian Species
The SIBLING gene clusters in Figure 4 illustrate the order
and transcription direction of the five SIBLING genes as
seen in all mammals completed to date. Except for a few
characteristic motifs, each of the SIBLING orthologs
undergoes a significant amount of change. Therefore, the
order of the genes is also highly useful information in the
search for specific orthologs in non-mammalian species.
Fortunately, the SIBLING genes are also often flanked on
one side by the conserved SPARCL1 (known in some species as HEVIN or MAST9) and on the other side by the
conserved PKD2 gene, making it possible to direct the
search for the DSPP gene within the gene cluster in nonmammalian species by association with one or both
orthologs of these two flanking genes. The data obtained
from the genome project for the reptile, green anole (Anolis carolinensis, Broad Institute AnoCar-1.0), was sufficient
to assign each gene in the SIBLING gene cluster by analogy
to motifs found in their mammalian orthologs (Figure 4).
Three reports briefly note the presence of a DSPP-like gene
in the lizard genome through this same approach [2,40];
although the stated gene order of DSPP and DMP1 within
the proposed stem amniote's SIBLING gene cluster (acidic
SCPP) is not the same as we observed [44]. Our analysis

of the contiguous sequence scaffold shows the order and
orientation of the five SIBLING genes as well as PKD2 are
the same as those observed in mammals except the gene
most resembling DMP1 is located at the 5' end of the SIBLING cluster, a location held by DSPP in all mammals to
date. The anole's DMP1 has the classic SSEE phosphorylation motif found early in the translated sequence, SGDD
glycosaminoglycan-attachment motif, MQGDD BMP1cleavage motif, and the characteristic carboxyl-terminus
(HNKPXXDXDDNDCQDGY*). (Although the anole
genome project is unfinished, no obvious SPARCL1 gene
was observed within the scaffolds immediately 5' to the
SIBLING gene cluster.)
The anole DSPP gene was defined by first locating the
DMP1 gene homolog and then manually searching for a
nearby large, serine/aspartate-rich open reading frame
within a contiguous sequence scaffold. A 1722 bp open
reading frame was found 3' to DMP1 and 5' to the anole
IBSP ortholog (Figure 4). This large open reading frame
encoded a classic BMP1 cleavage site (MQGDD) followed
16 amino acids later by a remnant of the RGD motif
(RGQ), a >250 amino acid serine/aspartate-rich domain,
and finally the DSPP-like SNNSTSDE motif near the
slightly extended carboxy-terminus (somewhat reminiscent of the platypus's extended DPP carboxy-terminus,
Figure 3). A short exon 5' to this large open reading frame
encoded a leader sequence that upon cleavage by the signal peptidase would leave a proline in position number
two of the mature protein. When this exon is spliced to
the large open reading frame, the translated protein

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/299

becomes linked to the first amino acid of next exon, a leucine, resulting in a mature protein starting with serineproline-leucine. As published previously, human DSPP
gene exon splicing results in a mature protein that starts
with a similar isoleucine-proline-valine tripeptide, where
the proline-hydrophobic amino acid dipeptide portion
appears to be necessary for correct processing of DSPP. A
variety of mutations that disrupt the biochemical properties of these two amino acids resulted in the nonsyndromic, dominant-negative dentin disorder, dentinogenesis
imperfecta (DGI) [8]. The sequences of the splice sites for
these two reptilian exons fit the classic GTAAG and CTrich domains, suggesting that this splice event could
occur. Furthermore, both splice sites have significantly
positive SplicePort http://spliceport.cs.umd.edu/ sensitivity scores of 0.5 for the donor site of the leading exon and
0.8 for the acceptor site of the large repeat encoding exon,
respectively. No other obvious open reading frames or
splice donor/acceptor pairs were observed in the ~2 kb of
sequence between these two coding exons suggesting that
green anole DSPP may have only two coding exons with
the second one containing both DSP and DPP-like
domains separated by BMP1 at the conserved MQGDD
motif.
We observed a reversal in the order of the DMP1 and
DSPP genes in this reptilian genome but not a reversal of
their transcription direction relative to the remaining SIBLING genes and PKD2 suggesting that a simple local
inversion of the two genes does not explain the changes.
Although a more complex gene reorganization explanation is possible, an interesting alternative possibility
exists. It is possible that a duplication of an ancestral
DMP1-like gene separately gave rise to both modern
DMP1 and DSPP. In this hypothesis, the 5' copy of the
reptilian line's primordial DMP1 retained its original
DMP1-like properties (i.e. BMP1-cleavage, glycosaminoglycan-attachment, integrin-binding RGD, and
carboxy-terminal motifs) while a repetitive SSD unit was
expanded in the 3' copy to give rise to the DSPP-like gene.
In the mammalian line, a similar SSD expansion occurred
in the 5' copy of the ancestral DMP1. These separate but
similar expansions of the phosphorylation sites on different copies of an ancestral DMP1 gene may have resulted
in the apparent reversal of the gene order between mammals and reptiles. Detailed comparison of the sequences
encoding the reptile's serine/aspartate-rich DPP domain
to that found in all mammals offers support for this
hypothesis. The repeat domain for the anole DPP is
encoded by both TCN-type (the bold S's in anole, Figure
3) and AGC/T-type serine codons throughout its entire
length. This is in stark contrast to the mammalian repeat
in which all serines are encoded solely by AGC/T-type
codons. (Both TCN and AGC/T-type serines are present 5'
to the repeat domain in mammals.) Sequential single

basepair mutations are highly unlikely to explain the large
number of differences between the patterns of serine
codon usage in lizard and mammalian DPP repeat
domains. It is more likely that expansion of different
nominal SSD repeat units from the ancestral DMP1
account for the biochemically similar but distinctly differently-derived repeat structures. In addition, the anole DPP
domain has independently acquired positively charged
arginine amino acids (blue highlighting in anole, Figure
3) spaced along the repeat length in a pattern similar to
the positively charged lysines (as SKSD motifs) in most
mammals. Thus, both lizard and mammalian lines of evolution appear to have independently developed DPP-like
domains containing extensive phosphorylated serine
motifs interspaced with positively charged amino acids.
The final species analyzed was chicken (Gallus gallus), a
toothless species that diverged from the common birdreptile ancestor ~210 MYA. Using the same approach as
performed for the anole, the 43.5 kb chicken SPARCL1SIBLING-PKD2 domain from the chicken genome project
(v2.1, Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis,
accessed through the UCSC Genome Browser) was
scanned for open reading frames corresponding to the five
SIBLING genes. Four chicken SIBLINGs (SPP1, OC116 or
MEPE, IBSP, and DMP1) on chromosome 4 were in the
same order and transcription orientation as their mammalian orthologs. The flanking genes, SPARCL1 and
PKD2, were also in the same relative locations and orientations as their orthologous human genes. In this sense,
our analysis of the database is strikingly different than the
recent report by Sire et al. [40], which concluded that
although the order of the chicken SIBLINGs and two
flanking genes were the same as in human, the transcription direction for each SIBLING ortholog, as well as both
flanking genes, were individually inverted (Figure 4). In
agreement with Sire et al. [40], we could find no large
open reading frames or significant remnants of DSPP in its
expected location between SPARCL1 and DMP1 or 3' to
DMP1 as was the location of the reptilian DSPP. The loss
of DSPP (presumably the reptilian form) in the evolution
of the toothless chicken supports the hypothesis that DPP
is important in dentin biosynthesis/function.

ylated serine/aspartate-rich repeat regions that are a hallmark of DPP. The integrin-binding RGD motif was found
to be independently lost in at least one animal in most
branches of the mammalian phylogenic tree. However
because one or more RGD motifs appeared at different
locations in at least two mammals that lost its original
RGD domain, we urge caution against firm conclusions
that binding to cell surface receptors by DSPP is evolutionarily neutral in all species. The conservation of DPP
and it's repetitive domain in all toothed mammals,
including two species that are toothless as adults (platypus and baleen whale), as well as the subsequent loss of
DPP in two truly "toothless" mammals (two genera of
anteaters) and chicken, does suggests that the physiological relevance of DPP may be limited to the formation or
function of dentin or dentin-associated structures, but
additional toothless mammals (e.g. pangolins) need to be
sequenced to strengthen this hypothesis.

Conclusions
Our analysis would suggest that the most recent addition
to the SIBLING gene family, DSPP, arose from an ancestral
DMP1 gene duplication and subsequent evolution into a
new gene that retained some of the DMP1 motifs (for
example, BMP1 cleavage and RGD) while gaining some
novel domains (i.e. a long and repetitive phosphorylation
domain). It is possible that different phosphorylation
motifs (using both AGC/T and TCN-encoded serines in
reptiles and exclusively AGC/T-encoded serines in all
mammals) were independently expanded many times to
give rise to biochemically similar but distinct phosphor-
