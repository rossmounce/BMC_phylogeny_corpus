Abstract
Background: The ascomycete Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) is one of the most
prolific producers of biomass-degrading enzymes and frequently termed an industrial workhorse.
To compete for nutrients in its habitat despite its shortcoming in certain degradative enzymes,
efficient perception and interpretation of environmental signals is indispensable. A better
understanding of these signals as well as their transmission machinery can provide sources for
improvement of biotechnological processes.
Results: The genome of H. jecorina was analysed for the presence and composition of common
signal transduction pathways including heterotrimeric G-protein cascades, cAMP signaling, mitogen
activated protein kinases, two component phosphorelay systems, proteins involved in circadian
rhythmicity and light response, calcium signaling and the superfamily of Ras small GTPases. The
results of this survey are discussed in the context of current knowledge in order to assess putative
functions as well as potential impact of alterations of the respective pathways.
Conclusion: Important findings include an additional, bacterial type phospholipase C protein and
an additional 6-4 photolyase. Moreover the presence of 4 RGS-(Regulator of G-protein Signaling)
proteins and 3 GprK-type G-protein coupled receptors comprising an RGS-domain suggest a more
complex posttranslational regulation of G-protein signaling than in other ascomycetes. Also the
finding, that H. jecorina, unlike yeast possesses class I phosducins which are involved in
phototransduction in mammals warrants further investigation. An alteration in the regulation of
circadian rhythmicity may be deduced from the extension of both the class I and II of casein kinases,
homologues of which are implicated in phosphorylation of FRQ in Neurospora crassa. On the other
hand, a shortage in the number of the pathogenicity related PTH11-type G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) as well as a lack of microbial opsins was detected. Considering its efficient
enzyme system for breakdown of cellulosic materials, it came as a surprise that H. jecorina does not
possess a carbon sensing GPCR.

Background
Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) was first
isolated in the tropics during the Second World War and
is found in soils, feeding on decaying wood and decom-

posing plant matter [1]. Since then strains of H. jecorina
have been isolated from numerous habitats around the
world. Its natural habitat indicates an evolution of H. jecorina towards recognition of substrates comprising celluPage 1 of 25

lose and hemicellulose, which requires development of
an adequate signal transduction machinery to optimize
energy consumption against energy (substrate-) availability. This speciation led to the highly efficient cellulase and
hemicellulase production of this fungus, which is presently also exploited by the biotechnological industry [24]. H. jecorina therefore has become a paradigm for the
enzymatic breakdown of cellulose and hemicellulose, but
is also known as a potent host for heterologous protein
production due to its strong inducible promotors [5,6].
Despite the industrial utility and effectiveness of these carbohydrate-active enzymes of H. jecorina, a surprisingly
small set of cellulases, hemicellulases and pectinases is
available in its genome [7]. Also the number of enzymes
comprising a carbonhydrate binding module in H. jecorina is the lowest among Sordariomycetes analysed so far.
Nevertheless, this limited enzyme set obviously does not
cause an evolutionary disadvantage in competition with
other cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading fungi. Since
in some cases in H. jecorina glycoside hydrolase genes are
clustered near genes encoding proteins involved in secondary metabolite production, it is tempting to speculate
that the success of H. jecorina might be connected to efficient control of expression of genes belonging to these
groups [7].
Apart from studies on the properties of these enzymes and
their regulation (for reviews see [5,6,8]), there has been a
continuing interest in understanding the role of fungi in
the carbon turn over in nature generally as well as of the
physiology of the organism and its interrelationship with
its environment. Accordingly, H. jecorina has recently also
been used to study the significance of carbon catabolite
derepression and cellulase gene expression for the antagonization of phytopathogenic fungi and suggested to be
used as a model organism for related studies [9].
Crucial for the prosperity of any organism is the ability to
survive under various conditions as well as to rapidly and
appropriately react to a changing environment, which is
mainly accomplished through an efficient signaling
machinery [10,11]. The tight regulation of the numerous
enzymes expressed by H. jecorina as well as its broad
industrial applicability suggest a sophisticated signal
transduction system, which provides the fungus with a
tool kit for adjusting to such different environments as the
soil of a tropic forest and a shake flask culture with a minimal medium. Nevertheless, while characteristics and regulation of the hydrolytic enzymes have been subject to
numerous studies for decades now, analysis of the signal
transduction machinery of H. jecorina is still in its start-up
phase. To date, only one signal transduction protein has
been analyzed on a molecular level: ENVOY, a PAS/LOV
domain protein is crucial for light tolerance in H. jecorina
and is involved in regulation of cellulase gene expression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/430

[12]. A recent study moreover indicates that this protein
has a more widespread function than only regulation of
processes related to light response in that it shows that
ENVOY influences transcription of genes with various
functions and does so not only in light but also during
growth in darkness [13]. Besides that, only one earlier
study dealt with a signaling event in H. jecorina: Mach and
coworkers [14] showed that calmodulin-antagonists
interfere with xylanase formation and secretion and
thereby provided a first hint as to the significance of Ca2+
signaling in this fungus.
However, the availability of the sequenced genome of H.
jecorina [15] now opens new possibilities for investigating
the potential of this fungus to perceive and interpret the
signals from its environment. Gene modeling revealed
9129 gene models for H. jecorina [7], which is relatively
close to the number of gene models in N. crassa [16], but
is roughly 2500 fewer than the number of predicted genes
in Fusarium graminearum [17]. Based on in depth analysis
of the genome of H. jecorina, this study therefore intends
to provide a basis for further investigation of signal transduction pathways by placing the H. jecorina orthologues
of members of common signaling cascades described in
other organisms in a genomic perspective. Characterized
functions of those genes are shown together with the
background of previous studies in H. jecorina and ascomycetes in general. Consequently a first map of the signaling landscape is laid out which shows both common
highways as well as uncharted territories with islands
reflecting the individuality of this organism.

Results and Discussion
Heterotrimeric G-protein signaling
Heterotrimeric G-proteins, comprising alpha-, beta- and
gamma-subunits, are essential components of the signal
transduction machinery in eukaryotic cells [18,19]. They
transduce signals received by the heptahelical G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) from outside the cell and
impact numerous regulatory pathways via their respective
effectors, which in turn effect activity of secondary messengers [20,21]. The G-alpha subunit is tightly associated
with the respective G-beta and -gamma subunit and binds
GDP in its inactive state. Upon activation following binding of a ligand to its corresponding GPCR, GDP is
exchanged for GTP and the G-alpha subunit dissociates
from the G-beta-gamma heterodimer. Both parts are then
free to activate their downstream targets [22]. With the
increasing number of sequenced genomes of filamentous
ascomycetes also a broad overview of the components of
the heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathway became
available and several studies now provide a comprehensive summary on this topic (for example [23,24]). While
heterotrimeric G-protein signaling has been studied
extensively in several fungi including closely related Tri-

choderma spp. and has been implicated in such diverse
processes as hyphal growth, conidiation, stress responses,
chitinase formation, carbon source sensing, production of
antifungal metabolites and mycoparasitic coiling [25-31]
the functions of the H. jecorina homologues are not yet
known.
Analysis of the genome revealed that H. jecorina has three
G-alpha subunits, one G-beta subunit and one G-gamma
subunit (Table 1), which corresponds well with the data
of Neurospora crassa [25] and many other filamentous
fungi [24]. However, considering the presence of 125 proteins comprising G-beta like WD-repeats in the genome of
H. jecorina, of which 22 are not synthenic in F. graminearum [7], it cannot be excluded that further functional Gbeta subunits exist, albeit as in other fungi, no evidence
for interaction with G-alpha subunits or a function comparable to G-beta subunis of these proteins is available.
While both G-alpha and G-beta subunits are well conserved in the fungal kingdom, the G-gamma subunit only
shares low similarity to its nearest neighbours (Table 1). A
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1A) showed that the Galpha subunits cluster well with the corresponding proteins of other fungi. The two closest homologues of the
fourth G-alpha protein of Ustilago maydis [32], tre38187
and tre43177, which comprise GTP binding domains
altered similarly to Gpa4 and unaltered GTPase domains
(Figure 1B), were included in this analysis. However,
these proteins did not cluster with Gpa4, but rather represent an outgroup in this tree. Consequently it is unlikely
that tre38187 and tre43177 are functional G-alpha proteins, although experimental evidence remains to prove

this hypothesis. Also a search for homologues of the
fourth G-alpha subunit of Aspergillus oryze, GaoC [23] did
not reveal a further G-alpha subunit in H. jecorina. Harashima and Heitmann [33] reported on G-protein beta
mimics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which contain 7 kelch
repeats and bind to the G-alpha protein Gpa2p. These
proteins (Gpb1p and Gpb2p) also assume a function in
regulation of filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae. While
initially considered G-beta and G-gamma mimics they are
now rather considered effectors of Gpa2p [34]. In H. jecorina, several Kelch-repeat proteins have been found, but
none of them contained 7 Kelch repeats or showed any
similarity to Gpb1p or Gpb2p. Also for the described S.
cerevisiae G-gamma mimic Gpg1p no homologue was
found. Consistently, such G-beta or G-gamma mimics/Galpha effectors have not been found in other filamentous
fungi so far.
G-protein coupled receptors
The signal to be transmitted through a heterotrimeric Gprotein signaling cascade is received by the plasma-membrane localized G-protein coupled receptors. Screening
the H. jecorina genome for heptahelical transmembrane
G-protein coupled receptors revealed a total of 34 such
proteins. They represent members of all but two classes of
GPCRs defined in filamentous fungi [24] (Table 2).
Besides the two pheromone receptors (tre18617 and
tre19688), two members of the class of Stm1-like putative
nitrogen sensors and one orthologue of the rat growth
hormone releasing factor homologue MG00532 of Magnaporthe grisea were detected. However, in contrast to
other ascomycetes, no members of the group of microbial

opsins or an opsin-related protein similar to N. crassa
NOP-1 or ORP-1 is present. These proteins function as
light responsive ion pumps or sensory receptors [25].
Analysis of N. crassa NOP-1 revealed a function in modulation of carotenogenesis and regulation of conidiation
specific genes and represents a putative green light photoreceptor, which is regulated by WC-2 [35-37]. The significance of this shortcoming in H. jecorina is difficult to
assess, since despite a lack of banding without light
pulses, conidiation still responds to light and this fungus
is not reported to produce carotenoids. Also a GPCR similar to the glucose sensors found in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe
and the carbon sensor GPR-4 of N. crassa [24,25,38,39] is
not present in the genome of H. jecorina. The genomic
locus of the H. jecorina homologue of N. crassa GPR-4
(NCU06312.3) obviously has been lost, because the genes
flanking the locus of this receptor in N. crassa
(NCU06311.3 and NCU06314.2) are synthenic in H. jecorina, N. crassa and F. solani [40], while GPR-4 and
NCU06313.3 have no homologues in H. jecorina. Instead,
it seems that an insertion has occurred resulting in a non
synthenic region comprising putative genes with low similarity to genes of filamentous fungi. On the other hand,
the groups of cAMP-receptor like proteins (5 members) as
well as the group of GPCRs related to the H. sapiens mPRlike protein (5 members) and the class of Aspergillus GprKlike receptors [23], which comprise an RGS domain (3
members), are expanded in comparison with other filamentous fungi [24]. The large family of PTH11-receptors
(21 members in N. crassa and considerably more in the
plant pathogens Magnaporthe grisea (60) and Fusarium
graminearum (105)) is present with numbers in the range
of the saprophytic N. crassa and thus clearly underrepresented in H. jecorina with only 16 members as compared
to pathogenic fungi. This is the lowest number of these
proteins present in the filamentous fungi analyzed to date
[24]. The shortage of these GPCRs originally identified as
pathogenicity-related in Magnaporthe grisea [41,42] could
be indicative of a saprophytic/non pathogenic life style
considering the also lower number of these receptors in N.
crassa.
Regulation of G-protein signaling
Regulation of the intensity of a G-protein mediated signal
is mainly accomplished by the action of phosducins or
regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS-proteins) [43-45].
Phosducins modulate the activity and availability of the
G-beta-gamma complex and are reported to be positive
regulators of G-beta function. However, recent data overturned the initial hypothesis [46,47] that phosducin
would block G protein signaling by disrupting the interaction between G-protein alpha subunits and the G-betagamma dimer. The current understanding of phosducinfunction rather suggests a regulatory influence as an essential cochaperone of G-beta-gamma folding [48-50]. In fil-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/430

amentous fungi two studies in Cryphonectria parasitica [44]
and Aspergillus nidulans [45] revealed that deletion of the
respective phosducin results in a phenotype similar to
deletion mutants in the respective G-beta subunit, an
effect also seen with Dictyostelium discoideum [51]. In order
to assess the position of the two H. jecorina phosducins
(tre80048 and tre29008) within the classification as
defined by Blaauw et al., [51], a phylogenetic analysis
with a subset of the proteins used in this study together
with the phosducin-homologues of several ascomycetous
fungi and those of H. jecorina was performed (Figure 2).
This analysis revealed that filamentous ascomycetes possess members of the class II phosducins, but – in contrast
to S. cerevisiae – they also have class I phosducins, whereas
only in A. nidulans members of class III of phosducin-like
proteins as in S. cerevisiae were found (Table 3). These
class I phosducins – with the exception of the M. grisea
protein – also comprise an N-terminal region with high
similarity to the 11 aa sequence conserved between the
two Homo sapiens subgroup I phosducins Pdc and PhlP1
[52], which is a major interaction site of the transducin Gbetagamma dimer [53] (Figure 3). Consequently, it
remains to be shown whether the function of these proteins is executed as cochaperones as could be assumed if
they are homologues of PhlP1 or rather resembles the
function of Pdc, i. e. to ensure efficient translocation of
the G-beta-gamma dimer during light and dark adaptation [50]. Since light response or -adaptation has not been
reported in S. cerevisiae and homologues of subclass I have
not been detected in this ascomycete, the elaborate studies
on yeast phosducins [54] cannot contribute to an elucidation of the underlying mechanism in other, filamentous
ascomycetes.
Regulators of G-protein signaling have an enhancing
effect on the intrinsic GTPase activity of G-alpha subunits
and thus can cause termination of the mediated signal
[55]. Comparably to A. nidulans [56], H. jecorina possesses orthologues of all four RGS-proteins of A. nidulans
(tre38047, tre78314, tre65607 and RGS1 corresponding
to RgsA, RgsB, RgsC and FlbA, respectively). Interestingly,
H. jecorina also possesses 3 homologues of the A. nidulans RGS-domain containing G-protein coupled receptor
GprK (tre37525, tre63981 and tre81383), which is the
highest number of these proteins in all fungi screened to
date [24]. Consequently, it appears that H. jecorina
applies tight control on the signals to be transmitted via
the heterotrimeric G-protein signaling cascade. That could
indicate that H. jecorina executes a thorough determination of the significance of the respective signal for its
downstream targets under certain environmental conditions.
Adjustment of the duration of a GPCR-mediated signal is
executed by β-arrestins, which have predominantly been

studied in higher organisms [57,58]. They contribute to
the desensitization of the GPCR after phosphorylation by
G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and thus promote termination of the G-alpha signal. Two candidate
genes encoding potential β-arrestins were detected
(tre14071 and tre39560), which have homologues in Gibberella zeae, M. grisea, N. crassa and A. nidulans. Among

them are the A. nidulans pH-response regulator protein
PalF (E-value 2E-103; [59]) and the A. nidulans carbon catabolite repressor protein CreD (E-value 2E-72; [60]).
However, despite several proteins related to mammalian
G-protein coupled receptor kinases, no protein of H. jecorina bearing a GPCR kinase domain (IPR000239) was
found. Therefore the mentioned phosphorylation step

Phylogenetic analysis of phoducin-like proteins
Phylogenetic analysis of phoducin-like proteins. In
contrast to S. cerevisiae, H. jecorina and other filamentous
ascomycetes possess class I phosducin-like proteins, but no
class III phosducin-like proteins. GenBank accession numbers
of the protein sequences used are those of the nearest neighbours of Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) (treXXXXX)
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC), Schizosaccharomyces pombe
(SP), Neurospora crassa (NC), Aspergillus nidulans (AN), Gibberella zeae (GZ), Magnaporthe grisea (MG), Cryphonectria parasitica (CP), Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), Drosophila
melaongaster (DM), Oryza sativa (OS), Homo sapiens (HS) and
Arabidopsis thaliana (At). The analysis was performed using
the Minimum Evolution method and 500 Bootstrap replications as test of phylogeny.

cAMP signaling
Cyclic AMP was found to activate a variety of glucoserepressed functions, including catabolism of carbon
sources but also to control numerous often apparently
unrelated functions in animal cells. Thus cAMP was initially proposed as a primitive signal for carbon starvation,
although also its effects on development and other specific responses have been subject to extensive analyses
since. In fungi, its effects reach from the control of utilization of endogenous and exogenous carbon sources and
conidiation in N. crassa, dimorphism and sexual development in several fungi and phototropism in Phycomyces
[10,61]. Addition of cAMP to cultures of Trichoderma atroviride induces mycoparasitism-related coiling around simulated host-hyphae even in the absence of lectins [28].
Crosstalk of the cAMP signaling pathway with the light
perception machinery has been reported in T. atroviride
[62,63]. In H. jecorina addition of cAMP can double the
efficacy of sophorose induction of endoglucanase formation [64], but this effect decreases if the concentration
exceeds the optimum. In yeast, the addition of a rapidly
fermented sugar to derepressed cells initiates a rapid, transient spike in the cAMP level [65] and intracellular acidification stimulates cAMP synthesis [66], although the
respective physiological role has remained enigmatic. The
studies of Farkas and coworkers [67], Sestak and Farkas
[64] and Montenecourt [68] on the correlation of intracellular cAMP-levels and cellulase formation during
growth on different carbon sources did not yield consistent results. Nevertheless, they suggest that cAMP might be
an important signal for regulation of cellulase formation,
but not the only one. Analysis of intracellular cAMP-levels
revealed a significant increase in response to a light pulse
[69], which is in concordance with the finding of a light
activated adenylyl cyclase in Trichoderma viride [70]. This
intracellular concentration of cAMP is determined by the
balance between the activities of adenylyl cyclase and 3'5'
cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. In yeast, Ras small
GTPases have been implicated in regulation of the cAMP
pathway and suggested to regulate adenylate cyclase [66].
However the precise mechanism of this influence has not
been established yet. The importance of cAMP signaling
for H. jecorina is highlighted by the finding of 5 putative
cAMP-GPCRs. However, the reception of cAMP as an envi-

ronmental signal by a GPCR in filamentous fungi remains
to be proven.
The genome of H. jecorina comprises one adenylyl cyclase
(ACY1), one adenylyl cyclase associated protein
(tre22793), one low affinity cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (tre35876) and one high affinity cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterase (tre32709). Similarly to N. crassa, H.
jecorina possesses 2 protein kinase A catalytic subunits
(PKAC1 and PKAC2) and one regulatory subunit
(PKAR1). The hypothesis that cAMP or a related molecule
could act as an environmental signal and initiate a signaling cascade by binding to a GPCR as suggested for N.
crassa [25] is corroborated by the findings for H. jecorina,
albeit such a function has not yet been shown for any filamentous fungus.
Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAP kinases)
Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways
represent one of the most prominent signal transduction
systems. The respective signaling cascades comprise three
serine/threonine protein kinases that act in series: MAP
kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), MAP kinase kinase
(MAPKK) and MAP kinase (MAPK) [71,72]. The signaling
output of these cascades often targets transcription factors
and is reported to be interconnected with cAMP-signaling
[10,73] and heterotrimeric G-protein signaling [74,75].
MAP-kinases are essential for appressorium formation
and virulence in M. grisea [76,77] and for fungal pathogenicity [78,79]. On the other hand, MAP-kinases are also
important for plant systemic resistance, biocontrol of
pathogenic fungi and mycoparasitism as shown for several Trichoderma spp. [80-83]. In N. crassa functions range
from sexual development and hyphal fusion [84,85],
osmosensitivity and resistance to fungicides [86-88] to circadian rhythmicity via the HOG1-orthologue OS-2 [89].

The most extensively studied example of the MAP kinase
signaling system are the pathways of S. cerevisiae [71,72],
the major functions of which are in osmosensing, filamentation, cell integrity, spore wall assembly and pheromone signaling.
Based on their homologues in S. cerevisiae and the pathways determined in this fungus [72] as well as according
to the interaction partners of the respective kinases as
determined using the Database of interacting proteins
(DIP services [90]) a model for the putative MAP kinase
cascades in H. jecorina was assembled (Figure 4). In H.
jecorina, nine members of MAP-kinase cascades were identified, none of which has been characterized yet. The functions suggested for these pathways were assigned based on
characterized homologues of the members of the cascades. Interestingly, in contrast to S. cerevisiae, which comprises five MAP kinase cascades, H. jecorina – similar to
other filamentous ascomycetes – apparently only has
three, for which functions in (i) pheromone response and
biocontrol, (ii) stress response and protein degradation
and (iii) osmosensing and potentially carbon source sensing are predicted. Homologues of the MAP kinases Kss1p,
involved in filamentation and invasion as well as Smk1p,
involved in spore cell wall assembly were not detected.
The MAP kinase cascade assigned to pheromone response
and biocontrol comprises the MAPK TMK1, the MAPKK
tre35500 and the MAPKKK tre39827. TMK1 represents
the H. jecorina homologue of Fus3p (E-value 1e-122) and
shares high similarity with Hypocrea virens TMKA
(AAN34610) and T. atroviride TMK1 (AAM69918), which
are involved in biocontrol [80,82] as well as with the M.
grisea pathogenicity MAP kinase Pmk1 (AAC49521; [76]).
The MAPKK tre35500 shares highest similarity to S. cerevisiae Ste7p (E-value 5e-65) and is related to Glomerella cingularia EMK1 (AAD55386; E-value 2e-178), which is

required for appressorium formation in this fungus [91].
tre4945 was assigned to this pathway because of its similarity to Ste11p (E-value 1e-90). However, due to the
interaction of Ste11p also with Hog1p and Pbs2p a participation of this factor in osmosensing should be considered. The second MAP kinase cascade consists of TMK2,
MKK1 and tre39827. TMK2 is related to S. cerevisiae Slt2p
(E-value 1e-122), which is the MAP kinase of the stress
response pathway, MKK1 shares high similarity to Mkk1p
and tre39827 is the H. jecorina orthologue of Bck1p,
which is a target for phosphorylation by protein kinase C
(Hypocrea jecorina orthologue: PKC1). An orthologue corresponding to the protein redundant to Mkk1p, Mkk2p,
was not detected in H. jecorina. The interactions of Slt2p
with the 26S proteasome regulatory protein Rpt3p and of
Mkk1p with the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit
Rpn1p suggest a role for this pathway also in regulation of
protein degradation. In this respect it should be considered that MAP kinase pathways themselves can be subject
to regulation by ubiquitin mediated degradation [92]. A
potential autoregulatory cycle in MAP kinase signaling
could thus be worth exploring. The pathway assigned to
osmosensing comprises TMK3 (E-value of 1e-175 to
Hog1p), tre30518 (E-value of 1e-98 to Pbs2p) and
tre29559 (E-value of 1e-140 to Ssk2p). The interactions of

logue of which binds to the cellulase activating element
CAE within the cbh2-promotor [93], suggest a role of this
pathway also in carbon source signaling. Moreover, the
tmk3-transcript was shown to be responsive to light and
regulated by ENVOY [13], which – considering the
involvement of the N. crassa homologue OS-2 in circadian
rhythmicity [89] – warrants a more detailed analysis of its
function in H. jecorina.
p21 activated kinases (PAKs)
Members of this protein kinase family are able to modulate MAP kinase pathways and can be activated by binding
to GTP-bound Rho-like GTPases of the Cdc42/Rac family
[94,95]. PAKs characteristically comprise a serine/threonine protein kinase domain at the C-terminus and a CRIB
(Cdc42/Rac interactive binding)-domain at the N-terminus. The CRIB domain can bind the serine/threonine
kinase domain and thereby inhibit its activity. This inhibition can be abolished by binding of a GTP bound Rholike GTPase to the CRIB domain. The best characterized
member of this family of kinases, S. cerevisiae Ste20p, is
often referred to as MAP4K because of its regulatory
impact on the Fus3 MAP kinase pathway. Ste20p is further
involved in pheromone response, response to osmotic
stress, filamentation and polarized growth and links the
pheromone response G-protein beta gamma subunits to
downstream signaling components [96,97]. Cla4p, the
second PAK of S. cerevisiae is involved in budding and
cytokinesis [98]. The H. jecorina genome comprises
homologues of the S. cerevisiae PAKs Ste20p (tre104364)
and Cla4p (tre28344). Both tre104364 and tre28344 also
contain the characteristic CRIB-domain at the N-terminus.
Germinal center kinases (GCKs)
Germinal center kinases represent the second group of
Ste20-like protein kinases [99]. These kinases are related
to the human germinal center kinase (GCK) and are
implicated in the regulation of stress activated MAPK signaling pathways. In contrast to the p21 activated kinases,
their serine/threonine kinase domain is present at the Nterminus of the protein and is followed by a poorly conserved sequence lacking CRIB or PH domains. These Cterminal sequences may contribute to the autoinhibition
of the kinase activity, which can be counteracted by binding of other components. H. jecorina contains one candidate germinal center kinase related to S. cerevisiae Sps1p
(tre45283) and three candidates related to S. cerevisiae
Kic1p (tre30044, tre61703, tre43532). Due to the low
conservation within this family, assigning functions to
these proteins and confirmation that they indeed are germinal center kinases will only be possible after functional
characterization.

Two component phosphorelay systems
Two component histidine kinase phosphorelay systems
represent conserved signaling pathways employed by
both prokaryotes and eukaryotes to adapt to changes in
their environment. Components of this system have been
characterized from bacteria, slime moulds, plants and
fungi, but they were not found in animals. Their functions
range from differentiation, chemotaxis, secondary metabolite production and virulence to adaptation to osmotic
stress [100]. However, since there are classes of histidine
kinases for which a physiological function remains to be
identified, this list may still be incomplete. Signaling via
two component phosphorelay systems in response to an
environmental signal is initiated by ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of the histidine kinase (HK) at a conserved histidine residue. Then this phosphate is
transferred to a conserved aspartic acid within a response
regulator (RR) domain, which ultimately causes a change
in transcription of the respective target gene or regulation
of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway [101]. Two
different types of two component signaling have been
described: With the simple histidine kinases the sensor
histidine kinase and the regulator receiver are separate
proteins, whereas hybrid histidine kinases contain both
HK and RR domains on the same protein and generally
require additional rounds of phosphorelay through a histidine phosphotransferase (HPt) and another RR protein
(Figure 5). In fungi to date only hybrid histidine kinases
have been identified and in general they are predominant
in eukaryotes, while simple HKs are predominant in
prokaryotes.

Although components of phosphorelay systems have
been analysed from several organisms, the most comprehensive survey on the mechanism is available from S. cerevisiae: The sole yeast histidine kinase Sln1p is part of the
two component regulatory system Sln1p/Ssk1p and
becomes activated by changes in osmolarity of the extracellular environment. Sln1p, the signal receiver becomes
autophosphorylated at an internal histidine residue. This
phosphate is then intramolecularly transferred to an
aspartic acid residue and finally to a histidine in the histidine phosphotransferase Ypd1p. Thereafter phosphotransfer occurs to an aspartic residue in the response
regulator Ssk1p. This phosphorelay system targets the
Ssk2p-Pbs2-Hog1 MAP kinase cascade, which also has an
equivalent in H. jecorina. As long as Sln1p is incative, the
unphosphorylated Ssk1p can activate the MAP kinase
kinase kinase Ssk2p, which can stimulate the Pbs2pHog1p cascade in order to induce glycerol synthesis in the
cell. Upon decreased osmolarity, the activation of this
MAP kinase cascade is repressed due to activation of
Sln1p, which phosphorylates Ssk1p [102].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/430

In N. crassa the response regulator protein RRG-1 is
involved in control of vegetative cell integrity, hyperosmotic sensitivity, fungicide resistance and protoperithecial development through regulation of the
osmosensitivity MAP kinase pathway [87]. RRG-2, the second response regulator protein of N. crassa, is involved in
oxidative stress response and the histidine phosphotransferase HPT-1 is assumed to negatively regulate a downstream MAP kinase pathway [103]. As for the hybrid
histidine kinases, members of class III are among the best
studied in filamentous fungi and are implicated mainly in
osmosensing, their target being the respective MAP kinase
cascade [104,105]. In A. nidulans, a recent study showed
that at least some of its histidine kinases are both spatially
and temporally differentially expressed during the cell
cycle [106]. The response regulators of this fungus are
involved in stress signaling and asexual sporulation [107].
Genome analysis of H. jecorina revealed the presence of
ten putative histidine kinases, all of them hybrid HKs (Figure 6) as characterized by the presence of a response regulator receiver domain (IPR001789), a histidine kinase
domain (IPR005467) and an ATP binding region
(IPR003594). Further domains present in the HKs of H.
jecorina were GAF-domains (IPR003018), which are often
found in phytochromes, a HAMP-region (IPR003660)
charakteristic for signaling HKs, PAS domains

age and in one case a bacteriophytochrome domain
(IPR009219). These various domains allow for the classification of histidine kinases as described in the following.
According to the classification of Catlett et al., [108] the
ten histidine kinases of H. jecorina belong to nine different
classes (Table 4) and only members of classes II and VII,
which comprise specialized HKs of C. heterostrophus, B.
fuckeliana and G. moniliformis, but no orthologues of other
fungi, are missing. As the functions of these genes are not
known, the significance of their presence or absence
remains obscure. Among the classes covered by members
from H. jecorina are also those which contain closely
related sequences from each species analyzed and are thus
likely to represent the core HKs of fungi (groups III, V, VI,
VIII, IX and X). The distribution of HKs among the groups
varies between N. crassa and H. jecorina. While the Neurospora genome comprises two phytochromes (class VIII)
and two members of group XI, H. jecorina only has one
phytochrome (tre39871) and one member of group IX
(tre30271). Interestingly, both groups are characterized
by the presence of PAS-domains and hence this might
reflect a more elaborate application of ligand- and presumably FAD-mediated signaling in N. crassa than in H.
jecorina. Nevertheless, the finding of a phytochrome indicates that H. jecorina is able to sense and respond to the
presence of red and far-red light [109]. However, the precise function of the phytochromes in light response of
fungi remains to be determined, since deletion of the N.
crassa phytochrome genes phy-1 and phy-2 did not compromise any known photoresponse [110]. Also in C. heterostrophus phytochrome deletion did not yield a
discernible phenotype [108]. On the other hand, studies
in A. nidulans revealed that the phytochrome FphA
represses sexual development and mycotoxin formation
in red light and that it is part of a complex comprising
LreA and LreB, the homologues of N. crassa WC-1 and
WC-2. Moreover FphA interacts with the light dependent
regulator protein VeA [111-113]. H. jecorina possesses two
class I HKs (tre28835 and tre32625) in contrast to one in
N. crassa. Due to the function of the S. cerevisiae class I HK
Ssk1p in osmoregulation, a similar function can be
assumed in H. jecorina.
Besides the histidine kinases as central components of the
phosphorelay, also one histidine phosphotransferase
(tre123344; IPR008207) and three response regulator
receivers (tre124302, tre44708 and tre31795) were identified, two of which correspond to the S. cerevisiae RRs
Ssk1p and Skn7p and could consequently have a function
in osmosensing or response to oxidative stress, respectively (Table 4). Among them, tre124302 corresponds to
the recently characterized N. crassa response regulator
protein RRG-1 [87] and tre44708 represents the H. jecorina orthologue of RRG-2. tre31795 contains an N-termi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/430

nal serine/threonine protein kinase domain additionally
to the response regulator domain and is related to S. cerevisiae Rim15p. This kinase acts immediately downstream
and under the control of the cAMP-dependent protein
kinase. Overexpression of Rim15 partially induces a starvation response [114].
The presence of hybrid histidine kinases and multistep
phosphorelays provides the fungus with a sophisticated
means to integrate numerous environmental signals by
differential regulation of the HKs and RRs. Since H. jecorina, as all other as yet analyzed fungi, only has one histidine phosphotransferase, this protein is likely to have a
crucial regulatory function on several output pathways.
Circadian rhythms and light response
Light is a crucial environmental factor for most living creatures. The presence or absence of light is connected to a
plethora of fundamental influences on the life of an
organism such as the intensity of harmful UV-light as well
as changes in humidity and temperature. Anticipation of
and appropriate adaptation to these changes inferred by
sunrise or sunset can thus provide a significant evolutionary advantage (for reviews see [115,116]). In the case of
fungi the presence of light also indicates growth over an
exposed surface, where the encounter of a potential mating partner can be expected and successful dissemination
or sexual development after disposal of spores and
conidia is enabled. This might be one rationale behind the
often reported effect of light on conidiation of fungi.

Photobiology in H. jecorina has only recently received
closer attention because of the finding that cellulase gene
expression is modulated by light [12]. Nevertheless, there
is only limited information available on circadian
rhythms and light response at the molecular level in this
fungus. A summary on light induced development in Trichoderma species with an emphasis on sporulation has
been provided by Betina and Farkas [117]. The main
reported responses to illumination described so far are a
rapid rise in the intracellular concentration of ATP, paralleled by an increase in the intracellular level of cyclic AMP
[118-120], a burst of respiratory activity as indicated by
oxygen uptake by dark-grown mycelia of Trichoderma
immediately after the onset of illumination [121] and initiation of photoconidiation.
H. jecorina sporulates well both in light and darkness,
albeit the amount of spores produced is lower in constant
darkness. In Trichoderma viride, the production of conidiation rings depends on the frequency of irradiation and is
not subject to circadian rhythm [117,122]. A similar phenomenon has been observed in H. jecorina: In the absence
of light pulses, H. jecorina sporulates continuously without detectable formation of conidiation rings both in con-

stant light or constant darkness (M. Schmoll, unpublished
results).
The central components of the signaling pathways triggering circadian rhythms and light response have been studied extensively in N. crassa (for reviews see [123-125]).
The most important input factors for the entrainment of
the circadian clock are light and temperature, the blue
light photoreceptor WC-1 (white collar-1) being essential
for the circadian clock and other light responses and WC2 (white collar-2) representing its partner in the light signaling pathway. Together these proteins form the white
collar complex and both components have been shown to
be required for all known light responses. This complex
binds to the promotor of the clock gene frequency (frq1)

and drives its expression. The respective gene product in
turn is able to dampen expression of its own transcript by
interaction with the white collar complex [124]. Besides
these central components also the small LOV/PAS
domain blue light sensor VIVID (VVD) plays important
roles in light responses and photoentrainment of the
clock [126,127]. The genome of H. jecorina comprises
orthologues of N. crassa WC-1 (BLR1, AAV80185, E-value
0.0), WC-2 (BLR2, AAV80186, E-value 1e-118), VVD
(ENV1, AY551804, E-value 1e-32) and FRQ (FRQ1, Evalue 0.0). Thus the central components of the clock are
available. The homologues of the H. jecorina photoreceptors BLR1 and BLR2 have been studied in the closely
related T. atroviride and are essential for blue light induced
conidiation [128,129], which is dependent on the carbon

source [63]. However, it is important to note that in T.
atroviride the env1-transcript could not be detected and the
genomic sequence indicates that functional expression of
this important light regulatory gene might be perturbed
[13].
ENVOY (ENV1) represents the first signal transduction
factor investigated in H. jecorina and was shown to be
involved both in light response as well as in regulation of
cellulase gene expression [12]. In addition, also darkrelated functions as well as both positive and negative regulation of light-responsive genes by ENVOY has been
reported [13]. Besides the PAS domain proteins described
so far (see also section Two component phosphorelay systems), no additional PAS-domain proteins were identified.
Further N. crassa clock-associated proteins with orthologues found in H. jecorina include the E3-ubiquitin ligase
FWD-1 (tre30183), which targets FRQ for degradation via
the 26 S proteasome and the light inducible BLI-3
(tre42044). Also three potential class I photolyases were
found, one of them representing the homologue of PHR1,
which is rapidly (auto-) regulated by blue light in Trichoderma harzianum [130-132]. tre59726 shares considerable similarity with DASH-type cryptochromes from other
organisms and is therefore likely to represent the H. jecorina homologue of the Drosophila melanogaster blue light
dependent regulator of the circadian feedback loop CRY1
[133] (Table 5). Both PHR1 and tre59726 share high similarities with proteins in N. crassa, other fungi and numerous bacteria. In contrast, tre77473 shows E-values below
1e-95 to proteins in higher eukaryotes, especially the 6-4
photolyases of Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis, and uncharacterized proteins of several filamentous fungi, but seems
to have no homologue in N. crassa.
Besides the casein kinase I HHP1, the N. crassa homologue of which is a homologue of D. melanogaster DOUBLETIME and involved in phosphorylation of FRQ [134],
two further candidate casein kinase I proteins have been
detected (tre30360 and tre12219). One of them
(tre12219) shows highest similarity to a vertebrate casein
kinase and seems to have no corresponding homologue
in N. crassa, since the best hit again was HHP1 (Table 6).
This protein is also highly similar to D. melanogaster DOUBLETIME and could thus indicate an expansion of this
group in H. jecorina. In contrast to N. crassa for which a
crucial role of casein kinase II in phosphorylation of FRQ
has been reported, H. jecorina not only possesses two
casein kinase II beta (regulatory) subunits (CKB1 and
CKB2) but also two casein kinase II alpha (catalytic) subunits (KC2A and tre38035). tre38035 has in most cases
the same homologues as KC2A, but the best hit is a casein
kinase II of Coccidioides imitis. Hence also in this group of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/430

casein kinases an expansion may have taken place. A further putative kinase involved in phosphorylation of FRQ,
the N. crassa calcium/calmodulin protein kinase CAMK
has two orthologues in H. jecorina: tre44095 and
tre18772. Consequently, these apparent expansions in
proteins involved in phosphorylation and thus regulation
of FRQ suggest that a more sophisticated regulation of the
regulatory cycles in which this protein participates may
occur. Characterization of FRQ in H. jecorina will elucidate whether this presumably more complex regulation is
reflected in a broader spectrum of output pathways. Moreover a glycogen synthase kinase 3 homologue (GSK3)
related to D. melanogaster SHAGGY, which is involved in
phosphorylation of the central oscillator component TIM
[133] was detected. Also a putative homologue of TIM
(TIMELESS) is available in H. jecorina (tre53569).
Interestingly, although no responses to red light have
been reported for H. jecorina so far, its genome comprises
a reading frame related to A. nidulans VELVET and one
candidate phytochrome like histidine kinase (tre39871).
Despite the fact that VELVET has initially been reported
for its involvement in red-light initiated conidiation in A.
nidulans [135,136], recently functions exceeding developmental regulation, namely repression of penicillin biosynthesis in this fungus [137] have been shown. Given the
lack of known red light responses, functions beyond regulation of development are also conceivable for tre39871.
It is intriguing that despite the presence of homologues to
the major determinants of circadian rhythmicity known
from other organisms, no such rhythmicity is obvious in
H. jecorina, at least with respect to the formation of conidial rings in the absence of light pulses. Nevertheless,
devoid of molecular data on potential rhythmic expression of at least a few genes, it is still possible that a circadian rhythm is operative, but that the output of the related
signaling pathway is disconnected from conidiation. In
this respect it is also interesting that H. jecorina only has
one of the three best studied output genes of circadian
rhythms described in N. crassa [138,139]: While the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase al-3, which is
involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, has a highly similar
homologue in H. jecorina (tre14246), no homologues to
al-1 and al-2 have been detected, which is a further hint as
to the presence of different targets of the output pathways
of circadian rhythmicity in N. crassa and H. jecorina. On
the other hand, both for H. jecorina as well as for the
closely related H. atroviridis it has been shown that numerous genes are regulated by light, which thus could be clock
components [13,140].

nal transduction machinery comprises Ca2+-permeable
channels, Ca-pumps and -transporters as well as numerous other Ca2+ signaling proteins. These components
cooperate to transduce various external signals [143,144].
The interaction of calcium signaling with the cAMP-pathway via regulation of adenylyl cyclase [145] suggests a
rather widespread function of calcium in regulation of cellular events. In this signaling cascade the calcium binding
protein calmodulin represents a central component which
in its Ca2+ -activated form is able to activate or inactivate a
number of enzymes including protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases and is important for regulation
of stress responses in fungi [146]. A comprehensive overview of calcium signaling proteins is available for N.
crassa, M. grisea and S. cerevisiae [146]. For H. jecorina it
was shown that calmodulin (CAM1) is required for formation and secretion of xylanases [14]. Further downstream components found in the genome of H. jecorina
include a homologue of the Ca2+/calmodulin dependent
Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin, which consists of a catalytic subunit, calcineurin A (CNA1) and the regulatory
subunit, calcineurin B (CNAB). In N. crassa, the function
of calcineurin was determined to be the regulation of
hyphal tip growth and branching [147]. Also a homologue of the N. crassa Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase CAMK-1 (tre44095), which plays a role in regulation of the circadian clock in this fungus by phosphorylation of FRQ [148] was found. 7 further putative Ca2+ or
calmodulin binding proteins have been detected in the
genome of H. jecorina (Table 7).
Calcium signaling is mediated via controlled release of
Ca2+ from internal stores. The first regulatory component
in the respective cascade is phospholipase C (PLC), which
becomes activated by extracellular receptors and catalyzes
the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate

to diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Diacylglycerol represents the physiological activator of protein kinase C and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induces the
release of Ca2+ from internal stores [149]. Thus phospholipase C has a central function in a transmembrane signal
transduction mechanism which is known to regulate several cellular processes such as metabolism, secretion and
growth. H. jecorina has four phospholipase C homologues
showing the characteristics of eukaryotic phospholipase C
proteins, but also one (PLC-E, ABG20593) with similarities to predominantly prokaryotic phospholipase C proteins. The latter one seems to have no orthologue in
Neurospora crassa (Tables 8 and 9). However, no such protein has yet been characterized from fungi and since bacterial PLCs are reported to have different enzymatic
characteristics than eukaryotic PLCs [150], their possible
involvement in signal transduction remains to be elucidated. Bacterial PLCs do not require Ca2+ for their activity
and are considerably smaller than their eukaryotic counterparts. Such PLCs have been shown to play a role in virulence in pathogenic bacteria, but in many cases their
precise function remains elusive. Interestingly, it was suggested that bacterial PLCs might be descendants from
eukaryotic PLCs that were incorporated by the bacteria
during evolution and that the loss of requirement for a
Ca2+ cofactor might have been evolutionary beneficial for
bacteria living as intracellular parasites [150].
For signal dependent alteration of Ca2+ concentration H.
jecorina has both calcium/sodium as well as calcium/proton antiporters, and calcium permeable channels available (Table 8). As for further components producing
second messengers it is interesting to note that in contrast
to N. crassa [25], H. jecorina indeed possesses a putative
sphingosine kinase (tre68412) which synthesizes sphingosine-1-phosphate.

Ras-like GTPases
The superfamily of small Ras-like GTPases comprises several subgroups (a subgroup hierarchy is given on NCBI
CDD for domain cd00876 (Ras): [151]) and regulate various cellular signaling pathways including cell growth,
differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis [152]. These
proteins represent monomeric GTPases that function as
molecular switches by cycling between an inactive, GDPbound and an active GTP-bound state. Activation of Ras
proteins is stimulated by guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (GEFs), which promote exchange of GDP for GTP
hence inducing a conformational change that permits
interaction with downstream effectors. The duration of
the active phase of Ras is limited by its intrinsic GTPase
activity, which is strongly accelerated by GTPase activating
proteins (GAPs). Thus GAPs can rapidly terminate the
respective transduced signal [153,154].

Numerous studies dealt with the elucidation of the function of Ras-like GTPases in S. cerevisiae. In this organism,
the Ras proteins are presumed to mediate signaling to adenylate cyclase [155,156], although this function has been
debated thereafter [66] and the same is valid for a potential activation of Ras2 by the G-protein coupled receptor
Gpa2 in yeast. Nevertheless a connection of Ras proteins
to the cAMP-pathway is obvious and a role for Cdc25 and
Ras in signaling of glucose availability has been suggested

([66] and references therein). However, for A. nidulans
RasA and cAMP signaling are reported to proceed independently during germination [157]. A further signaling
system targeted by Ras-GTPases is that of the MAP kinases.
Here especially for the pheromone pathway an involvement of Cdc42, which activates Ste20 in yeast has been
shown [71]. Ste20, which has an orthologue in H. jecorina
(tre104364), thereby triggers activation of the pheromone
response-MAP kinase cascade. Moreover the two component signaling response regulator Skn7 and the protein
kinase Pkc1 (putative H. jecorina orthologues tre44708
and PKC1, respectively) are downstream effectors of
Rho1-GTP [158]. Hence all three MAPkinase pathways
postulated for H. jecorina could be subject to regulation by
Ras-GTPases. Although detailed studies of Ras-like
GTPases in filamentous fungi are scarce, potential indications as to the functions of at least some of these proteins
can be deduced from their interaction characteristics and
roles in yeast.
The putative homologues to the members of the Ras
superfamily of small GTPases as well as GEFs and GAPs
found in the genome of H. jecorina were grouped into the
respective subgroups according to the presence of the
characteristic domains as determined by InterPro [159]
and NCBI CDD-search [160] as well as according to their

S. cerevisiae orthologues and their targets (in case of GEFs
and GAPs) (Table 10).
Interestingly, H. jecorina has a considerable number of
these small GTPases at its disposal, although due to the
lack of comprehensive studies in other fungi, this does not
necessarily indicate an expansion of this group. In Table
10 an overview of the groups present is given along with
the putative modulators (GEFs and GAPs), if a correlation
based on the yeast orthologues (GenBank, NCBI) was
possible. Consequently H. jecorina has at least 10 Rab-type
GTPases putatively modulated by 1 GEF and 6 GAPs, 9
Rho-type GTPases targeted by 2 GEFs and 4 GAPs, 5 Rastype GTPases subject to (de)activation by 4 GEFs and 3
GAPs, 7 Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor like) GTPases possibly influenced by 3 GEFs as well as one Ran-type and one
Rac-type GTPase, for which no regulatory factors have
been identified. Furthermore two GAPs have been found

In particular the orthologues of the Ras-subtype GTPases
RAS1 and RAS2 together with their modulators (tre34726,
tre107369, tre61408, tre22757) are reported to influence
the cAMP dependent protein kinase A [66] in S. cerevisiae
and are involved in a G-protein/cAMP/protein kinase A
signaling pathway regulating aflR expression in A. nidulans [161]. They could therefore have a function in the
processes connected to such a pathway in H. jecorina such
as cellulase gene expression or light response. Moreover a
function in regulation of conidial germination, morphology and asexual development has been shown in A. nidu-

regulatory bridge between cell surface receptors and this
crucial signaling system. Given the high number of Rassuperfamily genes found in the H. jecorina genome and
the numerous putative functions with predicted links to
almost every signaling system studied so far, elucidation
of their roles in signal transduction could contribute considerably to a better understanding of some as yet enigmatic phenomena.

Being an industrial workhorse, interest in signal transduction processes of H. jecorina has been limited so far. However, given the intriguing uniqueness of the enzymatic
machinery of this fungus [7], it is tempting to speculate
that sophisticated and efficient regulation of the surprisingly small number of degradative enzymes has enabled
H. jecorina to efficiently compete in nature. Therefore an
equally efficient system for perception and interpretation
of environmental signals is indispensable. Although signal transduction pathways of H. jecorina are largely comparable with those of other filamentous fungi, also in
several cases expansions of certain classes and missing of
others has been detected. These alterations as well as the
global signaling network optimized for survival in nature
despite certain enzymatic shortcommings is likely to provide insights into crucial environmental cues causing regulatory adjustments in H. jecorina, which can be exploited
to improve industrial fermentations.

Methods
Genome assembly information
The Hypocrea jecorina QM6a DNA sequence and protein
predictions of the Trichoderma reesei genome database
ver2.0 by the Joint Genome Institute http://genome.jgipsf.org/Trire2/Trire2.home.html were used for this study
(AAIL00000000). For comparison also the genome databases at the Joint Genome institute server [165] of the
Fungal Genome Initiative [166], especially those of
Aspergillus nidulans [167], Neurospora crassa [168], and
Magnaporthe grisea [169] were used.
Gene identification
In order to identify a specific gene, the putative orthologue of N. crassa [25] was used for a TBLASTN search on
the T. reesei genome database. If no orthologue was available in N. crassa, the orthologue of the organism in which
the respective protein had been characterized was used. In
cases where the assignment to a certain orthologue was
unclear (especially if the similarity was poor), the predicted protein model of T. reesei was again used for a
TBLASTN search in the respective genome to check
whether the respective protein was the true orthologue of
the protein used for the identification. In some cases the
model as provided by the automatic annotation was
adjusted manually, especially if the start- or stop codon

was used to generate the initial tree. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 128
positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were
conducted in MEGA4 [179].

The respective small GTPases are grouped according to their assigned
subfamily as suggested by the presence of appropriate protein
domains determined by InterPro and NCBI CDD search as well as
due to their similarity to known orthologues in GenBank. Guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins
(GAPs) have been associated with the respective GTPase(s), provided
that the regulatory target of the orthologue in yeast was known.

was missing or the protein model differed significantly
from orthologues in other fungi. The sequence information, protein- and domain predictions were used as provided on the genome database homepage and
crosschecked by NCBI CDD search [170]http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi,
InterProScan [159] and NCBI Blastp [171,172].
Genes and encoded proteins were denominated according
to the guidelines for T. reesei (H. jecorina) genome annotation: the name contains the prefix "tre" followed by the
protein ID of the best model as suggested by in silico modelling and annotation within the Genome Browser of the
Trichoderma reesei genome database ver2.0 or as determined manually by the respective annotator. If amino
acid similarity of the respective model to a characterized
protein exceeds 80%, these proteins are considered
homologues and the H. jecorina protein is named after the
homologous protein in three letter code followed by a
number. In any case, N. crassa denomination of homologous proteins is preferred. The Trichoderma reesei genome
database ver2.0 is publicly accessible free of charge.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX
(1.81) [173] and the alignment was manually adjusted by
the aid of Genedoc. The evolutionary relationships were
inferred using the Minimum Evolution method [174] and
the software MEGA4. The percentage of replicate trees in
which the associated proteins clustered together in the
bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the
branches [175]. The trees are drawn to scale, with branch
lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction
method [176] and are in the units of the number of amino
acid substitutions per site. The ME tree was searched using
the Close-Neighbor-Interchange (CNI) algorithm [177] at
a search level of 1. The Neighbor-joining algorithm [178]
