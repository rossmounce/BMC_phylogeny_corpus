Abstract
Background: Rosetting and cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells have been
associated with severity of malaria. ICAM-1 and CD36 are the main host cell receptors, while PfEMP1-DBLα is a
major parasite ligand, which can contribute to rosette formation. This study is aimed at demonstrating whether
the highly polymorphic PfEMP1-DBLα sequences occurring among Thai isolates causing severe and uncomplicated
malaria are associated with their ability to form rosettes and reflected the clinical outcome of the patients.
Methods: Two hundred and ninety five PfEMP1-DBLα sequences from Thai clinical isolates causing severe and
uncomplicated malaria were evaluated by sequencing and direct comparison using the specific text string analysis
functions in Microsoft Excel and Perl. The relationships between the PfEMP1-DBLα sequences were also analysed
by network analysis. The binding abilities of parasitized red blood cells (PRBCs) to CD36, wild type ICAM-1,
ICAM-1Kilifi and ICAM-1S22/A under static condition were included.
Results: Two hundred and eighty one non-identical amino acid sequences were identified (< 95% sequence
identity). When the distributions of semi-conserved features (PoLV1–4 and sequence group) within the rosetting
domain PfEMP1-DBLα were observed, close similarity was found between isolates from the two disease groups.
The sequence group 1 representing uncomplicated malaria was significantly different from the sequence group 3
representing the majority of severe malaria (p = 0.027). By using a simple non-phylogenetic approach to visualize
the sharing of polymorphic blocks (position specific polymorphic block, PSPB) and cys/PoLV among DBLα
sequences, the sequence group 1 was split from the other five sequence groups. The isolates belonging to
sequence group 5 gave the highest mean rosetting rate (21.31%). However, within sequence group 2 and group
6, the isolates causing severe malaria had significantly higher rosetting rate than those causing uncomplicated
malaria (p = 0.014, p = 0.007, respectively).
Conclusion: This is the first report of PfEMP1-DBLα analysis in clinical Thai isolates using semi-conserved
features (cys/PoLV and PSPBs). The cys/PoLV group 5 gave the highest rosetting rate. PfEMP1-DBLα domains in
Thai isolates are highly diverse, however, clinical isolates from severe and uncomplicated malaria shared common
sequences.

Background
Sequestration of PRBC in microvascular endothelium of
various organs is the unique property of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Cytoadherence and rosetting have been
associated with severe disease by blocking blood flow,
limiting the local oxygen supply and stimulating cytokine
production [1,2]. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1) and CD36 are thought to be commonly used
receptors [3,4], while the variant P. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) expressed on the surface
of PRBC is the major parasite ligand [5-7]. Plasmodium falciparum isolates from different geographical areas showed
variable binding ability to CD36 and ICAM-1 [8,9] and a
wide range of ability to form rosettes [10,11], which may
contribute to different clinical severity of malaria. Almost
all patient isolates bind to CD36 [12], while the binding
to ICAM-1 has widely different avidities among clinical
isolates [8] and is common among African patients with
highest binding in cerebral malaria [13,14]. In laboratory
isolates, ICAM-1 binding can be segregated into high and
low-avidity binders represented by parasite lines ItG and
A4, respectively [15]. Recently, the mutant proteins,
ICAM-1Kilifi (a major mutation detected in African populations) [16] and ICAM-1S22/A (alanine scanning mutagenesis of ICAM-1) have been demonstrated to affect the
binding ability of variant laboratory parasites A4, ItG and
JDP8 in comparison to wide type ICAM-1 (ICAM-1Ref)
[17]. It is possible that the similar patterns of mutagenesis
in domain1 of ICAM-1 affecting the binding of ItG and
JDP8 might be linked to their shared high avidity type
binding to ICAM-1 [18,19]. A4 had only some critical residues in common with ItG and JDP8 and differed in having a low-avidity ICAM-1 binding phenotype [17]. In fact,
cytoadherence of infected RBC to endothelial cells is a
multi-step process with various receptors contributing
synergistically to promote cell adhesion, such as that seen
between ICAM-1 and CD36 in mediating adhesion to
endothelium has under static conditions with CD36 meditating the majority of infected RBC [20,21], as well as
under flow conditions where the infected RBC appear to
tether and roll on ICAM-1, but bind strongly to CD36
[18,22,23]. Likewise, a correlation between severity of
malaria and rosetting phenotype could be found in P. falciparum isolates from patients in the Gambia, Gabon, and
Kenya [10,24,25], while the isolates from patients in
Papua New Guinea, Malawi and Thailand could not
[9,26-29]. However, the rosetting rate was associated with
high parasitaemia in Thai adults [28,30].
PfEMP1 is encoded by the var gene family in that the
switching between members is associated with changes in
antigenicity and binding phenotypes [31-33]. The extra-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/184

cellular portion of PfEMP1 is made up of multiple
domains including "Duffy-binding like" (DBL) domains
which bind to many host cell receptors according to their
sub-types, in which DBLα binds to CR1, CD31 [34] and
GAGs implicated in the rosetting phenotype while
DBLβC2 binds to ICAM-1. The cysteine-rich interdomain
region (CIDR) of PfEMP1 is able to bind to CD36 [35,36].
The study focusing on DBLα emphasizing var gene diversity in laboratory and field strains showed that no more
than 15–20% of amino acid sequences are conserved in
all variants [37]. In laboratory isolate 3D7, six var DBLα
sequences are diverse with 42–70% amino acid identity
[38]. Similarly, the study on genetic diversity of DBLα
region in P. falciparum var genes among Asia Pacific isolates revealed 46–50% amino acid identity within isolates
[39]. However, the conserved regions surrounding hypervariable regions within DBLα have been reported, which
is important in an aspect of conformation or folding for
adhesion. The conservation were found in cysteine residue at the position of 8–11 [39] and 16–18 [5,37]. Interestingly, the parasite rosetting phenotype of isolates from
Kilifi, Kenya was shown to be strongly associated with the
expression of group 2 PfEMP1-DBLα sequences [40]. The
transcription of var group A and B genes was more abundant in children with clinical malaria than those with
asymptomatic infections [41]. Recently, a simple nonphylogenetic network used to visualize the sharing of polymorphic blocks of sequence between large collections of
DBLα tags showed that 92% of 1,420 PfEMP1-DBLα
sequences from clinical isolates in Kilifi linked together
within a single giant component and another sub-group
contained sequences found to be associated with the
rosetting phonotype [42]. Additionally, the associations
between var gene expression and severity of malaria have
been reported in patients from French Guyana indicating
that severe cases are associated with specific msp1 allele
(B-K1) and specific DBLδ sequences [43], while the lack of
1–2 cysteine residues in PfEMP1-DBLα was associated
with severe non-cerebral malaria and rosetting in Brazil
[44]. Recently, when the var gene transcription in 93 fresh
P. falciparum trophozoite from Uganda children with
severe or uncomplicated malaria through var-specific
DBL1α-PCR amplification and sequencing was profiled, it
has been demonstrated by using a method for sub-sectioning region alignments into homology areas (MOTIFF)
that specific PfEMP1-DBL1α amino acid motifs correlated
with rosetting and severe malaria, with motif location corresponding to distinct regions of receptor interaction [45].
This study is aimed to demonstrate whether the highly
polymorphic PfEMP1-DBLα sequences occurring among
Thai isolates causing severe and uncomplicated malaria
are associated with their ability to form rosettes and reflect

the clinical outcome of the patients. The binding ability to
ICAM-1Ref, mutant ICAM-1Kilifi and ICAM-1S22/A and
CD36 among P. falciparum isolates were also evaluated.

Methods
Subjects
Seventy nine patients comprising of 49 and 30 patients
with severe and uncomplicated falciparum malaria,
respectively, admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University,
Bangkok, Thailand during the peak of malaria transmission from April 2005 to May 2006 were enrolled with
informed consent. The ethical issues of this study have
been approved by the Ethical Committee of Faculty of
Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. All patients were
positive for P. falciparum infection by microscopic examination of thin and thick blood smears stained with
Giemsa. Severe and uncomplicated malaria were defined
according to World Health Organization criteria [46].
Severe malaria was defined by the presence of asexual
forms of P. falciparum in the blood with one or more of
the following symptoms: cerebral malaria; hyperparasitaemia (> 200,000 parasites/μl); spontaneous bleeding
from gum, nose, gastrointestinal tract; repeated generalized convulsion; impaired consciousness; prostration;
inability to swallow or retain oral medication; hyperpyrexia; or clinical laboratory tests showing severe anaemia
(haematocrit < 15%, haemoglobin < 5 g/dl), renal failure
(serum creatinine > 265 μmol/l) or hypoglycaemia
(whole blood glucose < 2.2 mmol/l). Malaria patients
who lacked these abnormalities were considered as
uncomplicated malaria.
Cultivation of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocytic
stages
Three milliliters of fresh P. falciparum infected blood
obtained from patients at admission (day 0) before treatment were immediately cultivated in vitro as described
[47] in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco Life Technologies,
New York, USA) containing HEPES supplemented with
10% human serum from Thai donors, 2 mM L-glutamine,
2.5 μg/ml gentamicin and 25 mM sodium bicarbonate in
a gas mixture of 5% CO2, 1% O2 in N2. Parasite growth
was monitored daily by examination of Giemsa-stained
thin blood films until the culture reached the pigmented
trophozoite stages. At least 1,000 erythrocytes were
counted and the parasite stages were recorded and calculated as percent parasitaemia. Parasite adhesion assays,
rosette formation and RNA isolation were performed
when approximately 70% parasites were trophozoite
stages.
Parasite binding assays
The static protein-binding assays were performed as
described previously [48] using purified receptors: ICAM-

1Ref, ICAM-1Kilifi and ICAM-1S22/A and purified CD36
(R&D Systems, UK). Briefly, three sets of 50 μg/ml ICAM1 receptor and 10 μg/ml CD36 were spotted onto 35-mm
petri dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and incubated at
37°C for 2 hr in a humidified atmosphere. Dishes were
blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate
buffer saline (PBS) overnight at 4°C, washed with RPMI
1640 medium-HEPES and warmed at 37°C for 30 min.
The dishes were added with 1.25 ml of each individual P.
falciparum-infected RBC suspension, which has been
adjusted to 3% parasitaemia and 1% haematocrit for
binding assay. Assays were incubated at 37°C for 60 min
with gentle swirling every 15 min. Dishes were gently
washed with RPMI 1640 medium-HEPES until no nonadherent RBCs were visible by inverted microscopy. The
bound cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma, St
Louis, MO) in PBS for 20 min and stained with Giemsa
(Merck, Poole, UK). The numbers of bound parasitized
red blood cell (PRBC) per mm2 to each receptor were
counted under light microscope with oil immersion. The
assays were done in duplicate. The binding of more than
five PRBCs/mm2 was considered significant, as previously
described [9]. The P. falciparum laboratory lines, A4 and
ItG were used as controls.
Rosette formation
Rosette formation was performed using 100 μl of fresh
PRBC suspension mixed with 2 μl of 0.01% acridine
orange solution as previously described [10]. Ten microliters of the suspension were placed under a 22 × 22 mm
cover slip and examined under a fluorescence microscope.
Two or three hundred trophozoite stages were counted in
duplicate. A rosette was scored if 2 or more uninfected
RBC were bound to a single infected erythrocyte. The
rosette formation was calculated as the ratio of the numbers of rosette to the total number of parasitized red blood
cells.
RNA isolation, RT-PCR and PCR
Total RNA was extracted from malaria culture of 11 and 8
parasite isolates causing severe and uncomplicated
malaria, respectively, cultured at least 2 cycles or reaching
at least 5% parasitaemia as previously described [49].
RNA was then treated with RNAse free deoxyribonuclease
I (Ambion, UK) to degrade the contaminating genomic
DNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by
reverse transcribed RNA with cDNA synthesis kits (Bioline, UK) (RT-PCR) using random hexamers according to
the manufacturer. For each cDNA synthesis reaction, a
control reaction without reverse transcriptase was done
with identical amounts of template. 300–400 base pair
(bp) fragments of the PfEMP1-DBLα domains were
amplified using degenerate primers 2002αAF; 5'-GCA
CG(A/C) AGT TT(C/T)GC-3' and αBR; 5'-GCC CAT T(G/
C)T CGA ACC A-3' based on those designed previously

[50]. The PCR cycling conditions were started with a hot
start (93°C for 3 min) followed by 1 cycle of 93°C, 30 sec;
45°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 30 sec, then 29 cycles of 93°C, 30 sec;
45°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 30 sec and extension at 72°C, 10
min. The amplified products were run on 1% agarose gel
at 100 volts, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV-transilluminator. The 100 bp marker (Bioline,
UK) as standard marker and the DNA of A4 P. falciparum
strain and the mixture without DNA as positive and negative controls, were used. The expected PCR product at
roughly 400 bp was carefully cut from agarose gel and
purified using Millipore-Ultrafree®-DA (Millipore, UK).
DNA cloning and sequencing
The purified PCR products were cloned into pCR®2.1TOPO plasmid vectors and used to transform One Shot
TOP10 competent cells using TOPO TA Cloning® kit (Invitrogen, USA). The transformed cells were grown overnight and individual white colonies were selected for
culture. Plasmids were extracted from overnight cultures
using miniprep kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and were
sequenced using Beckman CEQ 8000 capillary sequencer
(Beckman Coulter, UK). The sequences used in this study
were submitted to Genbank (accession numbers:
FJ876523–FJ876817).
Cysteine and position of limited variability (Cys/PoLV)
sequence grouping
Sequences selected for analysis were all open reading
frames beginning at the position of the 59 consensus
motif DIGDI within homology block D and ending at the
position of the 39 consensus motif PQYLR within homology block H. The sequences were classified into one of six
sequence groups based on a count of the number of
cysteine residues within the tag region and a set of
sequence motifs at four positions of limited variability
(PoLV1–4). The position of limited variability1 (PoLV1)
motif was situated at the 3' end of homology block D. The
PoLV2 motif was situated at the 5' end of homology block
F. The PoLV1 and PoLV4 are fixed in relation to the 5' and
3' ends of the sequence, respectively. The PoLV2 and
PoLV3 are fixed in relation to a "WW" motif. Sequence
groups were classified as follows: group 1: MFK* motif at
PoLV1, 2 cysteines; group 2: *REY motif at PoLV2, 2
cysteines; group 3: 2 cysteines, not group 1 or 2; group 4:
4 cysteines, not group 5; group 5: *REY motif at PoLV2, 4
cysteines; group 6: presence of 1, 3, 5 or 6 cysteines. The
asterisk "*" denotes any amino acid. MFK* motifs at
PoLV1 and *REY motifs at PoLV2 are mutually exclusive
in tag sequences isolated worldwide [51].
Construction of PfEMP1-DBL networks
The PfEMP1-DBLα sequence networks were drawn and
visualized using the freely available software, Pajek [52].
By Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft) function, four blocks of

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/184

amino acids from specific windows of DBLα sequence
tags defined using three anchor points were extracted
from each PfEMP1-DBLα sequence tags designated as
position specific polymorphic block (PSPBs). Default
positions set for PSPBs were as follows: the 5' amino acid
of PSPB1 was set 15 amino acids from the 5' of the tag
region; the 3' end of PSPB2 was fixed 5 amino acid 5' to
the conserved central WW motif; the 5' end of PSPB3 was
fixed at 13 amino acid 3' to the central WW motif and the
3' end of PSPB4 was fixed 13 amino acid from the 5' end
of the tag region. The Active Perl program and the script
file were used to determine which sequences shared PSPBs
and imported into a network analysis package. Each
PfEMP1-DBLα sequence represented a vertex within the
network. An edge was formed between two vertices if they
shared one or more PSPB region. Visualization of the divisions of the sequences into cys/PoLV (positions of limited
variability) groups was achieved through formatting the
data as a Pajek partition file.
Data analyses
The rosette formation rate and the binding level of parasitized red blood cells from patients with severe and
uncomplicated malaria to ICAM-1 and CD36 were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. The Spearman's correlation test was used to determine the association of ICAM-1
and CD36 binding level. The nucleotide sequences of
PfEMP1-DBLα domains were aligned and translated to
amino acid using BioEdit computer program. The selected
nucleotide sequences containing "homology blocks" of
PfEMP1-DBLα [53] were analysed using the specific text
string analysis functions in Microsoft Excel and Perl program version 2 developed by Peter Bull [40].

Results
Among 79 P. falciparum isolates from patients, only 52
isolates (29 and 23 isolates causing severe and uncomplicated malaria, respectively) reached mature stage by primary culture sufficient for parasite binding assays. As
shown in Figure 1, 48% and 43% of isolates causing
severe (SM) malaria and uncomplicated malaria (UCM)
bound to wild type ICAM-1 (ICAM-1Ref), while the lesser
amount of isolates could bind to mutant ICAM-1 proteins
(ICAM-1Kilifi and ICAM-1S22/A) (ICAM-1Kilifi: 17% for SM
and 21% for UCM; ICAM-1S22/A: 21% for SM and 17% for
UCM). However, the binding levels of P. falciparum isolates in this study to both wild type and mutant ICAM-1
proteins were relatively low. The assays were validated by
using P. falciparum laboratory lines A4 and ItG as binding
controls [18] which bound to wild type and mutants
ICAM-1 and CD36. All isolates that bound to mutant
ICAM-1 proteins could bind to wild type ICAM-1 as well.
Among isolates that bound to ICAM-1, 40% of isolates
causing severe malaria showed major decreases in their
binding to both mutant ICAM-1 proteins when compared

The percent of isolates causing severe (SM) and uncomplicated (UCM) malaria bound to each receptor were shown,

SM and 43% for UCM; ICAM-1Kilifi: 17% for SM and 21% for

to their binding levels to ICAM-1Ref. However, 37% of isolates causing uncomplicated malaria showed no difference or minor decrease in their binding to ICAM-1Kilifi
while 80% showed a major decrease in their binding to
ICAM-1S22/A. The higher numbers of isolates causing both
severe (89%) and uncomplicated malaria (78%) could
bind to CD36. Likewise, 79% of isolates both causing
severe and uncomplicated malaria were able to form
rosettes. Higher numbers of PRBCs could bind to CD36
from isolates causing severe malaria (range = 7–293,
mean = 83 PRBC/mm2) when compared to those causing
uncomplicated malaria (range = 5–120, mean = 48 PRBC/
mm2), but no significant difference was found (p =
0.218). Lower numbers of PRBCs of isolates in both
groups of patients bound to ICAM-1Ref (p = 0.74), ICAM1Kilifi (p = 0.748) and ICAM-1S22/A (p = 0.90) with no significant differences. Similarly, most isolates causing
severe disease were able to form rosettes at a higher rate
than those causing uncomplicated malaria, but no significant difference was found (p = 0.51). Of all isolates
tested, 71%and 65% of isolates causing severe and
uncomplicated malaria, respectively could bind to more
than one receptor. However, when the binding levels to
ICAM-1Ref and CD36 were correlated, no significance was
observed either among isolates causing severe (r = 0.197,
p = 0.153) or among isolates causing uncomplicated
malaria (r = 0.309, p = 0.076).

Sequencing of the potential rosetting domain, PfEMP1DBLα was carried out in order to investigate the distribution of PfEMP1-DBLα features between isolates. A total of
295 PfEMP1-DBLα clones were successfully sequenced
from randomly selected isolates including 180 sequences
from 11 isolates causing severe malaria and 115
sequences from eight isolates causing uncomplicated
malaria (Genbank accession numbers: FJ876523–
FJ876817). Of these, 281 non-identical amino acid
sequences were identified (< 95% sequence identity).
When the PfEMP1-DBLα sequences were classified into
six sequence groups, designated as sequence group 1–6,
using specific sequence features based on a count of
number of cysteine residues within the tag region and a set
of sequence motifs at four positions of limited variability
(PoLV1–4) [40], a similar distribution of sequences in
each sequence group was seen between isolates causing
severe and uncomplicated malaria (Figure 2). When all six
sequence groups of isolates causing severe and uncomplicated malaria were compared using Chi-square, no significant difference was found. However, when individual
sequence group causing severe and uncomplicated
malaria were compared, only sequence group 1 was significantly different from sequence group 3 (p = 0.027). Interestingly, such sequence group 1 were from patients with
uncomplicated malaria, while the majority of isolates in
sequence group 3 were from patients with severe malaria.
The distribution of PoLV1–4 motifs among isolates using
a set of sequence motifs at four positions of PoLV1–4
whose positions within the sequence are fixed in relation
to four anchor points is shown (Figure 3). PoLV1 and
PoLV4 are fixed in relation to the 5' and 3' ends of the
sequence, respectively, while PoLV2 and PoLV3 are fixed
in relation to a "WW" motif. The majority of sequences in
the tested isolates contained PoLV1, PoLV2, PoLV3 and
PoLV4 motifs such as "LYLG", "LRED", "KAIT" and
"PTYF", respectively (Figure 3A). Likewise, there was a
close similarity between the distribution of PoLV1–4
motifs among PfEMP1-DBLα sequences of isolates causing severe and uncomplicated malaria. When the distinct
sequence identifiers (DSID) consisting of a string of
sequence features in the form of "PoLV1-PoLV2-PoLV3number of cysteines-PoLV4-sequence tag length" (Figure
3B) are taken into account, there were overall 272 DSIDs.
However, no significant difference was found when the
number of distinct sequences in isolates causing severe
malaria were compared to those causing uncomplicated
malaria (p = 0.967).
In order to determine the variation of PfEMP1-DBLα
sequences in relation to their ability to form rosette, four
levels of rosetting rates were defined as non-rosetting
(0%), low rosetting rate (1–19%), moderate rosetting rate
(20–39%) and high rosetting rate (> 40%). The distribution of PfEMP1-DBLα in six sequence groups showed significant associations with rosetting levels (p = 0.028). To

understand the relationship between 295 PfEMP1-DBLα
sequences from Thai clinical isolates, a simple non-phylogenetic approach to visualize the sharing of polymorphic
blocks (position specific polymorphic block; PSPB) of
sequences was employed. The PSPBs networks are represented by nodes (vertices) that are joined by lines if they
are identical at one or more their constituent PSPBs [42].
However, as shown in Figure 4A, the PSPBs networks
could not differentiate severe from uncomplicated
malaria. Few unbroken networks of PfEMP1-DBLα
sequences were seen. The network was constructed as
shown in Figure 4B based on the six sequence groups classified by PoLV1–4 and together with the numbers of
cysteine residues within the PfEMP1-DBLα sequences.
The main component of the PSPBs network consists of the
sequence groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 while sequence group 1
was splitting with no connection. Almost all PfEMP1DBLα sequences in group 1 were from uncomplicated
malaria and gave low rosetting rates (mean = 3.6%). In
contrast, the isolates belonging to sequence group 5 gave
the highest mean rosetting rate (21.3%) and in sequence
groups 2 and 6, the isolates causing severe malaria had significantly higher rosetting rates than those causing
uncomplicated malaria (p = 0.014, p = 0.007, respectively).

Discussion
Plasmodium falciparum isolates show different abilities to
form rosettes and binding to CD36 and ICAM-1 which
may contribute to different clinical severity of malaria
[1,2]. In this study isolates from both severe and uncomplicated malaria in Thailand could bind to CD36 while
only 45% could bind to wild type ICAM-1 and at lower
levels than to CD36. This is similar to a previous study
that almost all P. falciparum isolates from Thai patients
could bind to CD36 while only a few isolates (13%) could
bind to ICAM-1 [54]. Furthermore, CD36 binding was
identical in parasites from cerebral malaria patients and
community controls (selecting on the basis of those who
had P. falciparum parasitaemia), but slightly elevated in
non severe cases in Kilifi [8]. It has been reported that the
ability to bind to ICAM-1 showed widely different avidities in clinical isolates [8]. In this study, a lower percentage of isolates could bind to ICAM-1 while at least 80% of
isolates from Kenyan patients could [8,55] indicating that
the in vitro binding ability to ICAM-1 among the isolates
from different geographical endemic areas seems to be
variable.
It has been reported that rosette formation was associated
with severity of malaria [24] such as severe anaemia
[8,9,55] and cerebral malaria in children [10,25]. However, 79% of isolates causing both severe and uncomplicated malaria in our study could form rosettes at a similar

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/184

rate. In general, rosetting seems to increase microvascular
obstruction of the blood flow [56] and may hide the
infected cell thereby protecting it from phagocytosis, one
of the main mechanisms of anti-parasitic immunity [57].
Therefore, it could be concluded at this point that cytoadherence to receptors expressed on endothelial cells resulting the focal accumulation of parasitesat high densities
leading to microvascular obstruction would restrict the
exchange of glucose and oxygen at the capillary level
which together with hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, high
grade of fever and high TNF level might lead to representing the mechanism of disease [58].
Since PfEMP1-DBLα is the rosetting domain, the
sequence was further investigated to see whether there was
any association with their rosetting rates. PfEMP1-DBLα
domains from both severe and uncomplicated malaria are
highly variable in length and amino acid sequences. The
distributions of the position of limited variability
(PoLV1–4) and sequence groups among isolates causing
severe and uncomplicated malaria were similar, indicating that PfEMP1-DBLα shared common sequence among
different clinical categories. When the sequence networks
were further constructed based on the position specific
polymorphic block, PSPB and cys/PoLV, the results
showed that the main component of PSPBs network consisted of almost all sequence groups which supports the
common sequence phenomenon. However, sequence
group 1 was split from the main component indicating
different sequences from the other five groups. It is possible that the different sequences in group 1 may be associated with less severe malaria since the isolates originated
from patients with uncomplicated malaria and had low
rosetting rates. The majority of isolates from severe
malaria with the highest rosetting rates belonged to
sequence group 5. Additionally, there was an association
between sequence group 2 and rosette formation of isolates with high rosette rates from severe malaria cases, but
not with low rosette rates and uncomplicated malaria.
This is in accordance with the study in Kilifi children demonstrating that sequence group 2 expression is positively
associated with the percentage of infected red blood cells
that formed rosettes [40]. However, the results were different from those demonstrated in African isolates where
rosette frequency of isolates from adults in Mali was significantly correlated with group 1 genes, but not with any
other group and two cysteine residues sequences, which
were more frequent among isolates from children with
cerebral malaria than those with hyperparasitaemia [59].
It seems to be that the networks in our study were different from the Kilifi network in that few unbroken networks
were seen in the Kilifi network with two apparent major
lobes, one small and the other large [42]. This might be
possibly due to the different sample sizes used in these

Sequence groups of PfEMP1-DBLα domains from isolates causing severe and uncomplicated malaria. (A) Distribution of DBLα sequences of isolates causing severe (black dot) and uncomplicated (white dot) malaria in six sequence groups.
DBLα sequences were divided into six sequence groups: sequence groups 1–3 contain two cysteine residues (cys2) and
sequence groups 4 and 5 contain four cysteine residues (cys4). Sequence group 6 contains one, three, five, or six cysteines
(cysX). Sequence groups 2 and 5 contain PoLV2*REY. Sequence group 1 contains PoLV1MFK*. The length of each distinct DBLα
sequence within each sequence group is indicated; (B) The percent of isolates causing severe (black bar) and uncomplicated
malaria (white bar) bound to each receptor.
