Abstract
Background: Management strategies for coral reefs are dependant on information about the spatial
population structure and connectivity of reef organisms. Genetic tools can reveal important information
about population structure, however, this information is lacking for many reef species. We used a
mitochondrial molecular marker to examine the population genetic structure and the potential for metapopulation dynamics in a direct developing coral reef fish using 283 individuals from 15 reefs on the Great
Barrier Reef, Australia. We employed a hierarchical sampling design to test genetic models of population
structure at multiple geographical scales including among regions, among shelf position and reefs within
regions. Predictions from island, isolation-by-distance and meta-population models, including the potential
for asymmetric migration, local extinction and patterns of re-colonisation were examined.
Results: Acanthochromis polyacanthus displayed strong genetic structure among regions (ΦST = 0.81, P <
0.0001) that supported an equilibrium isolation-by-distance model (r = 0.77, P = 0.001). Significant
structuring across the continental shelf was only evident in the northern region (ΦST = 0.31, P < 0.001)
and no evidence of isolation-by-distance was found within any region. Pairwise ΦST values indicated overall
strong but variable genetic structure (mean ΦST among reefs within regions = 0.28, 0.38, 0.41), and
asymmetric migration rates among reefs with low genetic structure. Genetic differentiation among
younger reefs was greater than among older reefs supporting a meta-population propagule-pool
colonisation model. Variation in genetic diversities, demographic expansion and population growth
estimates indicated more frequent genetic bottlenecks/founder effects and subsequent population
expansion in the central and southern regions compared to the northern one.
Conclusion: Our findings provide genetic evidence for meta-population dynamics in a direct developing
coral reef fish and we reject the equilibrium island and isolation-by distance models at local spatial scales.
Instead, strong non-equilibrium genetic structure appears to be generated by genetic bottlenecks/founder
effects associated with population reductions/extinctions and asymmetric migration/(re)-colonisation of
such populations. These meta-population dynamics varied across the geographical range examined with
edge populations exhibiting lower genetic diversities and higher rates of population expansion than more
central populations. Therefore, coral reef species may experience local population reductions/extinctions
that promote overall meta-population genetic differentiation.

Background
Coral reefs are important ecosystems in ecological, evolutionary and socio-economic contexts but are under
increasing threat from anthropogenic impacts [1,2]. The
most effective conservation tool available to coral reef
managers so far has been the use of individual or networks of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) [2,3]. To maximise the effectiveness of MPAs information about the
spatial population structure, patterns of connectivity and
the stability of local populations within and among protected areas is required [3,4]. Genetic tools can provide
valuable information about the scale, structure and stability of populations [5] when direct census estimates
required to empirically demonstrating these processes are
impractical to obtain [6,7]. The development and application of molecular markers to examine patterns of connectivity in coral reef organisms have increased greatly in
recent years [5], but comparatively little attention has
been placed on examining predictions from meta-population theory [8] despite the intuitive appeal of this
approach in describing such systems. Here we present
only the second examination of genetic meta-population
dynamics in a coral reef fish in more than a decade and
the first to use a highly variable and drift-sensitive molecular marker.
Genetic models of spatial structure have developed from
Wright's original island model [9] into the stepping-stone,
or isolation-by-distance models [10-13], and later into
meta-population models [e.g. [14-19]]. The island model
has played a central role in the development of population ecological and evolutionary theory because of its
mathematical simplicity and tractability, but it makes
many assumptions including equal population sizes,
equal migration rates, discrete generation times, amongst
others [20]. When these assumptions are met, populations should display similar genetic diversities, levels of
sub-division and demographic histories [20]. The isolation-by-distance model relaxes these assumptions somewhat by allowing migration rates to be higher among
populations in close proximity compared to more distant
ones [20]. Both the island and isolation-by-distance models assume drift-migration equilibrium, which may not be
met when migration rates are low and/or genetic bottlenecks are frequent [8].
In contrast to these island-based models, meta-population theory attempts to understand systems of evolutionarily ephemeral, genetically subdivided populations that
persist through time via colonisation and migration from
source populations [21-23]. Such populations are connected by migration rates that are high enough to rescue
local populations from extinction, but low enough for
genetic drift to generate measurable genetic differences
among populations [22]. Meta-population dynamics can

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/248

therefore be distinguished from island dynamics by low,
variable levels of migration among populations. While
earlier models assumed that migration was infrequent,
and only re-colonised patches in which populations had
gone extinct [14,15], it is becoming evident that migration
rates may be asymmetrical [24] and can vary temporally
[e.g. [25,26]], spatially [e.g. [27-29]] and behaviourally
among individuals [e.g. [30-32]]. In turn, such variation
in migration rates may generate a diversity of genetic signatures depending on the relative importance of each
process [24]. A comparison of traditional (based on the
island model) and coalescence-based analytical
approaches that can separate overall genetic differentiation into reciprocal migration rates [33,34] should be able
to illuminate the roles of migration and drift in establishing patterns of genetic differentiation among populations
[8].
Theory suggests that the sources and rates of colonisation
relative to subsequent migration are critical determinants
of the evolution of the genetic structure of meta-populations [18,19,23]. In a meta-population with low levels of
migration, the meta-population propagule-pool model
predicts high genetic differentiation among populations if
empty patches are colonised by individuals from a single
source [18,19]. This high genetic differentiation results
from genetic bottlenecks arising from founder effects of a
few, genetically similar individuals. In contrast, under the
meta-population migrant-pool model, low genetic differentiation among populations should result if extinct
patches are colonised by many migrants from a larger
number of source populations [18,19]. Because the colonisers are numerous and harbour greater genetic diversity,
the re-colonised population will not experience a bottleneck, and because the genetic diversity is sampled from a
range of sources, differentiation among populations will
be decreased under this model. Under the propagule-pool
model, populations will always display greater genetic differentiation than under an island model because of
genetic bottlenecks associated with low and asymmetric
colonisation rates. In contrast, greater genetic differentiation among populations will only occur under the
migrant-pool meta-population compared to an island
model if rates of colonisation and migration rates are low
[18,19]. Consequently, meta-population dynamics can be
distinguished from island dynamics by a strong but variable level of genetic structure among populations. Separating the effects of colonisation pattern and subsequent
migration in meta-populations, however, is often difficult
because the relative effects of colonisation and migration
cannot be estimated from a single estimate of genetic differentiation [35]. If the propagule-pool model is operating, and if migration rates are low, then populations with
younger coalescent histories should display greater
genetic structure among each other compared to that

found among older ones [35,23]. Therefore, it should be
possible to distinguish different types of meta-population
dynamics among genetically structured populations by
patterns of genetic differentiation observed among populations that have experienced more recent population bottlenecks compared to those with older ones [36-40].
The effects of these meta-population dynamics on spatial
genetic structure have typically been estimated in terms of
genetic differentiation among populations, but may also
be evident in patterns of genetic diversity and demographic history of local populations [23,40,41]. As such,
important information about the role of local extinctions
in a meta-population, and its importance in determining
the geographic range of species, may be gained by examining patterns of genetic diversity and demographic history in sets of local populations [8,42,43]. In general,
meta-population dynamics should reduce genetic diversity at the level of the meta-population and genetic diversity within the sub-populations compared to a panmictic
population of equal size to the meta-population [40]. The
relative magnitude of this difference, however, may vary
greatly depending on the frequency and intensity of effective population size reductions among the sub-populations, and the mode of subsequent re-colonization and
migration [[40] and references therein]. For example,
reductions in genetic diversities may be large where reductions in the effective size of sub-populations are frequent
and large, and if re-colonisation obeys a propagule-pool
model. Coalescence times within sub-populations are
also reduced under this scenario because of genetic bottlenecks associated with propagule-pool colonisation [40]. If
sub-populations experience minor fluctuations in population size, or if colonisation obeys a migrant-pool model,
where colonisers originate from a range of populations,
sub-populations may not experience genetic bottlenecks
and genetic diversities may not be affected to a measurable extent [23,40,41].
Fishes on coral reefs occupy a naturally fragmented environment where patches of suitable reef habitat are surrounded by unsuitable habitat such as open sand and
deep water making them amenable to analysis under a
meta-population framework. At present, however, we
know little about the presence, spatial extent and genetic
consequences of meta-populations dynamics in marine
systems [[8], but see [44]]. Species with short, or nonexistent larval durations generally display considerable
genetic structure across small spatial scales [45-48] and
have, therefore, the potential for genetic meta-population
dynamics. Coral reef fishes generally display large effective population sizes [49] and many marine fishes are
characterised by relatively shallow population genetic
structures reflecting genetic bottlenecks associated with
Pleistocene climate variation [reviewed by [50,51]].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/248

Genetic bottlenecks following post-Pleistocene extinctions of local populations have previously been regarded
as unimportant in the population dynamics of coral reef
fishes [44,52]. Recent studies, however, have uncovered a
diversity of coalescent signatures operating at a range of
temporal scales [e.g. [53-58]] suggesting an important
role of demographic bottlenecks and local extinctions in
the evolutionary ecology of coral reef fishes.
Acanthochromis polyacanthus is a common fish on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and lacks a dispersive larval phase. This life-history trait, coupled with the physical
history of the GBR, and the sensitivity of mitochondrial
molecular markers to drift, provides an opportunity to
evaluate the potential importance of meta-population
dynamics to the evolution of genetic structure on small
spatial scales in a natural marine system. Previous investigations of A. polyacanthus, as well as the presence of several
colour morphs on the GBR, suggest that sufficient time
has elapsed since colonisation of the GBR began by this
species for it to have evolved genetic differences among
populations separated by small geographic distances
[46,57,59,60]. Here we examine if and how the genetic
structure of this species varies at two spatial scales (i.e.
within and among regions). Using conventional genetic
estimates of fixation, we test whether the genetic structure
of this species is best described by equilibrium-island, or
isolation-by-distance models. Next, we examine the evidence for meta-population dynamics in A. polyacanthus by
evaluating spatial differences in migration rates and conformation to predictions from the propagule and migrantpool re-colonisation models. Finally, we evaluate the role
of extinction by comparing patterns of genetic diversity
and demographic history among reefs and regions.

Results
Genetic diversities among regions and reefs
A region of 356 bases of the mtDNA control region I was
obtained from a total of 283 individuals collected from 15
reefs in three regions (Figure 1). The average base frequencies were AT biased (A = 0.41, T = 0.40, C = 0.07, G = 0.12)
as commonly observed in fish mtDNA [61,62]. The ts/tv
ratio was 1.53:1 for all samples combined. Haplotype
diversities were very high when summed over all populations (total ± SD = 0.97 ± 0.0003) and did not differ significantly among regions (Kruskal – Wallis = 0.187, df =
2, p = 0.91). Each region contained one or two reefs with
significantly lower haplotype diversities than the rest (i.e.,
North = YON, Central = TRU, south = OTI and SYK, Table
1). Nucleotide diversities were high overall (total ± SD =
0.066 ± 0.37), and varied significantly among regions
(Kruskal – Wallis Test = 10.64, df = 2, p = 0.005). Reefs in
the northern region displayed the highest and most variable nucleotide diversities, whereas, nucleotide diversities

Spatial population genetic structure among regions and
reefs
Strong and significant genetic structure was detected
among regions by analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA) (ΦST = 0.81, p < 0.0001, Table 2a). Significant
structure was attributable to shelf position in the northern
(ΦST = 0.31, p < 0.001, Table 2b), but not in the central
region (Table 2c). Results of the isolation-by-distance
analyses were largely congruent with these results and significant correlation between geographical and genetic distances was only evident among regions (ΦST vs. km: r =
0.77 p = 0.001; Figure 2). This correlation remained statis-

tically significant when the number of reefs were reduced
to six (two from each of the three regions) to make the
number of comparisons similar to those used within
regions (ΦST vs. km: r = 0.91 p = 0.02; unpublished data).
In contrast, genetic and geographic distances were not correlated within regions (P > 0.05 in all cases, unpublished
data).
Pairwise ΦST estimates were significantly greater than 0 in
more than 97% of all pairwise comparisons. Levels of
genetic differentiation differed among reefs but the range
of differentiation among reefs was similar within each of
the three regions (Kruskal – Wallis Test = 1.21 df = 2, p =
0.55, Figure 3a – c, see Additional file 1). There was substantial variation in migration rates among reef samples

and regions (Figure 3d – f). Migration rates were generally
low (4Nem mostly < 1) and the frequency of significantly
different reciprocal rates was higher in the southern region
(i.e. 4Nem (x to y) vs. 4Nem (y to x): north = 23%, central
= 20% and southern = 42%) (Figure 3d – f). All regions
were characterised by one or two migration rates being
significantly higher (4Nem ~ 4) than all other estimates.
The level of fixation was greater between reef samples with
more recent population expansions compared to the level
of fixation among reef samples with older population

expansions providing tentative support for the meta-population propagule-pool model of re-colonisation (Table
3).
Historical population demography among regions and
reefs
Log-likelihood ratio tests indicated that the fit of the sudden expansion and constant population size models
could be distinguished in 11 of the 18 comparisons (with
near significance in one further reef sample) (Table 4).

were largely supported by Fu's Fs and R2 neutrality tests
with the southern region displaying significant departures
from neutrality in both indices indicating population
expansion, the central region displaying some indication
of population expansion when based on the Fs (although
not significant after multiple test correction) but not using
the R2 index and the northern region displaying non-significant values in both indices (Table 5).
Three types of mismatch distributions could be distinguished (Figure 4). Five reef samples in the northern
region (DAY, NDR, LIZ, LIN, MAR) were characterised by
bimodal mismatch distributions (Figure 4) indicating the
presence of two genetically divergent lineages (see Additional data file 2). As a consequence these populations
displayed greater mismatch means and support for the
constant population model was found in LIN (Table 4).
Three reef samples (TRU, OTI, SYK) were characterised by
narrow left skewed uni-modal mismatch distributions
and low mismatch means and support for population
expansion was obtained for two of these reefs (Figure 4,
Table 4). The remaining populations (n = 7) displayed
broader uni-modal mismatch distributions with larger
mismatch means (Figure 4). Support for the expansion
model was found in three central reefs (PIT, BRI, ORP);
the constant population model was supported in three
reefs (MYR, POL, BRO and near significant in YON)

(Table 4). The age of population expansion (τ) followed a
similar pattern to that of the mismatch means and error
estimates from most reefs in all three regions overlapped
to a great extent (Figure 5a). Greater values with large variances were observed in two northern reefs (NDR and
LIN), lower and less variable estimates were found in one
central location (TRU) and in two southern locations
(OTI and SYK) (Figure 5a). The age of population expansion (τ) could not be distinguished from 0 in four locations: TRU and ORP in the central region and OTI and SYK
in the southern region and the neutrality indices indicated
population expansion in one of these (TRU) (Table 4 and
5). Population expansion rates varied significantly among
reef samples (Figure 5b). All northern locations displayed
negative growth rates close to 0. Reefs in the central region
showed both positive and negative growth rates that were
all close to 0 except TRU that displayed a highly positive
value. The high mean regional growth rate in the southern
region was contributed to by the high growth rates of
three of the four southern reefs. The growth rates of these
three reefs were greater than all other reefs analysed except
one (TRU in the central region) (Figure 5b).

tions of A. polyacanthus on the GBR. This result is consistent with previous findings of strong allozyme structure
between northern region bi-coloured and southern region
black morphs of this species [59,60] and indicates the
presence of further strong structuring among bi-coloured
morphs between northern and central regions. This pattern of genetic structure is consistent with large-scale water
circulation patterns on the GBR, which are characterised
by an offshore outer shelf bifurcation of the South Equatorial Current into a northern flowing Hiri and a southern
flowing East Australian Currents around 16°S latitude
[63,64] positioned between the Northern and Central
regions examined here. At smaller spatial scales this
inflow generates complex continental shelf current patterns modulated by winds, tides and local reef matrix densities [65]. Such cross-shelf currents differ among regions
and are predominantly weaker and flow in an onshore
direction in the northern region, are stronger and flow in
an offshore direction in the central and southern regions
of the GBR [65]. The genetic structure of A. polyacanthus
was consistent with these cross shelf current patterns.
Continental shelf effects were detected in the northern but
not in the central region and a higher abundance of individuals in a second divergent lineage was found on more
inshore northern reefs (Figure 4). Our analyses also indicate that the spatial structure among regions is best

described by an isolation-by-distance model of dispersal
in which genetic exchange is more likely among neighbouring locations than more distant ones (Figure 2).
While patterns of isolation-by-distance have been
reported at large spatial scales in marine organisms [e.g.
[66,67]], our study reports one of very few examples of
such dynamics at smaller spatial scales in a coral reef fish
[see also [44,68]] and suggests that a migration-drift equilibrium may be met at this spatial scale [8,69].
Genetic structure within regions
Strong genetic structure was evident within all three
regions and was attributable to continental shelf position
in the northern region (Table 2b), however, no evidence
of isolation-by-distance was found within any of the
regions. These results are consistent with a departure from
migration-drift equilibrium and a greater importance of
genetic drift over migration in structuring this species at
smaller spatial scales [8]. It is possible, however, that
reduced statistical power resulting from fewer reefs being
compared within regions than between prevented the
detection of isolation-by-distance within regions where it
existed. A reduction in the number of reefs compared
among regions to the number of reefs compared within
regions detected a significant correlation between genetic
and geographical distance. Although larger sample sizes
within regions will be required to resolve this issue fully,
this result indicates that our tests were powerful enough to
detect isolation-by-distance even when fewer comparisons were included. Genetic differentiation among reefs
within regions was comparable (Figure 3a – c) and generally very high. For example, Lizard Island (LIZ) and North
Direction Island (NDR) are separated by less than 10 km
but have a ΦST value of 0.26 and Martin Reef (MAR) and
Linnet Reef (LIN) are separated by less than 6 km and
have a ΦST value of 0.33. Such differentiation is among the
highest recorded for any coral reef fish at such small spatial scales [e.g. [58,70,71]] and is, despite obvious difficulties in comparing differentiation based on different
molecular markers and taxa, comparable to values
obtained for many direct-developing coral reef organisms
at similar spatial scales [45,47,48,57,72-75]. This finding
suggests that the spatial patterns described by this study
may be broadly applicable to many direct developing
coral reef species.
Asymmetric migration and re-colonisation of reefs within
regions
Despite the strong genetic structure of A. polyacanthus
among reefs, our analyses indicated that migration rates
were substantial and asymmetric in between 20 – 40% of
comparisons. These patterns indicate a departure from the
island model (which assumes equal migration rates
among all populations) and add to a growing number of
examples documenting asymmetric migration rates using

genetic evidence [e.g. [32]]. Variation in migration rates
may affect the dynamics of meta-populations and spatial
structure of species in several ways [22,26]. If habitat
patches differ in quality and local populations differ in
size, migration from larger source populations into
smaller sink populations may facilitate their long-term
persistence by rescuing them from extinction [24,26,27].
If such dynamics are spatially and temporally persistent
they should be identifiable by low genetic differentiation,
and high and mostly uni-directional migration from
sources to sinks. The strength of genetic differentiation
was largely congruent with the Bayesian estimates of
migration (Figure 3) and insignificant or small pairwise
ΦST values were often (e.g. DAY – LIZ; BRI – PIT; NDR –
MAR; OTI – POL; SYK – POL) but not always (e.g. NDR –
LIN) associated with asymmetric migration rates. The
direction of migration however, did not identify any obvious sources or sinks in A. polyacanthus since most potential sinks (reefs that received a higher number of
immigrants) also produced substantial numbers of emigrants as expected for potential source reefs (e.g. LIZ, TRU,
POL, OTI: Figure 3d – f). The patterns uncovered here may

indicate that migration at local scales is a stochastic process, although further sampling would be required to fully
determine this. A second process by which asymmetric
migration can affect the spatial structure of a meta-population is through the re-colonisation of extinct patches
[18,19,35]. Asymmetric colonisation events from a single
patch such as those observed among some reefs here (e.g.
MYR to TRU; POL to OTI) could result in more genetic
structure among more recently (re)-colonised patches
through the effect of genetic drift associated with such
founder effects, but then erase this structure over time as
more migrants are received (propagule-pool model). The
strength of fixation (ΦST) was greater between younger,
more recently expanded populations compared to that
found between reefs that expanded longer ago providing
support for the colonisation model (Table 3). This study
therefore adds to only a handful of investigations that
have explored, and largely supported, the predictions
from such meta-population colonisation models
[reviewed by [35]]. This conclusion, however, is based on
coalescence estimates with considerable variation and a
small number of comparisons, and should, therefore, be
interpreted with caution. It does imply, however, that
population size reductions/extinctions and genetic bottlenecks/founder effects associated with re-colonisation of
such reefs have the potential to increase the level of
genetic structure in this meta-population, at least over relatively short evolutionary time scales.
Genetic diversities and historical population demography
Genetic diversities recorded here were generally high and
comparable with those reported for other coral reef fishes
using the same mitochondrial marker [e.g. [51,71] but see
[76]] supporting the general observation of high genetic
diversity in many coral reef fish species [50]. Intra-specific
variation in genetic diversities in A. polyacanthus was substantial both among reefs and regions and greater than
those previously reported among reef fish populations
separated by more than 17000 km [68], or taxonomically
distinct species from different environments [51]. Our
analyses also indicated consistent and substantial variation in historical population growth patterns of A. polyacanthus among reefs and regions on the GBR (Table 1, 4,
5, Figure 4 and 5). The central and southern regions, and
many (although not all) reefs within them, were characterised by population expansion indicated by mismatch
analysis and neutrality indices. In particular, the southern
region, located close to the species' southern border, was
characterised by lower mitochondrial genetic diversity
and population expansion rates 6 – 19 times greater than
the central and northern regions. These lower genetic
diversities and higher population expansion rates could
be the result of either demographic or spatial range expansions. Spatial range expansion is particularly worth considering given the proximity of the sampled reefs in the

Page 11 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:248

southern region to the geographical range limit of A. polyacanthus. The genetic signatures of demographic and range
expansion models can be very similar [77] particularly
when migration rates among sub-populations are high
[78,79]. When migration rates are low, spatially expanding populations may display multi-modal mismatch distributions, similar to those expected under constant
population size models [78]. While it is possible that both
the central and southern regions represent a spatial range
expansion of this species in a north to south direction
along the GBR, we consider this unlikely for two reasons.
First, the distribution of colour morphs and lineages
within colour morphs were confined to regions. If northto-south range expansion were occurring in this species,
we would have expected colonisation of both northern
lineages in the central region and colonisation of black
and white lineages in the southern region. This was not
the case (see Additional file 2). Second, we did not sample
any multi-modal mismatch distributions in the central
and southern regions as expected in spatially expanding
species with relatively low migration rates (Figure 4). The
demographic expansion model therefore appears a more
parsimonious explanation for our results, although further sampling in the southern region would be required
before these hypotheses can be definitively distinguished.
In all, this suggests that genetic bottlenecks and founder
effects arising through colonisation of new or extinct subpopulations may affect the meta-population dynamics
towards the edges of a species' geographic range to a
greater extent than within more centrally located regions
[42,43].
There were substantial differences in the mismatch distributions and population growth rates among reefs within
regions (Figure 4, 5, Table 4). Most reefs had comparably
high genetic diversities (Table 1), low population expansion rates, and times that were significantly different from
0 (Figure 5). This provides evidence for constant population size and was further supported by mismatch analysis
for four of these reefs (YON, MYR, BRO, POL). Three reefs
Trunk (TRU), One Tree Island (OTI) and Sykes Reef (SYK)
were characterised by low genetic diversities (Table 1),
uni-modal, left-skewed mismatch distributions (Figure
4), high population growth rates and expansion times
that could not be distinguished from 0 (Figure 5) all consistent with population expansion. Mismatch analysis
indicated population expansion in a further three reefs
(BRI, ORP, PIT) from the central region. In concert, these
results provide evidence for recent population bottlenecks
and/or local extinctions on these reefs. Four reefs in the
northern region (NDR, LIZ, LIN, MAR) had very high
nucleotide diversities and bimodal mismatch distributions that were most likely the result of constant population sizes (as indicated by mismatch analysis for LIN,
Table 4) and the presence of approximately equal num-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/248

bers of individuals from two differentiated lineages at
these locations (Figure 4, Additional file 2). The presence
and maintenance of two or more divergent lineages across
relatively small spatial scales is emerging as a feature of
many coral reef organisms [51,80-82]. The dynamic history of coral reefs associated with sea-level fluctuations
from the mid Miocene to the end of the Pleistocene has
been implicated as the major evolutionary force promoting divergence and subsequent coalescence in species with
high dispersal potential [e.g. [51,76,82]]. Because of the
limited dispersal potential of A. polyacanthus, deep genetic
divergences may evolve among locations in the absence of
sea-level fluctuations and significant genetic structure has
previously been found between GBR, Coral Sea and Melanesian populations of this species [[57,60], Additional file
2]. It is therefore likely that colonisation events from these
locations may be the source of the second lineage prominent on the inshore northern reefs highlighting the potential for long distance dispersal in this brooding species.
The absence of this second lineage from several northern,
all central and southern reefs, however, indicates that this
is likely to be a rare and/or recent event.

Conclusion
The population genetic structure of A. polyacanthus on the
GBR contained significant variation consistent with an
equilibrium isolation-by-distance model at larger spatial
scales and a non-equilibrium meta-population dynamics
model at smaller ones. Meta-population dynamics were
evident at smaller spatial scales indicated by the high levels of population structure (consistent with propagulepool re-colonisation), asymmetric migration rates, variation in genetic diversities and historical demography
parameters. The maintenance of strong genetic structure
despite considerable migration rates and a signature of
population expansion in many reef samples indicate that
local population size fluctuations and extinctions may
play an important role in generating genetic structure in
this coral reef fish. While meta-population models provide an intuitive framework to describe the dynamics of
fragmented eco-systems and were supported by genetic
evidence in the direct developing species examined here,
the general application of this model to other coral reef
organisms remains unclear. The brooding habit of A. polyacanthus is unusual, however, examples of strong natal
homing and significant genetic structure at local scales are
increasingly being documented in more typical, coral reef
fishes with larval dispersal [e.g. [5,83]]. Furthermore, the
diversity of demographic histories displayed by coral reef
fishes, including the results presented here, indicates substantial potential for non-equilibrium population genetic
dynamics that may vary across the species' geographical
range. Future population genetic studies of coral reef
organisms should therefore incorporate local and
regional sampling regimes of species with different life

histories. Doing so will further enhance our understanding of the role of meta-population dynamics and local
population fluctuations in the ecology and evolution of
coral reef associated species.

Labelled extension products were sequenced on a Megabase 1000 (Amersham Biosciences). Representative
sequences have been deposited in a public database [GenBank: DQ199666 – DQ199947].

Methods

Data analysis
The control region sequences were aligned and edited
using Sequencher 4.2 (GeneCodes Corp. Michigan USA)
and ESEE [87]. The best model of nucleotide substitution
was determined using Modeltest 3.5 [88] and PAUP*
4.0b10 [89]. The hierarchical likelihood tests and Akaike
Information Criteria agreed that the Tamura and Nei
model [90] with γ = 0.3012 fitted the data best (-LogLikelihood = 1220.65; AIC = 2453.30). This model and rate
heterogeneity estimate was used in all following analyses
of population genetic structure. Base frequencies and the
ts/tv ratio from all sampled fish combined were calculated
using Modeltest. The role of saturation was explored by
comparing the topology of neighbour joining trees
(implemented in PAUP*) including and excluding transitions. All individuals retained membership in the same
major clades and transitions were included in all further
analyses.

Study species and sampling locations
A. polyacanthus were collected from 15 back-reefs from 3
regions on the Great Barrier Reef during 2003 and 2004
(Table 1, Figure 1). This species is very common and show
not apparent variation in abundance on reefs either along
or across the GBR [84,85]. The geographic distribution of
this species extends from 15°N to 26°S http://www.fish
base.org and the southern region sampled here was therefore near the southern limit of this species. A. polyacanthus
is polymorphic with a southern black morph, and a black
and white morph in the central and northern regions of
the reef. Fish were captured using small hand spears or
baited fence nets and hand nets and were transported
either alive or on ice to the nearest shore where genetic
samples (fin clips) were taken and preserved in 80%
EtOH. Genetic effects of continental shelf position, inner,
middle and outer, were examined among replicate reefs in
two regions (i.e. north and central). Because the southern
region contains no true inner- and mid-shelf zones, the
genetic structure in this region was explored using pairwise genetic distances
DNA extraction and amplification
Genomic DNA was extracted from approx 0.25 cm2 of fin
tissue (re-hydrated by several TE washes) using a modified
CTAB extraction procedure [[86], excluding the phenolchloroform step] and re-suspended in 50 μl of TE. Concentrated DNA stock was diluted 1:50 yielding a final
DNA concentration of approximately 50 ng/μL. A 400
base-pair region of the mitochondrial control region
(hyper variable region I, HVR I) was amplified using the
specific forward primer (dLoopF 5'-CATATATGTRTTATCAACATTA-3') and the universal primers CR-E H16498
(5'-CCTGAAGTAGGAACCAGATG-3') [71]. PCR reactions
were carried out on a PE Applied Biosystems 9700 in 25
μl containing 1× PCR Buffer (Promega), 3.5 mM MgCl2,
200 μM each dNTP, 0.4 μM each primer, 10 ng template
DNA and 0.1 unit of Taq Polymerase (Promega). Amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
conducted with a cycling profile of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at
48°C and 60 s at 72°C for 30 cycles. The cycling profile
was flanked by an initial 2 min denaturing step (94°C)
and a 10 min terminal extension phase (72°C). PCR
products were cleaned up using PCR clean up columns
(Qiagen) and re-suspended in 20 μL of ddH2O. Two μL of
the purified product was sequenced in the forward and
reverse direction using a dyenamic ET dye terminator kit
(Megabase) chemistry (Amersham Biosciences). Sequence
products were purified using Sephadex G-50 columns.

Population Genetic Structure
Estimates of mitochondrial haplotype and nucleotide
diversity [91-93] and their associated standard deviations
were calculated using Arlequin 3.11 [94] for each reef and
region. Statistical differences in genetic diversity among
regions were determined using Kruskal-Wallis tests implemented in SPSS 16.

Hierarchical population genetic structure of A. polyacanthus among regions and reefs was explored using AMOVA
with 1000 permutations [95,96] implemented in Arlequin. Pairwise genetic distances among reefs were calculated using Arlequin and a false discovery rate to correct
for multiple tests (Benjamini-Hochberg) was applied to
all pairwise comparisons [97].
Differences in levels of migration among reefs were investigated further using Migrate 1.7.6.1 [33,34]. This program calculates reciprocal migration rates (i.e., 4Nem
from a to b, and vice versa) using a coalescence maximum
likelihood approach (Markov Chain Monte Carlo with
Hastings Metropolis importance sampling) and assumes
constant mutation rates and equal effective population
sizes. Because of the molecular divergences detected by
phylogenetic and AMOVA analyses, Migrate was run on
each geographical region separately. Reciprocal migration
rates were interpreted as different when their 95% confidence intervals did not overlap. Extensive sampling
regimes including 10 short chains sampled 10,000 times
each and 5 long chains sampled 100,000 each were averaged over 5 replicates. Migrate was implemented on a SGI

Performance Computing Facility using a ts/tv ratio of 1.53

problems with convergence of estimates, migration estimates and their associated profile likelihoods in low signal data [98]. Here we used a newer version of Migrate
with high signal data and found no evidence of lack of
convergence as repeated runs were highly consistent using
the implemented sampling strategy. We also found congruence of migration estimates with conventional estimates of population structure.
Genetic distances were estimated using the conventional
genetic distance estimator, ΦST, and geographical distances among locations were calculated using Vincenty's
inverse method http://www.ga.gov.au/nmd/geodesy/
datums/distance.jsp. Correlations between genetic and
geographical distances were tested using a Mantel test
(1,000 permutations) of both log-transformed and nontransformed data following [100] and implemented in
GenAlEx 6 [101]. A false discovery rate to correct for multiple tests (Benjamini-Hochberg) was applied to all pairwise comparisons [97]. Log transformation did not affect
the overall results and therefore, only non-transformed
kms versus ΦST are presented here.
Demographic History
Demographic histories were explored using mismatch
analysis in Arlequin and DnaSP [100] using 1000 bootstrap replicates. These analyses computed the distribution
of pairwise nucleotide differences to that expected under
population models of constant and sudden expansion
and assume that sub-populations are panmictic. The best
fit of models was determined using log-likelihood ratio
tests. The sums of square deviations (SSD) from the
observed mismatch distributions were calculated for each
of the models and log-likelihoods calculated following
the methodology outlined in [102]. The statistical significance of log-likelihood ratios was adjusted using FDR as
above and when different, the model with the lowest SSD
was accepted. The age of population expansion was estimated by τ = 2 μt, where μ = the mutation rate and t = generation time. τ values were not converted to absolute years
because of uncertainty associated with estimating mutation rates in fishes [103] and because comparisons were
relative among regions and reefs. Differences in τ values
were compared among regions using a Kruskal-Wallis test.
Predictions from the meta-population re-colonisation
models were examined by comparing estimates of genetic
differentiation among older and younger reefs. Relative
ages of reef samples were defined using the time of population expansion estimates (τ). Younger reefs were defined
by having τ confidence intervals that could not be distinguished from the present (i.e. 95% CI of τ included 0).
Older reefs were defined by having τ confidence intervals

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/248

that did not encompass the present (i.e. 95% CI of τ did
not include 0). Following this methodology, replicate
younger and older reefs could only be compared in the
central and southern regions because the 95% CI of τ did
not include 0 in any northern reefs. Because of the uncertainty associated with τ estimates and the relatively low
number of reefs compared here, these results should be
interpreted with caution.
The exponential population growth parameter (g) was calculated among reefs and regions using a maximum likelihood coalescence approach implemented in Fluctuate 1.4
[104]. This approach assumes that subpopulations are
panmictic, that population structure, growth, immigration and recombination rates have remained constant
throughout the lifespan of the underlying coalescent tree
[104]. A search strategy, each 10000 steps long using ten
short chains, sampling every 20th step, followed by ten
long chains each of 20000 steps sampled every 20th step,
gave consistent results among runs and was used in all
analyses. Estimates of g were compared among regions
using a Kruskal-Wallis test. We calculated Fu's Fs [105] and
R2 [100] neutrality indices using DnaSP because they are
the most sensitive to population growth [106]. Significance level was corrected for multiple testing using FDR as
above.

Tree of unique haplotypes. The phylogenetic structure of A. polyacanthus
was explored using Bayesian inference implemented in MrBayes 3.0B4
[107]. The analysis included 92 unique haplotypes found in the 283 individuals discussed above, 10 black morph individuals from Great Keppel
Island (23°10S; 150°57E) and three black and white morph individuals
from the Solomon Islands (9°24S; 160°32E). The analysis was performed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo search with four chains for
one million generations. Trees were sampled every 100 generations and
the first 100,000 generations were discarded as burn-in. The tree was outgroup rooted using two closely related species, Amphiprion melanopus
and A. akindynos. Credibility values were obtained from a majority rule
consensus tree of the last 2000 trees and values greater than 90% are
indicated on the major nodes of the tree.
