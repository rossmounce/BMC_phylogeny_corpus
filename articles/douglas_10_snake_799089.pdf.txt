Snake mitochondrial genomes: phylogenetic
relationships and implications of extended taxon
sampling for interpretations of mitogenomic
evolution
Desirée A Douglas1*, David J Gower2

Abstract
Background: Snake mitochondrial genomes are of great interest in understanding mitogenomic evolution
because of gene duplications and rearrangements and the fast evolutionary rate of their genes compared to other
vertebrates. Mitochondrial gene sequences have also played an important role in attempts to resolve the
contentious phylogenetic relationships of especially the early divergences among alethinophidian snakes. Two
recent innovative studies found dramatic gene- and branch-specific relative acceleration in snake protein-coding
gene evolution, particularly along internal branches leading to Serpentes and Alethinophidia. It has been
hypothesized that some of these rate shifts are temporally (and possibly causally) associated with control region
duplication and/or major changes in ecology and anatomy.
Results: The near-complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of three henophidian snakes were sequenced: Anilius
scytale, Rhinophis philippinus, and Charina trivirgata. All three genomes share a duplicated control region and
translocated tRNALEU, derived features found in all alethinophidian snakes studied to date. The new sequence data
were aligned with mt genome data for 21 other species of snakes and used in phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic
results agreed with many other studies in recovering several robust clades, including Colubroidea, Caenophidia,
and Cylindrophiidae+Uropeltidae. Nodes within Henophidia that have been difficult to resolve robustly in previous
analyses remained uncompellingly resolved here. Comparisons of relative rates of evolution of rRNA vs. proteincoding genes were conducted by estimating branch lengths across the tree. Our expanded sampling revealed
dramatic acceleration along the branch leading to Typhlopidae, particularly long rRNA terminal branches within
Scolecophidia, and that most of the dramatic acceleration in protein-coding gene rate along Serpentes and
Alethinophidia branches occurred before Anilius diverged from other alethinophidians.
Conclusions: Mitochondrial gene sequence data alone may not be able to robustly resolve basal divergences
among alethinophidian snakes. Taxon sampling plays an important role in identifying mitogenomic evolutionary
events within snakes, and in testing hypotheses explaining their origin. Dramatic rate shifts in mitogenomic
evolution occur within Scolecophidia as well as Alethinophidia, thus falsifying the hypothesis that these shifts in
snakes are associated exclusively with evolution of a non-burrowing lifestyle, macrostomatan feeding ecology and/
or duplication of the control region, both restricted to alethinophidians among living snakes.

Background
Vertebrate mitochondrial (mt) genomes have been the
subject of many studies of phylogeny and evolutionary
genetics and genomics, by virtue of characteristics such
as their manageable size and generally conserved gene
content and order. Interest in snake mitogenomics has
focused on topics as diverse as gene duplications, truncations and order rearrangements [1-4] Fig. 1], attempts
to resolve the contentious phylogenetic relationships of
the major snake lineages [5] and references therein] and,
in addition, inferring patterns and understanding processes of genome functionality and metabolic protein
evolution [3,6].
The most basal split within extant snakes is between
Scolecophidia (blind- and wormsnakes) and Alethinophidia. There is a large asymmetry in the number of
extant species in these two clades with only 15% of species belonging to Scolecophidia. Within Alethinophidia,
most species (c. 2,500) belong to the ‘advanced’ snake
clade Caenophidia, while the remaining (c. 180) species
comprise the paraphyletic Henophidia, whose phylogenetic intrarelationships are contentious [7].
Complete or near-complete mt genome sequences
have been published for over 20 snake species
[1-6,8-10]. Two innovative and important recent studies
[3,6] inferred phylogenetic relationships among snakes
based on complete mt genome sequence data for 10 and
11 species (and genera) respectively, and used this framework to examine mt genome evolution. These two
studies demonstrated that snakes are unusual among
vertebrates in their accelerated mt gene evolution, in
that protein-coding gene branch lengths along certain
branches (especially those ‘leading’ to all snakes and to
Alethinophidia) are disproportionately long relative to
rRNA genes, and that episodic bursts of gene- and
branch-specific evolution underpinned adaptive remodeling of metabolic proteins early in snake evolution
that are potentially causally associated with control
region duplication and/or major changes in anatomy,
ecology and behaviour.
Jiang et al. [3] and Castoe et al. [6] sampled five and
six non-caenophidian snakes, respectively. Given that
these studies found the most dramatic shifts in evolutionary rate and mt genome rearrangement to have
occurred along more basal internal branches, it is
important to increase sampling of non-caenophidian
lineages in order to identify more precisely where/when
in snake evolution some key mitogenomic features
(including control region duplication) were acquired,
and to conduct more stringent tests of the gene- and
branch-specific patterns that have been identified. Here
we report mt genome sequence data for three additional
henophidian (non-caenophidian alethinophidian) snake

species: Anilius scytale, Rhinophis philippinus and Charina trivirgata (see ref [11] for details of the taxonomy of
these species). Henophidian sampling is increased
further with the inclusion of the tropidophiid Tropidophis haetianus and another boid species, Eunectes
notaeus. In addition to the single scolecophidian
included in [3] and two included in [6], two species of
Ramphotyphlops and one Typhlops species are added
here. These data are included in new analyses of snake
phylogeny and mitogenomic evolution.

Results
Mt genomes of Anilius scytale, Rhinophis philippinus and
Charina trivirgata

The entire mt genome of C. trivirgata, except for the
repeat regions within the control regions, was
sequenced. All mt genes in A. scytale and R. philippinus
were sequenced except for the tRNAs flanking the
duplicate control region situated within the IQM tRNA
cluster (Fig. 1). As previously described for other alethinophidian genomes [1-4,9], the three new mt genomes
possess two control regions. This was confirmed in all
three species despite incomplete sequencing because it
was possible to sequence both the 5’ and 3’ ends of both
control regions in C. trivirgata and the 5’ ends of both
control regions for A. scytale and R. philippinus. In all
three genomes prominent C-rich regions - characteristic
of the control region 5’ end in the majority of vertebrate
mt genomes - were found. We failed to sequence the 3’
ends and tRNAs adjacent to CRII for both A. scytale
and R. philippinus, possibly because of extensive repeat
regions typically found at the 3’ end of the control
region. While this paper was in preparation Castoe et al.
[10] sequenced the mt genomes of A. scytale and Tropidophis haetianus. The mt genome of T. haetianus also
has a duplicate control region and a translocated tRNALEU
gene.
As in other alethinophidian mt genomes, the tRNALEU
(UUR) gene in C. trivirgata was found translocated from
its typical vertebrate position between the genes 16S and
ND1 to downstream of CRII. The same can be assumed
for A. scytale and R. philippinus because this gene was
not found between 16S and ND1. As in other alethinophidian snakes, the origin of light strand replication is
present in all three newly sequenced mt genomes, with
the stem being 12 bp long.
The lengths and GC content of ribosomal and protein-coding genes of the three mt genomes are shown in
Table 1. Gene lengths and GC content are similar to
those of other snakes. However, COI in A. scytale and
R. philippinus is much shorter than that of C. trivirgata
(see Table 1). In Xenopeltis unicolor, Python regius,
boids and caenophidians, COI is 1602 sites in length

whereas in T. haetianus, Rhinophis philippinus, Cylindrophis ruffus, A. scytale and scolecophidians COI
length is 1536-1581 nucleotides (data not shown). This
difference in length is attributable to gaps of variable
size occurring at the 3’ end of COI (data not shown).
The length of ND4 sequences also differs among major
snake lineages: 1338 nucleotides for all colubroids
except Achalinus meiguensis (1353 sites) but 1356 for
Acrochordus granulatus and henophidians. This difference in length is due to a single gap 130-150 nucleotides
into the sequence.
Phylogenetic analyses

The total number of nucleotides in the alignment was
12316 (8874 excluding 3rd codon positions), with 3442
amino acid sites. The maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses performed in this study
yielded trees with unequivocal support for major snake
taxa regardless of the method or model used. As we
explain below, many of the differences in analytical
results were relatively minor and did not conflict
strongly in that the contentious nodes were weakly supported. The only strongly conflicting results are shown
in Fig. 2 and 3, where boids are sister to either Python +
Xenopeltis + Cylindrophis + Rhinophis (Fig. 2) or to all
alethinophidians except Anilius and Tropidophis (Fig. 3).
The maximum likelihood (ML) GTR+I+Γ tree based on
the 4-partition nucleotide model is shown in Fig. 2. This
is identical to a tree recovered by running the 2nd codon
positions under the TN+I+Γ model, and the Bayesian
analysis in which nucleotide data was split into 26 partitions (see Methods). The Bayes factor for the 26- partition model (H1) against the 4-partition model (H0) was
B10 = 0.989 (2lnB10 = -0.02), indicating that there was no
significant difference between the two models.

Support for nodes labelled A-M (Fig. 2) in all trees is
shown in Table 2. The following clades received very
high to maximal support in all analyses: all alethinophidians except Anilius and Tropidophis (referred to here
as “core alethinophidians” - node A), Rhinophis + Cylindrophis (node F), Boidae (node G), Caenophidia (node
H), Colubroids except Achalinus meiguensis (node J),
Viperidae (node K), ‘colubrids’ + Elapidae (node L). The
clade uniting Python + Xenopeltis (node E) received very
high support in all trees except the CAT-GTR+Γ tree
(see Fig. 3) although support was still fairly strong in
this tree (0.92 BPP).
Although the inferred trees unanimously supported a
clade comprising core alethinophidians (node A), relationships between Anilius and Tropidophis were not
resolved compellingly. Anilius scytale + T. haetianus
(node B - see Fig. 2) was strongly supported in GTR
and mtREV analyses (Table 3) but only moderately supported in the CAT-Poisson+Γ tree. This clade was not
recovered at all in the CAT-GTR+Γ tree (Fig. 3),
although the alternative - T. haetianus and A. scytale as
successive outgroups to other (core) alethinophidians was only weakly supported (0.5 BPP). A clade comprising Rhinophis + Cylindrophis and Python + Xenopeltis
(node D) was recovered in all trees and received strong
support in Bayesian analyses but only weak to moderate
support in ML analyses (Table 3). Achalinus meiguensis
+ remaining Colubroidea (node I) received very high to
maximal support in nucleotide analyses but low support
in amino acid analyses with the exception of the mtREV
+I+Γ analysis run with the program PhyloBayes (Table
3). In the CAT-Poisson+Γ tree A. meiguensis joins with
Acrochordus granulatus with weak support (data not
shown). Enhydris plumbea is the sister to Elapidae

(node M) in nucleotide analyses and the PhyloBayes
mtREV+I+Γ analysis (Table 3) but this clade received
moderately high support only in the MrBayes nucleotide
analysis. Most amino acid analyses recovered E. plumbea to be the sister of a clade comprising colubrines
and elapids (see Additional file 1), but this never
received strong support.
Only node C (Fig. 2) is strongly supported or conflicted in different analyses. MrBayes analyses and
amino acid ML analyses recovered node C with very
high or maximal support (Fig. 2, Table 3), whereas this

node received <70% bootstrap/LR-ELW support in ML
nucleotide analyses. CAT-GTR and CAT-Poisson analyses recovered the alternative topology shown in Fig. 3
with ≥ 95 BPP. Interestingly, the mtREV analysis run
with PhyloBayes also recovered the boid relationship
shown in Fig. 3, albeit with only 0.65 BPP (see Additional file 2). Statistical tree comparisons with nucleotide
data could not reject the tree shown in Fig. 3 as significantly suboptimal compared to that in Fig. 2 (Table 2),
the difference in likelihood between the two trees only
negligible (ΔlnL = 4.8). With amino acid data however,

and ND6 (Fig. 7), with only slight deviances in other
genes/clusters. These same trends were evident under
both of the nucleotide partitioning schemes used (see
Methods section 2.6), and in the plot of rRNA vs. amino
acid branch lengths (Fig. 8), the latter suggests that
markedly raised protein-coding gene evolutionary rates
are not simply due to large numbers of synonymous
changes. The most dramatic acceleration in relative rate
of evolution occurred along the branches leading to Serpentes and to Alethinophidia, for which there was an
acceleration in most protein-coding genes. Relative rate
accelerations were found along the branch leading to A.
scytale + T.haetianus in COI and ND6 (Fig. 7). There
were no dramatic relative rate shifts in overall proteincoding gene evolution along the branch leading to core
alethinophidians, although there was a slight relative
acceleration in CYTB evolution here (Fig. 8). The other
branch that showed the most dramatic elevation in protein-coding gene relative rates was that leading to Typhlopidae, which had elevated relative rates in COI, CO2,
ATPs, ND2, ND4, ND5 and ND6. However, relative
rates of evolution in most protein-coding genes along
terminal typhlopid branches and the internal branch
leading to Ramphotyphlops are moderately decelerated,
also reflected in the amino acid plot (Figs. 7 and 8). In
the rRNA tree (Fig. 4), typhlopids have the longest
branches of all snake taxa except A. granulatus and L.
humilis, the latter having elevated rates in all genes. The
branch leading to Scolecophidia has relatively accelerated rates for COI, CO3, CYTB, ND3, ND4L and ND6,
but dramatically decelerated for ND2 and ND4. The
branch leading to Colubroidea occurs below the scatter
distribution in the graphs for most genes, ND6 being a
notable exception (Fig. 7). This deceleration is also seen
in the amino acid plot (Fig. 8). The branch leading to
Elapidae shows slight accelerations in rate in genes
ND1, ND4 and ND6, which is also reflected in the

For both nucleotide and amino acid data, the tree in Fig. 2 was the preferred
tree. The p-values shown here reflect the likelihood of topology of the tree in
Fig. 3 compared to topology 2. Whereas topology 3 is not rejected with
nucleotide data, it is rejected at the 5% level with amino acid data.

the CAT topology (ΔlnL = 23.47; Fig. 3) was rejected by
all statistical tests at the 0.05 significance level (Table 2).
Relative rates of molecular evolution of mt genes

Relative nucleotide branch lengths of rRNA genes and
protein-coding genes can be visualized in Figs. 4, 5 and
6. As expected, rRNA branches (Fig. 4) are substantially
shorter overall than protein-coding branches (Fig. 5).
CAT analyses also produced the same trend (data not
shown). Branches leading to Serpentes, Alethinophidia,
Typhlopidae and L. humilis show especially accelerated
amino acid change relative to rRNA nucleotide branch
lengths (Fig. 6). Our phylogenetic analyses produced
two alternative resolutions of basal nodes among core
henophidians (Figs. 2 and 3) and so the rates analyses
were carried out twice. The different trees barely
affected relative evolutionary rates, and the results
shown here are based on the phylogeny in Fig. 2.
Patterns of evolution for different genes along different branches found in this study are broadly concordant
with those presented by Jiang et al. [3]. Branch lengths
of rRNA and protein-coding genes are generally positively correlated, positive deviances from this correlation
being most prominent for CO genes, ATP genes, CYTB

to deliver an entirely robust tree. Our analyses confirmed strong support for many nodes that have been
robustly resolved in other studies, for example Colubroidea, Caenophidia, Colubridae, and nodes that were supported by other molecular studies but found to be
equivocal or generally not recovered by morphological
studies (Python+Xenopeltis, core alethinophidians, Cylindrophiidae + Uropeltidae). However, as with previous
molecular studies, most deeper henophidian nodes
could not be resolved robustly in this study. Low node
support is often associated with short internal branches
that can result from incongruence within data and/or
too few character changes (e.g. [14,15]). As is evident in
Figs. 2 and 3, there are many short internal branches
among henophidians, but that this is not a feature of
mitochondrial data alone is indicated by relatively short
branches and problematic nodes in analyses using
nuclear data also [15].
Prior to the first broad-scale molecular snake phylogenies, morphological phylogenies had reached a consensus on several relationships among major snake lineages
[7]. Morphologists were not entirely surprised by some
of the new molecular findings because they mostly
affected the less robustly inferred regions of morphological phylogenies, including the possible close relationship between pythons, Xenopeltis, and Loxocemus, the
non-monophyly of macrostomatan alethinophidians and
the non-monophyly of dwarf boas [16]. However, the
sister-group relationship between Anilius and tropidophiids proposed by several molecular studies [7,17-20]
remains a notable sticking point between molecular and
morphological studies [7], especially considering that
recovery of this clade in larger nuclear gene studies [15]
negates dismissal of this hypothesis as an aberration of
mt data alone. It might be noted that this relationship
was not very strongly supported in our analyses.

Discussion
Relationships among the major lineages of snakes

The phylogenetic relationships among non-caenophidian
snakes has fundamental importance for the interpretation of early snake evolution [7,12,13], but despite
increased geno- and phenotypic character sampling over
recent years, explicit quantitative phylogenetics has yet

Previous studies (e.g. refs [3,4]) have mapped the duplication of the control region and translocation of tRNALEU
to the internal branch leading to extant
alethinophidians, but incomplete taxon sampling (especially the absence of Anilius) had left this proposition
incompletely tested. Our identification of these same
derived mitogenomic features in A. scytale provides
empirical support for this. The same features are present
in all alethinophidian genomes sequenced to date.
Our analyses of relative rate variation in mt gene evolution across the snake tree produced several results in
concordance with the study of Jiang et al. [3], including
overall dramatically accelerated (relative to rRNAs) protein-coding gene evolutionary rates along the internal
branches leading to Serpentes and to Alethinophidia
though with notable gene- and branch-specific variation
(e.g., dramatic relative acceleration in evolution of COI,

COII, ATP8, ATP6, ND6 and CYTB along branch leading to Alethinophidia). Notable differences between our
results and those of Jiang et al. [3] are: no snake
branches disproportionately longer for rRNA (Fig. 4)

suggest dramatic relatively accelerated rRNA evolution;
no notable acceleration in relative rate of CYTB evolution (and less dramatic increase in ND2) along branch
leading to Serpentes; internal branch leading to

Colubroidea with relatively decelerated COI and CYTB
evolution (Fig. 7). The latter is potentially dependent on
the position of Achalinus meiguensis, which was not
resolved robustly here, but analyses with this taxon
excluded produced the same patterns (data not shown).
This study has generated new findings, notably: an
overall dramatically accelerated protein-coding gene
evolution on the branch leading to Typhlopidae; terminal branches within Typhlopidae and the internal

branch leading to Ramphotyphlops generally falling
below the main distribution in gene-gene plots (Fig. 7);
relative acceleration in COI and ND6 along the branch
leading to A. scytale + T. haetianus; the terminal branch
leading to A. scytale slightly accelerated for CYTB, ND4,
ND5 and ND6; further relative acceleration in CYTB
and ND6 evolution along branch leading to core alethinophidians; relative acceleration in ND1, ND4 and ND6
along the branch leading to Elapidae. Although we did
not carry out the in-depth analytical tests of positive
selection or protein structural modelling performed by

Page 10 of 16

Castoe et al. [6], the rRNA vs. protein-coding amino
acid branch length plot (Fig. 8) demonstrates that some
of the acceleration in molecular evolution along the
branches leading to Serpentes, Alethinophidia and
Typhlopidae is likely to be adaptive in that it leads to
changes in protein sequences, and is not simply an
increase in ‘silent’ substitutions.
Our greater taxon sampling enabled us to identify
additional trends in mt gene evolution for some snake
clades. Within Scolecophidia, we found dramatic relative
acceleration in protein-coding gene evolution along the
branch leading to Typhlopidae but subsequent relative
deceleration (relative acceleration in rRNA evolution)
along all terminal typhlopid branches. The terminal
branch joining Leptotyphlops humilis to the rest of the
tree appears above the main distribution in most genegene plots (for nucleotide and amino acid data), but
comparison with other lineages is complicated because
only one leptotyphlopid mt genome has been sequenced.
Additional sampling of leptotyphlopids is required to
clarify mitogenomic evolution along this branch. The
inclusion of L. humilis is not responsible for the rapid
protein evolution identified along the branch leading to
Typhlopidae because this branch is similarly long in
amino acid trees that exclude L. humilis (data not
shown). The generally long branches within Scolecophidia and seemingly strongly fluctuating rate dynamics
suggest that mitogenomic evolution within this group is
worthy of greater attention. Although scolecophidians
represent one half of the basal divergence among living
snakes they are often overlooked, perhaps because of
their superficial morphological and ecological homogeneity, which is, however, deceptive [21].
Castoe et al. [6] observed that dramatic adaptive shifts
in the evolution of metabolic proteins occurred along
the branch leading to Alethinophidia and so were potentially temporally associated with the origin of a duplicated control region, and they suggested that these
shifts along this internal branch were causally associated
with major anatomical, ecological, and behavioural
changes such as an ecological niche shift to a non-burrowing lifestyle, increased body size, increased skull kinesis and gape and prey size, development of specialized
venom proteins, and the ability of individuals to dramatically remodel their organs and physiology. The scenario of a single major switch from a burrowing to nonburrowing (and macrostomatan) condition early in
alethinophidian history has been eroded by some of the
more recent phylogenetic results for henophidian
snakes, so that identifying broad suites of phenotypic
adaptive change along the branch leading to Alethinophidia is not as trivial as previously assumed. However,
the rapid remodelling of metabolic proteins before the
burrowing Anilius diverged from other alethinophidians

and, importantly, evidence of elevated relative rates of
metabolic protein evolution in the branch leading to the
exclusively burrowing Scolecophidia (which lack a duplicated control region) rejects the exact correlations that
underpin some of the precise aspects of the hypotheses
previously proposed to explain the observed mitogenomic evolutionary patterns.

Conclusions
Phylogenetic analyses of complete mt genome data
strongly support many of the clades identified in previous studies such as core Alethinophidia, Colubroidea
and Cylindrophiidae + Uropeltidae, but deeper henophidian nodes were not resolved with compelling support.
Extended taxon sampling allowed us to identify dramatic
acceleration of metabolic protein evolution within Scolecophidia in addition to the rate shifts identified by Jiang
et al. [3]. In addition, control region duplication and
most of the rate acceleration in mt genes occurred
before Anilius and Tropidophis branched off from the
rest of Alethinophidia, although less dramatic acceleration in protein-coding mt genes occur in these lineages.
Our new data discount a consistent link between extraordinary bursts of mitogenomic evolution early in snake
history and control region duplication or transition to a
non-burrowing lifestyle and macrostomatan feeding
ecology. Further taxon sampling for mt genomes can
contribute to an improved phylogenetic understanding
and will be crucial for further investigation of mitogenomic evolution. We identify priority taxa for both phylogenetic and mitogenomic studies to be Anomochilus,
bolyeriids, the monotypic Xenophidion and Loxocemus,

and more scolecophidians (especially at least one anomalepidid and more leptotyphlopids).

Methods
Taxon sampling, DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing

We analysed complete/near-complete mt sequence data
for 24 species of snakes (22 genera), currently available
through Genbank and those sequenced here (Table 4).
Thus, we include approximately double the number of
species analysed by Jiang et al. [3], with 8 of 13 of the
additional species being non-caenophidians and therefore potentially clarifying the nature of the mitogenomic
evolution occurring along more basal internal branches
in the snake tree. We generated new sequence data for
single specimens of Anilius scytale (Kaw Mountains,
French Guiana: no voucher), Rhinophis philippinus
(National Museum, Colombo, Sri Lanka field number
MW 1740), and Charina trivirgata saslowi (sourced
through the pet trade: no voucher). Total DNA was
extracted from muscle tissue using the organic extraction method. Overlapping fragments of mtDNA were
amplified with Ex-Taq and Z-Taq (Takara) polymerases
and using conserved primers designed in this and previous studies [9,22]. PCR-products were sequenced
using the ABI automated sequencing system. The taxonomy we use is shown in Table 4 and Fig. 2.
Data assembly and alignment

Sequences were edited and assembled using EditView
1.0.1 (Perkin-Elmer). Gene organization within the
mtDNA sequences was inferred by comparisons with
other snake genomes using the program SeAl (v2.0a11).
The twelve H-strand encoded mt gene sequences from

Douglas and Gower BMC Genomics 2010, 11:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/14

all taxa were aligned using MAFFT [23] and concatenated. 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA genes were aligned
using the program T-COFFEE [24] incorporating information from secondary structure [25]. All mt gene
alignments were subsequently inspected manually.
Alignment-ambiguous characters (where the program
was equivocal in the placing of certain gaps) were
excluded from the dataset.
Data partitioning and modelling

The data were analysed separately as nucleotide and
amino acid sequences. The nucleotide data were subdivided into three partitions (rRNAs; protein-coding 1st
codon positions; 2nd codon positions). The phylogenetic
signal in 3rd codon positions was investigated by running preliminary parsimony and neighbour joining analyses using PAUP* [26], and found to contain
substantially more signal when analysed under RY coding than as raw nucleotide data. In RY coding, pyrimidine bases C and T are analysed as one character, as are
purine bases A and G. RY-coded third positions were
thus included as a fourth partition in ML and MB analyses. Third codon positions were not included in PhyloBayes analyses because RY coding is not possible on this
platform (N. Lartillot, pers. comm.).
Whether further partitioning of the data would yield
an improvement over the 4-partition dataset was investigated by calculating the Bayes Factor (B 10 ), which is
robust against Type I error ([27], J. Brown, pers.
comm.). A dataset with 26 partitions (12S rRNA, 16S
rRNA, ND1, ND2, CO1, CO2+ATP8+ATP6, CO3+ND3
+ND4L, ND4, ND5, CYTB, with all protein-coding
genes being split into three partitions comprising 1st,
2nd and 3rd codon positions) represented H1 and the 4partition dataset represented H0. Third codon positions
were coded as RY. Both datasets were analysed using
the program MrBayes (see below). The harmonic means
were calculated using the program Tracer (v 1.4) and
incorporated into the formula: B10 = harmonic mean L1/
harmonic mean L0. The Bayes Factor was interpreted as
in Kass & Raftery [28].
The model of choice for each partition was determined using the program Modeltest [29]. Both the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) and Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) found the GTR+I+Γ model [30,31] as
best fitting for all partitions except 2nd codon positions,
for which LRT found TN+I+Γ [32] as best fitting.
Amino acid sequences were analyzed using the mtREV
+I+Γ model [33]. The categories model with GTR
(CAT-GTR) and CAT-Poisson models [34,35] were also
used to analyse nucleotide and amino acid data,
respectively.
Phylogenetic analyses

Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed in
Treefinder [36]. For nucleotide sequences each analysis

Page 13 of 16

was started from ten different initial trees to increase
the amount of tree space explored. Amino acid analyses
were initiated from five different start trees. Support for
nodes was determined using expected likelihood weights
of local rearrangements (LR-ELW) with 1000 replicates
for each node. Both nucleotide and amino acid data
were also bootstrapped with 200 and 100 replicates,
respectively. Bayesian analyses run under GTR+I+Γ and
mtREV+I+Γ models were performed using MrBayes
[37,38] freely available through Bioportal cluster [39].
Nucleotide and amino acid data were run for 10,000,000
and 5,000,000 generations, respectively. Convergence
was checked using Tracer. Analyses using CAT models
were run with the PhyloBayes 2.3 program package [34]
also available on Bioportal. Here amino acid data were
analyzed using both CAT-Poisson and mtREV+I+Γ
models. Convergence was checked with the bpcomp program, whereby convergence was reached if the maxdiff
value = <0.1.
Because our primary concern was the relationships of
snake lineages, the main phylogenetic analyses were not
conducted with (distant) non-snake outgroups. Instead,
we rooted Scolecophidia with Alethinophidia and vice
versa, based on this being a well-supported relationship
in previous morphological and molecular estimates of
snake phylogeny [3,7,13,15,40].
Tree comparisons

Alternative topologies were compared statistically using
the program Treefinder. Both nucleotide and amino
acid data were analyzed. Six statistical tests were carried
out simultaneously: Bootstrap Probability [41],
Expected-Likelihood Weights (ELW) [42], Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) [43], Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH), Weighted
SH (WSH) [44] and Approximately Unbiased (AU) [45],
all implemented in Treefinder [36].
Relative rates of evolution of mt genes

In accordance with Jiang et al. [3], we analysed temporal
patterns of molecular evolution, measured by nucleotide
branch length, among the different branches of the
snake tree for individual protein-coding genes relative to
branch lengths for 12S + 16S rRNAs. We also carried
out similar analyses based on amino acid sequences in
order to gain some insight as to whether notably rapid
nucleotide change in protein-coding genes was associated with (potentially adaptive) change at the protein
level. Because we wanted to include estimates of the
length of the branch connecting snakes to other squamates, we included the following selection of lizard outgroups (Genbank accessions in parentheses): Gekko
gecko (NC 007627), Coleonyx variegatus (NC 008774),
Cordylus warreni (NC 005962), Eumeces egregius (NC

phylogeny used to calculate branch lengths was fixed,
with the relationships among snakes based on our phylogenetic results, and those among lizards following refs
[46] and [47].
The branch lengths of rRNA and protein-coding genes
were compared by firstly estimating branch lengths
separately for rRNAs and all protein-coding genes using
both nucleotide and amino acid data. Because of the
erosion of signal at 3rd codon positions (see section 2.3)
1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions were weighted 2, 1
and 5, respectively. ND6 was analysed as a separate partition because of its aberrant base composition. The
amino acid analysis was run without partitioning. Secondly, rRNA branch lengths were compared with those
for individual protein-coding genes in bivariate plots.
Following Jiang et al. [3] the short genes CO2, ATP8
and ATP6 were concatenated into one partition to
reduce stochastic error, as were genes CO3, ND3 and
ND4L. Two different partitioning schemes were used for
each protein-coding gene/cluster: a) 1-partition with 1st,
2nd and 3rd codon positions assigned different weights
as described above and b) equal-weighted 3-partitions
based on codon position, with RY coding of 3rd codon
positions. This second partitioning scheme was used as
an alternative to amino acid data that, because of the
shorter gene lengths, would increase the risk of

stochastic error. The use of RY coding reduces variation
at 3rd codon positions considerably, which means that
the branch lengths would more accurately reflect evolution at 1st and 2nd codon positions. Nucleotide and
amino acid branch lengths were estimated in Treefinder.
Branch lengths for each protein-coding gene/cluster
were plotted against the respective branch lengths for
rRNAs in Microsoft Excel.
