Abstract
Background: Multiple alignment of protein sequences can provide insight into sequence
conservation across many species and thus allow identification of those sections of the sequence
most critical to protein function. This insight can be augmented by joint display of conserved
domains along the sequences. By fusing this metadata visually, biologists can analyze sequence
conservation and functional motifs simultaneously and efficiently.
Results: We present MSAVis, a new approach combining luminance and hue for simultaneous
visualization of conserved motifs and sequence alignment. Input for the algorithm is a multiple
sequence alignment in a standard format. The NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is used
for finding conserved domains along the alignment. The visualization quickly identifies conserved
domains, and allows both macro (sequence-long) and micro (small amino-acid neighborhood)
views.
Conclusion: MSAVis utilizes two visual cues, luminance and hue, to facilitate at-a-glance summary
of the conservation of a user-provided protein alignment while enabling multiple comparisons
among functional domains. These visual cues are preattentive and separable so that the relationship
between conservation strength and domain membership can be understood. The MSAVis software,
written in Python and using BioPython and OpenGL, can be found at http://agbase.msstate.edu/
tools/MSAVis.html.

Background
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is one of the most
widely used methods for assessing sequence conservation and conservaton of protein domains because it
allows biologists to analyze the similarities and

differences of related proteins at from the individual
amino acid level to the sequence level. Figure 1 shows a
portion of a multiple sequence alignment of DNA
methyltransferase (Trdmt1) proteins from 3 different
organisms: Human [GenBank:NP_004403], cow

Figure 1
Traditional depiction of multiple sequence alignment. A depiction of the multiple sequence alignment of 3 DNA
methyltransferase (Trdmt1) proteins from different organisms: Human [GenBank:NP_004403], cow [GenBank:NP_861528],
and mouse [GenBank:NP_034197]. Strength of alignment is indicated by asterisks, colons, periods, or spaces from strongest to
weakest. Clustal [1] was used to generate the image. In the image, color indicates physico-chemical properties of the aminoacid, and the symbols below each position in the sequence indicate the amount of conservation ('*': Exact, ':': Conserved
Substitution, '.': Semi-conserved substitution).

[GenBank:NP_861528], and mouse [GenBank:
NP_034197]. The canonical representation of an MSA
has each protein sequence on a separate line with
matching characters aligned in columns and spaces
inserted where necessary to improve the alignment –
these spaces are called gaps and are represented by
dashes. The amount of conservation of each position is
represented by symbols at the bottom of each set of
proteins: In the figure, an ‘*’ (asterisk) represents an
exact match in all sequences, a ‘:’ (colon) means that a
“conserved substitution has occurred” (i.e., the amino
acids are not exactly the same, but are of the same
general type), and a ‘.’ (period) means that a “semiconserved substitution has occurred” [1]. The degree of
conservation can also be given as a number for either an
individual sequence location or the entire sequence with
larger numbers meaning a higher degree of conservation.
Finally, as shown in the figure, color can be used to
indicate the physico-chemical properties of the amino
acid (e.g., blue for acidic); amino acids with similar
properties share a hue. The similarities and differences
highlighted by multiple sequence alignments can lead to
conclusions about the evolutionary history of organisms,
as well as information pinpointing functional parts of
the sequences of each organism.

proteins sequence that enable it to serve a particular
biological role. Because these sections tend to be
evolutionarily conserved (they remain the same in
related organisms), they are also called conserved domains
(CDs). NCBI states, “computational biologists define
conserved domains based on recurring sequence patterns
or motifs [2].” After a sequence has been identified as a
functional conserved domain experimentally or using
predictive methods, a computer model of the domain
can be generated. That model is then used to identify the
domain in sequences from other organisms. There are
many online databases that take a protein sequence as a
query and return matching domains; for this work, the
Conserved Domain Database (CDD) from NCBI [2,3]
was used.

Sequence alignment provides information about the
primary structural similarity of the proteins, however, this
is not indicative by itself of their functional similarity.
Biologists often want to investigate the functional
domains of proteins. These are the sections of the

Both the MSA and CD diagrams provide clues to the
similarities of proteins: The former indicates conservation of primary structure while the second shows
inferred functional motifs. When these are viewed
individually, however, it is difficult to determine how

As with MSAs, the conserved domains of a protein may
be depicted as well (Figure 2). For a single protein, each
domain is indicated by a bar corresponding to the
regions where the domain is expressed; these can be
continuous or segmented as shown in the figure. It is
possible that the domain is incomplete if it is cut off at
the beginning or the end of the protein sequence. This
depiction provides a concise summary of the CDs for the
given protein, but it is limited in its expressivity.

Figure 2
Conserved domains over the human protein from Figure 1. A depiction of all of the conserved domains from
human Trdmt1 protein [GenBank:NP_004403]; each domain is represented by a blue/red ribbon over the sequence (gaps
indicate gaps in the domain). Additional metadata about each domain is presented at the bottom. A figure like this can be generated
for each protein to see all the conserved domains; comparison between them is difficult and inefficient. From NCBI's CDD [3].
the primary structure and motifs interrelate. Sequence
information shows the similarity of the multiple
proteins, but no domain information. Similarly, domain
information is typically only displayed for one protein at
a time. To address these limitations, we have developed
MSAVis, a method to visually fuse the strength of the
alignment and the presence of conserved domains over a
set of proteins. The remainder of this article reviews
systems similar to MSAVis, and describes how MSAVis
was designed using principles of visualization and its
capabilities.
Related work
Bioinformatics visualization presents inherently nonspatial biological data using interactive computer graphics. The purpose of these depictions is to solve a
domain scientist’s task. The variety of biovisualization
systems is beyond the scope of our work; for a survey, see
the summary by Lungu and Xu [4]. Instead, we review
the work in sequence alignment and conserved domain
visualization as a basis for our discussion about MSAVis.

As Figure 1 demonstrates, textual views of MSAs do not
scale either in the number of proteins (rows per block) or
in the length of the sequence (number of blocks).
Graphical methods thus attempt to compress this information or provide methods for effective exploration. One of
the first of these were Sequence Logos [5]. A sequence logo
compresses the rows of the MSA diagram into a single
display – the vertical column summarizes an entire group
of proteins or nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). For each
column (a position in the protein/nucleic acid string), a

stack of letters that occur in that position is drawn; the
letters are scaled by occurrence so that amino acids or
nucleotides that occur more often are taller than those that
occur infrequently. Sequence logos provide a quick glance
at the most common characters amongst the sequences;
however, the structure of an individual sequence is lost.
Note that a sequence logo does not compress the length of
the sequence, so scrolling is still required to view very long
chains of characters.
In contrast to sequence logos, SequenceJuxtaposer [6]
displays each character in every sequence over the entire
length. However, it elides the display of the amino acid/
nucleotide character by representing each by a unique
color. Thus, it provides a zoomed out view of the entire
sequence as a colored matrix where position (i, j)
indicates the jth amino acid in protein i. The user can
expand the display vertically (e.g, focusing on a subset of
proteins) or horizontally (e.g., focusing on a region of
the sequence). As the user zooms, the characters of the
sequence are shown as space becomes available. Other
methods compress the sequences graphically as well
[7-9]. Some, like SequenceJuxtaposer, only show
sequence information; others, like Phylo-Vista [8], also
show related information (e.g., genomic data). None of
them, however, fuse the conserved domain information
with the sequences.
The area of conserved domain visualization is less
explored. NCBI’s Conserved Domain Database (CDD)
provides a suite of tools for depicting CDs [2,3]. For a
single protein, it produces images as demonstrated by

Page 3 of 9

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 11):S7

Figure 2: All CDs over the protein are depicted. Similar,
non-interactive views are available from InterPro [10,11]
and UniProt [12,13]; proteins are shown (one at a time
or in groups) with all the domains but no alignment
details. This grouping prevents efficient visual comparison. In addition, CDD uses a phylogenetic tree-like
visualization to show related domains from other species
for a given selected CD. However, this tree view loses the
sequence information from the original protein – one
cannot view all the CDs from a group of proteins
concurrently.
Jalview [14] is the tool that is most closely related to
ours. Jalview can be used to both display and edit
protein sequences, and can depict considerable metadata
about a squence. Color is used in the sequence view to
either show a single CD or the overall strength of the
alignment; separate windows are used to breakdown the
elements of the alignment strength. However, with
Jalview it is not possible to effectively view more than
a few domains on an alignment, especially if multiple
conserved domains matches overlap on part of a
sequence. Furthermore, it is not easily possible to get
an overall view – across the entire alignment – of where
each conserved domain lies as Jalview does not provide a
compressed view as does SequenceJuxtaposer. Our
MSAVis approach, though limited to MSA and CD
visualization, visually fuses both in a manner not
currently supported by extant tools; this visual fusion
is explained in the next section.
Implementation
MSAVis depicts aligned protein sequences, the strength
of the alignment, and the conserved domains over the
collected proteins. Starting from a pre-calculated alignment provided by the user in ClustalW [1] or PHYLIP
[15] format, MSAVis queries the online NCBI CDD for
each sequence and parses the results. Thus, for every
position along a given sequence, the following is known:

• The protein to which the amino acid belongs
• Its position within the protein
• The strength of the overall alignment at the
position over all the proteins
• Whether or not the position is part of one of the
known conserved domains
We use this information to build up the visualization
(Figure 3). The elements of this visualization, and how
one interacts with it, are discussed in this section.
Visualization overview
Unlike other systems for viewing alignments, MSAVis
depicts an overview that iterates over conserved domains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S11/S7

rather than the protein alignment; for example, there are
five conserved domains or related structures in Figure 3
(Cyt_C5_DNA_methylase [CDD:cd00315], DNA_methylase [CDD:pfam00145], Dcm [CDD:COG0270],
PRK10458 [CDD:PRK10458], and COG1092 [CDD:
COG1092]). The horizonatal block for each domain
repeats the alignment (Figure 4). The alignment position
is displayed across the top. Initially, the entire sequence
is shown; thus, individual amino acids may not be
resolvable (potentially having been reduced to a few
pixels or less of horizontal space). The strength of the
alignment at any position is communicated with a
luminance color ramp based on sum-of-pairs scoring at
each position in the alignment provided by the user: At
each position, BLOSUM62 [16] is used to score the
alignment of each pair of amino acids; these are summed
over all possible combinations at that position to
calculate the conservation “strength” s. Given the
maximum and minimum s over the entire alignment,
we normalize the strengths to fall in the range [0, 1]. We
use these to look up the corresponding color in a 256entry colormap (Figure 5); the colormaps are designed
such that a linear increase in the normalized s
corresponds to a linear decrease in brightness (darker is
more conserved). Thus, dark, saturated, contiguous
regions are highly conserved while the lighter regions
between them indicate mismatches or possible gaps. For
example, in Figure 3, the conservation is not very strong
(not a lot of dark grey), but not very poor either (not a
lot of white). Currently, the range of luminance variance
cannot be changed.
Each sequence in the alignment is assigned a color, as
shown in the key at the top of the interface. Each protein
color has roughly the same base luminance so that
brightness changes due to the sequence strength appear
consistent for each protein (Figure 5). In the visualization,
a bar of color is drawn wherever the respective conserved
domain is present in that sequence across a specified
portion of the alignment. In Figure 3, it is easy to tell that
the DNA_methylase site-specific domain is present in every
sequence near both ends of the alignment. Similarly, the
COG1092 domain (bottom) is only extant in human
(green, [GenBank:NP_004403]) and chimp (purple, [GenBank:XP_001151907]). The depiction also quickly identifies potential incomplete domain classifications; for
example, the Cyt_C5_DNA_Methalase domain (top
group) is missing from the beginning of the Opossum
protein whereas it is present in all eight other species.
Furthermore, even though most of the domains overlap, it
is still easy to see where they lie on the alignment since
they are displayed on separate tracks.
The alignment overview can be useful for drawing
general conclusions about some parts of the alignment.

Figure 3
The MSAVis visualization interface. MSAVis visually fuses multiple sequence alignments with depictions of the conserved
domains over the individual proteins. For each conserved domain, an alignment block is shown indicates where the
conserved domain exists for the given protein (see Figure 4 for presentation details).

Figure 4
Building block of the MSAVis visualization. For each conserved domain, the sequence alignment information is repeated:
Each protein is represented as a row where columns are shaded by alignment strength (stronger alignment is darker).
Regions of a row that are colored by a color unique to the protein are part of the given conserved domain.

user can continue to select subregions as desired. When
the user selects an area small enough to make drawing
the individual amino acids characters viable, these are
also displayed. Figure 6 shows a portion of the
alignment where most of the sequences have the
DNA_methylase domain present. In this view, a user
can see each individual amino acid in every sequence in
addition to the strength of the matches. In this example,
it is easy to see that at position 187 (a quarter of the way
from the left), all of the amino acids match in every
sequence, so the colors are darkest. However, in the
middle of the view, as the alignment strength lessens
(gaps are inserted and columns are mismatched), the
colors become lighter.

Figure 5
Luminance color ramps for indicating protein
conservation in the alignment. 10 hues were chosen to
be equally distinct from each other in a perceptual color
space to represent the presence of a conserved domain on a
protein; the same color is used for the same protein across
domains. Each step along the color map (and the colormap
for the background at the bottom) indicates an increase in
the amino acid conservation on the protein at that position.
Often, however, this view will motivate the user to look
more closely at an alignment subset. MSAVis allows the
user to drag a rectangle around the area of interest to
explore the conserved domains’ relationship to the
alignment in greater detail.
More detailed views
When zooming, the detail view smoothly replaces
the overview (Figure 6). This view is very similar to the
overview but is constrained to the sequence subset; the

Users can scroll through the alignment using the scroll
button on their mouse as well as the arrow keys on the
keyboard. Additionally, users can click and drag the
sequence labels on the left to move that sequence higher
or lower in the stack, for closer analysis of a subset of the
sequences, while still keeping information about all the
sequences available. Similarly, domains may be removed
entirely from the display by deselecting them from the
checkbox of CDs near the top of the interface (Figure 3).
Finally, users can easily zoom back out to the full view
by clicking the right mouse button.
Visual and interaction design
Considerable care was taken in the visual design of
MSAVis. For the proteins, unique, equal brightness
colors were chosen; we choose ten hues roughly evenly
separated in the CIE L*a*b* perceptually uniform color
space [17]. In other words, each of the colors is equally
visually distinguishable (barring color-blindness). The
colors are the same brightness so that we can independently use luminance to encode the amount of conservation. Both of these visual cues are pre-attentive and
separable [18] so that conservation strength and CD
membership can be seen at a glance simultaneously.

Figure 6
MSAVis viewing a subset of the alignment. Subsequences over the proteins can be zoomed in order to investigate
potential causes for the alignment or positions of the conserved domains. At certain zoom level, the individual amino acids for
a protein are displayed. In this example, we can see that the dissimilarity in alignment leads to a gap in DNA_methylase over
several species. The expectation value displayed is provided by the CDD.

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 11):S7

The interaction with the interface also used cognitive
principles in its design. Exploration of data is cyclic; thus,
interfaces which facilitate overview-to-specific interactions mesh well with common exploration schemas [19].
Users can iteratively test hypotheses of the relationship
between the alignment and the conserved domains – a
user can zoom in on the gap in DNA_methylase first
(Figure 6), and then examine the dissimilarity exhibited
by COG1092 later. In addition, since our users will
primarily be doing comparisons among proteins, the
groupings of proteins into blocks facilitates this comparison. If a user wants to compare CDs, we do allow
reordering of the CDs so two domains may be compared
side-by-side. While this is not the most ideal arrangement, it is sufficient for pair-wise investigation.
Architecture
MSAVis is implemented in Python and uses BioPython
[20] to load pre-aligned sequences in ClustalW or
PHYLIP format and to calculate the sequence conservation at each location. This sequences are then processed
live via the NCBI CD database to find conserved
domains. It is cross-platform, using PyOpenGL [21]
and wxPython [22] for its rendering and window
management. We are currently considering a web-based
option to interface with AgBase at Mississippi State [23];
the software is currently available from the AgBase
website [24].

Results and discussion
MSAVis provides a single view for presenting alignment
conservation and the presence or absence of a conserved
domain over a group of proteins. Unlike Jalview or the
CDD, it depicts multiple conserved domains that may
coincident over several proteins. This facilitates comparison of the conserved domains across species with less
effort that previously available. MSAVis has both an
overview and zoomed in view of the sequence (like
Jalview), but contains these within a single display that
can be dynamically navigated (unlike Jalview or the
CDD). The overall goal of MSAVis is reduce the time
required to explore the relationship between multiple
proteins and their conserved domains and we have
achieved this by providing both a compact view of this
information and reducing the number of interactions
with the data. For example, to compare the five
conserved domains over the nine proteins given in
Figure 3 would require nine views within the CDD (one
for each protein) or 5 views in Jalview (one for each
domain).
Feedback from our biologist colleagues has been
positive, and we are deploying the tool for their use.
Currently, the tool is for browsing only: It does not allow

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S11/S7

editing of the sequences or changing the alignments as
does Jalview or other tools. Per the request of our
collaborators, we are looking into this feature for the
future.
Exploration using MSAVis is interactive; zooming in or
out takes less than a second. Online access to the CDD
and processing the domains when loading takes the
most time (roughly a minute for the example presented
in this paper).
Our tool provides a unique approach to the simultaneous display of the alignment and conserved domains
that is not currently found in widely available tools such
as MEME, GenDoc, and BioEdit. MEME [25,26] is
primarily a tool for discovering sequence motifs but
also provides a number of methods for displaying the
discovered motifs (the information content at each
position in the pattern, a logos format of the motif,
and a neighbor-joining tree of the motif). The output
most similar to that provided by our tool is a blocks
diagram of the discovered motifs on the training set
sequences; MEME does not support simultaneously
viewing motifs and the alignment. GeneDoc [27,28]
provides a set of tools for visualizing, editing, and
analyzing multiple sequence alignments of both proteins
and nucleic acids in an evolutionary context. These tools
provides two residue display modes (display all or
display only those different from the master sequence)
that can be combined with a number of different grayscale or color shading modes. There are also options
allowing the user to define grouping and shading
options that could be used with conserved domains
imported from an external source such as NCBI.
However, there is no easy mechanism for simultaneous
visualization of domains and alignment strength nor for
providing both detailed and high level views of the
alignment. BioEdit [29] is primarily a sequence editing
program but does also allow the user to import and
display features from GenBank or GenPept sequences
including the region feature that often corresponds to a
conserved domain. However, all regions will be displayed at one time in one color on a single alignment.
Our approach focuses on a small part of the larger
protein sequence analysis problem that these popular
tools address.
While MSAVis has proven successful for jointly visualizing sequence alignment and functional domain data, it
has its limitations. As mentioned previously, we only
have a limited set of unique hues for proteins; after ten,
they begin to repeat. We made an attempt to stagger the
colors so that similar hues are not next to each other, but
this becomes more difficult as more than 12 proteins are
added. In addition, as the number of conserved domains

increase, the space used by the checkbox toggles
increases; we are investigating more space efficient
presentation for the CD toggles.

Authors’ contributions
Conclusion
Our prototype application demonstrates a new method
for displaying multiple sequence alignments and conserved domains at different levels of detail. Both the
alignment and the location of CDs can be viewed at a
glance, and interactive exploration facilitates understanding of their interrelationship. We have taken a
principled approach using results from visualization
design to create an effective visualization. Initial feedback from our biology colleagues has been positive, and
we are currently exploring their data for further system
improvements.
As protein sequences become available for many nonmodel species, the need for mechanisms to analyze
changes in conserved motifs will increase. For example,
the availability of the opossum and platypus genomes
provided insight into the functional motifs of mammalian genes. MSAVis provides a rapid method for
investigating how these motifs are different from each
other as more organisms are added.

In the future, we plan to investigate methods for
displaying additional layers of information on the
display, such as predicted DNA binding sites; some of
this data is already present in CDD views but only for a
protein at a time. In addition, we will explore a webbased version for distribution. More sophisticated
methods scoring the alignment, such as information
theoretic-based approaches, may also be explored to
enhance the visual presentation. Finally, as mentioned,
our collaborators have expressed the desire to be able to
edit sequences; by editing the sequence and updating the
conserved domain display, the accuracy of a sequence or
its relationship to its domain might be better understood.
