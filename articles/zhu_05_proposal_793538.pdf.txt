Abstract
Background: Rickettsiae closely related to the Malish strain, the reference Rickettsia conorii strain,
include Indian tick typhus rickettsia (ITTR), Israeli spotted fever rickettsia (ISFR), and Astrakhan
fever rickettsia (AFR). Although closely related genotypically, they are distinct serotypically. Using
multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we have recently found that distinct serotypes may not always
represent distinct species within the Rickettsia genus. We investigated the possibility of classifying
rickettsiae closely related to R. conorii as R. conorii subspecies as proposed by the ad hoc committee
on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics. For this, we first estimated their genotypic
variability by using MLST including the sequencing of 5 genes, of 31 rickettsial isolates closely
related to R. conorii strain Malish, 1 ITTR isolate, 2 isolates and 3 tick amplicons of AFR, and 2 ISFR
isolates. Then, we selected a representative of each MLST genotype and used multi-spacer typing
(MST) and mouse serotyping to estimate their degree of taxonomic relatedness.
Results: Among the 39 isolates or tick amplicons studied, four MLST genotypes were identified: i)
the Malish type; ii) the ITTR type; iii) the AFR type; and iv) the ISFR type. Among these four MLST
genotypes, the pairwise similarity in nucleotide sequence varied from 99.8 to 100%, 99.4 to 100%,
98.2 to 99.8%, 98.4 to 99.8%, and 99.2 to 99.9% for 16S rDNA, gltA, ompA, ompB, and sca4 genes,
respectively. Representatives of the 4 MLST types were also classified within four types using MST
genotyping as well as mouse serotyping.
Conclusion: Although homogeneous genotypically, strains within the R. conorii species show MST
genotypic, serotypic, and epidemio-clinical dissimilarities. We, therefore, propose to modify the
nomenclature of the R. conorii species through the creation of subspecies. We propose the names
R. conorii subsp. conorii subsp. nov. (type strain = Malish, ATCC VR-613), R. conorii subspecies indica
subsp. nov. (type strain = ATCC VR-597), R. conorii subspecies caspia subsp. nov. (type strain = A167), and R. conorii subspecies israelensis subsp. nov. (type strain = ISTT CDC1). The description of
R. conorii is emended to accomodate the four subspecies.

Background
Taxonomic classification of members of the order Rickettsiales was originally based on relatively few phenotypic
criteria [1]. Over the past twenty years, the taxonomic classification of the Order Rickettsiales has undergone many
changes. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequences, Coxiella
burnetii was reclassified within the Legionellaceae [2],
Eperythrozoon sp. within the Mycoplasmataceae [3], and
Rochalimaea sp., Grahamella sp., and Bartonella sp. within
the Bartonellaceae, closely related to Brucella sp [4,5].
Among the remaining members of the order Rickettsiales,
the Anaplasma-Ehrlichia clade was recently reorganized
into 4 genera [6]; and R. tsutsugamushi was reclassified
into a new genus, Orientia [7]. Within the genus Rickettsia,
since the pioneering work of Philip in 1978 [8], two rickettsial strains were considered as having different serotypes if they exhibited a specificity difference of ≥ 3 and
some authors have considered this to be a useful guide to
speciation [9,10]. However, opinions divide as to whether
this holds true for rickettsial strains related to Rickettsia
conorii (R. conorii) [11]. These include Indian tick typhus
rickettsia (ITTR) [12], Israeli spotted fever rickettsia (ISFR)
[13-15] and Astrakhan fever rickettsia (AFR) [16-19]. Phylogenetically, these rickettsiae constitute a homogeneous

cluster supported by significant bootstrap values and are
distinct from other Rickettsia species (Figure 1) [20-22].
Some authors have considered these rickettsial strains as
different species and proposed the names R. sharonii and
R. caspii for ISFR and AFR, respectively [23,24]. Other
authors believe that they belong to a "R. conorii complex"
[11,14,15,17,19].
These rickettsiae closely related to R. conorii have been
described as the causative agents of Mediterranean spotted
fever, Astrakhan fever, Israeli spotted fever, and Indian
tick typhus in the Mediterranean basin and Africa, Southern Russia, Middle East, and India, respectively. These
rickettsioses are transmitted to humans by Rhipicephalus
ticks [1]. Furthermore, most of their clinical features overlap and are characterized by a febrile illness and a generalized maculopapular rash. However, an inoculation
eschar is seldom present in Astrakhan fever and Israeli
spotted fever but common in Mediterranean spotted fever
(Table 1).
Recently, we have proposed gene sequence-based criteria
for the identification of Rickettsia isolates at the genus,
group and species levels and proposed criteria to define

species [9]. Using these criteria, we have shown that ITTR,
ISFR and AFR could not be considered as distinct species.
Instead, they belonged to the R. conorii species [9]. However, these rickettsiae exhibit differentiable serotypes and
cause diseases with distinct clinical features in defined
geographic locations. The ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics [25] has proposed that even if related genetically, bacterial isolates
within a given species could be considered as distinct subspecies if they differed phenotypically.
In this study, we undertook to examine whether phenotypic differences existed among various R. conorii isolates
that would enable to classify them as subspecies. We estimated the degree of genotypic variabilities among 31 isolates of R. conorii, 1 isolate of ITTR, 2 isolates and 3 tick
amplicons of AFR, and 2 isolates of ISFR using multi-locus
sequence typing (MLST). We incorporated 16S rDNA and
gltA genes, as well as 3 membrane-exposed protein-encoding genes ompA, ompB and sca4 (formerly gene D) [26,27]
in MLST. To further characterize the specificities of distinct
MLST types, we incorporated a prototype isolate from
each of these into a multi-spacer typing (MST) assay,
which we have previously demonstrated to be more discriminant than MLST at the strain level for R. conorii [28].
Furthermore, mouse serotypes were obtained for each of
these MLST types.

Results
MLST-gene sequencing
All five genes studied were amplified from all 36 studied
isolates and from 3 of 57 Rhipicephalus pumilio ticks tested.
All negative controls remained negative. Four MLST types
were identified. Within the first type, which we named
Malish type, all R. conorii isolates exhibited identical
sequences for each of the five genes tested except isolates
Moroccan and M1. These latter isolates showed deletions
of 24 and 156 bp, respectively, at the 5'-end of the ompA
gene. The second type, the ITTR type, was made of ITTR.
This exhibited unique nucleotide substitutions in ompA,
ompB and sca4 genes. Within the AFR type, all isolates and
tick amplicons tested showed identical sequences of the
five genes studied except the Chad isolate which showed
subtle nucleotide substitutions in each of them. In this
isolate, the pairwise nucleotide similarity with AFR for
16S rDNA, gltA, ompA, ompB and sca4 genes was 99.7,
99.5, 99.5, 99.2, and 99.8 %, respectively. The fourth type,
ISFR type, which included both ISFR isolates, showed the
same nucleotide substitutions in each of the five genes
tested. This differentiated them from other rickettsiae. As
representative strains for each MLST genotype, we have
chosen R. conorii isolate Malish, ITTR isolate Indian, AFR
isolate A-167, and ISFR isolate ISTT CDC1.

Among representatives of the four MLST genotypes, the
degree of pairwise nucleotide similarity ranged from 99.8
% between AFR and ISFR to 100 % between R. conorii and
ITTR for the 16S rDNA gene (Table 3). For gltA, such similarity ranged from 99.5 % between Malish (or ITTR) and

of ompA, the degree of pairwise sequence similarity ranged
from 98.1 between AFR and ITTR to 99.8% between R.
conorii and ITTR. This pairwise similarity ranged from 98.5
between ITTR and ISFR to 99.8% between R. conorii and
ITTR for ompB. For sca4, the pairwise sequence similarity
varied from 99.2 between ITTR and ISFR to 99.9%
between R. conorii and ITTR.
The dendrograms obtained using the three different tree
building analysis methods showed similar organization
for the five rickettsiae studied. We identified two monophyletic groups with the trees so constructed. One
included R. conorii and ITTR and the other, ISFR and AFR
(Figure 2A). The clustering of these rickettsiae was supported by high bootstrap values. Both AFR isolates were
grouped together for each of the five genes tested.
MST genotyping
ITTR showed unique 232-bp dksA / xerC (type P, GenBank
accession number AY836513) and 153-bp mppA / purC
(type F, AY836517) spacer sequences. However, it also
showed a 200-bp rpmE / tRNA-fMet spacer sequence identical to that of R. conorii type B (AY345092); ISFR had
unique 232-bp dksA / xerC (type Q, AY836510), 153-bp
mppA / purC (type G, AY836514), and 200-bp rpmE /
tRNA-fMet (type C, AY836518) spacer sequences; AFR iso-

lates A-167 and Chad showed unique dksA / xerC of 232(type R, AY836511) and 167-bp (type S, AY836512),
respectively. They also showed identical 153-bp mppA /
purC (type H, AY836516) and 200-bp rpmE / tRNA-fMet
(type D, AY836519) spacer sequences that were different
from those of other strains. When combining the genotypes obtained from each of the three spacers into a MST
genotype, each of the four rickettsiae showed a distinct
MST genotype. The MST genotype so obtained was different from that of R. conorii. However, on pairwise comparisons of the four strains, both AFR strains showed similar
spacer types. The phylogenetic tree inferred from the concatenated spacer sequences showed an organization similar to that obtained from MLST when Malish strain was
taken as R. conorii type strain (Figure 2B). However, the
node where ISFR branched was not supported by a significant bootstrap value.
Microimmunofluorescence (MIF) serotyping
When injected into mice, all five rickettsiae tested provoked antibody responses that were detectable by MIF.
The endpoint titers and specificity differences (SPDs) were
calculated as described in the Methods section. These values are presented in Table 4. The antibody titres obtained
in homologous sera were at least one-fold higher than
those observed in heterologous sera. The SPDs for heterologous sera varied between 1 and 5. Four serotypes were
identified. These included R. conorii, ITTR, both AFR isolates, and ISFR. The dendrogram inferred from the matrix
based on SPDs (Figure 2C) showed that ITTR occupied a
position that slightly differed from its phylogenetic organization. Instead of forming a cluster with R. conorii, it
occupied an intermediate position between R. conorii and
ISFR (Figures 2A and 2B).

Discussion
We propose to create subspecies within the R. conorii species to accommodate both the genotypic homogeneity
and the serotypic, MST genotypic, geographic and pathogenic diversities of rickettsia strains within this species.
Defining a species within the Rickettsia genus has long
been difficult but rickettsiologists have agreed to use
mouse serotyping as one criterion [8]. This classification
scheme served as a basis for the development of genotypic
criteria at the species level [9]. However, confusion still
exists about the taxonomic status of rickettsiae. This is
especially the case for rickettsiae which are closely related
to classic R. conorii isolates. Philip et al. [8], using mouse
serotyping, have demonstrated that R. conorii isolates Malish, Moroccan and Kenya were closely related antigenically to ITTR and that they belonged to a single serotype.
Using complement fixation, Bozeman et al. [29] were unable to distinguish ITTR from R. conorii isolates. In contrast,
others, using mouse polyclonal antibodies [14], and

monoclonal antibodies [11], have demonstrated substantial differences between ITTR and R. conorii isolates. ISFR
and AFR could not be distinguished using PCR-RFLP [17]
until ompA was used as target gene [30]. In 1993, we have
demonstrated that AFR differed from both ISFR and R.
conorii in terms of SDS-PAGE mobility and PFGE profiles
[19]. Although they are difficult to distinguish serologi-

cally, the cross-reacting epitopes they share are located on
antigenic proteins that differ in SDS-PAGE mobility and
hence in molecular weight [19]. In 1995, Walker et al.,
using serotyping, Western bloting, monoclonal antibody
reactivity and PCR amplification of the tandem repeats
within ompA, concluded that ISFR belonged to the R.
conorii species [15]. In 1998, Dasch and Jackson differen-

tiated R. conorii from ISFR using PCR-RFLP [23]. Recently,
using a combination of genotypic criteria, we have demonstrated that the genotypic differences among ITTR, AFR
and ISFR were too subtle to classify them as new species
[9]. Instead, they belonged to the R. conorii species.
In the present study, we have demonstrated, using MLST,
that rickettsiae closely related to R. conorii isolate Malish
are very homogeneous. Except isolates Moroccan and M1
which showed one ompA deletion of 24 and 156 bp,
respectively, all studied R. conorii isolates had identical
sequences for the five genes studied and thus constituted
a reliable taxon. The ITTR isolate showed unique
sequences of ompA, ompB and sca4 genes. Among isolates
and tick amplicons of AFR, the degree of MLST sequence
similarity was of 100% except for the Chad isolate which
is genotypically slightly different from AFR isolate A-167
[31]. In another study, we have found identical ompA
sequences in four tick amplicons from Kosovo and AFR
isolate A-167 [32]. We have also observed serologic, antigenic and genetic homogeneities among two tick and one
human AFR isolates from Astrakhan [19]. Thus, except the
Chad isolate which was slightly different genotypically,
AFR, with three strains and ten tick amplicons studied,
appeared to form a homogeneous taxon. The two isolates
of ISFR tested showed 100% pairwise nucleotide similarity in all five genes studied. As we have compared only two
isolates, one may argue that this may not be representative
of the diversity of ompA in ISFR. However, Walker et al.
found four human ISFR isolates from Israel to be highly
homogeneous antigenically as well as genetically [15].
Bacellar et al. described three human isolates of ISFR from
Portugal that showed 100% similarity in 16S rDNA, gltA
and ompA sequence with those of ISFR isolate ISTTCDC1
[33]. Giammanco et al. identified a tick rickettsial isolate
in Italy that had 100% ompA sequence similarity with ISFR
isolate ISTTCDC1 [34]. Therefore, it appeared that our
ISFR isolates were representatives of the same homogeneous taxon.

In the first part of the study, we have identified four MLST
genotypes which were subjected to further evaluation.
Among representatives of these MLST genotypes, the minimal pairwise similarity in the nucleotide sequences of
16S rDNA, gltA, ompA, ompB, and sca4 genes between the
rickettsial isolates tested and R. conorii, was 99.8%, 99.4%,
98.3%, 98.5%, and 99.3%, respectively. Thus, All four
isolates tested fulfilled the criteria to belong to the R.
conorii species [9].
Phylogenetically, the members of the R. conorii complex
have been demonstrated to form a stable group distinct
from other Rickettsia species (Figure 1) [20-22]. We found
that within this cluster they consistently formed two phylogenetic clusters (Figure 2A). One of these clusters
included R. conorii and ITTR, and the other, AFR isolates
and ISFR. Using MST, we identified five genotypes. However, using pairwise comparison of spacer sequences, we
identified only four genotypes similar to those obtained
by MLST. MST-based phylogeny also demonstrated a similar pattern (Figure 2B). Serotypically, we could identify
four serotypes which, according to the definition of species proposed by Philip [8], would classify them as different species: 1) R. conorii isolate Malish; 2) ITTR; 3) AFR;
and 4) ISFR. These four serotypes also showed distinct
MST genotypes.
We demonstrated a discrepancy between the genotypic
homogeneity of these rickettsiae, which classified them
within the R. conorii species [9], and their MST genotypic,
serotypic, geographic, and pathogenic heterogeneity. For
ITTR, an additional discrepancy was observed between its
phylogenetic and serotypic classifications (Figures 2A and
2B versus 2C). Such findings are in accordance with those
of Walker et al. who had shown substantial differences
between ITTR and R. conorii isolates [11]. We also agree
with these authors who hypothesized that all members of
the "so-called" R. conorii complex belonged to the R.
conorii species [15].

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that R. conorii and closely related
strains exhibit a high level of conservation in nucleotide
sequence despite genotypic specificities, and phenotypic
specificities including serotyping, epidemiological and
clinical characteristics. Therefore, according to the
accepted criteria of the ad hoc committee on reconciliation
of approaches to bacterial systematics which allow the creation of subspecies for genetically-close isolates which
express phenotypic differences [25], we are justified in creating new subspecies for these organisms.
Emendation of the description of Rickettsia conorii
Rickettsia conorii (Brumpt 1932). The characteristics of this
taxon are similar to those described by Weiss and Moulder
for the species [1]. The species contains four subspecies.
The minimal degree of pairwise nucleotide similarity of
the R. conorii species is of 99.8 % for 16S rDNA, 99.4 % for
gltA, 98.3 % for the 5' end of ompA, 98.6 % for ompB, and
99.3 % for sca4, by comparison with isolate Malish.
Description of Rickettsia conorii subsp. conorii subsp.
nov
Rickettsia conorii subsp. conorii (co.no'ri.i N. L. gen. n.
conorii, of Conor, in honor of A. Conor who, in collaboration with A. Bruch, provided the first description of fièvre
boutonneuse in 1910 [35]). The characteristics are the
same as those of the species. Transmitted to humans
through the bite of Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Grows
in Vero cells at 32°C in antibiotic-free Minimal Essential

subsp. nov., isolate A-167. R. conorii subsp. caspia subsp
nov isolate A-167 has been deposited in the official collections of the WHO Collaborative Center for the Diagnosis
and Study of Rickettsioses in Marseille, France, and of the
WHO Collaborating Reference Center for Rickettsial and
Bartonella-associated Diseases, CDC, Atlanta, USA.
Description of Rickettsia conorii subsp. israelensis subsp.
nov
Rickettsia conorii subsp. israelensis (is.ra. el en' sis. N. L. gen.
n. israelensis, from Israel, where the Rhipicephalus sanguineus tick providing the first isolate was collected). The
characteristics are the same as those of the species. Transmitted to humans through the bite of Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Grows in Vero cells at 32°C in antibiotic-free
Minimal Essential Medium supplemented with 2 % fetal
calf serum and 2 mg/ml L-glutamine.

The type strain is ISTTCDC1, which was isolated from a
Rhipicephalus sanguineus tick collected in Israel in 1974.
The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA, gltA, ompA,
ompB, sca4 genes have been deposited in the GenBank
database under the accession numbers L36223 [36],
U59727 [37], U43797 [30], AF123712 [22], and
AF155058 [20], respectively. To be classified as R. conorii
subsp. israelensis subsp. nov., a rickettsial isolate should
exhibit a minimal pairwise nucleotide sequence similarity
of 100%, 99.7%, 98.9%, 99.5%, and 99.8%, for the 16S
rDNA, gltA, ompA, ompB, and sca4 genes, respectively, with
those of R. conorii subsp. israelensis subsp. nov., isolate
ISTTCDC1. R. conorii subsp. israelensis subsp. Nov. isolate
ISTTCDC1 has been deposited in the official collections of
the WHO Collaborative Center for the Diagnosis and
Study of Rickettsioses in Marseille, France, and of the
WHO Collaborating Reference Center for Rickettsial and
Bartonella-associated Diseases, CDC, Atlanta, USA.

Methods
Rickettsial strains
All rickettsial strains tested and their original sources are
listed in Table 2. Rickettsial isolates for which sequences
were not available were grown in Vero cell monolayers at
32°C in 150 cm2-cell culture flasks as previously
described [37]. When Gimenez staining demonstrated the
cells have been infected heavily, they were harvested using
sterile glass beads and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min,
resuspended in fresh medium and stored at -70°C until
purification of nucleic acid was carried out. All rickettsial
stocks were tested and shown to be free of Mycoplasma sp
using a 16S rDNA-based PCR assay as previously
described [38].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/11

Nucleic acid purification, PCR amplification and
sequencing
When available, we used gene sequences present in GenBank. The accession numbers for these sequences are
reported at the end of the manuscript. Missing sequences
were obtained in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted
from 200 µl of rickettsial suspension and from 57 Rhipicephalus pumilio ticks collected in Astrakhan [19] using the
QIAamp Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. For MLST, we used the
previously described primers and PCR conditions to
amplify 1,424-bp, 1,134-bp, 590-bp, 4,890-bp, and
3,028-bp fragments of the 16S rDNA [36], gltA [37], ompA
[30], ompB [22] and sca4 [20] genes, respectively, of 29 of
36 rickettsial isolates tested for which no sequences were
available in GenBank, and 57 R. pumilio ticks. In addition,
we amplified and sequenced the ompB and sca4 genes of
AFR isolate Chad which had not been determined
previously. Primers were purchased from Eurogentec
(Seraing, Belgium). PCR reactions were carried out in a
Peltier model PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research,
Watertown, MA). Each PCR included a negative (distilled
water) and a positive control (DNA extracted from R. montanensis isolate 2–4–6 using the QIAamp Tissue Kit
[Qiagen]). PCR products were visualized after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Each amplicon was purified
for sequencing using the QIAquick Spin PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Sequencing reactions were carried out using PCR primers
and the D-rhodamine terminator cycle DNA sequencing
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) according to the manufacturer' instructions. Sequencing reaction
products were resolved by electrophoresis with an ABI
Prism 3100 Automated Sequencer (Applied Bioystems).
Each base position was established twice in both the forward and reverse directions.

For each gene, the pairwise sequence similarity among
studied isolates and tick amplicons was estimated using
the multisequence alignment program CLUSTAL W [39].
Each isolate or tick amplicon exhibiting specific nucleotide substitutions within one or more of the five genes
studied was considered a different MLST genotype. Then,
we selected a representative isolate of each MLST genotype
for further tests. When a MLST genotype incorporated
more than one isolate, we selected the type strain or the
first strain described in the literature as representative
strain. In addition to AFR isolate A-167, we incorporated
AFR isolate Chad in the phylogenetic study and the mouse
immunization and MST assays because MLST sequence
differences between both isolates were due to nucleotide
substitutions as well as deletions.
Distance matrices generated by DNADIST were determined under the assumptions of Kimura and were used to

infer dendrograms by the neighbor-joining method [40]
using the PHYLIP version 3.4 software package [41]. Dendrograms were also constructed by data processing with
the maximum-likehood and parsimony methods
(DNAML and DNAPARS, respectively, in PHYLIP). A
bootstrap analysis based on 100 randomly generated trees
using SEQBOOT and CONSENSE in PHYLIP was performed to estimate the node reliability of the trees
obtained by three phylogenetic methods [42].
Multi-spacer typing (MST)
We amplified and sequenced the dksA / xerC, mppA / purC,
and rpmE / tRNA-fMet intergenic spacers for each of R.
conorii isolate Malish, ITTR, ISFR, and AFR isolates A-167
and Chad. Primers and methods were those described previously [28]. Subsequently, spacer sequences were concatenated and used to infer the phylogenetic relationships
among strains tested using the neighbor-joining method
[40] as described above.
Mouse immunization
For each R. conorii isolate Malish, ITTR, ISFR, and AFR isolates A-167 and Chad, five BALB/c mice were inoculated
intravenously (tail vein) with purified bacterial suspension (0.1 ml containing 104 bacteria). The concentration
of rickettsial suspensions was estimated using a plaque
assay as previously described [43]. On day 7, mice were
boosted with a similar inoculum. On day 10, mice were
anesthetized and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture [8].
Sera from each group of five mice were pooled and stored
at -20°C until used for microimmunofluorescence (MIF)
serotyping.
MIF serotyping
The MIF test was performed and the SPD was calculated
using the method of Philip et al. [8]. Each of the five rickettsiae tested was compared with each other. The highest
serum dilutions giving positive reactions were recorded as
endpoint titer: SPD = (Aa + Bb) - (Ab + Ba), where Aa or
Bb is -log2 of the endpoint titer between serum A or B and
homologous antigen a or b and Ab or Ba is -log2 of the
endpoint titer of serum A or B against heterologous antigen b or a. If the SPD was less than 3, the two isolates were
assumed to belong to the same serotype. If the SPD was ≥
3, the isolates were assumed to belong to different serotypes. The SPDs were used to construct a matrix, and then
a dendrogram was constructed from the matrix by the
unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean
(UPGMA) available in the MEGA2 software package [44].
