Abstract
Background: The observed correlation between ultraviolet light incidence and skin color,
together with the geographical apportionment of skin reflectance among human populations,
suggests an adaptive value for the pigmentation of the human skin. We have used Affymetrix U133a
v2.0 gene expression microarrays to investigate the expression profiles of a total of 9 melanocyte
cell lines (5 from lightly pigmented donors and 4 from darkly pigmented donors) plus their
respective unirradiated controls. In order to reveal signatures of selection in loci with a bearing on
skin pigmentation in humans, we have resequenced between 4 to 5 kb of the proximal regulatory
regions of three of the most differently expressed genes, in the expectation that variation at
regulatory regions might account for intraespecific morphological diversity, as suggested
elsewhere.
Results: Contrary to our expectations, expression profiles did not cluster the cells into
unirradiated versus irradiated melanocytes, or into lightly pigmented versus darkly pigmented
melanocytes. Instead, expression profiles correlated with the presence of Bovine Pituitary Extract
(known to contain α-MSH) in the media. This allowed us to differentiate between melanocytes that
are synthesizing melanin and those that are not. TYR, TYRP1 and DCT were among the five most
differently expressed genes between these two groups. Population genetic analyses of sequence
haplotypes of the proximal regulatory flanking-regions included Tajima's D, HEW and DHEW
neutrality tests analysis. These were complemented with EHH tests (among others) in which the
significance was obtained by a novel approach using extensive simulations under the coalescent
model with recombination. We observe strong evidence for positive selection for TYRP1 alleles in

Africans and for DCT and TYRP1 in Asians. However, the overall picture reflects a complex pattern
of selection, which might include overdominance for DCT in Europeans.
Conclusion: Diversity patterns clearly evidence adaptive selection in pigmentation genes in
Africans and Asians. In Europeans, the evidence is more complex, and both directional and
balancing selection may be involved in light skin. As a result, different non-African populations may
have acquired light skin by alternative ways, and so light skin, and perhaps dark skin too, may be
the result of convergent evolution.

Background
The pigmentation of the human skin is the result of a
complex process by which the pigmentary biopolymer,
melanin, is produced and packed in the melanosome (a
specialized organelle of melanocytes) and is distributed to
the surrounding epidermal keratynocytes. Based mainly
on the study of mouse mutants, a description has been
made of over 100 loci that are involved in the pigmentary
phenotype [1].
Although a lot of work has been done on the biochemistry
and cytology of pigmentation, the evolutionary genetic
history of this phenotypic trait has been less investigated.
Initially, the observed correlation between ultraviolet
radiation (UVR) and skin color [2], together with the geographical apportionment of skin reflectance among
human populations in the major continental regions [3],
suggest that the evolution of human skin pigmentation
has been adaptive. Early evolutionary studies focused on
MC1R diversity [4,5]. Although both these works
observed a depletion of variability in Africans in comparison to Europeans and Asians, which was explained by
purifying selection in Africans, the interpretation for the
enhanced Euro-Asiatic diversity was different. Thus, while
[4] claimed that diversifying selection has been responsible
for the high diversity found in Eurasians, [5] invoked functional relaxation, and therefore neutral evolution, for this
locus outside Africa. Phylogenetic comparison of MC1R
primate sequences by [6] indicated that MC1R has been
subject to purifying selection.
Other genes have been associated with the pigmentary
phenotype, such as the P locus (OCA2) [7], MATP (alias
AIM1, SLC45A2) [8] or ASIP [9,10]. More recently, it has
been suggested that different genes may be responsible for
the light pigmentary phenotypes observed in different
non-African populations. Accordingly, a derived allele in
a SNP within SLC24A5 correlates with lighter skin in
Europeans, but not with light skin in East Asians [11].
Additional support for this point came from the work by
[12], who used public SNP databases to single out DCT as
a pigmentation gene candidate for recent positive selection in the Chinese only. In addition, [13] found that
while ASIP and OCA2 might play a shared role in shaping
light and dark pigmentation across the globe, genes like

SLC24A5, MATP and TYR may have had a predominant
role in the evolution of light skin in Europeans but not in
East Asians. According to the authors, this provides compelling evidence that light skin has evolved independently
in European and East Asian populations. Other genomewide scans for genes under recent positive selection from
ascertained SNPs claimed several pigmentation genes
(OCA2, MYO5A, DTNBP1 and TYRP) as candidates for
adaptive selection in Europeans only [14], whereas [15]
suggested that protection against the damaging effects of
UVR might hold an adaptive value in Africans.
However, most of the genetics of pigmentation is based
on the mouse as a model organism. In contrast to
humans, melanocytes in adult murine skin are generally
confined mainly to hair follicles (also to the external ear
and tail) [16]. It is therefore likely that some of the pigmentation genetics learnt from mice may not be directly
applicable to humans. In this context, we have used
Affymetrix U133A 2.0 microarray analysis to investigate
the gene expression profiles of different human melanocyte cell lines. This is expected to provide us with a list of
loci involved in human skin pigmentation, which can be
used as candidate loci for evolutionary inference. Taking
these results into account, we have resequenced between
4 to 5 kb of the proximal regulatory regions of three genes
of interest, namely, TYR, TYRP1 and DCT. These genes
form a homogeneous unit, as they belong to the same
family and coordinate the production of melanin from
tyrosine. Thus, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis
is tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) (the product of TYR), which
catalyses the conversion of tyrosine into dopaquinone
[17]. Tyrosinase activity is required for the synthesis of
two types of melanins, pheomelanins (red to yellow melanins) or the more photoprotective eumelanins (brown to
black melanins). Pheomelanogenesis seems to be the
default pathway in the absence of MC1R signaling, with
low tyrosinase activity and a high concentration of
cysteine. Instead, eumelanin synthesis requires α-MSH
binding to MC1R [18,19], which transcriptionally activates tyrosinase and upregulates tyrosinase-related protein-1 (EC 1.14.18, the product of TYRP1) and
DOPAchrome tautomerase (EC 5.3.2.3; the product of the
DCT locus, formerly TYRP2 or TRP-2). Other genes like
ASP, the α-MSH antagonist, slightly reduce tyrosinase

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:74

activity and produce an almost complete loss of TYRP1
and DCT expression, thereby decreasing eumelanin synthesis [20].
We have focused on the proximal regulatory region, as it
has been proposed that variation at regulatory regions
may account for intraespecific morphological diversity
[21-25]. We therefore resequenced 116 human chromosomes from diverse geographical origin, including Africans, Europeans (plus European melanoma patients),
Asians and Australian Aborigines, in search of diversity
patterns that could help us reconstruct the evolutionary
history of human skin pigmentation.

Results and discussion
Microarray experiments
Affymetrix U133a v2.0 microarrays were used to analyze
five melanocyte cell lines from lightly pigmented donors
and four from darkly pigmented donors, plus their respective unirradiated controls. Two additional cell lines from
darkly pigmented donors did not yield RNA of sufficient
quality for reverse transcription.

The first eigenvector for the SAM Pattern Discovery (unsupervised) analysis identified 5,404 probes as differentially
expressed at an FDR of 4.65% (see Additional file 1).
Unexpectedly, expression values did not cluster the cells
into unirradiated versus irradiated melanocytes, or into
lightly pigmented versus darkly pigmented melanocytes.
Instead, we observed a differentiation between the M1
and M4 cells on the one hand (M1: lightly pigmented
donor, irradiated and unirradiated; M4: darkly pigmented
donor, irradiated and unirradiated), and the rest of the
cell lines on the other. One possible explanation points to
the different growth media used. However, a precise comparison of the media is difficult because providers do not
always disclose the detailed formulation of the commercial media. With the information available, we can speculate on the absence of melanocyte mitogens BPE and/or
PMA in the M1 and M4 cell cultures as a possible explanation. Both PMA and BPE could be boosting proliferation
and melanogenesis in the "rest of the cells" group. In fact,
both M1 and M4 proved to be very slow growing. In this
regard, BPE usually contains α-MSH, which is a strong
stimulator of melanogenesis. It has been shown that the
induced release of α-MSH by UV light-irradiated keratinocytes (and to a much lesser extent, by irradiated melanocytes also) stimulates melanogenesis [26]. Along these
lines, [27] reported also that human melanocytes cultured
in media containing BPE do not respond to increasing
concentrations of α-MSH, whereas the removal of BPE
resulted in a significant reduction in melanocyte proliferation and melanogenesis, but restored responsiveness to
melanotropins. However, for microarray experiments, the
difficulty in growing melanocyte cultures without BPE

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/74

may hamper the obtaining of the high cell numbers
required. To confirm the effect of the presence/absence of
BPE on the expression profiles of TYR, TYRP1 and DCT,
we quantified by qPCR (see Material and Methods, Quantitative PCR section) the expression levels of these genes in
one cell line that was grown in (a) Cascade growth
medium 254 supplemented with 1% HGMS (includes
BPE) vs. the same cell line grown in (b) Cascade medium
plus PromoCell Supplement (no BPE). In this case all
three genes suffered a reduction in their expression levels
when grown under the second conditions (normalized
ratios (conditions b)/(conditions a) TYR: 0.44 ± 0.09,
TYRP1: 0.27 ± 0.05 and DCT: 0.05 ± 0.01) (3 replicates).
We also investigated the effect of adding a known amount
of BPE to the medium and thus we compared the expression levels of these when cell were grown in (c) PromoCell growth medium plus PromoCell Supplement vs. (d)
PromoCell growth medium plus PromoCell Supplement
and 0.2% (v/v) of a 13 mg/ml solution of BPE. Addition
of BPE led to an increase of the expression level of all three
genes (normalized ratios (conditions d)/(conditions c)
TYR: 1.5 ± 0.22, TYRP1: 1.96 ± 0.26 and DCT: 1.93 ± 0.74)
(2 replicates). These results indicate that in melanocytes,
BPE has a biological effect on the expression of, at least,
TYR, TYRP1 and DCT.
In any case, the homogeneity found in the gene expression profiles of human melanocytes grown in BSE-containing media suggests that melanocytes from both light
and dark pigmentation donors may have the same genetic
ability to produce melanin if subject to the same level of
external (paracrine) signaling molecules, at least above a
certain concentration.
Interestingly enough, however, Gene Ontology analysis of
differentially expressed genes between these two groups
indicates that the term "melanin biosynthesis from tyrosine" is a significant, non-redundant, "biological process"
term (FDR p-value 0.0197). Genes belonging to this biological term are overexpressed in the "rest of the cells"
group. Among the top over-expressed probes we can find
those corresponding to MLAN-A, TYR, TYRP1, DCT,
GPR143, S100B, OCA2, SILV or SOX10, and further down
the list, MITF, PAX3, KIT or SLC45A2 (MATP), genes
known for their involvement in melanocyte function and
development. MC1R is further down the list, but still
shows an average log2 difference in gene expression of
over 3 (overexpressed in the "rest of the cells" group).
Rather unexpectedly, SLC24A5, a gene recently claimed as
a major pigmentation gene in humans [11], does not
appear in this list. Nevertheless, this list provides a good
collection of candidate loci for further diversity analysis in
human populations from which to obtain evolutionary
inferences. Non-redundant GO terms (Biological processes) over-presented in the M1 and M4 cells group

p-value 3.2e-2), metal ion transport (FDR p-value 3.3e-2)
and protein metabolism (FDR p-value 3.8e-2).
Based on this information, we decided to resequence the
proximal regulatory regions of the melanogenic loci TYR,
TYRP1 and DCT in search of evidence for selection on
these genes. It is expected that resequencing, rather than
typing previously ascertained SNPs, will provide unbiased
information that will help us to more faithfully reconstruct the evolutionary history of these pigmentation loci.
Population diversity and neutrality tests from sequence
data
In the approximately 4 kb of the TYR upstream genomic
region resequenced we have detected 20 SNPs in the global sample of 116 chromosomes. We have also detected
two polymorphisms derived from runs of Ts at
chr11:88548969 and chr11:88550172, one GA microsatellite between chr11:88549822.88550079, one polymorphic Alu insertion at chr11:88548585, which seems to
belong to the Ya5 family, and three polymorphic indels,
one of them involving 4 bp and two involving 2 bp. None
of these non-SNP polymorphisms was considered for the
diversity analysis, partly because of their different mutational nature to SNPs and partly because of the intrinsic
difficulty in sequencing through some of these regions.
Out of the above 20 SNPs, one falls within a putative
CAAT box located about 200 bp upstream the translation
initiation codon. None of them falls within other known
cis-regulatory regions [23]. These polymorphisms assemble into 29 different haplotypes, whose genealogical relationships are shown in Figure 1.

In the approximately 5 kb of the TYRP1 upstream
genomic region resequenced we have detected 29 SNPs.
Polymorphisms derived from a run of Ts at
chr9:12679614 and from a run of As at chr9:12680664 as
well as a polymorphic rearrangement involving a 18 bp
insertion found at chr9:12683765, were not considered in
the analysis for the same reasons as above. None of the 29
SNPs fell within known cis-regulatory regions [23]. These
polymorphisms assemble into 32 different haplotypes,

most likely falls two mutational steps away from AU1A.

whose genealogical relationships are shown in Figure 1.
Haplotype frequencies and genotypes are available as supplementary material (see Additional file 2)
For the 4.1 kb region upstream from DCT, we have
detected a total of 9 SNPs plus one indel (involving 1 bp),
which was not considered for the sequence analysis for
the same reasons as above. None of the SNPs falls within
the known cis-regulatory regions located in the approximately 500 bp upstream of the transcription initiation
point [23,28]. These polymorphisms assemble into 15
different haplotypes, whose genealogical relationships are
shown in Figure 1.
Detected SNPs and indels have been submitted to dbSNP
and will be publicly available in Build 130 (see Additional
file 3).

After removing polymorphic positions, we estimated the
divergence between a chimp sequence and the human
sequence. The estimated divergence for DCT was 0.01
(95% C.I. 0.0074–0.0136); 0.0104 (95% C.I.
0.0075–0.0134) for TYRP1 and 0.0152 (95% C.I.
0.0114–0.0198) for TYR. These values fall within normal
average neutral values [29] and suggest that no substantial
evolutionary acceleration has occurred in these genomic
regions since the human-chimp split.
Diversity measures for all samples are summarized in
Table 1. Overall, both DCT and TYRP1 show higher haplotype diversity in the African populations analyzed,
whereas TYR shows similar levels of haplotype diversity
across populations.

Among the non-African populations, the Chinese sample
shows a substantial drop in diversity for both DCT and
TYRP1. This drop in diversity is accompanied by significantly negative Tajima's D values for both DCT and
TYRP1, although these values become non-significant
after multiple-test correction (data not shown). DHEW
and HEW tests are also significant for DCT in the Chinese
(even after multiple-test correction, at an FDR of 8% and
6%, respectively) (Table 1). These results suggest possible
positive selection acting on alleles of these loci in the Chinese, in particular for DCT.
The European samples, however, show positive (although
non-significant) Tajima's D values for DCT and TYRP1.
Excluding population structure, which is unlikely to be
substantial in our European sample, positive Tajima's D
values can be obtained when some kind of diversityincreasing selection is operating [30]. Analysis of the HapMap data confirms the existence of SNPs (like rs9301959,
rs7990565 or rs4773797) with higher than expected heterozygosity (p < 0.01) in the extended DCT region in Caucasians. This observation is compatible with selection by
overdominance. Europeans and European melanoma
patients show some evidence for selection at TYRP1 (HEW
test, see Table 1), but this is not significant after multipletest correction. Caucasians share their major TYRP1 haplotypes, AU1A and AU3B, with Australian Aborigines. The
AU1A allele seems to pre-date the out-of-Africa expansion, since all African and non-African populations analyzed also share this haplotype. This suggests that this
haplotype has little to do with pigmentation differences
across populations. As regards AU3B, the recent claim that
aboriginal Australians descend from the same African
emigrant group as all other Eurasians [31] suggests an age
for this shared allele of at least 50,000–70,000 years.
Thus, despite the relatively high frequency of AU3B in
Europeans, given the pigmentary differences between
Australian Aborigines and Europeans and the lack of
strong evidence for selection in them, it seems unlikely
that this haplotype is associated with a light skin phenotype, at least in a simple way. In Europeans, only TYR
shows some evidence for selection but only for the HEW
test (significant after multiple-test correction at an FDR of
6%). This is most likely due to the fact that HEW is more
powerful than DHEW in detecting ongoing or recently
completed selective sweeps [32]. The contrasting patterns
between Tajima's D and HEW in TYR might indicate a partial sweep at this locus in the European (healthy) sample.
This signature is not observed however in the sample of
European melanoma patients. Interestingly, European
melanoma patients show a frequency for AU4B that is
markedly lower than that for healthy Europeans (Fischer's
exact test p-value: 0.0025). However, this observation
should be considered only as exploratory, as it is not our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/74

purpose in this work to conduct a formal test of association to melanoma.
For the African populations analyzed (Pygmies and Senegalese, both dark-skinned populations), the networks
observed in Figure 1 suggest that the main factor responsible for the lack of strong negative Tajima's D values in
the Pygmy sample is population structure. In fact, our
Pygmy sample is composed of both Biaka and Mbuti Pygmies, who have been described as "substantially different
genetically" [33]. This observation can explain the positive Tajima's D values found for the Pygmy sample [34].
In contrast, the Senegalese record a highly significant negative Tajima's D value for TYRP1 (significant even after
multiple-test correction, at an FDR value of 5%), which is
suggestive of selection. The observation that neither
DHEW nor HEW are significant for the African populations (Table 1) is however consistent, as DHEW and HEW
are expected to have much less power than Tajima's D to
detect selection after fixation of the advantageous allele
when ρ is no greater than θ [32], which is the case for the
Senegalese TYRP1 diversity. It may be argued that the simulation parameters inferred from the Yoruba are not
applicable to other African populations. In an attempt to
offset the effects of a possible population expansion on
Tajima's D p-value observed for the Senegalese, and in the
absence of a precise demographic model for this population, we have run further simulations assuming for the
Senegalese the demographic model used previously for
the Europeans. This is expected to provide a reasonably
conservative correction. Under this demographic scenario, the p-value for Tajima's D in the Senegalese is
approximately 0.027. Thus, we are inclined to believe that
the negative Tajima's D in the case of the Senegalese
TYRP1 diversity reflects the signature of an old selective
process.
Lastly, the lack of signal in Australian Aborigines can be
explained by the effect of drift: if the population that left
Africa and colonized Australia was relatively small and relatively constant, whereby the effect of drift overcame the
effect of selective pressure, then this signal of selection
may have been lost.
Other Selection tests based on the HapMap project data
In order to detect selection in more recent evolutionary
time windows [35], we have used the SNP frequency
information available in the HapMap dataset to perform,
firstly, a scan for SNPs with significant pairwise FST values
across these loci, and secondly, a search for longer than
expected haplotypes within populations by means of the
EHH test [36] (see also Material and Methods).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/74

FST comparison is useful for detecting selection in a time
window of less than 50,000 to 75,000 years [35]. After
multiple-test correction, several SNPs were found to be
positive across DCT and TYRP1 (including the flanking
regions) for the HapMap Chinese+Japanese vs. HapMap
Caucasians pairwise comparison (Table 2). Overall, our
results agree with those by [12], although in our case,
multiple-test correction makes non-significant additional
pairwise comparisons that [12] found significant for their
uncorrected FST tests.
EHH tests can be useful to detect signatures of partial
selective sweeps in a time window of less than 30,000
years [35]. We observed haplotypes with longer than
expected EHH in the HapMap Chinese+Japanese sample
for DCT and TYRP1, and in the HapMap Yoruba for
TYRP1 (Table 3, Figure 2).
Using a different long-range haplotype statistic for DCT,
[12] suggested the existence of a core SNP at rs2031526
whose bidirectional breakdown of haplotype homozygosity of the derived allele "A" evidenced selection. Our EHH
approach (see Material and Methods), however, did not
identify this SNP as a strong candidate core, perhaps
because our procedure to declare significance (see Material and Method) is more stringent than that used by [12].
Instead, our DCT core haplotype "TCA", which is located
around 11 kb upstream from rs2031526, overlapping an

intronic conserved region in mammals, actually identifies
a subset of the rs2031526 "A" haplogroup.
The core SNPs for TYRP1 HapMap Yoruba fall within a
conserved region (77% identity with the mouse orthologous sequence) that contains at least one potential transcription factor binding site for SOX10 (a known
melanogenesis enhancer) and is placed less than 5 kb
upstream of a putative TYRP1 enhancer sequence [37].
The relatively low frequencies of DCT core haplotype
"TCA" in the Chinese+Japanese and of TYRP1 core haplotype "TGA" in the Yoruba (Table 3) suggest that we are
detecting the signature of selection in young haplogroups
only. EHH is expected to fail to detect the signature of
selection in older haplotypes because of the decay of LD
with time. However, at least in the case of TYRP1, the fact
that both Tajima's D and EHH detect selection may indicate that the environmental pressure was probably old,
and either continued to act for some time after the origin
of this "TGA" allele and then ceased or is still ongoing.
Finally, the core SNPs for TYRP1 in the HapMap Chinese+Japanese fall astride a LTR (MER52A, family ERV1)
and a LINE (L1MA2) element, around 15 kb upstream
from the aforementioned core SNPs for TYRP1 in the
HapMap Yoruba. Complete homozygosity for a core haplogroup "AA" extends well into the 5'-flanking region of
the gene, and seems to constitute a major subset of allele

AU1A. Its high frequency (see table 3) and long EHH correlates with the (weak) signal of selection detected by
Tajima's D in the Chinese TYRP1 sequence diversity.
The proximity of the two core haplotypes for TYRP1
observed in two different populations, in combination
with the long EHH that extends into the flanking region
of the locus, and the evidence for selection on these two
populations from the Tajima's D test, point to a region
distally upstream of TYRP1 as the target region for selection on TYRP1 diversity.

Conclusion
It is well-established that dark skin is photoprotective (see
[38] and references therein), but whether this photoprotective role represents an evolutionary advantage is less
clear. Alternative mechanisms to explain a possible adaptive advantage of dark pigmentation involve concealment
[39] or the protection of folate from UVR-induced photolysis [40]. However, in the light of the apparent vagaries
that occur in the pigmentation of mammalian skin,
including primates, others [41] suggest that dark skin may
have outlived its usefulness. Selective mechanisms for
light skin involve the facilitation of vitamin D3 synthesis
[40].

After scanning the HapMap data with Sweep (see Methods)
candidate core haplotypes were tested for the significance of
their extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH). Circles represent the observed EHH values extending about 50 kb from

the intervening lines represent the introns. The arrows indicate the direction of transcription. a) EHH for DCT in the
HapMap Chinese+Japanese population; b) EHH for TYRP1 in
the HapMap Chinese+Japanese population and c) EHH for
TYRP1 in the HapMap Yoruba population.

The ability to detect selection from diversity patterns
depends on many aspects, such as the demography of the
population under study, the mutation and recombination
rates of the locus, the dominance and selection coefficients of the advantageous allele, whether the advantageous allele has reached fixation (and how long ago) or
not, and whether the favorable allele arose from a single
mutation at the time of the selective pressure or was
favored from standing variation [42]. Thus, we have used
a battery of different tests to enhance the ability to detect
selection, and we have been able to show the signature of
directional selection particularly on TYRP1 in Africans,
and on DCT and TYRP1 in Asians. We should bear in
mind that the constitutive pigmentation of the skin is not
exclusively dependent on melanin production. Other factors, such as the distribution of melanins within melanosomes, the melanosome secretion rate by melanocytes,
the rate of melanosome ingestion by keratynocytes and
the distribution of melanosomes within keratynocytes,
are also major determinants of skin pigmentation ([43]
and references therein). The question of how these mechanisms can be functionally linked to the observed diversity patterns in the melanogenic loci studiedcannot be
answered with the present data. However, the observed
patterns of diversity do seem to support the idea that
selection has had a role in the evolutionary history of melanogenesis.

b Between

As regards the nature of selection, the resequencing analysis did not detect any polymorphism in the known proximal regulatory-elements that could be associated with
pigmentary differences. However, judging by the localization of the core SNPs identified by the EHH tests it seems
likely that, at least in the case of TYRP1, distal regulatory
regions (see [37]) are the targets of selection. Selection at
the level of gene expression for TYRP1 would be compatible with the observation that the most darkly pigmented
individuals seem to have more TYRP1 protein per
melanocyte, which has been claimed to be at least partly
responsible for the greater tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis reported for dark skin [44]. In addition, it seems
likely that non-directional selection is acting too. For
instance, overdominance seems compatible with the
diversity patterns observed for DCT in Europeans. Similarly, the high frequency of the ancestral TYR haplotype
within the Senegalese suggests that purifying selection at
this locus may have been of some importance within
Africa, although the large number of TYR mutations associated with oculocutaneous albinism 1 (OCA1)
(OMIM#230100) suggest that TYR may be a gene under
purifying selection in all populations. Interestingly,
Stokowski et al. [45], by means of a multistage genomewide association study, have recently found that polymorphisms in TYR (along with SLC24A5 and SLC45A2)
show significant associations with skin-reflectance measurements in a South Asian population. Whether this is a
particular characteristic of this population remains to be
explored, but altogether, this suggests that a number of
different selective regimes may have interacted in a complex way in the evolution of melanogenesis. As a result,
the lighter skin pigmentation phenotype in Europeans
and East Asians may have been acquired by alternative
mechanisms and thus, as previously suggested [11-13,15],

light skin would be the result of convergent evolution.
Similarly, the diversity profile of Australian Aborigines
suggests that this may also be the case for dark skin.

Methods
Cells and cell cultures
All melanocytes used were obtained from human skin.
Melanocyte line M0202 was obtained from a lightly pigmented donor by one of us (NS) in the lab. Melanocytes
M1 ("Caucasian", 1.5 years old, male donor) and M4
("Negroid", 4 years old, male donor) were purchased
from Promocell (Heidelberg, Germany). The 19-HEM cell
line (lightly pigmented) was purchased from Gentaur
(Belgium), and NHEM cells (two lightly pigmented and
three darkly pigmented) were purchased from Cascade
Biologics (Nottinghamshire, UK).

Cell cultures were maintained in an incubator at 37°C
and 5% CO2. Melanocyte culture conditions were as indicated by the suppliers. Briefly: a) M0202 cells were initially grown in FETI medium: H-10, 2% FCS, 1% Ultroser
G (BioSepra, Ciphergen, France), 4 ng/ml bFGF, 2 ng/ml
endothelin-1, 5.3 nm TPA, 0.05 mM IBMX, but were later
grown in H-10 supplemented with HEPES 6 mM, 5% FBS
and MelanoMax (Gentaur), which presumably contains
TPA, CT and contains BPE at 40 μg/ml (C. Stefanidis, Gentaur; personal communication); b) M1 and M4 melanocytes were cultured in melanocyte growth medium M2
(Promocell). M2 is a serum-free medium, without PMA
(TPA) or other tumor promoting or toxic agents, consisting of a basal medium plus a Supplement Mix. The
detailed formulation has not been disclosed by the supplier, but it seems that no BPE is present in this growth
medium (Ute Liegibel, PromoCell, personal communication). c) 19-HEM melanocytes were grown in H-10 sup-

plemented with HEPES 6 mM, 5% FBS and MelanoMax
(Gentaur); d) NHEM melanocytes culture medium was
Cascade Biologics Medium 254 supplemented with 1%
HMGS (containing BPE, FBS, bovine insuline, bovine
transferrin, bFGF, hydrocortisone, heparin and PMA)
(Cascade Biologics).
The culture medium was changed every two days until the
culture was approximately 80–90% confluent, and everyday thereafter.
M0202, HEM and NHEM melanocytes were passaged
(split 1:3) routinely every 10 or 11 days, or harvested
when they had reached confluency. The growth rate for
M1 and M4 melanocytes was slow, and passaging (1:2) or
harvesting at confluency was performed routinely after 2
to 3 weeks. All melanocytes used were from passage 5 to
15, and all were from normal non-transformed primary
cell culture isolates.
Irradiation
Subconfluence cultures were irradiated once a day for 5
consecutive days with UVA+B (50 mJ/cm2:25 mJ/cm2)
light in an ICH2 photoreactor (LuzChem, Canada) at
37°C. These doses assumed an absorbance of the plastic
flask of approximately 5% for UVA and 11% for UVB
(flasks were opaque to UVC), estimated from spectrophotometer absorbance readings at 255 nm, 305 nm and 360
nm of cuvette-size splinters of the flasks. By trials with
murine melanoma cells (B16F10), this dose was shown to
have no effect on cell viability. In order to prevent the generation of toxic metabolites, the culture medium was
replaced by PBS with magnesium and calcium immediately before irradiation. After irradiation, PBS was
replaced again by the culture medium. Irradiation control
cultures were subject to the same procedure, except that
they were covered by aluminum foil during irradiation.
Cultures were harvested 24 h after the last irradiation
dose.
Microarray gene expression
Immediately after harvesting, cells were resuspended in
lysis buffer. Total RNA was obtained following the supplier's protocol (Ambion's total RNA extraction kit),
including DNAse treatment. cDNA was synthesized from
2 μgr of total RNA using the Affymetrix One-Cycle cDNA
Synthesis Kit and following the Affymetrix Expression
Analysis Technical Manual. From this cDNA, cRNA was
synthesized using the Affymetrix IVT Labeling Kit, which
was then purified with the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample
Cleanup Module. The purified cRNA (15 μgr) was fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix U133A 2.0 arrays
using standard Affymetrix protocols. A total of 18 microarrays from 9 irradiated cell lines (5 from lightly pigmented donors and 4 from darkly pigmented donors)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/74

plus their corresponding unirradiated control cultures
were analyzed.
Microarray Data Analysis
Raw data were log2 transformed and quantile normalized
using DNAMR v1.1 [46] for R (2.4.1). The Pattern Discovery option of SAM software v3.0 [47] was used to analyze
the normalized data. Gene Ontology analysis was done
using FatiGO [48].
Quantitative PCR
To demonstrate that the media composition, in particular
the presence/absence of BPE, affects the expression levels
of TYR, TYRP1 and DCT we purchased a new melanocyte
cell line from Cascade Biologics (lightly pigmented) and
grew this cell line in Cascade growth medium 254 supplemented with 1% HGMS (Cascade + for short). We subcultured and propagated the cells for approximately 3
weeks (three passages). Three days after the third passage
we generated 4 subcultures of the same cell line. These 4
subcultures were from now on grown in 6 different media:
Medium 1: Cascade +; Medium 2: Cascade medium, PromoCell Supplement (no BPE); Medium 3: PromoCell
growth medium plus PromoCell Supplement. Medium 4:
PromoCell growth medium plus PromoCell Supplement,
plus 0.2% (v/v) of a 13 mg/ml solution of BPE. Cells were
grown in these media for four days to allow some adaptation to the new media. Media were refreshed every two
days.

After this time, we extracted total RNA from each subculture (Ambion). cDNA was synthesized using the Invitrogen SuperScript First-Strand synthesis system for RT-PCR
kit, and then, we quantified the expression of TYR, TYRP1
and DCT for each of these subcultures using the BIO-RAD
iQ SYBR green Supermix system in combination with a
BIO-RAD iCycler machine. For mRNA quantification the
following primers were used: TYR: 5'-AGAATGCTCTGGCTGTTTTG-3' and 5'-TCCATCAGGTTCTTAGAGGAGACAC-3'.
For
TYRP1:
5'CATGCAGGAAATGTTGCAAGAG-3'
and
5'-AGTTTGGGCTTATTAGAGTGGAATC-3'; For DCT: 5'-TATTAGGACCAGGACGCCCC-3'
and
5'TGGTACCGGTGCCAGGTAAC-3'. For normalization
GADPH was used; primer: 5'-CCTGTTCGACAGTCAGCC3' and 5'-CGACCAAATCCGTTGACTCC-3'. In all cases,
annealing temperatures were fixed at 56°C. For DCT,
Mg2+ concentration was increased in 1 mM above the
standard reaction conditions.
DNA samples and Resequencing
We have resequenced the following in 116 human chromosomes: a) 4.1 kb of 5' DCT, including 187 bp of the
first intron, the first CDS plus the 5'-UTR and 3,204 bp of
the upstream flanking sequence; b) approximately 4 kb of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:74

5' TYR, including 17 bp of the first intron, the first CDS
plus the 5'-UTR and 2,773 bp of the upstream flanking
sequence; and c) approximately 5 kb of 5' TYRP1, including 433 bp of the first intron, 47 bp of the second intron,
the first CDS plus the 5'-UTR and 4,200 bp of the
upstream flanking sequence. Sample individuals come
from diverse geographical origins and include: 20 chromosomes from Biaka and Mbuti Pygmies (DNA purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures,
ECACC), 20 chromosomes from Senegalese individuals
resident in Spain, 42 European (N. Spain) chromosomes
(including 20 chromosomes from melanoma patients),
20 Asian chromosomes including Chinese samples from
Coriell Cell Repositories and Chinese residents in Spain,
and 14 chromosomes from Australian Aborigines (DNA
purchased from the ECACC).
DNA was PCR amplified in overlapping ~1 kb long segments and these were resequenced using BigDye 3.1
chemistry and ABI PRISM 3730 and ABI 310 DNA analyzers. Sequences were edited with Genalys v3.3.45a (M.
Takahashi). Primers and PCR conditions are available on
request. Sequences have been deposited in GenBank,
accession numbers DQ821585-DQ821701 for DCT,
EF675246-EF675361 for TYR and EF675362-EF675477
for TYRP1.
Estimation of haplotypes
To solve the haplotypes phase, we first run PHASE [49].
For those pairs of SNPs that did not reach a PHASE probability greater than 0.95, we solved their phase experimentally by ARMS-PCR and/or cloning (using the TOPO-TA
kit from Invitrogene) plus resequencing.
Population parameters and neutrality tests
After removing polymorphic positions in humans, divergence (K) between a chimp sequence and a human
sequence was estimated using K-estimator 6.0 [50]. Initially, population diversity parameters and neutrality statistics like Tajima's D [29] were obtained by means of
DnaSP 4.1 [51]. These tests were corrected for demography as specified below. HEW and DHEW tests [32] were
carried out using software kindly provided by Kai Zeng.
Optimization of demographic parameters
To correct for demography in the coalescent neutral simulations of the neutrality tests (excluding HEW and
DHEW), we optimized the fit between pairwise FST distributions obtained from real genomic data from the three
major geographical human groups in the HapMap
project, and those FST distributions from coalescent simulations obtained varying the demographic parameters.
The optimization criterion was the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistic between the real and simulated FST distributions. For the real neutral distribution of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/74

the FST statistic [52], we used that obtained previously in
[15] in which we selected 43 regions distributed across the
autosomal genome that belong to broader regions of low
gene density, and which are at least 150 kb away from the
closest exon. Each of these regions spanned an average of
1.96 Mb, and in total they account for 84.3 Mb. For each
region we downloaded the SNP frequency information
available from the HapMap browser (data Rel #20/phase
II on NCBI B35 assembly, dbSNP b125) for the 3 major
populations (Caucasians: 153,339 SNPS, Yorubas:
123,798 SNPs and Chinese: 33,190 SNPs). We further filtered the number of SNPs to include only those SNPs that:
a) were at least 100 kb away from each other, b) have been
genotyped in all three populations and c) at least one of
the three major populations had a minor allele frequency
(MAF) higher than 0.1. A final list of 546 SNPs satisfied
these criteria. We used the ms program [53] for the simulations with 3 populations, with sample sizes equal to
those in the HapMap population (120 chromosomes for
the African population, 120 for Caucasians and 90 for
Asians). As starting points in our simulations to optimize
demographic parameters, we used those values described
in [54]. Simulations were fixed on one segregating site.
These SNPs were matched for a MAF of 0.1 in at least one
population.
The mean and 95% upper limits (between brackets) of the
observed FST distributions were [15]: Caucasians-Chinese:
0.08 (0.33); Caucasians-Yorubas: 0.14 (0.47) and Chinese-Yorubas: 0.16 (0.45). Final optimized values were
obtained in the simulations under the following conditions: we used an ancestral population size of 24,000 for
the African population (population 1) and 7,700 for both
Asians and Caucasians (populations 2 and 3, respectively), with a migration rate matrix Mij = {0, 0.05, 0.4,
0.1, 0 3, 0.8, 2.5, 0} for i and j values from 1 to 3. Looking
back in time, we assumed two bottlenecks with instant
population reduction, each followed by a population
fusion: one approximately 40,000 years ago, in which the
Chinese population reduced its size to approximately one
sixth. About 2,000 years after this episode, the Chinese
population fuses with the European population. Assuming a generation time of 20 years, this represents an F
value of 0.04 for this bottleneck. A second population
bottleneck takes place about 90,000 years ago. On this
occasion, the Eurasian population suffers a reduction in
size to one sixth of its previous size. About 10,000 years
after this bottleneck (F = 0.21), the Eurasian population
fuses with the African population. The mean and 95%
upper limits (between brackets) of the simulated FST distributions were: Caucasians-Chinese: 0.08 (0.31); Caucasians-Yorubas: 0.15 (0.44) and Chinese-Yorubas: 0.15
(0.45). The optimized, simulated FST distribution and the
real distribution recorded Kolmogorov-Smirnov D values
of 0.0356 for Caucasians vs. Asians (p-value 0.891),

0.0748 for Caucasians vs. Africans (p-value 0.104), and
0.0441 for Asians vs. Africans (p-value 0.683). As both
simulated and real data are not statistically different, we
used those demographical parameters used in the simulations for the subsequent neutrality tests.
Correction for demography in the neutrality tests
These demographic and genetic parameters were subsequently used in further simulations for estimating the critical points in Tajima's D. These simulations also allowed
us to obtain the distribution of Tajima's D under the
genetic and demographic parameters described above.
Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) test
For the EHH test, we initially used Sweep 1.0 [55] to scan
and select the core haplotypes. We initially focused on
those haplotypes that showed both substantial frequency
and high EHH values from the core SNPs, in both 5' and
3' directions. By means of a Perl script, we then calculated
the EHH values as in [26] for a region extending about 50
kb from the closer core SNP. To test the significance of the
test, we ran coalescent simulations using the population
and demographical parameters described above for the
FST distributions, but in this case several aspects are different from our previous approach [15]. First, in this case we
included the variable recombination rate information
obtained from the HapMap webpage for the particular
region tested. In each case, we obtained a discrete number
of recombination rate classes using the following
approach: for each region we obtained the average and
standard deviation (sd) of the distribution of recombination rates obtained from the HapMap link. All recombination values greater than the average plus 2 sd were
considered outliers. If these outlier regions were consecutive, a local average was calculated; otherwise, a single outlier value was assigned for that region flanked between the
previous and the next recombination values. We then
excluded these outliers and repeated the process. In this
second round, recombination rates that were higher than
the new global average plus 1 sd were considered again as
a class each, except if they were consecutive, in which case
a local average was estimated. The average of the rest of
recombination rates was considered as the background
recombination rate, which was used as a reference to estimate the relative intensity of recombination for all other
recombination classes.

For the coalescent simulations with heterogeneous recombination rates, we used msHOT [56], a modification of
[53] coalescent-based program (ms) for simulating genetic
variation data for a sample of chromosomes from a population. Second, in order to obtain a null distribution that
reflects a neutral scenario for the chosen core haplotypes,
we proceeded as follows: a) in the simulations, the "core"
was the set of the first n SNPs, where n is the number of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/74

SNPs in the original core for each case. We then discarded
those simulations that did not result in a number of distinct haplotypes (as defined from the simulated core set of
SNPs) identical to that observed in the HapMap data
using the corresponding observed core SNPs; b) one of the
simulated haplotypes had to match in frequency (allowing for a 2% difference) our observed core haplotype
being tested, and in addition, it had to show the same
ancestral/derived states for the SNPs composing the core.
For the latter, ancestrality was obtained by comparing the
corresponding orthologous regions from the chimpanzee
genome sequence and the Macaca mulatta genome
sequence obtained from the UCSC genome browser [57]
or the Ensembl genome browser [58]; c) for each set of
simulations that fulfilled these conditions (we typically
ran the program until we obtained about 500 simulations
satisfying all the conditions), we obtained the 95% upper
percentile of the expected EHH distribution for each of a
series of consecutive 1 kb-long windows spanning the
region. We finally declared a core haplotype as under
selection if the distance for which the EHH values were
equal to 1 for the SNPs in the HapMap data was longer
than the distance observed from the 95% upper percentile
distribution of the EHH values obtained in the simulations.
This approach offers several advantages over other methods currently being used to detect selection. For instance,
it allows for a direct comparison with a "neutral" null distribution. In contrast, null distributions obtained from
genomic regions are not representative of a homogeneous
neutral scenario, but rather the result of heterogeneous
evolutionary processes. In addition, it allows statistical
inference even when no alternative haplotypes for the
same core SNPs are available in order to obtain relative
EHH values, as done in other approaches. Finally, ancestral-derived state information and information on the
core haplotypes frequency can be incorporated, which
helps fine-tune the nature of the elements being compared (observed and simulated data).
Multiple testing corrections
To control for multiple testing in the FST tests, we used the
approach by [59], which sets the false discovery rate
(FDR) at a level α by ranking the initial p values in ascending order P(1) ≤ P(2) ≤ ... ≤ P(m), with m being the number
of tests, and then by specifying P(i) ≤ αi/m as the point
below which there is no rejection at an FDR of α.
Genealogical relationships among haplotypes
Graphical representations of the genealogical relationships among haplotypes were estimated by the MedianJoining (MJ) algorithm implemented in Network 4.1.1.2
[60]. When feasible, the ancestral haplotype was inferred

using parsimony by comparison to the chimp and rhesus
macaque sequences.
Test for overdominance
To evaluate the possibility of overdominance (heterozygote advantage), we scored the ratio of "observed heterozygosity" to "expected heterozygosity" for single SNPs.
Observed heterozygosity was estimated by counting heterozygote individuals in the HapMap data set for each SNP
in question. The expected heterozygosity was estimated by
calculating gene diversity from allele frequencies. Significance for ratio values greater than 1 was obtained by simulation using ms [53].
