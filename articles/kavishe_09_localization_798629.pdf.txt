Abstract
Background: The spread of drug resistance has been a major obstacle to the control of malaria.
The mechanisms underlying drug resistance in malaria seem to be complex and multigenic. The
current literature on multiple drug resistance against anti-malarials has documented PfMDR1, an
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein, as an important determinant of resistance. In the Plasmodium
falciparum genome, there are several ABC transporters some of which could be putative drug
transporting proteins. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying drug
resistance, characterization of these transporters is essential. The aim of this study was to
characterize and localize putative ABC transporters.
Methods: In the plasmoDB database, 16 members of the P. falciparum ABC family can be identified,
11 of which are putative transport proteins. A phylogenetic analysis of the aligned NBDs of the
PfABC genes was performed. Antibodies against PfMRP1 (PfABCC1), PfMRP2 (PfABCC2), and
PfMDR5 (PfABCB5) were generated, affinity purified and used in immunocytochemistry to localize
the proteins in the asexual stages of the parasite.
Results: The ABC family members of P. falciparum were categorized into subfamilies. The ABC B
subfamily was the largest and contained seven members. Other family members that could be
involved in drug transport are PfABCC1, PfABCC2, PfABCG1, and PfABCI3. The expression and
localization of three ABC transport proteins was determined. PfMRP1, PfMRP2, and PfMDR5 are
localized to the plasma membrane in all asexual stages of the parasite.
Conclusion: In conclusion, 11 of the 16 ABC proteins in the P. falciparum genome are putative
transport proteins, some of which might be involved in drug resistance. Moreover, it was
demonstrated that three of these proteins are expressed on the parasite's plasma membrane.

Background
Drug resistance is a major problem in malaria. Today only
a limited number of effective anti-malarials is available.
An important reason for therapeutic failure in malaria
treatment could be that drugs do not reach their target
sites, due to active extrusion by the parasite. The transport
proteins responsible for this type of resistance are socalled multidrug resistance proteins (MDR/MRP), most of
which belong to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette
(ABC) proteins, one of the largest protein families. Many
of these plasma membrane proteins actively pump out a
wide range of structurally and functionally diverse
amphipathic drugs, thereby decreasing the intracellular
drug accumulation and resulting in drug resistance [1,2].
The structure of a typical ABC transporter consists of six
trans-membrane segments that form a trans-membrane
domain (TMD) and the Walker A and Walker B motifs
that form a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (Figure 1).
ABC transporters are either encoded as full transporters
(TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD) or as half transporters (TMDNBD) that upon translation combine to form a functional
unit. Apart from their normal physiological role, ABC
transporters are involved in various diseases either by a
mutation or through an altered mode of their expression
[3,4].
Several polymorphisms and an increased copy number of
the Plasmodium falciparum MDR1 have been associated
with drug resistance [5]. Heterologous expression data
indeed show that PfMDR1-mediated anti-malarial drug
transport is affected by some of these polymorphisms
[6,7]. The other member of the PfABC B family that has
been characterized is the half transporter PfMDR2 that
confers heavy metal resistance to P. falciparum and most
likely is not involved in drug resistance [8]. Finally,
PfMRP1 polymorphisms have been associated with drug

resistance and recently it has been shown that PfMRP1
transports anti-malarial drugs and glutathione [9].
PfMDR1 has been detected in the membrane of the food
vacuole [10], which is in contrast to PfMRP1 that has been
immunelocalized in the plasma membrane of the parasite
[9,11]. In previous studies the P. falciparum ABC family
members were identified [12,13] and categorized [14,15].
In this study, the P. falciparum ABC transporter family has
also been categorized and the database sequence of
PfMRP1, PfMRP2, and PfMDR5 was confirmed. Moreover, with immunocytochemistry techniques it was shown
that all three transporters are probably present in the
plasma membrane of the parasite during the asexual
erythrocytic stages.

Methods
Parasite culture, extraction and DNA isolation
NF54 (Amsterdam airport) strain of P. falciparum was cultured as described by Ponnudurai et al [16]. The culture
medium [17] was changed twice daily. Infected blood culture was centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 minutes to collect
RBCs. After washing twice with PBS the cells were resuspended in 0.05% saponin in PBS and incubated at 37°C
for 30 minutes. Then the sample was centrifuged at 2000
g for 10 minutes to collect the parasites. Parasite cells were
washed twice with PBS and genomic DNA was isolated
using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The
Netherlands) following the cultured cells protocol as
directed by the manufacturer. RNA was isolated using
standard Trizol (guanidinium isothiocyanate) method.
Briefly, 500 μl Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was added to
the parasite pellet followed with 2.5 μl glycogen solution
(18 mg/ml), the mixture was homogenized with pipette
and incubated on ice for 5 min 50 μl chloroform was
added and after shaking thoroughly the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. Centrifugation at 13,000 g for 15
min at 4°C separated the mixture into upper aqueous and
lower chloroform phases. The aqueous phase which contains RNA was transferred into a fresh tube and 240 μl isopropyl alcohol was added, mixed by vortex and incubated
on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation at 13,000 g for 20
min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the RNA
pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 20 μl DEPC treated
water. RNA was stored at -20°C until use.
Sequencing of PfMRP1, PfMRP2, and PfMDR5
cDNA was synthesized with superscript-II reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen). PCR for the
ABC genes was performed on cDNA using Takara LA Taq.
PCR protocol was followed as outlined on Takara protocol except that annealing was done at 58°C for 30 sec,
extension at 62°C for 10 min, 25 cycles with final extension 72°C for 5 minutes. The PCR product was PEG-purified and cloned into pDONR-221 entry-vector using BP

clonase kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed using ABI3730 analyzer
(Applied biosystems Inc.).
Antibodies
PfMRP1 polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against
the specific peptides 215CSNNNHLQNPDAFY228 and
1420YASGIIKLYKEKNYV1434 as described by Klokousas et
al [11] (Eurogentec, Belgium), whereas the PfMDR5 polyclonal antibody was designed and produced in rabbits (EZ
Biolab,
USA)
against
the
peptide
730CQSTKYNSQCYQKNK744 in the cytosolic loop of the
protein. For PfMRP2 a GST-fusion peptide was produced
in Escherichia coli using pGEX-3X vector. This peptide corresponds to a 70 amino acid long region within the
cytosolic loop of PfMRP2 represented by the sequence:
LHYEGNLVDYIKKNNIVVKEDIVQTNKQCEKKSLTNEQV
KSMLSLNEDWNYMHRVKKKSITQKETTKNYD. The peptide was extracted and purified from E. coli using glutathione-agarose beads (BD Biosciences). 2 ml of the purified
peptide was subcutaneously injected into rabbits followed
with a 1st and 2nd boost on day 21 and 42, respectively.
Pre-immune serum was taken on day zero and after 63
days serum was collected. For immuno-localization experiments, the polyclonal sera for PfMRP1 and PFMDR5 were
affinity purified using Sulfolink immobilization kit for
peptides (Thermo scientific, USA) while for PfMRP2 the
Affigel-15 kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used as
described by the manufacturers.
Immuno-localization
Infected RBCs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes at room temperature then washed once with PBS.
The cells were applied on poly-L-lysine coated slide cover
slips (12 mm, Menzel GmbH & co KG, Germany) and air
dried for 5 – 10 minutes. Cover slips were quenched with
0.15% glycine in 0.5% PBS-tween20 (PBST) for 10 minutes at room temp followed by washing twice with PBST
and incubation with 0.1% tritonX100 (BDH chemicals)
for 45 minutes at room temp. After washing once with
PBST, blocking was done with normal goat serum
(Zymed, USA) for 1 hr at room temp followed with washing once with PBST. Cover slips were then incubated with
primary antibody: rabbit polyclonals and mouse antiPfERC (MR4, MRA-87 Pf39 mouse antiserum, deposited
by TJ Templeton) or mouse anti-glycophorin A monoclonals (Caltag laboratories, Invitrogen) at 4°C overnight
followed with three times washing each for 20 minutes
with PBST at room temperature. The secondary antibodies
Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse
monoclonals (Molecular probes, The Netherlands) were
applied on the cover slips for 2 hrs at room temperature.
After rinsing two times with PBST, the cover slips were
incubated for 30 minutes with DAPI followed with 2 × 20
minutes washing with PBST at room temperature. The

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/205

cover slips were then briefly air-dried in the dark and
mounted on microscope slides (Menzel GmbH & co KG,
Germany) using Dako fluorescent mounting medium
(Dako North America Inc., Carpinteria USA). Slides were
imaged using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000).
Image J free software version 1.43 was used to process
images.

Results
Identification and characterization of ABC transport
proteins
In the plasmoDB database, a PFAM (PF00005:ABC_tran
ABC transporter) search for ABC transport proteins in P.
falciparum resulted in 16 hits. PfMDR1 (PFE1150w),
PfMDR2 (PF14_0455), and PfMRP1 (PFA0590w) are hits
that have been described in literature by several groups [810], but the other family members have not been the subject of investigation yet. In this study it was determined if
the family members are full (two NBDs) or half transporters (one NBD). Next the NBD (30 amino acids before
Walker A until Walker B) were aligned with ClustalW2
[18]. Part of the aligned sequence with the Walker A
(GxxGxGKST or [AG]xxxxGK [ST]), the ABC signature
sequence (LSGGQ), and Walker B (hhhhDEPT or
DExxxxxD) are shown in Figure 2. The phylogenetic data
was imported in TreeView [19] and visualized as a phylogram in Figure 3. A blast search against human proteins
clearly shows that there are no members of the A subfamily. However, P. falciparum contains 11 putative transport proteins containing TMDs that belong to the B, C, G
and I subfamilies. In addition, there are five ABC family
members that do not contain a TMD. Three of these
belong to the E and F subfamilies, whereas the other two
members were classified in the I subfamily that was introduced for the plant ABC proteins recently [20]. The numbering within each subfamily is shown in Table 1 and was
done according to the existing chronological numbering
(PfMDR1, PfMDR2, PfMRP1, and PfMRP2). Moreover,
neighbouring ABC members in the phylogenetic tree
obtained sequential numbering. The numbers do not
carry additional information, such as a relationship with
ABC transporters of other species. The domain organization was established by analysis of the sequences with
SMART [21].

This study focuses on PfMRP1 (PFA0590w), PfMRP2
(PFL1410c), and PfMDR5 (PF13_0218), because their
antibody generation was successful. PfMRP1 and PfMRP2
are both full transporters that belong to the ABC C family,
whereas PfMDR5 is a half transporter that belongs to the
ABC B family. For these three transporters, the trans-membrane segments were determined with TMHMM [22].
Some of the trans-membrane segments were not predicted, but weak probabilities of TM helices were assigned
as such in order to obtain the correct ABC trans-mem-

brane domains with six trans-membrane segments (Table
2). PfMRP1, PfMRP2, and PfMDR5 genes were sequenced
and the results matched the published data and no polymorphisms were observed.
Localization of PfMRP1, PfMRP2, and PfMDR5
Polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunization of
rabbits with specific peptides for the P. falciparum ABC
proteins. Blast searches with the peptides showed no relevant specific hits with other proteins. To minimize aspecific binding immuno-purified antibodies against the
peptide were used for immuno-localization studies. The
glycophorin-A antibody was used to stain erythrocyte
membranes thus contrasting them from parasite cells
while the PfERC antibody, which binds to an intracellular
calcium binding protein located on the endoplasmic reticulum, was used to determine intracellular localization of
the pfABCs.

PfMRP1 localized to the parasites plasma membrane and
no signal was observed on the erythrocyte membrane or
in the region around the food vacuole. In the differential
interface contrast image the food vacuole can be recognized from its dark-spot appearance (presence of haemo-

zoin crystals). These results are consistent with those
reported in a recent study [9] in which plasma membrane
localization of PfMRP1 was reported also, with possible
intracellular expression. The results in this study show the
signal to be intense on the outside, forming a clear rim in
what can be interpreted as the parasite's plasma membrane especially in the ring and trophozoite stages (Figures 4A–D). More clearly cytoplasmic staining was
evident in the schizont stages (Figures 4B, C, and 4E),
interpreted as plasma membrane partitions of the dividing parasites. Unfortunately, due to their small size
detailed high magnification imaging of the non-dividing
stages such as rings and young trophozoites was limited
by the light resolution power of the microscope. PfMRP1
did not co-localize with PfERC, thus suggesting the
absence of PfMRP1 on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
For PfMRP2 specific staining was observed on the parasite's plasma membrane (Figure 5, column 2). Low intensity signal was occasionally observed intracellularly
especially in early schizont stages (Figure 5, D2) which
can be considered to be plasma membrane partitions as
the parasite undergoes cytokinesis. This is especially so as

the parasite, PfMDR5 localized differently, forming a rim
outside the PfERC staining in all stages (Figure 6D–F)
(ring stages not shown). Therefore, it is concluded that
PfMDR5 is primarily expressed on the plasma membrane.

each of these partitions enclose a nucleus as clearly
stained by DAPI (Figure 5, D4). PfMRP2 did not co-localize with PfERC in the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 5C
and 5D) and no staining was observed in the region presumed to be the food vacuole (shown by arrow in Figure
5, C5).
PfMDR5 was clearly observed to localize to the surface of
the parasite in all asexual stages (Figure 6). Trophozoite
stages sometimes revealed a less intense intracellular
staining around the food vacuole (Figure 6, B5 and D5).
This pattern of staining though sometimes strong, was not
consistent in the many slides scanned. Instead the staining was sometimes seen around the nuclei of dividing trophozoites, which may also suggest these to be plasma
membrane partitions as the trophozoite divides. Moreover, in the schizont stages the region covered by the food
vacuole did not show any obvious staining with the
PfMDR5 antibody, instead clear partitions were seen separating each of the individual nuclei (Figure 6, 2C). In

Discussion
In the plasmoDB database 16 members of the P. falciparum ABC family can be identified, 11 of which could be
putative drug efflux transporters. A phylogenetic analysis
of the PfABC genes was performed and the genes were categorized into seven subfamily groups. Three ABC family
members were analysed in more detail and their expression in all erythrocytic stages as well as their localization
at the plasma membrane of the parasite was demonstrated.
Development of resistance against newly introduced antimalarials can be rapid especially in malaria endemic
regions where drug pressure is high. For instance mefloquine was introduced in Thailand in 1984 as a very potent
drug against multidrug resistant malaria, but six years later
significant resistance had developed [23]. Multiple studies
have demonstrated the role of PfMDR1 polymorphisms
in multidrug resistant malaria. It was shown that the antimalarial drugs halofantrine, quinine and chloroquine are
transported by PfMDR1 [7]. Moreover, polymorphisms
within PfMDR1 alter the substrate specificity for these
anti-malarial drugs [7]. Recent association studies have
linked single nucleotide polymorphisms on PfMRP1 with
reduced parasite response to anti-malarial drugs [24,25]
and expression of both PfMRP1 and PfMRP2 were up-regulated by mefloquine and chloroquine in laboratory cultures of both drug sensitive and resistant strains [26]. This
indicates that ABC transporters play a role in malaria
chemotherapy [27]. The knowledge that other PfABC family members could be capable of drug transport indicates
that it is likely that some of these transport proteins might
play a role in emerging drug resistance. Further identification and characterization of these ABC transporters will
provide information on their putative role in resistance
and may provide novel targets to control and perhaps prevent spread of resistance against other efficacious drugs.
The PFAM search in plasmoDB resulted in 16 ABC family
members that were also identified and catagorized by others [12-15]. ABC A subfamily members were not observed,
but these seem to be absent in all Apicomplexa. The ABC
B subfamily consists of seven members of which only
PfMDR1 is a full transporter. The C subfamily contains
two full transporters, whereas the G subfamily contains
one half transporter. Next to these ABC family members
there is one additional member that contains a TMD. As
this member does not belong to the existing subfamilies,
it was placed in the I family that was proposed by Verrier

the ABC families of different protozoan parasites were
listed. They clustered the ABC family members in a way
similar to our approach. In this study PF08_0078 was,
however, assigned in the F family according to the phylogenetic analysis of both NBDs, whereas they categorized it
as "other". As they did not show a phylogenetic analysis it
is not clear why this discrepancy exists. Moreover,
PFC0875w (PfABCI3), that does not possess a clear ABC
signature motif, but according to the PFAM search belongs
to the ABC family, is not listed in their overview. In this
study the existing nomenclature for PfMDR1, PfMDR2,
and PfMRP1, was not changed, but the nomenclature of
Verrier et al [20] for plant ABC proteins that was adopted
from the HUGO nomenclature and discussed in several
international meetings was used. This nomenclature
essentially constitutes a catalogue with numbered entries,
where the numbers do not necessarily carry additional
information, although the subfamily assignment does
indeed convey information about phylogenetic relation-

ships [20]. The gene nomenclature recently published by
Sauvage et al [15] is based on the nomenclature for Toxoplasma gondii [28], which as a consequence in P. falciparum
resulted in the absence of ABCB2, ABCG1, ABCG2,
ABCH1, and ABCH3 and the relocation of PfMDR2 to
ABCB3. Such a nomenclature is, however, impractical for
a group with relatively few orthologous pairings, such as
the ABCs [20].
It is known that the malaria parasite can express its membrane proteins on at least four different subcellular sites:
on its membrane-bound organelles, the plasma membrane, the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane and on
the plasma membrane of its host erythrocyte [29,30]. The
expression of PfMRP1, PfMRP2, and PfMDR5 was
observed on the outside of the parasite. It is practically
impossible to distinguish the plasma membrane from the
parasitophorous vacuolar membrane by immunocytochemistry. However, a detailed look at the expression of
all three ABC transporters shows that they are also present
on membranes between parasitic nuclei in the multinuclear stages of development. As these are plasma membranes in the process of formation, it is concluded that all
three ABC transport proteins are located on the plasma

membrane in all asexual erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. The localization of PfMRP1 at the plasma membrane has been shown by others [9,11]. An elegant control
was shown in the recent study of Ray et al [9], where a P.
falciparum knock-out of PfMRP1 was used. In this study,
knock-out parasites were not available and as an additional control the antibody was affinity purified with the
peptide that was used to immunize the rabbits. In addition, background staining with the erythrocytes was not
observed indicating that the staining was specific.

Conclusion
16 ABC proteins were categorized according the phylogenetic tree that was constructed from the aligned NBDs.
PfMRP1, PfMRP2, and PfMDR5 were localized at the
plasma membrane of the parasite throughout the asexual
stages. This localization emphasizes the putative role of
drug exporters of these ABC family members. Indeed, Ray
et al [9] have shown that PfMRP1 plays a role in the efflux
of glutathione, chloroquine, and quinine and contributes
to parasite responses to multiple anti-malarial drugs, possibly by pumping drugs outside the parasite. PfMRP2 and
PfMDR5 might have similar roles and thereby broadening
the capacity of the parasite to extrude toxic compounds.
Additional research is required to test this hypothesis.
