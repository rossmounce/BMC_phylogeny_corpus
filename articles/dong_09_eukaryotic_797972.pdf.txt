Abstract
Background: The orthologs of eukaryotic initiation factor 5C (eIF5C) are essential to the
initiation of protein translation, and their regulation during development is not well known.
Results: A cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 419 amino acids containing an N-terminal leucine
zipper motif and a C-terminal eIF5C domain was cloned from metamorphic larvae of Helicoverpa
armigera. It was subsequently named Ha-eIF5C. Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) revealed a
high expression of the mRNA of Ha-eIF5C in the head-thorax, integument, midgut, and fat body
during metamorphosis. Immunohistochemistry suggested that Ha-eIF5C was distributed into both
the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the midgut, fat body and integument. Ha-eIF5C expression was
upregulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Furthermore, the transcription of Ha-eIF5C was down
regulated after silencing of ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) or Ultraspiracle protein (USP) by RNAi.
Conclusion: These results suggested that during metamorphosis of the cotton bollworm, HaeIF5C was upregulated by 20E through the EcR and USP transcription factors.

Background
To holometabolous insects, molting is a common physiological process, whose life cycles are characterized by a
series of molts. During their larval molts, the larvae
progress from one instar to the next. Thereafter, pupation
and eclosion ensue during their metamorphic molts.
Increasing evidence indicates that some hormones and
receptors may contribute to the complex developmental
pathways associated with molting and metamorphosis.
Many genes have been shown to be involved in molting
or metamorphosis, such as the transcription factors ecdysteroid receptor (EcR), Ultraspiracle protein (USP), Hormone
receptor 3 (HR3) and Broad complex [1], and the programmed cell death pathway genes [2]. Some key regulatory genes have also been identified, such as E74B and E93

[3]. However, very few genes downstream of Broad complex, E74B and E93 have been identified. Consequently,
there is a dearth of available knowledge on the molecular
mechanisms that lead to larval molt and metamorphosis.
By conducting a research of the molting related genes, we
may further understand the molecular mechanism of
development and ecdysone regulation, and find the novel
molecular targets to effectively control the pest.
Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) is a useful
method for identifying differentially expressed genes during larval molting. Using the metamorphically committed
larvae (6th-72, 96 and 120 h) as the tester and the feeding
5th instar larvae (5th-24 h) as the driver, we obtained an
EST, which was similar to basic leucine zipper by BLASTX

analysis [4]. We designed primers based on this fragment
to obtain the full-length cDNA and identified it as translation initiation factor 5C (eIF5C).
The regulation of translation plays an important role in
the control of gene expression. In eukaryotes, translation
regulation occurs primarily during the initial step, which
is rate limiting under most circumstances [5]. More and
more evidence suggests that translation initiation factors
(eIFs) are not only essential in the initiation of protein
translation but also important in other life processes.
Some eIFs are regulators of signaling pathways, such as
eIF4A of Drosophila melanogaster, which functions as a negative regulator of Dpp/BMP (decapentaplagic/bone morphogenetic protein) signaling that mediates SMAD
(mother against dpp) degradation [6]. Eukaryotic initiation factor 6 selectively regulates Wnt signaling and β-catenin protein synthesis [7].
eIF5C is a phylogenetically conserved protein, which is
said to contain an N-terminal leucine zipper motif and a
C-terminal eIF5C domain. Our BLASTX results showed
that homologs of eIF5C exist in various organisms, from
Cryptococcus neoformans to Homo sapiens. BZAP45, the
ortholog of eIF5C in humans, contributes to transcriptional control at the G1/S phase transition [8]. In Rattus
norvegicus, brain development-related molecule 2 (Bdm2)
is a developmentally regulated gene, which is highly
expressed in fetal rat brain [9]. Wang et al. [10] showed
that eIF5C was associated with the ribosome through an
interaction with D. melanogaster ribosomal protein L5
(dRPL5), suggesting its possible role during protein synthesis in fruit flies. Given that there are no related functional reports to date, the information of eIF5C from
other insects have been obtained from gene sequencing.

through an assemblage of overlapping nucleic acids. This
included a 57 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 1260 bp
open reading frame and a 340 bp untranslated region in
the 3' UTR, with a 18 bp poly A tail. The ORF encoded a
419 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass
of 48 kDa and a predicated isoelectric point of 6.05. Moreover, there were some putative post-translational modification sites including seven protein kinase c
phosphorylation sites, two tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, three N-myristoylation sites, five casein kinase
II phosphorylation sites and one N-glycosylation site (Fig.
1).
Identification of Ha-eIF5C
The result of the BLASTX analysis suggests that Ha-eIF5C
has certain similarities to various genes, including eIF5C
from Bombyx mori (88%), eIF5C from Apis mellifera (68%),
eIF5C from Aedes aegypti (66%) and eIF5C from D. melanogaster (63%) (Fig. 2). SMART predicted that Ha-eIF5C
protein contains a C-terminal eIF5C domain (326–411
aa) and an N-terminal leucine zipper motif (39–60 aa).
Recombinant expression and purification of Ha-eIF5C
After IPTG induction, the recombinant GST-eIF5C was
expressed in supernatant and purified by Glutathione
Sepharose 4B. The deduced molecular weight of the
recombinant expressed protein was 48 kDa as shown in
Fig. 3. To prepare the antiserum, a gel extraction of recombinant eIF5C after cleavage of GST-eIF5C with thrombin
was used.

Results

Tissue distribution and expression patterns of Ha-eIF5C
To study the tissue distribution of Ha-eIF5C, the total RNA
of the head-thorax, integument, midgut, fatbody and
haemocyte were extracted from 5th 24 h (5th instar larvae
24 h after ecdysis), 5th-HCS (5th instar larvae 36 h after
ecdysis, with head capsule slippage, HCS) and 6th 72 h
(72 h after ecdysis, wandering 0 d, metamorphically committed larva) stage. As shown in Fig. 4, Ha-eIF5C transcript was detected at a high level in the head-thorax,
integument, midgut and fat body but not in haemocytes
in metamorphosis stage. QRT-PCR was utilized to analyze
the expression of Ha-eIF5C in developmental midgut and
fat body. The results showed that there was an obvious
increase in the level of Ha-eIF5C transcript during metamorphosis. The immunoblotting revealed that the expression of Ha-eIF5C protein agreed with the mRNA
transcription (Fig. 5).

Gene cloning and sequence analysis of Ha-eIF5C
Based on the fragment of Ha-eIF5C obtained from suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), the 5' end fragment was obtained using specific reverse primer eIF5CR
and the T3 primer. The 3' end fragment was amplified
with the specific primer eIF5CF and the T7 primer. The
full-length eIF5C of H. armegera (1675 bp) was obtained

Hormonal regulations on Ha-eIF5C
To examine the effect of ecdysone on Ha-eIF5C expression, 6th instar 0 h larvae (6th-0 h, with white head capsule) were injected with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E).
Compared with the control, a 5–6-fold increase in HaeIF5C expression was observed at 1 h and 3 h after the

In this study, we cloned and characterized the eIF5C from
the metamorphic larvae of H. armigera and designated it
as Ha-eIF5C, which contains an N-terminal leucine zipper
motif and a C-terminal eIF5C domain. The expression,
distribution and characterization of Ha-eIF5C were studied by employing Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR),
recombinant expression and immunoblotting analysis.
Likewise, we also investigated the gene's hormonal regulation and its position in the 20E signal transduction
pathway.

challenge. However, the expression level of Ha-eIF5C
started to decline at 6 h and returned to the basal level at
12 h (Fig. 6).
In order to study whether Ha-eIF5C was upregulated
downstream of the 20E-induced transcription cascade, we
knocked down EcR and USP in the HaEpi cell line by
RNAi. After either EcR or USP was knocked down via
RNAi, the transcription of Ha-eIF5C was down regulated
compared with the control and it could not be upregulated anymore by treatment with 20E (Fig. 7).

Immunohistochemistry
To verify the expression and localization of Ha-eIF5C, we
performed an immunohistochemical analysis of the midgut (Fig. 8), fat body and integument (Fig. 9) from feeding
5th larvae (5th-24 h), molting 5th larvae (5th-HCS) and
wandering 6th-96 h larvae (6th-96 h). In the 5th-HCS
stage, the midgut epithelium consisted of larval polyploid
cells (LPC, including columnar and goblet cells) and
intestinal stem cells (ISC) (Fig. 8-K). Larval ISCs are the
progenitors of the adult midgut epithelium. The larval
polyploid cells moving into the lumen from the basement

membrane were replaced by proliferating and differentiating ISCs at 6th-96 h (Fig. 8-L). At this point, groups of
imaginal cells began to form cell layers. Our immunohistochemical analysis shows that Ha-eIF5C was distributed
into both the cytoplasm and nucleus in the midgut during
the feeding 5th, molting 5th and wandering 6th-96 h
stages. Relatively strong fluorescent signals were detected
on the outer peripheries of the midgut epithelium from
worms during 5th instar feeding and molting stage, as
well as the larval polyploid cells and the imaginal cells
from larvae at wandering stage. Likewise, ISCs, muscle
cells and basement membrane were localized in this area.
At the same time, the localization of Ha-eIF5C in the
integument and fat body was detected by immunohistochemistry. During the molting 5th and wandering 6th-96
h (Metamorphic molting), a cascade of physiological
processes occurred. These included the separation of the
old cuticle from the underlying epidermis, followed by
the secretion of a new cuticle beneath the old. Finally, a
shedding of the old exoskeleton occurred (Fig. 9-E, F). It
was obvious that Ha-eIF5C appears localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the epidermis and lipocyte.

Discussion
In this work, we identify a 1675 bp full-length elF5C from
H. armegera. This includes a 1260 bp open reading frame
encoding a 419 amino-acid protein with a predicted
molecular mass of 48 kDa. Protein alignments showed
that Ha-eIF5C and eIF5C from A. aegypti, A. mellifera, D.
melanogaster and B. mori are very similar.
Ha-eIF5C is a phylogenetically conserved protein predicted to contain an N-terminal leucine zipper motif (39–
60 aa) and a C-terminal eIF5C domain (326–411 aa). This
eIF5C domain was first detected at the very C-termini of
the yeast protein GCD6, eIF-2B epsilon and two other
eukaryotic translation initiation factors, eIF-4 gamma and
eIF-5, and may likewise be involved in the interaction of
eIF-2B, eIF-4 gamma and eIF-5 with eIF-2 [11]. Therefore,
this eIF5C domain in Ha-eIF5C implies that Ha-eIF5C
might also function as a novel translation initiation factor.
Leucine zipper motifs are protein-protein dimerization
motifs consisting of heptad repeats of leucine residues
that form a coiled-coil structure [12]. These motifs have
been well described in the context of transcription factors
such as c-Fos and c-Jun, where they mediate homo- and
hetero-dimerization critical for the DNA binding properties of these transcription factors [13]. Proteins containing

leucine zipper motif have been reported to be related with
larval growth, molting and metamorphosis in D. melanogaster [14,8]. Our work provides evidence that the
expression of Ha-eIF5C, which contains a leucine zipper
motif, is upregulated during metamorphosis. We speculate that through its leucine zipper domain, Ha-eIF5C
may be involved in transcriptional regulation during
insect development.
The expression profile of Ha-eIF5C was correlated with
the metamorphic process of H. armigera. In our study, HaeIF5C was upregulated during metamorphosis in the
head-thorax, integument, midgut and fat body. Thummel
[15] reported that apoptotic and autophagic programmed
cell death pathways are involved in tissue histolysis and
remodeling during metamorphosis. Gorski et al. [16] confirmed that programmed cell death in the salivary glands
of D. melanogaster requires active protein synthesis, even

though cell death is a degradative cellular process. Gorski
et al. [16] also found significant upregulation of several
translation-initiation factors.
Molting and metamorphosis of larvae are very important
physiological behaviors in insects, and are governed by
two hormones, namely, 20E and juvenile hormone (JH)
[17]. Wang et al. [18] showed that H. armigera had a similar developmental schedule as compared with Manduca
sexta. 20E levels increase during the late stages of the final
(wandering) instar in M. sexta larvae, before pupal ecdysis,
and then decrease at the pupal ecdysis [1]. The expression
of the Ha-eIF5C transcript went with the titer of 20E and
was enhanced after being injected with 20E, which suggested that it was regulated by 20E in vivo. Moreover, the
fact that the expression level of Ha-eIF5C in HaEpi cell
line decreased after EcR or USP was knocked down demonstrated that Ha-eIF5C was upregulated by 20E via EcR
or USP transcription factor.
Ha-eIF5C appears localized in both the cytoplasm and the
nucleus in the midgut, integument and fat body. However, it was identified as a cytoplasmic protein in D. melanogaster [10]. In light of its function in the initiation phase
of protein synthesis, eIFs were often targeted in the cyto-

tions as a regulator of cotton bollworm development, in
addition to its role as a translation initiation factor.

Methods

plasm. However, some eIFs such as eIF4E are distributed
in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, eIF4E
acts in the rate-limiting step of translation initiation. In
the nucleus, eIF4E facilitates the nuclear export of a subset
of mRNAs. Both of these functions contribute to eIF4E's
ability to oncogenically transform cells [19]. Neither
eIF5C nor eIF4E contain classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) predicted by the bioinformatics method
http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/cgi/var/nair/reson
line.pl. They might act in consonance with some assistant
factors that are imported into the nucleus. Dostie et al.
[20] demonstrated that eIF4E-Transporter (4E-T) is a
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that contains an
eIF4E-binding site, one bipartite NLS and two leucine-rich
nuclear export signals, which mediate the nuclear import
of eIF4E via the importin αβ pathway by a piggy-back
mechanism.

Conclusion
Ha-eIF5C possibly functions as a novel translation initiation factor in protein synthesis just like eIF5C of D. melanogaster. However, it was interesting to find that Ha-eIF5C
was upregulated during metamorphosis. Likewise, it was
equally interesting to discover that the expression of HaeIF5C transcript was enhanced by 20E through EcR and
USP. Thus, we hypothesize that Ha-eIF5C possibly func-

Molecular cloning of Ha-eIF5C gene
A fragment of Ha-eIF5C was obtained by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) using the metamorphically
committed larvae (6th-72, 96 and 120 h) as the tester and
the feeding 5th instar larvae (5th-24 h) as the driver [4].
The full-length cDNA was cloned using the cDNA library
of H. armigera as a template. The 3' end of the gene was
amplified using a gene-specific forward primer, eIF5CF
(5'-aactccagcaagggcaagatg-3') and a T7 primer (5'-taatacgactcactataggg-3'). Similarly, the 5' end of the cDNA was
amplified by a T3 primer (5'-aattaaccctcactaaaggg-3') and
a reverse gene-specific primer eIF5CR (5'-tcttcttcggcgctctgtagc-3').
Sequence analysis
Similarity analysis was performed by BLASTX http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Gene translation and prediction
of the deduced protein were performed by ExPASy Proteomics Server http://www.expasy.ch/tools/, including
compute pI/Mw, TMpred, NetPhos, NetNGlyc and
NetOGlyc. Signal sequence and motif prediction utilized

were performed with ClustalW http://www.ebi.ac.uk/

Recombinant expression and purification
A pair of primers (eIF5CexpF: tactcaggatccatgagtcagaaggtagaaaaac; eIF5CexpR: tactcagtcgacctaatcttcttcttcgccactc)
were designed to amplify the sequence coding for HaeIF5C protein (bold indicates BamH I and Sal I sites,
respectively). The DNA fragment was cut with BamH I and
Sal I, ligated into expression vector pGEX-4T-1 and transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21 host cells.
The recombinant expression of Ha-eIF5C was induced by
0.1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-Thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
Thereafter, the cells were centrifuged (6000 g, 10 min),
resuspended with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS, 140
mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.8 mM
KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and sonicated. The recombinant GST-eIF5C was expressed in
supernatant and purified by Glutathione Sepharose 4B.

the antiserum samples were collected. The specificity of
the antiserum was examined by immunoblotting and the
antiserum was used in all the immunoassay experiments.
Immunoblotting
We followed previously reported procedures [22]. Protein
extracts (100 μg) of the H. armigera tissues were separated
using 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Antiserum against Ha-eIF5C was diluted
1:100 in 2% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 10
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) and the second
antibody of Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated to
goat anti-rabbit IgG was diluted 1:10,000 in the same
blocking buffer (2% non-fat milk in TBS).

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the head-thorax, integument, midgut, fat body and haemocytes at different developmental stages using Unizol reagent according to the
manufacturer' s protocol (Biostar, Shanghai, China). A
total of 5 μg RNA was used to reverse transcribe the first
strand cDNA (First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). It was subsequently used
as a template in the PCR reactions.

SYBR green-based quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR)
analysis was performed using PTC-200 DNA Engine thermal cycler (MJ Research) and chromo4 four-color realtime detector (Bio-Rad, America). The following primers

were used to amplify a specific fragment of 102 bp:
eIF5CF1 (5'-tatggcaatgtgtgatgtcccgtg-3'); eIF5CR1 (5'cagccaacagcggcgtgtaatg-3'). A 150 bp fragment of β-actin
was also amplified as control, with the primers actinF (5'cctggtattgctgaccgtatgc-3') and actinR (5'-ctgttggaaggtggagagggaa-3'). Amplification conditions were 95°C, 2 min;
40 cycles (95°C, 15 s; 62°C, 50 s; incubated at 72°C for 2
s; plate read; incubated at 82°C for 2 s; plate read); melting curve from 60°C to 95°C, read every 0.5°C, hold 1 s.
The data provided from real-time PCR instrumentation
were then prepared for input into Microsoft Excel and
analyzed using the 2-ΔCT method [23].
Hormonal regulation of Ha-eIF5C
The 6th instar 0 h larvae (6th-0 h) were injected with steroid 20E (500 ng/larva). 20E was first dissolved to 10 mg/
ml in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and then diluted into
0.1 mg/ml with PBS when injecting worms. Untreated
controls were only injected by equivalent amounts of carrier. Total RNA of the midgut was extracted from the
injected worms at different developmental periods. A
comparison of the differences between the control and the
challenged was done by RT-PCR with gene specific primers: eIF5CF1 (5'-tatggcaatgtgtgatgtcccgtg-3'); eIF5CR (5'tcttcttcggcgctctgtagc-3'). The following procedure was
employed: one cycle (94°C, 2 min); 26 cycles (94°C, 30
s; 53°C, 45 s; 72°C, 45 s), followed by a last cycle (72°C,
10 min). The β-actin gene was used for normalization.
Each experiment was repeated three times independently.
Ratios of Ha-eIF5C to β-actin were calculated with Quantity One (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
RNAi
The primers of EcRRNAiF1 (5'-gcgtaatacgactcactataggcgctggtataacaacggagga-3') and EcRRNAiR1 (5'-gcgtaatacgactcactataggagctggagacaactcctcacg-3'),
EcRRNAiF2
(5'cgctggtataacaacggagga-3') and EcRRNAiR2 (5'-agctggagacaactcctcacg-3'), USPRNAiF1 (5'-gcgtaatacgactcactataggcgaaccatcccctaagtggttc-3')
and
USPRNAiR1
(5'gcgtaatacgactcactataggccttgatgagcaggatctggtc-3');
USPRNAiF2
(5'-cgaaccatcccctaagtggttc-3')
and
USPRNAiR2 (5'-ccttgatgagcaggatctggtc-3'); GFPRNAiF1
(5'-gcgtaatacgactcactataggtggtcccaattctcgtggaac-3')
and
GFPRNAiR1 (5'-gcgtaatacgactcactataggcttgaagttgaccttgatgcc-3'); GFPRNAiF2 (5'-tggtcccaattctcgtggaac-3') and
GFPRNAiR2 (5'-cttgaagttgaccttgatgcc-3') were used for
PCR to amplify the gene fragments. PCR products were
purified using a PCR purification kit. dsRNA was synthesized using the MEGAscript™ RNAi kit (Ambion Inc, Ausdin, USA). The procedures of culturing HaEpi cell line and
RNAi were performed according to Shao et al. [24]. The
green fluorescence protein (GFP) was used as control.

dehyde at 4°C. The tissues were dehydrated with a graded
series of ethanol. Protein digestion was performed by
incubating with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 15 min at
37°C. Sections were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), incubated with a primary antibody against
Ha-eIF5C diluted to 1:100, and then with a goat anti-rabbit-ALEXA 488 antibody (Eugene, United States) diluted
to 1:1000 in PBS with 2% BSA at room temperature for 30
min. The nuclei were stained with 4'-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1 μg/mL in water, San
Jose, United States) for 10 min. Negative controls were
treated in the same manner, but pre-immune rabbit
serum was used in place of the antiserum against HaeIF5C. Fluorescence was detected with an Olympus BX51
fluorescence microscope.
