Evolution of MIR159/319 microRNA genes and
their post-transcriptional regulatory link to siRNA
pathways
Yang Li1,2, Chaoqun Li3, Guohui Ding4 and Youxin Jin1,2*

Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are prevalent and important endogenous gene regulators in eukaryotes. MiR159
and miR319 are highly conserved miRNAs essential for plant development and fertility. Despite high similarity in
conservation pattern and mature miRNA sequences, miR159 and miR319 have distinct expression patterns, targets
and functions. In addition, both MIR319 and MIR159 precursors produce multiple miRNAs in a phased loop-to-base
manner. Thus, MIR159 and MIR319 appear to be related in origin and considerably diverged. However the
phylogeny of MIR159 and MIR319 genes and why such unusual style of miRNA production has been conserved
during evolution is not well understood.
Results: We reconstructed the phylogeny of MIR159/319 genes and analyzed their mature miRNA expression. The
inferred phylogeny suggests that the MIR159/319 genes may have formed at least ten extant early-branching
clades through gene duplication and loss. A series of duplications occurred in the common ancestor of seed plants
leading to the original split of flowering plant MIR159 and MIR319. The results also indicate that the expression of
MIR159/319 is regulated at post-transcriptional level to switch on the expression of alternative miRNAs during
development in a highly spatio-temporal specific manner, and to selectively respond to the disruption of defensive
siRNA pathways. Such intra-stem-loop regulation appears diverged across the early-branching clades of MIR159/319
genes.
Conclusions: Our results support that the MIR159 and MIR319 genes evolve from a common ancestor, which is
likely to be a phased stem-loop small RNA. Through duplication and loss of genes this miRNA gene family formed
clades specific to moss, lycopods, gymnosperms and angiosperms including the two major clades of flowering
plants containing the founding members of MIR319 and MIR159 genes in A.thaliana. Our analyses also suggest that
some MIR159/319 have evolved into unusual miRNA genes that are regulated at post-transcriptional level to
express multiple mature products with variable proportions under different circumstances. Moreover, our analyses
reveal conserved regulatory link of MIR159/319 genes to siRNA pathway through post-transcriptional regulation.

Background
MicroRNA is a class of approximately 21-nucleotide (nt)
small RNA that regulate endogenous gene expression in
eukaryotes ranging from single cellular green alga to
mammals and flowering plants. Many biological processes including development, senescence, metabolism
and stress responses are regulated by miRNAs [1,2]. In
plants, miRNAs are distinguished from other small
RNAs in that they are excised precisely from specific

positions on stem-loop precursors by DICER-LIKE 1
(DCL1) with the assistance of HYL1 and SERRATE
[2,3]. The mature miRNAs are 2’-o-methylated at 3’ end
by HEN1 and exported into cytoplasm. After being
loaded into RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) the
miRNAs anneal to the complementary sites on target
mRNAs to impose translational repression or/and cleavage of target mRNAs [2].
MiR159 and miR319 are highly conserved miRNAs
that play important roles in plant growth, morphogenesis and reproduction [4]. In Arabidopsis, the 21-nt
mature miR159 and miR319 share 17 identical

nucleotides. However, they have distinct target genes
due to sequence specificity and different expression patterns [5]. MiR159 restricts the expression of some MYB
transcription factors, while miR319 targets a subset of
TCP transcription factor genes [5-8]. Expression of
miR159 is abundant and widespread over the whole
plant, while miR319 is expressed at much lower level
and confined to specific tissues and developmental
stages [9]. MiR159 can not induce mRNA cleavage of
the miR319-targeted TCP transcription factors due to
sequence specificity. Although the miR319 can also
mediate the cleavage of MYB33 and MYB65 mRNAs,
miR319 does not normally make significant contribution
to the regulation of MYB because of its low and specialized expression [5]. The interplay of miR159 and its target MYB is involved in the regulation of vegetative
growth, flowering time, anther development, seed shape
and germination [8,10,11]. In contrast to miR159,
miR319 and corresponding targets regulate embryonic
patterning, jasmonate synthesis, leaf morphogenesis and
senescence [6,12,13]. A recent study also showed the
regulatory role of miR319 in the development of petal
and stamen [14].
A distinguished feature of the MIR159 and MIR319
genes conserved from moss to flowering plant is that
their stem-loop precursors usually have elongated stem
structure. A loop-proximal segment on the MIR159/319
stem-loop precursor outside of the miRNA and miRNA*
is also conserved, albeit to a much weaker extent
[6,15,16]. Recent studies show that the MIR159 and
MIR319 precursors are processed from loop to base to
liberate three phased miRNA duplexes [15,17,18]. The
miR319 or miR159 can not be efficiently excised without correct processing of the loop-proximal miRNA
duplex [17]. According to this scenario, when miR159
or miR319 duplexes are produced the same amount of
miRNAs derived from the other two duplexes must be
generated. However, only the mature miR159 or miR319
are abundantly expressed while the alternative miRNAs
are expressed at low levels, indicating that only miR159
or miR319 are incorporated into RISC and stabilized.
Conservation of such an uncommon pattern in biogenesis during the long time evolution of land plants is
inexplicable by the known function of miR159 and
miR319. The underlying significance of such unusual
style of maturation for the MIR159/319 genes remains
unknown.
With similarities in sequence, conservation pattern
and biogenesis, miR159 and miR319 might originate
from a common ancestor. Conversely, differences in
expression patterns, target genes and functions indicate
that miR159 and miR319 are evolutionarily distinct
groups. Although clear evidences are absent to support
the common origin of miR159 and miR319 [5], they are

categorized into one miRNA gene family in the miRbase
and some other studies [7,19]. Hypothesis has been proposed that the miR159 might evolve from miR319
because miR159 seems more specialized in the spectrum
of targets [5]. However, the phylogeny of the two
hypothesized subfunctionalized groups remains
unknown.
In order to study the evolution of MIR159/319 family
in land plants, we collected and analyzed a broad set of
MIR159/319 stem-loops from a wide range of plant species. Then, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of
MIR159/319 from a structural alignment using RNA
models for paired and unpaired nucleotides, thus revealing the evolutionary history of this miRNA gene family.
Our analysis also suggests that post-transcriptional regulations of MIR159/319 expression have evolved during
plant evolution, through which MIR159/319 miRNAs
respond to defensive siRNA deficiency. This provides
explanations for the conserved three-duplex dicing of
the MIR159/319 precursors as a framework for an
unknown product-tunable mechanism controlling output from their stem-loops. Taken together, our analysis
revealed the evolutionary history of MIR159/319 genes,
conservation and variability of post-transcriptional regulation across their extant clades during phylogeny.

Results
Homology search for MIR159/319 genes

In order to get a comprehensive view of the MIR159/
319 gene evolution in land plants, we performed homology search like previous studies to collect the MIR159/
319 stem-loop sequences from available data resources
as exhaustive as possible [7,16,20] (see Methods). Along
with the published sequences, we obtained 251 MIR159/
319 genes and 27 candidates from 76 land plant species
(Figure 1 and Additional File 1). Notice that 3 genes
from two species, Oryza alta and Oryza glaberrima, in
Figure 1 are not included and analyzed further because
full-length stem-loop sequence could not be retrieved
from the database. MIR159/319 genes from most of the
major land plant clades are obtained making it possible
for an informative phylogenetic reconstruction.
Classification of MIR159/319 genes according to
conservation pattern

In the species of Brassicaceae closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana, the most conserved part of MIR319
genes is the sequence of the precursor stem-loop [21],
which is also conserved in distantly related species
[6,15,16]. Mutations accumulated in the miRNA stemloops during evolution may provide useful information
for inferring the phylogeny of miRNA families with
ancient origin. We aligned the MIR159/319 stem-loops
considering both sequence and RNA secondary

structure by a semi-automated strategy (see Methods).
We found that not all MIR159/319 precursors have conserved elongated stem and can be well-aligned in the
loop-proximal regions. According to sequence and
structural conservation of the loop-proximal regions, we
classified the MIR159/319 genes into 5 types (Table 1
and Figure 2). Type 1 stem-loops show a “bi-duplex”

conservation pattern similar to previously discovered
[6,15,16]. However we observed much stronger conservation in the loop-proximal regions (Figure 3). Clearly,
two duplexes are conserved in both sequence and secondary structure across 71 land plant species from moss
to flowering plants (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Table 1). The
structural logo shows pronounced similarity in the two

loop-proximal regions comparable to that of the miR*
region, unlike the poorly conservation of these regions
found previously [6,16] (Figure 3 and Additional file 2).
This is probably due to the preclusion of other types of
MIR159/319, which do not have well-conserved loopproximal regions. Consensus structure and nucleotides
were predicted for the type 1 MIR159/319 genes. Ten
consensus base-pairs were detected including a highly
conserved U:A pair in the loop proximal regions (Figure
3 and Additional file 2). Noticeably, there is a consensus
interior loop in the duplex of miR159/319 and the corresponding miRNA* indicating that selection pressure
favor the structural pattern as a whole. Nine partitions
can be assigned in the type 1 MIR159/319 stem-loops
according to conservation pattern. There are four conserved partitions: miR, miR*, Alternative Conserved
Region at 5’arm (ACR5) and 3’arm (ACR3), which
accommodate most of the conserved paired or unpaired
nucleotides. The conserved partitions are separated by
five space partitions (sp1 to sp5) (Figure 3 and Additional file 2). This type is the most widely distributed,
while the other types do not have well-conserved loopproximal duplexes and exist only in a few plant species
(Figure 2, Figure 3, Table. 1, and Additional file 1).
The remaining types are with degenerated ACRs (type
3 and type 4) or even lacking these two regions (type 2
and type 5). Type 2 stem-loops appear as in a shortened
form without the elongated part probably due to deletion (Table 1 and Figure 2). Sequences of the loop-proximal regions are conserved in type 3 stem-loops (Table
1 and Figure 2). However the secondary structure is disrupted. The elongated stem is maintained in type 4
stem-loops, but sequence similarity in the region corresponding to ACR of type 1 is too weak to be identifiable
(Table 1 and Figure 2). Type 5 stem-loops do not have
identifiable ACR sequences and the elongated stem is
interrupted by multi-loops (Table 1 and Figure 2).

Figure 2 Examples of the five types of MIR159/319 precursor
stem-loops. The sequences corresponding to the four conserved
partitions are highlighted: red, miR; blue, miR*; green, ACR5; orange,
ACR3. Notice that the conserved regions may have slight differences
from the true miRNA:miRNA* duplexes.

Conservation of the type 1 MIR159/319 genes across
land plants indicates the origin of MIR159 and MIR319
from a long stem-loop. The type 2 to 5 MIR159/319
genes seems to be variants evolving from type 1. During
evolution, the loop-proximal part on their precursor
stem-loops may degenerate in sequence and/or structural conservation to different extent. Since the processing of miR159/319 genes depends on correct
processing of the loop-proximal duplex [17], these
MIR159/319 genes may lose their activity due to unsuccessful processing. For example, the processing of athMIR159c, which is a type 4 gene, is far less efficient
than that of its paralogues [5]. Likewise, mutations

outside of the mature miR319 may lead to failure in the
processing of MIR319 in B.oleracea [21]. Therefore,
some if not all type 2 to 5 MIR159/319 genes might be
“pseudo-miRNA” genes unable to produce mature
miRNAs.
Phylogeny of the MIR159/319 genes

During evolution the manner of base substitutions in
structured RNA is different from that in protein-coding
sequences. The selections for mutations in structured
RNA mainly arise from base-pairings to maintain the
RNA structures while in protein-coding sequences selection pressure disadvantages mutations in triplet codes
that disrupt protein functions through alteration of
amino-acids. Based on the structural alignment and consensus RNA secondary structure of the type 1 MIR159/
319 genes, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree using
a combination of GTR and doublet models in a Bayesian
approach [22]. A well-supported consensus tree was
obtained (Additional file 3). The three A.thaliana
MIR319 paralogues are far more distantly related to
each other than that of the ath-MIR159a and athMIR159b in the tree, consistent with the inference from
the miRNA-carrying segmental duplications in Arabidopsis [23]. The observation that ath-MIR159a and athMIR159b have very similar expression patterns and are
functionally redundant while the three MIR319 paralogues have distinct expression patterns also supports the
inferred relative distances among the paralogues of
MIR159 and MIR319 in A.thaliana [10,14]. In addition,
the relationships of ath-MIR319b with its sense and
antisense duplicates were correctly resolved in the tree
(Additional file 3). These observations provide additional
supports for the reliability of the inferred phylogenetic
tree.
Using moss, the earliest-branching clade in land
plants, as out group, phylogeny of the MIR159/319

could be determined. The MIR159/319 genes from
moss, lycopod, gymnosperms and angiosperms can be
clearly separated into 10 major clades (Figure 4 and
Additional file 3). All extant MIR159/319 genes of moss
derive from the earliest branching clade (Figure 4 and
Additional file 3). The smo-MIR319 and smo-MIR159
are two extant genes of two clades branching before the
emergence of seed plants (Figure 4 and Additional file
3). After the diversification of lycopod MIR319 and
MIR159, clades of MIR159/319 specific to either gymnosperm or angiosperm formed (Figure 4 and Additional file 3). In flowering plants, there are two earlybranching clades leading to the founding members of
MIR159 and MIR319 identified in A.thaliana respectively [6,24] (Figure 4 and Additional file 3).
Duplication and loss of genes are deduced from the
tree using the criteria that duplications increase the
number of paralogues in one clade, while gene losses
were inferred by the absence of an ancestral gene in
descendant clades. Because the split of orthologous
genes must predate or accompany the split of related
species that carry them, the time of the duplications
relative to the emergence of new plant clades can be
deduced. Six duplications can be deduced from the condensed tree showing early-branching clades, one in the
common ancestor of vascular plants and five in the
common ancestor of seed plants (Figure 4). The tree
shows that the split of the MIR319 and MIR159 clades
in flowering plants and gymnosperms originated from a
series of duplications occurring in the common ancestor
of seed plants (Figure 4). This suggests that the MIR319
and MIR159 genes classified by the founding members
identified in A.thaliana originated from a common
ancestor, which may have emerged after the split of
moss and lycopod MIR159/319 clades. The two angiosperm MIR319 clades branched earlier than the angiosperm MIR159 clades. Subsequent duplications led to the

formation of gymnosperm clades and angiosperm
MIR159 clades (Figure 4). Six possible losses in the
major clades of MIR159/319 can be deduced from the
condensed tree, one in lycopod and five in gymnosperms and angiosperms (Figure 4). Because our analyses
do not include all the species in a given clade and entire
genomes are only available for a small number of species, the deduced gene losses are incomprehensive and
indicate only the possible inclination of gene evolution
in the species examined. However, deduced losses are of
high confidence in the species for which genome-wide
scan of MIR159/319 gene have been performed (see
methods). Of the six possible losses, four are supported
by the absence of ancestral MIR159/319 genes in one or
more species where the entire genomes were examined
(Figure 4). The other two losses are deduced to have
occurred in gymnosperms whose whole genome
sequences are currently not available (Figure 4). Therefore, these two losses and loss of gymnosperm MIR159/
319 in ‘early branching eudicot MIR319’ need to be verified in the future using the whole genomes of gymnosperm species (Figure 4). Considering the current data,
these gene losses may have occurred in an interleaved
manner that descendant species mutually lost the equivalent of extant genes in other descendant species after
gene duplications in their common ancestor. It appears
that clade-specific groups of MIR159/319 genes may
have formed through the dynamics of gene duplications
in ancestors and gene losses in descendants as opposed
to the divergence of one ancestral gene into orthologues.
The duplications and subsequent losses that occurred

before the split of monocots and eudicots are more frequent in the MIR319 clade than the MIR159, indicating
that the two clades might have evolved in different ways
(Figure 4 and Additional file 3).
Shift in the proportion of mature MIR159/319 products
during ontogeny

MIR159/319 precursors are processed in a phased manner to produce three miRNA duplexes [15,17,18]. We
examined the expression of MIR159/319 in 54 publicly
available small RNA sequencing databases from 20 species (Additional file 4). Interestingly, the partitions
defined by conservation pattern are consistent with the
phasing of mature miRNAs from MIR159/319 stemloops in that very few reads have lower than 80% overlap with any partition (Additional file 4). In most cases,
miR159/319 take up the majority of the sequencing
reads, while miRNAs from miR*, ACR5 and ACR3 are
expressed at much lower levels. The expressions of
space partitions are even lower or undetectable (Additional file 4). We refer to this previously identified profile as ‘canonical proportions’ [17]. However, there are a
few non-canonical situations. When we analyze the
expressions of MIR159/319 using data from AtSBS [25],
we found that in the inflorescence tissues of five-weekold Arabidopsis thaliana, the predominant mature products of ath-MIR319a are ACR3 miRNAs, while the
ath-MIR319b mainly expresses ACR3 and miR* miRNAs
(Figure 5A). In contrast, the ath-MIR159 genes primarily
generate miR159 (Additional file 5A). In the flowering
tissues of the closely related species Arabidopsis lyrata,

the non-canonical expression of MIR319 was also supported by two databases [GEO:GSE20442, GEO:
GSE20662] from two independent studies using SOLiD
and Illumina Genome Analyzer respectively [26,27] (Figure 5B and Additional file 5C). In consensus, expressions of the ACR3 miRNAs are promoted and higher
than the miR319 in aly-MIR319c/d, albeit differences in
the expressions of aly-MIR319a and aly-MIR319b
between the two databases, which is probably due to
sampling of the tissues at different stages. In [GEO:
GSE20442], the miR319* is significantly higher than
miR319 and ACR3 of aly-MIR319a is lower than alyMIR319b (Figure 5B). In [GEO:GSE20662], miR319a/b
is more abundant than miR319a/b* and ACR3 of alyMIR319a is higher than aly-MIR319b (Additional file
5C). Small RNA sequencing from seed coats and cotyledons of Glycine max [GEO:GSE21825] suggests that
gma-MIR159 express ACR3 miRNAs at levels similar to
or higher than miR159 in these tissues [28] (Figure 5C).
In Nicotiana Tabacum plants, data from Comparative
Sequencing of Plant Small RNAs (CSPSR) showed noncanonical expressions of both MIR159 and MIR319 [29]
(Figure 5D). However, in the case of nta-MIR319, the
ACR5 miRNA is the most abundant in flower but not in
pod (Figure 5D). We also found ACR5-predominant
expression of MIR319 in Solanum lycopersicum using
data from CSPSR [29] (Figure 5E). Again using CSPSR
data [29], non-canonical expression of MIR319 was
observed in Vitis vinifera (Figure 5F).
Recently, the Parallel Analyses of RNA Ends (PARE)
technology was used to detect cleavage products of
miRNA targets that contain a phosphate at 5’ end by
deep sequencing [25,30]. Processing intermediates of
miRNA precursor can also be detected by PARE [25].
The differences of miRNA production between MIR159
and MIR319 are also supported by data from Arabidopsis PARE database [25] (Figure 6). For MIR319 precursors, the most abundantly sequenced cleavage site was
the 5’ end of ACR3 miRNAs. However, 5’end of miR159
was the most frequently sequenced site for MIR159 precursors. This coincided with the data from AtSBS (Figure 5A, Figure 6 and Additional file 5A) [25]. Because
small RNA sequencing and PARE are different technologies in nature, the observed differential expressions of
MIR159 and MIR319 in Arabidopsis inflorescence are
unlikely to be resulted from biased sequencing. Interestingly, the detected cleavages occur predominantly within
the stem-loop pre-miRNAs (Figure 6). This indicates
that the MIR159/319 primary transcripts might be processed into miRNA duplexes directly without the preceding step to liberate the stem-loop precursors
consistent with the findings of Chekanova et al. [31].
We also observed the switching on of the MIR159 or
MIR319 ACR miRNA expression in monocots. In rice,

Page 8 of 18

analyses using high throughput small RNA sequencing
data deposited under [GEO:GSE14462] suggest that osaMIR159a mainly produces ACR3 miRNAs in the flag
leaves (Figure 5G), which is an organ important for
grain filling and protection of the spike from being
eroded by pathogens. Sequencing data from [GEO:
GSE23217] suggest that ACR3 miRNA is the major product of osa-MIR319 in rice seedlings [32] (Figure 5H).
In maize, a shift in the proportion of mature MIR319
products was observed in the tissues of shoots and roots
using the data from [GEO:GSE15286] [33] (Figure 5I).
Such a transition is not observed for maize MIR159
(Additional file 5H). Another two examples of noncanonical expression of monocot MIR159/319 come
from CSPSR data [29] (Figure 5J and 5K). In Hordeum
vulgare plants, expression level of MIR159 ACR3
miRNA is higher than miR159 in leaves but not in
inflorescence tissues, indicating shift of mature product
proportions in the two tissues (Figure 5J). In flower and
young panicle of Sorghum bicolor, ACR3 miRNAs are
more abundant than miR319 (Figure 5K). These results
indicate that both in eudicots and monocots, the major
products of MIR159 or MIR319 genes shift to ACR
miRNAs in a highly spatio-temporal specific manner
during plant development. This is likely to occur
through post-transcriptional mechanisms, because the
proportion of the multiple mature products can not be
changed solely via transcriptional regulations. In some
cases, shift in strand selection also occurred. When
sequencing tags can not be unambiguously assigned to a
unique MIR159/319 stem-loop, such as maize MIR319
genes in Figure 5I, related paralogues are analyzed collectively. In this case, the observed shift in mature product proportion could possibly be attributed to downor up-regulation at transcriptional level of different
paralogues with fixed mature product proportions. However, there must be a post-transcriptional mechanism to
distinguish different paralogues so that they produce
multiple mature miRNAs in different proportions.
For the gymnosperms and earlier-branching clades,
lycopod and moss, we also analyzed the expressions of
the MIR159/319 genes using small RNA sequencing
data from CSPSR and [GEO:GSE5103, GEO:GSE7320,
GEO:GSE12468] [15,29,34]. In Cycas rumphii leaves, the
three phased miRNAs at 3’ arm, ACR3, sp4 and miR159
are expressed at significant levels, among which ACR3
is the most abundant (Figure 5L). In the lycopod S.moellendorffii, the predominant products of both smoMIR159 and smo-MIR319 are ACR5 miRNAs, consistent with the distance in the inferred phylogenetic tree
(Figure 4, Figure 5M and Additional file 5J). The proportion of mature products from the moss MIR319 differs from all other clades in that the ACR miRNAs are
rarely expressed while the sp2 and sp4 miRNAs are

expressed at significantly higher level (Figure 5N and
Additional file 5K). Because the sp2 miRNA of pptMIR319d is abundantly expressed, this miRNA is annotated as ppt-miR319d*.2 [15,35,36]. This is consistent
with our analysis. In 10-day-old moss protonemata the
miR319* are the most abundant products (Figure 5N).
The distinct proportion of mature products from the
MIR159/319 genes in different clades suggests that the
post-transcriptional control of MIR159/319 gene output
may have diverged during evolution accounting for the
variability of mature miRNA expression profiles of this
family.
Selective up-regulation of mature MIR159/319 miRNAs in
siRNA-deficient mutants

In plants, genomic repeats are silenced by approximately
24-nt rasiRNAs whose expression depends on the RDR2
and DCL3 proteins [37,38]. Unexpectedly, we found that

in siRNA-deficient mutants of species from eudicot,
monocot and moss MIR159/319 miRNAs are selectively
up-regulated. Using AtSBS data [25], we found that in
the inflorescence tissues of 5-week-old A.thaliana rdr2
mutants and dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 (dcl234) triple mutants, the
expressions of the ath-MIR319a and ath-MIR319b
ACR3 miRNAs are much higher than the case in wild
type, over 100 fold for ath-MIR319a and approximately
8 fold for ath-MIR319b (Figure 7A and Additional file
6A). In contrast, the increased miR319 and miR319*
expression is undistinguishable from the enrichment of
the 20~21-nt sRNAs in these mutants (Figure 7A). Analyses using data from [GEO:GSE6682] reproduce this
phenomenon with the difference that miR159 levels are
also up-regulated when the rasiRNA pathway is disrupted (Figure 7B and Additional file 6B) [39]. Consistently in both databases the increased levels for ACR
miRNAs of ath-MIR319a are higher than that of ath-

MIR319b (Figure 7 A and B). Because the two small
RNA sequencing data resources were produced using
different methods, 454 for [GEO:GSE6682] and Solexa
for AtSBS [25,39], the observed selective up-regulation
is unlikely to be bias of sequencing. The selective upregulation of MIR319 ACR miRNAs is absent in dcl3
single mutants (Figure 7B and Additional file 6B), probably due to redundant DCL activities [38,40]. We also
examined the expression of MIR159/319 in maize using

data from MaizeSBS [41]. Similarly in the small ears
(flowers) of maize mop1/rdr2 mutants, the expression of
MIR319 ACR miRNAs is selectively up-regulated (Figure
7C and Additional file 6C). In the dcl3 mutant of the
moss P. patens, the overall abundance of miRNAs does
not increase [34]. Using the same small RNA sequencing data, it can be observed that the miR319 increased
approximately seven-fold and became the most abundant mature product of MIR319 gene (Figure 7D and

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:122
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/122

Additional file 6D). The sp2 miRNAs also increased
more than four-fold (Figure 7D). In rdr6 mutants, in
which tasiRNAs are depleted without affecting the
miRNA abundance [34], only the sp2 miRNAs increased
approximately seven-fold (Figure 7D). These results suggest that the accumulation of specific MIR159/319 miRNAs, e.g., the ACR miRNAs in flowering plants, is
regulated either directly or indirectly by siRNA pathways
at the post-transcriptional level. This connection
between the siRNA and miRNA pathways might have
an ancient origin.

Discussion
From the evolutionary perspective, miRNAs are generally classified into highly conserved ancient miRNAs and
weakly conserved species- or clade-specific miRNAs [2].
The phylogeny of highly conserved miRNA genes is largely unknown including the ancient miRNA gene family
– MIR319 and MIR159, which play important roles in
plant development [5]. The miR319 and miR159 were
identified in independent studies using different methods [6,24]. Homologues identified in following studies
are classified into two groups according to sequence
similarity to the miR319 and miR159 founding members
[19]. Although miR159 and miR319 are seemingly
related in evolution, because of their similarity in
mature miRNA sequence, secondary structure, conservation pattern and biogenesis, their origin is still unclear
[5,17]. Evolution of MIR319 genes in closely related
Brassicaceae species has been studied revealing that the
stem-loop and an upstream element of MIR319 are
recalcitrant to fast mutations while sequences of other
parts are highly variable [21]. We aligned a large number of land plant MIR159/319 stem-loops and reconstructed the phylogenetic tree. Our results support a
common origin of MIR159 and MIR319 from two
aspects. First, another duplex outside miR159/319 are
highly conserved in most MIR159 and MIR319 stemloops across land plants (Figure 2, Figure 3, Table 1 and
Additional file 2). Moreover, partitions defined by the
conserved regions are consistent with the phasing of
mature MIR159/319 miRNAs from moss to flowering
plants [17,18] (Figure 3 and Additional file 4). These
observations suggest that MIR159 and MIR319 originated from a common phased stem-loop RNA similar
to those discovered in the green alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii and rice recently [42-44]. Second, the
inferred phylogenetic tree shows that the MIR159 and
MIR319 founding members in A.thaliana evolve from
two early-branching clades specific to flowering plants,
which derived from the common ancestor of seed plant
MIR159/319 (Figure 4 and Additional file 3). The tree
also shows that the angiosperm MIR319 major clade
branched earlier than the angiosperm MIR159 clade

Page 11 of 18

(Figure 4). This is consistent with the finding that
miR159 is more specialized in target spectrum than the
miR319 in A.thaliana [5].
The inferred phylogenetic tree reveals the evolutionary
history of extant MIR159/319 branches, which might be
dated back to the first colonization of land plants about
450 Ma (million years ago). It can be inferred that
extensive duplications of MIR159/319 genes might have
occurred in the common ancestor of gymnosperms and
angiosperms about 370 Ma, in the period of late Devonian to early Carboniferous. These duplications initialized the split of MIR159 and MIR319 in flowering
plants. It has been shown that major body-plan innovations during animal phylogeny are concomitant with
miRNA repertoire expansions [45]. Hypothesis has been
proposed that expansion of miRNAs may contribute to
the improvement of body-plan complexity [45,46].
Whether similar scenario is also the case in plants is
unknown. From the phylogenetic tree, it can be inferred
that an expansion of MIR159/319 family genes might be
commitment with the evolution of seed-bearing plants
(Figure 4). Recent studies have shown that both miR159
and miR319 play important roles in reproductive growth
of flowering plants [8,14], indicating their functional
relatedness to the evolution of seed bearing in plants. It
has been shown in both plants and animals that miRNA
repertoire encoded in the genome is in the dynamics of
genesis and loss of miRNA genes during evolution
[39,47,48]. Some new born miRNA genes seem to be
targetless and evolutionarily transient, likely to serve as
resources for the selection of functional miRNAs
[39,47]. Similarly, from the phylogenetic tree of
MIR159/319 family, we found this ancient miRNA
family underwent dynamics of duplication and loss,
through which clade or species-specific miRNA gene
subgroups have formed. Specifically, during evolution
clade-specific subgroups formed in the manner that specific members of the expanded gene family maintained
in a given descendant clade were lost in sister clades.
Moreover, duplicated gene members maintained in one
clade of plants, e.g. miR159 and miR319 in flowering
plants, tend to diverge into subfunctionalized groups
improving the complexity of miRNA regulation. Similarly, the three members of Arabidopsis miR319, which
arose from more recent duplications, also diverged into
genes with distinct expression patterns and possibly different functions [14].
The ACR miRNAs are much more variable than the
miR159 or miR319 (Figure 3), indicating different selection pressure imposed on the two miRNAs on the same
stem-loop. Moreover, a small number of MIR159/319
genes (type 2 to 5) lost conservation of the loop-proximal part corresponding to the ACRs of type 1. Since the
correct processing of the loop-proximal miRNA duplex

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:122
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/122

is the prerequisite for the dicing of miR159 or miR319
[17], the ACR-lacking MIR159/319 might become
pseudo genes unable to produce mature miRNAs like
the ath-MIR159c, which can not be efficiently processed
when transformed into plants [5]. Alternatively, the
expression of non-type-1 MIR159/319 genes might be
highly spatio-temporal specific or inducible under specific conditions. Since the non-type 1 MIR159/319 genes
are rare and we did not find exact evidence that any
species only keep non-type 1 MIR159/319 in their genomes, the non-type 1 MIR159/319 genes might derive
from type 1.
With regulatory roles in gene expression, expression
of miRNAs is also regulated delicately. Many miRNAs
are expressed in specific population of cells dedicated to
certain functions during development [1,2]. In animals,
growing evidences suggest that miRNA expression is
not only regulated at transcriptional level but also at
post-transcriptional level. The processing of specific primiRNAs by the microprocessor is regulated via diverse
mechanisms in various biological processes [49].
Recently, selective stabilization of miRNAs by 3’-terminal adenylation has been reported revealing post-dicing
regulation of miRNA abundance by synthesis and degradation homeostasis [50]. However, plant genomes do
not possess genes encoding protein factors equivalent to
Drosha in animals, which is the RNase III enzyme catalyzing pri- to pre-miRNA cleavage [2]. Question arises
whether post-transcriptional mechanisms have also
evolved in plants to control the expression of specific
miRNAs. Variegated dependencies on miRNA pathway
components of miRNA accumulations indicate that
there might be miRNA-specific regulations at post-transcriptional steps in plant miRNA biogenesis and stability. For example, it has been reported that null or
hypomorphic alleles of DCL1, AGO1, SERRATE, DRB1,
ABH1 and CBP20 have different impact on the accumulation of distinct miRNA subsets [51-54]. A family of
exoribonucleases responsible for the degradation of
plant miRNAs is identified, indicating that mature miRNAs can also be regulated through degradation in plants
[55]. We found spatio-temporal specific shifts in the
proportion of miRNA products within MIR159/319
stem-loop precursors during development (Figure 5, Figure 6 and Additional file 5). Expression analysis also
showed selective up-regulation of mature MIR159/319
miRNAs in siRNA-deficient mutants of moss and flowering plants (Figure 7 and Additional file 6). These
observations provide evidences for the evolution of
miRNA-specific post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in plants.
Across the major clades of MIR159/319 genes (Figure
4), the post-transcriptional regulation of miRNA production seems to be diverged. First, general proportions

Page 12 of 18

of MIR159/319 mature miRNAs are distinct for the
early-branching clades. Moss MIR159/319 genes have
pronounced expression in sp2 and sp4 miRNAs. Lycopod MIR159/319 genes produce ACR miRNAs in higher
levels than miR159/319 in normal state. The gymnosperm Cycas rumphii MIR159 produce three phased
miRNAs at comparable levels from 3’ arm of the stemloop precursor in leaves (Figure 5L). In most cases,
angiosperm MIR319 and MIR159 generate miR319 or
miR159 as major products (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Additional file 4). Second, genes from angiosperm major
MIR319 clade and major MIR159 clade can have different proportions of mature miRNAs in specific organs of
the same plant (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Additional file 5).
Third, genes from different early-branching MIR159/319
clades have different responsiveness to the siRNA deficiency in the mature miRNA expressions (Figure 4 and
Figure 7). In addition, paralogues in one early-branching
MIR159/319 clade also show differences in tissue-specific proportion of mature miRNAs and responsiveness to
siRNA deficiency. For example, the proportion of athMIR319a ACR3 miRNA is much higher in 5-week-old
inflorescence than that of ath-MIR319b (Figure 5A).
The paralogues of MIR319 also showed distinct expressions in A.lyrata (Figure 5B and Additional file 5C). In
siRNA deficiency mutants, ACR3 miRNA of athMIR319a is up-regulated to much higher level than that
of ath-MIR319b (Figure 7A and B). Such differences in
their expressions are consistent with the inferred phylogenetic distance and different tissue specific expression
patterns of ath-MIR319a and ath-MIR319b reported
recently [14] (Additional file 3). These observations suggest that the post-transcriptional regulation of MIR159/
319 may have specialized during evolution and can
serve as another feature that could distinguish their
subgroups.
In addition to the small RNAs dedicated to endogenous gene regulation in normal developmental and physiological processes, e.g. miRNA, tasiRNAs, various
siRNA pathways have evolved in plants and animals to
harness transposons, antagonize infection of pathogens
and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses [56,57]. Epigenetic inactivation of transposons and exogenous DNAs
mediated by approximately 24-nt siRNAs require the
action of DCL3 and RDR2 for their biogenesis and
AGO4 in effecter complex [56,57]. DCL2, DCL4 and
RDR6 are involved in the production of 21~22-nt siRNAs from virus and A.tumefaciens T-DNA, which mediate post-transcriptional silencing of pathogen-derived
genes [56,57]. Selective up-regulation of MIR159/319
ACR miRNAs in rdr2 and dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutants
indicates that intrinsic link between miRNA and the
defensive siRNA pathways has evolved in plants (Figure
7). Mutation of the gene encoding RDR2 can cause

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:122
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/122

global changes in small RNA transcriptome and gene
expressions including reduction of 24-nt heterochromatic siRNA, enrichment of miRNA and tasiRNAs,
reactivation of specific type of transposons and altered
expression of genes in chromatin modification pathways
[41,58,59]. Some of the miRNAs are up-regulated much
higher above the overall enrichment of miRNAs in rdr2
mutants, such as the miR163 in A.thaliana [41,58]. The
up-regulations of MIR159/319 miRNAs in rdr2 or
dcl234 triple mutants are very similar to these cases.
However, the up-regulations of MIR159/319 miRNAs
are of strong selectivity upon the small RNA products
from the same stem-loop suggesting that it is unlikely to
be a non-specific process (Figure 7). It was speculated
that the different accumulation levels of miRNAs in
wild type and rdr2 mutants are caused by a secondary
level of control by a siRNA-mediated pathway, which
depends on RDR2/mop1 [41]. Likewise, the ACR
miRNA accumulation of MIR319 genes might be downstream of RDR2-dependent siRNA regulation. Since
only ACR miRNAs are induced to high levels while
increment of miR319 is similar to the overall enrichment of miRNAs in rdr2 or dcl234 triple mutants, a
post-transcriptional mechanism may distinguish the two
miRNA duplexes on the same stem-loop and link the
siRNA pathway. Because the selective up-regulation of
MIR159/319 genes is observed in both monocot and
eudicots, the regulatory link between MIR159/319 genes
and siRNA pathway may have an ancient origin. It has
been found in Physcomitrella patens that silencing of
miRNA targets via DNA methylation occurs in PpDCLb
mutants and ABA treated wild type plants [60]. This
suggests that silencing mechanisms of the heterochromatic siRNA pathway can also be exploited by the
miRNA pathway. Our findings revealed another layer of
interactions between the two small RNA pathways that
production of miRNA can be affected by defects in heterochromatic siRNA pathway.
This uncharacterized mechanism controlling mature
product proportion of MIR159/319 genes is distinguished from those previously found in animals in that
multiple mature products from a single miRNA stemloop precursor can be selectively expressed in different
situations. PARE data suggest that speed for dicing at
the steps during phased processing might be regulated,
provided that detection of more intermediate products
can serve as the signal for higher dicing speed for the
corresponding step of slicing. Accumulations of miR159,
miR168 and miR165 are insensitive to decreased DCL1
activity unlike other miRNAs such as miR173, indicative
of alternative dicer activity for the processing of these
miRNAs [51]. Therefore, it is possible that only processing by alternative factors yields abundant ACR miRNAs
but less miR159/319 when alternative activity overrides

Page 13 of 18

the canonical. Similar scenarios are possible for other
factors involved in miRNA biogenesis and activity, dysfunction of which affect miR159 in a mild way. For
example, the ABH1 is required for the processing of
some pri-miRNAs but not MIR159 [52,53]. Alternatively, since the theoretical ratio of ACR miRNA to
miR159 or miR319 should be one, the variable proportion of MIR159/319 mature products could be resulted
from regulation of mature miRNA stability. Probably,
which of the MIR159/319 mature miRNAs are incorporated into the RISC and stabilized is tunable. Since the
ACR3 miRNA has been shown to associate with AGO4
[17,61], incorporation of ACR3 miRNA into AGO4
might be tremendously increased in the rdr2 or dcl234
mutants, of which the AGO4 associated siRNAs are
depleted [41,58,59]. Increased AGO1 up-regulates
miR159 accumulation indicating excessive miR159
might be subjected to active degradation [51]. Likewise,
it is possible that the ACR miRNAs might be directly
degraded in normal state but stabilized under specific
circumstances. This kind of regulation has been
reported for a class of 21-nt endogenous siRNAs derived
from mRNAs, which accumulated only in the absence of
EIN5, a 5’-3’ exoribonuclease [53]. Possibly, degradation
of processing intermediates could be another way
through which maturation of miRNA is regulated. Some
miRNA processing intermediates are up-regulated in
exosome-deficient mutants, including the loop fragment
of MIR159 [31]. Since MIR159/319 precursors are processed in a phased manner, differential exosomemediated degradation of the intermediates might result
in variable product proportions. A combined regulation
at multiple steps of miRNA metabolic cycle can not be
ruled out. In addition to the unexpected up-regulation
of ACR miRNAs, we also observed some cases of higher
expression of miR319* than miR319, namely a shift in
strand selection (Figure 5A and 5B). The change in
strand bias of miR159 and miR159* have been observed
in drb1 mutant plants, which direct strand selection of
miRNA duplexes [54]. Possibly, the spatial-temporal
specific selection of strands in miRNA duplexes might
be resulted from incongruent expressions of the miRNA
and DRB1.
The switching on of the ACR miRNAs in specific tissues and their responsiveness to siRNA deficiency suggests that these miRNAs might be functional. There is
only one experimentally verified example that osaMIR159a ACR3 miRNA induces site-specific cleavage of
an mRNA encoding a GT-2-like transcription factor in
rice [62]. However, it can not be excluded that the
MIR159/319 ACR miRNAs may exert their function
over their targets through other mechanisms such as
translational repression or RNA mediated DNA methylation [2,60]. In light of the intra-stem-loop regulation,

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:122
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/122

the phased loop-to-base processing of miR159/319
stem-loop precursors may have evolved as framework
for the tunable mature miRNA production.

Conclusions
In this study we showed that MIR159/319 genes with
two conserved duplexes in their stem-loops distribute
throughout land plants and constitute the most plentiful
type classified by conservation pattern. Together with
phylogenetic reconstruction and mature miRNA expression analysis, evidences support that the MIR159 and
MIR319 have a common origin. Evolution history of this
gene family was revealed that the two clades containing
the MIR159 and MIR319 founding members identified
in A.thaliana are specific to flowering plants and originated from duplications occurring before the split of
gymnosperm and angiosperms. Interestingly, post-transcriptional regulation of multiple mature miRNAs from
some genes of MIR159/319 family has evolved, through
which proportion of mature MIR159/319 miRNAs can
be changed in a spatio-temporal specific manner or in
response to siRNA pathway deficiency. These findings
provide explanation for the conserved phased loop-tobase processing of MIR159/319 genes as framework for
post-transcriptionally regulated expressions of their
mature miRNAs. Taken together, our study provides
insights on the evolution of MIR159/319 genes and an
unexplored feature of them that the expressions of multiple forms of mature products are post-transcriptionally
regulated.
Methods
Homology search of miRNA genes

Known MIR159/319 sequences were collected from the
miRbase Version 11.0 [19], homologues in EST were
identified by Jones-Rhoades and Bartel [7], and the Brassicaceae MIR319 sequences were identified by Warthmann et al. [21]. In one line, SSEARCH searches were
performed against the TIGR Plant Transcript Assembly
(http://plantta.tigr.org) and the 11 plant genomes listed
in Additional File 7 using ath-miR159a or ath-miR319a
as queries [63]. In the other line, all of the mature
miRNA sequences of the MIR159/319 family available
in miRbase Version 11.0 were used to BLAST search
against the nr, gss, htgs and est databases in the NCBI
GenBank [64]. The flanking sequences (350-nt or as
long as possible) on either side were retrieved for each
resulting High-scoring Sequence Pairs (HSP) from the
searches. The RNA secondary structures were predicted
using RNAfold [65]. The miRNA-like stem-loop structures were selected using modified miRcheck rules [7].
Briefly, 1) the paired bases for miR or miR* (miR:
miR159/319 homologous sequence; miR*: antisense
sequence in the stem-loop structure corresponding to

Page 14 of 18

miR) must be located within one arm, either the 5’ or
the 3’; 2) there must be no more than 6 unpaired bases
in the miR; 3) no more than 3 bulges in the miR; 4) no
more than 3-nt differences between the lengths of miR
and miR*; 5) no more than 3 asymmetrically unpaired
bases in the miR; 6) no more than 3 contiguous
unpaired bases in the miR; and 7) the distance between
miR and miR* must be no less than 5 and no more than
300 nucleotides. The filtrates were inspected manually
to exclude the loose and unstable structures. Finally, if
the miR sequence has no more than 3 mismatches or
indels compared to a MIR159/319 mature miRNA in
the miRbase, the stem-loop was considered a homologue. If the miR sequence contains 4 mismatches or
indels, the stem-loop was considered a candidate homologue. Homologous sequences contain more mismatches
were not considered. The naming of the new homologues or candidates, 159 or 319, followed the name of
the MIR159/319 gene in the miRbase that had the smallest edit distance in the mature miRNA sequence. The

Taxonomic tree

The taxonomic tree was plotted using NCBI taxonomy
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/
wwwcmt.cgi) and drawn by NJplot [67].
Structural alignment and phylogenetic inference

All of the stem-loop sequences of the MIR159 family
were aligned using the software T-coffee version 6.06
[68]. Sequences that can’t be aligned correctly in the
conserved regions outside of miR159/319 and miR159/
319* were excluded in subsequent analysis. The remaining sequences were aligned again. Secondary structures
were produced for each sequence in the alignment using
RNAfold [65]. The software 4SALE was then used to
correct the alignment manually by considering the
agreement in secondary structure [69]. After removing
the columns that contain more than a 75% gap, the consensus sequences and structures were produced using
ConStruct, RNAalifold, alidot and SARSE [70-73]. Structure logos were produced using slogo [74]. The partitions of the well-aligned stem-loops were divided
empirically by assigning approximately 21-nt for the
well-conserved regions. The phylogenetic tree was
inferred using MrBayes version 3.1 with the GTR model
for unpaired regions and the Doublet model for paired
regions with 4 discrete gamma distribution categories
[22]. Two chains were run for 20 million generations.
Trees were sampled every 100 generations. The consensus tree was summarized using a 50 majority rule from
300,000 trees after removing the burn-in. Only one
sequence was retained for identical sequences in the
alignment for phylogenetic inference. These representative taxa were replaced with nodes of the original redundant taxa, for which posterior probabilities were set to
100 and branch lengths were set to 0.001 for viewing.
The phylogenetic tree was edited using Dendroscope
and MEGA4 [75,76]. Gene duplications were deduced
from the tree using the criteria that duplications
increase the number of paralogues in one clade, while
gene losses were inferred by the absence of an ancestral
gene in descendant clades.
Re-analysis of existing small RNA sequencing data

Small RNA sequences were mapped on the stem-loop
sequences using a customized perl script. Only perfectly
matched small RNAs were considered. The small RNA

Page 15 of 18

sequencing resources are listed in Additional File 8.
Sequencing abundances were normalized to the average
sequencing scale for all samples in a given database
unless the values had already been normalized using the
original data generators. The expression value for a specific partition in the alignment was calculated by summing all the normalized sequencing frequencies of
unique small RNAs that had 80% or more of their
nucleotides overlap with that partition. The small RNAs
that could not be assigned to any partition are categorized as “leak” to denote that these mature miRNAs were
inconsistent with the phased processing. The mutant-towild type ratios were calculated using the maximum
possible values, which included reads that also matched
the closely related paralogues when an individual
miRNA gene was studied. For [GEO:GSE12468] of P.
patens [34], the mutant-to-wild type ratio was calculated
by using the mean of two replicates for each of the wild
type and mutant values.
PARE (Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends) data analysis

One part of PARE sequence tags was downloaded from
the AtPARE database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at_pare).
The other part was obtained from [GEO:GSE11007]
[30]. Sequencing abundances for all samples were normalized to TP10M (transcript per 10 million reads). The
tags that represent uncapped 5’ RNA ends were mapped
to the Arabidopsis thaliana MIR159 and MIR319 genes,
stem-loops or an approximately 1 kb sequence with the
stem-loop at the centre. The pri-MIR319a is from [GenBank:AY922324] [21]. The frequency of the cleavage
between two nucleotides was calculated by summing the
sequencing abundances of all the sequence tags whose
5’ first nucleotide situated exactly at the second nucleotide. Total cleavages were calculated by summing the
values of all the samples for a cleavage site. The maximum possible frequencies that included tags that also
matched closely related homologues were used in Figure
6. RNA secondary structures were drawn using XRNA
(http://rna.ucsc.edu/rnacenter/xrna/xrna.html).
