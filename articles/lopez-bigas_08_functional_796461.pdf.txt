<p>Quantification in human evolution
Protein divergence of the divergence of proteins by functional category shows that morphological changes in metazoa have been driven by
variation in regulatory genes.</p>

Abstract
Background: Protein-coding regions in a genome evolve by sequence divergence and gene gain
and loss, altering the gene content of the organism. However, it is not well understood how this
has given rise to the enormous diversity of metazoa present today.
Results: To obtain a global view of human genomic evolution, we quantify the divergence of
proteins by functional category at different evolutionary distances from human.
Conclusion: This analysis highlights some general systems-level characteristics of human
evolution: regulatory processes, such as signal transducers, transcription factors and receptors,
have a high degree of plasticity, while core processes, such as metabolism, transport and protein
synthesis, are largely conserved. Additionally, this study reveals a dynamic picture of selective
forces at short, medium and long evolutionary timescales. Certain functional categories, such as
'development' and 'organogenesis', exhibit temporal patterns of sequence divergence in eukaryotes
relative to human. This framework for a grammar of human evolution supports previously
postulated theories of robustness and evolvability.

Background

Though it is known that coding regions evolve primarily by
sequence divergence of individual genes and gene gain and
loss, altering the gene content of the organism, it is not well
understood how these processes have resulted in the tremendous diversity of metazoa present today. Have metazoans
evolved through a process of incremental changes occurring
evenly across genes from different functional categories, or is
there a pattern by which some classes of gene function accumulate mutations quickly, while others remain conserved
throughout evolution across different branches of the species
tree?

The differential rate of evolution of proteins has been of longstanding interest. As early as 1971, Dickerson [1] studied the
relationship between the number of amino acid differences
and divergence time for cytochrome c, hemoglobins, and
fibrinopeptide. In 1978, Dayhoff et al. [2] studied the rates of
amino acid substitutions per amino acid site in various proteins, finding that histones are among the most conserved
proteins while hormones and immunoglobulins evolve the
fastest.
The recent availability of full genome sequences has allowed
large scale comparisons of gene sequences between organisms, that is, chicken and human [3], human and mouse [4]
or human, fugu, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans [5].

Purifying selection on mutations has been related to a
number of aspects of protein structure and function, such as
the number of interaction partners, expression levels, dispensability, and the character and interface of protein-protein
complexes amongst others (reviewed in [6]). Recent studies
have focused on sequence divergence between humans and
other primates, and on the sequence diversity within human
populations in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms
[7-13]. Another approach to quantifying evolutionary divergence at the genome level is to measure gene gains and losses
between species by identifying orthologs between pairs of
organisms [14]. Other studies have analyzed specific functional gene sets in particular groups of organisms. For example, Babu et al. [15] reported high variability in prokaryotic
transcription factor repertoires in contrast to the conservation of their target genes in prokaryotes. Coulson and
Ouzounis [16] reported that eukaryotic transcriptional regulator families are primarily taxon-specific. Peregrin-Alvarez
et al. [17] found that metabolic enzymes are present across a
wider phylogenetic spectrum than other genes.
Some studies have analyzed the expansion of protein families
in relation to the number of genes in the genome [18,19] or to
organismic complexity, measured as the number of cell types
[20]. These studies report that protein families involved in
regulatory processes and extracellular functions show an
increase in the number of genes correlated with genome size
and organismic complexity.
All of the studies mentioned above address the evolution of
the protein repertoire in various sets of organisms. Here, we
investigate the evolutionary divergence of all functional
groups of human proteins at different levels. We measure
divergence of human proteins relative to 15 eukaryotes spanning from mammals to fungi using a new method we call
FRED (for 'Functional categories and their relative evolutionary divergence'), which is outlined in Figure 1.
In contrast to previous studies of conservation [7-9,13,14,21],
our work spans 15 genomes ranging from mammals to fungi,
which allows us to gain a broad perspective on the history of
mutations and selection leading to the human lineage. By

comparing the sequence evolution of different functional
groups in human we see which parts of the genome are more
plastic to change, and which parts are conserved. With our
approach, we gain a dynamic picture of the extent of conservation, since some functions are strictly conserved only
within vertebrates, for instance, while others are maintained
across all eukaryotes. This dynamic picture of differential
rates of divergence across functional categories reveals a
'grammar' of metazoan evolution up to the human lineage.

Results
Functional protein divergence in the glucagon and
insulin signaling pathways
First, we focus on a specific system to investigate whether
there are different levels of protein conservation for types of
protein function. Glucose metabolism is a key process in
human cells for the storage and release of energy. The
enzymes that catalyze the reactions leading to the synthesis
and degradation of glucose are regulated by complex signaling pathways triggered by glucagon and insulin hormones
[22]. This system is a good case study, as there are a variety of
proteins of different molecular functions involved in the process: enzymes, receptors, signal transducers and transcription
factors.
Figure 2a depicts key genes involved in glucose homeostasis
regulated by insulin and glucagon hormones and the functional relationships between them. We measure sequence
divergence using the ranked 'conservation score' (CS; please
refer to Materials and methods for a definition of this score;
Figure 2b). This case study illustrates that the proteins
involved in regulation of the glucose metabolism, such as glucagon (GCG) and insulin (INS), their receptors (INSR and
GCGR) and some transcriptional regulators involved in the
process (SREBF1, PPARGC1A and FOXO1A), have very low
conservation compared to enzymes directly involved in the
catalysis of reactions of glucose metabolism. For example,
FOXO1A is a transcription factor that regulates the expression levels of several enzymes in gluconeogenesis (G6PC,
FBP1 and PCK1). This protein is highly divergent in eukaryotes, especially in invertebrates. Recently, this gene has been

Flow chart of the FRED method for analyzing the protein divergence landscape of functional categories. (a) We start from a matrix of all human genes
with the conservation score (CS) in each of the 15 genomes analyzed. (b) First, all genes with a CS over 0 are ranked in each organism, and the highly
ranked genes are shown in red and lowly ranked in blue following a gradient of colors. White cells mean that no ortholog/homolog is detected. Next, the
genes are classified according to GO terms. (c) For each set of genes within a GO category, we calculate the median CS, and also select 10,000 sets of the
same number of genes as in the GO category considered at random from the complete set of genes with GO annotation. (d) For each random set, we
calculate the median CS. (e) From the 10,000 random sets we obtain the expected median CS and the standard error, which allow us to calculate the Zscore for the GO category under consideration. (f) This Z-score is then plotted in a matrix on a color-coded scale. Gray means no significant difference in
the level of conservation compared to the background. A similar procedure is followed for the calculation of Z-scores for number of orthologs and
homologs by counting the proportion of genes with homologs or orthologs in each set. Mmus, Mus musculus; Rnor, Rattus norvegicus; Cfam, Canis familiaris;

shown to be differentially expressed between primates [23].
The mammalian insulin signaling pathway has been studied
in depth. Insulin signaling influences other processes in addition to glucose metabolism, such as protein synthesis, growth
and cell division. This pathway, from the receptor to the target serine/threonine kinases, is known to be conserved in
fruitfly [24] and nematode [25-27]. However, as seen in our
analysis, the degree of conservation of the proteins involved
in the insulin pathway is low relative to the conservation of
other human proteins. In contrast, most of the enzymes
involved in the process are highly conserved across eukarya.
Thus, the human proteins involved in this well-known biological system show the following trend of conservation across
metazoa: genes whose function is the direct catalysis of enzymatic reactions are conserved, while genes involved in the
regulation of these core catalytic proteins (receptors, signal
transducers and transcription factors) are divergent. We
wondered whether this pattern of conservation is specific to
the insulin and glucagon signaling system, or whether it is a
general pattern found in the whole human proteome.

Protein divergence of the human proteome during
mammalian evolution
To generalize our study of evolutionary rates across functional categories, we analyzed the evolutionary landscape of
human genes and their orthologs in over 300 functional categories across 15 eukaryotes using our FRED method. We
quantified the conservation of genes using four measures.
Two of the measures are the CS of the orthologs (Figure 3, and
Figures S2a,b and S3a,b in Additional data file 1) and the CS
of the closest homolog (Figure 3, and Figures S2d,e and S3d,e
in Additional data file 1) of human proteins in other eukaryotic organisms. These two measures of amino acid sequence
conservation are highly correlated across all genomes compared to human (for example, the correlation coefficient =
0.97 for mouse and 0.93 for Drosophila; Table S1 in Additional data file 1). In addition to these measures of sequence
divergence, we quantified the presence of orthologs to the
human proteins in the other genomes as well as the presence
of homologs. The degree of orthology reflects the presence of
human genes in other genomes (Figures S1, S2c and S3c in
Additional data file 1), while homology reflects the presence
of the human gene family in other genomes (Figures S1, S2f
and S3f in Additional data file 1) (Please refer to the Supple-

Lopez-Bigas et al. R33.4

mentary methods in Additional data file 1 for details of the
calculation of these measures.). The relative conservation of
Gene Ontology (GO) categories, the statistics and the CS for
each of the 14,062 human genes analyzed are provided online
in a searchable database [28].
While we also consider the rate of loss of genes and families,
we focus on sequence divergence in describing our results.
Though there is a wide range of protein sequence conservation in all categories, the shape of the distribution differs
between categories (Figure 4). Some categories contain many
highly conserved proteins across all eukaryotes and only few
proteins that are not conserved, while others are dominated
by proteins that diverge quickly. Yet another type of category
contains proteins that are conserved in one phylogenetic
group relative to human and divergent in another phylogenetic group.
The set of proteins in a particular functional category will vary
when comparing human to different genomes due to gene
gain and loss. Therefore, the average CS of the proteins in a
functional category depends on both the sequence divergence
of ancient conserved orthologs, as well as genes that have
evolved anew in the lineage considered (and are still conserved in human). Since this is true of all functional categories, the median conservation score of a category is a robust
measure of variation in proteins between the functional categories of a particular pair of genomes. In order to make sure
that our conclusions hold even when we consider only universally conserved orthologs, we have used the KOGs classification [29] as a further control data set (Figure S4 in Additional
data file 1). We will now survey the varying patterns of conservation of the different functional categories, and will attempt
to identify underlying principles.

Metabolism, transport and cell structure proteins are
conserved
The most conserved functional categories, shown in red in
Figure 3, belong to the three super-groups of 'metabolism'
(catalytic activity, macromolecule metabolism, biosynthesis,
protein metabolism, primary metabolism, mRNA splicing,
mRNA processing), 'transport' (transporter activity, carrier
activity, ion transport activity, protein transport, intracellular
transport, transport, protein localization) and 'cell structure'
(structural constituent of ribosome, structural molecule
activity, nucleosome assembly, organelle organization and

biogenesis, chromatin assembly or disassembly, DNA packaging) (Figure 3). Note that the nucleosome assembly category is actually more conserved than indicated by CS
orthologs in Figure 3 (see CS homologs in Figure 3); this distortion is due to a known limitation of the current EnsemblCompara ortholog assignment (Albert Vilella, personal communication). Many of the proteins that belong to conserved
categories involved in binding are also part of the metabolism
super-group: nucleotide binding, ATP binding, RNA binding,
protein binding. The three broad groups of metabolism,
transport and cell structure are all core cellular processes.

Modulators of core processes are highly divergent
In contrast, proteins with the lowest conservation, shown in
blue in Figure 3, are mainly involved in 'regulatory' functions
and processes or involved in 'responses to the environment'.
For example, amongst the least conserved molecular functions are receptors (receptor activity, transmembrane receptor activity, olfactory receptor activity, rhodopsin like
receptor activity), signal transducers and transcription factors not involved in development (TF-DBD). All these
divergent molecular functions are mainly involved in
modulating the conserved core processes. Note that this trend
holds across many different structural families and different
types of regulators, so that it cannot be explained in terms of
particular molecular characteristics, such as fewer constraints on the fold or on the surface of receptors compared to
the constraints on enzyme.
The other biological processes that are evolving rapidly are
those involved in responses to the environment: defense
response, immune response, response to stimulus, response
to external stimulus, response to stress, response to
wounding, inflammatory response. These processes are all
involved in the response to an external challenge to the organism. Since challenges such as parasites vary from one eukaryote to another, natural selection favors rapid evolution of
proteins in these categories. Pressure for adaptation against
changing environments and pathogens imposes strong selection for advantageous mutations to sweep the population
rapidly.
Host-parasite interactions have been suggested as the most
likely reason for the fast evolution of human immunity genes
[21]. In addition, these categories have a low number of genes
with orthologs or homologs in other organisms (Figure S1 in

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R33

Lopez-Bigas et al. R33.6

Additional data file 1). This is not surprising since the antibody-based immune system does not exist in bony fish or
other lower eukaryotes [30], and there may be parallel or
alternative adaptive immune systems in these organisms,
such as the leucine-rich repeat receptor system in lampreys
[31].

Developmental genes are conserved only in mammals
Some categories are conserved amongst mammals while
diverging rapidly in other organisms relative to human,
including development, morphogenesis, organogenesis, and
many categories associated with transcriptional regulation
(Figures 3 and 4). Although the GO category 'transcription
factor activity' shows this pattern of conservation, our division of transcription factors into 'Developmental TFs' and
'TF-DBD', which are transcription factors involved in other
processes (see Materials and methods for details), reveals a
fundamental difference between the two groups: transcription factors involved in development are highly conserved in
mammals, while those not involved in development have only
average conservation in mammals and are significantly divergent in bony fish relative to human. Both groups of
transcription factors ('Developmental TFs' and 'TF-DBD') are
highly divergent in invertebrates relative to human (Figure
3). Thus, for the transcription factors not involved in development, the trend is consistent with that of other regulatory categories such as receptors and signal transducers.
An example of a particular developmental transcription factor that is highly conserved in mammals but switches to being
very divergent in invertebrates is the Neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NeuroD1), which is required for dendrite morphogenesis and maintenance in the cerebellar cortex [32].
Note that there is a distribution of sequence conservation
within each functional category. Thus, within the 'development' category, there are proteins, including some transcription factors, that form part of the core of the developmental
network, conserved from invertebrates to human, while at the
same time, other parts of the network have undergone profound change or innovation [33]. This trend is also noticeable
when we focus on short evolutionary distance from humans.
Though NeuroD1 follows the same pattern as the 'Developmental TF' category as a whole, there are exceptions: some
transcription factors involved in core developmental processes, such as Pax-6, are remarkably conserved across all
eukaryotes (Figure S2 in Additional data file 1).

to stimulus' is significantly divergent across all three organisms.

Controls for orthology, conservation measure,
functional classifications and expression
This whole genome divergence pattern is not an artifact of the
set of orthologs and homologs or the functional classification
scheme we use: almost identical results are obtained using
the orthologous groups within seven eukaryotes and also the
functional classification provided by the KOGs [29] (Figure
S4 and Table S1 in Additional data file 1). Furthermore, when
we restrict the orthologous groups considered to those that
are present across all seven eukaryotes, very similar results
are obtained (Figure S4c,d in Additional data file 1). This
means that orthologs present, for example, in mammals only
are not distorting the general trend of a conserved core and
divergent regulatory functions. In addition, this test also
accounts for possible genome annotation biases due to
conservation.

We compared our results of protein divergence (using CS)
with two measures of divergence at the DNA level: the GERP
(Genome evolutionary rate profiling) method developed by
Cooper and colleagues [34] where divergence rate of every
base position is compared against an expected rate; and the
rate of non-synonymous substitution (dN) between human
and mouse and human and rat genomes (see Materials and
methods for details). Using the GERP score we measured
divergence in mammals (chimpanzee, macaque, rat, mouse,
dog, cow, opossum) at each coding base for around 15,000
human genes. An evolutionarily conserved base position has
a low GERP score while a divergent position has a high score.
We measured the average GERP score for all coding nucleotides for each gene and assessed whether these values differ
significantly between functional groups using Z-score analysis (Figure S5 in Additional data file 1). Similarly, we assessed
the dN values per gene. The FRED results using the GERP
score and dN correlates remarkably well with that of the CS in

mammals, showing consistency between DNA and proteinlevel measures.
Another factor that could potentially confound our analysis is
the correlation between phylogenetic extent and expression
breadth across tissues [35]. Restricting our FRED analysis to
housekeeping genes (defined as genes expressed in more than
75 tissues in GeneAtlas v2 expression array [36]) or to genes
with tissue-specific expression (those expressed in less than
20 tissues) yields essentially the same results as considering
all proteins (data not shown).
From these control analyses, it is clear that our general conclusion is independent of factors such as expression, the
definition of orthologs, the measure of conservation and the
functional classification scheme used.

Discussion

Here, we establish the entire divergence landscape of human
protein-coding genes across eukaryotes and discuss evolutionary selection in the human lineage in the light of longterm evolution. The main results from our analysis are, first,
that two main groups of proteins are diverging at different
speeds: regulatory proteins diverge quickly across species,
while proteins involved in core processes are conserved (Figure 5). This shows that at the level of protein-coding genes,
morphological changes in metazoan evolution relative to
humans have been primarily driven by variation in regulatory
genes rather than enzymatic and structural genes. While this
is consistent with many previous small-scale studies, our conclusions are more comprehensive and clear due to the amount
of data we consider in this analysis. Second, certain functional
categories exhibit dynamic patterns of sequence divergence
across their evolutionary history leading to human. Genes
involved in 'development' and 'organogenesis' are significantly conserved within mammals, while significantly divergent in human relative to invertebrates.
The picture of long-term evolution is broadly consistent with
the signatures of selection on functional categories in the
human lineage, implying that the same underlying grammar
guides the dynamics of metazoan evolution relative to human
over short as well as long evolutionary timescales. Recent
studies [7-10,13,21] have identified several categories of
genes with higher divergence rates between hominids, or with
signs of positive selection using different measures for detecting selection. For example, Bustamante and colleagues [7]
identified genes involved in transport and cell structure as
being under negative selection in the human lineage, which
we find to have strong protein sequence conservation. Genes
involved in regulatory processes have been reported to show
signatures of positive selection [7,12], especially genes related
to regulation of transcription. In addition, genes involved in
immune and defense response also show strong signatures of
positive selection in the human [7,12,21]. Both sets of catego-

ries have high sequence divergence in our comparison of
human proteins to other eukaryotes. Bustamante et al. [7]
report strong negative selection on ectoderm development,
and we find development to be conserved in mammals.
Our analysis highlights some general systems-level characteristics of metazoan evolution relative to human: regulatory
processes, such as signal transducers, transcription factors
and receptors, have a high degree of plasticity, while core
processes, such as metabolism, transport and protein synthesis, are largely conserved. This dual architecture of a conserved core and variable regulatory peripheral processes may
confer robustness [37] and evolvability [38] on the system. So
far there has been little concrete biological data on genes that
are responsible for phenotypic plasticity and the evolution of
species. Our analysis provides evidence for which genes and
functional categories are most variable in organismic evolution, and what we observe fits the framework of the theories
cited above.
We have focused purely on molecular variation of protein
coding genes. There are many other dimensions to human
evolution that are not captured by this analysis, or at least not
directly. These include evolution of epigenetic regulation,
alternative splicing, non-coding genes such as microRNAs
[39,40], promoters [41,42] and other non-coding regions
[43,44]. However, divergence rates of the human proteincoding genes are linked with evolution of all of these other
processes, and proteins themselves are the major players in
the development, structure and physiological adaptability of
animals.
In the future, analyses such as ours will be aided by greater
density of sequence information. The 'thousand dollar
genome' or, more generally, cheaper sequencing and genotyping technologies will provide us with greater coverage of
polymorphisms both in human and other organisms. At the
same time, population-wide measurements of expression at
the RNA [45-47] and protein levels will allow us to
understand how changes in DNA affect cellular processes. In
terms of whole organisms, quantitative phenotypic traits are
beginning to be related to sequence features [48]. Ultimately,
we hope to understand what variations at cellular, organismic
and species level are determined by genomic diversity.

Materials and methods
Functional classification
Protein-coding human genes with functional annotation
(14,062 genes) were extracted from Ensembl [49] for both the
'molecular function' and 'biological process' GO classification
[50]. Note that GO terms are organized into structures called
directed acyclic graphs, such that a specialized term can be
associated with several less specialized terms. For instance, a
gene annotated with the term 'transcription factor activity'
will also automatically be annotated as 'DNA binding' and

Peripheral and core functional categories
Peripheral and core functional categories. A set of core molecular functions and biological processes that are highly conserved are represented in red in

and highly conserved in others (yellow) are represented on the periphery as regulators of the core processes. The colors correspond to the colored lines

'nucleic acid binding', which are parent terms of the former
terms in the GO database. We analyzed all the GO molecular
function categories and all biological process categories that
have more than 100 human genes annotated with their term
(135 and 242, respectively). We carried out our analysis with
and without annotation that is inferred electronically (this
represents 54% of annotations for biological process and 69%
for molecular function), and the conclusions are consistent
using both versions of GO annotation (data not shown). In
addition, although we used all the Ensembl genes with GO
annotations (14,062 genes) for our study, we repeated the
analysis using only genes included in the RefSeq database
[51], finding essentially the same results (data not shown).
In addition to these categories, we introduced a category of
our own of predicted sequence-specific DNA-binding
transcription factors. This category is defined from the database DBD, which contains repertoires of predicted transcription factors for completely sequenced genomes based on
domain assignments from the SUPERFAMILY and PFAM
hidden Markov model libraries [52]. Furthermore, we
divided this category into: developmental transcription factors (that is, also annotated with the GO biological process
term 'development'); and all others (TF-DBD).

In the alternative functional classification scheme considered, the KOGs database [29], there are orthologous groups of
proteins from seven eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the
nematode C. elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster
and Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two
fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces
pombe), and the intracellular microsporidian parasite
Encephalitozoon cuniculi [29]. The orthologous groups of
proteins are classified into one of 25 functional categories
wherever possible, so there are fewer larger categories in this
scheme compared to the GO scheme.

Genomes and phylogenetic groups
Proteins from the human genome (NCBI36 - Ensembl v.42)
were used for the analysis. In addition, the following versions
of other completed eukaryotic genomes are part of our analysis. Mammals: two rodents, mouse (Mus musculus NCBIM36) and rat (Rattus norvegicus - RGSC3.4), dog
(Canis familiaris - CanFam2.0), cow (Bos taurus - Btau2.0),
opossum (Monodelphis domestica - MonDom4.0). Other vertebrates: chicken (Gallus gallus - WASHUC2) and Frog
(Xenopus tropicalis - JGI4.1), and three bony fish, zebrafish
(Danio rerio - Zv6), fugu (Takifugu rubripes - FUGU4) and
tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis - TETRAODON7). Invertebrates: mosquito (Anopheles gambiae - AgamP3), fruitfly
(D. melanogaster - BDGP4.3), sea urchin (Ciona intestinalis

- JGI2), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans - WS160) and yeast
(S. cerevisiae - SGD1.01).

Homology and orthology
Pairwise similarity for all human genes against each other
and the other genomes was obtained from Ensembl-Compara
(v42.0) [49]. These relationships were computed using WUBLASTP (v2.0) [53] for each gene considering the longest peptide isoform only. Homologs are defined as those sequences
with a match with an E-value ≤10-10 in other genomes, while
orthologs in Ensembl-Compara are assigned based on maximum likelihood phylogenetic gene trees.
The presence of an ortholog for a human protein in another
genome provides more precise information about the conservation of the protein than the presence of a homolog. However, orthology detection is error-prone for distant
evolutionary relationships and for protein families with many
duplications and losses. Therefore, we decided to use both,
orthologs and homologs, in our study.

Functional categories and their relative evolutionary
divergence: FRED
We have developed a scheme for quantifying the relative protein sequence divergence of different functional categories
between a pair of genomes, which we used to compare human
to 15 other genomes. We call this framework FRED, for
functional categories and their relative evolutionary divergence, which is outlined in Figure 1 and described below.

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R33

Lopez-Bigas et al. R33.11

score of the ortholog (or the closest homolog) in the other
organism by the WUBLASTP score of the protein against
itself, as reported elsewhere [54]: CS ortholog or homolog =
WUBLASTP score ortholog or homolog/WUBLASTP score
self.
The CS accounts for the proportion of the query protein
matched by WUBLASTP and the quality of the match, but is
independent of the query protein length. The CS ranges from
0, when no ortholog or homolog is detected, to 1, when the
closest homolog is identical to the human protein. Note, that
for all our analyses using CS, we use only values higher than
0, meaning that we take into account only genes with detectable and significant orthologs or homologs. This score is
indicative of how conserved a protein has remained through
evolution, and hence the degree to which mutations within
the sequence have been tolerated. We do not consider the
molecular details of the differences in mutation rates, such as
variations in the proportion of residues that are required for
adequate protein function. Instead, we consider the net result
of accepted mutations across functional categories.
In Figure 2b, we display in color the relative CS of each gene
in a particular organism. To do this we ranked all human
genes with homologs in the other genome according to their
CS. The gene with the highest CS is shown in red and the one
with the lowest CS in blue, with all others in intermediate
colors according to their rank by CS. Thus, colors towards red
mean high relative CS of the protein, green is medium relative
CS and blue low relative CS.

Conservation measures
The primary measure of evolutionary rate that we use is
amino acid sequence evolution through the CS [54]. We use
the median CS for all the orthologs of human to another
genome in a particular functional category. This means that
the set of proteins considered for a particular functional category can differ when comparing human to one genome or
another due to gain and loss of genes throughout evolution.
However, we normalize the rate of sequence divergence for
each functional category by the average divergence for the
pair of genomes considered. This means that gene gain and
loss in a particular category is implicitly compared to the rates
in other functional categories when we study sequence divergence. Furthermore, we also consider the set of universally
conserved orthologs across eukaryotes from the KOGs database [29] and test our conclusions on this set. In addition, we
have analyzed the extent of the existence of orthologs and
homologs to the human genes in the 15 other genomes, and
discuss the extent of correlation between the different measures of evolutionary rate.

Conservation score

Note that for the orthologs from the KOGs classification
scheme, the CS value was calculated for each human gene by
dividing the BLASTP score of the closest KOG partner in the
other organism by the BLASTP score of the protein against
itself.

Simulations for Z-score calculations
As described above and summarized in Figure 1, we grouped
the genes by GO molecular function and biological process
category, and then calculated both the mean and median CS
for orthologs and homologs, as well as the number of genes
with homologs or orthologs in a particular genome. To test
whether there was a significant deviation from random
expectation for these measures we used the Z-score:

Z x = (X − μ x ) /σ x
where μx is the mean, and σ x is the standard error. The σ x
for number of genes with homologs and orthologs was calculated as:

The CS is an estimate of the divergence that has occurred
between a pair of proteins during evolution, and is independent of the length of the proteins [54]. The value of CS was calculated for each human gene by dividing the WUBLASTP

σx =

ρ (1 − ρ )
N

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R33

where ρ is the proportion of genes in the category in question
that have homologs or orthologs, and N is the total number of
genes in the category. To calculate σ x for the mean and
median CS in each of the GO categories (X), we randomly
selected 10,000 datasets of human proteins of identical sample sizes as the category in question and repeated the calculation for each random set. Z-scores for both mean and median
CS values for functional categories yield essentially the same
results, as the correlation coefficients between the two measures are greater than 0.9 for all functional categories and
genomes.
We display matrices of Z-score values in which each cell is
represented by a color-coded scale. Red signifies conservation (either greater number of homologs or orthologs than the
background, or greater average conservation score than the
background) and blue signifies divergence. Gray means no
significant difference in the level of conservation compared to
the background.
When adjusting the conventional α value (0.05, the p-value
threshold) using the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing we obtain a corrected α of 1.3 × 10-4, taking into account
that we are doing 377 tests (135 molecular function and 242
GO biological process categories). Therefore, we consider as
significant absolute Z-scores larger than 3.652 (|Z| > 3.652),
which corresponds to an analytical p-value of 1.3 × 10-4. This
is a stringent threshold as Bonferroni is a conservative correction, especially for the data structure considered here.
Note that our measure of degree of conservation of a functional class (Z-score) is always relative to the conservation of
all the genes in that genome in comparison to human. For
instance, transcription factors are diverging rapidly in fly relative to human but have average conservation in mouse; this
means that the orthologous fly-human transcription factors
have diverged rapidly compared to fly-human orthologs in
other functional categories, not compared to the mousehuman orthologs. The speed of divergence of a category will
depend on the divergence of both ancient conserved genes
and genes that have arisen within the particular lineage considered. Clearly, there will be more human orthologs that
have arisen recently in organisms closely related to human.
The expectation is that a recently duplicated gene will have a
relatively high rate of sequence divergence in order to sub- or
neo-functionalize. The contribution of such genes to various
functional categories will be uneven, since it is known that
some categories expand more quickly than others [18]. At the
same time, the constraint on proteins in most functional categories will be more similar in organisms closer to human,
and may change in organisms more distantly related to
human (even if there are orthologs within the category). To
control for these issues, we re-calculated the Z-scores for
KOGs functional categories on proteins that are universally

conserved across all seven eukaryotes in the KOGs database
(see main text).

Divergence profile of orthologous regions across
mammals: GERP
To understand the evolutionary history of coding regions at
base level positions, we considered the divergence profile of
orthologous regions across mammals. We used the GERP
method developed by Cooper and colleagues [34] where
divergence rate of every base position is compared against an
expected rate. An evolutionarily conserved base position has
a low GERP score while a divergent position has a high score.
First, ortholog information for human genes in seven other
mammalian genomes, namely chimpanzee, macaque, rat,
mouse, dog, cow, opossum, was collected from EnsemblCompara v37 and 42. We considered only orthologs that were
>100 amino acids long aligned over at least 70% of the human
protein. DNA level multiple alignment was performed using
DIALIGN [55]. The neutral phylogenetic tree of the mammalian genomes was constructed by eliminating nodes that were
not present in our study from the tree provided by Cooper et
al. [34]. The average neutral rate of substitution for the mammalian genomes included in the analysis was taken as 1.93
substitutions per base. Semphy [56] was used by GERP to calculate the observed rate of divergence on a base-by-base
basis. The score for evolutionary divergence was calculated as
GERP score = Observed rate - Expected rate. Around 15,000
genes that had orthologs in 4 or more mammalian genomes
were subject to GERP analysis.
We measured the average GERP score for all coding nucleotides for each functional category and we assessed using
FRED analysis if these values differ significantly between
functional groups (Figure S5 in Additional data file 1).

Non-synonymous substitution rates: dN
dN data for the genes were taken from Ensembl-Compara v45
[49]. We computed the correlation between dN and CS for
orthologs of human genes in mouse (16,040 genes) and rat
(14,726 genes) (Figure S6 in Additional data file 1). We
assessed using FRED analysis if the dN values for humanmouse and human-rat differ significantly between functional
groups (Figure S5 in Additional data file 1).
