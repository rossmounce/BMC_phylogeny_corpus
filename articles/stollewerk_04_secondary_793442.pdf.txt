Abstract
Background: In the spider Cupiennius salei about 30 groups of neural precursors are generated
per hemi-segment during early neurogenesis. Analysis of the ventral neuromeres after invagination
of the primary neural precursor groups revealed that secondary neural precursors arise during late
embryogenesis that partially do not differentiate until larval stages.
Results: In contrast to the primary groups, the secondary invaginating cells do not detach from
each other after invagination but maintain their epithelial character and form so-called epithelial
vesicles. As revealed by dye labeling, secondary neural precursors within epithelial vesicles do not
show any morphological features of differentiation indicating that the formation of epithelial
vesicles after invagination leads to a delay in the differentiation of the corresponding neural
precursors. About half of the secondary neural precursor groups do not dissociate from each other
during embryogenesis indicating that they provide neural precursors for larval and adult stages.
Conclusions: Secondary neural precursors are arrested in an immature state by formation of
epithelial vesicles. This mechanism facilitates the production of larval neural precursors during
embryogenesis. I discuss the evolutionary changes that have occured during neural precursor
formation in the arthropod group and present a model for the basal mode of neurogenesis.

Background
The arthropods form a diverse group with a correspondingly high variation of neural structures adapted to the
specialized behaviour and lifestyles of individual species.
This raises the question of how developmental processes
have been modified during evolution to generate the wide
diversity of nervous systems seen in adult arthropods.
Evolutionary modifications that lead to variations in neu-

ral structures can occur during different processes of neurogenesis. The establishment of neural networks can be
influenced by changes in the generation of neural precursors, modifications of cell fates or elimination of individual neurons as well as changes in axonal guidance. A
comparative analysis of neurogenesis in chelicerates and
myriapods has revealed that although the developmental
program is genetically conserved, there is a major

difference in the recruitment of neural precursors as compared to insects and crustaceans [1-5]. Groups of neural
precursors invaginate from the ventral neuroectoderm in
a regular, strikingly similar pattern in spiders (chelicerates) and myriapods, while in insects and crustaceans single neural precursors are selected. This modification may
be the basis for variations in the functions of spider and
myriapod neurons, since a comparison of early segmentally repeated neurons that pioneer the major axon tracts
in crustaceans and insects has not revealed any similarities
in cell body positions or axonal outgrowths to myriapod
neurons [6,7].
In the spider 30 to 32 groups of neural precursors are generated per hemi-segment during neurogenesis. As in Drosophila melanogaster, the neural precursors arise at
stereotyped positions that are prefigured by a proneural
gene (CsASH 1), while the neurogenic genes Delta and
Notch restrict the proportion of cells that adopt the neural
fate at each wave of neural precursor formation [1,2]. In
Drosophila melanogaster, the Delta/Notch signalling pathway is used for a decision between two cell fates in the
ventral neuroectoderm: delaminating cells become neural
precursors, while cells that remain apical give rise to epidermis. This decision does not take place in the central
neurogenic regions of the spider [2]. The epidermal cells
are derived from lateral regions that overgrow the neuromeres after invagination of the neural precursors.
Since each invagination group consists of five to nine neural precursors, it can be estimated that an embryonic hemineuromere consists of about 220 neurons on average,
similar to Drosophila. However, in the adult spider Cupiennius salei the subesophageal ganglion consists of 49,000
neurons [8] indicating that over 40,000 neurons must be
generated during late embryonic and larval stages. In Drosophila melanogaster, 'embryonic' neuroblasts proliferate
again and give rise to larval and adult lineages after a
phase of cell cycle arrest from late embryogenesis to first
larval instar [9-11]. An analysis of the mitotic pattern during neurogenesis has revealed that neuroblasts are missing
in the spider [1]. In addition, most of the neural precursors do not divide after invagination. This raises the question of how additional neurons are generated that
contribute to the larval and adult CNS of the spider.

Results
In the spider Cupiennius salei the germband develops from
aggregations of cells that form the cephalic lobe and the
caudal lobe [12]. One to three prosomal segments are
generated by a subdivision of the cephalic lobe, while the
remaining segments arise sequentially from the caudal
lobe, the so-called posterior growth zone [12,13]. At the
beginning of neurogenesis (about 130 hours of development; stages after Seitz [12]) a longitudinal furrow forms

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/3

that divides the germband into left and right parts that
remain connected only at the cephalic lobe and the posterior growth zone. The two halves of the embryo move laterally until they finally meet at the dorsal midline (ca. 300
hours of developement). This process is called inversion
[12]. The formation of neural precursors and the invagination of these cells occurs during inversion [1].
Secondary invagination sites form after invagination of the
primary neural precursors
Although the invagination sites in the ventral neuroectoderm of the spider are generated in four subsequent waves
over a time period of three days, the neural precursors
detach form the apical surface at about the same time
between 200 and 230 hours of development. Fig. 1A
shows the final arrangement of the invagination sites
shortly before the neural precursors loose contact to the
apical surface. After invagination, the neural precursors
differentiate and a neuropil develops at the basal side of
the neuromeres (Fig. 1B, arrow). Since the epidermis
arises lateral and medial to the ventral hemi-neuromeres
(Fig. 1C, arrow), all cells of the central neurogenic region
are eventually incoporated into the ganglion, i.e., the ventral neuroectoderm does not give rise to epidermoblasts
and neuroblasts as in Drosophila melanogaster (see above).
A detailed analysis of the morphology of the ventral neuromeres after invagination of the neural precursor groups
revealed that the cells that remain apical form secondary
invagination sites (Fig. 1B, asterisks).

The secondary invagination sites can be distinguished
from the primary invagination groups by several morphological features. (1) Each secondary invagination group
contains up to 40 cells as compared to 5 to 8 cells that
form the primary invagination sites (Stollewerk et al.,
2001; Fig. 1B,1D; see also Fig. 4F). (2) The cell processes
of the secondary neural precursors do not extend straight
to the apical surface as the primary invaginating cells, but
face each other (Fig. 1D,1E). Microvilli extend into the
lumen between the opposite cell processes (Fig. 1E,
arrow). (3) While the primary neural precursors detach
from each other after invagination, the secondary invaginating cell groups remain attached to each other and
maintain their epithelial character. (Fig. 1D,1E) The individual cell processes are connected by cell junctions (Fig.
1E, arrow heads). (4) In contrast to the primary precursors, the secondary invaginating cell groups are surrounded by sheath cells. These cells are visible in the light
and electron microscope as brighter cells that separate the
individual invagination sites (Fig. 1B, arrowhead; Fig. 2,
asterisks; Fig. 3B). They extend long cell processes that
ensheath each cell group (Fig. 2A, arrowhead). Interestingly, the sheath cells that are located in the apical cell
layer form bizarre cytoplasmic shapes that extend into the
cell-free space at the ventral side of the embryo (Fig. 2C,

processes of the invaginating cells, revealed, that about 25
invagination sites are generated per hemi-segment. There
is no clear dividing line between the formation of
secondary invagination sites and invagination of the pri-

mary neural precurors. At 220 hours of development all
secondary invagination sites are visible (compare Fig. 4A
and 4B), while some of the primary precursor groups are
still attached to the apical surface (Fig. 4A, arrowhead).

However, at 240 hours all primary precursors have
detached from the apical surface and dissociated (Fig. 4B;
see also Fig. 1B). At about 250 hours, epidermal cells arise
lateral and medial to the ventral neuromeres and overgrow the ventral nerve cord within 50 hours [2]. In Fig. 4C
(280 hours of development) the border of the overgrowing epidermis is visible as a circle in the medial region of
each hemi-neuromere. Although the secondary invaginating cell groups detach from the apical surface at this time,
the individual cells of a group remain attached to each
other and persist as epithelial vesicles (Fig. 4D; see also
Fig. 1C). Due to morphogenetic movements at about 300
hours of development, the anterior-posterior extension of
the individual hemi-segments is reduced leading to a rearrangement of the position of the epithelial vesicles (Fig.
4E,4F,4G,4H). After 350 hours 8 of the 25 invaginated cell
groups are no longer visible indicating that the cells have
detached from each other (Fig. 4F,4H). However, 10 cell
groups are still visible at hatching (Fig. 4G,4I). Similar to
the ventral neuromeres, groups of cells invaginate from
the cephalic lobe neuroectoderm and persist as epithelial
vesicles until larval stages (Fig. 4J). DiI labelling of cells
within epithelial vesicles revealed that the cells of a group
are attached to each other (Fig. 5A,5B,5C) and their short,
thin cell processes run parallel to each other (Fig. 5B,
arrow). They do not show any morphological features of
differentiation, i.e. they do not grow long thin dendritic or
axonal processes. These data show that 10 groups of neural precursors per hemi-segment do not differentiate during embryogenesis but give rise to neural cells that will be
incorporated into the larval ganglia.
Dissociation of epithelial vesicles is not associated with cell
divisions
Analysis of the mitotic pattern during neurogenesis has
revealed that the formation of the primary invagination
sites is not connected with cell divisions [1]. In addition,
mitotic activity seems to be restricted to the apical layer of
the ventral neuroectoderm with the exception of a few
cells indiciating that most of the invaginated primary neural precursors differentiate without further divisions.
However, there are two waves of mitosis during the course
of neurogenesis [1]. After formation of most of the
primary invagination sites many cell divisions can be
observed in groups of cells and single cells in the apical
cell layer. The second wave arises when the primary precursors detach from the apical surface and the secondary
invagination sites begin to form. Cell divisions are also
restricted to the apical cell layer with the exception of a
few cells [1]. These data indicate that the number of
neuroectodermal cells is increased by cell proliferation
prior to the recruitment of secondary neural precursors. A
further analysis of the mitotic pattern during late embryogenesis with the mitotic marker anti-Phospho-Histon 3
and phalloidin-rhodamine revealed that only scattered

achaete-scute homologues and neurogenic genes are reexpressed during formation of the secondary precursors
Two achaete-scute homologues have been identified in the
spider [1]. CsASH1 is expressed like a proneural gene in
the neurogenic regions prior to formation of the primary
invagination sites and is necessary for the generation of
neural precursors. CsASH2, in contrast, shows a pan-neural mode of expression: it is exclusively expressed in all
invaginating neural precursors. Simlar to Drosophila melanogaster, the neurogenic genes Notch and Delta restrict the
proportion of cells that adopt a neural fate at each wave of
neural precursor formation [2].

During formation of the secondary invagination sites, the
spider achaete-scute homologues and neurogenic genes
[1,2] are re-expressed in the ventral neuromeres (Fig. 7).
After invagination of the primary neural precursors, the
expression of the achaete-scute homologues CsASH1 and
CsASH2 and the neurogenic genes CsDelta1 and CsDelta2
is down-regulated, while CsNotch remains expressed at
low levels in the ventral neuroectoderm (Fig.
7A,7B,7C,7D,7E). There is no clear dividing line between
the invagination of the primary neural precursors and the
formation of the secondary invagination sites (see above),
which is also obvious by CsDelta1 staining: while CsDelta1
is down-regulated in the primary neural precursors (Fig.
7C, arrow), transcripts accumulate at high levels in the
secondary invagination sites (Fig. 7C, arrowheads). Similarily, a transient stronger expression of CsNotch is visible
in the secondary invaginating cell groups (Fig. 7E, arrow).
Interestingly, CsASH1 is only expressed after formation of
the secondary invagination sites, in single cells and groups
of cells (Fig. 7F, arrow) while the gene shows a proneural
mode of expression during formation of the primary precursors [1]. Like CsASH1, CsASH2 shows a pan-neural
expression in the invaginating secondary precursors (Fig.
7G, arrow). CsDelta1 transcripts accumulate only in a
subset of the secondary invaginating cell groups while
CsDelta2 seems to be expressed in all of them (Fig. 7H,7I).
CsNotch shows a ubiquituous expression in the ventral
neuromeres (Fig. 7J).

Discussion
mitotic cells are present in the ventral neuromeres. The
pattern of cell divisions in the cephalic lobe and the prosomal segments (310 hours of development) shown in
Fig. 6A is representative for the late embryonic stages.
Since only a few mitotic cells are associated with
dissociating epithelial vesicles (Fig. 6B,6C), it can be
assumed that the secondary precursors differentiate without further divisions, similar to the primary neural
precursors.

Formation of epithelial vesicles â a conserved character in
arthropod neurogenesis?
Analysis of the ventral neuromeres of spider embryos after
invagination of the primary neural precursor groups
revealed that secondary neural precursors arise during late
embryogenesis that partially do not differentiate until larval stages. In contrast to the primary groups, the secondary
invaginating cells do not detach from each other after
invagination but maintain their epithelial character. In
common with epithelial cells, they show a pronounced
apico-basal polarity. The apical surface is covered with
microvilli, while the lateral surfaces adhere to those of

neighbouring cells of a group via specialized cell junctions, i.e. zonulae adhaerentes.
Although the formation of epithelial cell groups has not
been observed in the ventral neuromeres of other arthropods, epithelial vesicles have been described during development of the stomatogastric nervous system and the
brain in Drosophila melanogaster. After invagination of the
individual neuroblasts that pioneer the frontal connective
and recurrent nerve [14], three groups of cells invaginate
from the stomatogastric nervous system primordium [15].
They loose contact with the surrounding stomodeal epithelium and form elongated, hollow epithelial vesicles,
similar to the secondary neural precursors of the spider.
Finally, they dissociate into apolar cells and are
incorporated into different stomatogastric ganglia
[15,16]. In a similar way, the vesicle forming the optic
lobe invaginates from the posterior head region of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. In contrast to the
stomatogastric vesicles, this cell group remains epithelial
throughout embryogenesis and larval life [17].
It has been shown in Drosophila melanogaster that the
Delta-Notch signaling pathway is involved in maintaining
the epithelial character of the optic lobe and stomatogastric nervous system (SNS) precursors [16]. In Notch
mutant Drosophila melanogaster embryos, cells with the
identity of SNS and optic lobe precursors develop at
approximately normal numbers, but they do not form
epithelial vesicles. Instead, these cells appear as solid,
irregular clusters of apolar cells [15-17]. In the spider, the
function of CsNotch during development of the secondary
neural precursors could not be analysed, because injection
of ds CsNotch RNA leads to a premature differentiation of
neural precursors due to an ealier function of CsNotch in
lateral inhibition [2]. However, the up-regulation of
CsNotch in the secondary invagination sites suggests a role
in formation of the epithelial vesicles (see Fig. 7E).
Similar to Notch, the proneural genes achaete, scute and
lethal of scute are continuously expressed in the SNS of
Drosophila melanogaster [18]. Loss of proneural gene
function leads to the absence of a subpopulation of SNS
precursors and subsequently to an irregular invagination
of the SNS placode. Furthermore, proneural genes seem to
promote the dissociation of SNS precursors from the epithelial vesicles, since loss of proneural gene function
results in a delay of this process. Similar to Drosophila melanogaster, both achaete-scute homologues of the spider are
expressed in the epithelial vesicles that are formed by the
secondary neural precursors. However, in contrast to its
function in the recruitment of the primary neural precurors, the expression pattern of the spider proneural gene
CsASH1 does not suggest a role in the establishment of the
secondary neural fate. CsASH1 transcripts can only be

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/3

detected in subsets of neural precursors after generation of
the secondary invagination sites. A similar expression pattern can be observed for CsASH2, although the transcripts
in the primary neural precursors are down-regulated later
than the CsASH1 transcripts. The function of these two
genes during generation of the secondary invagination
sites and the formation of the epithelial vesicles could not
be analysed. Due to their ealier role in the recruitment and
differentiation of the primary precurors, injection of ds
RNA of either gene leads to severe morphological defects
in the ventral neuroectoderm [1].
The formation of epithelial vesicles leads to a delay in
neural differentiation
As revealed by DiI-labeling, secondary neural precursors
within epithelial vesicles do not show any morphological
features of differentiation. Obviously, the formation of
epithelial vesicles after invagination leads to a delay in the
differentiation of the corresponding neural precursors.
Although the epithelial vesicles are formed at about the
same time, they dissociate from each other subsequently.
About half of them are still visible at the end of embryogenesis indicating that they provide neural precursors for
larval stages.

In insects a distinct mechanism has evolved for generating
larval neural precursors during embryonic life. After a
phase of cell cycle arrest from late embryogenesis to first
larval instar, 'embryonic' neuroblasts proliferate again.
[9,10]. Both in Drosophila melanogaster and in Manduca
sexta, the larval progeny of these neuroblasts accumulate
in groups of cells that are separated by glial cell processes
and do not finish their differentiation until the onset of
metamorphosis [10,19]. It has been shown that the
secreted glycoprotein anachronism (ana) regulates release
of central brain neuroblasts from cell cycle arrest [20]. Ana
is expressed in glial cells that ensheath central brain and
optic lobe neuroblasts. In ana mutant larvae, neuroblasts
proliferate earlier than in normal development which in
turn leads to a premature differentation of neurons in certain brain regions. This heterochronic defect has an
impact on the axonal pattern: the ana mutant phenotype
ranges from subtle missrouting of fiber tracts to massive
disorganization that affects the entire optic lobe [20].
These data show that factors regulating the differentiation
state of neural precursors can have an important influence
on the organization of neural networks.
The distinct morphology of the sheath cells in the spider
neuromeres, i.e. their translucent cytoplasm, the absence
of microvilli and the extension of cell processes that
enwrap the neural precursors suggests that these are glial
cells. Further analysis will show if these cells express genes
that can influence the epithelial organization, i.e. the

comparable to the glial cells of Drosophila melanogaster.
Formation of epithelial vesicles â a basal mode of
neurogenesis?
A recent study on neurogenesis in the onychophoran
Euperipatoides kanangrensis shows that, rather than
forming individual invagination groups, the whole
medial regions of the hemi-segments invaginate into the
embryo [21]. The invaginated cells remain attached to
each other forming transitory epithelial vesicles. Although
the phylogenetic position of Onychophora is still being
debated, they are generally placed basally in the arthropodan clade [22-27]. Since onychophorans have retained
many pleisiomorphic features, it can be assumed that they
reflect a basal mode of CNS development [28-30]. This
leads to the following model of changes in neural precursor formation during arthropod evolution: the basal
mode of neurogenesis is the invagination of one large
cluster of neural precursors from the central region of each
hemi-neuromere. These clusters form transitory epithelial
vesicles in the ventral neuromeres [31]. An advanced
mode of neurogenesis is seen in chelicerates and myriapods: groups of cells that arise in several waves at stereotyped positions invaginate form the ventral
neuroectoderm [1,3,4]. Interestingly, both chelicerate and
myripod neurogenesis reflects some ancestral features. In
the spider, epithelial vesicles are formed by secondary
invaginating cell groups, while in myriapods the whole
central regions of the hemi-neuromeres sink into the
embryo after invagination of individual groups of neural
precursors [3,32]. An even complexer mode of neurogenesis is seen in insects and crustaceans: individual neuroblasts are singled out from the ventral neuroectoderm that
divide in sterotyped patterns to give rise to ganglion
mother cells and finally neurons [33-42].

Materials and Methods
Cupiennius salei stocks
Fertilized females of the Central American wandering spider Cupiennius salei Keyserling (Chelicerata, Arachnida,
Araneae, Ctenidae) were obtained from Ernst-August
Seyfarth, Frankfurt, Germany. Embryos were collected as
described before [1].
Histology and stainings
Whole-mount in situ hybridisations were performed as
described [1]. Phalloidin-rhodamine staining of spider
embryos was performed as has been described for flies
[43]. Anti-Phospho-Histone 3 immunocytochemestry has
been performed as described [1].
DiI-labeling
After chemically removing the chorion, embryos were
fixed in 4 % formaldehyde in PBS and 1 vol heptane. The
vitelline membrane was removed with needles and the
embryos stained with phalloidin-FITC. Flat preparations
of these embryos were attached to a coverslip with a double-sticky tape and covered with PBS. 1,1'-dioctadecyl
3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)
was dissolved in ethanol and applied with glass needles.
A small droplet of DiI was injected into single or several
cells of an invagination group using a 63 Ã water-immersion lens and a FITC filter on a Zeiss fixed stage microscope and a micromanipulator.

Conclusions
To summarize, the model suggests that the invagination
of large groups of neuroepithelial cells that form transient
epithelial vesicles represents the basal mode of neurogenesis. Subsequently, more parameters have been introduced to the process of neurogenesis during arthropod
evolution, i.e. sequential invagination/delamination of
neural precursors and connection between neural precursor formation and cell proliferation. It can be assumed
that these additional parameters have contributed to the
diversity of neural precursor populations. This diversity
might have been used as an evolutionary tool to develop
neural networks that are adapted to the specialized behaviour and morphologies of the individual arthropod
groups.
