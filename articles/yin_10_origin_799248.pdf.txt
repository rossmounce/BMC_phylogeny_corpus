The origin of populations of Arabidopsis thaliana
in China, based on the chloroplast DNA
sequences

Abstract
Background: In the studies incorporating worldwide sampling of A. thaliana populations, the samples from East
Asia, especially from China, were very scattered; and the studies focused on global patterns of cpDNA genetic
variation among accessions of A. thaliana are very few. In this study, chloroplast DNA sequence variability was used
to infer phylogenetic relationships among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from around the world, with the
emphasis on samples from China.
Results: A data set comprising 77 accessions of A. thaliana, including 19 field-collected Chinese accessions
together with three related species (A. arenosa, A. suecica, and Olimarabidopsis cabulica) as the out-group, was
compiled. The analysis of the nucleotide sequences showed that the 77 accessions of A. thaliana were partitioned
into two major differentiated haplotype classes (MDHCs). The estimated divergence time of the two MDHCs was
about 0.39 mya. Forty-nine haplotypes were detected among the 77 accessions, which exhibited nucleotide
diversity (π) of 0.00169. The Chinese populations along the Yangtze River were characterized by five haplotypes,
and the two accessions collected from the middle range of the Altai Mountains in China shared six specific
variable sites.
Conclusions: The dimorphism in the chloroplast DNA could be due to founder effects during late Pleistocene
glaciations and interglacial periods, although introgression cannot be ruled out. The Chinese populations along the
Yangtze River may have dispersed eastwards to their present-day locations from the Himalayas. These populations
originated from a common ancestor, and a rapid demographic expansion began approximately 90,000 years ago.
Two accessions collected from the middle range of the Altai Mountains in China may have survived in a local
refugium during late Pleistocene glaciations. The natural populations from China with specific genetic
characteristics enriched the gene pools of global A. thaliana collections.

Background
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh is an annual weed
belonging to the family Brassicaceae (Cruciferae). The
species is native to Europe and Central Asia, but is now
widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere ranging
from 68°N (northern Scandinavia) to Equator (mountains of Tanzania and Kenya) [1]. Many characteristics,
from morphological traits to protein and DNA markers,
have been used to evaluate natural genetic variation

among populations, and to reconstruct an intraspecific
phylogeny, for A. thaliana (for example, [2-9]). It has
been found that many nuclear genes comprise two or
more major differentiated haplotypes, generally referred
to as allelic dimorphism [10-20]. Balancing selection or
ancient population subdivision was often invoked to
explain the pattern. The major mechanisms for balancing selection are heterozygote advantage, frequencydependent selection, or environmental heterogeneity. It
is well known that A. thaliana has an inbreeding mating
system. The estimated outcrossing rate of the species is
1% or less [21]. It seems difficult to imagine that so
many loci in A. thaliana have experienced balancing
selection via heterozygote advantage [22]. Therefore,

frequency-dependent selection and/or diversifying selection might be the driving forces for the dimorphism
phenomenon, as in the case of pathogen resistance (R)
genes [17,18,23]. It is not clear yet if the dimorphism
also exists in the chloroplast genome.
The chloroplast genome of A. thaliana is a circular
DNA composed of 154,478 bp with a pair of inverted
repeats of 26,264 bp separated by small and large singlecopy regions of 17,780 bp and 84,170 bp, respectively
[24]. The uniparentally inherited chloroplast genome has
been utilized in many studies in plant population and
evolutionary genetics. However, studies focused on global
patterns of cpDNA genetic variation among accessions of
A. thaliana are scattered. In an investigation on the
maternal origins of A. suecica, 12 cpDNA regions were
sequenced for 25 A. thaliana accessions, which were
mainly collected from Scandinavia [25]. These authors
found considerable variation existed among the non-coding single-copy sequences in the chloroplast genome of
A. thaliana. In another study, the trnL-trnF cpDNA
intergenic spacer region of 475 individuals from 167 A.
thaliana populations in its native range was sequenced
and 16 haplotypes were identified [8]. Based on the chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequence data, Beck et al proposed the Caucasian area as the possible ancestral area of
A. thaliana, and suggested four possibilities for the origin
of East Asian populations. They also found that the
maternal components of A. suecica shared a high similarity to those in the Asian metapopulation of A. thaliana,
especially to those from China [8].
In the studies incorporating worldwide sampling of A.
thaliana populations, the samples from East Asia were
very scattered. He et al conducted a study on the
genetic diversity of 19 natural Arabidopsis thaliana
populations in China based on ISSR and RAPD makers,
and found that about 42-45% of the total genetic variation existed within populations and there was a significant correlation between geographic distance and
genetic distance [7]. However, the phylogenetic relationships of Chinese populations with those distributed in
other regions of the world, and the history of population
dispersal in this region, are not clear.
The goals of the present survey are: (1) to examine
global patterns of cpDNA genetic variation in A. thaliana; (2) to infer phylogenetic relationships among A.
thaliana accessions from all over the world based on
cpDNA sequence data, with particular focus on Chinese
populations; and (3) to discuss the possible origin(s) of
the Chinese populations. It was found in this study that
dimorphism did exist in the chloroplast genome of A.
thaliana; the 77 accessions studied were grouped into
two major clusters; and the Chinese populations might
have two independent origins.

Results
Nucleotide variation in the chloroplast DNA sequences

Seventy-seven A. thaliana accessions were used in the
survey, among them 19 accessions were field collected
in China (Table 1). All sampling locations in China
were separated by at least 50 km, with most of the locations separated by more than 300 km (Figure 1, Table
2). No cp DNA polymorphism was detected within
either accession AHyxx or Abd-0, therefore only one
individual was chosen for each accession for DNA
sequence analysis. About 10600 nucleotides from the
chloroplast genome were amplified and sequenced for
each accession, of which 8750 nucleotides of non-coding
fragments were retained for analysis.
The combined data matrix contained 149 variable
nucleotide sites. Among them, 21 were mononucleotide
repeat polymorphisms, one was a dinucleotide repeat
polymorphism, and four were complicated length variations. These 26 length polymorphisms were excluded in
the analyses. The other 123 polymorphic variations
comprised 95 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
26 insertion/deletion events (indels) and two small fragment inversions. Only one site exhibited three-base
polymorphism and the other 122 sites showed two-base
polymorphism (Figure 2).
The two small fragmental inversions were located at
sites 3633-3637 (Inversion 1) and sites 6501-6509
(Inversion 2). The characteristics of this kind of reversion were: (1) a central region of 5 nt (TTACT in the
Inversion 1 of Col-0) or 9 nt (AGTAGAATA in the
Inversion 2 of Col-0), which could mutate to its reverse
complement sequence (AGTAA and TATTCTACT,
respectively); and (2) two flanking sequences of 18 nt
(Inversion 1) or 20 nt (Inversion 2), respectively (Figure
3). The two flanking sequences could be reversely complemented to each other. It is most likely that each of
these two small fragmental inversions could be generated by only one or very few mutation event(s), but it
resulted in multiple SNPs.
Nucleotide diversity (π) for the entire sequenced
regions was 0.00169, but ranged from 0.00010 for the
ycf3-trnS intergenic spacer (primer pair 4) to 0.01053
for psaJ-rpl33 (primer pair 9) (Table 3).
Less frequent nucleotide polymorphisms (such as singleton or doubleton) were in excess for the sequenced
regions. Singletons were found at a very high frequency:
44 among the 95 SNPs and 10 among the 26 indels
were singletons (Figure 2). The excess of low-frequency
polymorphisms resulted in negative Tajima’s D, Fu and
Li’s D* and F* values for most of the sequenced segments; for example, 10 out of 11 Tajima’s D values, nine
out of 11 Fu and Li’s D* values and 10 out of 11 Fu and
Li’s F* values were negative (Table 3). The values for

the combined data matrix were -1.17234 (Tajima’s D, P
> 0.10), -2.36692 (Fu and Li’s D*, P < 0.05) and -2.25760
(Fu and Li’s F*, 0.10 > P > 0.05, critical). When Fu and
Li’s D and F tests were conducted using the A. arenosa
ortholog as the reference sequence, similar results were
obtained: eight out of 11 Fu and Li’s D values and nine
out of 11 Fu and Li’s F values were negative and for the
combined data matrix; both the values were negative
(-2.06178 and -2.00798, respectively, 0.10 > P > 0.05;
Table 3).
In total, we identified three types of nucleotide variations among the aligned sequences: SNPs, length polymorphisms (including indels), and two small fragmental
inversions.
Phylogenetic relationships among the accessions

Because the single base changes in the two short
inverted regions were not independent events, they were
excluded from the phylogenetic analysis. Two distinct
clusters with high bootstrap values were retrieved in the
NJ tree. One cluster included 42 accessions and the
other included 35 accessions (Figure 4). Although the
topology of the MP tree differed to that of the NJ tree,

one branch with 35 accessions corresponded to one of
the two clusters in the NJ tree (Figure 5). In general, no
significant correlation was detected between geographical origins and clusterings in the phylogenetic trees.
Accessions from the same country, such as four accessions from Italy (Bl-1, Ct-1, Mr-0 and Sei-0) and five
accessions from USA (Berkeley, BG1, Col-0, FM10 and
HS10) failed to cluster together, but were scattered on
different branches. This lack of phylogeographic structure conforms to the hypothesis of a rapid recent expansion of the species with strong involvement of humanmediated migrations [1].
Although there was incongruence between the two
phylogenies, the topological relationship was relatively
stable among a large number of accessions. We identified four stable branches in both trees (A, B, D, and E
in Figures 4 and 5). The only major difference was in
branch C. It was placed within one of the two clusters
in the NJ tree, but formed a deep polytonous branch in
the MP tree, containing the same accessions except Cvi0, an accession from Cape Verde Island. The branches
A-E comprised 61 out of the 77 accessions.

Discrimination of two major differentiated haplotypes
among A. thaliana accessions

When only the parsimony-informative sites were considered, the nucleotide variation of the 77 accessions was
structured into two major different haplotype classes
(MDHCs, Figure 6). The MDHC-I and MDHC-II classes
were composed of 42 and 35 accessions, respectively, and
they corresponded well to the two clusters in the NJ tree.
The MDHC-I and MDHC-II classes differed at five

nucleotide sites (C to G at site 3129, T to C at site 3703, G
to T at site 4304, G to T at site 5379, and T to G at site
6777; Figure 2), and these sites were within a fragment
about 20 kb long from trnL to rpl33 in the chloroplast
genome.
For interspecific comparison, the homologous sequences
of three related species, Olimarabidopsis cabulica, A. arenosa and A. suecica, were aligned with the 77 A. thaliana
accessions. They were identical to those in MDHC-II of A.

thaliana at all five nucleotide sites where the two MDHCs
could be distinguished from each other (Figure 7).
All the sites except the inverted length variants were
used to form a binary data set for haplotype network
analysis. Forty-nine haplotypes were identified in the 77
accessions of A. thaliana. The 49 haplotypes were also
bifurcated to form two haplogroups (Figure 8). Haplogroup 1 (21 haplotypes) and Haplogroup 2 (28 haplotypes) differed at the same five sites (3129, 3703, 4304,
5379 and 6777) where MDHC-I and -II differed, and
the accessions in Haplogroup 1 and Haplogroup 2 were
identical to those in MDHC-I and -II, respectively.
Estimated divergence time for MDHC-I and MDHC-II, and
demographic expansion of a monophyletic group of
accessions in Asia

The K value between A. arenosa and 77 A. thaliana
accessions was 0.0280 ± 0.0037. Using Equation 1, the
substitution rate per nucleotide site per year for the
sequenced chloroplast regions was 2.8 × 10 -9 . The K
value between MDHC-I and MDHC-II was 0.0022 ±
0.0005. Therefore, the estimated divergence time for
MDHC-I and MDHC-II was estimated (using Equation
2) to be about 0.39 ± 0.09 mya.
Although no significant correlation was detected
between geographic origin and genetic distance, the 17
accessions collected along the Yangtze River, China, were
always clustered together with Kas-2, an accession from
Kashmir (74°E, 34°N) in both NJ and MP trees (Figures 4
and 5). In the network analysis, they congregated closely
and formed a distinct cluster (Cluster A) in Haplogroup 1

(Figure 8). The level of nucleotide polymorphism of the 18
accessions was very low (π = 0.00030), only six haplotypes
(h) were detected (five specific in the 17 accessions along
the Yangtze River) and haplotype diversity (Hd) was 0.778.
In comparison, the values of π, h and Hd for the 77 accessions were 0.00169, 49 and 0.977, respectively.
To test the model of demographic population growth in
the region from which the 18 accessions were sampled,
especially for the 17 accessions along the Yangtze River, a
mismatch distribution analysis was conducted. Each small
fragment inversion was treated as a SNP in the analysis.
The SSD between the observed and expected mismatch
distribution was 0.093 (P = 0.062) and HRag was 0.300 (P
= 0.022). There was an only marginally significant difference in SSD between the observed and the predicted pairwise difference distribution under the sudden-expansion
model. This result provided evidence of rapid population
expansion along the Yangtze River. The average τ-value
was 4.521 (95% confidence intervals: 0.684~8.197). The
initial time when the populations expanded along the
Yangtze River were calculated using Equation 4 to obtain
u (2.52 × 10 -5 ), and then using Equation 3 to obtain t
(0.897 × 105). Therefore, the initial time of expansion was
estimated to be about 90,000 years ago.

Discussion
The level and pattern of nucleotide variation in the
sequenced chloroplast regions

The π value of the sequenced chloroplast regions among
global samples of A. thaliana accessions was 0.00169,

which is about one-quarter of that of the mean nucleotide diversity of the nuclear genes in A. thaliana [1], but
double that in another study by Sall et al [25], in which
12 non-coding single-copy cpDNA regions were
sequenced for 25 A. thaliana accessions (π = 0.00061).
The differences may be due to the different sampling
strategies. The 25 A. thaliana accessions in the latter
study were mainly collected from Scandinavia, whereas
the 77 accessions in the present study were sampled
worldwide. For a highly self-fertilizing species, geographical structure may play an important role on a smaller
scale in the level of polymorphism, at least for the uniparentally inherited chloroplast genome. For example,
the π value reduced to 0.00030 if only 18 accessions in
branch A (Kas-2 and 17 accessions along the Yangtze
River) were considered.

Inversions in the chloroplast genome exist in monocotyledonous plants and the Asteraceae. The length of
these inversions range from 0.5 to 28 kb, and all have
phylogenetic implications [26,27]. The length of the
inversions found in the present study were much
shorter, only about 18-20 bp. The accessions with inversions were found mostly scattered on branches B, D, E
in the NJ and MP trees. The exception is in branch A,
where all accessions had inversion 2. The mechanism
responsible for these inversions is not known, but they
might have originated several times during the population expansion process. Therefore, it is advisable not to
consider them for phylogenetic analysis.
Dimorphism in the chloroplast DNA of A. thaliana

Two significantly differentiated haplotype classes could
be identified in the sequenced chloroplast DNA regions,

just as in the allelic dimorphism found in some nuclear
DNA sequences of A. thaliana. At least three different
interpretations have been proposed to explain the
nuclear dimorphism phenomenon. First, balanced polymorphisms were usually the mutations maintained in
populations by natural selection through heterozygotic
advantage [17,28]. The chloroplast genome is maternally
inherited in A. thaliana, and the DNA regions selected
for analysis in this study are intergenic regions. Therefore, the dimorphism found in the chloroplast may not
be caused by balancing selection via heterozygotic
advantage. Furthermore, in our investigation, the value
of the Tajima’s D-value was negative. A negative Tajima’s D value is a general feature of the Arabidopsis

thaliana genome [29], and is correlated to demographic
factors, such as population growth [30], rather than
non-neutral forces such as selection [8].
A second explanation for the nuclear dimorphism is
that introgression might result in the allelic dimorphism.
Chloroplast DNA introgression has been widely
reported [e.g., [31,32]]. In this study, we found that two
related species, Olimarabidopsis cabulica and A. arenosa, had all five identical nucleotide site variations with
MDHC-II of A. thaliana, which were the ‘markers’ to
separate MDHC-II from MDHC-I. However, the K
values between O. cabulica and the 77 accessions of A.
thaliana, and between A. arenosa and the 77 A. thaliana accessions, are 0.0395 and 0.0280, respectively,

whereas that between the two MDHCs of A. thaliana is
only 0.0022. The interspecific genetic distance is at least
one order of magnitude higher than intraspecific genetic
distances. The estimated divergence time between O.
cabulica and A. thaliana is about 10~14 mya, and that
between A. arenosa and A. thaliana is about 3.0~5.8
mya [33]. The genetic distances based on cpDNA
between these species pairs correlate to their nuclear
gene-based estimated divergent time. These results indicated that the dimorphism in cpDNA found in this
study was not the result of recent introgressive hybridization events, but we cannot rule out the possibility that
the dimorphism might be the result of ancient introgression events. Hybridization between A. thaliana and its
closely related species does occur in nature. For example, several studies confirmed the allotetraploid species,
A. suecica, resulted from a hybridization event between
A. thaliana and A. arenosa about 10,000 to 50,000 years
ago [e.g., [25,34,35]].
The third explanation for genetic dimorphism is
demographic factors, such as founder effects. Being a
small annual weed, A. thaliana is a poor competitor in
dense vegetation whereas the highly self-fertilizing characteristic makes it capable of founding a population
even from a single seed. As a result, this species has a
tendency for rapid colonization and extinction cycles
[1,7,36]. Founder effects might have occurred repeatedly
in the evolutionary history of A. thaliana. The founder
event(s) could enable some rare alleles to spread into
additional populations when the founder population
expanded rapidly if the unoccupied ecological niches
were favourable. The divergence time between MDHC-I
and MDHC-II was estimated to be about 0.36 mya
based on our cpDNA data. This is earlier than the estimated time of demographic expansion during the
Eemian interglacial (about 0.122 mya; [8]). Therefore,
another possible explanation for the cpDNA dimorphism might be a founder effect followed by limited gene
flow during late Pleistocene glaciations and interglacial
periods.
As the accessions in MDHC-II share five specific variable sites with A. arenosa, the chloroplast genomes in
MDHC-II might represent more ancient types than
those in MDHC-I. It is also supported by the fact that
more haplotypes are found in MDHC-II (28) than in
MDHC-I (21).

The 26 accessions of A. thaliana from Asia included in
this study are scattered compared to those collected

belong to MDHC-I. Of the MDHC-II group, two collections from China (XJalt and XJqhx) and two from
Kazakhstan (9481 and Kz10) are within or very close to
the Altai Mountains. Although these four accessions

were not clustered in the same clade in the phylogenies,
the two accessions from China were always on the same
branch. One of the Kazakhstan accessions (Kz10) was
clustered with XJalt and XJqhx together with a Russian
accession (N1, from Europe) in the NJ tree (Figure 4).
XJalt and XJqhx are unique in that they share six specific variable sites (Figure 2), the most number of specific
variable sites in this study. The provenances of these
two accessions are about 115 km apart and located in
the middle of the Altai Mountains range. Based on the
cpDNA data, the populations on the Altai Mountain

range may have dispersed there during one of the late
Pleistocene glaciations, and some local habitats along
the southern slopes of the Altai Mountains might have
served as refugia. In contrast to some refugia in Europe,
where A. thaliana populations had contributed the postglacial colonization of western and northern Europe [9],
some populations in the Asian refugia, such as XJalt and
XJqhx, became relatively isolated genetically from other
populations after glaciers retreated. Therefore, some
fixed mutations were accumulated specifically in these
populations. It is also noticed by Beck et al [8] that

“differentiation is particularly strong between the Central Asian refugia and all others, suggesting that either
small historical population sizes in Central Asia, relatively limited gene flow between Central Asia and other
areas, or a combination of the two have produced relatively strong genetic drift in this region”. The other two
Asian accessions in the MDHC-II group are from Japan
(Tsu-0) and India (Kas-1). Although Tsu-0 was clustered
with Alc-0 from Spain, the bootstrap support is poor in
both NJ and MP trees (68% and 52%, respectively). Tsu0 has two specific variable sites, but only shares one
specific site with Alc-0. Its phylogenetic relationships
with other accessions are unclear and more samples are
needed to clarify its origin. Kas-1 from India shares four
specific variable sites with four accessions from Europe
(Figure 2); this accession will be discussed later.

In MDHC-I, 17 accessions collected along the Yangtze
River, China, were clustered together with an accession
from India (Kas-2). All data suggested that the chloroplast genomes of these 18 accessions originated from a
single common ancestor. The initial time of expansion
of the populations along the Yangtze River was estimated to be about 90,000 years ago based on the
cpDNA sequences. At least we can rule out the possibility that these populations were introduced by recent
human activities, like the populations found in the USA.
Both highlands of the western Himalayas and Caucasus
have been proposed as possible ancestral areas of A.
thaliana [8,37]. The populations along the Yangtze
River could have dispersed eastwards from the ancestral
area to the present-day locations via the Himalayas or
Kunlun Mountains, which have an east-west trend. Kas-

2 was collected in Kashmir, India (74°E, 34°N), on the
southern slopes of the Himalayas. It shares a most frequent haplotype with seven Chinese accessions, but it
can be distinguished from them only by one specific
variable site (Figure 2). There are at least two explanations for the observed distribution pattern. The first is
that Kas-2 represents the type that is most similar to
the ancestor of the Yangtze River populations, and the
expansion of the latter was immediately or very shortly
after the dispersal event. However, in the phylogenies,
Kas-2 is not basal among the 18 accessions. The second
explanation is that Kas-2 might have been introduced to
Kashmir from China. It is uncertain which explanation
is more likely. More samples from the western part of
the Himalayas and Kunlun Mountains are definitely
needed for identification of the possible ancestral haplotype of the Yangtze River populations.
The other three accessions in MDHC-I are H Tsukaya
from Japan, Sorbo from Tajikistan, and Kas-1 from
India. The former shares one haplotype with four accessions from Europe and one accession from the USA. It
is apparent that it represents a recent introduction to
Japan, possibly by human activity. The accession from
Tajikistan has a specific haplotype that is characterized
by four unique SNPs (Figure 2), and it shares a haplotype with one accession from Sweden, Italy and Libya,
respectively. Kas-1 shares the exact haplotype with two
accessions from Russia (Wassilewskija, Ms-0) and one
from Austria (Pi-0). Although Kas-1 and Kas-2 were collected at the same locality (74°E, 34°N), as stated on the
ABRC seed stock centre website, their genetic distinctness has been noted previously [38]. Re-sampling from
their original locality might help in clarifying the
confusion.
The possible maternal parent of Arabidopsis suecica

Arabidopsis suecica is an allotetraploid species whose
maternal parent is A. thaliana. The species originated
more than 20,000 years ago from an allotetraploid
hybrid between A. thaliana and A. arenosa [25,35].
Several studies indicate that the ancestral area of A.
suecica is in Europe [e.g., [33]]. However, a recent
study by Beck et al [8] revealed a genetic similarity
between A. suecica and Chinese accessions of A. thaliana. In the present study, the cpDNA sequences of A.
suecica were more similar to those of some European
accessions, especially Chi-0 from Russia (34°E, 54°N).
Based on the comparison of cpDNA in this study, it is
most likely that the maternal parent of A. suecica was
from Europe.

Conclusions
Elucidating the dispersal of A. thaliana within Asia is a
very complicated issue. Temperature fluctuations during
glaciations and interglacial periods in the late

Page 13 of 16

Pleistocene, the complex mountain ranges in the Central
and Central-East parts of Asia, and human activities
have all contributed to the present-day distribution patterns. It is clear from this study that some populations
in East Asia, such as those along the Yangtze River,
were dispersed there along the Himalaya or Kunlun
Mountain ranges and underwent rapid expansion about
90,000 years ago. Altai Mountains may have provided
refugia for A. thaliana during Pleistocene glaciations.
However, more samples from the Altai, Kunlun, and
western part of the Himalaya mountain ranges are
needed to elucidate more fully the dispersal history of
A. thaliana populations in Asia.

Methods
Plants material and DNA extraction

Seventy-seven A. thaliana accessions were used in the
survey, seeds of 50 accessions were obtained from the
Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC; University of Nottingham), eight accessions from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC; Ohio State
University) and 19 accessions were field collected in
China (Table 1). All sampling locations in China were
separated by at least 50 km, with most of the locations
separated by more than 300 km (Figure 1, Table 2). The
nomenclature of the Chinese accessions follows that of
He et al. [7]. Two taxa closely related to A. thaliana, i.
e., A. arenosa and A. suecica, and one taxon closely
related to the genus Arabidopsis, i.e., Olimarabidopsis
cabulica, were used as out-groups. Seeds of selected
plants were sterilized and germinated on MS solid agar
medium, and then transplanted into soil, as described
previously [7]. The seedlings were grown in a controlled
environment at 22°C with a photoperiod of 16 h light/8
h dark. About 1 g of green leaf material was harvested
from a single plant for each accession and used for total
cellular DNA extraction using the CTAB method [39].
PCR amplification, DNA sequencing, and sequence
alignment

Intron or intergenic regions were selected for PCR
amplification in order to obtain maximum phylogenetic
information. Eleven pairs of PCR primers were designed
based on the Col-0 chloroplast genome sequences (GenBank accession no. AP000423) using the software Primer Premier [40]. All 11 pairs of primers are positioned
in protein- or RNA-coding gene regions flanking the
target fragments, and the length of the fragments ranged
from 570 nt to 1496 nt (Table 4). The amplified products were purified with the PCR Purification and Gel
Extraction Kit (V-gene Biotechnology), and sequenced
with an ABI 377 Automated DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer). To ensure the accuracy of the nucleotide
sequences, the sequences on both strands were determined, all polymorphisms were visually confirmed, and

Yin et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/22

for ambiguous polymorphisms PCR amplification and
sequencing were repeated.
Two accessions (AHyxx and Abd-0) were randomly
chosen to detect intra-accession polymorphism. The
seeds of AHyxx were field collected from at least 30
individual plants in Yuexi County, Anhui Province in
southeast China [7]. The seeds of Abd-0 were obtained
from the ABRC but were originally collected in the UK.
Green leaf material was harvested from 10 individual
plants for both accessions and total cellular DNA was
extracted separately. PCR amplification, purification and
sequencing were conducted as described above.
The DNA sequences were aligned initially using
MEGA 4.1 [41]. After alignment, the sequences were
edited manually. Gaps were positioned to minimize
nucleotide mismatches. The 3’- and 5’- flanking regions
of the protein-coding sequences were trimmed off and
only the intergenic spacer or intron regions were
retained for further analysis.
The nucleotide sequences of 11 fragments from each
accession were concatenated sequence by sequence to
form a combined sequence set. The combined sequence
sets formed a combined data matrix of 77 × 8978
nucleotides.
The sequences of these fragments have been submitted to the GenBank [42], and their accession numbers are listed in Table 4.

Population genetics and phylogenetic analyses

Polymorphism analyses were conducted for both intraand inter-specific comparison using DnaSP4.50 [43].
Nucleotide variation was estimated as nucleotide diversity
(π) [44]. The number of haplotypes was denoted by h and
haplotype diversity was denoted by Hd. Some statistical
methods, such as Tajima’s D test [45] and Fu and Li’s D*,
D, F* and F test [46], were conducted to test the neutral
mutation hypothesis. The A. arenosa orthologs were used
as the out-group sequences when needed.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the combined data matrix. Both neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods were used. The NJ tree
was constructed using MEGA 4.1, and Maximum Composite Likelihood distance [47] was used and gaps were
treated as a complete deletion. The analysis was done
with 1000 bootstrap replicates of the data. The MP tree
was constructed using PAUP*4.0 [48]. Bootstrap values
were calculated from 1000 replicates with a heuristic
search strategy. Gaps in the alignments of the sequences
were treated as missing data.
To visualize the relationship among haplotypes, a network was constructed as described by [49] using NETWORK version 4.2.0.1. A default weight of 10 was
applied to each site. ‘Epsilon = 0’ was chosen for constructing the network for the 77 A. thaliana accessions
using the median joining algorithm.

Estimated divergence time and demographic analysis

To estimate the divergence time for the A. thaliana
accessions, the homologous sequences of A. arenosa
were used as a reference. The divergence time between
A. arenosa and A. thaliana was estimated as 5.1-5.4 million years ago (mya) [50]. In another study, Clauss and
Koch estimated a divergence time between these two
species as 3.0~5.8 mya [33]. Here we adopted a divergence time of 5 mya to simplify the calculations [51].
MEGA 4.1 was used to calculate the number of base
substitutions per site from averaging over all sequence
pairs (K) [52] between A. arenosa and the 77 A. thaliana accessions. Standard error estimates were obtained
by a bootstrap procedure with 1000 replicates. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated
from the dataset (complete deletion option). The substitution rate per nucleotide site per year (μ) was calculated as:

  K / 2T

(1)

where T is the divergence time between A. arenosa
and A. thaliana. The K value between two A. thaliana
accessions (or groups) was calculated using MEGA 4.1
as mentioned above. The values for the divergence time
of the two A. thaliana accessions (or accession groups),
T, was calculated as:
T  K / 2

(2)

To test for evidence of demographic population
growth, a mismatch distribution analysis [53-55] was
conducted by using Arlequin 3.11 [56]. Parametric bootstrapping with 1000 replicates was used to evaluate the
sum of squared deviations (SSD) between observed and
expected mismatch distribution, the raggedness index of
Harpending (HRag) [57], the mode of the mismatch distribution (τ), and the upper and lower 95% confidence
limits around the estimate of τ. For estimating the
expansion time t, we adopted:
t   / 2u

(3)

where t is the expansion time in number of generations, τ is the mode of the mismatch distribution, and u
is the mutation rate per generation for the entire DNA
sequence [54,55]. The u was calculated as:
u  mTg

(4)

where m T is the number of the nucleotides of the
entire DNA sequence, μ is the substitution rate per
nucleotide site per year, and g is the generation time in
years.
