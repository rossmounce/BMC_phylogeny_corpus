Abstract
Background: Roseobacter litoralis OCh149, the type species of the genus, and Roseobacter denitrificans OCh114
were the first described organisms of the Roseobacter clade, an ecologically important group of marine bacteria.
Both species were isolated from seaweed and are able to perform aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis.
Results: The genome of R. litoralis OCh149 contains one circular chromosome of 4,505,211 bp and three plasmids
of 93,578 bp (pRLO149_94), 83,129 bp (pRLO149_83) and 63,532 bp (pRLO149_63). Of the 4537 genes predicted for
R. litoralis, 1122 (24.7%) are not present in the genome of R. denitrificans. Many of the unique genes of R. litoralis
are located in genomic islands and on plasmids. On pRLO149_83 several potential heavy metal resistance genes
are encoded which are not present in the genome of R. denitrificans. The comparison of the heavy metal tolerance
of the two organisms showed an increased zinc tolerance of R. litoralis. In contrast to R. denitrificans, the
photosynthesis genes of R. litoralis are plasmid encoded. The activity of the photosynthetic apparatus was
confirmed by respiration rate measurements, indicating a growth-phase dependent response to light. Comparative
genomics with other members of the Roseobacter clade revealed several genomic regions that were only
conserved in the two Roseobacter species. One of those regions encodes a variety of genes that might play a role
in host association of the organisms. The catabolism of different carbon and nitrogen sources was predicted from
the genome and combined with experimental data. In several cases, e.g. the degradation of some algal osmolytes
and sugars, the genome-derived predictions of the metabolic pathways in R. litoralis differed from the phenotype.
Conclusions: The genomic differences between the two Roseobacter species are mainly due to lateral gene transfer
and genomic rearrangements. Plasmid pRLO149_83 contains predominantly recently acquired genetic material
whereas pRLO149_94 was probably translocated from the chromosome. Plasmid pRLO149_63 and one plasmid of R.
denitrifcans (pTB2) seem to have a common ancestor and are important for cell envelope biosynthesis. Several new
mechanisms of substrate degradation were indicated from the combination of experimental and genomic data. The
photosynthetic activity of R. litoralis is probably regulated by nutrient availability.

Background
The genus Roseobacter comprises the two species Roseobacter litoralis OCh149 and Roseobacter denitrificans
OCh114. Both species were isolated from marine seaweed
and were the first described organisms of the Roseobacter
clade [1]. R. denitrificans is able to grow anaerobically
using nitrate or trimethyl-N-oxide (TMAO) as electron

acceptors [1-3], whereas R. litoralis showed no denitrifying
activity [1]. R. denitrificans and R. litoralis as well as some
other members of the clade have the ability to use light
energy and perform aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis
[1,4]. In R. litoralis, the photosynthesis genes are located
on a plasmid, which is unusual for aerobic anoxygenic
phototrophs (AAnPs) [5].
The genome sequences of more than 40 Roseobacter
clade members are available, but only five of them are
finished [6]. The genome sequence of Roseobacter denitrificans OCh114 was published in 2007 by Swingley

and co-workers [7] and was the first genome of an aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium. The absence of
ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and phosphoribulokinase supports the assumption that AAnPs do not fix
carbon dioxide via the Krebs-Cycle. Genes coding for
other anaplerotic enzymes were found in the genome of
R. denitrificans and the importance of mixotrophic
growth was evident [7].
Plasmid-encoded functions are of great interest in
genome analysis because plasmids often provide
exchangeable niche specific fitness factors. Heavy metal
resistances, e.g., are often encoded by plasmids [8,9] and
are important for marine organisms as heavy metals
accumulate in sediments [10,11], in macroalgae [12-14]
but also in other aquatic organisms [15]. Consequently,
many of the sequenced Roseobacter clade members harbour plasmids, but due to the fact that the majority of
the sequences are not finished, not much is known
about these plasmids. However, it is assumed that translocation processes between chromosomes and plasmids
occur frequently [16].
The aims of our study were the genome characterization, comparative genomics and genome-guided physiological analysis of R. litoralis, the type strain of the
genus Roseobacter. The genome of R. litoralis was compared to the genome of the closely related R. denitrificans as well as to 38 genomes of other members of the
Roseobacter clade. Metabolic pathways were reconstructed and verified by physiological tests. Heavy metal
tolerance tests with both Roseobacter species were performed to confirm differences of the species indicated
by genomic data. Furthermore, insights into the regulation mechanism of the photosynthetic activity of R. litoralis are given.

Results and discussion
General genomic features and comparison of the two
Roseobacter species
The manually curated and annotated final genome
sequence of R. litoralis OCh149 comprises a chromosome with the size of 4,505,211 bp and three plasmids
of 93,578 bp (pRLO149_94), 83,129 bp (pRLO149_83)
and 63,532 bp (pRLO149_63), respectively (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). The genome encodes 4537 predicted
genes. The average G+C content of the genome is
57.23%. According to reciprocal BLAST analysis, the
two Roseobacter species share a core genome consisting
of 3415 genes (75.3% of the genes of R. litoralis). The
chromosomes of the two organisms have been subject
to many genomic rearrangements that are evident in the
chromosomal alignment (Figure 3). Of the 1122 unique
genes (24.7%) of R. litoralis, 226 are located on plasmids. In R. denitrificans, 714 (17.3%) genes are unique
of which 148 are plasmid-encoded. Many of the unique

Page 2 of 16

genes on the chromosomes occur in genomic islands
(GEIs), but a variety of species-specific genes are scattered over the chromosomes. According to Clusters of
Orthologous Groups (COG) -categories, the majority of
these genes are involved in amino acid and carbohydrate
metabolism. The unique genes with assigned function of
R. litoralis and R. denitrificans are listed in Additional
File 1.
Genomic islands

Ten GEIs were identified on the chromosome of R.
litoralis (Figure 1, tagged with Arabic numerals) making
up ~665 kb (14.8%). In R. denitrificans, in contrast, only
~300 kb (7.1%) were identified as genomic islands. The
excess of 365 kb of alien genetic material in R. litoralis
corresponds to the larger chromosome size (~372 kb,
see also Table 1) of the organism. Thus, the additional
genetic material of R. litoralis was most likely acquired
via horizontal gene transfer.
Typically, GEIs contain a G+C content and a Codon
Adaptation Index (CAI) different from the average [17].
Furthermore, transposases within the islands and tRNAs
flanking the GEIs are indicators for translocation processes [17,18]. Many of the genes located in GEIs are of
unknown function and several do not exhibit significant
similarities to other genes in the databases (orphan
genes). These orphan genes are thought to be phagederived genetic material [19]. Although no complete
prophages are present in the genome of R. litoralis, in
some of the islands phage-like genes were identified, e.g.
in island 8 three putative phage tail proteins are located
(RLO149_c037250 - RLO149_c037270).
In other GEIs, however, genes were identified that
were probably derived from other bacterial species. Frequently, amino acid and carbohydrate transport and
metabolism genes are present in the GEIs, providing R.
litoralis with additional abilities for substrate utilization.
For example island 5 contains genes for rhamnose transport and degradation (RLO149_c023060 - RLO149_
c023140) that have been described in Rhizobia [20].
Genes involved in nitrogen metabolism were identified
in islands 1, 6 and 9 including different amidases
(RLO149_c009550, RLO149_c040080, RLO149_c040170,
RLO149_c028370), a second uncommon urease gene
cluster (RLO149_c028310 - RLO149_c028360) and
assimilatory nitrite and nitrate reductases (RLO149_
c039830 - RLO149_c039850). Island 4 contains a carbon
monoxide dehydrogenase encoding gene (CODH,
RLO149_c017450 - RLO149_c017470), which is not present in R. denitrificans. The carbon monoxide dehydrogenase was believed to be common in the Roseobacter
clade, as all members contain the corresponding genes
[21-23]. However, recently it was shown that only a
small proportion of Roseobacter clade members, among

those R. litoralis, are able to oxidise carbon monoxide
and that a wide variety lacks an essential subunit of the
CODH-complex [24]. R. denitrificans is not able to oxidise carbon monoxide, but instead, has genes coding for
a nitrate reductase that enables the organism to reduce
nitrate under anaerobic growth conditions. Island 8
contains genes for coenzyme PQQ biosynthesis
(RLO149_c036920 - RLO149_c036960) that are also
located in a GEI of R. denitrificans. In island 10,
genes for antigen biosynthesis were identified, e.g. UDPN-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase WecB (RLO149_
c044390) and UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose–
oxoglutarate aminotransferase ArnB (RLO149_c044340).
The latter is also similar to the perosamine synthetase
from Brucella melitensis, with GDP-perosamine being
part of the O-antigen of the organism [25]. Antigens are
polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides that define the
structure of the bacterial cell surface. Genes important
for cell envelope biosynthesis are often found in islands
of environmental bacteria [26]. The cell surface structure is important for biofilm formation and host association of the organisms and structural alteration can
provide niche adaption and phage defence [19,26-28].
Unique genes on plasmids

Several species-specific genes, of which the majority is
associated with heavy metal resistance (Table 2), are
located on plasmid pRLO149_83. Therefore, the two
Roseobacter species were compared with respect to zinc
and copper tolerance. R. litoralis showed a higher tolerance of zinc, whereas R. denitrificans showed a higher
copper tolerance. R. litoralis could grow without impairment up to 0.08 mM of zinc, but was inhibited in its
growth in the presence of low copper concentrations
(0.04 mM). In contrast, R. denitrificans could not grow
with 0.02 mM zinc added to the medium, but was able

to grow with 0.1 mM of copper. The higher zinc tolerance of R. litoralis could be due to the Zn-Cpx-type
ATPase and/or the putative cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein CzcD (Table 2), a member of the cation
diffusion efflux (CDF) family [29]. Substrates of CDF
proteins can be various cations [29], but mainly Zn2
+
-transporting CDFs such as ZitB from Escherichia coli
[30] are also known.
Most of the other putative heavy metal resistance
genes on plasmid pRLO149_83 have weak similarities to
known copper and silver efflux proteins (Table 2). But
since no higher copper tolerance of R. litoralis compared to R. denitrificans was observed, the efflux systems might be involved in transport of other cations.
Two other members of the Roseobacter clade, Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL-12 and Roseovarius nubinhibens
ISM, have orthologous heavy metal resistance genes on
their plasmids (Figure 2B).
Plasmids are important mobile genetic elements and
therefore often contain recently acquired genetic material. Thus, the occurrence of species-specific and also
alien genes on two of the plasmids (Figure 2B and 2C)
was not surprising. Plasmid pRLO149_94, however, is an
exception as no alien genes or genomic islands were
identified on the plasmid. Nearly the entire genetic
information of pRLO149_94 was found on the chromosome of R. denitrificans, with approximately 78 kb being
syntenic. Also in R. denitrificans the area was not identified as GEI. Only nine ORFs on the plasmid are not present in the genome of R. denitrificans. The genes for the
photosynthetic apparatus comprise ~45 kb and are part
of the syntenic area with the plasmid replication genes
located amidst the photosynthesis genes in R. litoralis
(Figure 2A). The remaining 33 kb that are syntenic in
both organisms are located upstream of the photosynthesis genes in R. denitrificans and encode other functions.

The genes downstream of the syntenic region to plasmid
pRLO149_94 in R. denitrificans are also present in R.
litoralis and are located approximately 100 kb upstream
of dnaA. At the position on the chromosome of R. litoralis that corresponds to the position of the first gene
associated with the photosynthesis apparatus of R.

denitrificans (idi, RD1_0147) several transposases are
encoded (Figure 1, upstream of island 10), suggesting
this region to be a genomic hot spot. These findings
suggest a translocation of the genetic material from the
chromosome to the plasmid. This is further supported
by the fact that photosynthesis genes are usually located

syntenic regions and white/grey areas the unique regions of the two organisms. The two Roseobacter species share a high amount of genetic
material but the chromosomes have been subject to frequent rearrangements and events of lateral gene transfer. Marked are two HVRs and the
adjacent GEIs of R. litoralis that have corresponding regions on similar positions of the chromosome of R. denitrificans. An X-like structure is
formed when the HVRs are connected by lines. The areas display a mosaic-like structure of syntenic regions interspersed with unique regions in
the respective organism. HVR I of R. litoralis contains a variety of genes that are connected to the association with the algal host of the
bacterium, whereas HVR V contains genes for formaldehyde degradation and sugar metabolism. Both areas have little synteny with other
Roseobacter clade members and are therefore important for the identification of genus-unique genes.

on the chromosomes of AAnPs [5] and are thought to
be rather vertically than horizontally acquired genetic
material in Roseobacter clade bacteria [23].
Comparison with other members of the Roseobacter clade

To identify the genes specific for the genus Roseobacter,
the genomes of both species were compared to 38 genomes of other Roseobacter clade bacteria. The results of
the comparison are shown for two representatives of
each phylogenetic subgroup of the Roseobacter clade
outlined by Newton et al. [22] in Figure 1. Six hypervariable regions (HVR I-VI), areas of low conservation in
the Roseobacter-clade, were found adjacent to the genomic islands predicted on the chromosome of R. litoralis
(Figure 1). The HVRs of R. litoralis are characterized by
a mosaic-like structure, with regions conserved in all
Roseobacter clade bacteria alternating with genus-unique
but also species-unique genes. Frequently, tRNAs were
found flanking the HVRs, but not many transposases
were present inside the areas indicating that the regions
are permanently anchored in the chromosome [31]. The
G+C-content and also the codon-adaptation index vary
inside the HVRs.
Of special interest is HVR I as many genes identified
in this area seem to be connected to the relation of R.
litoralis to the algal host. For example, several genes for
the degradation and transport of algal osmolytes like
taurine (RLO149_c007790 - RLO149_c007880) and

sarcosine (RLO149_c006600 - RLO149_c006630) were
identified in HVR I. Furthermore, the genes for vitamin
B12 biosynthesis (RLO149_c006160 - RLO149_c006260)
are present. Vitamin B12 was shown to be important for
the symbiosis of D. shibae with its dinoflagellate host
[32]. A degradation pathway of erythritol is also located
in HVR I (RLO149_c008260 - RLO149_c008410). The
pathway is only present in R. litoralis and R. denitrificans and is known from Rhizobia [33,34]. In Rhizobium
leguminosarum erythritol catabolism is important for
competitiveness of the organism in the nodulation of
pea plants [34]. Thus, erythritol catabolism might also
be associated with the algal host relation of the Roseobacter species. The mosaic-like structure of HVR I
resembles the symbiosis islands of Rhizobia [18,35].
Two different areas can be identified on the chromosome of R. denitrificans that correspond to HVR I of
R. litoralis. In the alignment of the chromosomes of
the two species, the HVRs of the two organisms form
an X-like structure (Figure 3) which is probably due to
the tendency of genes in closely related organisms to be
located in the same distance from the origin [36].
Uncharacterized sugar and amino acid transporters
are frequently found in the HVRs, e.g. in HVRs
II and V. Genes for glucoside (RLO149_c021710
RLO149_c021770)
and
galactose/arabinose
(RLO149_c021930 - RLO149_c021980) transport and
degradation as well as an arsenite resistance system

(RLO149_c022030 - RLO149_c022040) are located
in HVR III. The genes for sulfur oxidation
(RLO149_c031760 - RLO149_c031920) and the denitrification genes (RLO149_c031300 - RLO149_c031570)
were identified in HVR IV. Due to the lack of the nitrate
reductase in R. litoralis the organism is not able to
reduce nitrate; however, genes encoding all other
enzymes required for denitrification are present. Thus, it
is possible that the organism is able to reduce nitrite to
molecular nitrogen under anoxic conditions. HVR V
contains genes for formaldehyde degradation that are
more common in the mixotrophic than in the heterotrophic group of Roseobacter clade members [22].

20 of the 24 organisms supports the hypothesis that
plasmid-location of the rfb-genes is coherent with hostassociation of Roseobacter clade bacteria.
Photosynthesis

To confirm the functionality of the plasmid-encoded
photosynthesis apparatus in R. litoralis, the photosynthetic activity of the strain was measured via oxygen
consumption (Figure 4). Whereas almost no reaction to
light was observed during growth, cells in the stationary

rfb-genes and host association

A rfb-gene cluster essential for the development of Oantigens, i.e. lipopolysaccharides of the outer membranes
of Gram-negative bacteria [37], was identified on plasmid
pRLO149_63 of R. litoralis. Many of the Roseobacter
clade bacteria have rfb-genes in their genomes and in
about half of those the genes are located on plasmids. In
R. denitrificans the rfb-gene cluster is encoded on a plasmid of 69 kb (pTB2), a size similar to pRLO149_63.
Approximately 50% of the genes on pTB2 and
pRLO149_63 are orthologs (Figure 2C). The remaining
parts contain unique genes for each organism, and many
of these are associated with cell envelope biosynthesis.
These findings suggest that the plasmids are important
for the cell surface structure of the two Roseobacter species and may have originated from a common ancestor.
In E. coli the O-antigens are known to interact with
the host defences and are therefore important virulence
factors of pathogenic bacteria [37]. Many other Roseobacter clade bacteria with plasmid-located rfb-genes
were also isolated from surfaces of algal or animal hosts.
Therefore, we investigated whether a correlation
between the replicon location of the rfb-genes and hostassociation exists. The genome sequences of marine
Rhodobacterales species available in the IMG database
[38,39] were searched for rfb-genes and the replicon
location was determined if possible (see Additional File
2). For the unfinished genomes, co-occurrence of plasmid replication genes with the rfb-genes on the same
DNA-contig was regarded as an indicator for plasmid
localisation. Chromosome location was confirmed by
rRNA clusters or chromosome partitioning genes on the
DNA-contigs that harbour the rfb-genes. In 24 of the 39
genomes rfb-genes were present and their location
could be identified. Chromosomal rfb-genes were found
in 12 organisms and 11 of those were isolated from the
water column. Nine of the 12 plasmid-located rfb-gene
clusters were found in organisms that were isolated
either from host surfaces, aquacultures, algae blooms or
the like. Thus, the replicon analysis of the rfb-genes of

Figure 4 Respiration rates of R. litoralis cells. A: exponential
growth phase; B: stationary growth phase. The values in mV
min-1 indicate the respiration rates in the respective time intervals.
Cells were kept anoxic under nitrogen gas until oxygen was
supplied. At the beginning of each respiration measurement the cell
suspension was saturated with oxygen and the oxygen
consumption of the cells was measured in mV min-1. The response
of R. litoralis to light differs remarkably between the two growth
phases. During the exponential growth phase the initial respiration
rate in the dark was higher (220 mV min-1) than in the stationary
growth phase (140 mV min-1). When exposed to light, the cells that
were in the exponential growth phase showed only a slight
decrease to 200 mV min-1 (10%) of the respiration rate whereas in
the stationary phase culture the respiration rate was reduced to
43% (60 mV min-1) of the original rate in the first light period and
to 25% (30 mV min-1) in the second. Cells resumed 95%
(exponential growth phase) and 86% (stationary growth phase) of
their original respiration rate when darkened again.

growth phase were highly responsive to light and
showed a reduced respiration rate when exposed to light
(Figure 4). Even though pigmentation occurred already
during the exponential growth phase, the organism did
not use the photosynthetic apparatus until the culture
reached the stationary growth phase. The use, but not
the expression, of the photosynthesis apparatus might
therefore be influenced by nutrient availability in R.
litoralis, as stationary phase cultures are nutrient
depleted. We obtained similar results for R. denitrificans, with cells in the late stationary phase showing a
stronger response to light than cells from the exponential growth phase (data not shown). For the alpha-Proteobacteria Labrenzia alexandrii DFl-11 and Hoeflea
phototrophica DFL-43 periodic nutrient starvation has
been reported to trigger bacteriochlorophyll-a production whereas only slight effects were observed for D. shibae [40]. Obviously, the regulation mechanisms differ
between the aerobic phototrophic bacteria and so does
the architecture of their photosynthesis genes. In Additional File 3, the organization of the photosynthesis gene
clusters of the organisms mentioned above is compared,
showing that organisms with similar physiological traits
also have similar gene organizations. The suggestion
that the organization of genes within purple bacterial
photosynthesis gene clusters reflects regulatory mechanisms, evolutionary history, and relationships between
species was also made by other authors [7,41,42]. In the
oligotrophic environment of the ocean, the use of the
photosynthesis apparatus during nutrient depletion may
be an important advantage for Roseobacter species in
the competition with non-photosynthetic organisms.
Substrate tests and pathway reconstruction

Growth on different substrates was tested for R. litoralis
to substantiate the reconstruction of metabolic pathways
based on the genomic analyses. The results of the growth
experiments are shown in Additional File 4. For each
substrate the growth characteristics of R. litoralis and the
genomic data were combined and the putative degradation pathways for the substrates allowing growth are
shown in Figures 5 and 6. For the use of amino acids and
amino acid derivatives, the predictions from the genome
are mainly consistent with the experimentally achieved
data (Additional File 4). However, for the degradation of
sugars, sugar derivatives and algal osmolytes, genomic
and experimental data differ in several cases (Additional
File 4). Selected examples are discussed below.
D-mannose and D-glucosamine

For D-mannose and D-glucosamine the process of phosphorylation could not be revealed from the genomic data
(Figure 5). In other bacteria, a phosphotransferase system
(PTS) mediates phosphorylation of monosaccharides

Page 8 of 16

already during transport (for reviews see [43,44]). As for
the majority of the Roseobacter clade members, no complete PTS is encoded in the genome of R. litoralis. Present
are genes for an EIIA component, Hpr and HprK, but no
permease was identified. The function of the incomplete
PTS is to date unknown. It rather exhibits a regulatory
function as proposed for the spirochaetes Treponema pallidum and Treponema denticola [45] and as shown for
Sinorhizobium meliloti [46], which also lack the permease
component of the PTS. Therefore, a PTS-independent system for transport and phosphorylation of D-mannose and
D-glucosamine must be present in R. litoralis.
D-galactose, L-arabinose and D-fucose

R. litoralis grew with D-galactose, L-arabinose and Dfucose, but no complete pathways could be assigned to
the degradation of these monosaccharides. A known
mechanism for D-galactose degradation in bacteria is the
DeLey-Doudoroff pathway (DD-pathway, [47]). Parts of
the DD-pathway are encoded in the genome of R. litoralis,
namely the genes coding for 2-dehydro-3-deoxygalactokinase (DgoK, RLO149_c015740) and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6phosphogalactonate aldolase (DgoA, RLO149_c015730).
The other genes required for the degradation of D-galactose via the DD-pathway are not present in this gene
cluster (cluster 1, see Table 3). However, a gene with
high similarity to galactose 1-dehydrogenase (Gal,
RLO149_c021980) that catalyzes the first step of the pathway [47] was found elsewhere in the genome (cluster 2,
see Table 3). This protein has also a high similarity to Larabinose 1-dehydrogenase of Azospirillum brasilense. In
this organism a pathway for L-arabinose degradation was
described that is analogue to the DD-pathway for galactose
degradation [48-50]. Beside L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase,
also arabonate dehydratase of A. brasilense has an ortholog
in R. litoralis (RLO149_c021970) which is also located in
cluster 2 (Table 3). The other proteins of the pathway
known in A. brasilense cannot be assigned to proteins of
R. litoralis. Thus, both pathways are incomplete in R. litoralis; however, if the two clusters are combined, a degradation mechanism based on the DD-pathway may be
functional for both sugars (Figure 5). Correspondingly, the
regulators as well as the sugar-binding periplasmic protein
of the transport system in cluster 2 are known to interact
with D-galactose, L-arabinose and D-fucose [51-54], and
also other enzymes are known to act on all three sugars
[55,56]. As no mechanism for D-fucose degradation was
identified in the genome of R. litoralis and only weak
growth was observed with this sugar, it is possible that the
enzymes also act on D-fucose but with a lower affinity.
Glycogen

R. litoralis was not able to grow with glycogen as a carbon source, probably due to the fact that no genes exist

names as well as the EC numbers in black. If available, the corresponding gene names of the enzymes are given. Question marks indicate that

in the predicted secretome coding for extracellular glycogen cleavage enzymes, and also no putative transporters
for glycogen were identified. Intracellular glycogen, however, was detected in cells of both Roseobacter species
when grown in mineral medium. In contrast, no glycogen
formation was observed when the cells were grown in
complex medium. The glycogen biosynthesis and degradation genes in the two organisms are therefore probably
involved in intracellular glycogen production under limiting conditions. The proposed pathway for glycogen metabolism in R. litoralis is shown in Figure 5.
Glycogen formation is often induced by nitrogen starvation [57-59]; however, both Roseobacter species were
not nitrogen-starved. Thus, another limiting factor must
be the inducer of glycogen production in the mineral
medium.
In contrast to the other Roseobacter clade members, in
both Roseobacter species the genes for glycogen biosynthesis and degradation are co-located with essential
genes of the ED-pathway. It is known from other studies

that Roseobacter clade members use the ED-pathway for
sugar breakdown [60,61]. The co-location of the genes
coding for the ED-pathway with those of the glycogen
biosynthesis and degradation indicates a close relation
of the central carbon metabolism and glycogen storage
in the Roseobacter species.
Algal osmolytes

The algal osmolytes tested in this study all served as
carbon and nitrogen sources for both Roseobacter species, except for dimethylglycine. Additionally, R. litoralis
used taurine as sulfur source. It was possible to reconstruct the pathways for algal osmolyte degradation from
the genome of R. litoralis with the three exceptions
creatinine, glycine betaine and putrescine (Figure 6,
Additional File 4).
Creatinine

Whereas the degradation mechanism for creatinine is
clear in R. denitrificans, in R. litoralis the enzyme

substrates that were used by R. litoralis as carbon sources in the experiments are framed. Metabolites are shown in red, enzyme and gene
names as well as the EC numbers in black. If available, the corresponding gene names of the enzymes are given. Question marks indicate that
no genes for the respective reaction were predicted from the genome of R. litoralis. If question marks are combined with enzyme names, the

encoding the initial step of the pathway is not encoded
in the genome (Figure 6). Nevertheless, no differences
were observed between the two organisms when grown
on creatinine. Furthermore, the enzymes mediating the
second step of both possible pathways for creatinine
degradation are present in the genome of R. litoralis
(Figure 6). Thus, the organism is able to degrade creatinine, but the mechanism cannot be completely reconstructed from the genome.
Glycine betaine

The gene coding for the enzyme converting glycine
betaine to dimethylglycine (betaine-homocysteine Smethyltransferase, BHMT) was not identified in the genomes of the two Roseobacter species. However, a potential candidate gene is RLO149_c039100 which is colocated with the genes for dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH4, RLO149_c039110) and a sarcosine
dehydrogenase (SARDH, RLO149_c039090) that are
both directly involved in osmolyte degradation (Figure
6) and are annotated according to eukaryotic enzymes.
The domain homocysteine S-methyltransferase (InterPro
database [62], entry IPR003726) that was identified in

the protein sequence of RLO149_c039100 is known to be
part of mammalian BHMTs [63], but the predicted protein
of R. litoralis shares only 26% identical amino acids with
the mammalian enzymes (E-value 6e-09). A similar ORF
(RD1_0018, 96% identity to RLO149_c039100) is encoded
in the genome of R. denitrificans that is located in the
same genomic neighbourhood as RLO149_c039100.
Only eight bacterial enzymes annotated as BHMT are
present in the UniProt database [64]. An enzyme of S.
meliloti has been described to mediate this step in glycine betaine degradation [65], but the protein sequence
of RLO149_c039100 shows only weak similarity to this
protein. The genomic location, the functional domain
and the fact that both Roseobacter strains are able to
grow with glycine betaine as carbon and nitrogen
sources point to RLO149_c039100 and RD1_0018 being
involved in the degradation of glycine betaine in Roseobacters, representing a new class of bacterial BHMTs.
Dimethylglycine

Even though several genes coding for dimethylglycine
dehydrogenases (DMGDH) were identified in the genomes of both Roseobacter species, the strains were

neither able to utilize dimethylglycine (DMG) as carbon
nor as nitrogen source. It is possible that the DMGDHs
are only mediating the degradation of intracellular
DMG derived from the cleavage of glycine betaine.
Putrescine

The degradation of the osmolyte putrescine is likely to
occur via 4-aminobutyrate, as some of the genes of the
pathway are present (Figure 6). However, the enzymes
mediating step three and four of the pathway were not
predicted in the genome of R. litoralis and also the aminotransferase responsible for the last step of the pathway,
i.e. the degradation of 4-aminobutyrate to succinatesemialdehyde, was also not identified. Steps three and
four might be mediated by RLO149_c025400 (putative
gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate hydrolase) and
RLO149_c025390 (putative D-beta-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase). The last step of the pathway might be
carried out by one of the uncharacterized aldehyde aminotransferases encoded in the genome of R. litoralis.
Taurine

Two different pathways are postulated for the transport
and degradation of taurine by microorganisms [66].

Page 11 of 16

Apparently both pathways with different transport systems are present in R. litoralis. A taurine TRAP transport system in combination with a taurine
dehydrogenase (TDH) also occurs in R. denitrificans, D.
shibae, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Paracoccus denitrificans, whereas a taurine ABC transporter and a taurine:
pyruvate aminotransferase (Tpa) are present in most of
the other genome sequenced Roseobacter clade members. Only D. shibae, R. denitrificans and R. litoralis
have both uptake and degradation systems. Common
features of these three organisms are their photosynthetic activity and the association with algal hosts
[1,4,32,67,68]. The common feature of all taurine TRAP
transporter-containing organisms is their ability to grow
anaerobically [2,3,69-71]. The exception is R. litoralis,
for which no anaerobic growth was reported yet. Nevertheless, the ability to grow anaerobically is indicated by
the presence of genes for nitrite reduction (see above)
and for dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/TMAO reductases
(RLO149_c007970, RLO149_c001820-RLO149_c001840).
Anoxic conditions can occur during the collapse of algal
blooms [72] which might also be the situation when
high amounts of taurine and other algal osmolytes
become available.

Conclusions
Our results show that the differences between the two
Roseobacter species and the larger chromosome of R. litoralis are mainly due to events of horizontal gene transfer.
Furthermore, the genomes have been subject to numerous
genomic rearrangements. Plasmid pRLO149_94 of R. litoralis, on which the photosynthesis genes are encoded, was
most likely translocated from the chromosome as it can
almost completely be found on the chromosome of R.
denitrificans. The photosynthetic activity of R. litoralis was
shown to be growth-phase dependent. Whereas almost no
reaction to light was observed during exponential growth,
the organism was highly responsive to light during stationary growth phase. These results suggest a regulation of the
photosynthetic activity according to nutrient availability
that might also be reflected in the genetic organization of
the photosynthesis genes. A plasmid with partial synteny
to pRLO149_63 is present in R. denitrificans indicating a
common ancestor of the two plasmids. Both plasmids and
11 other plasmids of Roseobacter clade bacteria harbour
rfb-genes. The majority of these organisms were isolated
from animal or algal hosts suggesting a coherence of plasmid location and host association. New mechanisms for
sugar and algal osmolyte degradation were indicated. The
ability to store intracellular glycogen as well as the utilization of algal osmolytes was reported for the first time for
Roseobacter clade bacteria. Several pathways could not be
fully elucidated, indicating R. litoralis to employ alternative
enzymes compared to the known reference organisms.

Methods
Genome sequencing and finishing

The strains R. litoralis OCh149 and R. denitrificans
OCh114 were obtained from the German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig Germany). The genome sequencing of R. litoralis
was carried out at the J. Craig Venter Institute (Rockville, MD, USA) within the Microbial Genome Sequencing Project by a Sanger sequencing-based approach.
For details see the Microbial Genome Sequencing Project [73]. The Sanger-based sequencing resulted in 7.97
coverage of the genome sequence. Gap closure and all
manual editing steps were carried out at the Göttingen
Genomics Laboratory (University of Göttingen, Germany) using the Gap4 (v 4.11) software of the Staden
package [74]. Remaining gaps in the sequences were
closed by primer walking on PCR products. Sequences
were obtained using the Big Dye 3.0 chemistry (Applied
Biosystems), customized sequencing primers and
ABI3730XL capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems).
Gene prediction and annotation

The prediction of coding sequences (CDS) or open
reading frames (ORFs) was done with YACOP [75]. The
results were verified and improved manually by using
criteria such as the presence of a ribosome-binding site,
GC frame plot analysis, and similarity to known proteinencoding sequences using the Sanger Artemis tool [76].
Functional annotation of all ORFs was carried out with
the ERGO software package [77] (Integrated Genomics,
Chicago, IL, USA). The protein sequences of the predicted ORFs were compared to the Swiss-Prot and
TrEMBL databases [78]. Functional domains, repeats
and important sites were analysed with the integrated
database InterPro using the Web-based tool InterProScan [79].
Comparative genomics

The genomes of 38 Roseobacter clade members used for
the comparison are the same as those used for the analysis of the rfb-genes and are listed in Additional File 2.
Additionally, Roseobacter R2A57 and Loktanella sp.
SE62 were included in the comparison. For comparative
analysis, the BiBag software tool for reciprocal BLAST
analyses as well as a global sequence alignment using
the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (pers. comm. Antje
Wollherr and Heiko Liesegang, G2L Göttingen) was
used. ORFs were considered as orthologs at a Needleman-Wunsch similarity-score of at least thirty percent
and an E-value < 10e-21. Circular plots of DNA
sequences were generated with the program DNAPlotter
[80]. The comparative visualisation of the genetic organization of the photosynthesis genes of different organisms was realized with the GenVision software

Page 12 of 16

(DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Whole genome
alignments were performed and visualized with the
Mauve Software Tool [81].
Sequence analysis

The programs IslandViewer [82] and COLOMBO [83]
were used for the detection of alien genes and genomic
islands in the genomes of R. litoralis and R. denitrificans. To complete the computational prediction, the
predicted regions were manually checked for elements
commonly associated with GEIs like transposases, integrases, insertion sequence (IS)-elements, tRNAs and
GC-content deviations [84]. For the prediction of the
secretome of R. litoralis, PrediSi [85] was used.
The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) measures the
synonymous codon usage bias for a given DNA
sequence by comparing the similarity between the
synonymous codon usage of a gene and the synonymous
codon frequency of a reference set. For the calculation
of the CAI values the CAIcal server was used [86]. For
the functional categorization of gene products, a BLAST
search with all coding sequences was performed against
the COG database [87].
The metabolic pathways were reconstructed with the
Pathway Tools Software [88,89] from the BioCyc Database collection [90]. The pathways were manually
curated if necessary.
Measurement of photosynthetic activity

R. litoralis was cultured in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks
containing 200 mL of modified PPES-II medium [1] (see
Additional File 5). Cells were grown at 25°C on a rotary
shaker at 120 rpm with a natural day-night-rhythm.
After 40 hours of incubation (within the exponential
growth phase) and 95 hours (stationary growth phase),
respectively, the cultures were harvested by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10°C, 15 minutes) and washed once
with 100 mL of a salt solution containing 20 g/L NaCl,
13 g/L MgCl 2 × 6 H 2 O and 11.18 g/L KCl. After an
additional centrifugation step, the cell pellets were
resuspended in 5 mL of the salt solution and the OD600
was adjusted to 10. Respiration of the cells was measured via oxygen consumption [4].
Heavy metal resistance tests

The heavy metal resistance tests were carried out on
agar plates based on a modified medium described by
Shioi [91] (see Additional File 5). Heavy metal stock
solutions were prepared as aqueous solutions of 50 mM
CuCl2 × 2 H2O and O4SZn × 7 H2O, respectively, and
sterile filtrated. The stock solutions were added to the
autoclaved medium directly before pouring the plates.
Each agar plate contained 20 mL of medium and 0.02,
0.04, 0.06, 0.08 or 0.1 mM of one of the heavy metals.

Kalhoefer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:324
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/324

Tests were prepared in duplicates. Agar plates containing no heavy metals served as controls.
The pre-cultures were grown as follows: single colonies of the strains were transferred from agar plates to
20 mL of modified 70% Marine Broth medium (MB,
Difco 2216, see Additional File 5) in 100 mL Erlenmeyer
flasks. Cells were grown at 22°C on a rotary shaker (80
rpm) with a natural day-night-rhythm to an optical density (600 nm) between 0.3 and 0.4. The cell suspensions
were diluted 10-4 fold and 800 μL of the dilution were
plated on each agar plate containing zinc or copper.
Substrate tests

Substrate tests were performed with R. litoralis to compare the experimental data with the genomic information. As genome comparisons of the two Roseobacter
species revealed some putative differences, growth on
algal osmolytes was tested for both organisms. All substrates tested as carbon, nitrogen or sulfur sources are
listed in Additional File 4. Cells of R. litoralis and R.
denitrificans were grown in sterile 22.5 mL metalcapped test tubes containing 5 mL of modified Marine
Basal Mineral (MBM) medium [92] (see Additional File
5). Tests for taurine as sulfur source were carried out in
modified MBM medium prepared without sulfate but
with 100 μM taurine. For the substrates that were tested
as nitrogen sources, Tris-HCl in the modified MBM
medium was replaced by 0.19 g/L NaHCO 3 and no
NH4Cl was added. The pH of the medium was adjusted
to 7.5 after autoclaving with sterile 100 mM HCl. Aqueous stock solutions of the substrates were prepared,
sterile filtrated and stored at -20°C or at 4°C. Final concentrations for sugars, sugar derivatives, ethanol, glycogen and urea were 1 mg/mL, 2 mM for amino acids and
amino acid derivatives, 10 mM for the algal osmolytes
and 1 mL/L for glycerol. When the substrates served as
nitrogen sources, the final nitrogen concentration was
adjusted to 2.5 mM. All tests were carried out in parallels, one additional parallel was not inoculated and
served as a control. For all substrates that were tested as
carbon sources for R. litoralis, two additional parallels
were supplemented with 1% of complex medium (modified 70% MB, see Additional File 5) to investigate
whether an additional cofactor was needed by the strain.
The requirement for supplements to the mineral medium was also described for other Roseobacter clade bacteria [93,94]. The cultures were inoculated (1% v/v) with
cells grown in liquid complex medium.
For the tests of nitrogen and sulfur sources, mannitol
was used as carbon source for R. litoralis and glycerol
for R. denitrificans, as growth of the organisms with
these substrates yielded similar optical densities and no
addition of complex medium was necessary to support
growth. As inoculum for the nitrogen tests 200 μL (4%

Page 13 of 16

v/v) of N-starved stationary phase cultures were used.
All algal osmolytes that R. litoralis could use as carbon
and nitrogen sources in separated experiments were
additionally tested combined as carbon and nitrogen
source within one experiment with a final concentration
of 10 mM. In all tests, inoculated parallels that contained no carbon, nitrogen or sulfur source, respectively,
served as negative controls. Growth was considered as
positive if the optical density was higher than in the
respective negative controls. All cultures were incubated
at room temperature with a natural day-night-rhythm.
At suitable time intervals the optical density at 600 nm
(OD 600 ) was measured with a spectrophotometer
(Bausch & Lomb). After reaching the stationary phase,
cells were transferred into fresh medium containing the
respective substrate to confirm growth. When taurine
served as sulfur source, the cells were transferred twice
to fresh medium because the sulfur-free cultures were
not growth limited compared to the parallels with taurine in the first two passages. After reaching the stationary phase in the second growth passage, purity of each
culture was tested on an agar plate.
Intracellular glycogen

R. litoralis and R. denitrificans were tested for intracellular production of glycogen when grown in complex
medium (modified 70% MB, see Additional File 5) and
in mineral medium using the method described by
Bourassa and Camilli [57]. As mineral medium, modified MBM with NaHCO3 as buffer, 5 mM ammonium
and 1 mg/mL mannitol as carbon source (1 mL/L glycerol for R. denitrificans) was used. After growth the
cells were pelleted, washed once with 1 × PBS (phosphate buffered saline) buffer and stored frozen until
further processing.
Nucleotide sequence accession number

The complete genome sequence of Roseobacter litoralis
OCh149 was deposited in GenBank under the accession
numbers [GenBank:CP002623]-[GenBank:CP002626].

DFL-43 and L. alexandrii DFL-11 are based on the draft genome
sequences. The gene organization of R. litoralis and R. denitrificans is
identical, as is the case for H. phototrophica and L. alexandrii. The gene

organization of D. shibae differs from the other two types. The two
Roseobacter species show a similar, growth phase dependent response to
light. H. phototrophica and L. alexandrii are not closely related but have a
similar regulation of bacteriochlorophyll-a production, whereas the
regulation mechanism of D. shibae is different [4]. Therefore, the gene
organization and the location of the regulators may be important for the
global regulation of the photosynthetic activity in aerobic anoxygenic
phototrophic bacteria.

predictions of substrate utilization from the genome. In bold are the

equal or less than negative control; +, OD600 < 0.2; ++, OD600 0.2 - 0.5;
+++, OD600 > 0.5; w, negative control < OD600 < 0.2. Results are shown
for the second growth passage unless otherwise indicated. All amino
acids had L-conformation, all sugars had D-conformation unless
otherwise indicated. Growth on almost all sugars and sugar derivatives
was considerably enhanced by the addition of 1% complex medium to
the mineral medium. Glucose was not utilized without this
supplementation. Addition of complex medium did not enhance the
growth of R. litoralis on most amino acids. Exceptions were glutamate
and the amino sulfonic acid taurine which were not utilized without
supplementation.
