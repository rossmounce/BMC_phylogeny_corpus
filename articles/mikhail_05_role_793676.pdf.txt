Abstract
Background: The actual relationship between viral variability and HIV disease progression and/or
non-progression can only be extrapolated through epidemiologically-linked HIV-infected cohorts.
The rarity of such cohorts accents their existence as invaluable human models for a clear
understanding of molecular factors that may contribute to the various rates of HIV disease. We
present here a cohort of three patients with the source termed donor A – a non-progressor and
two recipients called B and C. Both recipients gradually progressed to HIV disease and patient C
has died of AIDS recently. By conducting 15 near full-length genome (8.7 kb) analysis from
longitudinally derived patient PBMC samples enabled us to investigate the extent of molecular
factors, which govern HIV disease progression.
Results: Four time points were successfully amplified for patient A, 4 for patient B and 7 from
patient C. Using phylogenetic analysis our data confirms the epidemiological-linkage and
transmission of HIV-1 from a non-progressor to two recipients. Following transmission the two
recipients gradually progressed to AIDS and one died of AIDS. Viral divergence, selective
pressures, recombination, and evolutionary rates of HIV-1 in each member of the cohort were
investigated over time. Genetic recombination and selective pressure was evident in the entire
cohort. However, there was a striking correlation between evolutionary rate and disease
progression.
Conclusion: Non-progressing individuals have the potential to transmit pathogenic variants, which
in other host can lead to faster HIV disease progression. This was evident from our study and the
accelerated disease progression in the recipient members of he cohort correlated with faster
evolutionary rate of HIV-1, which is a unique aspect of this study.

Background
The rate of HIV disease progression varies greatly among
infected individuals, which is defined invariably by
increasing plasma viral loads and concomitant decline in
the CD4+ T cell counts. A small but rare subset of chronically-infected individuals comprising <0.8% of total HIV
infected population appear to maintain high and stable
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, low to undetectable plasma
viral loads for >10 years in the absence of antiretroviral
therapy [1,2]. In addition, some of these non-progressing
individuals harbor <10 copies of proviral DNA/ml blood,
show strong immune responses [2,3] and a high secretion
of CD8 antiviral factor(s) (CAF) [3,4]. Additionally, in
rare cases there is a complete absence of viral evolution
over time [5].
HIV disease is a complex interplay of both host and viral
factors [6-10], but it has been difficult to derive a consensus on these factor(s) that contribute to disease progression and / or non-progression. In many cases, evidence
suggests that viral gene defects contribute to non-progression of HIV disease [6,11-14], yet these molecular changes
remain elusive due to the extensive inter-strain variation
of HIV-1, which can be investigated using epidemiologically-linked cohorts. The rarity of such cohorts accents
their existence as invaluable models for understanding
how various host and viral factors govern HIV pathogenesis. For such purposes, we describe detailed molecular
analyses of one such cohort comprising of 3 HIV-infected
individuals (a non-progressing donor-A and two recipients B and C) whose epidemiological linkage was confirmed through phylogenetic analyses [15]. The donor A
likely acquired HIV in 1982, and has remained healthy
maintaining non-progressive status with high CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell counts and with <7000 HIV-1 copies/ml of
plasma. The two recipients were infected in autumn 1983
(recipient B) and in summer of 1983 (recipient C)
respectively.
With the help of detailed full-length HIV-1 genome analysis over time from all cohort members, we investigated
viral evolution, divergence, recombination and selective
forces in contributing to HIV disease development in the
two recipients as opposed to the non-progressive donor.

Results
Sequencing of near full-length genomes
Successful amplification of near full-length HIV-1
genomes was achieved from a total of 15 PBMC patient
samples collected between 1992 to 2000 from all 3 cohort
members A, B and C. Epidemiological-linkage was confirmed by maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis
which was subsequently used for further intra patient evolutionary analysis as discussed previously in Mikhail et al.,
2005 [15].

Phylogenetic clustering of cohort members: evidence of
HIV transmission via blood transfusion
Within the HIV-1 subtype B phylogenetic tree, the cohort
clearly constitutes a single cluster, supported by high
bootstrap values as posterior probabilities. Interestingly,
the donor A lineage appears to be the out group for the
two recipients and it was noted that recipient C revealed
one long-branch segregating earlier time points from samples obtained from 1997 till 2000 [15]. As this is in correlation to clinical patient profile, one can deduce that the
emergence of host-induced viral variation and hence viral
evolution at recent time points occurred in concert with
the rapidly progressing status of AIDS patient C. This pattern was also evident through analyses obtained from all
the individual genes (data not shown).

Overall, patient-derived virus sequences obtained from
corresponding longitudinal samples showed tight clustering within patients, well supported by bootstrap values
and posterior probabilities. To analyze within patient evolutionary patterns, a splitstree, allowing the representation of conflicting phylogenetic signal, was reconstructed
for all the cohort sequences (Figure 2). In the splitstree the
evolutionary patterns within each patient are blurred by
discordant relationships indicated by the reticulate pattern of evolution. This pattern of phylogenetic discordance suggests the presence of recombination and/or
adaptive evolution, which is acting as a major evolutionary force on the patient's viral variants over time in vivo.
Recombination produces networks of sequences rather
than strictly bifurcating evolutionary trees. Depicted by
the Splitstree program, a tree topology typical of recombination or conflicting phylogenetic signals in the data contains parallel edges between sequences.
Recombination analysis
To further delineate the cause of net like pattern seen at
the nodes of the splits tree and to determine whether
recombination has shaped the evolution of viral
sequences, the Informative Sites Tests (IST) together with
the Homoplasy test was conducted to test whether the
null hypothesis of pure clonal evolution can be significantly rejected [16,17]. In addition, we also attempted to
quantify the contribution of recombination to the viral
genetic diversity using the Informative Site Index and the
Homoplasy Ratio (HR) (Table 1). For the complete
genomes, both indices are in the same order of magnitude
of 0.3 indicating the presence of recombination. However, for the major genes, the P values still indicate the
hallmark of recombination, but the recombination indices become slightly varied and are no longer comparable
between the two tests. If this recombination signal is also
the cause of reticulate evolution within each patient, then
recombination was equally evident in both the donor and
recipients (Figure 2). Therefore, even though

recombination appears to be an inherent property in this
cluster, its exact biological association with progression
and non-progression of HIV disease in this cohort is only
partially clear, and the possible role of selection pressures
on disease progression is needed to be investigated.
Selective pressure and evolutionary rate analysis
To investigate the selective pressure exerted on the virus in
the cohort members, a non-synonymous/synonymous
substitution rate ratio scan was performed on the complete genomes using a maximum likelihood estimation
procedure (Figure 3). The average dN/dS ratio shows considerable variation across the genome, with the highest
ratios in the env gene, intermediate values in the accessory
genes and lower values in the pol gene, with fairly low values for the gag gene. A similar analysis using complete
genomes, representative for the HIV-1 diversity group M
found from the Los Alamos HIV Database, also resulted in
a similar plot, confirming previous reported results
[9,17,18]. With the methods at hand, we can quantify the
selective pressure across the genome for the complete
cohort but it is not possible to document differences in
selective pressure between cohort members due to parameter constraints of the mathematical models used. Thus,
although over time analyses do demonstrate that differential selective pressure is clearly present in this cohort, its
clear relationship with disease progression cannot be
unraveled due to the possible contributing role of recombination. And since selection can result in heterogeneous
rates along sequences, conflicting phylogenetic signal in
this cohort might also have arisen from selection in addition to recombination. This is further confirmed by the
correlation of the log likelihood estimates of the overall
phylogenetic hypothesis plotted against the dN/dS ratios
obtained by the scanning window approach (data not
shown).

To investigate differences in evolutionary rate between
patients, molecular clock analysis was performed. Figure 4

ear regression analysis and also consistent with his recent
death with AIDS. Thus, from these analyses we have
strong evidence showing a considerable influence of viral
evolutionary rate on HIV disease progression.

Discussion
In this study we have carried-out detailed analyses of
molecular factors that might contribute to HIV disease
progression in an epidemiologically-linked cohort in
which a HIV-infected non-progressor transmitted virus to
recipients who gradually progressed to AIDS. With the
help of 15 full-length HIV-1 genomes derived from the
cohort members, where time and source of infection were
known, we are able to show how various genetic changes
following transmission of HIV from a non-progressor
(donor A) accompanied disease progression in two recipients (B and C). Previously, Sydney Blood Bank Cohort
(SBBC) also identified a similar transmission of HIV-1
from a non-progressor to 5 other recipients, but in this
case patients did not progress as they were all infected
with a nef-deleted HIV-1 strain [19]. We have investigated
host-induced viral divergence, selection pressure, recombination and viral evolutionary rates of HIV-1 strains in
this cohort.

slope and thus evolutionary rate for recipient B, followed by
recipient C and lowest evolutionary rate for non-progressing
donor A.

A, B and C, respectively (Figure 4). By incorporating a global molecular clock, constraining all branches with one
single evolutionary rate, and local molecular clocks,
accommodating for different rates among different
branch sets, evolutionary rates were obtained by maximum likelihood under the tip-dated model. Table 2
shows that allowing for different rates among the patients
provided a significantly better fit (P < 0.001) than the global clock model, illustrating that the evolutionary rates
were significantly different for the three cohort members.
It should be noted however that the non-clock model,
allowing for a different rate for each branch in the phylogeny, still remained significantly better as determined by
the likelihood ratio test. Estimates of the evolutionary rate
show a slow evolution for patient A and much higher rates
in the two progressors (B and C), with the highest virus
evolutionary rate in recipient B in agreement with the lin-

It is apparent that following transmission of HIV-1 from
the donor A, the 2 recipients B and C gradually deteriorated over a 15-year period to low CD4+/CD8+ T cell
counts and high viral loads despite the continuation of
HAART since 1997. These data suggest a possible role of in
vivo viral divergence and host selection pressure over time,
in the transition of a virus associated with non-progression in the donor, to a virus associated with gradual
progression of HIV in the 2 recipients B and C of the
cohort. To investigate this, the contribution of recombination to the genetic diversity and consequently disease progression evident in these cohort members was assessed
using IST and the Homoplasy test. As our cohort is epidemiologically-linked, classical techniques such as Simplot,
which uses a scanning window approach to detect conflicting topologies, are unreliable. Our methods capture
conflicting phylogeny signal at the third codon positions
and fourfold degenerate sites, which is unlikely to have
resulted from selective pressure, thus indicating recombination. For the complete genomes, similar recombination
indices were obtained using both tests. Some differences
were observed when individual major genes were considered which could be attributed to different methodology
and/or different parameters used by the two different
algorithms.
Host-imposed immune selection was investigated by
scanning dN/dS ratios across the genome. The variation
found across the genome was consistent with that found
for HIV-1 group M. Of particular interest was the fairly

low ratios obtained for the gag gene which has been
extensively implicated in CTL escape [3,20]. Further investigations of our analysis also indicates which genome
regions have high dN/dS ratios. Though various reports
have documented the evolutionary constraints placed by
overlapping reading frames and secondary structures on
RNA viruses such as HIV-1 [21,22], it is important to note
that the exact number and location of the identified positively selected sites are not under investigation. Rather this
study focuses on attributing the discordant phylogenetic
patterns detected over time between cohort members by
the possible contribution of positive selection. Differential selective pressure was found to have substantially contributed to virus evolution within these three cohort
members.
Furthermore, it is noteworthy that while recombination
in addition to selection forces may have contributed to the
formation of the virus causing the gradual progression of
HIV in the 2 recipients, it is possible that the HIV status of
these individuals is associated with their HLA types, and
not only due to the possible emergence of CTL escape
mutations or other host factors as described previously
[7,15,23].
In addition, by investigating the divergence of the serially
sampled sequences using linear regression [24], we analyzed the rate of viral evolution. Although this analysis is
suggestive of higher evolutionary rates in both progressors, the overlapping confidence intervals do not allow us
to conclude significant differences. Earlier reports conducted by Ganeshan et al., and Essajee and colleagues
based their HIV diversity studies on only partial segments
of the env gene [25,26], conducting similar phylogenetic
analysis but assessing viral heterogeneity either through
heteroduplex assays or nucleotide based distance matrices, respectively. Despite both reports depending only on
the env gene, which is naturally variable, both indicate
that early quasispecies diversification may be associated
with a favorable clinical outcome, with limited heterogeneity correlating to slower HIV disease, and a lack of vertical transmission from mother child pairs, respectively
[25,26]. Taken together, literature suggests that an inverse

relationship exists between viral diversity and disease progression [25,26], however other studies inclusive of ours
also indicate the contrary [15,27]. Moreover, as our
analysis relies on predetermined mathematical algorithms the assumption of data independence by linear
regression estimates is violated as sequences share a phylogenetic history. Therefore, we estimated the evolutionary
rates using a maximum likelihood framework that takes
this into account and allows us to test different hypotheses using local clock models imposed onto the genealogy
[28,29]. This molecular clock analysis, confirmed a higher
rate of evolution in progressors B and C, as opposed to a
lower rate in non-progressing donor A. The fact that HIV
evolutionary rate could be patient-specific and influenced
by immunologic control or even therapy-induced control
[30], has major implications for evolutionary and vaccine
studies. In our study it is difficult to assess the role of
therapy-induced control of HIV-evolution as both patient
B and C, who received therapy, had intermittent changes
in drug regimen, which usually comprises of a cocktail of
drugs and makes it impossible to dissect the role of each
drug on the virus. Previous studies have indicated that
combinations of RT drugs can act together to further
increase HIV-1 mutation frequencies [30]. Thus, although
we believe that therapy may have partially influenced viral
evolution of HIV-1 strains in cohort patients, it is difficult
to assess contribution of individual drugs in affecting viral
evolutionary rates. Nonetheless, it is important to reiterate
that it does not bias our overall interpretation of HIV disease progression as both recipients prior to initiation of
therapy (pre 1997) were showing a gradual decline in T
cell counts and rising plasma viremia.
Thus, the most unique aspect of our study the demonstration of patient-specific evolutionary rates as a major contributor to the general lack of a molecular clock in HIV. To
date no molecular clock model accommodates for recombination and one can dispute the relevance of the evolutionary rates obtained. However, the genealogy-based
estimates are in good agreement with the linear regression
estimates, which were based on the viral divergence for
each patient separately. Simulations have shown that
recombination, even in small amounts, can disturb the

molecular clock [31,32], and hence why the more general
non-clock model provides a better fit to this data.
Overall, our studies raise the possibility that non-progressors, in some cases may harbor both pathogenic and nonpathogenic variants. Host genetics may act as driving force
for positive selection of infecting strains [33]. Although
viral recombination and differential selective pressure
were found to have significantly affected virus variability
in all 3 cohort members, there was striking correlation
between faster viral evolutionary rate with accelerated disease progression.

Materials and methods
Cohort patient profiles
By using the well-described approaches of both Lookback
and Traceback, clusters of distant HIV transmissions can
be identified [34]. One such cluster was identified with
the donor A, who likely acquired infection in 1982 and
infected 2 recipients B (in 1983 autumn) and C (in 1983
summer) through blood transfusion. These infections
were confirmed serologically in late 1990. The donor has
remained well for over twenty years without requiring
antiretroviral therapy and has maintained CD4+ T cell
count above 550 cells/mm3 and CD8+ T cell count over
600 cells/mm3 and a viral load consistently less than
10000 copies /ml. In contrast, both recipients (B and C)
have required the use of highly active antiretroviral
therapy (HAART) which was initiated in 1995 and 1997
respectively (consisting of ddl/3TC/IMD) with recipient B
still alive. On the other hand recipient C experienced a
dramatic decline in CD4+ T cell count in 1997 down to
CD4+ T cell count of 7 cells / mm3 (Figure 1A, IB and 1C)
and has recently died of AIDS-related illness after 14 years
post-infection. HLA typing was also conducted revealing
patient A to be type A2, A3, B57, B65 and unknown for
locus C, patient B showed to be HLA A2, A11, B56, B62
and CW1, while patient C was similariy found to be HLA
A2, A24, B7, B13 and unknown for locus C. For a detailed
description of patient clinical profiles, patient HLA types
and phylogenetic evidence confirming epidemiological
linkage refer to Mikhail et al., 2005.
Full Length genome amplification of HIV-1 strains
Gene-Amp XL PCR kit (Perkin – Elmer Emerville Ca, USA)
together with nested internal PCR reactions were used to
amplify near full-length HIV genomes (8766 base pairs,
the LTR domains were amplified separately) as previously
published [5,15]. Population sequencing was conducted
on a total of four longitudinal cohort samples obtained
from donor A, termed Al, A3, A5, and A6 and corresponded to years 1992, 1997, 1998 and 2000. Similarity
4 time points from patient B were termed B3, B4, B5 and
B6 correspond to years: 1992, 1997, 1998 and 2000 for
sample collection, with C2, C3, C5, C6, C8, C10 and C11

representing patient C samples obtained from 1993,
1994, 1996, 1993, 1997, 1998 and 2000. To investigate
the presence of patient mutations within a known CTL
epitope, a database search was conducted within the Los
Alamos (NM, USA) immunology database [18]. HIV-1
near full length sequences derived from cohort patients
were consequently used to confirm epidemiological linkage and investigate molecular gene by gene comparisons
as previously published [15].
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of cohort patients
Population nucleotide sequences and peptide sequences
were aligned using CLUSTAL W [35] and manually edited
in Se-AI according to their reading frame. The best-fitting
nucleotide-substitution model was selected using
Modeltestv3.06 [36], Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed in PAUP4.0bl0, starting from a Neighbor-Joining
tree under a heuristic maximum likelihood search that
implemented both nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI)
and subtree pruning-regrafting (SPR). Bootstrap analysis
was performed using the Neighbor-Joining method on
1000 replicates (previously published in Mikhail et al.,
2005). Bayesian trees were reconstructed in mrBayes
v2.01. Network analysis was performed in Splitstree 2.4.
Recombination analysis
Since the detection of specific recombination patterns and
breakpoints in closely related sequences might be unreliable, evidence for recombination was investigated on a
non-overlapping DNA concatemer or in single gene
regions using two different tests: (a) the Informative Sites
Test (IST) as implemented in PIST on the third codon
positions [16], and (b) the Homoplasy Test on the
fourfold degenerate sites [16]. The Homoplasy Test determines if there is a statistically significant excess of homoplasies in the phylogenetic tree derived from the data set,
compared to an estimate of the number of homoplasies
expected by repeated mutation in the absence of recombination [37]. An index of greater than zero indicates linkage equilibrium or recombination, but a value of zero or
less indicates pure clonal evolution [34], The IST test
detects whether the proportion of two-state parsimonyinformative sites to all polymorphic sites is greater than
expected from clonally generated data [16].
Selective pressure
Non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio's
(dN/dS) were estimated in a sliding-window fashion
under a probabilistic model of codon substitution that
restricts all sites to a single dN/dS (M0) index across the
complete genome [28]. All calculations were performed
using the codeml program from the PAML package.

Evolutionary rate analysis
Root-to-tip divergences were calculated in VirusRates v.0,
provided by Andrew Rambaut [24]. Confidence intervals
for the linear regression estimates were obtained by bootstrapping the original alignment. Maximum likelihood
analysis and local clock modeling was performed in
PAML v 3.13 b, provided by Ziheng Yang, which implements a tip-date model estimated as additional parameters under the constraint that the positions of the tips are
proportional to the sampling date [28].
