Abstract
Background: Rodent and primate pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) gene families have
expanded independently from a common ancestor and are expressed virtually exclusively in
placental trophoblasts. However, within each species, it is unknown whether multiple paralogs have
been selected for diversification of function, or for increased dosage of monofunctional PSG. We
analysed the evolution of the mouse PSG sequences, and compared them to rat, human and baboon
PSGs to attempt to understand the evolution of this complex gene family.
Results: Phylogenetic tree analyses indicate that the primate N domains and the rodent N1
domains exhibit a higher degree of conservation than that observed in a comparison of the mouse
N1 and N2 domains, or mouse N1 and N3 domains. Compared to human and baboon PSG N
domain exons, mouse and rat PSG N domain exons have undergone less sequence homogenisation.
The high non-synonymous substitution rates observed in the CFG face of the mouse N1 domain,
within a context of overall conservation, suggests divergence of function of mouse PSGs. The rat
PSG family appears to have undergone less expansion than the mouse, exhibits lower divergence
rates and increased sequence homogenisation in the CFG face of the N1 domain. In contrast to
most primate PSG N domains, rodent PSG N1 domains do not contain an RGD tri-peptide motif,
but do contain RGD-like sequences, which are not conserved in rodent N2 and N3 domains.
Conclusion: Relative conservation of primate N domains and rodent N1 domains suggests that,
despite independent gene family expansions and structural diversification, mouse and human PSGs
retain conserved functions. Human PSG gene family expansion and homogenisation suggests that
evolution occurred in a concerted manner that maintains similar functions of PSGs, whilst
increasing gene dosage of the family as a whole. In the mouse, gene family expansion, coupled with
local diversification of the CFG face, suggests selection both for increased gene dosage and
diversification of function. Partial conservation of RGD and RGD-like tri-peptides in primate and
rodent N and N1 domains, respectively, supports a role for these motifs in PSG function.

Background
In tandemly repeated gene families, in which all members
share a common function, there is a tendency for concerted evolution that is characterised by homogenisation
of gene sequences [1]. Classical examples include the histone and ribosomal RNA genes. In such cases the expansion of gene families is driven by selection for high
expression [2]. Concerted evolution is generally maintained by unequal crossover, intergenic gene conversion
or other illegitimate recombination mechanisms [1,2].
Conversely, there are multigene families whose members
encode diverse functions e.g. genes encoding immunoglobulin (Ig), T cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins [1]. Such diversity
occurs when there is less homogenisation than mutation,
due to the evolution of specific programmed mutational
mechanisms [3]. In addition, more complex modes exist;
for example, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variableregion (VH) genes encode proteins with identical functions, but exhibit little concerted evolution [4]. Instead,
their evolution is governed by divergence and a birth-anddeath process of gene duplication and dysfunctioning
mutations [2].
Similar to other families of highly expressed trophoblastspecific genes such as the pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) [5], the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins,
which are the most abundant foetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream during human late pregnancy, are
encoded by multiple tandemly arrayed genes [6,7]. The
PSG family of glycoproteins, with the related CEA-related
cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) proteins, are part of
the immunoglobulin superfamily [8]. The Ig domain
structure of the human and mouse PSGs differs, as follows: Human PSGs contain one V-like Ig domain (N), C2like Ig domains (A and B) and relatively hydrophilic tails
(C), with domain arrangements classified as type I (N-A1A2-B2-C), type IIa (N-A1-B2-C), type IIb (N-A2-B2-C),
type III (N-B2-C) and type IV (A1-B2-C) [9]. In contrast,
mouse PSGs typically have three or more N domains followed by a single A domain [7,10]. The common ancestor
of rodent and primate PSGs and CEACAMs was probably
similar to CEACAM1, which is the only CEA family member with an identical gene structure in the human, rat and
mouse that encodes all types of extracellular domains
present in CEACAM and PSG proteins. The time of initial
gene duplication is estimated at 90 Myr [11], approximately the time of rodent-primate divergence. The independent expansion of human and mouse PSG gene
families occurred through further gene duplication and
exon shuffling events [7,12,13].
The independent expansion of PSG gene families in
rodents and primates indicates convergent evolution,
implying that PSG function is conserved. These events can

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/39

be interpreted in the context of evolutionary theories of
parent-offspring and inter-sibling conflicts that promote
transcriptional 'arms races' leading to high expression of
trophoblast-specific genes that influence maternal investment in offspring [14,15]. In one scenario, duplicated
PSG genes are selected because they increase effective PSG
dosage, thereby enhancing an effect on maternal investment in offspring. In this context, it is noteworthy that
human PSG N domains contain putative integrin-binding
'RGD' motifs that are proposed to mediate cell interactions with the extracellular matrix [16,17] and immune
cells [18]. Such PSG-mediated functions could potentially
influence trophoblast invasion or maternal immune cell
function. However, not all human, and none of the
mouse, PSGs contain an RGD motif [7], suggesting that, if
human RGD motifs are functionally significant, there has
been diversification of function of some human, and all
mouse, PSGs, relative to a putative RGD-containing ancestor. In the context of parent-offspring conflict, such divergence might reflect co-evolution of PSGs and their
receptors, similar to the co-evolution of ligand / receptor
pairs observed in host-pathogen interactions [19,20].
In this study, we sought to analyse PSG evolution to determine the extent and patterns of rodent and primate PSG
sequence divergence by analysing intraspecific and interspecies DNA substitution rates in PSG coding regions. We
also sought evidence in support of functionality of RGD
and RGD-like tri-peptide motifs in PSG amino-terminal
effector domains.

Results
Pairwise comparisons of all 4-domain mouse PSG with all
4-domain human PSG full-length amino acid sequences
indicates conservation of the amino-terminal N domain
With the exception of mouse PSG24, PSG30 and PSG31
and human PSG2 and PSG5, all PSGs for which full
length sequences are available have a structure based on
four Ig-like domains and a leader sequence that is cleaved
during post-translational processing. The only type of
domain found in all rodent and primate PSGs is the N
domain located at the amino terminus. Indeed, this
domain is shared by all members of the extended CEA
family, suggesting that it may contain important functional motifs. We sought to test this hypothesis with
respect to PSG function, by analysing both full-length PSG
sequences and selected domains of possible functional
importance. Alignments of full-length 4-domain human
and mouse PSG protein sequences were generated with
ClustalX, followed by pairwise comparisons of all mouse
sequences with all human sequences. Mean Dayhoff
PAM250 log scores were calculated for each alignment
position and grouped by domain. The scores within each
of the four domains were then visualised using box and
whisker plots (which show the median value, upper and

determined for pairwise comparisons of each sequence in
the set of mouse PSGs against all sequences in the set of
human PSGs. Mouse Psg24, Psg30 and Psg31 along with
human PSG2 and PSG5 were omitted from the analysis due
to expansions or contractions of total domain complement
which would complicate generation of the initial clustalX
alignment. The scores were split into five groups, according
to domain structure, and used to generate a box and whisker
plot. Domain name abbreviations shown on the X-axis correspond to the following domain comparisons: L/L, human L
versus mouse L domain; N/N1, human N versus mouse N1
domain; A1/N2, human A1 versus mouse N2 domain; A2/N3,
human N2 versus mouse N3 domain; B2/A, human B2 versus
mouse A domain. Significant differences of p < 0.0001 were

lower quartiles plus range) (Fig. 1). The N domains exhibited significantly higher scores (p < 0.001) than the other
three domains, with positive scores indicating conservation. There was no evidence of interspecies conservation
of the other domains, which is unsurprising given the
known lack of orthology between human A1 / mouse N2,
human A2 / mouse N3, and human B2 / mouse A domain
pairs.
Novel rat PSG N1 domains identified by database searches
Rat N1 domain exon sequences were identified in NCBI
and Ensembl databases. Three novel rat PSG genes were
identified and named PSG41, PSG42 and PSG43 in keeping with accepted nomenclature [21]. We also identified a
novel PSG40 splice variant with alternative leader and N1

domain exons, situated between the N1 and N2 domain
exons of the published PSG40 sequence (NM_021677).
Both BLAST and pattern matching methods retrieved the
same rat PSG genes from different databases; therefore we
considered our search to be exhaustive. All rat PSG genes
were found to reside on contig NW_047556 and this was
used for the prediction of remaining exons for each PSG
gene based on BLAST generated alignments with mouse
Psg gene sequences (Table 1). The CDS sequences of the
novel predicted rat PSG genes and PSG40 splice variant
are listed in additional file 1. We used our predicted
sequences in preference to the publicly available
sequences in our analyses.
SplitsTree analysis reveals relatively high contradiction in
rat PSG N1 domain alignments, compared to mouse
Following the preliminary identification of amino-terminal N domain conservation, we planned to use an evolutionary tree building approach to further examine interdomain relationships in rodent and primate PSGs. However, using split decomposition analysis, McLenachan et
al. [22], in their study of a subset of human PSGs, concluded that it is not possible to accurately determine
branch points in an evolutionary tree of human PSGs.
Split decomposition analysis identifies contradictory relationships within alignment data; for example, there may
be a pattern grouping PSGX and PSGY together, and
another pattern grouping PSGY and PSGZ together [23].
This information is normally approximated when drawing evolutionary trees, however split decomposition is a
non-approximation method that permits the building of
trees with support indicated for relationships based on all
patterns in the data. Such analysis can therefore predict to
a limited extent the occurrence of sequence homogenisation e.g. by gene conversion or positive selection.

We performed split decomposition analysis on nucleotide
sequences using the SplitsTree4 program [24] on the individual domain exons of mouse Psg genes (Fig. 2). For a
more complete analysis of N1 domains we also performed the analysis using rat N1 domain exons, all known
human N1 domain exons and all known baboon N1
domain exons (Fig. 3). We detected no conflicting signals
for mouse Psg N1 domain exons (Fig. 2A), in contrast to
the human N domain exons (Fig. 2B). However, our
results for human N1 domains (Fig. 3B) differ from those
obtained by McLenachan et al. [22] because we observed
only two contradictions: i. regarding the relationship of
PSG4 and PSG9 to each other, and to their nearest neighbours PSG3 and the common ancestor of PSG6 and
PSG10 and, ii. between 'the relationship of PSG2 to PSG1
and PSG11'. This discrepancy is probably due to our
inclusion of four extra PSG N1 domain sequences, and the
fact that the PSG11 sequence (GenBank: M69025) used
by McLenachan et al. [22] has been updated.

Analysis of the mouse N2 domains indicates numerous
contradictions in the alignments of the Psg24, Psg29,
Psg30, Psg31 and Psg32 group (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the N3
domains exhibit no discernable conflicts (Fig. 2C). The A
domain only showed contradiction within the Psg24,
Psg29, Psg30, Psg31 and Psg32 group (Fig. 2D). Examination of the rat PSG N1 domain exon alignments demonstrated minor contradictions between the common
ancestor of PSG36, PSG37 and PSG39 and that of PSG38
and PSG41 (Fig. 3A). In contrast to all the other PSG N1
domains thus compared, the baboon PSGs demonstrate
considerable conflicting signals as demonstrated by the
'spider's web' appearance of the SplitsTree graph (Fig. 3C).

B

Phylogenetic analysis indicates interspecific aminoterminal N domain conservation and identifies potential
mouse / rat orthologues
Few examples of orthologous relationships between PSG
sequences have been identified. In order to compare the
relationship between rodent and primate amino-terminal
N domain exon coding sequences, an NJ tree was produced (Fig. 4). The tree was generated from ClustalX alignments of nucleotide sequences, with bootstrapping 1000
times to test the reliability of branches. The human and
baboon N sequences formed one distinct cluster, the
mouse and rat N1 sequences formed a second, the mouse
N2 domains formed a third and the mouse N3 domains
formed a fourth. Of particular interest was the split
between the ancestral N-type domain and the common
ancestor of the N2 and N3 domains. The confidence of
this split was 93% and demonstrates that the mouse N1
domains are more closely related to primate N domains
than to the mouse N2 and N3 domains. A similar comparison of the entire set of mouse and human PSG domains
confirmed that the interspecific N domain clustering is
unique because the human PSG A1 and A2 domains segregated into distinct branches (sharing a common ancestor with the mouse A domains) and the B2 domains
cluster on a distinct branch (Fig. 5).

Mouse and rat PSG gene coding sequences were analysed
using an NJ plot which highlighted four putative orthologous relationships, as follows: rat PSG36 and mouse
Psg24; rat PSG40 and mouse Psg29; rat PSG42 and mouse
Psg32; rat PSG38 and mouse Psg16 (Fig. 6). There is also
distinct branching of rat PSG43 with mouse Psg30 and
Psg31. The orthologous relationship is also supported for
PSG36 and Psg24 because both contain five N domains.

of the N domains (Fig. 7A). The CFG face of CEACAM N
domains has been shown to interact with pathogens and
mammalian proteins (Fig. 7B). Within Box 1 and Box 2,
there is considerable variation between mouse N1
domains, which is illustrated quantitatively using Dayhoff
charts (Figs. 8 â 10). Positive Dayhoff scores and generally
low standard deviations indicate good conservation of
mouse PSG N1 domains (Fig. 8), and even stronger conservation of human PSG N domains (Fig. 9). The latter
may be explained by homogenisation of human PSG gene
sequences [22]. Dayhoff score analysis using comparisons
of all mouse N1 domain versus all human N domain
ClustalX aligned sequences gives an indication, at the
amino acid level, of the general pattern of evolution of
these domains since the rodent / primate divergence (Fig.
10). Again, the majority of residues exhibit good conservation, and relatively little variability is observed between
pair-wise comparisons particularly with regard to residues
that are involved in protein folding. The reduction in size

To gain further insight into mouse Psg N domain exon
evolution, the N1, N2 and N3 domain exons of mouse Psg
genes (mN1, mN2 and mN3, respectively), the N1
domain exons of rat PSG genes (rN1) and the N domain
exons of human PSG genes (hN) were analysed in the following comparisons: mN1 vs mN2; mN1 vs mN3; mN2
vs mN3; mN1 vs rN1; mN1 vs hN. Synonymous (ds) and
non-synonymous (dn) substitutions per synonymous and
non-synonymous site, respectively, were determined in
each case for all combinations of PSG gene pairwise comparisons, and box and whisker plots were generated from
the data (Fig. 11). The majority of data points derived
from individual comparisons lie under the 45Â° line of
equivalence where dn = ds, and most variation in the comparisons lies within the values of ds (Fig. 11A). When the
data are presented as box and whisker plots, the values are
indicative of conservation, with median values ranging
from 0.48 â 0.70 (Fig. 11B). The higher values for median
dn/ds in the mN1 vs rN1 comparison appear to be the
result of a tighter ds distribution as observed in Fig. 11A,
with values not exceeding one substitution per synonymous site in any pairwise comparison.
In view of the sequence variations in the CFG face, which
are visible in alignments (Fig. 7A), against a background
of overall conservation, as estimated from dn/ds analysis,
we sought to determine whether the dn/ds values were
higher in the CFG face than the ABED face of the N1
domain. Nucleotide sequence alignments were generated
using all mouse Psg N1 domain exons (based on protein
alignments), and the nucleotides present in the three sections comprising the CFG face (Boxes 1, 2 & 3; Fig. 7A)
were separated from those comprising the ABED face. The
two new sets of data were analysed individually to determine mean dn and ds values from pairwise comparisons of
all sequences within each dataset (Fig. 12). A plot of dn vs
ds for the ABED face of the mouse N1, N2 and N3
domains (Fig. 12A) demonstrates a distribution of pairwise-alignment data points which overwhelmingly lie
below the line of equivalence. However, a similar plot
generated from analysis of the CFG face has data points
distributed approximately equally on both sides of the
line of equivalence (Fig. 12B). This is due predominately
to a higher number of non-synonymous substitutions.
The values of dn/ds obtained for the CFG face in the N1,
N2 and N3 domains of the mouse and the N1 domain of
the rat are all significantly greater than the values obtained
for the ABED face (p < 0.0001, Fig. 12C). The dn/ds values
obtained for the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domain CFG faces
equal or exceed 1.0, with the highest median value of 1.1

High amino acid sequence variability is found in the CFG faces of mouse PSG N1 domains. Alignments of the
mouse PSG N1 domain amino acid sequences were performed using ClustalW. The locations of the Î²-strands (A-G) were
derived from the crystal structure of the mouse CEACAM1 N domain [25], and are indicated by blue arrows. The boxed
amino acids sequences form the CFG face of the N domain (deduced by structural modelling). (A) Alignment of mouse PSG N1
domain amino acid sequences. The signal peptide (leader) cleavage site is shown as a dotted line and N domain amino acid
numbering commences from the first amino acid of the mature N domain. (B) Alignment of CEACAM N domains (minus signal

observed in the N1 domain. The rat N1 domains are more
conserved, with dn/ds values derived from both the CFG
and ABED faces under 1.0 on average.
Evidence of conservation of RGD-like motifs in mouse N1
domains
Within Box 3 of the CFG face (Fig. 7A) there is evidence of
conservation of putative integrin-interacting RGD-like
motifs in the mouse N1 domain, which may have functional significance. To investigate this possibility further,
a survey of all mouse, rat, baboon and human PSG RGD,
and related, motifs was compiled (Fig. 13). Extant primate
and rodent PSG RGD-like motifs are linked in sequence
space by an RGD motif encoded by the sequence CGA
GGA GAT which, incidentally, is not observed in any of
the extant PSG coding sequences. The most commonly
observed motif, RGD, is encoded by CGA GGT GAT, and
the majority of variants are closely related to this
sequence. In rodents, RGE and HGE are the most

commonly observed motifs. However, the NGK motif,
which is not an RGD-like motif as we have defined it, is
well represented, and is separated in sequence space from
HGE by a transition and a transversion.
Of the seventeen aligned mouse PSG N1 domain exon
sequences, 53% possess a tri-peptide at the site of the
RGD-like motif belonging to the RGD-like 5-1-4 tri-group
(as defined in the Methods section). For comparative purposes, tri-groups were determined for tri-peptide motifs at
fifty random positions within the alignment. The number
of most commonly represented tri-groups at each position
was expressed as a percentage of the number of aligned
sequences, and the mean and standard deviation was
determined to indicate the mean maximal tri-group representation for the 50 random alignment positions. The
control value obtained was 67.6 Â± 22.9%; the value of
53% of 5-1-4 tri-groups at the RGD site therefore lies
within the control range, albeit 14.6% below the mean

value. However, a more revealing statistic is derived from
aligning the mouse N1 domains with the mouse N2 and
N3 domains (see additional file 2), compared to aligning
the mouse N1 domains with the human N domains. In
the former comparison (mouse N1 vs N2 and N3
domains) the most commonly represented tri-group is 42-5, with 27% representation. This tri-group is not RGDlike and its representation is lower than the mean maximal tri-group representation of 49.8 Â± 22.7% determined
for fifty random alignment positions. However, when the
mouse N1 domain is aligned with the human N domain,
the most commonly represented tri-group is the RGD-like
5-1-4 group which has 59% representation, comparable
to the mean maximal tri-group representation of 60.7 Â±
20.4%.

Discussion
We recently collated the full-length coding sequences of
the entire mouse Psg gene family [7]. In the present study
we aimed to identify evolutionary signals embedded in
Psg gene and PSG protein sequences to determine whether
PSG protein function has diverged between the rodent
and primate lineages, and to attempt to understand the
reasons for the independent expansions of rodent and primate PSG gene families.
Mouse and human PSG protein amino-terminal N
domains exhibit different patterns of evolution. McLenachan et al. [22] analysed the evolution of a subset of
human PSGs using split decomposition analysis and
found, in individual comparisons of N, A1, B2 and C
domain exons, strong contradictions in alignments,
which they suggested was due to gene conversion and/or

positive selection. Our similar analysis of an expanded set
of human PSG sequences revealed a detectable, but less
marked, degree of homogenisation. Analysis of mouse N
and A domain exons showed that, in general, there is less
evidence of purifying selection compared to the human,
although there are examples of gene conversions as
described previously for the closely related Psg21 and
Psg23 genes [12]. Detailed analysis of alignments using
plots of Dayhoff scores confirmed the difference between
mouse and human N domain evolution.
Using dn/ds analysis for interspecies comparisons, we
found that the PSG protein amino-terminal N and N1
domains are relatively conserved, consistent with conservation of function in rodents and primates. However,
inspection of mouse PSG N1 domain alignments, and
scrutiny of corresponding Dayhoff scores, revealed
regions of apparently poor conservation. These regions
correspond to the CFG face within the N1 domain of

CEACAM1. In the CEACAM family, the CFG face interacts
with pathogens and mammalian proteins. Comparisons
of dn/ds values obtained from the CFG and ABED faces of
mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains confirmed that the CFG
face has evolved more rapidly than the ABED face in all
three domains. The greatest effect was observed in the N1
domain exon with a doubling of the dn/ds ratio in the CFG
face compared with the ABED face. The dn/ds ratio of 1.1
suggests weak positive selection on the CFG face of the N1
domain. The increase in the dn/ds ratio appears to be
mainly due to an increase in the dn value, indicative of
diversification. The high dn/ds values for the CFG face in
the N2 and N3 domains, which are not known to interact
with ligands, could be due to a low contribution of these
sequences to the structural integrity of the IgV-like
domain.
Interestingly, the rat N1 domain CFG face does not appear
to have evolved as rapidly as the mouse N1 domain, with

Relationship between RGD-like motifs in human, baboon, mouse and rat PSG N domains
Relationship between RGD-like motifs in human, baboon, mouse and rat PSG N domains. The font size used for
each tri-peptide motif represents relative abundance among the PSG proteins, and the codon sequences are shown underneath. Arrows represent single or double (x2) transitions (ts) or transversions (tv) as indicated. Motifs and codon sequences in
grey type are intermediates that have not been observed in vivo. Primate RGD-like motifs cluster naturally in the left-hand box,
whereas those of the rodents cluster in the right-hand box. The baboon derived PAE motif is an outlier and is bracketed.

a dn/ds ratio of 0.9. This observation, combined with the
relatively smaller number of PSG genes identified in the
rat (eight to date, compared to seventeen in the mouse)
and the higher level of gene homogenisation implied by
split decomposition analysis suggests that the rat PSG
gene family has not expanded or diversified as extensively
as the mouse. However, we cannot exclude the possibility
that further rat PSG genes may yet be identified because
there may be under-representation in the WGS database
[26]. Notwithstanding this possibility, there has clearly
been ongoing turnover of the PSG gene family in all of the
lineages analysed, as there are no known human orthologues of rat and mouse PSGs, and only four potential
orthologous relationships between known rat and mouse
PSGs.
These findings suggest partial conservation of PSG N
domain function across rodent and primate lineages.
However, the relaxed constraint on the CFG face of mouse
PSGs suggests diversification of binding partners or modification of existing ligand-binding kinetics, analogous to
the CEACAMs. This observation receives experimental

support from the recent observation that treatment of
mouse macrophages in vitro with recombinant mouse
PSG17N, or human PSG1 or PSG11, induces cytokine
expression; however, only in the case of mouse PSG17N
does this depend on CD9 receptor expression [27]. Divergence of PSG function is also suggested by differences in
the level and developmental timing of expression of
different mouse PSGs [7,12], expansion of N domain
number in PSG24, PSG30 and PSG31 [7], and loss of
secretory signals in PSG32 and in the brain-specific splice
variant of PSG16.
As noted above, the only PSG receptor identified to date is
the integrin-associated tetraspanin, CD9, which binds the
N1 domain of mouse PSG17 but not, apparently, to
human PSGs [28]. However, a peptide containing the
RGD motif from the human PSG9 N domain binds to a
receptor on a promonocytic cell line suggesting that some
human PSGs may effect their functions through an
integrin-type receptor [18]. In this context, the high
frequency of the RGD motif on an exposed loop in primate PSG N domains (seven of ten in human and five of

Page 15 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:39

fifteen in baboon) may be significant. Rodent PSG N1
domains do not have an RGD motif, but have a high frequency of the RGD-like motifs RGE, HGE and HAE on the
CFG face. Under the null hypothesis that these motifs are
unlikely to underpin structural integrity of the N1 domain
and are therefore free of constraint, our analysis reveals
evidence of unexpected conservation of RGD-like motifs
in the N1 domain, which have been lost in the N2 and N3
domains. Given the high transition and transversion rates
in the N1 domain and the fact that the mouse N1, N2 and
N3 domains share a common ancestor after the divergence of the rodent / primate lineages, the conservation of
RGD-like motifs exclusively in the N1 domain may have
functional significance. We note that the RGE motif in the
context of the POEM protein induced apoptosis of
MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro [29]. We speculate that certain
RGE or RGE-like motifs may elicit weak cell attachment,
followed by apoptosis â a combination of properties,
reminiscent of snake venom disintegrins [30,31], that
could have important functional implications in the context of the extensive tissue remodelling that occurs during
placentation [32].
In summary, our data are consistent with experimental
evidence indicating functional convergence of rodent and
primate PSGs, in spite of the independent expansions of
the gene families in the two lineages. In the context of
parent-offspring conflict, the homogenisation of human
PSG sequences is consistent with the theory that placental
hormones encoded by multigene families are monofunctional and selected for high expression, possibly due to
coevolution with physiologically conflicting maternal
mechanisms [15]. However, the evidence for positive
selection on the CFG face of the N1 domain implies
divergent evolution of rodent PSGs. Allied to the evidence
for functionality of putative integrin-interacting RGD-like
motifs in rodents, a scenario can be envisaged whereby
the different RGD-like motifs observed in human and
baboon PSGs also suggest some degree of functional
divergence in these species.

Conclusion
Our analysis provides evidence for conservation of rodent
and primate PSG amino-terminal N domains, with ongoing independent expansion of the gene families in the two
lineages. There has been some diversification of the CFG
face of mouse N1 domains, a region that includes putative
integrin-interacting RGD-like motifs. Our analysis provides reassurance that the mouse Psg gene family is a
suitable model system for the analysis of human PSG gene
function.

Identification of novel rat PSG N1 domain exons
Blast searches of the NCBI [34] and Ensembl [35]
RGSC3.1 rat genome databases were performed using
coding sequences from known rat PSGs (PSG36-PSG40)
and mouse PSGs. Additionally, a search pattern was developed
and
used
to
interrogate
the
Rattus_norvegicus.RGSC3.1.nov.dna_rm.contig.fa.gz
archive obtained from the Ensembl FTP resource [36]. The
search pattern was derived manually from alignments of
amino acid sequences from the N domain exon of all
known mouse and rat PSGs (mouse PSG16-PSG32 and rat
PSG36-PSG40) generated using the ClustalX 1.81 windows interface [37]. In PROSITE format [38] the search
pattern used was S-x-R-E-x(5)-G-x(3)-[IL]-x(3)-T-x(2)Dx(3)-Y-x(17,18)-L-x-V. Analysis was performed essentially
as described [39], with the program modified to search for
the selected pattern in peptides of fifty amino acids or
greater derived from genomic DNA sequences translated
in all six open reading frames. ClustalX alignments were
produced using the complete open reading frames
returned by the program combined with the N1 domains
of rat PSG36-PSG40. The alignments were trimmed to
include only N1 domain exon sequence and a NeighbourJoining tree was generated using MEGA version 2.1 software [40] to aid the identification of the new sequences.
Phylogenic analysis
Mouse PSG sequences were obtained from McLellan et al.
[41], rat PSG sequences were obtained as described above,
human PSG sequences were obtained by name searches at
the NCBI Entrez (nucleotide or protein options) database
[42] and baboon N1 domain sequences were obtained as
described [43]. To generate protein alignments for examination by eye, a Web based ClustalW utility was used [44],
otherwise protein sequences were aligned with the
ClustalX using the default parameters. Nucleotide
alignments were generated based on ClustalX protein
alignments, such that where a single dash was placed in
the amino acid alignment, three dashes were placed in the
equivalent codon position in the nucleotide alignment.
The nucleotide alignments were then analysed using SplitsTree version 4b [24] and software and NJ trees were generated from the data (with bootstrapping 1000 times to
test the reliability of branches). Individual domains of the
mouse PSGs were also analysed by the split decomposition method using the same software. During NJ or
Splitstree tree-building, the Jukes-Cantor [45] correction
for multiple hits was applied and positions with gaps were
ignored.

Methods
Perl programs were written to perform most general
sequence manipulations and iterative tasks and executed

Comparisons of amino acids encoded at each site within
alignments
Multiple alignments of either one set (e.g. all mouse PSG
N1 domain exons only) or two sets (e.g. all mouse PSG
N1 and N2 domain exons) of amino acid sequences were
produced using ClustalX. A Perl program was written to
perform the subsequent analysis. At each position of the
alignment, the Dayhoff PAM250 log score was
determined for pairwise comparisons of each sequence in
the set against all the others in the set in one-set analyses,
or of all set 1 sequences against all set 2 sequences in twoset analyses. The mean and standard deviation of scores
obtained for the pairwise comparisons at each site were
determined to give an indication of the general level of
conservation and variability at the site. Sites where gaps
were present in any of the sequences were not analysed.
Where full-length mouse and human PSG amino acid
sequences were compared, the scores were split into five
groups at domain junctions and a box and whisker plot
produced.
Evolutionary analysis
ClustalX was used to produce multiple alignments of
either one set of amino acid sequences (e.g. all mouse PSG
N1 domain exons only) or two sets combined (e.g. all
mouse PSG N1 and N2 domain exons). These alignments
were used to inform the alignment of corresponding
nucleotide sequences as described above. Values of ds and
dn were determined for pairwise comparisons of each
sequence in a set against all the others in the set for oneset analysis, or of all set 1 sequences against all set 2
sequences for two-set analysis. The analysis was performed according the method of Yang and Neilsen [46]
using the 'YN00' program in the PAML3.14 software
package [47]. Before each pairwise comparison was executed, pairs of aligned sequences were extracted from the

whisker plots of dn/ds were produced in order to visualise
the data. Where statistical significance was evaluated, the
Mann-Whitney test was applied.
Analysis of tri-peptide amino acid property groupings
A perl program was written to analyse ClustalX alignments of mouse and human PSG N domain exons. These
alignments were inspected and modified where necessary.
For a tri-peptide at a given position within an alignment,
a tri-group code was generated for tri-peptide motifs based
on amino acid properties of the residues in the motif
where group 1 contains G, A, S, T; group 2: V, L, I, M;
group 3: F, Y, W; group 4: D, N, E, Q; group 5: H, K, R;
group 6: P; group 7: C. For example, an RGD tri-peptide
motif is represented by tri-group code 5-1-4 as arginine is
in group 5, glycine is in group 1, and aspartate is in group
4. Conversely, tri-group 5-1-4 is 'RGD-like' in terms of the
biochemical properties of the constituent amino acids.
The number of sequences in the alignment containing
each group code at a given position was determined. The
most highly represented group code in the alignment at
that position was used in the analysis. The program was
designed to compare a user selected tri-peptide motif
position with fifty randomly selected tri-peptide motif
positions.
