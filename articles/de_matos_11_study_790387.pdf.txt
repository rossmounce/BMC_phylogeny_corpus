Abstract
Background: Since the first report of the antiretroviral restriction factor TRIM5a in primates, several orthologs in
other mammals have been described. Recent studies suggest that leporid retroviruses like RELIK, the first reported
endogenous lentivirus ever, may have imposed positive selection in TRIM5a orthologs of the European rabbit and
European brown hare. Considering that RELIK must already have been present in a common ancestor of the
leporid genera Lepus, Sylvilagus and Oryctolagus, we extended the study of evolutionary patterns of TRIM5a to
other members of the Leporidae family, particularly to the genus Sylvilagus. Therefore, we obtained the TRIM5a
nucleotide sequences of additional subspecies and species of the three leporid genera. We also compared
lagomorph TRIM5a deduced protein sequences and established TRIM5a gene and TRIM5a protein phylogenies.
Results: The deduced protein sequence of Iberian hare TRIM5a was 89% identical to European rabbit TRIM5a,
although high divergence was observed at the PRYSPRY v1 region between rabbit and the identified alleles from
this hare species (allele 1: 50% divergence; allele 2: 53% divergence). A high identity was expected between the
Sylvilagus and Oryctolagus TRIM5a proteins and, in fact, the Sylvilagus TRIM5a was 91% identical to the Oryctolagus
protein. Nevertheless, the PRYSPRY v1 region was only 50% similar between these genera. Selection analysis of
Lagomorpha TRIM5a proteins identified 25 positively-selected codons, 11 of which are located in the PRYSPRY v1
region, responsible for species specific differences in viral capsid recognition.
Conclusions: By extending Lagomorpha TRIM5a studies to an additional genus known to bear RELIK, we verified
that the divergent species-specific pattern observed between the Oryctolagus and Lepus PRYSPRY-domains is also
present in Sylvilagus TRIM5a. This work is one of the first known studies that compare the evolution of the
antiretroviral restriction factor TRIM5a in different mammalian groups, Lagomorpha and Primates.

Background
Retroviruses are RNA viruses that, when infecting a host
cell, produce a viral reverse transcriptase and a viral
integrase that make a DNA copy of the viral genome
and integrate it into the host genome, respectively [1].
The family Retroviridae comprises a diverse range of
animal viruses, including the viral genus Lentivirus. Lentiviruses have been isolated from primates, domestic and
wild felids, and a variety of domestic ungulates (goat,
sheep, cattle and horse) [2]. Until recently, all known
lentiviruses were classified as exogenous (transmitted

horizontally from host to host) [3]. However, in 2007,
Katzourakis and colleagues [4] reported the first endogenous lentivirus identified in any species, the rabbit
endogenous lentivirus type K (RELIK), present in the
genome of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus).
RELIK has subsequently been reported in other leporid
genera (Lepus, Sylvilagus and Bunolagus), establishing it
as at least 12 million years (My) old [5,6]. These striking
observations demonstrate that lentiviruses are more
widespread than previously thought, extending the host
range to a different mammalian order, and demonstrate
that lentiviruses can be endogenized [4-6].
The intense study of lentiviruses in the past 30 years,
especially of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1
and HIV-2), has been more recently accompanied by

the study of antiretroviral restriction factors, like the
TRIM5a protein, one of the members of TRIM family
[7-11]. TRIM proteins contain three domains, which
together constitute the canonical TRIpartite Motif,
including an N-terminal RING domain, one or two BBox domains and a long Coiled-Coil (CC) domain
[9-11]. TRIM5, like most TRIM proteins, also contains a
C-terminal PRYSPRY domain, composed of four “variable loops” [9-11]. TRIM5a is the largest isoform
encoded by the TRIM5 gene and restricts infection by
HIV-1 and other retroviruses, dependent on a speciesspecific sequence variation in the PRYSPRY domain,
upon entry into the host cell cytoplasm and prior to
reverse transcription [7,8]. Each TRIM5a domain plays
distinct roles in its antiviral restriction activity. The
RING domain has been shown to confer E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity crucial for anti-HIV restriction [12,13].
The B-box 2 domain influences recognition of the viral
capsid by the C-terminal PRYSPRY domain [13-15]. The
CC domain plays an important role in the restriction of
viral infectivity and it is required for trimerization
[11,16]. Particularly for HIV-1 and N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) retroviruses, restriction specificity
has been mapped to the PRYSPRY domain for HIV-1
and N-MLV restriction specificity is determined by both
the CC and PRYSPRY domains [9,17,18]. Human
TRIM5a is not effective against HIV-1 but does inhibit
N-MLV, while rhesus monkey TRIM5a restricts both
[19-22]. However, a single amino acid change (R332P)
in the human TRIM5a PRYSPRY domain causes it to
behave like rhesus TRIM5a with regard to HIV-1
restriction [17,23]. The PRYSPRY domain binds to the
viral capsid, and the domain sequence variation determines the restriction specificity [17,18,24-26]. Recently,
evidence from several studies began elucidating the
detailed mechanism of TRIM5a activity. Also, additional
activities linked to viral restriction have been described,
including a role in signal transduction, the promotion of
innate immune signaling and recognition of the retroviral capsid lattice [27,28]. It has been suggested that
direct binding of TRIM5a to the viral capsid leads to
disruption of specific inter-hexamer interfaces, causing
structural damage to the capsid. TRIM5a spontaneously
forms a hexagonal lattice complementary to the capsid
lattice, a molecular signature of retroviruses, which
greatly stimulates TRIM5a lattice formation [29,30].
Evolutionary studies of primate TRIM5a revealed a
high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes
in the PRYSPRY domain [25,31-33]. The distribution of
positively selected residues is not random, but falls in a
very tight cluster at the beginning of the domain in a 13
amino acid “patch”, essential for retroviral restriction
and responsible, in part, for the species-specific restriction activity [31]. The same domain has also undergone

Page 2 of 12

length variation and segmental duplications in different
primate lineages [25]. However, polymorphisms found
in the TRIM5a coding sequence for multiple individuals
from two divergent lineages of Old World monkeys
(rhesus macaque and sooty mangabey), indicated that
specificity varies not only between different species but
also within species [34]. Despite the geographic separation and the divergence time (> 8 My), both species presented a highly similar pattern of polymorphisms, which
constitutes compelling evidence for long-term balancing
selection at the TRIM5 locus [34]. Similar evidence of
selection has been recently reported for the first intron
of human TRIM5 gene, which may affect transcription
factor-binding sites and TRIM5 transcriptional activity
[35].
Although evolutionary and functional studies of
TRIM5a antiretroviral restriction activity have primarily
focused on the primate lineage, TRIM5 orthologs have
been reported in other mammalian genomes, e.g.
mouse, rat, cow and European rabbit [36-39]. Active
TRIM5 was identified in the European rabbit and the
ability to restrict the replication of multiple unrelated
retroviruses was also described [38]. Besides this leporid,
Fletcher and co-workers [40] reported the restriction of
divergent retroviruses by European brown hare (Lepus
europaeus) TRIM5a and also significant differences
between both leporids’ TRIM5a PRYSPRY domains.
These authors suggested that retroviruses like RELIK
may have driven the speciation of the Old World rabbit
and hare TRIM5a orthologs. The order Lagomorpha is
divided into two families, Ochotonidae and Leporidae,
which diverged around 40 My ago [41-43]. Ochotonidae
contains only one extant genus, Ochotona, while the
family Leporidae includes 11 genera where, Lepus, Sylvilagus and Oryctolagus, the most well-studied leporid
genera, diverged around 12 My ago [41,42]. It has been
suggested that the global development of temperate
grasslands (7 to 5 My ago) and the formation of the
west Antarctic ice sheet (6.5 My ago) promoted the
development of land bridges and consequent dispersal
of the genus Lepus from North America through Asia
and into Africa [41]. The New World Sylvilagus lineage
initially remained in North America from which it more
recently colonized South America [41]. The genus Oryctolagus is the only leporid genus native to Europe and
consists of two subspecies, O. cuniculus cuniculus and
O. cuniculus algirus, which diverged around 2 My ago.
The subspecies O. c. algirus is restricted to the southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula and a few Atlantic
islands, whereas O. c. cuniculus has essentially a manmade worldwide distribution and includes all domestic
breeds [44].
As previously suggested, considering that RELIK must
already have been present in a common ancestor of

de Matos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:294

these leporid genera, the hypothesis that lentiviruses
might have been the driving force of the leporid
TRIM5a conserved antiretroviral activity can be challenged by extending the study of evolutionary patterns
of TRIM5a to other members of the Leporidae family,
particularly to the New World Sylvilagus lineage. Therefore, in this study we have examined the TRIM5a gene
of additional subspecies and species of the three leporid
genera: European rabbit subspecies (Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus), the Old World Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) and European brown hare, and the New World
brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani).

Results and Discussion
TRIM5a divergence and phylogeny in Lagomorpha

In this study, all the deduced TRIM5a protein
sequences obtained from leporids were aligned and
compared to that previously described for the European
rabbit (subspecies O. cuniculus cuniculus) [38] (Figure
1). To more completely assess the TRIM5a gene in the
Lagomorpha order, we also included American pika
(Ochotona princeps) TRIM5a nucleotide sequence
retrieved from the whole genome shotgun (WGS) project (contig132533, Locus AAYZ01132534). During this
work, we were able to bridge the American pika protein
sequence gaps previously reported [40] (Figure 1).
The 2 My divergence between European rabbit subspecies apparently allowed the accumulation of one private residue in the O. c. algirus PRYSPRY v1 region
(351H), different from O. c. cuniculus (Figure 1 and 2).
Amino acid position 327 was described as being polymorphic in O. c. cuniculus [40], but O. c. algirus clones
presented the same residue (327Q). In addition, two
other polymorphisms were observed in O. c. algirus
clones, one in the BB2 domain (98R/C) and the other in
the CC domain (148 N/K) (GenBank accession numbers
JN541226 and JN541227).
The sequencing of European brown hare TRIM5a
confirmed the previously reported findings [40]. However, our Lagomorpha TRIM5a alignment was somewhat different from that of Fletcher and colleagues [40]
due to the inclusion of new species and a more complete American pika protein sequence. Out of the 30
PRYSPRY v1 region residues, we identified 15 differing
positions between the European brown hare and the
European rabbit, resulting in 50% identity among v1
regions (Figure 1 and 3). TRIM5a from another species
of hare, Iberian hare, was also sequenced in this study.
With fourteen clones from two individuals, we identified
two alleles differing at three positions, each of them
located within the PRYSPRY variable region (332F/L,
391I/T and 427C/S) (GenBank accession numbers
JN541228 and JN541229) (Figure 1 and 2). As expected,
the overall identity between the TRIM5a protein

sequence of European rabbit and the TRIM5a deduced
protein sequence of the Iberian hare (89%) was the
same as that previously reported for the European
brown hare (89%) [40] which contrasted with the high
divergence at the PRYSPRY v1 region (allele 1: 50%
divergence; allele 2: 53% divergence) (Figure 3). The six
amino acid positions previously identified as being polymorphic residues in the European brown hare [40]
apparently were not polymorphic in the Iberian hare
TRIM5a sequenced clones. In fact, all the Iberian hare
clones presented the same residues as the European
brown hare allele 2 in these six positions (146T, 152A,
158K, 230L, 335V and 403Q). However, four positions
of all the Iberian hare TRIM5a sequenced clones (185K,
253D, 279I and 294R) differed from both European
brown hare alleles (185E, 253Y, 279T and 294H). None
of them occurred in the PRYSPRY v1 region, which was
identical among Lepus species, except for two polymorphic positions, one in the European brown hare
allele 1 (335F) and one in the Iberian hare allele 2
(332F).
The proposed leporid phylogeny estimates that the
Lepus lineage diverged 12.80 My ago from the Oryctolagus/Sylvilagus clade, and that the Sylvilagus and Oryctolagus genera diverged 10 My ago [41,42]. To extend the
study of leporid TRIM5a, we determined the TRIM5a
nucleotide sequence from brush rabbit (GenBank accession number JN541230). As the Sylvilagus and Oryctolagus genera are closely related, a higher identity between
their TRIM5a proteins was expected and, indeed, the
brush rabbit TRIM5a deduced protein sequence was
91% identical to the European rabbit protein (Figure 1).
However, such increase in similarity was not observed at
the PRYSPRY v1 region (50% similar between these species; Figure 3). From the seven clones obtained for this
species, no polymorphisms were observed.
The high divergence obtained in the PRYSPRY v1
region could be explained by gene conversion with adjacent genes. Gene conversion has been reported in other
mammalian genes. For example, in leporids, a gene conversion event was observed between the two chromosomally adjacent genes CCR2 and CCR5, where the
sequence motif 194 QTLKMT 199 of the CCR5 protein
was replaced by the HTIMRN motif which is characteristic of CCR2 [45,46]. In the present study, none of the
chromosomally adjacent genes showed clear evidence of
gene conversion with TRIM5, making this explanation
unlikely. Furthermore, no significant BLAST matches
were obtained during searches of the mammalian NCBI
database. No evidence of recombination between alleles
was observed.
To obtain evidence of within-species variation, the
number of individuals per species should be significant.
In this study, the number of individuals was low,

included. The trees typology was coincident with the
known species tree [41,42,48,49], where TRIM6 sequences
represented an outgroup, and primate and lagomorph
TRIM5a formed two orthologs groups. Due to the identical typology between the two sets of data, only the tree
based on nucleotide sequences is represented in Figure 4.

limiting the accuracy of the observed polymorphisms.
However, it cannot be ruled out that some of the sites
that appeared to be variable between species are polymorphisms present within species, especially when considering the two closely related Lepus species. A case of
trans-species polymorphism was reported in a study of
the evolution of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region in Oryctolagus and Lepus [47]. In light of
the previously described long-term balancing selection
on primate TRIM5a [34,35], this scenario cannot be
excluded in leporids.
Lagomorpha TRIM5a phylogenetic trees, based on
nucleotide, including all described alleles, and amino acid
deduced sequences, were obtained with the Maximum
Likelihood method (Figure 4). TRIM5a nucleotide and
amino acid sequences of three primates (human (Homo
sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and rhesus monkey

Inference of positive selection in Lagomorpha TRIM5a
protein

To identify a specific pattern of nucleotide substitution
in the leporid TRIM5a protein, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates were estimated using the
Nei-Gojobori method [50] and a non-synonymous to
synonymous substitution ratio (dN/d S) was calculated
(Table 1). Under neutrality, coding sequences are
expected to present a ratio of non-synonymous substitutions (dN) over synonymous substitutions (dS) that does
not significantly deviate from 1 (ω = dN/dS = 1), while
significant deviations may be interpreted as either the

Figure 4 Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees of lagomorph and primate TRIM5a and TRIM6 nucleotide sequences. TRIM5a
nucleotide sequences from Lagomorpha and three primates (human (Hosa), chimpanzee (Patr) and rhesus monkey (Mamu)), and TRIM6
nucleotide sequences from European rabbit and human were used to construct a Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree. The analyses were
performed with 1,000,000 generations and 1,000 bootstrap searches. The bootstrap values are indicated on the branches.

result of positive selection (ω > > 1) or of negative selection (ω < < 1). This simple analysis showed that the
ratios obtained between genera ranged from 2.8 to 4.3,
clearly higher than 1, suggesting that TRIM5a is under
strong positive selection.

The high variability of the PRYSPRY domain and the
positive selection of TRIM5a described in primates
[18,25,31-33] prompted Fletcher and colleagues (2010)
[40] to perform a codon-based selection analysis using
the random effect likelihood (REL) model. With this

analysis, the authors identified 11 positively-selected
codons, 4 of which were located in the PRYSPRY v1
region [40]. Using the same methodology and parameters,
we identified 25 positively-selected codons, 20 of which
are located in the PRYSPRY domain and, more specifically,
11 in the v1 region (Table 2). In Figure 3 the amino acid
and nucleotide sequences of Lagomorpha PRYSPRY v1
region are represented and the non-synonymous substitutions are marked. It should be pointed out that the
PRYSPRY domain was the site of the most intense positive
selection in primates [31-33]; its v1 region was identified
as the major determinant of anti-HIV-1 potency distinguishing the human and rhesus monkey TRIM5a proteins
[16-18,23-25,32]. The proposed evolutionary model for
primate TRIM5a in which a history of virus-host interactions led to species-specific adaptations [31] can be considered also for leporids. But again, the trans-species
scenario between leporid species cannot be ruled out to
explain the species-specific variations.

Our striking observation was visually reinforced by sliding-window analysis of TRIM5a nucleotide divergence
between species (Figure 5). Comparing Oryctolagus with
other leporid genera that diverged about 12 My ago, the
nucleotide differences throughout the gene occurred primarily around 0.00-0.10 and 0.00-0.05 nucleotide replacements per site for Lepus and Sylvilagus species,
respectively (Figure 5A, B and 5C). Nevertheless, the
nucleotide differences peak (~0.20) was observed around
nucleotide position 1000, where the PRYSPRY v1 region is
located (positions 967-1059). The 40 My separation
between Ochotona and the leporids is apparent in the 0.30
to 0.60 nucleotide replacements per site when comparing
American pika to European rabbit (Figure 5D). However,
the peak in the v1 region is still clearly defined. These
observations can be compared to the nucleotide differences among primates. The approximately 4.5-6 My of
evolutionary divergence between human and chimpanzee
[48,49,51] resulted in a nucleotide difference of 0-0.03

nucleotide replacements per site, although some peaks are
still defined, including one around the nucleotide position
1000 (Figure 4E). Comparison of the human and rhesus
monkey also revealed a peak in the PRYSPRY v1 region
(Figure 5F), variance similar to that observed among
leporid genera (~0.20), although the average nucleotide
differences are higher than between leporids (0.00-0.15
nucleotide replacements per site), which is consistent with
the < 31 My divergence time between human and rhesus
monkey [18,31].
The interest in studying ancient extinct viruses (paleoviruses) in primate genomes has increased in the past

few years. However, using sequences of “modern”
viruses to identify paleoviruses has been a problem and
some new strategies began to be applied. The approach
broadly used consists in looking for signatures of evolutionary adaptation in antiviral genes [52]. Several primate antiviral genes have already been studied and
positive selection was inferred, including the focus of
this paper, TRIM5a [e.g. [31,33,53,54]]. The detection of
extensive diversity in primate TRIM5a led the scientific
community to speculate that endogenous retroviruses
and/or exogenous lentiviral pathogens may have exerted
selective pressure on this host restriction factor and, in

de Matos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:294
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/294

the specific case of human TRIM5a, that the acquisition
of resistance to specific ancient endogenous retroviruses
may be responsible for our susceptibility to HIV-1 in
the present-day [31,32,55].
Assuming that selective pressure acts on the TRIM5a
region that recognizes variation in the capsid of retroviruses, it was predicted that the PRYSPRY v1 region
represents the interface with the capsid [18,25,31,32].
Recent studies showed that RELIK is highly similar
structurally to modern-day exogenous lentiviruses and
that the capacity of the capsid to form a protein-protein
complex with CypA is maintained [56]. CypA is a host
cell peptidyl proline isomerase that binds to the retroviral capsid [57,58]. With the absence of known exogenous lentiviruses affecting leporids, endogenous
retroviruses such as RELIK were suggested to dominate
leporid TRIM5a evolution after host germline infection
[40]. Our prediction was that the TRIM5a protein from
the third leporid genus known to harbor RELIK, the
New World genus Sylvilagus, should also reflect selective pressure patterns in specific regions previously
reported for the Old World Oryctolagus and Lepus genera. In fact, despite Sylvilagus being more closely related
to Oryctolagus, the sequence divergence in TRIM5a is
comparable to that found between European brown
hare, Iberian hare and the two O. cuniculus subspecies,
particularly in the PRYSPRY v1 region where the majority of positively-selected codons is concentrated.
The current release of both European rabbit and
American pika genomes has increased the opportunities
to identify other Lagomorpha endogenous retroviruses,
remnants of ancient extinct viruses. At the same time,
while comparing sequence data from several orthologs
of lagomorph antiviral genes, signatures of evolutionary
change in these antiviral genes could date when different ancient viral pathogens acted. Of course, it is not
correct to fully assume that only one ancient retrovirus
was responsible for selectively pressuring a specific antiviral gene and vice versa, or that an exogenous lentiviruses did not play a preponderant role in TRIM5a
Lagomorpha evolution. However, until other endogenous retroviruses are identified in leporid or even lagomorph genomes and due to the absence of known
exogenous lentiviruses infecting leporids, we speculate
that endogenous retroviruses like RELIK could have
acted as evolutionary forces on leporid TRIM5a.

Conclusions
This evolutionary study on Lagomorpha TRIM5a gene
shows a remarkable differentiation in the PRYSPRY v1
region suggesting that this gene has evolved under a
high selective pressure within the Lagomorpha order.
With the exception of studies on the primate lineage,
this is one of the first comprehensive and detailed

Page 9 of 12

evolutionary studies of the antiretroviral restriction factor TRIM5a. Furthermore, the similarities observed in
the species split within primates and lagomorphs allow
the establishment of comparisons of the evolutionary
patterns observed in TRIM5a gene.

Methods
Samples, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Liver samples from one European rabbit (subspecies
Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus; Orcual), two European
brown hares (Lepus europaeus; Leeu) and two Iberian
hares (L. granatensis; Legr) were supplied by CIBIO,
Vairão, Portugal. In addition, two brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani; Syba) spleen samples were provided by
the Blue Oak Ranch Reserve, University of California,
USA. During this study, no experimental research on
animals was conducted.
Total RNA was prepared using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (TRIzol)
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular
Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). Firststrand cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA,
using oligo(dT) primers [59] and the SuperScript™ III
First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA).
TRIM5a amplification, cloning and sequencing

The sequence of the European rabbit subspecies O. c.
cuniculus (Orcucu) TRIM5a used in this study was
taken
from
GenBank
(accession
number
NM_001105673) [38]. A previously reported [40] American pika (Ochotona princeps; Ocpr) TRIM5a nucleotide
sequence retrieved from the whole genome shotgun
(WGS) project (contig132533, Locus AAYZ01132534)
was also included.
PCR primers were designed from the available
sequence for European rabbit TRIM5a cDNA (Forward
5’-TGTCTTGCAGAAATCTGTGAGCAAAAG-3’and
Reverse 5’-AAGAGATGTACCCCAGGGTAAGAG-3’),
generating an approximately 1.5 kb PCR product corresponding to the full-length CDS. The PCR thermal profile used was the following: initial denaturation (98°C for
30 s); 40 cycles of denaturation (98°C for 10 s), annealing (60°C for 30 s) and extension (72°C for 1 min); and
a final extension (72°C for 10 min). Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) was
used. Finally, an additional extension step (72°C for 10
min) with Taq polymerase (GoTaq, Promega; Madison,
WI, USA) was performed.
The PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). At least seven
independent clones were sequenced per allele. Sequencing was performed with an ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic
Analyser (PE Applied Biosystems), following the ABI

de Matos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:294
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/294

PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing protocol.
PCR products were sequenced in both directions and
also with an internal primer (5’ CCAACAGGAGATAACTTCCTGGAA 3’). Nucleotide sequence data
obtained in this study have been submitted to GenBank
and have been assigned the following accession numbers: JN541226, JN541227, JN541228, JN541229 and
JN541230.
Phylogenetic analyses

In order to infer the Lagomorpha TRIM5a phylogeny,
based on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences,
a Maximum Likelihood method implemented on GARLI
1.0 (Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference)
[60] was used. The analyses were performed with
1,000,000 generations and 1,000 bootstrap searches. The
Model TIM3 +G for nucleotide substitution estimation
was used as indicated by the jModelTest 0.1.1 [61]. The
JTT [62] mutation model applied to the amino acid
deduced sequences was used with a rate variation
among sites with 4 rate categories (+G), as indicated by
the program Prottest 2.4 [63-65].
Codon-based analysis of positive selection

Most proteins appear to be under strong purifying selection most of the time, whereas positive selection is relegated to small regions of the molecule, meaning that
structural and functional domains are likely to evolve at
different rates [66]. A common approach to detect selective pressures involves estimating the rates of nonsynonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S ) substitutions
[67]. The random effect likelihood (REL) model proposed by Kosakovsky and colleagues [67] and implemented in the Datamonkey web server [68] was used to
identify TRIM5a codons under positive selection. REL
involves fitting a distribution of substitution rates across
sites and then inferring the rate for individual sites [67].
The REL method under the MG94xHKY85 model of
evolution was used. Normalized posterior mean of the
dN-dS difference and the Bayesian posterior probability
for positive selection (dN > dS) for each codon position
were obtained. A Bayes factor of greater than 50 suggests that a site is positively selected.
Estimation of leporid TRIM5a synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates, using the Nei-Gojobori
method [50], was performed on MEGA5 [69].
Sliding-window analysis

An alternative approach to determine nucleotide substitution rate variation among different genomic regions is
to plot differences as averages by sliding a window along
a sequence alignment [70]. A sliding-window analysis
was performed using DnaSP version 5.10 [71]. A window length of 90 nucleotides and a step size of 10 were

Page 10 of 12

chosen for this analysis. Nucleotide replacements per
site between European rabbit/European brown hare,
European rabbit/Iberian hare, European rabbit/brush
rabbit, European rabbit/American pika, human/chimpanzee and human/rhesus monkey TRIM5a were
analyzed.
