Results: Of the individual protein-protein interaction prediction methods, some can predict
physical interactions without producing other types of interactions. None of the methods can
specifically predict metabolic interactions. We have constructed an 'omics evidence landscape' that
combines all sources of evidence for protein interactions from various types of omics data for
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We explore this evidence landscape to identify areas with either only
metabolic or only physical interactions, allowing us to specifically predict the nature of new
interactions in these areas. We combine the datasets in ways that examine the whole evidence
landscape and not only the highest scoring protein pairs in both datasets and find specific
predictions.

Background: In the post-genomic era various functional genomics, proteomics and computational
techniques have been developed to elucidate the protein interaction network. While some of these
techniques are specific for a certain type of interaction, most predict a mixture of interactions.
Qualitative labels are essential for the molecular biologist to experimentally verify predicted
interactions.

assays [1,2] uncover direct physical interactions between proteins, whereas affinity purification [3,4] measures the tendency for proteins to be members of the same protein
complex, and micro-arrays [5] detect the concerted expression of genes at the mRNA level. Furthermore, functional
relationships are predicted from many other sources: genetic
interaction data [6], gene fusion, conserved gene neighborhood and gene co-occurrence [7-9], conserved co-expression
between species [10,11] or the sharing of transcription factors
[12]. Many of these high-throughput techniques to infer functional relationships produce noisy data. The noise level of the
data has lead to the development of bioinformatics data integration strategies to increase the reliability of the prediction
of functional coupling.
Despite the obvious success of these integrative approaches,
they remove from the raw data the information pertaining to
functional coupling that was measured in the original assay;
high quality generic gene networks have been inferred from
the integration of very heterogeneous data, such as synthetic
lethals, yeast-two-hybrid and mRNA derived co-expression
[13,14]. These networks contain many accurate predictions,
but specific information on the type of functional coupling is
lost. In addition to the loss of specificity from integration,
some techniques to measure interactions, such as co-expression, predict, even without integration, only generic functional couplings. This lack of specificity is a problem, because
for the biological interpretation of gene networks and the prioritization of experimental verification, we not only need to
identify protein interactions, but also to add qualitative labels
to the interactions [15]. We here present a bioinformatics
approach that distinguishes different types of functional coupling on the basis of their behavior across different highthroughput datasets. We study how well in silico predictions
and omics data serve to specifically predict a specific type of
interaction. Subsequently, we combine the information from
in silico predictions, functional genomics data and protein
interaction assays into evidence landscapes. In these landscapes we identify regions that are populated solely by physical or metabolic interactions, allowing specific prediction of
the nature of interactions between proteins.

Reference sets
We chose to analyze omics datasets for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae because of the availability of much
high quality genomics data as well as classical knowledge
about its protein functions. We compiled reference sets that
are specific for a category of interactions. Although a myriad
of functional couplings exist, we here begin by defining two
categories that are themselves widely used in data integration
studies (Figure 1). Our first and most straightforward category is a physical interaction that is mediated by physical
proximity (red lines connecting proteins in Figure 1). A subclass of this category is co-complex membership, which is well
defined and for which trustworthy and large reference sets
are available, in contrast to direct pairwise physical interac-

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R197

tions. We thus used known complexes from the MIPS database as a basis for physical interactions. Care was taken to
remove potential circularity in the form of those entries in the
MIPS database that are explicitly based on the large-scale
protein complex purification data. This resulted in 14,988
positives and 884,224 negatives for pairwise interactions.
Co-pathway membership is another common functional relationship that is frequently used [13,14] and which we chose as
our second category. Metabolic interactions, in which proteins are part of the same metabolic pathway, are the clearest
exponent of these pathway interactions for which clear cut
databases of sufficient size are available. No high-throughput
method exists that exclusively detects pathway or metabolic
interactions, even though certain methods detect them
among other functional relationships. As a basis for metabolic interactions we took only those KEGG maps that represent metabolic pathways (that is, with map number below
2000); obviously, metabolic pathways contain multimeric
enzyme complexes, but we did not score the intra-complex
interaction of these as positives or as negatives in our metabolic reference. We did, however, consider the links between
these enzymes and other enzymes from the pathway as metabolic (Figure 1). This resulted in 18,460 positives and 275,768
negatives.

Score-intervals and positive predictive value
We chose to measure the performance based on score intervals as opposed to thresholds to measure prediction performance. Widely used measures, such as false negative rate or
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves divide predictions into positives (higher than a threshold) and negatives
(lower than a threshold) and then score true and false predictions. Thus, they rely heavily on the assumption that interactions that score higher than a certain threshold are the true
interactions. A performance measure based on score intervals
does not rely on such assumptions. In contrast, it can identify
score intervals with high predictive performance anywhere
along a scoring axis and is better suited for integration of data
types with different noise levels [14]. A performance measure
that combines well with a score interval based scheme is the
positive predictive value (ppv). As the predictions are not
divided into positive and negative, there are no true and false
negative rates. Just like the likelihood ratio in Bayesian networks [14], the ppv depends only on positive predictions
without implying that all the other predictions are negative.
Figure 2 reflects that indeed some of the evidence types show
a high ppv for metabolic interactions at intermediate scores
whereas this ppv drops at higher score intervals, which would
not have been observed by a threshold based performance
measure.
To determine whether there are omics evidence type data that
alone are typical for either of the two categories, we cannot
simply plot the prediction performance for each reference set
independently. We have to take into account true and false

Two categories of functional relationships
Two categories of functional relationships. The two categories of functional relationships that we use in this study are physical interactions (specifically cocomplex memberships) and metabolic interactions. The physical interactions (red) exist between proteins that are identified in the same protein complex,
whereas the metabolic interactions (blue) exist between proteins that act in the same metabolic pathway. Metabolic interactions may also exist between
individual members of a complex and proteins that act in the same pathway as this complex. One aspect of the nature of these to functional relationships
is the physical distance between proteins as illustrated in the graph. As the nature of the relationships differs, one might expect differential behavior in
high-throughput experiments.

metabolic interactions as false physical interactions and vice
versa. The ppv of metabolic interactions is calculated as the
total number of true metabolic interactions divided by the
sum of the true and false metabolic and the true and false
physical interactions. The ppv of physical interactions is then
calculated as the total number of true physical interactions
divided by the sum of the true and false metabolic and the
true and false physical interactions. By doing this, we can
determine not only whether at a certain score in a certain
dataset proteins are likely to interact, but also how they
interact.

Results
Qualitative information from individual omics datasets
We calculated the ppv for each omics evidence type and each
score interval. Figure 2 shows at what score each evidence
type successfully predicts either metabolic or physical interactions. The ppv for physical interaction (ppv phys) increases
similarly to the ppv for metabolic interactions (ppv meta) for
gene co-expression (CoExp), as well as for combinations of
gene co-expression between species (CoExp2Sp, CoExp4Sp)
and the combination of gene co-expression with shared transcription factor binding sites (ChIP-chipCoExp) (Figure 2).
These data are, therefore, not specific for either metabolic or
physical interactions. In contrast, for gene neighborhood

landscapes where the differential ppv is either higher than
0.95 or lower than 0.95. We predicted novel metabolic and

What we have observed in Figure 2 is that intermediate scores
in correlated phylogenetic profiles and gene neighborhood
conservation are often indicative of metabolic interactions.
The evidence landscape of these two has specific metabolic
interactions in intermediate scores of both sets (Figure 3g).
Thus, not only do we find purely metabolic interactions from
gene pairs that score null in protein-protein interaction datasets, we also find them in overlaps with intermediate scoring
parts of other evidence types.

Normally, logistic regression provides the best fitting function between a dependent variable and a set of independent
variables. In this case the variables are clearly not independent, as can be readily observed in a correlation matrix (Additional data file 1). There are also huge differences in
coefficients between fitted functions on the separate variables
and fitted functions on multiple variables at the same time
(data not shown). Therefore, a simple logistic regression, for
example, as applied in [16], is not permitted by these data.
Moreover, the interval score-ppv plots show that the probabilities of interactions do not always follow a logistic curve. An
exploration of the combinations of scores of the different
input data is more suitable. We call the combinations of omics
data 'evidence landscapes', surfaces on which the x and y
coordinates represent the scores of two types of 'omics' data.
In these areas we plot the specificity for either metabolic or
physical interactions, estimated by the differential ppv. The
differential ppv is computed by subtracting the physical interaction ppv from the metabolic interaction ppv. This means

Figure 3 shows the differential ppv in a representative selection of these evidence landscapes. The comprehensive collection of all evidence landscapes is available at our webpage
[17]. Figure 3a shows the evidence landscape of the two TAPtag protein-protein interaction datasets [3,4]. Despite the
very high quality of both datasets, they are not completely
comprehensive; each dataset identifies interactions with a
high SA score [3] between proteins that in the other assay
were never co-purified, but which are true interactions in the
physical interaction reference set. An SA score of 5 (bin 0.4)
in only one of the two assays is not enough to predict a reliable
physical interaction; however, if the protein pair has an SA
score of 5 in both sets, it is a reliable prediction. So in fact the
two assays complement each other. That is why we used the
sum of the two SA scores for the evidence landscapes with
other 'omics' sets (Figure 3b, c); in these panels, bin 0.2 contains all protein pairs that were purified in both assays but
never co-purified. Gene pairs with high orthologous conserved co-expression (CoExp2Sp) that were never co-purified
are purely metabolic interactions (the upper left corner of
Figure 3b). We also observe this for co-regulated gene pairs
(ChIP-chip, Figure 3c). Indeed, we are now able to predict
purely metabolic interactions by taking gene pairs that have a
null score in the physical interaction set and a positive score
for co-expression or co-regulation. Gene-pairs that are null
scoring in the complex purification datasets and have an
intermediate score in gene neighborhood or correlated phylogenetic profiles also define purely metabolic interactions.

reports

Qualitative information from evidence landscapes

that if a region scores equally well in both reference sets (be it
very poor or very well), it has a zero differential ppv, reflecting
the inability of this region to differentiate between metabolic
and physical interactions. However, if it is very accurate in
predicting metabolic relations but unable to accurately predict physical interactions, it has a very high differential ppv
and, vice versa, a very negative value reflects specificity for
physical interactions. Thus, the differential ppv is a tool to
judge whether areas exist that specifically predict either type
of interaction.

reviews

To get statistical support for these visually observed trends,
we employed logistic regression where the binary dependent
variable is the presence/absence of an interaction and the
continuous variables are the scores from the omics data
(Table 1). For all measures of co-expression, the logistic
regression co-efficients are positive and significant for both
physical and metabolic interactions. The logistic regression
coefficients for GenNeigh and CoOccur for the metabolic
interactions are not very high due to the probabilities of metabolic interactions not following a logistic curve. Finally, we
observe specificity for physical interactions not only in datasets where physical interaction was measured directly (yeasttwo-hybrid and protein complex purifications), but surprisingly, also in one that contains a number of shared genetic
interactions between proteins (GenInt). With regard to the
socio-affinity (SA) score based on the protein complex purifications of Gavin et al. [3] and Krogan et al. [4], it was
expected that a high score in either of these sets would be
indicative of a physical interaction. Similarly, the logistic
regression coefficient is very high, while for these datasets the
regression coefficient for metabolic interactions is not significant. In conclusion, we can specifically pinpoint physical
interactions based on single 'omics' datasets, both from visual
inspection of the score-ppv plots as well as from the results of
the logistic regression.

van Noort et al. R197.5

comment

(GenNeigh) the ppv depends on the score: very high is specific
for physical interactions whereas a lower, but still significant,
score is indicative of a metabolic interaction (Figure 2, GenNeigh). The highest ppv meta in this set is 0.79, at a point
where the ppv phys is 0.05, whereas the highest ppv phys is
0.73 when the ppv meta is 0.11. Therefore, GenNeigh can be
used to obtain some specificity about the type of predicted
interaction. Correlated phylogenetic profiles (CoOccur) show
a similar, but less pronounced, trend of differential ppv.

tions are generally more open to biological interpretation
than long lists of potential interactions. It is directly clear
from the network layout that physical interactions are more
clustered than metabolic interactions. The clustering coefficient (fraction of indirectly connected proteins that are also
directly connected) of physical interactions (0.53) is much
higher than the clustering coefficient of metabolic interactions (0.031). The incompleteness of the metabolic network

Network with qualitative labels on predicted interactions. (a) The network of interactions in yeast that are specifically predicted to be physical (red lines)
or metabolic (blue lines). We took all gene pairs that fell into squares (Figure 3) with a differential ppv larger than 0.95 and at least five true positive
metabolic interactions for the specific metabolic interactions. We selected all gene pairs that fell into squares with differential ppv smaller than -0.95 and at
least five true positive physical interactions for the specific physical interactions. Names of several known complexes and metabolic pathways are indicated
on the network. (b) The arginine biosynthesis pathway in yeast. Names of the enzymes are in orange, arrows indicate biochemical reactions. Blue lines
indicate all interactions that exist for these genes. Note that ECM40 catalyzes two steps in this pathway but the interactions with the other genes are

interactions

As an extension to this work we would like to specifically predict more than only two types of interactions. One type of
interaction that we can not predict is a kinase-target interaction; the prediction of these kinds of interactions is a field on
its own and requires integration of many more types of prediction methods and data, such as sequence data [23].
Furthermore, for the type of method we use here it is neces-

refereed research

It is of course tempting to combine more than two types of
omics data. There are, however, two reasons why we here
explore pairs of evidence types rather than the multidimensional evidence landscape given by all evidence types simultaneously. Firstly, visual inspection of differential ppv plots is
still possible in two dimensions but becomes more troublesome in higher dimensions. Secondly, and more importantly,
overlapping all evidence types at the same time results in very
small numbers of protein pairs in each multidimensional volume in the reference sets, which in turn hampers the reliable
calculation of prediction ppv.

deposited research

Another contribution in distinguishing metabolic from physical interactions comes from differential rates of evolution.
We could not obtain the same level of differential ppv for the
prediction of metabolic interactions in landscapes with the
conserved co-expression set of Stuart and co-workers [11] as
we did with a two-species orthologous conserved co-expression [10] because the first predicts mainly physical interac-

One striking observation is that we predict many more physical interactions than metabolic interactions. This difference
might be easily explained by the fact that there are specific
experimental methods to find physical interactions and no
specific methods to find metabolic interactions. Even the
shared genetic interactions, which we previously thought to
be indicative of co-pathway membership, turn out to correlate
mostly with physical protein interactions. Only co-expression
data and the in silico prediction methods contain metabolic
interactions mixed with physical interactions, making it hard
to specifically extract metabolic interactions from omics data.
Ultimately, it might even be the nature of metabolic interactions themselves that makes them less amendable to prediction: metabolic interactions are, by nature, indirect, and only
in the case of linear pathways do the enzymes involved have
the kind of mutual dependence that proteins in the same
complex have, which might explain why the former leave a
less strong signal in the genomics data than the latter. A
weaker type of interaction between enzymes in the same
pathway is also suggested by our observation that metabolic
interactions are prevalent at intermediate degrees of gene
order conservation or correlation between phylogenetic profiles while high levels of gene order conservation correlate
with physical interactions.

reports

It is perhaps logical in hindsight that we detect metabolic
interactions in areas where both proteomic approaches report
no co-purification while there are strong indications for coregulation, but there are some important implications. We
should use not only integrations based on the top scoring proteins but also non-scoring proteins. For the co-purification
data this implies that the absence of a reported interaction is
in fact the reflection of a cellular reality: in other words, we
need physical protein interaction datasets where the negatives are really true negatives rather than the absence of
results. Although the comparison of the Gavin et al. [3] and
Krogan et al. [4] co-purification data reveals that both datasets still harbor some false negatives, a combined dataset of
both comes close to having the perfect properties for our
objective, and it is only since the publication of these data that
a differential genomics approach as proposed here has
become possible.

tions. As the conserved co-expression set of Stuart et al. is
based on four species and the other one on only two, we speculate that metabolic interactions are less conserved in evolution than physical interactions, which is consistent with
results on the evolutionary modularity of metabolic pathways
and protein complexes in biological systems [22]. The higher
rate of evolution of metabolic interactions also explains that a
very high level of conservation of gene neighborhood conservation or correlation of phylogenetic profiles indicates a physical interaction whereas intermediate levels are more
indicative of metabolic interactions.

Discussion

comment

Several metabolic pathways are completely retrieved, such as
the arginine and the threonine biosynthesis pathways, which
are connected only by predicted metabolic interactions (blue
lines). The arginine biosynthesis pathway is depicted in Figure 4b. We find many known physical protein complexes as
clusters densely connected by red lines, as has been previously shown in many integrative bioinformatics studies [1821]. Interestingly, we now also observe the pathway interactions that exist between them. For example, in the upper right
corner is the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Members of
the same complex have red lines (physical interactions)
between them, whereas members of different complexes have
blue lines (metabolic interactions) between them. Even
though we derived the metabolic pathway interactions by
identifying the regions in the landscapes that scored highly in
a metabolic reference set, we still expect this class in addition
to be general for other functional associations from other
types of cellular pathways. Therefore, the blue lines between,
for example, the exosome and the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex, are not necessarily metabolic as in the case
of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, but rather other
types of functional associations in which a substrate is passed
on from one protein to another. Likewise, the oxidative stress
cluster contains interactions between thioredoxin reductases
and glutaredoxins. These proteins are, as far as is known, not
part of the same pathway in the sense that they pass, for
example, reducing equivalents to each other, but they are part
of the same system.

sary to have reference sets that are of high quality and at the
same time cover many protein pairs. For transient physical
interactions, such reference sets are not available at the
moment, although they might become available in the near
future.
Protein relations predicted by our computational integration
should be less laborious to experimentally test, because they
prioritize the usability of various assays for biochemical verification. For example, it would be disingenuous to verify our
metabolic relations by CoIP. In general, we expect that novel
ways of integration and the advent of more and more types of
omics data will allow the further development of approaches
to increase the specificity and to extract more qualitative data
on the nature of protein interactions.

Conclusion

al. Protein pairs that were never found together in a purification but were purified at least once were given a score of zero.
As a third set we took the sum of SA scores of all protein pairs
occurring in both protein-protein interaction datasets.
Scored yeast-two-hybrid interactions were obtained from the
STRING database [24].

In silico predictions
In silico predictions of functional interactions were obtained
from the STRING database [24]. From this database we took
the co-occurrence scores based on phylogenetic profiles of
COGs and gene neighborhood conservation also based on
COGs. The scores were transferred from pairs of COGs to
pairs of S. cerevisiae genes. If more than three yeast genes
belonged to the same COG, the score was considered ambiguous and was removed from the dataset.

Conserved co-expression

When predicting interactions between genes it is essential to
specify the type of interaction that is predicted to allow biological interpretation. Some data types are already specific for
the type of interaction, for example, ChIP-on-chip data of
transcription factors is indicative of regulatory interactions
and co-purifications are specific for physical interactions.
However, co-regulation, correlated expression, shared
genetic interactions and in silico interactions are not intrinsically specific to any type of interaction. Here we have shown
that although some datasets do contain a high level of metabolic interactions at intermediate scores, it is not possible to
reliably predict metabolic interactions from them. However,
by combining the datasets in ways that examine the whole
evidence landscape and not only the highest scoring protein
pairs in both datasets we can find specific predictions; for
example, by taking protein pairs whose co-expression is evolutionarily conserved but that never co-purify in two comprehensive protein-protein interaction datasets, we can label
these predicted interaction as metabolic interactions. This is
a first step towards improved biological interpretation of gene
networks generated from the integration of high throughput
data.

We used two multi-species conserved co-expression datasets;
co-expression conservation between human, yeast, fly and
worm [11] and between yeast and worm [10]. We also used coexpression conservation between pairs of paralogs [10] in
yeast. For the two-species conservation we took the
maximum expression correlation of all pairs of orthologs and
averaged this maximum with the expression correlation of
the gene pair itself. For paralogous conservation we took the
maximum expression correlation between all parallel duplicated gene pairs and averaged this maximum with the expression correlation of the gene pair itself.

Co-regulation
Co-regulation was assessed by combining correlated mRNA
expression profiles with similarity in bound regulators to the
gene promoter. Rick Young's lab made a comprehensive survey of the gene regulatory network in yeast [25]. We took a
cut-off of 0.01 for binding of a transcription factor to a promoter based on the raw ChIP-on-chip data and divided the
number of shared transcription factors between two genes Ni,
j by the geometric average of the total number of transcription
factors bound by each of the two genes T resulting in a co-regulation score Sij:

We downloaded the yeast protein complex purifications published by Gavin and co-workers [3] and recalculated the SA
scores that reflect the likelihood of interaction to include also
proteins that were purified only once. Protein pairs that weree
never co-purified but were both purified at least once received
a SA score of zero. We also downloaded the protein complex
purifications of Krogan and co-workers [4]. These authors
produced a different interaction score per protein pair, which
was optimized to overlap with protein complexes from the
MIPS database. To have a reference set-independent score we
calculated SA scores based on the purifications of Krogan et

Gene pairs that share a promoter were excluded. To increase
the reliability of the co-regulation signal, we multiplied the
correlation in binding profile by the correlation in mRNA
expression profile based on a large-scale expression dataset
in yeast [11], that is:
Snew ij = rij × Sij
where rij is the expression correlation of gene i and j.

0 and 1, such that high scores correspond to more likely interactions. All other scores were rescaled to scores between 0
and 1 by a linear transformation. In the score-ppv plots for
each set we calculated ppv based on intervals with bin width
0.025. In the evidence landscape plots, we plotted two datasets against each other in a heat map-like fashion and color
squares according to their differential ppv (see below).
Squares were made with sides of 0.05; if a square contained
fewer than two true positives, a larger square with sides 0.1
was made to avoid high performance scores based on very few
examples.

ppv phys = TP phys/(TP meta + FP meta + TP phys + FP
phys)
ppv diff = ppv meta - ppv phys
Differential ppv is computed by subtracting the ppv phys
from ppv meta. This means that if a region scores equally well
in both reference sets (be it very poor or very well), it has a
zero differential ppv, reflecting the inability of this region to
differentiate between metabolic and physical interactions.
However, if it is very accurate in predicting metabolic relations but unable to accurately predict physical interactions, it
has a very high differential ppv and, vice versa, a very negative
value reflects specificity for physical interactions.

deposited research

From the KEGG database [29] we took all metabolic maps
with indices smaller than 2,000. Maps with higher index are
not metabolic and contain other processes, including many
that consist of a single protein complex. Positive examples are
all protein pairs that co-occur on a metabolic map, and negative examples are all protein pairs that do not co-occur on a
metabolic map but are, nevertheless, present in the metabolic
maps of KEGG. In order to not have any physical interactions
in our metabolic reference set, we removed all protein pairs
with the same EC number and removed all protein pairs that
are part of the same complex according to SGD/GO annotation [30,31] or MIPS. Together, the positive and negative
examples form the metabolic interaction reference set.

Physical interaction ppv (ppv phys) was calculated as the
number of true positives of the physical interaction reference
set divided by the number of true positives plus false positives
of both reference set sets in that bin (Table 2). Metabolic
interaction ppv (ppv meta) was calculated as the number of
true positives of the metabolic interaction reference set
divided by the number of true positives plus false positives of
both reference sets in that bin. In order to score for how well
a given region/square bin in the evidence landscape predicts
either type of interaction, we computed what we here call the
differential ppv (ppv diff).

reports

We downloaded known complexes from MIPS [28] and
removed all categories containing the terms 'other' or 'predicted'. Removal of the predicted category was especially
acute, because these contain complexes derived from purified
complexes identified by mass-spectrometry from earlier
high-throughout publications from the same groups that produced the Krogan et al. and the Gavin et al. datasets. We took
complexes at the lowest level of definition. Protein pairs that
are in the same complex are positive examples, and protein
pairs that are in different complexes are negative examples.
The positive and negative examples constitute the physical
interaction reference set.

Reference sets

comment

A set of synthetic lethal and synthetic sick interactions were
downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database
[26]. It was found earlier that genetic interactions [6] on their
own are only marginally useful for predicting direct interactions, but shared genetic interactions do indicate involvement
in similar pathways [27]. We corrected the number of shared
genetic interactions Ni, j by the geometric average of total
interactions T per protein, exactly the same as for the co-regulation score.
