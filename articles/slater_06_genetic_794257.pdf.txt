Abstract
Background: Vps25p is the product of yeast gene VPS25 and is found in an endosomal sorting
complex required for transport (ESCRT)-II, along with Vps22p and Vps36p. This complex is
essential for sorting of ubiquitinated biosynthetic and endosomal cargoes into endosomes.
Results: We found that VPS25 is a highly conserved and widely expressed eukaryotic gene, with
single orthologs in chromalveolate, excavate, amoebozoan, plant, fungal and metazoan species. Two
paralogs were found in Trichomonas vaginalis. An ortholog was strikingly absent from the
Encephalitozoon cuniculi genome. Intron positions were analyzed in VPS25 from 36 species. We
found evidence for five ancestral VPS25 introns, intron loss, and single instances of intron gain (a
Paramecium species) and intron slippage (Theileria species). Processed pseudogenes were identified
in four mammalian genomes, with a notable absence in the mouse genome. Two retropseudogenes
were found in the chimpanzee genome, one more recently inserted, and one evolving from a
common primate ancestor. The amino acid sequences of 119 Vps25 orthologs are aligned,
compared with the known secondary structure of yeast Vps25p, and used to carry out phylogenetic
analysis. Residues in two amino-terminal PPXY motifs (motif I and II), involved in dimerization of
Vps25p and interaction with Vps22p and Vps36p, were closely, but not absolutely conserved.
Specifically, motif I was absent in Vps25 homologs of chromalveolates, euglenozoa, and
diplomonads. A highly conserved carboxy-terminal lysine was identified, which suggests Vps25 is
ubiquitinated. Arginine-83 of yeast Vps25p involved in Vps22p interaction was highly, but not
absolutely, conserved. Human tissue expression analysis showed universal expression.
Conclusion: We have identified 119 orthologs of yeast Vps25p. Expression of mammalian VPS25
in a wide range of tissues, and the presence in a broad range of eukaryotic species, indicates a basic
role in eukaryotic cell function. Intron splice site positions were highly conserved across all major
eukaryotic species, suggesting an ancestral origin. Amino acid sequence analysis showed the
consensus for the amino-terminal proline-rich motifs is P- [WP]-X-[YF] for motif I (when present)
and P-P-[FYL]-[FY] for motif II, and that Vps25 may be ubiquitinated.

Background
The endosomal pathway of eukaryotic cells receives both
biosynthetic cargo from the trans-Golgi network and

endocytic cargo from the cell surface [1,2]. Many cargo
proteins are further sorted into the internal vesicles that
are a prominent morphological characteristic of the late

endosome/multivesicular body (MVB) [3,4]. After fusion
of MVBs with lysosomes, or the vacuole (which is the
equivalent compartment in yeast), the internal vesicles
and their contents are degraded. Sorting into MVB lumenal vesicles is a crucial process in determining whether a
membrane-associated protein is degraded or recycled. In
mammalian cells, MVB sorting is essential for the downregulation of activated cell surface receptors, such as the
epidermal growth factor receptor, and defective sorting is
strongly associated with carcinogenesis [5].
Many of the components of the cellular machinery
required for endosomal sorting have now been identified.
In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (hereafter
referred to as 'yeast'), three complexes known as ESCRT-I
(endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I),
ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III, have been shown to be essential
for sorting of ubiquitinated cargo [6-9] into lumenal vesicles of endosomes and/or their formation [6,10,11].
ESCRT-I initiates sorting into endosomal lumenal vesicles
by binding ubiquitinated membrane proteins. ESCRT-II,
composed of Vps22p (also known as Snf8p), Vps25p and
Vps36p [9,12,13], functions downstream of ESCRT-I, and
regulates the formation of ESCRT-III [9]. Mammalian
equivalents of ESCRT-II components have also been
found, known as Eap30 (Vps22p homolog), Eap20
(Vps25), and Eap45 (Vps36) [14,15]. The ESCRT complexes are conserved in mammalian cells [4], and ESCRTI and -III have been found essential for the budding of a
wide range of viruses, including HIV-1 [16-19].
The crystal structure of yeast ESCRT-II has recently been
solved [12,13]. The complex has a trilobed 'Y'-shaped
topology and consists of two copies of Vps25p, forming
two protrusions, and one each of Vps22p and Vps36p,
which form the third protrusion. While two copies of
Vps25 are required to form the complex, the two Vps25p
subunits make no direct contact with each other, with one
Vps25p subunit binds Vps22p and the other Vps36p. The
most extensive interactions within ESCRT-II are between
Vps22p and Vps36p. However, as Vps25p binds both
Vps22p and Vps36p, it may facilitate assembly of ESCRTII. Although these data revealed that yeast Vps25p has a
dual "winged helix" structure and two PPXY motifs
[12,13,20], Vps25p has no obvious functional motifs [9].
We aimed to characterize the Vps25 family of proteins
across the species, to find out more about its genetic structure and evolution, and to identify conserved residues and
motifs that may have relevance to the function of this protein. VPS25 is a good choice for evolutionary studies for a
number of reasons. First, the coding region is a compact
size, with single expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence
reads often covering the full coding region, meaning data
can be garnered from a large range of species. Second, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/59

genomic sequence of VPS25 in many major eukaryotic
groups contain introns, which enables analyses of intron
evolution. Thirdly, the range of proteins used for eukaryote-wide evolutionary studies have, to date, been quite
restricted and included very few trafficking proteins [2123]. Evolutionary analyses of more proteins involved in
subcellular trafficking will ensure evolutionary data are
more representative. Finally, we identify VPS25 genes in a
wide variety of organisms many with known medical,
agricultural, and economic importance, which will aid
insights into its function in these organisms.
No studies have previously reported on the phylogenetic
relationship and evolutionary history of the Vps25 family.
To deduce evolutionary constraints on, and changes in,
Vps25 primary structure, we use comparative genomics
methods involving computer programs that line up multiple sequences and look for regions of similarity among
them. A family tree of the Vps25 family was created and
evolutionary history examined further by analysing the
structure of mapped genes, revealing a highly conserved
intron-exon organization. Finally, the expression profile
of mammalian Vps25 genes was determined.
Our study is of further importance for a number of reasons. First, the mammalian MVB sorting machinery
appears overall to be more complex than that of yeast,
with the human genome expressing several homologs of
several of the yeast ESCRT components [24]. In order to
examine the function of mammalian ESCRT-II subunits, it
is therefore necessary to identify all members of each subunit family, determine how similar they are in both
sequence and expression to the yeast proteins, and trace
their evolutionary history. For example, if paralogs exist,
functionality may not be conserved for each protein. This
is particularly relevant for ESCRT-II subunits because, by
contrast to the endosomal function of yeast ESCRT-II [9],
mammalian ESCRT-II was originally identified as a having
a nuclear location [14,15]. This suggests that mammalian
Vps25 homologs (and other ESCRT-II subunits) could
have a different functionality. Secondly, there is a precedent for significant structural reorganization of the Vps36
ESCRT-II subunit through evolution. Vps36 proteins of
higher species lacks the NZF ubiquitin-binding motif
found in yeast Vps36p [25], and have an alternative ubiquitin-binding motif, GLUE [26]. Therefore it is necessary
to look for alterations in other ESCRT-II subunits, such as
Vps25. Finally, the greater relevance of the recent structural data is entirely dependent on the conservation of
crucial residues of Vps25p in other Vps25 family members. Our study has determined which residues and motifs
are conserved within the Vps25 family. Of great interest is
an absolutely conserved lysine residue, which considering
the role in ESCRT-II in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins, suggests Vps25 may be ubiquitinated. Our data have

further demonstrated that mammalian Vps25 proteins are
true orthologs of yeast Vps25p and are therefore predicted
to have conserved function. Expression profiling of
human Vps25 showed expression in a wide variety of tissue types. Overall, these results are consistent with a conserved and fundamental role of Vps25 in organisms other
than yeast.

Results
Identification of Vps25p orthologs
The VPS25 gene product of yeast has predicted orthologs
in both the rat (Eap20) and human (HsVps25) genomes
[14,15,17,18] and twenty eight correctly annotated
orthologs are found listed on the Pfam database [27]
under accession number PF05871. The PF05871 family
consensus is referred to as the DUF852 domain on the
Conserved Domain Database (CDD) nomenclature
[28,29]. To characterize the Vps25 family, we used Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and keyword
searches of a wide range of databases to identify sequences
homologous to yeast and human Vps25. Reciprocal
searches using each extracted protein confirmed that all
members of the Vps25 family currently on the database
were identified and that no false positives were included.
In total 119 full length orthologs were identified in a wide
range of eukaryotic species (Figure 1) [Additional Files 1,
2 and 18]. The species include representatives of all the
major eukaryotic groupings, with the exclusion of the
Rhizaria, for which only a very limited amount of
sequence data is currently available. Vps25 orthologs were
absent from the 'completed' genomes of Plasmodium falciparum and Encephalitozoon cuniculi, although a possible
partial homolog may be present in Plasmodium species
[Additional File 1]. A further 48 partial Vps25 orthologs
were also identified [Additional Files 3 and 4]. The coding
region of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus,
and Bos taurus VPS25 begins with two ATGs separated by
a triplet encoding a single amino acid. By comparison to
other Vps25 proteins, the first ATG appears most likely to
be used. The nucleotide sequence surrounding the first
ATG is also closer to that of a Kozak consensus [30]. Pairwise BLASTP E-values indicate the similarity within the
Vps25 family members and were used to compare members of the Vps25 family (Table 1). Significant pair-wise
similarity for a given Vps25 protein was found always to
be limited to a subset of the most closely related
sequences, and no Vps25 ortholog showed significant Evalues (of less than 10) when it was compared to all other
Vps25 orthologs. These similarities are best represented in
phylogenetic analysis (see below).

The length, predicted pI and molecular masses of the
Vps25 orthologs were calculated (Table 1). Vps25 family
members are of similar size and vary in predicted mass
from 19.5 kDa (Yarrowia lipolytica) to 26.4 kDa (Copri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/59

nus cinereus) with an average of 21.8 kDa. The vast majority of proteins (93 of the 119 full length orthologs) have
an acidic pI (Table 1). The pI of all other orthologs is
between 7.1 and 8.4, with the striking exceptions of and
Neurospora crassa and Brassica napus with values of 8.7
and 9.4, respectively. It should be noted, however, that
predicted pI values do not always correlate with the exact
pI values of folded proteins. Acidic pIs can relate to protein function, and acidic amino acids within Vps25 may
form electrostatic interactions with the positively-charged
amino-terminus of binding partner Vps20, or mediate
interaction with an unknown charged nuclear protein(s).
Overall, the putative orthologs of Vps25 identified have a
similar length, amino acid sequence, pI, and domain
structure, compared to the yeast protein. To obtain a consensus sequence for the protein family, conservation of
amino acid sequences between members of the Vps25
family were analysed in detail by alignment using the
ClustalX program (Figure 1). Conservation was approximately equal over the entire alignment [Additional File
18]. Only three amino acids were totally conserved in
addition to the initiation methionine, although further
amino acids are conserved in the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of non-protist sequences. These analyses
indicate these Vps25 proteins form a well-conserved
eukaryotic protein family.
All three proteins contributing to the formation of ESCRTII in yeast (Vps22p, Vps25p, Vps36p) have two repeats of
a winged-helix (WH) domain, despite having no recognizable sequence similarity [12,13]. The WH domain has an
H1/B1/H2/H3/B2/B3 (H = helix; B = beta) topology
[Additional File 18] and is common in transcription factors [31]. We use Greek abbreviations in the first WH
domain of Vps25p (α = helix; β = beta) to distinguish it
from the second WH domain. The first WH domain of
yeast Vps25p has additional beta strands between β1 and
α1, known as β1' and β1" [13], and α2 is very short. Furthermore, a conserved arginine residue (Arg83), which
forms a salt link with a residue in Vps22p [12,13], is
found in a beta hairpin in the unliganded Vps25p structure [20]. Comparison of the amino acid alignment of the
Vps25 family with the known secondary structure of yeast
Vps25p [Additional File 18] indicates that the dual WH
domain structure of Vps25 is likely to be conserved
throughout the eukaryota. Regions of sequence predicted
to be disordered in the yeast Vps25 structure [12,13,20]
are regions in which the largest indels are found [Additional File 18]. Arg83 is highly, but not absolutely conserved, and is a lysine in a number of species. Strikingly,
the non-conventional β1' and β1" strands of the first WH
domain of Vps25p, are only predicted to be conserved in
a subset of fungi, predominantly the Saccharomycotina
[Additional File 18]. As their presence is atypical of WH

Comparison of Vps25 amino acid sequences
Comparison of Vps25 amino acid sequences. A multiple alignment of 119 Vps25 homologs was generated using ClustalX.
Only the amino-terminal region (top) and carboxy-terminal region (bottom) of an abridged number of species is presented
here. A full alignment of all known Vps25 homologs can be found in Additional File 18. Amino acid numbering is to the left of
aligned sequences. Consensus amino acid sequences (obtained from the alignment of Vps25 from all species) are found below
the alignment, where an uppercase letter represent the only completely conserved amino acid in the regions aligned [see Additional File 18]. Shading was done using Boxshade, where regions of greater than 50% conservation in the total alignment [Additional File 18] are shaded (identical amino acids are in black boxes and similar amino acids in gray boxes). Protein accession
numbers are found in Additional File 1. Gaps that were required for optimal alignment of the full length Vps25 homologs are
indicated by dashes. Standard single letter amino acid abbreviations are used. The secondary structure elements of yeast
Vps25p are provided beneath the alignment. The two 3/10 helices (η1 and η2) prior to the first winged helix (WH domain) and
the first alpha helix (α1) of WH-1 are in the aligned amino-terminal region, while helix (H2) and the final two beta strands (B2
and B3) of WH-2 are in the aligned carboxy-terminal region. An asterisk indicates the position of a highly conserved lysine residue close to the carboxy-terminus.

dThe BLASTP E-value (Expect value) measures the statistical significance threshold for protein sequence matches. The smaller the number the better the match. Computer shorthand nomenclature is used to
present E-values when values are small. For example, 5e-01 = 0.5 and 5e-04 = 0.0005.
eProteins were compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Paramecium primaurelia, Trypanosoma brucei, Dictystelium discoideum, or Arabidopsis thaliana Vps25p by BLASTP. The Vps25 proteins used
for comparison were chosen as the representive of fungal, metazoan, chromalveolate, excavate, amoebozoan, or plant species because these sequence are documented on the non-redundant protein
database and they are well-known eukaryotic species.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:59

domains, our analysis predicts that the WH domains of
most Vps25 proteins will have a more typical WH topology than that of yeast Vps25p.
The amino-terminal region of Vps25p, before the start of
the first WH, contains two proline-rich motifs (PRM),
PRM-I and PRM-II, which have the consensus PPXY in
yeast [12,13]. In one of the molecules of Vps25p in
ESCRT-II these mediate interactions with Vps22p, and in
the other molecule they interact with Vps36p. A phenylalanine (Phe10), immediately prior to PRM-II, lines a
hydrophobic pocket of either Vps22p or Vps36p [12,13]
and is also important for dimerization of unliganded
Vps25p [20]. The second proline of PRM-1, and both prolines of PRM-II, make hydrophobic interactions with
Vps22p and Vps36p, and the tyrosine residues are important for this interaction [12,13]. Our analysis of the PRM
region of the Vps25 family shows the most striking difference is the lack of conservation of PRM-I in chromalveolate,
diplomonad
and
kinetoplast
sequences
(corresponding to the first 3/10 helix in Figure 1), while
Paramecium primaurelia lacks both PRMs. While it is the
second proline in PRM-1 that is known to interact with
other ESCRT-II components, we unexpectedly find the
first proline in PRM-1 is more highly conserved than the
second proline. In metazoan species the amino acid corresponding to the second proline of yeast Vps25p PRM-1 is
invariably substituted with a tryptophan. The second proline of PRM-1 is not even well conserved among the fungi,
and is present in only 12 of the 33 fungal regions examined. The residue corresponding to Phe10, located
between PRM-I and PRM-II of yeast Vps25p, is highly conserved, and is retained in apicomplexan, diplomonad,
and parabasalid sequences. It is conservatively substituted
with tyrosine in all Plantae, and with another hydrophobic residue in kinetoplast species. It is unexpectedly
absent from two basidiomycete species, Coprinus cinereus
and Phanerochete chrysosporium, and Dictyostelium discoideum, which also lack the conserved tyrosine of the first
PRM. A few other fungal species also lack the tyrosine of
the first PRM.
In contrast to PRM-I, PRM-II is highly conserved across
the eukaryota. The most striking difference is that rather
that the PPXY consensus identified in yeast, we show the
consensus for PRM-II is PPXF. This is because the final
tyrosine (Tyr14) of yeast Vps25p is only conserved in 17
of the 119 family members aligned. In 97 of the 119
Vps25 proteins, this final PRM-II residue is a phenylalanine. In addition, rather than amino acid 13 being an
arbitrary amino acid, we show this position is also conserved across the Vps25 family, as is typically a phenylalanine, but a tyrosine in plants. PRM-2 can therefore be
more accurately defined as P-P-[FY]-[FY]. Finally, the four
amino acids after PRM-II are also highly conserved. These

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/59

are: an almost absolutely conserved threonine residue and
highly conserved leucine residue (Thr15, Leu16 using
yeast numbering), followed by the first absolutely conserved amino acid of the Vps25p family, a glutamine
(Gln17), and finally there is a further highly conserved
proline residue (Figure 1). Overall a consensus for the
expanded PRM-I and PRM-II region, conserved in most
Vps25 family members is: P-[PW]-X-[YF]-X-[FYL]-P-P[FYL]-[FY]-T-L-Q-P.
In addition to the absolutely conserved glutamine residue
in the proline-rich amino-terminal domain, mentioned
above, there are two further totally conserved residues
across the Vps25 family. These are a tryptophan in the first
alpha-helix of WH-1, and a threonine at the end of the
first beta-strand in WH-2 [Additional File 18]. The significance of these residues remains to be determined. An
additional, potentially exciting, finding from our amino
acid alignment of Vps25 family members is the presence
of a conserved lysine residue near the carboxy-terminus
(Figure 1). In the yeast Vps25 structure [20], this lies at the
end of a beta-strand (Figure 1). Given the role of ESCRT
complexes in sorting ubiquitinated cargo, and the proposed role of ubiquitination in regulating function of
other ESCRT proteins [6-9], this suggests that Vps25 proteins may have the ability to be ubiquitinated. Ciliate species were the only species lacking a lysine residue in the
carboxy-terminal region [Additional File 18]. Entamoeba
histolytica and the fungus Coprinus cinereus lack a lysine in
the conserved consensus, but rather have a lysine as the
final amino acid. The highly conserved lysine is typically
found in a G-V-K-F motif, with 98% of lysine residues
found in a [GA]-[VIL]-K-[FVI] consensus motif. Although
a consensus for ubiquitination has not been determined
[32], it is of interest that this motif is found in a number
of proteins involved in ubiquitin cascades. For example:
human RING-finger protein-31 (Q96EP0), two fungal
ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes (Q4WLA7 and
Q96UP5) and human deubiquitinating enzymes -33
(Q8TEY7) and -7 (Q93009).
To assess the evolutionary relatedness of the Vps25 proteins, a phylogenetic tree, based on the alignment of the
amino acid sequences of the Vps25 orthologs [Additional
File 5] was generated [Additional File 19]. A distancebased tree was constructed under minimum evolution criteria [34]. Bootstrap support for branching of many of the
more disparate sequences was low. This was attributed to
the lack of conservation in key areas, such as PRM-1 and
Phe-10 [Additional File 18]. At present, we cannot rule
out that at least some of these differences are due to
uncharacterized sequence and gene annotation errors.
Indeed, we have corrected errors in both protein and
nucleotide sequences when we have found them, including those in five of the Vps25 orthologs on the Pfam data-

base [see Additional Files 1, 3 and 12]. This makes an error
rate, even on the highly-curated protein databases, of
around one in every six sequences. Additional Figure 15
[Additional File 18] illustrates our current knowledge of
the evolutionary relationship between Vps25 proteins,
and shows homologs from protists, fungi, plants, and
metazoans clustering with each other.
Intron positions of VPS25 genes
To examine the evolutionary conservation of the structure
of VPS25 genes, exon-intron mapping was carried out
when genomic sequence was available via the genomic
databases. In many microbial eukaryotes the VPS25 gene
was encoded by a single exon: Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas
vaginalis, Leishmania sp., Trypanosoma sp., all the Saccharomycotina, some (Magnaporthe grisea, Neruospora crassa,
and Phaeosphaeria nodorum) but not all Pezizomycotina,
and one basidiomycete (Ustilago maydis). By contrast
VPS25 was found encoded by more than one exon in all
metazoan and plant genomes, where data were available.
Interestingly, introns were also found in the VPS25 gene
of some microbial eukaryotes: apicomplexans Theileria
annulata and T. parva; ciliate Paramecium primaurelia; ameobozoa Dictyostelium discoideum and Entamoeba histolytica;
and many fungi including Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
some Pezizomycotina (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. oryzae, Botryotinia fuckeliana, Coccidioides immitis, Gibberalla zeae,
Neosartorya fischeri, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Trichoderma
reesei, and Uncinocarpus reesii), some basidiomycetes
(Coprinus cinereus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium), and
the zygomycete Rhizopus oryzae.

The location and phases of intron positions were determined within the above genes (Table 2) and marked on a
multiple sequence alignment [Additional File 6]. Six
intron positions have been named 0–V, with intron I
being a phase 2 intron in all species except for the apicomplexans T. annulata and T. parva, where intron slippage is
proposed to have occurred, giving rise to a phase 0 intron
(see Discussion). Intron 0 was exclusive to ciliate P. primaurelia. By constrast, introns I–V were found in plants
and to varying extents in metazoan species. A common
evolutionary origin of VPS25 genes was substantiated by
conservation of introns I–V.
Chromosomal localization of VPS25 genes
Human VPS25 localizes to chromosome 17, map position
17q21.31, mouse Vps25 localizes to chromosome 11,
map position 11D (60.0 cM), rat Vps25 to chromosome
10, map position 10q32.1, and Caenorhabditis elegans
Vps25 to chromosome I (map position +14.60 cM). The
known chromosomal allocations of all VPS25 orthologs
are listed in Additional File 1. Further analysis of the chromosomal context of the spliced Vps25 genes revealed that
the human, rat, mouse, dog and cow are found in synte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/59

nous regions [Additional Files 7, 8, 9]. These five Vps25
genes are found downstream to the gene encoding Ramp2
(receptor [calcitonin] activity modifying proteins 2) and
upstream to the Prkwnk4 gene encoding the Wnk4 kinase
(With no lysine [K] 4), all in head-to-tail positions on the
positive strand. The partial sequence of the VPS25
ortholog in Pan troglodytes on chromosome 17 is also in a
region syntenic to that of human VPS25 [Additional File
7].
While only part of the genomic sequence corresponding
to zebrafish and chicken Vps25 mRNAs are currently
known, these sequences localize to chromosomes 1 and
27, respectively [Additional File 1]. Our analysis of the
surrounding genes [35] indicates synteny between
chicken, but not zebrafish Vps25 regions, and mammalian Vps25 regions (data not shown). No synteny was
found between the Vps25 genomic regions of Anopheles
gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans [Additional File 10] or plants [Additional File 11], and the
mammalian Vps25 regions.
Searches of the Pfam and NR databases reveal some Vps25
sequences that were suggestive of longer splice variants of
Vps25, some involving RNA splicing of VPS25 with portions of the upstream or downstream genes, and others
involving alternative start codons [Additional File 12]. We
found no evidence for the expression of longer splice variants of human or mouse Vps25 [Additional File 13]. Furthermore, these variants are not evolutionarily conserved,
together suggesting these are not biologically relevant.
VPS25 pseudogenes and paralogs
In addition to the excavate species, Trichomonas vaginalis
which has two VPS25 paralogs [Additional File 1], we
identified six VPS25 pseudogenes [Additional Files 14 and
15]. Ciliate Paramecium primaurelia P-protein, which we
identify as a Vps25 ortholog, has previously been
described as having a non-processed pseudogene in a >15
kb duplicated genomic region [36]. We found no further
non-processed pseudogenes.

Processed pseudogenes were found exclusively in mammalian genomes [Additional File 14], however, no pseudogenes were found in the completed Rattus norvegicus or
Mus musculus genomes.
Of the mammalian species, single processed pseudogenes,
lacking introns, were found in the genomes of Echinops telfairi, Homo sapiens (chromosome map position 1p12),
and Monodelphis domestica [Additional File 14]. Two processed pseudogenes were found in the Pan trogdolytes
genome (chromosome 1 and chromosome 2A). The
nucleotide sequence of mammalian VPS25 pseudogenes
was compared to that of the orthologous VPS25 sequence

[Additional file 16] and this enabled us to confirm the
pseudogenes were Type 1 pseudogenes, rather than paralogs, by a number of further criteria [37]. Confirmation of
Type 1 pseudogenes was due to: (i) each sharing a high
sequence similarity with the corresponding VPS25
ortholog, with BLAST E-value of less than 1e-10 (when
this could be calculated), considered typical for a pseudogene; (ii) sequence alignment with the VPS25 ortholog
not containing gaps longer than 60 bp; (iii) the alignment
covers >70% of the coding sequence; and (iv) the
sequence contains frame disruptions. The mammalian
VPS25 pseudogenes are retropseudogenes, as they do not
contain any introns, indicating they were inserted into the
genome by the retrotransposition of the mRNA of the
VPS25 ortholog [38]. This also means that they are
released from selective pressure, which results in the characteristic mutations. For example, the single frameshift
error in the H. sapiens pseudogene is located where intron
I is found in the VPS25 ortholog [Additional Files 6 and
16].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/59

each was found to have a comparable substitution(s) in
Vps25 from another specie(s) [Additional File 18]. We
conclude on the basis of sequence conservation that both
paralogs are likely to be functional. Nonetheless, we do
not know whether both genes are translated and therefore
cannot rule out mutations in non-coding sequences,
which would indicate one of these is a pseudogene.
Expression of mammalian VPS25
To determine the levels of expression of human VPS25 in
different cell types, we screened a human multiple tissue
cDNA panel. A strongly positive PCR product was
detected after 30 cycles in cDNA derived from kidney,
liver, pancreas, and placenta, with weaker products resulting from heart and skeletal muscle (Figure 2). After 38
cycles, expression of HsVPS25 mRNA was also detected in
brain and lung. No smaller splice variants were detected.
These results suggest that VPS25 is a universally expressed
gene with a fundamental cellular role.

In P. troglodytes pseudogene-1 (PS-1), frameshift errors are
localized to where intron I and intron V are found in the
VPS25 ortholog [Additional File 16]. The chromosomal
region of P. troglodytes ps-1 is similar to the region of chromosome 1 where the H. sapiens pseudogene is found, as
PS-1 is located adjacent to the alpha-1,2-mannosidase
gene, which is next to immune costimulatory protein B7–
H4 [Additional File 17]. By contrast, P. troglodytes PS-2, is
localized to a region of chromosome 2A with no similarity
to the location of the human pseudogene. While PS-2
lacks all introns, indicating retrotransposition, it contains
no frameshift or stop mutations, suggesting a more recent
evolution than that of PS-1.
The parabasalid Trichomonas vaginalis is unique as it has
two VPS25 paralogs [Additional File 1]. Both are fulllength homologs with no frame-shift mutations or inframe stop codons [Additional File 18]. The paralogs differ by 10 amino acids, which are found at the amino-terminus of the longer T. vaginalis-1 protein. The protein
products are 72% similar (30% identical) and have both
predicted secondary structure (data not shown), and
motif, conservation with Vps25 from other species [Additional File 18]. For example, the carboxy-terminal lysine
and two amino-terminal PRMs are highly conserved in
both paralogs. The phenylalanine immediately preceding
PRM-II in yeast Vps25p is important for Vps25 dimerization and partner binding, and is conserved in T. vaginalis
paralog-2. However, in paralog-1 this residue is a tyrosine.
This change probably does not negate function, as a tyrosine substitution is typically found in plant Vps25 proteins [Additional File 18]. Likewise, non-conservative
substitutions were found in a few highly conserved residues outside PRM-II, typically in paralog-1. However,

Discussion
Vps25p is a component of yeast endosomal sorting complex, ESCRT-II, essential for sorting ubiquitinated cargoes
into endosomes [9,12,13]. When we initiated this study
Pfam curated only eight Vps25 orthologs, while version
19.0 now contains 28 correctly annotated orthologs. We
identified a total of 119 full-length orthologs, and a further 48 partial sequences, from a wide range of eukaryotic
species. Vps25 orthologs are common to chromalveolates,
excavates, amoebozoa, red and green algae, land plants,
fungi, nematodes, echinoderms, platyhelminthes, arthropods, urochordata, fish, birds, amphibians, and mammals. While further curation and sequencing of gaps
within Plasmodium genomes may result in the identification of Vps25 orthologs, the gene was strikingly absent
from the complete microsporidian genome of Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Microsporidian genomes are strikingly compact, and this is due to a reduction in both gene size and
number [38]. Homologs of genes involved in protein trafficking are the plasma membrane, endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus have been identified
in E. cuniculi, but these appear restricted to those involved
in basic functions. A lack of a Vps25 ortholog in this obligate intracellular parasite is therefore unsurprising, and is
predicted to be one of the genes lost during reductive
microsporidian evolution.
The human gene product is a predicted 178 amino acid
protein with a pI of 6 and the human VPS25 gene localized to chromosome position 17q21.31, a region syntenous to positions in chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, and
cow. In addition to synteny between mammalian VPS25
gene regions, chicken VPS25 also appeared in a region
syntenous to mammalian VPS25, however, that of
zebrafish Vps25 did not. Extensive conservation of synteny
has been found previously between mammals and
chicken [40]. Many regions of synteny are also known to
be conserved between the zebrafish and human genomes
[41], however our data suggests that this does not include
the VPS25 locus.
The Vps25 family members identified have a similar
length, amino acid sequence, pI, and overall domain
structure, supportive of the hypothesis these proteins are
orthologous. Comparison of the amino acid alignment of
the Vps25 family with the known secondary structure of
yeast Vps25p, indicates that the dual WH domain structure is likely to be conserved throughout the eukaryota. A
common evolutionary origin of the Vps25 proteins was
further confirmed by conservation of many of the intron
positions within VPS25 genes. Intron positions were interspersed between the secondary structure domains of the
tandem WH domains. Introns I–III localized to the first
WH domain; intron I after the two 3/10 helices containing
the PRMs, intron II after the first alpha helix, and intron

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/59

III after the third alpha helix. Intron IV and V were localized to the second WH domain, with intron IV near the
end of the first helix, and intron V between helix-2 and
helix-3.
Our general knowledge of the patterns of intron gain and
loss is still limited [42,43], but two main theories about
the evolutionary origin of introns have been proposed.
The first, the Introns Early (IE) theory, proposes that
introns were present in a common ancestor of prokaryotes
and eukaryotes, while the Introns Late (IL) theory proposes that introns arose in the first eukaryotes. One of the
earliest pieces of evidence for the IE theory was the finding
that several intron positions of the triose phosphate isomerase gene were conserved between vertebrates and
plants [44,45], indicating introns pre-dated the plant-animal divergence. More recently, a large-scale comparison
of intron positions among animal, plant, and fungal
genes by Fedorov and coworkers indicated that around
10% of all animal introns have matches in plant gene
homologs and around 7% of animal introns match fungal
introns [46], providing further evidence for ancestral
introns pre-dating the animal-plant-fungal split and contradicting any theory based on random intron insertion.
Fedorov and coworkers also found that ancestral introns
(those common to animals, plants, and fungi) were not
restricted to phase zero [46].
Our analyses of intron positions in VPS25 orthologs have
identified five intron positions (introns I–V) common to
animals, plants, and fungi. Parallel insertion into 'preferred' sequence sites [46], as expected by the IL theory,
would be highly unlikely to explain this finding. Intron
phases in VPS25 genes were not restricted to phase 0, as
intron I was phase 2, and introns II, II, and V in phase 1.
Introns I and II were also conserved in two chromalveolate (Theileria annulata and T. parva) and amoebozoan
species (Entamoeba histolytica, and Dicytostelium discoideum), while intron V was conserved in the chromalveolate, Paramecium primaurelia. Conservation of these
introns indicates that they were present in an ancient
VPS25 gene existing before divergence of chromalveolates, amoebozoa, plants, and animals, an event occurring
around 1,000,000,000 years ago [47-49]. Our data therefore provide strong support for the IE theory of intron evolution.
A list of animal and plant gene matches with the highest
number of common intron positions has been published,
with two genes identified with 11 common introns and a
further ten genes with 6–9 introns in common [46]. Fifteen genes had five introns in common. All these genes,
with high numbers of common intron positions, all had
further additional introns unique to either the plant or
animal gene. We can now add VPS25 to the list of genes

Page 13 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:59

with high levels of commmon plant/animal introns, and
show it is the first such plant/animal gene match to exclusively have only common intron positions.
Although we found introns I–V conserved in fungi, no
fungal gene had all five introns present, and many fungal
VPS25 genes lack introns completely. Nematodes lack
intron IV, and arthropods (hexapoda) lack introns III and
IV. Of the hexapoda, bee (Order Hymenoptera) VPS25
retains intron II, while it is absent from fly (Order Diptera) VPS25 genes, suggesting loss of intron II after fly
divergence. VPS25 from both amoebozoan species examined (Entamoeba histolytica and Dictyostelium discoideum)
was characterized by a lack of introns II–V (suggesting loss
of these three introns before divergence), while D. discoideum also lacked intron I, suggesting loss after divergence
from E. histolytica. Two mechanisms have been proposed
for intron loss: reverse transcription and genomic deletion
[50]. We propose VPS25 genes lacking any of introns I–V
is because of intron loss over evolutionary time. For example, loss of intron II may have occurred after the divergence of Diptera from Hymenoptera, as it is present in bee
VPS25, but not in the two fly species (Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura) characterized. Our findings
therefore support the hypothesis that intronless and nearintronless eukaryotic genes are due to large-scale intron
loss.
Intron I of Theileria species appears to have undergone
intron slippage, when compared to the position in amoebozoan, fungal, or metazoan genes, as the intron site falls
within the proposed 12 bp limit for intron displacement
[51]. The intron slippage event has also led to a phase
change. True intron sliding is rare [52-54], but this is not
the first example of a phase change by a sliding event
being accommodated in a functional gene [55]. Several
mechanisms have been proposed for intron sliding
[56,57]. However, we cannot rule out an alternative scenario where this altered intron position was caused by an
intron loss followed by a gain.
A single convincing instance of intron gain was found in
the VPS25 gene of Paramecium primaurelia. P. primaurelia
retains ancient intron V, but compared to all other VPS25
genes, has a novel intron, designated intron 0, and in
phase 2. This is the same phase as intron I of other VPS25
family genes, but is too far from the intron I site to be considered a slipped intron. At present, we lack information
to determine whether this novel intron is conserved in
VPS25 genes of other ciliates. To date, our studies of the
VPS25 family have therefore revealed five ancient introns,
evidence for intron loss, an example of intron slippage,
and a single example of intron gain. Conservation of
intron positions also is supportive that the proteins we
have characterized are orthologous.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/59

The Trichomonas vaginalis genome was the only species
with evidence for Vps25 paralogs, and it had two copies of
the gene. Neither gene contained mutations in the coding
region affecting translation, although we cannot rule out
non-coding mutations. Both genes lacked introns, but as
processed pseudogenes have only been observed in metazoans and flowering plants [58], we assume the paralogous gene was formed by duplication rather than reverse
transcription. T. vaginalis encodes a large number of Rab
genes, many of these represent novel subfamilies [59].
This indicates trichomonads have a highly complex
endomembrane system and provide a precedent for functional retention of additional copies of genes involved in
protein trafficking in this species.
While a non-processed pseudogene has previously been
reported for the Paramecium primaurelia P-protein [36],
which we identify here as a Vps25 ortholog, processed
pseudogenes of VPS25 have not been reported previously.
We identify processed pseudogenes in four mammalian
species: a single pseudogene in Homo sapiens, Echinops telfairi, Monodelphis domestica, and two in the Pan troglodytes
genome, PS-1 and PS-2. Our data supports the hypothesis
that the second P. troglodytes pseudogene has only recently
evolved. First, while P. troglodytes ps-1 is inserted into a
similar chromosomal context to the human pseudogene,
PS-2 is found on a different chromosome in a region with
no similarity to that of the human pseudogene. Secondly,
in contrast to PS-1, PS-2 contains no frameshift or stop
mutations, suggesting less elapsed evolutionary time. The
lack of a corresponding PS-2 in the human genome suggests either its loss or its independent evolution after
divergence of humans and chimpanzees around 5 million
years ago. Sequencing of further primate genomes will
help determine the origin or loss of P. troglodytes PS-2. The
lack of a Vps25 pseudogene in rodent genomes may indicate that the deletion of the pseudogene after divergence
from primates around 75 million years ago. There is evidence that pseudogene deletions occur more rapidly in
mouse, as compared to human [60] and approximately
60% of retropseudogenes in human and mouse genes are
lineage specific [37]. Ongoing mapping of the E. telfairi
and M. domestica genomes may assist us in elucidating
when the mammalian pseudogenes arose.
Yeast Vps25p, as well as the other ESCRT-II components,
share a common tertiary structure, of tandem WH
domains [12,13]. WH domains have a H1/B1/H2/H3/B2/
B3 topology, where the three helices of each of the WH
domains assemble beneath a small beta sheet formed by
the three antiparallel beta strands. Comparison of the
amino acid alignment of all Vps25 family members with
the known secondary structure of yeast Vps25p reveals
that all Vps25 orthologs are predicted to have a tandem
WH structure, suggesting a common structure and func-

tion. Yeast Vps25 has additional beta strands between the
B1 and H1 of the first WH domain. These additional
strands are not conserved, indicating a more conventional
WH-1 domain for most Vps25 proteins.
Our comprehensive sequence alignment of the Vps25
protein family revealed three absolutely conserved amino
acids including one glutamine and a tryptophan in the
amino-terminal portion. The conserved glutamine residue
(glutamine-17 of yeast Vps25p) was shown experimentally to be important for interaction of Vps25p with either
Vps22p or Vps36p [12,13]. By contrast, the role of tryptophan-30 remains to be determined. Yeast arginine-83,
also necessary for Vps25p to bind Vps22p or Vps36p [12],
and was found to be highly conserved. Also within the
amino-terminal region of Vps25 are two PPXY motifs
(motif I and II) [13]. These motifs are involved in dimerization of unliganded Vps25p and interact with Vps22p
and Vps36p [13,20]. Motif I was absent in chromalveolate, diplomonad and kinetoplast sequences, and both
motifs were absent from Paramecium primaurelia Vps25.
The significance of these absences is not known, but we
are currently examining the conservation of other ESCRTII components in these species. Of those species with both
proline-rich motifs, the general consensus can now be
modified to: P-[WP]-X-[YF] for motif I and P-P-[FYL]-[FY]
for motif II.
Basic residues potentially implicated in nucleic acid recognition are found at positions arginine-23 and lysine-99 in
the amino-terminal half of yeast Vps25p [20]. We find
these are only moderately conserved. Our analysis also
reveals two further moderately conserved basic residues in
the carboxy-terminal half of Vps25, arginine-126 and
arginine-183, which are exposed on the surface of yeast
Vps25p [20]. Any role of these residues for a nuclear role
of Vps25 will need to be examined experimentally in the
future. Residues in the carboxy-terminal half of yeast
Vps25p, the region known to be involved in interaction
with ESCRT-III component Vps20p [61], have yet to be
examined by mutagenesis or crystallography. Wernimont
and Weissenhorn [20] suggest that tyrosine-152, glutamate-153 (at the start of WH2 helix 2) and glutamate-170
(at the start of WH2 helix 3) may be involved in yeast
Vps20p interaction, due to their accessibility. Our analysis
shows that glutamate-170 is not well conserved and is
only present in Vps25 from 38 of 119 species. It is surprisingly well-conserved in higher animals, but not in other
fungal species, while in plants it is typically an arginine
residue. Glutamate-153 is more highly conserved and is
found in Vps25 of 110 of the 119 species examined, and
of those 9 species without glutamate-153, 4 have conservative substitutions of aspartate residues. Those species
without highly conserved glutamate-153 were: the three
alveolate species (T. annulata, T. parva, P. primaurelia), the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/59

entamoeba E. histolytica, and one plant species (Brassica
napus). Tyrosine-152, like glutamate-170 was not conserved in plants, where it was typically a glutamate residue. In non-plant species, however, tyrosine-152 was
relatively well conserved, being found in 77 of 94 (over
80%) Vps25 sequences. These analyses suggest that plant
ESCRT-II interactions, particularly, may differ from those
of yeast.
We further found a highly conserved lysine residue near
the carboxy-terminal end of Vps25 proteins in short betastrand [20]. In the unliganded yeast Vps25p structure, the
conserved lysine is surface exposed [20], suggesting a
functional rather than structural role. It is found within a
conserved G-V-K-F consensus sequence. We suggest, on
the basis of: (i) the previously identified role of ubiquitination in the ESCRT cascade; (ii) the surface position of
the amino acid; (iii) high conservation of the residue; and
(iv) the presence of a similar motif in known ubiquitinbinding proteins, that Vps25 proteins may be ubiquitinated on lysine-200 (yeast Vps25p numbering), and we
are currently examining experimentally.
VPS25 was found expressed in a broad number of human
tissues with no indication of the use of alternative terminators or alternative splicing. Expression of mammalian
VPS25 in a wide range of tissues suggests a generic, but
important cellular function(s). Mammalian ESCRT-II was
originally identified as a having a nuclear role [14,15],
whereas that of yeast has an established endosomal function [9]. As we have provided evidence that Vps25 family
members are orthologs, related by speciation events, family members are likely to have conserved function. Bu contrast, if multiple human homologs of yeast Vps25 existed,
as occurs for other ESCRT components [24], functionality
may differ for each protein. Our data therefore imply that
mammalian ESCRT-II will additionally have a function in
endosomal sorting, analogous to that of yeast. Indeed,
two recent papers have found that, under certain circumstances at least, mammalian Vps25 can be found localizing to endosomal structures [62,63]. Conversely, our data
imply that yeast Vps25p may also have a nuclear role, in
addition to its well-characterised function in endocytic
sorting. Supporting this hypothesis, another yeast ESCRTII component, Vps36p, is thought to have a nuclear role in
regulating mRNA synthesis and/or stability [15,22]. Interestingly, many other class E Vps protein homologs in
mammals have also been found in the nucleus as well as
the cytosol and endosomal membranes, including
Tsg101, Chmp1 (human Vps46a) and Chmp3 (rat Vps24)
[64-67]. Further work on the functions of ESCRT-II proteins should provide valuable insights into the relationship between the transcriptional regulatory and
endosomal trafficking pathways.

Conclusion
We have identified a large number of Vps25 family members but suggest that gene loss has occurred in the microsporidian genome. We show that mammalian Vps25 is
orthologous to yeast Vps25p and is therefore expected to
have an endosomal as well as nuclear function. We
detected widespread tissue expression of human VPS25,
indicating Vps25 performs pivotal role(s) within eukaryotic cells. Synteny was found between VPS25 chromosomal
regions in mammals and chicken, but not mammals and
fish. The VPS25 gene family possesses many evolutionarily conserved intron sites, supportive of an ancestral origin. Evidence of intron loss, intron slippage, and intron
gain were also identified. Retropseudogenes were found
in four mammalian species (human, chimpanzee, hedgehog, and opossum), but were absent from rodent
genomes. A recently evolved retropseudogene was identified, which was exclusive to the chimpanzee genome. We
have analyzed conserved residues within Vps25, which
has led us to redefine the consensus of the amino-terminal proline-rich motifs, and to hypothesize that Vps25 is
ubiquitinated. Comparison of evolutionarily conserved
residues over such a wide number of protein family members provides a valuable resource for studying Vps25 function in a large number of species.

Methods
Detection, analysis, and chromosome mapping of Vps25
family proteins
The Vps25p amino acid sequence of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae amino acid was used in BLAST searches, using
the BLASTP [68] and PSI-BLAST [69] programs, which
identified homologous sequences from the NR protein
database. Searches were also made of the EST and
genomic databases using the TBLASTN program. BLAST
searches, including genomic searches, were carried out at
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) [35]. Alternatively, specific searches were carried
out at the PEDANT web site [70], the JGI database at the
University of California [71], the Sanger Gene Database at
the Wellcome Trust Sanger Centre [72], the Cyanidioschyzon merolae genome project and Silkworm genome
databases at the University of Tokyo [73,74], the Fugu
Genome Project at the Institute of Molecular and Cellular
Biology, Singapore [75], the Protist EST Program at the
University of Montreal [76], and the Porphyra yezoensis EST
database at the Kazuza DNA Research Institute [77]. The
Pfam [27] database (release 19.0) was also searched using
the Vps25p amino acid sequence [78]. Diagrams of
genomic context were modified from data available via
the NCBI mapviewer, and ideograms were obtained from
the same website [35].

Alignments and protein analysis
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Multalin (version 5.4.1) [79] at the Network Protein Sequence Analysis
[80] web site [81]. EST sequences were translated using
the Translate Tool at ExPASy [82]. The ExPASy Compute
pI/Mw Tool [83] was used to calculate theoretical isoelectric points and molecular weights. Protein sequence alignments were generated with ClustalX (1.8) [84]. Aligned
sequences were edited manually where alignment was
poor, by comparison with BLASTP- and PSI-BLASTderived data. Boxshade version 3.21 was used to format
amino acid alignments [85].
Phylogeny
Aligned amino acid sequences [Additional File 18] were
used to construct phylogenetic trees. Gaps were removed
from the sequence alignment, as well as amino acids
flanking longer gaps, where the alignment was uncertain
[Additional Data File 5]. Distance tree estimates were then
generated under the minimum evolution critereon
[34,86] using MEGA 3.1 software [87]. The close-neighbour-interchange heuristic search algorithms for finding
the optimal tree under the minimum evolution criteria
were used, where a temporary neighbour-joining tree [88]
was generated for comparison [89], using dynamic criteria
[90]. The bootstrap method [91] was used as a statistical
test of the inferred phylogeny, and a majority-rule consensus unrooted tree generated. Branch lengths are not presented, as each branch with less than 50% statistical
significance was collapsed to provide emphasis to those
reliable portions of the tree. Use of maximum likelihood
or Bayesian methods did not result in further clarification
of branching [92-95].
Tissue expression
Human or mouse multiple tissue cDNA panels (Clontech) were probed using oligonucleotide primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were
analysed before saturation by taking samples after various
cycle times, to ensure that the relative abundance of target
in each tissue could be directly compared. The multiple
tissue panels had been normalised using the mRNA
expression levels of several housekeeping genes. PCR
products were run in parallel with DNA size markers (MBI
Fermentas) on 2% (w/v) agarose gels. The primers used to
amplify the HsVPS25 gene were located: (i) just after the
initiation codon, and (ii) in the 3'-untranslated region.
The sequences of the primers were: (i) 5'-gtttcgagtggccgtggcagtatcgcttcc-3' and (ii) 5'-ggaggtaagaagtaaagggagacaggtcc-3'. These primers would detect H. sapiens VPS25 and
produce a product of 547 bp. The primers would not
detect the predicted human VPS25 pseudogene.
