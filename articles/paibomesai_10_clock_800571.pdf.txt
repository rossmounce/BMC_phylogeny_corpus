Clock genes and their genomic distributions in
three species of salmonid fishes: Associations
with genes regulating sexual maturation and cell
cycling

Abstract
Background: Clock family genes encode transcription factors that regulate clock-controlled genes and thus
regulate many physiological mechanisms/processes in a circadian fashion. Clock1 duplicates and copies of Clock3
and NPAS2-like genes were partially characterized (genomic sequencing) and mapped using family-based indels/
SNPs in rainbow trout (RT)(Oncorhynchus mykiss), Arctic charr (AC)(Salvelinus alpinus), and Atlantic salmon (AS)
(Salmo salar) mapping panels.
Results: Clock1 duplicates mapped to linkage groups RT-8/-24, AC-16/-13 and AS-2/-18. Clock3/NPAS2-like genes
mapped to RT-9/-20, AC-20/-43, and AS-5. Most of these linkage group regions containing the Clock gene
duplicates were derived from the most recent 4R whole genome duplication event specific to the salmonids.
These linkage groups contain quantitative trait loci (QTL) for life history and growth traits (i.e., reproduction and cell
cycling). Comparative synteny analyses with other model teleost species reveal a high degree of conservation for
genes in these chromosomal regions suggesting that functionally related or co-regulated genes are clustered in
syntenic blocks. For example, anti-müllerian hormone (amh), regulating sexual maturation, and ornithine
decarboxylase antizymes (oaz1 and oaz2), regulating cell cycling, are contained within these syntenic blocks.
Conclusions: Synteny analyses indicate that regions homologous to major life-history QTL regions in salmonids
contain many candidate genes that are likely to influence reproduction and cell cycling. The order of these genes
is highly conserved across the vertebrate species examined, and as such, these genes may make up a functional
cluster of genes that are likely co-regulated. CLOCK, as a transcription factor, is found within this block and
therefore has the potential to cis-regulate the processes influenced by these genes. Additionally, clock-controlled
genes (CCGs) are located in other life-history QTL regions within salmonids suggesting that at least in part, transregulation of these QTL regions may also occur via Clock expression.

Background
Rhythms in reproductive development, physiology, and
behavior are found ubiquitously in organisms including
prokaryotes, plants, fungi, and animals. Life-history
events are temporally organized throughout the lifetime
of an organism, which suggests that there is a timekeeping mechanism that is regulating these events. Daily
biological rhythms (~24 hour cycle) are generated at the

activated orphan nuclear receptor proteins REV-ERBa
and RORA, inhibit and activate transcription of bmal1,
respectively, by binding to the retinoid orphan receptor
elements (RORE) in the promoter region of bmal1 (see
[1] for a review). Because so many processes display circadian rhythms, the clock genes have been targeted as
candidate genes with pleiotropic effects.
Disruption of circadian rhythm may have broad consequences at the molecular level, as previous studies indicate that 2% to 10% of all mammalian genes display
circadian oscillation [2,3]. The expression of some of
these genes is regulated by Clock exclusively, and these
genes are called clock-controlled genes (CCGs). Clock
encodes for a bHLH (basic-helix-loop-helix)-PAS
(Period-Arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocatorsingle minded) domain containing transcription factor
which activates the transcription of CCGs. CLOCK acts
as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to promote chromatin modifications in the promoter regions of these
genes [4], and these genes in turn influence many physiological mechanisms downstream.
Clock genes are of interest as candidate genes that
control life-history traits across different organisms
because their allelic variation has been associated with
reproductive traits in many organisms. For instance,
Drosophila males with loss-of function for Clk (Clock)
released less sperm than wild-types, thereby reducing
reproductive fitness [5]. In female mice (Mus musculus),
Clock mutations resulted in aberrant estrous cycles, subfertility [6], and higher pregnancy failure rates when
compared to wild-type mice [7]. In salmonids, the Clock
gene has been localized to genomic regions that influence reproductive events. Leder et al. [8] localized a
copy of the Clock gene to a quantitative trait locus
(QTL) region that explained 20% - 50% (dependent
upon parental contribution) of the variation in spawning
dates of female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
Also, O’Malley et al. [9] identified variant copies (alleles)
of the Clock gene that differed significantly in frequency
between fall vs. spring spawning Chinook salmon
(Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Because of the temporal
nature of processes such as folliculogenesis, estrous
cycles, and spermatogenesis, it is suggested that these
processes are regulated by the Clock genes.
Similar to Clock, anti-müllerian hormone (amh) (a
member of the transforming growth factor beta protein
super family) has purported effects on reproductive
events in mammals and various fish species. In rats,
AMH has been shown to inhibit cAMP activity and prevent or severely reduce follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH) activation of Cyp19a1, an aromatase responsible
for the conversion of androgens to estrogens [10]. In
mammals, amh expression in the testes causes the
regression of the Müllerian ducts, which are precursors

Page 2 of 21

of fallopian tubes and the uterus in the female reproductive system. Besides its role in sex determination
early in life, amh plays a role in both female and male
gonad development and maintenance [11,12]. The Müllerian ducts in females eventually lose sensitivity to
AMH and the ovarian granulosa cells express AMH
which inhibits the expression of Cyp19a1 and luteinizing
hormone (LH) receptors which in turn, negatively regulates folliculogenesis [13,14]. In males, amh activity prevents Leydig cell formation and steroidogenic enzyme
production therefore inhibiting testes development [14].
amh expression in Sertoli cells in immature testes was
also found to prevent spermatogenesis in mammals [15].
Sexual determination across the fishes is not solely
dependent on genetic factors and the role of genetics in
this process is not as clear as seen in mammals. amhlike genes have been described in some teleost species
including, Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) (BAB93107),
Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) (BAD37138),
zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo
salar) (AAU85130; AY722411; cluster TC149876 [16]).
Examination of the expression patterns of amh in zebrafish [17], Japanese flounder [18], and Japanese eel [19],
revealed sexually dimorphic expression patterns in juveniles as seen in mammals. In zebrafish, it was also
shown that amh expression was present in both undifferentiated testes and ovaries later in development similar to what is seen in mammals [17]. As in mammals,
Miura et al. [19] demonstrated that amh expression
inhibited spermatogenesis. Similarly, in Atlantic salmon,
amh levels appear to decrease rapidly at the onset of
sexual maturation [20], and gene expression levels have
also been reported to be several-fold higher in immature
Atlantic salmon with a dramatic decrease seen in fish
undergoing sexual maturation [21]. This evidence suggests that amh orthologs have similar roles across species. However, in contrast to this, amh expression was
not detected in adult Japanese flounder ovaries [18].
Also, no sexually dimorphic expression of amh was
observed in juvenile medaka (Oryzias latipes) [22]. In
fact, within the Sertoli cells of adult medaka testes, high
levels of amh expression were observed during spermatogenesis [22]. Although the function of AMH is less
clearly understood in fishes, it does appear that differential expression of this gene is associated with differentiated sexual states in fishes.
Any research that investigates the molecular architecture of traits in vertebrates should take into consideration the past duplication events in this lineage. In
humans (Homo sapiens) and mice, Clock and NPAS2 are
two known paralogs which are related by the 2R genome duplication event [23]. Zebrafish and fugu (Takifugu rubripes) are known to have three copies of the
Clock-family genes (Clock1, Clock3, NPAS2). Tetraodon

Paibomesai et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:215

(Tetraodon nigroviridis) has Clock1 and Clock3 genes,
while medaka and stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
have Clock1 and NPAS2 genes [23]. Clock1 and Clock3
are duplicates that resulted from the third round of
whole genome duplication that occurred within the rayfinned fish lineage prior to the radiation of the teleost
fishes (approximately 300 Mya = 3R hypothesis) [23].
An additional round of whole genome duplication (4R
hypothesis) occurred in the salmonid lineage approximately 25 to 100 Mya [24], therefore we expect that for
a single gene in most teleosts, gene duplicates may be
found in the salmonids. Homeologs, which are chromosomal segments that arose from the most recent whole
genome duplication events, have been previously identified in rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, and Arctic charr
(Salvelinus alpinus) [25,26]. Clock1 duplicates (homeologs) have also been identified in the Chinook salmon
genome [27], supporting the 4R hypothesis. However,
only singleton copies of amh have been identified in
human, mouse, zebrafish, medaka, stickleback and the
pufferfishes genomes, suggesting that there may be no
functional duplicates in tetrapods, or even the ray-finned
fishes. Currently, only a single amh copy has been identified in rainbow trout [28], however one may expect
there to be a second copy due to the 4R duplication
event.
This study details the findings on the genetic mapping
of Clock and amh gene copies in three species of salmonid fishes. It was predicted that if duplicates of the
Clock-family and amh genes occurred within these salmonid genomes then they should map to previously
identified homeologous regions. Also considering the
putative role of these genes in influencing life-history
traits it was predicted that they should be located in the
genomic regions where life-history quantitative trait loci
(QTL) have been found in salmonids. Therefore linkage
group locations were compared to previously identified
QTL for life-history traits, such as female spawning date,
maturation time, and developmental rate in rainbow
trout, Atlantic salmon, and Arctic charr. As anticipated,
Clock-family and amh gene copies were co-localized to
major life-history QTL regions in these salmonid fishes.
Duplicated Clock copies occurred within the same syntenic cluster as amh and comparative synteny analyses of
other genes upstream and downstream to this region
identified several other major genes that may be involved
in sexual reproduction and cell cycling. This suggests
that Clock genes may localize within a ‘reproductive controlling block’ in vertebrate genomes.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Clock genes

Analyses of partial Clock1 sequence data suggests that
duplicates exist in the rainbow trout (OmyClock1a and

Page 3 of 21

OmyClock1b) genome while only single copies were
identified in Arctic charr (SalClock1b) and Atlantic salmon (SsaClock1b) genomes. For OmyClock1a, 4 exons
were identified that were orthologous to Otsclock1a
exons 15 to 18 from the 3′ end. Sequencing data for five
exons similar to the 3′ end of DreClock1 was obtained
for SsaClock1b ranging from exons 14 to 18, and 6
exons for OmyClock1b and SalClock1b ranging from
exons 14 to 19 (Figure 1.). As seen in Chinook salmon
[27], distinct Clock1a and Clock1b sequence duplicates
are evident in the rainbow trout genome, however,
sequence data confirming independent Clock1a orthologs were not obtained from the Atlantic salmon and
Arctic charr genomes. Mapping data, however, indicates
that Clock1 duplicates do exist in Atlantic salmon and
Arctic charr (discussed later), suggesting that sequence
divergence between these two isoforms may be minimal
in these two species.
The nucleotide sequence of the Clock1 duplicates,
OmyClock1a and OmyClock1b, in rainbow trout were
64% identical. Coding sequences of OmyClock1a and
OmyClock1b shared 90% identity which was analogous
to what was seen for OtsClock1a and OtsClock1b comparisons (90%) [27]. The genomic Clock1b sequences
from all three salmonid species were compared, and
OmyClock1b, SalClock1b and SsaClock1b were approximately 97% similar to each other. The coding sequences
of OmyClock1b compared to ¬SsaClock1b and SalClock1b were greater than 98% identical. The pairwise
comparisons suggest that orthologous copies among
species are more similar to one another than the paralogous duplicates within species, suggesting a divergence
predating the speciation events within the lineage. Similar observations have been made for other gene duplicates in the salmonids [29,30].
The 64% identity between OmyClock1a and OmyClock1b was, however, unexpectedly low compared to
other paralogous genes examined in salmonids. For
example, duplicate genes coding for IGF and MYF share
96-97% identity [31]. The low similarity between the
rainbow trout Clock1 duplicates was due to a large
insert located in intron 15/16 which had the highest
BLASTN hit to intronic regions of Salmo salar HoxC
cluster (EU025714) with 91% identity (Figure 1). The
region of similarity within the Salmo salar HoxC cluster
was between Hox6Caa and Hox8Caa genes, which is
where Hox7Caa was lost and replaced with a transposon
[32]. The next highest hit to intron 15/16 was to the 3’
end of Salmo salar Ras-related putative protein rab-31
(BT058970) with 89% identity. Coincidentally, these
regions of rab-31 and HoxC share similarity to a Tc1like DNA transposon DTSsa5 (EF685958) (89%) (Additional File 1). The transposon-like sequence found in
OmyClock1a does not contain the inverted tandem

Atlantic salmon (Ssa), rainbow trout (Omy) and chinook salmon (Ots). Exons and introns are indicated by black and white boxes,
respectively. The length of the protein product in number of amino acids is indicated under exon 15 for CLOCK1B proteins, which is

repeats (ITRs) which is essential for recognition by the
transposase protein for excision to occur. If excision
does not occur, the transposable element may become a
permanent element that is inactive. When O’Malley and
Banks [27] compared the Chinook salmon Clock1 duplicates, Otsclock1a and Otsclock1b; they reported that
intron 15/16 contained a transferrin insert; however this
study was published prior to the annotation of the Tc1
transposons in Salmo salar by de Boer et al. [33].
A single NPAS2-like sequence from rainbow trout
(OmyNPAS2-like) showed similarity to the NPAS2 genes
in stickleback and zebrafish. OmyNPAS2-like spanned
exons 10 (76% identity) and 11 (84% identity) of the
stickleback NPAS2 gene. In zebrafish, the OmyNPAS2like sequence was similar to exons 11 (81% identity) and
12 (86% identity). Unfortunately, this sequence was not
included in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) because
it covered a portion of NPAS2 that was not homologous
to the partial salmonid Clock1 genes. Mapping results,

however, confirm that these sequences are not Clock1
orthologs (discussed later).
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the salmonid
Clock1a and Clock1b duplicates were most similar to
DreClock1 with 88% (Neighbour Joining: NJ) and 97%
(Maximum Parsimony: MP) bootstrap confidence. The
orthologs OmyClock1b, SsaClock1b, SalClock1b, and
Otsclock1b clustered together and orthologs OmyClock1a and Otsclock1a clustered together in both NJ
and MP trees (Figure 2A and 2B). Thus, the orthologs
within the salmonids were more similar than paralogs
(e.g. OmyClock1a clustered with Otsclock1a, not
OmyClock1b).
Protein alignments of the salmonid CLOCK1
sequences revealed that a polyglutamine motif region
(PolyQ) in exon 15 was present in all the orthologs and
that this region varied in length between duplicates and
across the species (Figure 3). SALCLOCK1B and SSACLOCK1B contained the highest number of glutamine

residues with a total of 63 in this region. OMYCLOCK1A contained 18 glutamine residues, whereas
OMYCLOCK1B contained 36 glutamine residues. Similar to what was found for rainbow trout, Chinook salmon OTSCLOCK1A and OTSCLOCK1B contained 20
and 41 glutamine residues, respectively [27]. Other taxa
show differences in the CLOCK PolyQ regions between
species and even within a species. For example, this
region varies in Drosophila species with glutamine
counts ranging from 25 to 33 residues [34] and in avian
species, like blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and bluethroats (Luscinia svecica), where glutamine counts vary
from 9 to 17 and 10 to 16, respectively [35].
Some species exhibit variable PolyQ tract lengths
according to latitudinal gradients. For example, within
species length variants were observed in blue tit and
Chinook salmon [35,36]. Most importantly, these PolyQ

length and latitudinal gradients appear to correlate with
breeding/spawning times. At higher latitudes, mean
PolyQ lengths were longer compared to lower latitudes
[35,36]. Differences in PolyQ lengths also occurred in
Chinook salmon that spawn at temporally distinct times
of year in the same river [9]. Interestingly, no variation
was found in the PolyQ region of OTSCLOCK1A [36].
In this current study, the presence of variable PolyQ
regions in CLOCK1B across the salmonids suggests that
this region may be a result of local adaptation to latitude affected ecological factors like photoperiod.
The presence of variable PolyQ regions in CLOCK1B
across the salmonids suggests that this region may be
important in altering circadian phenotype. PolyQ
lengths have been associated to fitness parameters in
other species. In a single blue tit population, Liedvogel
et al. [37] found evidence that short CLOCK PolyQ

regions were correlated with earlier breeding times for
females and shorter incubation periods for both males
and females. In terms of fitness, females that had shorter
PolyQ regions had a higher number of fledged offspring
[37]. Thus, Chinook salmon populations inhabiting
more northern latitudes may delay reproductive timing
in relation to seasonal photoperiodicity in order to enter
more favourable stream environmental conditions for
spawning. However, direct comparisons of spawn timing
events in female salmonids with different PolyQ tracts
still need to be examined to test this hypothesis.
Acute effects of PolyQ and 3’ Q-rich modulation on
circadian rhythms have also been observed. Deletion of
51 amino acids in the 3’ Q-rich region in mutant mice
has been associated with lengthening the circadian period up to 4 hours in homozygous mice and eventual
loss of rhythmicity over a few weeks in darkness
[38-40]. Thus, PolyQ and 3’ Q-rich variation appear to
be important component of transcription activation

[41-43]. Since the PolyQ domain is involved in transactivation, the domain size is thought to directly affect
the transcription of the target genes and thus phenotype [42].
Mapping of Clock and amh
Homologies and homeologies

In rainbow trout, Omyclock1a mapped to the central
region of linkage group RT-8 while OmyClock1b
mapped to the short arm of (i.e., RT-24p) (Figure 4).
amh mapped to linkage group RT-8 supporting previous
findings [28], while its putative paralogous copy was
localized to linkage group AC-13 in Arctic charr, which
is homologous to RT-24p arm in rainbow trout (Figures
5 &6). The mapping of Clock1 duplicates in rainbow
trout and putative amh paralog assignments provides
further evidence for homeologous affinities of RT-8 and
RT-24 [25,44]. Additional duplicated genes have been
mapped to these linkage groups including ornithine

decarboxylase antizymes (oaz1/i/ii) [45] and glutamine
synthetases (GS01/GS03) [46] (Figure 4). Although RT24 and RT-8 are the fourth and fifth largest chromosomes in rainbow trout, respectively, the homeologous
affinities of these linkage groups are largely unknown
[47]. The long arm of RT-24 shows homeologous affinities to the long arm of RT-23 based upon a single
duplicated SSR marker assignment (Omy27INRA) [48]
as well as a duplicated conserved non-coding element
(CNE1056-1058) [26].
The mapping of the OmyNPAS2 gene to the centromeric region of RT-9 (i.e., RT-9p arm) also supports
some intriguing evolutionary affinities between the RT8/9/24 chromosomal regions in rainbow trout (Figure
4). Centromeric regions of RT-24 and RT-9 share a
degree of putative homeology based upon the syntenic

mapping of a pair of duplicated markers
(Omy1231INRA and Omy1287INRA) [49]. Similarly,
homeology between the short arms of RT-8 and RT-9
also exists based upon the mapping of the duplicated
marker OMM1825 [49], a duplicated CNE (CNE12321235) [26], and duplicated copies of the oaz2 genes [45].
However, the homeologous segments between RT-8/9
appear to be more telomeric in location on the RT-9p
arm compared to those between RT-9/24.
A single copy of the OmyClock3/NPAS2-like gene was
mapped to the central cluster of markers on the RT-20
linkage group in a male rainbow trout (Figure 4). RT-20
shares homology with both arms of linkage group AS-28
and given that AS-19/28 are homeologous, this region
may also possess homology to linkage group arm AS19q [25]. For the RT-20 linkage group, homeologies are

only characterized extensively for the 14p/20q arm
duplications, although a pair of duplicated markers also
indicates that RT-14q may share a degree of homeology
to RT-25q. There is also evidence that a small region of
homeology may exist around the centromeric regions of
both RT-20 and RT-9 based upon the presence of up to
3 duplicated markers that have been genotyped in different mapping panels [25,50].
In Atlantic salmon, SsaClock1a and SsaClock1b
mapped to the AS-2qa region of AS-2 [51] and AS-18,
respectively (Figure 5). AS-18 represents an acrocentric
chromosome in Atlantic salmon, which shares homology
to only a single rainbow trout linkage group arm (i.e.,
RT-24p), and thus is not designated with respect to arm
regions in the species. AS-2, a fused acrocentric chromosome in Atlantic salmon, shares homology to two
rainbow trout linkage group arms (i.e., RT-8q in the
AS-2qa region proximal to the centromere, and RT-27q
in the more distal AS-2qb region [51]). SsaNPAS2
mapped to AS-5, and more specifically to the AS-5qb
region of the linkage group. AS-5 is also a fused acrocentric chromosome in Atlantic salmon, with the AS5qa region homologous to RT-22q, and the AS-5qb
region homologous to RT-9p [51]. Interestingly, while
the Clock1 duplicates in rainbow trout, along with
NPAS2 gene copy appear to fall into regions that may
possess a degree of ancestral homeology (based upon

the syntenic mapping of additional duplicated genetic
markers), the observed mapping locations for these
genes in Atlantic salmon is not supported by any additional duplicated marker information (however, see
below for discussion on ancestral homologies).
In Arctic charr, SalClock1a and SalClock1b were localized to linkage groups AC-16 and AC-13, respectively,
and SalClock3/NPAS2-like duplicates mapped to AC-20
and AC-43 (Figure 6). Similar to Atlantic salmon, there
are no known homeologies recognized between AC-13/
16, or AC-20/43. Current mapping data indicate that
segments of AC-13 may share homeology to AC-14 (1
marker) and AC-34 (9 markers), while a single duplicated marker supports potential homeology between
AC-16 and AC-27 [[52]; unpublished data]. AC-43 does
not share any duplicated markers with other linkage
groups in the Arctic charr genome, while AC-20,
appears to be a fused metacentric chromosome possessing chromosome arms that are homeologs to one
another [52]. These linkage group arms are homologous
to the RT-2q and RT-9q linkage group arms in the rainbow trout genome [25].
Homologous linkage group alignments between the
species indicate that AC-16 is homologous to the RT-8
linkage group. Given the tight clustering of markers on
RT-8 due to the lack of recombination in the female
mapping parents used to construct the rainbow trout

genetic linkage maps [53], the actual RT-8 arm assignments to AC-16 are difficult to determine. However,
within the cluster of markers on AC-16, two markers
(Ogo8UW and BX299451) are evident, and these are
located quite distally along the RT-8q chromosome arm
(see Figure 4). This would suggest that this rainbow
trout chromosome arm (i.e., RT-8q) shares homology to
AC-16, and this interpretation is also compatible to the
assignment of shared homology to the AS-2qa linkage
group arm.
The assessment of homology for the SalClock1b mapping location on AC-13 is even more difficult given the
fact that the linkage assignment is only based upon
male segregation data (See Figure 6). AC-13 appears to
be a metacentric chromosome in Arctic charr with the
AC-13p arm homologous to the RT-24p arm, and the
AC-13q arm homologous with RT-14p or RT-20q linkage group arms [25].
Since the mapping location of amh in Arctic charr is
clearly homologous to the RT-24p arm (Figures 4 and
6) in rainbow trout, and given the syntenic clustering of
Clock1 and amh on RT-8, it may be inferred that the
homology of the SalClock1b copy is to the RT-24p arm.

The differential localization of amh copies to RT-8 and
AC-13 indicates that duplicates of this gene may still
exist in both rainbow trout and Arctic charr on the RT24p, and AC-16 linkage groups, respectively. Alternatively, following the 4R duplication of these genes, one
of the two duplicated copies may have been differentially silenced within the respective alternate homeologous linkage group arms of either species.
Mapping of the duplicated SalClock3/NPAS2-like
copies to AC-20/43 is particularly intriguing, given the
fact that these linkage group regions have distinct
homologies to separate linkage group arms in rainbow
trout and Atlantic salmon. AC-43 is homologous to the
RT-9p arm (Figures 4 and 6), and the AS-5qb (Figures 5
and 6) linkage group arms. Both of these linkage group
regions possess a copy of the NPAS2 gene, as previously
mentioned. Given that a more precise localization of
OmyClock3/NPAS2-like is not possible based upon the
male genotyping data obtained in this study, it is reasonable to assume that this gene maps to the RT-9p arm as
well, given that AC-43 and RT-9p share homology. If,
however, we consider that the duplicated copy of the
SalClock3/NPAS2-like gene maps to AC-20 (which share

Paibomesai et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:215
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/215

homology with only the RT-9q arm) then two copies of
these genes may in fact exist on the RT-9 linkage group
in rainbow trout (see below).
Affinities to ancestral Actinopterygian linkage groups

Comparative synteny analyses between the salmonids
and model fish species, such as zebrafish, stickleback
and medaka, can be used to determine the origin of
ancient genomic regions in fish species. These comparative genomic studies suggest that modern day ray-finned
fishes descended from an ancestral vertebrate lineage
that had 12-13 linkage groups (A-M) [54-56]. Using
information on the salmonid-specific linkage group arm
homologies to the ancient ancestral linkage group arm
origins [25], the duplicated Clock1 and amh copies in
the salmonid species have likely arisen from the M
ancestral lineage. Linkage group arms RT-8q; RT-24p;
AS-2qa and AS-18 all share homology to the M ancestral lineage.
BLASTN alignments of the OmyClock1b gene to the
medaka genome also indicate that there may be an unannotated Clock gene copy within Ol-4 at 1.755 Mb. The
Fgenesh-M analysis [57] suggests that this assignment
may be a pseudogene signature given that the alignment
blocks do not overlap any of the predicted exons within
the region. Regardless, this region would be considered
most similar to OmyClock1b, making Ol-4 the most
informative syntenic block for ancestral linkage group
assignments. Using this information, the association of
Ol-4 to ancestral lineage M is compatible with the major
ancestral assignments in the salmonids [25]. Ol-4 genes
also share a synteny block with the Clock copy on Dr-20
(spanning from the Clock gene at 21.381 Mb-23.259 Mb,
and homologous to the region from 0-1.733 Mb in
medaka), suggesting homology to the M lineage. The
Clock copy in sticklebacks (0.489 Mb on Ga-IX), however, shares greatest homology to a region on Dr-1 from
13.624-26.952 Mb, and to Ol-1 within the region from
14.996-15.785 Mb on this medaka chromosome. Clock3
in zebrafish is localized to Dr-1 at 18.849 Mb, while
Clock3 in medaka is localized to Ol-1 at 14.996 Mb.
Kasahara et al. [55] indicate that Ol-1 is derived from a
mosaic mixture of genes that derive from the E and F
ancestral lineages in fish indicating that Clock3 gene
copies likely have a different teleost-specific ancestral
chromosomal origin compared to the Clock1 copies. This
would then suggest that the region of Ga-IX possessing
Clock derives from a different origin than the Clock
copies on Dr-20 and Ol-4, and is in fact more similar to
Clock3 copies in zebrafish and medaka.
The single copy of OmyClock3 mapped to RT-20 in
rainbow trout is compatible with a hypothesis that this
Clock3 gene arose from the F ancestral lineage as
genetic markers possessing homology to both Ol-1/-18
are located on the RT-20q linkage group arms [25].

Page 10 of 21

However, the copy of SalClock3/NPAS2-like that is
located on AC-20, would suggest that homology to the
RT-9 linkage group may exist for two Clock gene
copies. AC-43 is homologous to RT-9p (SalClock3/
NPAS2-like/i location) while AC-20 (SalClock3/NPAS2like/ii) is homologous RT-9q. The copy on AC-43 is
likely NPAS2, as this matches the location of this gene
in rainbow trout. The copy on AC-20, may, however, be
representative of Clock3. While it is true that there is
extensive homology to the E ancestral grouping on the
RT-9q linkage group arm, there is also a small region of
homeology to the G lineage around the centromere
representative of duplicated markers between RT-9/20
(as previously mentioned).
In stickleback, the most likely OmyNPAS2 BLASTN
homology was to a pair of partial exons at 17.213 Mb
on Ga-VII while the NPAS2 gene has been assigned to
chromosome Ga-VII at 17.209 Mb. Interestingly, both
Ga-VII and Ga-IX appear to share extensive homeology
to one another throughout the proximal regions of both
linkage groups. The region designated as possessing
Clock on Ga-IX is not homologous to the ancestral M
lineage regions containing the salmonid Clock1a and
Clock1b copies. These regions are, however, homologous with the chromosome segments of Ol-18 and Dr-7
within Ga-VII, and with Ol-1 and Dr-1 within Ga-IX,
which clearly indicates their affinities to the F ancestral
lineage of teleost fishes [25,55,56]. This would indicate
that the “Clock-like” copy designated as NPAS2 on GaVII within the ENSEMBL 56 release is, in fact, a duplicate copy of Clock3, with the homeolog of this gene still
evident on Ga-IX.
BLASTN homologies of OmyNPAS2 within the
medaka genome are to chromosome Ol-14 at 17.143
Mb, and to Dr-5 at 20.844 Mb in zebrafish and both of
these regions are descended from the GH ancestral lineage [25]. The Ol-14 region possessing NPAS2 has extensive homology to Dr-21, while the Dr-5 region
containing NPAS2 has extensive homology to Ol-10
and -14. To highlight the similarity in these gene copies,
the first exon region (1-155 bp) of the OmyNPAS2 gene
also has extensive homology to the zebrafish Clock3
gene on Dr-1 (85.1% identity within 148 bp), and Clock1
copy on Dr20 (82.1% identity within 162 bp). In addition, the OmyNPAS2 sequence has a high degree of
homology to an unannotated sequence block (85.8%
identity for 148 bp) within Dr-15 between the genes
LOC568103 and kitb. Both kita and kitb genes are companion syntenic genes to the Clock genes among vertebrates. The copy on Dr-15 may be a functional NPAS2
copy based upon the Fgenesh-M analysis [57] that is
currently unannotated, and given the fact that major
chromosomal segments of Dr-10, -14, -15, and -21 are
derived from the GH lineage, it would suggest that the

Paibomesai et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:215
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/215

BLASTN alignment of the OmyNPAS2 gene on Dr-15
represents a 3R homeolog of NPAS2.
In summary, it can be stated that the Clock1 homeologs in rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon are all
derived from ancestral linkage group M. The genomic
regions surrounding NPAS2 are derived from ancestral
linkage group GH, and regions surrounding Clock3 are
derived from teleost ancestral linkage group F. At present, it is not possible to clearly assign the OmyClock3/
NPAS2-like copy on RT-20 to an origin either from the
GH or F lineages because homeologies exist both
between RT-9/20 (possible GH lineage) and RT-14/20
(possible F lineage).
By tracing ancient linkage groups GH and F even
further back in vertebrate evolution it is possible to
ascribe the origins of the proto-Actinopterygian linkage
groups to 10-13 putative proto-vertebrate linkage groups
(designated A’ - J’ or possibly A’ - M’) [56]. These linkage groups underwent two rounds of whole genome
duplications and extensive fusions prior to a further 3R
duplication in the teleost fishes. When these lineages
are configured within the 12-13 proto-Actinopterygian
linkage groups it is intriguing to note that almost all of
ancestral linkage groups G and F are derived from C’
lineage blocks (i.e., C1 and C2) [56]. Thus, the extensive
homology observed between the NPAS2 and Clock3
gene copies across the various teleost species compared
may not be that surprising given that they are likely
derived from multiple gene duplications from the same
ancestral gene. Additionally, two lineages of NPAS2
genes exist in vertebrates (a teleost-specific form and
Sarcopterygian form) with the teleost-specific form
more closely related to Clock3 and Clock1 vertebrate
genes [see data for family TF324568 in: http://www.treefam.org]. This suggests differential silencing and retention of paralogous copies of the NPAS2 gene following
either the 1R or 2R duplication events in the vertebrate
lineages. The extensive overlap of inferred homeologies
seen within rainbow trout in the current study for the
NPAS2 and Clock3 copies is also consistent with these
observed phylogenetic affinities.
Co-localization of Clock and amh with life-history and
growth QTL

In this current study, OmyClock1a and amh were localized in the central cluster of markers with zero recombination on RT-8 including OmyFGT12TUF,
OMM1009, and SSOSL311, while OmyClock1b and amh
(Arctic charr maps) were mapped in close proximity to
BHMS377 and OmyRGT36TUF markers (Figure 4),
which are homologous to RT-24 in rainbow trout.
These markers fall within genomic regions that contain
QTL for important life-history traits in salmonids such
as spawning time, early maturation, and development
rate [8,44,58-64] suggesting that Clock1 homeologs and

Page 11 of 21

putative amh duplicates may be candidate genes affecting these traits.
The strong spawning time QTL located on RT-8 in a
backcross family (Lot44) [58] accounted for up to 5060% of the trait variation [8,58,60]. Due to the lack of
recombination that has been detected in both sexes
within this chromosomal region [47], it has been difficult to assess the chromosomal arm location for these
QTL effects. However, using the comparative synteny
mapping approaches outlined above, it appears that the
most likely locations for these genes fall within the RT8q arm (i.e., derived from the M ancestral lineage).
Counter to this observation, the strongest early maturation QTL region on RT-8 was localized to the marker
OMM1304 on the RT-8p arm [44], indicating an origin
to the I ancestral lineage of teleost fishes [25]. However,
relatively strong QTL for this trait were also detected
for several makers falling within the central cluster of
markers which could, therefore, indicate interaction
effects among these regions.
Development rate QTLs have also been localized to
the central region of RT-8. For example, Sundin et al.
[61] suggested that a development rate QTL was located
on this linkage group (associated with markers
OmyFGT12TUF, OMM1009). A subsequent study,
using doubled haploid lines of rainbow trout confirmed
that a major developmental rate QTL was localized in
the central clusters of RT-8. This QTL explained a large
proportion of the phenotypic variation (23.2%) associated with the trait [64].
OmyClock1b also mapped to a region of the rainbow
trout genome (i.e., RT-24) with strong influences on
variation in life-history traits. Regions on RT-24p
(BHMS377 and OmyRGT36TUF) occupied by Clock1b
explained up to 20% of variation in the spawning time
of females [8,60]. Maturation timing QTL have also
been localized to RT-24 [44,59] but given the fact that
these QTL were localized in male parents, the determination of the chromosome arm affinities was not possible. Similarly, a small effect development rate QTL (one
of four along with RT-9, -10, -14) was localized to RT24, which explained approximately 1.26% of phenotypic
variation [64].
Other locations of Clock-like genes are also associated
with life-history QTL in rainbow trout. The NPAS2
copy mapped on RT-9 may correspond to one of the
developmental rate QTL identified in the Nichols et al.
[64] study. Additionally, a strong QTL for the timing of
smoltification in rainbow trout has been localized to
RT-20 [65] which may be related to Clock3 functional
differences.
In Arctic charr, SalClock1a was localized to AC-16,
and SalClock1b and amh were localized to AC-13 both
of which contain suggestive female maturation time

Paibomesai et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:215
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/215

QTL. On AC-16, SalClock1a is closely linked (0 cM
recombination) to Omy18INRA and BHMS417, markers
that suggestively influence age at sexual maturation in
females [63]. Likewise, SalClock1b and amh were linked
to OMM1211 on AC-13 in the Arctic charr maps at 0
cM and 3 cM recombination, respectively. This linkage
group contains a suggestive age at maturation QTL
centered on OMM1211. Both QTL on AC-16 and AC13 explained approximately 7% of the phenotypic variation [63].
Studies investigating genetic associations with life-history variation in Atlantic salmon have not been as extensive as those with rainbow trout or Arctic charr.
Fotherby [62] identified 11 putative QTL for early
maturation in female Atlantic salmon (at 3 years), but
only two of these (i.e., AS-17 and AS-28) overlapped with
a region homologous to a rainbow trout linkage group
containing a possible Clock-related gene effect. The
region identified on AS-17 (marked by One114ADFG) is
homologous to the RT-8p arm. One114ADFG is in fact
only 4 cM distal to OMM1304 in female rainbow trout
genetic maps, where the strong maturation timing QTL
was detected in the Haidle et al. [44] study. A marker
located distally on AS-28, BX873441, has homology to
the distal region of RT-9p, while a proximal marker,
CL47450, shows homology to rainbow trout duplicated
homeologs RT-14/20. As mentioned above, RT-9p possesses an NPAS2 copy, while Clock3 maps to RT-20, and
may possess a duplicate within either the RT-9/20 or RT14/20 homeology groups.
Rainbow trout is perhaps the most characterized salmonid species with respect to growth QTL. QTL on
RT-8, RT-9 and RT-24, which also coincide with the
location of Clock-related genes, have strong influences
on body weight (BW) [66]. While significant BW QTL
were also identified on RT-14 and RT-20, these linkage
groups were not observed to be significant across all the
parents tested, and thus were not considered to house
major BW species-specific QTL regions. Future studies
across multiple families in different strains may lead to
a different conclusion. The association among variation
in multiple life-history and phenotypic traits with Clockrelated chromosomal regions suggests the existence of
conserved blocks of genes regulating single or multiple
traits (discussed in the next section) [44,61].
Synteny analyses: conserved blocks of reproductive and
cell cycling genes

Synteny analysis across teleost species revealed a conserved block of genes surrounding the amh gene which
suggests the presence of a functional cluster [67]. Comparative analysis of amh containing regions on medaka
chromosome 4, tetraodon chromosome 1, and zebrafish
chromosome 22 revealed conserved synteny of 12 genes,

Page 12 of 21

including lhx7, hsd11b, map2k2, LINGO3, oaz1, DOT1L,
ELL, vtg, ddx59, nr5a2, kif14, and lhx9 involved with
sexual maturation and cell cycling. With the exception
of DOT1L, all these genes appear to exhibit circadian
oscillations in one or more mammalian tissues, suggesting either direct, or CCG-mediated regulation via Clock
gene expression [68] (Additional File 2). When the teleost genomic regions surrounding amh were compared
to the human chromosome 19, there was conserved synteny of DOT1L, oaz1, LINGO3, map2k2, and hsd11b
genes. Clock was found on the same chromosomes as
amh within medaka and tetraodon, and Clock was
tightly linked to kita across all the species investigated
(Additional File 2).
Genes regulating reproduction include lhx9, lhx7,
nr5a2, hsd11b3, and kit. For instance, members of the
LIM homeobox (lhx9 and lhx7) are found adjacent to
amh in medaka, tetraodon, and zebrafish. Lhx9 is essential for gonadal development in mice as Lhx9-deficient
mice developed without gonadal tissues [69,70]. Lhx7
(or lhx8) code for a transcription factor that plays a critical role in folliculogenesis. An Lhx7 deficiency results
in altered expression of oocyte-specific genes in the
ovary, and is therefore thought to be critical in follicle
formation and differentiation and maintenance of
oocytes [71]. Likewise, LRH-1 (nr5a2) is found upstream
to amh in the teleost species. This gene is an orphan
nuclear receptor, is a critical regulator of multiple
mechanisms essential for maturation of ovarian follicles
and for ovulation [72]. LRH-1 mutants resulted in
increased estradiol synthesis and downregulation of
genes (Scarb1, Star, Cyp11a1) critical for luteinization
[72]. Because of these effects, it is thought that LRH-1 is
primarily important for female sexual function relative
to SF-1 (nr5a1), which is involved in male sexual development [73].
As well, the Hsd11b3 gene is found adjacent to amh
in medaka, tetraodon, zebrafish and fugu (Additional
File 2). HSD11B3 (11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
type 3) is a steroidogenic enzyme that is involved in the
production of 11-ketotestosterone [74] the main androgen sex steroid which effects spermatogenesis and secondary sexual characteristics in male teleosts [75,76].
Mutations within the Hsd11b3 gene have also been
linked to pseudohermaphrodism in human males due to
altered sex steroid ratios [77]. In both sexes, HSD11B3
is also important for the conversion of glucocorticoids
into inert forms [78]. Corticosteroids have been linked
to suppression of steroidogenesis in mammals, therefore
HSD11B enzymes are thought to be important in protecting the developing gametes from high cortisol levels
[79-81].
In addition to its functions related to melanogenesis
and haemopoiesis the c-Kit gene is also important in

Paibomesai et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:215
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/215

regulating gametogenesis in vertebrates [82], and has
also been implicated in lipid metabolism as mice deficient for this gene exhibit steatosis of the liver during
development [83]. Kit is found adjacent to Clock and
amh in medaka, and tetraodon while in zebrafish, fugu,
human, and mouse Kit and Clock are adjacent on different chromosomes than amh. Kit tyrosine-kinase receptor and its ligand (KL) are essential for spermatogenesis
as they upregulate genes that promote mitosis, and
meiosis entry of spermatogonia [84]. Also, Kit is
involved in oogenesis and follliculogenesis in female
mammals (reviewed in [85]). Direct Clock-related regulation of this gene may also occur through retinoic acid
stimulation of Activator Protein 2 (AP-2) expression.
AP-2 as well as bHLH binding sites are present in the cKit gene [86], and Shirai et al. [87] have shown than
there is a bidirectional regulation of Clock/bmal1 regulated genes and retinoic acid levels mediated through
the expression of retinoic acid orphan receptors.
Specific to the fishes, vitellogenin (vtg) is found downstream to amh (Additional File 2). Vitellogenin is a precursor yolk protein in fish eggs, and it gene is regulated
as a result of estrogen binding [88]. Estrogen levels and
indeed sex steroid production in general may be directly
influenced by CLOCK levels, as the functional expression for one of the key enzymes regulating their production (i.e., steroidogenic acute regulatory protein or
StAR) has been shown to be altered via Clock/bmal1
expression [89]. Thus Clock expression may provide
direct regulation of subsequent VTG production.
Direct regulation of AMH production via Clock gene
expression is also considered possible given the fact that
Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) binding sites (a downstream CCG gene) have been identified within the 5’
region of the amh gene in both mammals [90] and fish
[91]. SF-1 (nr5a1) is the closest nuclear orphan receptor
family member to the LRH-1 gene (nr5a2) [92]. Given
the more prominent role of LRH-1 in ovarian development, compared to SF-1 [73] it would be of interest to
investigate potential cis-regulation of amh via nr5a2 in
future studies. Given the interactions that several of the
‘Clock/amh-syntenic’ genes exhibit in the formation and
maintenance of gonadal structures in both male and
female teleosts, we may consider that the genes found in
this cluster represent a ‘reproduction controlling block’.
Genes involved in cell cycling (kif14, map2k2, DOT1L,
and oaz1) are also found in conserved synteny surrounding amh across the species investigated. For example, Kif14 is found upstream to amh in medaka,
tetraodon, and zebrafish (Additional File 2). Kif14 codes
for a kinesin motor protein that regulates intracellular
movements. Silencing of KIF14 using strong RNA interference resulted in cytokinesis failure while weak RNA
interference-mediated silencing caused apoptosis of cells

Page 13 of 21

during various stages of mitosis [93]. Likewise, Map2k2
is found tightly linked with amh across the vertebrate
species examined. MAP2K2 is part of a signal transduction pathway (MEK/ERK/MAP kinase) that promotes
cell cycling. Similarly, DOT1L is tightly linked to amh
among teleosts, and this gene codes for a histone
methyltransferase (H3K79) that is associated with meiotic checkpoint control, and DNA damage response in
yeast [94,95]. DOT1L deficient mice demonstrated
developmental abnormalities that ultimately lead to
death [96]. oaz1, like DOT1L and map2k2, is tightly
linked to amh, and this gene codes for a protein that
binds to and promotes degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a protein that is involved in the regulation of mitotic turnover rates by controlling polyamine
levels [97-99].
Interestingly, some of the genes in this conserved cluster are involved in transcription control, cell cycling, and
regulation of circadian rhythms. For example, both ELL
and ddx59 expression is associated with RNA metabolism and these genes are adjacent to amh (Additional
File 2). DDX59 is a member of the DEAD-box proteins,
which are intimately involved in RNA metabolism as
they regulate translation and gene expression in organelles (reviewed in [100]). ELL functions as an RNA
polymerase II elongation factor that increases the overall
rate of transcription, and regulates mitotic phase transitions during the cell cycle [101]. ELL also regulates glucocorticoid steroid receptor responses, which may
partially modulate CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer activation [102], but does not influence androgen and progesterone receptors [101].
There is evidence that gene order on chromosomes is
not random in zebrafish, and in fact, co-expressed genes
tend to be found in close proximity to each other [103]
comprising functional clusters. Overall, the comparative
genomic analysis among the teleost species shows that
‘Clock-containing’ chromosomal segments are highly
conserved. We would therefore predict that the genes
found in this syntenic cluster will also co-occur on RT-8
or its homeolog RT-24 (i.e., two of the strongest life-history QTL regions in rainbow trout). However, additional
life-history QTL regions may also be partially regulated
via Clock expression if they possess CCGs.
Clock mediated regulation of reproductive/cell cycling
genes associated with salmonid life-history QTL regions

In mammalian systems, microarray studies of circadian
gene expression indicate that most circadian regulated
genes are either directly modulated via Clock or Clockinducible gene expression as the majority of genes identified as showing circadian rhythms in their expression
possessed E-box, AP-2, CRE, SP1 and EGR transcription
factor binding sites in their 5’ regulatory regions [68].

Paibomesai et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:215
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/215

CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers bind to E-box sequences
in the 5’ regions of genes and directly influence their
expression. Such CCGs are therefore considered to be
under direct circadian control. Some of these genes are
implicated in reproduction and growth and have been
mapped to rainbow trout life-history QTL regions, or
may reside within such QTL regions based upon putative homologous synteny comparisons among teleost
species [25]. For example, both Gonadotropin (GnRH)
and gonadotropin receptor (GnRHR) promoter regions
contain several non-canonical consensus E-boxes
(CANNTK) sites [104,105]. GnRH and GnRHR expression patterns were disrupted by the Clock mutation in
mice [6,105]. As a result, Clock mutant mice exhibited
prolonged estrous cycles and were subfertile [6]. GnRH
maps to RT-30 and RT-6 [8] and the copy on RT-30
may contribute to a strong maturation timing QTL in
rainbow trout [44].
Another gene potentially coupled to QTL variation in
rainbow trout is estrogen receptor beta (ERb, nr3a2),
which is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily
and a key mediator of estrogen action [106,107]. ERb
shows circadian oscillations in expression and not surprisingly has an E-box element in the promoter region
which allows for direct Clock gene control [108]. A copy
of ERb (esr2a) is located less than 1 Mb away from the
Clock gene on zebrafish chromosome Dr-20, which
would make this gene a contributing candidate to the
DR, SPT and EM QTL that have been detected on RT24. Another gene that is related to reproduction and is
under direct Clock gene control is StAR, which regulates
the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis. StAR showed
circadian rhythms, and contains E-box regions in promoter regions that allow CLOCK:BMAL1 to activate
transcription [89]. bmal1 knock-out mice were infertile
and gonadotropin levels were altered [109]. Alvarez et
al. [109] found that StAR expression was not altered in
Clock mutant mice; however, they did not assess the
effects of the Clock homolog NPAS2 mutants. StAR
maps to 45.651 Mb on Dr-8, and to 18.480 Mb on
medaka linkage group Ol-9 which makes this gene part
of the I ancestral lineage of teleost fishes [55]. Using
comparative synteny blocks to the rainbow trout genome, it is inferred that the most likely map position for
this gene with either be the RT-10p or RT-19q linkage
group arms [25]. EM and SPT QTL have been localized
to RT-19 [8,44].
Some of the cell-cycle genes (e.g. Wee1) involved in
either G2-M or G1-S transitions contain E-boxes [110]
indicating their status as a CCG. Wee1 is a protein
kinase known to be involved in mitotic entry checkpoint
in eukaryotic cells as it regulates phosphorylation status
of CDC2 whose activity is required for a cell to enter
mitosis. Besides growth, cancer is related to cell-cycling,

Page 14 of 21

and as such, CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers regulate the
expression of c-MYC oncoprotein, which cooperates
with ATM (ataxia-telangeictasia mutated), in promoting
apoptosis and suppressing tumorigenesis [111]. NPAS2:
BMAL1 heterodimers coincidentally influence c-MYC
expression [112]. A recent PCR array study demonstrated that NPAS2 knockdowns in vitro resulted in significant effects on genes involved in cell cycling and
DNA repair, which further supports that circadian genes
may play a role in tumorigenesis and cell cycling
[111,113]. Rainbow trout linkage group regions with
greatest homology to Dr-18 and Ol-6 where Wee-1 has
been mapped are the homeologous pair RT-10q/18, and
may be associated with a moderate DR QTL effect on
RT-10 [64].
Several genes influencing reproduction and growth
contain potential Clock/bmal1 regulatory sites (E-box
sequences) and demonstrate circadian oscillations in
certain tissues within the mouse [68]. For example, promoter regions of follicle stimulating hormone receptor
(FSHR), androgen receptor (AR) and growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9) contain E-box sequences in their
promoter regions, and thus may be partially regulated in
a CCG fashion [114,115]. As hormone receptors, both
FSHR and AR expression is required to enable the signal
transduction of FSH and testosterone, in order for spermatogenesis to occur [116]. GDF9 is critical for normal
ovarian function as it regulates key genes (i.e. kit ligand,
LH receptor, prostaglandins, and progesterone) involved
in folliculogenesis [115]. As well, SF-1 (nr5a1), an
orphan nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of
the steroidogenic genes and sexual differentiation
(reviewed in [73]) contains E-box sequence in the promoter region [117]. Luteinizing hormone itself also
appears to be under circadian control as the LH surge
required in proestrous was not seen in Clock mutant
mice [118]. LH itself contains E-box motifs in the promoter region [119], which suggests that LH production
is under direct CLOCK:BMAL1 control. Upstream control may also occur with vasopressin, an LH regulator,
which is directly regulated by CLOCK:BMAL1 [118].
Currently mapping data is only available for SF-1 in
zebrafish, making syntenic comparisons to the rainbow
trout genome difficult. For the other 4 genes, however,
it is known that LH maps to RT-17 (i.e., GTH2B) [120],
and it is also predicted that FSHR maps to RT-17q as
this gene is located on Dr-12 at 29.005 Mb, and on Ol19 at 11.455 Mb. This region is reported to possess a
strong EM QTL [44]. Interestingly, both AR and Gdf9
may also map to a single genomic region (i.e., the homeologous pair RT-3q/25p), as AR maps to Dr-5 at 35.987
Mb, and within Ol-10 at 18.354 Mb, while Gdf9 maps
to Dr-14 at 23.776 Mb and Ol-10 at 13.566 Mb, making
both these genes likely descendants from the GH

Actinopterygian chromosome lineage [25]. Moderately
strong EM and SPT QTL have been localized to RT-3
[8,44].

Conclusions
Multiple Clock-family gene copies have been identified
in this study (i.e., up to 5 in rainbow trout), that map to
duplicated homeologous linkage group positions in the
various salmonid species investigated. The NPAS2 and
Clock3 genes within this family appear ancestrally more
closely related, than do the Clock1 copies, and the physical linkage of the Clock1 gene duplicates to major lifehistory QTL regions in salmonid fishes, posits their
functional role in regulating many of the associated lifehistory traits that have been studied in these fishes.
Intriguingly, many genes important in regulating growth
and life-history events are known to occur in sytenic
clusters close to the Clock gene clusters. As an example,
one of the most important genes regulating maturation
timing in salmonids (i.e., anti-mullerian hormone), was
mapped within a syntenic region of the Clock1a gene in
rainbow trout. However, in Arctic charr, this gene was
located within the Clock1b gene syntenic block, indicating differential silencing of the duplicated copies following the salmonid specific 4R gene duplication event.
The functional associations of Clock gene regulation in
relation to cis- and trans-effects on gene expression
within these genes and additional Clock Controlled
Genes within salmonids remains to be investigated.
Methods
Mapping panels

Six mapping panels (full-sib families) were used for
mapping the Clock and amh genes. Rainbow trout
panels were designated as Lot-25 (n = 48) and Lot-44 (n
= 90) [53], Arctic charr panels as AC2 (n = 48) and
AC3 (n = 48) [52], and Atlantic salmon panels as BR5
(n = 46) and BR6 (n = 46) [53].
Sequencing of Clock genes

The Clock genes were amplified in five individuals from
each of the rainbow trout (Lot25 and Lot44), Atlantic
salmon (BR5 and BR6), and Arctic charr (AC2 and
AC3) families. To amplify Clock in the salmonines, primers were designed from two Clock genomic sequences
from Chinook salmon Otsclock1a (Genbank: DQ780892)
and Otsclock1b (Genbank: DQ780894). Clock3 (Ensembl:
ENSDARG00000003631) and NPAS2 (Ensembl:
ENSDARG00000016536) sequences from zebrafish were
used to search the Atlantic salmon BAC End sequences
database [121] for putative Clock3 and NPAS2 sequence.
Primers, listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3, were designed to
amplify the conserved orthologous regions for Clock1,
Clock3, and NPAS2 copies in rainbow trout, Arctic

charr and Atlantic salmon. amh sequences were not
obtained in this study, but primers designed from
known rainbow trout amh EST sequences were used to
detect SSCP polymorphisms within this gene (see
below).
Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) consisted of 150 ng
of genomic DNA, 1× PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 mM
MgSO4, 0.2-0.4 μM primer mix, 0.2 mM of each dNTP
(Fisher Scientific) and 1 U of High Fidelity Platinum
Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The thermal cycler conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 1 min
that was followed by 35 amplification cycles of 94°C for
30 s, 48-62°C for 30 s and 68°C for 1-10 min (1 min per
Kbp). The amplification products were observed on 1.02.0% TBE agarose gel and purified using Qiaquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and inserted into pGEM Easy
Vector (Promega). The plasmid DNA from six clones
for each PCR product was purified (QIAprep Plasmid
Miniprep Kit, Qiagen) and sequenced with T7 and Sp6
primers and the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit on the ABI 3730 DNA analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA).
Sequence analysis of Salmonine Clock genes

Basic Local Alignment (BLASTN) [122] searches were
used to confirm the identity of the Clock sequences.
Sequence identity values were determined by pairwise
comparisons of the salmonine Clock sequences using
the Jukes-Cantor correction in MEGA 4.0 [123]. Additional nucleotide and protein alignments were generated
by hand using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [124].
Rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, and Arctic charr Clock
exons were named based on homology to either Chinook salmon Clock1a (Otsclock1a) exons or zebrafish
Clock (DreClock1; AF133306) exons. Clock1b sequences
were aligned with DreClock1 exons to determine coding
regions. Since Otsclock1b (DQ780894) from Chinook
salmon has only been partially sequenced the exons
were not annotated, and thus reference is made to the
orthologous exon blocks in zebrafish. NPAS2 exons
were determined by alignment with NPAS2 (Ensembl:
ENSGACG00000020338) from stickleback. Sequencing
and mapping primers for the genes investigated in this
study, along with their GenBank accession numbers are
provided in Tables 1, 2 and 3 for rainbow trout, Atlantic
salmon, and Arctic charr, respectively.

Mapping of Clock and amh genes

To localize the Clock genes in the rainbow trout, Arctic
charr, and Atlantic salmon linkage maps, copy-specific
primers were developed to amplify family-based polymorphic insertion-deletion or single nucleotide regions
(SNPs) in the sequences (Tables 1, 2 and 3). Anti-müllerian hormone (amh) primers were developed from a

rainbow trout EST contig cluster TC133387 deposited
in the Harvard DFCI gene indices [126]. Polymerase
chain reactions were performed in 7 μL reaction
volumes consisting of 30 ng of template DNA, 1× PCR
buffer (Promega), 0.2 mM each dNTP (Fisher Scientific),
0.1 μM of each primer (one of the primers being 5’fluorescently end-labeled with tetrachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (TET)), 2 mM MgCl2 (Promega) and 0.15 U
of the GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega). The amplifications were performed on a Peltier Thermal Cycler
PTC-200 (MJ Research, MA) with the conditions as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min followed by
35 amplification cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 48-62°C for 20
s and 72°C for 30 s. The amplification products were
run on 6% acrylamide gels for length polymorphisms
[31] or single-stranded conformational polymorphism
(SSCP) gels for SNPs [8]. The gels were visualized on a
FMBIO III scanner and Image Analysis software (Hitachi Genetics Systems). After genotyping the mapping
families, LINKMFEX [127] was used to test for deviations from the Mendelian segregation ratio of markers
(1:1, log-likelihood G-test) and determine the linkage
ordering of markers within specific linkage group
assignments using a minimum logarithm of odds score
of 4.0.
Analysis of mapping locations: comparative genomics
and QTL

The mapping positions of Clock duplicates within a
given species were used to indicate homeologous affinities between linkage groups. As well, the mapping
positions of Clock orthologs across the salmonine species were compared to determine homologies. Comparative synteny analyses between the salmonines and
model fish species, zebrafish, stickleback, and medaka,
were used to determine the ancient origin of the genomic regions surrounding the Clock and amh genes. To
assess homologies among the three model teleost

species, rainbow trout Clock and NPAS2 sequences
were aligned to the genomes of these two species
using two approaches. First, BLASTN alignments using
the “Distant Homologies” option in http://www.
ensembl.org were utilized to assess the most likely
contiguous alignments of these sequences to those of
the three model species. Second, MEGABLAST [122]
was used to search for possible widely gapped alignments to the source model species genomes using the
“discontiguous alignments” option. If BLAST alignments suggested homology to a genomic region within
any one of the model species that did not correspond
to an annotated gene description within the species,
the genomic region within that species was further
queried for possible gene exon structure using the
Softberry program Fgenesh-M [57,128], also contained
within the Molquest site[129]. Matches to BLASTN
alignments that corresponded to possible exon structure reads with Fgenesh-M were interpreted as possible
functional genes that are currently unannotated, while
lack of identified exon structure within the region was
interpreted as a pseudogene signature. Ancient linkage
groups are named as per Kasahara et al. [55] and
Danzmann et al. [25]. The mapping locations of the
Clock genes and amh were also compared to previously
known life-history and growth quantitative trait loci
(QTL) in the salmonine species.
Synteny analysis of Clock and amh genes

The strand orientation and chromosomal position of
genes upstream and downstream to Clock and amh in
zebrafish, medaka, fugu, tetraodon, human, and mouse
were determined manually from the gene orientations
listed in BIOMART from the Ensembl database [130].
Synteny rearrangements were assessed within homologous linkage group segments using conserved anchor
gene positions upstream and downstream of the Clock
and amh mapping locations. Anchor gene positions that

Paibomesai et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:215

were classified as either major sexual development genes
or cell-cycling genes were noted.
