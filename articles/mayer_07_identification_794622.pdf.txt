Abstract
Background: The large amount of available sequence information for the plant acyl-ACP
thioesterases (TEs) made it possible to use a bioinformatics-guided approach to identify amino acid
residues involved in substrate specificity. The Conserved Property Difference Locator (CPDL)
program allowed the identification of putative specificity-determining residues that differ between
the FatA and FatB TE classes. Six of the FatA residue differences identified by CPDL were
incorporated into the FatB-like parent via site-directed mutagenesis and the effect of each on TE
activity was determined. Variants were expressed in E. coli strain K27 that allows determination of
enzyme activity by GCMS analysis of fatty acids released into the medium.
Results: Substitutions at four of the positions (74, 86, 141, and 174) changed substrate specificity
to varying degrees while changes at the remaining two positions, 110 and 221, essentially
inactivated the thioesterase. The effects of substitutions at positions 74, 141, and 174 (3-MUT) or
74, 86, 141, 174 (4-MUT) were not additive with respect to specificity.
Conclusion: Four of six putative specificity determining positions in plant TEs, identified with the
use of CPDL, were validated experimentally; a novel colorimetric screen that discriminates
between active and inactive TEs is also presented.

Background
Plant acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases (TEs)
hydrolyze acyl-ACP thioester bonds, releasing free fatty
acids and ACP. Plant acyl-ACP TEs are nuclear encoded,
plastid-targeted globular proteins [1] that are functional
as dimers [2,3]. Their activity represents the terminal step
in the plastidial fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. The
resulting free fatty acids enter the cytosol where they are
esterified to coenzyme A and further metabolized into
membrane lipids and/or storage triacylglycerols.

Plant acyl-ACP TEs have characteristic chain length specificities that vary from 8–18 carbons, and the substrate preferences of individual TEs have been shown to play a key
role in determining the composition of storage lipids
[1,4,5]. Based on amino acid sequence alignments, the
plant TEs have been shown to cluster into two families,
FatAs, which show marked preference for 18:1-ACP with
minor activity towards 18:0- and 16:0-ACPs; and FatBs,
which hydrolyze primarily saturated acyl-ACPs with chain
lengths that vary between 8–16 carbons [5-7]. FatAs and

FatBs both contain predicted ~60 amino acid transit peptides, however, FatBs have an additional conserved hydrophobic 18-residue domain that can be removed without
affecting activity and which has been proposed to form a
helical transmembrane anchor [8]. With the exception of
two short regions that are unique to each class, the FatA
and FatB sequences contain a core region of ~210 residues
that show dispersed sequence similarity throughout.
Because of their importance in determining which fatty
acids are stored in seed oil, several studies have focused on
engineering plant TEs with altered substrate specificities as
a strategy for tailoring specialty seed oils [8]. These studies
have taken advantage of the rich diversity of sequence
information available for the plant thioesterases and used
a sequence-based approach to engineering plant thioesterases with altered substrate specificity [5,8-10]. However,
the large amount of sequence variation between the FatA
and FatB types of plant TEs makes it difficult to determine
which amino acid residues are particularly important for
substrate specificity.
When the amount of sequence variation between groups
is high, bioinformatics tools can guide the development
of a hierarchy of amino acid residues potentially important for specificity. The likelihood of success of this
approach for the plant acyl-ACP TEs is increased by the
availability of the above mentioned sequence information as well as by a 3D structural model of the FatB
enzyme [11]. Furthermore, to assist in such an approach
we recently developed the computer program Conserved
Property Difference Locator (CPDL) [12]. CPDL identifies
positions in an alignment of two functional classes of
homologous proteins where each class has a conserved
but different amino acid residue. This type of position has
been shown repeatedly to be involved in functional specialization and of use in engineering proteins to switch
their function from one class to that of the other
[8,9,13,14]. Once identified by CPDL, these residues can
be targeted for reciprocal switches between the two groups
to introduce variability and evaluate their effects on
enzyme function. CPDL identified many positions in the
thioesterase family that show differences in either
sequence or amino acid properties between the FatA and
FatB classes. We evaluated the effects of several of the most
dramatic changes identified by CPDL on thioesterase
activity and substrate specificity. Using this approach we
were able to identify four positions which influence the
substrate specificity of the enzyme.

Results
Description of the homologous classes
The two functional classes of plant acyl-ACP thioesterases
(unsaturated fatty acid-recognizing Fat A versus saturated
fatty acid-recognizing FatB) are well-defined in phyloge-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/1

netic trees (Figure 1) constructed from multiple sequence
alignment information (the .msf file is provided [see
Additional file 1]). Each thioesterase contains a transit
peptide of variable sequence at the N-terminus that signals their import into the chloroplast, thus only the
mature protein sequences were considered in our analyses
(starting at L88 in AtFatB). Overall, the family has relatively low sequence identity (10.4%), although identity is
higher within classes (44.2% within the 13 FatA's, 19.7%
within the 26 FatB's). Residues that are completely conserved within the family include N227, H229, and C264
(Figure 2), each of which has been implicated in catalysis
and may form a papain-like catalytic triad [11,20].
CPDL-identified positions
Of the >400 positions within the thioesterase alignments,
CPDL identified 67 positions within the family where
there is conservation of sequence and 6 positions where
there is conservation of amino acid properties within one
of the classes (for example, see Figure 3). At nine positions, residues are conserved in each class but different
between classes and are thus annotated with hourglasses
(Table 2). Four of the nine hourglass positions are colored
black, indicating conservative differences between the
classes. The other five hourglasses are red and denote nonconservative differences between the classes. Many positions are marked with orange circles to denote property
differences that are not necessarily accompanied by a consistent sequence difference. One such position is 86 where
the FatB's always contain a charged residue (21 have
lysine, 4 have arginine, 1 has glutamate) while the FatA's
always contain the neutral glutamine.

Because they represent the most dramatic differences
between the two thioesterase classes, we chose to evaluate
the effect of each of the residues flagged with red hourglass icons. We also chose to examine the effect of position 86 as an example in which enzyme sequence is not
conserved, but a particular property difference (in this
case charged versus neutral) is conserved.
In vivo thioesterase activity of CPDL variants
Each variant was evaluated in a bacterial expression system that allows determination of enzyme activity by
measurement of the fatty acids present in the medium
[7,9,10,19]. Individual colonies containing TE variants
were grown in liquid medium at 30°C for 36 hr. The
medium was collected and fatty acid methyl esters were
prepared and then analyzed by GCMS. These assays
showed that each mutation had an effect on thioesterase
activity (Figure 4a). In particular, the V110T and W221R
mutations were detrimental and had little detectable
activity in the in vivo E. coli assay. While the M141T mutation lost ~75% total activity, (Figure 4a) some activity
towards 16:1 was preferentially retained (Figure 4b). Fur-

pared to the parent enzyme (Figure 4b). Two variants containing combinations of three (3-MUT: M74A, M141T,
S174Q) or four (4-MUT: M74A, K86Q, M141T, S174Q)
active mutations showed further reductions in activity
(Figure 4a).
Because the M141T mutation substantially re-oriented
specificity toward 16:1, we wanted to determine what
effect other residues at this position might have on TE
activity and specificity. Of the 84 saturation mutagenesis
variants chosen for FAME analysis, none were found to

have more 16:1 in the medium than the M141T variant
(data not shown). Variants containing arginine, leucine,
or isoleucine produced amounts of 16:1 similar to the
threonine variant and were equally active while those containing glycine or phenylalanine were less active and produced less 16:1 than the threonine variant (data not
shown). Sequencing of several active and inactive variants
showed that the library contained at least 21 of the 32
possible codons at position 141. Of the 43 variants
sequenced (representing 50% of the library), none had

valine, glutamine, or histidine at position 141. All other
amino acids were represented in the library.
Agar-plate based screen for TE activity
When plated on BTNA agar, there are subtle changes in
colony morphology between variants expressing active
plant acyl-ACP TEs and those expressing inactive TEs ([10]
and KMM personal observation). However, we hoped to
identify a more dramatic difference in order to facilitate
future screening of libraries of variant TEs. Reasoning that
the fatty acids eliminated into the growth medium by E.
coli strain K27 would decrease the local pH around colonies that were expressing active variants of the plant acylACP TE, we set out to find a pH indicator that could be
added to agar plates for screening purposes. We were able
to reproducibly screen for TE activity using standard MacConkey agar with lactose as the sugar source; the pH indicator neutral red changes from red (pH 6.8) to yellow (pH
8.0). A range of intensity in the red color is apparent when
evaluating colonies that express TEs with a range of activities (Figure 5). However, the color of the variants expressing an active plant TE is white not red, as would be
expected if the color change were being caused by the
lower pH due to the excreted fatty acid. Thus, instead of
reflecting a change in the local pH around active TE variants, the neutral red indicator may actually reflect a difference in the composition and stability of the bacterial
membrane. For example, the ability to take up neutral red
from the medium has been linked to virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and has been shown to be the result of
changes in the fatty acid composition and external surface
of the cell membrane [21].

Discussion
The modification of thioesterase specificity has proven to
be useful for genetic engineering of plants containing high
levels of commercially-useful fatty acids. For example,
expression of a thioesterase from the California Bay Laurel
(Umbellularia californica) in canola allowed the commercial production of a genetically engineered oil crop containing large amounts of laurate [5] while expression of a
thioesterase from Garcinia mangostana in canola resulted
in seeds containing increased amounts of stearate [22].
Using an approach that compares the sequences of
homologous enzymes with different substrate specificities, the substrate specificity of plant thioesterases has
been shown to be mutable. However, the large number of
amino acid differences between any two homologous TEs
makes it difficult to identify the subset of amino acid
changes that will result in a change in specificity. One
commonly used approach to reduce the number of possible SDPs is to generate chimeric enzymes [9]. Using this
approach, it was found that the normally high 12:0 specificity of the Umbellularia californica FatB enzyme can be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/1

switched to 14:0 by three amino acid changes (M197R/
R199H/T231K) [9]. However, oftentimes the resulting
chimeric enzymes are either inactive or exhibit no change
in specificity [8,23]. What would be helpful is a method
that allows the reduction of the possible SDPs to a manageable, ranked set where each change can be individually
examined experimentally.
We previously reported on the Conserved Property Difference Locator (CPDL) which was designed for use in such
situations [12]. CPDL uses as input the amino acid
sequence alignment of a group of enzymes broken into
two homologous classes and then flags positions where
there is a difference in either amino acid sequence or a
property such as hydrophobicity [12]. From the alignment of FatA versus FatB TEs, CPDL identified several
potential specificity-determining positions. We chose to
use the most stringent CPDL criteria and therefore individually engineered into the parent enzyme the six most
dramatic changes, including five non-conservative
changes and one position with a difference in amino acid
charge between FatAs and FatBs.
Interestingly, four of the five residues flagged with red
hourglasses identified by CPDL as putative specificitydetermining positions (74, 110, 141, 174) are located in
a structural element referred to as the N-terminal hot dog
domain [11]. Through the construction of chimeric
enzymes, this region has been shown to control specificity
[9]. The remaining position flagged by a red hourglass
(221) is near the catalytic asparagine and histidine in the
second hot dog domain. However, only one of the four
residues flagged with black (conservative) hourglasses
identified by CPDL is in the N-terminal hot dog domain,
lending validity to the selection of sites that contain conservative versus non-conservative substitutions between
classes as a criterion for ranking putative specificity determining positions.
Each of these six changes suggested by CPDL were individually engineered into the parent FatB enzyme and the
effect of the change was determined experimentally.
Mutations at each CPDL-identified position substantially
affected thioesterase activity and/or specificity. Two of the
six (V110T and W221R) essentially inactivated the
enzyme while the other four mutations affected substrate
specificity to some degree. It is interesting to note that
unlike previous studies [9], combinations of mutations at
multiple CPDL-identified positions (variants 3-MUT and
4-MUT) did not improve enzymatic performance and in
fact, came close to eliminating activity.
We recently modeled the predicted structure of the plant
acyl-ACP thioesterases [11]. Using this model, we mapped
the CPDL mutations relative to the predicted active site of

the thioesterase (Figure 6). Each of the positions is located
within 16 Angstroms of the nearest catalytic residue. The
monomer of the enzyme itself in the structural model is
~43 × ~49 × ~35 Angstroms. Mutations at the two positions farthest away from the catalytic site (141 and 86)
have been shown to affect enzyme specificity (here and
[9]). Mutations at the two positions closest to the catalytic
site (each ~8 Angstroms away) essentially inactivated the
enzyme (110 and 221). Position 141 shifted specificity
toward 16:1 in vivo and is located on one of the b-sheets.
Position 184, which caused a shift in specificity from 14:0
and 16:1 toward 16:0 and 18:1, is located 11 Angstroms
from its closest catalytic neighbor and is on a flexible loop

that has the potential to shift during binding and/or catalysis. Because this is a flexible region, there is some uncertainty regarding its conformation in the FatB structure
relative to the FatB model based on threading onto the
1BVQ structure [11].
Many characteristic properties of the amino acid residues
present at the CPDL-identified positions are also different
between the classes. To summarize these changes, the
alanine is smaller than the methionine at position 74, the
threonine is smaller than methionine and has an OH
group at position 141, the lysine to glutamine change at
position 86 removes a positive charge and adds an amine

Methods
CPDL analysis of plant acyl-ACP thioesterases
All sequences were obtained from NCBI and accession
numbers are provided in Figure 1. Only enzymes whose
substrate specificity has been demonstrated experimentally were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Amino
acid sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW (v 1.82)
with default parameters [15] and the subsequent phylogenetic analyses were done using PHYLIP with default
parameters [16]. TREEVIEW [17] was used to display the
resulting trees. The CPDL [12] program settings were

Cloning and E. coli expression system
The coding sequence of the mature AtFatB was amplified
from plasmid TE3-2 [19] with primers FatBF (Table 1) and
FatBR and cloned into the pBC expression plasmid [10]
using the XhoI and SpeI restriction sites. The final plasmid
construct pBC(AtFatB-par) contains three amino acid residue differences (I176L, E178D, L202S) as compared to
the NCBI sequence (accession # Z36911). Each of the
CPDL variants was constructed by overlap extension PCR
using AtFatB-par as template in combination with the
primers listed in Table 1 then cloned into the pBC expres-

sion plasmid. At each relevant position, the most common residue from AtFatA was introduced into AtFatB-par.
Saturation mutagenesis was performed at position 141 via
PCR using either the FatBF and MSatR primers (reaction
1) or the MSatF and FatBR primers (reaction 2). Each reaction contained 10 mM of each primer, 10 mM dNTPs, 1 U
Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and 15 mM MgCl2 in
PCR buffer (100 mM Tris, 250 mM KCl, pH 8.3). Thirty
cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 45°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for
60 sec were performed. The fragments were gel-purified
(Zymo Research) and then combined to use as template in
an overlap extension PCR with the FatBF and FatBR prim-

ers. Each reaction contained 10 mM of each primer, 10
mM dNTPs, 1 U Advantage cDNA Taq polymerase (Clontech), and 35 mM MgCl2 in PCR buffer (100 mM Tris, 250
mM KCl, pH 9.2). Thirty cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 40°C
for 30 sec, and 72°C for 90 sec were performed. The ends
of the resulting ~1.5 kb band were cut with XhoI and SpeI
(New England Biolabs) and then the band was gel-purified (Zymo Research) before ligating the fragment into the
pBC plasmid. The ligation mixture was used to transform
chemically-competent K27 cells. The transformation mixture was spread on LB plates containing chloramphenicol
and placed at 30°C overnight. Eighty-four colonies were
picked into a 96-well plate containing 600 ml of BTNA

medium (10 g NZ-amine and 5 g NaCl per L, pH 7.0) containing chloramphenicol. Four colonies each of K27 with
pBC (empty vector control) and parent (positive control)
were included on the same 96-well plate.
For fatty acid analysis, each pBC-based plasmid was transformed into the K27 strain of E. coli (CGSC5478). Strain
K27 contains a mutation in the FadD enzyme of fatty acid
biosynthesis that prevents uptake of free fatty acid from
the medium. Thus, when an acyl-ACP thioesterase is
expressed in this system, the free fatty acid product of the
thioesterase reaction is secreted to the medium and
remains there [9]. Transformed cells containing any of the
plasmid constructs were grown at 30°C on BTNA medium
containing 170 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Five colonies of
each variant were grown individually for fatty acid analysis.

Fatty acid analysis
Fatty acid content of the medium from various cell cultures was determined by the production and measurement of fatty acid methyl esters. Briefly, 22 μl of glacial
acetic acid and 1 ml of 1:1 (vol:vol) chloroform:methanol
was added to 0.5 ml of medium from pelleted cells corrected to give equivalent cell density based on A550. After
mixing by inversion, the phases were separated by centrifugation and the lower phase was transferred to a fresh
glass tube. The chloroform was evaporated by N2 stream,
1 ml of 2% H2SO4 in methanol was added, and the samples were heated to 90°C for 1 h. Samples were extracted
once with 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl and 2 ml of hexane. The
organic phase was transferred to a fresh tube and dried
under N2 and then resuspended in 50 μl of hexane. 3 μl
samples were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas
chromatograph equipped with a 5973 mass selective

m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The injector was held at 225°C,
the oven temperature was varied (100–160°C at 25°C/
min, then 10°C/min to 240°C), and a helium flow of 1.1
ml/min was maintained. FAMEs were prepared individually from five colonies of each variant, as well as the parent and pBC-containing clones.
