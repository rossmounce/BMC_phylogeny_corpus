Abstract
Background: Sugarcane is an increasingly economically and environmentally important C4 grass,
used for the production of sugar and bioethanol, a low-carbon emission fuel. Sugarcane originated
from crosses of Saccharum species and is noted for its unique capacity to accumulate high amounts
of sucrose in its stems. Environmental stresses limit enormously sugarcane productivity worldwide.
To investigate transcriptome changes in response to environmental inputs that alter yield we used
cDNA microarrays to profile expression of 1,545 genes in plants submitted to drought, phosphate
starvation, herbivory and N2-fixing endophytic bacteria. We also investigated the response to
phytohormones (abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate). The arrayed elements correspond mostly to
genes involved in signal transduction, hormone biosynthesis, transcription factors, novel genes and
genes corresponding to unknown proteins.
Results: Adopting an outliers searching method 179 genes with strikingly different expression
levels were identified as differentially expressed in at least one of the treatments analysed. Self

Organizing Maps were used to cluster the expression profiles of 695 genes that showed a highly
correlated expression pattern among replicates. The expression data for 22 genes was evaluated
for 36 experimental data points by quantitative RT-PCR indicating a validation rate of 80.5% using
three biological experimental replicates. The SUCAST Database was created that provides public
access to the data described in this work, linked to tissue expression profiling and the SUCAST
gene category and sequence analysis. The SUCAST database also includes a categorization of the
sugarcane kinome based on a phylogenetic grouping that included 182 undefined kinases.
Conclusion: An extensive study on the sugarcane transcriptome was performed. Sugarcane genes
responsive to phytohormones and to challenges sugarcane commonly deals with in the field were
identified. Additionally, the protein kinases were annotated based on a phylogenetic approach. The
experimental design and statistical analysis applied proved robust to unravel genes associated with
a diverse array of conditions attributing novel functions to previously unknown or undefined genes.
The data consolidated in the SUCAST database resource can guide further studies and be useful
for the development of improved sugarcane varieties.

Background
Sugarcane is an increasingly economically attractive crop,
used for the production of approximately 60% of the
world's sugar and also of ethanol, a low-carbon emission
fuel. Sugarcane varieties with improved tolerance to
adverse environmental conditions are highly desirable.
Unfavorable environmental factors are the major culprits
of losses in agriculture and can reduce average productivity by 65% to 87% depending on the crop [1]. Crops better fit to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses have been
selected by traditional genetic breeding programs but the
slow pace in obtaining plants with the desirable traits limits the development of improved crop varieties. In this scenario, the use of molecular tools that enable gene-targeted
modifications to achieve a phenotype of interest is highly
promising.
Plants react to changes in the environment through an
array of cellular responses that are activated by stress stimuli, leading to plant defense and/or adjustment to adverse
conditions. Physiological changes elicited by external signals can be modulated by transcriptional regulation leading to the induction or repression of target genes. Many
high throughput studies have been conducted to define
gene expression changes in plants submitted to stress [25]. Such studies showed that signal transduction gene
expression is altered in response to stress possibly leading
to changes in growth and development and adjustment to
environmental conditions. Few studies have been conducted to unravel sugarcane's responses to biotic and abiotic stresses or the role of phytohormones in these
processes. Examples of these are those that evaluated
changes in the sugarcane transcriptome induced by cold
and methyl jasmonate treatment [6,7]. The aim of this
work was to profile sugarcane gene expression under conditions that affect crop yield: drought, phosphate starvation, herbivory and endophytic bacteria interaction.
Drought is a condition of special interest, not only for sug-

arcane, but also for other crops, since increasing water
scarcity has been observed throughout the world. Plant
irrigation currently accounts for approximately 65% of
global freshwater use indicating that the development of
plant varieties resistant to drought will be a necessity in
the near future [8,9]. Plant responses to drought are complex, partially dependent on ABA signaling and dependent on the intensity and duration of the stimulus. The
main responses include changes in ion fluxes, stomatal
closing, production of osmoprotectants and alteration in
plant growth patterns [9].
A significant portion of the arable land in tropical areas
presents either limiting concentrations of essential nutrients or toxicity. Phosphorous (P), an essential macronutrient, is one of the most limiting nutrients for plant
growth because of its low solubility and high sorption
capacity in soil [10]. Plant roots acquire P as inorganic
phosphate (Pi), although the concentration of Pi in the
soil solution is often low (2 to 10 mM) [11]. The low
availability of Pi in the acid soils of tropical and subtropical regions is a major limiting factor for crop production
[12]. P constitutes around 0.2% of plants dry weight [13]
and plays important roles in several biological processes,
such as nucleic acid and phospholipid biosynthesis,
energy metabolism, signal transduction and enzyme
activity regulation.
Insect pests frequently challenge sugarcane productivity.
The sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis is the major sugarcane pest in Brazil causing plant death due to apical bud
death (dead heart) in plants of up to four months of age
and damage to lateral bud development, aerial rooting,
weight loss and stalk breakage in older plants. The attack
also allows for infection by opportunistic fungi, which
results in production loss for both the sugar and alcohol
industries [[14] and references herein].

The sugarcane culture is highly benefited by the association with N2-fixing endophytic bacteria (Herbaspirillum
seropedicae/Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus). Unlike rhizobium/leguminosae
symbiosis, where bacteria are restricted to nodules, Herbaspirillum spp. and G. diazotrophicus are endophytic, and
colonize intercellular spaces and vascular tissues of most
plant organs without causing damage to the host [15,16].
These bacteria promote plant growth possibly by nitrogen
fixation and also by the production of plant hormones
[17]. Despite the non-pathogenic aspects of this interaction, plants should limit bacterial growth inside their tissues, or the association can result in disease [18]. Little is
known about the signaling mechanisms that are involved
in the establishment of a beneficial association with the
plant.
A study on the response of sugarcane plants to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments is
needed since the role of these phytohormones in biotic
and abiotic stress responses is well characterized and
could point us to the regulatory mechanisms behind the
stress treatments of interest. Several evidences point to a
complex signaling network triggered by the action of ABA,
including cross-talk with other hormone response pathways [19]. Moreover, several genes that are induced by
ABA also have their expression induced by drought and
cold stress [20]. Protein kinases [21] and transcription factors [22] have been shown to mediate the signal transduction network of MeJA action. All MeJA actions seem to
need a functional COI protein, involved in ubiquitinmediated proteolysis [23]. cDNA arrays have been used to
evaluate changes in gene expression in sugarcane leaves
treated with MeJA [7]. Two transcriptional factors encoding a putative zinc finger protein, a heat shock factor protein, protein kinases, proteins with a role in secondary
metabolism, protein synthesis, stress response and photosynthesis were found to be differentially expressed.
The genes studied in this work were identified by the
SUCEST (Sugarcane EST) Project. The SUCEST Project
[24] sequenced over 238,000 ESTs, which were grouped
into over 43,000 SAS (Sugarcane Assembled Sequences)
[25]. The SUCAST Project (Sugarcane Signal Transduction) [26,27] used BLAST searches, Pfam and SMART
domain analysis to identify conserved signal transduction
components such as receptors, adapters, G-proteins, small
GTPases, members of the two-component relay system,
nucleotide cyclases, protein kinases, protein phosphatases, elements of the ubiquitination machinery and
transcription factors. In addition, SAS that might be
involved in processes triggered by stress and pathogens or
play a role in growth and development were also catalogued. The combined analysis of the sugarcane EST data
bank, by means of an in depth annotation and gene archi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

tecture analysis, generated the SUCAST catalogue with
over 3,500 members including around 100 SAS for hormone biosynthesis and around 600 SAS with no similarities to known proteins, which were selected due to our
interest in associating function to new genes. These elements represent 5% of the total SAS from the current
SUCEST dataset.
To define the expression pattern of these genes in the various sugarcane tissues cDNA microarrays with 1,280 distinct elements were constructed. A total of 217 genes were
found to be differentially expressed when leaf, inflorescence, root, internode and lateral bud tissues were compared [27]. For this work, a new array was designed with
1,228 elements in common with the array used in the previous study [27] plus an additional 317 elements including 229 representatives of the sugarcane kinome. Overall,
50% of the SAS catalogued in each SUCAST category are
represented in the array that contains a total of 1,545
genes.
In the context of plant signal transduction, the role of protein kinases is remarkable. These proteins are responsible
for the post-translational control of target proteins, acting
as critical regulators of many signaling cascades. Moreover, many plant protein kinases act as receptors (named
RLKs, from Receptor-Like Kinases) and participate in
processes like disease resistance, growth, development,
hormone perception and stress responses [28]. Many protein kinases remain uncharacterized, especially those corresponding to RLKs. Of 1,031 protein kinases previously
catalogued by the SUCAST Project 39% could not be
assigned to known categories based on BLAST searches
and were annotated as undefined kinases. This work also
reports the categorization of sugarcane protein kinases
based on neighbor-joining (NJ) trees constructed from
the alignment of the predicted catalytic domain. The association of an expression pattern to the categories generated by the phylogenetic analysis is useful in guiding
studies on sugarcane kinases and other genes responsive
to environmental and hormonal stimuli.

Results
Gene Expression Changes in Response to Biotic and
Abiotic Stimuli
To identify genes regulated at the expression level by
biotic and abiotic factors sugarcane plants were exposed
to a variety of conditions that affect yield negatively
(drought, phosphate deficiency, herbivory) or positively
(endophytic bacteria interaction). Since a role for ABA
and jasmonates has been observed in the regulation of
plant stress responses in other plant systems [19,29-32],
plants were also exposed to these phytohormones.

To obtain gene expression patterns and identify differentially expressed genes cDNA microarrays representing
1,545 genes were co-hybridized to fluorescently labeled
probes generated from control and treated plants. The
great majority of the genes were selected from the SUCAST
Catalogue [26,27]. Some correspond to sugarcane metabolism genes indexed in the SUCAMET (Sugarcane Metabolism) Catalogue. Both catalogues can be found at [33].
The hybridizations were performed as shown in Table 1.
Cultivar SP80-3280 was used for the ABA, MeJA, phosphate deficiency and herbivory experiments. Cultivar
SP90-1638 was used for drought experiments and SP701143 for the endophytic bacteria interaction experiments.
To define differential expression we used the outliers
searching method [34].
A total of 179 genes were identified as differentially
expressed in both biological replicates in at least one of
the treatments. Of these, twenty-nine were found differentially expressed in two or more treatments. Most of these
(18) were responsive both to drought and phytohormones in agreement with the known role of ABA and
MeJA in drought responses as discussed in the next section.
Additional file 1: Table 1 lists the differential expression
(induction or repression) observed for each SAS in each
treatment as well as the corresponding SUCAST categories. All additional files may be found at [35]. For reference, the table also includes the tissue expression profile
for these genes in flowers, lateral buds, leaves, roots,
immature and mature internodes (1st and 4th internodes,
respectively) as published previously [27]. The log2 ratio
(M) values for the valid elements represented in our array
for all experiments are shown in additional file 2: Table 2.
Drought elicited changes were most apparent in the late
experimental data points (72 h and 120 h) as opposed to
the first data point (24 h): 88% of drought-responsive
genes were detected as differentially expressed exclusively
after 72 h and/or 120 h of water deprivation. Conversely,
the majority (78%) of the genes regulated by phosphate
deficiency were detected as differentially expressed in the
early data point (6 h). For the phytohormone treatments,
differential expression was found throughout the experimental time-course.
In addition to the analysis of differential expression using
the outliers searching method, the SOM algorithm [36]
was used to cluster the expression data for phytohormone
treatments, phosphate starvation and drought. Gene
expression profiles were compared between the two biological replicates. Profiles with a correlation coefficient of
0.7 or higher were identified for 158 genes in response to
ABA treatment, 68 in response to MeJA treatment, 146 for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

phosphate deficiency and 485 for drought. The clusters
obtained are partially shown in Figure 1 and additional
files 1 and 3. The components of the SOM groups are
available as additional files (see additional file 4: Table 4,
additional file 5: Table 5, additional file 6: Table 6 and
additional file 7: Table 7). Many of the genes included in
a SOM group showing evident induction or repression
patterns were not detected as being differentially
expressed according to the outliers searching method.
While the outliers searching method is based on criteria
that take into account the intensity-dependent effect on
the ratio values and data reproducibility, the clustering
analysis allows for the visualization of the expression pattern along the entire time course. For this reason, both
analysis were taken into account when defining sugarcane
genes responsive to these treatments.
The Sugarcane Kinome
Among the differentially expressed genes defined by the
outliers search method and the SOM groups we found
185 SAS belonging to the sugarcane kinome (additional
file 3: Table 3). Since 39% of SUCAST protein kinases
could not be classified based on BLAST similarities and
domain analysis we used a phylogenetic approach based
on the analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana protein kinases [37]
to annotate the sugarcane kinome.

Sugarcane protein kinases (277), RLKs (250) containing a
putative pkinase domain and protein kinases from other
organisms (156) were aligned using the neighbor-joining
algorithm. The term RLCK (Receptor-like Cytoplasmic
Kinase) was defined by [37] and refers to protein kinases
that, in spite of having a catalytic domain very similar to
the ones found for RLKs, apparently constitute cytoplasmic kinases. As it is known that RLKs/RLCKs form a
monophyletic gene family with respect to other eukaryotic kinase families [37] we opted to first construct a NJ tree
for sugarcane protein kinases, including only some representatives of the RLKs/RLCKs category, and then to obtain
a NJ tree for RLKs/RLCKs members. A summarized view of
the NJ trees obtained is depicted in Figure 2. A complete
view of the neighbor-joining (NJ) trees is shown in additional file 8: Figure 1 and additional file 9: Figure 2. Six
major groups were defined for protein kinases (KA, KB,
KC, KD, KE and KF) with group KA comprising the RLKs
and RLCKs representatives. Four groups were obtained
(RA, RB, RC and RD) for the RLKs/RLCKs.
We observed that some SAS with BLAST best hits similar
to undefined protein kinases and with no predicted transmembrane regions grouped with receptors and RLCKs in
the phylogenetic analysis. For this reason, we classified
these sequences as putative RLCKs instead of undefined
protein kinases. In fact, some of these sequences may represent novel types of RLCKs not yet characterized. On the

other hand, some of them may also be receptor-like
kinases with incomplete cDNAs, lacking the extracellular
domain and transmembrane region that would indicate
they are receptors.
All sugarcane protein kinases were classified in the
SUCAST database with the prefix cane followed by its
annotation and a continuous numeration. Each undefined protein kinase or RLK received a new classification,
based on the phylogenetic group and family to which it
belongs. All families constituted entirely by sugarcane
undefined protein kinases, RLKs or RLCKs, and supported
by a bootstrap value superior to 50% received a specific
nomenclature, as well as the SAS included within these
families (additional file 8: Figure 1 and additional file 9:
Figure 2). With this criterion, it was possible to define 6
families constituted entirely by undefined protein kinases
and 33 families constituted by undefined RLKs/RLCKs.

Validation of microarray data by real-time PCR
Twenty-two genes were selected to have their expression
data validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The primers
designed for these genes and the statistical analysis (probability Pr(sample>reference) and Pr(sample < reference)
for up- and down-regulated genes, respectively) of the
data are shown in additional file 10: Table 8. The expression profile along the whole time-course was analysed by
real-time PCR for phytohormone treatment samples. For
other treatments, reactions were carried out only for the
experimental point(s) in which the gene was detected as
being differentially expressed.

As reference genes for normalization we used a polyubiquitin gene for the ABA treatment and drought data, a
GAPDH gene for the MeJA treatment and herbivory data,
a 25S rRNA gene for endophytic inoculation and a 14-3-3
gene for the phosphate starvation data. The different references were selected for their unaltered expression in
each of the treatments. Curves (log fluorescence × cycles)

Phylogenetic analysis of sugarcane protein kinases (A) and RLKs/RLCKs (B). The predicted pkinase domains were aligned and
used to construct a distance tree with the NJ algorithm. Only some of the main representatives of the RLK/RLCK category
were included in the tree constructed for protein kinases (A). Driver sequences from other organisms were also included in
the analysis. The main components of each group are: KA: RLKs and RLCKs; KB: ATN1, CTR1, EDR1, Raf-like; KC: casein

particular experiment were evaluated. The polyubiquitin
and 14-3-3 genes were previously used as a reference for
the validation of expression levels in different sugarcane
tissues [27]. The GAPDH and 25S rRNA genes were
described as good references for sugarcane tissues and
genotypes [38]. The 25S rRNA primers used were 25S
rRNA1F and 25S rRNA1R [38].
A total of 36 results of differential expression were evaluated (additional file 10: Table 8). Of these, 80.5% had a
profile in real-time PCR assays consistent with the one
observed in the microarray experiments (probability
value of 0.99 or higher). Validated real-time PCR results
are depicted in Figure 3. It is important to emphasize that
the RNA samples used in the real-time PCR experiments
derived from a third biological sample and that the principles of real-time PCR techniques are different from the
ones applied in microarray experiments. The conflicting
results may correspond to biological variations in the
third biological replica or even to technical limitations of
the microarray method. Nevertheless, our analysis and
statistical methods were efficient in evaluating differentially expressed genes, yielding only a minor percentage of
unconfirmed expression data.

The SUCAST Database
A database containing all the SAS catalogued in the
SUCAST Project and their respective expression data was
built and is available at The SUCEST-FUN Database web
site [33]. The SUCEST-FUN database includes the expression data associated to stress responses and environmental stimuli and the expression profile of SUCAST SAS in six
different sugarcane tissues [27]. It also includes the
SUCAMET categories of sugarcane metabolism genes.

The SUCAST databank integrates the sequence data and
analysis from the SUCEST Project [25], the categorization
and tissue gene expression of signal transduction genes
[27] with the kinome analysis and gene expression data in
response to different treatments as pointed out by the outliers searching method, SOM and quantitative PCR analysis (this work).
The SUCAST system consists of a client web interface and
a server back end. The database was constructed using the
MySQL database server [39]. The scripts were written in
Perl [40] and R statistical language [41]. Through the web
interface, the SUCAST database can be easily queried to
find each SAS and its associated information. For each SAS
it is possible to retrieve the consensus sequence of the SAS

and the alignment of its corresponding reads, according to
the clusterization of SUCEST reads [25].
Besides expression data, the SUCAST database also provides, for each SAS queried, information regarding annotation, results of the blasts against the GenBank nr and the
NCBI GEO databases and comparisons with the Gene
Ontology database [42]. As of the time of submission
1,083 SAS showed similarity against sequences in NCBI
GEO database (using BLASTN tool, cutoff Evalue of 10-5).
Comparison of these SAS with the Gene Ontology database (using BLASTX tool, cutoff Evalue of e-5) revealed significant matching with proteins for 3,030 SAS.
Over 3,600 SAS are compiled in the SUCAST database. It
is possible to retrieve the predicted protein sequence
encoded by the consensus sequence as well as information on conserved protein domains predicted by the Pfam
[43] databank. The SUCAST elements are distributed into
46 main categories subdivided into 1,678 subcategories.
The database also includes 405 SUCAST SAS that present
no matches with existing protein sequences in the GenBank nr database (using BLASTX tool, cutoff E value of 105).

Discussion
Identification of sugarcane genes responsive to biotic and
abiotic stimuli
In an effort to associate gene expression changes to environmental factors that may affect sugarcane yield we profiled the expression of 1,545 sugarcane genes in response
to drought, phosphate deficiency, herbivory and endophytic bacteria. We also analysed the responses of plants
to ABA and MeJA treatments. The 1,545 genes selected are
representative of all categories found in the SUCAST Catalogue. The outliers searching method has proved to be a
robust way of differential expression analysis that considers the overall dispersion of signal intensity and provides
reliable gene expression differences. A complementary
approach useful to highlight the patterns observed and to
include data points where differential expression was not
striking was the selection of patterns highly correlated
among biological replicates and their grouping by the
SOM algorithm. This approach increased the number of
genes analysed and confirmed the differences observed
through the use of the outliers searching method. For
instance, there were three histone genes (two H4 histone
and one H2B histone) in SOM group B1 of genes up-regulated by MeJA. Only one of the H4 histone genes was
detected as being up-regulated by MeJA exposure (after 12
h) according to the outliers searching method. This exemplifies the usefulness of the SOM analysis in addition to
the outliers analysis of differentially expressed genes,
revealing two additional histones induced by MeJA. Probably, the values of log2 ratio (M) for these SAS were not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

enough to surpass the intensity-dependent cutoff levels
that indicated differential expression, but the SOM analysis revealed that these SAS apparently were responsive to
the MeJA treatment.
From the 179 genes detected as differentially expressed,
113 were also included in at least one of the SOM clustering analysis performed (additional file 1: Table 1). Some
had their expression patterns evaluated by real-time PCR
along the entire time course of phytohormone treatment
(SCBGLR1023D05.g [CA117725], SCJLHR1028C12.g
[CA106117],
SCEQRT1024E12.g
[CA132523],
SCQGLR1062E12.g [CA124203] and SCRULR1020D11.g
[CA125940]) and presented consistent results.
Analysis of sugarcane genes responsive to phytohormones
and environmental challenges
Tissue expression data was obtained for most genes of the
array in a previous study where samples extracted from six
different sugarcane tissues were hybridized against a common reference sample [27]. These studies indicated 217
genes differentially expressed in at least one of the tissues
tested and 153 genes evenly expressed in all tissues.
Among the 179 differentially expressed genes detected in
the present study, 70 correspond to tissue-enriched genes.
Most of them (19) are leaf-enriched, but there were also
genes that were expressed preferentially in sugarcane roots
(12) and internodes (11). While these are interesting
observations, it is important to emphasize that they
should be considered with caution, since the experiments
reported here used plantlets cultivated under growth
chamber or greenhouse conditions while in our previous
studies most of the samples were collected from 12- or 14month-old plants cultivated in the field.

Water deprivation was the condition that elicited the
majority of gene expression changes. Fifty-two percent of
the 179 differentially expressed genes were responsive to
drought. Many studies have reported the identification of
genes regulated by drought and altered expression of transcription factors. Specific recognition sequences for some
categories of transcription factors were detected in the
promoter of drought-responsive genes, as is the case of
MYC and MYB recognition sequences and the W-box for
WRKY transcription factors [44,45]. We observed the
induction of one MYB and two WRKY transcription factors in response to drought (group D4).
Many of the genes responsive to drought are similar to
genes that in other systems have been shown to transduce
additional stress signals including cold. The cold and
drought signaling pathways present a high degree of overlap and many of the responses are mediated by ABA [46].
Four SAS encoding low temperature induced (LTI) proteins were up-regulated in response to lack of water. Two

The ratios were calculated in relation to the sample from untreated plants (0h). Transcript levels of the selected genes were

drought (D), phosphate starvation (E) and herbivory (F). For these treatments, the real-time PCR reactions were carried out
exclusively for the experimental point(s) in which the gene was considered differentially expressed. Only validated results are
shown here. The RNA samples used in the real-time PCR experiments are from a third biological sample. All reactions were
carried out in parallel and each reaction was performed in triplicates. Error bars were calculated as described previously [135].

in response to the treatments. The reference genes used encode a polyubiquitin gene (SCCCST2001G02.g [CA179923]) for
the ABA and drought dataset, a GAPDH for the MeJA and herbivory dataset (retrieved from [38]), a 25S rRNA for the endophytic inoculation (retrieved from [38]) and a 14-3-3 gene (SCCCLR1048F12.g [CA119519]) for phosphate starvation

of these SAS (SCUTST3084F06.g [CA186860] and
SCACCL6008H06.g [CA096029], group D1, Figure 1) are
grouped with genes induced by water deprivation. Many
genes co-regulated in response to drought and cold in Arabidopsis [47] have a DRE (Dehydration-Responsive Element) motif or DRE-related motifs in their promoters. A
transcription factor (SCBGLR1002A09.g [CA117666])
from the AP2 family and homologous to rice DREB2
(DRE binding factor 2) [AAP70033] was induced after 72
h of watering suppression and may represent an important transcription factor for the regulation of sugarcane
drought responsive genes. The overexpression of a constitutive active form of DREB2A [O82132] in Arabidopsis
thaliana led to the development of transgenic plants more
tolerant to drought [48]. Hence, the manipulation of
DREB2 levels in sugarcane may represent a way of obtaining new varieties with increased resistance to water deficit.
Genes induced by ABA and drought include two delta-12
oleate desaturase (SCCCLR1C03G01.g [CA189695] and
SCVPST1061G05.g [CA179715]), one S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SCCCLR1C05G07.g [CA189868])
and
one
PP2C-like
protein
phosphatase
(SCEPRZ1010E06.g [CA147516]) homologous to Arabidopsis protein phosphatases ABI1 and ABI2. The protein
phosphatases ABI1 and ABI2 are responsive to ABA and
regulate a range of physiological responses, including stomatal closure, which minimizes the transpirational water
loss [49,50]. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases participate in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, which is
modulated in response to abiotic stresses [51].
SCCCLR1C05G07.g [CA189868] is homologous to the Sadenosylmethionine
decarboxylase
SAMDC1
[AF067194], from rice, known to accumulate in response
to salinity and drought, probably through ABA-dependent
pathways and with an expression positively correlated
with salt tolerance [52]. The regulation of fatty acid desaturases (FAD2) may be related to changes in the degree of
fatty acid desaturation in response to environmental
stresses. FAD3, FAD7 and FAD8 desaturases expression is
directly related to drought tolerance. A role of an omega3 fatty acid desaturase in drought tolerance was reported
in tobacco through overexpression [53] and gene silencing [54] studies. Additionally, it was demonstrated that
the reduction in trienoic fatty acid levels by the antisense
expression of the fad7 [D26019] gene seems to affect the
ABF (ABA responsive elements Binding Factor)-dependent gene expression showing a relationship between
desaturases levels and ABA-signaling pathways [54]. Thus,
the regulation of the sugarcane delta-12 oleate desaturases
by ABA and drought may indicate that these genes are
induced by drought and that this induction alters ABA signaling pathways.
A total of 31 differentially expressed genes were found in
plants treated with ABA. Fifty-eight percent of these are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

exclusively regulated after 12 h of treatment with this hormone, indicating the existence of early and late response
genes in the time course of our experiment. Among the
ABA-responsive genes, we could observe the induction of
a gene (SCCCLR1C07B07.g [CA189990]) encoding a glycine-rich protein with a predicted RNA recognition motif.
The function of this class of proteins is not clear [55,56]
but it is known that some of them play an important role
in RNA turnover [57]. A Sorghum bicolor gene [AF310215]
similar to SCCCLR1C07B07.g [CA189990] was induced
by ABA treatment, light and salinity [58]. The maize
MA16 protein is also an example of an RNA-binding protein induced by ABA [19,59].
Several regulators of ABA signaling pathways are
described and characterized [19]. Among these, the
ROP10 small GTPase [NP_566897] from the Rab family
in Arabidopsis was implicated in the down-regulation of
the ABA signal transduction pathway [60]. Our analysis
revealed
two
GTPases
similar
to
Rab11
(SCACCL6006D08.g [CA095849] and SCJFRT1059D05.g
[CA134244]) induced after exposure to this hormone.
The OsRab7 GTPase from rice [AAO67728] [61] and the
Rab2 GTPase [AAD30658] from Sporobolus stapfianus [62]
were also described as regulated by ABA. These observations point to an involvement of different Rab GTPases in
the cellular responses activated by this hormone.
Among the genes up-regulated by MeJA treatment there
were two H4 histones and one H2B histone genes in SOM
group B1. The H4 histone SCCCLR2002G09.g
[CA127138] was also identified as up-regulated after 12 h
of MeJA exposure by the outliers searching method. It has
been reported that jasmonates may regulate gene expression by interfering with histone acetylation and deacetylation since COI1 [O04197], an F-box protein required for
jasmonates responses was able to target an Arabidopsis histone deacetylase to proteolysis [23]. Furthermore, Kim
and colleagues [63] observed the induction of histones
CaH2B [AF038386] and CaH4 [AF038387] from Capsicum annuum by MeJA. The regulation of histone transcript
levels in sugarcane points towards chromatin remodeling
as a possible event activated by jasmonates which may
represent an important mechanism through which jasmonates regulate the expression of target genes.
A comparison of sugarcane and rice [64] ABA responsive
genes indicates that a fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
(SCRULR1020D11.g
[CA125940]),
a
glyoxalase
(SCQGLR1062E12.g [CA124203]) and a RUBISCO gene
(SCCCLR1001E04.g [CA116155]) are induced by ABA in
both grasses. The sugarcane fructose-bisphosphate aldolase induced by ABA is similar to the NpAldP1 [AB027001]
gene expressed in Nicotiana paniculata leaves and
repressed in response to saline stress [65]. The sugarcane

Page 10 of 22

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:71

aldolase gene was also regulated by drought and MeJA
treatments (additional file 1: Table 1, Figure 1 groups A3
and D6) and according to our previous work [27] this SAS
is enriched in sugarcane leaves. This suggests a potential
role of this gene in signaling pathways specific of this
organ. Another SAS encoding an aldolase seems to be
slightly induced by ABA treatment (Figure 1, group A2).
The analysis of transcripts levels for genes of the glycolytic
and fermentation pathways in rice roots and shoots indicated the induction of an aldolase gene in response to
saline stress [66]. In another work, an Arabidopsis aldolase
gene was repressed by ABA [20]. A wealth of evidence has
accumulated throughout the years revealing important
interactions between sugar- and phytohormone pathways
[67]. Additionally, ABA is implicated in the regulation of
sugar transport and metabolism. The regulation of glycolytic enzymes by stressful conditions and the consequences of this regulation are particularly interesting for
sugarcane, since these findings may indicate a relationship between sucrose accumulation and responses to
stresses.
The identification of differential expression for genes with
no homologs in the public databases ("no matches") as
well as of SAS coding for unknown proteins is particularly
valuable for the identification of their putative roles. We
obtained 28 "no matches" differentially expressed in at
least one of the experiments analysed. Of these, 13 are regulated by drought, 7 by inoculation with Herbaspirillum, 5
by ABA treatment, 4 by MeJA treatment, 3 by herbivory
and 3 by phosphate starvation. Four of these are leafenriched genes. One of them was induced by both inoculation with N2-fixing endophytic bacteria and exposure to
insect attack. This may indicate a possible role for this
gene in general mechanisms of defense against biotic
stimuli, including endophytic recognition and the activation of defense responses until the establishment of an
efficient association. It is also interesting to point out that
five of these 28 no matches genes do not present a predicted coding region and may represent non-coding transcripts. Recent studies have established important roles
for some plant microRNAs in the regulation of processes
like development, response to pathogens and hormone
signaling [68]. Among the SUCEST sequences, 239 noncoding no matches were identified. Through the present
studies we see an indication that five of them may have a
role in stress responses since drought regulated three of
them, methyl jasmonate treatment regulated one and
inoculation with Herbaspirillum spp regulated another.
Phosphate starvation altered the expression of 14 genes.
The majority of them (11) showed decreased levels after 6
hours of starvation. Expression data indicates that during
this early phase of the stress response an alteration in protein N-glycosylation may occur, as can be inferred from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

the repression of a gene coding for an N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase (SCRUFL1112F04.b
[CA249652]). The decreased expression of two genes coding for thioredoxins (SCCCLR2001H09.g [CA127047]
and SCJFLR1073B06.g [CA122039]) indicates there are
changes in the redox state of sugarcane roots in response
to phosphate starvation, since these enzymes are important regulators of the intracellular redox status [69]. A
gene similar to MYB transcription factors had transcript
levels reduced. Several members of this gene family show
distinct expression profiles in response to phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis, some of them being up-regulated
and some down-regulated [70]. It is worth to note that the
promoter region of the oat homolog of this gene
(MybHv1) [X70879] has been characterized and shown to
be active only in the root apex [71]. Alterations in the
expression of root apex enriched genes could be related to
the morphological changes observed in the root system in
response to low levels of P.
Even though the plant-endophytic association is advantageous for both organisms, it is believed that sugarcane
plants recognize these microorganisms and activate
defense responses until the establishment of an efficient
association [72]. In agreement with this, four R-genes
were found among the genes responsive to the endophytic
association. Plant disease resistance (R) genes mediate
specific recognition of pathogens via perception of avirulence (avr) gene products [73]. Two of them were induced
by both associations under study (sugarcane-Herbaspirillum spp and sugarcane-Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus).
The inoculation with Gluconacetobacter also led to the
induction of a salicylic acid biosynthesis gene. The phytohormone salicylic acid accumulates in plant tissues in
response to pathogen attack and is essential for the induction of systemic acquired resistance and for some
responses mediated by resistance genes [74-76].
A PP2C (SCJLRZ3077G10.g [CA160745]) was up-regulated in plants inoculated with Gluconacetobacter. Also,
expression of five transcription factors was altered when
the plants were cultivated in association with endophytic
bacteria. Among these, there were two zinc-finger transcription factors (SCEQRT1033F01.g [CA133313] and
SCEZST3147A10.g [CA182656]), one of which was upregulated by inoculation with either Gluconacetobacter or
Herbaspirillum. In agreement with our data, a possible role
for phosphatases and zinc-finger transcription factors in
response to endophytic bacteria has also been pointed out
by the in silico analysis of the SUCEST Project libraries,
that identified SAS corresponding to these categories
exclusively or preferentially expressed in the SUCEST
cDNA libraries constructed from plants inoculated with
Gluconacetobacter and Herbaspirillum [77].

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:71

Expression data for the herbivory experiment points to the
strong induction of a pathogenesis-related protein similar
to a thaumatin after 24 h of the onset of this stress. This is
not surprising, since it is known that proteins from this
category are important for plant defense mechanisms and
may present antifungal action, endo-β1,3-glucanase activity and trypsin or a-amylase inhibitory activity [78,79].
Further characterization of this sugarcane thaumatin-like
protein should be carried out in order to define its activity
and the defense mechanism that this protein may confer
against the sugarcane stalk borer.
Sugarcane-responsive genes related to hormone
biosynthesis and signaling
Phytohormone signaling pathways exhibit a wide degree
of cross-talk among their components creating a complex
network of overlapping signaling [80,81]. Interactions
among phytohormone signaling pathways are highly
complex and the features of these interactions are time
and space dependent. Although we are only beginning to
outline signaling cross-talks in sugarcane, the analysis of
the expression profiles of the differentially expressed
genes obtained (additional file 1: Table 1) as well as the
groups obtained in the clustering analysis (Figure 1 and
additional files 4, 5, 6, 7) uncover some aspects of these
interactions. Auxin signal transduction pathways appear
to be activated in response to several of the treatments
studied. ABA treatment elicited an antagonistic response
between the ABA and auxin pathways. A gene
(SCCCCL3002B05.b [CA093260]) coding for a protein
similar to the auxin responsive protein GH3 [82] was
found repressed by ABA (group A4). Furthermore, a gene
(SCCCLR2002F08.g [CA127125]) coding for a protein
with a predicted auxin repressed domain found in dormancy-associated- and auxin-repressed proteins [83] was
up-regulated by this hormone (group A6). It has been
shown that ABA and auxin interact antagonistically to regulate stomatal aperture [84] and the interaction between
auxin and ABA signaling pathways has been demonstrated by the dual specificity of the ABI3 transcription factor, which is able to bind sequences upstream of ABA and
auxin responsive genes. In the presence of ABA, ABI3
binds to the GH3 like promoter sequences and inhibits
the auxin-mediated induction [85].

Auxins have been implicated in several aspects of the
drought response including proline accumulation [86],
rhizogenesis [87] and indole 3-butyric acid increases [88].
Our data also indicate auxin signaling in response to
drought. We observed the induction of genes encoding
auxin biosynthesis enzymes (nitrilases) after 72 h of water
deprivation and the down-regulation of transcription factors from the Aux/IAA category after 120 h of drought.
These transcription factors work by inhibiting auxin signaling and are rapidly induced by auxin exposure [89,90].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

However, Aux/IAA accumulation is subject to negative
feedback, since auxins target Aux/IAA for degradation by
the 26S proteasome [90]. Groups D1 and D2 contain two
nitrilases and one auxin-binding protein (ABP). Additionally, one auxin response factor is induced by drought
(group D4) and four AUX/IAA transcription factors are
modulated (groups D2, D3 and D6).
Phosphate starvation leads to alterations in root architecture, resulting in increased soil exploration and phosphate
acquisition. In this process of morphological adaptation,
auxins and other phytohormones play important roles in
root elongation and lateral root development [91]. LópezBucio and colleagues [92] showed that phosphate deprivation increases auxin sensitivity in Arabidopsis, what may
explain the increased number of lateral roots observed
when the plant is under nutritional stress. In agreement
with this observation, the auxin-repressed protein found
in group A6 (SCCCLR2002F08.g [CA127125]) was
repressed after 6 h of phosphate starvation. This same SAS
was also down-regulated by MeJA treatment what may
indicate a possible synergism among MeJA and auxin
pathways. Even though the majority of interactions
between MeJA and auxins are antagonistics, there is evidence that these hormones may act synergistically at the
post-transcriptional level [93]. It is hypothesized that,
since COI1 and TIR1, components of SCF (SKP1,
CDC53p, CUL1, F-box protein) complexes associated to
jasmonate- and auxin-responses, respectively, are highly
similar, these two signaling pathways may converge to the
degradation of common target regulatory proteins [93].
Phosphate starvation also causes a reduction in the
expression of a gene (SCEZLB1009A09.g [CA113117])
similar to BLE1 from rice. Rice plants where the gene
OsBle1 [AB072977] was knocked-out showed reduced
growth rates [94]. The repression of the sugarcane
homolog of OsBle1 in the early phase of phosphate starvation could be an effort to restrain metabolism as occurs in
Arabidopsis in response to low levels of the nutrient [70].
Another hormone signaling pathway that seems to be
altered in response to phosphate starvation is the ethylene
response pathway, since a gene for the EIL transcription
factor (SCBGFL4052C11.g [CA221542]) is down-regulated after 6 h of starvation. The rice homolog of this protein, OsEIL1 [AAZ78349], acts as a positive regulator of
the ethylene response and transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsEIL1 exhibit short root, coiled primary root,
slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to
exogenous ethylene [95]. The down-regulation of this
transcription factor could be related to the changes in root
architecture that occur in response to phosphate starvation.

The Sugarcane Protein Kinases and RLKs
Detailed descriptions of yeast, Drosophila, C.elegans and
human kinomes are available [96,97] as well as studies on
plant kinases [28,37,98]. Since plant protein kinases and
RLKs act as critical regulators of many signaling pathways,
they represent important targets to modify pathways of
interest.

Eight protein kinases were differentially expressed in
response to plant inoculation with N2-fixing bacteria.
Three of these are similar to proteins involved in calcium
signaling, a calcium-dependent protein kinase (caneCDPK-9) and two calcineurin B-like interacting protein
kinases (caneCIPK-18 and caneCIPK-22) of the SnRK3
subgroup of plant kinases [99,100]. Some reports have
shown the role of calcium-dependent pathways in the
processes of symbiosis and nodulation [101-104]. CDPKs
may participate in pathogen defense signaling pathways,
as seen in the tomato defense responses against the fungi
Cladosporium fulvum [105]. We also observed the induction of a sugarcane gene similar to a GSK3/shaggy protein
(caneGSK3-5) kinase by endophytic bacteria association.
In plants, these kinases are associated to floral development, brassinosteroid signaling pathways and responses
to stresses such as wounding and salinity [106]. Moreover,
one PBS1-like protein kinase (canePBS1-4) had its transcripts increased in response to the association. The Arabidopsis PBS1 [NP_196820] protein recognizes avirulence
factors from Pseudomonas syringae [107]. The transcriptional regulation of this gene in sugarcane inoculated with
N2-fixing bacteria suggests a possible role for this protein
in the recognition of these microorganisms.
The role of some receptors in the regulation of symbiosis
has been described [108-110]. Our data indicates the
induction of a putative receptor with predicted leucin-rich
repeats (caneURLK-13) in plants inoculated with Herbaspirillum that may be regulating such an interaction.
Recently, a sugarcane receptor (SHR5) [AAY67902] was
shown to be repressed in plants associated with endophytic bacteria and the degree of this repression was
directly related to the success of the sugarcane-endophytic
bacteria association, indicating a participation of this
receptor in signal transduction pathways involved in the
establishment of plant-endophytic bacteria interaction
[72].
We identified ten protein kinases differentially expressed
in response to drought. Seven of them are similar to the
SnRK family of proteins. Four were induced by this stress
(caneOsmotic stress-activated protein kinase-2, caneCIPK-8, caneCIPK-13 and caneCIPK-14). Some SnRKs are
recognized players in stress responses. SRK2C leads to
improved drought tolerance when overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana [111]. Mutagenesis studies on OST1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

[NP_567945], a kinase whose activity is induced by
drought, led to guard-cell specific effects and ABA insensitivity [9,112]. Other works describing the function of this
family of protein kinases in drought responses include a
role in stomatal closure [113-115]. Furthermore, among
the drought responses, the Ca2+-dependent SOS signaling
pathway (which involves SOS2, a SnRK similar to the
CIPKs) has an important role in regulating ion homeostasis [116]. Since sos2 [NM_122932] mutants are hypersensitive to saline stress [117] it will be interesting to
complement our studies with a phenotypic evaluation of
plants altered for caneCIPK-8, caneCIPK-13 or caneCIPK14 genes to confirm a role for these kinases in drought
responses.
Among the differentially expressed genes, six undefined
kinases/RLKs (caneRLCK-AVI2, caneRLCK-DII3, canePKBIII3, caneRLK-AX1, caneRLK-AX2 and caneRLK-C5) were
regulated by drought, inoculation with Herbaspirillum spp.
and/or phytohormone treatments and 64 undefined
kinases/RLKs were selected for the SOM clustering analysis. Six protein kinases that grouped within the same phylogenetic family in group KE have very similar catalytic
domains, with an insertion of around 80 aminoacids
between subdomains VII and VIII, as defined by Hanks et
al. [118-120]. These proteins are similar to the protein
kinase G11A from rice [AAA33905] [121]. One of these
SAS (caneG11A kinase-2) was included in SOM group A2
and two of them (caneG11A kinase-3 and caneG11A
kinase-5), in group D2, with an apparent expression profile of induction by ABA or drought, respectively. It may
be of interest to evaluate potential targets of these uncharacterized protein kinases and also to investigate if the
sequence between subdomains VII and VIII plays a role in
substrate recognition or catalytic reaction.
It is important to emphasize that our phylogenetic analysis has limitations imposed by the fact we are dealing with
an EST databank. For example, many putative sugarcane
protein kinases were excluded from our analysis since the
available sequences do not present most of the pkinase
subdomains. Even though, the groups obtained are in
good agreement with the classes, groups and families of
plant protein kinases previously defined by the PlantsP
database, despite differences in their classification methodology [122].

Conclusion
In this work, the expression of 1,545 sugarcane SAS
(mostly related to signal transduction components) was
evaluated by cDNA microarrays in plants submitted to a
variety of challenges: drought, phosphate starvation, herbivory by Diatraea saccharalis and endophytic bacteria
inoculation (Herbaspirillum seropedicae/Herbaspirillum
rubrisubalbicans and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus).

Additionally, plants were treated with the phytohormones
ABA and MeJA, important players in the responses to
biotic and abiotic stresses.
To our knowledge, this is the first broad evaluation of sugarcane gene expression in response to biotic, abiotic and
hormone inputs. Since ABA and MeJA play main roles in
plant responses to a plethora of stimuli the analysis of
genes regulated by these hormones is helpful in deciphering sugarcane defense pathways activated in response to
stresses. Many of the differentially expressed genes belong
to protein families described in the literature as associated
to some of the processes studied, indicating that sugarcane responses are similar to those of other well-known
plants, such as rice, maize and Arabidopsis. Additionally,
functions were associated to genes poorly studied or novel
genes such as genes with no hits in the public databases,
genes encoding unknown proteins and undefined
kinases/RLKs. The information generated by the protein
kinase categorization using a phylogenetic approach,
associated to the expression data obtained from microarray experiments, represents a useful tool in guiding the
future characterization of these proteins.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind sugarcane stress responses will be useful for the improvement
of sugarcane yield by genetic manipulation. This knowledge, allied to the use of genetic engineering, will potentially enable the development of sugarcane varieties
tolerant to adverse conditions, such as drought and nutritional deficiency. Furthermore, the genes may be explored
as molecular markers in traditional breeding programs or
have their promoters cloned to accomplish transgene
expression activated solely by a specific stimulus. It is
important to emphasize the limitations intrinsic to the
nature of the data presented. First, changes in mRNA levels do not always correlate to protein levels. Second, in the
field, plants are exposed to a diversity of stressful conditions and the responses achieved by this combination of
stimuli probably are not the same as the ones triggered by
each individual stimulus. Nonetheless, the data generated
in controlled experiments certainly represent an important step in the exploration of specific responses. The data
also points candidates for gene silencing or overexpression experiments that may corroborate the hypothesis
raised. With this in mind an expression panel is currently
being constructed for several additional sugarcane cultivars tolerant or more susceptible to the stimuli that certainly will be valuable in guiding the selection of target
genes. It will be important to expand the present studies
to additional genotypes also if one wishes to compare the
responses elicited by the different stimuli. The data
obtained may reflect cultivar specific responses in the case
of drought and endophytic bacteria interaction, since different cultivars were used in these experiments. The extent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

of genotypic variation among commercial cultivars is currently unknown. Evaluation of sugarcane responses in
additional genotypes is underway to further validate commonly regulated pathways.
A databank was created that provides public access to the
data described in this work, associated to tissue expression
profiling and the SUCAST gene categories. As the SUCAST
Project is an ongoing effort that aims to identify sugarcane
signaling components and define their role in grasses, the
database is expected to be updated each time new expression data from experiments with the SUCAST arrays are
available. We expect the SUCAST database to become a
useful tool for sugarcane transcriptome data mining and
in guiding the selection of target genes to be modified in
sugarcane and other grasses.

Methods
Plant material and cultivation
The cultivar SP90-1638 (Internal Technical Report, CTC,
2002), sensitive to drought, was used for the water deprivation experiments. The cultivar SP80-3280 sensitive to
herbivory by Diatraea saccharalis [123] was adopted for
the herbivory experiments. The same cultivar was used for
phosphate deficiency and phytohormone treatment
experiments. The cultivar SP70-1143 with high inputs of
nitrogen obtained from BNF and with efficient association with endophytic bacteria [124] was used for inoculation with Gluconacetobacter and Herbaspirillum.

Sugarcane plantlets obtained from one-eyed seed sets
were used for methyljasmonate treatment, water stress
and herbivory experiments. For methyljasmonate treatments, one-eyed seed sets were planted in 200 ml plastic
cups containing a commercial planting mix (Plantmax,
Eucatex) for 20 days under greenhouse conditions and
subsequently transferred to a growth chamber at 26°C on
a 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle with a photon flux density of
70 μE.m-2.s-1 to acclimate for 48 h. For the insect attack
assays, one-eyed seed sets were planted in 200 ml plastic
cups as described above and maintained in the greenhouse for 60 days when they were transferred to a growth
chamber at 28°C on a 14 h/8 h light/dark cycle with a
photon flux density of 70 μE.m-2.s-1. Sugarcane one-eyed
seed sets were cultivated on moist sand for 15 days prior
to drought experiments. For ABA treatment, plants
derived from shoot apex of 2-month-old sugarcane plants
were axenically in vitro cultivated for approximately three
months in a growth chamber at 26°C on a 16 h/8 h light/
dark cycle with a photon flux density of 70 μE.m-2.s-1. Sugarcane rooted plantlets obtained by sterile in vitro meristem culture and micropropagated according to the
method of Hendre et al. [125] were used for nutritional
deficiency and inoculation with endophytic bacteria
experiments.

Plant treatments
Plant treatments are described below. Three biological
replicates were performed for each of these treatments.
Two of the replicates were used for microarray experiments and one for real-time PCR reactions.
MeJA treatment
Plantlets were sprayed with a 100 μmol.L-1 MeJA solution
(Bedoukian Research Inc., Danbury, CT), whereas control
plantlets were treated with distilled water. Leaves were collected 0, 1, 6 and 12 h after exposure to MeJA and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Six plantlets were
sampled for each time point.
ABA treatment
ABA (Sigma Chem. Co) was added to the culture medium
to a final concentration of a 100 μmol.L-1 whereas control
plants were treated with distilled water. Leaves were collected 0, 0.5, 1, 6 and 12 h after exposure to ABA and
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Six plantlets were
sampled for each time point.
Phosphate deficiency
Rooted plantlets were greenhouse acclimatized by initial
cultivation on 1/20th strength Hoagland and Arnon [126]
nutrient solution. Nutrient solutions were replaced every
7 days increasing nutrient concentration to 1/4 strength in
3 weeks. Subsequently, plants were transferred to 2.8 L
pots filled with fresh 1/4 strength nutrient solution. After
one week, half of the plants were transferred to fresh solution containing 250 μM Pi, while the other half was transferred to nutrient solution deprived of phosphate (Pi),
with H2PO4 being replaced by H2SO4 [127]. Roots from
each treatment (0 and 250 μM Pi) were harvested 6, 12, 24
and 48 h after the onset of phosphate starvation and
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For each time
point, root samples of two plants were pooled.
Plant-N2-fixing endophytic bacteria association
Plantlets were inoculated as described [128] with 0.1 ml
of a 106 107 cells/mL bacterial suspension. Controls were
inoculated with medium only. The endophytic diazotrophic bacteria used were Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus
(PAL5 strain) or a mixture of Herbaspirillum seropedicae
(HRC54 strain) and H. rubrisubalbicans (HCC103 strain).
All plants were maintained at 30°C with a photon flux
density of 60 μE.m-2.s-1 for 12 h d-1. One day after the
inoculation, plant tissues were examined for bacterial colonization by the Most Probable Number (MPN) estimation [129] and plantlets were collected and immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Five plantlets were pooled for
each treatment.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

Herbivory by Diatraea saccharalis
Sugarcane stalk borer larvae were grown on an artificial
diet [130] and maintained at 25°C and 60 ± 10% relative
humidity with a 14 h/10 h light/dark cycle. Second instar
larvae were maintained under fasting conditions for 18 h
prior to transfer. After transferring to plantlets, larvae were
observed for a period of two hours to ensure complete
boring into the sugarcane stalk. Control plantlets were
kept unattacked. After 0.5 and 24 h of exposure to herbivory, plantlets were cut at the stalk/root zone and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For each treatment, two
plantlets were used for each time point.
Drought
The plants were transferred to pots containing moist sand,
irrigated with Hoagland's solution [126] and maintained
under greenhouse conditions. Regular watering was controlled using a Livingstone atmometer [131] and maintained for 90 days, being suppressed after this period for
the experimental group. To control for water loss, soil
samples were collected and the humid weight of each soil
sample was compared with its dried weight, in order to
verify the hydric loss in experimental plants. Aerial parts
of the plants were collected 24, 72 and 120 h after the
onset of drought for the control and experimental groups.
Samples were collected and immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen. For each treatment, aerial parts of six plants were
used for each time point.
RNA extraction
Frozen tissues were grinded using a homogenizer. Tissue
samples of 2–2.5 g were weighted and grinded to a fine
powder, in liquid nitrogen, using a pre-cooled mortar and
pestle. The pulverized tissue was transferred to a 50 ml
tube and homogenized with 5 ml Trizol (Invitrogen) per
gram of tissue according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of warm diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, vortexing gently for
about 15 min. RNA samples were quantified in a spectrophotometer and loaded on 1% agarose/formaldehyde
gels for quality inspection.
PCR amplification and array printing
cDNA microarray experiments were conducted essentially
as reported previously [27]. Sugarcane cDNA plasmid
clones obtained from the SUCEST collection were rearranged and amplified in 100 μl PCR reactions (40
cycles, annealing at 51°C), directly from bacterial clones
in culture, using T7 and SP6 primers. PCR products were
purified by filtration using 96 well filter plates (Millipore
Multiscreen MAFBN0B50). Samples were visualized on
1% agarose gels to inspect PCR-amplification quality and
quantity. Purified PCR products (in 10 mM Tris-HCl solution at pH 8.0) were mixed with an equal volume of
DMSO in 384 well V-bottom plates. Microarrays were

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:71

constructed by arraying cDNA fragments on DMSO optimized metal-coated glass slides (type 7, GE Healthcare)
using the Generation III Microarray Spotter (Molecular
Dynamics). Each cDNA fragment was spotted on the
slides at least twice (i.e., technical replicates). Following
printing, the slides were allowed to dry and the spotted
DNA was bound to the slides by UV-cross linking (50 mJ).
Hybridization and selection of differentially expressed
genes
Ten to fifteen micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed, labeled, and hybridized using the reagents provided with the CyScribe Post-Labeling kit (GE Healthcare)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The products of the labeling reactions were purified in Millipore
Multiscreen filtering plates to remove unincorporated
labeled nucleotides. Microarrays were co-hybridized with
the fluorescently labeled probes. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 42°C in humid chambers. The slides
were then washed in 1× SSC and 0.2% SDS (10 min,
55°C), twice in 0.1× SSC and 0.2% SDS (10 min, 55°C),
and in 0.1 × SSC (1 min, RT). Slides were rinsed briefly in
filtered milli-Q water and dried with a nitrogen stream.
Each experimental step was carefully monitored to ensure
high quality of the slides and extracted data. Slides were
scanned using the Generation III Scanner (Molecular
Dynamics) adjusting the photomultiplier tube (PMT) to
700 for both channels.

The microarray designed was composed of 1,830 genes
selected from the SUCAST Catalogue. Hybridizations
were carried out as depicted in Table 1. Two biological
replicates were used for each microarray experiment. The
1,830 unique genes represented yielded 1,545 good-quality PCR fragments.
Images were processed and data collected using the ArrayVision (Imaging Research Inc.) software. Local median
background was subtracted from the MTM (median-based
trimmed mean) density for each spot [27]. Data from
clones that generated poor-quality PCR fragments (no
amplification or unspecific bands) or relative to saturated,
low-intensity or poor-quality spots (visually inspected)
were excluded.
The fluorescence ratios were visualized and normalized in
the MxS space, where M is the base 2 logarithm of the
intensities ratio and S is the base 2 logarithm of the average intensity of each spot. The M values were normalized
to account for systematic errors using the LOWESS fitting
[132]. The raw and normalized data are publicly available
according to the MIAME guidelines at the GEO database
under the accession numbers GSE4966 to GSE4971. Differentially expressed genes were defined as the extreme
outliers in each experiment, using an intensity-dependent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

strategy modified from the HT-self method [133] and
described in [34]. This method defines an intensitydependent cutoff curve using the data from each hybridization, detecting non-parametrically genes with the greatest log-ratio changes (outliers) regardless of the absolute
value of the log-ratio measurement. We defined as differentially expressed a gene that has at least 60% of their replicate-points above or below the cutoff curve in the two
hybridizations of the biological vs. controls samples, indicating a reproducible result between the biological replicates. The number of technical replicates ranges from 2 to
16 since genes are spotted several times in the same array.
The credibility level used to define outliers was 0.8.
Clustering of expression data using Self Organizing Maps
(SOM)
Biologically reproducible expression profiles were clustered with the Self Organizing Maps (SOM) method [36]
using the Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics
software (Spotfire, Somerville, Massachusetts) with
default advanced parameters. For each experimental
point, the median of the normalized M values among all
technical replicates was calculated for each gene represented in the SUCAST microarray. The median values of M
in each biological replicate were mean-centered in order
to emphasize similarities in the deviations from the mean
value by subtracting the average expression level of each
gene along the time-course from the experimental measurement obtained in each experimental point. We considered an expression profile as biologically reproducible
when the correlation coefficient was ≥ 0.7 between the
mean-centered values from pair-wise biological replicate
comparisons. SAS with at least one invalid M value (saturated, low-intensity or poor quality signals) were excluded
from this analysis. The mean-centered values were averaged between the biological replicates and a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to estimate
the number of groups to be generated by the SOM algorithm [134]. The results obtained are shown in additional
file 11: Table 9, which demonstrate that the establishment
of four to six groups for these data was enough to represent the main sources of variability among the selected
patterns. The 2 × 2 and 2 × 3 geometries were tested when
generating the SOM results for each of these treatments.
We concluded that the 2 × 2 geometry in the case of MeJA
treatment and a 2 × 3 geometry in the case of ABA treatment, phosphate starvation and drought resulted in
groups with little internal variation.
Validation of microarray results by real-time PCR (RTPCR)
Two to five micrograms of total RNA (from a third biological replicate for each treatment) were treated with DNase
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions
and an aliquot of 7.5 μl of the treated RNA was reverse-

transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis
System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The 20 μl reverse transcription reactions contained the RNA template, 2 μl 10×
RT buffer, 0.5 mM each dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP, 50
ng random hexamers, 0.25 μg oligo(dT), 5 mM MgCl2, 10
mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 40 U RNase OUT and 50 U
SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase. RNA, random hexamers, dNTPs, and oligo(dT) were mixed first, incubated at
70°C for 5 min and placed on ice. The remaining components, except the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase, were
added to the reaction, the mixture was heated to 25°C for
10 min and then incubated at 42°C for 2 min. The SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase was added to each tube and
the reaction was incubated at 42°C for 1.5 h, 72°C for 10
min, and chilled on ice. An identical reaction without the
reverse transcriptase was performed as a control (no
amplification control, NAC) to confirm the absence of
genomic DNA. The cDNA product was treated with 2 U of
RNaseH (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C and for 10 min
at 72°C. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a
GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed using the Primer Express 2.0
Software (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR reactions
were performed in triplicates and contained 2 μl of a 1:10
dilution of the synthesized cDNA, primers to a final concentration of 600 nM each, 12.5 μl of the SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix and PCR-grade water to a total volume of 25
μl. In the case of reactions using primers for 25S rRNA, a
dilution of 1:1,000 of the synthesized cDNA was used.
The parameters for the PCR reaction were 50°C for 2 min,
95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for
1 min. The specificity of the amplified products was evaluated by the analysis of the dissociation curves generated.
No template controls (NTC) and no amplification controls (NAC) were run in order to confirm the absence of
genomic DNA or reagent contamination. The relative
expression ratio (experimental/control) was determined
based on the 2-ΔΔCt method [135]. To access the statistical
significance of expression ratios, we assumed a log-normal model and calculated the probability Pr(sample>reference) and Pr(sample < reference) for up- and downregulated genes, respectively. The expression profile was
considered validated when P ≥ 0.99. The primers used are
shown in additional file 10: Table 8.
Phylogenetic grouping of kinases
Sugarcane sequences containing a putative pkinase (catalytic domain of protein kinases) domain, as defined by
the Pfam algorithm [43] were selected for the phylogenetic analysis of RLKs and other protein kinases. Protein
kinase sequences from other organisms were retrieved in
their majority from the PlantsP database [122] and used
as drivers in the phylogenetic analysis. The sequences
were aligned using ClustalW [136] with default parame-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/71

ters. The pkinase alignment was manually adjusted to preserve the conserved subdomains defined by Hanks and
colleagues [118-120] for eukaryotic kinases using the SeAl Sequence Alignment Editor [137]. The alignment was
trimmed to remove gaps in most of the sequences.
Sequences spanning less than 50% of this partial alignment were discarded. The alignment was analysed with
PAUP [138] using the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm
and distance as the criterion. Bootstrap analysis was conducted with 500 replicates using NJ/UPGMA and distance
as the criterion.

Log2 ratios of microarray signals between the Cy3 and Cy5 channels. For
each clone, the median intensity value of the technical replicates was used
to calculate the ratio between the experimental samples and the reference
sample. The numbers 1 and 2 denote the different biological samples used
for each experiment. The asterisk indicates that the SAS identity was not

from saturated, low-intensity and low-quality spots. Data from clones for
which PCR reactions produced low yields or multiple bands were also
removed. The table contains 1,555 elements and not 1,545. This is due
to the fact that some SAS are represented more than once in the Table.
This occurs when the same SAS is represented in more than one position
in the 384-well plates and some of these positions did not have their identity validated by re-sequencing. In these cases, we opted to analyse these

Sugarcane genes and primers selected for real-time PCR experiments.
Primers were designed using the Primer Express 2.0 Software (Applied
Biosystems) and BLAST searches against the SUCEST database were conducted to ensure the specificity of the selected primers. The column Experimental Datapoints lists the samples analysed. Primer sequences for
endogenous references were retrieved from [27] and [38]. The P value is
the probability Pr(sample>reference) and Pr(sample < reference) for upand down-regulated genes, respectively. The expression profile was considered validated when P ≥ 0.99.

PCA analysis for defining the number of groups in SOM. The difference
between the magnitude of principal component eigenvalues for each treatment (columns) estimates how many groups are minimally necessary in
each SOM grouping analysis. When the difference is near zero, there is
no substantial information added by increasing the number of seed groups
in SOM.
