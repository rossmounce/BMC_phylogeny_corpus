Abstract
Background: Camelina sativa, an oilseed crop in the Brassicaceae family, has inspired renewed interest due to its
potential for biofuels applications. Little is understood of the nature of the C. sativa genome, however. A study was
undertaken to characterize two genes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, fatty acid desaturase (FAD) 2 and fatty
acid elongase (FAE) 1, which revealed unexpected complexity in the C. sativa genome.
Results: In C. sativa, Southern analysis indicates the presence of three copies of both FAD2 and FAE1 as well as LFY,
a known single copy gene in other species. All three copies of both CsFAD2 and CsFAE1 are expressed in
developing seeds, and sequence alignments show that previously described conserved sites are present,
suggesting that all three copies of both genes could be functional. The regions downstream of CsFAD2 and
upstream of CsFAE1 demonstrate co-linearity with the Arabidopsis genome. In addition, three expressed haplotypes
were observed for six predicted single-copy genes in 454 sequencing analysis and results from flow cytometry
indicate that the DNA content of C. sativa is approximately three-fold that of diploid Camelina relatives.
Phylogenetic analyses further support a history of duplication and indicate that C. sativa and C. microcarpa might
share a parental genome.
Conclusions: There is compelling evidence for triplication of the C. sativa genome, including a larger chromosome
number and three-fold larger measured genome size than other Camelina relatives, three isolated copies of FAD2,
FAE1, and the KCS17-FAE1 intergenic region, and three expressed haplotypes observed for six predicted single-copy
genes. Based on these results, we propose that C. sativa be considered an allohexaploid. The characterization of
fatty acid synthesis pathway genes will allow for the future manipulation of oil composition of this emerging
biofuel crop; however, targeted manipulations of oil composition and general development of C. sativa should
consider and, when possible take advantage of, the implications of polyploidy.

Background
Interest in biofuels has prompted researchers to critically evaluate alternative feedstocks for biofuel production. One important, emerging biofuel crop is Camelina
sativa L. Cranz (Brassicaceae), commonly referred to as
“false flax” or “gold-of-pleasure”. Renewed interest in
C. sativa as a biofuel feedstock is due in part to its
drought tolerance and minimal requirements for supplemental nitrogen and other agricultural inputs [1,2].
Similar to other non-traditional, renewable oilseed

feedstocks such as Jatropha curcas L. (“jatropha”),
C. sativa grows on marginal land. Unlike jatropha,
which is a tropical and subtropical shrub, C. sativa is
native to Europe and is naturalized in North America,
where it grows well in the northern United States and
southern Canada.
In addition to its drought tolerance and broad distribution, several other aspects of C. sativa biology make it
well suited for development as an oilseed crop. First,
C. sativa is a member of the family Brassicaceae, and
thus is a relative of both the genetic model organism
Arabidopsis thaliana and the oilseed crop Brassica
napus. The close relationship between C. sativa and
Arabidopsis [3,4] makes the Arabidopsis genome an
ideal reference point for the development of genetic and

genomic tools in C. sativa. Second, the oil content of C.
sativa seeds is comparable to that of B. napus, ranging
from 30 to 40% (w/w) [5], suggesting that agronomic
lessons from the cultivation of B. napus are applicable
to C. sativa cultivation. Finally, the properties of
C. sativa biodiesel are already well described [6], and
both seed oil and biodiesel from C. sativa were used as
fuel in engine trials with promising results [6,7].
Notwithstanding its potential for oil production, there
is limited molecular and genomic information on this
crop. Published studies detailing the biology of C. sativa
and its closest relatives in the genus Camelina are few.
However, several important findings can be drawn from
the literature. Taxonomic treatments describe 11 species
in the genus with a center of diversity in Eurasia [8],
although C. sativa, C. rumelica, C. microcarpa, and C.
alyssum are naturalized weeds with broad distributions.
Camelina species can be annual or biennial, with some
species requiring vernalization to induce flowering [9].
Chromosome counts range from n = 6 in C. rumelica
[10,11], or n = 7 in C. hispida [12], upwards to n = 20
in C. sativa, C. microcarpa, and C. alyssum [2,13]. Some
Camelina species are interfertile; crosses of C. sativa
with C. alyssum, and C. sativa with C. microcarpa, produce viable seed [14]. In addition to these studies, a limited amount of molecular and sequence information is
available for C. sativa [2,15-17].
Understanding the Camelina sativa genome is essential if agronomic properties are to be improved through
molecular assisted breeding, mutation breeding, and/or
genetic manipulation. For example, modification of the
oil composition for superior biodiesel is a natural goal
for this oilseed crop. C. sativa is high in polyunsaturated
fatty acids such as linoleic acid (18:2; carbons:double
bonds) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3) as well as very
long chain fatty acids (greater than 18 carbons) such as
11-eicosenoic acid (20:1) [18], while an ideal biodiesel
blend is high in oleic acid (18:1) [19]. Target genes for
modification could therefore include FATTY ACID
DESATURASE 2 (FAD2), a membrane bound delta-12desaturase which converts oleic acid to linoleic acid
[20-24], and FATTY ACID ELONGASE 1 (FAE1) which
sequentially adds 2 carbon units to 18 carbon fatty acid
CoA conjugates, resulting in very long chain fatty acids
[25-29].
Manipulation of genes affecting traits of interest
requires knowledge of their duplication status. Whole
genome duplication is particularly relevant because it is
common in plants, and because in the case of allopolyploidy it results in two or three independent copies of
each gene. Allopolyploidy, such as found in wheat, cotton and peanut, is defined by the concurrent presence
and maintenance in the same nucleus of two or more
diploid genomes. In an allopolyploid, each chromosome

Page 2 of 15

pairs specifically to its own homolog, and not to any
homoeolog, resulting in diploid inheritance [30,31].
Allopolyploids are usually formed by interspecific hybridization concurrent to genome duplication, but could
also result from diploidization and divergence of genomic sets in an autopolyploid [30]. Once formed, allopolyploids are relatively stable. Gene duplicates slowly
decay over millions of years back to diploidy. For example, a distinct but partial duplication pattern still detectable in the Arabidopsis genome is thought to result
from an approximately 25 million year old polyploidization event [32]. The genomes of maize and soybean display widespread, but not universal duplication and are
estimated to be 10 million year old polyploids [33,34].
Polyploids in which gene loss has advanced so far that
duplication is no longer universal have been defined
“paleopolyploids” although this term carries no precise
temporal definition and could be extended to all known
sequenced diploid angiosperms. Gene duplication is
thus universal in a recent polypoid and becomes less
and less pervasive in older polyploids as duplicates
decay back to singletons. For a set of nearly 1000 genes
the singleton pattern can be confirmed in all major
sequenced diploid species [35].
We report the sequences of three copies of both FAE1
and FAD2 recovered from C. sativa. We used Southern
blots to determine whether the recovered copies are
allelic or if they represent multiple loci. Moreover, we
performed phylogenetic analyses to infer the evolutionary history of the copies, and quantitative PCR (qPCR)
to explore whether there is evidence of functional divergence among them. To better understand the C. sativa
genome and to determine whether the multiple copies
recovered are the result of polyploidization, we analyzed
the genome sizes of C. sativa and its closest relatives in
the genus Camelina by flow cytometry. Finally, we used
next generation RNA sequencing data to demonstrate
that well-characterized single-copy genes are present in
triplicates. Collectively our results indicate that C. sativa
is a hexaploid whose oil composition is likely influenced
by more than one functional copy of FAE1 and FAD2.
Thus in C. sativa, oil composition as well as other traits
are likely to be determined by multiple copies of causative genes.

Results
Southern blot hybridizations show multiple copies of
genes in Camelina sativa

As a first step to characterize genes involved in fatty
acid biosynthesis, we determined the copy number of
FAD2 and FAE1 by Southern blot analysis. Since
C. sativa is closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana [3,4],
we designed primers based on Arabidopsis genomic
sequence that amplified conserved regions of FAD2 and

Figure 1 Southern blot analysis of Camelina sativa and Arabidopsis. A blot containing genomic DNA from C. sativa and Arabidopsis
digested with EcoRI or a combination of EcoRI and BamHI was hybridized with an a-32P dCTP - labeled (A) FAD2 probe, (B) FAE1 probe or (C)
LFY probe obtained from PCR amplification of C. sativa DNA. The same blot was used for all three probes. The expected sizes of the Arabidopsis
fragments are indicated beside the bands and are consistent with complete digestion of the DNA.

FAE1 (Additional File 1). Using these primers, we PCR
amplified products of 225 base pairs (bp) (FAD2) and
403 bp (FAE1) from Arabidopsis and from C. sativa.
The C. sativa products were cloned, sequenced, and
compared with Arabidopsis FAD2 and FAE1 sequences
[36] to confirm their identities. We used the C. sativa
fragments as probes in Southern blot experiments (Figure 1). Results of the Southern blots revealed three
bands in C. sativa for both FAD2 (Figure 1A) and FAE1
(Figure 1B), whereas hybridization revealed only a single
band in Arabidopsis for both genes (Figure 1A &1B).
These results suggest that FAD2 and FAE1 occur in at
least three copies in C. sativa, while they are single copy
in Arabidopsis [36]. Fatty acid genes can be multi-copy
in many species, including soybean [37], Brassica napus
[38], olive (Olea europaea) [39], maize [40], and sunflower [41]. Therefore, we designed a probe for Southern blot hybridization of the gene LEAFY (LFY), which
is known to be single copy in a wide variety of species
from several plant families [42]. Three bands were
observed following hybridization with the LFY probe of
the same blot as was used for FAD2 and FAE1, suggesting LFY also exists as three copies in C. sativa (Figure
1C).
Copies of C. sativa FAD2 and FAE1 are highly similar to
each other and to their putative orthologs from
Arabidopsis

We cloned and sequenced the full length genomic and
cDNA sequences of C. sativa FAD2 and FAE1. Using
primers designed from Arabidopsis FAD2 and Crambe
abyssinica FAE1 (Additional File 1), we PCR amplified a
band of approximately 1.2 kb for FAD2 and 1.5 kb for
FAE1 from C. sativa. For each gene, we sequenced

more than 60 clones. Three different versions of both
CsFAD2 and CsFAE1 were recovered and designated A,
B, and C. It should be noted that the A, B, and C copies
were named independently for CsFAD2 and CsFAE1,
and thus are not associated with a particular genome.
The three copies of C. sativa FAD2 are 1155 bp long,
lack introns in the coding regions, are 97% identical at
the nucleotide level, and encode proteins that are 99%
identical in sequence (Table 1). One of the CsFAD2
copies, CsFAD2 A, contains a BamHI site (see Additional File 2), and thus this copy likely produced the
smallest fragment in the Southern blot hybridization of
FAD2 (Figure 1A; BamHI + EcoRI digest). The C. sativa
nucleotide sequences of FAD2 are greater than 93%
identical to Arabidopsis FAD2, and the putative encoded
proteins from the two species share greater than 96%
identity (Table 1).
The 5’ untranslated region (utr) was recovered for all
three copies of CsFAD2 by rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) PCR. We then used primers designed
from the 5’ utr sequence (Additional File 1) to amplify
an approximately 1.4 kb intron found within the 5’ utr
from all three copies of C. sativa FAD2. A similarly
sized intron is present in Arabidopsis [36] and in Sesamum indicum (sesame) where it has been shown to be
involved in regulating FAD2 expression [43].
All three copies of FAE1 in C. sativa are 1518 bp long
and lack introns. When the nucleotide sequences and
the putative encoded proteins of the three copies are
compared they are more than 96% identical (Table 1).
In comparison to Arabidopsis, the nucleotide sequences
are more than 90% identical, while the encoded proteins
are more than 91% identical (Table 1). Thus, the three
copies of C. sativa FAD2 and the three copies of FAE1

orthologs from Arabidopsis.
Alignments of FAD2 and FAE1 protein sequences from
several species reveal conserved and non-conserved
domains

We aligned translated amino acid sequences from the
three copies of C. sativa FAD2 with the FAD2 protein
sequences from Arabidopsis; Brassica rapa, an agronomically important member of the Brassicaceae family;
Glycine max, an agronomically important dicot; and Zea
mays, an agronomically important monocot (Figure 2A).
All three copies of C. sativa FAD2 have the three conserved HIS boxes found in all membrane-bound desaturases [44] as well as the ER localization signal
described by McCartney et al [45]. Furthermore, the
conserved amino acids identified in an alignment of the
FAD2 sequences from 34 different species [46] are also
present in C. sativa with the exception of a positivelycharged histidine at position number 44, which is substituted by a polar, uncharged glutamine in C. sativa.
When we amplified the FAD2 gene from several Camelina and outgroup species and aligned the translated
amino acid sequences, we found that the FAD2 proteins
from Capsella rubella, Camelina microcarpa, Camelina
laxa, and one copy from Camelina rumelica contain a
glutamine at amino acid position 44, while the FAD2
proteins from Arabidopsis lyrata, Camelina hispida, and
a second copy from Camelina rumelica contained a histidine (Additional File 3).
We aligned the translated amino acid sequences from
the three copies of C. sativa FAE1 with the seed-specific
FAE1 proteins from Arabidopsis, Crambe abyssinica, a
high and low erucic acid Brassica rapa, Limnanthes
alba, and Tropaeolum majus (Figure 2B). L. alba and T.
majus are both in the order Brassicales and their seeds
accumulate high levels of very long chain fatty acids
[47,48]. Four conserved histidine residues and six

conserved cysteine residues, including the active site at
cysteine 223, as well as an asparagine residue at 424
required for FAE1 acitivity were previously identified by
Ghanevati and Jaworski [49,50]. All conserved residues
were found to be present in all three copies of C. sativa
FAE1. More differences were apparent between the
three C. sativa FAE1 sequences and the other FAE1
sequences than observed in the FAD2 comparison
(Figure 2A and 2B), an observation consistent with the
level of amino acid identity seen between Arabidopsis
and C. sativa FAD2 versus FAE1 (Table 1).
All three copies of FAD2 and FAE1 are expressed in
developing seeds of C. sativa

The conservation of amino acids as well as the presence
of the 5’ regulatory intron in CsFAD2 suggests that all
three copies of CsFAD2 and CsFAE1 could be functional. To determine whether these genes are also
expressed, we first evaluated total CsFAD2 and CsFAE1
gene expression in developing seeds and in seedling tissue using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) with primer/probe combinations designed to detect all three
copies of each gene (Additional File 4). CsFAD2 expression in seedling tissue is present but minimal (0.4% of
that seen in seeds at 20 days post-anthesis (DPA)), while
CsFAE1 expression could not be detected in seedlings
(Figure 3A and 3B). In developing seeds, both CsFAD2
and CsFAE1 expression peaks at 20 DPA and is reduced
by 30 DPA (Figure 3A and 3B). In Arabidopsis, FAD2
peaks earlier and decreases sooner than FAE1 [51].
We wondered whether the expression of each of the
FAD2 and FAE1 copies present in C. sativa are equally
or differentially expressed in the seed. Duplicated genes
are frequently silenced either throughout the plant or in
a tissue-specific manner [52-55]; hence we hypothesized
that one or more of the copies of each gene could be
significantly down-regulated. We used the Sequenom
MassARRAY™ method for determining allele-specific

expression of a gene [56] to evaluate the relative expression of each of the copies of CsFAD2 and CsFAE1. We
identified at least three single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) specific to each of the CsFAD2 A, B, and C and
the CsFAE1 A, B, and C copies (Additional File 5) and
then calculated the frequency of each SNP in seed
cDNA. Controls consisting of the cloned CsFAE1 A, B,
and C copies combined to known frequencies showed
that the method is greater than 80% accurate (data not
shown). No evidence of silencing of any particular copy
of either CsFAE1 or CsFAD2 was discovered. We did
observe differential expression, especially of CsFAE1 A,
which accounts for approximately 40-50% of CsFAE1
expression in seeds at 20-30 DPA (Figure 3C and 3D).
Characterization of sequences upstream of C. sativa FAE1
and downstream of C. sativa FAD2 suggests colinearity
with Arabidopsis

To investigate whether the different copies of C. sativa
FAD2 and FAE1 are the result of allelic variation or are

in fact independent loci, we obtained sequence from the
region upstream of CsFAE1 and downstream of
CsFAD2. Assuming colinearity between C. sativa and
Arabidopsis for the region around FAE1, we PCR amplified the region 5’ to CsFAE1 using a forward primer for
the upstream gene KCS17 with reverse primers for C.
sativa FAE1 (Additional File 1). The resulting sequences
we obtained for the putative C. sativa KCS17 were
highly similar to the last 189 bp of Arabidopsis KCS17,
suggesting that we had in fact amplified the orthologous
C. sativa region upstream of FAE1, confirming colinearity between the two species. We then used a dot plot
[57] to compare the three C. sativa upstream sequences
to each other and to Arabidopsis with parameters set
for perfect match on a sliding window of 9 bases (Additional File 6). The coordinates from the dot plot were
used to define blocks of homology between Arabidopsis
and the three C. sativa copies (Figure 4). The results
show a variable intergenic region containing potentially
related blocks common to two or more genomes.

Figure 4 Structure and conservation of the KCS17-FAE1 intergenic region in Camelina sativa. The three putative homoeologous regions in
C. sativa are aligned to the orthologous region of Arabidopsis to display blocks of homology identified on a dot matrix by perfect conservation
of a sliding window of 9 bases. The KCS17 and FAE1 gene, respectively blue and red, flank a variable region in which potentially related
sequences are marked by different shades of brown, corresponding to varying levels of similarity, which were estimated visually from dot matrix
plots since proper alignment was not possible. Lined regions display reduced or no conservation. The large variation in the intergenic region of
the triplicated KCS17-FAE1 DNA of C. sativa is consistent with independent evolution before reunion of diverged genomes by polyploidization.

Colinearity with Arabidopsis was also found for a region
downstream of FAD2 containing the ACTIN11 (ACT11)
gene for two out of the three C. sativa copies (data not
shown). For the third copy, the region downstream of
CsFAD2 A could have been missed if the length of the
amplified product was too large. Alternatively, the
region downstream of CsFAD2 A might not exhibit colinearity with Arabidopsis and the possibility remains that
two of the copies of CsFAD2 result from a tandem gene
duplication.
Deep sequencing of Camelina sativa developing seed
transcriptome reveals three expressed haplotypes for
predicted single-copy genes

To further explore the C. sativa genome, we determined
the haplotype number of predicted single-copy genes in
a 454 sequencing data set of cDNA expressed in 15
DPA C. sativa seeds. The reads were aligned to 956
genes identified by Duarte et al. [35] as single-copy
genes shared in flowering plants. The six genes with the
highest coverage (> 60 reads per gene) were selected for
further evaluation. Remarkably, all 6 genes examined
showed expression of three clear haplotypes (Additional
File 7) as exemplified by the agmatine deiminase gene
(Figure 5), indicating that the triplication of the genes in
the C. sativa genome is common and not limited to
FAD2, FAE1, and LFY. When the genomic status of the
same 6 genes was examined in the genomes of paleopolyploids such as maize and soybean, whose genome
duplication is about 10 million years old [33,34], only a
subset of these genes was retained as duplicates (Table
2). This lack of duplication in maize and soybean

contrasted with the consistent pattern of triplication in
C. sativa.
The genomes of C. sativa, C. alyssum, and C. microcarpa
are larger than the genomes of other Camelina species

We calculated DNA content in several accessions of C.
sativa and related species from flow cytometry analyses
using propidium iodide-stained nuclei. We used Arabidopsis accession Col-0 (2X) and its tetraploid (4X) derivative as genome size standards. C. sativa, C. alyssum,
and C. microcarpa diploid (2C) genomes had a haploid
content between 650 and 800 Mb (Figure 6). C. sativa
accessions uniformly displayed a genome size close to
750 Mb. North American isolates of C. sativa, C. alyssum, and C. microcarpa have reported chromosome
counts of n = 20 [13]. The genomes of C. rumelica (600
Mb), C. hispida (300 Mb) and C. laxa (210 Mb) are
smaller than those of C. sativa, C. alyssum, and C.
microcarpa. Chromosome counts of both n = 6 [10,11]
and n = 12 [12] have been recorded for C. rumelica,
while only a single count of n = 7 exists for C. hispida
[12]. To our knowledge, no published counts exist for
C. laxa.
Phylogenetic analysis of FAD2 and FAE1 indicate that C.
sativa and C. microcarpa are closely related

To understand the duplication history of the multiple
FAD2 and FAE1 copies recovered from C. sativa, we
amplified the FAD2 and FAE1 genes from several Camelina species and outgroup species, and inferred phylogeny for each gene. The sampling of taxa chosen
allowed us to test whether FAD2 and FAE1 duplication

sativa seeds, aligned with the Arabidopsis agmatine deiminase cDNA (At5G08170). The three haplotypes are evident and indicate that three
different copies of this “single-copy gene” are present and expressed in the C. sativa genome, presumably representing three homoeologs.
Similar results were obtained with the other 5 single-copy genes sampled (Additional File 7). The degree of nucleotide similarity estimated in
these aligned regions (3-6%) is consistent with the diversity observed in FAD2 and FAE1 loci.

data are best described by the TVM+I+Γ model, while
the FAE1 data are best described by the HKY+I+Γ
model. Likelihood phylogenetic analyses in PAUP* 4.b
[59] produced a single FAD2 tree (-LnL 3665.277; Figure
7A), and a single FAE1 tree (-LnL 5051.552; Figure 7B).
Phylogenies inferred from FAD2 and FAE1 data indicate a history of duplication for both markers. Both
C. microcarpa and C. sativa have three distinct copies
of FAD2 and FAE1. Moreover, for FAD2, the A and C
copies from these two species are monophyletic with
strong (100%) bootstrap support (bs); for FAE1 the A
and B copies from these species are strongly monophyletic (100% bs). In contrast, neither the FAD2 B copies
of C. sativa and C. microcarpa, nor the FAE1 C copies
of these species form a monophyletic group with each
other. Instead, our results indicate that C. rumelica has
two distinct copies of FAD2 and that one of these copies
(FAD2-2) is strongly monophyletic with C. microcarpa
FAD2 B. We recovered only a single FAD2 copy for
C. laxa and C. hispida. In contrast, we recovered at
least two distinct copies of FAE1 from all sampled
Camelina species. The FAE1-1 copy of C. laxa,

C. sativa FAE1 C is very weakly supported as sister to
C. hispida FAE1-2 (53%). Finally, all recovered FAD2
and FAE1 copies from species of the genus Camelina
are monophyletic and sister to other sampled members
of the tribe Camelineae, consistent with phylogenies
based on other markers [3,4].

C. hispida, and C. rumelica form a monophyletic group
(91% bs), with the former two species sister to one
another with strong support (100% bs). Similar to the
results from FAD2, C. rumelica FAE1-2 is sister to one
of the C. microcarpa copies (FAE1 C; 99% bs). Neither
the C. sativa FAD2 B copy, nor the C. sativa FAE1 C
copy, shows a well supported sister relationship to other
FAD2 or FAE1 sequences. However, in the FAE1 tree,

Discussion
Camelina sativa is a re-emerging oilseed with tremendous potential as an alternative biofuel crop and for
which genomic information is becoming increasingly
available. We have obtained molecular data for nine
genes, characterized in detail two genes encoding fatty
acid biosynthesis enzymes and, in the process, have discovered unexpected complexity in the C. sativa genome.
The close relationship between C. sativa and the
model plant Arabidopsis thaliana [3,4] facilitates the
manipulation of known pathways, such as the one regulating fatty acid biosynthesis. C. sativa seed oil is high in
both polyunsaturated and long chain fatty acids
[5,60,61], suggesting that both CsFAD2 and CsFAE1 are
present and active. Three copies each of the FAD2 and
FAE1 genes were isolated from an agronomic accession
of C. sativa using primers designed from A. thaliana or
Crambe abyssinica sequence. Previously identified conserved sites in CsFAD2 [44-46] and CsFAE1 [49,50,62]

are present in all three copies of each gene and a 5’
intron shown to be important in regulating FAD2
expression in sesame [43] was identified in all three
CsFAD2 copies. Real time qPCR data and Sequenom
MassARRAY SNP analysis of the CsFAD2 and CsFAE1
cDNA showed that all three copies of each gene are
expressed in developing seeds. Thus, it seems likely that
all three copies of FAD2 and FAE1 in C. sativa are
functional.
The cloning of three copies of FAD2 and FAE1 from
the C. sativa genome, as well as the observation of three
LFY hybridization signals by Southern analysis and three
expressed haplotypes for 6 more predicted single-copy
genes in developing seeds, could be explained by at least
two possible scenarios: segmental duplications of
selected regions within a diploid genome either through
tandem duplications or through transpositions, or whole
genome duplications resulting from polyploidization.
Segmental duplications or transpositions affecting all
nine examined loci are improbable compared with the
explanation of polyploidy. Furthermore, no evidence of
recent segmental duplication involving multiple genes
has been observed in sequenced plant genomes
[36,63-65].
Triplication of the C. sativa genome therefore likely
occurred through whole genome duplication, either
through autopolyploidization or through allopolyploidization. An autopolyploidy event might have triplicated a
single diploid genome resulting in an autohexaploid
with a haploid genome of 18, 21, or 24 chromosomes.
Given that C. sativa has a chromosome count of n = 20,
chromosome splitting or fusion could then have
increased the chromosomes from 18 to 20, or decreased
the chromosomes from 21 or 24 to 20.
Alternatively, triplication of the C. sativa genome
might have resulted from two allopolyploidy events,
resulting in first a tetraploid then a hexaploid, similar to
the origin of cultivated wheat. According to this hypothesis, the three copies of each gene diverged in different
diploid genomes before converging through polyploidy
events. Taking into consideration the reported chromosome counts of various Camelina species, the basal
chromosome number of the diploid parental species
contributing to the C. sativa haploid genome of 20
chromosomes could be 7+7+6 or 8+6+6. The allopolyploid hypothesis is supported by the observation that C.
sativa demonstrates diploid inheritance [2,66], as would
be expected for an allopolyploid [31]. A hexaploid C.
sativa could also be derived from the combination of an
autotetraploid and a diploid species if, in an autopolyploidized genome, homologous chromosomes differentiated so that the subsequent chromosome-specific
pairing mimicked an allopolyploid genome in its diploid
inheritance patterns. Regardless of its evolutionary path,

Page 10 of 15

the C. sativa genome appears organized in three redundant and differentiated copies and can be formally considered to be an allohexaploid.
Results from our phylogenetic analyses support a
history of duplication for both FAD2 and FAE1 in
Camelina. For FAD2, duplications were only recovered
for C. sativa, C. microcarpa, and C. rumelica. These
data are consistent with genome size data, which indicate that all three genomes are larger than C. laxa and
C. hispida, from which only a single FAD2 copy was
recovered. Taken together, the results suggest that
C. sativa, C. microcarpa, and C. rumelica are likely polyploids. Given the slightly smaller genome size of
C. rumelica, and the fact that we recovered only two
FAD2 copies from it, the C. rumelica sampled may be
tetraploid while C. sativa and C. microcarpa are hexaploid. Interestingly, in both the FAD2 and FAE1 trees,
one copy each of C. rumelica and C. microcarpa are
strongly supported as sister. Thus, trees from these
genes indicate that C. rumelica and C. microcarpa are
closely related. The various placement of C. microcarpa
FAD2 and FAE1 copies can be explained if C. microcarpa is the result of a hybridization event between
C. rumelica and a currently unsampled, and thus unidentified species of Camelina. Two of the three copies
of both FAD2 and FAE1 are identical, or nearly identical, in C. sativa and C. microcarpa, suggesting that
C. sativa and C. microcarpa share a parental genome.
Thus, we suggest that a Camelina species we did not
sample contributed its genome to the hybrid formation
of both C. sativa and C. microcarpa. In the case of
C. microcarpa, the hybridization event likely involved
C. rumelica. Given the chromosome count of n = 6 for
C. rumelica, we expect the other putative parent to have
an x = 7 genome, and furthermore to be tetraploid at
n = 14. Such a cross would result in the observed
C. microcarpa genome, with chromosome count n = 20.
Interestingly, C. hispida is the only species we sampled
with a chromosome count of n = 7, however no strong
relationship between C. hispida and C. microcarpa is
inferred in either gene tree. However, we do infer a
weak relationship between C. sativa and C. hispida in
the FAE1 tree, and thus the possibility that C. hispida is
involved in the polyploid formation of C. sativa should
be explored further.
What is the age of the polyploidization events likely to
have formed the C. sativa genome? A complete answer
will require a better understanding of its genome, but
two findings suggest a recent origin. First, the chromosome number of C. sativa is inconsistent with extensive
karyotype evolution and likely represents the sum of the
ancestral contributions. Second, paleopolyploids such as
soybean and maize display duplication of many, but not
all genes as a sizeable number have decayed to singleton

Hutcheon et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:233
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/233

state. In contrast, the presence of triplicates for nine test
genes of C. sativa is consistent with high retention of
duplicates, as expected in recent polyploids.
The likely allohexaploid nature of the Camelina sativa
genome has multiple implications. Its vigor and adaptability to marginal growth conditions may result at least
in part from polyploidy. Polyploids are thought to be
more adaptable to new or harsh environments, with the
ability to expand into broader niches than either progenitor [67,68]. Indeed, C. hispida and C. laxa, both of
which are likely diploids, are found only in Turkey, Iran,
Armenia, and Azerbaijan, while C. microcarpa and C.
sativa are distributed throughout Asia, Europe, and
North Africa and are naturalized in North America
[8,69]. The mechanisms behind this increased adaptability are not completely understood, but have been attributed to heterosis, genetic and regulatory network
redundancies, and epigenetic factors [30,70].
Allohexaploidy might also affect any potential manipulations of the C. sativa genome, such as introgression of
germplasm or induced mutations. Introgression of an exotic germplasm could be facilitated by the type of polyploidy-dependent manipulations that are possible in
wheat, a potentially comparable allohexaploid [71,72]. In
addition, polyploids have displayed excellent response to
reverse genomics approaches such as Targeting Induced
Local Lesions inGenomes (TILLING) [73,74]. As in wheat,
any recessive induced mutations could be masked by
redundant homoeologous loci that have maintained function [75,76]. This mutation masking implies that multiple
knockout alleles at different homoeologous sites can be
combined to achieve partial or complete suppression of a
targeted function [77,78]. We also expect that single locus
traits, whether transgenic or not, will display diploid
inheritance due to preferential intragenomic pairing.
In a hexaploid oilseed crop such as C. sativa, manipulations of oil composition and/or yield should therefore
be possible through transgenic or reverse genetic
approaches, or through other genome manipulations
similar to those performed in wheat. For example, the
characterization of FAD2 and FAE1 in C. sativa could
enable the use of TILLING techniques to isolate C.
sativa plants with mutations in each of the three identified copies of both genes. We expect these mutations to
result in plants with reduced levels of polyunsaturated
fatty acids or long chain fatty acids, possibly in a dosage
dependent manner. This will allow us to manipulate the
seed oil composition of C. sativa, potentially creating a
broad spectrum of C. sativa varieties possessing useful
biodiesel properties, thereby further increasing the utility
of this emerging biofuel crop.

Conclusions
The discovery of triplication and divergence of genes
that in known diploids are present in single copy, the
cytometrically determined genome size of Camelina species, the pattern of relationship and inferred duplication
history in the gene trees, together with the previously
known chromosome counts for this taxon, indicate a
likely allohexaploid genomic constitution. The characterization of genes encoding key functions of fatty acid
biosynthesis lays the foundation for future manipulations of this pathway in Camelina sativa. Targeted
manipulations of oil composition and general development of this crop, however, need to consider the implications of polyploidy and when possible take advantage
of this common condition in crop plants.
Methods
Southern blot

Camelina sativa Cs11 and Cs32, and Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 (Additional File 8) seeds were germinated on Arabidopsis Growth Media (1× Murashige and
Skoog (MS) mineral salts, 0.5 g/L MES, 0.8% PhytaBlend™ all from Caisson Labs, North Logan, UT; pH5.7)
and allowed to grow for ~2 weeks under 16/8 hours
day/night, 22/18°C and ~130 μE m-2 s-1 light intensity.
A third Camelina sativa sample consisted of Cs32 leaf
tissue from a fully grown plant (~1 month old) that
allowed us to obtain a larger amount of DNA from a
single plant. Genomic DNA was isolated according to
the CTAB method [79] and 10 μg was digested overnight (~16 h) with EcoRI or a combination of EcoRI
plus BamHI. DNA electrophoresis and blotting were
carried out using standard molecular biology techniques
[80]. The probe was labelled with a-32P dCTP according to instructions of the DECAprime II kit (Ambion,
Austin, TX). Hybridization was carried out overnight at
42°C. The blot was washed (30 minutes each) at 42°C in
2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, followed by 55°C in 2 × SSC, 0.1%
SDS, and then 55°C in 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS, and exposed
to a phosphorimager screen. The same blot was hybridized with different probes after stripping the membrane
in boiling 0.1% SDS for 20 minutes each time.
Cloning of C. sativa FAD2 and FAE1 genes and upstream
regions

FAD2 and FAE1 genes were amplified from C. sativa
Cs32 DNA isolated as described above, using Pfu DNA
polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the primers
listed in Additional File 1 with a PCR machine set for
30 cycles at 58°C annealing temperature and extension
time of 3 minutes. For FAD2, buffer A from the

Hutcheon et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:233
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/233

SureBand PCR optimization kit (Bioline, Tauton, MA)
was used. All intergenic regions were isolated using
Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA). For the initial clones of the CsKCS17-CsFAE1
intergenic region, as well as the CsFAD2-CsACT11
intergenic region, the Phusion polymerase 3-step PCR
protocol with an annealing temperature of 60°C, an
extension time of 3 minutes, and 40 cycles was used. A
Phusion polymerase 3-step PCR with annealing temperature of 60°C, extension time of 1 minute, and 30
cycles was used to obtain more clones for CsKCS17CsFAE1 intergenic regions “B” and “C”, while an annealing temperature of 55°C, extension time of 2 minutes
and 30 cycles was used to obtain CsKCS17-CsFAE1
intergenic region “A”. RACE PCR was performed using
the SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification kit and
Advantage 2 Polymerase (Clontech, Mountain View,
CA) according to the accompanying directions. All the
amplified fragments were cloned using the Zero Blunt
PCR Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA.)

Relative expression analysis

Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each
of CsFAD2 A, B, and C and CsFAE1 A, B, and C were
identified. Each identified SNP distinguishes one copy
from the other two. An additional SNP, which distinguishes FAE1 A, B, and C copies from each other, was
also identified (Additional File 5). SNP frequencies were
determined in cDNA isolated as described above by the
Sequenom MassARRAY™ allele-specific expression analysis method with no competitor, as described in Park et
al [56].
454 pyrosequencing

Approximately 150 μg of total RNA from 15 DPA
Camelina sativa CS32 seed was isolated as described
above and sent to Agencourt Bioscience (now known as
Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) for isolation
of mRNA, library construction and 454 sequencing,
according to their established protocols.
Analysis of “single-copy” genes

FAD2 and FAE1 sequence alignments

Translated amino acid FAD2 and FAE1 sequences were
aligned with AlignX (Invitrogen), with a gap opening
penalty of 15, a gap extension penalty of 6.66, and a gap
separation penalty range of 8. Alignments were
imported into Boxshade [81] to highlight the conserved
residues.
RNA isolation and cDNA preparation

C. sativa Cs32 plants were grown under 24/18°C day/
night conditions with a 16/8 hour photoperiod. Flowers were tagged and embryos harvested at the time
points indicated. RNA was then isolated using the urea
LiCl method described by Tai et al [82]. cDNA were
prepared from 0.5 μg of DNAsed RNA that was
reverse transcribed with the High Capacity cDNA RT
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using random primers according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR)

Relative expression of CsFAD2 and CsFAE1 cDNA was
measured by real time qPCR and calculated according
to the comparative CT method (2-ΔΔCT). In brief, separate reactions were prepared in duplicate or triplicate
for each of the genes to be measured. Each reaction
contained 8 μl of the appropriate primers (200 nM
each) and probe (900 nM) listed in Additional File 4 for
CsACTIN (reference gene) or CsFAD2 or CsFAE1 (target
genes); 10 μl of Applied Biosystems 2× fast Taqman
PCR mix; 2 μl of cDNA. The reactions were run on an
Applied Biosystems 7900HT according to the manufacturer’s fast PCR method.

The cDNA sequences of the 956 single copy genes were
obtained from the TAIR8 cDNA set using in each case
the first cDNA model (ATNG00000.1). To compare this
set of single copy genes to the 454 transcriptome data,
an analysis was carried out by running the BLASTALL
program version 2.2.16 [83] in the UNIX environment
of an Apple Powerbook Pro. The 956 sequences were
BLASTed against a database made of all the 454
sequence reads. Alignment results with an E value > 1011
were saved and parsed to eliminate reads that had
single instances of SNP or indels and to rank the genes
according to the number of read hits. The six genes that
aligned to more than sixty reads were examined to identify “haplotypes” indicative of two or more copies.
Genome size estimation

Camelina lines (Additional File 8) were grown in the
greenhouse at temperatures fluctuating between 16°C
and 26°C with 16 hour day length supplemented by
halogen lights. The nuclei were extracted from leaves
according to Henry et al [74]. Nuclei were also
extracted from approximately 50 seeds of all species,
except C. laxa and C. hispida, which are late flowering.
The seeds were crushed with a pestle in 1.4 mL of the
same extraction buffer used for the leaves. The fluid was
then drawn through four layers of cheesecloth and
strained and processed as for the leaf nuclei. Nuclei of
diploid and tetraploids of Arabidopsis thaliana accession
Col-0 (1 C genome size 157 Mb and 314 Mb, respectively [75]), and tetraploid Arabidopsis arenosa accession
Care-1 (1C genome size 480 Mb [Dilkes, unpublished
results]) were used as standards for DNA content. Data
was collected on two different days and normalized

Hutcheon et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:233
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/233

separately to account for daily fluctuations in flow cytometer performance. The 2C, 4C, and 8C nuclear peaks
were used in a regression analysis of measured fluorescence intensity versus nuclear DNA content, producing
equations of genome size versus fluorescence that were
used to estimate the 2C content of Camelina nuclei.
Phylogenetic inference

FAD2 and FAE1 were PCR amplified from several
Camelina species and outgroups (Additional File 8)
using primers designed from C. sativa FAD2 and FAE1
sequences (Additional File 1). Amplified fragments for
FAD2 and FAE1 were cloned as described for C. sativa
above, then aligned by translated amino acid sequences
using MacClade 4.05 [84]. ModelTest 3.7 [58] in PAUP*
4.0 b [59] was used to determine the model of sequence
evolution favored by the data for each gene. Subsequent
maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed in
PAUP* 4.0 b using a heuristic search with tree bisection
reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. ML clade support
using 100 bootstrap data sets were assessed and this
support is presented on the most likely tree recovered
from the ML heuristic search.
Accession numbers

FAD2 and FAE1 sequences from Camelina species and
outgroups have been deposited in Genbank at the NCBI
[Genbank: GU929417 - GU929441].
