Abstract
Background: Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a fatal infection, but no clinical case
due to AP92 strain was reported. We described the first clinical case due to AP92 like CCHFV.
Methods: A case infected by a AP92 like CCHFV was detected in Balkanian part of Turkey.
Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. A human serologic and tick survey studies
were performed in the region, where the case detected.
Results: Thirty eight individuals out of 741 were found to be anti CCHFV IgM positive. The attack
rate for overall CCHFV was calculated as 5.2%. In univariate analyses, CCHFV IgM positivity was
found to be associated with the age (p < 0.001), male gender (p = 0.001), agricultural activity (p =
0.036), and history of tick bite (p = 0.014). In multivariate analysis, older age (OR: 1.03, CI:1.01–
1.05, p < 0.001), male gender were found to be the risk factors (OR: 2.5, CI:1.15–5.63, p = 0.020)
for CCHFV infection.
Conclusion: This is the first human case with AP92 like CCHFV infection. Furthermore, this is the
first report of AP92 like strain in Turkey. In the region, elderly males carry the highest risk for
CCHFV infection.

Background
The first Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) case
in Turkey was reported five years ago [1]. The virus
belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family
and causes severe diseases in humans, with a reported case

fatality rate (CFR) of 3–30% [1]. By the year 2008, nearly
3000 CCHF confirmed patients with CFR of 5% were
recorded at the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Turkey [2].
All of the confirmed cases, except one were detected in
Anatolian region of Turkey.

The occurrence of CCHF closely approximates the known
distribution of Hyalomma spp. ticks. Humans become
infected through the bites of ticks, by contact with a
patient with CCHF during the acute phase of infection, or
by contact with blood or tissues from viremic livestock
[3]. In a previous study, [4], all of the CCHF cases detected
in Istanbul were imported cases, who had been infected
out of Istanbul. Herein, we report a mild CCHF case from
rural Balkanian part of Istanbul. Based upon this index
case, we performed a serosurvey and field tick survey in
the region, where the index case acquired the infection,
and described the risk factors. In previous studies reported
from Turkey, the CCHFV were belonged to the EuropeTurkey clade [4-6]. By this new report, we describe a newly
emerged CCHFV strain in Turkey. Furthermore, this newly
emerged strain that led to a mild case was not described as
a human pathogen in the literature, previously [3].

Methods
Index case and the material
A mild CCHF case was diagnosed in a community hospital in Istanbul in June 2007. His disease started 3 days
after the tick bite, and he was hospitalized 4 days after the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/90

tick bite. Serum sample was obtained 5 days after the tick
bite was studied by RT-PCR for CCHFV RNA and by ELISA
for IgG and IgM antibodies against CCHFV. After this case,
a serosurvey and tick survey studies were performed in the
region at the end of June 2007. The serosurveillance studies were performed in four major districts, which were
depicted in figure 1. Seven hundred forty one subjects,
who live in the region were surveyed. In total 56 ticks were
collected from cattle from the same residential areas, and
were screened for CCHFV RNA.
Serologic studies
All the subjects were tested for IgM and IgG. A commercial
variant of capture ELISA kit (vectorbest®, Russia) was used
for detection of IgM antibodies against CCHFV. Immunoglobulin G antibodies were tested by ELISA kit of the
same company (vectorbest®, Russia). The individuals,
who were positive for IgM and/or IgG were prospectively
surveyed, and four months later the second sera from
these individuals were collected, and were studied for IgM
and IgG. The initial sera were re-tested simultaneously
with the second samples of sera. The informed consents
from each individual were obtained.

RNA extractions, PCR, and phylogenetic analysis
RNA was extracted from 200 μl whole blood using a commercial RNA extraction kit (High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid
Kit, Roche Diagnostics®, Germany) and cDNA synthesized
with Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen®, Germany) in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.

and the purified products were subjected to the cyclesequencing using big-dye terminator kit (ABI® 310, Foster
City, Calif., USA). The excess primers and nucleotides
were removed from cycle-sequencing products using
sephadex-G50 fine columns, and the products were
sequenced using ABI®310 (Foster City, Calif.) USA
sequencer.

For designing of primers used during the diagnostic
screening for CCHFV RNA, all S segment sequences from
Turkey and some selected from eastern european countries were downloaded from the GeneBank and aligned
using Clustal Wallis [7] software program. The sites of the
possible primers were selected visually and evaluated
using Primer test option of Primer Express software
(Applied Biosystems®, USA). After initial diagnostic PCR,
the amplicon was sequenced and the obtained sequence
closely matched with the sequence of AP92 strain. For
amplification of exclusively AP92 strain RNA we designed
primers from S segment of this strain (Table 1).

The obtained sequence was edited and aligned using
Lasergene (DNA Star®) and Bioedit software packages [8].
For molecular analyses and comparisons, a 439 (between
218–657. nucleotides; numbering according to AP92
strain (U04958)) bp long portion of S segment was used.
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out by distance
method using neighbor joining algorithm with Treecon,
version 1.3 b software [9]. Distances were calculated
under Kimura 2 parameter model. Transition/transversion ratio was estimated from the data. Neither insertions
nor deletions were taken into account. Topologic accuracy
of the tree was evaluated by bootstrap method (1000 replicates) and only bootstrap values ≥ 70% were considered
significant.

In both PCR assays 5.0 μl reverse transcription product
was added to the 45 μl reaction mixture consisted of 1 μl
forward primer (50 pmol/μl)) and 1 μl reverse primer (50
pmol/μl), 5 μl 10× reaction buffer, 3 μl 25 mM MgCl2, 1
μl dNTP stock (200 mM each dATP, dTTP, dCTP and
dGTP) (Fermentas®, Lithuania), 1.25 U Taq DNA
polymerase (Fermentas®, Lithuania) and 33.75 μl nuclease free water. For the second round amplification 2 μl
first round products were added to the 48 μl reaction mixture with the same concentrations of the first round mixture. Thermal cycling conditions are given in Table 1. The
amplification products were visualized following 1.5%
agarose gel electrophoresis under UV-light.
The second round PCR products were cleaned up with a
commercial PCR product purification kit (High Pure PCR
Product Purification Kit, Roche Diagnostics®, Germany)

Statistical analysis
Mean comparisons for continuous variables were done
using independent groups t tests. Proportion comparisons
for categorical variables were done using chi-square tests,
although Fisher's exact test was used when data were
sparse. A multivariate analysis was performed for the risk
factors of IgM positivity. Age, gender, agricultural activity,
dealing with husbandry, and history of tick bite were
included to the model as independent variables. Significance was set at p < 0.05 using two-sided comparisons.
STATA 10 (USA) software package was used in the analysis.

The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee
of Istanbul Branch of Ministry of Health in Turkey.

Results
The index case
The index case was a 6 years old child. He applied to the
emergency department of Haseki Education and Research
Hospital in Istanbul with the complaints of fever, malaise,
and the loss of appetite. He revealed the history of a tick
bite 3 days ago, while he attended to a picnic in Tasoluk
region of Istanbul. In his physical examination, the hyperemia in the site of tick bite was detected. In his laboratory
investigation, alanine aspartate transaminase (AST) was
found to be elevated (89 U/L, normal range: 5–42), activated partial thromboplastine time 43.7 second (normal
range: 23–35 second), and prothrombin time was 20.1
seconds (normal range: 12–15 seconds). White blood cell
count and platelet counts were found to be in normal limits. He was hospitalized for 10 days. The PCR for CCHFV
RNA was found to be positive, and serologic tests for antiCCHFV IgM and IgG by ELISA were found to be positive.
The child was defined as a mild case, and discharged with
total cure. His serum was obtained and retested by ELISA
three months and one year later. His serum was found to
be positive for CCHFV IgM and IgG antibodies three
months later, and positive only for CCHFV IgG antibodies
one year later.

The phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequence of
CCHFV revealed that, the strain was closely related to
AP92 strain, which was reported from Greece. The
sequence was deposited in gene bank under accession
number of EU057975, and named as KMAG-Hu-07-01.
Survey in the Region
In the first run, 39 (5.26%) subjects were found to be IgM
positive, and 35 (4.72%) subjects were IgG positive.
Thirty four out of 35 (97.4%) IgG positive patients were
also IgM positive. Only one subject had IgG positivity, but
IgM negativity (0.14%).

The second serologic analysis among IgM and/or IgG positives for CCHFV was performed 4 months later. Baseline
sera were re-tested simultaneously for both IgG and IgM.
All the IgM positivities except one, converted to IgG positivity. One IgG positive individual in the first run was
found to be IgG negative in the second run. The first positive result of this individual was accepted as false, and
this individual was considered as sero-negative. Accordingly, the analysis was performed among 38 IgM positive
individuals versus 703 IgM negative individuals. These 38
IgM positive subjects were asked for the history of myalgia, fever, and flu like illness during summer months.
Only one of the subjects had the complaints of myalgia
and fever at the same time with the index case. This person
attended to the same picnic with the index case.

The mean age was higher among IgM positive individuals
(54 vs 37, p < 0.001). Among the IgM seropositive individuals, being older (54 vs 37, p < 0.001), male gender
(76.3%, p = 0.001), performing agricultural activity
(39.5%, p = 0.036), and having history of tick bite
(15.8%, p = 0.014) were found to be significantly higher
than IgM negative individuals (Table 2).
In multivariate analysis, IgM positivity was higher among
older age (OR: 1.03, CI:1.01–1.05, p < 0.001) and males
(OR: 2.5, CI:1.15–5.63, p = 0.020) (Table 3).
Of the 56 ticks collected, 38 were identified as Boophilus
annulatus and 18 were Rhipicephalus bursa. No CCHFV
RNA was detected in ticks by RT-PCR.

Discussion
This was the first CCHF case detected in rural Istanbul.
This was a mild case according to the clinical and laboratory findings, which were described by Ergonul, et al [10].
The phylogenetic analysis of the partial S segment
sequences of the strain, namely KMAG-Hu-07-01 revealed
that it was closely related to AP92 strain reported from
Greece [11,12] (Figure 2). AP92 strain differs from all
known CCHFV strains (> 20% nucleotide difference),
forming an independent phylogenetic clade [13]. The
nucleotide sequence divergency between KMAG-Hu-0701 strain and AP92 was 8.63% (38/440). However, at
amino acid sequence level (146 amino acides) they differed only at two positions (1.36%). Previously reported
strains either from Anatolian or European (Thrace) parts

of Turkey were related to strains from Southern Russia and
Balkan countries (Figure 2) [4].
The disease course of CCHFV infection among children
was reported to be milder than adult patients [14]. The
infection with AP92 strain was reported to be asymptomatic [15]. Accordingly, 4 individuals among 65 tested in
the same region where AP92 strain was isolated in Greece,
had antibodies against CCHFV without recalling any
symptom resembling CCHF [15,16]. The results from a
broad serosurvey study, which included 3,040 serum samples from apparently healthy residents from 26 of 54
counties in Greece, revealed an overall prevalence of 1.1%
with a range from 0 to 6.3% [17].
The serosurvey studies for CCHFV infection in the region
was very limited, but the transmission dynamics and the
basic epidemiological measures such as the attack rate
should be described [18]. By performing a serosurvey, we
investigated the antibodies against overall CCHFV strains.
In the region, 5.26% of the subjects had IgM positivity,
and four months later all these IgM positive subjects,
except one, developed IgG positivity. The IgM positivity
implies the new infection. Except the presented case, the
rest did not seek medical advice, and these patients were
considered as asymptomatic cases. The attack rate for
overall CCHFV infection, that was defined as the proportion of diseased subjects among the infected ones was two
out of 38 (5.2%). The attack rate was very low compared
to the CCHFV strains reported from Russia, where the
attack rate was described as 20% previously [14]. One of
the possible explanations for this difference could be the
different virulent strains of CCHFV, but further studies are
needed.
The region, where the survey was performed was the closest counties to the place, where the index case was
attacked by the tick (Figure 1). In univariate analysis, age
(p < 0.001), male gender (p = 0.001), agricultural activity
(p = 0.036), and history of tick bite (p = 0.014) were
found to be associated with IgM positivity. In multivariate
analyes, IgM positivity was higher among older age group
(OR: 1.03, CI:1.01–1.05, p < 0.001) and males (OR: 2.5,
CI:1.15–5.63, p = 0.020) (Table 3). Being older and being
male could be the predisposing factors for the exposure to
the ticks, because of the increased working time in the
field.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/90

We couldn't isolate this strain, because of the lack of laboratory facilities with appropriate biosafety level. However, since this strain could be the agent for asymptomatic
infection, its isolation and further characterization could
be useful for undestanding the pathogenetic mechanisms
and for vaccine development against CCHFV.

Conclusion
A mild CCHF case from rural Balkanian part of Istanbul,
who was infected by AP92 like CCHFV strain, which is
new in Turkey was described. The strain was detected only
from Greece previously, and was reported as the cause of
asymptomatic infection. The attack rate for overall CCHF
infection was very low (5.2%) in the region. The infection
was more common among the males and older people,
who work in the field.

In previous studies, Hyalomma marginatum, which is the
main vector of CCHFV was detected as the most frequent
tick in Anatolia. However, the limited number of ticks collected in the region were typed as Boophilus annulatus and
Rhipicephalus bursa. Further studies with larger numbers of
ticks are necessary to describe the associaton between the
tick species and the CCHV infection.
