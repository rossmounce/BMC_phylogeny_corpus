The complete Ac/Ds transposon family of maize
Chunguang Du1*, Andrew Hoffman1, Limei He2, Jason Caronna1 and Hugo K Dooner2,3*

Abstract
Background: The nonautonomous maize Ds transposons can only move in the presence of the autonomous
element Ac. They comprise a heterogeneous group that share 11-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and some
subterminal repeats, but vary greatly in size and composition. Three classes of Ds elements can cause mutations:
Ds-del, internal deletions of the 4.6-kb Ac element; Ds1, ~400-bp in size and sharing little homology with Ac, and
Ds2, variably-sized elements containing about 0.5 kb from the Ac termini and unrelated internal sequences. Here,
we analyze the entire complement of Ds-related sequences in the genome of the inbred B73 and ask whether
additional classes of Ds-like (Ds-l) elements, not uncovered genetically, are mobilized by Ac. We also compare the
makeup of Ds-related sequences in two maize inbreds of different origin.
Results: We found 903 elements with 11-bp Ac/Ds TIRs flanked by 8-bp target site duplications. Three resemble Ac,
but carry small rearrangements. The others are much shorter, once extraneous insertions are removed. There are
331 Ds1 and 39 Ds2 elements, many of which are likely mobilized by Ac, and two novel classes of Ds-l elements.
Ds-l3 elements lack subterminal homology with Ac, but carry transposase gene fragments, and represent decaying
Ac elements. There are 44 such elements in B73. Ds-l4 elements share little similarity with Ac outside of the 11-bp
TIR, have a modal length of ~1 kb, and carry filler DNA which, in a few cases, could be matched to gene
fragments. Most Ds-related elements in B73 (486/903) fall in this class. None of the Ds-l elements tested responded
to Ac. Only half of Ds insertion sites examined are shared between the inbreds B73 and W22.
Conclusions: The majority of Ds-related sequences in maize correspond to Ds-l elements that do not transpose in
the presence of Ac. Unlike actively transposing elements, many Ds-l elements are inserted in repetitive DNA, where
they probably become methylated and begin to decay. The filler DNA present in most elements is occasionally
captured from genes, a rare feature in transposons of the hAT superfamily to which Ds belongs. Maize inbreds of
different origin are highly polymorphic in their DNA transposon makeup.

Background
The first transposable element discovered by McClintock [1] was Ds (Dissociation). Ds could break chromosomes at its site of insertion and could move in
response to another factor, which she named Ac (Activator) and showed to be self-mobilizing or autonomous
[2]. Shortly after this discovery, McClintock established
that there were two types of Ac-responsive Ds elements:
those that caused chromosome breaks at high frequency
and those that did not. She named the former state I Ds
and the latter, state II Ds [3]. Thus, early on, it became
clear that Ds elements could differ genetically. Yet, a

common origin for these elements was suggested by the
observation that state I elements could change to state
II. How heterogeneous Ds elements are only became
clear after Ac and Ds were isolated and characterized
molecularly [4-6].
The 4.6-kb autonomous Ac element makes a single
3.8-kb transcript that spans most of the element’s length
and encodes an 807-amino acid putative transposase [7].
It causes an 8-bp target site duplication (TSD), ends in
11-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and contains,
within the terminal 200 bp at either end, multiple copies
of a hexameric repeat to which the Ac transposase binds
[8]. Ds elements share TIRs with Ac and also cause 8-bp
duplications of the target site. Three very different kinds
of Ds elements can transpose and cause mutations in
response to Ac. Ds-del elements are simple internal
deletion derivatives of Ac found predominantly in

genetic stocks that recently carried an active Ac [4,9,10].
Ds1 elements are short (~400 bp) and share with Ac
only the 11 bp TIRs and a few of the subterminal hexameric repeats [11]. Ds2 elements are > 1 kb in length
and share extensive sequence homology with Ac in the
terminal 200 bp at either end [12]. In many Ds2 elements, a large part of Ac’s internal sequence has been
replaced with an unrelated or “filler” sequence. The ability of Ds elements to cause chromosome breaks turned
out to be a function of their structure: all chromosome
breakers have multiple transposon ends [5,13,14].
Ac and genetically defined Ds elements transpose preferentially into unique or low-copy sequences and largely avoid the repetitive DNA that makes up the bulk of
the maize genome [15,16]. Therefore, these elements are
highly efficient insertion mutagens. Ac is absent from
most maize lines or populations and present in usually
one copy in lines with Ac activity. In contrast, many Dshybridizing sequences are present in the genomes of all
lines examined [17], but there has not been yet a concerted effort to characterize all the sequences related to
Ds in the maize genome. To that end, we created a
heuristic searching algorithm based on the sequence of
the Ac/Ds TIRs and the size of the TSD and ran it
through the maize pseudomolecules. Each Ds-related
element identified via this search was individually numbered, annotated, and had its insertion site categorized
according to uniqueness and content in the B73 maize
genome sequence [18].
A total of 903 elements with Ds sequence features
were located within the B73 genome. A minority
resembled previously described elements: there are 331
Ds1 and 39 Ds2 elements, most of which are probably
mobilized by Ac. In addition, two new classes of Ds-like
(Ds-l) elements were identified. Ds-l3 elements lack
extensive subterminal homology with Ac, but carry fragments from various parts of the Ac transposase gene.
There are 44 such elements in B73. Ds-l4 elements
share little similarity with Ac outside of the 11-bp TIR
and have a modal length of ~1 kb. The majority of Dsrelated elements in B73 (486/903) fall in this class.
None of the Ds-l elements tested were excised by Ac.
Unlike Ac and recently transposed Ds elements, about
half of the Ds-related elements identified in this study
had inserted in repetitive DNA. Conversely, repetitive
sequences, such as long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, were found within some Ds-l elements. Some
elements carried gene fragments, a rare feature of transposons of the hAT superfamily to which Ds belongs,
though a common feature of other transposons. Lastly,
only half of Ds insertion sites examined were shared
between the inbreds B73 and W22, indicating that the
makeup of DNA transposons will vary greatly among
inbreds of unrelated origin.

Methods
Development and implementation of the Ds discovery
algorithm

The 11-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIR) are specific
sequences that define the 5’ end (C/TAGGGATGAAA)
and 3’ end (TTTCATCCCTA) of each Ac/Ds element
and play a key role in transposition [19-22]. The other
identifying trait of an Ac/Ds element is the target site
duplication (TSD). Not part of the transposon, the TSD
is a direct repeat of the same 8 base pairs upstream and
downstream of the TIR. Unlike the 11-bp TIR, the 8-bp
TSD is not a specific sequence. Rather, because it is the
site where the Ds element inserted into the genome, the
TSD can be almost any combination of 8 bp. Based on
the sequence characteristics of Ac and Ds elements, we
developed a data mining algorithm, written in PERL, to
search through the maize pseudomolecules for Ds
sequences and found sequences with perfect TIRs and
identical TSD sequences and with TIRs and TSD
sequences differing by up to 2 bp. The algorithm generated putative Ds elements and identified the position of
their TSD in the genome. Putative Ds elements were
then used to BLAST-search the maize genome database
for related Ds sequences in which the TIRs or TSDs differed by more than 2 bp.
Because known Ds1 elements are smaller than 500 bp
and Ds2 elements are larger than 1 kb, all elements
were first separated by length into groups of elements
measuring < 500 bp, 500 to 1000 bp, 1000 to 5000 bp,
and > 5000 bp. Then, elements were located in the
maize genome via BLAST, and redundant sequences
were eliminated. Each sequence was then compared to
known Ds1 and Ds2 elements using BLAST2, and categorized based on those results. The nature of the target
sites was determined by a series of tests, including presence of start and stop codons, presence of untranslated
region sequences, EST (expressed sequence tag) support,
and presence of corresponding mRNA in GenBank.
Prior annotation of the predicted Ds elements and of
the genome sequences 200 bp upstream and downstream from the element’s insertion site were checked in
the database at maizesequence.org. The 200 bp flanking
each element were analyzed for uniqueness using
BLAST, maizesequence.org, and RepeatMasker http://
www.repeatmasker.org/. The 200-bp subterminal regions
within each sequence were examined for the AAACGG
6-bp hexamer repeats which bind the Ac transposase
[8]. Only three copies of these hexamers in the 5’ end
have been shown to be required for transposition [23].
Assay for Ds mobility

The B73 stock used in the Ds mobility assay was
obtained from the USDA North Central Region Plant
Introduction Station at Ames, IA (PI-550473). The W22

Du et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:588
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/588

stocks used were: the standard Wx version and a version
carrying wx-m7(Ac), an unstable wx allele described by
McClintock [24]. This allele arose by insertion of the
4.6-kb Ac element in the 5’ untranslated region of the
Wx gene [20,25]. Activation of Ds excision by Ac was
monitored by PCR in an F1 between B73 and the W22
stock carrying wx-m7(Ac) [15]. DNA was extracted from
young seedling leaves and PCR reactions were run as
described [26]. PCR primers were designed based on the
500 bp sequences flanking each Ds element end. All primer sequences are listed in Additional File 1, Table S1.
Analysis of Ds elements in W22

Physically sheared W22 DNA was size-fractionated by
agarose gel electrophoresis to a 300- to 500-bp size
range. Sheared DNA ends were blunt-ended and kinased
with an Epicentre End-It DNA end repairing kit and
adaptors were ligated with T4 DNA ligase. PCR amplifications were carried out with an adaptor primer and
primers ending in the Ac/Ds TIRs. PCR products were
cloned into pGEM-T easy vector and sequenced in a
3730 DNA analyzer.

Results
Structure of Ds-related elements

Ds1 elements are short, less than 500 bp in length, and
share little sequence in common with Ac, other than the

11-bp TIRs and a few copies of the AAACGG hexameric repeat found in the Ac subterminal regions (Figure
1). They were first detected in unstable mutations
[6,27,28] and are known to occur in at least 50 copies in
the genomes of all maize lines [29]. In contrast, Ds2 elements are much closer to Ac, sharing with Ac the ~200
bp subterminal regions (STR) and variable stretches of
internal sequence, and appear to have originated from
Ac by deletion (Figure 1). Most carry, in addition, “filler”
sequence from other parts of the genome [30,31]. They
have been estimated to occur in about a dozen copies
and, like Ds1, have been found in several unstable
mutations.
In addition to the previously described Ds1 and Ds2
element classes, we have identified a large number of
elements that, though containing the hallmark Ac/Ds
TIRs and flanking an 8-bp duplication, do not match
any previously described Ds sequences. They lack
obvious homology to Ac in the terminal 200 bp
sequences and may not be mobilized by Ac, so we have
referred to them as Ds-like (Ds-l) elements. Ds-l elements can be divided into two groups, Ds-l3 and Ds-l4.
Ds-l3 elements have an average length of 4 kb and
retain parts of exons 2 and 3 of the Ac transposase (Figure 1). Ds-l4 elements are on average about 1 kb long
and, though very numerous and variable in sequence, do
not differ much in size. The homology between Ds-l4

Figure 1 Structure of different types of Ds elements compared with Ac. Ac is 4565-bp long and encodes a 5-exon transposase. Ds1
elements are the shortest and share little in common with Ac. Ds2 elements have ~200 bp of the Ac subterminal region at each end. Ds-l3
elements carry sequences corresponding to parts of exons 2 and 3 of the Ac transposase and are the longest Ds elements, on average. Ds-l4
elements have a modal length of about 1 kb and share with Ac only about 30 bp at either end.

and Ac is restricted to little more than 30 bp on the 5’
and 3’ ends (Figure 1).
Content of Ds-related elements in B73

The chromosomal distribution of all 903 Ds-related elements in B73 is shown in Table 1. There are 331 Ds1,
39 Ds2, 44 Ds-l3, and 486 Ds-l4 elements in the B73
genome (Additional File 1, Tables S2-S5). A c 2 test
showed no significant difference between the observed
distribution of Ds-related elements per chromosome and
the expected distribution based on chromosome length
in the 10 chromosomes of B73 (Figure 2).
Three elements, classified here as Ac-like elements,
share a large amount of similarity with Ac, save for
small indels. A similar element called Ac-cryptic has
been described previously [32]. As anticipated from its
history [33], the B73 genome contains no simple deletion derivatives of Ac. More than 90% of Ds-related elements in the genome fall either in the Ds1 or Ds-l4
classes. Ds1 elements were known to be numerous
based on earlier hybridization data [11], but their copy
number had been estimated to be around 50, so the present analysis of the maize genome sequence pushes up
their number at least sixfold. Of the 331 Ds1 elements
in B73, 184 were identified as such by the maize
sequencing effort (maizesequence.org), 4 were incompletely annotated, and 143 were missed (Table 2). All 39
Ds2 elements identified here had variable filler
sequences unrelated to Ac. Of the 39, only 2 were fully
annotated as Ds sequences in the maizesequence.org
database, 26 were partially annotated, and 11 were
missed. We searched the B73 genome for the specific
Ds2 elements previously isolated from unstable mutations and found that the element in wx-B4 [34] was present in two copies (Ds2-2 and Ds2-15 in Additional File
1, Table S3), but those in adh1-2F11 [12] or sh2-m1
[30] were absent.

None of the Ds-l elements was annotated as a full Ds
element in maizesequence.org. Among the 44 Ds-l3 elements, 42 were partially annotated as Ds and 2 are new.
Notably, of the 486 Ds-l4 elements, only 62 had been
partially annotated as Ds elements, while the remaining
424 had been missed. Despite their dissimilarities with
the Ac sequence, the Ds-l4 elements themselves are
related to each other. A Jalview phylogram [35,36]
shows that Ds-l4 elements fall into 3 main clusters,
after excluding from the alignment the 30 elements that
are larger than 5 kb (Additional File 2, Figure S1). The
Ds-l4 elements in each cluster have a high degree of
similarity throughout. Cluster 1 (top part of the phylogenetic tree) contains 57 elements, cluster 2 (middle of
the phylogenetic tree) contains 339 elements, and cluster 3 (bottom of the phylogenetic tree) contains 60
elements.
Nature of Ds insertion sites

Ds1 and Ds2 sequences have been shown to cause
mutations
when
they
insert
into
genes
[6,12,30,31,37-39], so it is not surprising that several Ds
and Ds-l sequences were found in or near genes. As
shown in Table 3, 37 Ds1 (11%), 5 Ds2 (13%), 2 Ds-l3
(5%), and 34 Ds-l4 (7%) elements had inserted in or
within 200 bp of a gene model. Given the propensity for
Ac and Ds to insert into or near genes, it was surprising
that relatively few Ds elements mapped into or near
genes in B73. It would appear, then, that somewhat
lower percentages of Ds-l than Ds elements are found
near genes. Similarly, slightly higher percentages of Ds-l
elements are inserted in repetitive or intergenic lowcopy DNA (49.8% vs. 41.5%, respectively). Overall higher
percentages of Ds-related elements are found in repetitive DNA sequences than would have been expected
from prior genetic analyses of recently transposed Ac or
Ds elements in maize [15,16].

Although transposons from other superfamilies, such as
MULEs [40], CACTA [41], and Helitrons [42,43], can
take up gene fragments, this property has not been
reported for members of the hAT superfamily, to which
Ds belongs [7]. In this study, we have identified both
Ds2 and Ds-l4 elements that carry gene fragments (Figure 3).
Two Ds2 elements appear to have captured gene fragments. Ds2-22 carries exons 5 and 6 and the intervening
intron from an IAA amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like3
gene. This gene fragment appears to have been copied
from its original location on chromosome 2 onto Ds222, which resides on chromosome 9 of B73 (Figure 4).
The sequence carried in the Ds2-18 element is annotated as a complete gene encoding hypothetical protein

LOC100383699. This annotation is supported by EST
and mRNA evidence. However, all copies of this coding
sequence are transposon-borne in B73, raising doubts as
to the functional significance of the transcript in the
sequence database.
Similarly, some Ds-l4 elements appear to have captured
gene fragments. Ds-l4-354, which resides on chromosome 8 of B73, carries a fragment of the ZmMybst1 gene,
which is located on chromosome 9 (Figure 4). The 7344bp Ds-l4-483 element on chromosome 10 is an example
of a compound Ds-l4 element that has trapped extraneous sequences between its termini (Figure 5). Bases 1987 of Ds-l4-483 correspond to a regular Ds-l4 element
with perfect TIRs flanked by a TSD. Directly following
this are: a fragment of an LTR-retrotransposon

polyprotein (988 to 1650), a transcribed sequence from
chromosome 5 (1651 to 6537), and a duplicate, but truncated, copy of the first Ds-l4 in this compound element,
ending in a perfect TIR and an additional copy of the
TSD (6538 to 7344).
Two additional sets of transcribed sequences, found in
the GenBank mRNA database, are carried by repetitive
Ds-l4 elements. Ds-l4-93, Ds-l4-135, Ds-l4-307, and Dsl4-343 contain the two putative exons of Zea mays
clone 1443778 mRNA and Ds-l4-244, Ds-l4-275, and
Ds-l4-368 contain the two putative exons of Zea mays
clone 1451145 mRNA. The introns separating these
exons in the elements end in canonical GT-AG. Neither
mRNA encodes a protein with a homolog in the
sequence databases, so again, it is conceivable that the

Figure 5 Compound Ds-l4 element with trapped extraneous sequences between its termini. The Ds-l4-483 element on chromosome 10 is
7344-bp in length. Bases 1-987 of Ds-l4-483 correspond to a regular Ds-l4 element with perfect TIRs flanked by a TSD. Following this are a
fragment of an LTR-retrotransposon polyprotein (988 to 1650), a transcribed sequence from chromosome 5 (1651 to 6537), and a duplicate, but
truncated, copy of the first Ds-l4 in this compound element, ending in a perfect TIR and an additional copy of the TSD (6538 to 7344).

only copies of the transcribed sequences in the genome
are those carried in the transposons. Nevertheless, the
presence in different chromosomes of multiple copies of
two sets of two Ds-l4 elements with almost identical
transcribed sequences suggests that these elements
transposed in the recent past, after acquisition of the
sequences.
Nongenic insertions in Ds element

Large insertions were found in all Ds element classes
(Figure 3). Not surprisingly, the majority were LTR retrotransposons, which constitute the bulk of the maize
genome [44]. Ten Ds1 elements were much longer than
average, measuring between 0.8 and 24 kb. LTR retrotransposons were inserted in six of them (Additional
File 1, Table S2). Although the average length of Ds2
elements was approximately 1.4 kb, some, such as Ds213, were as long as 12.7 kb as a result of LTR retrotransposon insertions (Additional File 1, Table S3). Similarly,
LTR retrotransposons were inserted in 7 Ds-l3 and 35
Ds-l4 elements (Additional File 1, Tables S4 and S5).
Though less numerous, DNA transposons were also
found inside of Ds elements. For example, a Ds-l4 element was nested inside of Ds-l3-15. This nesting pattern
is common for LTR retrotransposons [45], but rarer for
Ds transposon types, probably because nested Ds elements acquire chromosome-breaking properties [46]
and would be selected against. In agreement, no chromosome-breaking double Ds [5] was detected in B73. In
addition to transposons, intergenic sequences without
obvious transposons properties could be found inside of

Ds elements. These most likely represent DNA capture
events that do not include coding sequences. Intergenic
DNA sequences of various lengths were found in 4 Ds1,
1 Ds-l3, and 14 Ds-l4 elements (Additional File 1, Tables
S1, S3, and S4).
Mobility of Ds and Ds-l elements

The terminal 200 bp at either end of Ac are required for
wild-type levels of transposition [47]. Within these terminal sequences, there are multiple AAACGG repeats that
bind to the Ac transposase in a cooperative fashion and
are, most likely, the subterminal sequences that impart
specificity to the transposition reaction [8,22,23]. Only
three copies of these hexamers have been shown to be
required for transposition [23]. The number of B73 Dsrelated elements with 3 or more copies of the subterminal repeat in each class are: 17 of 331 Ds1, all 39 Ds2,
37 of 44 Ds-l3, and 438 of 486 Ds-l4 (Table 4). Thus,
the vast majority of Ds2, Ds-l3, and Ds-l4 elements contain 3 or more AAACGG repeats within their subterminal regions, but only a few Ds1 elements do. However,
the lack of these hexamers does not preclude transposability, as some Ds1 sequences lack them and are still
able to transpose, probably because the transposase can
interact with sequences related to, though not identical
with, the hexameric repeat [8].
In order to test the mobility of the newly identified
Ds-l3, Ds-l4, and control Ds2 elements in response to
Ac, we developed the following PCR excision assay.
We first identified Ds-l3, Ds-l4, and Ds2 elements in
B73 that had inserted in single-copy DNA and were

in spite of possessing subterminal AAACGG hexamers,
neither Ds-l3 nor Ds-l4 elements are able to transpose.
Possibly, the 5’ and 3’ ends of Ds-l3 and Ds-l4
elements, as well as of 17 of 39 Ds2 elements (alignment data not shown), are too defective to be mobilized by Ac.

shared with the inbred W22. We then crossed B73
with the W22 genetic stock c wx-m7(Ac) and monitored filial and parental DNAs for the presence of a
somatic Ds excision or “empty” site in the F1, but not
in B73. Figure 6 shows the PCR results for representative elements. Ds2-21 shows a clear excision band in
the F1, whereas Ds2-31 does not (Figure 6A), indicating that the former can transpose in response to Ac,
but the latter cannot. An alignment of the 5’ and 3’
ends of Ds2-21 and Ds2-31 with Ac (Figure 7) reveals
that Ds2-31 has undergone a duplication-deletion at
the 3’ end, which probably interferes with its mobility.
On the other hand, none of the shared Ds-l elements

The only complete maize genome sequence in the public domain is that of the B73 inbred. This genome is
constantly being revised and recompiled, and serves as
the de facto maize database for BLAST. The W22 inbred
line is being utilized in genetic studies aimed at developing Ac/Ds transposon tagging resources [15,16], so
knowledge of the full complement of Ds-related elements in W22 would be valuable. In the course of this
study, we found that 9 of 18 Ds or Ds-l elements present in B73 were absent in W22 (e.g., Ds-l4-176 in Figure 6B), which precluded a PCR test for excision in the
F1. To estimate the fraction of Ds insertion sites in W22
that are not shared with B73, we proceeded to isolate Ds
5’ junction sequences in W22 by a modified transposon
display procedure, sequenced a set of random clones,
identified 25 different junctions, and BLASTed them
against the B73 genome. Only 13 matched Ds insertion
sites in B73, (e.g., Ds1-208, Ds2-35, Ds-l3-21, Ds-l4-61,
Ds-l4-169, and Ds-l4-346). Although only a small sample
of Ds sites was analyzed, it is clear that a sizable fraction
of Ds element insertion sites are polymorphic between
these two inbred lines.

band expected from somatic Ds2-21 excision. The absence of that band in the wx-m7(Ac) homozygotes (lanes 6-7) can be attributed to the wellestablished negative dosage effect of Ac [59]. No somatic excision of Ds2-31 could be detected in the Ac/+ heterozygous F1 individuals (lanes
16-17). (B) Ds-l4-176 and Ds-l4-199 elements. Lanes: 1, B73, plant #1; 2, wx-m7 plant #2; 3, F1 (B73-1 × wx-m7-2); 4, B73, plant #1; 5, wx-m7 plant

assayed. No somatic excision of Ds-l4-199 could be detected in the Ac/+ heterozygous F1 individuals (lane 6).

Discussion
Novel Ds-like elements

We report here a comprehensive analysis of Ds and Dslike elements in the genome of B73, a maize inbred that
lacks Ac activity (Additional File 1, Tables S2-S5). Two
novel classes of Ds-like elements, Ds-l3 and Ds-l4, were
identified in this study. Although they share TIR
sequences with Ac, Ds-l3 elements differ greatly from Ac
in the subterminal regions. Most Ds-l3 elements contain
sequences from exons 2 and 3, the two largest exons of
the 807-amino acid Ac transposase, but lack the C terminus, which is highly conserved among hAT elements
and correlates with transposase activity [48]. The Acmatching areas of these Ds-l3 elements have been incorrectly annotated as belonging to Ac elements in the maizesequence.org database.
Ds-l4 elements have the least in common with Ac, just
30 bp at either end, which explains why they had
escaped detection until the present work, even though
they comprise the majority of Ds-related sequences in
the genome (54%). Ds1 elements, an established mobile
clade within the Ac/Ds family, also share little in common with Ac beyond their TIR sequences. The main differences between Ds-l4 and Ds1 sequences are: their
length, the former being about twice as large; the fraction of elements with 3 or more copies of the AAACGG
subterminal repeat (438/486 vs. 17/331, respectively),
and the nature of the non-Ac filler sequence. Ds1 elements share a common filler which exhibits minimal
sequence variation [27]. Ds-l4 elements, on the other
hand, have variable filler sequences, although their phylogenetic analysis reveals clusters of related elements
(Additional File 2, Figure S1). The high copy number
and high degree of similarity of the filler sequences in
each cluster make it difficult to identify the original
source of these sequences in the genome.
Our algorithm provided for up to 2-bp variation in
either the element’s TIR or the host TSD. To determine

if the algorithm had missed any elements not flanked by
a TSD, which is dispensable for transposition [49,50],
we removed the TSD requirement from our script. The
new search produced only 11 additional putative elements, with flanking host sequence identity ranging
from 1 in 8 to 5 in 8. There were 3 Ds1, 1 Ds2, 2 Dsl3,
and 5 not clearly related to any of the classes identified
in this study. The ends of these 5 elements are well conserved, so probably all of them represent Ds elements at
various stages of decay. This exercise suggests that we
have essentially defined the entire Ac-Ds family in
maize.
Transposition of Ds and Ds-l elements

The hexameric repeat sequence AAACGG located in
the STR of Ac is necessary for transposition [8,22]. All
Ds2, 37 Ds-l3, and 438 Ds-l4 elements possessed hexamers in numbers judged sufficient for transposition [23].
However, none of the Ds-l elements tested by our PCR
assay showed evidence of somatic excision in the presence of Ac, whereas the tested Ds2 elements did. The
most likely explanation for this negative result is that
the 5’ and 3’ ends of Ds-l3 and Ds-l4 elements are too
defective to be mobilized by Ac. Alternatively, these elements may reside in hypermethylated DNA, which has
been shown to inhibit Ac transposition [51]. The methylation status of Ds sequences was not analyzed, as this
was beyond the scope of the present study. Multiple
copies of the hexameric repeat may not be the key
requirement for Ds1 mobility because some known
mobile Ds1 elements contain just one copy of the repeat
[11,27]. Of the 331 Ds1 elements in the B73 genome,
314 lack them. Kunze and Starlinger [8] have emphasized that the lack of these hexamers does not exclude
an element from being able to transpose. Ds1 elements
are presumed to be transposable because other subterminal sequences may also interact with the transposase
complex.

The occurrence of LTR retrotransposon sequences in
Ds and Ds-like elements is not surprising because these
sequences constitute more than three quarters of the
maize genome [18]. An answer to the question of
whether or not their increased size renders these elements nontransposable can be sought in the existing literature. There are several examples of Ds elements with
large, unrelated stretches of DNA that can still transpose, provided an Ac element is present in the genome
[52-54]. More recently, a macrotransposon with a Ds
element at one end and an Ac element at the other was
shown to mobilize as much as 100 kb of intervening
DNA consisting mostly of nested retrotransposons [55].
Thus, it is unlikely that increased size alone makes Ds-l
elements incapable of tranposition.
Gene capture

Several different types of DNA transposons, including
the recently discovered Helitrons, are known to pick up
fragments of genes from the genome. However, there
are no reports of gene fragment capture by hAT elements in the literature. Here, we identified 2 Ds2 and 9
Ds-l4 elements containing gene fragments. How excisive
DNA transposons acquire gene fragments is not known,
but it has been suggested that host sequence capture
may result from DNA replication errors during repair of
the double strand breaks caused by transposon excision
[56].
The notion that gene capture proceeds via genomic
DNA, as in all other DNA transposons, is supported by
the two cases of Ds2 elements with trapped gene
sequences. In the Ds2-22 element, which carries a fragment of an IAA amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like 3 gene,
the intron sequence between exons 5 and 6 is present,
arguing against capture from an mRNA. Ds2-22 is on
chromosome 9, whereas the donor gene is on chromosome 2 (Figure 4.). The second Ds2 element is more
intriguing. A homologous transcript of unknown function, with putative start and stop codons, can be found
in the maize mRNA sequence database. Ds-l4 elements
can also carry database-supported, transcribed genomic
sequences containing introns. For some of them, the
donor gene can be identified. An example of a captured
sequence from a known gene is provided by Ds-l4-354,
with the element on chromosome 8 and the donor gene
on chromosome 9 (Figure 4). However, putative donor
gene sequences for other fragments could not be found
in the current version of the B73 genome, suggesting
that the corresponding Ds-l4 transcripts in the databases
may represent nonfunctional transcriptional baggage.
Ds content of different inbreds

The Ds content of the inbred W22, used in its wx-m7 version as the Ac source for the Ds-l4 excision assay, was

Page 10 of 12

surveyed in this study. Of 25 Ds or Ds-l junctions isolated
from W22, only one-half (13) were shared by B73. Though
these two inbreds fall into different heterotic groups [57],
they represent germplasm adapted to the U.S. Corn Belt.
We infer that, as has been found for retrotransposons
[58], the content of most DNA transposons will be highly
polymorphic among maize lines.
We can also compare the distribution of Ds elements
accumulated over time in B73 with that of recently transposed Ds elements in W22, the inbred used by Vollbrecht
et al. [15] in their studies. Additional File 3, Figure S2
shows the distribution of Ds elements in each pseudomolecule of the B73 genome. While a statistical comparison
is unwarranted because of the smaller number of elements in our study (no chromosomal region has ≥10
insertions), a visual comparison reveals similar trends:
low concentration of elements in the centromeric regions
and high concentration of elements in the distal tips of
some arms. particularly 1L, 2S, 5L, 7L, and 8L.

Conclusion
Transposons, recognized today as ubiquitous components of eukaryotic genomes, were first identified six
decades ago by their disruption of chromosomal integrity and their mutagenic effects on genes. The elegant
genetic analysis of gene mutations that served as reporters for their movement served to elucidate many transposon properties, but the complexity of transposon
families has only been revealed by whole genome
sequencing projects. Here we report on an in-depth analysis of all the sequences in the maize genome that are
related to Dissociation (Ds), the first transposon ever
described. Our bioinformatic approach has uncovered
over 900 Ds-related sequences, including two novel
classes that account for the majority of elements in the
family. These novel elements have diverged significantly
from Ds and, though clearly related to Ds, do not appear
to transpose in today’s maize genome. Unlike actively
transposing elements, many of the Ds-related elements
are inserted in repetitive DNA, where they probably
become immobile and begin to decay. A second maize
inbred line shared only half of its Ds insertion sites with
B73, suggesting that present-day maize inbred lines differ greatly in their DNA transposon make-up.
