Abstract
Background: The amphipod crustacean Palmorchestia hypogaea occurs only in La Palma (Canary
Islands) and is one of the few terrestrial amphipods in the world that have adapted to a strictly
troglobitic life in volcanic cave habitats. A surface-dwelling closely related species (Palmorchestia
epigaea) lives in the humid laurel forest on the same island. Previous studies have suggested that an
ancestral littoral Orchestia species colonized the humid forests of La Palma and that subsequent
drought episodes in the Canaries reduced the distribution of P. epigaea favouring the colonization
of lava tubes through an adaptive shift. This was followed by dispersal via the hypogean crevicular
system.
Results: P. hypogaea and P. epigaea did not form reciprocally monophyletic mitochondrial DNA
clades. They showed geographically highly structured and genetically divergent populations with
current gene flow limited to geographically close surface locations. Coalescence times using
Bayesian estimations assuming a non-correlated relaxed clock with a normal prior distribution of
the age of La Palma, together with the lack of association of habitat type with ancestral and recent
haplotypes, suggest that their adaptation to cave life is relatively ancient.
Conclusion: The data gathered here provide evidence for multiple invasions of the volcanic cave
systems that have acted as refuges. A re-evaluation of the taxonomic status of the extant species
of Palmorchestia is needed, as the division of the two species by habitat and ecology is unnatural.
The information obtained here, and that from previous studies on hypogean fauna, shows the
importance of factors such as the uncoupling of morphological and genetic evolution, the role of
climatic change and regressive evolution as key processes in leading to subterranean biodiversity.

Background
Subterranean ecosystems are considered natural laboratories to study the effect of temporal and spatial isolation on
genetic divergence [1]. Environmental stability, perma-

nent darkness and oligotrophy are characteristics of caves,
either terrestrial (inhabited by so-called troglobites) or
sub-aquatic (occupied by stygobionts). The subterranean
environment puts their inhabitants under stress condi-

tions, including "perpetual darkness and humidity, lack of
some environmental cues, complex mazelike living space,
stressful gas mixtures, patchy food resources, barren rocky
substrates and occasional flooding" [2].
The evolutionary patterns of the hypogean fauna are
barely known, and precise data on the genetic and biogeographic processes associated with the adaptation to this
habitat have only recently begun to be gathered [3-13].
Adaptation to hypogean conditions involves a series of
physiological, morphological and behavioural changes
collectively known as troglomorphy [14,15]. These adaptations are common to animals as diverse as arthropods,
flatworms and vertebrates, suggesting that they are the
result of evolutionary convergence caused by living under
similar selective pressures to those posed by the hypogean
habitat [1,16]. Some of the most studied characteristics in
that respect are eye reduction and the loss of pigmentation
(body and eye pigments) that Darwin [17] attributed to
regressions caused by disuse. Nevertheless, adaptation to
these conditions seems to involve also other 'non-regressive' morphological changes, such as elongation of the
body, antennae and legs of insects or crustaceans and the
exacerbation of sensory organs (e.g. lateral receptors in
fish or copepod antennules). Extreme convergence in cave
life can also obscure species relationships and their geographical limits [3].
Gammaridean amphipod crustaceans have a considerable
number of subterranean stygobiont species in many
regions of the world [18]. The global subterranean amphipod fauna comprises more than 700 species embracing 36
families and 138 genera [18,19]. However, amphipods of
the family Talitridae (sandhoppers and landhoppers) are
the only representatives of the order with strictly terrestrial
species, being mainly soil inhabitants of beaches and
tropical humid forests. Of these, only two species are
known to have adapted to a strictly troglobitic life in volcanic cave habitats: Spelaeorchestia koloana [20] in Kaua'i
(Hawaiian Islands) and Palmorchestia hypogaea [21] in the
Canary Islands. A third species, Orchestia remyi (accepted
as O. roffoensis Wildish, 1969) from Corsica, is microphthalmous and presumably has adapted to subterranean
life in karstic caves. P. hypogaea is exclusively found in lava
tubes on the island of La Palma showing troglobitic morphological characters and lifestyle. These include strong
eye reduction (significantly fewer partly depigmented and
smaller ommatidia than other landhoppers), the complete loss of body pigmentation and very elongated
appendages [21,22]. P. hypogaea is also one of the few
hypogean taxa for which an epigean occulated, pigmented
close relative species (P. epigaea) is known to occur
nearby, in the litter of the humid laurel forest on the same
island [21].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/7

Stygobiont amphipods display biogeographic patterns
caused by past episodes of colonization by epigean fresh
or marine/brackish water ancestors. Adaptive shifts,
stream capture, regression of marine embayments and
fluctuating sea levels have been recognized as the main
driving forces underlying these biogeographic patterns
[19]. In landhoppers, Stock [21] suggested an evolutionary scenario for the adaptation of P. epigaea to the lava
tubes of La Palma. Given the similarity of some morphological characters of the forest-dwelling P. epigaea with
marine/supralittoral extant Orchestia species such as O.
gammarellus, he proposed that an ancestral littoral Orchestia species once colonized the humid forests of La Palma.
The recent advent of relative drought episodes in the
Canaries would have reduced the previously wider distribution of P. epigaea to dark, humid forest pockets remaining at altitudes between 500 and 700 m, especially in the
more humid northern and north-eastern face of the
island. Drought episodes have been deduced from analyses of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands) paleodunes [23],
showing a first cycle at 1.7–1.8 million years ago (MYA)
and more recent ones dated from 75,000 to 90,000 years
ago, and around 15,000 and 3,640 years before present.
These episodes could have affected the island of La Palma,
thus creating selection pressures favouring the colonization of deep crevices and lava tubes with enough humid
conditions, through an adaptive shift. Alternatively, local
extinction of epigean ancestors by the drought episodes
mentioned above, and survival of populations in the
hypogean habitat and dark humid areas could explain the
observed pattern (consistent with the climate relict
hypothesis proposed in [24]). In any case, two evolutionary transitions, one from the littoral to inland environment, followed by another from forest to cave habitats,
should have occurred in a period within 2,000,000 years,
the K-Ar dating for the oldest subaerial lava flows known
on the island [25]. It is unclear why other species of the
genus Orchestia occurring in humid laurel forests on other
Canary Islands (such as the endemic O. guancha from Tenerife and O. gomeri from La Gomera) have not colonized
the subterranean habitat of their respective islands.
Another important issue concerns the dispersal potential
of subterranean animals and whether apparently widespread subterranean species have evolved once and
expanded their range by dispersal (with vicariance if there
are no longer connections between extant populations) or
evolve independently by convergent evolution from widespread surface populations in different parts of their range
[26,27] The first case would lead to the display of convergent adaptations. This seems to be the case in the different
Astyanax fish populations, the best studied case of adaptation to the subterranean environment in vertebrates [27].

a monophyletic group and clades are geographically but
not habitat-structured, suggesting that there is (or has
been) gene flow between the two habitats [6]. In the cavedwelling landhopper P. hypogaea, Stock and Martin [22]
claimed that the distribution of the species in lava tubes
and caves all over La Palma and especially in tubes formed
by recent lava flows (as recent as 300 years old as in Cueva
del Ratón), would suggest that this talitrid can colonize
new subterranean habitats quickly. Thus, a single colonization event followed by dispersal via the hypogean crevicular system could explain the observed pattern of
habitats of these crustaceans.
We have used mitochondrial (mt) DNA and nuclear
sequence data to establish a phylogenetic framework for
testing hypotheses on the origin of P. hypogaea and to
study the phylogeography of cave and surface populations
of the genus Palmorchestia on the island of La Palma. In
particular, we tested whether all populations of P.
hypogaea could have derived from a common ancestral
population that adapted to life in the volcanic tubes and
dispersed through the volcanic subsoil, or whether there
were multiple independent invasions of the caves from
partially isolated, genetically differentiated populations of
an ancestor presumably similar to the extant forest species
P. epigaea.

Results
A total of 89 Palmorchestia individuals were sequenced (53
P. hypogaea and 36 P. epigaea) for the subunits cox1 and
cox2 of the cytochrome oxidase mtDNA region resulting
in an alignment of 761 bp. The examined individuals of
the two species showed many distinct haplotypes (43 for
P. hypogaea and 25 for P. epigaea; accession numbers
[EMBL: AM749302–AM749391]); see Table 1 and Table
S1 in Additional file 1. Haplotypes were endemic to their
respective cave or surface localities in the two species, with
the exception of one haplotype of P. epigaea that was
shared by the two nearby localities, Cubo de la Galga and
Barranco de la Galga, at the north-east of the island (Figure 1). Therefore, no shared haplotypes between subterranean and surface species were evident in our samples.
mtDNA haplotype diversity, measured by either species or
locality, was high although sample sizes were low in some
cases (Table 1). Only Barranco de la Galga and Andén
Verde (P. epigaea) and Cueva de la Buraca (P. hypogaea)
showed a fixed mtDNA genotype (the latter in the only
two available individuals examined), but all other surface
localities or lava tubes in which Palmorchestia was sampled rendered multiple haplotypes with a remarkably
high rate of nucleotide variation.
Phylogenetic analyses
A sequence alignment was obtained for the Palmorchestia
haplotypes plus the sequences obtained of 26 individuals

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/7

from five related Orchestia species collected (see Table 1).
One hundred and seventy-nine nucleotide positions were
of the cox1 gene, up to 55 of an intergenic spacer, and 492
of cox2. The minimum in-group mean corrected distance
among species (using the selected 'General Time Reversible with proportion of Invariant sites and a Gamma shape
parameter' model, GTR + I + G) was 9.4% between P. epigaea and P. hypogaea and a maximum of 78% between O.
gomeri and P. hypogaea. The sequence of the related landhopper Talitroides alluaudi was used as an out-group. Histone H3 sequences obtained from 20 individuals [EMBL:
AM748646–AM748665] showed no variation within Palmorchestia or within the other Orchestia species sequenced
while a 4.7% mean distance was obtained in comparisons
between in-group species. mtDNA Bayesian inference and
parsimony trees showed the same overall topology, which
agreed with the among-species relationships deduced
from nuclear histone H3 sequences (see Figures 2 and 3
for the mitochondrial Bayesian trees and Figure S1 in
Additional file 1: for the combined tree). Each Orchestia
species formed highly supported monophyletic mtDNA
lineages, although relationships between species were
weakly supported in most cases when using only mtDNA
(Figure 2). A monophyletic clade composed of all Palmorchestia sequences appears as a sister group to Orchestia
sp. from Gran Canaria (supported with a 0.90 posterior
probability using mtDNA but 1.00 in the combined
mtDNA + nuclear analysis). Interestingly, the sequences
of P. hypogaea and P. epigaea did not form reciprocally
monophyletic clades when using mtDNA (Figure 3), yet
all examined individuals of these species showed identical
histone H3 sequences. The clade formed by sequences of
a P. epigaea population (JA) is sister to the P. hypogaea
Palmeros de Aguatavara cave (AG) clade (0.99 posterior
probability) and two P. hypogaea cave populations (GA
and BU) cluster with the mtDNA haplotypes of the
remaining four P. epigaea surface populations of the same
geographical region (1.00 posterior probability; see Figure
3). All but two surface localities (CG and BG) showed support for monophyletic mtDNA clades (posterior probabilities over 0.95). This suggests that the Palmorchestia
populations are highly structured geographically and have
diverged genetically. Moreover, there is evidence that current gene flow among surface populations is limited to
geographically close populations. Parsimonious reconstructions of habitat type based on the mtDNA analysis
showed a minimum of five transitions to the subterranean
habitat from epigean ancestors (Figure 3), assuming that
reversal to the surface of hypogean lineages is absent or
very unlikely. Alternatively, if transition between the two
habitats was considered, four hypo-epigean shifts in the
phylogeny could be deduced (not shown), but for this scenario to hold a subterranean lineage that became extinct
or has not yet been found must be invoked.

Divergence rates and molecular clock
Based on a relaxed molecular clock Bayesian analysis and
an a priori calibration for the node of Palmorchestia using
La Palma subaerial age, the mean substitution rate was
estimated to be in the range of 4.34–4.83% per lineage per
million years using a Yule and coalescent size models as
priors, respectively (Table 2). This results in an average
substitution rate of 4.6 × 10-8 per site per year for the
cox1–cox2 fragment used with 95% highest posterior densities (HPDs) in the range 2.9–7.2 × 10-8. Similar diver-

gence time estimates for the major cladogenetic events
were obtained irrespective of the model used except for
the tree root node that was estimated to be significantly
more recent using the Yule process than when coalescent
models were applied (Table 2). The constant population
size coalescent model had the best likelihood value (see
Table 2). Within Palmorchestia, the most recent common
ancestor for the subterranean lineage AG and the surface
population JA was estimated at 940,000 years with 95%
HPD values of 460,000–1,430,000 years assuming a con-

was attributable to differences among populations within

no significant association between genetic variation and
habitat, but a strong association of haplotypes with island
geographic realms irrespective of their surface or troglobitic life style.

than phylogenetic bifurcating trees [28]. Analysis of the
Palmorchestia data set with the program TCS showed 12 as
the maximum number of substitutions before homoplasy
was likely to occur under the 95% probability criterion.
This produced eight separated sub-networks above this
limit, corresponding to the main clades of the tree of Figure 3. A cave locality (Cueva de los Palmeros, PA) has two
disjoint sub-networks (Figure 3), suggesting that two distant mtDNA lineages occur within the same cave system.
The rest of the cave localities and the epigean Juan Adalid
(JA) north-west sampling site showed specific separate

networks and thus highly distinct mtDNA lineages. Only
one sub-network (corresponding to the north-east clade)
included mtDNA haplotypes united below the limit of
parsimony from individuals coming from six localities:
four from surface populations of the north-north-east part
of the island and the caves Cueva Honda de Gallegos and
Cueva de la Buraca (GA and BU, respectively), located in
the same geographical area (see Figure 1). As mentioned
above, the general pattern is consistent with considerable
geographic structuring of both P. epigaea and P. hypogaea
populations and indicates a strong allopatric fragmentation. Nested clade phylogenetic analysis (NCPA) could
only be applied to the northern sub-network, correspond-

clade. This haplotype is also fixed in the BG population,
and is present in the neighbouring CG locality. Nesting
resulted in 12 one-step clades containing sampled haplotypes that were further nested into higher-order groups
until the total cladogram was obtained. The higher-order
groups included surface haplotypes from FR and AV plus
the only haplotype of the BU cave (clade 4.1) and haplotypes from surface CG, BG and cave GA sampling sites
(clade 4.2). The nested contingency analysis of geographic
associations and the interpretations of the statistically significant clades lead to a 'contiguous range expansion'
within clade 4.1 and a 'past gradual range expansion followed by fragmentation' within clade 4.2 (Table 4),
assuming that haplotype CG10 (and the higher-order
clades embracing it) is ancestral to any other haplotype in
the north-east sub-network.
Habitat associations
Habitat association of mtDNA haplotypes (surface and
cave-dwelling) was confirmed by permutation chisquared tests for clades 4.1 (χ2 = 14.00;P = 0.0115) and
4.2 (χ2 = 20.91;P = 0.0002). In addition, there was no significant association of cave and surface haplotypes with
the position (either terminal or interior) of those in the
network (P = 0.28). These data suggest that there is no evidence supporting a recent colonization of the subterranean habitat by forest populations or vice versa on the
north shield of the island.

Discussion
The phylogenetic and population analyses clearly show
that on La Palma there is strong phylogeographic structuring for Palmorchestia populations and that subterranean
populations have multiple independent origins from surface ancestors. Divergent mitochondrial lineages are
restricted to precise cave systems or surface ravines and
regions. Analysis for all but two populations sharing the
same mtDNA haplotype supported monophyletic clades
and a DNA sequence variation that denoted an absence of
current gene flow between populations; the exceptions
were the BG and CG north-east surface closely placed
localities. AMOVA confirmed this and showed that when
grouping Palmorchestia populations by habitat type, the
genetic variation between groups proved very low. However, variation was maximized when considering localities
(caves and surface ravines) as distinct populations, except

for the north-east cave and surface sampling sites that contain a single population. This, added to the lack of reciprocal monophyly of P. epigaea and P. hypogaea mtDNA
sequences, suggests that any division of the two species by
habitat and ecology is unnatural.
Nuclear histone H3 gene and mitochondrial sequences
showed the close relationship of Palmorchestia species
with the Orchestia sp. of Gran Canaria. The two Palmorchestia species currently considered are clearly paraphyletic and genetically quite distant from the other
Canary endemic landhoppers of the genus Orchestia.
Within the Palmorchestia lineage three mitochondrial
clades were obtained. The relationship of these mtDNA
lineages with geography and geological history requires
an understanding of the volcanic evolution of the island.
The geological development of La Palma has been studied
in detail [25]. Two defined edifices can be distinguished
[29]; the northern shield began to emerge over the sea at
about 1.7–2.0 MYA and has undergone several volcanic
cycles and terrain collapses that ended about 0.2 MYA.
The southern ridge of the island is the product of much
more recent and intense volcanic activity, beginning 0.12
MYA and lasting until the present. Thus, the southern half
of La Palma, presumably including the shallow subsoil, is
dominated by recent lava flows, some of them of in historic times. Only one of the three major mtDNA lineages
within Palmorchestia is exclusive of hypogean populations, including a central and relatively more ancient lava
tube (AR) and two southern younger caves (RA and MA).
The other two lineages include surface and cave populations, one lineage from the north (AV, FR, GA) and the
other from the north-east localities (CG, BG and BU) on
the older northern shield, but surprisingly showing lower
genetic divergences than the other lineages. The third
mtDNA lineage includes south-west (PA), north-west (JA)
and west (AG) populations. This shows that intraspecific
genetic variation is clearly not directly linked to subterranean or surface habitats and that its geographic distribution cannot be explained only by the geological history of
the island. In a phylogeographic study of the La Palma
weevil Brachyderes rugatus, initial predictions based on the
geological history of the island also proved to be too simple to explain the phylogeographic history of the species
[29].

Divergence time estimations gave a faster molecular rate
than other calculations made for stygobiont crustaceans
using cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (i.e. 1.25 × 10-8 substitutions per lineage per position per year [30]). Faster
rates have nevertheless been suggested for subterranean
Australian amphipods [7]. However, mutation rates could
be slower in subterranean organisms owing to longer generation times [31]. Cave-dwelling organisms have lower
metabolic, growth, fecundity and fertility rates and thus
longer generation times than their surface relatives
[31,32]. Stygobiont amphipods and isopods need 8–10
years to reach sexual maturity, whereas their surface relatives only required 1–2 years [32,33]. Accordingly, 8 years
was assumed as the generation time for Australian stygobiont amphipods of the genus Pilbarus and Chydaekata [7].
Similarly, in decapod crustaceans, generation times of 2
and 10 years for surface and subterranean closely related
species, respectively, have been used [3], based on data
published elsewhere [34,35]. In addition, it has been
debated whether there is a relationship between the rate
of molecular evolution and sampling time [36-38]. However, several factors other than intrinsic problems with lineage rate variation and branch length estimation can
produce overestimations of the molecular rate when dating nodes based on island ages [38]. These include uncertainty of K-Ar dating caused by the burial of earlier lava
flows resulting in underestimation of island age, population genetic variation within the ancestral island population and lineage extinction [38]. We have obtained a
reasonably good sampling of La Palma populations but
there is a long branch in the phylogenetic tree joining the
MRCA node of the sampled Palmorchestia populations
and the sister species occurring in Gran Canaria, making it
feasible that extinction could be a factor that has inflated
our rate estimate. Nevertheless, mean time estimates for
epi-hypogean transitions (or the contrary if we assume
habitat reversion as a possibility) for two supported nodes
in the Bayesian mitochondrial tree that relate surface and
subterranean populations ranged from 0.36 to 0.94 MYA
in the northern and western lineages, respectively. This
suggests that independent episodes of colonization of the
underground from surface pre-diverged lineages have
probably occurred repeatedly in La Palma at different
times during the Pleistocene and are probably related to
documented drought episodes in the Canaries [23].
According to Stock's hypothesis [21], one can speculate
on the role played by the relative drought of the island in
the local extinction of surface Palmorchestia populations,
except in permanently humid zones such as the scattered
ravines radiating down the volcano (in particular, on the
northern slopes exposed to north-east trade winds). In
relation to this, two general competing hypotheses have
been proposed to explain the transition from surface to
subterranean life: the 'climatic relict hypothesis' (CRH)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/7

[24] and the 'adaptive shift hypothesis' (ASH) [39-41]. In
the CRH, species pre-adapted to the cave environment
(i.e. living in leaf litter or under stones) invade the hypogean habitat, with the epigean populations becoming
extinct because of subsequent climatic change. In contrast,
the ASH assumes active colonization of caves and parapatric speciation accompanied by adaptive differentiation
and reduced gene flow between the epigean and hypogean populations. Support for both hypotheses has been
obtained using mitochondrial phylogenies and molecular
clock approaches (i.e. [9,42]), although the lack of likely
surface ancestral lineages and robust phylogenies makes it
difficult to test them in particular cases [4]. The pattern
obtained in Palmorchestia suggests a recurrent entrance
into the cave systems by already highly structured surface
populations with subsequent independent adaptation to
the hypogean environment and eventual interruption of
gene flow between the two habitats. Local extinction of
surface populations as the climate became drier [23] and
multiple invasions of the underground make the pattern
more consistent with the CRH than with a parapatric speciation via adaptive shift. The apparent contradiction
between the age of the surface lava flows and some of the
mtDNA lineages deduced by molecular clock approaches
would support this. No surface populations have been
found in the southern ridge of La Palma, but caves in this
area are home to Palmorchestia ancestral haplotypes that
could have derived from recent subterranean dispersion
from north-central island populations. Indeed, some of
the surface lava flows above these caves are recent but
sampling shows ancient mtDNA haplotypes with estimated coalescent times of about 100,000 years, whereas
another cave (Cueva de la Machacadora) harbours divergent lineages. If the lava tubes in these young island
regions were coetaneous to surface lava flows, landhopper
populations in these systems should be considered as
recent newcomers and, at least in some cases, the product
of independent colonizations. However, the sampling
scheme has probably not covered all of the existing populations, including only a partial representation of the
underground biodiversity, as access to this habitat is limited to the known entrances to the lava tubes accessible to
humans (usually produced by roof collapse). In contrast,
cavehoppers can easily disperse through cracks and crevices of the lava flows (the mesocaverns [31]), quickly colonizing the new cave systems underneath older terrains,
either epigean or hypogean. This renders a scenario in
which episodic colonizations involved dispersal from the
surface to the underground, followed by recurrent range
expansion and colonization through the subsoil, whereas
on the surface isolation was caused by distance and fragmentation because of the patchy nature of the suitable
habitat.

Eight independent networks were obtained using statistical parsimony (Figure 3). Five of these were site-specific
and separated by many mutational steps, implying long
periods of independent evolution. The north-east Palmorchestia mitochondrial lineage, which includes several
surface populations and two lava tube populations, provides an opportunity to infer recent evolutionary events
and relationships between lineages from the two habitats.
This clade has an estimated age of 360,000 years using our
relaxed molecular clock calibration (Figure 3 and Table
2), being the only clade that includes all mtDNA haplotypes from different populations into a single network
under the limits of parsimony. Application of NCPA to
this network showed an inference of contiguous range
expansion from the northern surface (AV + FC) to northeast cave (BU) populations and previous gradual range
expansion followed by fragmentation for the clade including populations BG + CG and the distant cave GA (Figure
4 and Table 4). Complex interactions either among populations within one habitat or among populations of the
two habitats plus incomplete sampling and low sample
size for some localities could partially explain why the significant associations found are few and dependent on the
clade level (and thus the relative age of particular clades).
In a similar study of the facultative cave-dwelling crayfish
Cambarus tenebrosus, restricted gene flow and contiguous
range expansion were the more frequent inferences,
explaining the considerably and unusually large distribution of this species [6]. This kind of pattern could occur
frequently in populations of facultative subterranean
organisms that have remained isolated for a sufficient
time, but are lost or not evident in populations with long
histories of isolation, as occurs in many of the Palmorchestia populations. Tests of association of haplotypes with
habitat type or positioning in interior or terminal nodes
in the network show that haplotypes are habitat-specific,
but Palmorchestia has been present in both caves and surface habitats for a long evolutionary time. This can be
deduced from the fact that ancient clades often occur in
caves and in the network within the northern clade by the
lack of statistical support for an association of surface haplotypes with interior nodes and of subterranean haplotypes with terminal nodes.
An added complication posed by cave fauna is the absence
of morphological differentiation among divergent genetic
lineages, resulting in the presence of cryptic species. This
is in part caused by a high level of convergent evolution
linked to the adaptation to darkness and has been shown
recently for stygobiont amphipods [4,7,8]. In Palmorchestia, the independent evolution of populations for a considerable evolutionary time and fast molecular evolution
are apparently uncoupled with morphological divergence.
These results indicate that a re-evaluation of the taxonomic status of the current species of Palmorchestia is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/7

needed, with a revision of the presumed diagnostic morphological characters that differentiate P. epigaea and P.
hypogaea and a search for characters that could identify
individuals from different surface geographical regions
and/or cave systems. If, as genetic data suggest, multiple
entries to the subsoil have occurred in Palmorchestia, convergent morphological adaptation by eye degeneration
and body depigmentation could have arisen independently by different mutations, as has been shown to occur
in Astyanax fasciatus [27].

Conclusion
The phylogenetic and population analyses of Palmorchestia from La Palma show the need for a rigorous revision of
the taxonomic status of the genus, its evolutionary relationship with other Talitridae, and the morphological
characters in which the two currently considered species
differ. The island populations show an ancient independent evolution and there is evidence for multiple invasions
of the volcanic cave systems that have historically acted as
refuges. The data obtained supplement recent genetic
studies on subterranean amphipod fauna [4,7,8], with the
potential of using these new systems to test classical
hypotheses of modes of evolution for hypogean organisms. These include causes of the uncoupling of morphological and genetic evolution and the role of climatic
change, hydrology and regressive evolution as processes
shaping and determining subterranean biodiversity.

Methods
Sampling
Individuals of P. epigaea and P. hypogaea were collected in
La Palma (Canary Islands) in 2005 and 2006. The troglobitic individuals (P. hypogaea) were collected in six lava
tubes by direct active searches, or with pitfall traps using
liver bait containing propylene glycol (Table 1). Individuals collected by active search were transferred immediately
to absolute ethanol or RNAlater vials (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). Traps were revisited after several weeks or
months and individuals transferred to ethanol. The epigean species was formerly known to occur in a single
locality (Cubo de La Galga), but after intensive searching
four additional populations were discovered and
included in this study (Table 1). Thus, epigean individuals
(P. epigaea) were collected in five localities (two of them,
Cubo de la Galga and Barranco de la Galga, are close to
each other representing ravines separated by a crest) after
searching under rocks or in litter in the dark humid forest
between 500 and 1000 m above sea level. Sampling sites
are shown in Figure 1. Details of the localities, numbers of
individuals and numbers of haplotypes found appear in
Table 1. The sampling regime was designed to cover different areas of the island (Figure 1), including most of the
known distribution range of the species. The aim was to
sample at least 10 specimens per locality, but this was pos-

sible only for two caves and one surface locality (or two if
we consider a single population to constitute the samples
from two close areas; Table 1). The related Canary landhoppers O. guancha (endemic to Tenerife), O. gomeri
(endemic to La Gomera) and an undetermined Orchestia
species from Gran Canaria were also sampled. Other sublittoral species of wider geographic distribution (O. gammarellus, O. stephenseni and the cosmopolitan T. alluaudi)
were also considered for phylogenetic analyses (Table 1).
DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification
and sequencing
DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNAeasy Tissue kit
(Qiagen); in most cases voucher specimens were preserved for morphological analysis. A mitochondrial fragment of about 800 bp including the 3' end of the cox1
sequence, the 5' of cox2 and the intergenic spacer between
the two (as the tRNALeu nucleotide sequence (UUR)
seems to be absent in the region in these species [43]) was
amplified using primers SUBIF 5'AAGAGGCATACCTCGA
CGATACTC3' and COII-CROZ 5'CCACAAATTTCTGAAC
ATTGACC3' primers [43,44]. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) conditions were as follows: 4 min at 95°C followed
by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at
50°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 2 min, with a
final single extra extension step at 72°C for 10 min. A fragment of the nuclear histone H3 gene (using the primers
forward 5'ATGGCTCGTACCAAGCAGACVGC3' and
reverse 5'ATATCCTTRGGCATRATRGTGAC3' [45]) was
also amplified successfully in several individuals of Palmorchestia from different cave and surface localities and in
the out-group taxa. PCR conditions were the same as that
for the mitochondrial fragment. PCR products were
checked by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and products of the expected lengths were purified using the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The forward and
reverse strands were cycle-sequenced using an ABI Prism
DYE Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit
sequenced in an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were aligned with ClustalX [46]; length differences in the alignments comparing different species were
found to be caused by indels in the intergenic spacer.
Bayesian inference analysis was performed with MrBayes
3.1.1 [47] using the substitution model(s) obtained by
ModelTest v. 3.7 [48]. The analysis for the entire combined dataset was conducted with particular optimal
models fitted for each of the mitochondrial (GTR + I + G)
and histone H3 (HKY + G) partitions. The parameters corresponding to the selected model were treated as
unknown variables with equal a priori probability and
estimated as part of the analysis based on Bayesian inference. Searches were performed using two runs of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/7

2,000,000 generations from four Markov independent
chains started from random seeds sampling every 500
generations. At the end of each run we considered the
sampling of the posterior distribution to be adequate if
the average standard deviation of split frequencies was
less than 0.01. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs
were summarized and further assessed for convergence of
all parameters, using the program Tracer v.1.3 [49]. Trees
prior to log likelihood stabilization (burn in) and convergence were discarded before producing a majority rule
consensus tree. Parsimonious reconstructions of habitat
type in the mtDNA topology were performed using MacClade v. 3.03 [50] assuming reversibility or irreversibility
of character states, thus constraining or not constraining
subterranean clades to reverse to an epigean habitat.
Molecular rate and divergence times
We used a likelihood ratio test to determine whether a
molecular clock in the whole mtDNA sequence data set
would be compatible with the hypothesis of a global
clock. The null hypothesis was rejected at P = 0.01. Thus,
a full Bayesian analysis was performed to estimate evolutionary rates and coalescent times of Palmorchestia lineages, as implemented by the program Beast v. 1.4.6 [51].
The molecular clock assumption was relaxed using uncorrelated rates, with the rate in each branch independently
drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean of
0.01 and a variance parameter of 0.5. For the analyses two
coalescent population models were tested (constant size
and exponential growth) plus the Yule tree prior. Final
rate estimates from the three alternatives were compared
and that showing the best likelihood score was chosen. A
normally distributed calibration prior was set for the age
of the Palmorchestia clade based on the La Palma subaerial
formation with a mean of 2,000,000 years [25] and standard deviation of 200,000, thus assuming uncertainty associated with the calibration point. The mtDNA alignment
was analysed using the best-fit substitution model
obtained with ModelTest (GTR + I + G), 5,000,000
MCMC, sampled every 500 steps, following a discarded
burn-in of 500,000 steps. For the parameters substitution
model, we placed uniform priors of 0 and 100 except for
the proportion of invariant sites in which uniform priors
of 0 and 1 were assumed. Convergence of the chains to the
stationary distribution was assessed by visual inspection
of plotted posterior estimates using the program Tracer v.
1.3 [49] and the effective sample size for each parameter
sampled from the MCMC analysis was almost always
found to exceed 100.
Population analyses
AMOVA using Arlequin v. 2000 [52] was performed on
the Palmorchestia mtDNA data set to partition molecular
variance into different hierarchical levels. A matrix of pairwise Euclidean squared distances between haplotypes and

Page 12 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2008, 6:7

files containing the frequency of those haplotypes within
each population were used for this purpose. We tested for
differences between sampling sites nested within regional
groups and differences between groups. The significance
of the variance components was evaluated by a non-parametric permutation test [53] using 10,000 permutations.
Populations were grouped by habitat (subterranean versus epigean) or by sampling localities: the latter irrespective of species. The grouping that maximized the
geographical subdivision was assumed as the most plausible within those supported by significant variation among
regions (ΦCT).
TCS v. 1.13 [54] was used to infer the parsimony network
of haplotypes, linked by the smallest number of mutational steps with a 95% confidence criterion [55]. NCPA
[56] could not be performed in most cases because the
haplotypes contained in the networks were largely allopatric and disjunctive networks were far beyond the limit
of parsimony at the 95% level. Haplotype nesting into
hierarchical clades and NCPA was only performed in a
sub-network including haplotypes of individuals from
two subterranean and four surface localities. As suggested
in [6], habitat association of mtDNA haplotypes (surface
or subterranean) and significant relationships of subterranean or surface haplotypes with their peripheral or interior placements in this sub-network were tested by
permutation chi-squared tests performed with GeoDis v.
2.4 [57]. Such analysis can reveal whether the surface populations invaded the subterranean environment recently
and whether the surface haplotypes are more frequently
interior and subterranean forms appear as tip and recent.
Moreover, it can show whether surface populations are
recent derivatives of cave ancestors. Finally, an ancient settlement (at the time scale examined) of both subterranean
and surface populations was favoured if no significant
association was found [6].
