Rapid ecological isolation and intermediate
genetic divergence in lacustrine cyclic
parthenogens

Abstract
Background: Ecological shifts can promote rapid divergence and speciation. However, the role of ecological
speciation in animals that reproduce predominantly asexually with periodic sex and strong dispersal, such as lacustrine
cladocerans, is poorly understood. These life history traits may slow or prevent ecological lineage formation among
populations. Proponents of the postglacial ecological isolation hypothesis for Daphnia suggest that some species have
formed postglacially in adjacent, but ecologically different habitats. We tested this hypothesis with ecological,
morphological, and multilocus coalescence analyses in the putative lacustrine sister species, Daphnia parvula and
Daphnia retrocurva.
Results: Daphnia parvula and D. retrocurva showed strong habitat separation with rare co-occurrence. Lakes inhabited
by D. parvula were smaller in size and contained lower densities of invertebrate predators compared to lakes
containing D. retrocurva. In the laboratory, D. retrocurva was less vulnerable to invertebrate predation, whereas D.
parvula was less vulnerable to vertebrate predation and was smaller and more transparent than D. retrocurva. The
species are significantly differentiated at mitochondrial and nuclear loci and form an intermediate genetic divergence
pattern between panmixia and reciprocal monophyly. Coalescence and population genetic modelling indicate a Late
or Post Glacial time of divergence with a demographic expansion.
Conclusions: Despite their young age and mixed breeding system, D. parvula and D. retrocurva exhibit significant
ecological and genetic divergence that is coincident with the formation of deep temperate glacial lakes. We propose
that predation may have facilitated the rapid divergence between D. parvula and D. retrocurva and that intermediate
divergence of aquatic cyclic parthenogens is likely more common than previously thought.
Background
Divergent selection for different habitats has long been
proposed as a contributing factor to the evolution of species [1-4]. Regardless of geographic associations, ecological speciation from strong single selective agents, such as
predation, or from the additive effects of multiple selective agents (i.e., the niche dimensionality hypothesis) now
have empirical support [5-10]. A remaining theoretical
gap is a detailed understanding of the role of the breeding
system in speciation [11-14]. Although many eukaryotic
taxa reproduce both sexually and asexually [13], there are
still few empirical studies of speciation beyond strictly

sexual taxa [14-17]. Because many organisms with mixed
breeding systems are excellent dispersers [18-21], breeding systems with even a small amount of sexual reproduction should suffer homogenization of ecologically
differentiated lineages [11,12,15,22]. Thus, taxa with
mixed breeding systems coupled with high dispersal
should possess a weak capacity for rapid ecological radiation compared to strict asexuals and sexuals [11,23-26].
Others, however, have proposed that priority effects
where early colonization offers an advantage and divergent selection are frequently strong enough to overcome
the homogenizing effects of such mixed breeding systems
[22-27].
Cladocerans contain several candidate groups for
detailed empirical study of ecological and genetic divergence in a system characterized by both sexual and asex-

ual reproduction (cyclic parthenogenesis). These
microcrustaceans often inhabit insular freshwater systems (i.e. lakes, ponds, reservoirs) with a mosaic of selective regimes through many environmental factors such as
ephemerality, temperature, nutrient availability, competition, and predation [28-30]. For example, a common contrast occurs between lakes with visual vertebrate
predators that can select for smaller prey species, and
lakes dominated by gape-limited invertebrate predators
that favor cladoceran communities dominated by large or
helmeted species [31-36], as prey vulnerability is a function of prey size relative to predator size. Predation has
been proposed to drive evolutionary divergence in morphology and behaviour [32,37-41] and speciation in cladocerans [23,25,26,41-43]. Still, there is little knowledge
of ecological speciation among sister species of lacustrine
cladocerans, where sexual reproduction is relatively infrequent.
The cladocerans, Daphnia parvula Fordyce, 1901 and
Daphnia retrocurva Forbes, 1882 (Fig. 1), provide an
opportunity to study the role of ecological factors in promoting rapid divergence in potentially young lacustrine
taxa with a mixed breeding system. Although there is
variation in the frequency of sex among populations,
both species typically reproduce predominantly by clonal
asexual reproduction with a few periodic episodes of sex
throughout the season [42,44-47]. In North America, D.
retrocurva has a more northerly distribution occurring
from the central midwest through northern Canada,
whereas D. parvula occurs from South America through
the southern parts of Canada. However, the species overlap largely near the southern extent of the glacial lake
zone in North America where rare co-occurrence is documented (Fig. 2), [42,48-50]. Brooks [42] proposed that

more northerly D. retrocurva is a postglacial derivative of
D. parvula based on their distribution and D. retrocurva
inhabiting more novel post-glacial large lake habitats.
The two species have a sister group relationship, but no
multi-population genetic studies or detailed studies of
genetic divergence have been carried out [51-54].
Daphnia parvula lacks the anterior retrocurved helmet
(Fig. 1) that appears to be controlled by polyploid cells in
the head region of D. retrocurva [55]. The helmet undergoes cyclomorphosis in D. retrocurva [32,56-60], which
can be enhanced by cues from invertebrate predators
[32,58-60] and laboratory studies also show decreased
vulnerabilities of D. retrocurva to invertebrate predation
with increased helmet size [61]. Importantly, multigenerational lab culture experiments failed to convert the head
shape of D. retrocurva into the non-helmeted head shape
of D. parvula [56,62,63]. Although the body size and tail
spine length in D. parvula can be influenced by predator
cues, attempts to induce helmet production have also
been unsuccessful [59], suggesting the morphological differences between these two species likely has a genetic
component. Additionally, although D. retrocurva is a
classic example of seasonal polymorphism, experiments
reveal that phenotypic plasticity also fails to explain the
morphological differences between the two species
[62,63].
Although there are no studies that specifically address
ecological differentiation between D. retrocurva and D.

parvula, there is substantial evidence that the interaction
of predation with helmet phenotypes is evolutionarily
and ecologically relevant. Kerfoot and Weider [63] for
example, show that the abundance of D. retrocurva and
larger size classes of helmets in D. retrocurva, are positively associated with the increased abundance and size
of the invertebrate cladoceran predator, Leptodora, and
reduced levels of planktivorous fish over time. Likewise,
following the introduction of Leptodora in a lake, a shift
from D. parvula (without the helmet) was observed to
helmeted or large Daphnia [35], suggesting a role for predation as a selective agent for helmets. In contrast, a sixteen-year study [64] found repeated smooth, continuous
transitions between large bodied Daphnia and small
Daphnia (including D. parvula) associated with planktivorous fish density. Additionally, the abundance of D. retrocurva in glacial lakes is positively correlated with the
abundance of invertebrate predators, and the abundance
of introduced D. parvula is negatively associated with
rates of invertebrate predation during a season [47].
Taken together, the translocation and natural experiments are consistent with divergent selection from predation playing an isolating role, which could also affect
genetic differentiation. However, Lukaszewski et al. [65]
found evidence that ecological conditions beyond predation can prevent the successful colonization of D. retrocurva into a lake containing D. parvula.
Isolation affects population genetic patterns in a time
dependent fashion. Omland et al. [66] defined "intermediate divergence" as the stages between panmixis and
reciprocal monophyly. The lineage divergence continuum, as visualized by networks, begins with gene frequencies diverging with only older internal haplotypes
shared (less frequent haplotypes arising since isolation
are private), followed by a lack of haplotype sharing.
Eventually, population-specific clades (monophyly or
paraphyly) are formed. In post-glacial isolation, which
has been proposed by Brooks for D. parvula and D. retrocurva [42], such intermediate divergence is often produced and haplotype sharing is limited to the older
central haplotypes of the networks [67-69]. In contrast, if
isolation is caused by multiple glacial refugia during the
late Pleistocene, patterns of multiple geographic subclades along with multiple demographic expansions is
predicted as observed in other Daphnia [67,68].
Here, we specifically test for ecological and genetic
divergence between D. parvula and D. retrocurva. Ecological speciation predicts that populations of D. parvula
and D. retrocurva whose ranges overlap will be associated
with ecologically different habitats. If predation is a major
selective agent, then we should detect differences in the
relative vulnerabilities to habitat-specific predators. If the
morphotypes of "retrocurva" and "parvula" are isolated,
then we expect to detect significant genetic differentia-

tion in the zone of overlap. Further, under the postglacial
isolation hypothesis, we expect intermediate divergence
(lack of monophyly), a lack of multiple demographic
expansions, and divergence times from coalescence modelling to be Late or Post-Glacial. We test these objectives
through data culled from pre-existing databases, laboratory predation experiments, and population genetic analyses.

Results
Habitat differentiation

Of the 64 lakes analyzed from the data collected from the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of lakes in the
Northeastern United States, 47 contained D. parvula, 16
contained D. retrocurva, and one contained both species.
The Discriminant Analysis (DA) indicated that abiotic
variables significantly discriminated between lakes containing D. parvula and lakes containing D. retrocurva
(Table 1), with lake area, lake depth, and lake volume contributing most to this group separation. The Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) for lake volume was significant (F 1, 62
= 7.36, P = 0.0079), with D. retrocurva inhabiting lakes of
larger volume than those of D. parvula (400.35 Ã 105 m3 Â±

Laboratory predation experiments

For the invertebrate predation experiment, there were
significant effects of treatment (control or predator), prey
species (D. parvula or D. retrocurva), and the interaction
on proportion of prey missing (Table 3). There was no
difference between the proportion of prey missing of the
two species in the controls; however, in the predator
treatments D. parvula suffered significantly higher mortality by Leptodora kindti than did D. retrocurva (Fig. 4a).
The predation rate of L. kindti on D. parvula was also
higher (0.0381 Â± 0.01) than on D. retrocurva (0.01252 Â±
0.002), (mean Â± SE).
In the vertebrate predation experiment, there were significant effects of treatment (control vs. predator) and
treatment by species interaction for the proportion on

Of the 97 lakes analyzed from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in Wisconsin, there were 16 lakes
with only D. parvula, 79 lakes with only D. retrocurva,
and two lakes with both species. In both co-occurrence
lakes, one species dominated while the other was rare or
only present in a single sampling period throughout the
year.
The DA indicated that invertebrate predators significantly discriminated between lakes inhabited by D. parvula and those inhabited by D. retrocurva (Table 2). The
abundance of two copepod predators, Acanothocyclops
vernalis and Epischura sp. contributed most to this group
separation (Table 2). Daphnia retrocurva inhabits lakes
with significantly greater abundances of both these invertebrate predators relative to habitats where D. parvula
resides (Fig. 3).

retrocurva suffered higher mortality by emerald shiners
in the predator treatments than did D. parvula (Fig. 4b).
The predation rate of the fish on D. retrocurva was also
higher (1.085 Â± 0.0296) than that on D. parvula (0.638 Â±

For all prey populations used in both predator experiments, the ANOVA's indicated body length, from top of

Daphnia parvula was significantly smaller than D. retrocurva and this difference is accentuated when including

length (F2, 97 = 3.08 P = 0.0508), indicating that despite
much variation across populations, D. parvula was consistently smaller than D. retrocurva. In addition, D. parvula was relatively more transparent than D. retrocurva
(Fig. 5b), which was still the case when only non-parthenogenic or non-gravid females were analyzed (F1,48 = 9.37,

The divergence time (t) was estimated to be at 20,600
years ago when the migration prior was set to zero
migrants/generation, and 31,000 years ago with a migration prior set at 10 migrants/generation (Fig. 8). When
treating the data as a single group, the mismatch distribution was not significantly different from what is expected
under a single expansion (P = 0.74). The Ï parameter estimating the date initiating the expansion [70] was 4.765
(95th percentile confidence interval 1.57-11.53; Fig. 9)
and the demographic expansion within this group was
estimated at 11,405 years ago (95th percentile confidence
interval range of 4,000 - 26,000 years ago). The mismatch
distributions within D. parvula and D. retrocurva were
not significantly different from the expected distributions
under the expansion model (P = 0.78, P = 0.1972, respectively; Fig. 9). The Ï parameter estimating the date initiating the expansion was 5.15 (95th percentile confidence
interval 1.78 - 12.91) for D. parvula and 5.84 (95th percentile confidence interval 2.12 - 4.51) for D. retrocurva.
Demographic expansion was estimated at 12,331 years
ago (95th percentile confidence interval range of 3,00031,000 years ago) for D. parvula and 13,969 years ago
(95th percentile interval range of 5,000 - 35,000) for D.
retrocurva.
The results of the Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA) of both the individual markers and all four
markers combined indicate a relatively small proportion
of the total genetic variation is found between the two
species. In addition, the fixation indices demonstrate very
high differentiation among populations within a species
and within populations (Table 5).

Our findings illustrate rare co-occurrence of D. parvula
and D. retrocurva in the field with strong spatial segregation in ecologically differentiated lakes supporting eco-

described by Brooks [42] remains mysterious. We failed
to detect parvula-like specimens in multiple samples
from the same embayment of Lake Ontario examined by
Brooks. The rare parvula-like morphs in glacial lakes
could be the result of recent inflow from shallow adjacent
waters or transient ex-ephippial clones of parvula.
What are the ecological traits associated with isolation?
Kerfoot and Weider [63] have elegantly shown that evolution of the helmet size (defensive structures that are the
main morphological difference between D. retrocurva
and D. parvula) can be attributed to historical changes in
invertebrate predation. Here we show that this process
may also contribute to the spatial segregation of these
two species in nature, as D. retrocurva inhabit larger lakes
that contain higher abundances of invertebrate predators
relative to lakes where D. parvula is found. Although the
data collected did not permit us to examine if fish, or vertebrate predators discriminated between the habitats
encountered by these two species, the abundance of D.
parvula has been found to be positively associated with
the abundance of planktivorous fish [64]. We also were
unable to make a direct association between the abiotic
and biotic factors compared in this study since these data
were obtained from different sources, yet deeper aquatic
habitats can have higher abundances of invertebrate
predators of Daphnia because depth affords a refuge
from visual predators for conspicuous invertebrate predators [74]. Unexpectedly, the lake data failed to reveal an
association between the abundance of Leptodora and
Daphnia species. One possible explanation for the lack of
association is the difficulty in quantifying abundances of
vertically migrating Leptodora in daylight hauls [75-77],
yet the abundances of D. retrocurva and Leptodora have

been found to be positively associated in other studies
[48].
We also found that D. parvula has an advantage relative
to D. retrocurva in the presence of visual, vertebrate predation which may be a consequence of the smaller body
size and greater transparency of D. parvula (Fig. 5). Additionally, D. retrocurva has an advantage over D. parvula
in the lab to the invertebrate predator tested. Thus, the
present study and existing translocation and longitudinal
evidence suggest that D. parvula and D. retrocurva have a
selective advantage to different habitat-associated predators. It is possible that predation may promote "immigrant inviability" between these two species, or selection
against migrants between locally adapted populations,
which is a direct result of natural selection reducing gene
flow [78,79]. The differing predation regimes likely contribute to the spatial segregation of these sister species,
but additional local processes may to contribute as well in

this system [65]. Our study found that abiotic chemical
variables (i.e. nutrients, conductivity) did not discriminate between the two species' habitats, yet other processes that were not included in this study could also
contribute to their habitat segregation such as competition, the interactive effects of multiple predators, priority
effects, and dispersal [80-83]. Further studies are needed
to evaluate the role these other factors may play in facilitating habitat isolation between D. parvula and D. retrocurva, yet evidence suggests that predation is a key factor
in determining zooplankton community composition and
can reduce the importance of other factors influencing
the establishment of Daphnia populations [81,84].
Our results support postglacial genetic divergence
between D. parvula and D. retrocurva despite a mixed
breeding system and high dispersal. The networks, single
demographic expansion patterns, and divergence estimates based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are con-

sistent with intermediate divergence and postglacial
isolation. This postglacial timing of divergence is consistent with the origins of the deep temperate glacial lakes
[85,86] that constitute the main habitat of D. retrocurva.
We note that the findings of intermediate divergence do
not rule out actual or potential gene flow between D. retrocurva and D. parvula. The AMOVA reveals a relatively
low proportion of the total genetic variation is found
between the two species and genetic divergence associated with ecological processes is often characterized by
intermediate divergence with ongoing gene flow [87].
Although Daphnia are known to have high dispersal
and colonization rates [21], the fixation indices suggest
strong genetic differentiation among intraspecific populations (Table 5), suggesting natural selection may also be
operating within species as well. Therefore, selection
against migrants may lead to a reduction in gene flow in
this system on two scales, between two species and the
two larger classes of habitat types they reside in, and
within a species and the individual local habitat each population resides in. According to island population models,
as long as the island population size increases more rapidly than the number of migrants, the per-generation
genetic contribution of migrants should decrease and an
equilibrium is reached [72] which is likely in Daphnia.
Their cyclic parthenogenic reproduction, rapid population growth, and priority effects supported by a large
resting bank coupled with local adaptations may allow
residents to maintain large populations relative to incoming migrants. Many studies illustrate strong, local adaptations in Daphnia populations and the reduced success of
invaders [21,72,81], this high genetic differentiation
among intraspecific Daphnia populations often leads to a
monopolization effect [67,72,88,89] in which predation,
competition, reproduction, ontogeny, and tolerance to
eutrophication have been implicated to promote [72,8890].
Conflicting models have been proposed whereby mixed
breeding systems either slow [12] or accelerate divergence [18,23,26]. In our study, despite their young age, D.
retrocurva and D. parvula illustrate ecological divergence
with respect to their habitats, morphology, and predator
vulnerabilities suggesting possible selective advantages to
each in their respective environments. Both species typically have a mixed breeding system with relatively infrequent sex [42,44,45,47] and illustrate strong dispersal
capabilities [47,64,73]. Although some believe that populations with mixed breeding systems are less likely to
yield discrete or distinct groups relative to populations
with strictly sexual or asexual reproduction [12], this
study illustrates two groups that have diverged into two
distinct lineages and maintained this divergence with a
mixed breeding system coupled with high dispersal, and
more importantly over a relatively short period of time.

Page 8 of 14

Lynch and Gabriel [89] propose that a single generation
of sex can reveal 50-75% of the genetic variance hidden by
asexual reproduction. Therefore, reproduction marked
by cyclic parthenogenesis could allow such rapid divergence through the combined benefits of rapid population
growth rates that asexual reproduction offers along with
the release of genetic variation in the few episodes of sexual reproduction [91]. We postulate this mixed breeding
system permits such rapid postglacial divergence of D.
parvula and D. retrocurva, with selection against
migrants (immigrant inviability) maintaining this divergence by reducing the homogenizing effects of dispersal.

Conclusions
We present evidence for rapid ecological, morphological,
and genetic divergence of sister species of lacustrine
cyclic parthenogens. The species differ in geneticallybased defensive structures and predation regimes. Predation has been implicated as a selective force promoting
divergence among taxa in only a few animal lineages. The
present study suggests a role for predation in facilitating
habitat isolation in young sister species with a mixed
breeding system. However, multifarious selection can
bring about reproductive isolation more effectively than
selection from a single factor, and the habitats of D. retrocurva and D. parvula differ in numerous ways that could
affect selection. Although predation has been implicated
as a key factor in determining community composition
and establishment of Daphnia [81,84], other factors need
to be further evaluated. Our results do indicate that a better understanding of the evolution of the numerous presumed
intraspecific
defensive-morphotypes
of
cladocerans is needed. Intermediate divergence of
aquatic cyclic parthenogens is likely more common than
previously thought.
Methods
Habitat differentiation

We obtained occurrence data from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Environmental
Monitoring and Association Proposal (EMAP), http://
www.epa.gov/emap/. These data were collected from 64
lakes and ponds in the northeastern United States in the
months of July through September from 1991 to 1994.
From this study, data were extracted on the presence or
absence of D. parvula or D. retrocurva within each habitat, along with physical and chemical measurements of:
ionic strength (M), pH, total nitrogen (Î¼g/L), total phosphorus (Î¼g/L), trichomatic chlorophyll A (Î¼g/L), total
suspended solids (Î¼g/L), secchi depth (m), calculated
alkalinity (meq/L), turbidity (NTU), average depth of lake
(m), lake volume (m3), lake surface area (ha), and % of
watershed in human disturbed land. The methods used to
measure each variable are described at http://

Costanzo and Taylor BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:166
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/166

www.epa.gov/emap/. We coded the presence/absence
data in each site for both D. parvula and D. retrocurva.
There was one lake in the EPA abiotic dataset that
included both species, and in this lake D. parvula was
rare. Data from this co-occurrence lake were removed
from the analysis (see below) due to the small sample size.
Separate data collected by the Wisconsin Department
of Natural Resources (DNR) [92] from 1973-1974 from 99
lakes throughout Wisconsin were used to test for differences in invertebrate predator assemblages across the
species' habitats. We were unable to assess differences
between vertebrate predator assemblages (fish) due to
incomplete or missing data. Each lake was sampled four
times that year (between the months of April through
November) where zooplankton and invertebrate predator
abundances were recorded. These data include ranked
abundances of the following invertebrate predators: the
copepods Acanthocyclops vernalis, Epischura sp., and
Mesocyclops edax; the larval dipterans Chaoborus flavicans, C. punctipennis, and Chaoborus sp.; and the cladoceran Leptodora kindti. The abundance data were ranked
according to the absolute abundances found in the field
as follows: 0 = absent, 1 = rare (3 or less), 2 = uncommon
(4-50), 3 = common (51-1,000), and 4 = abundant (>
1000). We coded the presence/absence of D. parvula and
D. retrocurva. Since the timing of the four periods sampled varied across lakes, the mean values for each lake
were used in the analyses. This dataset had two lakes
where the species co-occurred (never during the same
time period), which were removed from the analysis (see
below) due to the small sample size.
Because abiotic and biotic variables are often correlated
[28], the datasets were analyzed with a Discriminant
Analysis (DA) in SPSS (ver. 11.5, 2006). Two separate
DA's were run, one including the abiotic data (EPA) and
the other including the biotic data (DNR). Some data
were transformed to meet the assumption of normality.
We tested whether the variables in a data set (abiotic or
biotic) yielded significant discrimination between lakes
inhabited by D. parvula versus D. retrocurva and the correlation of these variables with the discriminant function
was used to determine the relative contribution of each
variable to the group separation. In the abiotic DA we
retrieved three variables that significantly discriminated
between lakes inhabited by D. parvula or D. retrocurva
(lake volume, area, and depth). Since all three variables
were mutually correlated, we ran an Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA) on lake volume since it had the highest correlation with the discriminant function, with species as the
fixed effect. For the invertebrate predators, an ANOVA
was used to test for differences between individual predator means indicated by the DA that best discriminate
between habitats with D. parvula or D. retrocurva.

Laboratory predation experiments

We tested whether D. parvula and D. retrocurva differ in
their vulnerabilities to habitat-specific predators and if
they exhibit morphological traits that are known to affect
vulnerabilities towards the respective predators. One
experiment used an invertebrate predator (Leptodora
kindti) while the other a vertebrate predator (emerald
shiners, Notropis atherinoides). In addition, morphological measurements were taken of relative body size and
transparency for populations used in the predation
experiments.
During late summer (August and September) we collected D. parvula from Buffalo, NY (43Â° 01' 39.37'' N, 79Â°
48' 72.39'' W) and D. retrocurva from embayments of
western Lake Ontario (43Â° 11' 22.04'' N, 77Â° 31' 75.09'' W
from Irondequoit Bay, NY in August and 43Â° 17' 59.83'' N,
79Â° 48' 16.81'' W from Burlington, Ontario in September).
Daphnia was reared for two weeks prior to the experiment at constant densities in 50-ml vials filled with synthetic lake water (96 mg NaHCO3, 60 mg CaSO4 2H2O,
60 mg MgSO4 and 4 mg KCL in 1 L of double distilled
water; EPA 2002) with 10 Daphnia per vial at 21Â°C with a
24 h light photoperiod. All vials were treated with cetyl
alcohol (CH3 (CH2)15OH) to prevent the Daphnia from
getting caught in the surface tension. Every three days,
1000 Î¼l of Selenastrum capricornutum suspensions were
added to each vial of Daphnia as a food source.
Leptodora kindti was field-collected from Lake Ontario
(43Â° 11' 22.04'' N, 77Â° 31' 75.09'' W), one week prior to the
experiment. Leptodora were individually maintained in
50 ml vials filled with synthetic freshwater at 21Â°C with 24
h light photoperiod. Every three days L. kindti was given
zooplankton collected from the field as a food source.
Emerald shiners (from 50 to 64 mm long in standard
length) were obtained from a bait shop and were previously field-collected from the Niagara River, Buffalo, NY.
Although the source of these predators were from the
Niagara River, emerald shiners are often the dominant
planktivorous fish in lakes with Daphnia representing
one of their main food sources [93,94]. Prior to the experiment, the fish were kept in 10 L tanks with treated tap
water at room temperature (21Â°C) and fed a mix of freshwater fish food (Tetrafin) and zooplankton collected from
the field. Both invertebrate and vertebrate predators were
starved for 24 hours prior to the experiments.
For the invertebrate predator experiment, all experimental trials took place in 90 ml plastic cups with 50 ml
of synthetic fresh water treated with cetyl alcohol 24
hours prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, 20 adult female D. parvula (Buffalo population collected in August) or D. retrocurva (Irondequoit Bay
population) were added to a cup, which was then randomly assigned 1 or 0 adult L. kindti (predator and con-

Costanzo and Taylor BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:166

trol, respectively). There were 20 replicates of each prey
treatment within the predator treatment and 4 replicates
of each prey treatment within the control treatment.
After 24 hours (21Â°C, 24 h light photoperiod) the predator was removed and surviving prey were counted.
For the vertebrate predator experiment, all experimental trials took place in 3.8 L plastic containers with 3 L of
synthetic lake water at room temperature (21Â°C). On the
day of the experiment, 50 adult females of either D. parvula (Buffalo population collected in September) or D.
retrocurva (Burlington population) were added to a container that was randomly assigned 1 or 0 fish (predator
and control, respectively). There were 3-4 replicates of
the predator treatments and 2 replicates of the control
treatments for both prey species on each of 3 days (total:
predator 10 replicates, 6 control replicates, for each prey
species). The number of replicates in the vertebrate predator experiment was limited by the number of available
Daphnia and each replicate used a novel predator. After
one hour the predators were removed and the surviving
prey were counted.
Prey mortality was equated with the proportion of prey
missing. The proportion of prey missing was arcsine
square root transformed and analyzed by factorial
ANOVA with predator, prey, and the interaction as fixed
effects. Post hoc tests with Tukey correction were performed to detect any pairwise differences among mean
proportion prey missing between species.
The predation rate coefficient K was calculated in the
predator treatments only. We calculated the predation
rate coefficient K derived from the Lotka and Volterra
equation
dP / dt = âKXP ,

where P is the number of prey per liter and X is the
number of predators per liter. The coefficient K was then
calculated by the equation
K=

â ln(PT / PI )
XT ,

where PI is the initial concentration of prey per experimental unit, PT is the concentration of prey per experimental unit at the end of the trial, X is the number of
predators per experimental unit, and T is the duration (in
hours) of the trial [95]. Although this equation does not
take into consideration reproduction or intrinsic mortality of both prey and predation, in our experiments no
reproduction was observed and prey mortality was quantified by the number of prey missing rather than number
of dead prey. Although we observed a small proportion of
prey missing in the controls treatments, this random

Page 10 of 14

effect was likely constant among both control and predator treatment as the higher proportion of prey missing
was consistent in the predator treatment replicates.
Following the experiments, morphological measurements were taken on 25 adult females of D. parvula and
D. retrocurva for each predation experiment (50 total for
each species) that were randomly sampled from the laboratory source populations that provided the Daphnia for
each predation experiment (individuals from the populations not used in the experiments). From populations
from both predation experiments, we measured the body
length (from the top of the compound eye to the base of
the carapace), and the total body length (from the highest
point of the helmet or head to the tip of the tail spine).
Measurements were taken with a dissecting microscope
and ImageJ (ver. 1.37, 2006). Since D. parvula cannot produce a helmet, these two measurements were used to
quantify the body size of D. parvula relative to that of D.
retrocurva, with and without the cyclomorphic features
exhibited (helmets and tail spines). We ran separate
nested ANOVA's to test for differences in body length
and total body length with species as the fixed effect (D.
parvula or D. retrocurva), and source population nested
within species (locality and time collected for either for
the invertebrate or vertebrate predation experiment) as a
random effect. Both variables were log transformed to
meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of
variances, although raw means are illustrated in the figures.
From populations of D. parvula and D. retrocurva used
for the vertebrate predation experiment, we additionally
quantified the relative transparency using a dissecting
microscope and the "Histogram" analysis of ImageJ. Each
individual Daphnia was photographed in grey scale
under identical magnification and conditions, using only
transmitted light. The relative transparency was quantified from the mean pixel intensity (0 to 255 for pixel
shades from black to white) for the specimen image. Following confirmation that the photo conditions were standardized across both species, an ANOVA was run to test
for differences in transparency between D. parvula and
D. retrocurva. An identical analysis was also run on transparency only among non-gravid females from both species, as the presence of parthenogenic eggs can affect
detection of prey by vertebrate predators [96]. All dependent variables were log transformed to meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances, yet raw
means are illustrated in the figures.
Genetic analyses

Specimens of D. parvula and D. retrocurva were collected
from populations (n = 29) throughout the continental
United States and Canada (see Additional file 1, Table
S1). Most populations were from areas in Northern

Costanzo and Taylor BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:166
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/166

United States and southern Canada where the two species' distributions overlap (Fig. 2, Additional file 1: Table
S1). We obtained from 1-10 individuals per population
(average 5.44 individuals/population).
Total genomic DNA was extracted using Quick Extract
(Epicentre). Samples were homogenized in 35-45 Î¼l of
Quick Extract solution, then incubated at 65Â°C for 2 h
and 98Â°C for 10 minutes, and stored at -20Â°C. One mitochondrial and three nuclear markers were sequenced
from the extracted DNA. A 631 bp fragment of mitochondrial protein-coding NADH-2 (ND2) was amplified
with the primers (5' - GTTCATGCCCCATTTATAGGTTA - 3') and (5'- GAAGGTTTTTAGTTTAGTTAACTTAAAATTCT-3').
The
primers
(5'TTACGAGTCCAGATGGGCTT-3') and (5'- ATCCGTTATGAATCCCTGACTGA-3') were used to amplify a
669 bp fragment of protein-coding HSP90 gene. A 433 bp
fragment of the nuclear rab GTPase (F6F12) gene was
amplified with the primers (5'- CGTTTCGAATTGGCTTACTGA-3') and (5'- CATCGTTATCTGTCTACGTCTTGAA-3'), while a 534 bp fragment of the translation
initiation factor (G6G12) gene was amplified with the
primers (5'- AGAAATTCAACATGCCCAAGA-3') and
(5'- CGTCGACGAAGTTGACAGTAT-3') [97]. Each
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was 50-54 Î¼l in total
and consisted of 4-8 Î¼l of extracted DNA, 5 Î¼l of10 Ã PCR
buffer [50 mM KCl, 1.5 mg MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH
8.3, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin], 1.5 Î¼l of DNTP's (2 mM of each),
1 Î¼l of 10 Î¼M of each primer and 1 Î¼l of standard Taq
DNA polymerase. Each PCR was conducted on a MJ
Thermocycler with the following conditions for the mitochondrial (ND2) gene: 40 cycles at 94Â°C for 30 s, 48Â°C for
30 s, and 72Â°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72Â°C for
7 min. The PCR temperature profiles for the nuclear
(HSP90) gene were 40 cycles at 94Â°C for 30 s, 50Â°C for 30 s
and 72Â°C for 1 min. with a final extension at 72Â°C for 5
min. For the nuclear (F6F12) gene the PCR temperature
profile was 40 cycles at 94Â°C for 30 s, 58Â°C for 30 s and
72Â°C for 1 min. with a final extension at 72Â°C for 5 min,
identical temperature profiles were used for the nuclear
(G6G12) gene with the exception of the annealing temperature set at 53Â°C rather than 58Â°C. Sequences of all
nuclear and mitochondrial PCR products were obtained
in both directions by Genaissance Pharmaceuticals or the
University of Washington and were both assembled and
edited with SEQUENCHER ver. 4.2 (Gene Code) then
manually aligned in SE-AL 2.0 [98].
An individual was considered heterozygous when overlapping peaks (lower peak > 95% of higher peak) were
observed at any given site on the sequence electropherogram. Individuals with multiple heterozygous sites were
cloned with the Invitrogen TOPO TA kit to determine
the different alleles at each site with observed heterozygosity. The QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN) was

Page 11 of 14

used for plasmid purification and the respective primers
for each particular locus were used to sequence the
cloned inserts. For each individual, six cloned fragments
were sequenced to help detect cloning artifacts [99]. The
combined data for all four makers was a 2268 bp
sequence with both alleles represented for each individual for the nuclear genes. All individuals sequenced for
the F6F12 and G6G12 markers were also represented
with sequences for the HSP90 and ND2 markers. DNA
quality appeared to prohibit sequencing of all genes for all
individuals. Therefore, we conducted analyses for 1) individuals represented by sequences for only the mitochondrial ND2 gene, 2) individuals represented by sequences
with only the three nuclear genes, and 3) individuals represented by sequences for all four genes (total evidence).
The number of individuals sequenced from each
marker used in the analyses can be seen in Additional file
1: Table S1. Each individual was represented by two copies of each sequence to account for both alleles at a
heterozygote site in the nuclear markers, while the mitochondrial (ND2) gene was replicated twice to correspond
with the two copies of each nuclear gene sequence for the
analyses. We performed a phylogenetic analysis on the
total evidence data set (all four genes combined) using
Maximum Likelihood (ML) method with RAxML [100]
and a file to partition the alignment by codon position
and gene. For all analyses a GTR substitution model was
implemented for the analysis and unique model parameters were optimized and applied for each partition. Support values were estimated using 100 bootstrap
replicates.
Because the transition from polyphyly to monophyly is
continuous, a categorical description of divergence can
fail to identify significant divergence before monophyly is
reached [101]. Thus, detecting divergence in closely
related or recently diverged species phylogenetically can
be difficult if monophyly has not been reached. The
recently described Genealogical Sorting Index (gsi) allows
one to detect significant genealogical divergence before
monophyly by quantifying the relative degree of exclusive
ancestry of a labelled group on a rooted tree topology.
Since branch tips along a tree generally represent gene
copies of a given locus, the value of gsi is the degree of
genealogical exclusivity among the sampled gene copies.
The calculated gsi value ranges from 0-1, with 0 representing panmixia and 1 representing monophyly and permutation tests provide a statistical test of significance for
this value [101].
We calculated the gsi value for each species (D. parvula
and D. retrocurva) and tested the null hypothesis that the
gene copies labelled D. retrocurva and D. parvula form a
single intermixed group. Because strongly unbalanced
group representation can result in a decreased power to
detect significant exclusive relationships [101] we deter-

Costanzo and Taylor BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:166
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/166

mined the gsi for the mitochondrial data, the nuclear
data, and the total evidence data after randomly removing D. retrocurva individuals from the data to achieve a
balanced sampling scheme, since this species was over
represented compared to D. parvula.
A median-joining haplotype network was constructed
for the mitochondrial data and the three combined
nuclear gene sequence data using NETWORK ver. 4.5.0.0
[102]. In order to further estimate divergence time we
used the isolation with migration- analytic (IMa) model,
which was designed to analyze recently separated populations (or in this case, species) not at equilibrium. This
model estimates six demographic parameters including
gene flow rates and time of divergence while generating
relative likelihoods/posterior probabilities [103]. Unfortunately we could not get reliable migration or gene flow
estimates in IMa likely due to the increased number of
parameters in the model (J. Hey communication); therefore, we used IMa solely for estimating divergence time.
Since the degree of current gene flow between D. parvula
and D. retrocurva is unknown we ran two IMa analyses,
one with the migration prior set to zero migrants per generation and another with ten migrants per generation
between the two species which we treated as populations.
For both analyses, we used the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano
model [104] and the Infinite Sites mutation model for the
mitochondrial and nuclear markers, respectively. The
mutation rates entered in the model were the number of
bp in the particular marker multiplied by 3.3 Ã 10-6 mutations/site/year for the mitochondrial marker and 1.05 Ã
10-7 mutations/site/year for the nuclear markers [105],
assuming 5 generations per year; previous estimates
adjusted to seasonal duration of localities [106,107]. The
analysis included 30 million generations post burn-in (1
million generations) with six Metropolis-coupled Markov
chains with the first heating parameter for the linear
heating scheme set to 0.05. Tajima's D test and the fourgamete test (DNASP ver. 4.0) indicate all markers are
consistent with the expectations of neutrality and the
nuclear markers show no evidence of recombination,
both assumptions of the IMa model.
Sequences from the rapidly evolving mitochondrial
ND2 gene were used to determine the demographic history of both D. parvula and D. retrocurva lineages. Three
mismatch distributions were calculated from the number
of differences between pairs of haplotypes within and
between species in ARLEQUIN [108]. The Sum of Square
Deviations (SSD) was computed for each species separately then tested whether the observed distributions
deviated significantly from those expected under the
population expansion model using 10000 permutation
replicates. We used the parameter Ï to estimate the time
since the expansion (t) using the equation t = Ï/2 u, where
u is the mutation rate per sequence per generation [109]

Page 12 of 14

assuming a mutation rate of 6.6 Ã 10-8/site/generation
[110] and five generations/year.
We ran hierarchical Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA) in ARLEQUIN [108] to determine the total
genetic variation explained by differences (i) between the
two species D. parvula and D. retrocurva, (FCT), (ii)
among populations within a species, (FSC), and (iii) within
a population (FIS).
