Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic methods are philosophically grounded, and so can be philosophically
biased in ways that limit explanatory power. This constitutes an important methodologic dimension
not often taken into account. Here we address this dimension in the context of concatenation
approaches to phylogeny.
Results: We discuss some of the limits of a methodology restricted to verificationism, the
philosophy on which gene concatenation practices generally rely. As an alternative, we describe a
software which identifies and focuses on impossible or refuted relationships, through a simple
analysis of bootstrap bipartitions, followed by multivariate statistical analyses. We show how
refuting phylogenetic relationships could in principle facilitate systematics. We also apply our
method to the study of two complex phylogenies: the phylogeny of the archaea and the phylogeny
of the core of genes shared by all life forms. While many groups are rejected, our results left open
a possible proximity of N. equitans and the Methanopyrales, of the Archaea and the Cyanobacteria,
and as well the possible grouping of the Methanobacteriales/Methanoccocales and
Thermosplasmatales, of the Spirochaetes and the Actinobacteria and of the Proteobacteria and
firmicutes.
Conclusion: It is sometimes easier (and preferable) to decide which species do not group
together than which ones do. When possible topologies are limited, identifying local relationships
that are rejected may be a useful alternative to classical concatenation approaches aiming to find a
globally resolved tree on the basis of weak phylogenetic markers.

Since the 1960's, molecular phylogeneticists have sought
to reconstruct organismal relationships based on gene
and protein trees [1]. Generally, successes in this enterprise have been evaluated as a function of the capacity to
build unambiguous monophyletic groups, thus reducing
the paraphyly of former classifications [2]. Despite such

Biology Direct 2006, 1:26

precise goals, tree reconstruction remains notoriously difficult, both for practical and conceptual reasons. Regarding some of the problems of classical phylogenetics, many
publications have presented what we feel to be valid arguments [3]. At a large scale, the most pervasive issue is
probably the occurrence of lateral gene transfers (LGT)
[4]. This paper will, however, focus on a different topic,
tackling instead a peculiar practical issue: the relative
weakness and the ambiguity of the phylogenetic signal in
a context of a tree-like pattern of evolution.
Dealing with phylogenetic information recorded in
molecular markers is indeed often a major challenge. Each
individual gene is of limited size, generally too short to
fully resolve a given phylogenetic question [5]. In addition, the phylogenetic signal is generally eroded by mutational saturation and suffers from other sources of
homoplasy such as convergence or parallelism that led to
unevenly resolved trees. This unequal support is reflected
by the bootstrap values (BVs) associated with the different
nodes of the gene tree. BVs are the most common way to
assess the robustness of clades. They are produced by a
random resampling of positions with replacement to
determine sampling error or the confidence interval for
the groups as displayed in the hypothesized best tree [6].
Low BVs reflect that the marker employed contained too
few synapomorphies to be conclusive. High BVs indicate
that the data consistently support a given grouping. However to conclude that a highly supported grouping identifies a true set of descendants from a common ancestor
requires that the BV statistics are not artefactually biased.
Such artifactual biases often arise, since very fast-evolving
species of an alignment will systematically tend to group
together, independently of their real phylogenetic relationships [3]. If present, this long branch attraction problem is generally aggravated as the sequences under study
get longer [7]. Such artifically increased BVs are also
observed in self-concatenation (i.e. concatenation of a
single marker with itself). While no new independent data
are added, the simple repetition of the same characters
leads to questionnable higher supports (data not shown).
In spite of this, when phylogeneticists face problems of
weak resolution using a few markers, they traditionally try
to increase the support for the clades under study by providing more phylogenetic signal (i.e. increasing the
sequence length) [8]. That is, they study simultaneously
several genes or proteins in an attempt to raise the global
quantity of synapomorphies available to support each
monophyletic group, following a principle of total evidence. As one often reads in papers proposing concatenation analyses, total evidence rests on the assumption that
if multiple markers share a common history then their
overall analysis will produce a concatenation tree that is

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

better resolved, through summation of their individually
weak phylogenetic signals.
As debates around the works of the famous philosopher
R. Carnap have shown, total evidence methods have a
defined epistemological background: they belong to the
verificationist toolkit. In other words, aware of it or not,
classical phylogeny and its attempt to establish robust
clades by concatenation are a verificationist procedure.
Importantly, verificationism is not the only possible
approach to acquiring scientific knowledge, as decades of
epistemological studies have underlined. For instance, it
is well known that falsificationism directly opposes verificationism. Falsificationism supposes that "natural laws ...
can never do more than exclude certain possibilities"[9]. To
make the constrast more clear in a phylogenetic context:
instead of aiming to confirm clades via a progressive
increase in their bootstrap support when more data is
added, a falsificationist would more likely be interested
first by the rejection of impossible groupings, underlining
what can not be a natural group. These divergent goals
introduce some asymetry in our way of looking at phylogenetic results. We will argue that it can sometimes be easier (and preferable) to decide which species do not group
together than which ones do. Our reason to encourage the
development of an alternative perspective to verificationism is not a commitment to falsificationist sensu stricto.
Simply, it follows a third epistemological current: the one
of P. Feyerabend, who stated that: «proliferation of theories
is beneficial for science, while uniformity impairs its critical
power» [10].
In this case, we feel that more falsificationist perspectives
should be explored as a counterbalance to the current verificationist foundation of molecular phylogenetics. We
illustrate this by describing a very simple tool whose
objectives are to refute impossible phylogenetic relationships, highlighting disagreements and inconsistencies
about a priori possible clades, not exclusively their consistency. In this way, instead of reaching a weak conclusion –
we cannot know for sure if a given clade A exists – we can
make the strong claim that another group B is certainly
not an appropriate unit in any natural classification. Typically, our «falsificationist-lite»-software could be useful
for those who study a new genome and want to test rapidly and without taxonomic a priori assumptions, which
relationships are rejected by their multiples alignments,
that is, to which taxa the genome could never belong. Our
software also provides the details of the pattern of rejection for each gene, so that markers supporting atypical
impossible groupings can be easily identified, suggesting
specific instances of phylogenetic artefact, lateral gene
transfer or hidden paralogy for these markers. Finally,
through its identification of impossible associations, our
method delineates restricted sets of possible relationships

that could help traditional (verificationist) classifiers
explore a refined selection of realistic taxonomic connections.

Material and methods
Constitution of the datasets
The archaeal dataset is the one presented in [11]. In brief,
it comprises 23 aligned ribosomal markers: rpl2p, rpl15p,
rpl18p, rpl22p, rpl23p, rpl30p, rpl37ae, rpl3p, rpl44e,
rpl4p, rps10p, rps13, rps15p, rps17e, rps19e, rps19p,
rps2p, rps3p, rps4p, rps5p, rps6e, rps7p and rps8e. Each
marker presented 23 species: 4 crenarchaeotes (Pyrobaculum aerophilum, Aeropyrum pernix, Sulfolobus solfataricus,
Sulfolobus tokodaii), 3 Thermococcales (Pyrococcus furiosus,
Pyrococcus abyssi, Pyrococcus horikoshii), 3 Thermoplasmatales (Ferroplasma acidarmanus, Thermoplasma volcanium,
Thermoplasma acidophilum), 2 Halobacteriales (Halobacterium sp, Haloarcula marismortui), 4 Methanosarcinales
(Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanosarcina mazei, Methanosarcina acetivorans, Methanoccoides burtonii), 1 Methanobacteriales, (Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus), 2
Methanococcales (Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Methanococcus maripaludis) Archaeoglobus fulgidus, diverse methanogens (Methanogenium frigidum Methanopyrus kandleri)
and Nanoarchaeum equitans.

The sequences of 34 genes identified as core genes in [12]
were retrieved using the program "retrieve sequences" in
all analyses of the Neurogadgets website [38] (option
"Reciprocal best match in other genomes" using a GI
number). The 34 genes were: argS, infB, pheS, rplN, secY,
dnaG, ksgA, proS, rpsB, serS, dnaX, leuS, rplA, rpsC, thrS,
fusA, lysS, rplC, rpsD, trpS, gcp, metG, rplE, rpsG, valS, gltX,
nusA, rplF, rpsH, ychF, hisS, nusG, rplK, rpsM. For all these
markers, we produced a careful alignment and preliminary phylogenetic analyses (NJ) to check the sequence
orthology. We subsequently excluded from the files all the
instances of species harboring multiple copies of each
gene and obtained a set of 34 files with 135 shared species. Maximum Likelihood analyses, using Phyml [13],
were conducted on these data to ensure that the monophyly of the main groups under study was supported. As
it appeared that the homology of archaeal and bacterial
sequences in lysS was doubtful, and that pheS and proS
presented either hidden paralogy problems or more likely
ancient LGTs between the two prokaryotic domains, these
3 markers were removed for the rest of our study. We used
a selection of 43 common species representative of 8
major prokaryotic groups in the 31 remaining markers,
for further in-depth phylogenetic analyses to be presented
here and elsewhere. The groups tested here were: the
Archaea (Halobacterium sp., Pyrococcus abyssi, Archaeoglobus
fulgidus, Methanosarcina acetivorans, Thermoplasma volcanium, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, Aeropyrum pernix, Sulfolobus
solfataricus), the Spirochaetes (Borrelia burgdorferi,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

Treponema denticola, Treponema pallidum), the Chlamydiales (Parachlamydia sp., Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydia
trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila caviae), the actinobacteria (Propionibacterium acnes, Bifidobacterium longum, Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis,
Corynebacterium diphtheriae gravis), the Proteobacteria
(Campylobacter jejuni, Wolinella succinogenes, Desulfovibrio
vulgaris, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Xanthomonas axonopodis,
Nitrosomonas sp., Caulobacter crescentus, Mesorhizobium
loti), the Cyanobacteria (Gloeobacter violaceus, Synechocystis
sp., Prochlorococcus marinus, Thermosynechococcus elongatus,
Nostoc sp., Synechocystis sp.), the Aquificales/Thermotogales (Thermotoga maritima, Aquifex aeolicus) and the firmicutes (Clostridium acetobutylicum, Thermoanaerobacter
tengcongensis, Ureaplasma parvum, Mesoplasma florum,
Lactobacillus johnsonii, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus
aureus).
Impossible analyses
Bootstrap calculations were calculated using PHYML [13]
(settings, 4 categories, Γ law, JTT model of evolution) and
CONSENSE [14] for each of the 31 markers. These bipartitions were inputed to our new software: Impossible,
which accepts as input any bipartition files produced by
CONSENSE [14], containing identical or overlapping set
of species. Missing taxa are not a problem, as an option
allows us to filter the outputs to focus on the common
species, if desired. Typically, these infiles, one per marker,
contain the list of the species investigated and the list of
bipartitions with their BVs. Bipartitions appear as a string
of "*" and ".", which splits the species investigated into
two disjoint subsets. Species sharing a "*" or species sharing a "." are more closely related than species with a different symbol. In classical phylogeny, each bipartition,
thus defining a split, allows us to draw a dichotomy on a
tree, and the bootstrap support indicates the robustness of
this relationship. Impossible examines all of the bipartitions that have support above a user-defined cutoff to
determine two different types of impossible relationships:
the basic impossibility and the combined impossibility
(see Additional file 1).

Basic impossibilities occur between the two subsets of a
single bipartition (i.e. AB|CDE or **...): grouping members of the left subset with members of the right subset is
impossible, and vice versa. By default, basic impossibilities are given a score of one. The higher the score between
two species or two groups of species, the more their association is rejected by the data. Combined impossibilities
are quite different from basic impossibilities as they
explore the hierarchical structure of the phylogenetic tree,
and involve more than one bipartition. Each combinedimpossibility consists of two subsets of species which
come from n different bipartitions and have disjoint taxonomical sampling. To identify them, for each marker, all

Biology Direct 2006, 1:26

pairs of bipartitions are examined to determine if a combined impossibility exists between them. For instance, for
the bipartitions ABC|DEF and AB|CDEF, there are four
pairs of cross-subsets: ABC-AB, ABC-CDEF, AB-DEF, and
CDEF-DEF. However, in our definition, only AB-DEF is a
combined-impossibility since all the other pairs, sharing
species between their subsets, are partly overlapping. Each
combined impossibility is given a score of one plus their
degree value. Conceptually, this degree value represents
the number of strongly supported nodes which occur on
the path between the two subsets of the cross impossibility and thus oppose to their direct grouping. To calculate
this degree value, we defined a 'related set' as any set that
includes one member of the combined-impossibility as a
subset. We then listed the related sets present in all the
bipartitions of a marker for each subset of the combinedimpossibility of interest. Our second step is to evaluate the
number of related sets that do not share any species in
common. Indeed, the list of related sets does not correspond exactly to the number of dichotomies between two
combined-impossible subsets of species as some of the
related sets partially overlap and encompass common
species. In order to detect and remove the overlaps
between 'related sets' (not to obtain artefactually high
degree values of impossibilities) and to define the number
of nodes separating two groups, we sort them by decreasing order of size, based on the number of species that they
encompass.
Briefly, 'related sets' with the most species are more likely
to be involved in an overlap. The related sets that are both
involved in the most numerous overlaps and higher in
our list are then removed. In case of ties, one of the related
sets involved in the largest number of overlaps is randomly selected for removal. The procedure is repeated
until no overlap is left. By default, the degree of this combined-impossibility is then evaluated as the number of
remaining related sets plus one (see Additional file 2).
Researchers are however able to change these weightings
in order to give cross impossibilities more or less emphasis. If the user specifies «linear» weighting, the weighting
becomes the number of related sets + 1 + a user-supplied
value, if he specifies «multiplicative» weighting, the
weighting becomes the number of related sets + 1 multiplied by a user-supplied value, if he specifies «exponential» weighting, the weighting becomes the number of
related sets + 2 exponential a user-supplied value.
Finally, these scores of impossibilities are used to compile
the tables and diagrams outputted by Impossible (see
Additional file 1). The tools propose 4 different summaries: (1) an impossibility diagram, (2) a group-group diagram, (3) a species-group diagram, and (4) a pairwise
impossibility diagram. Each of these diagrams, while
based on the same data, displays a different facet of the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

results. The first set of diagrams displays all of the impossibilities that the program has identified. This set contains
three different sections: (a) basic impossibilities, (b) combined impossibilities, and (c) a summation of basic and
cross impossibilities. On (1), the impossibilities are displayed as coloured squares sets on a grid. Each column
corresponds to a different markers, whereas each row corresponds to an individual impossible association of species, supported by one marker under investigation.
Therefore, a square in column X in the row corresponding
to impossibility w-y indicates that the association of w
with y is impossible for the marker X. One can thus assess
which markers present similar pattern of refutation and
which do not, and which relationships are strongly
rejected, or only rejected by a few markers. To ease this
identification further, the rows are ordered to locate the
impossibility that occurs in the largest number of markers
at the bottom of the diagram, while the rarest impossible
relationships is placed at the top of the diagram. In both
(1a) and (1b), basic impossibility squares are coloured in
white, and combined-impossibilities are indicated with
various shades of blue, with darker shades corresponding
to a higher overall degree value. The numerical values
indicating the strength of the rejection of a relationship
are also displayed in an array, for further statistics (outfile
.pharm). Finally, in the combined diagram (1c), an extrarow and an extra-column display the overall impossibility
score for that whole row or whole column. Markers proposing the most impossibilities (refuting genes), and
strongest impossibilities (refuted groups) receive the
highest overall score, and are easily identified.
The second diagram, which is known as the group-group
impossibility diagram, transforms the data included in
the first diagram in a bar graph. The length of each bar represents the total score for a particular impossible grouping. For instance, the entry AB would show the sum of the
values for all of the impossibilities that have AB as a subset. Diagram (2) thus allows a researcher to find which
groups of species tend to be the most unrelated to other
species, and thus would deserve further investigations to
be classified. This diagram presents another interesting
property: the groups with the highest impossibility scores
relative to other groups are also the most probable associations of species.
The third kind of diagram breaks down the information
found in the group-group diagram, as it provides the users
with the possibility to highlight the impossible relationships for a species of interest (i.e. their favorite bug or
newly sequenced organisms). Any selected species can be
given its own diagram of type (3)-the species-group diagram – that summarizes its non-relation with other
groups. The species-group diagram can be used to determine in which groups the selected species cannot be

Biology Direct 2006, 1:26

placed. Counter-instances in a given marker presenting
the grouping of the species with its usually refuted partners, would thus help to unravel interesting exceptions
and original gene histories (i.e. LGT).
The final diagram produced by Impossible is the pairwise
impossibility diagram (4). It shows impossibilities
between pairs of individual species. By only showing pair
relationships, this diagram avoids any possible group size
bias, which tend otherwise to award large groups high
impossibility scores. This is because large groups contain
more elements which can be involved in impossibility
relations. By using only single species, there is always only
a one-to-one relationship. This diagram is also converted
into numbers that can be used in statistical analyses to
identify species with similar/different patterns of refutations of relationships.
Finally, Impossible contains a rough feature to test the
inconsistency of a priori user-defined original groupings,
switch -g. Although a researcher can manually look
through the complete diagrams to determine which
groups are refuted and which ones are not, a more userfriendly method might be to input predefined groups of
interest into Impossible (i.e. the cabozoa) and have
Impossible return their information. As the user-defined
group to be tested will appear in the pairwise impossibility diagram under the appelation chosen by the user, an
entry showing the internal impossibilities between the
members of the predefined group will also be indicated in
the pairwise diagram. In order for a group to be considered potentially solid, a rough estimate is that the sum of
its external impossibilities (the number of associations
rejected by a group) must be greater than the sum of its
internal impossibilities. Otherwise, the members of the a
priori groups will reject their grouping more than they
reject their association to any other taxa.
For the archaeal dataset, we ran Impossible with the following command-line:

port were considered. For the prokaryotic core dataset, we
first ran Impossible with the following command-line:
Java Impossible F1 0.1 -a -o F3, respecting the same
nomenclature than above in the text. 0.1 means that
biparitions with a support higher than 1-0.1, which is
90%, were considered.
The principal component analyses were run using R and a
script presented in [15]. The coordinates of the species of
the principal component analyses were extracted and used
to test the normality of the data as well as the two-sample
T-test and the Wilcoxson rank-sum with NCSS Junior 6.0.
This program, which is a freely-distributed and can be
downloaded from the NCSS website [39], runs on any version of Windows. The data are inputted into the program
in the form of a tab-delimited table (although spacedelimited and comma-delimited tables are also acceptable). This table can be prepared using our script MakeGroup, with the command line MakeGroup group
pgroup, where group is a text file containing the group to
be tested, as described above for Impossible and pgroup is
simply the output of the Principal Component Analysis,
presented on two columns. Each column represents a list
of values to test different species grouping (i.e. the X axis
or Y axis coordinates on the principal component analysis). To run the analysis (options Run > Run Analysis), the
columns of data of interest have to be selected in the
Response variables section of the options Analysis > Ttests > Two-sample t test. The output from the program
will be displayed on the screen. In addition to the primary
statistical tests mentioned above, NCSS also runs several
other tests to determine the validity of the data such as
tests of the normality and variance equality. If the normality test fail for a certain pair of groups, as its variance tests
determine that the sample groups have unequal variances,
it is still possible to use the Aspin-Welch Unequal-Variance test instead of the two-sample T-test to assess if two
groups of species are statistically different or not. It was
not needed here.

Toward an attempt to facilitate classical molecular
systematics
Classical molecular systematics embraces a tree-like
model: its ultimate goal is the elaboration of a unique
inclusive hierarchy [16]. Whenever a new species is discovered and its genes or genomes sequenced, the affiliation of this species to known groups is the object of the
systematicist's speculations. To achieve this, significant
reorganizations of former classifications may be required
and some past hypotheses challenged. In such cases, multiple taxonomical levels have to be redefined or even
invented. Thus the state of classification becomes then
temporarily open. As with any new problem, one of the

Biology Direct 2006, 1:26

simplest positions is to assume that everything is possible,
that many groups might potentially host the new species.
T. Cavalier-Smith's writings about the «cabozoan hypothesis», (the claim that there is a common origin for euglenoid and chlorarachnean chloroplasts), illustrate this
logic of a priori maximal possibility well. As this author
underlined in a paper from 1999 [17], "a relationship
between euglenoid and chlorarachnean chloroplasts has not
been previously suspected apart from one brief mention of the
possibility [...] Though at first sight a strikingly different
arrangement, it does not actually preclude a direct phylogenetic
sister relationship between them, as postulated here". T. Cavalier-Smith used the absence of evidence as a starting point
for his revised systematics. For example, he argued that for
"cabozoan", "the phylogeny of both groups is imperfectly
known. [...] But this is no serious objection to the cabozoan theory", for discicristates, that "there is no particular reason to
think that archezoa/discicristates are sisters to all eukaryotes
except Reclinomonas. So I suggest that they may instead be sister only of the Cercozoa", for the phylogenetic proximity
between the sporozoan and the dinoflagellates plastids,
he recalled that "the published [tufA] trees do not rule out a
direct relationship instead with dinoflagellates, for which no
tufA sequences are yet available" [17]. Open exploration of
the taxonomically possible is definitely an important part
of the traditional classification task.
Yet, discussing the possibility of new groupings is only the
first step in such an analysis. Once a group and its subsequent sister-groups are proposed, these hypotheses must
be tested. In pursuing the cabozoan case, Cavalier-Smith
made it clear that "one way of testing the cabozoan theory is
to establish which of the clades postulated here are correct and
which are false". The test may not be easy, due to the weakness of phylogenetic markers [18], which is often the first
problem with testing taxonomic hypotheses. Along this
line of thought, Cavalier-Smith recognized that "our inability to infer the correct branching order of the seven taxa
[including sporozoan, dinoflagellates, euglenoids and
chlorarachnean] merely from rRNA trees cannot be seriously
questioned. Therefore such trees cannot be used to confirm or
refute my postulates of plant, chromist, and chromalveolate
monophyly" [17]. Better resolution (at least locally) is thus
often needed to refute some groupings. Yet obtaining better apparent resolution is not sufficient. Some visibly
robust results on phylogenetic trees should be interpreted
with caution due to potential artefacts that would unite
some unrelated species in an erroneously supported single group. Another of T. Cavalier-Smith's proposed clades,
the myosozoans, illustrated this issue and how the systematist should not take a phylogeny at face value without
a critical look. Some results may simply be «too nice» to
be considered true, i.e. "the extreme divergence of the dinoflagellate sequences might be expected to cause them to group

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

with the sporozoan sequences even if they were not directly
related" [17]. In this case, the comparison with other gene
phylogenies, especially those including species with
slower evolving genes [19], might help to pinpoint genespecific artefactual groupings. The contrast of multiple
independent gene phylogenies is thus another key in testing taxonomic hypotheses.
Consequently, these few examples stress the value in systematics of developing phylogenetic approaches aimed at
testing multiple relationships, possible and impossible
alike: accounting both for the limited as well as for the
conflictual resolutions between multiple gene trees.
Epistemological principles of our tests of phylogenetic
hypotheses
With this goal in mind, we developed phylogenetic analyses testing hypothetical groupings but trying to be less
verificationist and more falsificationist in spirit. To make
this last principle explicit, we will discuss in more detail
the interests and scopes of these two different epistemogical approaches.

The notion that cladism and total evidence are verificationist is indeed often argued in the literature [20]. For
instance, «introducing the concept of 'total evidence' in systematics, Kluge (1989) cited the relevant theoretical background,
namely the work on inductive inference and its relevance for
epistemology by the philosophers Rudolf Carnap and Carl
Hempel. Consulting the references provided by Kluge (1989) of
Carnap (1950) and Hempel (1965) shows that for these
authors, the principle of 'total evidence' was tied to inductive
inference» [21]. More precisely, «the empiricist philosopher
Rudolf Carnap used 'total evidence' as a tool of decision-making, where the decision is to accept or reject a certain theory/
hypothesis on inductive grounds. 'Total evidence' supports this
process of decision-making by determining, in part, the value of
a 'c-function,' which is the 'degree of confirmation'» [22]. «If
[evidence] e expresses the total knowledge of X at time t, that is
to say, his total knowledge of the results of his observations, then
X is justified at this time to believe [hypothesis] h to the degree
r [where r is the result of applying inductive logic to e and h],
and hence to bet on h with a betting quotient not higher than
r.]" [23]. Put in more concrete phylogenetic terms, total
evidence suggests to analysing as many data as possible to
decide how much support a given relationship has. In
concatenation analyses, this is achieved by joining all the
genes together in the largest alignment possible, thus
maximising the number of synapomorphies.
The logic of verificationism developed here has consequently one limit: such an «inductive support works symmetrically, confirming or disconfirming theories or hypotheses to a

inconsistent with A. So if x confirms hypothesis A, y confirms
hypothesis B, and if x carries a greater evidentiary weight than
y, then A is confirmed and B is symmetrically disconfirmed»
[24]. Total evidence is thus fundamentally a confirmatory
approach, going for the majority rule as the answer,
instead of carefully testing if some individual gene in the
concatenation rejects some groupings, and identifying
which ones. This is problematic as it makes the untested
assumption that there is a unique phylogenetic answer,
which relevantly summarizes the phylogenetic informations of the different markers. Inevitably, in a verificationist approach (for instance after the concatenation of
multiple markers) the most-parsimonious tree or the
most-likely one is always «well-"corroborated"» [20]. Yet,
as falsificationists would point out, it does not mean that
this concatenation tree has been proven to represent the
true evolutionary history for all the genes. Falsificationists
would claim that the «y» characters in favor of hypothesis
B have been unfairly dismissed.
This is a real problem, as more sequences would increase
the global bootstrap support even when conflicting in
phylogeny [15]. This may be true even when disagreements between markers remain, due to lateral gene transfer, hidden paralogy or artefacts [5]. So, when provided
with a long concatenation and a verificationist tree, «systematists typically talk about 'congruent' characters, but what
they really mean by that is the coherence of sets and subsets of
character statements relative to an inclusive hierarchy» [22];
the common tree whose existence was taken a priori for
granted. Importantly, such a «test of congruence under total
evidence [...] is shown to be related to the coherence theory of
truth in metaphysics and thus to coherentism in epistemology»
[22]. What this does mean is that such a method is not
employed independently of an ontological conception of
species, which is not necessarily explicitly stated and,
should it be, would not necessarily be approved by all the
community. As demonstrated by Ruse, "as soon as one
starts breaking organisms into parts, one must bring in theory
... Take two bears, one white and one brown. Do they differ in
one feature, or does one take each hair separately ... The point
is whether someone who explicitly eschews the theory has the
right to combine all the hairs into one feature" [22]. What the
systematists who work from a verificationist/coherentist
point of view classically do, is to force a unique model
upon all markers, as if they were not as many gene histories as there are genes: they assume that, like bear hairs,
genes can be combined in one feature.
Yet, if the hairs of a bear all quite likely share a same origin, in a context of lateral gene transfers (hidden paralogy
and artefacts), the a priori hypothesis that there is a common phylogenetic history for the genes might be very
risky to embrace, as the resulting truth might well be very
artefactual. After all, even random markers concatenated

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

together can strongly support a tree. On the one hand, "as
Farris himself pointed out: "... the decision [the choice amongst
competing hypotheses of relationships] is made by accepting the
stronger body of evidence over the weaker, and ad hoc hypotheses of homoplasy are required to the extent that evidence must
be dismissed in order to defend the conclusion"» [22]. On the
other hand, despite what it seems "congruence does not support a phylogenetic hypothesis, for the congruent characters
need not be homologous, they could also be homoplastic» [22].
Philosophically speaking, the least we can say is that the
greatest care should accompany the positive interpretation of any global well-corroborated topology. There is
indeed a high type I error to accept a wrong tree with this
approach.
Some systematists, such as Kluge, came progressively to
realize some of the weaknesses of verificationism, and
tried to shelter phylogeny under the apparently more protective aura of falsificationism. They reworded the logic of
the test of congruence and insisted on the fact that «in phylogenetic analysis, an hypothesis of relationships can be said to
be falsified if a perceived synapomorphy is inconsistent or in
conflict with the hypothesis», a claim that indeed sounds falsificationist [20]. However, there are numerous reasons
for which this semantic trick falls short, as discussed in
length and convincingly by Rieppel.
To clarify what was still not falsificationist in phylogeny,
let us summarise very briefly how strong falsificationism
functions. This popperian approach to scientific knowledge rests on what is called an "hypothetico-deductive"
logic, which requires that a testable prediction is deducible from a theory/hypothesis and its auxiliaries. The
famous example given by the philosopher is that of the
statement «all ravens are black", which can be logically transformed to «there is no one thing that is not black and is a
raven," and that statement in turn can be logically transformed
to «no white raven is here now". Hence, if one accepts the observation of a white raven here and now, then that negation of the
negated observation statement contradicts the universal proposition in logical space, and falsification occurs" [24]. Yet, there
is more to falsificationism, since it is also an «asymmetrical
all-or-nothing affair» [24]. The non-refuted, non-rejected
hypotheses remain in fact unproven. Even with a reformulation, classical phylogenetic approaches fail to acknowledge this assymetry as the same fact classically
symmetrically confirms a statement (if it exists), or disconfirms a statement (if it does not exist). The promotion
of a concatenated tree as the true tree is still, thus, opposed
to the "asymmetry of falsification." For a falsificationist, a
tree resulting from a concatenation is never proven.
Namely, "if a prediction deduced from theory is met by experience, it does not confirm the theory, it only corroborates it. If
the prediction is not met, or rather, if it is accepted that the prediction is not met, falsification of the theory occurs" [24]. As

expounded by Rieppel, 'it is evident that no such asymmetry
of falsification obtains in the 'test of congruence' based on total
evidence. Congruent characters (coherent character statements) confirm a hypothesis of relationships to the degree that
incongruent characters disconfirm it symmetrically. This is the
relationship expressed in the ensemble consistency index (or
tree length)» [22], or in a higher likelihood for the concatenation ML tree. Indeed, since most phylogenetic programs
work by identifying the most likely relationships between
species while eliminating the most unlikely, a best tree is
simply the one having a slightly higher acceptability than
the rest in the output given to the user, which usually contains a large number of very different trees. Yet, even if
such a tree is still unproven, some relationships, by definition not reported on this drawing, might well have been
rejected in the process of its reconstruction.

An Impossible analysis can then be followed by statistical
tests, which can help decide which groupings are likely
statistically rejected. We suggest using principal components analysis [25] on the data reflecting the degree of
impossibility for any pair of species to group together.
This multivariate analysis takes the data points, which correspond to all the pairwise impossibility relationships,
and transforms them onto a n-dimensional plan, where
the dispersal between species is maximised. That way, in
the principal component analysis, the higher the pairwise
impossibility score between two species, the further away
from each other they will be placed on the graph. Conversely, species for which groupings are possible will tend
to cluster more closely on the graph. Observing the spread
of species can thus, provide a first clue about which groupings are refuted.

One of our guiding principle was to look for these locally
rejected grouping and to try to promote a way to think
more assymetrically about phylogeny without taking the
verificationist shortcut, as the only answer of a phylogenetic analysis. Instead of letting our main concern be
about the 'best supported' hypothesis of relationships, we
decided to focus on the most falsified hypotheses of relationships. To do so, we first looked not only at the dominant relationships – the ones found on the best tree-but
also at all the challenged associations and the multiple
phylogenetic falsifications they allowed us to infer. Interestingly, we do not need a fully resolved tree to produce
such results: the list of the bipartitions, not necessarily
consistent between and within a marker suffices. Second,
we analysed the refuted relationships for multiple markers
of interest independently, to avoid masking any minor
phylogenetic histories that would be overwhelmed by the
consensus in a verificationist concatenation. We feel that
this perspective might more efficiently gain taxonomic
knowledge than the traditional attempt to increase the
support for a given possible phylogenetic group. Indeed,
from an epistemological point of view, it would allow
some firm conclusions to be drawn about which groups
are not true for a given dataset, while the classical
approach would establish only a limited number of relationships that have not been falsified yet.

Once the data have been organised (for instance along the
two main axes of the principal component analysis), the
two-sample T-test and the Wilcoxson rank-sum test can be
applied to compare the values of the coordinates of a priori user-defined groups of species [26]. These statistical
tests allow determination of whether two groups of data,
A and B, are not significantly different and can be considered as a subset of an overall common group or not. If the
data have a normal distribution, and if the means and
overall standard deviations of groups A and B are not statistically different, the grouping is statistically possible.
Conversely, if their means and their standard deviations
differ significantly, the two groups can be determined as
independent. The grouping of A and B is then statistically
rejected. Clearly, the size of the data sets under investigation will affect the overall accuracy of the statistical analysis, and larger data sets of roughly equal size provide
better estimates than smaller sets.

Our approach to refute impossible groups
We wrote a program in java, named Impossible, which
looks first of all for the relationships that are the most
strongly falsified by the genomic data, using bootstrap
bipartitions as infiles (see Material and methods for
details). In brief, Impossible estimates a degree of impossibility for any pair of species or groups of species by comparing and ranking all the bipartitions, for each marker as
well as for all the markers, if they are above a user-defined
threshold.

Application to several prokaryotic genes
To illustrate a possible use of our software, we considered
two prokaryotic datasets. First, Impossible was used to
study the mysterious phylogenetic position of Nanoarchaeum equitans, the sole cultured representative of the
phylum Nanoarchaea, for an archaeal dataset of 23 ribosomal proteins, including 23 species, belonging to more
than 10 phyla (see Material and Methods). Impossible
rough estimates indicated that it was more likely that N.
equitans should not be grouped with the Methanosarcinales/Methanomicrobiales (2723 degrees of impossibility), then not with the Halobacteriales (1461 degrees of
impossibility), the crenarchaeotes (1348 degrees of
impossibility), the Methanobacteriales/Methanococcales
(1335 degrees of impossibility), the Thermoplasmatales
(1280 degrees of impossibility) and the Thermococcales
(1208 degrees of impossibility), respectively. The PCA
reflects these numbers. In Figure 1, the Methanosarcinales
and the Methanomicrobiales Methanogenium frigidum

(identified as members of the Class II of methanogens in
[11]), as well as the Halobacteriales, fall far to the left of
N. equitans, suggesting that these species are not closely
related. We had however no direct way to test which of the
groupings of N. equitans with species falling close to it in
the PCA, such as the Methanobacteriales/Methanococcales (identified as members of the Class I of methanogens
in [11]), the Thermoplasmatales, the Thermococcales or
the crenarchaeotes, were rejected or possible. We thus
used these 4 different a priori groups, each containing
more than three species, to operate a "triangulation" and
define which could not be closely related to the Nanoarchaea. Based on the coordinates of each species on each
axis of the PCA independently, we used the two-sample Ttest and the Wilcoxson rank-sum test at the level of 5% to
test if some associations amongst all the possible pairs of
these 4 groups of species were significantly rejected. Inter-

estingly, the two tests convergently concluded that the
coordinates of the crenarchaeotes and the Thermococcales
along the first axis were significantly larger than the coordinates of both the Thermoplasmatales and the Methanococcales/Methanobacteriales. We symbolized this result
on Figure 2, by a vertical frontier between these two
groups of species, as the tests indicated that the species on
each side of the frontier (i.e. the crenarchaeotes and the
Thermococcales on one hand, and the Thermoplasmatales and the Methanococcales/Methanobacteriales on the
other hand) were statistically different. When we repeated
the same tests for the y axis, we observed a second frontier,
horizontal, separating the "lower" crenarchaeotes from
the "higher" Thermococcales/Methanobacteriales/Methanococcales/Thermoplasmatales. The conjunction of
these two frontiers remarkably isolated N. equitans from
the 4 groups, but left it in the vicinity of M. kandleri. This

analysis thus indicates that, contrary to previous suggestions, N. equitans might not represent a third archaeal
kingdom [27,28], nor a Thermoccocales [29], but clusters
within the euryarchaeotes, possibly as a relative of the
Methanopyrales. This proposition now deserves careful
consideration to ensure that it does not result from a long
branch artefact, since both Nanoarchaeum and Methanopyrus display high evolutionary rates for the components
of their transcription apparatuses [30]. The proximity

between Methanobacteriales/Methanococcales and Thermosplasmatales in the upper left corner of the diagram,
delineates another possible group. It is also consistant
with phylogenetic analysis of concatenated ribosomal
proteins that weakly groups Methanococcales and Methanobacteriales together, and the lack of any support in the
backbone branches separating them from Thermoplasmatales, which suggest that a specific sister-grouping
between them is indeed possible. However, so far no spe-

cific synapomorphies appear obvious. Other groupings,
such as the two distinct classes of methanogens identified
in a previous study [11], are similarly not rejected by
Impossible. Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales and
Methanopyrales fall on the righthand side of the x axis in
the PCA (class I methanogens) as Methanosarcinales and
Methanomicrobiales fall on the lefthand side (class II
methanogens) (Figure 1).
Another prokaryotic dataset of 31 ubiquitous markers
constituted our second case study, as the classification of
prokaryotes remains a major challenge for phylogeny
[31]. These genes, present in no less than 180 complete
prokaryotic genomes [12], are a potentially important set
of molecular candidates to analyse what might be the vertical backbone at the "Tree of Life" level. In order to reduce
the potential impact of lateral gene transfer or other artefacts that would contribute an important non-vertical sig-

nal, we carried out a first Impossible analysis focusing on
the congruence between these 31 markers. We performed
a principal component analysis, based on the degrees of
impossibility for the 58 most commonly rejected bipartitions presented by the Impossibility diagram. Figure 3
shows that all these markers belong to a cloud with the
possible exception of argS, valS and metG. We subsequently removed these 3 genes from our analysis and
reran Impossible with the same parameters on the 28 core
genes for which no incongruence was suspected a priori.
The second principal component analysis based on the
degrees of impossibility of the 28 markers and for 43 species is reported in Figure 4. In this diagram, the species
known a priori to belong to a monophyletic group tend to
group closer (i.e the Proteobacteria are very close on the
diagram), but the distance between the different monophyletic groups varies (i.e. the Proteobacteria are closer to
the Actinobacteria than to the Chlamydiales). Some phy-

Principal4component analysis of the degrees of impossibility of 43 species, for 28 core genes
Principal component analysis of the degrees of impossibility of 43 species, for 28 core genes. Each point on the
diagram corresponds to a species, and received the colours of its group, as indicated on the left of the graph. The two tables
contain the results of the two statistical tests applied to the coordinates on axis 1 and on axis 2, to decide if a priori groups of
points on the principal component analysis are overlapping or not. Eight groups were tested (see. Mat. and Meth.). When two
groups were non-overlapping, we reported IMPO for impossible grouping on the table, and when we could not reject the null
hypothesis that they overlap, we reported POSS. We indicated by an impo*, when one test only rejected a grouping.

logenetic information might thus be gained from this
principal component analysis. The tables in Figure 4
report when this dispersion in the principal component
analysis was considered statistically significant and
excluded that two groups belong to a common clade.
Interestingly, the two axes provided highly congruent
answers concerning which groups were rejected or possible (23 agreements and only 5 disagreements). Unfortunately, the position of the Chlamydiales remains
undecided. Their isolation from the other bacterial taxa
under study is made obvious on the PCA (Figure 4). Consequently, the Chlamydiales are involved in a very high
number of rejections of potential relationships in the

group-group diagram (data not shown but see tables in
Figure 4). This could be because all known representatives
of this group are obligate intracellular pathogens, a lifestyle that can result in drastic changes in evolutionary
rates and codon uasge biases. Additional slowly evolving
representatives of the Chlamydiales appear to be needed
to understand the origin of this group and no concatenated trees involving these taxa, wherever they branch,
should be taken for granted. It is interesting to note however, that despite their fast evolutionary rates, they do not
artefactually group with distantly related species (i.e.
Archaea), as would be the case due to typical LBA artefact
in a molecular phylogeny.

The non-conflictual information about the rejected
groups and the convergent information about the possible ones allowed us to suggest three possible groupings:
(i) the proximity of the Archaea and the Cyanobacteria,
(ii) the proximity of the Spirochaetes and the Actinobacteria and (iii) the proximity of the Proteobacteria and the
Firmicutes, while other configurations are rejected. The
possibility of an even larger clade comprising this last two
could also be put forward, consistent with the dispersion
along the principal component analysis. These results are
of interest as they suggest an early emergence of both
Cyanobacteria and Archaea, should the root of this tree be
placed in between the two prokaryotic domains. Should
the tree-like reasoning apply to these markers, this
hypothesis would be consistent with the proposition that
there might have been methanogenic Archaea and Cyanobacteria living contemporarily 2.8 billions years ago
[32,33]. Such an ancestry of Archaea is however importantly contested by T. Cavalier-Smith [34], for whom the
old fossil evidence is too indirect to be conclusive. Presently, Cyanobacteria live closely associated with halophilic Archaea in microbial mats found in saline
environments, and it has been suggested that the fact that
both Cyanobacteria and Archaea display gas vesicle structures (which help them keep afloat in their natural environments) could be the result of lateral gene transfer. Yet,
on the other hand, if the relationship between these taxa
is one of common descent, this feature could be instead
an ancestral characteristics of this group. Further in-depth
phylogenetic studies will be needed to decide if this connection is genuine or should be rejected. A priori, this
grouping is unlikely to result from an artefact due to preferentially shared lateral gene transfer, as prokaryotic
groups known to have undergone frequent interdomain
gene transfers (such as Thermotogales or Methanosarcinales) are not artificially attracted to representatives of the
donor domain in our PCA (Figure 4). Furthermore, earlier
gene phylogenies dealing with partially overlapping sets
of markers never identified such a problem [35]. Yet, it
might reflect another problem if one considers the proximity of Thermotogales and Aquificales (Figure 4), which
are both hyperthermophilic specialist bacteria with small
genomes, as artefactual. Perhaps similar lifestyles could
impose similar evolutionary biases on their genomes [35].
Finally, the possible proximity between the Spirochaetes
and the Actinobacteria, as well as between the Proteobacteria and the Firmicutes also deserve to be studied in evolutionary scenarios, as it might help to refine our
understanding of the bacterial evolution.

Conclusion
Surprisingly, the application of our simple software based
on a slightly modified perspective allowed us to extract
some original information about complex phylogenetic
problems. We easily rejected a large number of a priori

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

possible combinations, which is our primary results. That
some groups are left possible for these markers is then
mentionned, as a complementary result. None of these
possible group (the proximity of N. equitans and of the
Methanopyrales, of the Archaea and the Cyanobacteria,
the possible groupings of Methanobacteriales/Methanoccocales and Thermosplasmatales, of Spirochaetes and the
Actinobacteria and of the Proteobacteria and the firmicutes) should be taken as proven by this approach. Instead
all of them should be tested further under the advice of
biologists working with the organisms, with other markers or characters, and eventually be falsified. In any case,
we hope that our present work encourages the attempts to
multiply the perspectives in phylogeny. In this respect, a
lot remains to be done to investigate more exhaustively,
and with more powerful tools than ours, the "impossible
informations" carried by phylogenetic markers, and their
conflicting signal, which is too rarely discussed (but see
[36] and [37] for interesting exceptions).

Reviewer's report 1
Mark Ragan, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia

This is an interesting paper that challenges us to consider
current practice in molecular phylogenetics (specifically,
the testing of phylogenetic relationships) in the context of
competing theories of epistemic philosophy. The authors
ignore Bayesian approaches, in which the empirical relative frequency of a topology (determined by sampling
from the equilibrium posterior probability distribution)
converges to its corresponding marginal posterior probability given the prior probability distribution, model and
data. Instead, relationships are viewed completely
through the lens of the likelihood approach and its limiting case, parsimony (hence the authors' concern with
synapomorphies at Background, paragraph 2). These
approaches do not yield estimates of the probability of
bipartitions; rather, the robustness of a clade is typically
assessed by use of the bootstrap.

Philosophical theorising on classification is as old as
Plato, and will continue for centuries. In the absence of
logical error, the authors' programme cannot be proven
either right or wrong, although it might be examined
(subjectively) for aesthetic qualities such as elegance. Thus
I offer these comments to help explore not the truth of falsity of their claims, but rather their generality, explanatory
power, and utility in application to real problems.
(1) Does concatenation practice rest on verificationism?
The authors assert that when bootstrap values are low,
phylogeneticists "try to increase the support of the clades
under study by providing always more phylogenetic signal (i.e. increasing the sequence length)". No doubt some
do, but alternatively we might view sequence regions as
samples of the genome. A small sample (i.e. a single short
sequence) might represent a region of the genome that
happens to be anomalous in some way – as the result of
mutational saturation, selection, GC bias or whatever –
and it would simply be good scientific practice to obtain
further samples from different genomic regions, in hopes
of integrating over as much local misinformation as possible. The motivation would be not purely to pull signal
out from stochastic noise, but equally to avoid interpreting a local anomaly as the true genome-wide phylogenetic
signal. This seems beneficial regardless of philosophical
programme. Indeed it's not always clear that the verificationist and falsificationist programmes can be cleanly separated. Consider the following (admittedly not very
general) case:
To test the hypothesis "there are exactly 10 thousand lilies
in this 1-ha field", would I rather have data from a single
random 1-m2 sample grid, or from 1000? Unless the field
were fully tiled with grids and I can count the lilies in
every one, I cannot guarantee that I can definitively test
the hypothesis. But under either programme I'm better-off
with 1000 grids than with one: if the count exceeds 10
thousand (which, given the size of lilies, is more likely to
happen in 1000 grids than in one) then the hypothesis is
strongly falsified; and if not, I can use the number of lilies
the 1000 grids do contain to assign a more-accurate probability to the truth of the hypothesis. Either way, it's in my
interest to have access to more grids.
Author response: I want to thank the reviewer for his very
interesting comments. It seems to me that the sample perspective is interesting. I will embrace this analogy in my answer,
and I would argue (i) that falsificationism and verificationism
approach can still be distinguished, and (ii) that the a priori
hypothesis that there is a unique field to sample is coherentist
and is not a free assumption, as it biases the meaning of the
results of the multiple sample practices.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

It is indeed very important to have a better estimate of what the
field of 1ha contains (of what the tree of life is), if there is such
thing as a 1ha field (such a thing as a tree of life). If there is
no such thing, but several overlapping patches of grass, multiple
fields in this 1 ha area, then our estimate based on multiple
sample will certainly be accurate, but it will not be a relevant
description of the distribution of lilies. In fact, the number of lilies in each patch could differ for the simple and good reason
that there is no such thing as a unique homogenous 1ha field,
and then why would be willing to go on and comment about
how rich this field is? So if the background hypothesis is correct,
we are better off with more estimates, but we should make sure
that we test that the hypothesis is safe first. We can not only be
verficationist.
However, in phylogenetic concatenations, if someone assumes
that there is a tree, he is not prone to consider that different estimates could genuinely be different and that these differences
should be tested to validate the concatenation approach itself.
Where the falsificationist and verificationist approaches could
differ then is that while the verificationist would assign itself
the goal to describe the field as well as he can, the falsificationist would eventually be happy enough to reject 1. that there is a
field, 2. that there is this number of lilies in this patch. The first
one is coherentist (one field to count them all), the second one
does not have to be so (as many differences as we can report
could undermine the claim that there is one field to be discovered out there).
(2) In relationship-testing, would a falsificationist be
"more likely [to] be interested by the rejection of impossible groupings, underlining what can not be a natural
group"? For Popper, the possibility of falsification demarcated science from pseudo-science (see Conjectures and
Refutations). One exposes a hypothesis (here, a proposed
clade) to a risk (a test in which the proposed clade can be
shown to be false); if the hypothesis survives, its scientific
status is enhanced (if it fails, it might be rescued by ad hoc
measures, but would come out with diminished scientific
status). Falsification in this sense seems quite different
from what the authors propose, which seems more a matter of chipping away at the space of possible hypotheses.
Do the authors imply that by refuting some dozens (or
hundreds, or thousands) of clades, all remaining unrefuted ones (or the refutable ones among them) are
increased in status?
Author response: No, we do not mean that. We stick to the
deepest spirit of refutation, which is not about proving anything, but disproving some things.
For large datasets, astronomical numbers of possible
clades will remain, most of them untouched by human
imagination, but each now with an infinitesimally

Biology Direct 2006, 1:26

increased status. Or (as in the Nanoarchaeum equitans
example) must we happen to care about the individual
clades that happen to be refuted?
Author response: No increase in status for us. What was not
rejected remains unproven for us. We simply suggest that we
should keep in mind what was rejected and make it visible.
Then, if someones wishes to test the coherentist hypothesis that
Nanoarchaeon is a X, we could at least tell him what are the
many evidence that actually opposed to this claim.
(3) What does "falsificationist-lite" mean? In their
"Impossible" analysis, have the authors not fallen into
what Rieppel called the "semantic trick" of superficial falsificationism, where clades with little or no observed
bootstrap support are considered refuted? Is this really falsification, in either a strong or weak sense? Do the authors
recommend rejecting one pre-identified clade each time,
or are they carrying out multiple tests?
Author response: Falsificationist-lite means falsificationist in
spirit, more eager to disprove than to confirm, to stress the irreducibility of conflict than to hide it. We advocate this approach
not because falsificationism sensu stricto would be a better
approach than verificationism for phylogenetics (both could not
actually be applied in their strong sense), but because this perspective can complement the verificationism of phylogenetic
methods too prone to look at what the majority signal is, and
not to look at what the plurality signal is, and would reject.
Here, in this modest approach, we intend to provide a tool for
anyone who, once done with his individual phylogenies, wants
to look at the data in a way that he could conclude easily
enough about the falseness of some (could be multiple) preidentified hypotheses of relationships. So, in our approach there
is everything that is in the classical approach (a simple use of
bootstrap support to reject some groupings, but a refusal to use
it to affirm that a grouping is proved) and a little bit more (a
complex use of multiple bipartitions together to deduce the
degrees of impossibility of a given relationship). It means that
this approach is not falsificationist in the strong sense and that
there is room for improvement in this respect to make it even
more complementary to traditional approaches. It would be valuable for instance to evaluate what was never ever seen in any
trees, for any gene, not even ever suggested to be a grouping,
without resting on bipartitions, but maybe directly looking at
the pattern not inferred for each site in an alignment.
(4) Is lateral genetic transfer really the "most pervasive
problem" in large-scale phylogenetics? There is little evidence that LGT is a problem at all for many taxa that
researchers care about (e.g. animals, green plants, fungi).
A stronger case might be made for the problematic pervasiveness of model mis-specification, methodological
inconsistency, lineage-specific biases, long-branch attrac-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

tion, paralogy, or (for systematics) the grade-vs-clade
issue.
Author response: Certainly, those are problem as well. Hence
my claim deserves to be tested, but can not be tested with tools
that suppose that there is a unique tree a priori, and hidding the
conflicting signal instead of highlighting it. One reason for
which few transfers are observed by phylogeneticists using classical phylogenetic approaches is simply that they can not detect
the vast majority of these lateral events. The recent works of
Brochier et al. is an example of that: these authors (hello Celine
and coworkers) simply check if concatenated trees agree with
each other and from that compatibility conclude that there is no
LGT in their whole dataset. However, by doing so they simply
acknowledge that they manage to obtain a dominant signal,
which has not to be identical in any of the genes they used for
concatenation. All these genes could support phylogenies that
differ locally in topology, for instance because of LGT. The reason why the reviewer mention some presumably safest groups
(plants, fungi, etc.) could then be partly psychological. Because
some people believe that there are mechanisms causing LGT
that could be important in prokaryotes, they sometimes proceed
to some further phylogenetic analyses, which generally suggest
that phylogenetic markers are too weak to tell about the extent
of LGT, or even show some conflicting signal. Yet, for eukaryotes, few people have such an a priori belief, so few test it. Hence,
they can not see LGT, and not see it as a problem, and they
would keep thinking that artefacts are a potentially larger issue
in their dataset. But, should some of them start thinking that
protists acquire genes laterally, as suggested by Andersson, then
we might start seeing more reports of LGT in those safest groups
too. I feel this is a limit of many of Philippe's et al. publications
including protists in the analyses (hello Herve and coworkers).
Because they use long concatenation, they get nicely resolved
trees but those trees do not tell us anything direct about the true
phylogenetic history of individual markers, and if some LGT
were dismissed to got the emerging picture. So honestly, I would
say it is an open question at large evolutionary scales (when
protists and prokaryotes are involved), and to make our mind
about it more correctly, we will need to keep our eyes open to the
discoveries of microbiology and molecular mechanisms of LGT.
Also, I meant more pervasive because LGT undermines the very
existence of a tree of life, while artefact just make it harder to
be discovered.
(5) Is the posing of Cavalier-Smith's cabozoan hypothesis
really an illustration of testing multiple possible clades?
Cavalier-Smith is a powerful exponent of the position that
both clades and grades are important in systematics. This
position was once almost axiomatic, then fell into eclipse
with the rise of the strong cladistic programme. One suspects that Cavalier-Smith had more in mind than alternative topologies when posing the cabozoan hypothesis; the
"contrast of phylogenies" may be a key test among alter-

Page 15 of 19

Biology Direct 2006, 1:26

natives, but for him, there can be other key tests that are
not topological in nature.
Author response: You are certainly right. Tom Cavalier Smith
proposes indeed grades and clades (and I personally approve of
this way of looking at things for classification purposes). Also I
would assume that in many cases he actually means clade by
clade (even if his own favorite topology (classification framework) can change), hence these claims (and singularly this
one) could sometimes be tested topologically (among other
approaches).
(6) In what sense is comparison with other gene phylogenies different from total evidence, i.e. verificationism? In
the third paragraph under Results & Discussion, the
authors comment that weakness of phylogenetic markers
(i.e. their lack of resolving power, illustrated here by rRNA
sequence data) can hinder tests (including attempted falsification) of theories. If even robust results may be erroneous, what is to be done? The authors recommend
comparison with other gene phylogenies. This may not be
total evidence, but it does involve recourse to additional
information; in what way does this move beyond verificationism?
Author response: The approach is different and so could be the
results. Genes are analysed individually as well as collectively:
so individual dissent can be identified, local congruences can be
detected, so that the phylogenetic signal does not have to be
coherent at the end of the analysis. It may well be the case that
no common possible "groups within groups" struture emerges at
the end of such an analysis, and that we end up observing multiples patterns of rejection: coherent between some genes only
and incoherent with any other gene, while this is impossible to
report in a verificationist approach. So this differs from total
evidence in the sense that the goal is not to maximise the degree
of confirmation of a single syncretic hypothesis.
(7) Do concatenation trees represent the true genomic history? The principle embodied in the quotation leading off
the third paragraph of the section on Epistemological
principles ("inductive support works symmetrically...")
should, I believe, be credited to Kolmogorov. That aside,
one does not have to be a falsificationist to ask when, and
indeed if, datasets should be concatenated (the total evidence approach in sensu Kluge); this debate permeates the
supertree literature. More fundamentally, Ford Doolittle
has asked whether genomes necessarily have phylogenies
(his analogy with city telephone directories). Reducing all
of this to a battle between Carnap and Popper does injustice to the underlying complexities, both biological and
algorithmic.
Author response: Indeed, yet I feel it gives a solid rationale to
preach in favor of the diversification of methodologies and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

scopes in phylogenetics, a fields that tend to be too much concerned by the question "what is the tree of life?" and not by the
other most fundamental essential questions: "is there a tree of
life?" and "what if there is no such Tree?"
(8) Are species relevant? In the section on Epistemological
principles, paragraph 4, why do the authors relate tests of
'congruence' to an ontological conception of species, as
opposed to an ontological conception of genome? We are
talking about nucleotide (or protein) characters, not bear
hairs. In what relevant ways might the two conceptions
differ?
Author response: It is related I believe in many people's mind
as the use of a single phylogeny to find the single true phylogenetic position of a species is a coherentist approach. This means
that some assume that they will somehow end up equating the
genome histories with a single place and time along the tree of
life structure (the species origin). This conception of a species is
indeed not relevant to me, as I am more inclined to conceive
species as emergent cohesive arrangements of micro-components with their own histories, which can themselves trace back
to different "ancestral" systems at different times and different
places in the past. I am thus more interested in trying to test
how many genes can be proved to coevolve (to have a cohesive
pattern of inheritance). If it happens that we have no evidence
against the cohesion of all the markers under study (i.e. no different impossible groupings derived based on these markers),
then we could start wondering what their common tree is. Otherwise, we should prove that there is a common phylogeny for
species to be inferred. In this respect, Impossible analyses is a
good first step to test without a priori if a series of markers
should be combined and which ones.
(9) What body of observation or theory might inform the
user's choice among linear, multiplicative and exponential weighting (particularly given the non-independence
of nodes within a given tree)? Of bipartition support
threshold?
Author response: Because the issue of significativity is not specific to our software (who can tell what is the bootstrap value
above which a group is significantly supported?), I can only
think about being empirical. Here, we offer the user different
optional settings so that he tests their possible influence, to use
a metaphor to try to zoom in and zoom out the distances
between taxa and figure if the dispersal on the PCA for instance
is dramatically modified with some parameters choices, or
remain stable. Then, the user should report that such and such
groups where impossible given such and such tresholds.

This paper offers a fresh and interesting view of the epistemology of phylogenetic analysis. The authors start by
explaining that traditional phylogenetic analysis is verificationist in its epistemological foundations (inevitably,
this brings to mind Moliere's Monsieur Jourdain who discovered, to his great delight, that all his life he spoke
prose... but nevertheless, this is an important clarification
on the nature of the methodology that is applied non-critically all too often) and develop the alternative, falsificationist (Popperian) paradigm. They then describe crude
(by self-admission) software they developed to falsify
(prove impossible) phylogenetic affinities and present
some examples of phylogenetic inferences made within
this new framework.
The gist of the paper is, obviously, philosophical, and I
will make some comments in the same spirit, i.e., without
getting into details of the actual method and examples.
It seems to me that the authors under-appreciate (or at
least do not present explicitly enough) the complementarity/conceptual equivalence of the verificationist and falsificationist approaches.
Author response: We have modified the text to make this complementarity explicit.
Indeed, when a phylogeneticist embraces the falsificationist credo, she can (at least, in principle) refute all possible
tree topologies, except for one, and thus, effectively, verify
the only remaining topology. This is becoming obvious in
the case of 4-species tree: to verify one topology, all it
takes is to falsify the remaining two topologies. Of course,
in practice testing all topologies very quickly becomes
prohibitively expensive with the growth of the number of
nodes. However, refuting all positions of a given branch
except one is still possible. In this respect, I think it is
desirable to discuss some existing phylogenetic tests, such
as Adachi-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa: what is
their epistemological status?
Author response: Even if in principle it is absolutely possible
that refuting 2 out of 3 hypotheses could allow to establish that
the one that's left is the true one, I must stress on the fact that
there is no need that such a coherent pattern is to be observed.
It is also possible that all the three topologies could be rejected
by different markers (in this case there is no common best tree).
In absence of a common best tree, the issue becomes then to
identify which sets of markers were cotransmitted, i.e. because
they share common patterns of rejection and thus allow common possible groupings to be defined.
The status of the tests based on the comparisons of multiple test
topologies (i.e. Adachi-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa)
is interesting. We published elsewhere (Susko et al., 2006) that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/26

these tests have a high type I error (a tendency not to reject a
wrong tree). But, to put it in a more "philosophical" phrasing,
these tests evoke the Sherlock Holmes logic of inquiry: ""Eliminate the impossible, and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." The potential problem here is thus to
make sure that a proper set of hypotheses is being tested: if we
fall short when considering our test topologies for these tests, we
will end up picking the best of a bad lot.
The author seems be getting into a bit of a philosophical
muddle by tacitly equating verificationism and the principle of complete evidence. To the best of my understanding, these are connected but not inseparable. The more
practical side of the same issue is the emphasis that is
being made in the manuscript on the sequence concatenation methods in connection with verificationism. Perhaps, concatenation is, indeed, relevant when it comes to
complete evidence. Verificationism, however, seems to be
a much more general principle that permeates all modern
phylogenetics (although see above) and, as far as I understand, fully applies to single-gene phylogenies. I think it
would be useful to be a little clearer on this point.
Author response: The referee is right. The reconstruction of single-gene phylogenies is verificationist.
The above points are philosophical quibbles whose aim,
in part, is to show that the reviewer understands the epistemological issues addressed in this paper (I do not know
how well it works). Here, however, I come to the only
problem that, to me, to some extent undercuts the value
of this otherwise very interesting and promising paper.
While the entire work is about falsificationism and its
merits, the authors make a very strange, almost paradoxical somersault when it comes to conclusions and present,
mostly, claims on putative new phylogenetic affinities
that look suspiciously verificationist. It does not help that,
when one looks into specifics, each of these connections
looks dubious (granted, the authors are careful in pointing out that these are very preliminary indications). In my
opinion, it would be much more appropriate to make
conclusions on the falsification of some affinities that
have been previously considered valid on the basis of verificationist phylogenetics or other evidence. Only then, as
an addendum, some potentially interesting affinities that
could not be falsified might be mentioned.
Author response: The referee is entirely right. Our primary
results were the refutations of groups: that some groups are left
possible for these markers is mentionned, as a complementary
result. Yet, none of these possible group should be taken as
proven by these approach, instead all of them should be tested
further, with other markers or characters, and eventually be falsified. How dubious these connections are, based on those
genes, is however really difficult to evaluate, and that it is why

we report them for further test. If we compare the impossible
groups with some former propositions (for instance by pruning
the tree of life recently published by Cicarelli et al. from the
groups we were missing), we observed that the group of Spirochaetes and actinobacteria (supported by less than 40 % of BV)
is not rejected, while the group of cyanobacteria/aquifex-thermotoga (supported by 40 to 80 % of BV) is rejected.
