Results: The gene block in X. fastidiosa exhibits a sharply delineated low-GC content. This, as
well as bias of codon usage and 3:1 dinucleotide analysis, strongly implicates lateral gene transfer
(LGT). In contrast, parametric studies and protein tree phylogenies did not support the
origination of the Anabaena/Nostoc gene block by LGT.

Lateral gene transfer
Lateral gene transfer (LGT) has been generally accepted for
some time, as exemplified by the endosymbiotic hypothesis of organelle origin [1,2]. Nevertheless, a long-standing

background of general conviction has held that LGT is rare,
especially between distant organisms. However, the modern
era of genomics has been accompanied by increasingly
numerous claims that LGT is frequent [3-6], and there now
seems little doubt that LGT exerts a significant influence

interactions

Conclusions: Judging from the apparent minimal amelioration, the low-GC gene block in
X. fastidiosa probably originated by LGT at a relatively recent time. The surprising inability to
pinpoint a donor lineage still leaves room for alternative, albeit less likely, explanations other than
LGT. On the other hand, the large Anabaena/Nostoc gene block does not seem to have arisen by
LGT. We suggest that the contemporary Anabaena/Nostoc array of divergent paralogs represents
an ancient ancestral state of paralog divergence, with extensive streamlining by gene loss
occurring in the lineage of descent representing other (unicellular) cyanobacteria.

Background: Tryptophan-pathway genes that exist within an apparent operon-like organization
were evaluated as examples of multi-genic genomic regions that contain phylogenetically
incongruous genes and coexist with genes outside the operon that are congruous. A seven-gene
cluster in Xylella fastidiosa includes genes encoding the two subunits of anthranilate synthase, an
aryl-CoA synthetase, and trpR. A second gene block, present in the Anabaena/Nostoc lineage, but
not in other cyanobacteria, contains a near-complete tryptophan operon nested within an
apparent supraoperon containing other aromatic-pathway genes.

upon evolutionary histories. Indeed, it has even been
asserted that vertical evolutionary patterns of descent might
be impossibly masked by rampant events of LGT and that, in
fact, instead of bifurcating phylogenetic trees, a reticulate
(net-like) pattern exists [7-9]. On the other hand, others
urge a more balanced perspective, pointing out that alternative explanations for apparent cases of LGT have not always
been considered [10-14]. The rationale for explanations
other than LGT for genealogical incongruities (such as
hidden paralogies and reconstruction artifacts) have been
presented in comprehensive detail by Glansdorff [15].
Woese [16] contends that the rRNA tree is a valid representation of organismal genealogy, that LGT was rampant only
before the initial bifurcation of the universal phylogenetic
tree, and that LGT has become progressively more restricted
as a function of elapsed evolutionary time. Using the
aminoacyl-tRNA synthases as an example of the modulartype entities asserted to be most amenable to LGT, Woese
concludes that the genealogical trace of vertical gene flow is
readable, despite a significant jumbling influence of LGT. If
correct, this allows the optimistic viewpoint that the complex
interplay of vertical gene descent and LGT can be deciphered
to yield correct evolutionary histories, provided that sufficiently detailed studies are done.
Approaches for detection of LGT events are either phylogenetic or parametric. Phylogenetic approaches depend on
congruence of phylogenetic trees. Aside from technical difficulties of inferring high-quality trees, conflicts between trees
under comparison are not necessarily due to LGT, but can
arise from coincidental loss of divergent paralogs in different, widely spaced lineages or from convergent evolution.
Parametric approaches for detection of LGT include (but are
not limited to) the analysis of nucleotide composition, dinucleotide frequencies and codon usage biases. Lawrence and
Ochman [17] used such parametric analysis to identify a set
of Escherichia coli genes (17.5% of the genome) having putative origin by LGT, and this has stimulated much discussion.
High rates of both false positives and false negatives have
been asserted by others [18,19], but this is tempered by presentation of a rationale for why phylogenetic and different
parametric methods detect different gene subsets [20-22]. A
consensus seems to be emerging that the most proficient
attempts to reconstruct evolutionary events will employ a
multifaceted approach that combines tree inference with
parametric analysis in a biological context [21,22]. Lawrence
and Ochman [21] provide a number of examples of how the
context of biological information can assist the analysis, and
this approach is implemented herein.
If each member of a linked group of genes is already represented elsewhere in a genome, their origin by LGT is a distinct possibility, as their transfer en bloc as an operon unit
would have required only a single evolutionary event.
During an ongoing analysis of the genomic distribution of

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/2/R14

tryptophan-pathway genes, we observed two such cases, that
is, where one set of genes was phylogenetically congruent, in
contrast to the incongruence of redundant gene copies that
were linked to one another. We have evaluated the evidence
for the alternative possibilities of LGT or ancient paralogy,
as reported here.

A block of Trp-pathway genes in Xylella
The phylogenetic incongruence of trpR, a regulatory gene in
Xylella fastidiosa, led to recognition of a low-GC gene block
in X. fastidiosa. The tryptophan repressor (TrpR) is quite
limited in its phylogenetic distribution, being consistently
present only within the enteric lineage, as shown in the
protein tree of Figure 1. Here TrpR of Shewanella putrefaciens marks the outlying sequence of the enteric lineage
(shown in gray). Outside the boundaries of the enteric
lineage, only Coxiella burnetii, X. fastidiosa and two
chlamydial species are thus far known to possess trpR. The
distribution of trpR in the later three lineages is phylogenetically incongruent because they are widely spaced from one
another on the 16S rRNA tree.
In Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydophila psittaci,
trpR is positioned near structural genes of tryptophan
biosynthesis, but no indication of recent origin by LGT of
genes in this region was obtained [23]. X. fastidiosa trpR is
separated by three genes from two structural genes of tryptophan biosynthesis. These latter genes do not appear to be
essential for the primary task of tryptophan biosynthesis as
all seven genes of tryptophan biosynthesis are represented
elsewhere in the genome within one of two operons. Thus, in
X. fastidiosa the incongruous phylogenetic position of trpR,
the redundancy of the trp-linked genes encoding trpAa and
trpAb, and the distinct phylogenetic incongruence of the
latter gene pair all supported a reasonable possibility of
origin by LGT.

The tryptophan supraoperon of Anabaena/Nostoc
All cyanobacteria possess each of the seven Trp-pathway
genes at dispersed loci, and individual trees of proteins corresponding to these dispersed genes are phylogenetically
congruent. Although this generalization also applies to
Anabaena/Nostoc, this latter lineage is unique among
cyanobacteria in its possession of an additional set of Trppathway genes (lacking only trpC) that coexist within an
apparent operon. As shown in Figure 2, both Anabaena and
Nostoc exhibit the same relative order of operonic trp genes:
trpAa•trpAb Ǟ trpD Ǟ trpEa Ǟ trpEb Ǟ trpB. trpAa and
trpAb are fused, as indicated in Figure 2 with a filled bar and
in the text by the bullet in the notation: trpAa•trpAb. In
Anabaena, qor (encoding NADPH: quinone reductase) has
been inserted between trpD and trpEa. Another qor paralog
is present elsewhere in the genome of Anabaena. Nostoc
also has two qor paralogs, but neither resides within the
tryptophan operon. Other cyanobacteria lack qor homologs
altogether. In Nostoc, tyrP1 (encoding tyrosinase) has been

The tryptophan operons appear to be nested within what
could be a larger unit of transcription that is reminiscent of
what has been called a supraoperon in Bacillus subtilis [24].
The genes comprising the supraoperon of B. subtilis are
aroG Ǟ aroB Ǟ aroH Ǟ trpAaBDCEbEa Ǟ hisHb Ǟ tyrAp
Ǟ aroF. A hierarchy of internal promoters and terminators
exists for differential control of the B. subtilis supraoperon.
The Anabaena/Nostoc linkage group is additionally reminiscent of the B. subtilis supraoperon in the presence of aroB

and tyrA. Although B. subtilis does not have aroAI␤ represented in its supraoperon (as do Anabaena and Nostoc),
aroAI␤ is the homology class (of three possible DAHP synthase homologs distributed in nature [25-27]) that is utilized
by B. subtilis. A number of supraoperon gene insertions have
occurred outside of the trp operon as well. These differ for
Anabaena and Nostoc as depicted in Figure 2. Anabaena
has genes encoding aph and a hypothetical gene (open
reading frame (ORF)) inserted between aroB and the
trpAa•trpAb fusion. The aph gene encodes an uncharacterized protein of the defined alkaline phosphatases (metalloenzyme superfamily) (group COG1524 in the COGS
database). Among cyanobacteria, only Nostoc has homologs
of these two Anabaena genes, although they are not inserted
in the Nostoc supraoperon. Nostoc has frnE (encoding a
thiol-disulfide isomerase) inserted between tyrA(p) and aroB.

inserted between trpEa and trpEb. All other cyanobacteria,
including Anabaena, lack tyrP1. The two trp operons are
less compact than frequently observed elsewhere, and relatively large intergenic spacing exists, especially in N. punctiforme. The only instance of translational coupling is
between trpAa•trpAb and trpD in N. punctiforme.

Figure 2
Genomic organization of aromatic-pathway genes in cyanobacteria. Genes relevant to the common pathway segment, the tryptophan branch, the
tyrosine branch, and the phenylalanine branch are color-coded, as indicated. A system for uniform genomic naming of Trp-pathway genes or domains has
been used as previously implemented [23,57]. Fused catalytic domains are joined by solid black linkers. Gene positions along the entire chromosomes of
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 are shown. The qualitative presence or absence of genes in Nostoc punctiforme, an unfinished
genome, is also indicated. Detailed zoom-in schematics are shown for the gene organizations within the supraoperons of Anabaena and Nostoc, regions
spanning 13,000-14,000 bp. In the latter regions, intergenic spacing is shown, with negative values indicating the extent of genic overlap.

Four subclasses of tyrA are defined according to the substrate specificities of the TyrA gene product: tyrAp, specific
for prephenate; tyrAa, specific for arogenate; tyrAc, accepts
either prephenate or arogenate; and tyrA(p), has broad specificity but exhibits a distinct preference for prephenate.
Among all cyanobacteria, only Nostoc possesses frnE.
In their genomes outside the supraoperon boundaries,
Nostoc and Anabaena possess a full complement of genes for
biosynthesis of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. Even
these extra-supraoperonic genes of the Anabaena/Nostoc
lineage are represented by multiple paralogs in many cases
(Figure 2). If one considers the single-copy assemblage of
aromatic-pathway genes present in the Synechocystis/Synechococcus/Prochlorococcus lineage as a fundamental complement of genes common to all cyanobacteria, the
Anabaena/Nostoc genomic repertoire contains substantial
redundancy. Thus, Anabaena has two additional extra-operonic paralogs of aroAI␤ and trpD. In addition to extra-operonic, free-standing copies of trpAa and trpAb, a second
fused gene (trpAa•trpAb_2) encoding the two domains of

anthranilate synthase is present in Anabaena. Nostoc has
two extra-operonic copies of aroAI␤, aroB and trpD. All
cyanobacteria possess AroA of the I␤ class (aroAI␤). While
this is also true of the Anabaena/Nostoc lineage (in fact,
having multiple copies), both Anabaena and Nostoc possess
an additional gene encoding AroA of the I␣ class (aroAI␣).
All cyanobacteria possess a tyrA gene of the arogenatespecificity class (tyrAa), but the Anabaena/Nostoc supraoperons also possess a tyrA gene deemed to be a
cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase [28] with a favored specificity for prephenate (tyrA(p)) (C.A.B., R.A.J., N.K. and
McNally A., unpublished observation).
Figure 3 shows an evolutionary scenario, using a Fitch
diagram [29], that depicts the suggested origin of trpD paralogs via two gene duplication events (Dp1 and Dp2) that
preceded the node of speciation divergence (Sp4) to Nostoc
(Npu) and Anabaena (Asp). Consistent with the latter conclusion, Npu TrpD_1 exhibits greater identity with its
ortholog Asp TrpD_1 than with its paralogs Npu TrpD_2
and Npu TrpD_3. Likewise, Npu TrpD_2 and Npu TrpD_3

What is the origin of the LGT gene block?

Genome Biology 2003, 4:R14

information

Gene organization is subject to constant change. For precisely this reason, the overall gene organization within the
low-GC gene block might implicate a donor organism
because the LGT event is inferred to be recent. Because the
enteric lineage is a reasonable source of the LGT gene
block, it is pertinent that the gene organization around
trpR is highly conserved in the enteric lineage. Without
exception, trpR in the enteric lineage is preceded upstream
by a gene encoding soluble lytic murein transglycosylase
(slt). hemK is usually positioned directly downstream,

interactions

The co-variation of 3:1 dinucleotide frequencies of genes in the
low-GC gene block of Xylella with the corresponding genomic
frequencies was also evaluated using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Table 1 illustrates the data used to
compare the Xylella trpR gene and the Xylella genome. A
p-value of 0.730 indicated that the 3:1 dinucleotide frequencies
of trpR from Xylella did not exhibit significant co-variation
with the frequencies of the Xylella genome. In contrast, the
3:1 dinucleotide frequencies of trpR from Chlamydia trachomatis did exhibit significant co-variation with the frequencies characteristic of the C. trachomatis genome
(p-value = 0.031). These analyses are consistent with occurrence of recent LGT in X. fastidiosa.

refereed research

Since the basic single-copy repertoire of dispersed aromatic-pathway genes shown in Figure 2 for Synechocystis
(Ssp) is representative of other cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus (Syn) and Prochlorococcus (Pmu) and is also
present at dispersed extra-operonic loci of Anabaena and
Nostoc, an obvious possibility would seem to be that the
genes of the supraoperon originated by LGT in a common
ancestor of Anabaena and Nostoc. If so, speciation was followed by different species-specific gene-insertion events.
Because the divergence of Anabaena and Nostoc was relatively recent, evidence for LGT by analysis of GC content,
codon usage, or dinucleotide frequency might be forthcoming. A number of distinctive properties of the supraoperon
gene block represent items of biological context (as discussed by Lawrence and Ochman [21]) that potentially
could provide excellent tracking clues about the identity of
the putative donor in LGT. These include the overall gene
organization of the trp operon, for which many microbial
patterns are known; the extremely rare gene order of trpEa
trpEb instead of the typical order trpEb trpEa; the fusion of
genes encoding the alpha (trpAa) and beta (trpAb) subunits
of anthranilate synthase, a fusion that exists in only a
limited number of other taxa, and the presence of operonic
genes exhibiting distinctive homology subtypes (aroAI␤
and tyrA(p)).

Figure 3
Fitch diagram [29] illustrating the origin and distribution of ortholog and
paralogs of trpD in cyanobacteria. Paralogs, originating by gene duplication
events (Dp1 and Dp2), track back to a horizontal line, whereas orthologs,
originating by speciation (Sp1, Sp2, Sp3 and Sp4), track back to an
inverted Y. The six trpD genes of Nostoc (Npu) and Anabaena (Asp)
comprise a paralog set, and each of those comprises a four-member
ortholog set with respect to the trpD genes from P. marinus (Pmu),
Synechococcus sp. (Syn), and Synechocystis sp. (Ssp).

If the block of low-GC genes in Xylella really reflects an alien
origin, differences in dinucleotide frequencies might be
expected, as such context biases differ from organism to
organism. A 3:1 dinucleotide bias (third nucleotide position
in a codon analysis algorithm followed by the first nucleotide
position in the succeeding codon) was utilized, as it is the
dinucleotide that is least restricted by amino-acid preference
and codon usage in individual genes [31]. The 3:1 dinucleotide frequencies were calculated for the entire block of
low-GC genes, as well as for the immediately flanking genes.
These results presented in Figure 5 with a set of four selected
dinucleotides shows that dinucleotides frequencies of the
flanking genes were within a variance of about 4% from
genomic frequencies, whereas the low-GC block of genes
exhibited recognizably greater variances from the genomic
dinucleotides frequencies of X. fastidiosa.

The trpR gene in X. fastidiosa was previously noted [23] to
have anomalously low GC content, relative to that of the
genome. Low-GC blocks of genes have been attributed to
LGT before, for example, argF (present in E. coli K-12 but
not in other strains) is bracketed with unidentified high-GC
(59%) genes that together comprise a distinctive block of
LGT genes [30]. The flanking genes of trpR were accordingly
analyzed for GC content. Figure 4 shows that trpR in X. fastidiosa is at one end of a block of seven genes, all of which
have a distinctively low GC content (highlighted in green),
compared to the flanking genes (highlighted in yellow).

except for the Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans/
H. influenzae/Pasteurella multocida grouping (where the
downstream gene encodes a monofunctional biosynthetic
peptidoglycan transglycosylase (mtgA)). No genomes of
the enteric lineage were found to possess trpR in a
context of flanking genes that resembled the X. fastidiosa
gene organization.
The LGT-block of Xylella genes conceivably could have originated from a donor similar to a common ancestor of the
chlamydiae before the massive gene reduction associated
with the chlamydial lifestyle. This would be consistent with
the low GC content of both the chlamydial genome and the
LGT-block of genes, as well as with the observation that
chlamydiae and Xylella are the only two known taxa where

trpR is positioned near structural genes of the tryptophan
pathway. Direct comparison of chlamydial trpAa and trpAb
genes with those of the Xylella operon is not possible
because all chlamydial genomes thus far mapped lack trpAa
and trpAb [23]. In this context, sequencing of genomes from
closely related free-living relatives of the chlamydiae could
be informative. The currently available chlamydial genomes
also lack other genes of the low-GC block.
C. burnetii was also considered as a possible source of the
low-GC gene block in X. fastidiosa because it possesses
trpR. This potential LGT event seems ruled out because trpR
is not near any structural genes encoding TrpAa and TrpAb
in C. burnetti; C. burnetii TrpAa and TrpAb are not close to
the corresponding X. fastidiosa enzymes on phylogenetic

What is the function of the low-GC block of genes in
Xylella?

Genes encoding the two anthranilate synthase subunits
(trpAa and trpAb) and aryl-CoA ligase (acl) surely belong to
an operon, as translational coupling is evident from the
overlap of start and stop codons (Figure 4). Acl exhibits
strong similarity to coenzyme F390 synthetase of
methanogenic archaea, as well as to phenylacetate-CoA

If LGT accounts for the low-GC gene block in X. fastidiosa,
how recent was this event? Presumably, it was sufficiently
recent that significant amelioration to the genomic GC
content has not yet occurred. The closest sequenced genome
to Xylella is Xanthomonas. Genomes representing two
species of the latter genus have been sequenced, and both
lack the low-GC gene block. Therefore, the putative LGT
event occurred some time after lineage divergence of Xylella
and Xanthomonas. On the other hand, LGT presumably has
predated speciation in the Xylella genus as all three strains
of Xylella in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database possess the low-GC gene block. The T2
score of Hooper and Berg [31] measures the covariance of
3:1 dinucleotide signatures, and is designed to recognize very
recent imports of alien genes by LGT. T2 scores calculated
for the low-GC gene block of X. fastidiosa were not above the
required threshold for very recent gene imports.

synthase (trpAa and trpAb). These probably do not function
for general tryptophan biosynthesis since paralogs of these
genes, which exhibit a phylogenetically congruent context of
gene organization, exist elsewhere in the genome (Figure 6).
The latter genes are located within either of two separate
operon clusters (Figure 6) with the GC content characteristic
of X. fastidiosa. The GC-content values for the latter genes:
trpAa, trpAb, trpB, trpC, trpD, trpEa, and trpEb are 52%,
49%, 54%, 55%, 51%, 59% and 55%, respectively. Furthermore, Figure 6 shows that the organization of the full complement of trp-pathway genes into two operons in
X. fastidiosa is similar or identical to that of some of its
nearest neighbors on the 16S rRNA tree, although the
Xylella operons exhibit atypically large intergenic spacings.
None of these neighbors possesses the low-GC block of
Xylella genes illustrated in Figure 4. Hence, the two operons
shown in Figure 6 can be inferred to be responsible for
primary tryptophan biosynthesis throughout this clade.

ligase of E. coli. As Xylella does not appear to make the F420
cofactor that is the substrate of F390 synthetase, the function of Acl is likely to be closer to phenylacetate-CoA ligase.
The aromatic ring is highly stable, and CoA thioesterification
can provide chemical activation, allowing cleavage of the
aromatic ring, as exemplified by catabolism of benzoate,
4-hydroxybenzoate, and anthranilate [32]. Because acl is
tightly organized with trpAa and trpAb, it seems feasible
that anthranilate might be the substrate of acl. An anthranilate-CoA ligase has been described recently in Azoarcus
evansii by Schühle et al. [33]. The Xylella Acl exhibited
greater identity with phenylacetate-CoA ligase of E. coli than
with anthranilate-CoA ligase of A. evansii, but a given substrate specificity within homology groups often can be associated with different subgroupings [25,34].
If anthranilate is indeed the substrate of Acl in Xylella, it
would be a futile cycle if anthranilate were formed biosynthetically, only to be subsequently catabolized. Therefore,
it seems more likely that the activation of anthranilate
could be a step in the formation of a siderophore or antibiotic compound that is assembled by a nonribosomal
peptide synthetase mechanism (see Quadri et al. [35] and
references therein for numerous examples). Pyochelin
from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exemplifies an iron
siderophore whose peptide-based synthesis depends on
CoA-activated salicylate (closely related to anthranilate) as
a starter unit [36].

The Anabaena/Nostoc gene blocks
The large gene blocks in Anabaena and Nostoc that begin
with aroAI␤ and end with tyrA(p) exhibited GC ratios that
were similar to that of the host genome (Table 2). This is not
necessarily inconsistent with their possible origin by LGT
because the GC ratio of a putative donor genome could have
been coincidentally similar to that of Anabaena and Nostoc.
Accordingly, the 3:1 dinucleotide frequencies of the aroAI␤tyrAc gene block and the immediately flanking genes were
analyzed, but these dinucleotide frequencies also did not
suggest LGT. Figure 7 shows that dinucleotide frequencies
did not deviate more than 5% from the genomic frequencies
across the aroAI␤-tyrAc gene block. This contrasts with the
distinctly greater deviation of 3:1 dinucleotide frequencies
within the low-GC gene block of Xylella, which is shown on
the same scale as the Anabaena data.
Codon usage was analyzed throughout the gene block and
also failed to implicate LGT. Figure 8 exemplifies this with a
comparison of the pair of TrpAa domains in Anabaena, one
encoded from within the gene block and the other outside.
As Xylella also possesses a TrpAa pair, one encoded from
within the low-GC gene block and the other outside, the
analyses of these are also included in Figure 8 as a kind of
positive control. In Anabaena (two bars on the right of each
panel) the codon usage for leucine, serine, arginine, glycine,
valine and proline was very similar for the TrpAa domain of
TrpAa•TrpAb in the aroAI␤-tyrA(p) gene block and for the
stand-alone TrpAa protein. This contrasts with the results
obtained for the two Xylella TrpAa proteins, one in the lowGC gene block (on the far left) and the other (second bar in
each panel) encoded by the gene in the trpAaAbBD operon
(Figure 6). Thus, in contrast to the Anabaena TrpAa pair,
the Xylella TrpAaAb pair exhibited distinctly different codon
usage. Although this result is certainly consistent with an
explanation of LGT in Xylella, one cannot be certain that the
different functional roles of TrpAa domains might be associated with differing intra-genomic patterns of codon usage
that are not yet well characterized [37].

Analysis of protein trees
We evaluated whether the closest BLAST hits, using as
queries the amino-acid sequences corresponding to the
operonic genes of Anabaena or Nostoc, would be with other
cyanobacteria (and therefore consistent with origin by gene
duplication) or with another taxon grouping (consistent with
LGT). In either case, one would expect that the sequences
encoded by the operonic genes of Anabaena would be the
best matches for the operonic genes of Nostoc, as was indeed

A particularly fortuitous gene that could favor or disfavor the
hypothesis of LGT of the aroAI␤-tyrA(p) gene block in
Anabaena/Nostoc is trpAa•trpAb, a fusion corresponding to
two genes that are usually separate (free-standing). As only a
limited number of trpAa•trpAb fusions are known, possible
LGT donors can be evaluated. Organisms known to possess
the trpAa•trpAb fusion are listed at the top of Table 3.
Another small group of trpAa•trpAb fusions are known,
which are dedicated to phenazine biosynthesis and which
form a distinct cluster. These are denoted trpAa•trpAb_phz
in Table 3. Thus far, the trpAa•trpAb_phz fusions are limited
to species of Pseudomonas and Streptomyces. pabAa and
pabAb are homologs of trpAa and trpAb, and the distribution
of fusions involving these domains are also listed in Table 3 to
give a general sense of the frequencies of such gene fusions. A
variety of data (G.X. and R.A.J., unpublished observation)
indicates that equivalent fusions often arise independently of
one another in widely spaced lineages.

A different result was obtained for genes encoding AroB and
TyrA. AroB sequences in nature are rather divergent. All of
the cyanobacterial AroB proteins form a compact cluster in
the AroB tree (including the non-operonic Anabaena/Nostoc
aroB genes), except for those encoded by the Anabaena/
Nostoc supraoperons. The supraoperonic AroB proteins
occupy a tree position that is not particularly close to other
AroB proteins (the closest matches being on the order of
30-35% identity with some enteric bacteria). A similar

situation applies to TyrA(p). All cyanobacteria possess the
arogenate dehydrogenase specificity class (denoted TyrAa) of
the TyrA superfamily. The additional TyrA(p) present only in
Anabaena and Nostoc and located as the carboxy-terminal
gene of the supraoperon exhibits identities of 39-43% with
the TyrA(p) proteins of some enteric bacteria. These results
for supraoperonic aroB and tyrA(p) could be consistent with
LGT, but with no clear donor candidates available. On the
other hand, origin as ancient paralogs is also a possibility.

addition to the genes shown, has adjacent paralogs of trpB and trpD located on a large plasmid. The trpAaAbBD and trpCEbEa operons of the X. fastidiosa

the case. For all of the operonic Anabaena/Nostoc Trppathway proteins used as queries, homolog sequences from
other cyanobacteria (Synechocystis, Synechococcus,
Prochlorococcus) were the remaining top hits returned in
the BLAST queue. As BLAST hits must be considered imperfect indicators of nearest-neighbor homologs [38], the conclusion that the operonic trp-pathway genes are of
cyanobacterial lineage origin was confirmed more rigorously
by examination of extensive trees (available upon request)
constructed for each trp protein of Anabaena and Nostoc.
For the Trp-pathway proteins, all the cyanobacterial proteins
clustered together, regardless of whether they were Anabaena
or Nostoc paralogs or whether they were the singly represented proteins of Synechocystis, Synechococcus, or
Prochlorococcus. The same result was obtained for AroAI␤
protein trees. All the redundant genes exhibited identity relationships that suggested their origin by one or more geneduplication events in the common ancestor of Anabaena and
Nostoc; that is, exactly as diagrammed in Figure 3.

Figure 9 shows a segment of the 16S rRNA tree that contains
all of the trpAa•trpAb fusions which are known so far.
Cyanobacteria other than Anabaena/Nostoc lack the fusion,
as do all nearby lineages. The fusion is present in the cluster
that includes Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Rhizobium loti,
Brucella melitensis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and
Sinorhizobium meliloti. (A. tumefaciens, which is not shown
in Figure 9, is virtually identical to S. meliloti). Additional
phylogenetically spaced fusions are present in Thermomonospora fusca, Azospirillum brasilense, and Legionella pneumophila. Other fusions that involve trpAa or trpAb homologs
also occur in nature, as shown in Table 3, and a degree of care
is needed to avoid confusion between them.
A phylogenetic tree consisting of all free-standing TrpAa
and TrpAb proteins was constructed, together with the corresponding two domains of the TrpAa•TrpAb fusions (available upon request). Surprisingly, each of the 10 fusion
domains clustered tightly on the TrpAa and TrpAb trees, to
the exclusion of the free-standing TrpAa and TrpAb
domains. This is consistent with a single ancestral fusion
event, but requires the assumption of multiple LGT events.
However, it is surprising that no free-standing domains
(that is, close homologs of the original fusion partners)

cluster with either of the two sets of 10 fusion domains.
This might suggest an alternative to LGT, namely that there
has been extreme sequence convergence because of strong
selection for appropriate residues mediating domaindomain interactions. If so, it is possible that trpAa•trpAb
fusions occurred as a number of independent events, followed by strong convergence.
Figure 9 shows the individual genomic organization of trppathway genes in the 16S rRNA tree sector that is relevant to
the trpAa•trpAb fusion. The Anabaena/Nostoc lineage is
unique in having trpAa•trpAb linked to other trp-pathway
genes and is further unique in having an additional set of freestanding genes encoding TrpAa and TrpAb. Although generally uncommon, complete dispersal of Trp-pathway genes is
characteristic of the non-filamentous cyanobacteria, Aquifex
aeolicus and Chlorobium tepidum. The ancestral state of trp
gene organization has been asserted (G.X., C.B., N.K. and R.J.,
unpublished work) to be trpAa/Ab/B/D/C/Eb/Ea, an operon
organization seen in contemporary Cytophaga hutchinsonii,
Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Coxiella burnetii (Figure 9).
Dynamic gene reorganization events that involve gene insertions, gene scrambling, gene duplications and gene dispersal
are apparent from inspection of Figure 9.

information

The gene blocks shown in Figure 2 encode the entire tryptophan pathway (except for trpC), as well as the first two
enzymes of the common aromatic pathway, and the key
enzyme of tyrosine biosynthesis. Multiple enzymes catalyzing the same reaction have been described in developmental
systems where differential regulation of isoenzymes are
deployed in different temporal and spatial contexts. Filamentous cyanobacteria (such as Anabaena and Nostoc) subscribe
to a developmental program of heterocyst formation that is
widely considered the primitive state and that correlates with
their exceedingly large genomes. Unicellular cyanobacteria
such as Synechocystis, Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus
have far smaller genomes and lack the ability to fix nitrogen
(heterocyst formation). It, therefore, seems to be a distinct
possibility that the gene blocks diagrammed in Figure 2 (as
well as additional gene duplicates) are specifically involved
in specialized capabilities of Nostoc/Anabaena that do not
exist in other cyanobacteria. In terms of the evolutionary
scenario, the Anabaena/Nostoc lineage may reflect the

interactions

In fusion proteins an interdomain linker region of critical
length and mobility is important to facilitate specific domaindomain interactions. Fusions of independent origin might be
expected to exhibit a variety of linker regions. Particular constraints undoubtedly limit this variety, and such constraints
might be more stringent for some domain combinations than
others. (In the case of particularly stringent constraints,
similar linker regions would not necessarily demonstrate a

Interdomain linker regions

Only the two operonic fusion proteins from Anabaena and
Nostoc and the four rhizobial fusion proteins (Mlo, Bme,
Rme and Atu) exhibit linker regions of identical length and
obvious similarity. The paralog TrpAa•TrpAb protein of
Anabaena sp (Asp_2) seems to have a distinctly different
linker, and it may be that the two fusions in Anabaena arose
as two independent events. The partial sequences shown in
Figure 10 are spaced to indicate the seven independent
events of gene fusion that are suggested.

deposited research

If any of the trpAa•trpAb fusions, other than the
Nostoc/Anabaena pair, have a common origin, similar
flanking regions of gene organization might be expected
since all of the fusions are of relatively recent origin. On this
criterion, only R. loti, B. melitensis, A. tumefaciens and
S. meliloti exhibited similarities of flanking-gene organization, and this is phylogenetically congruent. These observations imply that within the span of phylogeny shown in
Figure 9, the trpAa•trpAb fusion may have occurred independently as many as seven times.

event (or the LGT event) occurred recently, that is, in the one
lineage following the time of its separation from the other by
speciation. Thus, the acquisition of trpAa•trpAb by Thermomonospora fusca must have occurred by fusion or by LGT
relatively recently, that is, after the speciation event that generated the Streptomyces lineage (see Figure 9). In each of the
remaining cases of trpAa•trpAb fusion, a relatively near time of
fusion shown in Figure 9 origin can be identified. These are
defined by points of speciation divergence between
Anabaena/Nostoc and other cyanobacteria, between the
Rhodopseudomonas/Sinorhizobium cluster (fusion) and
Caulobacter (no fusion), between Azospirillum brasilense
(fusion) and Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum (no fusion),
and between Legionella pneumophila (fusion) and Coxiella

Operon displacement

information

According to the foregoing rationale, isolated genes that participate in multi-step processes would not generally be
expected to have much success in LGT. In some cases analog

In this article we focus on a number of cases where at least
several trp genes are linked, thus providing analytical advantages offered by the analysis of more than one gene. These
genes are also redundant and phylogenetically incongruent,
in contrast to coexisting homolog genes that are part of a full
phylogenetically congruent set. Both of the latter are consistent with origin by LGT, but unrecognized ancient paralogy
is also possible. In the first case, the homologs coexisting in
one organism are xenologs, whereas in the latter case, they
are paralogs. A relatively simple example is the trpAa/trpAb
pair originally denoted phnA/phnB in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [39]. This comprises an anthranilate synthase that is

Has there been separate lateral gene transfer of

Specialized Trp genes not required for primary
biosynthesis

refereed research

Alien genes that may be subject to possible LGT can generally expect a hostile reception in that they lack a history of
functional integration with the resident genome. Genes that
offer immediate selective advantages (for example, antibiotic
resistance) are likely to persist. The acquisition of a completely new functional capability will often require an entire
suite of novel genes, and such recruitment is certainly easier
to envision if all of the genes arrive en bloc (that is, as an
operon). Once a primary biosynthetic pathway, such as that
responsible for tryptophan formation, has been established
and integrated with the individualistic metabolic circuitry of
a given organism, one does not expect facile displacement of
resident genes. This should apply even if the incoming genes
all coexist as an operon. We have found only two examples of
LGT of whole-Trp operons, that of trpAa/Ab/B/D•C/Eb/Ea
from the enteric lineage to coryneform bacteria and to Helicobacter, as discussed earlier.

deposited research

Conclusions

genes encode enzymes that catalyze the same reaction in a
multi-step pathway, and one analog gene might conceivably
displace another. Lack of enough information about genomic
representation of such analog genes can lead to incorrect
inferences of LGT. For example, the initial discovery of
“plant-type” AroAII in bacteria led to the assumption of LGT
from plant to bacterium. Elucidation of the fuller genomic
representation of aroAII ([27] and refs therein) demonstrated
the origin of aroAII in Bacteria, and plants probably have
received aroAII from the Bacteria via endosymbiosis. A
similar outcome seems quite possible with respect to the
“eukaryotic” fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in Xylella
species. Phylogenetic incongruities that involve such analogs
can pose great difficulties in distinguishing LGT from vertical
progressions of differential analog losses in different lineages.

not strictly required for primary tryptophan biosynthesis
and that is uniquely expressed during stationary-phase
physiology [40]. Why the generation of anthranilate under
these conditions would be of value is unknown, but phylogenetic trees clearly show phnA/phnB to be xenologs originating from the enteric lineage via LGT (G.X. and R.A.J.,
unpublished data). In this case, genes that function for
primary biosynthesis in the donor genome did not displace
the corresponding genes in the recipient genome, but have
instead been recruited to a specialized function. In Streptomyces coelicolor, trpAa/trpAb/trpB/trpD/aroAII are contained within a large cluster dedicated to antibiotic synthesis
[41]. Calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDC) contains tryptophan, and presumably the feedback-resistant variety of
enzyme encoded by aroAII ensures enhanced precursor flow
to tryptophan during antibiotic production. Detailed studies
have not yet been done to see whether the CDC gene cluster
originated via LGT or reflects ancient paralogy.
In this article, we have discussed at length the Xylella and
cyanobacterial gene blocks that seem likely to have specialized
functional roles other than primary biosynthesis. The Xylella
genes are associated with other genes that presumably dictate
a fate for anthranilate other than as a primary precursor of
tryptophan. We suspect that selective advantages conferred by
this specialized operon accommodated successful LGT to
Xylella. The Anabaena/Nostoc supraoperon is reminiscent of
the S. coelicolor system in the inclusion of AroAI␤, which
might enhance precursor flow to chorismate. Although the
Anabaena/Nostoc operon only lacks trpC, its features of
gene fusion and gene organization are novel. It might
perhaps have an unknown physiological function related to
the complex developmental programs unique to heterocystous cyanobacteria. We conclude that in this case the operonic trp genes are ancient paralogs of a dispersed set of trp
genes engaged in primary biosynthesis.
Against a backdrop where organisms generally possess
highly efficient and integrated pathways of tryptophan
biosynthesis, displacement of resident genes by LGT of the
corresponding genes is relatively infrequent. Aside from the
broadly distributed primary pathway, highly specialized
pathways are known that utilize some or all tryptophanpathway enzymes, and these pathways can originate by
recruitment of paralog genes derived from the primarypathway genes [42]. The genes of such specialized operons
may diverge considerably to meet the demands of a novel
functional role. In a contemporary organism this might have
the status of unrecognized (or recognized) paralogy, as we
suggest for the Anabaena/Nostoc gene block. However, such
an operon module also has strong potential for xenologous
transfer because of its specialized functional potential.
The tryptophan pathway exemplifies the situation where paralogs can be engaged in primary amino-acid biosynthesis
(widespread) or in a variety of specialized pathways (narrowly

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/2/R14

distributed). Aside from the extent to which the specialized
pathways may be individually intriguing and important, this
study illustrates that case-by-case analysis can distinguish
paralogs (or xenologs) from their homologs engaged in
primary biosynthesis. This conclusion is encouraging as it
shows that both vertical and horizontal events of gene transfer can be deduced to track evolutionary history.

Materials and methods
Dinucleotide frequencies
The CODONW program [43] was used to calculate 3:1 dinucleotide frequencies (third base of a given codon followed by
the first base of the next codon). For whole-genome calculations, genome nucleotide sequences (.ffn file) were obtained
from GenBank [44]. Perl scripts were used to eliminate the
defline and assemble all genomic ORFs together for
CODONW calculation. The length (from UNIX wc
command) divided by 3 was used to validate the absence of
frameshift errors. Pairwise covariation of 3:1 dinucleotide
frequencies was assessed by the Spearman rank correlation
coefficient [45], a nonparametric rank statistic for testing
monotonic relationships. T2 values were kindly provided by
Hooper [31].

Codon usage
Codon usage for individual genes was computed with the
CDONTREE program [46]. Codon-usage values for whole
genomes were obtained from the Codon Usage Database
[47,48].

Phylogenetic trees
16S rRNA subtrees were derived from the Ribosomal Database site [49,50]. Unrooted phylogenetic protein trees were
derived by input of the indicated homolog amino-acid
sequences into the ClustalW program (Version 1.4) [51].
Manual alignment adjustments were made as needed with
the assistance of the BioEdit multiple alignment tool of Hall
[52]. The refined multiple alignment was used as input for
generation of a phylogenetic tree using the program package
PHYLIP [53]. The neighbor-joining and Fitch programs [51]
were used to obtain distance-based trees. The distance
matrix was obtained using Protdist with a Dayhoff Pam
matrix. The Seqboot and Consense programs were then used
to assess the statistical strength of the tree using bootstrap
resampling. Neighbor-joining and Fitch trees yielded similar
clusters and arrangement of taxa within them. Bootstrap
values indicate the number of times a node was supported in
1,000 resampling replications.

Identification of linker regions
Fusion proteins were aligned (ClustalW) with one another
and with the assemblage of free-standing proteins corresponding to the amino-terminal and the carboxy-terminal
domains of the fusion proteins. The boundaries of each
domain were defined by the last highly conserved residues of
