Abstract
Background: Large-scale genome rearrangements brought about by chromosome breaks
underlie numerous inherited diseases, initiate or promote many cancers and are also associated
with karyotype diversification during species evolution. Recent research has shown that these
breakpoints are nonrandomly distributed throughout the mammalian genome and many, termed
"evolutionary breakpoints" (EB), are specific genomic locations that are "reused" during karyotypic
evolution. When the phylogenetic trajectory of orthologous chromosome segments is considered,
many of these EB are coincident with ancient centromere activity as well as new centromere
formation. While EB have been characterized as repeat-rich regions, it has not been determined
whether specific sequences have been retained during evolution that would indicate previous
centromere activity or a propensity for new centromere formation. Likewise, the conservation of
specific sequence motifs or classes at EBs among divergent mammalian taxa has not been
determined.
Results: To define conserved sequence features of EBs associated with centromere evolution, we
performed comparative sequence analysis of more than 4.8 Mb within the tammar wallaby,
Macropus eugenii, derived from centromeric regions (CEN), euchromatic regions (EU), and an
evolutionary breakpoint (EB) that has undergone convergent breakpoint reuse and past
centromere activity in marsupials. We found a dramatic enrichment for long interspersed
nucleotide elements (LINE1s) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and a depletion of short
interspersed nucleotide elements (SINEs) shared between CEN and EBs. We analyzed the
orthologous human EB (14q32.33), known to be associated with translocations in many cancers
including multiple myelomas and plasma cell leukemias, and found a conserved distribution of
similar repetitive elements.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that EBs tracked within the class Mammalia harbor sequence
features retained since the divergence of marsupials and eutherians that may have predisposed
these genomic regions to large-scale chromosomal instability.

Background
Large-scale genome rearrangements, such as translocations, inversions and deletions of chromosomal regions
several megabases in length, are characteristic of the
genomic instability observed in many different human
disease states. For example, jumping translocations often
result in tumor-specific chromosome imbalances that are
associated with oncogenesis in leukemia [1] and solid
tumors [2]. In addition to an association with instability
manifest in disease, large-scale rearrangements account
for much of the karyotypic diversity observed among species (e.g. [3]). While genome instability and chromosome
heterozygosity are often the immediate results of such
genomic change [4-6], propagation in the germ line and
subsequent fixation leading to species-specific karyotypes
are also potential outcomes [7,8]. Each of these specific
rearrangements, interchromosomal translocations, deletions or intrachromosomal inversions, requires double
stranded breaks. However, the genetic sequences associated with, and mechanisms responsible for, these breaks
and rearrangements are not well understood. Tracking
these chromosomal rearrangements in both species evolution and disease progression has led to a better understanding of the trajectory and character of chromosome
segments during periods of instability.
Nadeau and Taylor [9] proposed that chromosomal
breaks associated with rearrangements occurred at random points in the genome. This view has changed as comparative analyses using phylogenetic inference have been
performed on the whole-genome sequence data available
for several mammalian taxa [10-14]. These genome-wide
analyses show that there are many regions, or fragile sites,
that are prone to breakage distributed nonrandomly in
the mammalian genome [12,15]. Many of these fragile
sites are conserved between human and mouse [13] and
among such diverse species as rat, cattle, dog, pig, cat, and
horse [12] whose evolutionary history spans 95 million
years [16]. These data indicate that breakpoint reuse
occurs at specific sites in the genome (i.e. EBs). Such
genome-scale comparisons show that the fragile regions
in one species are often centromeres and/or telomeres at
the orthologous region of another species [12].
Recent studies of the evolutionary trajectory of orthologous chromosome segments in Metatherian lineages
(Marsupialia) show that EBs often coincide with latent
centromeres, locations in the genome that are predisposed to centromere activity [3,4,17]. While both the
metatherian [17] and eutherian [12] data suggest an association between EBs and centromeres across diverse vertebrate lineages, it is unknown whether specific sequence
motifs are common at both EBs and centromere domains
that may indicate shared function. Moreover, common
and/or conserved sequence motifs between orthologous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/334

EBs shared between eutherian and metatherian lineages
have not been previously examined. This study uses
sequence data from the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii,
in the context of the kangaroo karyotypic divergence, and
from human in the context of primate karyotypic evolution, to explore the possible relationship between these
two distinct genomic regions that share a common predisposition to both instability and centromere formation/
activity. We hypothesize that active centromeres and EBs
identified as latent centromeres are characterized by distinct repeat patterns that are retained during genome
restructuring events and that these patterns are a conserved feature of mammalian genomes. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, clone contig assembly,
sequence annotation and repeat analyses, we have examined sequence from a conserved EB that has been reused
multiple times in the derivation of divergent species karyotypes within the marsupial lineage (EB: Meu1q). These
data were compared to genome sequence from centromeric regions (CEN) and euchromatic regions (EU) for
conserved features that might indicate a structural and/or
functional link among these chromosome domains. In
addition, the region of the human genome orthologous to
the Meu1q EB was identified as an EB and further analyzed to determine whether specific sequences and/or
sequence classes are conserved between metatherian and
eutherian lineages during genome reorganization.
Here we report that a high concentration of ERV and L1
elements is shared at centromeres and an EB in the tammar wallaby, as well as at the orthologous EB in human.
These results show that the presence of these specific
classes of repeat elements are 1) shared at EB that are
derived from centromeres, and 2) are conserved at these
EB over 180 million years of evolution, despite replenishment with lineage-specific elements. Therefore, the concentration of these elements at EB and centromeres may
be a contributing factor to the karyotypic instability these
genomic locations have retained.

Results
Karyotypically defined regions of the tammar wallaby
genome
Previous studies have shown that junctions (heretofore
referred to as breaks) between conserved chromosome
segments in the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) karyotype, as defined by reciprocal chromosome painting
[17], carry the kangaroo endogenous retrovirus, KERV
[18]. In an effort to expand on the previous breakpoint
map, a tammar wallaby bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) library was screened with the gag open reading
frame of KERV [18]. From this screen, 49 KERV-containing clones were selected and mapped to metaphase chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
Of the clones examined, 100% mapped to regions recog-

nized as EBs between conserved chromosome segments or
active centromere regions (either pericentric or centric)
within the Macropididae lineage [17,19].
From these KERV-containing clones, three different subsets (see Additional File 1) were selected for finished
sequencing and analysis as representatives of specific
chromosome regions in the tammar wallaby genome.
These include those from a conserved EB, active centromeres (CEN) and euchromatic regions (EU) not involved
in karyotypic rearrangements in marsupials (Figure 1A).
The CEN locations used in this study are pericentric; however, the pericentric regions within this species are small,
with the entire centromere regions spanning only ~420 kb
[20]. Thus, we refer to these clones as centromeric, fully
aware that they likely encompass these small pericentric
regions. Three clones (B9, G7, and I6) localize to tammar
chromosome 1q (Figure 1B), a region identified as a
major EB within the marsupial lineage and an active centromere in Monodelphis domestica (South American opossum), Trichosurus vulpecula (brush tailed opossum), and
Aepyprymnus rufescens (rufous bettong) (Figure 2,
[7,17,19,21]). None of these three EB BACs form a contiguous sequence (see Methods). Three clones (B18, G17,
and M7) localize to CEN regions of chromosomes 5, 2
and 7, respectively (Figure 1C). Two clones analyzed (A8
and J6) localize to interstitial EU regions that are not
defined EBs nor latent centromeres [22] within the marsupial karyotype. A8 localizes to a region adjacent to the EB
on tammar chromosome 1q while J6 localizes to the middle of 6p (Figure 1D). An additional ten BACs previously
mapped to the genomic region encompassing the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR) in tammar
wallaby [23] were added to the pool of EU BAC sequences
used in these analyses. This region was chosen as it is the
only other region of the tammar wallaby that has been
fully annotated to date.
EU, CEN and EB sequences were analyzed for interspersed
repeat content and predicted coding regions and the BACs
isolated herein were fully annotated for LINEs, SINES, satellites, DNA transposons, RTE elements, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), LTR retrotransposons, CR1s, non-LTRs,
simple repeats and predicted exons. Full annotations for
BACs not previously described [23] are shown in Figure 3.
Comparison of the relative nucleotide content of the three
genomic regions indicates a homogenous distribution
with no single nucleotide being more than a fraction of a
percent different across these regions. The relative GC content is also uniform across all three regions (EU = 37.73%,
CEN = 37.25%, EB = 37.77%). All the identified BACs
were analyzed for possible contigs among them using
both Multipipmaker and Codon Code Aligner software.
No contigs were identified. In addition, it is apparent
from the annotation of these BACs (Figure 3) that they do
not form a contiguous sequence.

Enrichment of LINEs and ERVs at tammar wallaby EB and
CEN regions
The most striking differences between tammar EU compared with EB and CEN regions are the number and types
of repeat elements found as predicted by Repbase's Censor (see Methods)[24]. The total repeat content varies significantly but expectedly, with EU having the fewest
repeats (41.3%). Interestingly, the EB carries an even
greater number of repeats than the CEN regions, 64.21%
and 54.02% respectively (p = 5e-4 and 0.008). A total of
175 different types of repeats were identified. While the
abundance of most of these classes (115) did not vary significantly, there are many (60) that did (see Additional
File 2).

Both the CEN and EB regions have many repeat types in
common, most notably a significant enrichment of both
endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and LINE1s (L1s) while
being relatively devoid of SINEs (Figure 4A–C). This is
also visually apparent in the annotation of these
sequences (Figure 3). The total L1 average for each region
is 41.59% at the EB, 35.18% in the CEN and only 14.18%
in the EU region (Figure 4A). Some classes of L1s are
nearly exclusively found in the EB (L1-3_MD, L1-2_MD,
and L1_RN) but represent the minority of this general
class. Two of the most abundant L1s (L1-3_ME, L13A_ME) are found in all three regions but differ in copy
number considerably with the majority found in the EB,
averaging roughly 19.5 elements per 100 kb (see Additional File 2). This is significantly more than the 13.4 elements per 100 kb found in the CEN regions and
significantly more than the 4.8 per 100 kb in the EU (p <
0.001).
Of the 71 L1 elements (of all types) with 90% or greater
identity to their consensus sequences, 63% (45) are found
in the 972 kb derived solely from the EB and CEN regions
(approximately one-third of the 2.7 Mb of sequence analyzed). To further refine this apparent region bias, repeats
95% or more of their consensus length were identified as
intact and further quantified. The number of repeats was
normalized for discrepancies in region size among EB,
CEN, and EU by estimating the number of intact elements
for every 100 kb (Figure 5; see Material and Methods).
Intact L1s were primarily found within the EB region with
almost 2.4 elements for every 100 kb. There were far fewer
in the CEN (.23) and EU (.62) regions. These observations
suggest that the EB is enriched for intact L1s that have
likely been very recently active and may contribute to the
instability of this region.
Content variation between these three genomic domains
was not restricted to LINEs. ERVs make up 5.81% of the
EB region and 1.93% of the CEN compared to 0.51% in
the EU region (Figure 4B). The EB contains a wider variety
of viral elements than the CEN regions. The most conPage 3 of 14

content of 40.3% and slightly higher than previous estimates for the tammar wallaby of 37.0% [23]. The most
common repeat class found in the EU regions are the
short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), comprising
11.43%, and the non-LTR retrotransposon CR1s that
make up approximately 9.54%. This varies dramatically
from the EB at 4.11% SINEs and 5.71% CR1s and the CEN
regions at 7.16% and 5.92% respectively (Figure 4C–D).
The SINE content of the CEN regions, while not as dramatically different from EB and EU regions as for ERVs,
carries a SINE content midway between EU and EB; however, the CEN SINE content is still significantly different
from either EU or EB (p = 0.0026 and p = 0.012). Fulllength copies of SINEs are also more frequently found in
the EU (Figure 5). The CR1 content when averaged
appears very different in the EB compared to the EU but
only has a p-value = 0.212 due to the disparate distribution of this class on the three BACs analyzed. DNA transposons are more prevalent in the EU (1.33%) than the EB
(0.45%) and CEN (0.59%). One exception to this is the
DNA transposon CHARLIE1B from the hAT class of
repeats which is almost exclusively limited to the CEN
regions (data not shown).

served and abundant ERV in both regions is the virus
MERVK1-I as identified by Censor. This element is of particular interest because it is in fact a mis-annotated KERV
sequence, the virus sequence used in the initial BAC
screens and previously identified [6]. MERVK1-I is only a
portion of the complete KERV-1 sequence (Ferreri, O'Neill
personal communication). Repbase also identifies solo
KERV-LTR
sequences
(ERVII_ME_LTR
and
MERVK1_LTR). There are an average of 1.89 KERV and
1.07 KERV solo LTR sequences found in each 100 kb of
the EB. The CEN regions contain 0.78 copies (per 100 kb)
of both KERV and KERV LTRs while the EU regions contain only 0.23 copies (per 100 kb) of KERV LTRs and no
non-LTR KERV sequence (see Additional File 3). There is
a general enrichment of many different ERVs in both the
EB and CEN regions (Figure 4B) with KERV being the
most abundant and conserved and the only ERV present
in its full length.
The euchromatic (EU) regions, while being relatively
devoid of ERVs and L1s contain an average number of
repeats (41.14%), on par with estimates of human repeat

Ruiz-Herrera et al (2006) have shown the reuse of EB
between species as well as a correlation between fragile
sites and tandem repeats within these locations [25]. We
have found more simple repeats (including tandem
repeats) at the CEN regions than either EU or EB and,
interestingly, the fewest at the EB (Figure 4E).
This analysis shows a general enrichment of ERVs and L1s
at both a conserved EB and centromeric regions of the
tammar wallaby genome. More specifically, we have
shown that the L1 elements, L1-3_ME and L1-3A_ME, as
well as the endogenous retrovirus KERV and its solo-LTRs
are both more abundant and more intact at the EB and
CEN compared to the genic regions (EU) examined.
Conserved evolutionary breakpoint between tammar
wallaby 1q and human 14q32.33
To examine these regions further, the sequences of the 8
BACs (Figure 1 and 3) were examined for possible protein
coding regions. The sequences were masked of repeats and
analyzed with the two gene prediction programs, GenScan
and Genemark.hmm-E. Predicted coding regions were
analyzed using the BlastN, BlastX (NCBI) and BLAT
(UCSC) analysis programs (see Methods). Coding regions
were predicted in each of the three chromosomal domains
(CEN, EB and EU) at approximately equal frequencies.
None of the predictions in the CEN region were identifiable as known coding regions. Conversely, both the EB and
EU contain predicted coding regions with some sequence
identity, at least at the protein level, for known genes (see
Additional File 4).

Annotation of tammar BACs
Annotation of tammar BACs. BACs for the (A) evolutionary breakpoint (EB: I6, G7, B9) on tammar 1q and (B) pericentric
(CEN: B18, G17, M7) regions were annotated to obtain a visual representation of the genomic landscape of each region. Annotations include all predicted interspersed repeats and coding regions. (C) Included, in contrast, are two representations of
BACs from euchromatic regions of the tammar genome (A8 and J6). An enrichment of LINE1s (dark blue) and ERVs (red) is
seen in both the pericentric and EB with relatively few SINE (orange) elements present. Key to annotated elements is shown at
the bottom.
Interestingly, the EU BAC A8 carries a predicted gene with
high nucleotide homology (83.8% identity) to the human
gene Transmembrane protein 179 (TMEM179) (Gene
Accession # Q6ZVK1). TMEM179 is located on human
14q32.33 approximately 1 Mb upstream from the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) region, which has been
involved in translocations in multiple myelomas and
plasma cell leukemias [26]. Human 14q32.33 has also
been identified as an EB [25]. The localization of A8 adjacent to the 1q EB clones and the activity of IGH in human
cancer compelled a closer examination of the IGH orthologous locus in human with respect to conserved features.
The immunoglobulin heavy chain locus is approximately
1.25 Mb on human chromosome 14 and consists of both
a constant and variable region [27]. The IGHv region is
the most distal 1 Mb of human 14q, the assembled BAC
contig of which consists of 5 clones. Sequence alignments
using MultiPipMaker with repeats masked were performed comparing each tammar EB clone (I6, G7 and B9)
with clone sequences used in the assembly of human

chromosome 14q32.33 [28], spanning IGHv to
TMEM179. While there was no identity between these segments and I6, or B9, several regions of the EB clone G7
had significant alignment across the terminal segments of
14q32.33, representing only the IGHv region (Figure 6).
Each of these G7 sequences showed significant identity to
the IGHv region of many species including human,
mouse, chimp and opossum (see Additional File 5). The
alignments with tammar G7 were of sufficient length and
nucleotide identity to identify it as orthologous to the
IGHv region. These alignments at first glance appear disrupted but when examined in the context of the repeats in
this region as determined by our annotations (Figures 3),
it is clear that the orthologous regions fall between the
repeats (Figure 6). In addition, the alignments of G7 to
five different, contiguous clones from human 14q32.33
(Figure 6) are indicative of the segmental duplications this
region of human chromosome 14 has experienced [28]. It
is not known at this time, however, whether segmental
duplications are a shared feature between this region of
the human genome and the tammar EB region given the

Assemblies of BACs for the tammar wallaby across a
region orthologous to approximately 3 Mb upstream from
TMEM179 on human 14q are publicly available (Sanger
Institute). Two clones (H21 and O12) from this contig
were localized to tammar wallaby metaphase chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization to verify
orthology. Both clones hybridized to tammar 1q and verify this region of 1q as orthologous to human 14q (Figure
7A). While G7 and A8 align to the human contig for
14q32.33 (Figure 7A, right), the other two tammar EB
clones (I6 and B9, Figure 1B) had no significant identity
with the IGH locus. It is likely these BACs lie distal to the
break and are not represented in human 14q, however the
resolution of metaphase FISH did not allow for a finer
map location with respect to the 14q orthologous region.

Enrichment of LINEs and ERVs at human 14q32
Given the orthology between the 1q EB in the tammar
wallaby and human 14q32, we tested whether the
observed enrichment of specific repeats was conserved in
divergent mammalian lineages. Our data shows that this
breakpoint represents an EB that has been conserved at
least since the last shared common ancestor of the Eutherian and Metatherian lineages, approximately 147MYA
[16]. Moreover, this is an EB that is still unstable in
humans in that it is a fragile site that undergoes rearrangement during disease progression [26] and has been
observed to form a neocentromere [29]. Across human
14q32.33 are regions orthologous to both EB and EU
regions within tammar.

Multipipmaker alignment of tammar BAC G7 (1q EB) aligned to the 5 clones that make up the human IGHv
contig (bottom). Alignments performed with repeats masked. Above, map of G7 from Figure 3 showing repeat distribution
relative to regions of 14q32.33 orthology.

The pattern of repeats in human14q32.33 mirrors that
observed between the EU and EB regions of tammar wallaby (Figure 7B). From TMEM179 to just before the IGH
constant region (IGHc), the region orthologous to the
tammar EU represented by BAC A8, there is an abundance
of SINE elements and relative paucity of both LINE1s and
ERVs. The human sequence beginning at IGHc and continuing to the end of this region (IGHv) shows a dramatic
increase in LINE1 and ERV content and a drastic decrease
in SINEs, analogous to that observed for the tammar EB.
We have examined the repetitive elements across the cytological band 14q32.33 to determine if this distribution
represents an expansion of a small group of repeats or an
enrichment or absence of the particular repeat classes in
general. We found that where there was an abundance of
an element class it reflected an increase in diversity as well
as number (Figure 8). For instance, the number of ERVs
and LINE1s dramatically increases, as does the diversity of
those element types, with approximately 50 different
ERVs and almost 40 different LINE1s identified in the
most distal portion of 14q32.33 (IGHv) and less than 20
of each type identified in the more proximal region (EU)
(Figure 8A and 8B). The reverse is true for SINEs with as
many as 27 varieties in the EU region compared to as few
as 7 in the EB (Figure 8C). DNA transposons, despite the
fact that their quantity did not vary significantly, carry a
diversity across the region resembling that of SINEs. This
observed diversity is even more pronounced with up to 18
types in the EU compared to 3 or less in the EB (Figure
8D). CR1 diversity (data not shown) had slightly more
variety in the EU than the EB, though this may or may not
be significant as there are only 3 different CR1s throughout the region as classified by Censor. Simple repeats were
not included in this portion of the analysis as they are too
varied to easily group and analyze.
Interestingly, the ERV2 class of endogenous retroviruses
(as identified by Censor) was found almost exclusively at
the IGH region of 14q32.33 (Figure 9). All of the members found belong to the HERVK class of ERVs. HERVKs
are phylogenetically related to mouse mammary tumor

viruses (MMTVs) in mice [30]; KERV has been shown to
be most closely related to this group [6,18].
Human 14q32.33 is found at the telomere end of human
chromosome 14. To determine if this repeat pattern is a
feature of telomeric regions rather than that of EBs, two
human telomeres not previously identified as EBs [25]
were chosen at random (11q and 16q) and a repeat analysis was performed on the most distal 3 Mb of each. The
dramatic enrichment for LINE1 and ERVs was not
observed for either telomere (see Additional File 6). A
similar analysis was performed on the IGH region of the
South American opossum (Monodelphis domesticus) (see
Additional File 7). Though a similar trend is seen we were
unable to determine statistical significance due to many
large gaps in the M. domesticus assembly. However, there
is a very dramatic enrichment of L1s and ERVs across the
entire 4 Mb examined including the IGH region.

Discussion
The recent availability of large amounts of genome
sequence from diverse taxa has allowed for high-resolution mapping of syntenic chromosomal segment order in
efforts to understand the evolutionary trajectory of specific genomic regions. Murphy et al [12] examined orthologous genomic sequences of syntenic blocks among a
broad array of eutherian species and found that breakpoint locations are often reused between divergent species
and that these sites strongly correlated with centromere
locations in several species. Ruiz-Herrera et al [25] examined the Murphy et al. dataset and found that not only is
there a link between breakpoints and centromeres in karyotype evolution, but EBs also coincide with fragile sites
and chromosomal breakpoints identified in human cancers [25,31]. These studies suggested that EBs might continue to carry "signals" of both past breakpoint activity as
well as a propensity for further instability under cellular
stress; however, these studies did not examine EB
sequences in a phylogenetic context.

segments along species phylogenies in marsupial lineages

has shown that breakpoint reuse often coincides with centromere emergence [3,17], lending support to the hypothesis that EB serve as latent centromeres [22]. Thus, we can
predict that the EBs characterized as latent centromeres
might retain common sequence features between divergent taxa. Marsupialia offers an ideal system to study
genomic rearrangements and breakpoint reuse; this infraclass represents one of the most well characterized mammalian lineages with respect to chromosome
arrangement. Over 70% of extant species have been karyotyped ([32,33] and reviewed in [7]) and the chromosome trajectories of many families, genera and species
have been determined (e.g. [3,17]). With comparatively
little marsupial sequence data available, cross-species
reciprocal chromosome painting has been effectively used
to delineate conserved chromosome segments (orthologous chromosome blocks) and to identify convergent
breakpoint reuse [3,17].
Our study utilizes a comparative sequencing approach to
test the hypothesis that EBs and CEN share specific
sequence features and that such features are retained during periods of genomic instability and species evolution.
We have identified specific interspersed repeats, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and long interspersed nuclear
elements (L1s), enriched in EBs and CEN. These particular
groups of repetitive elements (ERVs and L1s) are also
found at several breaks of synteny between human and
gibbon [34] as well as two breakpoints examined between
human and chimp [35]. We also show that the interspersed repeat distribution of CENs and EBs differs dramatically compared to that of a previously analyzed
euchromatic region (the CFTR locus) [23]. In human
tumor cell lines, chromosome 3 shows regions of recurrent instability. The distribution of repeats at these loci
has a very similar increase of both L1 and ERV elements
[36].

Through BAC mapping and comparative sequence analyses, we show that the EB on tammar 1q is orthologous to
human 14q32.33. This locus has been identified as an EB
[25], is known to undergo translocations associated with
cancer [26], and has been identified as a neocentromere
[29]. We have analyzed repeat content of the tammar EB
and surrounding EU and compared them to the repeat
distribution of the orthologous human region, 14q32.33,
including the immunoglobulin heavy chain region
(IGH). As in tammar, the human orthologous EB carries a
significant enrichment of ERVs and L1s, with frequencies
of both sequences similar to that observed for tammar
CEN. These data suggest that repeat content defines distinct chromosome domains and is a conserved feature of
mammalian genomes. Moreover, CEN and EBs are
enriched for both ancient ERV and recent L1 activity, indicating these regional domains, and subsequent instability
that manifests as chromosome rearrangement or centric
shifts, is directly linked to the activity of mobile DNA. It is
worth noting that the primary satellite sequence found in
the Cetacea is derived from an ancestral mammalian L1
element [37].
The enrichment of ERVs, and specifically HERV-K retrotransposons, in 14q32.33 is of particular interest given
that this class contains primate specific lineages of elements and thus must be recently derived. HERV-K retroviruses consist of 10 different families of human MMTV-like
elements, denoted as HMLs 1–10 [38]. Some of these families, such as HML-2, are characterized by recent activity in
the genome and contain intact open reading frames
(ORFs) that encode functional proteins [39,40], while
other families, such as HML-3 and HML-5, have not been
active for tens of millions of years [30,38]. The prominent
element in the human breakpoint examined is denoted in
Repbase as HERV-K22, an HML-5 element [38]. Last active
prior to the split of Old World and New World primates,
this element would have integrated into this location long
before hominoid divergence, and thus has been retained
despite breakpoint activity in this region. Moreover, the
integration of an HML-5 member in this region parallels
an integration of another ancient HERV-K related element, KERV, in the orthologous region within the Metatherian lineage (Meu1q).
KERV, while ancient in origin, has retained a cellular function in active centromeres through recruitment of specific
centromere proteins and production of novel small RNAs
in marsupial and eutherian lineages [20]. Likewise, transcription of HERV-K [41] elements has also been retained,
although functional coding sequences for either class of
elements have not been identified nor has any involvement with cellular function been examined. Thus, not
only is there a tight correlation between EBs and CEN as
regional domains involved in genome rearrangement,
instability and karyotypic evolution, there is a tight correPage 11 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:334

lation between specific sequences found in these regions
(i.e. HERV-K type elements). Two scenarios may explain
the presence of these elements at orthologous EB: either
HERV-K replaced KERV elements within a eutherian
ancestor at the region orthologous to 14q32.33, or the
KERV and HERV-K elements independently integrated
into orthologous EB. Understanding the integration preference sites for each respective class may shed light on the
order of integration events.
Given the predisposition of the EB on Meu1q and
Hsa14q32.33 for continuous rearrangement through
double-strand breaks and ENC formation within both
marsupials and humans, the coincidence of specific
classes of retroelements at these regions implies they may
be integral to the underlying mechanism for prolonged
instability. A recent study of double-strand repair mechanisms in yeast showed that those breaks that give rise to
chromosome aberrations were repaired by homologous
recombination (HR) between nonallelic Ty retrotransposons [42]. In light of the finding that HR between nonallelic repeat elements contributed to a large portion of
the structural variation in the human genome [43,44], it
is intriguing to consider that sustained activity of retroelements, not necessarily through transposition, but rather
through an inherent propensity for HR between elements
at distant genomic locations may contribute to both the
evolutionary novelty of the genome but also to its innate
instability.

Conclusion
With many genome assemblies available, it is clear that
breakpoints in the genome are nonrandomly distributed,
frequently reused in karyotypic evolution and often
involved in diverse disease states. Phylogenetic analyses of
whole genome sequence has shown that breakpoints are
frequently the location of ancient centromeres and novel
centromere formation [12]. Our study examines the relationship between evolutionary breakpoints and centromeres in the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii. We have
examined sequence from a breakpoint (Meu1q) that has
been reused throughout the karyotypic diversification of
the Marsupialia. These data were compared to sequence
from three centromeres (Meu2, Meu5, and Meu7) and a
euchromatic coding region. We hypothesized that breakpoints would resemble centromeres in genomic content
given the prevalence for centromeres to occur at conserved
breakpoints in marsupials and found this to be the case;
both regions carried a statistically significant enrichment
of certain ERV and L1 elements. Furthermore, we
extended our study and examined the human ortholog of
the tammar breakpoint, Hsa14q32.33. This locus has
been known to be involved in translocations in many diseases, including multiple myelomas and plasma cell
leukemias. Moreover, a neocentromere has also been
described at this region. Our analysis of the human

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/334

ortholog shows a drastic increase in the number of L1s
and ERVs and a depletion of SINE elements, sequence features conserved at the tammar breakpoint and centromeres. Our results show these sequence classes have been
retained at this region since the divergence of marsupial
and eutherian mammals despite replenishment with lineage-specific elements. Thus, continued activity of these
classes of elements may contribute to the instability
observed at these locations and may serve as an indicator
of centromere potential.

Methods
FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization of BAC DNA was performed as per [18]. Location to breakpoints between conserved chromosome segments was confirmed by
chromosome painting as per [18].
Sequence analysis
Tammar BACs B9, G7, I6, G17, B18, M7, A8, and J6 were
sequenced at the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center
(NISC), as described previously [45]. Additional tammar
BAC sequence (from the genomic region containing the
CFTR gene) was obtained from NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ (see Additional Table 1 for complete list of accession numbers of BACs used. Human
14q32 sequence was obtained through the UCSC genome
browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/.

Gene predictions were made with Genscan http://
genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html with default settings (suboptimal exon cutoff = 1) and source sequence set as
human for all analyses. Additional gene predictions were
made using GeneMarkHMM http://exon.gatech.edu/Gen
eMark/. The GeneMark-E with GeneMarkHMM-E for
eukayotic genomes was used with human chosen as the
reference species. All predictions were performed on
sequences masked for repeats by Censor (see below).
Lengths of coding regions from each program were then
averaged and used to determine the percent of each
region. All predicted exons were analyzed using NCBI's
BlastN and BlastX http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
and UCSC's BLAT http://genome.ucsc.edu/.
All repeat analyses were performed using both Censor
http://www.girinst.org/censor/[24] and Repeatmasker
http://www.repeatmasker.org/. Both programs resulted in
nearly identical data sets. Sequence source for Censor was
Monodelphis domestica (the South American opossum)
when analyzing marsupial sequence and Homo sapiens for
human sequences. Repeatmasker default settings (search
engine = cross-match) were used with sequence source set
to either mammalia or human for marsupial or human
sequences respectively. The number of each class and individual type within each class of repeat was quantified as
both number of occurrences and as a percentage of

sequence for each clone. Percentages were determined by
totaling the number of nucleotides for each repeat class
divided by the region length. To determine the number of
each repeat class for every 100 kb, the number of each
repeat as reported by Censor was determined for each
region and then divided by the total length of that region
and multiplied by 100 k. Intact repeats were determined
as follows; all repeats 95% or more of their consensus
length were identified. These were then divided by clone
length and multiplied by 100 k. All repeats and gene predictions were fully annotated using the annotation program Artemis http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Artemis/
