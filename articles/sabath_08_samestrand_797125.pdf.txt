Abstract
Background: Same-strand overlapping genes may occur in frameshifts of one (phase 1) or two
nucleotides (phase 2). In previous studies of bacterial genomes, long phase-1 overlaps were found
to be more numerous than long phase-2 overlaps. This bias was explained by either genomic
location or an unspecified selection advantage. Models that focused on the ability of the two genes
to evolve independently did not predict this phase bias. Here, we propose that a purely
compositional model explains the phase bias in a more parsimonious manner. Same-strand
overlapping genes may arise through either a mutation at the termination codon of the upstream
gene or a mutation at the initiation codon of the downstream gene. We hypothesized that given
these two scenarios, the frequencies of initiation and termination codons in the two phases may
determine the number for overlapping genes.
Results: We examined the frequencies of initiation- and termination-codons in the two phases,
and found that termination codons do not significantly differ between the two phases, whereas
initiation codons are more abundant in phase 1. We found that the primary factors explaining the
phase inequality are the frequencies of amino acids whose codons may combine to form start
codons in the two phases. We show that the frequencies of start codons in each of the two phases,
and, hence, the potential for the creation of overlapping genes, are determined by a universal
amino-acid frequency and species-specific codon usage, leading to a correlation between long
phase-1 overlaps and genomic GC content.
Conclusion: Our model explains the phase bias in same-strand overlapping genes by
compositional factors without invoking selection. Therefore, it can be used as a null model of
neutral evolution to test selection hypotheses concerning the evolution of overlapping genes.

Background
Overlapping genes were found in all cellular domains of
life, as well as in viruses [1-3]. Overlapping genes are
thought to have unique evolutionary constraints [4,5] and
regulatory properties [6,7]. Genes can overlap on the same

strand (→ →) or on the complementary strand ("tail-totail" → ←, or "head-to-head" ← →, Figure 1). Different
nomenclatures have been used in the literature to denote
"same-strand" ("unidirectional," "codirected," "parallel,"
and "tandem"), "tail-to-tail" ("convergent," "anti-paral-

Orientations and phases of gene overlap
Orientations and phases of gene overlap. Genes can overlap
on the same strand and on the opposite strand. The reference gene in a pair of overlapping genes is called phase 0.
Same-strand overlaps can be in two phases (1 and 2); opposite-strand overlaps can be in three phases (0, 1, and 2). First
and second codon positions, in which ~5% and 0% of the
changes are synonymous, are marked in red. Third codon

lel," and "end-on"), and "head-to-head" ("divergent" and
"head-on") overlapping genes [8-11]. Here, we use the
self-explanatory terms "same-strand" and "oppositestrand" overlapping genes.
In bacteria, overlaps on the same strand are by far the
most abundant [10,11], most likely because, on average,
70% of the genes in bacterial genomes, are located on one
strand [9]. Same-strand overlaps occur in frameshifts of
one nucleotide (phase 1) or two nucleotides (phase 2).
Overlaps in the same frame (phase 0) are rare [11], and
since the reading frame is unaffected, they may be thought
of as genes with alternative initiation or termination sites
rather than overlapping genes. Phase-0 overlaps are not
dealt with here. Several studies have shown that there are
significant differences between the frequencies of phase-1
and phase-2 overlapping genes [3,8,11]. Overlappinggene pairs, in which the overlap sequence is of length one
to five bases (short overlaps), are abundant in phase 2, but
rare in phase 1. This difference is dictated by the sequence
of termination codons of the upstream gene [8]. Since
none of the stop codons (TGA, TAG, and TAA) ends in AT,
GT, or TT (needed to create the initiation codons ATG,
GTG or TTG in phase-1 two-nucleotide overlap) or start
with G (needed to create an initiation codon in phase-1
five-nucleotide overlap), short phase-1 overlaps can only
use alternative initiation codons. In contrast, as far as long
overlaps (seven nucleotides or longer) are concerned,
phase-1 overlapping gene pairs are more frequent than
those of phase 2 [8,11]. Cock and Whitworth [8] suggested that the phase bias in long overlaps is due to some
unspecified selective advantage of phase-1 over phase-2

overlapping genes. They also hypothesized that since the
bias was found to be universal and independent of gene
function, it might be a property of gene location. Krakauer
[4] introduced a model in which the frequencies of overlapping genes in different phases are determined by their
level of interdependence with respect to selective constraints. That model assumes an adaptive advantage for
overlapping genes in evolvable phases [4]. For example, in
phase-1 opposite-strand overlaps, in which the second
codon position of one gene corresponds to the third
codon position of the second gene (and vice versa), the
freedom of each gene to evolve independently is maximized [4] (Figure 1). Indeed, Rogozin et al. [12] found
that among opposite-strand overlaps in bacteria, the least
constrained overlap phase (phase 1) was the most abundant. Kingsford et al. [13] explained this phase distribution in opposite-strand overlapping genes by the
frequency of reverse-complementary stop codons in coding sequences. For same-strand overlaps, phase-1 and
phase-2 overlaps have equal selective constraints and are
predicted by this model, to occur in equal frequencies [4].
Previous studies [9,11] have found that the number of
overlapping genes in bacterial genomes is positively correlated with the number of genes, implying that gene overlap may be mainly the result of accidental or random
"trespassing" of one gene into another. There can be two
scenarios for the creation of same-strand overlapping
genes from pre-existing neighboring genes: (1) a mutation
in the termination codon of the upstream gene, resulting
in an extension of the gene downstream to the first inframe termination codon and (2) a mutation in the initiation codon of the downstream gene, resulting in an
extension of the gene upstream to the first in-frame functional initiation codon [9]. As in point mutations, where
the effect of nonsynonymous mutation is expected to be
stronger than that of synonymous ones, the impact of
mutations that cause extension is expected to vary according to the length of the extension. Since most mutations
are deleterious, long extensions of genes are expected to
be under stronger purifying selection than short ones [13]
and the frequency of initiation and termination codons in
a certain phase is an upper-limit constraint to the possible
number of overlapping genes in that phase.
Here, we tested the influence of initiation- and termination-codon frequencies as well as genomic GC-content on
the number of overlapping genes in the two phases.

Methods
Data of overlapping genes from 167 bacterial genomes
that employ the universal genetic code were acquired
from the BPhyOG overlapping-genes database [14].
Same-strand overlapping genes in each genome were classified according to phase and the length of the intersecting
segment. We defined overlap frequency as the number of

same-strand overlapping genes divided by the number of
same-strand neighboring gene pairs (i.e., adjacent genes,
which are located on the same strand and in between
them there are no genes on the opposite strand, Figure 2)
in the genome. In our analysis, we explicitly ignored
recombination and therefore we used the number of
same-strand neighboring gene pairs, rather than the
number of genes, because a neighboring gene pair located
on opposite strands cannot become overlapping on the
same strand as a result of point mutation. Short overlaps
(two and five bases in phase 1 and one and four bases in
phase 2) were dealt separately from long overlaps of seven
bases or longer.
The coding sequences of the studied genomes were downloaded from NCBI. Codon and amino-acid frequencies, as
well as initiation and termination codon frequencies in
phase 1 and phase 2, were calculated from the coding
sequences of each genome. We denote the frequency of a
codon or a group of codons with a superscript for the
codon's phase and a subscript for the codon. For example,
1
0
f ATG denotes the frequency of ATG in phase 1 and f NAT

denotes the frequencies of codons in phase 0 that end in
AT, where N denotes any of the four nucleotides. The
expected frequencies of each start and stop codons are calculated as the products of the frequencies of the codons
0
0
0
0
that combine them, i.e., f NAT × f GNN and f NNA × f TGN

for ATG in phase 1 and phase 2, respectively. If the codons
frequencies in phase 1 and phase 2 are primarily determined by the frequencies of the codons in phase 0 that
combine them, the expected frequencies would match the
observed frequencies.

Results
We identified 71,210 same-strand overlapping gene pairs
(Table 1). Short overlaps (of length two or five bases) are
rare in phase 1. In our sample, we found only 18 phase-1
short overlaps (0.08%, Table 1). In contrast, the majority

of phase-2 overlaps are of length one or four bases (20%
and 65%, respectively).
The frequency of long phase-1 overlaps exceeds that of
long phase-2 overlaps by a factor of almost 3 (Table 1, Figure 3, two-sample paired Student t-test, p < 0.001). The
frequency of long phase-1 overlaps is negatively correlated
with genomic GC content (Figure 3, r = -0.39, p < 0.001).
In contrast, the correlation between the frequency of long
phase-2 overlaps and GC content is not significant (p =
0.4). The frequencies of start and stop codons in phase 1
and phase 2 in the coding regions of the genomes are presented in Figure 4. Pooling together phase 1 and phase 2,
the frequency of stop codons (average of 13.16%) is significantly higher than that of start codons (average of
9.36%, two-sample paired Student t-test, p < 0.001). We
found that the frequency of start codons in phase 1 is significantly higher than that in phase 2 by a factor of 5.2 on
average (Figure 4a, two-sample paired Student t-test, p <
0.001). There is no significant difference between the frequencies of stop codons in the two phases (Figure 4b,
two-sample paired Student t-test, p = 0.13). These results
suggest that the difference between the number of long
overlaps in phase 1 and phase 2 is primarily influenced by
the frequencies of start codons in the two reading frames.
The difference in start codon frequencies between phase 1
and phase 2 can be explained by the codons in phase 0
that may potentially lend a dinucleotide to a start codon
(ATG, GTG, and TTG) in each of the phases. In phase 2, all
start codons consist of phase-0 TGN codons, which may
lend TG to form a phase-2 start codon. One of these
codons, TGA, is a stop codon that cannot be a part of long
overlap. The remaining three codons (TGT, TGC, TGG)
encode for two amino acids (cysteine and tryptophan),
which are among the rarest in protein-coding genes, with
a mean frequency of ~1% (Table 2). In contrast, in phase
1, the amino acids coded by NAT, NGT, and NTT codons
that may lend a dinucleotide to one of the start codons
(ATG, GTG, and TTG, respectively), are found in moderate
to high frequencies in proteins (Table 2). Interestingly, the
abundance of NAT-, NGT-, and NTT-encoded amino acids
is inversely correlated with the frequency of start codons
(Table 2). Moreover, amino acids encoded by NAT codons
which can form the most common start codon, ATG,
appear in lower frequencies than amino acids encoded by
NGT- and NTT-encoded amino acids. For all bacteria and
for all GC contents the frequencies of amino acids coded
by TGN codons are lower than each of the amino acid
groups encoded by NAT, NGT, and NTT (Figure 5, all pairwise two-sample paired Student t-tests, p < 0.001).
Thus, consideration of the number of amino acids and
their frequencies alone will lead us to expect start codons
to occur much more frequently in phase 1 than in phase

2. However, the difference in amino acids usage does not
provide a very good fit to the observed frequencies. This
can be achieved by a more detailed compositional argument, one that is based on codon frequencies. Such a
model will accommodate differences in GC content and
codon usage among the bacteria under study. We found
that the frequencies of the codons that combine to form

start and stop codons (e.g., f NAT × f GNN and f NNA × f TGN

for ATG), are strongly correlated with the frequencies of
start and stop codons in both phases, as well as with
genomic GC content (Table 3).
To control for potential annotation errors, we used a subset of overlapping genes that were not annotated as
"hypothetical," "putative" or "pseudogene" in the NCBI
genome data. This subset of overlapping genes, which we
assume to be more accurately annotated, contains 31,767
gene pairs (45% of the complete set). As in the complete
set, the frequency of long phase-1 overlaps exceeds the frequency of long phase-2 overlaps by a factor of 3.1 and the
frequency of long phase-1 overlaps is negatively correlated

with genomic GC content (r = -0.28, p < 0.001), whereas
the frequency of long phase-2 overlaps is not (p = 0.6).
Therefore, the influence of misannotation seems not to be
significant.

Discussion
Understanding the distribution of overlapping genes in
different phases is a key step towards distinguishing
between the effects of selection and mutation on the evolution of overlapping genes. Krakauer [4] showed that
overlapping genes in different orientations and phases
differ in the freedom for each gene to evolve independently. Therefore, he suggested that the variation in selective constraints would be reflected in the frequency of the
overlap phases. In the case of same-strand overlapping
genes, his model predicted no difference between the frequency of phase-1 and phase-2 overlaps [4]. However, in
agreement with previous studies [3,8,11], our results indicate a preponderance of long phase-1 overlaps over long
phase-2 overlaps. Cock and Whitworth [8] attributed the
difference between the number of long overlaps in the
two phases to either gene location or to an unspecified
selective advantage. These hypotheses cannot be quantifiably tested.
Considering the two scenarios for the creation of samestrand overlapping genes, we showed that the phase bias
in long overlaps might be attributed to a great extant to
overlaps created by 5'-end mutation of the downstream
gene. Since there is purifying selection against long overlaps, the frequency of start codons in phase 2 constrains
the number of overlap that can be created in that phase
and leads to the phase bias. In addition, we showed that
the difference in start codon frequencies between phase 1
and phase 2 is dictated by the frequencies of amino acids
whose codons may combine to form start codons in the
two phases. Finally, the dependency of frame-shift start
and stop codons on species-specific codon usage result in
a correlation between long phase-1 overlap frequency and
genomic GC content.

shift start and stop codons. This correlation is expected to
have lower statistical significance than that of phase-1
overlaps because of the smaller sample size, but it is also
possible that other factors affect the potential for overlap
as well. A more complex compositional model for overlapping genes frequency, might include the length distribution of overlaps, the frequencies of regulatory elements
(e.g., Shine-Delgarno sequences) and the strand-specific
composition bias, since bacterial genomes have an asymmetrical chirochoric base composition [15-17].
The wide abundance of overlapping genes and the
straightforward definition of phase evolvability make the
phase distribution of overlapping genes an interesting
case study. If evolvability is selected for, the expectation is
for a positive correlation to exist between the frequency of
an overlap phase and its evolvability. Evolvability considerations predict phase-1 and phase-2 overlaps to occur at
equal frequencies [4]. Therefore, our data does not support a role for evolvability in the evolution of same-strand
overlapping genes.
Fukuda et al. [9] examined homologous overlapping
genes in related bacterial species and found that the rate

of accumulation and degradation of overlapping pairs is
higher for overlaps caused by mutation at the 3'-end of the
upstream gene compared to overlaps caused by mutation
at the 5'-end of the downstream gene. The difference in
rates was suggested to be a result of an evolutionary constraint imposed on the 5'-end of genes [9]. Our model predicts a difference in these rates simply because of the
higher frequency of frame-shift stop codons compared to
the frequency of frame-shift start codons. It would be
interesting to test whether the rate difference of accumulation and degradation of overlapping gene pairs in the two
scenarios holds even when accounting for the difference
in frequency of frame-shift stop codons compared to
frame-shift start codons.
The high frequency of frame-shift stop codons was previously suggested to be under positive selection for minimization of frame-shift translation errors [18,19]. We found
that the frequency of frame-shift stop codons is strongly
correlated with genomic GC content leading to AT-rich
genomes having five times more frame-shift stop codons
than GC-rich genomes. Therefore, it seems that the mutation pattern is a major player in determining frame-shift

phase 2. However, Belshaw et al. [20] did not distinguish
between short overlaps, in which phase-1 overlaps are
extremely rare, and long overlaps. We showed that at least
as far as bacteria are concerned, pooling short and long
overlaps together results in obscuring the pattern for long
overlaps (Table 1). Therefore, the similar frequencies of
overall overlaps in phase 1 and phase 2 in RNA viruses
[20], suggests that the phase bias in long overlaps was
most likely unnoticed.

Conclusion
1. The phase-distribution of same-strand overlapping
genes in bacteria is determined by the frame-shift frequencies of start and stop codons in protein-coding genes.

stop-codon frequencies, while selection does not seem to
play a major role.
Viral genomes also exhibit high frequencies of overlapping genes. In a study of RNA viruses, Belshaw et al. [20]
distinguished between internal overlaps, in which one
gene is embedded within the other, and terminal overlaps. For internal overlaps, it was found that, similar to
bacteria, there is a predominance of phase-1 overlaps
[20]. In the case of terminal overlaps, Belshaw et al. [20]
reported no frequency difference between phase 1 and

2. The predominance of long phase-1 overlaps results
from a lower frequency of start codons in phase 2 that limits the potential overlaps created by an upstream extension of the downstream gene.
3. The difference in the frequency of start codons is dictated by the abundance of those amino acids that are
encoded by codons that combine to form start codons in
phase 1 and phase 2. This difference is conserved among
all the bacterial genomes in the study.
4. The variability of codon usage across bacterial genomes
leads to a correlation between long phase-1 overlaps and
genomic GC content.
5. Our model explains the phase bias in same-strand overlapping genes by compositional factors without invoking
selection. Therefore, it can be used as a null model of neutral evolution for testing selection hypotheses affecting
the evolution of overlapping genes.

Reviewer's report 1
Review by Bill Martin, University of Dusseldorf.

This is an interesting and straightforward paper showing
that the main patterns shown by overlapping genes can be
simply explained with constraints posed by base compositional factors and the nature of the genetic code. I had
not thought much about overlapping genes and the
conundrum that they entail, and I suspect that many other
readers have not either, so the present paper was a very
worthwhile read for me and I suspect that others will see
it similarly.
Reviewer's report 2
Review by Itai Yanai, Department of Biology, Technion –
Israel Institute of Technology

1) In this paper, Sabath et al. propose a convincingly simple explanation for a known genomic bias without
recourse to positive selection. This is a significant achievement and a sobering one too given that it offers a minimal
mechanism to a process where only complicated explanations were previously available. The coding regions of
neighboring same-strand genes sometimes overlap, and
for this overlap to consist of a different open reading
frame a frame-shift of one (phase 1) or two (phase 2)
base-pairs may be introduced. While it might be expected
that both phases occur equally frequently, Sabath et al.
confirm, using a large set of 167 genomes, the previously
reported observation that long overlaps (=7 bp), phase 1's
are favored 3 to 1 to phase 2's. This trend has been previously attributed to an unknown selective advantage or
genomic location; however the authors here provide evidence for the preference of phase 1 codons from a simple
base-pair compositional perspective.
2) The results can be essentially seen here as two themes:
1. Sabath et al. show that when examining coding regions,
the codons in phase 1 contain more start codons than in
the phase 2; and 2. that this trend holds across 167
genomes, although an impressive dependency with GC
content is also revealed. For the former, the authors make
the argument that the formation of a start codon in phase
2 is less probably since it requires rare phase 0 codons.
This is a simple and brilliant explanation that appears well
supported by the data. It is an explanation which does not
require special selective biases and I fully support the
authors claim that this is a neutral model which ought to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/36

be considered the null-hypothesis for the formation of
overlapping genes.
3) As noted by the authors however, there seems to be
another layer to this puzzle that remains unsolved.
Throughout, Sabath et al. demonstrate the correlations
across an axis of GC content, where genomes with a high
GC content contains less fraction overlapping genes, of
start codons in phase 1, and of stop codons in both phase
1, and 2. These strong correlation are the elephant in the
room, especially contrasted with the lack of correlation of
GC content with phase-2 long overlaps. It would be interesting to test whether frequent phase 0 codons lead to
more popular codons in phase 1 than in phase 2. Since a
gene with less frequent codons may also have low expression, purifying selection would tend to select against overlaps with unpopular codons. This analysis would
generalize Sabath et al.'s analysis of the start/stop codons
to the entire genetic code.
Author's response
The lack of correlation between phase-2 long overlaps and
genomic GC content is, indeed, unresolved. When trying to
resolve this issue, one has to keep in mind that the observed negative correlation between start and stop codons and GC content
is a result of these codons being AT rich in sequence. However,
this overall negative correlation contains particular positive correlations between GC content and some phase-0 codons that
combine to yield start or stop codons in phase 1 and phase 2.
For example, there is a negative correlation between GC content and the start codons ATG, GTG, and TTG in phase 2,
whereas, the correlation between GC content and phase-0 TGC
and TGG codons that may combine to yield a start codon in
phase 2 is positive (data not shown). Unfortunately, this issue
cannot be simply resolved by focusing on overlaps with one start
codon at a time, since the factors governing start codon usage
are not well understood for either overlapping or non-overlapping genes. The suggestion that the frequencies of overlap
phases are influenced by codon-bias in phase-0 codons is important and should be studied in the future. In fact, as noted in the
discussion, it would be important to consider other compositional factors (such as the length distribution of overlaps, the
frequencies of regulatory elements, and the strand-specific composition bias) as well.

4) On a final note, I do not agree with the authors statements on the evolvability of overlap in the Discussion section. Sabath et al. write: "If evolvability is selected for, the
expectation is for a positive correlation to exist between
the frequency of an overlap phase and its evolvability.
Evolvability considerations predict phase-1 and phase-2
overlaps to occur at equal frequencies [4]. Therefore, our
data does not support a role for evolvability in the evolution of same-strand overlapping genes." It is not clear
what exactly is meant by evolvability in this context, and

why an equal frequency among the phases would support
this. I would have expected the authors to conclude here
that evolvability is an inappropriate issue when discussing
overlapping genes since the evidence provided here point
to a predominantly neutral process.
Author's response
For better or worse, the topic of evolvability of biological entities
has been a subject of great interest in the recent years [reviewed
in [21]]. However, the quantification of evolvability has been a
difficult task. Overlapping genes are unique in that their evolvability can be quantified objectively. A biological system is
evolvable if it can acquire novel functions through genetic
change. In the case of overlapping genes, evolvability was
defined as the degree in which each of the overlapping genes
can evolve independently [4], i.e., the proportion of changes
that are nonsynonymous in one gene and synonymous in the
overlapping gene. Given that the three codon-positions are different in the proportion of changes that are synonymous (~5%,
0%, and ~70% for first, second, and third codon positions,
respectively), phase evolvability depends on the combination of
the three codon-positions in the two overlapping genes. For
example, opposite-strand phase 2 is the least evolvable phase
with the third codon position in one gene corresponds to the
third codon position of the second gene (and vice versa), leading to maximization of the proportion of changes that are nonsynonymous in both genes (Figure 1). In contrast, oppositestrand phase 1 is the most evolvable phase, with the second
codon position of one gene corresponds to the third codon position of the second gene (and vice versa) which maximizes the
proportion of changes that are nonsynonymous in one gene and
synonymous in the overlapping genes. Krakauer [4]suggested
that overlapping genes in evolvable phases have an adaptive
advantage over overlapping genes in less evolvable phases, since
they allow for higher degrees of independent evolution. Therefore, he predicted a positive correlation between the frequency
of an overlap phase and its evolvability [4]. Indeed, Rogozin et
al. [12]found that among opposite-strand overlaps in bacteria,
the least constrained overlap phase (phase 1) was the most
abundant. This result was later questioned by Kingsford et al.
[13]who used a similar approach to ours. In the case of samestrand overlaps, phase-1 and phase-2 overlaps have equal
degree of evolvability [4]. The reason is that from the point of
view of one gene, there is an equivalence of overlap phase. For
example, if gene A overlaps gene B on the same strand in phase
1, than gene B overlaps gene A in phase 2. Therefore, phase-1
and phase-2 overlaps are predicted by this model to occur at
equal frequencies. Since our data shows unequal frequencies of
phase 1 and phase 2, evolvability does not seem to play an
important role in the evolution of same-strand overlapping
genes.
Reviewer's report 3
Review by Mikhail Gelfand, Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Information Transfer Problems

1) It is common knowledge that in many cases it is much
more difficult to prove a negative result than a positive
one. Thus, the authors have set themselves a hard problem: to show that the frequencies of gene pairs overlapping in different frames can be explained by simple
consideration of amino acid frequencies and codon usage
and do not require more complicated evolutionary explanation.
Author's response
Any scientific explanation should make as few assumptions as
possible. We provided an explanation for the phase bias in
same-strand overlapping genes that is simpler than previous
ones and does not invoke selection for phase of overlap. A more
complicated model will only be required if it can explain significantly more of the variation in the observed data than our simple model. In this case, the more complex model (i.e., that
overlap phase frequency is determined by selective constraints)
fails to explain the data and can, therefore, be discarded.

2) While the point is well taken and the approach clearly
interesting, there still seem to be some technical issues
that have not been addressed. Of course, the main problem plaguing all large-scale genome analysis projects is
reliance on existing annotations: one may find himself
studying idiosyncrasies of annotation software rather than
biologically relevant features. For some analyses the
authors exclude genes annotated as hypothetical, but this
does not guarantee that gene starts have been predicted
correctly.
Author's response
Annotation errors are a major concern in any computational
analysis. Our approach of using a subset of genes for which
there is higher confidence in the annotation is common in the
literature in general, as well as in studies that deal with overlapping genes (e.g., [11].).

3) At that, it is noteworthy that all non-trivial observations have been made for 5'-extensions, but not 3'-extension: it is fairly easy to mispredict the start codon (some
annotation projects routinely consider the most distal
codon to serve as the start), but not the stop codon.
I do not see an easy way out of this difficulty. One possible
control is to consider separately overlaps caused by 5'most start codons for the downstream gene (open reading
frame) and internal start codons.
Author's response
Our observations on 5'-extensions are not based on the annotation of start codons, but on the observed frequency of start
codons in phase 1 and phase 2 of coding sequences. This difference in the frequency of start codons explains the difference in
the frequency of long same-strand overlapping genes.

4) Another approach is much more time-consuming, but
it might provide interesting biological insight per se. The
authors state that overlaps are caused by mutations in
either start or stop codons. For the stop codons this
should be not very difficult to trace to these mutations to
specific branches of the evolutionary tree. Then the entire
analysis might be repeated for the overlaps where the
causing mutation is known. It is likely that it would seriously decrease the sample size, but it would also make the
sample much more reliable. In particular, one might consider separately established overlaps persisting for some
time and very recent overlaps caused by species-specific
mutations (or, for that matter, sequencing errors).
With start codons it might be more difficult. Indeed, one
has to consider separately two types of mutations. One is
the loss of a pre-existing start codon, and this can be
treated in a manner similar to the one when stops are considered. A useful addition would be considering separately cases where there are candidate start codons
upstream (in the previous reading frame, either on the
same strand, or the complementary strand) and when
candidate start codons can be found within the gene
whose original start codon is mutated. The second type of
mutations is gain of function, that is, emergence of a new
functional upstream start codon. However, in this case it
would be very difficult to prove by purely computational
means that the new start really functions.
There are also other possibilities for a more detailed analysis. A common problem for all of them is that they
require considerable effort to prove a rather simple point,
and thus it is not clear whether they are worth pursuing.
Author's response
We agree that a phylogenetic approach may be beneficial.
Unfortunately, the phylogenetic topology of bacteria is unresolved, so that a phylogenetic approach may introduce a new
source of error into the analyses.

5) Another important problem is, however, necessary to
be addressed, as it clearly lies in the framework of the suggested approach. The point is, for a new upstream codon
to be functional, it needs to occur in the same open reading frame as the old one, that is, there should be no stop
codons in the region between the new and old starts. Since
the frequency of candidate stop codons is not the same in
the two shifted reading phases of the upstream gene, this
might influence the general conclusions made in the
paper. It looks like the authors have something like that in
mind when they write about "stronger purifying selection" in long extensions, but this point is never quantified, and the applied term looks somewhat misleading
and inviting further criticisms: if there is stronger purifying selection, one should observe decrease in the substitu-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/36

tion rate in the longer-overlap regions compared to
shorter-overlap ones – is this the case?
Author's response
Dr. Gelfand wrote: "Since the frequency of candidate stop
codons is not the same in the two shifted reading phases of the
upstream gene, this might influence the general conclusions
made in the paper." However, as shown in Figure 4, there is no
significant difference between the frequencies of stop codons in
the two phases, while the frequency of start codons in phase 1
is significantly higher than that of phase 2. Regarding the
stronger purifying selection in long extensions, we have clearly
failed to convey the idea. All we meant was to convey the common-sense assumption that in molecular evolution "big
changes" are selected against more frequently and more stringently than "small changes." The strength of the negative selection is expected to be positively correlated with the length of the
extension following the obliteration of a stop codon.

6) Background, second paragraph: "Overlaps in the same
frame are rare": that depends on how one quantifies it;
gene fusions do not seem to be very rare in bacterial
genomes, especially conserved with long overlaps.
Author's response
In our dataset, there are 187 phase-0 same-strand overlaps
(0.26%). One reason for the paucity may be that in phase-0
same-strand overlaps, stop codons should be unstable or subjected to readthrough. Another reason may be the one raised by
Dr. Gelfand, i.e., the ease with which gene fusion occurs in bacteria.

7) Results, first paragraph: It might be interesting to learn
more about 18 non-standard start codons yielding short
phase-1 overlaps. Are they functional? Are they conserved? Are they regulatory?
Author's response
True. However, these might be also a result of annotation or
sequencing errors.

8) Discussion, fifth paragraph: One of the reasons for relative scarcity of 3'-extensions might be that many bacterial
genes contain tandem stop codons. This has been ascribed
to avoidance of translational readthrough, but an evolutionary consequence is that mutation in one stop codon
from a tandem pair does not create overlapping genes.
Author's response
There is no relative scarcity of 3'-extensions. In fact, the rate of
accumulation and degradation of overlapping pairs is higher for
overlaps caused by mutation at the 3'-end of the upstream gene
compared to overlaps caused by mutation at the 5'-end of the
downstream gene [9].

9) Discussion, sixth paragraph: Correlation between the
GC-content and the frequency of stop codons in frames 1
and 2 does not prove the absence of selection for such
stop codons: one needs to demonstrate that the number
of observed stops coincides with the number of expected
ones, while controlling for dependencies between adjacent codons.

16.

Author's response
Given that AT-rich genomes have, on average, five times more
frame-shift stop codons than GC-rich genomes, we believe that
the impact of selection on frame-shift stop codon frequency
should be small compared to the impact of the mutation pattern
that affects composition.
