Abstract
Background: Mobile genetic elements comprise a substantial fraction of vertebrate genomes.
These genes are considered to be deleterious, and in vertebrates they are usually inactive. High
throughput sequencing of salmonid fish cDNA libraries has revealed a large number of transposons,
which remain transcribed despite inactivation of translation. This article reports on the structure
and potential role of these genes.
Results: A search of EST showed the ratio of transcribed transposons in salmonid fish (i.e., 0.5%
of all unique cDNA sequences) to be 2.4–32 times greater than in other vertebrate species, and
68% of these genes belonged to the Tc1-family of DNA transposons. A phylogenetic analysis of
reading frames indicate repeated transposition of distantly related genes into the fish genome over
protracted intervals of evolutionary time. Several copies of two new DNA transposons were
cloned. These copies showed relatively little divergence (11.4% and 1.9%). The latter gene was
transcribed at a high level in rainbow trout tissues, and was present in genomes of many
phylogenetically remote fish species. A comparison of synonymous and non-synonymous
divergence revealed remnants of divergent evolution in the younger gene, while the older gene
evolved in a neutral mode. From a 1.2 MB fragment of genomic DNA, the salmonid genome
contains approximately 105 Tc1-like sequences, the major fraction of which is not transcribed. Our
microarray studies showed that transcription of rainbow trout transposons is activated by external
stimuli, such as toxicity, stress and bacterial antigens. The expression profiles of Tc1-like
transposons gave a strong correlation (r2 = 0.63–0.88) with a group of genes implicated in defense
response, signal transduction and regulation of transcription.
Conclusion: Salmonid genomes contain a large quantity of transcribed mobile genetic elements.
Divergent or neutral evolution within genomes and lateral transmission can account for the
diversity and sustained persistence of Tc1-like transposons in lower vertebrates. A small part of
transposons remain transcribed and their transcription is enhanced by responses to acute
conditions.

Background
A large fraction of repetitive sequences originate in

eukaryotic genomes from mobile genetic elements
(MGEs), which are grouped into 2 classes. Class I

transposons require mRNA intermediates, whereas class II
elements transpose directly as DNA. Tc1-like class II transposons, named after the founder gene in Caenorhabditis
elegans, are probably the most widespread MGEs in
nature, and are found in fungi, plant ciliates, nematodes,
arthropods, fish, amphibians and mammals (reviewed in
[1]). These genes contain a single reading frame that
encodes for the enzyme transposase, which is flanked
with terminal inverted repeating units. Transposition of
class II MGEs is characterized by limited requirements for
host cellular factors, which can account for their remarkable ability to undergo horizontal transfer across great taxonomic distances [2]. MGEs are regarded as parasitic
genes, and proliferation is deleterious for the host. Therefore, transposition is commonly followed by inactivation.
MGEs could play an important role in the evolution of teleost fish, and comprise a substantial fraction of their
genome. Multiple copies of Tc1-like transposons were
found in several fish species from different orders [3-6],
however transcription of teleost Tc1-like genes has not
been documented. Recent high-throughput sequencing of
salmonid cDNA libraries has revealed surprisingly large
number of transposon transcripts. Most if not all these
sequences contain incapacitating mutations in the reading frames, and can be regarded as transcribed pseudogenes or null-alleles. At present, rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
TIGR Gene Indices [7] contain 50773 and 31341 unique
cDNA sequences, respectively among which we found several hundreds MGE, Tc1-like genes being most abundant.
This wealth of sequence information provides insight into
the structure and evolution of transposons. We also
cloned several copies of two rainbow trout Tc1-like genes
with complete reading frames, which adds to understanding the transposon life cycle. Multiple gene expression
analyses with high-density cDNA microarray indicate

stimulation of rainbow trout transposons transcription in
response to stress, toxicity and pathogens.

Results
In order to search for transcribed transposons in salmonid
fish, we compared the unique cDNA sequences from TIGR
gene indices with 262 metazoan transposon proteins
retrieved from Swissprot. Blastx found matches in 273
rainbow trout and 163 Atlantic salmon sequences at a cutoff value e < 10-20 (Table 1). The ratio of transposons to all
cDNA sequences in salmonids was 2.35–31.6 times
greater than in other vertebrate species with available gene
indices, and a large fraction (68.3%) showed similarity to
11 proteins of the Tc1 family. Tc1-like transcripts were
found in the gene indices of 4 other teleost fish species
and in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, but not in
higher vertebrates. To estimate an approximate number of
Tc1-like genes, 6 genomic clones of Atlantic salmon were
analyzed, covering 1.2 MB [Genbank:AC148723, GenGenbank:AC148779,
Genbank:AC149099,
bank:AC148618, Genbank:AC148617 and AC148616],
and a blastx search found 56 matches at a cutoff value of
10-20. The size of the haploid Atlantic salmon genome is
equal to 3 billion base pairs. Assuming a relatively
homogenous distribution of Tc1-transposons, about
140,000 copies can be expected, which is 3 orders of magnitude greater than the number of Tc1-like sequences in
the salmonid fish gene indices. It is necessary to note that
TIGR contigs are produced by automatic assembly of EST
sequences that have at least 95% homology in overlaps of
minimum units of 40 base pairs [8]. Therefore, transcripts
of recently diverged transposon copies could be merged
unless they were flanked by differing 5'- and 3'-untranslated sequences. The numbers of transcribed transposons
can be greater than the number estimated by searching
across gene indices, but it is likely that only a minor fraction of salmonid Tc1-like genes is active.

Most Tc1-like sequences from the rainbow trout gene
index contained incomplete reading frames. To analyse
the structural relatedness of these genes, we used 38 fragments, which encode at least 170 amino acids at the C-termini. Thus, 31 sequences were from the TIGR database
plus 7 more were produced in this study (i.e., newly identified genes named Glan and Barb [Genbank: AY880883AY880888]). The maximum likelihood (ML) tree consisted of 3 single genes and 11 clades, containing 2 to 5
sequences (Figure 1). Seven clades (I-VII) could be
regarded as a part of the multi gene family, as sequence
identity with the nearest neighbors was in the range of
35–73%; the remaining 4 clades were highly divergent.
Only 1 of 6 clades containing more than 3 genes (X in Figure 1) was split into clusters supported by high bootstrap
values. The highest sequence identity were observed for
Glan and Barb. However, divergence within other clades
could in theory be overestimated, due to forced assembly
of similar transcripts.
Sequencing of complete reading frames for 3 copies of
Glan and 4 copies of Barb allowed for the study of transposons molecular evolution within the rainbow trout
genome. All 7 sequences include incapacitating mutations, which prevent translation of transposase. Barb copies have diverged up to 11.4 ± 1.4% (mean ± SD) and
accumulation of deletions (Figure 2) impeded reconstruction of the ancestral protein. Low divergence of Glan copies (1.9 ± 0.8%) suggest relatively recent transposition
into the rainbow trout genome. The consensus sequence
of 3 reading frames was identical to TIGR contig
[TGI:TC46394], which encoded a protein with characteristic features of Tc1-like transposase, such as the presence
of domains required for nuclear localization, DNA binding, cleavage and joining and DDE motif found in the catalytic units of diverse MGEs and retroviruses (Figure 3).
Noteworthy of mention is that all transcripts of Glan contained mutations that prevented translation of transposase, however the consensus contig sequence that was
assembled from a large number of EST from different
cDNA libraries appeared intact. Given that the rate of
spontaneous mutations in vertebrate germ cell lines is
~10-5 [9], transposition of Glan could have taken place as
recently as only a few thousand years ago. We also performed PCR screen of this gene in fish from inland reservoirs of Finland, where it was detected in 17 species from
different orders (Table 2). Interestingly, three of the four
species in which Glan was not found (grayling, whitefish
and vendace) are more closely related to rainbow trout
than most of those species carrying this gene. Low divergence of copies and discontinuous distribution are evidence for horizontal transmission. We analysed the rates
of synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitutions in newly identified rainbow trout transposons using
a sequence of the nearest Swissprot protein (hypothetical

transposase of plaice, with 77% homology [Genbank:CAB51372]) as a reference (Table 3). With respect to
this transposase, the Ks/Ka ratio was high and significantly greater in the younger gene (4.85 ± 0.30 in Glan
and 3.35 ± 0.04 in Barb). A comparison of copies indicated a probability of divergent evolution in Glan (Ks/Ka
= 0.69 ± 0.05). In Barb the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions approached unity (Ks/Ka =
1.03 ± 0.12), which is consistent with the protracted accumulation of mutations in a solely neutral mode.
We did not find sequences of any other known proteins in
the salmonid Tc1-like contigs and probably transposons
are transcribed from own promoters. Evidence for regulation of transposon transcription rate was produced in
microarray analyses. We used a platform designed for
studies of responses to environmental stress, toxicity and
pathogens in salmonid fish [10,11]. Overall this platform
included more than 1300 genes, 7 of which were similar
to Tc1-like transposons. Five transposons showed marked
differential expression in response to external stimuli,
such as handling stress, exposure to toxic compounds and
injection of cortisol or bacterial antigens; the microarray
results were confirmed with real-time qPCR. A consensus
profile of transposons correlated with those of 27 protein
coding genes in 35 microarray experiments (Pearson r2 >
0.63); examples are presented in Figure 4. The highest correlation (r2 > 0.8) was shown by classical markers of cellular stress, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, MAP

kinase 13 and hypoxia inducible factor. We also searched
for enrichment of Gene Ontology [12] categories in this
list of genes. Significant over-representation was demonstrated by functional classes that are implicated in protective reactions to acute conditions (i.e., response to stress
and oxidative stress, defense and humoral immune
response, receptors and regulators of transcription, Table
4).

Discussion
Having a large number of transposons and a preponderance of Tc1-like genes is a characteristic feature of salmonid genomes [3-5]. Sequence analysis of the transcribed
genes (Figure 1) suggested repeated transpositions at protracted intervals. A wide distribution of Tc1 transposons is
believed to account for the limited requirements in the
host cellular factors. Sleeping Beauty, an artificially reconstructed salmon transposon [13] is capable of integration
into genomes of a wide range of vertebrate species, however different efficiencies observed in various cell lines
point to possible involvement of the recipient's proteins
in transposition [14]. This is in line with a wide, though
limited, distribution of homologs for the transcribed salmonid DNA transposons, which have not been found
among EST of warm-blood vertebrates. The variety of salmonid Tc1-like genes is truly remarkable. Phylogenetic
analyses of 38 sequences, encoding homologous fragments of C-termini, found 14 distinct types of Tc1-like
genes and the real number of different genes is probably
much greater. Our search was based on the similarity
between proteins that were available from Swissprot, and

many transposons could remain unidentified due to the
lack of known homologs. Furthermore, the rapid decay of
transposons could impede the discovery of ancient transposed genes.
Despite the wide spread occurrence of Tc1-like transposons in vertebrates, not a single active gene has been
identified to date [14]. Inactivation of salmonid DNA
transposons could take place within a relatively short
period of time after transmission. Cloning of 2 transposons having a relatively low divergence rate indicates
the rapid accumulation of incapacitating mutations, such
as insertions or deletions, shifts of reading frames and premature stop codons (Figure 2). Analysis of synonymous
and non-synonymous substitutions suggest that inactivation of younger transposon could be preceded by selective
divergence within a limited period of time, whilst evolution of the older gene appeared entirely neutral. Results
from a study on recent transpositions in insects from four
different orders suggest that selective constraints operate
exclusively by horizontal gene transfer [15]. A comparison
of rainbow trout genes with Tc1-like transposon from
plaice confirm the conservation of functionally important
domains in distantly related proteins, which is gradually
obscured during the course of neutral evolution (Ks/Ka
ratios in the younger Glan and older Barb genes are 4.85
± 0.31 and 3.35 ± 0.04 respectively).
Silencing of transposons takes place at the transcriptional
or post-transcriptional levels [16], and both of these
mechanisms could act in salmonid fish. Based on fre-

quency in a 1.2 MB gene fragment, we can assume that
Tc1-like genes comprise nearly 5% of the Atlantic salmon
genome and only a minor fraction preserved transcription
after inactivation of translation. A survey of salmonid EST
found untranslated transposons in both sense and antisense polarities, which is the main prerequisite for the formation of double-stranded RNA. RNA interference

(RNAi) is implicated in the control of transposition in
germ cell lines of the nematode C. elegans [17], and existence of an RNAi pathway in rainbow trout was recently
demonstrated [18]. Suppression of intact transposases
with mutant genes was also reported in insects, and this
control mechanism is referred to as dominant-negative
complementation [19].

Given efficient protection against transposition in animals, the tenacity and variety of transposons may seem
surprising. Sustained persistence of transposons can, in
theory, account for their residence in unknown reservoir
species; e.g, the role of parasites as potential vectors of
horizontal transfer across phylogenetically remote organisms has been hypothesized [20]. However this can hardly
explain the remarkable diversity of these genes. The ML
tree (Figure 1) suggests that at each transposition event,
the rainbow trout genome was invaded with a new transposon, although several genes could have a common
ancestor. If expression of translated genes is under control
of RNAi, successful recurring transposition of identical or
highly similar genes appears unlikely. Hence, the combination of neutral or divergent evolution within a genome
with transfer across phylogenetic boundaries can be the
most efficient strategy for the survival and diversification
of transposons. PCR screen detected Glan in genomes of
many fish species from phylogenetically remote taxonomic groups (Table 2). Clades I-VII of the ML tree (Figure 1) can correspond to genes that evolved
independently. However it is also possible that descendants of a founder gene has returned several times into the
rainbow trout genome, after passage through a chain of
co-evolutionary hosts.
Results of our microarray studies suggested that a large
fraction of transcribed Tc1-genes can be stimulated under
acute conditions, but it remains unclear whether or not
the transposon transcripts have any functional importance. In theory, they can be transcribed from cryptic promoters, which are activated by the remodelling of
chromatin. However, input from stress-responsive promoters is also plausible. Transcripts can be required for
the control of transposition through RNAi, however such
explanation appears unlikely for highly mutated genes
that were probably silenced long ago in evolutionary
time. Currently, there is a growing body of evidence to
support the involvement of non-coding RNA into the regulation of gene expression at different levels. The role of
small and large RNA in modification of the chromatin
structure was reviewed recently [21-23]. Stress-induced
transcription of short interspersed repeated sequences
(SINE) was reported in human, mouse and silkworm [2427]; and SINE transcripts were shown to enhance translation of reporter genes [28,29]. Stress also activates the
transcription of satellite III repeat [30]. Because this large
non-coding RNA is consistently associated with chromatin, it can be required for the protection of sensitive
regions from stress-induced damage. Synthetic doublestranded RNA enhances the expression of anti-viral proteins in salmonid fish [31,32] and, in theory, endogenous
dsRNA can mimic a viral infection by launching protective
reactions.

Tc1-like transposons are co-regulated with a group of
genes that are implicated in the defense response, signal
transduction and regulation of transcription. In this
respect, it is noteworthy to mention that Tc1-like fragments reside in a number of immune and stress-related
salmonid genes, such as the non-classical MHC class I
antigen [Genbank:AF091779, Genbank:AF091780],
immunoglobulin heavy chain, IgD [Genbank:AF141605,
Genbank:AF278717], inducible nitric oxide synthase
iNOS/NOS2 [Genbank:AJ295231] and aryl hydrocarbon
receptor 2b, AhR2 [Genbank:AY463929]. Multiple copies
of Glan in sense and anti-sense polarity are found in rainbow trout MHC class Ia [Genbank: AB162342.1] and b
[AB162343.1] regions, in the vicinity of genes encoding
the complement proteasome subunit and several MHCI
loci. Modulation of gene expression that was due to the
insertion of transposons has been documented in many
studies (reviewed in [33]), and involvement of dispersed
repeated sequences into the co-ordination of gene expression with similar functions was hypothesized more than
three decades ago [34]. The role of transposon transcripts
in the regulation of gene expression was recently discovered in yeast [35], where the induction of an RNAidependent silent chromatin configuration resulted in
reduced transcription of several meiotic genes. A possible
involvement of transposon transcripts in the regulation of
gene expression in salmonid fish remains to be studied.

Conclusion
Information produced by the sequencing of salmonid fish
cDNA libraries and identification of recently transmitted
transposons provide new insights into the structure, diversity and molecular evolution and life cycle of mobile
genetic elements. High expression levels in rainbow trout
tissues and marked responses to external stimuli indicate
potential functional roles of transposon pseudogenes,
which requires further investigation. These genes can be
used as sensitive molecular biomarkers of acute conditions in salmonid fish.

Methods
Sequence analyses
The expressed transposons were analysed in rainbow trout
and Atlantic salmon TIGR Gene indices, and sequence
comparison was conduced with stand-alone blast [36].
Multiple sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW [37] and the conserved protein domains were
searched in Interpro [38]. Synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in newly cloned genes were determined by Dnasp [39]. Maximum Likelihood (ML)
phylogenetic analyses were performed with Phylip [40].

The fish samples were collected from inland reservoirs in
Finland, and DNA from fin clips was prepared with salt
extraction [41]. In brief, fin samples were digested at 60°C
in 440 µl of buffer (1.8 mM EDTA, 9 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8;
1.8% SDS) containing 160 µg of proteinase K. After addition of 300 µl of 6 M NaCl, lysates were centrifuged at
12,000 g for 30 min. DNA in the supernatants was precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% aqueous ethanol and dissolved in water. The 654-base fragments of
Glan PCR were amplified using the Hot Master Taq kit
(Eppendorf). Primers (5'-TGAAGAATCGACAACAAGTGGGACA-3' and 5'-GCTTTCTTCTTGCCACTCTTCCATA3') were annealed to templates at 68°C.

Abbreviations
MGE – mobile genetic element; ML – maximum
likelihood.

Microarray analyses
Fish experiments, design of the rainbow trout cDNA
microarray, hybridization protocol and data analyses are
described in detail elsewhere [10,11]. In brief, the platform included 1,300 genes printed in 6 replicates each.
The dye swap design was used; each sample containing
RNA from 4 individuals was hybridized to slides with
reverse assignment of fluorescent dyes (Cy3- and Cy5dCTP from Amersham Pharmacia). Labels were incorporated at the stage of cDNA synthesis. The measurements in
spots were filtered by criteria I/B ≥ 3 and (I-B)/(SI+SB) ≥
0.6, where I and B were the mean signal and background
intensities, respectively, and SI, SB were the standard deviations. Lowess normalization was performed and differential expression was analysed with the Student's t-test (p
< 0.01). The genes were ranked by the log(p-level).
