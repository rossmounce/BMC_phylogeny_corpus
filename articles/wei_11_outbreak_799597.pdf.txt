Abstract
Background: In 2010, an outbreak of coxsackievirus A6 (CA6) hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) occurred in
Taiwan and some patients presented with onychomadesis and desquamation following HFMD. Therefore, we
performed an epidemiological and molecular investigation to elucidate the characteristics of this outbreak.
Methods: Patients who had HFMD with positive enterovirus isolation results were enrolled. We performed a
telephone interview with enrolled patients or their caregivers to collect information concerning symptoms,
treatments, the presence of desquamation, and the presence of nail abnormalities. The serotypes of the enterovirus
isolates were determined using indirect immunofluorescence assays. The VP1 gene was sequenced and the
phylogenetic tree for the current CA6 strains in 2010, 52 previous CA6 strains isolated in Taiwan from 1998 through
2009, along with 8 reference sequences from other countries was constructed using the neighbor-joining
command in MEGA software.
Results: Of the 130 patients with laboratory-confirmed CA6 infection, some patients with CA6 infection also had
eruptions around the perioral area (28, 22%), the trunk and/or the neck (39, 30%) and generalized skin eruptions (6,
5%) in addition to the typical presentation of skin eruptions on the hands, feet, and mouths. Sixty-six (51%) CA6
patients experienced desquamation of palms and soles after the infection episode and 48 (37%) CA6 patients
developed onychomadesis, which only occurred in 7 (5%) of 145 cases with non-CA6 enterovirus infection (p <
0.001). The sequences of viral protein 1 of CA6 in 2010 differ from those found in Taiwan before 2010, but are
similar to those found in patients in Finland in 2008.
Conclusions: HFMD patients with CA6 infection experienced symptoms targeting a broader spectrum of skin sites
and more profound tissue destruction, i.e., desquamation and nail abnormalities.

Background
Since 2000, there have been sporadic reports of associations between hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)
and occurrences of onychomadesis [1-9]. Onychomadesis results from nail matrix arrest and both fingernails
and toenails may be involved. The nail abnormalities
associated with HFMD manifest with Beau’s line,

defined as transverse ridging of the nail plate, or onychomadesis, defined as nail separation from the nail
matrix, which may extend distally to the proximal portion of the nail bed. Despite reports in the literature,
however, evidence of the associations between HFMD
and nail abnormalities remains limited.
Following a major enterovirus 71 (EV71) epidemic in
1998, a virology reference laboratories network was
established by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control
(TCDC) to monitor the trends of viral infections in Taiwan [10,11]. In 2010, ten clinical virology laboratories
were qualified to be regional virology reference

laboratories by the TCDC. Physicians in public health
centers, clinics or hospitals were eligible to submit clinical samples of patients with respiratory tract infection
or enterovirus infection to contracted laboratories
nearby for laboratory diagnosis. For each specimen from
a patient with suspected enterovirus infection, virus isolation and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) specific for enterovirus type 71
was performed in a contracted laboratory. In addition to
notifying the clinical physicians, the test results were
stored and maintained in a digital network database.
The virus isolates were transported to and preserved in
the TCDC’s central biological materials bank.
In 2010, physicians in Taiwan noticed an outbreak of
onychomadesis. Most of the involved patients had
HFMD prior to the onset of the nail abnormalities (Figure 1). The patients with HFMD also presented with
skin eruptions at unusual skin sites. Therefore, we performed an epidemiological and molecular investigation
to elucidate the characteristics of this outbreak.

Methods
Patients diagnosed with HFMD with positive enterovirus
isolation results in the virology reference laboratories
network database from July through December, 2010
were eligible for analysis in the study. Demographic
data, including gender and age, and the virus isolation
information were obtained from the virology reference
laboratories network database. After obtaining approval
from the Institutional Review Board of the TCDC and
informed consent for participation in the study from the
patients or their guardians, we performed a telephone
interview with eligible patients or their caregivers to collect information concerning symptoms, treatments, the
presence of desquamation within 2 weeks of the HFMD
episode, and the presence of nail abnormalities within 8
weeks of the HFMD episode. Nail abnormalities
included Beau’s line, defined as transverse ridging of the
nail plate, or onychomadesis, defined as nail separation
starting at the matrix, which may extend distally to the
proximal portion of the nail bed.

Figure 1 A 2-year-5-month-old boy experienced prominent skin eruptions and vesicles on his buttocks (a). A 2-year-6-month-old boy
had fingernail abnormalities 3 weeks after hand, foot, and mouth disease (b). Another 4-year-old boy presented with desquamation on his feet
1 week after the CA6 infection episode (c); he developed nail shedding on his right index finger in the following weeks (d) and recovered
gradually.

The serotypes of the enterovirus isolates were determined using an in-house indirect immunofluorescence
assay (IFA) kit [12] and a commercial IFA kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA). For the sequencing of the VP1 (viral protein 1) gene, viral RNA was
extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Santa Clara, CA). One-step RT-PCR of the VP1 gene
was performed as described previously [13]. The products were confirmed by agarose electrophoresis and
were then sequenced using a BigDye Terminator Ready
Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit and an automated
sequencer ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). Obtained sequences were compared with
reference EV sequences in GenBank using BLAST [14]
and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. All sequences
were prepared and aligned by BioEdit (version 7.0.9.0)
with the Clustal W program [15]. The phylogenetic tree
for the current CA6 strains in 2010, 52 previous CA6
strains isolated in Taiwan from 1998 through 2009,
along with 8 reference sequences from other countries
was constructed using the neighbor-joining command in
MEGA software (version 4) in order to perform bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replications [16].
Stata software, version 10 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas, USA), was used for statistical analyses. The
Fisher’s exact test or chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney U test
was used to compare continuous variables. A p value of
less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
From July through December of 2010, a total of 398
patients diagnosed with HFMD with positive enterovirus
isolation results in the virology reference laboratories database were selected. Among the 398 patients, 275 patients
(69%) completed the telephone interview and were
enrolled in the analysis. Enterovirus was isolated from the

Page 3 of 6

pharyngeal swabs of 274 patients and the rectal swab of 1
patient. Of the 275 patients, 252 (92%) of the patients’ specimens were submitted within 3 days of clinical presentation (median duration, 1 day; range, 0 to 8 days).
CA6 was isolated from the clinical specimens in 130
patients. The enterovirus types of the other 145 patients
included CA16 (110; 76%), CA5 (13; 9%), CA4 (5; 3%),
EV71 (4; 3%), CA2 (3; 2%), CB5 (3; 2%), echovirus 4 (3;
2%), non-typable enterovirus (3; 2%) and echovirus 30
(1; 1%). Table 1 shows the demographic information
and clinical symptoms of patients infected with CA6
and non-CA6 enterovirus. No significant differences
existed between the CA6 and non-CA6 groups in terms
of age and gender distribution. Patients that contracted
CA6 were more frequently hospitalized, but none of
these patients were treated in an intensive care unit. All
the 275 patients recovered without complications.
In addition to the typical presentations of skin eruptions on the hands, feet and mouth, some patients with
CA6 infection also had eruptions around the perioral
area (28, 22%), the trunk and/or the neck (39, 30%). Six
(5%) patients with CA6 infection experienced generalized skin eruptions. Sixty-six (51%) patients with CA 6
infection experienced desquamation of the palms and
soles after the infection episode. Nail abnormalities were
found in 48 (37%) of the 130 patients with CA6 infection. All 48 patients denied a past history of major systemic disease or nail trauma in the 8 weeks prior to the
onset of the nail abnormalities. Among the 48 patients
with nail abnormalities, 33 (69%) also had desquamation
before or during the presentation of the nail abnormalities; presentation of nail abnormalities was significantly
associated with the presentation of desquamation (p =
0.002). The median age of the 48 patients with nail
abnormalities was 2 years old (range, 0-34 years).
Among the 48 patients, 34 (71%) remembered the
details of nail abnormalities. The average number of

involved digits was six (range, 1-20) and the most common involved digit was the right thumb (24/34, 71%).
Only 7 (5%) of 145 cases with non-CA6 enterovirus
infection, including 4 cases caused by CA 16, 2 cases
caused by EV 71, and 1 case caused by echovirus 30,
experienced nail abnormalities after the HFMD episode.
CA6 infection was significantly associated with developing nail abnormalities (p < 0.001).
Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the partial VP1
nucleotide sequence, the CA6 strains, except the prototype strain Gdula, were divided into two clades (Figure
2). Clade I was comprised of the 52 strains isolated
from 1998 through 2009 in Taiwan, while clade II was
comprised of the 123 strains isolated from the Taiwanese patients in 2010 and the 7 strains isolated from
Finnish patients in 2008. Within clade II, the VP1
sequences of the isolates from the Taiwanese patients in
2010 were 92.8% to 96.8% identical to those from the
Finnish patients in 2008.

Discussion
The results of his study suggest that the onychomadesis
epidemic which occurred in Taiwan was significantly
associated with the HFMD caused by the CA6 infection.
In addition to onychomadesis, our study found that
HFMD patients with CA6 infection presented with
more widespread skin lesions and more profound tissue
destruction. The CA6 strains circulating in 2010 differed
from those circulating before 2010, not only in terms of
clinical manifestations, but also in the genetic sequences
of the VP1 genes.
The fact that HFMD patients with CA6 infection had
more widespread skin lesions also explains the difference in the percentage of nail abnormalities in CA6 and
non-CA6 HFMD cases. Expanded skin site involvement
in our study indicated a broad spectrum of direct cell
infection by the CA6 virus. Onychomadesis is a painless,
non-inflammatory nail change that is idiopathic or
results from a wide range of systemic diseases or drug
exposures [17]. The mechanism of onychomadesis in
our study remains unclear. It has been speculated that
onychomadesis occurs secondary to inflammation of the
nail matrix or maceration associated finger blisters [7].
In the outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease
(HFMD) which occurred in Finland in 2008, in which
onychomadesis was a common symptom, Osterback et
al. detected CA6 in shed nail fragments of a patient who
had onychomadesis following a HFMD episode by using
RT-PCR and suggested that CA6 virus replication
damaged the nail matrix, resulting in onychomadesis
[8]. Although direct evidence of a viral infection in the
nail matrix was not obtained, our study adds to the
mounting evidence of a causal relationship between
CA6 HFMD and nail abnormalities.

In addition to CA6 infection, we found that some
patients with echovirus 30, EV71, and CA16 infection
also experienced nail abnormalities. In an onychomadesis outbreak in Spain, Davia et al. found that several
serotypes of enteroviruses, such as coxsackieviruses A5,
A6, A16, B1, B3, echoviruses 3, 4, and 9, and enterovirus
71, may cause onychomadesis, in addition to the major
enterovirus serotype, coxsackievirus A10, and concluded
that more than one enterovirus serotype was implicated
in the nail matrix arrest outbreak [5]. Our study supports this observation. However, there were no reports
of nail abnormalities associated with the aforementioned
enterovirus serotypes in Taiwan. Whether or not
another enterovirus serotype, other than CA6, is associated with nail changes warrants further investigation.
The validity of virus isolation results was crucial to the
study. Specimens obtained from skin blisters were the
most appropriate for microbiological studies for HFMD.
The majority of the specimens were obtained from
pharyngeal swabs and we took the specimens within 3
days of HFMD onset. Although the results of the pharyngeal swabs did not provide direct evidence of a causal
relationship, we believe that there is a high degree of
association between CA6 and HFMD.
There are several limitations to this study. Recall bias
of enrolled patients may exist because of the telephone
interview. The gap period between the telephone interview, which was carried out in early 2011, and the
HFMD episode may have been as long as 8 months, and
the enrolled patients may not have been able to accurately describe the details of onychomadesis or the skin
sites involved. In addition, the prevalence of the nail
changes may have been underestimated due to patients’
unawareness of them. Since the nail changes associated
with HFMD are generally painless, the presence of nail
changes may not have drawn the attention of the
patients.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the onychomadesis epidemic following
the HFMD episodes was primarily associated with an
outbreak of CA6 infection in 2010. CA6 infections
attacked a broader spectrum of skin sites and caused
more profound tissue damage. The VP1 gene sequences
of the CA6 strains isolated from Taiwanese patients
show a high degree of similarity with those isolated
from Finnish patients in 2008, but differ from those previously circulating in Taiwan from 1998 through 2009.
Consent section
Informed consent for participation in the study was
obtained from the patients or their guardians. Consent
to publish the images in Figure 1 was obtained from the
parents of the patients.
