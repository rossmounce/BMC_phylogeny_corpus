Abstract
Background: Multiple sequence alignment algorithms are very important tools in molecular
biology today. Accurate alignment of proteins is central to several areas such as homology
modelling, docking studies, understanding evolutionary trends and study of structure-function
relationships. In recent times, improvement of existing progressing programs and implementation
of new iterative algorithms have made a significant change in this field.
Results: We report an alignment algorithm that combines progressive dynamic algorithm, local
substructure alignment and iterative refinement to achieve an improved, user-interactive tool.
Large-scale benchmarking studies show that this FMALIGN server produces alignments that, aside
from preservation of functional and structural conservation, have accuracy comparable to other
popular multiple alignment programs.
Conclusions: The FMALIGN server allows the user to fix conserved regions in equivalent position
in the alignment thereby reducing the chance of global misalignment to a great extent. FMALIGN
is available at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/FMALIGN/Home.html

Background
The advent of large genome projects has led to an explosion of sequence data in public databases. Analysis of protein families, understanding their evolutionary trends and
detection of remote homologues are now the primary
objectives. Genome annotation and analysis tools like
fold prediction, homology modelling, protein-ligand
docking and clustering algorithms rely heavily on accurate
multiple alignments to provide a genome-wide
perspective.

The most popular approach for multiple sequence alignment has been the progressive alignment method [1]. A
multiple alignment is built up gradually by aligning the
closest sequences first and successively adding in more
distant relatives. A number of alignment programs imply
this algorithm, for example MULTALIGN [2], MULTAL [3]
and CLUSTALX [4]. They employ a global alignment algorithm to construct an alignment over the entire length of
the sequences and differ mainly in the procedure
employed to determine the order of alignment of the
sequences. The most common usage is the sequential

branching method to identify two closest sequences first
and subsequently align the next closest sequence to those
already aligned. MULTALIGN [2] constructs a guided tree
using UPGMA [5] method. A consensus method is then
used to align larger and larger groups of sequences according to the branching order of the tree. CLUSTALX uses the
alternative neighbour-joining algorithm [6] to construct
the tree. In contrast to the above global method, PIMA [7]
uses a local dynamic programming algorithm to align
only the most conserved motifs. In addition, numerous
new alignment algorithms have recently been developed
which offer fresh approaches to the multiple alignment
problem. A common point of interest has been the appli-

cation of iterative strategies to refine and improve the initial alignment. A local alignment approach is
implemented in the DIALIGN program [8,9] to construct
multiple alignments based on segment-to-segment comparison rather than residue-to-residue comparison using
an iterative strategy to improve alignment accuracy. Alignment programs like MATCH-BOX [10] utilize statistical
similarity measures to delineate sequentially conserved
regions and the final alignments are derived by those of
the conserved "box" regions. The regions outside the

"boxes" are not aligned. METAMEME [11] is a motif based
search engine that aligns motif regions found in the target
sequences. DbClustal [12] combines the advantages of
both local and global alignment algorithm in a traditional
tree-based progressive alignment. Starting from ClustalW
[22], which is a global alignment program, local alignment data or anchor points are incorporated in the dataset. The global alignment is then weighted towards, but
not constrained, to the locally conserved segments and
the alignment is not subject to iterative refinements.
MACAW [13] provides a user interactive interface to select
conserved segments from the alignment but these segments are not utilized further to refine the resulting
alignment.
In this paper, we present an alignment algorithm that
combines the properties of both progressive alignment
methods and iterative refinement algorithms. This algorithm offers the user the selective advantage of guiding the
course of alignment by simultaneous inputs of multiple
conserved motif regions that in turn guarantees retention
of structure/function in the final alignment. FMALIGN is
an alignment server that provides the user to obtain a con-

trol over the alignment by providing important conserved
regions as input to the alignment program to achieve a
more structurally relevant and functionally useful alignment of protein sequences. It employs the sequential
branching method to identify the closest pair of sequences
and subsequently includes the next closest sequences to
generate a guided tree using UPGMA [5], which in turn
dictates the sequential order of the alignment. FMALIGN
also considers the local similarity of the sequences in the
conserved motif regions; as the name implies, it allows
local conserved regions of the sequences to be fixed and
aligns the rest based on normal progressive alignment.
The chances of global misalignment are thereby reduced
and the possibility of obtaining overall better alignment is
increased. The FMALIGN server also offers an iterative
refinement option where a routine (FINDMOTIF) identifies more conserved regions in the derived alignment and
allows the user to provide fresh 'equivalences' to obtain an
overall better alignment. Benchmarking studies on difficult alignments, examined in BAliBASE [14], show promising prospect for the FMALIGN server to be an useful
alignment algorithm.

Implementation: methodology and description of
FMALIGN server
The algorithm of FMALIGN (Fixed Motif ALIGNment)
program combines three main criteria: (a) Progressive global alignment method, (b) substructure (local) conserved
region fixation and (c) iterative refinement of alignment
with identification of more conserved regions. The procedure involves three steps: (i) identification and fixing of
the specified sequential conserved regions. This alignment
method requires specific regions of the sequences to be
aligned as anchor and these anchors are generally meant
for sequentially conserved parts which do not undergo
many changes. (ii) derivation of the progressive multiple
sequence alignment guided by the tree. During this step,
excluding the fixed anchored regions, the rest of the
sequences are divided into several sub-segments that are
aligned employing a dynamic alignment algorithm in a
sequential order from N to C-terminus. The phylogenetic
guide tree has been derived using Unweighted Pair Group
Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) [5] which is the
simplest method of tree construction. The UPGMA
method was adopted since the whole length of the protein
is divided into several segments considering them as ultrametric After all the sub-segment alignments are per-

formed, the aligned parts as well as the selected, fixed
motif regions are combined to produce the full-length
alignment for a group of proteins under the hierarchical
cluster. This process continues until all the protein
sequences are aligned multiply. (iii) The iterative refinement of alignment subsequent to the identification of
more motifs. In this step, more conserved regions are
identified by observing the amino acid exchanges in the
resultant alignment derived from the previous iteration.
These conserved regions are then used as anchors together
with previously identified motifs and the whole process is
repeated until an optimal alignment having maximum
number of conserved regions and alignment score is
obtained. The algorithm thus combines the progressive
dynamic algorithm for global multiple alignment and
selected conserved regions or local alignments. Once the
primary alignment is derived, the second step can be
repeated by including more conserved regions from this
alignment as motifs to derive a better alignment. Figure 1
shows a cartoon representation of the methods in a flowchart diagram.
FMALIGN server can accept amino acid patterns for multiple motifs provided by the user. It also provides option

to the user to search motifs within their sequences using
FINDMOTIF routine or to obtain them for the alignment
by providing a link to SMoS [15], a structural motif database for aligned protein superfamilies. The FINDMOTIF
routine in the server provides sequential conserved
regions for a set of proteins on the basis of sequence similarity and a 20 × 20 substitution matrix by consulting
large number of structure-based sequence alignments of
homologous families [16]. Amino acid exchange scores at
every alignment position are assigned the same as the element in this matrix for all possible pairs of proteins and
averaged over the number of pairs. Contiguous alignment
positions with an average amino acid exchange score over
50 (for homologues) or 40 (for superfamilies) are recognised as motifs. FMALIGN also offers an option for the
user to refine the derived alignment by generating more
sequential conserved regions through FINDMOTIF
option. The inter-motif regions are aligned by normal progressive alignment using standard substitution matrices
like BLOSUM62. The gap penalties used in this version of
FMALIGN are all maintained according to standard multiple alignment parameters.

Alignment scores
To assess the performance of FMALIGN in comparison to
other programs, Sum-of-Pair-score (SPS) and ColumnScore (CS) alignment scoring scheme [14] are applied on
FMALIGN derived alignments to assess the quality of
alignments compared to BAliBASE reference alignments.
SPS and CS are calculated such that the score increases
with the number of sequences aligned accurately and is
used to determine the extent to which the programs succeed in aligning some, if not all, of the sequences in an
alignment correctly [14]. The scores used to measure the
performance of the various alignment programs may not
be appropriate for all the datasets. Therefore, for each reference test the most suitable scoring function have been
selected according to the nature of the benchmarking.

Results and discussion
Benchmarking at family level
FMALIGN derived alignments retain high degree of conservation in secondary structures. Six members from the
globin family were selected comprising a wide range of
sequence identity between them (7% to 61%). Conserved
regions for six aligned globin sequences were identified by
the FINDMOTIF routine starting from CLUSTALX [4]

alignment with default parameters and aligned by the
FMALIGN server. The resultant alignment shows high
degree of secondary structural conservation despite the
difficulty of aligning a set of sequences having very wide
range of sequence identity (Figure 2).
In order to evaluate the FMALIGN server, the results have
been compared with 10 other alignment programs and
objective criteria were employed to assess the quality of an
alignment. We selected the BAliBASE benchmark alignment database [14] to compare the performance of the
FMALIGN alignment server. The BAliBASE benchmark
alignment database contains 142 reference alignments,
divided into five reference sets each containing at least 12
representative alignments. Performance of FMALIGN is
checked on all five reference sets provided in BAliBASE
datasets.
Reference 1 alignments consist of a small number of equidistant sequences of similar length, i.e. the percent residue
identity (% ID) between any two sequences is within a
specified range and no large extensions or insertions have
been introduced.

Reference 2 contains alignments of a family of closely
related sequences with >25% ID, plus up to three 'orphan'
sequences (distant members of the family with <20% ID,
sharing a common fold). It is designed to evaluate program accuracy according to two criteria: (i) the stability of
the family alignment when orphans are introduced into
the sequence set and (ii)the quality of the alignment of
the orphan sequences.
Reference 3 checks the ability of the programs to correctly
align equidistant divergent families into a single alignment. The reference alignments consist of up to four families, with <25% ID between any two sequences from
different families.
Reference 4 and 5 contain alignments of upto 20
sequences including N/C-terminal extensions (upto 400
residues) and insertions (upto 100 residues), respectively.
Reference 1: a small number of approximately equidistant sequences
This dataset is designed to study the effect of sequence
length and percentage identity on the performance of the
alignment program and provides a basis for the remaining
tests. The overall performance of FMALIGN server for this

dataset is comparable to the two best performing alignment programs, like PRRP [17] and CLUSTALX [4], in all
three categories (VI, V2, and V3) based on sequence identity and alignment lengths (short, medium and long) as
shown in Figure 3, 4, 5.
Reference 2: a related family with divergent, orphan sequences
It is possible to assess the performance of the methods to
align divergent 'orphan' sequences (10–20% ID with the
family and between orphans) with a family of highly
related (>25% ID) sequences using this data set. It is also
interesting to observe the disruption of the family alignment due to the introduction of orphans. Figure 6 shows
SPS for the alignment of a single orphan against a closely
related family. The global alignment programs again perform better than the local ones in this test. However,
CLUSTALX and SAGA [18] now rank above PRRP. The
performance of FMALIGN server is significantly better
than other programs for all the three length categories.
Reference 3: families of related sequences
This allows the assessment of the programs to correctly
align approximately equidistant divergent families (<20%

ID) composed of highly related sequences (>25% ID) into
a single multiple alignment. Figure 7 shows the scores for
the programs in the order. The iterative strategies of PRRP
[17] and SAGA [18] perform better in this test than the traditional progressive alignment methods. However, FMALIGN performs better than the other progressive methods,
with the global methods generally ranking higher than the
local methods.
Reference 4: N/C-terminal extensions
This dataset includes large N/C-terminal extensions to
investigate whether the programs are capable of aligning
the core blocks flanking the extensions. No large internal
insertions are introduced at this stage. Mostly local
alignment strategies out-perform the global methods.
PILEUP (Wisconsin Package v.8; Genetics Computer
Group, Madison, WI) is the only program based on a global alignment method which does reasonably well compared to other global methods. Performance of FMALIGN
is comparable to the best three methods (DIALIGN [8],
SB_PIMA [19] and PILEUP) as shown in Figure 8.

Comparison of alignment accuracy on the basis of sequence similarity.
Figure 9
Comparison of alignment accuracy on the basis of sequence similarity. Conserved motifs are identified for superfamilies like,
Cytochromes (code: 02.01.050), ACP-like (02.01.060), C2 domain (Calcium/lipid-binding domain, CaLB) (code: 02.02.027), ISP
domain (code: 02.02.058), Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (code: 02.03.018), Esterase/acetylhydrolase
(02.03.054), Chromo domain-like (code: 02.04.010) and BPTI-like (02.07.023). These motifs are utilized to realign the
sequences by FMALIGN. Alignments are scored using sequence similarity scores based on a 20x20 substitution matrix. FMALIGN derived alignments are compared against CLUSTALX [4] and sequence-structure alignment, COMPARER [21].

Reference 5: internal insertions
In contrast to reference 4, in this dataset the insertions are
internal to the homologous domains and not at the N/Cterminus as overhangs. FMALIGN also performs well in
this category and results are comparable to the other better performing global alignment methods like PRRP and
CLUSTALX as shown in Figure 8.
Benchmarking at superfamily level
Utilization of structural motifs to improve alignment accuracy
The performance of FMALIGN has been tested on a dataset of representative superfamilies of proteins belonging
to different structural classes in PASS2 [20] and SMoS [15]
databases. The structural motifs from the SMoS database
have been utilized as conserved regions for the member of
the superfamily (average sequence identity less than
30%). All the proteins of a superfamily have been aligned.
Each alignment is assigned a quality score by averaging
the amino acid exchange score of each column over the
length of the alignment (see method for details). The
alignments derived from FMALIGN have been compared
against the CLUSTALX-derived sequence alignment as
well as the sequence-structure alignment derived from
COMPARER [21]. Figure 9 shows an equivalent or better
accuracy of the FMALIGN server compared to CLUSTALX

and COMPARER-derived alignment. This indicates that
FMALIGN is particularly efficient for specific sets of
sequences for which the degree of conservation is known.
The initial results also indicate that FMALIGN can perform very well and provide an alignment which is very
similar or better than a structurally derived alignment.
Utilization of sequence motifs to improve alignment accuracy
Representative superfamily alignments belonging to different structural classes from the PASS2 [20] superfamily
alignment database are taken for a benchmarking test
(Table 1). These superfamily alignments are of different
lengths (short, medium, and long) and possess an average
sequence identity that ranges from 10% to 26%. Sequential conserved regions or motifs are identified for each
superfamily alignment and utilized in the FMALIGN
server to realign the superfamily members. Similarly, the
superfamily members are also aligned by the two best performing multiple alignment methods, CLUSTALW [22]
and T-Coffee [23]. These alignments are then compared
against the structure-based COMPARER alignments provided by PASS2 database using the same alignment scoring scheme (Sum-of-Pair score) of the BAliBASE
benchmarking database. FMALIGN-derived alignments

performed better for most of the cases compared to the
other two methods as shown in Figure 10.

Conclusions
FMALIGN server provides a web interface for pairwise and
multiple sequence alignments of proteins. FMALIGN provides an alignment by combining progressive dynamic
algorithm, local substructure alignment and iterative
refinement presenting an improved, user interactive alignment procedure. FMALIGN server allows the user to fix
conserved regions in equivalent positions amongst the
sequences to be aligned leading to alignments that are
reliable and biologically more meaningful. Additional
options for the users to choose substitution matrices and
gap penalty values may be incorporated in future.
All the alignments provided in BAliBASE are realigned by
FMALIGN and the resulting scores (both SPS and CS) are
calculated using a standard program kindly provided by
the authors of BAliBASE. The inter-motif regions are
aligned in FMALIGN by normal progressive alignment
using standard substitution matrices like BLOSUM62. The
gap penalties used in this version of FMALIGN are all
maintained according to standard multiple alignment

parameters. Benchmarking at the superfamily level has
also been done utilizing both structural and sequential
conserved regions. The dataset is wide enough to include
proteins from different structural classes and of different
length. The average sequence identity for this dataset was
less than 30% since the proteins are related at the superfamily level. The performance of FMALIGN has been
tested against one of the best performing multiple
sequence alignment (T-Coffee) as well as structure based
alignment tool (COMPARER). Studies on large and different datasets revealed an overall better performance of
FMALIGN server for all categories in BAliBASE benchmarking database. It works especially well at lower
sequence identity range, such as superfamily level, where
no two proteins are more than 25% identical to each other
in comparison to other popular methods like CLUSTALX
and T-Coffee. It is well-known that automatic multiple
sequence alignments at poor sequence identity are often
subject to careful manual validations and improvements
to avoid offsets of critical functionally important residues.
FMALIGN can sensitively address this issue to avoid manual intervention subsequent to final alignment. FMALIGN-derived alignments also show a high conservation
of secondary structural elements and provide better align-

ments for comparative modelling. The implementation of
this alignment algorithm can be used to include new
members into an existing protein superfamily with the
help of motif regions that provide a reliable approach to
connect protein sequences with their structural homologues within a particular superfamily. FMALIGN is available via the following URL http://caps.ncbs.res.in/
