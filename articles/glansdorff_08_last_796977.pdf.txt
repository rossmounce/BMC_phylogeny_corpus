Abstract
Background: Since the reclassification of all life forms in three Domains (Archaea, Bacteria,
Eukarya), the identity of their alleged forerunner (Last Universal Common Ancestor or LUCA) has
been the subject of extensive controversies: progenote or already complex organism, prokaryote
or protoeukaryote, thermophile or mesophile, product of a protracted progression from simple
replicators to complex cells or born in the cradle of "catalytically closed" entities? We present a
critical survey of the topic and suggest a scenario.
Results: LUCA does not appear to have been a simple, primitive, hyperthermophilic prokaryote
but rather a complex community of protoeukaryotes with a RNA genome, adapted to a broad
range of moderate temperatures, genetically redundant, morphologically and metabolically diverse.
LUCA's genetic redundancy predicts loss of paralogous gene copies in divergent lineages to be a
significant source of phylogenetic anomalies, i.e. instances where a protein tree departs from the
SSU-rRNA genealogy; consequently, horizontal gene transfer may not have the rampant character
assumed by many. Examining membrane lipids suggest LUCA had sn1,2 ester fatty acid lipids from
which Archaea emerged from the outset as thermophilic by "thermoreduction," with a new type
of membrane, composed of sn2,3 ether isoprenoid lipids; this occurred without major enzymatic
reconversion. Bacteria emerged by reductive evolution from LUCA and some lineages further
acquired extreme thermophily by convergent evolution. This scenario is compatible with the
hypothesis that the RNA to DNA transition resulted from different viral invasions as proposed by
Forterre. Beyond the controversy opposing "replication first" to metabolism first", the predictive
arguments of theories on "catalytic closure" or "compositional heredity" heavily weigh in favour of
LUCA's ancestors having emerged as complex, self-replicating entities from which a genetic code
arose under natural selection.
Conclusion: Life was born complex and the LUCA displayed that heritage. It had the "body "of a
mesophilic eukaryote well before maturing by endosymbiosis into an organism adapted to an
atmosphere rich in oxygen. Abundant indications suggest reductive evolution of this complex and
heterogeneous entity towards the "prokaryotic" Domains Archaea and Bacteria. The word
"prokaryote" should be abandoned because epistemologically unsound.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Anthony Poole, Patrick Forterre, and Nicolas Galtier.

Background
Most biologists subscribe to Darwin's notion of an ancestor common to all living forms and so subscribe to its corollary, the existence of a Tree of Life [1]. Those who do not
[2,3] may have exaggerated the occurrence of horizontal
gene transfer by minimizing alternative interpretations, as
discussed further. Since the ground-breaking discovery
that every known living organism belongs to one of the
three Domains, Bacteria, Archaea or Eukarya [4,5], the
notion has given rise to the concept of Last Common
Ancestor [6] or, according to Kyrpides et al. [7] and Lazcano and Forterre [8], of Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), an acronym that combines the previous
notion with that of the Universal Ancestor [9] and is
sometimes used for Last Universal Cellular Ancestor [10].
There is however a wide variety of opinions regarding the
cellular status (prokaryotic or not), homogeneity and
complexity of this entity (the "community" concept [9]),
depending on assumptions made on its mode of emergence, metabolic evolution and the nature of its genetic
material. In particular, whether the progenote [4] -i.e. a
primeval biological ancestor with a still rudimentary genotype-phenotype relationship and a RNA genome made
of numerous minichomosomes – evolved into a LUCA
still endowed with a RNA genome, or whether LUCA had
already attained a later stage of evolution, with a RNA/
DNA or DNA as genetic material, remains a matter of
debate [[11-15] and below]. Moreover, to some authors,
the LUCA is the direct ancestor of Bacteria and Archaea
only, Eukarya being the product of some merging process
between them [16-24]. Furthermore, recent developments
concerning the origin of viruses and their possible role in
evolution have opened new perspectives on the emergence and genetic legacy of LUCA [11,12].
The diversity of opinions concerning LUCA is in constant
evolution and, new facts and ideas have been brought to
attention in the last few years, These developments necessitate major adjustments in our approach; this is the subject of this paper. We focus on issues related to the cellular
nature of the LUCA, its phylogenetic relationships, metabolic status, genetic redundancy and, last but not least, the
question of how its predecessors emerged already complex. We certainly feel the need for a synthesis rather for
than protracted polemics between entrenched visions. In
our present state of knowledge, discussions about the origin of life and the status of LUCA remain largely theoretical; their value therefore is judged mainly by their
explanatory power.

Inadequacy of the term prokaryote
We have become used to deal with biological organization in the frame of a fundamental distinction between
two types of organisms: the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes. This dual partition of the living world has lost much

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

of its appeal with the discovery of the three Domains [5]
and it has been proposed recently that the term "prokaryote" should be dropped altogether in favour of
"microbes" [25]. Martin and Koonin [26] rightly pointed
out the inadequacy of the term "microbes" and argued to
maintain a "positive definition of prokaryotes" based on
transcription-coupled RNA translation, (TT coupling) in
keeping with the lack of a nucleus. However, this definition also is brought into question since the momentous
discovery of a nucleus-like structure in some Planctomycetes, with a double membrane and pores [27]. Moreover,
Poribacteria and some Archaea-like or ganisms also feature DNA-enclosing compartments [27]. It is not known
whether TT coupling also applies in these organisms so
that the validity of such a definition awaits confirmation.
Nevertheless there are other reasons to relegate the term
"prokaryote" to the historical record: (i) the prefix "pro"
inappropriately suggests anteriority; (ii) this notion of
anteriority of prokaryotes is usually associated with a very
common prejudice in favour of an overall directionality in
evolution, i.e. from the simple to the complex (a Lamarckian heritage) and, (iii) Bacteria branch off at the lowest
position in a popular version of the tree of life [5]. As a
result, it is often taken as a matter of course that LUCA
must have been "something like a bacterium" and that
many eukaryotic attributes evolved by gradual complexification, a notion whose inherent difficulties, however
considerable, are often ignored [28-31] and has no compelling basis as a biological principle [32,33]. Indeed,
what has increased in the course of evolution is order and
its corollary, organization [34], complexity being a rather
ill-defined and intuitive concept, except in the very
abstract Rosennean definition of being "non-simulable",
i.e. Turing incomputable, and in the objective, functional
and molecular definitions referred to in the forelast section[35,36]. For example, a biofilm may be more complex
than the simplest metazoans but is considerably less
ordered. Organismal complexity, when it arises, is contingent on order.
What are the facts and the logic that we can use as a guide
to discuss the nature of LUCA, its emergence and its legacy?

Phylogeny of the three Domains. Proposed
anciennity of protoeukaryotes
Rooting the tree of life: what does it mean?
The rooting of the universal SSU-rRNA tree in the bacterial
branch by Woese et al [5] rests on the phylogenetic analysis of paralogous proteins [37,38]; it has been seriously
questioned. Forterre, Philippe and coworkers [10,39-41]
and Caetano-Anolles [42,43] even suggested a root in the
eukaryotic branch. This conclusion was rejected as a statistical artifact on the basis that eukaryotes cannot be older
than prokaryotes since the former originated by endosym-

biosis [22]. This rather trivial criticism however overlooks
the notion that LUCA could have been a protoeukaryote, i.e.
an ancestor to the cell line that captured the symbionts, an
entity well distinct from Bacteria and Archaea. However,
and most importantly the exact branching order has no
bearing on the actual cellular architecture of the LUCA; a
root in the eukaryotic branch would of course provide
support for the notion of a protoeukaryotic LUCA but
whichever would have branched off first, Bacteria [44] or
Archaea [45], the LUCA could indeed have been a protoeukaryote announcing true Eukarya in many important
respects, including critical properties of their membrane
and cytoskeleton, and intron splicing.
Reductive evolution
According to this view, explicitly advocated by a few
authors [28,29,43,46-50], both Bacteria and Archaea are
the product of reductive evolution, "streamlining", to
revive a notion first presented in the wake of the discovery
of introns [51,52]. As a matter of fact, it is usually not
appreciated that there is no evidence that Bacteria and
Archaea originated from anything that would deserve to
be called a "prokaryote" in the current meaning of that
word. It is interesting to note here the convergence
between evolutionary thinking about animal phyla and
lower organisms: just as a protoeukaryotic LUCA could be
a rather complex but for ever lost intermediary state, and
"prokaryotes" simplified evolutionary products, the Urbilateria (forerunners of bilateral animals) could have been
vanished "elaborate ancestors" whereas flatworms and
nematodes, once seen as ancestral because simple, are
now regarded as "secondary simplified" or "degenerate"
[33].

In line with the streamlining notion for the emergence of
prokaryotes, and at a time the structure of the tree suggested that the earliest forms of life were extreme thermophilic Bacteria and Archaea, Forterre [46] proposed
that the reductive evolution at the origin of Bacteria and
Archaea had consisted in the "thermoreduction" of a non
thermophilic LUCA. Before long however, doubts began
to emerge on the thermophilic nature of the bacterial
ancestor and Forterre [53] noted that certain bacterial features of thermoadaptation (particularly lipids) looked
analogous, not homologous. More recent considerations
on phylogeny and on the evolution of biological membranes indeed suggest that, contrary to Archaea, Bacteria
emerged as non thermophilic descendants of the LUCA
and that extreme thermophilic Bacteria arose by convergent evolution [[48] and below: Origin of Thermophily
and Biological Membranes].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

and/or Bacteria consider that spliceosomal introns may
have descended from type II introns present in one of the
fusion partners [24,54]. However, to quote Delaye et al.
[13], "there is no conclusive evidence that intron selfsplicing and ribozyme-mediated RNA processing are truly
primordial activities". Since the emergence of the complex
spliceosome probably required a long period of time and
since Collins and Penny [55] found evidence suggesting
that an already complex spliceosome was present in the
ancestor of all modern eukaryotes, it appears reasonable
to infer its presence in a protoeukaryotic LUCA, from
which most introns (and the spliceosomal machinery)
would have been later lost in Archaea and Bacteria by
reductive evolution. If the progenote genome was made of
modules yet to be assembled into functional units,
introns would have played an essential role in the formation of early genes by exon shuffling [[56] and references
therein]; indeed, the gene-protein structure correlation
postulated by the exon shuffling theory appears stronger
in the subset of introns that are most likely to be ancient
[56].
A splicing machinery would therefore have become essential very early and constitute an ancient feature of the
LUCA that later might have facilitated coordination of
transcription and export of transcripts from the nucleus
[54]; the presence of a nuclear body in Planctomycetes
and perhaps other "prokaryotes" [27] suggests that this
evolution may already have been well advanced in the
LUCA population. Moreover if the α-proteobacterium
alleged to have been the precursor of mitochondria was
endowed with an active enough intron splicing machinery
to have impulsed a secondary wave of introns in a protoeukaryotic host, it could have been a microorganism
perhaps already engaged in the streamlining process, but
still closer to LUCA than its living descendants, so that
both the mitochondrial precursor and its host would have
used a spliceosomal machinery; as already stated above,
the latter would have disappeared during reductive evolution of the protoeukaryote towards modern "prokaryotes", leaving them with the spare amount of introns
actually found in Bacteria but also in Archaea (Methanosarcina). Actually, the fact that some introns have been
found in Archaea weakens the argument proposing that
eukaryotes emerged by fusion of a bacterium with an
archaeon and that this very fusion sparked an intron invasion in an alleged intron-free archaeal host [24,54,57].
However such invasions would be expected to occur in a
sexually outcrossing population [57,58] and some kind of
primitive sexuality could have been a feature of a protoeukaryotic LUCA about to engulf the mitochondrial ancestor
by phagocytosis [57,59].

Introns already in the progenote?

Eukaryotic gene promoters betray their progenotic origin
Eukaryotic gene promoters are essentially combinatorial
structures. They consist in complex arrays of binding sites
with defined specificities but susceptible of rearrangements without loss of function. This contrasts with their
bacterial and archaeal counterparts that are very compact
and not prone to rearrangements. We already suggested
[[29] and references therein] that a eukaryotic-like promoter structure would be easier to conceive as ancestral
than the converse because of its combinatorial potential
for further evolution; moreover the imprecision, flexibility and redundancy of the genetic organization likely to
have been inherited by LUCA from the progenote seems
more in keeping with the complexity expected for a protoeukaryotic than for a prokaryotic promoter. Finally, during the streamlining process that gave rise to Archaea and
Bacteria, another mechanism characteristic of these organisms may have evolved: the rRNA-mRNA interactions
required for translation of polycistronic mRNAs.

We think therefore, that the combinatorial and variable
structure of eukaryotic gene promoters suggests an ancestor with the type of loose, poorly organized genetic apparatus that would have been characteristic of the primitive
and modular progenote, rather than the extremely compact and indeed "streamlined" organization of control
and regulatory regions found in Bacteria and Archaea.
How old is the nucleus?
If LUCA had a RNA genome and DNA synthesis was
invented twice [11,60], we could consider the possibility
that a membraneous compartment (let us call it a protonucleus) had already formed autogenously around the
primeval RNA genome, so that the nucleus itself would
not necessarily have emerged twice independently. Such
compartmentation could very early have played a capital
role in protecting RNA, in ensuring its correct partition at
cell division and in separating replication and editing
from protein synthesis. An interesting model [61] suggests
that proteins of nuclear pores and coat vesicles (thus components of the endocytotic apparatus) could have been
formed endogenously from defined protein structural
modules. This model makes the emergence of the nucleus
much less of a mystery than before and links nucleogenesis to the emergence of phagocytosis (see further). Moreover, as pointed out by P. Forterre in his comments on this
paper, RNA "nuclei" still exist today since RNA viruses
recruit host membranes elements to form compartments
in which their replication apparatus is surrounded by one
or two membrane layers with an opercule for communication with the cytoplasm [62].

This notion of endogenous nucleogenesis, here applied to
a putative RNA protonucleus, contrasts with the hypothesis that the nucleus formed only once after engulfment of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

a crenarchaeal ancestor by a phagocytic "chronocyte", the
RNA prekaryotic LUCA proposed by Hartman et al.
[63,64]. In our view, the nucleus would have already
appeared in a RNA LUCA and the RNA to DNA transition
would have been the consequence of two independent
viral invasions of such cells as suggested by Forterre to
explain the differences found between the genes of DNA
metabolism in Bacteria and Archaea/Eukarya [[11,12,44]
and further].
The concept of a RNA LUCA has been criticized by Delaye
et al. [13] who argued that (i) the monophyletic origin of
ribonucleotide reductase (RNP) suggests a DNA LUCA;
the evolutionary history of RNPs remains however
unclear, making it difficult to establish the timing of the
emergence of the different RNP classes [14,44,65]; (ii)
fidelity of information transfer would have been an acute
problem for a large RNA genome; Poole and Logan [14]
however discussed evidence that high fidelity RNA replication and efficient proofreading could have been an
attribute of a RNA LUCA. Though the jury is still out, the
possibility of a RNA LUCA appears to have gained some
ground in the last few years.
It seems that, on the whole, the model of a protoeukaryotic RNA LUCA is in keeping with current evidence. In particular, the antiquity of an already complex spliceosomal
mechanism, appearing to have evolved before the last
ancestor of living eukaryotes, is not easy to reconcile with
eukaryogenesis by merging of prokaryotes. Rather, the
LUCA itself may have been that ancestor, already
endowed with the forerunner of the eukaryotic nucleus.
The occurrence of nucleus-like structures in some Planctomycetes, in Poribacteria (and perhaps some Archaea as
well [27] is a striking feature that must be accounted for in
evolutionary scenarios centered on LUCA. The possibility
of early endogenous nucleogenesis by a rather straightforward mechanism [61] places the origin of the Planctomycete nucleus in a new perspective. The nuclear body of
Gemmata, with its double membrane and its pores, is presently the closest approximation of a eukaryotic nucleus
outside of its traditional Domain. There may be a relationship between this eukaryotic-like structure and the capacity for sterol biosynthesis, a feature of Planctomycetes
[[66] and next section]. It is however not known whether
these structures are really homologous nor is it known
whether TT-coupling is the rule in this bacterial group;
moreover, there are ribosomes in both the cytoplasm and
in the Gemmata nuclear body. Is the Gemmata nucleus
homologous and ancestral to the eukaryotic one or does
it result from an independent event, indicating perhaps
that nucleogenesis was not a rare and unique event? The
fact that other Planctomycetes have less elaborate DNA
compartments may either suggest that the process of com-

completion, or indicate partial regression, leading in turn
to suggest that the regression has been completed in most
"prokaryotic lineages". These questions are presently
unresolved but make Planctomycetes a fascinating subject
for further investigations.

early time. Indeed, two other but rather distant bacterial
lineages, the Methylococcales and the Myxobacteria, also
contain sterol biosynthetic genes [66]. Considering the
great anciennity of this alleged horizontal gene transfer
(HGT), it is not unreasonable to suggest that the donor
may have been a protoeukaryote.

Palaeochemistry and chronology of early
eukaryote evolution

It is worth noting that Methylococcales and Myxobacteria
share with the Planctomycetes a number of features that
are atypical of most other Bacteria (intracellular membranes, unusual cell walls, complex reproductive strategies) and could indicate a relationship with a
protoeukaryotic LUCA that would be closer than for any
other living organism [27,72]. This is also supported by
the exceptionally high degree of scattering found among
functionally related genes in Pirulella (including a split
rRNA operon) as compared to most prokaryotes [75].
Moreover, Planctomycetes and the related Verrucobacteria make proteins homologous to those of the eukaryotic
cytoskeleton, such as integrin alpha-V, tubulin, actin and
dynamin that could very well be of protoeukaryotic rather
than prokaryotic origin [27,50,76]. It is still not clear
whether the Planctomycetes, that were suggested to represent the most ancient branch of the Bacteria [77], really
occupy this position [72,75,78,79] an issue that is notably
difficult to resolve since most bacterial phyla branch off at
a very deep level (see [27,50,80] and below, Thermophily
and the origin of bacterial membranes).

What independent indications are there that a eukaryotic
cell line, still at the protoeukaryotic stage, could be
ancient enough to qualify as LUCA? The chemical analysis
of 2.5–2.7 billion years old Archaean sedimentary rocks
(bitumens extracted from shales) found in the Pilbara
region of Western Australia has pushed the possible existence of organisms possessing membrane containing sterols as far back as that era [67] since a complex distribution
of steranes was discovered in those formations. At present,
however, the indigenous nature of the sterol biomarkers is
not fully established (see [68] for a discussion of the pros
and cons) so that the relevance of these dramatic observations to the origin of eukaryotes remains uncertain. However, other chemical indications (carbon isotopic
excursion of kerogens) indirectly point to the possible
existence of protoeukaryotic organisms older than 2.5 billion years [67,69]. This isotopic pattern indeed suggests
the occurrence of active methanogenesis, an archaean
metabolism; if Archaea and eukaryotes share a common
ancestor [5] – what in our view means if Archaea evolved
by thermoreduction from the protoeukaryote (see further) – the latter must be older still. A recent analysis
pushed the onset of methanogenesis as far back as 3.46
Gyr ago [70] but the interpretation of the data is contentious [71]. However, Chistoserdova et al. [72] demonstrated the presence of genes for C1 transfer reactions
linked to methanopterin and methanofuran in Planctomycetes; their phylogenetic analysis suggests this pathway
was very ancient (as much as 2.78 Gyr ago, [73,74]) possibly present in LUCA already. A favoured scenario suggests the genes remained in Planctomycetes,
Proteobacteria and Euryarchaea but were lost in most
known lineages [72].
Interestingly some Planctomycetes (Gemmata) were
shown to produce de novo lanosterol and its isomer
parkeol and to concentrate these substances in their double-membrane-bounded nuclear body [66]. This important observation places the interpretation of the
diagnostic value of ancient steranes in a novel perspective
since it suggests that Planctomycetes could have kept metabolic and morphological features of a protoeukaryotic
LUCA. Alternatively, the capacity to synthesize sterols
could have been acquired horizontally from a eukaryotic
lineage [66]; the authors of this suggestion emphasize
however that such a transfer must have occurred at a very

However, even conflicting views on the exact branching
order of the bacterial phyla still place the Planctomycetes
among the deepest branches, along with the Poribacteria,
another phylum of internally compartmentalized organisms [50,72,81]. No diagnostically eukaryotic fossils as
old as the Pilbara bitumen [67] have been discovered,
whereas contemporary or older bacteria-like fossilized
objects have been reported; the first diagnostically identifiable Cyanobacteria are approximately 2.1 billion year
old [82]. It is possible of course that the envelope of primeval eukaryotic precursors and other structures characteristic of eukaryotes were too fragile to have been
preserved in metamorphosed archaean rocks [82]. Cavallier-Smith [83,84] doubted the possibility to recognize
eukaryotic features in ancient fossils. This skepticism may
be unfounded however since careful studies of 1800–
1300 Ma fossils from Australian and Chinese formations,
thus of a much greater anciennity than the date proposed
by Cavallier-Smith for the emergence of eukaryotes (900
Ma ago), identify features strongly suggestive of eukaryotic morphology [82,85,86]. Moreover biomarkers
extracted from a 1.64 billion-year-old old formation
include steranes indicative of eukaryotes possessing
advanced sterol biosynthesis [87].

Eukaryogenesis by merging of prokaryotes or by
phagocytosis?
Models of fusion
The hypothesis of a protoeukaryotic LUCA ancestral to the
bacterial and archaeal Domains starkly contrasts with the
views [16-24] that regard the eukaryotic cell as the product
of a fusion or merger between one or several Bacteria, or
between Bacteria and an Archaeon. As noted by CaetanoAnolles [88], the "ring of life'[23] presented in support of
an origin of eukaryotes by fusion of Bacteria, can be
opened by assuming differential loss of genetic repertoires
and give rise to a tree where Bacteria and Archaea appear
as streamlined protoeukaryotes. However attractive the
merging scenarios may appear at first sight from the metabolic point of view, or to account for the origin of the
nucleus, they are not supported by available data
[31,63,89-93]; the phylogenetic analysis of several proteins, including glycolytic enzymes, of components of the
translation and transcription apparatuses and – more
recently, of fold superfamilies [90]- indeed point to the
existence of ancient eukaryote-specific proteins (ESP) and
to a common ancestor for the three Domains. The fusion
scenarios have little explanatory value in terms of
genomic organization and for the origin of ESP's
[31,94,95]. Furthermore, key proteins of the cytoskeleton
previously considered to have been eukaryotic innovations were found to have homologues in Bacteria (particularly Planctomycetes and Verrucobacteria [27]) and
Archaea [96]; they may have been inherited from a protoeukaryotic ancestor, perhaps much older than Bacteria
and Archaea [97] rather than attest of a prokaryotic origin
of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Similarly, the prokaryotic
V4 domain has been presented as the likely ancestor of a
key component of the eukaryotic vesicle transport system
[98], whereas a protoeukaryotic origin could also explain
the data. Likewise, the eukaryotic Ras superfamily was
recently found to have homologues in Bacteria and
Archaea; rather than suppose two independent prokaryotic origins followed by fusion between two such prokaryotes [99] one could assume their previous occurrence in
the protoeukaryotic LUCA. Moreover, as discussed by
Esser and Martin [100], current symbiotic models for the
origin of eukaryotes by fusion of prokaryotic cells do not
predict that genes from several bacterial groups (i.e. Spirochaetes and α-Proteobacteria) would contribute in a
major way to the common ancestor of eukaryotes; however, such a multiple inheritance pattern is precisely what
the hypothesis of a protoeukaryotic LUCA ancestral to
"prokaryotes" would predict.

Furthermore, but for one instance of a γ-Proteobacterium
living as endosymbiont within a β-Proteobacterium
[101], there are no documented endosymbiotic associations between prokaryotes. It is actually surprising that the
only mechanistic indication that bacteria might actually

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

fuse or merge (the discovery of zygogenesis among
Enterobacteriaceae by Gratia [[102,103] and ref therein] is
not mentioned by proponents of fusion models. However, the mechanism is unknown, as is the actual extent of
the phenomenon among bacterial groups; in our present
state of knowledge, it certainly cannot account for the capture of an archaeon by a bacterium, whereas it might possibly explain the above-mentioned β-γ proteobacterial
symbiosis [101]. When the fusion of an Archaeon with a
Bacterium is considered [19,21,22,24] another difficulty
is the incompatibility between glycerol membrane lipids
of different chirality (sn1,2 fatty acid lipids and sn2,3 isoprenoid lipids as summarized in Fig. 1) [104] except if
fusion actually involved engulfment, for which no precedent exists among prokaryotes; however, in that case, the
preferential elimination of one type of membrane inside
the host still requires an explanation. Besides, there are
archaeon symbionts multiplying in eukaryotic cells
[105,106] but no evidence was provided that they shed
their isoprenoid membrane to replace it by a fatty acid
one.
Wachtershauser [107,108] has proposed an ingenious
alternative to maintain the idea of eukaryotes resulting
from a merging process by assuming the latter took place
between wall-less bacterial cells and "pre-cells" still at the
LUCA stage, endowed with a racemic mixture of lipids
(sn1,2 and sn2,3) but happening to be enriched by spontaneous molecular segregation in the bacterial type of lipids. This hypothesis rests on the possibility that LUCA
would have been endowed for a significant period of time
with a membrane made of a racemic mixture of lipids, in
spite of their having a spontaneous tendency to segregate
from each other, an eventuality that we find difficult to
accept (see further Thermophily and the origin of biological membranes).
A seducing hypothesis: Phagocytosis
Most importantly, the fusion scenarios referred to above
underestimate the importance of phagocytosis; the
hypothesis of engulfment of an α-proteobacterium ancestor in the capacity of mitochondrial precursor by a phagocytic protoeukaryote has lost none of its appeal,
considering the well documented occurrence of prokaryotic endosymbiosis in eukaryotes [31,47,94,95,109,110].
Moreover, the most specifically articulated model of
eukaryogenesis by symbiosis between prokaryotes [24]
postulates a metabolic syntrophism based on hydrogen
transfer between a Myxobacterium and an Archaeon as prerequisite for actual engulfment of the Archaeon by the
Bacterium, followed by elimination of the archaeal membrane; this overlooks the fact that syntrophism based on
H2 transfer between a Bacterium and an Archaeon, as it
occurs in several microbial communities, does not need to

be stabilized by endosymbiosis and subsequent gene
transfer to the host genome in order to be efficient.
Endosymbiosis of methanogens within Protozoa -thus
within phagocytic eukaryotes- do occur but the internalized Archaea conserve their individuality and, presumably, their isoprenoid membrane as well [106]. The
mechanistically non-compelling nature of the endosymbiosis postulated by the proponents of this fusion model
contrasts with the requirements for successful endosymbiosis of the mitochondrial ancestor; this seems to have
been overlooked in criticisms of fusion models. Indeed, to
explain the origin of mitochondria, we need actual engulfment of the future symbiont within an organism already
endowed with a certain tolerance to O2, role postulated by
de Duve for peroxisomes, [[94,95] and references
therein].

Jekely [111,112] also discussed the implausibility of the
models assuming fusion between prokaryotes from the
point of view of membrane genesis and proposed that
protoeukaryotes originated in microbial biofilms as "selfish cheaters" having evolved into predators that eventually became phagotrophs; mitochondrial symbiosis is
seen as having triggered the formation of the nuclear compartment. In this model, the protoeukaryote originates
from a true prokaryote having lost its rigid cell wall and
developed endomembranes; in this respect it is reminiscent of Cavallier-Smith [83] hypothesis on the "neomuran" origin of eukaryotes. In spite of its prejudice in favour
of a "prokaryote-to-eukaryote" transition, Jekely's interesting model [112] also emphasizes the importance of
phagocytosis and proposes a plausible ecological context
for the emergence of this property before the onset of
endosymbiosis.

Phagocytosis thus remains an adequate mechanism to
explain how the engulfment of future endosymbionts
occurred. Hartman et al. [63,64], had already envisaged a
phagocytic RNA ancestor (the "chronocyte") as precursors
of eukaryotes; they proposed that the nucleus originated
from the absorption by the chronocyte of an ancestor of
the Crenarchaeotes with a DNA genome. This hypothesis
however does not explain the specific elimination of the
isoprenoid membrane from the engulfed Archaeon; it is
also at variance with the well-documented model presented by Devos et al [61] to explain the endogenous origin of the nucleus. We nevertheless feel that elements of
Hartman and Fedorov's scenario are particularly interesting to consider from two points of view:
(i) in Forterre's proposal [11,12] the RNA-DNA transition
would have occurred in the viral world and an RNA-LUCA
would have given rise to the three Domains as the result
of invasion by different cell lines of the LUCA population
by separate DNA viruses. This model, offered as an alternative to non homologous gene replacement, elegantly
explains the disparities observed between the bacterial
and archaeal/eukaryotic replication apparatuses. The
former version of the model envisaged three transitions,
one for each Domain, whereas recent in silico evidence
suggests only two RNA-DNA transitions took place since
the common ancestor to Archaea and Eukarya would
appear to have possessed a DNA genome already [44].
Note however that a recent phylogenetic analysis of tRNA
suggests the archaeal lineage may have been the most
ancient one; it would have been followed by viruses, then
by Eukarya and Bacteria [45]. Perhaps the evidence pointing to a DNA ancestor common to both Archaea and
Eukarya [44] indicates that the same or very similar DNA
viruses were responsible for the RNA-DNA transition in a
precursor of Archaea and Eukarya. At any rate, Forterre's
proposal on the primordial role of viruses in Domain genesis could concur with the hypothesis of a phagocytic
RNA-LUCA but without adopting the idea of a nuclear origin by phagocytosis.
If the nucleus of Gemmata and the eukaryotic nucleus were
homologous, it would at first sight be easier to conceive of
a DNA- than a RNA-LUCA, unless, however, the different
viral invasions involved in the emergence of the three
Domains occurred in cell lines already endowed with an
endogenous nuclear precursor, but still equipped with a
RNA genome, as proposed above. If the conjecture of a
phagocytic LUCA is correct, both Bacteria and Archaea
would have lost phagocytosis. It is however conceivable
that, in the LUCA community, phagocytic organisms
would have coexisted with non-phagocytic cells [31] that
might be the ancestors of what we call today "prokaryotes".

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

(ii) Hartman and Fedorov [63] insist on the selective value
of a membrane able to build up a proton motive force
which would have provided a determinant advantage to a
phagocytic protoeukaryotic ancestor with a eukaryotic
type of plasma membrane (perhaps an ancestor possessing peroxysomes already providing a certain protection
against oxygen [94,95]). Now, modern eukaryotic membranes are not completely devoid of electron carriers and
it is not known how the protoeukaryotic membrane
would have been equipped in this respect, but there is little doubt that it was the development of electron-transport systems of the prokaryotic type that ultimately made
efficient respiratory metabolism possible; therefore, the
phylogenetic indications obtained by Castresana ([113],
see below) that the last common ancestor already possessed proteins involved in respiratory electron transport
could be interpreted at least in part in terms of a heterogeneous ancestral community [9,31,114] containing cells
with plasma membranes already endowed with a certain
respiratory capacity, rather than a metabolically "omnipotent" LUCA.

Evolution of metabolism
A globally heterotrophic, and microaerobic LUCA
community
There are two basically different types of metabolism autotrophic and heterotrophic- and, consequently, two
opposite views for the origin of the first living cells; when
the generation of metabolic energy is taken into account,
these views are however not as irreconcilable as used to be
considered [115]. At any rate, LUCA was not an immediate descendant of these primeval cells and its metabolic
status is not expected to bear a direct relationship to their
origin. In its present state, and whatever the exact branching order of the three Domains, the universal tree of life,
with many deep-branching chemoorganotrophic types of
microorganisms, is not adverse to the notion of a heterotrophic LUCA (or to the presence of heterotrophs in a
LUCA community of diverse metabolic types). This contrasts with earlier emphasis on autotrophic (and hyperthermophilic) metabolism in alleged primeval cell lines at
a time the tree of life featured many such organisms close
to the root[116]. Actually, even if the primeval cells that
preceded the LUCA had been autotrophic, evolutionary
pressure from an environment containing organic substances, whether of living or still from prebiotic origin,
would have promoted the advent of heterotrophic cells. A
penetrating analysis of the phylogeny of gene families
involved in energetic metabolism [113] further suggests
that LUCA (or the LUCA community [9,114]) was
endowed with a wide spectrum of bioenergetic capacities,
including the paraphernalia of respiration and even a
superoxide dismutase [91]); oxygen may thus have
become an electron acceptor at a very early time, though
its concentration would have remained very low (but per-

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

haps already compatible with a micro- or nanoaerophilic
metabolism [94,113]) before the massive increase progressively brought about by oxygenic photosynthesis and
other processes [117]. It is usually assumed that oxygen is
necessary for sterol biosynthesis (oxidation of squalene)
but the possibility of an anaerobic pathway for squalene
biosynthesis should be kept in mind [118]. Should this be
the case, and despite indications for early participation of
oxygen in metabolism, the protoeukaryote could have
emerged in a totally anaerobic environment, perhaps still
at the progenote stage.
Gene content in a complex LUCA
A recent estimate of the minimal gene content of LUCA
based on whole-genome phylogenies identified over 1000
gene families (between 1144 and 1529 when eukaryotes
are included, [[91] and references therein]) with relatively
low numbers (<150) of Archaea/Bacteria specific families.
The results of this analysis contrasts with the notion of a
"minimal" genome based on essential genes [119] and
confirms the wide range of functional capabilities of
LUCA, including all major aspects of cellular life. The
study does not directly address the question of the root of
the universal tree but Ouzounis et al. [91] nevertheless
express their skepticism toward the notion of a bacterialike LUCA.

Thermophily and the origin of biological
membranes
Hyperthermophily and optimal temperature
Modern hyperthermophily appears to be an elaborated,
acquired trait [13,120,121] and it is possible that LUCA,
even if it were thermophilic, did not grow in the range of
temperatures characteristic of modern thermophiles. In
particular, the concept of "optimal temperature" (often
quoted in the following lines because often referred to in
the literature) may have sometimes misled people when
considering adaptation to high temperatures [50]. Pyrococcus furiosus appears to be in a dire metabolic state at its socalled "optimal" temperature of about 100°C (H. Markl,
personal communication cited in ref 50) and organisms
such as Thermotoga struggle to compensate increased proton permeability in their "optimal" temperature range by
an increased respiratory rate [122]. Therefore, the characteristics of modern hyperthermophiles probably reflect
later adaptations to transient exposures and perhaps competition with other organisms but not an optimal niche,
so that inferences made from modern hyperthermophiles
on the thermal profile of organisms living in the era of
LUCA may not be appropriate. The "optimum" effect
would be essentially kinetic but not reflect physiological
"comfort". Comparable observations have been made for
adaptation to cold [123,124].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

Moreover, according to Woese and Kandler [9,114], LUCA
was a promiscuous community of organisms diversified
to a certain extent in terms of physiology. As most organisms grow over a temperature range of 30 to 40 degrees,
we suggest that the LUCA community was not a population adapted to a particular temperature range but would
have consistently brought together cells with overlapping
temperature domains, thus enlarging the basis for further
evolution.
Defining the thermal profile of ancestors
Phylogeny
The thermal profile of LUCA remains a matter of debate
but the notion of a hyperthermophilic LUCA [116,125128] is not anymore as firmly supported as it once
appeared [29,48-50]. We will summarize the controversy
and discuss whether a provisional consensus appears possible. The thermal regimes to be considered are, respectively: hyperthermophilic (optimal growth temperature
(Topt) above 80°C, upper limit (Tmax) about 100°C),
extreme-thermophilic (Topt 70°C, Tmax 80°C), and
moderate-thermophilic (Topt 50°C, Tmax 70°C).

In contrast with earlier views presenting LUCA as hyperthermophilic, several recent phylogenetic analyses of the
Bacterial Domain suggest that Thermotogales and Aquificales, originally thought to represent the earliest branching
phyla in the bacterial Domain, may not occupy this position (see ref 79 for the opposite view). Analyses based on
conserved rRNA sequences [77], large number of genes
[129], DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRp) [130],
DdRp and other proteins [131], phylogenomic analyses of
families of orthologous genes (Sculo, Lespinet and
Labedan, unpublished) and other references in [49] gave
phylogenetic trees where extreme thermophiles appear on
secondary branches and members of the Planctomycetes/
Verrucobacteria/Spirochaetes superclade cluster close to
the root; the phylogeny of protein disulfide oxidoreductases [132] does not support a hyperthermophilic LUCA
either. Ciccarelli et al. [133] proposed Thermoanaerobacter,
a thermophilic Firmicute with a Topt of 75°C, as the earliest bacterial cell line; however this analysis diverges from
the well established phylogeny of Archaea [134,135] and
should therefore be regarded with caution. When reviewing the phylogeny of thermophiles, Lebedinsky et al [136]
noted that some of the early diverged but as yet uncultured bacterial lineages seem to be mesophilic by their GC
content or their habitat.
Because of the deep branching pattern of bacterial clades,
it is particularly difficult to establish a firm phylogenetic
profile of this Domain; it is therefore necessary to consider
other arguments to understand the evolution of thermophily.

Compositional and biochemical data
Di Giulio [125,127,128] used a « thermophily index » (TI)
based on the propensity of certain amino acids to be represented in thermophilic proteins, to correlate it with
Topt, in order to predict the thermal profile of the ancestor of each Domain and of LUCA itself. LUCA was estimated to have been thermophilic or hyperthermophilic.
Most of the data concern the signal recognition particle
(SRP); they are widely scattered and the prediction was
made [125] with a confidence interval of about 20°C;
moderate thermophiles like some Bacilli are at the lower
end of this range. Moreover, (i) correlations established
for other proteins gave lower estimates with even wider
intervals [125]; (ii) of the several estimates made with the
SRP protein for the ancestor of Eukaryotes (none of whom
grows above 62°C), most reach rather high values, that
would be typical of moderate thermophiles or thermotolerant mesophiles [126-128]. It is therefore possible that
thermal regimes were overestimated. This could occur if
the correlation between the TI of SRP and Topt was biased
towards higher temperatures.

(i) Ancestral protein sequences were reconstructed across
two alleged « competing bacterial phylogenies » in order
to assess the effects of topology on the ancestral phenotype. The bacterial phylogenies considered are admittedly
different but can hardly be considered as « competing »
from the point of view of thermalprofiles since both place
thermophilic bacteria at the root: either the extreme thermophile Thermoanaerobacter [133] or the hyperthermophile Thermotoga. [140]. Not surprisingly, the estimate
is lower in the first case (64.8°C) than in the second one
(73.3°C); the still lower estimate obtained from 31 protein families (61.4°C) was based on the first phylogeny. It
would have been interesting to choose a really « competing » phylogeny among the several ones that place nonthermophilic Bacteria at the root of the bacterial Domain.

Galtier et al. [137] predicted a mesophilic or at the most
moderately thermophilic LUCA from a statistical analysis
of rRNA base composition. These conclusions were criticized by Di Giulio [126] but nevertheless confirmed by
Galtier in a later analysis taking into account site-specific
variation (covarion model, Galtier, [138]). The temperature at which the earliest Bacteria arose was recently estimated from the melting temperature (Tm) of elongation
factor (EF) proteins reconstructed from ancestral Bacteria
[139]. The value fell between 64 and 73°C but was somewhat lower (61.4°C) when equilibrium frequencies in the
amino acid replacement matrix were based on 31 protein
families.

(iii) The correlation between EF stability and Topt of E.
coli and Thermus is good but it is not unusual to find a protein with a Tm higher than the Topt or even the Tmax of
the host; we do not know whether the EF Tm-Topt correlation was as good during early cell evolution.

If we take the latter results at face value, they are compatible with a thermal regime comparable to that of several
Bacilli but much less thermophilic than the hyperthermophiles Thermotoga or Aquifex, or even the extreme thermophile Thermus. Interestingly, it is precisely above this
range of growth temperatures (Tm and Tmax between 60
and 70°C) that we find the various types of unclassical
membrane lipids which suggest (see next section, [48,50])
that different lines of extreme thermophilic Bacteria
emerged by convergent evolution from a non-extreme
thermophilic ancestor(perhaps a moderate thermophile
or a thermotolerant mesophile) ,, equipped with the classical sn1,2 fatty acid membrane lipids characteristic of
most mesophilic Bacteria and all Eukarya.
The estimates based on EF Tm values call for some caveats
however:

(ii) The authors stress the parallel between their estimate
and the temperature of ancient oceans calculated from
isotope ratios (δ18O and δ30Si); the validity of the
approach has been questioned however, and temperate or
even cold climates were argued for the early Earth [141].

Taking these caveats into account, especially (i), it could
turn out that the T derived from reconstructed EF proteins
is an overestimate. On the other hand, 60 to 65°C, (a
moderately thermophilic or thermotolerant range) would
be at the lower end of Di Giulio'estimates and at the upper
end of Galtier's estimates. Moreover, the value estimated
by Gaucher et al. [139] concerns the emergence of ancient
Bacteria; the average environmental T of LUCA could have
been lower. Furthermore, as already stated above in the
introductory remarks, the LUCA community could have
been a mixture of populations with different temperature
profiles; perhaps Bacteria arose among already moderately thermophilic or thermotolerant representatives of
the LUCA community.
Conclusion about the thermal profile of LUCA
The data are in keeping with LUCA having been a moderate thermophile or a thermotolerant mesophile, perhaps
a community with a broad temperature range, from which
some descendants evolved towards extreme- or hyperthermophily by secondary adaptations. This provisional "consensus" is also compatible with the data reported in the
next section.
Defining the membrane lipids of ancestors
The emergence of the two main types of glycerol membrane lipids (sn1,2 fatty acid ester and sn2,3 isoprenoid

Page 10 of 35

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

ether as summarized in Fig. 1) is crucial to understand
adaptation to high temperature and is directly linked to
the origin of the Archaea ([29,48] and below). For the
reduction of the keto group in dihydroxy acetone phosphate (DAHP), a glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase
(G3PDH) accounts for Bacteria and Eukarya, and a glycerol 1 phosphate dehydrogenase (G1PDH) for Archaea
(Fig. 1). The two enzymes are not homologous but molecular modeling [142] suggested glycerol dehydrogenase
(GDH), an enzyme found in some Archaea, some Bacteria
and several Fungi, as ancestor of G1DPH (see also
[143,144]).
From the phylogenetic point of view, the Archaea appear
to have emerged as hyperthermophiles [134,135], though
this type of inference is always by default [145]. The first
Eukarya were probably mesophilic or at the most moderately thermophilic since no eukaryote living above 62°C
(some fungi) has ever been identified. It could be that this
limitation is a property of membranes consisting of a double layer of ester-fatty acid lipids, a feature eukaryotes
share with mesophilic and psychrophilic Bacteria and
would have been a feature of a non- or moderately thermophilic LUCA.
Indeed, whereas Archaea are characterized by ether-isoprenoids lipids which are suitable for life at high temperature and other stressing conditions [122,146] extreme
thermophilic Bacteria that grow at temperatures above
65–70°C possess various types of membrane lipids that
could represent convergent adaptations to life at high
temperature (see early observations by Forterre [53] and
[48,49]) whereas membranes of psychrophilic, mesophilic or moderate-thermophilic Bacteria appear to
respond to different temperature ranges by variations in
the degree of lipid saturation and the nature of side chains
[122,147].
What is particularly striking however, is the fact that
among membrane lipids of Bacteria presenting adaptations to various extreme conditions, either external (temperature, acidity) or internal (anammoxosomes
sequestering hydrazine), numerous instances of di-glycerol ether lipids, or lipids containing one ester and one
ether bond, even of transmembrane tetraether non isoprenoid lipids, have appeared [148-152]. These bacterial
glycerol ether lipids however are consistently of the sn1,2
stereoconformation, in contrast to the sn2,3 conformation found, until now, exclusively among the archaeal isoprenoid membrane lipids (Fig. 1). Therefore whether ester
or ether, a "primary divide" appears to exist between two
kinds of cells: on one side the Archaea (sn2,3), on the
other side the Bacteria and the Eukarya (sn 1, 2), as
emphasized by Wachtershauser [104] and by the group of
Koga [153,154].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

There is general agreement that the combination of ether
bond and isoprenoid side chains, in particular in the
transmembrane tetraether configuration, ensures high stability and low proton permeability [122]. Archaeal lipids
thus appear well suited for adaptation to extreme conditions such as high temperature, acidity and oxidation;
their ether bond is also resistant to high alkalinity. It may
therefore come as a surprise that psychrophilic Archaea,
such as those discovered by DeLong et al [155] in the
microplankton of cold oceans display the same type of
lipid architecture, even in the tetraether configuration.
The paradox is only apparent, however, because isoprenoid lipids can remain in a crystalline liquid state over a
very broad range, from about 0°C to above 100°C [122].
It is therefore possible to understand how psychrophilic
Archaea may have evolved from thermophilic ancestors
(as their phylogeny suggests) while keeping the same type
of lipids. In addition, Archaea respond to variations in
temperature by variations in the composition of their
membranes lipids (for example the proportion of caldarchaeol tetraether lipids increases with temperature in
Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, [156] and lipid unsaturation increases at low temperature in Methanococcoides burtonii [157]).
By comparison with the clear-cut molecular adaptations
to extreme conditions (such as temperature and acidity)
displayed by archaeal lipids, it seems reasonable to
attribute the same function (stability, low proton permeability) to bacterial lipids partially mimicking their
archaeal counterparts, such as lipids with ether bonds,
sometimes in the tetraether configuration (see references
above). The tetra-ester lipids and the long-chain diols
found in some thermophilic Bacteria [158,159] may also
contribute to membrane stability. The complex glycolipids found in Thermus and related organisms, display bulky
head groups that presumably enhance stability [160]; they
were found to increase in proportion with the growth
temperature [152,161,162]. Note however that these are
not isoprenoid lipids, which may explain, at least in part,
why none of the so-called hyperthermophilic Bacteria can
grow in the same temperature ranges as hyperthermophilic Archaea.
By contrast with the monotonic composition of archaeal
lipids, the high variability observed among Bacteria
adapted to extreme conditions (high temperature, acidity,
hydrazine sequestering in anammoxosomes) but belonging to different branches of the Domain thus suggests that
these adaptations are the result of evolutionary convergence from a non extreme thermophilic LUCA with membrane lipids in the sn1,2 configuration, presumably fatty
acid lipids linked to glycerol by ester bonds. By contrast,
the Archaea would have emerged as thermophiles from
the start by inventing the sn2,3 isoprenoid ether configu-

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

ration. We therefore suggested [29,48] that Archaea would
have emerged by "thermoreduction" – to use Forterre's
terminology – from a non thermophilic LUCA under
strong selective pressure for adaptation to high temperature; on the contrary, in contrast with the original thermoreduction hypothesis [46], formulated when the tree
of life still suggested that early "prokaryotes" were all
extreme- or hyperthermophiles, Bacteria would have been
originally non-thermophilic, having emerged by reductive
evolution from the LUCA as a separate group at another
time than Archaea; the different bacterial lipids resulting
from convergent evolution would have kept the original
sn1,2 configuration.
The occurrence of the divide between sn1,2 (ester/etherfatty acid) and sn2,3 ether-isoprenoid lipids
A major question is how this major divide occurred (Fig.
1). We consider as unlikely that sn1,2 fatty acid and sn2,3
isoprenoid membrane lipids independently replaced the
mineral membranes of a non cellular but compartmentalized ancestor to create the two groups of prokaryotes.
Indeed, arguing from the non homology of the membranes of Archaea and Bacteria in favour of a non cellular
ancestor and the independent emergence of the two types
of lipids [22,153,163] overlooks the fact that all organisms can synthesize both fatty acids and isoprenoids, and
that, at least in theory, it is possible to retrodict both pathways to an ancestral mode of lipid synthesis [104].

For Wachtershauser [107], heterochiral membranes, with
the two different types of lipids, preceded the sn divide for
a long period of time; the first lipid were synthesized as a
racemate, perhaps non enzymatically, the first enzymes to
catalyze their formation were non-enantiospecific and
later replaced by specific ones. Pereto et al. [143] favoured
a similar scenario. Such membranes should be unstable
however [164]; the mixed membrane therefore would
have spontaneously segregated the two different types of
lipids, creating organisms with either sn1,2 or sn2,3 (i.e.,
in Pereto et al. [143] Bacteria and Archaea, that would
later have merged to generate the ancestor of eukaryotes).
We see several difficulties with this scenario. The idea of a
non-enantiospecific enzyme is not very much in keeping
with our current appreciation of enzymatic specificity.
There is well a CDP-archaeol synthase that does not recognize ester or ether bonds between glycerol and hydrocarbon chains nor the stereostructure of glycerophosphate
but mainly the geranylgeranylchains [165]; however the
notion that the first step in the synthesis of isoprenoid
ether glycerol lipids and all downstream enzymes would
have been non-enantiospecific [107] looks a very constraining hypothesis. Moreover, the very instability of heterochiral membranes that underlies the idea of
spontaneous segregation, might be so great (as suggested

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

by the behaviour of racemic mixtures of D- and L-myristoyl-alanine: a strong chiral dicrimination in a few minutes, followed by chiral segregation into D- and Ldomains in about one hour [166]) that the persistence of
such membranes over a significant period of time appears
problematic. Moreover, the phylogenetic inference that
the subunits of protein translocase, which operate in a
lipid environment, appears to have been present in the
ancestors of Bacteria and Archaea suggests stable lipid
membranes [108,167]; in the absence of experimental
evidence, it seems questionable that such membranes
could have been heterochiral. Besides, the emergence of
the two enantiomeric membrane lipids is presented
almost in abstracto as a spontaneous symmetry breaking
process, without any attempt to relate it to environmental
conditions that may have presided over the emergence of
Bacteria and Archaea. Wachtershauser [107] rejected the
idea that membranes with sn2,3 lipids emerged from an
ancestor equipped with sn1,2 lipids as "counterselective ",
arguing that an organism that would be in the process of
such a reconversion would be too unstable, even if, on the
other hand, he paradoxically assumes that heterochiral
membranes could have persisted for several hundred million years. To fully understand the controversy, it must be
recalled that Wachtershauser favours an origin of life at
high temperature and subsequent evolution from a hyperthermophilic universal ancestor toward mesophilic and
psychrophilic descendants, going as far as claiming that
the reverse is "impossible" [168] (see however [50] for a
discussion proposing mechanisms for progressive adaptation to thermal tolerance and thermophily; see also a
recent report giving a striking example of adaptation to
thermal tolerance by multiple symbiosis [169]) Wachtershauser therefore has no incentive to suppose that the
emergence and segregation of organisms having acquired
the capacity to synthesize sn2,3 isoprenoid lipids could
have occurred under strong selective pressure for adaptation to high temperature in a mesophilic organism containing only sn1,2 fatty acid lipids, which is exactly what we
proposed [29,48] and placed the putative reconversion
process in a totally different perspective. Moreover, the
fact that archaeal lipids are sn2,3 ether and that many
extreme thermophilic bacteria also have ether lipids argues
for the emergence of this type of lipid under selective pressure.
However our previous proposal [29,48] presented the
transition sn1,2 fatty acid -sn2,3 isoprenoids lipids without specifying putative steps; as it is unlikely that the shift
in stereoconfiguration and in the choice of side chains
were simultaneous, we feel the necessity to be more
explicit. Perhaps the membrane of the precursor of
Archaea was first selected to contain isoprenoid ester lipids (providing already some adaptation to adverse conditions such as high temperature), then gave rise to

Page 12 of 35

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

isoprenoid-ether lipids (under selection for further adaptation) and this step may have automatically favoured the
selection of the sn2,3 configuration. Indeed, GGGPS (the
enzyme catalyzing the formation of the isoprenoid-ether
bond, fig 1) displays a strong preference for G1P with
respect to G3P [144]; if this is an intrinsic property of all
GGGPS (or if a G1P-inclined GGGPS was the only one
around at the time of selection of the lineage that was to
persist), it is conceivable that the selection or the recruitment of a G1PDH followed suit. In the meantime some
sn1,2 glycerol isoprenoid ether lipids could have been
produced, to disappear later on with the recruitment of
G1PDH as a enzyme providing a more adequate substrate.
In this respect it is interesting that G1PDH is not an
archaeal exclusivity; in fact both G1PDH [143] and
GGGPS [144] have been found in several Bacteria where
their present function is unknown. Both enzymes could
have been present in the LUCA community; alternatively,
under strong selective pressure, G1PDH could have been
"borrowed" by HGT from a bacterium or recruited as a
novel enzyme from a GDH. The next enzyme that completes the formation of a C20–C20 diether lipid (digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase (DGGGPS), see Fig.
1) could have been recruited from the family of prenyltransferases that contains several membrane-intrinsic proteins in all three Domains [170]. Of course, in this view,
the so-called "primary divide" between sn1,2 and sn2,3
glycerol lipids now appears as secondary!
Payandeh and Pai [171] showed that GGGPS probably
originates from duplication and fusion of an ancestral
gene coding for a (β-α)4 half-barrel. In their "lipid capture
model" they proposed that GGGPS appeared in a bacterial-like ancestor, paving the way to the formation of an
isoprenoid-lipid membrane (after recruitment of a
G1PDH and a DGGGPS), by automatic segregation from
a transient heterochiral membrane. The model has the
advantage of not postulating a protracted heterochiral
state as an intermediate, in keeping with our earlier proposal [48], but no assumption was made regarding the
selective pressure that could have influenced the process.
Moreover the authors favour eukaryogenesis by fusion
between an Archaeon and a Bacterium, perhaps because if
they assumed a common ancestor for all three Domains,
their hypothesis would imply that Archaea and Bacteria
diverged from a line already distinct from LUCA; this
would not be in keeping with the well documented view
that Archaea and Eukarya share an ancestor distinct from
that of Bacteria.
We want to mention in passing that other lipids could
have preceded glycerol lipids, perhaps at a very early time;
Wachtershauser ([104], see also [48]) suggested that
sphingolipids could have been the primeval ones. Sphingolipids are today represented in a few Bacteria, absent

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

from Archaea (where they could have disappeared when
the sn2,3 glycerol lipids became dominant) and ubiquitous in Eukarya.
To conclude, we definitely prefer a Darwinian working
hypothesis to the fortuitous emergence of enantiospecific
enzymes followed by automatic segregation of two types
of lipids. Since all organisms appear to be capable of synthesizing both fatty acids and isoprenoids, our scenario
suggests that no major, improbable reconversions would
have had to occur when converting one type of membrane
into the other one. Genetic experiments on the degree of
flexibility of GGGPS stereospecificity could provide interesting results. Useful information would also be obtained
from genetically engineered organisms able to synthesize
both types of lipids, if these turned out to be viable; perhaps they would if they were engineered so as to conditionally synthesize the two types of lipids.

LUCA was genetically redundant; differential
loss of paralogues created numerous
phylogenetic discrepancies
In the above we repeatedly stressed that the LUCA does
not appear to have been a simple, minimal system from
which everything eukaryotic emerged by further complexification. In particular, phylogenetic inferences on its
metabolism and gene content give a sophisticated picture
[29,43,91,114,172,173] that can in part be understood in
terms of a diversified and promiscuous community, but
also taken as a sign of generalized genetic redundancy. It
is indeed very likely that most cells in an ancestral community having engendered the diversity of metabolic
functions found in the three Domains possessed more
than a single copy of every essential gene as well as numerous paralogous genes. This redundancy could have been
selected for as an important survival factor for cells with a
still primitive, not fail-safe division mechanism. An
important consequence of both this redundant genetic
inventory, and of the complexity of the communal LUCA
population, is that its descendants, in any one of the three
Domains, will have inherited only one of many of the
genes that were present in more than one exemplar in the
ancestral pool. A striking example of this is the phylogenetic analysis of carbamoyltransferases by Labedan and
colleagues [172,173]; the intricate topology of the distribution of both aspartate- and ornithine-carbamoyltransferases (ATCase and OTCase, respectively) among the
three Domains could readily be understood by haphazard
loss of gene copies in different lines of descent when it was
recognized that any ATCase or OTCase belongs to one of
two families that can be traced back to gene duplications
having occurred most probably before emergence of the
LUCA (Fig 3 of [172]). The statistical validity of these very
ancient paralogies was confirmed by the unfailing correspondence found between the type of ATCase gene inher-

Page 13 of 35

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

ited and the structural class of the corresponding enzyme
[173]. Moreover, a tree made with nearly 3,000 homologous carbamoyltransferases corresponding to at least five
different enzymatic activities (our very recent unpublished results) confirms that the primary duplications that
produced differentiated genes from an ancestral, substrate
ambiguous carbamoyltransferase was already an ancient
event in the evolution of LUCA. Most probably, these primeval enzymes present in the ancestors of LUCA were
already endowed with a surprising functional diversity.
Such a specific protein history is unlikely to be an isolated
case as studies on other enzymes suggest [39,93,174-177].
Moreover, paralogies may go unnoticed if gene duplicates
remain cryptic as the result of inactivating mutations
[178].
Therefore, when attempting to build a phylogenetic tree
with genes encoding proteins, many unpredictable discrepancies with respect to the classical SSU-rRNA tree are
expected to turn out because of loss of paralogues. Numerous such discrepancies have indeed been observed but, in
most cases, attributed to HGT without other justification
than the occurrence of the discrepancy itself. Several
authors have pointed out that such a systematic bias is
abusive and that successful HGT, especially between phylogenetically distant organisms, has to go through several
steps, none of which appears particularly likely, even
when ecological proximity is granted [29,49,89,179-182].
In contrast with the transfer of genes between related
organisms or between members of a group such as the
Proteobacteria, where arguments independent from statistics support the occurrence of HGT (presence of transposons, integrons, genomic islands, presence or absence
of whole sets of genes in different strains from the same
species, especially pathogens), acquisition of a foreign
gene from a phylogenetically distant organism to complement a defective mutant is less likely than replacement by
an intact exemplar from cells of the same species; moreover successful HGT requires replication, maintenance and
efficient expression of the transferred gene, which, in the
case of interdomain transfer compounds difficulties. Furthermore, inferring the incidence of interdomain transfer
from the apparent frequency of foreign but nevertheless
mostly bacterial-like genes hosted by E. coli [2] is misleading [29]. In fact, a rigorous phylogenetic analysis confirmed that most genes appear to be vertically inherited
but suggested that metabolic genes (that may confer direct
physiological advantages) could be more prone to HGT
[183]. It is not the place here to again discuss these arguments in detail (see references above) only to stress the
point that the loss of paralogous gene copies in descendants of LUCA is not just an alternative explanation for
phylogenetic discrepancies, it is an actual prediction.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

In addition, it is possible that certain phylogenetic discrepancies are due to differential loss of paralogues created just ahead of a bifurcation leading to a phylogenetic
anomaly; this might also explain a large number of events
attributed to HGT; various chromosomal rearrangements
increasing gene copy number indeed occur in bacteria,
with variable frequencies [184-186].
In many cases it would be difficult to distinguish between
HGT and gene loss; however, in the very formulation of
alleged HGT patterns, it is sometimes apparent how close
that interpretation comes close to the unmentioned alternative; see for example [144] when Boucher et al. conclude from their phylogenetic analysis of genes involved
in isoprenoid synthesis, that some of the postulated HGTs
must have taken place "prior to the diversification of these
groups" (refers to "particular orders of Archaea") or represent transfer from eukaryotes to Archaea. The bias for HGT
even takes the form of circular reasoning in a review stating that "the fixation and long-term persistence of horizontally transferred genes suggests (our emphasis) that
they confer a selective advantage on the recipient organism" ([187], page 709). We conclude that the intrinsic
likeliness of differential gene loss and the unlikeliness of
HGT between organisms as different and distant as
Archaea and Bacteria or even between many phyla within
the same Domain (requiring several events without any
obvious selection in most cases) bring in doubt the rampant character attributed to HGT by many authors. It
could very well be that loss of paralogues (from LUCA and
created by later duplications) accounts for a large proportion of events attributed to HGT, especially between
Domains (an event that would compound difficulties). It
should be clear that we are not rejecting the notion that a
certain proportion of phylogenetic incongruencies are due
to HGT; even between Domains, the transfer of genes with
pleiotropic effects (such as reverse gyrase or other topoisomerases [44,188] appears to have occurred, presumably
under selection; this type of event seems however infrequent and contrasts with the indiscriminate recourse to
HGT found in many publications.
It may again be emphasized that this view is in keeping
with a shift in our appreciation of the nature of LUCA. It
is not anymore taken for granted that LUCA was a "simple
or primitive cellular entity" [189]; moreover the emergence of the branches leading to the two "prokaryotic"
Domains also is likely to result from a complex process
involving constant and mutual genomic additions to the
evolving cells, until the moment the cellular subsystems
we know as Domains "crystallized" [9] as organismal lineages, becoming by and large refractory to further genetic
exchanges except perhaps under strong selective pressure.
Consequently, without further evidence for the actual

occurrence of HGT and its real scope, it appears premature
to challenge the existence of a Tree of Life [2,3].

The evolutionary position of the LUCA
A communal RNA LUCA
Before examining the origin of a complex LUCA in the last
part of this paper, we will summarize our position regard-

ing the cellular constitution and the immediate legacy of
the LUCA (see Fig. 2). An important point is that the "primary divide" in the emergence and evolution of biological
membranes is compatible with the scenario of a major
divergence from a multiphenotypic RNA LUCA community into Bacteria and Archaea/Eukarya.

harnessing and the RNA-DNA transition.

We have discussed arguments that make the notion of a
RNA (or possibly a RNA/DNA) LUCA less improbable
that it appeared only a few years ago. A DNA LUCA is not
excluded (see [13] for a vigorous defense of the concept,
also [107] though with very different arguments), but
recent developments support the hypothesis of a RNA
LUCA that would have evolved into descendants with
DNA as genetic material by processes implying the intervention of viruses [11,12,44]. The idea that such a RNA
LUCA was a phagocytic cell, (or at least belonged to a
community containing such organisms) has also come on
the foreground [31,63]. We considered the possibility that
a bona fide DNA nucleus could have emerged in a RNA
LUCA containing a protonucleus enclosing the RNA
genome, in order to minimize the number of independent events to be postulated. Further research on the occurrence of comparable structures throughout Bacteria and
Archaea, on the phylogeny of their components and
mechanisms of information transfer, could have a major
impact on our perception of LUCA.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

Darwinism is often understood as Natural Selection, a
process that must have operated at all stages of the emergence and evolution of life. Likewise – with all due respect
for the evolutionary insights developed in "Collective evolution and the genetic code" [190] – calling "Evolution of
the genetic code, translation, and cellular organization
itself" a "Lamarckian process" also appears misleading by
the implied suggestion of a basic difference between
dynamic modes operating at different stages of the emergence of life. The inheritance of acquired characters
(which is what Vetsigian et al. [190] are referring to as
"Lamarckian" for emergence of a universal code in an
evolving community) was accepted as a matter of course
by Darwin himself in the absence of genetic knowledge.
Yet, an essential point in Woese's theory is that "communal evolution" came, at all stages (and unavoidably),
under Natural Selection.

For reasons we hope to have made clear all along this discussion, we will not come back on the models of eukaryogenesis by merging "prokaryotes" but consider what we
believe the most likely: the evolution of an already sophisticated LUCA, embedded in an intricate, promiscuous and
multiphenotypic community, towards either of the three
Domains. That it was a community played a capital role in
the development of a unique genetic code at the earlier
progenote stage [190] but was also a prerequisite for further evolution. The LUCA community probably consisted
of several metabolic types [114], but a major heterogeneity in this population may already have been structural,
i.e. the coexistence of phagocytic and non phagocytic cells
[31], perhaps also of intermediary types (Jekely's "predators" [112] but without implying that this population
contained anything like our modern "prokaryotes") This
community was essentially dynamic and unstable, occupying a broad temperature range, and constantly incorporating or rejecting innovations via cellular exchanges,
presumably by some merging process between cells
devoid of rigid envelopes, unlike most prokaryotes (Fig.
2B).

This being said, the particularly heuristic character of the
"communal" concept brought forward by Kandler [114]
and Woese [9] to understand LUCA, its predecessor the
progenote, and its descendants should be emphasized.
The concept is a real breakthough in evolutionary biology
thanks to its explanatory power. Just as, today, ecological
interdependence makes it difficult to purify more than a
tiny fraction of microorganisms out of any natural community, relentless competition took place between the
highly interdependent organisms forming the LUCA community. Even the emergence of the ancestor of a particular
Domain must have been an event conditioned by the
actual state of ecological interactions (including viral
invasions) occurring within the community at the time.
Koonin [193] recently illustrated the power of the community concept in his "Biological Big Bang" model for
major transitions in evolution, by discussing how genetic
exchanges within an ancestral and promiscuous community could generate a large variety of forms from which
new classes of entities (the new Domains) independently
emerged at a new level of complexity. The substitution of
dynamic communities for punctual origins in order to
explain the emergence and divergence of biological and
perhaps cultural trends (such as the origin of languages)
may commend itself as a general principle.

Despite being a "community", this population would not
in any way have escaped Natural Selection, the universal
process that Dennett [191] called "Darwin's dangerous
idea" and compared to a "universal acid" biting through
everything, biological or not, perhaps the greatest philosophical advance since the dawn of mankind. We believe
this should be emphasized because the concept of a "Darwinian threshold" [192] above which "vertically generated novelty can and does assume greater importance"
(and species thus become recognizable entities) may be
misleading, or at least ambiguous since the essence of

From the above, it is clear that LUCA was a changeable
entity; at the time of emergence of the first Domain it
must have existed as a particular cell line that was the
product of an untold number of genetic exchanges within
the LUCA "community". As for other major steps in evolution [194], the emergence of the first Domain must have
been the outcome of a crisis rather than a progressive
development; today there is probably no situation anymore where the dynamics of evolutionary change is as
powerful and as rapid. Whichever emerged first from the
protoeukaryotic LUCA, the cell line that became the com-

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

mon ancestor of the two other Domains was certainly different and probably less promiscuous already. This type of
evolutionary "eruption" would defy any attempt at reconstitution. We can, however, formulate a number of questions; few can be answered but an important point is that
many of these questions could not have been formulated
a few years ago.
A simple model
The direct exploration of filiations by various phylogenetic approaches has delivered an enormous amount of
information on the possible root of the tree of life; much
of it is controversial but the concept of a protoeukaryotic
LUCA developed here is not dependent of the branching
order of the three Domains. Increasing doubts concerning
an extreme- or hyperthermophilic LUCA, the pattern of
apparently convergent evolution displayed by the lipid
membranes of various thermophilic Bacteria and the
comparison between membrane lipids in the three
Domains support our hypothesis of a non-thermophilic
(at the most moderately thermophilic or thermotolerant)
LUCA community of protoeukaryotic cells from which
Bacteria emerged by reductive evolution and Archaea by a
"thermoreduction" implying the invention of sn2,3 isoprenoid ether lipids (Fig. 2B). The latter, with the ether
bond as a selective, thus critical feature, are seen as the
outcome of a molecular adaptation to extreme conditions
that is in keeping with the alleged thermophilic origin of
Archaea. Should however the archaeal Domain turn out
to have emerged from a mesophilic or psychrophilic
ancestor, other scenarios should be proposed. Even
though the isoprenoid ether membrane is adaptable to
the whole range of temperatures compatible with life,
there is no obvious selective force to make such a structure
emerge from a fatty acid lipid ancestor at low temperature,
unless the ancestral archaeon had to adapt to another
extreme condition, such as acidity, high alkalinity and/or
an oxidating environment. Pursuing phylogenetic analyses of Archaea and their membranes is thus of great
importance to test theories on their origin, and, by the
same token, on the nature of LUCA.

Our working hypothesis for the emergence of the archaeal
membrane is compatible with a bacterial [44] or an
archaeal [45] root for the universal tree of life. The sn1,2sn2,3 conversion in the emergence of archaeal membrane
lipids could have been fulfilled in the precursor of
Archaea before or after the virus-mediated RNA-DNA
transition (fig 2). At any rate, what the chemical nature of
biological membranes makes very unlikely indeed is that
a full-fledged Archaeon would have been the common
ancestor of both modern Archaea and Eukarya, since such
a scenario would imply inventing twice the sn1,2 fatty acid
lipid membrane, once for Bacteria, once for Eukarya. In
this respect, we hope this discussion makes clear how

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

important a major cellular feature may become when phylogeny remains contentious. Indeed, it was the analysis of
membrane chemistry that suggested the idea that extreme
thermophilic Bacteria emerged by convergent evolution
from a non extreme thermophilic ancestor, itself derived
from a LUCA community with a moderate but perhaps
mixed temperature range, whereas Archaea at the outset
adapted to extreme conditions by a shift in their membrane lipids.
Fig 2 summarizes our conception of the evolutionary
steps in the rise and fall of LUCA, including the first
increase in complexity discussed in the next section. Representing LUCA evolving within a communal population
that would have "crystallized" [9] into different Domains
thus aptly replaces the constrained "rooting" and "branching" metaphors of the past. In that sense, and in that sense
only, do we see the necessity to replace the tree of the past
by a new representation that however maintains Darwin's
idea of a common ancestry for all living forms. Basically,
nodes of divergence are replaced by an area stretching
across time and space: one could compare the community
embedding LUCA to a big tuber sprouting shoots and
emptying itself in the process [49]. A visit to The New York
Metropolitan Museum of Arts unexpectedly provided
artistic support for this representation with Juan Miro's
"Potato" (Insert A in Fig. 2).

Emergence of life, complexity and order
We do not claim to treat in a comprehensive way the far
reaching problematic that this title underlies. It seems
however that the time is ripe to bring together a number
of considerations that have been either left aside from
many current discussions of the origin of life and LUCA,
or neglected and sometimes misunderstood.
The main steps between the emergent life and the advent
of LUCA
Our focus will be the question of LUCA complexity as
summarized in Fig. 2. We have seen above that LUCA may
be understood as a diverse community of already metabolically and genetically sophisticated organisms. Its
predecessor the progenote, more primitive and modular,
was also a heterogeneous and diverse community of cells
engaged in the emergence of a genetic code [190]. How
did it come about? By using the word "complexity" we do
not imply anything else here that an intuitive grasp of the
concept. This is indeed enough to contrast two apparently
unreconcilable views on the origin of the most important
feature of living cells, the ability to replicate and to reproduce. The classical approach espouses the Lamarckian
idea of evolution from the simple to the complex and
focuses on experiments trying to reconstitute primordial
RNA molecules capable of replication. The main merit of
this approach is indeed to focus on actual experiments

Page 17 of 35

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

and some remarkable results have been obtained on the
way some ribozymes may have started to replicate themselves [195,196]. However the emergence of self-replicating entities of increasing complexity requires both the
formation of compartments (without which no distinction can be made between genotype and phenotype, and
parasitic molecules can not be removed) and an ambient
metabolism from which to draw renewable building
blocks; such a metabolism therefore should be self-sustaining to a certain extent; de Duve [197,198] and
Wachtershauser [104,199] have presented different versions of dynamic, evolving and self-sustaining metabolic
networks.
Obviously, to make life emerge, some form of autocatalysis is required. The question is however, whether autocatalysis had to emerge as a primordial event already
implying the replication of nucleic acid molecules (not
necessarily the RNA we know today) or whether it was the
global property of "catalytically closed" systems ([34,200]
and other references below). The proponents of this alternative that radically departs from the classical one in its
central argument have developed models that predict the
emergence, before any molecular coding system, of entities that are both metabolically developed and autoreplicating (Fig. 2B). Kauffman ([34], see also Dyson [201])
discussed extensively how such a system could appear in
a prebiotic environment where peptides [200] or both
peptides and oligomers of nucleotides (both naturally
endowed with catalytic properties) could be formed [34].
Above a certain level of diversification and catalytic interconnections, the system would undergo "catalytic closure", thereby becoming capable of self-replication (Fig.
2B). Using the related concept of "compositional heredity", Segre, Lancet and coworkers developed a similar
model [202-204] and placed the emphasis on lipids, calling attention to the probable existence of several classes of
"lipozymes" [203]. As these views are mutually compatible, it is tempting to merge them and to envisage the
emergence of lipid-enclosed compartments enveloping a
variety of ribozymes and peptides large enough to
undergo catalytic closure (Fig. 2B). Indeed, among several
types of entities a priori capable of catalytic closure, it is
conceivable that only those combining lipids, RNA and
peptides in an ambient protometabolism had a future
because of the potential of nucleic acids to engender a
coding system. To understand the emergence of such systems, perhaps one should also take into account what Ray
called "sociality", referring to entities that can only replicate when they occur in aggregations [205].
Such lipid-enclosed compartments might have formed in
very different environments: for example the relatively
cool hydrothermal vents of the type found at the "Lost
City," that combine the advantages of non-extreme tem-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

peratures with the capacity to concentrate macromolecules in pores [206,207] or, at the other extreme, glacial
ice [208]. Wachtershauser has described how membrane
lipids could arise from a surface metabolism developing
on particles of pyrite in a volcanic setting [199]. For that
matter, if we are to explain the emergence of self-replicating entities by catalytic closure of interactions between
polypeptides, polynucleotides and the first amphiphilic,
lipid-like molecules (Segre's "lipozymes" [203]), it
appears reasonable to assume the latter were of protometabolic rather than meteoritic origin [209]. Admittedly, the
"compositional" type of model suffers from lack of experimental support, which is not surprising considering the
number of parameters, conditions and alternatives that
would have to be explored in order to put it to experimental test. It has however the merit of considering the properties and interactions of real molecules, a prerequisite
emphasized by Pross [210]. Catalytic closure has another,
powerful scientific merit: it is predictable, something that
cannot be said of most proposals for the origin of single
replicators. However farfetched its application to biological systems may appear to some (see, for example, [210212]), the hypothesis of a primeval role of metabolism
originally devoid of a coding system in the emergence of
the first precursors of living cells is gaining ground
[213,214]. It has also the merit of presenting the emergence of a coding device culminating in the directed synthesis of the best possible catalysts – enzymes – as a
process arising under the immensely efficient driving
force of Natural Selection for greater fitness, by increasing
the reproducibility of the autoreplicating system and
eliminating unnecessary and parasitic reactions. In this
frame of thought, still purely theoretical efforts "in search
of the simplest cells" [215] predict how heredity could
evolve in cross-catalytic, autoreplicating networks by virtue of minority components assembling into polymers
[216,217].
Various experimental and conceptual advances
[108,195,199,218-220] might all be considered in the
frame of catalytically closed systems. The statement that
"the evolution of nucleic acid replication and of nucleic
acid-catalysed peptide synthesis must have been intrinsically linked" [108] is particularly interesting in this
respect. In fact, catalytically closed, autoreplicating entities should be regarded as natural incubators, test-banks
for the relentless selection and improvement of any type
of molecular approximation of a coding system increasing
the overall efficiency of the catalytically closed entities. In
other words, the likeliness of a coding device emerging in
the enclosed environment of such autoreplicating entities
would be much higher than in a non- or poorly self-sustaining environment, the more so that these entities
would be able to exchange material (again, the community paradigm). This view ceases to oppose "metabolism

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

first" to "replicating first" by offering a synthesis between
two models that indeed do not have to be irreconcilable.
This goes well beyond the idea that the "emerging primal
system was both metabolic and replicative" [210] by
explicitly transfering the burden of emergence of the coding system to Natural Selection exerting its screening
power on a self-sustaining, autoreplicating environment,
thereby considerably increasing the chance for such a system to develop. We could therefore abandon the opposition between "metabolism first" and "replication first"
and consider the emergence of genomes within the molecular environment of autonomous, replicating entities
originally devoid of them as a sound alternative to current
theories.
Appealing aspects of the catalytic closure hypothesis
Catalytically closed systems such as proposed by Kauffman [34,200] have other merits still; they assume the
prebiotic formation of peptides, a type of event considered as probable and anterior to the emergence of any selfreplicating nucleic acid by de Duve [198]. This questions
the hypothesis of a pure RNA world and makes de Duve'
theory of a metabolism arising from protometabolism by
selection and congruent with it, even more appealing than
it originally was [197,198].

One of the most attractive aspects of catalytic closure as a
possible step in the emergence of life is that it substitutes
a qualitative jump toward a high degree of complexity for
the laborious progression from simple to complex that
used to be taken for granted but lost much of its simple
appeal when molecular mechanisms came to be discussed. How complex such a catalytically closed entity
possibly was has been discussed by Kauffman [34] who
estimated that several thousands of catalytically interacting polymers (6,200 if the probability of catalysis for any
reaction by a particular polymer is 10-8, 18,200 if this
probability is 10-9) would have been capable of forming
an autoreplicating system. Though no direct correlation
can be suggested, it is nevertheless striking that the
number of catalytic functions necessary to close the system (admittedly under somewhat arbitrary conditions)
approximates the number of genes in a simple eukaryote.
The primordial self-replicating entity was thus from the
start a fairly complex one.
The above calculation was refuted by Lifson [211] who
concluded that Kauffman's model was therefore invalid.
This refutation was carried over in the literature [212] but
we believe it may not be correct. Kauffman' mathematical
treatment of such a complex problem is deliberately and
utterly simplified, which already limits the validity of a
too narrow refutation. More specifically, the treatment
focuses on an alleged constant probability P that one polymer species has of catalyzing any specific reaction;

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

according to Lifson [211], P = P'.P", P' being the probability that a polymer is a catalyst without specifying which
reaction it catalyses, and P" the probability that a catalyst
catalyses a particular reaction. P' is considered by Lifson to
be a number "much smaller than 1" (which is however
not obvious at all); this is then mathematically shown to
ruin Kauffman's claim for "crystallization of connected
metabolism as a percolation problem". The refutation
would however be questioned if P' were not that low
(how much was left out of Lifson's comments). In the
same line, an earlier account of Kauffman's theory was
considered by Joyce as "resting on a highly overoptimistic
estimate of this probability" (see [211] Appendix A). At
least the matter lends itself to experimentation and could
be granted more consideration than subjective criticisms.
At any rate, catalytic closure is a powerful concept and
other formulations of the same basic idea of replication
without a genome have been presented, such as the models of Segre, Lancet and collaborators, [202-204] – integrating chemical kinetics – the model of Jain and Krishna
[221], and more recent elaborations on compositional
heredity [222,223] which take into account the environmental component, energy fluxes, various types of molecular interactions, and propose experimental tests.
Experiments on mineral surface-directed membrane
assembly and replication of bilayer-membrane vesicles
pave the way towards reconstitution of cellular ancestors
[224,225].
This catalytically closed entity was not just a bag of catalysts. A theory was recently proposed to explain how catalytic aggregations of increasing complexity (such as
metabolic chains) may have formed spontaneously [35].
The importance of molecular complementarity in the formation of aggregates within such systems was also
stressed by Hunding et al. [222]; this should have been an
essential aspect of progressive metabolic organization.
Moreover, "molecular crowding" is also recognized as an
important factor in the formation of complexes and networks of proteins ([31] and ref therein). This type of
"complexification" is an objectively defined process, contrasting with the vague idea of increasing complexity up
the evolutionary scale that has been assumed by many as
a matter of course since its formulation by Lamarck. The
same can be said of considerations on functional information in complex emergent systems developed by Hazen et
al. [36].

Conclusion
The topic of LUCA's identity has evolved considerably in
the last few years and we believe that a synthetic working
hypothesis can be proposed that draws its strength from
several advances (Fig. 2B). We summarize this synthesis in

ten points. Our own contributions mainly concern points
2 and 5 to 9.

divergence into Domains may also have contributed in no
small measure.

(1) The word "prokaryote" has become inadequate and
misleading.

10) The models of "catalytic closure" and "compositional
heredity" transcend the old opposition between "replicators first" and "metabolism first" by offering a cradle for
the relentless selection of a genetic code in a favourable
environment. A previous refutation is shown to be inconclusive. These models have the advantage of being predictive and therefore testable experimentally.

(2) Eukaryotic idiosyncrasies and a reappraisal of phylogeny do not support the notion of a prokaryotic LUCA nor
of prokaryotic ancestors of the eukaryotic cell body. The
order of branching in the universal tree has no bearing on
the cellular architecture of LUCA.

Competing interests
(3) LUCA was a protoeukaryote, with a RNA genome
inherited from its progenote ancestor. This RNA LUCA
was in a metabolically and morphologically heterogeneous community, constantly shuffling around genetic
material. Part of it was phagotrophic. LUCA remained an
evolutionary entity, though loosely defined and constantly changing, as long as this promiscuity lasted.
(4) The RNA to DNA transition took place independently
in different lineages of this community; the intervention
of viruses appears a likely mechanism. This process led to
the emergence of the three Domains.
(5) Within the LUCA community some cells developed
membranes with the rudiments of electron tranportdriven phosphorylation; we suggest those cells (perhaps
already engaged in reductive evolution) gave rise to Bacteria and Archaea.
(6) LUCA was a mixture of cells with different, overlapping thermal profiles (up to moderately thermophilic or
thermotolerant); it had membranes with sn1,2 fatty acids
lipids.
(7) Archaea arose by reductive evolution under selection
for adaptation to high temperatures; this entailed the
replacement of sn1,2 ester fatty acid lipid by sn2,3 ether
isoprenoid lipids in the cell membrane, without major
enzymatic reconversion.
(8) Bacteria arose by reductive evolution; secondary, convergent adaptations to thermophily entailed the formation of a variety of membrane lipids, often with ether
bonds, but still with a sn1,2 stereoconfiguration.
(9) LUCA was genetically redundant; therefore the differential loss of paralogous gene copies in different lines of
descent is a predicted source of phylogenetic discrepancies
with respect to the SSU-rRNA tree. We expect a considerable proportion of these anomalies to have resulted from
this process rather than from horizontal gene transfer,
especially between Domains or distantly related taxa.
Duplications occurring downstream from the initial

Genomics, Stockholm University, Sweden – currently at:
School of Biological Sciences, University of Canterbury, New
Zealand

The main point of this paper is to put forth a scenario for
the nature of the Last Universal Common Ancestor
(LUCA) as a complex, protoeukaryotic lineage with an
RNA genome and nuclear compartmentation. If I understand correctly, the argument is built on the proposal,
adapted from Woese's Universal Ancestor model (ref. 9 in
the paper) that there was an extremely diverse community
of cells from which the three domains emerged. Woese's
model is that rates of horizontal gene transfer were
extremely high early in the evolution of life, and that
transfer rates became lower with time, eventually leading
to 'crystallisation' of the three domains independently
from this early state. As far as I can tell, the authors are
comfortable with this interpretation, and take this scenario as their starting point. However Glansdorff, Xu &
Labedan's model diverges considerably from other published scenarios in several important ways. First, while
they appear happy with high rates of gene transfer very
early, they see a minor – perhaps marginal – role for horizontal gene transfer after 'crystallisation' (the term Woese
uses in his model to refer to the distinct emergence of lineages which have become refractory to further gene transfer). Glansdorff and colleagues also argue that reductive
evolution and themoreduction had an important role in
shaping bacteria and archaea, respectively, and that,
because the eukaryote lineage is argued not to have been

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

subject to such reductive evolution, many traits within
this domain are ancestral (read: features of the LUCA). A
central part of their model is that differential gene loss has
played a major role in shaping the differences between the
three domains of life.
The authors succinctly summarise their opinions in ten
points in the final conclusions section, which is much
appreciated, since it is an unwieldy manuscript at times
(though there are some wonderful insights among some
more well-trodden material – the quizzical air in which
zygogenesis is brought up (why haven't proponents of
fusion been all over this?) and the anticipatory remarks
that serve to castrate any use of this observation (don't
even think of trying to stretch it that far), make for informative reading). All of these are interesting points; some
have been made before, and some are updated and
extended here. There are certainly some contentious ideas
among these which many workers will find difficult to
accept.
I separate my review into more mundane editorial material and material I think warrants discussion.
I think the manuscript could be shortened, and is in need
of editing for language. I recommend shortening the discussion of the term 'prokaryote', and think it is better to
incoporate one or two brief points into one of the other
sections, rather than devote an entire section to what is
fast becoming a rather tiresome semantic debate. The section 'Eukaryote gene promoters...' is, on the other hand,
so short as to be uninformative. Please either review this
material so that the general argument can be understood,
or delete it.
[Author's response: We have trimmed the paper in places, but,
on the other hand, we had to expand on some questions in order
to answer the various comments of the referees. As regards the
fallacies and pitfalls of the term "prokaryote", we think that it
is appropriate to maintain the core of the discussion as a separate item; we feel indeed that the matter is more than semantic,
as appears from P. Forterre' s comments also (see further). The
section on Eukaryotic promoters has been made more explicit].
Concerning the section on 'Paleochemistry', I have heard
that concern has been expressed by one of the authors of
the Brocks et al. study (ref 61) that the lanostane was a
contaminant. Tellingly, Brocks does not cite that original
paper in a recent review on using molecular biomarkers to
examine deep evolutionary history (Brocks & Pearson
2005, Reviews in Mineralogy & Geochemistry, 59:233–
258), but I have also heard that the contaminant verdict is
not universally shared by all authors. This verges on gossip, but it might be worth contacting the senior authors of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

that study (Brocks, Summons) to ask what their current
opinions are.
[Author's response: You are quite right as JJ Brocks himself confirmed to us and discussed in detail in a later study (new reference). We therefore rephrased our original discussion by
drawing attention to the current controversy and mentioning
Brocks'alternative interpretation of the presence of sterol biosynthetic pathways in several bacterial groups (horizontal
transfer from a protoeukaryote or early eukaryote into ancient
bacterial lineages)].
The section, 'Emergence of life, complexity and order'
seems a bit vague, and quite disconnected from the rest of
the manuscript. If it were my manuscript, I would cut this
section out.
[Author's response: We would however like to maintain this
section because we feel the necessity to bring together fields that
up to now seem to have developed almost in mutual ignorance.
We feel the concepts of catalytic closure and compositional
heredity place the emergence of life in a logical perspective;
moreover we think the community paradigm is not only useful
to explain the emergence of the code but also essential to understand how a pregenomic phase may have developed. Finally,
Lifson's refutation of S. Kauffman's model (ref 211) that has
been carried over in the literature appears to us inconclusive,
something that had to be stressed as well].
I now turn to the key ideas which I think warrant a
response.
For Glansdorff and colleagues, the puzzling gene distributions that many have attributed to horizontal gene transfer are better explained by differential loss of paralogues.
This, they argue, explains most incongruence between
phylogenetic trees. So, rather than rejecting the tree of life
outright on the basis of concluding that horizontal gene
transfer is far too prevalent (as some have recently advocated) these authors instead argue that their model (gene
loss) predicts the patchy distribution of genes and traits
that is observed.
This is a rather bold stance to take, and is interesting insofar as it represents the other end of the spectrum from the
proposal that there is no tree of life. Personally, I don't
subscribe to either extreme scenario, though there is certainly room for both mechanisms (i.e. gene loss and horizontal gene transfer). Glansdorff et al, while clearly
disliking the arguments in favour of extensive, ongoing
transfer, nevertheless concede that, in most cases, it would
be difficult to distinguish between loss or transfer. Indeed,
given that we have no good scheme for weighting the relative probabilities of multiple losses of cryptically paralogous functionally redundant genes versus distant gene

Page 21 of 35
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

transfers, this is true. For both mechanisms, there are good
examples, but the argument here is whether most cases
can be explained as being down to one mechanism or the
other. Confidence probably does run a bit on the high
side among some proponents of extensive horizontal
gene transfer, at least judging by some of the more
extreme statements that have been made in the recent literature, but is the other extreme any more informative?
[Author's response: We certainly do not want to give the
impression that we deny the occurrence of any horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) but the very wording of the title announcing
the section on LUCA genetic redundancy may have suggested
that we did; it has been amended to avoid any misunderstanding. The essence of our argumentation is that multiple losses of
paralogous gene copies present in the ancestral gene pool of the
LUCA community may be responsible for much of the incongruencies observed in genetic trees because it is a prediction. Moreover, the occurrence of duplications during intra domain
evolution is also expected to contribute. However, in much of
the literature dealing with phylogenetic incongruencies, HGT
has been the only explanation considered and those who advocated caution and restraint in this respect have found but little
echo. We therefore felt the necessity for some refocusing. Our
view is however not "extreme" in that it does not reject the
occurrence of HGT. Since however both you and P. Forterre felt
that our original formulation perhaps unduly minimized the
importance of HGT, we modified the text by mentioning a few
instances of interdomain HGT pointed at by Forterre in his
comments; these are instances where natural selection can be
invoked as a driving force (which is not the case for the plethora
of alleged HGTs), such as the contribution of reverse gyrase to
the emergence of hyperthermophily, something we already had
mphasized in a previous publication (ref 29). This however
does not detract from the view that such instances appear to be
rare and that many incongruencies could be more parsimoniously explained by differential loss of paralogues. We therefore
do not see ourselves as proponents of an extreme view; as you
point out, both mechanisms must have contributed to the
present situation but a conceptual readjustment appeared necessary].
It is in a sense an irony that the model Glansdorff et al.
present, which reads as being fairly hostile towards gene
transfer (at least between domains), is nevertheless
entirely dependent on it. By favouring Woese's scenario of
high rates of gene transfer prior to the emergence of the
three domains, Glansdorff et al. can have their cake (or in
their case, potato) and eat it too – a totipotent ancestral
community of genes but without the burgeoning genome
size. I will limit myself here to the following point: while
Woese's ideas have become popular, there really is no evidence for higher rates of gene transfer early (i.e. pre-three
domains). I for one have a hard time seeing how this scenario of one interconnected gene pool with uncon-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

strained gene transfer fits with our understanding of
biological systems. I am fine with gene transfer between
modern lineages, but less convinced that the hypothetical
scenario Woese proposes has any firm basis in biology
and likewise concerned that it is sufficiently vague as to
permit rather divergent interpretations. If we need to
accept one speculative scenario to accept the other, the
second can come down like a house of cards. Better then
to argue for a role for the mechanism of gene loss, though
not in this extreme manner. Seen in this light, their
description of the carbamoyltransferase dataset is useful,
but I think it might help if the authors were to address the
relevance of this single example of paralogous gene loss
more explicitly and in more detail; i.e. how much more of
the data do they think can be explained unambiguously as
losses? The authors do cite a handful of examples, but
those who argue for a significant role for horizontal transfer make bold statements, as embodied in the phrase, 'the
tree of one percent' coined by Dagan & Martin (2006;
Genome Biology 7:e118).
[Author's response: We see no contradiction in relying on
genetic promiscuity in the pre-domain era while considering
that lateral gene flow must have been considerably reduced
after the "crystallization" that generated the three Domains
from LUCA. Of course, later on, the development of mobile elements of various kinds must have allowed exchanges to occur
regularly, mostly between related members of the same
domains. But we stress that it is misleading (see text) to infer
the general amplitude of horizontal flow from the identification
of putative foreign (but mostly bacterial-like) genes in E. coli.
As already explained above, we do not want to appear as arguing for gene loss in an extreme, exclusive manner but we
emphasize that it is a prediction of the genetic redundancy of
the LUCA community. For the reasons exposed by Woese and
coworkers in ref 190, we are convinced by the necessity of a
communal phase preceding Domain divergence in order to
explain the emergence of a universal genetic code. It appears
much more appealing to conceive of such a development in a
promiscuous community, where eliminations of false starts, corrections, improvements and new combinations can proceed
under constant selection, rather than in an isolated cell line.
This could also be valid for the developments of other biological
systems. As regards the carbamoyltransferase data set used to
illustrate the model of differential gene loss, some additional
comments have been included. In fact, our early analysis (ref
29, 172, 173) pointed the way to the systematic identification
of paralogous gene copies in the LUCA community; this needs
to be followed up rather than ignored].
A novel proposal that Glansdorff et al. present is the idea
that LUCA (or some subpopulation of the 'community')
may have been nucleate. The implication here is that
LUCA possessed a nucleus, and that this was lost from the
archaea and bacteria, with a handful of lineages perhaps

Page 22 of 35
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

retaining this cellular architecture (notably the Planctomycetes). I certainly agree that some current explanations
for the origin of the nucleus are insufficient and have
myself published critiques of some of these recently. I also
agree that, formally, we cannot actually tell when the
nucleus arose, since we cannot readily distinguish
between multiple losses from an earlier ancestral nucleate
state and a single gain in the lineage leading to modern
eukaryotes. So, yes, it is entirely possible that LUCA had a
nucleus, but currently there is not a shred of evidence that
can be brought to bear on that possibility. I think that
Planctomycetes and other 'prokaryotic' lineages are fascinating, but until we can establish whether their internal
membrane structures are homologous or analogous to
those in eukaryotes, one cannot really use them as leverage to favour an ancestral nucleate LUCA. I get the impression that this is an ulterior motive behind the
paleochemistry section, i.e. citing the Pearson et al. paper
(ref. 63) on sterol synthesis in Planctomycetes. Again, I
am not so sure the data as they are can be used to argue for
vestigial traces of a protoeukaryote LUCA among the biology of modern planctomycetes. If there's one thing I
would like to know, it is the authors' opinion of the
model published by Devos et al. (2004; PLoS Biol
2:e380), which is, to my mind one of the most interesting
models for the origin of the nucleus, and should be
addressed in any discussion of the origins of this
organelle.
[Author's response: The possibility of a protonucleus in a RNA
LUCA is of course nothing more than a conjecture (as many
developments in this field) but, as mentioned in the text, it is
in keeping with Forterre's proposal on the emergence of DNA
genomes via the intervention of viruses and it seemed appropriate to present our view in the perspective of this heuristic theory.
As regards the interpretation of the Planctomycetes "nucleus"
your comments converge with those of P. Forterre since we can
not tell presently whether it is analogous or homologous to those
found in eukaryotes. There was in our previous version of this
manuscript some comments on this topic, which we have now
reintroduced to take this question into account. We are happy
to include a discussion of Devos et al, which we indeed feel is
particularly relevant and even illuminating. In fact,
Devos'model for the endogenous emergence of the nucleus and
the endocytotic apparatus by recruitments of particular protein
domains suggests how nuclei may have appeared in the protoeukaryote, perhaps even repeatedly (for example in Planctomycetes). It is of course also relevant to the origin of phagocytosis;
in fact, it makes this remarkable capacity appear definitely less
mysterious and, in our view, supports the notion that it emerged
early, perhaps already among the LUCA community, as argued
in the first version of this paper].
I do agree that some features of modern eukaryotes are
likely to resemble equivalent features in LUCA, and that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

some features of modern eukaryotes more closely resemble the ancestral state than do prokaryotic equivalents.
This is of course just normal pedestrian evolutionary biology, and, as Glansdorff et al. clearly state, Darwinian
thinking (i.e. not presuming, a priori, to know the ancestral state, and, accepting, that we cannot, a priori, ascertain in which lineages we might find the ancestral state, if
at all) is preferable to applying Lamarckian notions of
'progress'. However, I do not think this means that we can
necessarily extrapolate to other features of eukaryotes,
such that 'protoeukaryotes' become the ancestral state. In
this regard, I disagree with Glansdorff et al. in that I do not
see any evidence that LUCA (or some subpopulation) was
phagotrophic. Certainly, this is possible (and once again I
am in principle open to this possibility), but, as with the
nucleus, there is to my knowledge no evidence that can be
used to support such a contention.
[Author's response: See comments above].
The other ideas described in this paper, as summarised in
the conclusions as a set of 10 points, either draw from the
work of others, or from the authors' own published work,
and I think there is no need for me to comment particularly on this synthesis – I feel disinclined to critique the
critique, or advocate the advocacy (or the possible variants thereof), as I think it would largely just serve as a
reflection of my own opinions. Overall, I think this synthesis makes for interesting reading, though doubtless
there is something in here for everyone to disagree on –
such is the nature of the field!
Reviewers' report 2
Patrick Forterre, Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie, Université Paris-Sud, Orsay, France

In this paper, Glansdorff, Xu and Labedan synthesize,
update and summarize the state of the art concerning the
nature of LUCA, from the viewpoint favouring a rather
complex proto-eukaryotic LUCA. This viewpoint,
although at odd with most current thinking, is supported
by many arguments often overlooked in most evolutionary papers on early cellular evolution. The merit of this
paper is to explore this possibility in a very exhaustive
way. Being myself an early proponent of a proto-eukaryotic LUCA, I have of course a favourable prejudice for most
hypotheses presented here, and I strongly support publication of this paper.
A very important point made by the authors is that the
rooting of the universal tree in the bacterial branch does
not prevent a proto-eukaryotic like LUCA, since the
"prokaryotic" phenotype of Bacteria and Archaea might
have originated twice independently by streamlining
from the two different nodes of the universal tree. By the

Page 23 of 35
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

same reasoning, LUCA might also have been prokaryoticlike, even if the root turned out to be in the eukaryotic
branch. These are quite obvious remarks for someone
used to work with a correct evolutionary background, but
this is not so clear for most biochemists and molecular
biologists. I should confess that I have been myself misled
by the wrong idea that the bacterial rooting implied de
facto a prokaryotic-like LUCA. This, together with my old
prejudice for a proto-eukaryotic like LUCA, explains why
I scrutinize so deeply the data supporting the bacterial
rooting. This is not to say that solution of the rooting
problem is not important, but in any case, it will not solve
the problem of the nature of LUCA (except if the root
turned out to be within one of the three domains, something highly unlikely). The great challenge is to polarize
the characters that are common to Archaea and Eukaryotes, are they primitive or shared derived traits? In the
absence of an outgroup, this is a very difficult task.
There are other mistakes currently made in the interpretation of phylogenetic trees and the authors make one of
them (a very classical one) when they conclude that the
hypothesis of an hyperthermophilic ancestor for bacteria
has been weakened when the positions of hyperthermophilic bacteria (Aquifex, Thermotoga) as the two earliest
branching lineages in the bacterial tree have been put into
question. This is based on the wrong assumption that the
phenotype of a modern organism was already present at
the base of the lineage leading to this particular organism.
This assumption is safe only if several basal lineages share
this phenotype. For instance, the hypothesis that the last
common ancestor of Archaea was a hyperthermophile
was for a long time supported by the fact that all basal
archaeal lineages were ONLY populated by hyperthermophiles. In contrast, Aquifex and Thermotoga belong to
phyla that also include mesophiles and moderate thermophiles, such as Geotoga or Hydrogenobacter. As a consequence, even if these phylaare the two earliest bacterial
branches (which is probably not the case) this would not
automatically lead to the conclusion that the last common bacterial ancestor was a hyperthermophile. Similarly, it seems now that the first basal branch of the
archaeal tree lead to mesophilic (even psychrophilic)
archaea (ref in the manuscript), but this does not imply
that the last common ancestors was mesophiles or psychrophiles
[Author's response: You are of course perfectly right and we
hope to have cured the text of any misleading statements in this
respect].
I agree with Carl Woese, Norman Pace and the authors
that the term prokaryote is misleading. The authors refute
the proposal of Koonin and colleagues to base the term
prokaryote on the translation/traduction (TT) coupling,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

because some uncoupled TT should occur in bacterium of
the phylum Planctomyces, such as Gemmata obsuriglobus,
in which DNA is separated by a nuclear-like membrane
from most ribosomes. This is a weak argument, because
TT coupling could occur in the nuclear compartment of G.
obsuriglobus which also contains ribosomes (Fuerst, 2005).
For me, the TT coupling cannot be used as a positive trait
to group Archaea and Bacteria, because we don't know if
the TT coupling is a convergent or a homologous trait,
and, in the latter case, if the TT coupling is an ancestral or
a shared derived character. Only in the last case, the TT
coupling could be considered as a synapomorphy, eventually justifying a common name for Archaea and Bacteria.
[Author's response: We agree that the mere mention of a
nucleus-like structure in Gemmata is only a weak argument
and we refer to your precisions in the modified text].
Finally, as noted by the authors, the term prokaryote
(before the nucleus) is not neutral since, it gives the false
impression that the ancestral nature of prokaryote is well
established. I suggested once to use the neutral term
akaryote (without nucleus) if one really want a name to
distinguish Archaea and Bacteria from Eukaryotes on a
structural basis (Forterre, 1992 [Forterre, P. Neutral terms.
Nature, 1992, 335, 305]). In that case, most bacteria
would be indeed akaryotes, except those, like Gemmata
obsuriglobus and Poribacteria, which are synkaryotes (with
a nucleus) and not eukaryotes (to say that a G. obscuriglobus is a eukaryotic bacterium would be probably confusing).
[Author's response: Again, we agree; a new nomenclature is
badly needed to avoid current misconceptions].
The problem of the origin of the nucleus of Planctomycetes is probably too much emphasized by the authors
(and sometimes ambiguously) as possibly homologous
to the eukaryotic nucleus (i.e. they share a common ancestry) and testifying for the situation in LUCA. There is presently no indication that the nucleus of some
Planctomycetes is homologous to our nucleus. It should
be mentioned that, if all Planctomycetes have a system of
internal cytoplasmic membranes, the intracytoplasmic
membrane (ICM), only Gemmata species have a true
nucleus (i.e. an invagination of the ICM that separates the
nucleoid from a portion of the cytoplasm that contains
ribosomes) (Fuerst, 2005 [Fuerst, JA. Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes. Annu Rev Microbiol.
2005, 59, 299–328]). The nucleus of Gemmata obscuriglobus thus could be a recent invention in Planctomycetales.
It will be especially important indeed to solve this question in studying extensively the nucleus of Planctomycetes
and Poribacteria. For me, the discovery of these bacterial
nuclei indicates that the formation of such structure might

Page 24 of 35
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

have occurred several times independently in the course
of evolution. In any case, it is quite fascinating to consider
the similarities between bacterial and eukaryotic nuclei, in
both cases the nuclear membrane is produced by the
recruitment of an internal cytoplasmic membrane system,
the ICM and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.
[Author's response: Our presentation of the Planctomycetes was
indeed biased in the sense that we did not explicitly mention the
notion that the nucleus of Gemmata is not necessarily homologous to the eukaryotic one. In a previous version of the draft
there was a section dealing with this problematic; in keeping
with your comments and those of Dr Poole, we have reintroduced these considerations in the present version].
The authors suggest that RNA-cells themselves might have
had a nucleus. I think this is a real possibility and, by the
way, RNA nuclei still exist today. In a recent review, Miller
and Krijnse-Locker (2008) [Miller, S. and Krijnse-Locker,
J. Modification of intracellular membrane structures for
virus replication. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2008, 6, 363–374]
remind us how modern RNA viruses recruit membranes
and vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to form viral
factories in which their replication apparatus is surrounded by one or two membrane layers, with an opercule for communication with the cytoplasm (pore?) (a
true RNA nucleus!). I think therefore likely that both
akaryotic and synkaryotic RNA-cells were present in the
RNA world.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

For me the spliceosome (not the nuclear membrane) is
the real hallmark of the domain Eukarya. All Eukarya have
spliceosomes and it is absent from all Archaea and all Bacteria. Furthermore, it really points to the heart of the gene
expression mechanisms. I would suggest renaming the
domain Eukarya to Splicea and corresponding cells to
spliceotes, instead of eukaryotes. Indeed, it's a very
anthropocentric view to consider that our nucleus is the
true (eu) nucleus. Does this means that G. obscuriglobus is
a false or incomplete nucleus? I would thus say that Spliceotes and the bacterium G. obscuriglobus are two syncaryotes that belong to different domains with nuclei. At our
present state of knowledge, these nuclei might be either
homologous or analogous. I would like to read the comment of the authors on this nomenclature question. They
might have ideas of better names?
[Author's response: In our manuscript we only focused on the
problems raised by the term "prokaryote" but of course, if we
want to drop it, it is the very duality "prokaryote-eukaryote"
that is brought into question and the nomenclature you propose
would be an adequate and radical departure from the present
situation].

On page 5, the authors state that "the fact that the eukaryotic
cell is more complex than modern prokaryotic cell is largely the
result of the endosymbiosis (of mitochondria) not of a basic
trend". I don't think this is correct. I would say that it is
because the proto-eukaryotic cells were already more
complex than modern akaryotes (in particular capable of
phagocytosis) that they have been able to enslave a bacterium to become progressively a modern eukaryotes. The
more complex and mysterious part of the eukaryotic gene
expression machinery is the spliceosome and I don't think
that it emerged as the result of endosymbiosis. Indeed, as
the authors notice themselves, it should have take a long
time for the emergence of a complex spliceosome, refuting the idea of the sudden origin of spliceosomes from
group II introns shortly after the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. This is for me a very convincing argument. Also
why group I introns present in archaeal and bacterial
genomes did not invade the eukaryotic nucleus?

Coming back to LUCA, the authors mention the paper of
Delaye et al., on the monophyletic origin of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) as an argument for a LUCA with a
DNA genome. Delaye et al have missed the point here.
There are three classes of RNR and they are distributed in
the three domains in such way that none of them is universal. It is therefore possible that RNR were introduced
later on (from viruses??) in the different lineages. Of
course, one, two or the three RNR might have been
present in LUCA (or in its community see below) and differentially lost thereafter, but this is only hypothetical and
cannot guaranty us that LUCA had a DNA genome. By the
way, the question of the real monophyly of the RNR activity is still an open question. The three classes of RNR are
built around the same homologous core and use basically
the same reaction mechanism, but they share this characteristic with pyruvate formate lyase (Stubbe, 2000 [Stubbe
J. Ribonucleotide reductases: the link between an RNA
and a DNA world? Curr Opin Struct Biol. 2000, 10, 731–
736]), and the core itself cannot have RNR activity. In
each class, the RNR activity is obtained by association of
this core with different protein folds, domains or subunits, and the use of different cofactors. As a consequence,
one cannot exclude the possibility that the RNR activity
has been invented three times independently, using the
same basic protein core, misleading us to believe that RNR
activities are homologous.

[Author's response: This is a useful remark indeed; we have
taken it into account in the present version].

I like very much how the authors discuss the problem of
the temperature at which LUCA was living. In particular,
the idea that one should take into account the notion of
temperature range is welcome, as well as their critic of the
Gaucher et al paper. All present data indeed support the
notion of a mesophilic or moderately thermophilic LUCA
and a secondary adaptation to Archaea and some Bacteria
to hyperthermophily. The authors emphasize adaptation
to hyperthermophily as the major selection pressure for
the formation of the archaeal domain by thermoreduction. The question is more open now, with the discovery
of the basal position of mesophilic Thaumarchaea and
one cannot exclude that archaeal lipids originated in a
mesophilic environment, but turned out to be well suited
to allow some Archaea to explore rapidly the hottest environments. The replacement of ester bonds by ether bonds
and the formation of monolayer lipids is indeed favoured
by high temperature, but I don't see what selection pressure favoured sn2,3 versus sn1,2 lipids at high temperature. I would like very much to read the comment of the
authors on this point. By the way, we possibly focus too
much on the relationships between the two kinds of glycerolipids now present in the biosphere, it might be that
the variety of lipids was much higher before and at the
time of LUCA, and that the two types of lipids that we
know have been selected randomly because they were
those present in the three successful lineages at the origin
of the modern domains. Anyway, I agree with the authors
that it would be important to do experimental works on
this issue by engineering new organisms with mixed lipids
for instance.
[Author's response: Indeed, the primary divide between sn1,2
and sn2,3 lipids may not be the direct result of selection. However, what we suggest was selected for in the course of adaptation to high temperatures was the recruitment of isoprenoid
lipids and their ether linkage to a glycerol phosphate molecule.
This almost certainly did not happen simultaneously and in the
revised version we propose a more detailed scenario where isoprenoids (an ubiquitous type of molecule) were brought into the
formation of membranes in a first step, to be followed by the formation of an ether bridge and then by the introduction of the
sn2,3 conformation as a consequence of known properties of
GGGPS. Perhaps there was (or still exists somewhere?) a membrane with ester isoprenoid lipids linked to G3P and/or ether
isoprenoid lipids linked to G3P. The point we wanted to stress
was that selection has probably been at work, a notion that is
supported by the presence of ether bonds in both Archaea and
thermophilic Bacteria. A salient point about our scenario is that
interesting evolutionary experiments could be carried out with
GGGPS].
The authors are dubious about the hypothesis proposed
by several evolutionists of mixed membranes in LUCA,
with both sn2,3 and sn1,2 lipids made by a non enantio-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

specific enzyme. The concept of a "non enantio-specific
enzyme" is strange for me, and to my knowledge, has
never been really discussed. In my opinion, as soon as you
have a catalyst using a three-dimensional active site, you
have no choice other than to select only one enantiomer
for substrate and the product will be also enantio-selective. As a consequence, I don't think that non enantio-specific protein enzyme or ribozyme ever existed! The
emergence of 3D catalysts explains indeed very simply
why all protein amino-acids and nucleic acid sugars are of
one enantiomeric form. Again, I would really like to read
the comment of the authors on this question.
[Author's response: We could not agree more; stereospecificity
is a salient feature of enzymes, even if some exceptions are
known; this comment has now been elaborated upon in the
text].
I completely agree with the authors that the importance of
LGT has been over emphasized, and that the notion of a
web of life instead of a tree of life is misleading. However,
although there was certainly a relatively high level of
redundancy in LUCA and its companions (as in modern
organisms), I have the feeling that the authors tend to go
too far in refuting the existence of LGT between domains.
They are many clear-cut evidences for such transfers. They
are indeed rare and usually easy to detect through phylogenetic analyses, so that they cannot confuse species tree
when analyses are properly done. The rarity of LGT
between domains is well illustrated by the quasi-absence
of exchange between archaeal Topo VI and bacterial Topo
IV, two enzymes that have exactly the same catalytic activities. Only three out of more than 500 sequenced bacterial
genomes have acquired an archaeal Topo VI, and none of
the presently archaeal genomes has a bacterial Topo IV.
Although rare, LGT exist and can be easily identified (the
three Topo VI found in Archaea branch within Archaea in
Topo VI trees, whereas the DNA gyrase found in Archaea
branch within the bacterial sequences in DNA gyrase
trees). Furthermore, they can have a profound influence
in the history of a particular lineage. For instance, the
transfer of reverse gyrase from Archaea to some bacteria
has probably helped their adaptation to extremely high
temperature whereas the transfer of gyrase from Bacteria
to some archaea has profoundly changed the internal
topology of their DNA. Therefore, in my opinion, one
should have a more balanced view than the authors on
the importance of LGT versus paralogy/loss in global evolution and more work is required to evaluate the relative
importance of these two phenomena. I think for instance
that paralogy/loss is overemphasized in the work of
Ouzounis and colleagues leading to a LUCA with 1000
gene families.

[Author's response: As already explained in our answer to Dr
Poole, we do not wish to trace all phylogenetic incongruencies
to loss of paralogues and we do not deny the occurrence of LGT
(or HGT) but, as one of us already mentioned in a previous
paper (ref 29), we stress that assuming an interdomain LGT
(rare as you also emphasize) does not gain much credibility
from the mere occurrence of a phylogenetic anomaly but well
from the possibility of selection, such as in the case of reverse
gyrase. Our view is in fact epistemologically "balanced" in the
sense that it emphasizes an hypothesis (loss of paralogues) that
has been systematically neglected even though it is a prediction.
In other words it needs to be "falsified" rather than neglected].
Paradoxically, although the authors are strong critics of
the overwhelming-LGT theory, they have adopted the
viewpoint of a communal LUCA which, historically, has
been proposed partly to take into account this theory (see
Woese [Woese CR. Interpreting the universal phylogenetic
tree. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000: 97, 8392–8396]). I am
not convinced, as the authors are, by the heuristic character of the concept of LUCA as a community of organisms.
If cell divided by fission from the time of LUCA, one is
obliged to accept the existence of a single organism as the
LUCA, as we are obliged to accept from population
genetic the idea of a single women (the African Eve) at the
origin of all women present on Earth today. Of course,
LUCA was not living alone at that time (as the African eve
herself) but among many other organisms that have no
descendants today. Therefore LUCA was living among a
community (that we can possibly call the LUCA community) but this community (Eve's village) should not be
confused with LUCA itself. Unlike the authors, I thus definitely think that LUCA has been an identifiable cell line.
For me, the community concept is only helpful to fight
the very naïve idea that LUCA was the only cell at that
time!!! Since LUCA was not the first cell, it could not have
been alone. The community concept can be misleading
because – associated to the "overwhelming LGT" theory –
it can lead to the conclusion that all members of this community were quite similar to each other, exchanging genes
as crazy (mimicking an ideal Hippy community). On the
contrary, the authors make a good point in describing a
quite diverse LUCA community, with various organisms
using different metabolism and more generally different
ways of life (possibly with both akaryotic and synkaryotic
RNA or primitive DNA cells of various sizes). One thing I
would like to add in the debate is that I see no reason why
the contemporaries of LUCA should have been confined
to a limited location on our planet (a single chimney in
the more extreme scenario). All complex RNA and/or
primitive DNA cells (with their viruses) living at the time
of LUCA might have already colonized all the habitable
biotopes of our planet, much like modern microbes,
forming many diverse communities, only one of them
including LUCA. They were probably limited or no

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

exchange at some time between isolated communities,
leading to speciation and later conflict in future encounter. Again, one can draw a parallel with the village of Eve,
which was probably surrounded by other villages in a particular region of Africa and many more in all Eurasia.
[Author's response: Your comments go straight at the heart of
the matter! We are however wary of too close a comparison
between LUCA and the "African Eve" because of the biological
constraints of human sexuality and also because of possible misconceptions. Several geneticists (see for ex de Duve in "Singularities"ref 94) have pointed out that "Eve" was not the only
woman to bear children who are ancestors of living people
(their nuclear genes are still with us); the concept only illustrates a bottleneck of direct female ancestry passing through one
individual. Besides, the time of the common ancestor of all
males is quite different. Also, within the community of human
geneticists, there is no agreement regarding the possible occurrence of interbreeding between the ancestors of H. sapiens sapiens with other groups of humans, even after the bottleneck.
Coming back to LUCA, we agree that it must have existed as a
particular cell line at the time of the major transition that gave
rise to the first Domain but if the latter emerged in a very promiscuous community, it must have been the product of an
untold number of genetic exchanges and it is conceivable that
it was the result of a relatively short evolutionary « crisis »;
today there is probably no situation anymore where the dynamics of evolutionary change is as powerful and as rapid as it may
have been at the time of LUCA. We have included some comments to that effect in the revised version.
As already stressed in our answer to Dr Poole we feel very much
in favour of Woese's community concept to explain the emergence of the code and of other basic biological systems; only
thereafter could well defined, genealogically identifiable lineages have emerged as the result of both selection and drift,
becoming more and more restricted in their possibilities of
genetic exchange (Woese's "crystallization"). It is of course possible that during this period of increasing individualization,
some important features were still exchanged, but we are definitely questioning the persistence of interdomain promiscuity
after this stage. There is, by the way, some inconsistency in
assuming both the occurrence of Domain "crystallization" and
"widespread, indiscriminate" post-crystallization HGT of aminoacyl tRNA synthase genes (Woese et al.2000, 64:202 and
ref 2). We are happy to note that you have no objection to the
concept of a phenotypically diversified LUCA community containing phagocytic organisms (see our answer to Dr Poole
regarding Devos' model for the emergence of the nucleus and
the endocytotic apparatus)].
I agree with the authors that Darwinian evolution operated early on, well before LUCA and the origin of the three
Domains. The notion of a Darwinian threshold can be
interpreted as opening the way for a Lamarkian view of

Page 27 of 35
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

early evolution (usually favoured by astrophysicists and
chemists who are often dominant in number in the origin
of life community). The authors should be aware that the
notion of a "communal LUCA" can have the same effect,
if one envisions the evolution of this community driven
by an internal tendency for matter to evolve towards complex structures under physical principles that remains to
be discovered. Physical principles can create the framework for biological evolution, but the motor will remain
descendent modifications with natural selection.
[Author's response: The "communal LUCA" concept has indeed
raised some caveats (see for example de Duve in "Singularities"ref 94) and this is the reason why we have stressed the
importance of natural selection as an unavoidable process. This
would remain true even if there were "an internal tendency for
matter to evolve towards complex structures under physical
principles that remain to be discovered"; S. Kauffman (34) has
shown how, in theory, the spontaneous formation of ordered
structures would be submitted to natural selection in a way that
is bound to create novelty and further structuration when selection operates at the border of chaos; in this very heuristic and
penetrating theory, the role of natural selection remains absolutely determinant].
Finally, since the authors often refer to the "three RNA
cells-three DNA viruses (3R/3V) hypothesis", I will say
that more recently, I tend to come back to a simpler "two
RNA cells-two DNA viruses hypothesis (2R/2V)". For me,
the interest of the 3R/3V hypothesis was to explain the
existence of three well defined versions of ribosomal and
other universal proteins, and also to explain some critical
differences between the DNA replication apparatus of
Archaea and Splicea (Eukarya), in particular their very different sets of DNA topoisomerases). The last point has
been weakened by several recent findings suggesting that
Topo VI and Topo IB could have been possibly already
present in the common ancestor of Archaea and Splicea
(Malik et al., 2007 [Malik SB, Ramesh MA, Hulstrand AM,
Logsdon JM Jr. Protist homologs of the meiotic Spo11
gene and topoisomerase VI reveal an evolutionary history
of gene duplication and lineage-specific loss. Mol Biol Evol.
2007, 24, 2827–2841], Brochier-Armanet, Gribaldo and
Forterre, manuscript in preparation). In the same vein, we
have recently discovered that a universal protein of
unknown function highly similar in Archaea and Splicea
(Eukarya) is a new type of apurinic endonuclease (Hecker
et al., 2007 [Hecker A, Leulliot N, Gadelle D, Graille M,
Justome A, Dorlet P, Brochier C, Quevillon-Cheruel S, Le
Cam E, van Tilbeurgh H, Forterre P. An archaeal orthologue of the universal protein Kae1 is an iron metalloprotein which exhibits atypical DNA-binding properties and
apurinic-endonuclease activity in vitro. Nucleic Acids Res.
2007, 35, 6042–51]). We have also obtained in silico evidences for the existence of an ancient regulatory mecha-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

nism coupling DNA replication and translation in
Archaea and Splicea (Berthon et al., 2008 [Berthon J,
Cortez D, Forterre P. Genomic context analysis in Archaea
suggests previously unrecognized links between DNA replication and translation. Genome Biol. 2008: 9, R71]). All
these new findings point that the last common ancestor of
Archaea and Splicea had a DNA genome. In the 2R/2V scenario, the independent RNA-DNA transition in bacteria
and in a common ancestor to Archaea and Splicea could
explain the more dramatic difference between the bacterial and the archaeal/spliceal versions of universal proteins, compared to the differences observed between the
archaeal and the spliceal version. Note that in the 2R/2V
scenario, the root of the universal tree of life should be
located in the bacterial branch! So I could become finally
a proponent of this idea that I have been previously fighting. This explains why I especially appreciate the comment of the authors on the compatibility between the
bacterial rooting and a proto-eukaryotic like LUCA.
[Author's response: We have taken good note of this breakthrough in the revised version {see ref 44}].
Reviewers' report 3
Nicolas Galtier, Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution, Université
Montpellier 2, France

This article reviews many aspects relevant to early stages of
life on earth, focusing on the nature of LUCA, the last universal common ancestor. In summary, the authors claim/
argue/suggest that:
- LUCA had introns and a splicing machinery
- LUCA had a nucleus
- eukaryotes emerged through phagocytosis, not fusion
- LUCA was not hyperthermophilic
- LUCA possessed a membran of the "sn1,2" (like in bacteria and eukaryotes), not "sn2,3" type
- LUCA was metabolically and genetically complex
- bacteria and archaea used to undergo reductive evolution
- most phylogenetic incongruences are explained by differential losses, not horizontal gene transfer
The overall picture is radically different from the prevailing view of a prokaryote-like LUCA with small-sized
genome. Not all of these proposals are new, of course.
This is more like an update over previous reviews by some

Page 28 of 35
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

of these authors. Recent literature makes them even more
confident in their favourite "ancestral eukaryote" theory.
I found the paper fascinating with many respects:
- The topic is great. It is difficult to imagine a more fundamental (I mean, less applied) issue in biological sciences.
Unraveling the origins of life is an appealing problem per
se; nobody really cares, but everybody would like to
know. I highly respect those of us who decide to devote
their life to this useless, perhaps unreacheable goal.
- The bibliographic survey is thorough. Very useful. Nothing important is left apart. I learned much by reading this
piece.
- Strong opinions are formulated (although we are talking
about the biology of an organism which lived billions
years ago). Quite stimulating.
- The form of the manuscript is unusual – a long, provocative review/opinion. I thank Biology Direct for letting
such non-standard contributions be published.
I cannot comment on each and every point made by the
authors, first because I am not enough qualified, and secondly because it would make the whole reading boring. I
will focus on two general issues which I think most
deserve to be debated.
1. Everything shared is ancestral?
Many of the developped arguments start from reporting
shared cellular or genetic elements between extant species
throughout the 3 domains of life, and conclude that these
elements were already present in LUCA. Such elements
include the nucleus (a nuclear-like structure has been discovered in Planctomyces, a bacterium), introns, (including self-splicing introns), and many genes found in
several copies in extant genomes. The authors favour
ancestral complexity followed by differential losses, rather
than multiple inventions and/or horizontal gene transfers.
I think this view is highly respectable, but I must say I
found the arguments (in favour of either hypothesis) not
so strong. The fact that, for some gene phylogenies, several
lineages trace back very early in evolution (earlier than the
bacterial and archaeal ancestors) does not imply, I think,
that these genes were duplicated in the genome of LUCA
– Zhaxybayeva & Gogarten (2004 TIG), for instance, interpret this pattern in a very distinct way. Well, this depends
much on what we call LUCA – see below comment 2.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

[Author's response: As you say, much depends on the assumptions made regarding the nature of LUCA. The paper by Zhaxybayeva and Gogarten that you refer to focuses on HGT and,
from a qualitative point of view, we certainly agree with their
main conclusion that "contributions of vertical inheritance and
HGT are not the same across the tree of life". They make a passing allusion to paralogy as an alternative to HGT but they do
not address our specific point, i.e deep ancestral paralogy as a
predicted source of phylogenetic incongruencies. In elaborating
our conception of LUCA, we have clearly been influenced by the
"community" concept of Kandler and Woese (op cit) but also
by a number of considerations regarding, the origin of the splicing machinery, the origin of thermophily, an urge to discuss the
unwarranted assumption that everything evolves from simple to
complex (cfr the ideas of SJ Gould and S. Kauffman, op cit),
the no less unwarranted assumption that phylogenetic incongruencies are incontrovertible evidence of HGT at all levels of
evolution and that the identification in a prokaryote of a gene
homologous to a eukaryotic protein (such as actin or tubulin
and many others) indicates that these prokaryotic versions
should be regarded as ancestral rather than supposing their
emergence in a protoeukaryotic ancestor. We have presented
these considerations as a bundle of converging arguments. Certainly, much remains conjectural and some of our views clearly
are provocative but we feel there is enough ground to consider
them as an alternative to current thinking on the alleged
"prokaryote to eukaryote" transition].
I note, furthermore, that some of the scenarios proposed
by the authors require a fairly large number of independent losses. For instance, it is suggested that the bacterium
which entered in endosymbiosis with a protoeukaryote,
and eventually became the mitochondrion, could have
not yet lost introns (inherited from LUCA). But this mitochondrial ancestor is well identified as an alpha-proteobacterium. Supposing that introns were present in the
entire lineage linking LUCA to this organism would imply
a very large number of independent losses of introns in
bacteria (when not a single bacterial group kept them).
This remark also applies to the authors' proposal of ancestral nucleus and introns, subsequently lost by bacteria and
archaea. By relying on the observation of nucleus-like
structures in several prokaryotes (if I understand corectly),
the authors's scenario implies a large number of losses of
the nucleus. I note, however, that no "modern" eukaryote
has ever lost the nucleus, although many of them have
undergone reductive genome evolution (eg Microsporidians). If the phyletic distribution of nuclear-like structures
is patchy, then assuming a homologous relationship
between these forms appears little parsimonious, knowing that losing the nucleus is apparently not so common
(at least for a eukaryote).

Biology Direct 2008, 3:29

[Author's response: Assuming extensive gene loss during emergence of certain lineages is indeed emphasized in our presentation; if the old idea of emergence of Bacteria and Archaea by
"streamlining" of a more sophisticated ancestor is correct, it
must have involved extensive gene loss indeed. Even among
Eukarya, various instances of extensive evolutionary simplifications are known (see the flatworms, already mentioned, or the
relative rarity of introns in eukaryotes with a prokaryotic life
style, such as yeast). However we agree we have overstated the
case regarding the fate of the nucleus by not discussing the alternative interpretation of independent occurrence of nuclei in different cell lines (the question of homology between the
eukaryotic nucleus and that of Gemmata). This point has also
been raised by Dr Poole and Dr Forterre and has been taken
into account in the present version].
2. LUCA "community": what does it mean?
At several places in the manuscript, the authors evoke the
LUCA "population" or "community". The two words have
distinct definitions in the evolutionary literature: a population is a group of individuals from the same species, a
community a group of ecologically related species. That
these two terms are taken are synonymous is probably to
be connected to the authors' (and others') conception of
a weak or absent species structure at the time of LUCA: the
3 domains of life would have "crystallized" from a "communal population".
I must say I disagree with this view. I do not see any reason
to believe that genetic evolution proceeded differently
before vs. after the origins of modern bacteria, archaea
and eukaryotes (which, by the way, did probably not
occur simultaneously). The existence of species, i.e. entities such that genetic exchanges are much less frequent
between than within, appears universal across current biodiversity, probably as a consequence of the existence of
distinct, discrete ecological niches. Why would have it
been different in the past?
[Author's response: The main reason to think that the mode of
genetic evolution was different in the era of LUCA {and
before} from what it is now, is the assumption of genetic promiscuity between primitive cells presented originally by Kandler
and Woese (op cit); however, to avoid possible confusions, we
took some pain to emphasize that this idea in no way (at least
in our mind) undermines the critical and unavoidable role of
natural selection at all stages of biological evolution. In our
answer to Dr Forterre we emphasize the contribution of S.
Kauffman in this respect].
If we assume that "standard" species existed at the time of
LUCA, then we must chose between the two terms, population or community. It seems to me that the high level of
ancestral genetic, metabolic and ecologic diversity sug-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/29

gested by the manuscript (e.g., both mesophilic and thermophilic individuals) is not compatible with a single
LUCA species – the word "community" should therefore
be favoured. Now calling LUCA a "diversified community
of species" appears to me equivalent to saying that the distribution of genetic and metabolic diversity across extant
species was influenced by horizontal gene transfers
between various ancestral species: several ancestors contributed to current collective gene pool. So perhaps the
"ancestral redundancy" and "horizontal gene transfer"
hypothesis discussed by the authors are not so contradictory.
[Author's response: We have indeed used the words "population" and "community" as synonyms as far as LUCA was concerned but, in order to avoid possible confusions, we agree that
the word "community" should prevail. On the other hand, our
view certainly does not present LUCA as a single species nor as
a diversified community of species, since, following Woese, we
do not think standard (Darwinian) species existed at the time
of LUCA. To use Kandler's words ", we see LUCA as a "multiphenotypic community" of cells, not endowed with the clear-cut
differences maintained by genetic barriers that we see in modern lineages, because of the promiscuity assumed to have
reigned at the time. To use your words, in such a community
"several ancestors contributed to the current collective gene
pool" so that "ancestral redundancy" and "horizontal gene
transfer" were indeed not contradictory. However, if we do
envisage that HTG was widespread at the time of LUCA, we
would never consider it as ever having been "indiscriminate"
(see Woese et al on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, Microbiol
Mol Biol Rev 2000 64:202–236) since the outcome of gene
exchanges, however widespread it may have been at this early
time, always remained determined by natural selection].
