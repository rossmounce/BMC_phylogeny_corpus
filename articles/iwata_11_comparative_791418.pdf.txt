Comparative analysis of information contents
relevant to recognition of introns in many species
Hiroaki Iwata1, Osamu Gotoh1,2*

Abstract
Background: The basic process of RNA splicing is conserved among eukaryotic species. Three signals (5’ and 3’
splice sites and branch site) are commonly used to directly conduct splicing, while other features are also related
to the recognition of an intron. Although there is experimental evidence pointing to the significant species
specificities in the features of intron recognition, a quantitative evaluation of the divergence of these features
among a wide variety of eukaryotes has yet to be conducted.
Results: To better understand the splicing process from the viewpoints of evolution and information theory, we
collected introns from 61 diverse species of eukaryotes and analyzed the properties of the nucleotide sequences
relevant to splicing. We found that trees individually constructed from the five features (the three signals, intron
length, and nucleotide composition within an intron) roughly reflect the phylogenetic relationships among the
species but sometimes extensively deviate from the species classification. The degree of topological deviation of
each feature tree from the reference trees indicates the lowest discordance for the 5’ splicing signal, followed by
that for the 3’ splicing signal, and a considerably greater discordance for the other three features. We also
estimated the relative contributions of the five features to short intron recognition in each species. Again,
moderate correlation was observed between the similarities in pattern of short intron recognition and the
genealogical relationships among the species. When mammalian introns were categorized into three subtypes
according to their terminal dinucleotide sequences, each subtype segregated into a nearly monophyletic group,
regardless of the host species, with respect to the 5’ and 3’ splicing signals. It was also found that GC-AG introns
are extraordinarily abundant in some species with high genomic G + C contents, and that the U12-type
spliceosome might make a greater contribution than currently estimated in most species.
Conclusions: Overall, the present study indicates that both splicing signals themselves and their relative
contributions to short intron recognition are rather susceptible to evolutionary changes, while some poorly
characterized properties seem to be preserved within the mammalian intron subtypes. Our findings may afford
additional clues to understanding of evolution of splicing mechanisms.

Background
The intron is a nucleotide sequence that is transcribed
from the genome but finally removed in the process of
maturation of the transcribed RNA. The process of
intron removal is called RNA splicing. Nuclear (or spliceosomal) introns are abundant in most eukaryotes and
are processed by the machinery known as spliceosomes.
In this article, we confine our attention to this type of

intron. Other types of introns, known as Group I and
Group II introns, are present in some archaea, bacteria,
viruses, and plant and fungal organelles and are processed by auto-catalytic machineries [1]. Under normal
circumstances, splicing occurs only between the 5’ and
3’ ends of the intron on the same transcript, although
exceptional trans-splicing is also observed in some
organisms [2]. The basic process of splicing is conserved
among eukaryotic species. Three signals, the 5’ splice
site (5’ss), the 3’ splice site (3’ss) and the branch point
(BP), are commonly used to directly conduct splicing
[3,4]. Another characteristic sequence is the polypyrimidine tract (PPT) that is located between BP and 3’ss,

and is rich in pyrimidine bases. BP lies at less than dozens of nucleotides upstream of the PPT sequence. BP
provides the means by which 3’ss is identified. In addition, broadly distributed exonic and intronic splicing
enhancers/silencers are also involved in the correct
recognition and regulation of a particular pair of 5’ss
and 3’ss to be spliced. Besides these signal sequences
that are directly involved in splicing, other features are
also related to intron recognition, including intron
length and nucleotide composition within the intron [5].
Although the basic ability of eukaryotes to splice
introns has remained conserved throughout evolution
[6-9], the splicing signals have considerably differentiated [10-12], eventually to the degree that the splicing
mechanisms of remotely related organisms are incompatible with each other. For example, animal introns are
not properly recognized in transfected plant cells
[13,14]. Similarly, most mammalian introns are not
recognized by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[15,16]. It is naturally hypothesized that the incompatibility is due to disparate changes in the splicing signals
and their corresponding splicing factors. For example,
PPT, which is recognized by U2AF 65 protein factor,
shows highly variable lengths and signal strengths
among species; although there is a certain bias for pyrimidines toward the 3’ end of the intron among all
organisms, this signal is weak among most fungi, stronger in plants and protozoans, and by far the strongest in
vertebrates [17]. It is also known that the BP signal
recognized by SF1 protein factor is highly conserved in
yeast but variable in higher eukaryotes, although eukaryotes have a preference for purines or pyrimidines at
each position and retain the target “A” nucleotide [6,18].
It is important to investigate the conservation and variation of features relevant to splicing throughout the
evolution of eukaryotes from two points of view. First, it
provides us fundamental knowledge of the evolution of
this very complicated cellular process that involves
many factors and their recognition sites. Second, the
quantitative characterization of these features is indispensable for the development of accurate and efficient
computational tools for gene recognition from the genomic sequence [19-21]. A few studies have been conducted along these lines [12,22] with a relatively small
number of species. However, more comprehensive studies on a much wider range of eukaryotic taxa are now
feasible as many sequences of complete or nearly complete genomes together with their transcripts have
become available.
In this study, we characterized and analyzed splicing
signals in 61 eukaryotic species. First, we analyzed the
evolutionary relationships of individual splicing features.
We found that the five evolutionary trees thus constructed (feature trees) roughly reflect the phylogenetic

Page 2 of 17

relationships among the species but sometimes extensively deviate from the species tree. Second, we measured the relative contributions of the five splicing
features to recognize correct splicing pairs of short
introns by means of a method similar to that used by
Lim and Burge [5]. By comparing the relative contributions of these splicing features, we determined similarities in the short intron recognition pattern among the
61 species. The results again show that there is some
correlation between the relationships thus estimated and
the species tree, although great deviations are also often
observed. These results indicate that the RNA splicing
mechanism is rapidly evolving in some lineages. When
confined to mammals, the overall pattern of intron
recognition is well conserved. In particular, we found
that the GT-AG, GC-AG, and AT-AC subtypes of
introns form independent categories among all the
introns in mammals.

Results
Basic characteristics of intron data

We classified introns into three subtypes according to
their terminal dinucleotide sequences. GT-AG introns
represented 98.6%, GC-AG introns, 1.3%, and AT-AC
introns, 0.1% of ca. 2.46 × 106 introns examined. However, these fractions show considerable variation among
organisms (see Additional file 1). The fractions of GCAG introns in Aureococcus anophagefferens (alga) and
Micromonas pusilla (picophytoplankton) are exceptionally high, respectively accounting for 39.6% and 22.2% of
all introns of the species. The high G + C contents of
the genomic sequences of these species may be related
to these observations. In fact, the genomic G + C
content of A. anophagefferens is 69.5% and that of
M. pusilla is 65.9%, which are the highest and the third
highest among the 61 species examined, respectively.
The fraction of GC-AG introns in Chlorella sp. with the
second highest genomic G + C content is 7.7% and the
third highest among the 61 species. Thus, it seems
apparent that the high genomic G + C content is
responsible for the high fraction of GC-AG introns.
However, there must be other factors that affect the
abundance of GC-AG introns, as the correlation
between the genomic G + C content and the fraction of
GC-AG introns is rather weak except for these three
species as shown in Figure 1. Moreover, the GC-AG
fraction (2.7%) of Micromonas RCC299, another picophytoplankton, is not as remarkable as that of M. pusilla
despite their close taxonomic relationship and its relatively high genomic G + C content (64.1%).
The fraction of AT-AC introns is small in all species.
Although Caenorhabditis elegans seems to lack snRNAs
U11, U12, and U4atac that comprise U12-type spliceosomes [23], our automated procedure (see Methods)

identified 59 AT-AC introns in C. elegans (Additional
file 1). By manually inspecting the alignments, we suspect that at least 42 of them are real AT-AC introns,
while the others can be non-canonical ones. The
observed AT-AC introns are probably processed by
U2-type spliceosomes in this species.
We aggregated intron length data separately for each
species and for each of the three subtypes of introns.
However, no significant difference was observed in
intron lengths categorized into the two subtypes of GTAG and GC-AG in each species. As the contributions of
AT-AC type introns are negligible, we used the combined data in the following analyses. More primitive
organisms tend to have shorter average lengths of
introns, as has been often documented [24-26]. Homo
sapiens has the longest (6751 bp) average intron length
and fungal Phanerochaete chrysosporium has the shortest (56 bp) one among the 61 species. When sorted by
average intron length in descending order, all highly
ranked species are occupied by animals (Mann-Whitney
p = 0.18 × 10-8), in particular, by mammals within animals (Mann-Whitney p = 0.20 × 10 -6 ). By contrast,
lower ranked species are mostly fungi (Mann-Whitney
p = 0.26 × 10-5).
Additional file 2 shows the percentage of introns having PPT, the average PPT length, and the percentage of
pyrimidine nucleotides in PPTs for each species (see

Additional file 3 for numerical values). PPTs are detectable in more than 99% of mammalian introns. Both average PPT length and C + T content within PPT are well
conserved among mammals: the average PPT length is
approximately 18 bp and the average C + T content is
approximately 87%. Mammals have the longest PPT and
the highest C + T content within PPT among the six
groups defined in Methods. The general features are conserved in other vertebrates, but become gradually divergent when we look at other metazoan species. Outside
animals, particularly in fungi and protists, PPTs tend to
shrink and have relatively low average C + T contents.
We analyzed the classical splicing signal motifs for
each organism. The results of seven representative species from six groups, H. sapiens, Danio rerio, Drosophila
melanogaster, P. chrysosporium, S. cerevisiae, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and Arabidopsis thaliana shown in
Figure 2 reveal well-known motif profiles. Although
resembling one another, the motif profiles exhibit some
specificity. For example, the preference of G for the + 4
position of 5’ss is very strong in fungi but marginal in
plants. Moreover, the motif profile of BP is highly conserved in S. cerevisiae and P. chrysosporium but less
remarkably conserved in the other species. In this way,
the motif profiles are characteristic to species or groups.
We also calculated the information contents of the
motif profiles of all species as described in Methods,

and summarize the results in Additional file 4. From the
viewpoint of information contents, the same tendency as
that in the motif profiles could be observed. For example, in mammals, the information contents of 3’ss are
high but those of BP are low, whereas the inverse
applies to fungi (Figure 3A). The information content of
BP of S. cerevisiae is the highest of all the 61 species.
When examined for all the 61 species, the information
contents of 3’ss and BP show a strong negative correlation, whereas those of 3’ss and the percentage of PPTcontaining introns show a strong positive correlation
(Figure 3B). These observations are in good agreement
with the qualitative pattern of the motif profiles shown
in Figure 2.

observed for individual species. We naturally suspected
that each lineage has a similar tendency with respect to
a particular feature. This is in fact the case for the nine
mammalian species; the mammalian species occupy
nearby positions in all the five feature trees. The concordance between species tree and feature tree is most prominent for 5’ss, representing nearly monophyletic
appearances among various animal phyla, among
land plants, and among fungi. This tendency gradually
weakens for 3’ss, intron length, BP, and oligomer composition in this order. Remarkably, the feature tree for
intron length does not show monophyletic topology
even among mammals, suggesting the rapid evolutionary
change of this feature.

We took up five features that are related to intron
recognition as mentioned in Methods. For each feature,
we calculated the distance between a pair of species and
built a dendrogram (feature tree) of the 61 species using
those distances (Figure 4). As stated in the previous subsection, considerably variable motif profiles could be

feature. As the number of AT-AC introns is small, we
could not fit the observed length distribution of AT-AC
introns to a superposition of two Frechet distributions
[27]. Hence, we did not construct the feature tree for
length distributions of AT-AC introns.
As shown in Figure 5, GT-AG, GC-AG, and AT-AC
introns form respectively monophyletic groups in the
feature tree for 5’ss across the mammalian species. Note
that the difference in the terminal dinucleotides was
disregarded in calculation of the distances. A similar
topology was also observed in the 3’ss profiles although
GC-AG introns are not perfectly monophyletic. It is
rather surprising that GT-AG and GC-AG introns form
separate quasi-monophyletic groups, albeit their sharing
the same 3’ terminal dinucleotides. This observation
probably reflects the mechanism in which 5’ss and 3’ss
cooperate to find specific counterparts in the process of
splicing.

It is obvious that AT-AC 5’ss and 3’ss boundary signals are clearly distinct from those of the other subtypes. This difference is certainly related to the fact that
AT-AC introns are mainly processed by U12-type spliceosomes, whereas GY-AG introns are mainly processed
by U2-type spliceosomes. It is reported that U12-type
spliceosomes can also process GY-AG introns [28] and
conversely, U2-type spliceosomes can potentially process
AT-AC introns. Although some operational rules were
proposed to discriminate U12-type and U2-type introns
based on sequence characteristics [29], we did not distinguish U2-type and U12-type introns, as we considered that more experimental verification would be
needed to apply the rules to a large volume of data
obtained from diverse species. We will return to this
issue later in Discussion.
The feature tree for BP motif shows that AT-AC introns
form a monophyletic group, while GT-AG and GC-AG

Figure 5 Feature trees constructed from mammalian intron data. Taxa of each feature tree are categorized into subtypes according to the
terminal dinucleotides of the introns, GT-AG (red), GC-AG (orange), and AT-AC (purple). For statistical reasons, only intron data with GT-AG and
GC-AG, and other data with more than 100 instances are used for this analysis.

introns are not clearly separated from each other. This
observation is consistent with the report that U12-type
introns possess a well-conserved BP motif [11].
For the other feature, oligomer composition, the terminal dinucleotide types are even less correlated with the
branching patterns of the feature trees. For oligomer
composition, the same species rather than the same
terminal dinucleotide type tend to make a cluster.
The above observations suggest that GT-AG, GC-AG,
and AT-AC introns comprise distinct functional groups
that are conserved among various mammals. The 5’ss
and 3’ss signals are most influential and BP may also be
involved in the functional differentiation. In contrast,
the contribution of the other features is minimal.

Relative contributions of intron features to short intron
recognition

To study the individual contributions of various intron
features, we examined only short introns, because long
introns are likely to be recognized by much more complicated mechanisms than the five features considered
here. For example, exonic and intronic splicing enhancers/silencers, secondary structure of pre-mRNA, and
epigenetic modulation of coding genes are likely to be
involved in exon and intron definition mechanisms
[30,31] but are out of consideration in this investigation.
The histograms of intron lengths revealed the presence
of distinct populations of short introns in individual
organisms. By fitting the observed length distribution to

Iwata and Gotoh BMC Genomics 2011, 12:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/45

a superposition of two Frechet distributions [27], we
might be able to determine the natural cutoff length for
short introns for each species (Figure 6). However, the
varying cutoff lengths would introduce additional variability to our analysis and hence, we preferred to use a
fixed value as the threshold of short and long introns.
To determine the threshold, we averaged the short
intron distributions of the 61 species and defined the
threshold as 250 bp, which is the 95% quantile of the
average distribution. The total numbers of short introns
determined by this procedure are listed in Additional
file 1. The fraction of introns classified as short is
approximately 15% in mammals. By contrast, high fractions exceeding 80% are often found in fungi and
protists.

Page 8 of 17

To analyze the contributions of the five features to the
recognition of short introns, we employed a variant of
the method of Lim and Burge [5] (see Methods). Note
that the features used for the analysis were obtained not
only from short introns but from all introns of a species.
In this analysis, the amount of contribution of each feature is estimated from the gain in intron recognition
accuracy achieved by that feature. Additional file 5
shows the amount of contribution of each feature in
each species and Additional file 6 shows the absolute
and fractional values measured in bits in each species.
The sum of the relative contributions of 5’ss and 3’ss
exceeds 50% in most species. The contribution of BP is
generally low. The contribution of intron length is also
generally low except for fungi and plants, which have

significantly higher contributions than the other groups
(Mann-Whitney p = 0.58 × 10-4). A. anophagefferens has
the highest fraction (over 45%) of information deficit
among the species. By contrast, the fraction of information deficit is the smallest (approximately 7.3%) in Dictyostelium discoideum. When the 61 species are sorted
by the information bit score of the information deficit,
the nine mammals and the 15 vertebrates are ranked
high (Mann-Whitney p = 0.17 × 10-3 and p = 0.61 × 10-5,
respectively), indicating that the intron splicing of higher
eukaryotes requires more information other than the five
features, compared with splicing in the other species.
As the relative contributions of the features including
information deficit vary considerably among species, we
conducted cluster analyses of the patterns of these contributions among the 61 species. We tried the k-means
clustering method. Prior to applying this method, we
used principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain the
first and second principal components (Additional file 7),
and then ran self-organization map (SOM) on this coordinate system. As the SOM resulted in six major clusters
(data not shown), we specified six as the number of clusters in the k-means clustering method. Figure 7 shows
the results of the k-means clustering method applied to
the 61 species. In cluster (i), the ratio of information deficit is large, amounting to nearly 40%. Concomitantly, the
fractions of BP, intron length, and oligomer composition
are relatively small. Cluster (ii) resembles cluster
(i) except for the significant contribution of oligomer
composition (ca. 10%). In cluster (iii), the contribution of

Page 9 of 17

intron length is considerably large while that of information deficit is relatively small. Cluster (iv) is rather
uncharacteristic; here, the five features moderately contribute to intron recognition, leaving an information deficit of approximately 20%. Cluster (v) is the smallest
cluster and is composed of only one species, A. anophagefferens. The ratio of information deficit is the largest of
the six clusters. This is probably related to the unusually
high fraction of GC-AG introns found in this species as
mentioned earlier in this section. In the last cluster (vi),
the contribution of oligomer composition is the largest
and the percentage of information deficit is the smallest
among the six clusters.
Of the six k-means clusters, some are well characterized
by specific groups of species. For example, cluster (iii)
consists of 14 species, 10 of which are fungi, while two
fungal species Phycomyces blakesleeanus and S. cerevisiae are outside this cluster. We also found that all vertebrates except Xenopus tropicalis belong to cluster (i),
and all Chordata except Branchiostoma florida belong
to cluster (i) or cluster (ii). Likewise, five land plants
belong to cluster (i) or cluster (iv); Populus trichocarpa
and Vitis vinifera are in cluster (i), and Sorghum bicolor,
Oryza sativa, and A. thaliana are in cluster (iv). Thus,
evolutionarily close species tend to use similar strategies
for intron recognition.
However, it should also be noted that every cluster
except cluster (v) consists of more than one group of
species of distant evolutionary origins. For example,
clusters (i), (ii), (iii), and (v) individually contain both

animal and plant species. From the distribution of plant
species over the clusters, we speculate that plants have
adopted divergent strategies for intron recognition in
the course of evolution.

Discussion
This work involves large-scale computational analysis of
pre-mRNA splicing that has been enabled by taking
advantage of recent progress in massive genomic and
transcriptomic sequencing efforts. Our analysis is unique
in that it uses only experimentally verified, high quality,
and least redundant data collected by the use of our
own mapping and alignment tool, Spaln [32]. Note that
Spaln is one of the most accurate alignment tools currently available [33], and reportedly outperforms tools
that are used for annotation in major databases, such as
NCBI [34] or Ensembl [35].
Our observations are largely consistent with and reinforces those reported previously [5,12] with respect to
the following points.
First, the five features that are involved in intron recognition are differentially conserved in the evolution of
eukaryotes; 5’ss and 3’ss motifs are better conserved than
BP, intron length, and oligomer composition. On one
hand, this is revealed by the larger values of the information contents of 5’ss and 3’ss motifs than those of BP
(Figure 3) and the other features. On the other hand, this
tendency is also shown by the persistence of individual
features across various species. To measure the degree of
evolutionary persistence of the five features, we built a
dendrogram using the distances between species with
respect to each of the five features, and then evaluated
how much the feature trees deviate from the species classification. As shown in Figure 4, the information contents
of the motifs that reflect intra-species conservation are
well correlated with the inter-species evolutionary persistence of the corresponding features. In this study, we
used phylogenetic trees derived from 18S rRNAs and U2
snRNAs as reference. Although we also examined U1
snRNA sequences, the results are omitted here as the
structures of fungal U1 RNAs extremely deviate from
those of the other groups [36].
Second, PPT signals and BP signals compensate each
other. Typically, mammals have strong PPT signals and
weak BP signals, while the opposite is true in fungi.
This compensating effect is further confirmed in other
phyla of eukaryotes, as revealed by the strong negative
correlation between PPT and BP signals (Figure 3). Like
Schwartz and Silva et al. [12], we also found a gradual
increase in PPT signal strength along the metazoan
lineages (Additional file 2); protists and fungi have short
PPTs and low C + T contents in PPT, whereas mammals have the longest PPTs and the highest C + T contents in PPT among the six groups. Insects and

Page 10 of 17

Chordata other than mammals have intermediate
strengths with regard to these properties. In protists,
PPTs are short but C + T contents are high, whereas
PPTs are long but C + T contents are low in plants.
Thus, PPT signals are ubiquitous but evolutionarily variable in both strength and constitution.
Third, some correlation is observed between the relative contributions of the splicing features to intron
recognition and the genealogical relationships among
the species. Typically, mammals and vertebrates exhibit
similar patterns. However, the correlation seems to be
valid for relatively small groups of species. We evaluated
the contribution of each feature with a variant of the
method of Lim and Burge [5]. Our method differs from
that of Lim and Burge in two major points: (i) choice of
the threshold between short and long introns, and (ii)
collection of false exon-intron junctions. These modifications are necessary to automate large-scale comparisons with as little bias and noise as possible. The large
average number of false junctions (about 400) relative to
a true one tends to complicate our examinations, which
leads to relatively large fractions of information deficits.
Moreover, some of the false junctions may actually be
real ones if alternative splicing is taken into account.
Thus, there remains considerable room for improvement
in the quantitative evaluation of the relative contributions of various features to intron recognition.
For the nine species of mammals, we classified the
introns into three subtypes according to their terminal
dinucleotide sequences. We constructed feature trees for
each of the three subtypes of introns. Figure 5 shows
that GT-AG, GC-AG, and AT-AC introns form respectively monophyletic groups in the feature tree for 5’ss.
The feature tree for 3’ss also shows quasi-monophyletic
groups between GT-AG and GC-AG introns. These
results indicate that in RNA splicing, GT-AG and GCAG introns use distinct 5’ss and 3’ss motif profiles
despite the identical 3’ end dinucleotides “AG”. AT-AC
5’ss and 3’ss boundary signals are clearly distinct from
those of the other subtypes.
AT-AC introns are generally considered to be the U12
type [10]. To better characterize this minor type of
introns, we investigated AT-AC introns in five species,
H. sapiens, Mus musculus, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana,
and O. sativa, whose genomic sequences are of high
quality. Figure 8 shows 5’ss and BP motif profiles constructed from only AT-AC introns in these species. The
observed motif profiles of 5’ss for the five species, in
particular O. sativa, are consistent with the previously
reported consensus sequence of U12-type introns
“ATATCC” [28,37,38]. The motif profiles of BP even
better match the reported consensus sequence of U12type introns “CCTTAAC” [10]. We employed the weight
matrix approach [11,37] to identify U12-type introns

among AT-AC introns. The empirically derived rules
were (i) 5’ss motif scores > 9 bits, (ii) BP motif scores >
6 bits, and (iii) intron lengths < 20 kb, where the weight
matrix was constructed from a set of 48 experimentally
verified U12-type introns [28]. The results summarized
in Additional file 8 somewhat underestimate the frequencies of AT-AC U12-type introns relative to those of
all introns, compared with the results of Sheth and Roca
et al. [11]. In our analysis, more than half of the AT-AC
introns satisfied the BP motif criterion in human, while
only approximately 30% of the AT-AC introns satisfied
the 5’ss motif criterion. Similar tendencies were also

observed for the other species except D. melanogaster
(Figure 9 and Additional file 8). We speculate that the
threshold of 9 bits for the 5’ss motif score is too high,
and the fraction of U12-type introns among AT-AC
introns would actually be larger than the present estimates. However, more detailed experimental studies
would be necessary to confirm this idea.
The origin of the exceptionally abundant GC-AG introns
in A. anophagefferens and M. pusilla is an enigma. To
see some peculiarity in the splicing machinery of these
species, we retrieved putative snRNA U1 genes from the
genomic sequences of these two species and another

picophytoplankton, M. RCC299, as reference. Despite the
high overall genomic G + C contents, A. anophagefferens,
M. pusilla, and M. RCC299 putative U1 RNAs have G +
C contents of 52.7%, 57.4%, and 58.4%, respectively,
which are comparable to the average (55.5 ± 3.8%) of 100
U1 RNAs represented in the Rfam RF00003_seed alignment. The three putative U1 RNAs have the same 5’terminal 11-nucleotide sequence that is perfectly identical
to the consensus “AUACUUACCUG” that is directly
involved in base pairing with the pre-mRNA donor site
[39]. M. pusilla and M. RCC299 putative U1 RNAs exhibit 82.2% nucleotide identities in their entire ranges of
162 and 161 nucleotides, and these two sequences are
equally divergent (approximately 55% identities) from the
A. anophagefferens sequence. Altogether, it is unlikely
that the very different fractions of GC-AG introns, 22.1%
and 2.71%, in the two picophytoplanktons could be
ascribed to the difference in the primary sequences of U1
RNA. Either RNA base modifications or the protein components of the U1 snRNP complex may be responsible
for the peculiar 5’ intron end selection in A. anophagefferens and M. pusilla.

Conclusions
We have characterized representative features involved
in RNA splicing in divergent eukaryotic species from
the viewpoints of evolution and information theory. The
quantitative characterization of these features is indispensable for the development of accurate and efficient
computational tools for gene recognition of various
types, such as ab initio, transcript-dependent, and comparative genomes, from the genomic sequence. As generally conceived and confirmed in this study, the 5’ss
and 3’ss signals are the most important for the recognition of introns. Therefore, in many tools, exon-intron
boundaries are recognized by position-specific weight
matrix (PWM) or similar methods [40-42]. Our results
indicate that the contributions of intron length and oligomer composition are also significant to varying
degrees depending on the species or group. For example, Additional file 5 indicates that intron length considerably contributes to intron recognition in fungi and
protists. In the latter, the contribution of oligomer composition is also comparable to that of intron length.
Hence, a gene-finding program would benefit from
incorporation of these features with an appropriate set
of parameters adjusted for each species to achieve better
performance.
However, it must be said that the present study has
posed additional puzzles about the splicing mechanisms.
Namely, the nearly monophyletic distribution of GTAG, GC-AG, and AT-AC subtypes among mammalian
introns with respect to 5’ss and 3’ss signals and the

Page 12 of 17

extraordinarily abundant GC-AG introns in some species are not easily explained by our present knowledge.
Our results also suggest that U12-type introns may
account for a larger fraction of AT-AC introns than
existing estimates [11]. More detailed experimental studies on major- and minor-type introns would be necessary to reveal the mechanisms underneath these
phenomena.

Methods
Data set

The complete genomic sequences of the 61 species were
downloaded from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,
Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org/ or Joint Genome
Institute (JGI) http://genome.jgi-psf.org/. The “unique”
set of Unigene data of each species was downloaded
from NCBI [43]. EST sequences in JGI were also downloaded when available. For convenience, we divided the
61 species into six groups: mammal, Chordata except
mammal, animal except Chordata, fungus, protist, and
plant.
We used Spaln [32] to align Unigene and, if available,
additional EST sequences to the genomic sequence of
the same species. Spaln can map exon-intron structures
quite accurately [32]. Using the alignment results, intron
and flanking exon sequences were extracted from the
genomic sequence. To obtain only reliable introns, we
applied the following relatively stringent criteria for the
quality of the alignment. (i) The intron ends must follow
the canonical rule, i.e., they must be GT-AG, GC-AG or
AT-AC. (ii) The intron must be longer than 30 bp.
(iii) The alignment flanking the intron must contain at
most one mismatch and no gap within the ten nucleotide positions at each side. Moreover, to remove redundancy, we randomly selected only a representative
intron when several exon-intron boundaries shared
highly similar sequences (> 75% identities within a range
of 100 nucleotides, half from the exonic and the other
half from the intronic regions). Thus, the introns in our
study are all evidence-based, of high quality, and the
least redundant.
In analysis of information content and construction of
feature trees, we used all intron which we detect. On
the other hand, in analysis of evaluation of relative contribution of five features, we used only short intron
(under 250 bp).
PPT prediction algorithm

We devised an algorithm to find the most probable
location of PPT within 50 nucleotides upstream of 3’ss.
First, we identified the end (3’ most) point of PPT as
the last pyrimidine dinucleotides upstream of 3’ss. Then,
we scanned the nucleotide sequence from there toward

Iwata and Gotoh BMC Genomics 2011, 12:45

the 5’ direction to compute the PPT_score, which is
defined as the sum of the following indices:
⎧ +1.0 if ( C or T )
⎪
PPT _ index = ⎨
⎪
⎩ −1.5 if ( A or G )

(1)

We stopped the scan when the PPT_score decreased
by 2 or more from the maximum value so far attained,
and identified the start (5’ most) point of PPT as the
position with the maximal PPT_score. When the percentage of C + T nucleotides inside the sequence is less
than 50%, we regarded that the intron lacks PPT.

the motif. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a given sequence
belonging to the motif is estimated from the log-odds
scores. Most importantly, log-odds can measure the
amount of “information for discrimination” between the
motif and the background [45]. In general, the higher the
log-odds of a motif are, the rarer the occurrence of similar sequences in the background is. We evaluated the
information score of each of the five features (5’ss, 3’ss,
BP, intron length, and nucleotide composition within an
intron) of an intron by this standard method.
5’ss, 3’ss, and BP

BP prediction algorithm

For 5’ss, 3’ss, and BP, the log-odds are tabulated in the
form of PWM:

To construct the BP signal profile, we developed a simple
algorithm that extracts putative BP motifs from the
introns of individual organisms. Assuming that a functional BP must be followed by a functional PPT of a certain length, we first scanned upstream of the PPT start
point and located all possible BP sequences within 100
nucleotides upstream of 3’ss. In this scoring process, we
used the “core” BP motif profile represented by a 4 × 5
PWM [44] to obtain the core BP score, BP_score(i), at the
genomic position i. The detailed procedures for constructing PWM and calculating an associated score will be
described later in this section. If the maximal BP_score(i)
exceeds 1.85 bits [22], we regarded this 5-mer plus the
upstream 2-mer as the BP signal of the intron. By repeating this procedure for all introns of each organism
extracted as described above, we constructed the BP motif
profile of the organism represented by a 4 × 7 PWM.

⎛ f k, j + 
⎞
⎟
(2)
pwm ( k , j ) = log 2 ⎜
( Fk +  ) ⎟
⎜
⎝
⎠
where fk,j is the relative frequency of observing nucleotide k at the motif position j, Fk is the background frequency of k, and ε is a small constant representing a
pseudo count (10-4 by default). Note that we numerically encoded nucleotides A, C, G, and T into 1, 2, 3,
and 4, respectively, and 1 ≤ j ≤ w, where w denotes the
number of columns of PWM. As mentioned above, w =
9 for 5’ss, w = 14 for 3’ss, and w = 7 for BP in this
study.
Given a segment of genomic nucleotide sequence, s
(i:i + w-1) = si,si+ 1,...,si+ w-1, the information (log-odds)
score ISfeature(s(i:i + w-1)) of the segment having a feature (5’ss, 3’ss, or BP) is defined as:

5’ss and 3’ss motif profiles

We constructed the motif profiles for each species,
using all the extracted introns of the species. We first
obtained the gap-less alignment around each splicing
junction juxtaposing the canonical dinucleotide of 5’ss
(GY or AT) or 3’ss (AG or AC). Looking at the relative
entropy at each aligned position calculated with the
overall genomic nucleotide compositions as the background, we selected informative signal sequences for
each of the 5’ss and 3’ss motifs. Specifically, we identified positions -3 to + 6 from the exon-intron junction
(exonic 3 positions and intronic 6 positions) as the 5’ss
motif, and positions -13 to + 1 from the intron-exon
junction (intronic 13 positions and an exonic position)
as the 3’ss motif. Each ss motif profile is represented by
a 4 × 9 or a 4 × 14 PWM.
Calculation of information score of a feature

From information theory, the amount of information
held by a given motif is related to the relative entropy of

Intron length

The distribution of intron lengths, f(l), is characteristic
to each species (see Figure 6 for the results of six species). We modeled the distribution of intron lengths in
each species by the superposition of two Frechet distributions [27], and measured the information content
assigned to an intron of length l (Lmin ≤ l <Lmax) by a
simple log-odd:
⎛ f (l) ⎞
IS intorn_length ( l ) = log 2 ⎜
c ⎟.
⎝
⎠

(4)

As the background, we used a uniform density of c =
1/(Lmax - Lmin). Lmin was fixed to 30, whereas Lmax was
determined by the 99% quantile of the longer components of the Frechet distributions.

Oligomer composition within intron

Although the coding potential is widely used in gene
recognition programs, the usual coding potential is
beyond the scope of this study as our present interest is
in intron recognition. Although less remarkable than coding sequences, intronic sequences still have some compositional bias relative to the whole genomic sequences. We
modeled both intronic and whole genomic sequences by
the homogeneous fourth-order Markov models, which
are nearly equivalent to accounting 5-mer frequencies.
Given a nucleotide sequence s of a potential intron, we
applied the Markov models to s to calculate the probability of s having the intronic composition, PI(s), and the
probability of s having the background composition,
PG (s). Then, we defined the information score on the
oligomer composition of an intron of length l as
⎛ P (S)
⎞
IS composition ( S ) = log 2 ⎜ I

Calculation of information content of each motif

The information content (IC) of a motif with a distribution f is defined as usual by the relative entropy against
the background distribution g:
IC motif =

∑f

m

log 2 ( f m / g m ),

(6)

m

where fm is the probability of observing sequence m
under the motif distribution, g m is the probability of
observing sequence m under the background sequence
distribution, and the sum is taken over all possible
nucleotide sequences of the motif length.
Calculation of distance and construction of feature trees

We calculated the distance between a pair of species,
A and B, concerning each of the five features, i.e., the
three kinds of motif profiles, the intron length, and
the oligomer composition within an intron. Let f and
g be matrices or vectors that characterize a feature of
species A and B, respectively. By F and G, we denoted
the corresponding background probabilities obtained
from the whole genomic sequences of A and B,
respectively.
For a motif profile of 5’ss, 3’ss or BP, f or g is represented by a 4 × w matrix, in which the columns corresponding to the terminal dinucleotides of introns were
omitted from calculation of the distance between the
two motif profiles of 3’ss or 5’ss. We slightly modified
the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence [46] to measure the distance Dfeature(A, B) between A and B concerning a certain feature as follows:

D feature ( A, B ) =

which indicates that the value is the difference in the
expected motif score for species A calculated with the
“cognate” log-odds PWM and that calculated with
the heterogeneous log-odds PWM. The second term has
the same meaning for species B. Note that Dfeature(A, B)
defined above and Dcomposition(A, B) defined below are
not guaranteed to be non-negative and so do not satisfy
the axiom of distance. However, they have a straightforward meaning as a measure of divergence, and work
fine in practice.
For oligomer compositions, f or g is the probability of
occurrence of a 5-mer within introns, and F or G is the
corresponding probability observed in the whole genomic sequence. Similar to equation (7), we defined the
distance as:
D composition ( A, B ) =

where the summation was taken for all 5-mers.
To calculate the distance between the distributions of
intron lengths of two species, we defined f(l) or g(l) as
the frequency fitted to two Frechet distributions of
length l. We evaluated the distance by the symmetric
Kullback-Leibler divergence:

where the summation was taken over the range: Lmin
≤ l < Min(Lmax(A), Lmax(B)).
Using the distance matrices separately derived for the
five features, we generated UPGMA (Unweighted Pair
Group Method with Arithmetic mean) trees [47] by the
“neighbor” program in the Phylip package [48].
As controls, we also constructed phylogenetic trees
from 18S rRNA and U2 snRNA sequences. We collected
a set of 18S rRNA sequences of the 61 species from Silva
[49] and NCBI. U2 snRNA sequences were obtained

Iwata and Gotoh BMC Genomics 2011, 12:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/45

from several sources: Rfam [36], [23], [50], and NCBI.
When multiple copies of 18S rRNA or U2 snRNA genes
were present in a species, only the one closest to the consensus was selected. We aligned the RNA sequences by
Mafft [51,52] with the Q-INS-I option, and then generated phylogenetic trees by using four methods (UPGMA,
neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum
likelihood) implemented in the Phylip package [48]. In
this study, however, we report only the results with the
maximum likelihood method.
Evaluation of degree of discordance between a feature
tree and reference tree

To evaluate how much a feature tree deviates from a
reference tree, we used the nodal distance method
implemented in TOPD/FMTS v3.3 [53]. In this method,
the number of internal nodes that intervene between
every pair of taxa in a given tree is counted to generate
the nodal distance matrix. Then, the distance between
each feature tree and each reference tree is evaluated by
the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the
corresponding elements of the two nodal distance
matrices. An RMSD value of zero indicates that the two
trees being compared are identical, while a larger RMSD
value indicates greater discordance between the trees
under comparison. This software also provides a tool for
statistical test, which generates a number of (100 by
default) trees with the same taxa and the same topology
as those of the original tree but the labels of the taxa
are randomly permutated. By applying this method to
each of the five feature trees, we obtained the mean and
standard deviation of RMSD values for the randomized
trees. Assuming a normal distribution with these statistics, we estimated the significance of relatedness
between the observed feature tree and the reference
tree, and present the results in the caption of Figure 4.
For each feature tree, we evaluated the discordance
score with the mean of RMSD values obtained with the
18S rRNA tree and the U2 snRNA tree as controls.
Evaluation of relative contribution of each feature

We employed a method similar to that proposed by Lim
and Burge [5] to evaluate the relative contributions of
the five features discussed in the subsection “Calculation
of Information Score of a Feature.”
For a given intron, we enumerated all possible 5’ and
3’ splicing signal pairs within the region from 100 bp
upstream of the 5’ss to 100 bp downstream of the 3’ss,
besides the true one, which follow the canonical GY-AG
or AT-AC rule and are separated by typical lengths of
short introns, and assigned them the “splicing score,”
which is defined as the sum of information scores of the
five features. On average, 393 pairs were examined for

Page 15 of 17

each intron. We chose the pair with the highest splicing
score as the predicted intron boundaries. The intron
detection accuracy is defined as Ac = (the number of
correctly predicted introns)/(the total number of real
introns examined). We regarded a prediction to be successful if Ac exceeded 0.98 [5].
We measured the contribution of each feature to
intron recognition as follows. First, we examined the
accuracies of intron recognition for all combinations of
features involving both splicing signals, 5’ss and 3’ss. For
example, 5’ss + 3’ss, 5’ss + 3’ss + BP, 5’ss + 3’ss + length
+ composition, etc. Next, we transformed the accuracy
to TAc = -log(1.0-Ac). We defined the “necessary
amount of contribution” as TAc of accuracy 98% (-log
(1.0-0.98=0.02)). The difference between the necessary
amount of contribution and the maximal TAc is defined
as the information deficit for intron recognition. Each
contribution of the five features is defined as the difference in the amount of contribution corresponding to
the gain in accuracy obtained with 5’ss + 3’ss + the feature from that with the minimal TAc. For example, the
information value of BP is obtained by subtracting TAc
of 5’ss + 3’ss from TAc of 5’ss + 3’ss + BP. When the
gain is negative, the corresponding amount of contribution is zero. Finally, we calculated the ratio of each feature’s TAc to the necessary amount of contribution and
defined the ratio as the “information share” of the
feature.
Clustering method

We tried to classify all the 61 species according to the
contributions of the five features plus the fraction of
“information deficit.” In the method, we first applied the
PCA to the contribution data to obtain the first and second components. We used the raw contribution values
of the six features as the input to PCA. Using these
PCA components, we classified the 61 species by the kmeans clustering method [54,55]. As a preliminary result
of the SOM classification of the same data indicated
that the 61 species were divided into six clusters (data
not shown), we used six as the number of clusters with
the k-means clustering method.
