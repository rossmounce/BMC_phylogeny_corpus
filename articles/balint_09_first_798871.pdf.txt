Abstract
The European swine influenza viruses (SIVs) show considerable diversity comprising different types
of H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 strains. The intensifying full genome sequencing efforts reveal further
reassortants within these subtypes. Here we report the identification of an uncommon reassortant
variant of H1N2 subtype influenza virus isolated from a pig in a multisite herd where H1N2 swine
influenza was diagnosed for the first time in Sweden during the winter of 2008-2009. The majority
of the European H1N2 swine influenza viruses described so far possess haemagglutinin (HA) of the
human-like H1N2 SIV viruses and the neuraminidase (NA) of either the European H1N2 or H3N2
SIV-like viruses. The Swedish isolate has an avian-like SIV HA and a H3N2 SIV-like NA, which is
phylogenetically more closely related to H3N2 SIV NAs from isolates collected in the early '80s
than to the NA of H3N2 origin of the H1N2 viruses isolated during the last decade, as depicted by
some German strains, indicative of independent acquisition of the NA genes for these two types
of reassortants. The internal genes proved to be entirely of avian-like SIV H1N1 origin. The
prevalence of this SIV variant in pig populations needs to be determined, as well as the suitability
of the routinely used laboratory reagents to analyze this strain.
The description of this H1N2 SIV adds further information to influenza epidemiology and supports
the necessity of surveillance for influenza viruses in pigs.

Findings
Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) have a world-wide distribution, and may cause respiratory disease in pigs of rapid
and dramatic onset. The causative agent belongs to type A
influenza viruses within the Orthomyxoviridae family. In

North America, classical swine H1N1 viruses, triple-reassortant H3N2 viruses, possessing genes of classical swine
H1N1, North American avian, and human H3N2 viruses,
and different lineages of H1N1 as well as H1N2 viruses
generated by reassortations from the afore-mentioned

ones co-circulate. In Asia, the situation is even more complex, since in addition to the above viruses, human H3N2
and Eurasian avian-like H1N1 SIVs are present [1,2]. In
Europe, an avian-like H1N1 virus, which was first
detected in 1979 in Belgium, replaced the classical swine
H1N1 viruses and became predominating [3]. These
avian-like SIVs reassorted with human H3N2 viruses, and
gave rise to human-like H3N2 SIVs, first detected in the
mid eighties in Italy [4]. In the same period of time, H1N2
SIVs comprising HA of classical swine H1N1 and humanlike NA from swine H3N2 viruses were isolated in France
[5-7]. These reassortants have not become widespread
among the European pig population and unfortunately,
no nucleotide sequence data are available in the GenBank
regarding these isolates. In 1994, a further reassortant variant was identified in the UK, comprising haemagglutinin
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of human origin
(human-like H1N2 viruses), [8,9]. Since then, the HA of
these viruses evolved independently from their ancestor
human viruses [10].
Recently, "novel" reassortant H1N2 SIVs were isolated in
Germany (A/sw/Cloppenburg/IDT4777/05 and A/sw/
Dötlingen/IDT4735/05) having a mixture of the characteristics of porcine H1N2 and H3N2 viruses [11]. Serological investigations suggested that these H1N2 viruses
should be antigenically different from the first isolated
German H1N2 SIV strain, A/swine/Bakum/1832/2000
[12], which was considered as a typical representative of
German H1N2 SIVs. The molecular investigations confirmed this assumption, since indeed, the novel German
H1N2 strains contained a H3N2 SIV-like NA represented
by A/swine/Ghent/1/1984 (H3N2), and not an "established" European H1N2 NA represented by and supposedly evolved from A/swine/Scotland/41044/1994
(H1N2); [11]. Their HA however, grouped together with
other European human-like H1N2 HAs. Therefore, a reassortment event between the prevalent European H1N2
and H3N2 SIVs was suggested in the background of the
emergence of the new H1N2 viruses.

Showing the complexity of reassortations, the same study
noticed a "unique" Italian virus, A/swine/Italy/2064/1999
(H1N2), which had an avian-like H1 and a European SIVlike H1N2 NA. A GenBank search revealed only one additional strain with similar composition, A/swine/Germany/SEk1178/2000 (H1N2) of northern Germany
origin.
The A/swine/Sweden/1021/2009 (H1N2) virus was isolated as part of the diagnostic investigation of a multisite
pig herd (sow pool) with 4,000 sows affected with severe
clinical signs of respiratory disease among growers during
the winter of 2008-2009. The herd was centrally located in
Sweden, 400 km from the southern coast line and 200 km
from the western coast line. Nevertheless, this was the first
demonstration of H1N2 in pigs in Sweden [13]. However,
the location of the herd makes it less likely to believe that
this was the true index case of H1N2 in Sweden, and the
significance of the herd size for development of clinical
signs will be scrutinized. According to a national serologic
screening carried out in 2006, pigs in Sweden were free
from H1N2 at that time. Previously, influenza H1N1
infected the Swedish pig population for the first time during the winter 1982-1983 causing severe clinical signs in
pigs of all ages at that time [14]. Thereafter the clinical
signs of H1N1 have declined. H3N2 established itself less
dramatically than H1N1, and the index year therefore
remains unknown. A national serologic screening carried
out in 1999 demonstrated that H3N2 was well established
in the country.
Since clinical manifestation of swine influenza is rare in
Sweden, and SIV strains are of particular concern due to
the novel human H1N1 epidemic, the virus was isolated
in primary swine kidney cells based on standard protocols
and the isolate was subjected to full genome sequencing
and sequence analysis as described earlier [15]. Briefly, the
coding sequences were amplified in one piece (for HA, M,
NA, and NS genes) or in two fragments for the rest of the
genes, and sequenced afterwards supported by additional

sequencing primers in case it was necessary. For the phylogenetic analyses nucleotide sequences were collected
based on the BLAST search results of the obtained
sequences, additional sequences were obtained from the
Influenza Virus Resource platform of NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html, plus, if
still missed, sequences of isolates appearing in the related
publications were specifically searched for. Sequence
assembly, multiple alignment and alignment trimming
were performed with the CLC Main Workbench 5.0.2.
(CLC bio A/S, Aarhus, Denmark). Distance based neighbor joining and character based maximum parsimony
phylogenetic trees were generated using the Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software v.4.0.
[16], with 1000 bootstrap replicates. For the neighborjoining trees, the Maximum Composite Likelihood
method was used. Other models were also tested which
showed similar topologies.
The subtyping of the isolate by the analysis of nucleotide
homology revealed its H1N2 nature. The phylogenetic
investigations clarified that the H1 belonged to the avianlike H1N1 SIVs, which is in contrast to the "established"
H1N2 SIVs in Europe (Figure 1). The two "unique" viruses
from Italy and northern Germany grouped together with
the Swedish isolate. The NA of the Swedish virus was similar to those of the "novel" A/sw/Cloppenburg/IDT4777/
05 and A/sw/Dötlingen/IDT4735/05 isolates by grouping
together with European H3N2 SIVs (Figure 2). However,
the Swedish strain showed higher nucleotide identity to
the A/swine/Gent/1/84 (H3N2) (89.39%) than to the
German strains (84.5 and 85%, respectively), which is
reflected also by their phylogenetic positions. These data
indicate that the Swedish strain obtained its N2 gene independently of the German strains. The summary of the surface glycoprotein composition of the European H1N2
SIVs described so far is presented in Table 1.
The internal genes proved to be of avian-like SIV H1N1
origin supported both by phylogenetic analyses and the
relevant markers presented by Dunham et al., [1],
although one marker assigned to PB1 and NS1 each was
shared with avian viruses (data not shown), reflecting the
ancestors of these inner genes. It was noticed in the case of
each phylogenetic tree, however, that the Swedish isolate
sit on a rather long branch next to its closest relatives
regardless of the method used for phylogeny. This phenomenon reflects the lack of available swine influenza
sequences from Scandinavia in the GenBank and about
SIVs of similar characteristics. The accumulation of further
data of the relevant type should improve the situation.
The PB1-F2 protein encoded by an alternative ORF of PB1
[17] proved to be truncated in the case of the Swedish
virus due to possessing a stop codon after the eleventh

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/180

amino acid, characterizing a minor proportion of SIVs
[18].
Uniformly with the prevalent European SIVs, the M2 gene
of the Swedish virus possessed the S31N substitution that
is indicative of amantadine resistance [19].
In summary, the characterised Swedish isolate possessing
avian-like SIV H1N1 HA and European H3N2 SIV-like NA
represents an uncommon type of H1N2 SIV reassortant
virus and further, its NA appears to be obtained by a reassortment independently of the recent German H1N2 SIVs,
otherwise similar in composition. The origin, antigenic
characteristics of the strain and its prevalence in Sweden
are yet unknown and are the subjects of further investigations.
The presented findings support the observations concerning the continuous reassortment process of SIVs, resulting
in repeated and independent emergence of certain HA/NA
combinations in pigs, and also the need for the systematic
surveillance of influenza in swine to reveal such events
and identify these strains.
