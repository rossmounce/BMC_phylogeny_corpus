Abstract
Background: Current sequencing technologies give access to sequence information for genomes
and metagenomes at a tremendous speed. Subsequent data processing is mainly performed by
automatic pipelines provided by the sequencing centers. Although, standardised workflows are
desirable and useful in many respects, rational data mining, comparative genomics, and especially
the interpretation of the sequence information in the biological context, demands for intuitive,
flexible, and extendable solutions.
Results: The JCoast software tool was primarily designed to analyse and compare (meta)genome
sequences of prokaryotes. Based on a pre-computed GenDB database project, JCoast offers a
flexible graphical user interface (GUI), as well as an application programming interface (API) that
facilitates back-end data access. JCoast offers individual, cross genome-, and metagenome analysis,
and assists the biologist in exploration of large and complex datasets.
Conclusion: JCoast combines all functions required for the mining, annotation, and interpretation
of (meta)genomic data. The lightweight software solution allows the user to easily take advantage
of advanced back-end database structures by providing a programming and graphical user interface
to answer biological questions. JCoast is available at the project homepage.

Background
The sequencing of genomes and metagenomes has
become a standard technology in molecular biology. Currently, over 700 sequenced genomes of bacterial and
archaeal origin are publicly available [1]. Initiatives such
as the Community Sequencing Program at the Joint
Genome Institute (JGI), the Microbial Genome Sequenc-

ing Project funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, or collaborations with Genoscope, enable
researchers worldwide to get their genome or metagenome of interest easily sequenced. With the acceptance of a
sequencing project, initial bioinformatic support is often
granted through web-based systems, such as the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG and IMG/M) system [2]

or Magnifying Genomes [3] to give two examples. To cope
with the flood of data generated by community sequencing projects such as the Venter cruises [4,5], the CAMERA
(Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Marine
Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis) consortium was
recently established providing access to both the data and
pre-computed information [6].
Standardised steps for data processing in (meta)genome
analysis are highly appreciated for their ability to make
results comparable and the processing transparent. Nevertheless, after the first round of data mining using webbased annotation systems, specific requests by the biologists typically arise, which ask for alternative views of the
data. To deal with such demands, full access to the tools
and databases is required. This is best handled through
the use of "rich clients", which take full advantage of the
native facilities of the user's computer. Making use of
existing graphics hardware acceleration, rich clients can
serve as graphical front-end to display complex and interactive visualisations [7]. One of the most popular, stable,
flexible, and publicly available genome visualisation tools
is Artemis [8]. Although, it can be extended for computations, it lacks a central storage system and is therefore, in
most cases, only used as a viewer for genomic data.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/177

genomic sources or a sortable tabular representation of
the gene content. Further modules for the calculation of
group-specific genes, COG statistics, advanced search
functionalities, as well as gene grouping were continuously requested.
In order to address this issue, we developed JCoast, a
Comparative Analysis and Search Tool for prokaryotic
genomes. JCoast is a standalone tool that makes use of the
standardised genome processing and storage system,
GenDB. JCoast offers individual and cross genome- and
metagenome analysis by handling several projects simultaneously. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI),
and an application programming interface (API), including a plug-in facility for user extensions. JCoast can also
work on local databases following the GenDB schema,
independently of a full GenDB installation. It is publicly
available and can be easily installed using the Java Webstart technology. The low system requirements, especially
when pre-computed databases are used, the very limited
need for maintenance, combined with highly flexible data
analysis options, leaves the biologists to concentrate on
biological questions rather than solving computation
problems.

Implementation
A "state-of-the-art" infrastructure for (meta)genome analysis should be based on a relational database system that
stores and organises assembled DNA sequence data, gene
predictions, results from automatic analysis, and manual
annotations [9]. The analysis should integrate similarity
searches against a variety of different data sources based
on established algorithms to get a comprehensive overview of the available information for each gene and gene
family. Consistent data processing and storage is a prerequisite for flexible data analysis, which is essential when
addressing specific requests of the biologists. Project and
user management is also necessary to organise data access
on all levels (administrator, annotator, guests). In 2003,
the GenDB system [10] was released as an open source
solution for high quality whole genome annotation. The
system relies on a relational database system for back-end
storage and takes advantage of Grid technology for massive distributed computing. In addition to project and
user management, GenDB offers visualisation, annotation, and search capabilities via a web front-end. GenDB
has already been successfully used in many annotation
projects [e.g. [11-13]] and adopted by the Network of
Excellence "Marine Genomics Europe" [14] as their standard tool for genome analysis.
Although equipped with an advanced backbone for data
processing and storage, the available GenDB web-visualisation and analysis capabilities were not able to cover all
user-specific requests such as parallel analysis of several

JCoast is written in the platform-independent, object-oriented programming language, Java [15]. It can be started
using the Java Web Start technology, which automatically
downloads and installs the software locally. This ensures
the user to always get access to the latest version available.
Alternatively, it can be downloaded and installed manually.
JCoast offers two entry points to access the genomic data
and bioinformatic results:
i. the GUI, which is implemented with the Java-Swing
extension, SwingX [16]. The GUI provides all functions
necessary to analyse, search, and manipulate genomic
information, and includes dedicated modules for addressing e.g. group specific genes (GSG) or comparative statistics based on profile-HMMs.
ii. the API, which provides object relational mapping to
the underlying database and specific classes for advanced
searches, data mining and statistics.
The JCoast source code is organised in:
i. the 'api' package, which contains all classes describing
the core functionality;

Page 2 of 9

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:177

ii. the 'gui' package, which contains all classes describing
the graphical user interface and related inherited functionalities;
iii. the 'scripts' package, which contains ready to use methods for project maintenance, time consuming calculations
(e.g. calculation of reciprocal best matches), and specific
data transfer methods, such as the export of the database
in NCBI Sequin format for genome data submissions.
By default, JCoast supports five bioinformatic tools:
BLAST [17], Pfam [18], InterPro [19], SignalP [20], and
TMHMM [21], and offers a direct access to the Geographic-BLAST tool provided by megx.net [22].
The current JCoast implementation relies on MySQL 5.0
[23] and a GenDB 2.2 compatible database schema. A
detailed description of the GenDB system can be found in
Meyer et al., 2003 [10].
The following extensions to the GenDB database schema
are necessary to support all features offered by JCoast:
Gene groups
JCoast offers assigning a set of genes into "gene groups".
This allows visualisation and analysis of the
(meta)genomic information across projects. In order to
store gene groups in JCoast, the GenDB database model
needs to be extended by two tables, Gene_Group and
Gene_Group_Region. Gene_Group contains the description
of the group, Gene_Groups_Region contains the corresponding genes belonging to a defined Gene_Group.
Codon offset
Partial protein coding genes that result from missing start
codons are common in draft- and metagenomic datasets.
To handle this, the GenDB database needs to be extended
by the table Region_CDS_Codon_Offset. This ensures that
the translation will always start on the first complete
codon.

sequence (CDS), contig, tRNA and rRNA) belonging to a
project. Where a project is defined as all contigs belonging
to e.g. a single organism or a metagenomic sample. A button panel implements rapid switching between regions.
The panel also offers the ability to extract sequence information for a single gene, region, or for a whole project, as
either amino acids or nucleotides. For each CDS entry, an
'Annotation dialog' can be entered. This dialog allows
annotation of the gene products, the EC numbers, gene
names, and additional comments for each entry. All annotations are immediately stored and subsequently available
for other annotators. With the history function of GenDB
all user changes are tracked. Additionally, regions can be
deleted via the panel. The 'Observation Browser' at the
bottom displays the different similarity search results for
a CDS. Depending on the selected tools, additional functions are available for each entry. For example, every similarity search result is referenced to its original entry in
public repositories (e.g. GenBank), if available. The public
entry is shown in the standard browser of the host system.
For the similarity search results against genomesDB (see
below for more details), preconfigured charts are available
for visualisation. For example, the taxonomic distribution
analysis of BLAST hits can be shown in a pie chart, ordered
either by phylum, family, order, class, or species (Fig 2).
All tables have a common set of functions to enhance the
usability:
i. an alphanumeric sorter for each column of the table.
ii. the column control button in the upper left corner of
each table; this button enables the user to hide and
unhide a column within the table.
iii. a panel for text search in order to search within the visible content of the tables.
The module 'Statistics' includes three kinds of "on-the-fly"
calculations based on:

Results
The Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The main window of JCoast is composed of six modules
(Fig 1). The 'Browser' module is the central component of
JCoast, which is re-used by most other modules to display
results. It is separated into three panels, the 'Genome
Browser' on top, the 'Table Browser' in the middle, and
the 'Observation Browser' at the bottom.

The 'Genome Browser' provides a graphical representation of genes on the genomic or metagenomic contigs
under investigation. It is directly linked to the 'Table
Browser' where the corresponding region is shown. The
'Table Browser' displays different types of regions (coding

which counts the absolute number of genes belonging to
one of the COG categories.
ii. Pfam [18], which counts the absolute occurrence of a
defined Pfam model in a project.
iii. project content, which calculates statistics about the
number of CDS, contigs, tRNAs, rRNAs, nucleotide usage
and coding percentage.
The 'Text Search' module has been designed for string and
regular expression searches in annotations, comments,

JCoast overview
JCoast overview. The JCoast main window is separated into three panels, the 'Genome Browser' on top, the 'Table Browser'
in the middle, and the 'Observation Browser' at the bottom. The 'Genome Browser' provides a graphical representation of
genes on the genomic or metagenomic contigs under investigation. The 'Table Browser' displays different types of regions

the complex set of similarity search results (Observation
Search); the search is filtered by applying an E-value cutoff. The results view makes use of the main browser panel
and displays matching regions as subsets.
The 'Pfam Search' module allows searching within Pfam
models by applying an E-value cutoff. This allows, for
instance, consistent cross genome comparisons. The
results can be displayed as a subset of regions or as a
graphical output of all Pfam models of each CDS (Fig 3).
The 'Group-Specific Genes' (GSG) module was designed
to enable the researcher to search for genes with a limited
occurrence in a given taxonomic group or any group
defined by the user. This module is based on the custom
database, genomesDB (see below). Each CDS of a reference genome is tested for group-specificity by looking at
the observations produced by similarity searches on the
protein level against the custom database, genomesDB. By

definition, a GSG shows significant similarity only to
genes in the same taxonomic unit. Therefore, an E-value
cutoff was implemented to evaluate significance. To be
group-specific, a CDS must have at least one "in-taxon"
observation and no "out-of-taxon" observations below
the defined threshold. Self-hits are filtered out and can be
adjust within the preferences.
The 'genomesDB' database
GenomesDB is a custom designed relational database,
which includes a Java interface for maintenance. It is build
from the proteome FASTA files obtained by the NCBI Reference Sequences database (RefSeq) for all fully
sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes (621 genomes,
Jan 2008). Each genome, chromosome, and protein in the
database is tagged with a unique internal numerical identifier. In addition, taxonomic and contextual information
are parsed from NCBI Entrez Genome Project database.
For every entry, taxonomic information is collected for the
corresponding kingdom, phylum, class, order, family,

Taxonomy distribution chart
Taxonomy distribution chart. JCoast uses the database genomesDB for the calculation of GSGs and for drawing taxonomy
distribution charts. For each CDS such a chart can be calculated on the fly, based on different taxonomic levels e.g. phylum,
class, order, family or species. In addition also contextual information can be used for this calculation.

genus and species. Further contextual data available pertain to genome size, guanine-cytosine content, Gram
staining, shape, arrangement, endospores formation,
motility, salinity, oxygen, habitat and temperature range.
Genomes of interest can be selected for export via the
interface, including the protein sequences as a multiple
sequence FASTA file.
In contrast to the general-purpose database NCBI-nr, the
focus of genomesDB is to provide manually curated phylogenetic affiliations, plus as much additional contextual
information as possible. The database is used by JCoast to
determine GSGs and to calculate distribution charts of
selected properties. The current version of genomesDB
can be downloaded from the JCoast homepage.
Web-Service: Geographic-BLAST
To allow researchers to systematically study the geographic distribution of particular genes in the environment, a click on the 'Geographic BLAST' button in JCoast
starts a remote BLAST search of the database for marine
ecological genomix (megx.net) [22] for a selected gene.

The results are shown on the Genomes Mapserver, which
integrates sequence data with contextual information,
such as physical, chemical, and biological data based on
geography. In addition to the geographical distribution of
particular genes, statistics are provided pertaining to the
presence/absence and abundance of the gene of interest
with respect to sampling sites and environmental conditions.
The Application Programming Interface (API)
The JCoast core API comprises strictly defined objects of
all the important GenDB database tables. All sequence
related features, such as contigs or CDS definitions, annotations, and bioinformatic tool results are encoded within
these Java objects. The core API also contains the complete
SQL code, which is required to communicate with the
database. The building of all required Java objects has
been merged into a single class. This encapsulation
renders JCoast flexible, making it possible to work on data
sources other than GenDB. The JCoast core API is used
extensively by the graphical user interface and the 'scripts'
package, which is included in the JCoast source code. The

classes within this package deliver an easy to use environment, mainly designed for users with little Java programming experience that want to use JCoast to address
complex biological questions. The 'scripts' package
includes template classes, which manage the database
communication and user identification issues for the user.
It also includes ready to use classes for maintaining
projects, exporting data, and performing statistical calculations. Many of these classes are able to store the results
directly in the database as 'GeneGroups' for subsequent
evaluation of the results using the JCoast GUI.
Case studies
JCoast has already been extensively used and evaluated in
recently published comparative genomic and metagenomic projects.

In the field of genomics, JCoast was used to analyse the
finished genome of the marine Bacteroidetes Gramella forsetii [25] in the context of 15 other Bacteroidetes draft
sequences provided by the Moore foundation. Extensive
analysis was successfully performed on the draft genome
of Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense strain MSR-1 for comparison with three other draft genomes of magnetotactic

bacteria [26]. Aside from standard annotation support in
both projects, detailed statistical analysis of the presence/
absence and abundance of specific Pfam profiles in the
genomes was performed to identify specialisation and
niche adaptation of the organisms. Cross-comparisons of
all genes within the phenotypic group of magnetotactic
bacteria revealed a set of group specific genes that are now
the subject of targeted lab experiments. The implementation of the group specific genes module, in combination
with the genomesDB database, proved extremely helpful
by significantly accelerating the transition from in silico
predictions to lab work. Furthermore, the system was used
to assist in the annotation and ongoing comparative analysis of Congregibacter forsetii KT 71 [27].
In the field of metagenomics, a prototype of the software
was used to analyse and compare 30 Mb of DNA on 511
scaffolds (comprising 21,077 ORFs) the symbiotic community of the marine oligochaete, Olavius sp., sequenced
by a community shot-gun approach [28], as well as 9 Mb
of DNA on 7,860 scaffolds from single filaments of
Beggiatoa sp. determined by combined genome amplification and pyro- and Sanger sequencing [29]. Both projects
had a challenging and heterogeneous set of short to

medium sized DNA scaffolds and contigs that needed to
be analysed. The marginally low quality of the data was
problematic, and led to the development of the codon offset table to cope with partial genes. Moreover, JCoast is
currently used to analyse Fosmid-sized clone libraries
from different marine sampling sites.

use and flexible data mining software systems will most
likely be favored over complex annotation systems. Biologist-centric software tools such as JCoast facilitate these
tasks by providing components with sophisticated bioinformatic functionalities without prior programming
knowledge of the biologist [34].

In all projects, the system was able to assist the biologists
to generate results faster by providing custom-tailored
solutions. On the other hand, close connection to the
users provided valuable feedback for software enhancements.

Furthermore, the handling of sensitive data, as it is often
the case in commercial applications, demands for locally
installed software systems. Nevertheless, there is no doubt
that the analysis of thousands of genes and large scale
comparisons with published data is not trivial and will
always require an appropriate cyberinfrastructure.

Discussion
Many data mining, annotation, and visualisation systems
have been developed over the last years, each with their
advantages and disadvantages, for a review see [30,7]. In
addition, several stand-alone tools have been introduced,
which rely on object-oriented programming languages
(e.g. Strainer: Software for analysis of population variation in community genomic datasets [31] or MetaLook: a
3D visualisation software for marine ecological genomics
[32]). They have been designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of highly specific datasets. Moreover,
they are user-friendly and offer simple installation procedures. A shift from process to object oriented programming languages is a current trend in biologist-centric
software development.
The JCoast software tool offers the unique combination of
a standardised, open source relational database system in
the back-end and a user-oriented rich-client in a lightweight, stand-alone solution. The common usage of the
GenDB system in academia and industry has made it easy
to find a collaboration partner providing initial data
processing and database access. The company Ribocon
GmbH already offers custom tailored genome analysis in
GenDB/JCoast format on a commercial basis [33].
The possibility to run JCoast locally with either on site or
remote access to pre-computed databases frees the biologist from the need to acquire specialised knowledge about
how to install and maintain complex annotation pipelines, while taking advantage of an advanced database
structure and a tightly-linked graphical user interface. As a
result, the biologists can focus on their research with no or
minimal programming efforts.
With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies even independent working groups or individual
researchers can get easy access to genomic sequence data.
In such a case, researchers often go for specific genes of
interest in a defined set of genomes or metagenomes,
rather than to perform a time-consuming comprehensive
annotation of an entire (meta)genome. Therefore, easy to

Currently, JCoast is primarily used for the analysis of
prokaryotic genome data. In general, the GenDB system
supports the analysis of eukaryotic data as well, but handling the additional information for such projects is not
implemented in JCoast at the moment. Several extensions
are planned for the future, e.g. including an importer
allowing the user to import standardised sequence
description files which currently can only be done using
the import capabilities of the GenDB backbone. A project
and user management system will be necessary to
enhance usability in this respect. Common genome linguistic methods (GC-skew, oligonucleotide statistics),
data quality checks for 454/Solexa [35] sequences and further incorporation of contextual (meta)data standards are
envisioned.

Conclusion
JCoast is a biologist-oriented graphical software tool that
provides a powerful API to manipulate and data mine
genomic information and bioinformatic results using the
Java object-oriented programming language. The GUI is
able to handle large metagenomes, as well as minimally
assembled single genome projects. It provides a full-featured genome browser and sophisticated statistical and
search functionalities. JCoast is developed as an extension
to the GenDB back-end, but can also be used as standalone software. Pre-computed databases can be gained
through an academic collaboration or by a dedicated service company [33]. This lightweight software solution
allows the biologist to concentrate on transforming
genomic data into biological knowledge with minimal
programming experience. JCoast has been successfully
applied to several genome and metagenome projects and
has proven to be both stable and easy to use. The JCoast
software tool is publicly available from the project website
via Java Webstart or as a Kubuntu [36] JCoast-LiveCD. The
source code is available upon request from the authors.
