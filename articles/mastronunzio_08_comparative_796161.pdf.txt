Abstract
Background: Frankia sp. strains, the nitrogen-fixing facultative endosymbionts of actinorhizal plants, have
long been proposed to secrete hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulases, pectinases, and proteases that may
contribute to plant root penetration and formation of symbiotic root nodules. These or other secreted
proteins might logically be involved in the as yet unknown molecular interactions between Frankia and their
host plants. We compared the genome-based secretomes of three Frankia strains representing diverse
host specificities. Signal peptide detection algorithms were used to predict the individual secretomes of
each strain, and the set of secreted proteins shared among the strains, termed the core Frankia secretome.
Proteins in the core secretome may be involved in the actinorhizal symbiosis.
Results: The Frankia genomes have conserved Sec (general secretory) and Tat (twin arginine translocase)
secretion systems. The potential secretome of each Frankia strain comprised 4–5% of the total proteome,
a lower percentage than that found in the genomes of other actinobacteria, legume endosymbionts, and
plant pathogens. Hydrolytic enzymes made up only a small fraction of the total number of predicted
secreted proteins in each strain. Surprisingly, polysaccharide-degrading enzymes were few in number,
especially in strain CcI3, with more esterolytic, lipolytic and proteolytic enzymes having signal peptides. A
total of 161 orthologous proteins belong to the core Frankia secretome. Of these, 52 also lack homologs
in closely related actinobacteria, and are termed "Frankia-specific." The genes encoding these conserved
secreted proteins are often clustered near secretion machinery genes.
Conclusion: The predicted secretomes of Frankia sp. are relatively small and include few hydrolases,
which could reflect adaptation to a symbiotic lifestyle. There are no well-conserved secreted
polysaccharide-degrading enzymes present in all three Frankia genomes, suggesting that plant cell wall
polysaccharide degradation may not be crucial to root infection, or that this degradation varies among
strains. We hypothesize that the relative lack of secreted polysaccharide-degrading enzymes in Frankia
reflects a strategy used by these bacteria to avoid eliciting host defense responses. The esterases, lipases,
and proteases found in the core Frankia secretome might facilitate hyphal penetration through the cell wall,
release carbon sources, or modify chemical signals. The core secretome also includes extracellular solutebinding proteins and Frankia-specific hypothetical proteins that may enable the actinorhizal symbiosis.

Background
A variety of plants, called actinorhizal plants, form N2-fixing root nodules when in symbiosis with actinobacteria of
the genus Frankia. The molecular interactions governing
this symbiosis, such as those involved in signaling
between the bacteria and plant, or in penetrating the plant
cell wall, are not well characterized, primarily because of
the lack of genetic tools for generating Frankia mutants,
but also because frankiae grow very slowly [1]. The
genome sequences of three Frankia strains have recently
become available, representing groups of frankiae having
different host specificities. Frankia sp. strain HFPCcI3
(CcI3) is a narrow host range Casuarina isolate, F. alni
strain ACN14a (ACN) is a more cosmopolitan Alnus isolate, and Frankia sp. strain EaN1pec (EAN) is a broad host
range strain, isolated from Elaeagnus [2]. Although the
strains are closely related (97.8–98.9% identity of 16S
rRNA genes), their genomes range in size from 5.4 Mbp
for CcI3, to 7.5 Mbp for ACN, to 9.0 Mbp for EAN [2]. In
addition to the differences in host range and genome size,
strains CcI3 and ACN also differ from strain EAN in carbon source usage in culture and in the manner of root
infection. EAN can transport and grow on sugars such as
fructose, sorbitol, or mannitol using a phosphotransferase
system, while CcI3 grows best on pyruvate, and ACN on
propionate or acetate [1]. Only EAN can penetrate plant
roots intercellularly and via root hair infection, while CcI3
and ACN enter root cells solely through the latter method
[1].
An examination of the frankial genomes recently revealed
that Frankia strains lack the common nod genes involved
in synthesizing signals in legume endosymbionts (Rhizobium and related genera), so an alternative system of
chemical signaling between the plant and bacterium to
form the root nodule must exist. It is likely that secreted
proteins play a role in host-microbe interactions because
of the intimate contact between plant and bacterium that
occurs within the plant cell. During infection, Frankia
hyphae within root cells are encapsulated by plant cell
wall material, deposited as the organism penetrates from
cell to cell, and consisting of cellulose, pectin, and xylan
[3,4]. Cellulases, pectinases, and proteases have been
reported in the culture medium of various Frankia strains,
and have been proposed to participate in root infection
[5-9]. Such proposals are logical since many members of
the actinobacteria are nutrient scavengers that secrete
enzymes which break down biopolymers and other compounds [10,11]. Acidothermus cellulolyticus, the closest
known relative of Frankia, also in the suborder Frankineae,
is noted for its cellulolytic ability. More distantly related
Streptomyces species secrete chitinases, xylanases, cellulases and proteases into the soil environment [10]. Bacterial and fungal plant pathogens are also known to secrete
many hydrolytic enzymes [12,13]. In contrast, legume

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/47

endosymbionts (Rhizobium and other α-proteobacteria)
do not appear to rely on hydrolases during nodulation,
though this topic is still a matter of debate [14]. Indeed, it
may be counterintuitive for a plant mutualist to secrete
enzymes that degrade host tissue, since pectin cell wall
fragments have been shown to act as endogenous elicitors
of plant defense responses [15]. On the other hand,
polysaccharolytic activity reported in Frankia strains, with
no observed utilization of breakdown products (e.g. glucose), implies an additional function for these enzymes.
Protein secretion in Gram-positive bacteria is mediated
mainly by the general secretory (Sec) and twin arginine
translocation (Tat) pathways, and to a lesser extent by
ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters and other minor
pathways such as the ESAT-6 system in mycobacteria
[16,17]. Proteins are targeted to both the Sec and Tat
secretion systems by means of an N-terminal signal peptide. Both types of signal peptides contain a positively
charged N-region, followed by a hydrophobic H-region,
and ending with a cleavage site, recognized by signal
peptidase I in the Sec system [18]. Tat signal peptides have
a longer N-region containing a twin-arginine consensus
motif, a less hydrophobic H-region, and "Sec avoidance"
residues near the cleavage site [19]. In this work, we used
SignalP 3.0 and TATFIND 1.4 to predict the individual
secretomes (sets of secreted proteins) of each Frankia
strain, as well as the secretome shared by all three strains,
which we termed the core Frankia secretome [20-22]. The
Frankia secretomes and secretion machinery genes were
compared to those of related actinobacteria and other
plant-associated bacteria. We reasoned that secreted proteins needed for symbiosis-specific processes are likely to
be conserved in the core Frankia secretome, and may lack
homologs in closely related actinobacteria. This comparative genomics-based secretome analysis defines proteins
potentially involved in the actinorhizal symbiosis.

Results and Discussion
Secretion systems
Before predicting the Frankia secretomes, the genomes
were scanned for the presence of secretion systems found
in other actinobacteria. Genes encoding conserved secretion machinery-related proteins were identified based on
the COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) annotations,
and are listed in Additional File 1. All genes necessary for
the Sec translocation apparatus are present in each Frankia
strain. These encode proteins forming the main membrane channel-forming complex, SecYEG, the cytosolic
ATPase SecA, the auxiliary proteins SecD, SecF, and YajC,
and the chaperones Ffh and FtsY. As in other Gram-positive bacteria, secB is not present [23]. The most closely
related homologs to each of these genes are in other actinobacteria. The order and composition of genes surrounding the Sec machinery genes are similar or identical to

those in the close actinobacterial relatives Acidothermus
cellulolyticus and Kineococcus radiotolerans, and in the more
distantly related Streptomyces avermitilis (data not shown).
The locations of these genes in the CcI3 genome are
depicted in the circular map in Figure 1 (second circle in),
along with areas of putative prophage integration (third
circle from outside). Genes encoding the twin-arginine
translocase (Tat) system, tatA, tatB, and tatC, are also
present in the three genomes. In Frankia and in the majority of other sequenced actinobacterial genomes, tatC is
present in a single copy, with a tatA directly preceding it,
while tatB is located separately from these genes (Figure
1). Each genome has at least one additional copy of tatA.
Eight genes are annotated as encoding components of a
Type II secretion (T2S) system. The closest homologs to
these T2S genes are found in other actinobacterial
genomes. Gram-negative pathogens secrete toxins via T2S;
proteins are translocated to the periplasm by the Sec or Tat
system, and then across the outer membrane by the Type
II complex [24]. The T2S proteins in Frankia are also similar to the Flp pilus assembly proteins such as the ATPase
CpaF, TadA, or TadC. The tad (tight adherence) locus is
widespread in bacteria and is involved in adhesion or
secretion [25]. The T2S/Flp pilus/Tad homologs in the
Frankia genomes occur in operons consisting of two or
three genes. There are four of these operons in both the
CcI3 and EAN genomes, but only two in the ACN
genome. The two operons that are not shared with ACN
(Additional File 1) coincide with putative prophages in
CcI3 (Figure 1).
The CcI3 and EAN genomes have genes annotated as
encoding VirB4 and VirD4 components of the Type IV
secretion (T4S) system. Type IV secretory pathways transport macromolecules (proteins or DNA) across the cell
envelope in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
VirB4 and VirD4, located in the cytoplasmic membrane,
bind ATP and provide the energy for translocation [26].
The predicted T4S components have low sequence similarity to known T4S proteins, and instead resemble integral membrane proteins with ATP-binding domains. Only
one putative VirB4 homolog is conserved among all three
strains (CcI3 gi|86738757) and has the highest similarity
to an ATP-binding protein from Streptomyces species. CcI3
and EAN each have VirB4- and VirD4-related proteins that
are not found in the ACN genome, and most of these are
located near phage integrase or excisionase genes.
Based on the observation that genes encoding both the
Sec and Tat secretion machinery in Frankia are not only
present, but located in conserved regions (in the case of
tatA/tatC) in other actinobacterial genomes, it is likely that
both of these systems are functional in Frankia. In contrast, it is less clear whether the proteins annotated as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/47

"Type II secretion" and "VirB4/D4" homologs constitute
significant export pathways in Frankia, as very low
sequence similarity is seen between the frankial genes and
the known T2S and T4S proteins. These putative secretion
machinery genes are not well conserved across the three
strains, and appear to be associated with prophage regions
in most cases.
Individual Frankia secretomes
The complete CDS (coding sequence) translations from
each frankial genome were analyzed with SignalP 3.0, and
then scanned for transmembrane domains with TMHMM
v. 2.0 [22,27]. The predicted secretomes for individual
strains consist of proteins with signal peptides predicted
by both SignalP methods, neural networks (NN) and hidden Markov models (HMM), and containing between
zero and two transmembrane (TM) domains. These totals,
shown in Table 1, Columns 1–3 (numbers outside parentheses), have been used to estimate the number of
secreted proteins in other genome-based secretome studies [28]. The secretomes comprise similar percentages of
the proteomes of each strain: 4.4% (197 of 4499 CDS) in
CcI3, 4.1% (279 of 6711 CDS) in ACN, and 4.8% (346 of
7191 CDS) in EAN (Table 1, Figure 2). Since the annotation for F. alni strain ACN was performed by MaGe [29]
rather than the Joint Genome Institute [30], differences in
the annotation of start codons were observed, which may
account for differences in signal peptide predictions (see
Methods).

Table 1 categorizes the secretome proteins based on annotations from the NCBI database, and a complete list of
potentially secreted proteins can be found in Additional
File 2. "Cell wall/Growth" includes peptidoglycan-binding proteins and transglycosylases. "Hydrolases" are also
listed in Table 2, and are addressed in more detail in the
discussion below. "Metabolism," the broadest group,
encompasses dehydrogenases, transferases, phosphatases,
and enzymes with broadly defined functions. "Regulation" usually refers to sensor histidine kinases, while "solute-binding" refers to extracellular binding of molecules
presumably for transport into the cell. Hypothetical proteins accounted for roughly half of the proteins in the
individual secretomes.
Table 1 includes some proteins also predicted to contain
Tat signal peptides. In CcI3, TATFIND 1.4 predicted 30 Tat
signal sequences, and 20 of these were also predicted to
have Sec signal peptides. Likewise, 22 of 31 Tat signal
sequences in ACN and 48 of 76 in EAN had signal peptides predicted by both TATFIND and SignalP. The results
of the TATFIND analysis, including SignalP predictions
and Tat signal peptide sequences, can be found in Additional File 3.

Comparison with secretomes from other bacteria
We analyzed seven other bacterial genomes with SignalP
and TMHMM: five actinobacterial relatives of Frankia, and
two legume endosymbionts, Bradyrhizobium japonicum
and Sinorhizobium meliloti. Figure 2 compares the secretomes of each of these, reported as a percentage of the
total proteome. Data for three plant pathogen genomes,

adapted from Preston et al. (2005), are also included [28].
The secretomes of the two closest relatives of Frankia, Acidothermus cellulolyticus and Kineococcus radiotolerans, comprise higher percentages of the total proteome of each
species (6.6% and 7%). Roughly 30% of these secreted
proteins are shared with those of Frankia, while another
30% are hypothetical proteins not found in Frankia (using

proteomes (8.6% and 9.5%), roughly double the percentages seen in Frankia, and contain many potential secreted
hydrolytic enzymes (100 in S. avermitilis and 134 in S. coelicolor). The legume symbionts and the plant pathogens
analyzed have more than double the percentages of
secreted proteins predicted in Frankia (Figure 2). Fewer
secreted hydrolases are predicted in legume endosymbionts than in plant pathogens, but both secrete substantially more solute-binding proteins than are found in the
Frankia genomes, suggesting a wider range of nutritional
sources used. The comparatively small size of the Frankia
secretomes may reflect the narrow scope of carbon sources
utilized by Frankia strains, especially strains CcI3 and
ACN, which have less than half of the solute-binding proteins found in EAN (Table 1, Additional File 2). The secretion of relatively few proteins could also affect its
recognition as "friend or foe" by host plants. Unlike the
extensive biopolymer-degrading capability observed in
Streptomyces, it may be beneficial for Frankia to secrete few
degrading enzymes in its mutualistic interactions with
plants.
Secretory hydrolases
A major objective of the current study was to screen the
Frankia genomes for secreted hydrolytic enzymes, which
have been hypothesized to play a role in nodulation. As
seen in Table 1, the Frankia genomes have between 10–21
hydrolases with signal peptides predicted by both SignalP
methods (NN and HMM), and an additional 6–9 predicted by only one SignalP method. Table 2 lists all hydrolytic enzymes identified in at least one Frankia strain with
signal peptides predicted by at least one SignalP method
(NN or HMM). Those marked with "‡" had signal peptides predicted only after manual inspection of the N-terminal alignments, and adjustment of the start sites to
match those of the other two strains (see Methods).
Sequences listed in the same row retrieved one another in
a BLAST search using a permissive E value cutoff of 10-5.
An "x" in Table 2 indicates the absence of any hits to other
frankial sequences at this E value. In many cases,
sequences with signal peptides predicted in one strain lack
signal peptides in the corresponding proteins in other
strains (denoted by †). This may be due to ancestral N-terminal sequences having diverged significantly in each lineage. Alternatively, the similarly annotated proteins
within a row may actually only share a conserved domain,
but belong to different families. If this is the case, the presence or absence of a signal peptide in one or more strains
may indicate distinct ancestral origin, with only superficial (or convergent) similarity to other sequences retrieved
in a BLAST search.

Of the secretory hydrolases, lipolytic and esterolytic
enzymes had the most signal peptides predicted (Table 2).
Lipases and esterases secreted by frankial strains could

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/47

depolymerize components of plant cell walls, or could
modify lipid-based signaling molecules generated by
plants in response to stress or pathogen attack [31]. There
have been no direct reports of lipase activity in Frankia
strains, though whole cell esterase zymograms have been
used to distinguish between isolates, and the addition of
long chain fatty acids to culture media enhances growth of
some strains [32,33]. Lipase activity may be conferred by
a conserved secretory lipase (discussed below) or by the
putative lipases, one of which (gi|86743055 in CcI3) is
similar to a GDSL lipase from Streptomyces rimosus that has
demonstrated lipolytic activity [34]. Another possible
lipolytic enzyme found in the three strains is annotated as
patatin, which is a storage glycoprotein in potato tubers
that can act as an acyl hydrolase. Patatin-like proteins are
found in many bacterial species, and phospholipase A2
activity has been shown for the patatin homolog ExoU, an
exotoxin secreted via Type III secretion by P. aeruginosa
[35]. Esterolytic proteins in Frankia could potentially
cleave ester linkages in complex plant polysaccharides,
liberating compounds for use as carbon sources or signaling molecules. For example, GDSL lipases can act as
acetylxylan esterases, and feruloyl esterases cleave ferulic
acid from the sugar backbone of pectin [36,37]. The polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerase-like proteins could
degrade polyesters such as suberin, a polyester found in
plant root cell walls that consists of lipids and phenolic
compounds. The accumulation of suberin in cell walls
around Frankia-infected cells has been observed in Casuarina nodules [38].
In contrast to lipases and esterases, polysaccharidedegrading enzymes with signal peptides are less prevalent
(Table 2). Strain EAN, which has the largest genome and
widest host range, has the most polysaccharolytic
enzymes, followed closely by ACN, while CcI3 has the
fewest, possessing only general "glycoside hydrolase"
genes. Two putative cellulolytic proteins are found in
strains ACN and EAN, with a signal peptide predicted only
in one EAN sequence. CcI3 lacks both of these cellulase
genes. EAN (EaN1pec) has a single pectate lyase gene
(gi|158314134, not shown), which is absent from CcI3
and ACN. This protein was not predicted to contain a signal peptide, though it is most similar to a pectate lyase in
S. avermitilis that has a predicted Tat signal peptide.
Another putative pectin-degrading enzyme found only in
strain EAN is an arabinogalactan endo-1,4-beta-galactosidase, which shows highest sequence similarity to this
enzyme in Burkholderia cenocepacia (42% identity, E value
of 10-64). Frankia strains share a group of hypothetical
proteins ("putative glycosidases" in Table 2) with several
features indicating that they may act as hydrolases: all
share a beta-mannanase (ManB) domain, and several are
similar to Glycoside Hydrolase Family 26 or have low hits
to the (Trans)-Glycosidase protein superfamily (see Meth-

ods). These proteins may potentially interact with plant
cell wall polysaccharides, or with glycoproteins or glycolipids on the frankial cell envelope. No clear polysaccharases have signal peptides predicted in all three strains.
Finally, a variety of proteolytic enzymes appear to be
secreted by Frankia. Peptidases with clear housekeeping
functions in growth and cell wall remodeling are omitted
from Table 2. Extracellular peptidases have been detected
in culture supernatants of Frankia strains [6,39]. Muller
and Benoist [39] described a 1300 kDa proteinase complex, composed of 11 proteinase subunits, from both cell
extracts and the extracellular concentrate of Frankia strain
BR, a Casuarina isolate. Based on the cleavage specificity of
the proteinase subunits, Benoist et al. suggested a role in
degrading cell wall proteins such as extensins [7]. The two
conserved signal peptide-containing serine proteases
belonging to the S1/S6/Hap family may mediate attachment to host cell surfaces, as these are similar to the Haemophilus influenzae adhesin Hap, which binds to the
extracellular matrix of human cells [40]. Frankia strains
can use peptides and amino acids (and have branchedchain amino acid binding proteins with signal peptides)
so the presence of proteases is not unexpected.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed to trace the origin of
selected hydrolytic enzyme genes in the Frankia strains
(asterisks in Table 2), and to provide insight on their relevance to the ecology of Frankia. Several patterns become
apparent: first, conservation of a gene with a single copy
in the three strains that is also present in actinobacterial
ancestors. The secretory lipase gene, shown in Figure 3(A),
is one of the few examples of this among hydrolases. A
second pattern observed is the loss of a hydrolase gene in
one or two strains. Losses have occurred most often in the
genome of CcI3, which is the smallest of the three and has
lost many other genes [2]. As shown in Figure 3(B), two
cellulase genes are found in EAN and ACN and in closely
related actinobacterial genomes, but have been lost from
CcI3. Gene loss may account for the presence of other
polysaccharases only in strains ACN and EAN. In contrast,
several hydrolases appear to have been acquired separately by one or two Frankia strains. A feruloyl esterase
gene is seen in both EAN and ACN, but there is minimal
similarity between the sequences, and the tree in Figure
3(C) suggests that these did not originate from a common
actinobacterial ancestor, but rather may have been
acquired from distantly related soil microorganisms. The
fourth notable pattern is that of gene family expansion
within the Frankia lineage. The four to six poly-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerase-like gene families depicted
in Figure 3(D) seem to have undergone duplication in a
frankial ancestor. The Frankia sequences are more similar
to each other than to any other sequences in the database;
the outgroup shown belongs to the lipoprotein family

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/47

LpqC (also in COG3509) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The expansion and retention of this group of genes points
to Frankia-specific function, though interestingly, most of
the sequences in strain ACN lack signal peptides, while
these are predicted in the other two strains. Another gene
family expansion is shown in Figure 3(E), which includes
a total of 20 Frankia sequences, ten with signal peptides
(see "putative glycosidases" in Table 2), and ten without.
While non-Frankia sequences were retrieved in BLAST
searches, these did not clearly associate with any Frankia
sequences, and so were excluded from this unrooted tree.
In summary, esterases, lipases, and proteases are better
represented across Frankia strains than polysaccharidedegrading enzymes. The presence of a few more polysaccharases in strain EAN may be a factor in EAN's ability to
penetrate plant roots intercellularly via cracks in roots, or
may reflect the wider carbon source usage of this strain
during saprophytic growth [41]. The patterns of hydrolase
gene retention, loss, acquisition, and duplication illustrated in Figure 3 emphasize the divergent life histories of
individual strains, a topic addressed on a genome-wide
scale by Normand et al. [2].
The core Frankia secretome
Secreted proteins that are essential for the actinorhizal
symbiosis are likely to be highly conserved in Frankia
strains, and may lack homologs in closely related actinobacteria. To circumscribe this group of proteins, we first
identified the core proteome, consisting of orthologous
proteins in all three strains (top-scoring reciprocal BLAST
hits, in the three bi-directional comparisons, using an Evalue threshold of 10-20). At this E value, a total of 2080
sequences belonged to the core proteome. When the
sequences of the core proteome (2080 sequences from
each genome) were analyzed with SignalP, the signal peptide predictions for these orthologous proteins varied
from strain to strain. It was thus necessary to define a limit
for including a given protein in the core secretome. We
defined the core secretome as proteins within the core
proteome that had signal peptides predicted by at least
one SignalP method (NN, HMM, or both) and zero to two
TM domains, in at least two of the three strains. Of the initial 2080 proteins in the core proteome, 77 were predicted
to contain signal peptides in all three strains, and 83 more
had signal peptides in two strains; therefore, 161 proteins
are estimated to encompass the core Frankia secretome
(Table 1, column 4). Notably, only nine hydrolases
belong to the core secretome, and these are mainly proteases, esterases, and lipases. The complete listing of proteins in the core secretome can be found in Additional File
4.

To narrow this set of proteins to those highly conserved
within the Frankia lineage, the 161 sequences of the core

secretome (from each genome) were BLAST searched
against genomes of four actinobacterial species closely
related to Frankia: Acidothermus cellulolyticus, Kineococcus
radiotolerans, Streptomyces avermitilis, and Nocardia farcinica. A total of 52 sequences from the core secretome did
not show significant alignment, at an E value cutoff of 1020, to proteins of these close actinobacterial relatives.
These proteins are termed Frankia-specific (see Table 1,
column 5), and are listed in Table 3. About half of these
sequences, especially the hypothetical proteins, did not
retrieve any BLAST hits to actinobacterial proteins at a less
stringent E value cutoff of 10-5. Since the sequence alignments have E values very close to zero across the three
Frankia strains, it is probable that these proteins carry out
novel functions, perhaps governing the interactions with
host plants.
Other proteins listed in Table 3 may have roles in the
actinorhizal symbiosis. The proteins listed under "Metabolism" include a peptidylprolyl isomerase, which could
assist in modifying the proline-rich proteins of the plant
cell wall, or may ensure proper folding of secreted proteins. A peptidylprolyl isomerase (Mip) in Legionella pneumophila, in concert with a serine protease, facilitates entry
into lung epithelial cells [42]. The lipopolysaccharide or
poly-γ-glutamate biosynthesis proteins may alter cell surface characteristics, contributing to host recognition of the
frankial cell envelope. The former has minimal similarity
to other proteins in the non-redundant database, while
the latter is similar (33% identity, E value of 10-37) to a
capsule biosynthesis protein from Bacillus thuringiensis.
Twelve solute-binding proteins are found in the core Frankia secreteome. The extracellular solute-binding protein
(Family 1) has highly conserved sequence across Frankia,
with the next best BLAST hits revealing low sequence similarity to sugar-binding proteins in Mesorhizobium loti and
Rhizobium leguminosarium (E values of 10-17). TRAP-type
transporters, akin to those in rhizobia, could transport
dicarboxylic acids, known carbon sources of some Frankia
strains. We propose that these conserved secreted proteins, especially those with little homology to other bacterial proteins, are likely candidates for symbiosis-related
functions.
Genome map
Mapping the gene locations of core secretome proteins on
the CcI3 chromosome (Figure 1) revealed clustering of
conserved secreted proteins, in some cases adjacent to
secretion machinery genes. The outer two circles (after the
scale) depict the secretion machinery genes, and putative
prophage regions, respectively. The third circle in shows
the genes encoding the proteins of the core secretome,
while the fourth circle in depicts the genes for the proteins
in the core Frankia-specific secretome. Colors indicate
which strains have signal peptides predicted, as noted in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/47

the legend. None of the genes encoding core secretome
proteins are located within prophage neighborhoods, and
no horizontally transferred "secretion islands" are evident. Clustering of core secretome genes near the origin of
replication is seen; this region of the chromosome also
shows the most synteny among the three strains, and contains the nif genes required for nitrogen fixation [2]. Several clusters of core secretome genes are located close to
secretion machinery genes (arrows, Figure 1). Beginning
very close to the origin of replication, one putative secretory region of the Frankia CcI3 chromosome, from
roughly 0.035 to 0.096 Mbp, includes the single conserved VirB4-like gene ("T4" in Figure 1). This stretch of
40 ORFs encodes thirteen proteins with signal peptides,
four of which are Frankia-specific, as well as an additional
nine Frankia-specific proteins (without signal peptides).
The secreted proteins include the secretory lipase, the
poly-gamma-glutamate biosynthesis protein, the S1/S6/
Hap family peptidase, and a PHB depolymerase. In
another region, between 0.87 and 0.92 Mbp, the conserved patatin gene is situated several genes downstream
of the secA gene, and a few genes upstream of an operon
of T2S genes. Downstream of the T2S genes is a conserved
hypothetical protein, "Francci3_0789," which has Tat signal peptides predicted in all three strains. This region has
five Frankia-specific secreted proteins (out of 40 ORFs), as
well as an additional twelve signal peptide-containing
proteins and nine Frankia-specific (non-secretory) proteins. Other Frankia-specific hypothetical proteins are
clustered in regions near 4.1 Mbp and 4.7 Mbp (Figure 1).
Several potential Tat-translocated proteins are found near
4.1 Mbp, and three highly conserved hypothetical proteins
(Francci3_3886,
Francci3_3889,
and
Francci3_3891) near 4.7 Mbp are located upstream of a
channel protein of the hemolysin III family, which could
facilitate protein export. The two peptidylprolyl isomerase
genes are located near secretion machinery genes. The
cyclophilin-type peptidylprolyl isomerase is located
shortly downstream of the operon containing yajC, secD,
and secF, while the other (FKBP-type) is found four genes
away from the tatA/tatC genes. Two genes encoding proteins with putative Tat signal peptides predicted by TATFIND are roughly fifteen genes away from the tatA/C
genes. One of these is a phosphoesterase; the other is
annotated as a Dyp-type peroxidase (Additional File 3).
Both of these types of proteins were shown to be secreted
via the Tat pathway in other bacteria [43,44]. By situating
genes in putative secretory regions of the genome, the
gene neighborhoods in Figure 1 both highlight regions of
interest and support the signal peptide predictions for
these sequences.

Conclusion
We screened three Frankia genomes for genes encoding
protein secretion machinery and proteins with signal pep-

tides. The protein secretion systems present in Frankia correlate with those found in other actinobacteria, but the
predicted secretomes are reduced in size compared to
those of other soil bacteria. We propose that this is an
adaptation to an endosymbiotic lifestyle, in which Frankia
secretes few proteins that might trigger host defenses. The
Frankia genomes we examined do not have a conserved
set of obvious polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes. This
finding challenges the hypothesis that Frankia hydrolyzes
plant cell wall polymers during nodulation, though it is
possible that the general glycosidases, esterases, or proteases contribute to this function. Genomic evidence suggests that polysaccharases are used to a greater or lesser
degree depending on the lifestyle and mode of infection
of particular strains, with strain CcI3 having lost secretory
hydrolase genes present in the other two strains. The EAN
genome also includes four arabinofuranosidases and two
rhamnosidases without signal peptides, absent from CcI3
and ACN, which may be used to break down oligosacccharides derived from hemicelluloses. In the absence of
plant cell wall degradation, it is likely that Frankia secretes
novel classes of effector proteins to communicate with its
host, a situation similar to that recently described in the
biotrophic plant pathogenic fungus, Ustilago maydis, that
is also deficient in cell wall hydrolytic enzymes[45]. The
core Frankia secretome represents a conserved set of candidate proteins, including those with hydrolytic, surfaceassociated, solute-binding, and unknown functions, to
assess for involvement in root infection. Mapping the
locations of conserved secreted protein genes allowed us
to identify genomic "hotspots" containing potentially
secreted proteins and other unique frankial proteins. This
genome-based Frankia secretome, combined with ongoing proteomics studies, will help navigate the way to a
more complete understanding of the actinorhizal symbiosis.

Methods
Sequence analysis
The FASTA amino acid sequences of the three Frankia
genomes [CcI3, NCBI RefSeq: NC_007777; ACN14a,
NCBI RefSeq: NC_008278; EaN1pec, NCBI RefSeq:
NC_009921] and from the Streptomyces avermitilis [GenBank: BA000030], Nocardia farcinica [GenBank:
AP006618], Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 [GenBank: AE000516], Kineococcus radiotolerans [GenBank:
cellulolyticus
[GenBank:
CP000750], Acidothermus
Bradyrhizobium
japonicum
[GenBank:
CP00481],
BA000040], and Sinorhizobium meliloti [GenBank:
AL591688] genomes (including the two S. meliloti plasmids, pSymA [GenBank: AE006469] and pSymB [GenBank: AL591985]) were obtained from the GenBank or
NCBI RefSeq FTP sites [46,47]. All sequences were truncated to the first 70 amino acids and analyzed with the
SignalP 3.0 program [20]. Sequences predicted to contain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/47

a signal peptide by SignalP were analyzed with TMHMM
2.0 [48] to determine the number of transmembrane
(TM) domains. The CDS translations of the three Frankia
genomes were also searched for the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) sequence motif using TATFIND 1.4 [21]. TATFIND searches for the motif [HAPKRNTGSDQE] RR
[APKRNTGSDQE] [IWFLVYMCHAPNT] [ILVMF] within
the first 35 amino acids of a sequence (where any of the
amino acids in brackets satisfy the match) and scores positive if this motif is followed by hydrophobic stretch of at
least 13 amino acids (within 22 downstream residues).
Identification of hydrolytic enzymes
Hydrolytic enzymes were identified with the annotation
provided by the Joint Genome Institute (CcI3 and EAN)
or MaGe (ACN) [29,30]. To confirm that none of the signal peptide-containing hypothetical proteins were hydrolases, these sequences were searched for conserved
domains with the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture
Research Tool) program, and analyzed for hits to SCOP
(Structural Classification of Proteins) protein superfamilies using the Superfamily 1.69 server [49,50]. The
SCOP superfamily analysis led to the identification of
four hypothetical proteins with slight similarity (E values
between 10-5 and 10-22) to the "(Trans)glycosidase" superfamily (see Table 2 and Figure 3E) and three with hits (E
values between 10-8 and 10-27) to the "Pectin lyase-like"
superfamily (see Additional File 2). In addition, to confirm that the gene annotation and BLAST searches had not
missed cellulase, pectinase, or xylanase genes in the frankial genomes, a PSI-BLAST search was performed [51].
The three genomes were searched using point-specific
scoring matrices (PSSMs) of nine conserved hydrolase
domains (three Pfam or COG domains for each type of
hydrolase listed above) obtained from the NCBI conserved domain database (CDD) FTP site [52]. Only the
previously identified polysaccharide-degrading enzymes
were retrieved using this method.

For construction of phylogenetic trees, a representative
subset of top-scoring BLAST hits was chosen and amino
acid sequences were aligned with MUSCLE [53]. To generate trees, PhyML (maximum likelihood method) was used
with the JTT substitution matrix and 100 non-parametric
bootstrap replicates [54]. Trees were visualized using
TreeView [55].
Identification of the core secretome
To find orthologous proteins shared among the three
strains, the complete CDSs from each Frankia genome
were BLAST searched against those of the other two
strains, using an E-value threshold of 10-20 [56]. Using a
custom Perl script, we identified the sequences that
retrieved each other as the top BLAST hit (orthologs) in all
three bi-directional comparisons. The amino acid

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:47

sequences of these 6240 proteins (2080 from each strain)
were then analyzed with SignalP 3.0 and TMHMM 2.0. Of
these orthologous sequences, those with signal peptides
predicted by one or both SignalP methods (NN or HMM)
and having 0–2 transmembrane domains, in two or three
of the strains, were considered to belong to the core Frankia secretome.
Manual inspection of start codons
In cases where sequences from two strains had signal peptides predicted but the orthologous sequence from the
third did not, the start codon region of that sequence was
inspected manually, based on the amino acid sequence
alignment with its orthologs. Alignments were viewed
with the BLink tool from NCBI [57], and upstream
regions were viewed with Artemis through the Frankia alni
ACN14a Genoscope website, and the Integrated Microbial
Genomes (IMG) website [29,58]. Depending on the conserved start position seen in the N-terminal sequence
alignments, and on the presence of a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence upstream of the start codon, some start
sites were manually adjusted and analyzed again with SignalP. A total of 48 sequences in strain ACN were inspected
(because CcI3 and EAN had signal peptides in the orthologous sequences); of these, 20 were predicted to contain a
signal peptide after manual adjustment. Manual inspection of start codons was also carried out for sequences in
the core proteome with a signal peptide predicted in only
one strain (by both SignalP methods). Of 104 proteins
inspected, only one additional signal peptide was predicted (ACN, gi|111220881). As a control measure, a subset of hydrolases lacking signal peptides was inspected to
verify that signal peptides were not missed due to incorrect start codon annotation. After scanning the genome
for intracellular hydrolases (of the types listed in Table 2,
but not already present in this table), 96 were found in
CcI3, 129 in ACN, and 195 in EAN. These were BLAST
searched against each of the other genomes, and subgroups were selected in which the start position of the
alignment between the query and subject sequences was >
10 amino acids apart. The N-terminal regions of 25 conserved intracellular hydrolases, and 8 hydrolases unique
to EAN were inspected, and none of these resulted in new
signal peptide predictions.
