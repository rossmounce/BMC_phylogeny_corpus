However, many of them are known to produce functional proteins and give rise to lineage-specific new functional genes [35].
Functional processed copies of genes can emerge as intronless duplications of the parental transcript [3,6] or recruit
additional exons from the insertion site, producing a chimeric
gene. The first retrogene described in Drosophila, jingwei, is

information

Retrogenes are processed copies of genes that originate
through reverse-transcription of a parental mRNA and insertion into the organism's genome [1]. This duplication mechanism produces a copy of the parental gene that should not
contain introns, or most cis-regulatory regions. Processed
copies of protein coding genes were described early in mammals because of their abundance. Retroposed gene copies are
often believed to be pseudogenes because they lack regulatory

interactions

Conclusion: Together, these results indicate that retroposition is a persistent mechanism and a
recurrent pathway for the emergence of new genes in Drosophila.

refereed research

Results: Based on this analysis, we infer that functional retrogenes have emerged at a fairly
constant rate of 0.5 genes per million years per lineage over the last approximately 63 million years
of Drosophila evolution. The number of functional retrogenes and the rate at which they are
recruited in the D. melanogaster lineage are of the same order of magnitude as those estimated in
the human lineage, despite the higher deletion bias in the Drosophila genome. However, unlike
primates, the rate of retroposition in Drosophila seems to be fairly constant and no burst of
retroposition can be inferred from our analyses. In addition, our data also support an important
role for retrogenes as a source of lineage-specific male functions, in agreement with previous
hypotheses. Finally, we identified three cases of functional retrogenes in D. melanogaster that have
been independently retroposed and recruited in parallel as new genes in other Drosophila lineages.

deposited research

Background: Processed copies of genes (retrogenes) are duplicate genes that originated through
the reverse-transcription of a host transcript and insertion in the genome. This type of gene
duplication, as any other, could be a source of new genes and functions. Using whole genome
sequence data for 12 Drosophila species, we dated the origin of 94 retroposition events that gave
rise to candidate functional genes in D. melanogaster.

of the latter type [5]. Even when processed copies of genes
lose protein coding capacity, they can lead to regulatory RNAs
(that is, micro RNAs [7]) or retroposed regulatory sequences
[8]. Many will degenerate, becoming disabled non-expressed
copies of genes, or be deleted from the genome. In humans,
non-functional processed copies of genes (retropseudogenes)
are found in large numbers (approximately 8,000) [4,9]. In
contrast, dysfunctional relics of retroposed gene copies are
relatively scarce in fruit flies (about 20 are detectable in Drosophila melanogaster) [10]. This contrasting pattern has
been proposed as additional evidence in favor of the differences in deletion rate of nonfunctional DNA between these
two species [10,11].

when compared to their parental gene (see Materials and
methods and Additional data file 1). Out of the 97 retrogenes,
we detected 3 events of tandem duplication that must have
occurred after retroposition (Additional data file 1), which
yield a minimum estimate of 94 retroposition events. This is
a minimum estimate because: we used a cut-off level of protein identity of 50%, over at least 70% of the protein of both
genes; we did not include partially processed copies, that is,
copies that retained some introns but show the other features
of retroposition [16]; and we cannot infer retroposition for
intronless genes (which account for 18% of the annotated
genes in the D. melanogaster genome) because there is no
intron loss that can be used as the hallmark of retroposition.

However, at what rate different genomes recruit new functional protein-coding genes from retroposed gene copies is
still an open question. Recently, it has been estimated that
human functional retrogenes originated at a rate of approximately one gene per million years (My) per lineage [12]. The
rates at which functional retrogenes arose in other species are
unknown. Here, we focus on functional protein coding retrogenes in Drosophila. We increased the list of known retrogenes in D. melanogster by identifying retrogenes
independently of the location of the parental gene and at a
less stringent level of protein identity (50%) than in previous
studies (for example, [13]). This allows for the analyses of a
most confident and comprehensive set of candidate functional retrogenes that originated in the lineage leading to D.
melanogaster. The systematic assessment of the presence or
absence of these retrogenes in the other 11 sequenced
genomes of Drosophila provides a solid framework for inferring the age of each retrogene independently of sequence
divergence analysis and for the calculation of a minimum rate
of generation of functional retrogenes. We infer that functional retrogenes arose at a fairly constant rate of 0.51 genes
per My per lineage. Many of these new genes recruited male
germline function, suggesting an important role for retrogenes as a way of generating lineage-specific male functions.
Unexpectedly, we show that three of the parental genes that
gave rise to functional retrogenes described in D. melanogaster (Cervantes, Dntf-2 and Ran) have also independently given rise to functional retrogenes in parallel in other
Drosophila lineages.

Six of the retrogenes appear to have arisen from partial retroposition events, where, in the alignment of the protein coding
region of parental and retrogene, the retrogene appears
slightly shorter at the 5' ends compared to the parental gene.
This type of truncation is typical of non-long terminal repeat
retotransposons and can be attributed to incomplete reverse
transcription, which initiates at the 3' end of the retroposon
transcript [17]. The occurrence of 5' truncation in some Drosophila retrogenes suggests that, as in mammals, they are
generated through the illegitimate action of retroposons'
enzymatic machinery on cellular mRNAs [18]. There are also
11 retrogenes in which 5' or 3' introns in the untranslated
region (UTR) or coding regions were acquired from the region
of insertion (Additional data file 1). None of these are chimeric with other known genes; the new introns and exons
represent newly recruited regions from previously non-coding intergenic DNA flanking the insertion site. There are
already known examples of this [19,20]. In our annotation
procedure, we required the pairs parental/retrogene to align
over at least 70% of the proteins encoded by each gene and
this precluded us from finding other types of chimeric
retrogenes.

Results and discussion
Retrogene annotation
Additional data file 1 [including references [13-15]] shows the
97 candidate functional retrogenes that were identified in this
study. These are annotated genes whose gene structure, compared to their closest paralogous gene in the genome (hereafter referred to as the parental gene), revealed that they most
likely originated through retroposition. All these genes are
well-supported functional genes; they are known genes (they
have been named because their function is known), transcribed and/or display clear signals of purifying selection

Rate of origination of retrogenes
The presence/absence of a particular retroposed gene in
related species can help in dating the retroposition event in a
phylogenetic context. Together with reliable estimates of species divergence times [21], these data can provide a robust
estimate of the rate of gene acquisition by the genomes. Here
we used the wealth of data from 11 recently sequenced Drosophila genomes to date the origination of each retrogene
found in D. melanogaster over the last approximately 63 My
of Drosophila evolution (see Materials and methods). Figure
1 summarizes our findings for the retrogenes, while phylogenetic inferences for parental genes and tandem duplication
events of retrogenes and the details of all inferences (that is,
presence/absence in the different genomes) are given in
Additional data file 2. We have studied the correlation
between our gene age estimate and either KS or KA (Additional
data file 3); we observed a significant correlation for these
(Kendall's τKs = 0.6716, P < 0.000001; and Kendall's τKa =
0.4712, P = 0.00015) [22]. At the same time, we observed that

Similarly to Betrán et al. [13], we tested whether functional
retrogenes were produced in excess from X chromosome
parental genes and transposed to autosomal locations. Consistent with previous results, we found a very significant
excess of autosomal retrogenes originating from parental
genes located on the X chromosome in D. melanogaster (P =
0.000001; Additional data file 5). Other studies suggest that
this is consistent with mammals [4].
Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this pattern of duplication. It is known that X chromosomes experience inactivation in males during spermatogenesis [24,25].
Thus, a mutant with a newly retroposed gene in an autosome
might have some advantage over the ancestral individual
because it can carry out a function required in male germline
cells after X chromosome inactivation [4,6,13,24]. Recently, it
also has been suggested that, according to sexual antagonism
models, the autosomes can be a more favorable location for
male-biased genes [26-28].

We found four parental/retrogene pairs that are proteasome
component proteins: Pros29/Prosα3T, Pros35/Prosα6T,
Pros28.1/Pros28.1A and Prosβ5R1/CG31742. Three of the

in our parental/retrogene pairs ([29]). The range of functions
is very diverse and eight parental/retrogene pairs have no
known function. We found some interesting GO categories
represented in our pairs. Many of these are related to malespecific function during spermatogenesis.

refereed research

Recently, the rate of functional retrogene origination in primates during the last approximately 63 My of evolution
(roughly the same timeframe examined in the present study)
was estimated to be 1 retrogene per My per lineage [12]. Our
results indicate, therefore, that the rate of functional (coding)
retrogene acquisition is likely of the same order of magnitude
in Drosophila and primates. It should be noted that the rate
estimated by Marques et al. [12] for human retrogenes relies
on synonymous divergence to assign genes to a particular lineage, a method that may not be completely accurate for dating
retroposition events (Additional data file 3). In contrast, our
method was independent of sequence divergence calculations
and the molecular clock and, thus, may be viewed as more

Retrogene origination pattern

deposited research

From these data, a minimum rate of retrogene origination of
0.51 (32 genes/62.9 My) genes per My per lineage can be estimated (Figure 1). This means that approximately one functional retrogene was generated every 2 My during the
Drosophila radiation. Many studies suggest that there is a
high rate of generation of processed copies of genes in mammals according to the large number of processed copies of
genes found in the genomes [4,23]. This has been related to
the preponderance and high level of activity of L1 retrotransposable elements, which are able to provide the enzymatic
machinery for the retroposition of cellular genes [18]. However, independently of the rate of generation of processed
copies of genes in mammals, the rate at which new functional
retrogenes arose in this lineage was projected to be much
lower because the vast majority of retrogenes are obvious
pseudogenes [4,23].

To explore if the rate of retrogene origination has been constant throughout the period examined, we estimated the rate
in every internal node of the Drosophila phylogeny (Figure 1).
These estimates, around 0.45 (ranging from 0.51 to 0.36), are
very similar for every node except for the youngest internal
node (0.19). However, this estimate is based on a very small
sample size (only one functional retrogene was gained during
this period). We also have to consider that divergence times
are accompanied by considerable standard errors [21]. Nonetheless, the results strongly suggest that the rate of functional
retrogene origination has been fairly constant during the last
approximately 63 My of the Drosophila radiation and no
burst of retroposition can be inferred from this data, unlike
those observed in primates [12].

reports

variance increases with gene age for both KS and KA (Additional data file 3). This shows that our age estimates are congruent with the sequence divergence of the retrogenes from
their parental genes, but that sequence divergence may not be
a completely satisfactory measure of age.

reliable. On the other hand, the comparison of the amount of
constraint genes versus pseudogenes used by Marques et al.
[12] to assign functionality of retrogenes is a very stringent
approach that may lead to a severe underestimate of the
actual rate of new genes originating by retroposition in the
primate lineage.

scribed only during late spermatogenesis, while the parental
genes are widely expressed [30,31]. All of these retrogenes are
located on autosomes and one of them originated from a
parental gene located on the X chromosome. This gene
(Pros28.1A) thus fits the expectation of the out of X/male
function pattern [13]. Other additional proteasome component proteins have been shown to be male-specific and it has
been suggested that a sperm-specific proteasome is assembled and has a function different from the housekeeping proteasome in testis [31]. Our results demonstrate that three of
the testes-specific proteasome components are, in fact, retrogenes that originated from housekeeping genes and subsequently recruited their male-specific function. Interestingly,
these three retrogenes are not present in all the species of
Drosophila examined in this study. Prosα6T originated in
branch 1 (Figure 1) and it is present in only nine of the
sequenced genomes. Prosα3T and Pros28.1A originated in
branch 4 and they are present in only five of the sequenced
genomes. Therefore, it is likely that the alleged testes-specific
proteasome is of fairly recent origin and it is even tempting to
speculate that its emergence contributed to species boundaries (that is, hybrid sterility). However, there are no mutants
for these genes and, therefore, it is not known if the lack of
their function can cause sterility or any other effect.
We also found two retrogenes predicted to encode ribosomal
proteins (RpS15Ab and RpL37b), which are both autosomal
retrogenes derived from X-linked ribosomal parental genes.
Interestingly, Vinckenbosch et al. [32] also identified two
functional retroposed copies of ribosomal proteins in humans
that were also derived from X-linked genes transposed to
autosomal locations. Together, these findings provide further
support for the out of X hypothesis and are contrary to the
belief that duplicates of ribosomal proteins are generally lost
because of dosage effects [32]. Many other active ribosomal
protein retrogenes, and even more inactive ones, have been
found in mammals [33].
In addition, our retrogene set includes 15 retrogenes with
similarity to known mitochondrial gene functions: CG17856,
CG6255, CG4706, CG9582, tomboy40, Hsp60B, CG9920,
EfTuM, CG14508, CG5718, CG11913, CG10748, CG10749,
CG18418 and CG7514. Many of the retrogenes in these pairs
(87%) are expressed in testis and some of them are known to
have testis-specific functions. In testes, mitochondria are
known to change shape (condense) and change function during spermatogenesis [34]. While spermatogonia can utilize
aerobic pathways (that is, glucose) for energy production,
spermatocytes have limited access to glucose and rely on lactate and pyruvate from Sertoli cells. These changes are
accompanied by changes in gene expression [34]. Some of
these changes may be accomplished through gene duplication
followed by evolution of a male-specific pattern of expression
for one of the paralogs. Our results suggest that retroposition
is a major mechanism underlying the genetic innovation necessary for this physiological transition.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/1/R11

In Drosophila, testis-specific mitochondrial outer membrane
translocators (tom genes) have been described (tomboy20
and tomboy40) [35]. These are duplicates of tom20 and
tom40 [35]. Both tomboy20 and tomboy40 are male-specific
intronless genes with a closely related intron-containing gene
homolog, suggesting that they were generated by retroposition. However, only the pair tomboy40/tom40 was retrieved
by our search. The relatively low identity (47%) between
Tomboy20 and Tom20 proteins [35] explains why the other
pair was not included in our set. Tomboy20/tom20 is an
autosome to autosome retroposition, while tomboy40/
tom40 was an X to autosome event, in accord with the prediction of the out of the X hypothesis. The exact functions of
tomboy20 and tomboy40 are not known, but it is plausible
that these proteins are incorporated into an outer membrane
translocation complex that has mitochondrial male specificity for certain male proteins [35]. Another example of a
male-specific gene related to mitochondrial function in Drosophila, identified by our screen as a functional retrogene, is
hsp60B. It encodes a heat shock protein that has been
reported to be essential for spermatid individualization [36].
Additional examples of retrogenes that are testis- and/or
male-specific in our set include Arp53D, an actin related protein expressed only in testis, gskt, a male germline-specific
protein kinase required for male fertility and recently named
mojoless (R Kalamegham, D Sturgill, E Siegfried, and B
Oliver, personal communication), roc1b, which causes male
sterility, CG9573, which maps in a male sterility locus [29],
and Dntf-2r, which is highly expressed in testis [3]. Therefore, many retrogenes appear to have evolved male functions
(see also the 'Out of the testes' section).

Out of the testes
Recently, a very forward hypothesis has been suggested after
studying the pattern of expression of likely functional retrocopies in primates: the 'out of the testes' hypothesis [32]. This
hypothesis states that functional retrogenes are initially
expressed in testes, which may contribute to their immediate
preservation, but later acquire a higher and broader tissue
expression, which may eventually lead to the evolution of
other new functions.
Tissue expression analyses revealed that a higher percentage
of parental genes than retrogenes are represented in all the
libraries analyzed, with the exception of an adult testis library
(AT; Additional data file 5, adult testis 2). However, the percentage of retrogenes that are expressed in adult testis is 53%,
while 42% of the parental genes are expressed in this tissue.
Parental genes also tend to be expressed in more tissues than
retrogenes do: average number of libraries (that is, tissues) is
7.15 versus 2.70 for the retrogenes. This reveals that many
retrogenes are expressed primarily in testis, similar to the
observations in human [32].

These data provide compelling cases of intron gains in multiple genes. But how long does it take to acquire a new intron?
We investigated whether those genes that acquired new
intron/exon structures are older than average. We again used
KA, KS and phylogenetic distribution as measures of age and
compared only retrogenes for which UTRs have been anno-

Another possible, but again likely less parsimonious, explanation to the relocation of retrogenes in different lineages would
be the existence of two ancient retroduplications and the loss
of one or the other duplicate gene in the different lineages.

information

We consider the hypothesis of independent insertion less parsimonious given the way genes group in the KS and protein
tree (Additional data file 6), that is, all parental and all retrogenes group apart, but if the mutation rate is higher in the retrogene location, we could be seeing some type of long branch
attraction in the case of CG7423 and CG9013. CG6036 is on
another Muller chromosomal arm only in D. pseudoobscura
and D. persimilis and that is more difficult to explain with
independent insertions because it is an internal lineage.

interactions

In this work, we consider a gene to be a chimeric gene if it
recruited additional introns and exons from the genomic
regions flanking the insertion site. Out of eleven such chimeric retrogenes identified (Additional data file 1), one
recruited a new coding region, eight recruited 5' UTR additional introns and exons, and two recruited 3' UTR additional
introns and exons. It is important to point out that, in all the
cases, the new introns and exons were recruited from noncoding regions flanking the insertion site and apparently not
from pre-existing genes. However, the design of our screen to
identify retrogenes somewhat precluded finding chimeric retrogenes that originated from two existing genes (see Materials and methods).

refereed research

While assessing the presence/absence of a particular gene in
the different sequenced genomes, we observed three
instances where a retrogene had apparently been relocated
from its initial insertion site. In these cases, a clear ortholog
of the retrogene could be identified in a given genome, but it
was not in a syntenic location compared to other related
genomes (see Materials and methods and Additional data file
6). We consider as evidence of clear orthology the fact that, in
these gene families, parental and derived genes are the best
hit in the genomes and, in the phylogeny, they group completely apart, as expected when the duplication is ancient,
independently of their location in a particular genome (Additional data file 6). CG7423 and CG9013 seem to be in a different Muller chromosomal arm in D. virilis, D. mojavensis and
D. grimshawi. CG6036 is on another Muller chromosomal
arm in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. We consider
these events the product of duplication and loss of the gene in
the original position and assume that the gene is as old as the
relocated gene in our gene age analysis. These events could
contribute to further diversify the functionality of retrogenes
and have a direct impact on the evolutionary trajectory of the
species, leading, in some instances, to hybrid breakdown [37].

In sum, the results of these analyses do not concur with any of
the predictions made by the 'out of the testes' hypothesis [32].
Many Drosophila retrogenes are expressed primarily in testes
but we did not see a pattern in which younger genes are
expressed in testis and older genes expressed in more tissues
than testis and at a relatively lower level in this tissue.

tated [29]. The average KA and KS (± standard error) of the
chimeric retrogenes were 0.2241 ± 0.0440 and 6.8977 ±
1.6752, respectively. The average KA and KS of retrogenes for
which UTRs have been annotated were 0.2584 ± 0.0210 and
10.2259 ± 1.0045. According to the phylogenetic distribution
(Figure 1), the average age estimated as described above is
59.7727 ± 2.9817 My in chimeric genes and 56.2100 ± 2.4106
My in other retrogenes for which UTRs have been annotated.
From these data we conclude that chimeric retrogenes do not
appear to be older than other retrogenes and, therefore, retrogenes do not need extra time to acquire new introns and
exons from the region of insertion. In fact, these acquisitions
most likely occur rapidly after the duplication event, as has
been observed for other chimeric genes that arose from retroposition [5].

reviews

We directly studied the relationship between expression level
in testis (that is, number of hits in the AT library) and age
given by KA, KS and phylogenetic distribution to address the
'out of the testes' hypothesis. None of these relationships were
significant: Kendall's τKa = 0.0065, P = 0.9482; Kendall's τKs
= -0.0416, P = 0.6763; and Kendall's τ = 0.0398, P = 0.6902.
Finally, we also explored whether the proportion of testis EST
hits decreases with age of the retrogene, as had been observed
in humans [32]. We did not find a significant positive correlation between this proportion and the measures of age: Kendall's τKa = 0.0820, P = 0.3153; Kendall's τKs = 0.1564, P =
0.0555; and Kendall's τ = 0.0272, P = 0.7390.

comment

To compare our results with the human results we studied
whether young retrogenes are expressed at lower levels than
older ones [32]. We did not find a significant positive correlation between the number of hits for expressed sequence tags
(ESTs)/cDNAs in the libraries and KA or KS (Kendall's τKa = 0.2530, P = 0.0020; Kendall's τKs = -0.0546, P = 0.5042; note
that one correlation is significant but negative). We also
tested against our estimate of the age of the retrogene. We
consider that the age of a retrogene is the middle point in the
lineage in which it originated or 62.9 My if it is present in all
the species. There was again no significant correlation
between age of the retrogenes and the expression level (Kendall's τ = 0.1396, P = 0.0874), contrary to the observations in
humans.

subgenus. In the case of CG6036, multiple independent
losses of the same gene will have to occur in the Drosophila
subgenus and the Sophophora subgenus.

Recurrent and convergent recruitment of functional
retrogenes during Drosophila evolution
We define as recurrent recruitment the situation whereby the
same parental gene has given rise repeatedly to several functional retrogenes within the same lineage of Drosophila (that
is, the closely related paralog of two intronless genes was the
same parental gene). Three parental genes (Cnx99A, CkIα
and Vha16) produced two, two and three retrogenes, respectively. For Cnx99A the two duplications are only present in D.
melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia and D. mauritiana.
For CkIα the two duplications predate the Drosophila genus
diversification. Two of the Vha16 duplications predate the
Drosophila genus diversification. The other one is absent in
the Drosophila subgenus. Why the number of functional
genes has grown in these three gene families in the D. melanogaster lineage through retroposition is not understood.
While examination of the number of retroposed nonfunctional copies of genes can provide evidence of what transcripts are more likely to be retroposed (that is, stable mRNAs
or mRNAs encoding soluble proteins, the latter being transcripts that stay longer in the cytoplasm and do not get targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum [38]), only deeper
understanding of the role of the functional copies can reveal
why some are kept functional.
We also explored our dataset for convergent recruitments of
retrogenes in different lineages of Drosophila and found
three instances. Two independent lines of evidence support
these parallel recruitments: different chromosomal location
and higher similarity to the parental gene than to other retrogenes in a KS tree (Additional data file 7). In one case, Dntf-2
seems to have given rise to retrogenes three times independently in different Drosophila lineages (Additional data file 7,
Figure 2). It gave rise to the retrogene in our set that is present
in four species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. mauritiana
and D sechellia) [3] on chromosomal arm 2L. It seems to have
given rise to a retrogene in the D. ananassae lineage and
another independent retrogene originated in the lineage of D.
grimshawi. These two additional retrogenes map in the chromosomal arm homologous to 3L in D. melanogaster. In
another case, ran seems to have given rise to retrogenes at
least twice (but likely three times) in different lineages. It gave
rise to the retrogene in our set that is present in all the species
of the D. melanogaster subgroup (Figure 2, Additional data
file 2) on chromosome 3L and appears to be evolving very fast
even at synonymous sites (Additional data file 7; note the very
long branches). Ran seems to have given rise to another possibly fast evolving retrogene in the D. ananassae lineage
located in the chromosomal arm homologous to 2L of D. melanogaster. We believe these two events could be independent, despite the fact that they group together in the KS tree,
because the grouping can be an artifact of both sets of genes

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/1/R11

evolving very fast even at synonymous sites, possibly due to
their lack of codon bias or a higher mutation rate in their
chromosomal location. Finally, a clear independent retrogene
in the lineage of D. grimshawi seems to have originated from
ran and is located in the chromosomal arm homologous to 3L
of D. melanogaster (Figure 2). Seemingly intact and fulllength open reading frames are evident for all these newly
duplicated retrogenes, making all these likely functional copies (data not shown).
Remarkably, it has been previously established that the proteins encoded by Dntf-2 and ran interact with each other during the transport of proteins to the nucleus. Thus, the
overlapping presence of duplicates of both genes, independently acquired by retroposition, in some lineages may have an
adaptive meaning, in particular if they overlap in their
expression. Interestingly, all three independent retropositon
events involved retroposition from the X chromosome to an
autosome location, which has been claimed to be positively
selected for in the genome [4,13]. Interestingly, Dntf-2r is
highly expressed in the male germline [3]. It is possible that
multiple parallel retroposition events of Dntf-2 and ran took
place and that they fixed in the population under positive
selection due to the fact that they encode proteins that physically interact and function together in the same cellular
processes in the male germline. We are currently investigating if the expression pattern of the ran retrogenes overlaps
that of Dntf-2 retrogenes.
The third example of convergent retrogene recruitment corresponds to the retrogenes that originated from the parental
gene Cervantes (CG15645) that we revealed in a recent study
[39]. We named the retrogene in D. melanogaster Quijote

As described by Betrán et al. [13], we used a KA/KS of 0.5
between a retrogene and a parental gene as the conservative
cut-off value that reveals constraint in the retrogene lineage.
The Codeml program PAML 3.1[46] was run twice for every
gene pair; first to fix KA/KS = 0.5 and second to estimate the
ratio, to test if KA/KS is significantly smaller than 0.5 using a
likelihood ratio test.

refereed research

We downloaded a D. melanogaster EST/cDNA database
(October 2003 release) locally from the Berkeley Drosophila
Genome Project [43]. We queried these data using Blastn [44]
with our retrogene and parental gene dataset. Tissue expression was assessed using a similar approach to the one followed by Emerson et al. [4], except that here we lowered the
nucleotide identity level to 97% because, in Drosophila, we
expect a relatively higher level of intrapopulation polymorphism [45]. The total number of sequences in the EST/cDNA
database for each of the 15 libraries we downloaded are as follows: AT (adult testis), 26,226; GM (ovary), 12,765; UT (adult
testis), 1,368; EC (fat body of larvae), 10,460; EP (mix of
embryo, imaginal disks, and head), 9,423; EN (mbn2 cell
line), 8,068; LP (larvae and pupae), 17,204; HL (head),
3,506; SD (schneider cell culture), 23,150; CK (embryo endoplasmic reticulum), 1,673; GH (head (male + female)),
29,132; EK (mix of embryo, imaginal disks and head), 80,857;
LD (embryo), 43,509; RH (head normalized), 58,393; RE
(embryo normalized), 67,658. The tissue expression for a
gene was obtained by averaging the tissue hits for all transcripts of that gene. This type of expression data allows for the
assertion of expression of duplicate genes without the confusing effects of sequence similarity between duplicates [13].

deposited research

This work provides the most accurate estimate of the rate of
functional retrogene recruitment published to date for any
species lineage (0.51 retrogenes/My). This rate was fairly constant for approximately 63 My of Drosophila evolution and its
value is of the same order of magnitude of the approximate
rate recently published for the human lineage (1 retrogene/
My) [12]. Many of the Drosophila retrogenes are expressed
primarily in the male germline and have often evolved malespecific functions. In addition, a very interesting pattern is
revealed from our searches of convergent recruitments of retrogenes in different lineages. Three prolific parental genes
(Dntf-2, ran and cervantes) seem to have produced retrogenes in parallel in different lineages (Figure 2). All of these
events fit the preferential X chromosome to autosome traffic
of retrogenes [13]. It is likely, therefore, that positive selection
has repeatedly driven the export of functions from the X chromosome to autosomes. We are now studying in more detail
the molecular evolution and pattern of transcription of the
convergently acquired retrogenes to test this hypothesis.

Conclusion

rogenes using similar computational approaches to those
previously described [4,13], with a few modifications. The
FASTA34 package [42] was used to perform similarity
searches with each single peptide in the Ensembl dataset
against all other peptides to identify duplicate genes. We lowered the level of amino acid identity between protein pairs to
50% and the overlap level between two proteins to 70%. The
parental gene was assigned to the highest amino acid identity
hit. To be called a retrogene, we required that the region of
similarity between an intronless gene and a parental gene
spans all the introns of the parental gene coding region. However, we also looked at genes with small numbers of introns
(<4) and additionally identified 11 parental/retrogene pairs
with ≥33% difference in the number of introns; these are the
cases where the retrogene recruited new introns. Partial retrogenes were also noted (six cases); these are intronless genes
that do not span all the introns of the parental gene.

reviews

Again, a possible, but less parsimonious, explanation to the
parallel recruitment of retrogenes in different lineages would
be the existence of several ancient retroduplications and the
loss of all or all except one retrogene in different lineages and
the action of gene conversion between parental genes and retrogenes right after the losses occur.

comment

(CG13732), and discovered that Quijote is present in only four
species of Drosophila (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D.
sechellia and D. mauritiana). In that study, we also inferred
that retroposed copies of Cervantes also originated in the lineages leading to D. yakuba and D. erecta and this occurred
independently in the three instances (Additional data file 7,
Figure 2). This is one example of parallel recruitment of a retrogene from the same parental gene in different Drosophila
lineages. Here again, the convergent retroposition events
involved retroposition from the X chromosome to an autosome, possibly revealing the selective pressure of X inactivation or sexual antagonism, as introduced above. In agreement
with this 'out of the X convergent event' hypothesis, a Utp14
retrogene involved in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome
assembly has likely been recruited independently for malefunction in four distinct mammalian lineages [40,41]. These
were also X to autosomes retroposition events. The authors
argue that the independent recruitment supports the hypothesis that it is highly beneficial for males to gain autosomal
copies of the Utp14 gene to compensate for the silencing of
the X chromosome during male meiosis, as discussed above.

Checking of presence/absence of retrogenes and
parental genes and their structure in other Drosophila
genomes
We estimated the time of the retroposition events by checking
the presence/absence of retrogenes and their parental genes
in the 11 additional Drosophila species that have now been
fully sequenced. We used three approaches to assign orthology between the genes under examination. First, we required
that at least one of the two nearest gene neighbors be present
on either side of the gene under scrutiny (conservation of synteny). This was done by looking at the translated similarity
searches (tBLASTn [44]) against the assemblies of 11 related
Drosophila species (Comparative Analysis Freeze 1 [47]).
Sequence sources: D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. mojavensis, D.
virilis and D. grimshawi were sequenced by Agencourt, Inc
(Beverly, MA, USA); D. simulans and D. yakuba were
sequenced by Washington University; D. sechellia and D.
persimilis were sequenced by the Broad Institute; D. willistoni was sequenced by TIGR; D. melanogaster was
sequenced by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and
Celera [48]; and D. pseudoobscura was sequenced by Baylor
[49]. Because chromosomal rearrangements (that is, paracentric inversions) could potentially result in scrambling of
the genes along a chromosomal arm [50], we reasoned that
the conservation of microsynteny, as given by the two neighboring genes, might not be sufficient to infer orthology. To
increase the accuracy of our orthology assignment, we complemented this approach by a phylogenetic analysis using all
protein hits of the selected gene in the related species with
expected gene structure and looking for clear phylogenetic
support (proteins of retrogenes or parental genes of the different species grouped together with a good bootstrap support and following the known topology) to assign orthology.
This approach allowed us to find relocated genes, that is, retroposed genes homologous by descent but subsequently relocated to another chromosomal position. Convergent
recruitments were suspected whenever the phylogenetic
inference supported several retrogenes having higher similarity to the parental genes of their lineages than to the other retrogenes. Additional support for convergent recruitment was
obtained from the KS tree and chromosomal location of the
retrogenes being different (Additional data file 7). Finally, we
also checked the synteny conservation up to five neighboring
genes on either side for each selected gene identifying their
predicted orthologous genes in the UCSC browser [51] in particularly ambiguous cases.
Examining the presence or absence of a particular gene and
its structure in related species from the tBLASTn and BLAT
hits can help reveal false positives in our retrogene annotation (that is, recent intron gain by a parental gene or intron
loss by a retrogene) or wrong assignment of parental gene
(that is, a parental gene being younger than a retrogene). Our
analyses of the phylogenetic distribution of parental genes
and retrogenes (Additional data file 2, Figure 1) revealed that
the phylogenetic distribution of the parental gene was always

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/1/R11

the same or wider than those of the cognate retrogene. However, we found one case in which the lack of an intron in the
alleged retrogene could be explained by genomic duplication
followed by intron gain in the parental gene rather than by
retroposition, that is, orthologous sequences of the parental
gene are intronless genes, and one case in which it could be
explained by genomic duplication followed by intron loss in
the alleged retrogene, that is, orthologous sequences of the
retrogne are intron-containing genes. We discarded these two
pairs from our final dataset listed in Additional data file 1.
