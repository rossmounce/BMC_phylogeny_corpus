Abstract
Background: Rhipicephalus sanguineus, known as the brown dog tick, is a common ectoparasite of domestic dogs
and can be found worldwide. R.sanguineus is recognized as the primary vector of the etiological agent of canine
monocytic ehrlichiosis and canine babesiosis. Here we present the first description of a R. sanguineus salivary gland
transcriptome by the production and analysis of 2,034 expressed sequence tags (EST) from two cDNA libraries, one
consctructed using mRNA from dissected salivary glands from female ticks fed for 3-5 days (early to mid library,
RsSGL1) and the another from ticks fed for 5 days (mid library, RsSGL2), identifying 1,024 clusters of related
sequences.
Results: Based on sequence similarities to nine different databases, we identified transcripts of genes that were
further categorized according to function. The category of putative housekeeping genes contained ~56% of the
sequences and had on average 2.49 ESTs per cluster, the secreted protein category contained 26.6% of the ESTs
and had 2.47 EST’s/clusters, while 15.3% of the ESTs, mostly singletons, were not classifiable, and were annotated
as “unknown function”. The secreted category included genes that coded for lipocalins, proteases inhibitors,
disintegrins, metalloproteases, immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory proteins, as Evasins and Da-p36, as well as
basic-tail and 18.3 kDa proteins, cement proteins, mucins, defensins and antimicrobial peptides. Comparison of the
abundance of ESTs from similar contigs of the two salivary gland cDNA libraries allowed the identification of
differentially expressed genes, such as genes coding for Evasins and a thrombin inhibitor, which were over
expressed in the RsSGL1 (early to mid library) versus RsSGL2 (mid library), indicating their role in inhibition of
inflammation at the tick feeding site from the very beginning of the blood meal. Conversely, sequences related to
cement (64P), which function has been correlated with tick attachment, was largely expressed in the mid library.
Conclusions: Our survey provided an insight into the R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome, which can assist the
discovery of new targets for anti-tick vaccines, as well as help to identify pharmacologically active proteins.

Background
The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is a cosmopolitan species from the Ixodidae family [1] found on
all continents [2]. Although dogs are the most common
host for this tick, it has also been found on other animals, such as cats, rabbits, camels, bovines, goats,
horses, sheep, bats, reptiles, and ground feeding birds
[1], as well as from humans [3]. It transmits two of the

most important arthropod borne pathogens of dogs,
namely, Ehrlichia canis and Babesia canis [4,5].
The saliva of R. sanguineus mediates parasitism
through components that modulate the innate and
acquired immune response of the host [6,7]. Accordingly, these compounds are of major importance for tick
survival, helping it feed and evade host defenses, including hemostatic factors and the inflammatory responses
[8]. In order to identify protein families relevant for the
tick-host interface, salivary transcriptomes (sialotranscriptomes) and microarray analysis of several Ixodid
tick species have been done [9-18]. In addition, this
strategy can help the identification of proteins from tick

saliva that can induce anti-tick resistance and impair or
block transmission of tick-borne pathogens [19-22].
Female adult ticks go through a notable succession of
changes during feeding and mating. Their body sizes
and weights increase gradually as the blood-feeding progresses. During the feeding period their salivary glands
undergo a set of qualitative and quantitative alterations
in the content of mRNA and protein [17,18]. For R. sanguineus female ticks, at days 1-3 (i.e., the early phase of
feeding) the change of weight and size is very small,
while by the 5th day these parameters are 2 to 3 times
greater. After this stage the rapid phase of engorgement
(also called late phase) is initiated; the salivary glands
start to degenerate and the ticks can reach 50 to100
times the size they were when unfed. The time taken by
females of R. sanguineus to complete their engorgement
is 7-10 days [3].
In the present work, we analyzed the sialotranscriptome of two R. sanguineus cDNA libraries, that included
transcripts from salivary glands from female ticks fed
for 3-5 or 5 days on dogs. A total of 2,034 high quality
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were analyzed producing 1,024 contigs, of which 910 were derived from only
one EST. For functional annotation of the unique transcripts we used the BLASTx, comparing them against
nine different databases. The comparison of the abundance of ESTs from each contig of the two libraries
allowed identification of some genes that were significantly differentially represented. To our knowledge, this
work is the first transcriptome analysis of salivary glands
of R. sanguineus tick species. Moreover, the characterization of components from tick saliva is likely to be of
value in future when designing novel methods for the
control of ticks and tick-borne diseases, as well as
searching for proteins that may have potential use in
medical and veterinary pathologies”.

Methods
Ticks and salivary gland collection

Ticks were obtained from two laboratory colonies, one
from the Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine, University
of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, SP (FMRP-USP), and the
other from the School of Agronomical and Veterinary
Sciences, São Paulo State University, Jaboticabal, SP
(FCAV-UNESP), both were maintained at 29°C in a biochemical oxygen-demand incubator with 85% relative
humidity. Adult ticks (25 females and 25 males) were
allowed to feed in plastic feeding chambers glued (Britania Adhesives P4104 Latex, Brentwood, UK) to the back
of 1-3 years old female mongrel dogs for either libraries.
These dogs were not naïve to ticks, however had no
ticks when were tick-infested. Tick infestations were
performed at both locations (FCAV-UNESP and FMRPUSP) using four dogs (2 per group). After five days,

25 female ticks were collected and used to construct the
RsSGL2 library (FCAV-UNESP), while 10 female ticks
fed for 3, 4 and 5 days (summing 30 ticks) were pooled
and used to make up the RsSGL1 library (FMRP-USP).
Salivary glands (25-30 pairs) were dissected from female
ticks and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), pH 7.4 and then incubated in RNAlater solution
(Ambion, Austin, USA) for 24 h at 4°C and then stored
at -80°C until used.
cDNA library construction and sequencing

Total mRNA was isolated from R. sanguineus salivary
glands using the micro Fast Track™ 2.0 RNA extraction
kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A long distance PCR based cDNA
library was constructed in a l TripleEx2 vector following the procedures from the SMART™ cDNA Library
Construction Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA). This system utilizes oligoribonucleotide (SMART IV) to attach
an identical sequence at the 5′ end of each reverse-transcribed cDNA strand. The sequence was then employed
in subsequent PCR reactions and then digested with
restriction enzymes. First-strand synthesis was carried
out using PowerScript reverse transcriptase at 42°C for
1 h in the presence of the SMART IV and CDS III (3′)
primers. Second-strand synthesis was performed by a
long-distance (LD) PCR-based protocol using Advantage™ Taq Polymerase (Clontech) mix in the presence of
the 5′ PCR primer and the CDS III (3′) primer. The
cDNA synthesis procedure resulted in the creation of
SfiI A and B restriction enzyme sites at the ends of the
PCR products that are used for cloning into the phage
vector.
A small portion of the cDNA obtained by PCR was
analyzed on a 1.1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide
(1.5 μg/mL). The optimal number of cycles with visible
and equally represented products was used. Doublestranded cDNA was immediately treated with proteinase
K at 45°C for 20 min, and the enzyme was removed by
ultrafiltration though a Microcon (Amicon Inc., Beverly,
USA) YM-100 centrifugal filter device. The cleaned,
double-stranded cDNA was then digested with SfiI at
50°C for 2 h, followed by size fractionation on a ChromaSpin-1000 column (Clontech).
The cDNA mixture was ligated into the l TriplEx2
vector (Clontech) and the resulting ligation mixture was
packaged using the GigaPack® III Plus packaging extract
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The packaged library was plated by
infecting log-phase XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells
(Clontech). The percentage of recombinant clones was
determined by performing a blue-white selection screening on LB/MgSO4 plates containing X-gal/IPTG.
Recombinants were also determined by PCR, using

Anatriello et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:450
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/450

vector primers from the SMART™ cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech) and visualizing the products on
a 1.1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Random
clones were sequenced from the 5′ direction only,
because successful sequencing from the 3′ end was
usually lower than 40%. Full length sequences were
obtained in selected cases by performing primer-based
extension protocols. For details see Francischetti et al.
and Valenzuela et al. [23,24].
Bioinformatic tools and statistical tests used

ESTs were trimmed of primer and vector sequences.
The BLASTn [25], CAP3 assembler [26] and ClustalW
software [27] were used to compare, assemble, and align
high quality ESTs, respectively. For functional annotation of the transcripts we used BLASTx [25] to compare
the nucleotide sequences with the non-redundant (NR)
protein database of the National Center of Biological
Information (NCBI) and to the Gene Ontology (GO)
database [28]. The program reverse position-specific
BLAST (RPS-BLAST) [25] was used to search for conserved protein domains in the Pfam [29], SMART [30],
Kog [31], and conserved domains databases (CDD) [32].
We have also compared the transcripts with a subset of
mitochondrial/plastid and rRNA nucleotide sequences
downloaded from NCBI and to several organism proteomes downloaded from NCBI, ENSEMBL, or VectorBase. For all comparisons please consult Additional file
1. Segments of the three-frame translations of the EST
(as the libraries were unidirectional, six-frame translations were not used) starting with a methionine found
in the first 30 predicted amino acids, or the predicted
protein translation in the case of complete coding
sequences, were submitted to the SignalP server [33] to
help identify translation products that could be secreted.
O-glycosylation sites on the proteins were predicted
with the program NetOGlyc [34].
All sequences reported in this paper are available publicly under the accession numbers GT030184-GT032391
and EZ406035-EZ406256 (EST’s from adult female salivary gland cDNA library) at GenBank and are accessible
in Additional file 1.
For sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis,
we retrieved tick sequences from GenBank, as well as
deduced protein sequences from ESTs deposited in
dbEST, as described and made accessible in a previous
review article [8]. Phylogenetic analysis and statistical
neighbour-joining (NJ) bootstrap tests of the phylogenies
were done using the Mega package [35] after sequence
alignment was performed using ClustalX [36].
The individual cDNA libraries were directly compared
with each other using a customized program (Count
Libraries) that assesses the individual contribution of
each library to the combined contig. This analysis is

interesting to suggest putative proteins that may be
over- or under-represented at a given time point. A
Chi-square analysis was used to evaluate the significance
level at p < 0.05 between the number of transcripts in
the same contig originating from the two libraries used.

Results and Discussion
Overview of the assembled salivary EST set

A total of 2,034 ESTs were used to produce a R. sanguineus salivary gland specific transcriptome database
(Additional file 1), 875 ESTs from 5 days fed ticks
(RsSGL2) and 1,159 from 3 to 5 days fed ticks
(RsSGL1), which were assembled yielding 1,024 unique
transcripts ("clusters” of related sequences), 910 of
which were derived from only one EST (singleton). This
large number of singletons contrasts with previous sialotranscriptomes of hematophagous insects and Ixodid
ticks, giving an appearance of a “normalized” library.
Manual annotation of the transcripts resulted in seven
broad categories of expressed genes (Table 1). The putative housekeeping genes category contained 56% of the
clusters, which had, on average, 2.49 sequences per cluster, the secreted category contained 26.6% of the clusters
which contained 2.47 ESTs/clusters, while 15.3% of the
transcripts, mostly singletons, were not classifiable, constituting the unknown category. The transcripts assigned
to the unknown category could represent novel proteins
or derive from the less conserved 3′ or 5′ untranslated
regions of genes, as was suggested from the sialotranscriptome of Anopheles gambiae [37]. Sequences deriving from Babesia, Anaplasma, Densovirus and
transposable elements (TE) accounted for the remaining
sequences, mostly singletons. Babesia and densoviralrelated proteins were also described in a previous sialotranscriptome of Ixodes scapularis [13]. Ribosomal proteins, possibly derived from Babesia canis, were found
in the RsGLS1 library, and may be useful for diagnostic
purposes (Additional file 1). TE related sequences may
either indicate the presence of active transposition in
the tick, or more likely, the expression of sequences that
are able to suppress transposition [38]. Low level

Ninety-eight transcripts (mostly full-length) comprised
of 1,138 ESTs were annotated as housekeeping genes
and were further categorized into 20 subgroups according to function (Table 2 and Additional file 1). Transcripts associated with protein synthesis machinery
represented 47% of all transcripts associated with housekeeping function, an expected result due to the secretory nature of the organ. Energy metabolism accounted
for 23% of the transcripts. Eight percent of the transcripts were classified as either ‘Hypothetical conserved’
or ‘Conserved secreted’ proteins. These represent highly
conserved proteins of unknown function, presumably
associated with cellular function yet uncharacterized.
This functional distribution is typical and was previously
described in other sialotranscriptomes [15,16,39].

A total of 541 ESTs, assembled into 219 contigs, were

components (Table 3 and Additional file 1). These
include previously known gene families, such as metalloproteases, lipocalins, protease inhibitor domain-containing peptides, immuno-modulators, antimicrobial
peptides, basic-tail, and glycine rich peptides. Several
other deduced sequences code for putatively secreted
proteins but have poor or non-significant sequence

Detailed analysis of the sialome of R. sanguineus

From the sequenced clones, 114 of which code for putative secreted products were meticulously analyzed
(Additional file 2). The following presentation is a guide
for browsing Additional file 2.
Putative secreted proteins with presumed or experimentally
validated function

Lipocalins The lipocalin family of proteins is ubiquitous
in animals [40]. Its barrel structure makes it suitable to
carry small substances within the cavity and the barrel
sides can acquire diverse functions [41]. As an example
of convergent evolution, this family has been recruited
to serve diverse functions in saliva of ticks and triatomine bugs, where they serve as scavengers of agonists of
inflammation and hemostasis, such as ADP [42], biogenic amines [43-45], leukotrienes and thromboxane A2
(TXA 2 ) [44,46], to carry heme and nitric oxide (NO)
[47], anticomplement [48], or anticlotting agents [49].
Typically, dozens of such gene products are found
within sialotranscriptomes of ticks and triatomine bugs
[8,13,15,16,39,50-52]. Additional file 2 displays 27 lipocalin sequences deduced from the R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome, 11 of which are full length. An additional
R. sanguineus protein sequence similar to tick salivary
proteins of ~180 amino acids is annotated as a possible
lipocalin. A circular phylogram of the R. sanguineus
lipocalin sequences containing more than 100 amino
acid obtained in this study (26 sequences) as well as
homologous sequences obtained from a recently
published tick salivary gland database [8] is shown in

Anatriello et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:450
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/450

Figure 1. This phylogram depicts that most of the R.
sanguineus sequences are dispersed into different clades,
which contain sequences from other tick species, suggesting an ancient origin for these genes. Despite this
clade dispersion, the phylogram also highlights species
specific expansions, as indicated in the clades marked I
(Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus expansion, including one R. sanguineus sequence and one A. cajennense),
III (R. appendiculatus expansion including one R. sanguineus and one R. microplus sequence), IV (I. scapularis expansion), V (R. sanguineus expansion including
one R. appendiculatus and one R. haemaphysaloides
sequence), VI and VII (both with Amblyomma americanum expansions). Other similar expansions can be
found by close inspection of Figure 1. These are probably the result of recent gene duplication events [53].
Very few proteins displayed in Figure 1 have been functionally characterized. One of them (RHIAP 8470378)
was included in a group of R. appendiculatus proteins
from clade III, that has been shown to be a scavenger of
histamine [54,55]. Interestingly, a R. sanguineus
sequence named RS-47 is also present in clade III,
which suggests it may be a close relative. Rooting with
clade III, but lacking significant bootstrap support, the
sequence DERRE 18032205, from Dermacentor reticulatus, was shown to be a dual binder of histamine and serotonin [43]. An additional possible function for the noncharacterized lipocalins found in Figure 1, similar to soft
ticks and triatomine, may be to bind adenosine nucleotides, TXA2, or leukotrienes.
Protease inhibitors The analysis of the R. sanguineus
sialotranscriptome revealed several protein sequences
containing domains associated with protease inhibitors,
such as Kunitz [56], thyropin [57,58] and cystatins [59],
as well as unique tick protease inhibitor domains, such
as a tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor [60], and a tick antithrombin of the madanin/hirudin like family [61].
Kunitz-domain containing proteins, like the lipocalins, are abundantly found in tick sialotranscriptomes.
Eleven deduced protein sequences are shown in Additional file 2 which contain one or two Kunitz
domains. The circular phylogram of these sequences
resulting from the alignment with other related tick
sequences (Figure 2) shows that, similarly to the lipocalin family, R. sanguineus has several genes coding
for the Kunitz family that congregates, with strong
bootstrap support, within multi-specific clades (numbered III, IV, V, VII, VIII and IX in Figure 2). Specific
gene expansions are also evident (II for I. scapularis,
VI and VIII for A. americanum; and VII for R. sanguineus). Clade I, that lacks any R. sanguineus
sequence, contains the protein from A. haebraeum
coded by a gene (gi|40890046) that has been previously characterized as a thrombin inhibitor [62]

Page 5 of 17

(Clade IV, containing the R. sanguineus protein
named RS-290, also includes a R. appendiculatus
sequence (gi|57014514) which has been characterized
as a tryptase inhibitor [63]. No other protein shown
in Figure 2 has been functionally characterized,
although additional Kunitz-domain containing proteins from ticks have been identified as inhibitors of
blood clotting [64-69] and platelet aggregation, thus
possibly can have a role in the tick feeding process.
Cystatins are cysteine proteinase inhibitors [59] and
have been described in the sialotranscriptome of I. scapularis, two members of which have been characterized
as inhibitors of cathepsins L and S, which play roles in
inflammation and immunity [70-72]. These proteins also
have been regularly found in sialotranscriptomes of
other hard and soft tick species [8]. The R. sanguineus
sialotranscriptome contained 3 members of this protein
family (Additional file 1). Their role as a cysteine proteinase inhibitor remains to be determined.
Thyropin is a domain found as a repeat in the amino
terminal region of human thyroglobulin that is proposed
to be an inhibitor of cysteine proteases and binding
partners of heparin [73,74]. Proteins containing these
domains have been reported from other tick sialotranscriptomes [8]. RS-899 is a R. sanguineus protein containing 2 thyropin domains, as indicated by its
comparison to the Pfam database. No tick thyropins
have been functionally characterized to date.
A carboxypeptidase inhibitor, a protein that is rich in
cysteins, has been previously reported in R. bursa, and
postulated to affect fibrinolysis [60,75]. Analysis of our
data showed a protein RS-334 that presented match
with a carboxypeptidase inhibitor (Additional file 1).
Thrombin inhibitors named madanins were isolated
from the tick Haemaphysalis longicornis [61]. A related
protein named chimadanin is also a thrombin inhibitor
[76]. They have no similarities to other proteins found
in the NR database. The R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome revealed 4 proteins of this family, one of which
has a weak similarity to chimadanin, the others being
similar to uncharacterized Amblyomma variegatum proteins annotated as hirudin-like [77], purported to be a
thrombin inhibitor, shown by the ability to inhibit
human platelet aggregation stimulated by thrombin.
Members of this family were also found in deduced proteins of previously published sialotranscriptomes from
metastriate, but not prostriate, ticks [8].
The Kazal motif characterizes many serine protease
inhibitors that affects several target proteins, such as
thrombin and trypsin [78]. Three related putative peptide sequences from the R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome (RS-132, RS-359 and RS-827) matched proteins
annotated as Kazal-domain, despite the fact that the
R. sanguineus proteins themselves lack Kazal domain

signature, as searched by rpsBLAST against the conserved domains database.
The basic tail and 18.3 kDa superfamily The basic tail
family (BT) was so named due to a stretch of lysine residues in the carboxytermini of several related salivary

proteins of I. scapularis [79]. The cluster of basic amino
acids may drive these proteins to negatively charged
lipids involved in clotting activation [80,81]. The 18.3
kDa family was found later to be related to the BT
family by PsiBLAST [13]. Although more expanded in

Figure 2 Relationship of Rhipicephalus sanguineus Kunitz domain proteins to other related tick proteins. The circular phylogram is based
on the alignment of sequences derived from this study and homologous sequences obtained from the NR database from NCBI, and from tick
sequences derived from dbEST. The red branches have bootstrap support above 75% (10,000 replicates). The bar at the centre indicates 20%
amino acid divergence. The R. sanguineus sequences are indicated by a circle, and start with RS-. The sequences obtained from the NR database
are indicated by 5 letters (3 from the genus and 2 from the species name) followed by the NCBI accession number. Remaining sequences were
deduced from dbEST and are available from Francischetti et al. [8].

Ixodes, the family is also found in metastriate and argasid ticks [8]. Some proteins of this family in the I. scapularis species were characterized as anti-clotting [65].
Four proteins deducted from the R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome are divergent but clearly related. They
produce matches to basic tail and 18.3 kDa members.
Alignment of these proteins and their matches (Figure
3A) reveals that one group of proteins has the typical
basic tail signature, including RS-329, while a second

group of longer sequences belongs to the 18.3 kDa
family, and includes the three remaining R. sanguineus
sequences. This alignment shows only conservation of
one Gly and four Cys residues. The phylogram (Figure
3B) can be divided into three groups and six branches.
Group I contains the typical Ixodes BT expanded family,
with two distinct branches (a and b in Figure 3B).
Group II includes metastriate ticks, all containing a BT
signature, with two robust clades, represented by

branches c and d (Figure 3B). Group III sequences contain typical 18.3 kDa proteins, in two clades represented
by branches e and f, e having only Ixodes and f including only metastriate sequences. The phylogram clearly
demonstrates the evolutionary pathways of this divergent protein family among metastriate and prostriate
ticks.
Disintegrins The disintegrins contain an Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) or Arg-Thr-Ser (RTS) triad flanked by cysteines.
These peptides, originally discovered in snake venom,
bind to platelet integrins that normally attach to fibrinogen and promote platelet aggregation [82,83]. The
R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome reveals two members
(RS-325 and RS-609) related to this family. RS-325
codes for a 4.7 kDa peptide that has a typical RGD
domain, but no similarity to any other known protein.
Acquisition of the RGD motif by proteins of other
families has been described in antigen-5 salivary proteins from tabanids [84], and in Kunitz peptides of ticks
[67]. In addition to its affect on host platelet aggregation, disintegrins may also act on several other inflammatory/immune cell features [85,86], which could
decrease host cell migration to the tick-feeding lesion.
The transcriptome presented herein also displayed a
lipocalin (RS-926) that contains a typical RTS domain of
the disintegrin family [87], which was not found in any
other member of the lipocalin family, suggesting a possible additional function. Similarly, the Kunitz containing
proteins RS-316 and RS-589 also each have a RTS and a
KTS motif surrounded by cysteines.
Cys-rich peptides associated with metalloproteases
Metalloproteases often have extra domains that may
interact with matrix proteins [88]. Tick sialotranscriptomes revealed Cys rich proteins that are similar to
these extra domains of metalloproteases, including the
expanded ixostatin family in I. scapularis and I. pacificus
[11,13]. RS-707 codes for a 14.8 kDa mature protein of
that is similar to other Cys rich metastriate proteins.
Their function has not been characterized.
Immunomodullatory and antiinflammatory proteins
Tick saliva has been known to have immunomodulatory
activity for decades now [89-91]. More recently, unique
proteins have been characterized that act directly on
immune cells, or in complexing and annihilating the
effect of cytokines [92,93].
Dendritic cells pre-exposed to R. sanguineus tick saliva
showed reduced migration towards chemokines CCL3
and CCL4 [94]. These results lead to the discovery of
the family of Evasin proteins, which are chemokine
binding molecules isolated from R. sanguineus tick saliva
[90] that inhibit inflammation and dendritic cell migration [95,96]. Evasin-1 (gi|215275254) binds to chemokines CCL3, CCL4 and CCL18 and corresponds to the
contig RS-77 (Additional file 2). Evasin-3 (gi|215275255)

Page 9 of 17

binds to chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8, corresponding
to RS-60. Evasin-4 (gi|215275256) binds to chemokines
CCL5 and CCL11 and corresponds to RS-909. The
R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome revealed five additional
Evasin sequences (RS-95, RS-119, RS-216, RS-391 and
RS-505). These Evasins group into two families, family
1: contains Evasins-1 and -4 and present the conserved
block C-x(14,16)-C-x(3)-C-x(9,18)-C-x(15,18)-Y-x-C-x
(2)-G-x-C-x-N-x(2,3)-C-x(8)-C, while family 2: contains
Evasin-3 and the conserved motif C-x(3)-C-x(2,5)-G-x
(3,4)-C-P-x(1,2)-G-x(0,1)-C-x-C.
The transcriptome presented herein contained a 3′
truncated protein coded by RS-255 that matched tick
proteins deposited in the NR database annotated as
“similar to Da-p36”. Da-p36 was isolated from Dermacentor andersoni and the recombinant protein inhibited
lymphocyte proliferation [97]. Another immuno-suppressive protein, isolated from H. longicornis, HL-p36,
also showed an anti-proliferative cell effect that was
related to down-regulation of mRNA levels for IL-2
[98]. The phylogram of the R. sanguineus sequence
resulting from the alignment with other immunosuppressive tick sequences shows that RS-255 is more closely related to the HL-p36 than to sequences of other
ixodid ticks (Figure 4).
Defensins Defensins are ubiquitous peptides with antimicrobial properties [99,100]. For ticks, the presence of
defensins suggest roles in protection from pathogens.
The sialotranscriptome of R. sanguineus revealed four
divergent members of this family, one of which, as indicated above, contains an RGD motif (Figure 5). RS-82 is
similar to other tick defensins, while the remaining are
much more divergent; RS-531, for example, was found
to be most similar to a wheat defensin.
GY (Gly-Tyr) rich peptides Salivary transcriptomes of
haematophagous arthropods, including ticks have
revealed the presence of 10 kDa secreted peptides containing multiple GY repeats [51]. Similar peptides in
Caenorhabditis elegans were shown to have antimicrobial activity [101]. The R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome
contained three transcripts coding for peptides containing GY repeats, two of which have less than 60 amino
acids and are distantly related (RS-11 and RS-76). They
present similarities to tick and worm peptides deposited
in the NR database, as well as to several peptides
deduced from ESTs present in other tick transcriptomes
deposited in dbEST. RS-79 codes for a larger peptide
homologous to other GY rich proteins of arthropods,
including some annotated as egg-shell proteins. The
abundance of Tyr residues may provide for cross linking
of these peptides upon phenol oxidase activity. In
arthropods, these enzymes participate in sclerotizing the
proteins in the flexible exoskeleton after a molt
[102,103].

RS-. The remaining sequences were derived from the NR database and are indicated by 5 letter followed by the NCBI accession number. The
protein sequences were aligned using the Clustal program and the dendrogram was created using the Mega package after 10,000 bootstrap
replicates using the neighbour joining (NJ) algorithm. The bar at the bottom represents 20% of amino acid substitution. Remaining sequences
were deduced from dbEST and are available from Francischetti et al. [8].

Glycine-rich/Cement proteins Ticks attach to their
hosts with the help of specialized mouthparts and
remain attached by the secretion of cement proteins
that glues the mouthparts into the host’s skin [104].
Some of these proteins have been characterized and
tested as anti-tick vaccines [105-108]. Tick salivary Gly
rich proteins are derived from several gene families,

some of which are similar to spider fibroin [8]. The
R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome contained seven full
length proteins of this generic family, plus eight fragments (Additional file 1).
Mucin/Perithrophin Mucins are proteins containing
galactosylation of Ser or Thr residues, and are normally
found associated with mucosal membranes where they

flanked by cysteines is found on RS-609.

Anatriello et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:450

may play a role in the immune response [109,110]. Sialotranscriptomes of ticks and other blood feeding
arthropods regularly display such proteins, often with a
chitin binding domain that might coat the food canals
with a mucous lubricant, in addition to functioning in
extracellular matrix adhesion [13,49]. RS-676, similar to
arthropod proteins annotated as mucins and peritrophins, contains five putative glycosylation sites near the
carboxy terminus and a chitin binding domain (Additional file 2). RS-843 and RS-588 are related proteins
with 11 putative glycosylation sites each. These proteins
only provide poor matches to other proteins when queried using the program BLASTp against the NR database.
Putative secreted proteins with uncharacterized function

8.9 kDa family Sixty members of this protein family
have been identified from prostriate and metastriate
ticks as described in a recent review [8]. The R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome reveals four additional
members of this family, identified by sequence comparison to the NR database. Two of these members,
RS-17 and RS-864 are closely related to each other.
Alignment of selected members of this family shows a
conserved group of six cysteine residues, including a
doublet at the carboxytermini (Figure 6). Some members of the family have an additional two cysteines.
PsiBLAST of members of the 8.9 kDa family against
the NR database plus the deduced proteins described
in [8] identified Drosophila proteins of similar sizes
which have a similar Cys framework, including a doublet at the carboxyterminus. The BLAST link of a

Page 11 of 17

D. melanogaster protein (gi|162951779) is interesting,
as it shows various Drosophila proteins, as well as a
Culex quinquefasciatus protein that are very similar to
a previously described sialoprotein from Aedes albopictus, and also a secreted salivary protein from I. Scapularis, which is a member of the 8.9 kDa family. The
function of this protein family in Drosophila is still
unknown, as reported by FlyBase [111].
5.3 kDa family This family of peptides was initially
found in I. scapularis, where some members were up
regulated in ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, suggesting a role in immune responses to bacteria [13].
Two sequences (RS-968 and RS-402) of the R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome matched with this family.
Metastriate one-of-each family While many tick salivary proteins belong to multi gene families, a previous
family, specific to metastriates, was described which
appears to have only one member per metastriate species. The R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome seems to
break this rule by providing evidence for three proteins
of this family (RS-757, RS-671 and 935). Alignment of
these three proteins with other similar metastriate proteins reveals absolute conservation of two cysteines, one
tryptophan, one proline, three glycines and one valine
residues, plus several other conserved substitutions (Figure 7). PsiBLAST of the R. sanguineus sequences against
the NR database with the addition of the deduced tick
proteins described before [8] retrieves only hard tick
protein, suggesting that this protein family definitely
belongs to Ixodidae.

sequences obtained from the NR database are indicated by 5 letters (3 from the genus and 2 from the species name) followed by the NCBI
accession number. Remaining sequences were deduced from dbEST and are available from Francischetti et al. [8].

conserved cysteines are shown in black background; other conserved amino acids are shown in blue background. Sequences from R. s
sanguineus start with RS-. Other sequences were obtained from Francischetti et al. [8].

Metastriate acid tail family RS-907 and RS-881 are
similar to R. microplus and Amblyomma proteins that
have an acidic tail. PsiBLAST of these proteins against
the NR plus tick protein data sets recovers only tick
proteins thus this appears to be a tick specific protein
with unknown function.
Other putative secreted proteins Additional file 2
describes 11 proteins annotated as putative secreted.
Some of them match previously described tick proteins
that have not been characterized as a protein family due
to lack of members in different species. It is possible
that they may be recognizable as members of protein
families as more transcriptomes/genomes are annotated,
or they may represent R. sanguineus proteins resulting
from genes under accelerated divergent evolution. It
should also be noted that some of these proteins may
represent annotation artifacts of 3′ UTR’s, or may represent the truncated carboxyterminus of known proteins,
because their membrane domains will often appear as a
signal peptide. Additionally, four proteins with putative
signal peptide were highly conserved, and accordingly,
may represent housekeeping proteins with hormonal or
extracellular matrix functions.
Differential expression among the two libraries

The EST abundance and assembly derived from two
libraries, one made of mRNA from ticks feeding for 3-5
days (early to mid library, RsSGL1) and the other from
ticks feeding for 5 days (mid library, RsSGL2) is
depicted in Additional file 1. Comparison of the abundance of ESTs contributing to each contig in Count

Libraries by chi square analysis allowed for the identification of some genes that are significantly differentially
represented among the two libraries.
Among the putative lipocalins, three presented an
alternating pattern of expression (Table 4): RS-4 and
RS-6, both corresponding to gi82791912, were over
expressed in the mid library (with 17 and 12 ESTs in
the mid library and only 8 and 1 ESTs in the early to
mid library); other putative lipocalins RS-32, corresponding to gi68131541, was over expressed in the early
to mid library (no ESTs versus 9). This suggests that the
tick possibly relies on an escape mechanism for ligands
of its lipocalins throughout the female’s blood meal by
means of antigenically distinct, but functionally similar
proteins. A putative thrombin inhibitor RS-20, was over
expressed in the early to mid library (with 16 ESTs
derived from the early to mid library and only one from
the mid library). This pattern is compatible with a need
to suppress coagulation during the initial stages of the
blood meal. Unexpectedly, a glycine rich protein RS-23
(64P), similar to cement, was over expressed in the mid
library (13 versus 1 EST). This time of expression for a
cement protein is peculiar for our libraries, since other
work shows down regulation already within four days of
tick feeding [112]. A possible explanation can be that
this protein has an additional function in this phase, yet
this requires more investigation. Regarding the Evasins,
differences in expression did not reach significance for
any member of this class of immunomodulators. However, as a class, they were expressed more abundantly in
the early to mid library (20 versus 5 ESTs). This finding

underscores the tick’s need to avoid the cellular inflammatory responses triggered by its insults to the skin at
the very beginning of the blood meal. This finding is
also compatible with the function of Evasins as chemokine-binding proteins. Two genes (RS-17 and RS-40)
encoding proteins of unknown function were more
abundantly expressed in the early to mid library. There
were also mitochondrial products possibly coding for
rRNA that were differentially expressed: RS-18 was over
expressed early to mid (22 versus 1 EST), while RS-2
was over expressed later (23 versus 0 EST) (Additional
file 1). This temporal difference in gene expression was
previously described in I. scapularis [13].

Conclusions
Analysis of the sialotranscriptome of two R. sanguineus
cDNA libraries, from RsSGL1 and RsSGL2, identified
many transcripts coding for different components that
can favor the tick in detriment of the host. Some were
common to both libraries, such as protein sequences
associated with proteases inhibitors, disintegrins with
RGD, RST and KTS motifs, immunomodullatory and
antiinflammatory proteins, such as Evasins and Dap36, as well as basic tail and 18.3 kDa proteins,
mucins, defensins and antimicrobial peptides. An additional phylogenetic analysis indicated conservation
between protein families, a phenomenon also found in
other tick species, in particular expansion of the

lipocalin and Kunitz superfamilies. The phylograms
also indicated species specific expansions that probably
result from recent gene duplication events, suggested
as of important evolutionary adaptive value [13,113].
Moreover, the phylogenetic trees depict that most of
the R. sanguineus sequences are dispersed into different clades, which contain sequences from other tick
species, suggesting an ancient origin for these genes.
One of the phylogram also clearly demonstrates the
evolutionary pathways of 18.3 kDa protein family are
divergent among metastriate and prostriate ticks.
Furthermore, we found that the transcript RS-255
codes for a sequence closely related to a recently identified transcript found in H. longicornis that codes for
a protein that is similar to the immunosuppressant
protein Da-p36.
Of interest, we observed that many genes were significantly differentially represented among the early to mid
library (RsSGL1) and mid library (RsSGL2). Two transcripts related with lipocalin were over expressed,
whereas one was down expressed in the mid library.
Thrombin inhibitor and Evasins were over expressed in
the early to mid library, while unexpectedly sequences
related to cement (64P) were mostly expressed in the
mid library. These differences possibly represent adaptations of the tick to the dynamics of the host’s antihomeostatic responses to tick feeding. However, mentioned differences require more detailed examination.

Taken together, these results improve our knowledge
of the salivary components of the R. sanguineus that can
lead to a better understanding of parasite-host interactions, and may originate innovative strategies to find
candidate antigens for vaccines, as well as help to discover drugs that could give support to treat coagulopathies and, inflammatory and immunological disorders.
