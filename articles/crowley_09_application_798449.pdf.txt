Abstract
Background: With the threat of emerging infectious diseases such as avian influenza, whose
natural hosts are thought to be a variety of wild water birds including duck, we are armed with very
few genomic resources to investigate large scale immunological gene expression studies in avian
species. Multiple options exist for conducting large gene expression studies in chickens and in this
study we explore the feasibility of using one of these tools to investigate gene expression in other
avian species.
Results: In this study we utilised a whole genome long oligonucleotide chicken microarray to
assess the utility of cross species hybridisation (CSH). We successfully hybridised a number of
different avian species to this array, obtaining reliable signals. We were able to distinguish ducks
that were infected with avian influenza from uninfected ducks using this microarray platform. In
addition, we were able to detect known chicken immunological genes in all of the hybridised avian
species.
Conclusion: Cross species hybridisation using long oligonucleotide microarrays is a powerful tool
to study the immune response in avian species with little available genomic information. The
present study validated the use of the whole genome long oligonucleotide chicken microarray to
investigate gene expression in a range of avian species.

Background
Gene expression profiling utilising microarrays has
become a widely used approach to elucidate biological
function in host pathogen interactions. A variety of differ-

ent platforms and approaches have been developed that
have allowed analysis of gene expression in responses to
viral infections [1-6] Prior to the sequencing of the
chicken genome these microarrays consisted of cDNAs

from many different sources. Sequencing of the chicken
genome has increased the range of tools available to
investigate gene expression including both short and long
oligonucleotide arrays. These gene expression tools have
far reaching benefits for the entire poultry industry,
including the identification of genes that may play integral roles in determining disease resistance, productivity
and quality.

avian species by investigating spleen tissue expression patterns in a range of bird species and a comparison of spleen
tissue from un-infected and H5N1 infected ducks. By
understanding the strengths and limitations of cross species microarrays we will be able to elucidate the power of
the arrays to address important biological issues in diverse
bird species.

Methods
However, identification of such important genes in other
avian species is currently inhibited by a paucity of
genomic resources. Cross-species gene-expression comparison is a powerful tool that may alleviate the lack of
genomic information for a range of different avian species. By utilising existing microarrays it is possible to study
gene expression in closely related species; this technique is
termed cross species hybridisation (CSH). CSH has been
previously used to investigate gene expression across a
number of different species including humans and cattle
[7], humans and primates [8], sheep and cattle [9] and a
number of plant species [10]. CSH highlights the wider
unconventional use of microarrays, proving that this technique can be flexible; however one must keep in mind the
limits of this application, with regard to species specific
genes.
In addition to studying gene expression profiles in closely
related species, CSH can be used to explore comparative
genomics. Comparative genomics provides an opportunity to ascertain relationships between gene function and
location in a range of organisms [11]. Moreover, CSH
allows insight into conservation of functional elements
and the tracing of evolutionary phylogenies by way of
comparing both closely and distantly related species.
Comparative genomic studies in birds may help to
develop detailed genomic information in a wide range of
bird species. The significance of such genomic information is highlighted by the potential it offers in the study of
important issues such as the recent outbreaks of avian
influenza. Research on such diseases is hindered by the
lack of genomic information available for many of the
avian species known to be capable of infection by the
virus. Alleviating this lack of detailed genomic information will inevitably assist in understanding the differences
of immune responses in a range of avian species and allow
better treatment and control strategies to be implemented.
We have utilised a whole genome chicken array to determine how useful it may be for the study of gene expression in other bird species. In particular we were interested
to test a set of immunological gene probes on our chicken
microarrays to see if they provide functionally useful
results, thus revealing the utility of the arrays in cross-species studies. Here we test the utility of a whole chicken
genome microarray to study immune response in other

Tissue collection
Spleen samples were collected from a wide range of avian
species (Figure 1) (Chicken, Gallus gallus; Duck, Anas platyrhynchos; Starling, Sturnus vulgaris; Magpie goose, Anseranas semipalmata; Kookaburra, Dacelo novaeguineae and
Tawny frogmouth, Podargus strigoides) and placed into 10
volumes of RNAlater (Ambion, USA) and stored at -20°C
until RNA isolation. All control birds were at adult stage
and free from clinical disease. Five-week-old Pekin ducks
were challenged with a Vietnamese H5N1 strain (A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/453/2004); each dose contained
approximately 107.2 median egg infectious doses (EID50).
Spleen samples were collected 2 days post infection.
Infected samples were confirmed using viral titres (data
not shown).
Total RNA isolation and cDNA preparation
Total RNA for all samples studied was isolated using the
Meridian total RNA isolation kit (Cartagen). Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and
indirectly labelled with Cy3 using the ULS cDNA Synthesis and Labelling Kit (Kreatech Technologies). The
labelled probes were concentrated using Microcon Ultracel YM-30 Columns (Amicon Bioseparations) and the
quality and label incorporation of each sample was verified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies).
Microarray design and hybridisation
Each Cy3 labelled spleen sample was individually hybridised to the whole genome chicken array (single colour
hybridisation). This whole genome chicken microarray
was printed with a MicroGrid II spotting robot in house
using a set of 20,460 long oligos (65–75 nt) printed in
duplicate on each array. The oligo set was designed at the
Roslin Institute (Scotland, UK) based upon chicken

Whole genome chicken arrays were pre-hybridised at
42°C for 45 min in pre-hybridisation buffer (25% (v/v)

testes DNA). Following addition of the labelled probe and

0.0125% saturated spots were discarded. Each array was
globally normalised; global normalisation was used as it
ensures that the measured intensities are comparable
across all slides. This sort of normalisation allows comparison of all arrays without biases when a majority of the
spots on the arrays were giving positive hybridisation signals [12]. Subsequent statistical tests were carried out for
the duck samples using GeneSpring 7.2 (Silicon Genetics)
to determine all genes differentially regulated to a specified cut-off value (p = 0.05). A condition tree was constructed to explore the gene expression relationship
between all duck samples. Condition trees were performed using standard correlation in GeneSpring 7.2.
Spot net intensities were calculated from the median spot
and background intensities with all results less than one
standard deviation of the respective spot background
pixel intensities ignored (set to zero). The net intensities
of all arrays were then normalised such that the maximum
spot intensity in each array was 10,000.

0.1% (w/v) SDS, 25% (v/v) KREAblock), all arrays were
incubated for 16 h at 42°C. Post hybridisation, all arrays
were washed once in (2 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) for 5 min
at 42°C, once in (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at
25°C and three times in 0.1% SSC, each for 1 min at
25°C. For each avian species two independent spleen
samples were hybridised to separate arrays to ensure
reproducibility, except in the case of the H5N1 duck samples where three independent control spleen duck samples and three independent infected H5N1 spleen duck
samples were hybridised.
Microarray analysis
Post hybridisation all arrays were scanned and gene
expression signals captured using an ArrayWORXe
(Applied Precision) fluorescent scanner. All arrays were
background corrected and arrays that had more than

Cross avian hybridisation of whole chicken genome arrays
A range of avian samples spanning the Neognathae infraclass were used in this experiment (Figure 1). All of these
avian samples were successfully hybridised to the whole
genome chicken microarray and this is demonstrated in
the summary statistics in Table 1. All arrays passed our
quality control measures with the magpie geese samples
displaying the least amount of spots higher than one
standard deviation above background at 67%. As expected
chicken spleen samples performed the best with 78%
spots passing quality control (it is not expected that
hybridising chicken to the whole chicken genome microarray will ever result in 100% spot hybridisation as not all
genes in the genome will be expressed in any one sample).
Background median intensities were similar for all arrays
except for the duck arrays, where the values were higher.
The duck spleen samples also displayed a larger net intensity and background standard deviation than all the other
microarrays. The distributions of the log10 transformed
normalised spot intensities for all control samples are
plotted in Figure 2. These plots show similar trends
between all samples except the magpie goose and duck
arrays. The magpie goose plot shows a shift highlighting
the higher number of low intensity spots on these arrays.
The duck plot suggests that these samples have a greater
number of high intensity spots when compared with
chicken. Overall the avian microarrays displayed a significant range of spot intensities across the chicken microarray.

In order to further support the use of the whole chicken
genome array for other avian species we specifically investigated the expression levels of a test set of chicken genes
with known immunological functions. These results are

shown in Table 2. Each of the avian species provided significant net signal intensity for a variety of the genes investigated. A number of the genes were more highly
expressed in the other avian species when compared to
chicken. The defensin gallinacin 1 gave significant net
intensities for all birds studied, with particularly high values for both duck and tawny frogmouth. A number of the
genes including IL-8, IFN, IFN and caspase 3 gave low
or no net intensity signals across all samples. In summary,
all avian samples tested here provided significant net signal intensities for a number of the chicken genes with
known immunological functions.
Differentiating between H5N1 infected and uninfected
ducks
A total of 2103 genes were differentially expressed (p =
0.05), 685 genes were up regulated in the H5N1 infected
ducks and a further 244 genes were down regulated when
compared to the uninfected controls (above 1.8 fold).

can be found in the supplementary data (Additional file
1). Gene expression results are represented as a condition
tree (Figure 3) and can be used to clearly differentiate the
infected duck samples from the uninfected samples based
on their gene expression profiles, which placed each
group on separate arms of the tree. This condition tree
also highlights the large number of regulated genes in the
duck samples, and in particular identified key immune
genes IL-1, GAL4 and MHC class II that are regulated in
the H5N1 infected samples.

Discussion
Microarrays are a powerful tool for studying the gene
expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. For species like the chicken where the whole genome has been
sequenced it is possible to construct tailored whole
genome arrays that allow comprehensive gene expression
studies. For other avian species, such as duck, where there
is little available genomic information, it is not yet possible to design specific microarrays. In this study, we
explored the technical feasibility of utilising cross species
hybridisations to identify genes expressed in a broad
range of avian species. Our experimental strategy was
three-fold. The first goal was to test the hybridisation of a
number of phylogenetically diverse avian species on the
whole genome chicken microarray. Our second goal was
to determine if this microarray platform was able to distinguish between two different biological states in a bird
species other than chicken. Thirdly, we were interested in
testing the feasibility of the whole genome chicken microarray in avian immunological studies by focusing on the
performance of known chicken immune genes.
As documented previously [10], long oligonucleotide
microarrays are a reliable tool for CSH as they identify significantly more regulated genes at a lower false discovery
rate than microarrays with short oligomers. Long oligonucleotide arrays are also considered to be an improvement
over cDNA arrays as they eradicate the problem of clone
misidentification and erroneous cross hybridisation [13].
The use of the long oligonucleotide whole genome
chicken array as a tool in comparative genomics for other
avian species has been validated in this study. We have
successfully hybridised a broad range of phylogenetically

distinct bird species to this microarray. Each of the avian
species had a large number of spots that passed our quality control measures to the extent that there was a low
degree of spot drop out (at most 11%) compared to the
chicken.
Overall most of the avian samples showed a similar performance to chicken when hybridised to the chicken
microarray; however there were some slight shifts in some
of the expression profiles. The magpie goose arrays displayed a higher number of spots with lower signals compared with chicken and had the fewest number of genes
that passed our quality control measures. This may be
explained by a lack of genetic similarity between chicken
and magpie goose; however with little sequence information for magpie goose we must be cautious when interpreting our results. These results highlight the potential
use of this whole genome chicken long oligonucleotide
microarray for gene expression studies in a wide range of
avian species.

When performing CSH the degree of sequence complimentarily between probes and targets is variable. Differences in hybridisation levels can be attributed to
transcript abundance levels, the presence of sequence mismatches and differences in hybridisation kinetics [13,14].
Due to these limitations, it is not possible to compare
gene expression levels for particular genes across species,
but comparisons within a species is valid because of the
same level of sequence identity and hybridisation kinetics
will apply. Thus, we present the experiment utilising the
H5N1 infected ducks as a test of the validity of using a
chicken microarray to distinguish between two different
immune states in ducks. This serves as a tool to carry out
more in depth analysis of H5N1 infection in ducks. By
contrasting such results with findings in the chicken it
may be possible to determine the basis for the very different outcomes of viral infection in each species [15].
The whole genome chicken microarrays were successful in
differentiating the infected ducks and control ducks from

Conclusion
This is the first study to show the benefits of CSH for avian
species using a whole genome chicken long oligonucleotide microarray. We have successfully demonstrated
hybridisation of a number of phylogenetically diverse
bird species to this chicken array. In so doing we have
been able to identify a range of immune genes that can be
detected in the avian species studied. We have also demonstrated the use of this chicken array as a tool to investigate gene expression in closely related immune genes.
This study provides avian immunologists with a new tool
to investigate gene expression in avian species with little
or no genome information.

one another based on their overall gene expression profiles. In addition, the chicken microarrays were able to
identify a number of key immune genes that were regulated in the H5N1 infected ducks. These genes include IL1, MHC class II alpha chain and the defensin gene GAL4.
These genes have been previously shown to be involved in
a chicken's response to infection [16] and thus it is plausible that these genes play a similar role in ducks. Interestingly the sequence similarity of IL-1 in ducks and
chicken is 99% and it has recently been shown to be structurally and functionally homologous [17-19]. Moreover,
the use of chicken microarrays to investigate gene expression in other birds may provide a new way of identifying
conserved genes with known immunological functions in
other avian species. In particular, CSH may be used to
investigate H5N1 infection in a range of other bird species
including swans, crows, turkeys, quail and geese. Cross
species hybridisation is a feasible approach because of the
relatively close evolutionary distance between avian species. While CSH has great potential for use in a wide range
of avian species, it must also be noted that this method of
studying gene expression will neglect to capture species
specific genes that are involved in the host response.
