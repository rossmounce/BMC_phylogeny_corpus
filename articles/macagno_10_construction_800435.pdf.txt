Abstract
Background: The medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, is an important model system for the study of nervous system structure,
function, development, regeneration and repair. It is also a unique species in being presently approved for use in medical
procedures, such as clearing of pooled blood following certain surgical procedures. It is a current, and potentially also future, source
of medically useful molecular factors, such as anticoagulants and antibacterial peptides, which may have evolved as a result of its
parasitizing large mammals, including humans. Despite the broad focus of research on this system, little has been done at the
genomic or transcriptomic levels and there is a paucity of openly available sequence data. To begin to address this problem, we
constructed whole embryo and adult central nervous system (CNS) EST libraries and created a clustered sequence database of the
Hirudo transcriptome that is available to the scientific community.
Results: A total of ~133,000 EST clones from two directionally-cloned cDNA libraries, one constructed from mRNA derived
from whole embryos at several developmental stages and the other from adult CNS cords, were sequenced in one or both
directions by three different groups: Genoscope (French National Sequencing Center), the University of Iowa Sequencing
Facility and the DOE Joint Genome Institute. These were assembled using the phrap software package into 31,232 unique
contigs and singletons, with an average length of 827 nt. The assembled transcripts were then translated in all six frames and
compared to proteins in NCBI's non-redundant (NR) and to the Gene Ontology (GO) protein sequence databases, resulting in
15,565 matches to 11,236 proteins in NR and 13,935 matches to 8,073 proteins in GO. Searching the database for transcripts
of genes homologous to those thought to be involved in the innate immune responses of vertebrates and other
invertebrates yielded a set of nearly one hundred evolutionarily conserved sequences, representing all known pathways
involved in these important functions.
Conclusions: The sequences obtained for Hirudo transcripts represent the first major database of genes expressed in this
important model system. Comparison of translated open reading frames (ORFs) with the other openly available leech
datasets, the genome and transcriptome of Helobdella robusta, shows an average identity at the amino acid level of 58% in
matched sequences. Interestingly, comparison with other available Lophotrochozoans shows similar high levels of amino
acid identity, where sequences match, for example, 64% with Capitella capitata (a polychaete) and 56% with Aplysia californica
(a mollusk), as well as 58% with Schistosoma mansoni (a platyhelminth). Phylogenetic comparisons of putative Hirudo innate
immune response genes present within the Hirudo transcriptome database herein described show a strong resemblance to
the corresponding mammalian genes, indicating that this important physiological response may have older origins than
what has been previously proposed.

Background
Contemporary studies of biological systems are increasingly dependent upon detailed knowledge of genomic
sequences, as well as spatiotemporal data on gene expression in cells and tissues. This need is being met in part by
a growing but limited number of published complete
genomic sequences that are now available for many of the
most studied model organisms, but for many important
and useful species this is not currently the case, though
the ever-decreasing cost of large scale sequencing leads to
some optimism that this will change in the near future.
For functional genomic studies, however, the significantly
more modest investment required for creating transcript
databases of expressed sequence tags derived from cDNA
libraries has provided the opportunity to pursue gene discovery and functional genetic studies in the absence of a
fully sequenced genome. We report here the creation of a
transcriptome resource for the medicinal leech, an organism with a long history of contributions in neuroscience.
The medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, is an important model system for the study of nervous system structure, function, development, regeneration and repair. It is
also a unique species in being presently approved for use
in medical procedures, such as clearing of pooled blood
following certain surgical procedures [1]. It is a current,
and potentially also future, source of medically useful
molecular factors, such as anticoagulants and antibacterial peptides [2-12], which may have evolved as a result of
its parasitizing large mammals, including humans.
Because of its relative simplicity and accessibility, the
central nervous system (CNS) the medicinal leech,
Hirudo medicinalis, has been extensively studied and
analyzed. Central neurons can be identified, beginning
early in embryogenesis, and most have been characterized anatomically and physiologically, their synaptic connectivities assayed, and their roles in particular behaviors
determined [13]. The leech CNS has also become a focus
for studies of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
development, regeneration and repair, as well as the
interface of neural function and the innate immune
response [14-20]. Recent advances in the application of
contemporary molecular genetic and biochemical techniques to studies of the leech nervous system, including
RNA interference [21] and ectopic gene expression in single identified cells [22] or groups of cells [23], as well as
mass spectrometry (MS) imaging of embryonic whole
mounts and adult sections [24], have opened the door to
detailed studies of the mechanisms underlying fundamental biological phenomena.
Leeches are annelids with a fixed number of segments
(32 metameres), in contrast to other annelid groups (i.e.,
oligochaetes and polychaetes), which have variable numbers. The CNS of the leech consists of 32 bilateral neuromeres, of which the 4 anterior-most fuse to form the

Page 2 of 13

sub-esophageal ganglion and the 7 posterior-most fuse to
form the tail ganglion. Individual ganglia in mid-body
segments are comprised of single bilateral neuromeres
connected to each other by a bilateral pair of nerves (the
lateral "connectives") and a single small medial nerve
(Faivre's), and to the periphery by two or three bilateral
pairs of nerves ("roots") that branch in stereotypic patterns. In addition, many sensory neurons in the body wall
and other internal organs comprise the peripheral nervous system (PNS), providing a variety of sensory information to the CNS.
In hirudinid leeches, each segmental ganglionic primordium gives rise to ~400 neurons [25]. Most of these
occur as bilateral pairs (~180-190 pairs), but 5-8% are
unpaired, with at least some becoming unpaired through
cell death [25,26]. Thus, understanding how a leech segmental ganglion functions requires, in principle, detailed
knowledge of the function and connectivity of only ~200220 individual neurons. Moreover, since each segmental
ganglion is a variation on a theme (with the exception of
the "sex" ganglia of body segments 5 and 6, which have
additional complements of neurosecretory cells [27]), the
leech has one of the most accessible nervous systems
from a systems analysis point of view. Current knowledge
of which neurons contribute to the activity of neuronal
circuits responsible for generating specific behavioral
responses (see review by [28]) is becoming much more
complete as a result of the recent and successful application of multi-neuronal functional imaging to leech ganglia [29].
Lacking within this constellation of detailed knowledge
about the nervous system of the medicinal leech are
genomic and transcriptomic sequence databases of sufficient size to enable detailed genetic functional studies.
This paucity led us to undertake the construction of EST
libraries, particularly from neural tissue, the sequencing
of over 130,000 clones, and the generation and analysis of
a representative transcriptomic database reported herein.
The generation of these resources paves the way for an indepth examination of genetic pathways involved in development and regeneration of the nervous system as well as
mechanisms of neuroimmunity.

Results and Discussion
Generation and assembly of total embryonic and adult CNS
ESTs

Our general goal was to define a large (but not necessarily
complete) representative set of the genes expressed in the
embryonic and adult central nervous systems of the
medicinal leech that would be useful in future analyses of
neural development, neural regeneration and repair, neural stress responses and neural innate immune responses.
To this end, we generated expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) from two cDNA libraries derived from (a) multiple

Macagno et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:407
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/407

embryonic stages and (b) adult central nervous system
(CNS). This approach has been successfully used in the
past to identify the set of transcribed genes specific to an
organ or tissue of a particular organism (see e.g., [30]).
After subtraction of the most abundant clones, the
libraries were sequenced using different strategies at
three separate sites. Sequencing at the University of Iowa
included embryonic clones and adult CNS clones, mostly
from the 3' end; at the Joint Genome Institute sequences
were generated starting at both 5' and 3' ends of clones
from the embryonic cDNA library; and at Genoscope,
sequences were generated only from the 5' ends of adult
nervous system library clones exclusively. A total of
133,161 reads were generated, 41,928 (31%) representing
embryonic transcripts and 91,233 (69%) adult transcripts;
the contributions from each source are enumerated in
Table 1. Of these, 76% were sequenced 5' to 3', and 24% 3'
to 5'.
The ~133,000 raw sequences represent ~86.2 × 106
nucleotides. Raw sequences were trimmed of vector and
repetitive as well as low-quality sequences, yielding
133,161 high-quality masked ESTs with an average read
length of 648 nt. Some of the sequences were paired
(clones sequenced from both ends) and if they overlapped, were merged. These operations removed about
5% of the raw sequence data, leaving ~81.6 × 106 nucleotides and an average sequence length of 656 nt.
The sequences were assembled using the phrap program, which yielded 31,232 contiguous sequences (contigs - see Table 2). About 20% of these were sufficiently
similar to others that they might be considered repeats.
They might also represent genetic variants since our
libraries likely contain transcripts from two very closely
related species of European medicinal leeches, Hirudo
medicinalis and Hirudo verbana [31]. Or, they may represent splice variants. Since splice variation is abundant in
the human CNS [32,33], our assembly was tuned to preserve small variations as separate transcripts (See Methods for detail). Thus, we estimate that these complete and
partial transcripts may represent ~25,000 unique gene
structures. 3% of the transcripts were assembled from

only embryonic sequences, 23% from only adult CNS
sequences, and 74% from clones derived from both
sources. Of the total 133,161 ESTs, 78,288 contributed
non-redundant information to the assembly. The remaining ESTs matched subsequences of contributing ESTs.
Table 2 shows the numbers of contiguous sequences that
were assembled from different numbers of non-redundant ESTs; 16,710 transcripts are assembled from two or
more ESTs, and 14,522 are singletons, of which 8,612
matched no assembled transcript at any percent identity.
Computational analysis of the sequence data was performed to evaluate sequence redundancy within and
across datasets, sequencing quality, and transcript paralogy (see Methods for details).

The 31,232 sequences from the merged input sets were
pairwise aligned with BLASTX using default parameters
with the non-redundant set of public protein sequences,
NR, downloaded from GenBank, maintained at NCBI
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, May 14, 2009). For each
query sequence, its suite of pairwise alignments was evaluated to select a well-supported description line and to
build a weighted index of descriptive words. Using a relevance scoring algorithm based on alignment qualities (see

Macagno et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:407
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/407

Page 4 of 13

Methods for details), the most relevant description was
selected as representative for the query sequence.
Table 3 presents a summary of the number of matches
of putative Hirudo peptides/proteins with those of a
selected set of species representative of three major metazoan phyla, the Lophotrochozoa (which includes
leeches), the Ecdysozoa and the Chordates, for which
complete genomic sequence data is openly available. For
each of seven species, the number of transcripts which
rank best through seventh-best match is presented. As
might be expected, the closest relation, with 13,047 best
matches and 16,732 total among the comparison group of
seven genomes, is to Helobdella robusta, a species
belonging to a distantly related family of non-blood sucking leeches [31]. Another annelid, the polychaete Capitella, is next with 2,905 best matches and a total of 15,153.
The next best matches are to chordates, with Branchiostoma slightly ahead of the zebrafish and human.
Sequence homology is significantly lower when the comparison is with the two representatives of the Ecdysozoa,
the fruit fly and the small nematode C. elegans (see Table
3). The sequences obtained for Hirudo transcripts represent the first major database of genes expressed in this
important model system.
To construct the seven-proteome comparison to the
Hirudo transcripts, six-frame translations of transcripts
were compared with complete proteomes from seven
organisms selected to range in phylogenetic distance
from Hirudo. For each transcript, for each proteome, the
rank from one to seven of the best match was counted. Of
note, no proteome consistently had the best match or
even the top three matches for Hirudo, and every proteome contributed at least a few best matching proteins,
with C. elegans lowest at 121 proteins with a match rank
of 1.

Another way to compare the Hirudo data to those of
the same set of species is shown in Figure 1, where the
number of matches is plotted versus average percent
identity at the amino acid level for the same comparison
group. Again, the closest species is H. robusta and the
most distant is C. elegans. In the middle range of 30-50%
identity, the number of matches of translated Hirudo
transcripts is approximately the same to the vertebrates
as it is to the two other annelids, and significantly higher
than to either Drosophila or Caenorhabditis. Of general
interest is the small cohort of protein domains that
remain perfectly or nearly perfectly conserved across all
seven organisms, represented by the alignments in the
91-100% range.
Comparison of translated open reading frames (ORFs)
with the other openly available leech datasets, the
genome and transcriptome of Helobdella robusta, shows
an average identity at the amino acid level of 58% in
matched sequences. Interestingly, comparison with other
available Lophotrochozoans shows similar high levels of
amino acid identity where sequences match, for example,
64% with Capitella capitata (a polychaete) [34] and 56%
with Aplysia californica (a mollusk) [35-37], as well as
58% with Schistosoma mansoni (a platyhelminth) [38]
These results support the idea that, evolutionarily, the
annelids have diverged less from the chordates than have
the more highly derived arthropods and nematodes [3944]. This is further supported by the analysis of a specific
group of functionally related proteins, those involved in
the innate immune response, as discussed below.

nervous system structure, function or development, we
aligned six-frame translations of the ~31,000 unique
transcripts (assembled sequences + singletons) against
the Gene Ontology data in all relevant categories. Overall, we obtained 3,955 matches against 157 of the 166 categories that include the defining term "neuro" and have
representative sequences in the Gene Ontology Database.
The number of matches for any one term ranged from 1
to a maximum of 1,206. Table 4 presents the number of
Hirudo matches for 30 GO categories that are relevant to
neuronal development and have the largest numbers of
matching transcripts. Numbers of transcripts assigned to
each neural process are shown, including numbers
assembled from embryo library sequences only, from
CNS libraries only, and from a mix of ESTs from both
types of libraries. Embryo-only, CNS-only, and "mixed"
were determined based on the full set of 133K ESTs, not
just the non-redundant contributing ESTs. The total
number of unique leech transcripts that matched these
30 categories is 3,003.
Partial Hirudo protein sequences were extracted from
the alignment data and annotated with their corresponding GO categories. (For the list of the GO identifiers
matched by each of the Hirudo transcripts, as well as to

obtain the Hirudo transcript sequences, please see additional files 1 and 2). Our results indicate that the Hirudo
transcript database contains a significant number of neural sequences, and that it will provide a useful resource
for exploring various aspects of nervous system function
and development.
Innate immunity response genes in Hirudo

The innate immune response is an evolutionarily ancient
defense strategy against pathogens that has been documented widely in living organisms, including plants and
fungi as well as invertebrate and vertebrate animals. In
vertebrates, its major functions include: (1) recruiting
immune system cells to infection sites though the production of chemokines and cytokines; (2) activating the
complement cascade in order to identify pathogens, activate cells to promote pathogen clearance and stimulate
the adaptative immune response; (3) interacting specifically with pathogens through membrane or cytosolic
receptors in leukocytes in order to remove pathogens
from organs and tissues; (4) activating the adaptative
immune response though antigen presentation processes
[45-51].

To search for the major players for these four functions,
we screened the Hirudo transcriptome database for possible homologs of vertebrate genes in these categories.
The results of this analysis are shown in Table 5. The 92
different transcripts identified fell into eight groups relevant to the immune system, including: pattern recognition receptors (PRR), PRR pathways, cytokine-related
molecules, complement system factors, clotting and
fibrinolytic cascades, cluster of differentiation related
genes, effector genes and adaptive immune response factors.
As can be seen in Table 5, of the 92 transcripts identified in the database as putatively related to immunity, 88

were derived from EST clones obtained from adult CNS
tissues, suggesting that the nervous system is deeply
involved in and capable of mounting a fully capable
innate immune response. A caveat that needs to be considered is that the leech CNS normally resides within a
blood sinus and is therefore continuously in contact with
cells of the blood and circulatory system, including fibroblasts, macrophages and microglia, which have been
implicated in immune responses in various systems.
Some of these may have been carried with the dissected
adult nervous systems that provided the mRNA from
which the EST libraries were made. Further work will be
essential in order to determine whether neurons and neu-

Numbers of Hirudo transcripts identified as putative homologs of genes belonging to seven major groups implicated in the innate immune
response, plus a group of potential representatives of the adaptive immune response. Most transcripts are assembled from both whole
embryo and adult CNS EST clones, with ~3% present exclusively in the embryonic clones and ~18% exclusively in the Adult CNS. Identification
of individual transcripts and the corresponding names of their putative homologs can be found in additional file 3.

roglia do express all of the factors we have identified as
neuronal or not.
We also determined the numbers of individual EST
clones in the raw data that showed high sequence overlap
(90% and 96% sequence identity; see additional file 3) as a
way to gain some measure of the relative abundances of
the putative immune system transcripts present in the
EST libraries. As can be seen in this table, with a 90%
nucleotide match criterion, the numbers of clones matching the assembled transcripts range from a single one to
over several hundred. The significance of this variability
in the frequency with which clones corresponding to
these transcripts were picked needs to be explored in
detail, but it does suggest that some components or some
pathways are actively and continuously expressed at
higher levels in the adult nervous system.
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)

Danger signaling receptors are well conserved in leeches.
The innate immune system uses different molecules that
sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These
include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic-acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1-like) receptors (RLRs), and the NODlike receptors (NLRs), all of which contain Leucine Rich
Repeat domains (LRRs). Some immunoglobulin superfamily members also contain LRR domains and are
known as ISLRs (immunoglobulin superfamily containing Leucine-rich repeats), as for example the Trk neurotrophin receptor protein [52].
TOLL-like receptors (TLRs)

In the Hirudo EST libraries reported here, our analysis
led to the identification of 4 TLRs (Table 5; additional file

3). The complete sequence of one of these, HmTLR1, has
been obtained and shows particular homology to the
mouse TLR13 [17] Interestingly, in the leech nervous system HmTLR1 appears to be associated with the expression of a cytokine, EMAPII, following exposure to
bacterial toxins or in response to a nerve crush [17], but
not with the expression of antimicrobial peptides known
to be expressed by the central nervous system [16]. It is
worth pointing out that these antimicrobial peptides
(neuromacin, lumbricin) appear to exert neurotrophic
effects after a nerve crush [16] in line with recent data
obtained in mammals [53].
TLR pathways

Analysis of the Hirudo transcriptome database reveals
the presence of putative homologs of nearly all factors
reported to play critical roles in human TLR pathways,
with the exception of homologs of TRIF, TAB1/2 and the
Endosome receptor (Table 5; for EST identification and
to obtain sequences, see additional file 3). This stands in
sharp contrast to other invertebrates, such as insects and
nematodes, for which the PRR pathways thus far appear
to be much simpler, with many components missing.
Whether all the identified leech putative homologs
indeed play similar functional roles remains to be shown
by further analysis, but their presence in the transcriptome database adds support to the hypothesis that
Lophotrochozoan genetic programs are more closely
related to those of vertebrates than are those of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis, two highly-derived members
of the other major protostomian group, the Ecdysozoans

Immune Effectors: Antimicrobial peptides

Several antimicrobial peptides (lumbricin, theromacin,
theromyzin) and destabilases sharing activities against
Gram+ and/or Gram- bacteria have been detected and
cloned from the Hirudo CNS [16] (see additional file 3).
We have also identified putative leech homologs of serpins (eglin c) and a tryptase inhibitor (LDTI), which in
other systems are known to be active against viruses like
HIV or Hepatitis C Virus NS3 protease [54,55].
Cytokines

Several cytokines have been identified recently in leech
(Table 5; additional file 3), e.g., one is related to human
p43/Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide 2
(EMAP2) [17]. Interestingly, in the leech nervous system
HmTLR1 appears to be associated with the expression of
the cytokine EMAP2 following exposure to bacterial toxins or in response to a nerve crush [17] but not with the
expression of antimicrobial peptides also present in the
nervous system [16].
Once activated, danger sensing receptors can promote
the production of numerous molecular effectors like antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), chemokines and cytokines.
These factors participate in the recruitment of immune
cells, development of the inflammatory response and
finally, in mammals, the adapative immune response.
Among the effectors already discovered in leeches,
HmTLR1 is linked to the cytokine related to EMAP2 in
the context on the brain immune response after [17].
EMAP2 is the first cytokine-related molecule characterized in invertebrate nervous systems. In mammals,
EMAP2 is known to participate in the recruitment of
polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear phagocytes, to promote endothelial apoptosis, and to enhance
the expression of some other cytokines [56].
Complement

The Hirudo database contains putative homologs of the
majority of elements thought to participate in pathogen
recognition in vertebrates through cell-membrane carbohydrate detection, opsonization and phagocytosis
through C3-related protein and α2 macroglobulin-related
protein (Table 5, additional file 3). However, the first element already characterized in the leech brain, related to
C1q, has been shown to be involved in microglial
chemotaxis [18].
Cluster of Differentiation (CD) proteins

The CD system is commonly used as cell markers, allowing cells to be defined based on what molecules are present on their surface. In particular, CD proteins are often
used to associate cells with certain immune functions.
While using one CD molecule to define populations is
uncommon (though a few examples exist), combining
markers has allowed for cell types with very specific definitions within the immune system [57,58]. We detected
several putative leech CDs (Table 5; additional file 3) that

Page 8 of 13

are similar to mammalian CDs, e.g., HmCD45, sharing
55% identity with human CD45, and HmCD20, HmCD19
and HmCD61 sharing 32%, 31% and 31% identity with
mouse CD20, CD19 and CD61. These data are in line
with the results obtained by de Eguileor et al., [57,58],
who used human monoclonal antibodies to detect different leech hemocytic cell types, e.g., Macrophage-like cells
positive for CD25, CD14, CD61, CD68, CD11b and
CD11c, NK-like cells positive for CD25, CD56, CD57 and
CD16, and granulocytes positive for CD11b and CD11c.
Adaptive Immune Response elements

The data discussed above indicate that the majority of
proteins known to participate in the vertebrate innate
immune response are present in the medicinal leech transcriptome. This raises an interesting question: are
orthologs of factors implicated in the vertebrate adaptive
immune response also present in the leech transcriptome? Indeed, several are, including genes related to Rag1 (Recombination activating gene) as well as calnexin,
calreticulin, cathepsins and several others (additional file
3). For example, the HmRag-1 transcript in the Hirudo
database displays high sequence homology with vertebrate Rag-1, particularly in two MtN3/saliva domains
(average 48% homology). The presence of a Rag-1 related
gene in leech is suggestive of the presence of an adaptative response in these long-lived span animals (around 30
years) and opens the door to a reconsideration of the evolution of immune response. Determining whether molecules sharing recombination signal sequence (RSSs)
[59,60] homology are present in the leech will be an
important step towards establishing the presence of a real
adaptive immune response in the medicinal leech, but the
presence of Rag-1 related genes in leech is consistent with
recent data obtained in the Aplysia genome, in which a
N-RAG-TP transposon encodes a protein similar to the
N-terminal part of Rag-1 in vertebrates has been discovered [61]. Similarly, a Rag1/2-like cluster has been found
in the sea urchin genome [62-65]. These data are consistent with the theory that V(D)J recombination reaction in
jawed vertebrates catalyzed by the Rag-1 and Rag-2 proteins could have emerged approximately 500 million
years ago from transposon-encoded proteins. Interestingly, the "core" region of Rag-1 required for its catalytic
activity is significantly similar to the transposase encoded
by DNA transposons that belong to the Transib superfamily. This superfamily was discovered recently based
on computational analysis of the fruit fly, the African
malaria mosquito, yellow fever mosquito, silkworm, dog
hookworm, hydra, soybean rust and sea urchin genomes
[66]. The leech Rag-1-related molecule also aligns with
the core part of the Transib transposase from Helicoverpa
zea [67] further supporting the hypothesis. The complete
gene sequence will allow us, in the future, to confirm
definitively its homology.

While these observations need to be supplemented by
functional studies that confirm the tentative identifications, they do raise a question that needs to be fully
explored: did the adaptive immune response evolve earlier than presently thought?

the interactions among neurons, glia and blood-borne
cells in the responses to pathogens, mechanical damage
and other stresses? And (c) What is the nature of the
innate immune response mounted by the nervous system?

Conclusions
We expect that the open availability of the Hirudo transcript database described herein will help researchers
interested in pursuing both functional and comparative
studies of proteins and peptides involved in many important biological phenomena. Transcript sequence information is an essential complement to other on-going
studies of the leech nervous system, making it possible to
explore systemically the genetic programs and the molecular mechanisms that specify individual CNS cells and
their ensemble properties in this important model organism. Since gene expression and function can now be
assayed and modulated in individual leech neurons or
groups of neurons, a systems level approach, focused on
relating the neural expression of genetic programs to
physiological programs, would be timely and perhaps
uniquely feasible in the leech.
Considering the immune response, our data suggest
that a well conserved innate immune response, very similar to that found in vertebrates as well as other invertebrate species, including Biomphalaria glabrata [68-71],
Daphnia pulex [72], Crassostrea gigas [73], Aplysia [61],
and Chlamys farreri [74], is present in Hirudo, but many
details need to be explored further. The medicinal leech
is a very important model for exploring interactions
between danger sensing receptors in and anti-microbial
responses to both bacteria and viruses, given its interactions over time with its human hosts. Perhaps the most
important aspect of the observations we are reporting
here is that most if not all the immune factors and mechanisms we have identified appear to be present in the
Hirudo nervous system. Thus, we have preliminary evidence that an essentially complete innate immune
response occurs in the leech CNS, especially after
mechanical damage, such as a nerve crush, during the
complex processes that underlie regeneration. Thus, this
model system will allow dissecting the cross-talk between
neurons, macroglia and microglia cells, as well as cells
and other factors found in the haemolymph. The leech
ventral nerve cord is covered by a semi permeable protective capsule and resides within the ventral sinus of the circulatory system, thus being continuously bathed by
haemolymph. This capsule and the interaction with blood
resemble the mammalian hematological blood-brain barrier. Hirudo, therefore, is an excellent model system for
exploring fundamental questions about the interaction of
the nervous and innate immune systems, including (a)
What is the range of functions of microglia? (b) What are

Methods
Animal maintenance and tissue preparation

Leech embryos and adults used in these experiments
were obtained from a Hirudo medicinalis colony maintained in our laboratory. Prior to use, embryos were
removed from their cocoons and kept in artificial spring
water (0.5 g/l Instant Ocean, Aquarium Systems) at 22°C,
and staged according to the criteria of Fernandez and
Stent [75]. At this temperature, day 0 (E0) is defined as
the day of cocoon deposition and day 30 (E30) as the day
of emergence of the juvenile animal from the cocoon.
RNA isolation

To construct whole embryo and adult CNS libraries, total
RNA was extracted in RNALater (Ambion) using Trizol
reagent (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD). Total RNA was
quantitated by spectrophotometry and the quality was
determined by 2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA samples
using oligo-(dT)-cellulose chromatography.
The method used for the construction of directionally
cloned cDNA libraries [76] includes a column chromatography step that is aimed at eliminating unwanted DNA
fragments (primers and adaptors) and short cDNAs (e.g.,
those consisting exclusively of poly(A) tail). Although
aware of the possibility of excluding cDNAs derived from
genuine short transcripts, this step has proven important
to minimize generation of nuisance ESTs in large-scale
sequencing projects [77].
Construction of cDNA libraries

DNase-treated poly-(A)+ samples were used to create
start (non-normalized) cDNA libraries from which normalized and subtracted cDNA libraries were developed.
For each library, cDNA was primed with the following
oligo (dT) primer, [TGTTACCATTCTGATGTTGGAGCGGCCGC-N[6-10]-T [76]]. Each primer contained a NotI restriction site for directional cloning and a
unique oligonucleotide library tag, which identifies the
condition of origin (embryo or adult CNS; Gavin et al.
2002). Double-stranded cDNA was ligated to EcoRI adaptors [5'-AATTGGCACGAGG-3', 3'-GCCGTGCTCC-5'],
digested with NotI, and directionally cloned into the
phagemid vector pT7T3-Pac as described in [76]. Each
library comprised several times more recombinants than
the expected number of transcripts from the RNA populations utilized, and thus can be treated as if they had the
same number of primary recombinants.

Sequencing, analysis and clustering

Di-deoxy terminator sequencing was performed from the
3' end of the cDNA clones using M13 forward (5'GTTTTCCCAGTCAC-3') primers in a 96-well format
via cycle sequencing with dRhodamine dye terminator
chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After
thermal cycling, sequencing reactions were processed
and analyzed on ABI 3730xl, ABI-377 or ABI-3700 capillary sequencer as described in [78]. Nucleotide sequences
and per-base quality values were extracted from the ABIgenerated chromatograph files (SCF and AB1 files) using
the phred base-calling program and evaluated for 3 features: 1) overall sequence quality (phred q-score >25); 2)
percent of sequence (in nt) over q20 > 50%, and 3) the
quality-trimmed EST insert length of more than 100 bp
[79].
ESTprep [80] and RepeatMasker [81] programs were
used to assess the presence of the following EST features:
vector cloning site, restriction site, polyadenylation tail
and signal sequence, library tag, and potential contaminating sequences from Escherichia coli as described in
[78]. Local clustering of the ESTs was performed using
the sequence-based clustering program UIcluster [82],
allowing matches based on both the forward and reverse
complements.
ESTs were screened for spurious ribosomal RNA
sequences as follows. A database was constructed of 18 S,
28 S, and 16 S rRNA gene sequences from closely related
organisms with rRNA sequences in NR, including Aeolosoma, Aliolimnatis, Aporrectodea, Diestecostoma, Eisenia, Enchytraeus, Haemadipsa, Haementeria, Haemopis,
Helobdella, Hirudo, Inanidrilus, Lumbricus, Smithsonidrilus, Stylaria, Tubifex, and Tubificoides species. ESTs
aligning partially or completely with rRNAs at 90% identity or higher were flagged as rRNA suspects or rRNA
genes, respectively.
Sequence analysis and clustering

Computational analysis of the sequence data was performed to evaluate sequence redundancy within and
across datasets, sequencing quality, and transcript paralogy. The analysis assembled overlapping reads into contiguous sequences (contigs). Each input sequence was
assigned an identifier that indicated its source library,
sequencing center, and sequencing strategy (e.g., 3'-end
or 5'-end). Each assembled contig received a new identifier that reflected the identifiers of its contributing input
sequences. Contigs were produced by assembling the
133,161 sequences from the three source datasets. For the
combined input set, the following computation was executed: all sequences were pairwise aligned with all other
sequences using BLASTN with default parameters [83]. If
two sequences participated in a pairwise alignment above
a pre-selected threshold quality, they were put into a
"bin"; additional sequences were added to the bin if they
had a sufficient pairwise alignment to a sequence already

Page 10 of 13

in the bin. When no further sequences could be added to
the bin, a new bin was started with a remaining pairwise
alignment, until no further sequences remained with sufficient quality alignments. The sequences within each bin
were subjected to assembly using phrap with default
parameters http://www.phrap.org. For each bin, phrap
produced one or more contigs from the input sequences
and labeled unassembled sequences as "singlets" or
"problems", depending on the nature of their differences
from the contigs. phrap output was evaluated to obtain
contigs, singleton sequences, and "problem" sequences
for each bin. The most common type of so-called "problem" sequences had a high number of ambiguous nucleotides, denoted by 'N' instead of A, C, G or T. The
binning step was intended to facilitate efficiency of
assembly. Binning was constrained using a minimum
threshold on percent identity for alignments that met the
default maximum E-value. Bins were computed with percent identity thresholds of 95%, 90%, 85% and 80%. Similar numbers of contigs were obtained from bins
constructed at or below 90% identity. From the 90% identical bins, the 133,161 sequencing reads assembled into
16,710 contigs with two or more contributing sequences
plus 8,612 singletons and 5,910 "problem" sequences for a
total of 31,232 output sequences.
To facilitate efficiency of assembly and to ensure sensitivity to splice variation and genetic variation, input
sequences were binned as described in the previous paragraph. Our binning algorithm accomplished the following: for every sequence, if it had a pairwise alignment
with any subsequence of any other input sequence, the
sequences were placed in the same bin. Each bin of two or
more sequences was subjected to assembly with phrap
using default settings to produce consensus contigs, singletons and problem sequences (e.g., sequences with too
many ambiguities for phrap's default thresholds). The
original, unassembled 3' and 5' sequences generated as a
part of this research were submitted to dbEST division of
GenBank at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under accession numbers ranging from GenBank: EY478949 to GenBank: EY505781 Assembled
sequences were annotated through alignments with the
NR database of proteins and loaded into a local database
available for queries at http://genomes.ucsd.edu/leechmaster/transcriptome-paper/.
Transcripts were annotated with protein functional
descriptions based on aggregate alignments with proteins
from the non-redundant protein database maintained at
NCBI (protein NR, downloaded from http://www.ncbi.
nih.gov). Proteins putatively involved in neural processes
were further annotated based on alignments to sequences
maintained and curated as part of the Gene Ontology
project (Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000; April 2009
Release). To assign functional descriptions based on NR
alignments, a relevance score was computed for each
description and each transcript as follows. For each

Macagno et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:407
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/407

Hirudo transcript, for its complement of aligned proteins,
each word from each description was assigned a weight
based on sequence alignment quality. Any word in more
than one description received the sum of its alignment
qualities. Low information content words like "protein" or
"similar" were flagged by their high frequency of occurrence and filtered from contributing to description selection. The resulting list of weighted words for each query
was ordered by word weight, and mean and standard
deviation (STD) were computed. Words with weights
above two times STD were considered significant and
used for indexing; others were discarded. Each description received a score that was the sum of its word
weights, and the highest scoring description was selected
for the query transcript.
