Abstract
Background: Most research scientists working in the fields of molecular epidemiology, population
and evolutionary genetics are confronted with the management of large volumes of data. Moreover,
the data used in studies of infectious diseases are complex and usually derive from different
institutions such as hospitals or laboratories. Since no public database scheme incorporating clinical
and epidemiological information about patients and molecular information about pathogens is
currently available, we have developed an information system, composed by a main database and a
web-based interface, which integrates both types of data and satisfies requirements of good
organization, simple accessibility, data security and multi-user support.
Results: From the moment a patient arrives to a hospital or health centre until the processing and
analysis of molecular sequences obtained from infectious pathogens in the laboratory, lots of
information is collected from different sources. We have divided the most relevant data into 12
conceptual modules around which we have organized the database schema. Our schema is very
complete and it covers many aspects of sample sources, samples, laboratory processes, molecular
sequences, phylogenetics results, clinical tests and results, clinical information, treatments,
pathogens, transmissions, outbreaks and bibliographic information. Communication between endusers and the selected Relational Database Management System (RDMS) is carried out by default
through a command-line window or through a user-friendly, web-based interface which provides
access and management tools for the data.
Conclusion: epiPATH is an information system for managing clinical and molecular information
from infectious diseases. It facilitates daily work related to infectious pathogens and sequences
obtained from them. This software is intended for local installation in order to safeguard private
data and provides advanced SQL-users the flexibility to adapt it to their needs.
The database schema, tool scripts and web-based interface are free software but data stored in our
database server are not publicly available. epiPATH is distributed under the terms of GNU General
Public License. More details about epiPATH can be found at http://genevo.uv.es/epipath.

Background
Infectious disease is defined as any illness caused by a specific pathogenic microorganism or its toxic product that
results from the transmission of that agent or its product
from an infected to a susceptible host, either directly or
indirectly through an intermediate [1]. There are many
different infectious pathogens that cause this kind of diseases and also some of them can be present as multiple
infections in the same individual, such as patients coinfected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
Molecular genetic information is being increasingly used
in the epidemiological study of infectious diseases to
understand transmission, virulence or resistance patterns
of microorganisms [2], pathogen evolution and hostpathogen interactions [3,4], pathogen resistance to treatments, susceptibility to disease, etc. In the study of pathogenic processes different kinds of demographical,
epidemiological, clinical and molecular data are important to obtain a complete view and a more comprehensive
understanding of the infectious disease. In most cases, this
kind of studies are developed by different institutions,
sometimes geographically disperse, collaborating with
each other by contributing of different types of information.
To study the interaction between a patient and a pathogen
from a population, evolutionary and epidemiological perspective, a huge amount of molecular sequences is needed
and current molecular techniques provide, with increasing affordability, this kind of data. An essential component to perform this kind of studies is having all these data
properly organized and accessible [5,6] to all implicated
researchers. In the case that a study is under development
and unfinished, users may not want to have their own
information being publicly accessible. These points, in
addition to a multi-user support capable system, are central aspects that must be taken into account when choosing a software to perform these tasks.
Until now, programs to perform molecular epidemiology
studies of infectious diseases were, on one hand, devoted
to the storage of information on patients and, on the
other, public databases repositories [7] or internal flat
files to store and retrieve sequences of pathogens. Currently, technologies to develop an information system are
available as free software and researchers are able to build
their own data management system. But this is a timeconsuming, costly process which requires considerable
expertise. Consequently and since there is no public database schema that incorporates clinical and epidemiological information about patients and molecular
information about pathogens, we have developed a very
complete and flexible information system, composed by a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/32

main database and a web-based interface, that integrates
both types of data and satisfies requirements of good
organization, simple accessibility, data security and multiuser support system.

Implementation
An information system consists of a group of elements
related according to some rules, which provides the necessary information to fulfil its purposes. The goals of such
an information system are the collection, processing, storage, production and presentation of data. Our information system is composed by a main MySQL [8] database
and a web-based interface.
Database design
From the moment a patient arrives to a hospital or health
centre to the analysis of sequences of the infectious pathogen in the laboratory, lots of information are collected.
We have extensively discussed with researchers and physicians that actually work in these and related fields about
their needs and finally we have divided all the sources of
information into 12 conceptual modules around which
the database schema has been organized (Table 1). Figure
1 shows the flow chart of information involved along this
process. The flow diagram of information starts with the
SAMPLE SOURCES module which refers to those places
where a pathogen can be found, either in patients or the
environment. Then, we can obtain CLINICAL INFORMATION of a patient when (s)he goes to physician, who asks
the patient to get some CLINICAL TESTS whose RESULTS
correspond to the patient. Moreover, we can have information about the type of TRANSMISSION with respect to
how or by whom was the patient infected and who (s)he
may have infected to. Then, the physician gives a TREATMENT to the patient and samples of the pathogen can be
collected. Samples are processed at the LABORATORY
where SEQUENCES are obtained. These sequences correspond to a specific PATHOGEN which is associated to a
type of transmission and, in some cases, to an OUTBREAK. Furthermore, sequences can be analyzed with
PHYLOGENETIC METHODS and eventually be PUBLISHED in different studies.

The data model chosen to represent data is the relational
model [9], composed by relations, that basically are tables
in which a row is called tuple and a column is called
attribute. An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram defines the
entities of the database and their relationships, so we can
have a global view of the information stored, as shown in
Figure 2. In this diagram the structures that set up the
information system with the restrictions that limit valid
requests are represented. Entities and attributes are
extended in a diagram developed with DBDesigner 4 [10]
program (Figures 3, 4, 5). A detailed description of each

field of the relational database tables is provided as Additional file 1.
In designing the database we have taken into account all
the existing infectious pathogens, either virus or bacteria,
so the system can store information from different organisms at the same time. This is very useful mainly in cases
of multiple infections, when studies involve more than
one pathogen per patient and all relevant information
(clinical, epidemiological and molecular) should be available. In these situations, it is easier for users and system
administrators to deposit and control all the information
in the same database schema instead of using different or
independent database schemas. Moreover, the infectious
pathogen general design contributes to the versatility and
suitability of this software that can be used in many different ways as needed by different users. For example, epiPATH could be used for a unique pathogen exclusively or
multiple pathogens simultaneously related studies: a user
may start studying one single pathogen, such as HCV, and
later he starts a new project with HCV/HIV coinfected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/32

patients or with a completely new pathogen. In this case
there is no need to modify this software and, obviously,
the learning curve is reduced to a minimum. Furthermore,
although this database schema has been designed for
multiple pathogens, it can be used as a database for individual pathogens on a per user basis by means of the
Views utility of MySQL. A view is a virtual or logical table
composed for the result of a query. Using views allows different accesses to the same database schema, either for different users, pathogens or any database characteristic of
interest. Views can be created as needed by the system
administrator and they also contribute to the security and
integrity of the data stored preventing a user from editing
or deleting other user's data.
Conceptual modules, in which information is divided,
add versatility to this software so that users choose which
kind of information is relevant for their studies by storing
that part of the database schema. Moreover, advanced
SQL-users could adapt it to their needs since epiPATH is
distributed under GNU license.

Database architecture
The molecular epidemiology database consists of 50
tables and was built using the MySQL RDMS running on
a Linux Fedora system. We used InnoDB tables because
they allow transactions. Currently, it is implemented in
MySQL Server version 5 but it also has been implemented
in earlier versions of MySQL Server without any problem.
Database design and scripts to create the schema have
been developed and obtained with DBDesigner 4. Scripts
were debugged and implemented into the RDMS with
MySQL Query Browser [11]. These tools have been
selected because of their free availability and wide use, as
well as their reliability and flexibility to run under different environments.
Web-based interface design
Communication between users and the selected RDMS is
carried out by default through a command-line interface.
However, this is not an easy way for users with poor computer skills, and we have developed a web-based interface
providing access to the data and its management (Figures
6, 7, 8, 9, 10). This user-friendly interface has a simple
usage mainly through diverse forms of the implemented

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/32

tools. Currently, the tools implemented are those to insert
(Figure 7), update (Figure 8), search (Figure 9) and delete
(Figure 10) information in the database server. Each user
needs a username and a password to access all the web
interface tools and the information system. In fact, the
username and password needed to access the web-based
interface are the same used for accessing the MySQL
RDMS through a command-line shell. This procedure
improves system security by relying on passwords on the
RDMS instead of on an external system file.
There are two ways to introduce data into the database:
users can upload a file containing all data to be inserted or
they may introduce data by filling a specific web form. The
former method is indicated when the user wants to add
many records into a database table and the later when the
number of records to insert is reasonably low. There is a
specific web form for nearly every conceptual module of
the database schema. Searches can be performed by specific web forms, as insertion tools, by entering a complex
query, that allows a wide range of options to construct an
appropriate query for the user, or obtaining reports of a
single table from the database. Reports make possible to

retrieve information already stored in each database table
without knowing exactly what to look for. Updating and
deleting data can be done only on one record at a time due
to security reasons. When using the web-based interface,
all data changes such as insertions, deletions and updates
are recorded in another database that can only be accessed
by the system administrator. This feature improves the
security of our information system and it is also distributed with this software.
When working in molecular epidemiology, the information needed to perform some studies can originate from
different sources, hospitals/health centres and laboratories. As a consequence, some inconsistencies in the data
might appear, mostly related to the limits and genotype of
sequences. To overcome this problem, we have developed
and installed some scripts in the web-based interface that
warn users about the existence of incoherent data.
Web-based interface architecture
The web interface has been developed in HTML language
and includes scripts in Javascript [12] and PHP [13], both

platform independent languages. It is accessible through
an HTTP Apache server [14].
Data security
A first level of security implemented in this software is the
identification of the user to log in. Both through the command-line shell or the web-based interface, the user must
be identified with a username and a password, both corresponding to those implemented in the local MySQL
server. A second level of security is provided by the possibility of using Views to allow different users to access and
manage different parts of the database, either by pathogen, project, or any other selective criterion. We distribute
this software both with and without this utility implemented in the web-based interface and the database
schema. With the Views utility it is possible to create more
levels of virtual tables and therefore to increase the security level as desired. A third level is a log out script implemented on the web-based interface that alerts users after
25 minutes of inactivity and automatically ends the current session 5 minutes later if inactivity continues. A
fourth level is a secondary database schema exclusively

accessed by the system administrator that stores information about whom, where and when an insertion, deletion
or update through the web-based interface was performed. A final security level for the data is a backup of the
entire database that must be performed by the local system administrator.

Results and discussion
There is a need for an information system to manage data
obtained from different molecular epidemiology studies
related to infectious pathogens. We aim to overcome this
lack in an efficient manner with our database schema and
tools software. epiPATH is an information system for
managing data about clinical and molecular information
of infectious diseases, which is available for download
and local installation, in order to help researchers in
related fields in their daily tasks in a laboratory and collaborative projects with other institutions, preserving the
information from public access given the sensitivity of the
data under analysis. We provide both the database
schema and web-based interface, with and without views

utility implemented that are available from the epiPATH
website. Additionally, a complete manual for users and
administrators and a detailed documentation of the database schema can be found at the same site.
Testing
Once the information system was implemented, we performed some tests with data from the Hepatitis C Virus
and its disease. Sequences and clinical data derived from
previous studies in our research group [15][16]. Tests
included 73 samples, 11952 viral sequences and clinical
information of 88 patients.
Usability
epiPATH is designed to be a local software for laboratories
and institutions interested in molecular epidemiology,
population genetics and evolutionary biology of infectious diseases. The database schema covers all relevant
information of these fields and becomes a very complete
and versatile tool. Due to its modular conceptual tables it
can be used in a full manner or only in those parts of

information that a researcher is actually interested in.
Being a multi-pathogen designed database, it can be used
as virtual database for a single pathogen or on a per user
basis by means of the Views utility. At the same time, it
incorporates all data in a unique schema for those cases
when multiple infections and comparisons between different pathogens are relevant, and additionally, being a
single software for many different users and projects contributes to the internal daily work and data organization
of many different institutions. The web-based interface is
a very easy-to-use tool that allows the management of
users' data stored in a local MySQL database server. The
database schema and the web-based interface of epiPATH
are open source software under the GNU license and can
be modified by end users as needed.

was performed with researchers from a molecular biology
lab (Table 2) with a very similar profile to that of the final
users of this platform.

We performed a usability test [17][18][19] with 6 participants to determine whether the design and tools implemented allow users to manage information easily through
the interface and to gather information from final users to
enhance our current version of the software. The study

Future directions
In the near future we plan to develop and integrate in the
web-based interface new and already existing analytical
tools for this kind of data in order to study thoroughly

Subjects were given a 10-minute tutorial and they were
asked to complete 5 different tasks on a test database.
Each participant was tested and recorded independently.
The main results are summarized in Table 3. All the tasks
were graded from "very easy" to "easy" on a five-level
scale. The only errors were made during the "Search" task,
a reflection of the initial difficulties of queries in the SQL
language, but, on the other hand, users also appreciated
the simplicity of forms and reports. We also received some
suggestions for improvement in future updates of the platform.
