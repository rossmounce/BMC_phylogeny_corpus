Abstract
Intense interest centers on the role of the human gut microbiome in health and disease, but optimal methods for
analysis are still under development. Here we present a study of methods for surveying bacterial communities in
human feces using 454/Roche pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene tags. We analyzed fecal samples from 10 individuals and compared methods for storage, DNA purification and sequence acquisition. To assess reproducibility, we
compared samples one cm apart on a single stool specimen for each individual. To analyze storage methods, we
compared 1) immediate freezing at -80°C, 2) storage on ice for 24 or 3) 48 hours. For DNA purification methods,
we tested three commercial kits and bead beating in hot phenol. Variations due to the different methodologies
were compared to variation among individuals using two approaches–one based on presence-absence information
for bacterial taxa (unweighted UniFrac) and the other taking into account their relative abundance (weighted UniFrac). In the unweighted analysis relatively little variation was associated with the different analytical procedures,
and variation between individuals predominated. In the weighted analysis considerable variation was associated
with the purification methods. Particularly notable was improved recovery of Firmicutes sequences using the hot
phenol method. We also carried out surveys of the effects of different 454 sequencing methods (FLX versus Titanium) and amplification of different 16S rRNA variable gene segments. Based on our findings we present recommendations for protocols to collect, process and sequence bacterial 16S rDNA from fecal samples–some major
points are 1) if feasible, bead-beating in hot phenol or use of the PSP kit improves recovery; 2) storage methods
can be adjusted based on experimental convenience; 3) unweighted (presence-absence) comparisons are less
affected by lysis method.
Background
The human microbiota is composed of a vast diversity
of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic microorganisms,
the cells of which outnumber human cells by at least a
factor of 10 [1]. The human microbiota contributes
metabolic diversity that aids in the digestion of foods
and the metabolism of drugs, promotes development of
the immune system, and competes for niches with
potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Numerous diseases are associated with alterations in the gut mirobiome, including opportunistic infections such as

C. difficile colitis and inflammatory conditions such as
Crohn’s disease. Many more diseases are suspected to
be attributable to alterations in the gut microbiome, but
definitive data are just beginning to accumulate [2-6].
Previous work has demonstrated that many factors
can influence the composition of the gut microbiota,
including diet, antibiotic use, disease states, and human
genotype [6-13]. Further complicating such studies are
uncertainties regarding how different sampling and analytical methods influence the inferred microbiome composition [8,14]. We investigate this last point here.
New deep sequencing methods provide a convenient
platform for characterizing the composition of the
human microbiota [4,7,8,13,15-19]. DNA samples are
prepared from microbial specimens, and then analyzed

using massively parallel sequencing methods such as
454/Roche pyrosequencing [20].
Here we use pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S
rRNA gene to quantify bacterial taxa [21]. The 16S
rRNA gene is comprised of highly conserved regions
interspersed with more variable regions, allowing PCR
primers to be designed that are complementary to universally conserved regions flanking variable regions.
Amplification, sequencing, and comparison to databases
allow the identification of bacterial lineages and their
proportions in a community [22,23]. Uncultured bacterial communities have been studied extensively using
Sanger sequencing to determine 16S rRNA gene
sequences, and multiple studies have helped optimize
methods [24,25]. The new deep sequencing methods
allow data to be acquired much more efficiently and
inexpensively, but optimal methods are less well developed (for some recent work in this area see [8,14,26]).
For analysis of the human gut microbiota, both fecal
samples and mucosal biopsies can be used to quantify
the bacterial taxa present. Feces have been shown to
contain a representative collection of the bacterial taxa
from the lower gastrointestinal tract, allowing convenient sampling for characterization of the gut microbiota
[5,6,27]. Linking the human microbiome to gastrointestinal disease often requires large sample sizes, so there is
a need for practical specimen acquisition methods that
allow analysis of large numbers of human subjects,
focusing attention on methods for collecting and analyzing fecal samples. For that reason, we investigated
reproducibility within a specimen, effects of storage time
and temperature, and effects of lysis and DNA purification methods on the bacterial communities detected.
Trends of interest often involve comparisons between
individuals, so the variation due to the above factors
within a specimen from a single individual was compared to the variation between subjects. We have also
compared methods for 16S rDNA gene amplification
and deep sequencing. With issues of sampling and analysis clarified, we are able to reinforce the finding that
human subjects show drastic differences in the compositions of their gut microbiomes.

(Table 2, condition 5), or placed in PSP® (Invitek) buffer
at room temperature for 48 hours and then frozen at
-80°C (Table 2, condition 6).
Cell lysis and DNA purification

Four methods were used for DNA isolation from stool.
Three commercial kits were used to isolate DNA from
fecal samples– QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit, PSP Spin
Stool DNA Plus Kit, and the MoBio Powersoil DNA Isolation Kit. DNA was also purified by a fourth particularly
harsh method in which cells were lysed by bead beating
in the presence of hot phenol and then processed with
the QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit. All samples for a single
individual were from a single piece of stool.
When compared to the QIAamp kit, the DNA yields
from the MoBio PowerSoil kit were approximately 10fold less whereas the yields were the greatest for the
PSP kit. The yield after bead beating in hot phenol was
comparable to that obtained from the standard QIAamp
DNA Stool Minikit isolation. With the QIAamp kit,
yields were not affected by different storage methods.

Sample acquisition and storage

To compare methods for fecal storage and DNA preparation, ten participants were enrolled and studied, of
whom 40% were female and 30% were African American
(Table 1). Each participant provided a single stool specimen that was sampled multiple times and then used for
DNA extraction. Samples were processed immediately
(Table 2, condition 8) or were first frozen at -80°C
(Table 2, conditions 1-3, 7 and 9), placed on ice for 24
hours and then frozen at -80°C (Table 2, condition 4),

454/Roche pyrosequence analysis

To compare how 16S rRNA gene sequence recovery was
affected by storage and purification methods, total DNA
from stool samples was PCR amplified using primers
targeting regions flanking the variable regions 1 through
2 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V1-2), gel purified,
and analyzed using the 454/Roche GS FLX technology.
The V1-2 region was chosen based on published simulations [25]. Each primer set used for PCR amplification

also contained an eight base DNA bar code that indexed
each subject, storage method, and DNA purification
method [28-30]. PCR products were pooled, and a total
of 473,169 sequence reads of average length 260 bases
with correct bar codes and primer sequences were
obtained for 57 samples (Additional File 1).
Subsequent analysis was carried out using the QIIME
pipeline [31,32]. The pipeline takes in bar coded
sequence reads, separates them into individual communities by bar code, and utilizes a suite of external programs to make taxonomic assignments (e. g. RDP [23])
and estimate phylogenetic diversity. These data are used
to generate taxonomic summaries and as input to UniFrac cluster analysis (described below) [33,34].
Bacterial taxa detected

Figure 1 shows the bacterial taxa detected summarized
as a heat map. The most abundant genera are shown
together with their Phylum-level assignments. For each
subject, two identically processed samples taken 1 cm
apart are shown (methods 1 and 2 in Table 2). Overall
there is good reproducibility between the two adjacent
“gold standard” samples–of the taxa present as greater
than 1% of the total, all were detected in the paired
sample. However, low abundance taxa were detected
sporadically–of the samples present at 0.2%-0.4% of the
total in one replicate (red in Figure 1), 35% were not
detected in the second replicate. Statistical tests for significant differences are described below.
Communities were dominated by members of the Bacteriodetes and Firmicute phyla, with lower amounts of
Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and others, as has been
reported previously [5,6,27]. Pronounced differences
among the subjects were evident–for example, Fusobacteria were particularly abundant in Subject 1003.
Bacterial taxa recovered using the different storage and
DNA isolation procedures

The bacterial taxa recovered using the different methods
are summarized in Figure 2. For each panel, all samples

were pooled for subjects analyzed using each of the
methods. Replicate samples (Table 2, methods 1 and 2)
are included in each panel to show variation within biological replicates. Figure 2A shows that bead-beating in
phenol (Table 2, method 9) led to improved recovery of
some Firmicutes compared to the Qiagen method. Figure 2B shows that results were more similar between
the MoBio method and the Qiagen method, though
some differences were detected. Figure 2C shows that
most of the storage methods yielded indistinguishable
results, at least for proportional recovery within the
major groups. Storage in PSP (Figure 2D) was associated
increased proportions of several Firmicutes, though the
increase was not as pronounced as with the phenol and
beat-beating method. For both the phenol/bead-beating
and PSP methods, the Bacteriodetes declined in abundance, likely because of the proportional increase in Firmicutes. Thus storage method had little effect, but use
of phenol bead-beating or PSP led to increased recovery
of some Firmicutes.
UniFrac cluster analysis

We next sought to investigate the significance of the differences observed. In many studies of human subjects
the question of interest centers on whether a biological
factor (disease state, treatment, host genotype etc.)
results in a measurable difference on a gut bacterial
community against the background of the naturally
occurring differences among humans. We thus asked
whether the effects of the sample storage and DNA isolation methods were discernable against the background
of variation among subjects.
The 16S rRNA gene sequence reads from the 57 communities were aligned to generate a phylogenetic tree
using FastTree2 [35]. Communities were then compared
in a pair-wise fashion by means of the UniFrac distance
metric, which quantifies the proportion of the branch
length on the tree unique to each community in each
pair. Pairwise UniFrac distances were used to generate a
matrix of all distances between pairs of communities,

heat map at the Phylum and Genus level except in cases where small numbers were detected (e. g. Proteobacteria), in which case taxa are
summarized at higher levels. The relative abundance of each bacterial group is color coded as indicated by the key on the left (the number
beside each colored tile indicates the lower bound for the indicated interval). Two samples were compared for each stool specimen, sampled
on cm a part but otherwise worked up identically (conditions 1 and 2 in Table 2). The numbers of reads for the two samples from each subject
were compared for significant differences using Fisher’s exact test. The * indicates P < 0.05. Note that because each sequence read is treated as
an individual measurement, the sample size is very large, with the result that many taxa with only modest differences nevertheless achieve
significance.

and principal coordinate analysis used for the cluster
analysis (Figures 3 and 4). All steps were carried out in
an automated fashion within QIIME [36]. UniFrac analysis was carried out either unweighted, using only presence-absence information, or weighted, which takes in
to account the relative proportions of each group.
The UniFrac distances matrices were first used to test
for significant differences between “gold standard” samples (taken 1 cm apart on a single piece of stool). We
tested the difference between pairs using distance based
NP-MANOVA, which yielded p = 0.085 for unweighted
UniFrac and p = 0.197 for weighted UniFrac. Thus the
two gold standards were not significantly different.
Figure 3A shows the unweighted UniFrac analysis
colored to distinguish communities from the 10

individuals studied. Figure 3B shows the same scatter
plot colored by storage method, and Figure 3C shows
the plot colored by extraction method. The data emphasizes that individuals differ substantially from each
other, and that storage and extraction methods have less
pronounced effects. Also present in each individual cluster are the two replicates from 1 cm apart, emphasizing
the reproducibility of the method. Statistical analysis
was carried out by asking whether unweighted UniFrac
distances were greater within groups than between
groups, then 10,000 label permutations were used to
generate an empirical P-value. Clustering by subject was
highly significant (P < 0.0001). No significance was seen
for clustering by extraction method (P = 0.16) or storage
method (P = 0.98). We conclude that overall clustering,

when analyzed for presence or absence of different bacterial groups, is dominated by differences between
individuals.
Figure 4 shows the weighted UniFrac analysis, which
takes into account information on relative abundance,
comparing the influence of individual of origin (Figure
4A), extraction method (Figure 4B), or storage method
(Figure 4C). Again the differences among subjects were
highly significant (P < 0.0001), but now the differences

due to extraction methods were also significant (P =
0.001). Differences due to storage method were not significant. Thus when the proportional representation of
different taxa is taken in to account, both the subject of
origin and the extraction method exert significant
effects.
We next investigated whether significant clustering
could be detected when each extraction method was
compared individually to the collection of other

extraction methods. Again UniFrac distances were analyzed for within group and between group comparisons,
and an empirical P-value generated from 10,000 permutations. No significant clustering was seen in the
unweighted analysis. However, using weighted UniFrac
significant clustering was seen for the phenol-bead beating method (P = 0.041) and the Qiagen method (P =
0.0014). The strong effect of the Qiagen method was
driven in part by the fact that the most samples were
analyzed using the Qiagen method, so the sample size
was relatively large. Comparison of each method to the
two gold standards using NP-MANOVA showed that
the phenol bead beating and PSP methods both
achieved p = 0.001. Given the significant differences for
these methods, we investigated which taxa were most
strongly affected, and found that in both cases the
recovery of Firmicutes was increased while the recovery
of Bacteriodetes was decreased (asterisks in Figure 2A
and 2D), possibly a result of improved lysis of Firmicutes with these methods (discussed below).
Comparison of the 454 GS FLX versus 454 Titanium
sequencing methods and the effect of 16S rRNA gene
region sequenced

454/Roche recently introduced Titanium chemistry,
which results in longer sequence reads than the GS FLX
method (~450 nt versus ~260 nt). We thus wished to
compare the results of taxonomic assignments for the
same samples using the two methods. Two of the DNA
specimens analyzed above were resequenced using the
Titanium chemistry and results compared by compiling
the proportions of all taxa (Figure 5A-C).
Analysis of longer 16S rRNA gene region also necessitated use of different primer pairs to amplify longer segments of the 16S rRNA gene. Several regions of the
bacterial 16S rRNA gene are highly conserved, and multiple different primer sets have been used in published
studies [4,16-18,37]. Previous literature has shown that
16S PCR amplification can be biased [24], so we sought
to analyze this point in the context of 454/Roche pyrosequencing. To analyze the importance of primer choice
for 454 Titanium pyrosequencing, we compared six primer sets, which amplified the 16S gene variable regions
V1-3, V3-5, and V6-9. For each primer pair, two slightly
different sequences were used. All reads were from right
to left as drawn in Figure 5C, with dark gray indicating
the region of sequence determination. A total of 295,946
sequence reads were used to characterize the different
primers (Additional File 2). The GS FLX primers used
for comparison amplified the V1-V2 region. Primer
sequences are compiled in Additional File 3.
In general, communities subjected to Titanium
sequencing after amplification with the V1-V3 and V3V5 regions resembled communities analyze with GS

Page 8 of 14

FLX sequencing after amplification with the V1-V2
region (Figure 5A). The communities recovered with
Titanium sequencing after V6-V9 primer amplification
were the most discordant. The V6-V9 primers consistently showed the lowest percentage of taxonomic
assignments at the genus level (Figure 5B). We note that
our choice of V6-V9 primer and sequencing direction
did not cover the V6 regions efficiently, so results from
others focusing on the V6 region specifically may differ
from those reported here. Our data indicates that when
pooling data from many experiments for meta-analysis,
complications may arise when mixing V6-V9 data with
data from other 16S rRNA gene regions. In this study,
we also compared the effects of 20 versus 30 PCR cycles
and the effects of PCR product purification using gels or
binding to and elution from beads. Both were found to
have little effect on the results (Additional File 2 and
analysis not shown).
Comparison of recovery of 10 cloned 16S rRNA gene
sequences after 454/Roche pyrosequencing

One question in analyzing microbial communities by
16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing centers on whether the
amplification and sequencing methods result in recovery
of sequences in proportion to their representation in the
original community [24]. As a first step in addressing
this issue, we prepared and analyzed a mock DNA community composed of ten bacterial plasmids encoding
near full length 16S rRNA gene fragments. The mixture
was PCR amplified using primers that amplified the V1V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and sequences were
acquired using the GS FLX technology. Sequences were
acquired for both an even mixture of the ten plasmids,
and a staggered mixture (a total of 28,161 sequence
reads; Additional File 4).
Figure 6A shows the distribution of sequences. In the
even mixture, all ten sequences were recovered in
roughly equal proportions, and the staggered communities showed differential recoveries in the expected
directions. The two staggered mock communities were
sequenced after amplification with two different DNA
polymerase mixtures (GreenTaq and AmpliTaq), which
did not result in major differences. Figure 6B compares
the input and observed proportions for both the even
and staggered communities, showing that recovery was
close to the input proportions (P < 0.0001). Thus we
conclude that the pyrosequencing procedure used here
resulted in proportions of sequence reads that closely
matched the known input when cloned 16S rRNA genes
are used as PCR templates.

Discussion
Many studies have linked the composition and dynamics
of the human microbiome with health and disease.

Because of the immense differences in the gut microbiome among individuals, large sample sizes are often
needed to correlate microbiome composition with biological variables such as disease states [4,5,7,27,38]. We
have thus conducted a detailed investigation of methods
for sampling and analyzing fecal microbiome samples,

with the goal of identifying optimal methods for analyzing large numbers of samples. We studied the following
issues: 1) methods for storing feces prior to analysis,
which is critical to the feasibility of sample collection on
a large scale; 2) the effects of DNA purification from
feces by different methods; 3) the effects of sequence

analysis using shorter versus longer pyrosequence reads
(454/Roche GS FLX standard versus Titanium chemistry); 4) the influence of amplicons querying different
variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene; and 5) the efficiency of recovery of different 16S rRNA gene sequences
from a cloned 16S rRNA gene mock community. Our
findings allow us to make several recommendations for
analysis of the gut microbiome.
We stored replicate samples on ice for various times
prior to freezing or at room temperature in PSP, then
compared their composition to replicates that were
immediately frozen (our “gold standard”). Storage on ice
for up to 48 hours prior to freezing did not result in
detectable differences in bacterial communities as compared to immediately frozen gold standard samples.
Slight differences were seen between replicated gold

standard samples, which could be due either to variations introduced during sample workup and analysis or
geographic variations in the composition of the stool
specimen itself. The PSP method has several advantages,
including storage of fecal specimens at room temperature for up to 48 hours, the use of a self-contained storage and isolation tubes, and a greater DNA yield than
other isolation methods. No method of storage correlated with communities that showed a statistically significant difference in composition from the collection of
communities from each subject. We thus propose that
the fecal storage method used may be chosen based on
convenience of sample collection.
In contrast, the method used for DNA isolation did
have a significant effect. The phenol-bead beating and
PSP methods led to recovery of a greater proportion of

Wu et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:206
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/206

Firmicutes, as shown by the weighted UniFrac analysis.
The unweighted analysis, based on presence-absence
information only, did not show a significant difference,
indicating that the alterations were in proportions of
bacterial taxa detected, and not their presence or
absence (at least at the sampling depth used here). This
emphasizes that where possible it is attractive to use
unweighted analysis of bacterial communities, since this
is less sensitive to details of the methods used for DNA
isolation. We speculate that the phenol-bead beating
and PSP methods led to improved lysis of bacteria with
tough cell walls (the name “Firmicute” is derived from
firmus for strong and cutis for skin).
In additional analyses, we showed that use of the 454
GS FLX versus the Titanium sequencing method did
not strongly affect the conclusions. Previous literature
has established that amplification of 16S rDNA gene
fragments can be biased [24], so we sought to analyze
this point in the context of 454/Roche pyrosequencing
because there has been some controversy on optimal
regions [8,14,23,25,37]. We did find that the choice of
16S rRNA gene region used for analysis had a noticeable
effect, with the V6-V9 region representing an outlier. In
the primer study our sample size was smaller than for
studies of stool storage and DNA isolation, so we can
only comment on possible trends in the primer test
data. The V6-V9 set yielded the lowest proportion of
calls at the genus level, though proportions were similar
to other sets at higher taxonomic levels. Our selection
of primers and sequencing direction resulted in incomplete coverage of the V6 region, possibly explaining
poor performance by this amplicon (though see also
[23,39]).
The results with the cloned DNA mock community
were encouraging, showing roughly proportional recovery of the mixed 16S rRNA gene plasmid sequences
over a wide range of relative abundance, though we
note that the range of abundance of bacteria in stool
may be even greater. This supports the idea that the
sequencing method used is suitable for quantifying the
composition of complex bacterial communities, but
some caution is warranted. It will be useful to compare
mock DNA communities made from genomic DNA specimens rather than plasmids containing cloned 16S
rRNA gene sequences, and also mock communities of
whole organisms. It may well be more difficult to obtain
proportional representation in more demanding tests.

Conclusions
Based on the data presented in this report we can make
the following recommendations for studying the gut
microbiome from human fecal samples via deep sequencing. i) The fecal storage method can be chosen based
on experimental convenience, because different storage

Page 11 of 14

methods had little effect on the variations in community
composition compared to the variation between individuals. ii) The DNA isolation method used did have a
strong effect, with the phenol-bead beating and PSP
methods constituting outliers. Thus we suggest that
where possible communities should be compared where
either all were purified using phenol-bead beating or
PSP, or all were purified using one of the other methods. In cases where it is important to know the exact
proportions of Firmicutes, it may be best to use the phenol-bead beating or PSP methods. iii) Use of either 454
GS FLX or 454 Titanium yielded similar patterns dominated by the subject of origin, so either sequencing
method can be used depending again on convenience.
iv) When carrying out comparisons among multiple
data sets it is important to be aware of differences
among primer regions, and if possible to avoid mixing
data from the v6-v9 region with data from other regions.
v) The differences among subjects was the most prominent source of variation among communities. Consequently, any attempt to detect the effects of additional
factors on microbiome composition, such as disease
state, diet, drug use, etc., will need to take in to account
the substantial variation among individuals.

Methods
Sample collection

Ten healthy adult volunteers (at least 18 years old) were
recruited to provide a single stool sample within the
Center for Clinical and Translational Research at the
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Exclusion
criteria included having had diarrhea within one week
prior to the sample collection, consumption of any antibiotics within four weeks prior to sample collection, or
any prior diagnosis with inflammatory bowel disease,
irritable bowel syndrome, celiac sprue, or other chronic
inflammatory diseases of the intestines.
After providing informed consent, each participant
completed a brief survey describing their medical history
and demographic characteristics. Each participant provided a single stool specimen. All specimens were collected using a collection hat that separated the fecal
content from urine or the toilet water.
From the specimen provided, a research coordinator
immediately removed six samples from the surface of
the specimen. Samples 2 through 6 were obtained to be
at least 1 cm away from the location of the first sample.
All samples were collected in a Faeces Container with
Screw Cap (Cat#80.734.001, Sarstedt, Newton, NC) and
the sample was leveled with a wooden spatula. The first
three samples were placed in empty vials and immediately stored at -80°C. Two specimens were placed in
empty tubes and stored in a Styrofoam cooler filled with
ice packs. These specimens were transferred to a -80°C

Wu et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:206
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/206

freezer after 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively. The
final sample was placed in a vial filled with stool stabilizer from the PSP SPIN Stool DNA Plus kit (Invitek).
The specimen was shaken but the specimen was not
fully dissolved into the stabilizer solution. After 48
hours of storage at room temperature, the specimen was
transferred to a -80°C freezer. Three patients had an
extra sample collected and processed immediately.
Storage times at -80°C ranged from 0-137 days; time of
storage at -80°C had no discernable effect on the
sequencing results.
The consistency of the stool sample was characterized
using the Bristol Stool Scale [40].
DNA isolation, PCR amplification, and amplicon
purification

DNA was isolated from approximately 200 mg of stool
using three different commercially-available kits:
QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit (Cat#51504, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), PSP Spin Stool DNA Plus Kit (Cat#10381102,
Invitek, Berlin, Germany), MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Cat#12888-05, Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad,
CA), all of which are widely used in microbiome studies.
DNA was isolated exactly as per the manufactures’
instructions for both the QIAamp and PSP kits except
for a 95°C lysis incubation for 5 minutes, instead of the
70°C recommended for the QIAamp kit. For isolation
using the Mo Bio kit, the stool sample was vortexed to
homogeneity in 1 ml of Mo Bio Lysis Buffer, centrifuged
at 1500 rcf for 5 minutes at room temperature. The
supernatant was then transferred to the Mo Bio PowerBead tube, incubated for 10 minutes at 65°C, then 95°C
for an additional 10 minutes, followed by gentle vortexing to disperse the sample in the PowerBead solution.
DNA was then isolated as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
For the phenol/bead beating method, the protocol
consisted of a re-suspension/disruption and lysis step
that was performed prior to purification using the
QIAamp Stool Kit. The frozen stool sample was placed
within a MoBio 0.7 mm garnet bead tube (Cat# 1312350 Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA), to which 0.5 ml
of Tris equilibrated (pH 8.0) Phenol: Chloroform: IsoAmyl alcohol (25:24:1) (Cat# P3803, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) was added, and the remaining volume was
filled up with buffer ASL from the QIAamp Stool Kit
(approximately 0.9 ml). The sample was mechanically
disrupted by bead beating using a MiniBeadBeater-16
(Cat# 607, Biospec, Bartlesville, OK) for 1 minute. The
resulting homogenate was incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes and centrifuged at 13000G for 1 minute to separate
the aqueous and phenolic phases. The aqueous phase
was transferred to a new 2 ml microcentrifure tube and
the volume was completed to 1.2 ml with buffer ASL.

Page 12 of 14

One QIAamp Stool Kit inhibitX tablet was added to this
lysate and homogenized according to manufacturer specifications. The remaining of the procedure was followed
according to the QIAamp Stool Kit pathogen detection
protocol.
After quantification by spectrophotometry, 100 ng of
DNA was amplified with barcoded primers using 2.5
units of AmpliTaq (Cat# N8080161, ABI, Foster City,
CA) in a reaction buffer containing 25 mM MgCl2, 1%
Triton, 10 mM dNTPs, and 10 mg/ml BSA (Cat
#B90015, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) [18]. PCR
was performed on an ABI 2720 Thermocycler using the
following conditions: Initial denaturing at 95°C for 5
minutes followed by 20 cycles of 95°C × 30 seconds, 56°
C × 30 seconds, and 72°C × 1 minute 30 seconds. The
reaction was terminated after an 8 minute extension at
72°C. The amplicons from each DNA sample, which
was amplified in quadruplicate, were pooled and gel
purified using an 0.8% agarose gel and a QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Cat# 28704, Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Defined DNA community composition

Two defined DNA mixture were created using 10 different plasmids, each containing a near full length 16S
rDNA amplicon, obtained using primers BSF8 and
BSR1541. One mixture had an equal amount of each
plasmid and one was staggered to contain different proportions of each clone. The strains and proportions on
the Staggered mix are: Clostridium dificile (ATCC#:
BAA-1382) - 39.99%, Bacteroides fragilis (ATCC#:
25285) - 32.01%, Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC#:
BAA_334) - 4.92%, Desulfovibrio vulgaris (ATCC#:
29579) - 1.95%, Campylobacter jejunii (ATCC#: 700819)
- 2.03%, Rhizobium vitis (ATCC#: BAA_846) - 2.00%,
Lactobacillus delbruekii (ATCC#: BAA-365) - 5.06%,
Escherichia coli HB101 - 2.01%, Treponema sp. (macaque stool clone) - 7.97%, and Nitrosomonas sp. (environmental clone) - 2.04%. Clones were made using the
Topo-XL kit (Cat# K4700-20, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Two polymerases were tested for the Staggered mix,
AmpliTaq (as used for stool DNA samples) and GreenTaq (Promega, Madison, WI) as per manufacturer
instructions. The PCR cycling conditions were the same
as described for the stool sample DNA.
454/Roche sequencing methods

Purified amplicon DNAs were quantified using QuantiT PicoGreen kit (cat# P7589, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
and pooled for pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing using
the 454/Roche GS FLX chemistry was carried out
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pyrosequencing using the Titanium method was carried out
using the Titanium genomic kit. Primers for PCR

amplification of rDNA gene segments are in Additional
File 3. The rDNA region amplified with V1-V2 primers
used for FLX sequencing is contained within the regions
amplified with the V1-V3 primers used for Titanium
sequencing.
Pyrosequence reads were uploaded into QIIME and
processed as described (Caporaso et al., 2010). Briefly,
QIIME accepts as input bar coded 16S rRNA gene
sequences, classifies them using the RDP classifier [23],
aligns them using Pynast [31], constructs phylogenetic
trees using FastTree2, calculates UniFrac distances, and
generates data summaries of the proportions of taxa
present and PCoA plots based on UniFrac distances. We
used 97% OTUs in the analysis. For the RDP classifier,
we required >50% confidence for all calls.
Accession numbers for sequences determined here are
in Additional File 5.
Statistical methods

Clinical characteristics were compared as median, range,
counts and percentages. For analysis in Figures 1 and 2,
no corrections for multiple comparisons were applied.
UniFrac [33,34,41] was used to generate distances
between all pairs of communities; both weighted and
unweighted UniFrac were used in the analyses. Statistical analysis was carried out by comparing distances
within groups to distances between groups. Comparisons were summarized using the t-statistic and significance assessed using 10,000 label permutations.
Clustering was visualized for weighted and unweighted
UniFrac data using principal coordinates analysis.
We use the distance based Permutational Multivariate
Analysis of Variance (NPMANOVA) to perform overall
test of the difference between the two gold standards
(samples taken 1 cm apart from the same piece of stool)
and between gold standards and other sampling methods using both the weighted and unweighted UniFrac
distance matrix. If the overall test gave significant
results, then we used signed rank test on the proportion
data to pinpoint the taxonomic groups that showed
significant differences in abundance between the two
sampling methods.
