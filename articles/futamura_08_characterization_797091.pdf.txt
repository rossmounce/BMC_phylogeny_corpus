Abstract
Background: Cryptomeria japonica D. Don is one of the most commercially important conifers in
Japan. However, the allergic disease caused by its pollen is a severe public health problem in Japan.
Since large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the male strobili of C. japonica should
help us to clarify the overall expression of genes during the process of pollen development, we
constructed a full-length enriched cDNA library that was derived from male strobili at various
developmental stages.
Results: We obtained 36,011 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from either one or both ends of
19,437 clones derived from the cDNA library of C. japonica male strobili at various developmental
stages. The 19,437 cDNA clones corresponded to 10,463 transcripts. Approximately 80% of the
transcripts resembled ESTs from Pinus and Picea, while approximately 75% had homologs in
Arabidopsis. An analysis of homologies between ESTs from C. japonica male strobili and known
pollen allergens in the Allergome Database revealed that products of 180 transcripts exhibited
significant homology. Approximately 2% of the transcripts appeared to encode transcription
factors. We identified twelve genes for MADS-box proteins among these transcription factors. The
twelve MADS-box genes were classified as DEF/GLO/GGM13-, AG-, AGL6-, TM3- and TM8-like
MIKCC genes and type I MADS-box genes.
Conclusion: Our full-length enriched cDNA library derived from C. japonica male strobili provides
information on expression of genes during the development of male reproductive organs. We
provided potential allergens in C. japonica. We also provided new information about transcription
factors including MADS-box genes expressed in male strobili of C. japonica. Large-scale gene
discovery using full-length cDNAs is a valuable tool for studies of gymnosperm species.

Background
Molecular studies of angiosperm model plants have identified large numbers of genes that are expressed during stamen and pollen development. Genetic analyses have
revealed the roles of some of these genes in the specification of stamen identity, the regulation of anther cell division and the differentiation of anthers, the control of male
meiosis, the development of pollen, and anther dehiscence [1]. Pollen development in gymnosperms and
angiosperms involves several similar developmental and
physiological processes [2,3]. Homologs to floral transcription factors in angiosperms have been isolated from
gymnosperm strobili and characterized. For example, the
B-class MADS-box genes, which in angiosperms determine petal and stamen identities, and C-class genes that
control the identities of stamens and carpels have been
identified in conifers [4-7]. The Norway spruce gene
DAL1, belongs to the AGL6 subfamily and DAL10,
belongs to gymnosperm-specific subgroup were identified
as other MADS-box genes in conifers [8,9]. The flowering
time gene, SOC1 and LEAFY, and A class gene APETALA2
have also been identified [10-13]. However, available
information about transcripts that are expressed in the
male reproductive structures of the gymnosperms is still
limited [14].
The gymnosperm Cryptomeria is a monoecious plant that
is distributed throughout Japan and in some parts of
China. Cryptomeria japonica D. Don is widely grown in
Japan because of its high productivity and utility. This species comprises 18% of the forests and covers 12% of the
landmass of Japan. However, allergic reactions to its pollen have become a severe public health problem in Japan.
A recent nationwide epidemiological survey found that at
least 13% of the Japanese population suffers from pollinosis due to pollen of C. japonica [15].
The male strobili of C. japonica develop in axils of small
branches near the tips of these branches. The primordia of
male strobili are initiated from June to August and first
become visible from July to September under natural conditions [16,17]. The development of strobili can also be
initiated by treatment with gibberellic acid (GA3). The
promotion of flower formation by exogenous GA3 occurs
even in one-year-old seedlings in spite of the fact that formation of strobili usually requires around 20 years after
germination under natural conditions [16]. Meiosis of
microsporocytes begins in the middle of October, and
microspores are formed from late October to late November. Differentiation of generative cells and tube cells
occurs in December. The staminate strobili then remain in
an arrested state of development until the following
March when pollen grains are released. Each male strobilus is oval, pale yellow, and close to 5 mm in length and
2 mm in diameter, and each consists of microsporophylls

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/383

attached to a main axis. Three to five rounded microsporangia develop on the lower surface of each microsporophyll. Each microsporangium contains 3,000 or more
pollen grains, and as many as 400,000 pollen grains may
be produced in a single strobilus [16].
Large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
should help us to clarify the overall expression of genes in
the male strobili of C. japonica. Some ESTs have already
been derived from male strobili and from the pollen of C.
japonica [18,19]. However, the numbers of ESTs were relatively small, namely, 739 from male strobili and 3,655
from pollen, and most isolated cDNAs were not fulllength. In the present study, we constructed a full-length
enriched cDNA library using RNA derived from male strobili at various developmental stages, and we obtained
more than 30,000 ESTs. We performed sequence-similarity searches using TBLASTX and BLASTX to compare the
ESTs from C. japonica male strobili to sequences in UniProt, amino acid sequences from Arabidopsis and rice
(Oryza sativa L.), and EST sequences from poplar, spruce
and pine. We also identified ESTs that encoded MADSbox genes, which play a variety of important developmental roles in plants. In this report, we discuss both the utility
of full-length cDNAs for gene discovery and the characterization of MADS-box genes in C. japonica.

Results
Construction and quality check of a full-length enriched
cDNA library
We constructed a full-length enriched cDNA library from
male strobili of C. japonica at various stages of development. The mean length of the insert DNA derived from 91
randomly selected clones was approximately 1.6 kbp. We
picked up 19,968 clones (clone IDs: CMFL001_A1
through CMFL052_N24) at random and sequenced them
from their 5' and 3' ends. In total, 39,936 sequences were
obtained and processed for removal of vector sequences,
low-quality data and contamination by genomic DNA
from E. coli. We retained 36,011 ESTs, which encompassed 18,843 sequences of 5' ends and 17,168 sequences
of 3' ends derived from 19,437 clones. Each EST consisted
of at least 100 contiguous nucleotides with a PHRED score
greater than 20 (Table 1; Additional file 1). The average
sequenced length of the ESTs was 517 bp. All sequences
have been deposited in the dbEST division of DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank. The accession number of each EST is
shown in Additional file 1.

We analyzed the full-length cDNA clones that included
sites for the initiation of transcription of mRNA. An additional G at the 5' end is observed in many full-length
cDNAs that are obtained by the biotinylated CAP trapper
method, which we used in this study [20]. Among the 5'
sequence in our cDNA library derived from C. japonica

and singlets were grouped using the BLASTN program and
then both 5'- and 3'- end sequences derived from the respective same
clones were grouped together.

male strobili, 16,977 (90%) had G at the 5' end (Table 2).
The high percentage of cDNA clones with G at the 5' terminus suggests that the relative level of full-length cDNA
clones in our library was high. The second nucleotide
showed a strong bias towards purines (89% A or G; Table
2). This observation is consistent with the fact that transcription usually starts at a purine in Arabidopsis and rice
[21]. Subsequent positions did not show such an extreme
bias towards purines. Our results suggest that most fulllength cDNAs had one additional G at their 5' termini.
To confirm the addition of G at the 5' end of full-length
cDNA clones, we compared the 5'-terminal sequences of
cDNA clones that encoded Cry j 2 with genomic
sequences, including the promoter and coding region of
Cry j 2, that we determined in a previous study [22]. We
found seven clones that encoded Cry j 2 among the 5'-end
sequences of 18,843 clones. All seven of them were 5'extended cDNAs, as compared with three Cry j 2 cDNAs
that we generated previously [22]. Five of the seven had
one G, one clone had two Gs and one clone had TG at its
5' terminus; these nucleotides were not present in the corresponding region of Cry j 2 genes (data not shown). The
comparison between these seven cDNAs and Cry j 2 genes

indicated that full-length cDNAs had one or two additional nucleotides at their 5' termini, with most clones
having a single G.
We performed a BLASTX comparison of amino acids
encoded by 5'-terminal sequences of 18,843 cDNA clones
and proteins from Arabidopsis. Our analysis revealed that
9,208 ESTs (48.7%) exhibited strong homology to Arabidopsis proteins (E-value < 1e-20). Among these ESTs, the
starting positions in the alignment of 7,480 clones
(81.2%) were upstream of the initiation codon of the corresponding protein. We also performed a BLASTN comparison with nucleotide sequences of protein-coding
regions in Arabidopsis. We found that 2,131 ESTs (11.5%)
derived from 5'-terminal sequences of cDNAs exhibited
strong homology (E-value < 1e-10) to protein-coding
regions in the Arabidopsis genome. The starting positions
in the alignment of 1,755 ESTs (82.4%) were upstream of
the corresponding coding region of Arabidopsis. These
results suggest that most of our cDNA clones are fulllength cDNAs.
Classification of ESTs
The assembly of ESTs can be expected to generate an overestimate of the actual number of genes represented since
failure of ESTs to assemble can result from alternate splicing, differences in usage of polyadenylation sites,
sequence polymorphism, and sequencing errors. Levels of
redundancy after EST assembly have been estimated to
range from 20% to 22% in previous studies of EST collections [23,24]. To reduce redundancy, we compared all
consensus sequences (7,686 tentative contigs and 15,972
singletons) using BLASTN after assembly with PHRAP and
then we grouped both 5'- and 3'-end sequences derived
from the same respective clones together. Finally, our
analysis indicated that ESTs derived from 19,437 clones
could be grouped into 10,463 clusters as unique transcripts (Table 1; Additional file 1). The largest cluster contained 35 clones, but only 26 transcripts (0.25%)
corresponded to more than 10 clones. We found that
6,320 of the 10,463 transcripts (60.4%) corresponded to
only one clone and 2,078 clusters (19.9%) corresponded
to two clones. The normalization step appeared to reduce
the redundancy of our ESTs. Mitochondrial and chloro-

plast RNA sequences were not filtered, but they contributed one and three clones to the data set of 19,437 cDNA
clones, respectively. No contamination by ribosomal RNA
was detected in the data set. Figure 1 shows the functional
classification of the putative proteins encoded by our
ESTs, which was based on assignments in the COG database [25]. Of the putative proteins derived from individual transcripts, 7,339 (70.1%) were assigned to 26
putative functional categories by BLASTX (E-value < 1e-5;
Additional file 2).
Sequence comparisons with other species
We found that 8,059 (77.0%) of the 10,463 transcripts
encoded peptides that were significantly similar to those
in the UniProt database, 7,840 (74.9%) were similar to
proteins in Arabidopsis, and 7,455 (71.3%) were similar to
proteins in japonica rice at a BLASTX E-value of 1e-5 (Figure 2). When we compared our ESTs with sequences of
ESTs from Pinus, Picea and Populus by TBLASTX, we found
that 8,433 (80.6%), 8,400 (80.3%) and 7,763 (74.2%)
transcripts included similar ESTs, respectively, at E-values
of 1e-5. A larger overlap was found in the case of coniferous species (Figure 2). We also compared the 10,463 transcripts examined in the present study with ESTs that had
been previously isolated from C. japonica, which included
10,328 ESTs derived from cambium and surrounding tissues, 3,677 ESTs from pollen, 3,222 ESTs from male strobili and 1,889 ESTs from other organs [19,26]. Slightly
more than half (5,792; 55.4%) of our transcripts did not
exhibit any similarity (BLASTN Evalue < 1e-10) to ESTs
that had been previously isolated from C. japonica. Thus,
the ESTs described in the present report contain novel
information about protein-coding regions of the C.
japonica genome.

Functional analysis
We analyzed conserved domains using Pfam [27] as a
database to predict the function of products of C. japonica
transcripts. Overall, we found that 5,304 (50.7%) of the
10,463 transcripts encoded proteins similar to members
of 1,664 Pfam protein families (E-value < 1e-10). Among
these Pfam families, 147 families are denoted "DUF,
Domain of Unknown Function" and 26 families are
denoted "UPF, Uncharacterized Protein Family". In total,
products of 4,965 (47.5%) of the transcripts from C.
japonica male strobili were similar to members of 1,481
Pfam families when DUFs and UPFs were excluded. We
found that 4,850 (46.3%) transcripts belonged to only
one Pfam family, 433 (4.1%) transcripts belonged to two
families, 17 transcripts (0.16%) belonged to three families, and two transcripts (0.02%) belonged to four families (Additional file 2). The most abundant protein
families in male strobili of C. japonica corresponded to
those most strongly represented in the genome of Arabidopsis (Table 3). Similar earlier analyses indicated that
these domains occur frequently in sugarcane and white
spruce also [23,28].
Similarity of products of ESTs to stamen- or male
gametophyte-specific proteins of Arabidopsis
We compared our deduced proteins with stamen and
male gametophyte-specific proteins in Arabidopsis. Referring to previous studies of Arabidopsis, we identified
amino acid sequences encoded by 1,145 stamen-specific
transcripts and by 1,274 male gametophyte-specific transcripts in the Arabidopsis database [29,30]. We found that
754 (65.9%) stamen-specific transcripts and 617 (48.4%)
male gametophyte-specific transcripts of Arabidopsis
resembled 509 and 429 transcripts, respectively, from
male strobili of C. japonica, at a TBLASTX E-value of 1e-10
(Additional files 3 and 4). Table 4 shows the Pfam
domains that are found in stamen- and male gametophyte-specific genes of Arabidopsis and the numbers of
transcripts that correspond to the families of genes in
male strobili of C. japonica. Our results suggest that
homologs of stamen- and pollen-specific transcripts of
Arabidopsis are expressed in the male strobili of C. japonica.
Similarity of the deduced proteins to pollen allergens
We compared the peptides encoded by all the ESTs with
known plant allergens in Allergome [31]. Table 5 shows a
list of pollen allergens that are similar to the deduced proteins encoded by ESTs derived from C. japonica male strobili. Proteins encoded by 180 transcripts (1.7%) exhibited
partial sequence homology to plant allergens, which
included known allergens of C. japonica. This result suggests the possibility that unidentified allergens in C.
japonica might exist in our EST collection.

families were identified by BLASTX searches with an E-value < 1e-10 in the Pfam database.
families were assigned on the basis of data in TAIR.

Families of putative transcription factors
Transcription factors play important roles in the formation of floral tissues throughout organogenesis. To identify transcription factors, we first identified 37 Pfam
domains that encode transcription factors by comparing
data in the AtTFDB (Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor database) [32] with the domain annotations of Arabidopsis proteins. As a result of a search for sequence
similarity between ESTs from C. japonica male strobili and
the 37 identified Pfam domains, we identified a total of
207 (2.0%) unique transcripts that encoded putative transcription factors, which could be assigned to 29 protein
families (Table 6). Transcripts whose products resembled
the C3HC4 zinc finger domain, MYB-like transcription
factor, and AP2 were abundant in the male strobili of C.
japonica.
Identification and phylogenetic analysis of MADS-box
genes
Among the putative transcription factors, ten transcripts
encoded MADS-box proteins (Table 6). In addition, we
found another two transcripts whose products were simi-

lar to MADS-box proteins with E-values < 1e-8. We determined the entire sequence of representative cDNA derived
from each transcript (accession numbers AB359027
through AB359038). Figure 3 shows the phylogenetic tree
constructed from an alignment of the sequences of MADS,
I-, and K-domains. One cDNA clone (CMFL009_N22) did
not encode a K-domain and it was classified as the cDNA
of a type I MADS-box gene. Six of twelve C. japonica
MADS-box genes were classified as DEF/GLO/GGM13-like
genes and two genes were categorized as TM8-like genes.
The other three genes were categorized as AG-, AGL6-, and
TM3-like genes, respectively (Figure 3).

Discussion
The genomes of gymnosperm species are usually large and
replete with highly repetitive sequences. The haploid DNA
content of C. japonica was estimated to correspond to 11
pg of DNA [33]. This value is about half of the mean value
for Pinaceae species [34], but about eighty times that of
the Arabidopsis genome. EST analysis is a low-cost
approach to characterization of the coding component of
the genome. ESTs derived from several tissues of C.

japonica were analyzed previously [18,19,35]. However,
most of the previously analyzed ESTs were not full-length.
Full-length cDNAs are essential for the determination of
sites of initiation of transcription and the functional analysis of genes [36]. In the present study, we constructed a
full-length enriched cDNA library from C. japonica male
strobili at various stages of development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a full-length enriched cDNA
library from a gymnosperm. In fact, the information of
6,464 Sitka spruce full-length cDNA sequences were registered in GenBank (accession numbers EF081469 to
EF087932), but it has not been published. These fulllength cDNAs should be a valuable tool for gene discovery
and analysis in gymnosperms. We found that 90% of our

cDNA clones included G at the 5' ends (Table 2). The G at
the 5' end of full-length cDNA can be explained by the
addition of C to the 3' end of full-length first-strand cDNA
in a non-template-directed manner by the reverse transcriptase [37]. Our observation of bias towards G at the 5'
end of cDNAs is consistent with the addition of C to the
3' end of full-length cDNAs. The sequences of 5' ends
imply that our cDNA library had been enriched for fulllength cDNA clones. We also found that the second nucleotide of most cDNAs at their 5' termini was a purine
nucleotide, which is common at sites of initiation of transcription in Arabidopsis and rice [21]. This result suggests
that a purine nucleotide is common at sites of initiation of
transcription in C. japonica as well as Arabidopsis and rice.

However, further studies about the comparison between
genome sequences and the full-length cDNAs are needed
to identify the sequence characteristics around the transcription start site in C. japonica.
We isolated 36,011 ESTs from either one or both ends of
19,437 cDNA clones. These ESTs were clustered into
23,658 consensus sequences (7,686 tentative contigs and
15,972 singletons) by PHRAP. The redundancy is
extremely low compared with assemblies of ESTs derived
from other conifers. In previous studies, the assembly of
49,101 ESTs derived from 16 cDNA libraries from different tissues of white spruce resulted in 16,578 consensus
sequences [28], and that of 59,797 ESTs from wood-forming tissues of loblolly pine represented 20,377 consensus
sequences [38]. The normalization step in the generation
of our cDNA library contributed the high rate of gene discovery. We obtained 10,463 transcripts after a roundrobin BLASTN search and clustering of 5'- and 3'-end
sequences derived from the same respective clones. We
found that 1,317 transcripts (12.6%) did not exhibit any
similarity in terms of predicted amino acid sequences to
those encoded by Arabidopsis and rice genomes or to those
derived from Pinus, Picea and Populus ESTs using BLASTX
and TBLASTX (E-value > 1e-5). These results indicate that
the ESTs generated in the present study have added to the
known complement of gymnosperm transcripts.

We classified and annotated the transcripts isolated in this
study (Fig. 1; Table 3; Additional file 2). In our functional
classification, categories with no concrete assignment,
such as "prediction of general function only", "function
unknown" and "unassigned", accounted for a large fraction of transcripts (Fig. 1). Among assigned pollen transcripts of C. japonica, close to 31% of the predicted
proteins are involved in the synthesis and modification of
proteins, which are categorized as J and O [19]. However,
the percentage in those categories was only approximately
14% in the present study. The difference might be due to
the large population of transcripts in the present study
and/or to the specific characteristics of the male strobili of
C. japonica. Table 3 shows the functional annotation of
the most abundant families identified in this study. Protein kinase, cytochrome P450, and the RNA recognition
motif were the most frequent domains. These domains are
also present at relatively high levels in deduced products
of the genome of Arabidopsis. We also found that the numbers of transcripts that encoded certain protein families or
domains, such as NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase, the C3HC4 type zinc finger, the WD domain,
aspartyl proteases and aldo/keto reductases, were larger
than those that encoded the corresponding protein families or domains in the Arabidopsis genome. In general, the
degree of complexity of multigene families seems to be
correlated with the size of the plant genome. Southern

of conserved ortholog sets suggested that genomes of
gymnosperms include complex families of genes [39,40].
Our results suggest the increased complexity of gene families in C. japonica as compared to Arabidopsis. Since the
number of cDNA clones in the present study was insufficient to allow us to prove this hypothesis and since the
complete sequence of each clone has not been determined, further studies are needed to clarify the complexity
of gene families in C. japonica.
We also searched potential candidates for novel allergens
in C. japonica. In previous study, we analyzed similarity of
the deduced proteins encoded by ESTs derived from C.
japonica pollen and known plant allergens, and found
cDNA clones that encoded proteins similar to six types of
pollen allergens, eight types of food allergens and three
types of latex allergens [19]. In the present study, we
found 180 transcripts that encoded proteins similar to 22
pollen allergens including all of five known allergens in C.
japonica (Table 5). The major allergens in C. japonica are
known to have similarity to pollen allergens of other
plants [19]. The existence of numerous allergens in C.
japonica pollen has been suggested but only a few antigens

have been identified. These newly deduced proteins in C.
japonica are potential candidates for novel plant allergens.
In this study, we identified 207 transcripts that encoded
Pfam domains of transcription factors, including those
encoded by MADS-box genes. In plants, MADS-box genes
are involved in various aspects of vegetative and reproductive growth, including the morphogenesis of flowers.
Plant MADS-box genes are classified into types I and II
[41]. Most of plant type II genes have three more domains
than type I, namely, an intervening (I) domain, a keratinlike (K) domain, and a C-terminal (C) domain. The plant
type II genes are divided into two types based on the
intron structure, namely, MIKCC- and MIKC*-type genes
[42]. The MIKCC-type genes can be subdivided into several well-defined gene clades, known as 'subfamilies' [43].
We found twelve MADS-box genes derived from transcripts from male strobili of C. japonica, one of which was
a type I gene while the other eleven were MIKCC-type
genes. The MIKCC-type genes in C. japonica could be subdivided into five subfamilies: DEF/GLO/GGM13-, TM8-,
AG-, AGL6-, and TM3-like genes. To our knowledge, this
is the first report to identify type I genes and TM8-like
genes in a gymnosperm. Functional characterization of

raceae) [45]. We found evidence for at least one TM8-like
gene in Cryptomeria (Cupressaceae sensu lato). None has
been reported in Pinaceae to date, to our knowledge.
These results suggest that TM8-like genes were established
in the common ancestor of angiosperms and gymnosperms and that they have been lost relatively recently in
some lineages. It seems likely that the rate of birth-anddeath evolution of TM8-like genes has been high.
We identified six DEF/GLO/GGM13-like genes in this
study. DEF- and GLO-like genes are known as B-class
MADS genes, which are key regulators of petal and stamen
specification in model species of angiosperms, such as
Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus, and Petunia hybrida. GGM13-like genes are the sister lineage of the B-class
genes and are, hence, also known as Bsister (Bs) genes
[46]. Bs genes are expressed mainly in female reproductive
organs and a member of the Bs gene family is involved in
development of the seed coat [47]. B-class and Bs genes
were treated as one clade in the present study. Three genes
(CMFL_009_E12, CMFL_023_G10, CMFL_052_L02)
seem to be ancestral DEF- and GLO-like genes, while the
other three genes (CMFL_007_I11, CMFL_018_D08,
CMFL_046_H20) seem to constitute a sister clade of Bclass and Bs genes. Several gene duplications appear to
have occurred in the lineage to Cryptomeria after it
diverged from other conifers.

type I genes in plants has been very limited to date. The
type I gene in C. japonica (CMFL_009_N22) was most similar to AGL80, which is required for development of the
central cell of the female gametophyte [44]. The functions
of type I genes in reproductive organs in C. japonica
remain to be determined.

The phylogenetic analysis of MADS-box genes in the
present study has implications for the evolution of gymnosperms. The phylogenetic tree of TM3-like genes indicates that the Gnetales and the Pinaceae are nested as
sister groups and that Cryptomeria is a sister of the Gnetales plus Pinaceae clade. A similar result was obtained for
AG-like genes, but the bootstrap support was not very
strong. Our data support those in prior multigene phylogenetic studies that suggested that all conifers, with the
exception of Pinaceae, are a sister clade of the Gnetales
plus Pinaceae clade [48,49]. The evolution and divergence
of the MADS-box family of genes has been studied extensively. However, most of the studied MADS-box genes in
gymnosperms were derived from Gnetum, Pinus, and Picea
[50,51]. The identification and characterization of MADSbox genes in Cryptomeria and other gymnosperms should
help us to understand the evolution of the structure of
MADS-box genes and their roles in reproductive development.

Conclusion
The MADS-box gene family has been subjected to a model
of birth-and death evolution [41]. TM8-like genes have
been found in rosids (Cucurbitaceae) and asterids
(Solanaceae) but not in Arabidopsis [43]. A recent review
noted that TM8-like genes exist in the basalmost
angiosperms (Amborellaceae) and in magnoliids (Lau-

We established a full-length enriched cDNA library using
RNA derived from male strobili at various developmental
stages, and we obtained 36,011 ESTs that was grouped
into 10,463 clusters as unique transcripts. These fulllength cDNAs provide information on expression of genes
during the development of male reproductive organs. Our

full-length enriched cDNA library will be useful for largescale gene discovery for studies of gymnosperm species.

Methods
Plant Materials
Male strobili of C. japonica were collected at seven-days
intervals from mid August to mid November of 2003 and
2004. All the samples were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use. RNA was extracted
from each set of strobili, and a total RNA mixture derived
from all the samples was used for construction of a fulllength enriched cDNA library.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated by a previously described method
[52] with slight modifications, using the SV Total RNA
Isolating System (Promega, Madison WI). Frozen male
strobili were powdered with Multi-beads shocker® (Yasui
Kikai, Osaka, Japan). Then we added 7.5 ml of a solution
of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 20 mM EDTA, 1.4 M NaCl,
2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidinone, 5% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol and 0.5 mg/ml spermidine per gram of powdered male strobili with through mixing. After incubation
of the mixture at 65°C for 5 min, RNA was extracted twice
with an equal volume of a mixture of chloroform and isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) and centrifugation at 15,000 × g
for 20 min. One-fourth volume of 10 M LiCl was added to
the final aqueous phase. Total RNA was allowed to precipitate for 2 h and collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g
for 30 min. The pelleted RNA was dissolved in SV RNA
Lysis Buffer (Promega) and purified with the SV Total
RNA Isolating System according to the protocol provided
by the manufacturer. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared with a
μMACS™ mRNA Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany) according to the protocol provided
by the manufacturer.
Construction of a full-length enriched cDNA library and
DNA sequencing
A full-length enriched cDNA library was generated from
poly(A)+ RNA by the biotinylated CAP trapper method
using trehalose-thermoactivated reverse transcriptase as
described previously [36,53]. The resultant cDNAs were
normalized, inserted into λ-FLC-III vectors and packaged
[54,55]. The packaged DNA produced approximately 1.1
× 106 plaques and the original phage library was amplified
once. Part of the one-round-amplified phage library was
excised in vivo and resultant plasmids were used to transform E. coli DH10B. Colonies of bacteria were picked with
picking machines (Q-bot; Genetix, New Milton, UK) and
transferred to 384-microwell plates. DNA templates corresponding to cDNA inserts were prepared from glycerol
stocks by the rolling circle amplification (RCA) method
with a TempliPhi™ DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). Products of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/383

RCA were sequenced with BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
and automatic sequencers (ABI 3700; Applied Biosystems). The M13-21 primer (5'-TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC
AGT-3') was used for forward sequencing and the 1233
primer (5'-AGC GGA TAA CAA TTT CAC ACA GGA-3')
was used for reverse sequencing. Sequences were qualitytrimmed by reference to the high-quality (PHRED 20 or
better) contiguous region, as determined with PHRED
software [56] and then vector and poly(A) regions were
removed. Sequences of less than 100 nucleotides after
trimming were discarded. Contaminating regions of E. coli
genome were identified with BLASTN [57], and ESTs with
an E-value < 1e-10 were excluded. The remaining
sequences were used for further analysis.
We searched for the nucleotide and amino acid sequences
in TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resources; genome
release version 6.0) [58] homologous to nucleotide and
predicted amino acid sequences encoded by the 5'-end
sequences of ESTs using the BLASTN and BLASTX program. We also searched for sequence homologies between
the 5'-end sequences of ESTs and the cDNA and promoter
region of Cry j 2 using the BLASTN program. Assessment
of possible contamination by chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and by ribosomal RNAs was performed
with the BLASTN program (E-value < 1e-10). We used the
chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of Arabidopsis
thaliana and genes for ribosomal RNAs from A. thaliana,
Populus species, Platanus occidentalis and Zea mays as query
sequences.
Grouping of ESTs
Related cDNA sequences from both 5' and 3' ends were
grouped as contig sequences with the PHRAP program
according to the following criteria: -penalty -5; -minmatch
300; -minscore 300; and -trim_qual 20 [59]. After grouping ESTs as contigs, we used the BLASTN program to compare contig sequences. When contig sequences overlapped
by more than 200 nucleotides and were more than 99%
homologous in the overlapping regions and, in addition,
when the overlap began within 5 bp from the ends of the
contig sequences, we grouped the contig sequences
together. We performed BLASTN searches separately for
the EST sequences of between 100 and 200 bp and the
resultant contig sequences. When an EST sequence and a
contig were more than 98% homologous and the length
of non-overlapping sequence in the EST sequence was less
than 10 bp and, in addition, the overlap began within 5
bp from the end of the EST sequence or the contig, we
grouped the EST sequence and the contig together. Finally
both 5'- and 3'-end sequences derived from the same
clone were grouped together.

Functional classification and annotation of ESTs
We categorized ESTs on the basis of the putative functions
of encoded products using a database of clusters of orthologous groups from seven eukaryotic genomes (COG)
[25]. We used databases of proteins from more than three
species (KOGs), proteins from two species (TWOGs) and
lineage-specific expansion groups (LSEs). We compared
the results of BLASTX analysis of each sequence in each
cluster and adopted the functional category with the highest score.

We performed similarity searches with the BLASTX and
TBLASTX programs. We used RefSeq of Arabidopsis from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information [60],
the database of the Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular
Biological Encyclopedia [61] and UniProtKB/TrEMBL
Release 33.3 [62] as protein databases, and we used Pinus
Gene Index Release 6.0, Spruce Gene Index Release 2.0,
and Poplar Gene Index Release 3.0 from the TIGR Gene
Indices [63] as EST databases. Sequences of stamen- and
pollen-specific transcripts of Arabidopsis were obtained
from previous studies [29,30]. Similarities to ESTs that
had previously been derived from C. japonica were determined with the BLASTN program. Similarities to known
plant allergens were determined by BLASTX comparison
with proteins in Allergome database http://www.aller
gome.org[31]. We annotated protein families using a list
of Pfam domain sequence (Pfam-A.fasta; release 21.0)
[27] using the BLASTX program and an E-value < 1e-10.
We obtained domain annotations of Arabidopsis thaliana
proteins from the TAIR website [58] and selected Pfam
families with an E-value < 1e-10.
Phylogenetic analysis
To reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of MADS-box genes, we
obtained amino acid sequences from EMBL/DDBJ/GenBank DNA databases and aligned them using the Clustal
W program [64]. The alignments of sequences of MADS,
intervening (I-) and keratin-like (K-) domains were edited
manually using the MacClade program [65]. Maximum
likelihood distances were calculated with the NJdist and
ProtML programs in MOLPHY [66]. A neighbor-joining
(NJ) tree was obtained with NJdist, and was based on ML
distances in the JTT model [67]. This tree was used as the
starting tree for a local rearrangement search with the
ProtML program [66]. The local bootstrap probability of
each branch was estimated by the resampling-of-estimated-log-likelihood (RELL) method [68].
