Abstract
Background: Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of blast disease of rice, is the most destructive disease
of rice worldwide. The genome of this fungal pathogen has been sequenced and an automated annotation
has recently been updated to Version 6 http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/
magnaporthe_grisea/MultiDownloads.html. However, a comprehensive manual curation remains to be
performed. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is a valuable means of assigning functional information using
standardized vocabulary. We report an overview of the GO annotation for Version 5 of M. oryzae genome
assembly.
Methods: A similarity-based (i.e., computational) GO annotation with manual review was conducted,
which was then integrated with a literature-based GO annotation with computational assistance. For
similarity-based GO annotation a stringent reciprocal best hits method was used to identify similarity
between predicted proteins of M. oryzae and GO proteins from multiple organisms with published
associations to GO terms. Significant alignment pairs were manually reviewed. Functional assignments were
further cross-validated with manually reviewed data, conserved domains, or data determined by wet lab
experiments. Additionally, biological appropriateness of the functional assignments was manually checked.
Results: In total, 6,286 proteins received GO term assignment via the homology-based annotation,
including 2,870 hypothetical proteins. Literature-based experimental evidence, such as microarray, MPSS,
T-DNA insertion mutation, or gene knockout mutation, resulted in 2,810 proteins being annotated with
GO terms. Of these, 1,673 proteins were annotated with new terms developed for Plant-Associated
Microbe Gene Ontology (PAMGO). In addition, 67 experiment-determined secreted proteins were
annotated with PAMGO terms. Integration of the two data sets resulted in 7,412 proteins (57%) being
annotated with 1,957 distinct and specific GO terms. Unannotated proteins were assigned to the 3 root
terms. The Version 5 GO annotation is publically queryable via the GO site http://amigo.geneontology.org/
cgi-bin/amigo/go.cgi. Additionally, the genome of M. oryzae is constantly being refined and updated as new
information is incorporated. For the latest GO annotation of Version 6 genome, please visit our website
http://scotland.fgl.ncsu.edu/smeng/GoAnnotationMagnaporthegrisea.html. The preliminary GO annotation

of Version 6 genome is placed at a local MySql database that is publically queryable via a user-friendly
interface Adhoc Query System.
Conclusion: Our analysis provides comprehensive and robust GO annotations of the M. oryzae genome
assemblies that will be solid foundations for further functional interrogation of M. oryzae.

Introduction
Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus, infects rice and
other agriculturally important cereals, such as wheat, rye
and barley. The pathogen is found throughout the world
and each year is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed
more than 60 million people [1]. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic makeup of the rice blast fungus is
crucial in efforts to understand the biology and develop
effective disease management strategies of this destructive
pathogen.
The rice blast fungus has been the focus of intense investigation and a number of genomic resources have been generated. These include a genome sequence [2], genomewide expression from microarray [3] and massive parallel
signature sequencing (MPSS) [4], as well as large bank of
T-DNA insertion mutants [5,6]. In addition, numerous
genes have been functionally characterized by targeted
knockout [7-18]. While these resources are of tremendous
utility, much of the genome remains unexplored. Till
now, only automated annotations of the predicted genes
have been available. In order to maximize the utility of the
genome sequence, we have developed manual curations
of the predicted genes.
Providing functionality through careful and comprehensive application of a standardized vocabulary, such as the
Gene Ontology (GO) requires manual curation. The GO
has evolved into a reliable and rapid means of assigning
functional information [19-22]. There are two types of
GO annotations. One is referred to as similarity-based GO
annotation, and the other is literature-based GO annotation. Similarity-based GO annotation applies computational approaches to match characterized gene products
and their associated GO terms to gene products under
study. Orthology-based GO annotation is a more stringent application of similarity-based GO annotation. Literature-based GO annotation involves reviewing published
work and then manually assigning GO terms to characterized gene products. Currently, similarity-based GO annotation predominates since it is rapid and relatively
inexpensive [21,23]. On the other hand, although literature-based annotation is time consuming, it is considered
more reliable and provides a mechanism to assign previously unassigned GO terms or newly developed GO terms
to proteins. Here, we present an overview of the strategy
and results obtained from the integration of both

approaches to assign GO terms to Versions 5 of M. oryzae
genome.

Methods
M. oryzae genome sequence
This paper summarizes manual annotation of Version 5 of
the M. oryzae genome sequence. At the time of submission
of this manuscript, Version 6 of the genome assembly of
M. oryzae was released by the Broad Institute. Version 6
will be annotated using the same methodology described
here. A preliminary GO annotation of the Version 6
genome sequence, based on the Version 5 annotation, has
been placed at our local MySQL database at http://scot
land.fgl.ncsu.edu/smeng/GoAnnotationMagnaporthe
gria.html.
Sequence similarity-based GO annotation
Step 1
Predicted proteins of Version 5 of the M. oryzae genome
sequence were downloaded from the Broad Institute at
http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/
magnaporthe_grisea/MultiDownloads.html. GO-annotated proteins were downloaded from the Gene Ontology
(GO) database at http://www.Geneontology.org/
GO.downloads.database.shtml. These GO-annotated proteins were from about 50 organisms with published association with GO terms. Only three of the 50 organisms are
fungi. They are Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Other organisms are from
bacteria, plants, or animals etc. Proteins of these non-fungal organisms were retained to increase the number of
proteins with validated functions available for matching
to M. oryzae.
Step 2
Possible ortholog pairs between GO proteins and predicted proteins from M. oryzae genome sequence Version
5 were estimated by searching for reciprocal best hits
using BLASTP (e-value < 10-3) [24].
Step 3
Significant alignment pairs with 80% or better coverage of
both query and subject sequences, 10-20 or less BLASTP Evalue, and 40% or higher of amino acid identity (pid)
were manually reviewed.

Step 4
The functions of significantly matched GO proteins were
manually cross- validated using data from wet lab experiments, and the NCBI Conserved Domain Database
(CDD) [25].
Step 5
If the functions suggested from different sources were consistent with each other, and with available M. oryzae data,
the functions of the experimentally characterized, significantly matched GO proteins, were transferred to the M.
oryzae proteins in our study, and given the evidence code
ISS (Inferred from Sequence Similarity) [26,27].
Step 5
The information was recorded into a gene association file
following the format standard at http://www.geneontol
ogy.org/GO.format.annotation.shtml.
Literature-based GO annotation
Step 1
Literature at public databases such as PubMed [a database
of biomedical literature citations and abstracts at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)]
were searched using key words, including alternative species names for the organism such as Magnaporthe grisea
and Pyricularia oryzae.
Step 2
Relevant published papers were read and genes or gene
products and their functions were identified.
Step 3
Where necessary, gene IDs and sequences at public databases, such as the NCBI protein database were identified.
Step 4
Based on the functions identified in the paper(s), appropriate GO terms were found using AmiGO, the GO-supported tool for searching and browsing the Gene
Ontology database.
Step 5
Evidence codes were assigned following the guide at
http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml.
Step 6
Data were recorded into the gene association file manually or using custom PERL scripts for large gene sets with
the same biological process.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S8

Integration of the results from the two types of GO
annotations
Step 1
Similarity-based annotations were replaced with literature-based annotations, where redundant, using custom
PERL scripts.
Step 2
Custom PERL scripts were used to annotate each protein
with GO terms from the three ontologies using the following protocol. Any protein not annotated with a GO term
following similarity-based and literature-based GO annotations was annotated with the three root GO terms,
GO:0005575 (Cellular Component), GO:0003674
(Molecular Function), and GO:0008150 (Biological Process). Additionally, if any protein was lacking annotation
from any of the three GO categories, Cellular Component,
Molecular Function, or Biological Process, the protein was
annotated with the root GO terms of the missing GO categories.
Step 3
Errors in the gene association file were checked using the
script, filter-gene-association.pl, which was downloaded
from the GO database at ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/pub/
go/software/utilities/filter-gene-association.pl.

The gene association file for Version 5 of the M. oryzae
genome sequence was uploaded to the GO database at
http://www.geneontology.org/GO.current.annota
tions.shtml. Many protocols and scripts were created for
generating and parsing the data. For example, a protocol
and five scripts were developed to replace redundant similarity-based annotation with literature-based annotation.
Furthermore, a protocol and eight scripts were developed
to provide each gene with a GO term from the three ontologies. In addition, a PERL script to record many genes into
the gene association file was developed. This script, with
slight modification, easily recorded different types of data,
such as microarray expression, MPSS, or T-DNA insertion
mutation, etc., into the gene association file. These protocols and scripts are available upon request from the corresponding or the first author.

Results
Computational GO annotation
From the initial BLASTP analysis for reciprocal best hits,
6,286 (49% of the 12,832) predicted proteins were annotated with 1,911 distinct and specific GO terms out of a
total of 29,126 assigned terms. Totally, 4,881 (78%) of
the 6,286 proteins were considered to be significant
matches to characterized GO proteins, with an E-value <
10-20 and percentage of identity (pid) ≥ 40%. Furthermore, 4,535 (93%) of the 4,881 proteins were annotated
based on highly significant similarities with E-values = 0

terms. For example, 36 proteins were annotated with
GO:0005975 ("carbohydrate metabolic process"), and 12
proteins were annotated with GO:0006520 ("amino acid
metabolic process"). An evidence code RCA was assigned
to annotations of the 428 transcription factors since the
annotations were based on reviewed computational analysis.
A total of 2,548 conserved domains from NCBI CDD were
used as evidence for cross-checking putative functions,
but no GO annotation was made based solely on identification of these domains.

Features of reciprocal best BLASTP matches
between GO-annotated proteins and predicted proteins of Magnaporthe oryzae. The vast majority of the
matches to characterized proteins have high sequence identity over much of their length. Shaded grey bars indicate
matches with a percentage of identity (pid) ≥ 40%, and
shaded black bars indicate pid < 40%.
and pid ≥ 40% (see Figure 1 for details). The pairwise
alignments of these significant matches were manually
reviewed. Additionally, these high quality matches were
cross-validated as follows:
A total of 67 secreted proteins of M. oryzae was experimentally demonstrated to be secreted through cloning into an
overexpression vector and expressed in M. oryzae transformants (Ebbole and Dean, unpublished data). These 67
secreted proteins were annotated with a biological process
term GO:0009306 ("protein secretion") and a cellular
component term GO:0005576 (extracellular region). An
evidence code IDA was assigned to annotations of these
67 proteins since function was determined through direct
assay.
A total of 128 curated cytochrome P450's of M. oryzae
were validated by comparison and analysis of gene location and structure, clustering of genes, and phylogenetic
reconstruction [28]. Different subsets of these proteins
were annotated with different GO terms. For example, 75
of the 128 P450 proteins were annotated with the molecular function term GO:0005506 ("iron ion binding"),
and 40 P450 proteins with the molecular function term
GO:0016491 ("oxidoreductase activity"). An evidence
code IGC was assigned to annotations of these P450 proteins since annotations were based on genomic context.
A total of 428 putative transcription factors of M. oryzae
were validated by integrated computational analysis of
whole genome microarray expression data, and matches
to InterPro, pfam, and COG [3]. Again, different subsets
of the 428 proteins were annotated with different GO

In addition, the evidence code ISS was assigned to annotations of 216 M. oryzae proteins for the following reasons: 1) These proteins have significant similarity to
experimentally-characterized homologs over the majority
(at least 80%) of the full length sequences. 2) The pairwise
alignments of good matches between the characterized
proteins and the proteins of M. oryzae were manually
reviewed. 3) Functional domains were conserved between
the M. oryzae proteins and their homologs. 4) The GO
assignments from the characterized match proteins to the
M. oryzae proteins were manually determined to be biologically relevant.
The remaining 1,343 proteins with a reciprocal BLASTP
best match of e-value > 10-20 and pid < 40% were assigned
GO terms from their characterized matches, but the evidence codes were identified as IEA (Inferred from Electronic Annotation).
In sum, GO terms were assigned to 6,286 proteins of M.
oryzae. Among the 6,286 proteins, 2,732 hypothetical proteins, 125 predicted proteins, and 14 unknown proteins
were assigned functions.
Literature-based GO annotation
More than 400 research articles were read, and 71 genes
with gene knockout mutations and with accession numbers and sequences deposited in public databases such as
NCBI were manually annotated using GO terms, including newly developed Plant-Associated Microbe Gene
Ontology (PAMGO) terms. Gene products were annotated with GO terms relevant to their biological functions.
For example, 6 genes were annotated with GO:0000187
("activation of MAPK activity"), 5 genes with
GO:0075053 ("formation of symbiont penetration peg
for entry into host"), 14 genes with GO:0044409 ("entry
into host"), 8 genes with GO:0044412 ("growth or development of symbiont within host"), and 43 genes with
GO:0009405 ("pathogenesis"). The evidence code IMP
(inferred from Mutant Phenotype) was assigned to these
annotations since gene-knockout mutants were generated
in order to determine functions of these genes.

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9(Suppl 1):S8

A total of 210 genes were annotated on the basis of published microarray studies [3]. Again, gene products were
annotated with GO terms, including PAMGO terms, relevant to their biological functions. For example, 67 genes
were annotated with GO:0044271 ("nitrogen compound
biosynthetic process"), 27 genes with GO:0075005
("spore germination on or near host"), 26 genes with
GO:0075035 ("maturation of appressorium on or near
host"), and 114 genes with GO:0075016 ("appressorium
formation on or near host"). The evidence code IEP
(Inferred from expression Pattern) was assigned to these
annotations on the basis that the genes were up-regulated
by at least 10-fold in association with the particular biological process. A further 2,433 genes were annotated on
the basis of published Massively Parallel Signature
Sequencing (MPSS) studies [4], including 1,041 genes
annotated with GO:0043581 ("mycelium development"), and 1,392 genes annotated with GO:0075016
("appressorium formation on or near host"). The evidence code IEP was also assigned to these annotations
since the genes were up-regulated only during a certain
biological process, such as mycelium formation, and the
fold change was equal to or greater than 10.
On the basis of whole genome T-DNA insertion mutation
data [5], 120 genes were annotated with relevant GO
terms and PAMGO terms. For instance, 43 genes were
annotated with GO:0030437 ("ascospore formation"), 14
genes with GO:0009847 ("spore germination"), 64 genes
with GO:0075016 ("appressorium formation on or near
host"), and 106 genes with GO:0009405 ("pathogenesis"). An evidence code IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype) was assigned to these annotations.
In total, 2,810 proteins were annotated based on experimental data from published peer-reviewed literature. Of
these, 1,673 proteins were annotated with terms created
by the PAMGO consortium to describe interactions
between symbionts and their hosts.
Integration of results from the two types of GO
annotations
Integration of the similarity-based and literature-based
annotation resulted in 7,412 proteins being annotated
with specific GO terms, covering more than 57% of the
inferred proteome. The remaining 5,464 predicted proteins, not having high similarity to GO-annotated proteins, were annotated with three general GO terms.
GO:0005575 (Cellular Component), GO:0003674
(Molecular Function), and GO:0008150 (Biological Process). Therefore, our GO annotation provides an annotation of the entire 12,832 proteins predicted in M. oryzae,
and each protein being annotated with GO terms from the
three GO categories.

Data availability
The GO annotation of Version 5 of the genome sequence
of Magnaporthe oryzae is available at the GO Consortium
database
http://www.geneontology.org/GO.cur
rent.annotations.shtml.

Discussion
Here, we present a detailed protocol for integrating the
results of similarity-based annotation with a literaturebased annotation of the predicted proteome of Version 5
of the genome sequence of the rice blast fungus M. oryzae.
Through careful manual inspection of these annotations,
we are able to provide a reliable and robust GO annotation for more than half of the predicted gene products. Of
6,286 proteins receiving computational annotations, only
1,343 did not exceed our stringent match criteria upon
manual review and so were assigned the evidence code
IEA. It should be noted that annotations with the IEA evidence code are retained in the GO database for only one
year, and then the GO Consortium will remove them
from a gene association file. To be retained, IEA annotations must be manually reviewed in order to be assigned
an upgraded evidence code such as ISS (Inferred from
Sequence or Structural Similarity). Currently, there is no
recognized standard to assign the ISS code. We recommend the following criteria for assigning the ISS code:
• The functions of the proteins from which the annotation
will be transferred must be experimentally characterized.
• The similarity between the characterized proteins and
the proteins under study must be significant. For example,
we used ≥ 80% coverage of both query and subject
sequences, ≤ 10-20 E-value, and ≥ 40% percentage of identity (pid) as cutoff criteria in our similarity-based GO
annotation. Ideally, orthology should be established by
phylogenetic analysis.
• The pairwise alignment between the characterized proteins and the proteins under study should be manually
reviewed and cross-validated with characterized or
reviewed data of other resources such as functional
domains, active sites, and sequence patterns etc.
• Biological appropriateness of all assigned GO terms
should be manually reviewed.
