Abstract
Background: The ability to discern ancestral relationships between individual human colon crypts
is limited. Widely separated crypts likely trace their common ancestors to a time around birth, but
closely spaced adult crypts may share more recent common ancestors if they frequently divide by
fission to form clonal patches. Alternatively, adult crypts may be long-lived structures that
infrequently divide or die.
Methods: Methylation patterns (the 5' to 3' order of methylation) at CpG sites that exhibit
random changes with aging were measured from isolated crypts by bisulfite genomic sequencing.
This epigenetic drift may be used to infer ancestry because recently related crypts should have
similar methylation patterns.
Results: Methylation patterns were different between widely separated ("unrelated") crypts
greater than 15 cm apart. Evidence for a more recent relationship between directly adjacent or
branched crypts could not be found because their methylation pattern distances were not
significantly different than widely separated crypt pairs. Methylation patterns are essentially equally
different between two adult human crypts regardless of their relative locations.
Conclusions: Methylation patterns appear to record somatic cell trees. Starting from a single cell
at conception, sequences replicate and may drift apart. Most adult human colon crypts appear to
be long-lived structures that become mosaic with respect to methylation during aging.

Background
The human colon is a large, epithelial lined organ that
develops from a simple tube [1]. Crypts form from this
tube and subdivide the colon into millions of distinct
clonal units maintained by stem cells [2]. With further
growth or damage, crypts may bifurcate to produce new
adjacent crypts by a branching process called fission [3-6].
In rodent models, crypt fission is prominent in early
development and declines with age [7]. Little is known
about the fates of human colon crypts during aging.
Unlike rodents, human colons persist for decades after

development. Possibly the majority of adult crypts form
early in life and subsequently survive a lifetime as independent clonal units. Alternatively, crypts may periodically die or turn over with new crypts created to replace
old crypts. Branched crypts [presumed fission intermediates) are observed in normal adult human colons at low
(<1% of all crypts) frequencies, suggesting some adult
crypts periodically divide [8].
Adult crypt fates may be described with somatic cell trees
that identify common ancestors (progenitors), their

Colon somatic cell ancestral trees resemble a "big bang", originating from a zygote and progressively growing with aging. All
cells eventually relate to each other, and therefore "Y" shaped trees characterize the relationship between any two cells. The
last possible common ancestor between widely spaced crypts is around birth, and their ancestral trees must have short trunks
and essentially life-long branches. In contrast, more closely spaced crypts may be related by recent crypt fission, yielding ancestral trees with relatively longer trunks and shorter branches. Tree branch lengths may be inferred from methylation pattern
drift – methylation at some CpG sites appears to randomly change with aging. Methylation patterns were not significantly different between widely or closely spaced (within the same 1–2 cm2 patch or directly adjacent) crypts, consistent with stable,
long-lived adult crypts.

descendants (clonal patches), and distances since common ancestors (Figure 1). Distances between cells can be
defined as time or numbers of divisions since a common
progenitor. Aging complicates somatic cell ancestry
because even patches of descendants may eventually
become distantly related over a lifetime. For example,
patches containing up to 450 human colon crypts can be
visualized by differential G6PD expression [9]. These
patches likely reflect development from single progenitors
that randomly inactive X-chromosomes during embreyogenesis. Cells in such clonal patches are more related to
each other compared to cells from other patches, but even
within patches, the time of a common ancestor between
any two adult cells may vary from less than a day to a lifetime. Visual markers such as G6PD identify descendants
but cannot directly infer times since a common ancestor.
An ideal fate marker would be identical in recently created
crypt pairs but become progressively different after fission. Recent studies illustrate that methylation of some
CpG rich sequences changes with aging in normal human
colons [10,11]. At least some of this methylation appears
to reflect random error or drift that begins from birth [12].
Methylation demonstrates somatic inheritance [13] and
therefore, similar to sequences used to recreate phylogenies, random epigenetic changes acquired over time may
be used to recreate relationships between cells. More
closely related cells should have more similar methylation
patterns compared to less-related cells. Methylation patterns at specific CpG rich sequences sampled from individual human colon crypts appear to record lifetime stem

cell histories [12]. Crypt methylation patterns are consistent with niches in which stem cell numbers remain constant, but stem cells randomly turnover by a population
mechanism [12,14-16].
As expected with drift and independent clonal units,
methylation patterns differed between crypts randomly
sampled from small human colon patches [12]. Here we
further explore ancestral relationships between human
colon crypts by comparing methylation patterns from
crypts separated by different distances (at least 15 cm
apart, within the same 1–2 cm2 patch, directly adjacent,
and branched crypts). Physical distance may be used as a
surrogate for time since a common ancestor because
crypts physically separated far apart cannot be related
except around the time of birth. In contrast, cells in adjacent crypts may or may not be related through recent
fission.

Methods
Patients
Directly adjacent crypt pairs were obtained from normal
appearing colon of five male patients undergoing colectomy at the Norris Cancer Center. Patient characteristics
are presented in Table 1. Random single crypts were
obtained from 1–2 cm2 patches of colon mucosa from
Patients A, D and E, either from the same patch or two different patches separated by at least 15 cm. Branched crypts
were obtained from Patient E and the normal appearing
colon of a 44 year-old patient with ulcerative colitis.

Crypt isolation
Individual or connected crypts were isolated from fresh
colon mucosa using an EDTA containing solution
[12,17]. Crypt morphology was verified with an inverted
microscope. Adjacent crypt pairs initially attached at their
luminal surfaces were placed into small culture dishes,
and passive separation was achieved by further shaking.
Individual crypts of each adjacent pair were placed into
0.5 ml microfuge tubes and separately analyzed. A total of
15 adjacent crypt pairs were examined.

Results

Branched crypts were defined as two crypt bases attached
below the luminal surface. A single branched crypt was
obtained from Patient E and seven from the normal
appearing colon of a 44 year-old patient with ulcerative
colitis. The branched crypts demonstrated asymmetrical
budding with one crypt larger than the other crypt.

The Y-shaped tree between two cells may be inferred from
their methylation pattern differences, which are expected
to be a function of drift or divisions since their common
ancestor. Longer intervals since a common ancestor
should produce greater methylation pattern differences.
Methylation differences consistent with a "lifetime" of
drift can be empirically inferred by comparing patterns
from cells physically isolated from each other since birth,
or widely separated crypts sampled from colon patches at
least 15 cm apart pairs. More closely spaced crypts potentially allow for recent ancestry (long trunk, short
branches) from crypt fission. However, if all crypts are created around birth, all possible crypt trees are equivalent
(short trunks, long branches) and methylation patterns
should be unable to distinguish between crypt pairs separated by different distances.

Methylation analysis
DNA was isolated and bisulfite treated using an agarose
bead method [12,18]. Approximately half the bead was
used for PCR. PCR products were cloned and individual
clones were sequenced. From 4 to 8 sequences (average of
6.9) were obtained from each crypt in Table 1. From 10 to
16 sequences (average 10.9) were obtained from each
branched crypt pair. Clones with evidence of incomplete
bisulfite conversion (ie C's at non-CpG sites) were eliminated from the analysis.

Methylation patterns were sampled at the CpG rich loci
BGN (with 9 CpG sites) and CSX (with 8 CpG sites) as
previously described [12]. BGN is on the X-chromosome
and therefore all cells contain a single BGN allele because
only crypts from male individuals were examined.
Patients B and the 44 year-old had a polymorphism in
BGN such that only 8 CpG sites were present. The comparisons based on 8 versus 9 sites did not significantly change
the conclusions of this study.
Each sequenced molecule is referred to as a "tag". There
are 512 possible different tags for BGN and 256 for CSX.
Percent methylation was calculated from the number of
methylated CpG sites. Distance was measured by summing the total number of methylation site differences
between two methylation tags. Intracrypt distance was the
average difference between all possible tag pairs sampled
from a single crypt or from a branched crypt unit. Intercrypt distance was the average difference between all possible tag pairs sampled between two crypts. Intercrypt
distances were calculated between adjacent crypt pairs,
and between possible combinations of crypt pairs randomly isolated from the same colon patch or patches separated at least 15 cm apart. A two-sided t-test was used to
compare distributions.

Methylation tags as markers of ancestry: the strategy
A theoretical "Y" shaped tree describes ancestry between
any two cells or crypts, with the last common ancestor
located at the trunk and branch junction, and the zygote
at its base (Figure 1). Crypts may remain visibly
unchanged but their ancestral trees continuously change
with aging. Two cells last related at birth have a short
trunk tree with life-long branches. Two cells related by
recent division have a life-long trunk and short branches.

A simple measure of drift or distance between methylation patterns is the total number of methylation site
differences between two CpG rich sequences [12]. The
BGN sequence contains nine CpG sites and the maximum
possible difference or distance is nine (Figure 2). By representing methylated CpG sites as "1'' and unmethylated
sites as "0'', each BGN sequence can be displayed as a
binary string or tag. For example a fully methylated tag is
"111111111'' and an unmethylated tag is "000000000'',
and the distance between these tags is nine. Of note the
BGN locus is located on the X-chromosome and only
male patients were examined. Therefore, each BGN tag
represents a single cell.
Distances may be measured by comparing tags within an
individual crypt (intracrypt distance) or between two
crypts (intercrypt distance). Numerical distances are not
absolute measures of time since a common ancestor
because methylation errors or drift are stochastic. For
example, by chance, unrelated crypts may have similar
methylation patterns. How intercrypt or intracrypt distances change with aging is illustrated in Figure 2B based
on a previously published scenario [12].

tags. Average distances (line) change with aging according to our model of human crypt niches [11]. 95% simulation intervals
(dotted lines) reflect that drift and therefore distances are stochastic and not deterministic. The lower simulation bound for
intracrypt distances is zero. Intracrypt distances remain relatively constant through life because stem cell niche turnover
results in the periodic loss of all stem cell lineages except one. These "bottlenecks" ensure that all cells within a crypt are relatively closely related to each other. In contrast, intercrypt distances increase with age, reflecting that methylation tags randomly drift apart in unrelated crypts. C) Examples of BGN methylation tags (5' to 3') in adjacent and branched crypts. Filled
circles are methylated CpG sites and tags from individual crypts are grouped. Intracrypt and intercrypt distances are labeled.

Adjacent and non-adjacent crypts are equally unrelated
BGN tags sampled from crypts (Table 1) had complex
methylation patterns (Figure 2C). Variable numbers of
unique tags were present within each crypt, as expected
because crypts contain multiple stem cells. Intracrypt and
intercrypt distances were variable, likely reflecting stochastic methylation errors and random stem cell death.
Average intracrypt distance was significantly less than
average intercrypt distances (Figure 3), consistent with
cells within a crypt being more related than cells in different crypts. Comparisons of intercrypt distances revealed

no significant differences between adjacent crypt pairs,
crypts randomly sampled from the same 1–2 cm2 patch,
or widely separated crypts sampled from patches located
at least 15 cm apart (Figure 3). The data are consistent
long-lived adult crypts because it was not possible to distinguish between adjacent or nonadjacent crypt pairs.
Intercrypt distances between four adjacent crypt pairs
were small (Table 1 and Figure 3). These adjacent crypts
may be more closely related by recent fission, but another
possibility is they are also distantly related and happen to

have similar methylation patterns by chance. Adjacent
crypts with smaller intercrypt distances contained predominantly unmethylated tags (Table 2). Many human
crypts contain unmethylated BGN tags, likely because
CpG rich regions are initially unmethylated at birth [19].
To better characterize crypt ancestry a second methylation
tag called CSX was examined because methylation at different CpG rich loci appears to be independent [12]. CSX
tags were usually methylated, with large intercrypt distances in the four adjacent crypt pairs (Table 2). Therefore,
all adjacent crypt pairs appear to be distantly related with
distance variations due to chance rather than recent crypt
fission.
Branched crypts resemble connected but unrelated
independent crypts
Tag intracrypt distances in branched crypts (Figure 4) were
significantly greater than single crypts (p = 0.0035) and
slightly less than intercrypt distances, but not significantly
(p = 0.35) different (Figure 3). Therefore, branched crypts
appear to be different from single crypts and more resemble two independent but connected individual crypts.

Discussion
Fates of individual human colon crypts are uncertain and
must be inferred because most crypts appear alike and
long-term serial observations are infeasible. Crypt behaviors are more readily examined in rodent models, but
these studies primarily examine development rather than
aging because rodents only live a few years. To accommodate growth, individual crypts bifurcate into two crypts by
a process called fission. A murine crypt replication cycle
(total time for crypt fission) requires about 108 days
(reviewed in [6]). Physical separation of branched crypts
(thought to be morphologic fission intermediates) into
two new crypts requires from 12 hours to 5 days [6,20].
Crypt fission is prominent early in life but declines with
age in rodent models [7]. Branched crypts can also be
observed at low frequencies (<1% of all crypts) in normal
adult human colons [8], suggesting crypt fission recurs
throughout life.
An approach based on the random drift of methylation
patterns [12] was used to investigate adult human crypt
ancestral relationships. Sequences can be used to trace
ancestry, and like base sequences, methylation at CpG
sites exhibits somatic inheritance [13] but some errors are
inevitable introduced during replication. The methylation
error rate appears to be greater than for sequences and has
been estimated at about 2 × 10-5 per CpG site per day [12],
allowing for many changes within a human lifetime.
Methylation patterns sampled from crypts at certain CpG
rich sequences are complex and different between crypts
(Figure 2C). The patterns appear stochastic and consistent
with drift or random methylation errors with aging.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/4/8

Recently related cells should share similar methylation
patterns whereas less related cells may have different
patterns.
Extraction of ancestral information from methylation patterns may be difficult and many uncertainties exist [21].
Therefore, the starting point of our analysis compares
methylation patterns between cells with relatively known
ancestries. Cells from widely separated crypts (greater
than 15 cm apart) likely shared a last common ancestor
around birth, or a "Y" shaped tree with life long branches
(Figure 1). In contrast, cells within a crypt likely share a
more recent common ancestor. Crypts are maintained by
small numbers of stem cells that reside in niches near
crypt bases [2]. Niche stem cells are not strictly immortal
but turn over through a population type mechanism [1315] by which random stem cell loss with replacement
eventually results in the extinction of all stem cell lineages
except one, or niche succession. These niche "bottlenecks"
periodically reduce intracrypt diversity because at various
times after birth, all crypt cells become related to a new
common ancestor. By one model a human crypt niche
contains 64 stem cells and niche succession occurs on
average every eight years [11]. Therefore, cells within an
adult crypt have Y-shaped trees with long trunks and short
(~eight years long) branches. Consistent with an ability to
distinguish between known relationships (short trunk,
life-long branches versus long trunk, short branches),
methylation differences between widely separated crypts
were significantly greater than within crypts (Figure 3).
Relationships between closely spaced crypts are less well
known, but comparisons between any two adult crypts, or
within branched crypts, revealed differences significantly
greater than intracrypt differences. Furthermore, methylation distances between cells from different crypts regardless of proximity, or between cells in branched crypts were
not significantly different. These findings suggest two
basic Y-shaped trees describe the majority of adult crypt
cells. Trees with long trunks and short branches are
present within single crypts, and trees with short trunks
and long branches connect cells in different crypts.
Similar methylation pattern distances between crypt pairs
regardless of proximity are consistent with long-lived
crypts. Exact crypt lifetimes cannot be inferred with the
current analysis but are likely greater than average intervals for stem cell niche succession (estimated at eight
years [11]), and possibly most crypts survive a lifetime as
intact structural units. However, the intercrypt methylation patterns are also consistent with extremely long
human crypt fission cycles, which have been estimated to
occur every nine to 18 years [4,6,8].

Long-lived human crypts may reflect stem cell niche biology. Multiple stem cells per crypt niche may help ensure
lifelong crypt survival because stem cell losses are readily
and normally replaced. Therefore, crypts are more physically defined by niches that survive a lifetime rather than
their stem cells that turnover. Consistent with niches
defined by their surroundings rather than their contents,
recent studies reveal Drosophila niches persist even when
their germ cell inhabitants are depleted [22].
Methylation patterns of branched crypts were significantly
more diverse than individual crypts and similar to crypt
pairs. This finding may be consistent with a crypt cycle in
which fission occurs after there is an increase in the
number of crypt stem cells [5,6] because methylation pattern diversity correlates with stem cell number [12]. Consistent with the low frequencies of branched crypts in
normal adult colons [8], most single crypts appear not to
be near such a fission threshold as measured by methylation patterns. A number of other scenarios could also
account for the higher diversity of branched crypts including crypt fusion (unrelated crypts that merge) and stalled
or long-lived fission intermediates. Further studies with
more crypts and sequences will be needed to distinguish
between these possibilities.
Comparisons of directly adjacent crypt pairs are limited
by random sampling. Multiple crypts surrounded each
crypt, and even if two adjacent crypts were recently
related, it would be difficult to sample the appropriate
partners. Our studies of 15 adjacent crypt pairs suggest
most crypt pairs will be unrelated, consistent with low frequencies of somatically acquired human crypt clusters.
For example somatic mutations in O-acetyltransferase
may be identified by PAS staining in appropriate heterozygous individuals [23]. Such mutations serve as fate
markers as they are likely to be neutral and inherited.
Consistent with our conclusion that most adjacent crypts
are not recently related, more than 75% of O-acetyltransferase mutant crypts are single crypts, although small clusters (typically two or three mutant crypts) were also
observed [23]. O-acetyltransferase mutations may occur
throughout life and patches of stained cells may reflect
expansion events of various ages.

Conclusions
An approach based on methylation pattern comparisons
can potentially infer ancestral relationships between
human crypts. With aging, crypts become mosaic with
respect to methylation patterns. Initial findings are consistent with generally accepted colon crypt physiology –
widely separated and most directly adjacent adult crypts
are not closely related [23], branched crypts are different
from single crypts and represent possible fission intermediates [5,6], and crypts maintained by niches containing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/4/8

multiple stem cells [12,14-16]. Most crypts appear to be
long-lived structures, consistent with an ability to observe
clonal patches established before birth in adult colons [9].
Of note, ancestries based on sequences are inherently controversial [24], and the same general objections to species
phylogenetic studies likely apply to our somatic cell trees.
Although the exact interpretation of methylation patterns
may be problematic [21], sequences are increasing used to
infer ancestral relationships, especially when (like in
human colon) few other alternatives exist. Ancestry may
potentially be completely inferred from sequences,
although a synthesis with morphologic markers will likely
yield a better understanding of evolutionary relationships
[24]. Molecular species phylogenies are continuously
refined with more sequences and better analytic methods.
Similarly, studies with more loci or other quantitative
models may further refine somatic cell trees of normal
and diseased human colon.
