Abstract
Background: Bothrops atrox is responsible for the majority of snakebite accidents in the Brazilian
Amazon region. Previous studies have demonstrated that the biological and pharmacological
activities of B. atrox venom alter with the age of the animal. Here, we present a comparative
proteome analysis of B. atrox venom collected from specimens of three different stages of
maturation: juveniles, sub-adults and adults.
Results: Optimized conditions for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) of pooled venom
samples were achieved using immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gels of non-linear 3–10 pH range
during the isoelectric focusing step and 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels in the second
dimension. Software-assisted analysis of the 2-DE gels images demonstrated differences in the
number and intensity of spots in juvenile, sub-adult and adult venoms. Although peptide mass
fingerprinting (PMF) failed to identify even a minor fraction of spots, it allowed us to group spots
that displayed similar peptide maps. The spots were subjected to a combination of tandem mass
spectrometry and Mascot and MS BLAST database searches that identified several classes of
proteins, including metalloproteinases, serine proteinases, lectins, phospholipases A2, L-amino
oxidases, nerve growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factors and cysteine-rich secretory
proteins.
Conclusion: The analysis of B. atrox samples from specimens of different ages by 2-DE and mass
spectrometry suggested that venom proteome alters upon ontogenetic development. We
identified stage specific and differentially expressed polypeptides that may be responsible for the
activities of the venom in each developmental stage. The results provide insight into the molecular
basis of the relation between symptomatology of snakebite accidents in humans and the venom
composition. Our findings underscore the importance of the use of venoms from individual
specimen at various stages of maturation for the production of antivenoms.

Background
The genus Bothrops (family Viperidae) comprises several
species of pit vipers inhabiting the American continent
from Mexico to Argentina [1]. Bothrops atrox species are
responsible for the majority of snakebite accidents in the
Brazilian Amazon region [2]. In humans, Bothrops atrox
envenomation causes local effects such as swelling, local
hemorrhage and necrosis besides systemic effects, including alterations in blood coagulation and various types of
bleeding distant from the bite site [3]. Perturbed blood
hemostasis and thrombosis are largely caused by proteinases, especially metallo- and serine- proteinases that are
the major components of Bothrops snake venoms [4].
Among other factors, the composition of snake venoms is
affected by the age of the animals. A comparative study of
the proteinase activity and protein profiles of venoms
from juvenile, sub-adult and adult Bothrops atrox specimens captured in the Brazilian Amazon rain forest was
previously reported [2]. López-Lozano et al demonstrated
that venoms from juveniles and sub-adults displayed
higher human plasma clotting activity compared to adult
venoms. In addition, SDS-PAGE and HPLC venom protein profiles varied among the three developmental stages
analyzed. Two proteins of 23 kDa and 50 kDa, respectively, that were present in higher amounts in adult venoms, were identified as metalloproteinases.
An independent study of B. atrox specimens from the
Colombian Amazon rain forest showed that venoms of
newborn and juvenile specimen caused higher lethality
and possessed higher hemorrhagic and coagulant activities, than adult venoms. The differences in activity were
attributed to the increased amount of high molecular
mass proteins, probably also metalloproteinases [5].
Taken together, these and other published evidence indicated that changes in the venom proteome during ontogenetic development can influence its biological activity.
Here we report a comparative proteome analysis of B.
atrox venoms from juvenile, sub-adult and adult specimens that identified proteins whose differential expression during ontogenetic development may be correlated
to the previously reported properties of the venom [2,5].

Results
In order to optimize 2-DE separation of B. atrox venom
proteins, linear and non-linear 3–10 pH gradients were
tested in the isoelectric focusing (IEF) step. The non-linear
gradient, developed to improve resolution of acidic proteins, provided better resolution of spots than linear pH
gradient since many spots consisted of polypeptides displaying isoelectric points (pI) between 4 and 7 (data not
shown). Two types of electrophoresis equipment – Multiphor II and IPGphor from GE Healthcare- were tested for

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/4/1/11

the IEF step and both provided similar 2-DE maps (data
not shown). On the other hand, for the second dimension, gradient gels (10–20% T) provided better 2-DE
maps than 12% T gels, especially for proteins with molecular masses around 14 kDa (data not shown).
Patterns of protein spots visualized by silver staining were
different between pooled venom samples from juvenile,
sub-adult and adult B. atrox (Fig. 1). Their computerassisted image analyses detected 110 spots in the gels from
juveniles, 101 in sub-adults and 86 in adult venoms.
Among the detected spots, 44 were found specifically in
juveniles, 22 in sub-adults and 22 in adults. Image analysis also pinpointed substantial differences in the relative
abundance of several spots matched at all three images
(Table 1).
The identification of proteins was initially attempted by
N-terminal sequencing of the proteins blotted to a PVDF
membrane using Edman degradation. Because of the relatively low sensitivity of Edman degradation reliable peptide sequences were retrieved only from the most
abundant spots. For instance, the group of seven spots of
23 kDa, more abundant in adults (group D, Fig. 1), presented the same N-terminal sequence (TPEQQRYVELLXVVD), where X stands for an undetermined amino acid.
This sequence was 73 % identical to a fragment of the 23
kDa metalloproteinase bothrolysin [sptrembl: P20416] (1
TPEHQRYIELFLVVD 15) and to an internal sequence of
the 50 kDa metalloproteinase bothrostatin [sptrembl:
Q98SP2] (188 TPEHQRYIELFLVVD 202), both from B.
jararaca. However, Edman sequencing failed to identify a
52 kDa polypeptide that was detected as the most abundant spot in the 2-DE map of adult venom (group A, Fig.
1).
In-gel digests of non-identified spots were further analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). Only a few
full length sequences of B. atrox proteins are currently
available in a database, and therefore it is not surprising
that PMF searches did not provide significant scores for
any of the 2-DE spots present in the gels. However, this
approach allowed us to group spots whose peptide mass
fingerprints were similar. Based on the PMF data, all spots
were arranged in 27 groups. The 2-DE maps of juveniles,
sub-adults and adults showing the groups containing
spots with similar PMF spectra are shown in Fig. 1. All
groups were found in juvenile venom gels while adult gels
displayed only 13 groups, revealing significant changes of
B. atrox venom proteome during ontogenetic development.
One spot of each group was submitted to protein sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry followed by Mascot and
MS BLAST database searches (Fig. 2), which enabled

MS BLAST identification of a spot from group Y. Panel A: nanoES mass spectrum of the unseparated in-gel tryptic digest.
Peaks of trypsin autolysis products are designated with "T". Peptide precursor ions, whose tandem mass spectra were acquired
and interpreted are designated with corresponding m/z and charge (in parenthesis). Panel B: MS/MS spectrum of the precursor ion with m/z 744.77 (designated with asterisk in panel A). De novo sequencing was performed by considering mass differences between the adjacent peaks in the series of fragments that belong to the ions containing C-terminal amino acid residue
(y-ions), starting from high m/z region of the spectrum. The sequence shown in the panel was deduced by considering the most
abundant fragment ions and was not necessarily correct; a few optional variants of interpretations based on the low abundant
fragments and arriving to the typical tryptic C-terminus (K) were possible. All sequence candidates for used in a single MS
BLAST search. Panel C: MS BLAST query that comprises all sequence proposals obtained by the interpretation of all tandem
mass spectra were assembled in an arbitrary order and spaced by a minus (gap) symbol. B stands for a generic trypsin cleavage
site (R or K) preceding peptide sequences and is introduced if it was possible to read out the sequence until the very N-terminus of the peptide. Panel D: The top confident hit of MS BLAST search. The search also reported a few homologous proteins

Given that very few sequences of B. atrox proteins are
available in a sequence database, the best matches of MS
BLAST database searches corresponded to proteins found
in venoms of other snakes, mostly of the Bothrops genus
(Table 1). Since several snake venom proteins share high
sequence similarity and peptides analyzed by MS/MS
cover only a small fraction of their sequences, it was not
possible to unequivocally determine the protein homologues from the sequenced species. MS/MS analysis of the
spot with apparent MW of 52 kDa (group A, Fig. 1 and
Table 1) that was present in similar quantities in adult,
sub-adult and juvenile gels is presented here as an example. MS/MS sequencing identified it as a member of the PIII class Zn-metalloproteinase. The best matches corresponded to the jararhagin and bothropasin, high molecular mass metalloproteinases from B. jararaca, which share
approximately 95% of sequence identity. One of the
determined sequences (KINPFR) is present in bothropasin, but not in jararhagin and another (BMYELANIVNEIFR) shares 100% identity with jararhagin only,
because there is a substitution (F→ L) in bothropasin. The
remaining peptide sequences (Table 1) are present in both
bothropasin and jararhagin. Therefore, the 52 kDa spot is
unequivocally related to a metalloproteinase from the PIII class that is homologous, albeit is different from both
bothropasin and jararhagin.
The proteins from group C, whose molecular masses are
similar to those of group A, were identified as metalloproteinases of the P-III class, albeit having higher pI values
(7.1–7.5 comparing to pI 5 of group A). They share two
peptide sequences (BKIPCAPEDVK and BGMVLPGTK)
with the polypeptides from group A. Two other sequences

Group D, one of the most prominent groups of spots in
adult gels, comprised several isoforms of approximately
23 kDa and pI range between 5.3 and 6.4 (Fig 3). On the
other hand, only two of these spots (in very low amounts)
were detectable on silver stained gels of juvenile venom.
Comparison of the three gels suggested that the concentration of 23 kDa isoforms increased during ontogenetic
development (Fig. 3). N-terminal sequences of these proteins were determined by Edman degradation and the
proteins were found to be homologous to bothrolysin
and bothrostatin metalloproteinases (see above). MS
BLAST searches with a query composed of peptide
sequence proposals obtained by the de novo interpretation
of MS/MS spectra produced as best hit a P-II class metalloproteinase from B. insularis. Snake venom metalloproteinases with molecular masses 23–25 kDa, which are
composed by a sole metalloproteinase domain, are usually assigned to the P-I class [4,6]. Some P-I class proteins
are produced by proteolytic processing of P-II metalloproteinases, which are larger and contain a desintegrin-like
domain besides the metalloproteinase domain [7]. Therefore, proteolytic processing could explain the high similarity of proteins from group D with P-II class
metalloproteinases. The spots from group D probably correspond to the 23 kDa polypeptide previously purified
from B. atrox venom that constituted a single band in SDSPAGE [2]. Further ESI-MS experiments suggested that
there were at least three isoforms of this protein in the B.
atrox venom [2]. Here, 2-DE gels were able to resolve at
least seven isoforms in the venom of adults. Image analyses of the gels showed a remarkable increase in the volume of group D spots from juveniles to adults.
The group L comprised at least seven isoforms that were
abundant in juvenile, less abundant in sub-adult and
undetectable in adult venoms. They were homologous to
berythractivase, a 78 kDa P-III class metalloproteinase
found in B. erythromelas that is a protrombine activator
that possess a high pro-coagulant activity [8].
The proteins from group M were also identified as metalloproteinases and were not detected in adults. These proteins were homologous to BOJUMET II from B. jararacusu
as well as to berythractivase. Although the proteins from
groups L and M were both homologous to berythractivase, PMF and MS/MS data indicated that they were, in
fact, different proteins rather than post-translationally
modified forms of the same gene.

Another group of spots (B) with molecular mass range of
55–61 kDa contained several isoforms present in similar
amounts in the three different venom samples. Their
sequences were homologous to apoxin I, a L-amino oxidase (LAO) from Crotalus adamanteus. LAO are major
components of snake venoms that cause cell death by
apoptosis [9].
The proteins from the groups E, N, Q and R were identified as serine proteinases. The snake venom serine proteinases possess thrombin-like activity and several of them
have been isolated from bothropic venoms [4].
Proteins belonging to the class of Cysteine Rich Secretory
Proteins (CRISP) were identified in group F and displayed
similar expression in the three developmental stages analyzed. The CRISPs are found in epididimus and granular
cells of mammals and seem to act in cell maturation of
spermatozoa and cells from immune system, though the
exact function of these proteins is unknown [10]. Members of CRISP family isolated from snake venoms, such as
ablomin and trifilin, are responsible for blocking of
smooth muscles contractions induced by depolarization.
Immunological screening using anti-triflin antiserum
identified CRISPs in different snake venoms, although the
cross-reactivity was relatively low for the only member of
the Bothrops (B. jararaca) genus tested [10].
In the low molecular mass range (12–15 kDa), several
phospholipases A2 (PLA2) and C-type lectins were found.
Within these groups, we identified at least four variant
sequences of the same peptide stretch present in PLA2
(VAVLCFR, AAAVCFR, VAATCFR and VAVLYSR) indicating a high degree of polymorphism for these enzymes.
Other examples of polymorphic peptide sequences were
observed in groups W (more expressed in juveniles and
sub-adults) and I (adult specific). MS BLAST searches produced as best hits the alpha chain of the C-type lectin
bothrocetin, although the sequence of their peptides and
the PMF analysis showed that they contained different
proteins. C-type lectins were also identified as the major
component in groups U and V. Interestingly, groups H
(adults) and S (juveniles), despite having similar pI,
molecular weight and some peptide sequences, actually
contained different C-type lectins.
Proteins homologous to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from Bothrops insularis were detected in group
X and their abundance decreased during ontogenetic
development (Fig. 1). VEGFs from snake venoms are
known to enhance the vascular permeability and play an
important role in the initial stages of envenoming by Bothrops. It is assumed that snake venom VEGFs, dstimulate
the distribution of the venom favouring both local and
systemic actions [11].

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/4/1/11

Group Z displayed only one detectable spot that was
present in juveniles and absent from adults. It was identified as a mixture of a nerve growth factor (NGF) and a Ctype lectin. NGF belongs to a family of neurotrophic factors, which are endogenous soluble proteins regulating
survival, growth morphological plasticity or synthesis of
proteins for differentiated functions of neurons. In addition, there is increasing evidence that NGF activities are
not restricted to the nervous system, but also affect nonneuronal cells, especially those of haematopoietic stem
cell origin. NGF was previously described in the three
main families of venomous snakes (Viperidae, Crotalidae
and Elapidae). The ubiquitous presence of NGF in snake
venoms suggests a toxinological importance of that protein in a sense of direct toxic action, indirect toxic action
or an activity in the context of prey digestion [12].

Discussion
The proteome composition of snake venom alters with
age and therefore the developmental stage of the organism, which donated the specimen, should be taken into
account. To this end, we performed a comparative analysis of B. atrox venom proteome in three stages of maturity.
To our knowledge, this is the first proteome analysis of
snake venoms associated with the ontogenetic development, although other proteomic studies on snake venom
have been published previously [13,14].
In a typical proteomic routine, proteins are separated by
2-DE, visualized by silver or Coomassie blue staining [15]
and protein spots in-gel digested with trypsin [16]. An
aliquot of the digest is subjected to PMF by MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry. If no conclusive identification is
achieved, tryptic peptides are then extracted from the gel
matrix and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry [17].
However, in both protein identification approaches it is
required that the exact sequence of the analyzed protein is
available in a database. Nevertheless, only a small number
of B. atrox proteins are currently available in a sequence
database and therefore the scope of protein identification
was very limited. To address this issue, we complemented
conventional protein identification methods, which are
based on the exact matching of tandem mass spectra to
database sequences, with sequence-similarity searches.
The latter approach enabled confident identification of
unknown proteins that only distantly related to known
proteins from other species [18-20]. Using a combination
of stringent and sequence-similarity database searches, we
identified all major components of venoms and mapped
out changes in the abundance of individual protein components in ontogenetically altered proteomes.
The natural polymorphism of the protein sequences,
together with the absence of a complete and annotated
snake genome, which could be used as a referenceid not

allow the unambiguous assignment of the most related
protein homologues due to the low sequence coverage.
However, the group-specific assignment, based on the
peptide sequences, was always reliable.

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/4/1/11

polypeptides that may be responsible for the diverse activities of the venom in each developmental stage analyzed.

Based on peptide mass fingerprinting analysis we classified the spots of the 2-DE maps in 27 groups. Most groups
and those with larger number of spots corresponded to
proteinases (metallo and serine proteinases). This result
agrees with the fact that venoms from Bothrops species are
haemotoxic and promote haemorrhaging primary to
extensive local swelling and necrosis [14].

The proteome of any biological sample is expected to
dynamically change in response to external stimuli. The
changes in the B. atrox venom proteome reported here
reinforce the need to intensify the studies on organisms in
different stages of maturation. This procedure may lead to
the discovery of a wider group of molecules of biotechnological and medical interest, as well as to better understanding of important biological traits of the organism
during its ontogenetic development.

The proteome maps also enabled the identification of
new groups of potential ontogenetic molecular markers.
For instance, we found that some groups of proteins
including P-III class metalloproteinases (L, M, O and P),
serine proteinases (N, Q and R) are more abundant in
juvenile specimens, while metalloproteinases from class
P-I (group D) are more expressed in adults.

Finally, intra-species variations in the composition of
snake venom during ontogenetic development prompts
further studies of the relationship between symptomatology of snake bite accidents in humans with the venom
composition as well as the use of venoms from individual
specimen of various ages for the production of antivenoms.

Overall, more groups of proteins were identified in the
proteome maps from juveniles, than in adults. Proteome
maps from sub-adults contained spots from both juveniles and adults, along with a few stage-specific spots. Previous work suggested that the B. atrox venoms from young
individuals trigger more potent biological effects than
adult venoms [2,5]. The decrease in hemorrhagic activity
in B. atrox venoms during ontogenetic development may
be explained by the lower levels of Zn-metalloproteinases
of P-III class in adults comparing to juveniles. On the
other hand, the higher concentration of berythractivase, a
pro-thrombin activator, may reflect the higher coagulant
activity of juvenile venoms. The effect of VEGFs, NGFs and
CRISPs, all more expressed in young specimens, certainly
also contribute to the higher pharmacological activities of
the juvenile venom.

Methods

The diversity in the protein composition and biological
activity of snake venom during growth may be related to
adaptation by evolutionary processes to the type and size
of the prey [21-24]. Young Bothrops snakes preferentially
eat amphibians, lizards, birds, and shift to mammals
when they become adults [25]. Therefore, the qualitative
and quantitative changes in the B. atrox venom proteome
are most likely related to the survival of the snake by prey
adaptation.

Conclusion
We have established proteome maps for the venom of B.
atrox in three different developmental stages, i.e. juvenile,
sub-adult and adult. Analysis of the proteome maps confirmed that B. atrox venom proteome alters significantly
with aging of the animal. Moreover, we have verified the
existence of stage specific and differentially expressed

Snake venoms
Venoms were obtained from wild Bothrops atrox specimens with no known litter relationships, captured in
Manaus region (Amazonas State, Brazil), and maintained
in the Herpetarium of the Gerência de Animais Peçonhentos-IMT-AM, Manaus. Classification of B. atrox snake specimens was done based on the total lenght of wild
specimens according to Martins and Oliveira (1998) [26].
Therefore, three size classes were defined: juveniles (≤ 40
cm), sub-adults (> 40 – 70 cm), and adults (> 70 cm).
Twenty days after the snakes were captured and before
their first feeding in captivity, the venoms were manually
milked by massaging the venom glands of specimens
longer that 50 cm, and with the aid of a Pasteur pipette on
snakes smaller than 50 cm. A single extraction was performed for each specimen. Three types of pooled venom
samples were prepared, juvenile, comprising venoms of
eight specimens, sub-adult, corresponding to twenty five
specimens and adult, a mixture of venoms of twelve specimens. The pooled venom samples were centrifuged, filtered, lyophilized, weighted and stored at -20°C.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
Freeze dried pooled venom samples (100 µg for silver
stained gels and 300 µg for Coomassie blue stained gels)
were solubilised in 370 µL of 2-DE sample buffer (7M
urea, 2M thiourea, 1% DTT, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% Pharmalyte 3–10) containing proteinase inhibitors (100 µM
PMSF, 1 µM pepstatin A and 5 mM EDTA) and applied to
18 cm IPG gel strips (GE Healthcare, Upsala, Sweden)
containing linear or non-linear 3–10 pH gradient by ingel sample rehydration [27]. After 12 h of rehydration in
the sample solution, isoelectric focusing (IEF) was carried

out at 20°C using an IPGphor unit (GE Healthcare) in
three successive steps: 500 Vh, 1000 Vh and 32000 Vh. For
reduction and alkylation the IPG gel strips were soaked for
30 min in a solution containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.8, 6 M
urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS and 125 mM DTT and for an
additional 30 min in the same buffer containing 125 mM
iodoacetamide and bromophenol blue instead of DTT.
SDS-PAGE was performed on 10–20% T polyacrylamide
gradient gels on a Protean II system (Bio Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA) connected to a Multitemp II cooling bath (GE
Healthcare). Electrophoresis was carried out at constant
current (25 mAmp per gel) at 20°C until the dye front
reached the lower end of the gel.
2-DE gels containing 100 µg of venom were silver stained
[28] and submitted to image analysis. Alternatively, 2-DE
gels containing 300 µg of venom were stained with 0.1%
(w/v) Coomassie Blue in 40% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v)
acetic acid and distained with the same solution without
Coomassie Blue.
Image analysis
Silver stained gels were scanned with a SHARP JX-330
scanner (Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi resolution and the tiff
images generated were analyzed with Image Master 2D
Elite software (GE Healthcare). Spot detection and spot
matching were performed in automated mode. Spot volumes were acquired without background subtraction and
normalized using the total intensity of the detected spots.
Protein digestion
Coomassie stained spots were excised from the preparative gel and in-gel digested with trypsin as described in
[15].
Peptide mass fingerprinting
Protein digests were first subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization on
a Bruker Reflex IV time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with Scout 384 ion source. Probes
were prepared by dried-droplet method as described previously [29]. Briefly, 1 µL aliquot of the digest was mixed
on the surface of AnchorChip™ 384/600 targets (Bruker
Daltonics, Germany) with a saturated solution of matrix
(α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) in 1: 2 (v/v) solution
of 2.5% aqueous TFA: acetonitrile. The mixture was
allowed to dry at room temperature and the entire target
was washed with 5 % formic acid.

Spots whose peptide mass fingerprints were similar, i.e.
shared more than 75% of peaks with the relative intensity
of more than 20 % within the mass accuracy of +/- 100
ppm, after removal of peaks of trypsin autolysis products
and known keratin contaminants, were grouped as shown
in Fig 1.

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/4/1/11

Sequencing by nanoelectrospray tandem mass
spectrometry
If peptide mass fingerprinting did not identify the protein,
peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 5 % formic acid and acetonitrile and the extracts were pooled
together and dried down in a vacuum centrifuge. The
digests were taken up in 5 % formic acid and analyzed by
nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a hybrid
quadrupole time-of-flight instrument QSTAR Pulsar i
(MDS Sciex, Canada) as previously described [30,31].
Database searching
Peptide mass fingerprints were used for database searching using Mascot software (Matrix Science Ltd, UK)
against the MSDB database (updated May 15, 2005; containing 2011425 protein sequence entries) downloaded
from NCBI. Mass tolerance was set to 100 ppm, spectra
were calibrated externally and no restrictions were
imposed on protein molecular mass or phylogenetic lineage. Uninterpreted tandem mass spectra were first
searched by Mascot against the above database to identify
proteins with tryptic peptides identical to database
entries. Precursor mass tolerance was set at 0.1 Da and
fragment ion mass tolerance at 0.05 Da. Hits were considered significant if their protein score exceeded the threshold score calculated by Mascot software assuming p <
0.05. Matched MS/MS spectra were further manually
inspected considering the correlation of y-, b- and a- fragment ions [32] to corresponding m/z calculated from the
peptide sequences. If still no identification was achieved,
tandem mass spectra were interpreted de novo using BioAnalyst QS software as previously described [31]. Multiple
sequence candidates were allowed per each interpreted
tandem mass spectrum and partial peptide sequences
were included into the search string. All candidate
sequences were merged into a single search string and MS
BLAST searches were performed against a non-redundant
protein database (nrdb) at http://genetics.bwh.har
vard.edu/msblast/ or http://dove.embl-heidelberg.de/
Blast2/msblast.html under default settings. Parsing script
operating at the MS BLAST web site was applied to identify
and colour code statistically confident hits according to
MS BLAST scoring scheme [20]. According to the selected
MS BLAST threshold scores of statistical confidence, the
expected rate of false positive identification was lower
than 1 %.
