new single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factor in
the regulation of trichome patterning in Arabidopsis

Abstract
Background: Single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors (single-repeat MYBs) play important roles in controlling
trichome patterning in Arabidopsis. It was proposed that single-repeat MYBs negatively regulate trichome formation
by competing with GLABRA1 (GL1) for binding GLABRA3/ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (GL3/EGL3), thus inhibiting the
formation of activator complex TTG1(TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1)-GL3/EGL3-GL1 that is required for the
activation of GLABRA2 (GL2), whose product is a positive regulator of trichome formation. Previously we identified a
novel single-repeat MYB transcription factor, TRICHOMELESS1 (TCL1), which negatively regulates trichome formation
on the inflorescence stems and pedicels by directly suppressing the expression of GL1.
Results: We analyzed here the role of TRICHOMELESS2 (TCL2), a previously-uncharacterized single-repeat MYB
transcription factor in trichome patterning in Arabidopsis. We showed that TCL2 is closely related to TCL1, and like
TCL1 and other single-repeat MYBs, TCL2 interacts with GL3. Overexpression of TCL2 conferred glabrous phenotype
while knockdown of TCL2 via RNAi induced ectopic trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels, a
phenotype that was previously observed in tcl1 mutants. These results suggested that TCL2 may have overlapping
function with TCL1 in controlling trichome formation on inflorescences. On the other hand, although the
transcription of TCL2, like TCL1, is not controlled by the activator complex formed by GL1 and GL3, and TCL2 and
TCL1 proteins are more than 80% identical at the amino acid level, the expression of TCL2 under the control of
TCL1 promoter only partially recovered the mutant phenotype of tcl1, implying that TCL2 and TCL1 are not fully
functional equivalent.
Conclusions: TCL2 function redundantly with TCL1 in controlling trichome formation on inflorescences, but they are
not fully functional equivalent. Transcription of TCL2 is not controlled by activator complex formed by GL1 and GL3, but
MIR156 controlled SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) transcription factors. However, SPLs might
require co-activators to regulate the expression of their target genes, including TCL1, TRY and possibly, TCL2.

Background
Trichome patterning in Arabidopsis is controlled by several different types of transcription factors. Based on
available evidence, it was proposed that an R2R3 MYBtype transcription factor GLABRA1 (GL1) [1], a bHLH
transcription factors GLABRA3 (GL3) [2] or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) [3], and a WD40-repeat protein TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) [4,5],
form an activator complex TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1. This

activator complex activates the expression of GLABRA2
(GL2), which encodes a homeodomain protein that promotes trichome formation in shoots [6-8]. The same activator complex also induces the expression of some
single-repeat R3 MYB genes.
So far a total of six genes in the Arabidopsis genome
have been reported encoding single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors, including TRIPTYCHON (TRY) [9,10],
CAPRICE (CPC) [11,12], TRICHOMELESS1(TCL1) [13],
and ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC1, 2 and 3 (ETC1,
ETC2 and ETC3/CPL3) [14-18]. Single-repeat MYB transcription factors are characterized by their short
sequence (75-112 amino acids) and consist largely of the

single MYB domain [19]. Single-repeat R3 MYBs can
move from a trichome precursor cell to its neighboring
cells to block the formation of the activator complex by
competing with GL1 in binding GL3 or EGL3, thus inhibiting trichome formation in shoots [8,13,18,19]. These
single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors differ in their
binding strength to GL3 and their capacity to compete
with GL1 for binding GL3. A yeast three-hybrid assays
suggested that CPC is the most potent inhibitor followed
by ETC1, TRY, ETC3 and ETC2 [18]. A protoplast transfection assay showed that TCL1 is stronger than CPC in
their ability to bind GL3 [19].
Although over expressing any of these six single-repeat
R3 transcription factors in Arabidopsis causes a glabrous
phenotype, single mutants of these genes have different
phenotypes. Mutation in TRY results in trichome cluster
phenotype [9,10], mutation in CPC increases trichome
number [11,12], and mutation in TCL1 causes ectopic trichome formation on inflorescence stems and pedicels
[13]. Mutation in ETC1, ETC2 or ETC3 does not dramatically affect trichome formation. However, analysis of double, triple and higher order mutants between these single
mutants indicated that all six single-repeat MYB transcription factors function in a highly redundant manner to control trichome formation in Arabidopsis [13-18,20].
In addition to competing with GL1 for binding GL3, our
previous results showed that TCL1 could also directly suppress the expression of GL1 [13]. Interestingly, unlike
many other single-repeat MYBs, the expression of TCL1 is
not controlled by the activator complex formed by GL1
and GL3/EGL3. Recently, it has been found that microRNA156 (MIR156)-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER
BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) 9 can activate TCL1 and
TRY expression through binding to their promoters [21].
Here we analyzed the role of TRICHOMELESS2
(TCL2), a previously uncharacterized single-repeat MYB
transcription factor in trichome patterning in Arabidopsis.
We demonstrated that TCL2, like other single-repeat
MYBs, negatively regulates trichome formation. Overexpression of TCL2 conferred glabrous phenotype while
knockdown of TCL2 via RNAi induced ectopic trichome
formation on inflorescence stems and pedicels, a phenotype that was previously observed in tcl1 mutants. Furthermore we provide genetic evidence that TCL2 and TCL1
may not be fully functional equivalent. We also showed
that MIR156 is involved in the regulation of TCL2, and
SPLs may require co-activators to regulate the expression
of their target genes, including TCL1, TRY, and possibly,
TCL2.

Results
TRICHOMELESS2 is closely related to TCL1

In Arabidopsis, a total of six single-repeat MYB transcription factors have been characterized so far [13]. In order

Page 2 of 12

to examine whether there is any uncharacterized singlerepeat MYB transcription factors, the entire amino acid
sequence of TCL1 was used as a template to BLAST Arabidopsis protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
In addition to TRY, CPC, TCL1, ETC1, ETC2 and ETC3/
CPL3 that have been reported previously, our analysis
revealed that this is another single-repeat MYB transcription factor encoded by At2g30424 in the Arabidopsis
genome. The gene encoding this uncharacterized singlerepeat MYB was designated TRICHOMELESS2 (TCL2).
TCL2 is nearby two other single-repeat MYB genes,
ETC2 and TCL1, on chromosome II (Figure 1A), with
ETC2 is a tandem repeat gene with TCL2, while TCL2
and TCL1 is separated by another gene At2g30430. Phylogenic analysis using full length protein sequences
showed that TCL2 is closely related to TCL1 (Figure 1B).
TCL2 shares 80% identify with TCL1 at the amino acid
level. As shown in Figure 1C, like TCL1 and other singlerepeat MYBs, TCL2 also contains the conserved amino
acid signature [D/E]L × 2 [R/K] × 3 L × 6 L × 3R that is
required for the interaction with R/B-like bHLH transcription factors[22] and the conserved amino acids that
have been shown to be required for the cell-to-cell movement of the single-repeat MYB transcription factor CPC
[23].
Expression and subcellular localization of TCL2

To characterize the function of TCL2, we first examined
the expression of TCL2 across various tissues and organs.
We also compared the expression pattern of TCL2 with
that of TCL1 because TCL2 is more closely related to
TCL1 than other single-repeat MYBs at the amino acid
level. Various tissues and organs of wild-type plants were
harvested, and RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of TCL2 and TCL1. We found that TCL2 is expressed
in all tissues/organs tested except young siliques, where
TCL1 is highly expressed (Figure 2). TCL2 is also highly
expressed in cotyledons, organs that normally do not produce any trichomes and where the transcript of TCL1 was
at undetectable level (Figure 2). To get more details about
when, where and in response to what stimulus TCL2 is
expressed, we then searched public available gene expression database genevestigator (http://www.genevestigator.
com/gv) using At2g30424 as gene ID, however, results
showed that there is no probeset could be found for the
gene ID provided, possibly because TCL2 is previously
unidentified gene, and no probes for this gene have been
printed on microarrays used for all those experiments that
provided data for the database.
To examine TCL2’s subcellular localization, we generated transgenic plants expressing TCL2-GFP fusion protein under the control of TCL2’s own promoter, a
genomic DNA fragment that covers the region -1502 to
+1 of the start codon of TCL2. The transgenic plant

produces reduced number of trichomes (Figure 3A), a
phenotype similar to that of PTCL1:TCL1-GFP transgenic
plant [13],indicating that the reduction in trichome number is due to an increase on the copy number of the TCL2
gene, as overexpression of TCL2 showed a greatly reduced
trichome phenotype (Figure 4). These results also indicate
that both the TCL2 promoter and TCL2-GFP fusion

protein are likely functional. By using the transgenic plants
obtained, we showed that TCL2-GFP proteins are mainly
observed in the nucleus of epidermal cells (Figure 3B).
TCL2 is a negative regulator of trichome formation

To analyze the function of TCL2 in trichome formation,
we generated transgenic plants overexpressing HA

tagged TCL2 under the control of 35S promoter (35S:
HA-TCL2). Transcript levels of TCL2 were examined by
RT-PCR using HA-specific and TCL2 specific primers
(Figure 4A). As observed previously for all other singlerepeat R3 MYB transcription factors, transgenic plants
overexpressing TCL2 resulted in glabrous phenotypes,
with no trichome formation on rosette leaves, inflorescence stems, cauline leaves or floral organs (Figure 4B).
To further analyze the function of TCL2 in trichome
formation, we sought loss-of-function alleles of TCL2. By
searching the SALK T-DNA Express Database, we found
there are four T-DNA insertion mutants that are related
to TCL2. However, in all those four lines, the T-DNA

was inserted in the promoter regions, and expression of
TCL2 is largely unaffected as examined by RT-PCR (data
not shown). As a result, all the mutants have wild-type
trichome phenotypes.
Therefore, we took RNAi approach to knock down the
expression of TCL2. Since TCL2’s ORF fragment is relative
small, only 303 bp in length, we used the full-length ORF
to create the RNAi construct. We selected three independent transgenic lines displaying ectopic trichome formation on inflorescence stems and pedicels (Figure 4B),
similar to that of tcl1 mutant [13]. RT-PCR results showed
that expression level of TCL2 in the transgenic lines was
dramatically reduced (Figure 4A), while expression of

other single-repeat MYB genes was largely unaffected (see
Additional file 1), indicating that the phenotype observed
is caused by down-expression of TCL2.

When we quantified the number of trichomes on
internodes and pedicels, we found that compared with
tcl1 mutant, there are fewer internodes and pedicels

5).
TCL2 partially rescued tcl1 mutant trichome phenotypes

Previously, we identified TCL1 as a major single-repeat
MYB transcription factor that negatively regulates trichome formation on the inflorescences and pedicels
[13]. The tcl1 mutant confers ectopic trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels. Here we
showed that transgenic plants with reduced expression
of TCL2 have similar phenotype as that of tcl1 (Figure
4B, Figure 5). Loss-of-function mutations in any other
single-repeat MYBs including TRY, CPC, ETC1, ETC2,
and ETC3 do not result in similar inflorescence and
pedicel trichome phenotypes as shown in tcl1 mutant or
TCL2RNAi lines. Therefore, we wanted to further examine the relationship between TCL2 and TCL1 in trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and
pedicels. Double mutant was generated between tcl1
and TCL2RNAi mutants, however, the double mutant

was indistinguishable from tcl1 single mutant (data not
shown), possibly because higher order redundancy function among single repeat genes [19]. Therefore we
turned to test if TCL2 could rescue tcl1 mutant phenotype. Transgenic plants were generated to express TCL2
under the control of TCL1 promoter in a tcl1 background (P TCL1 :TCL2/tcl1). Our previous results have
showed that expression of TCL1-GFP fusion protein
under the control of TCL1 promoter fully rescued tcl1
trichome phenotype [13], indicating that the TCL1 promoter used is fully functionally. As shown in Figure 5,
expression of TCL2 protein under the TCL1 promoter
only partially rescued tcl1 mutant phenotype, indicating
that TCL2 is functionally similar but not identical to
TCL1 in controlling trichome patterning on the inflorescence stems and pedicels.
TCL2 interacts with GL3

It has been proposed that single-repeat MYB transcription factors control trichome formation by competing

with GL1 for binding GL3, thus blocking the formation
of TTG1-GL3-GL1 activator complex. We have previously demonstrated that TRY, CPC, TCL1, ETC1,
ETC2, and ETC3, interact with GL3 using a protoplast
transfection system [19]. To test if TCL2 controls trichome formation using a similar mechanism, we tested
if TCL2 interacts with GL3 in plant cells.
A protoplast transient expression system was used to
test the interaction between TCL2 and GL3. A Gal4GUS reporter, together with the effectors GL3 and a
Gal4 DNA binding domain (GD) fused TCL2 (GDTCL2) were co-transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts.

GD alone and GD-TCL1 were used as negative and positive control, respectively. As shown in Figure 6A, with
or without GL3, GD alone could not activate the expression of the reporter gene. In the absence of GL3, neither
GD-TCL1 nor GD-TCL2 activated the expression of the
reporter gene presumably due to the fact that singlerepeat R3 transcription factors do not have activation
domains. However, in the presence of GL3, both GDTCL2 and GD-TCL1 activated the reporter gene, indicating that TCL2 interacts with GL3 in plant cells. It
should be noted that GL3 can function as a transcriptional activator, however, alone it cannot be recruited to

the expression of GL1 [13]. Because TCL2 is more closely related to TCL1 than any other single-repeat MYBs
at the amino acid level (Figure 1) and TCL2RNAi lines
displayed similar inflorescence and pedicels trichome
phenotypes as tcl1 mutants, we then tested if TCL2 also
affects the expression of GL1. As shown in Figure 6B,
expression level of GL1 is dramatically reduced in 35S:
HA-TCL2 seedlings, similar to that in 35S:HA-TCL1
seedlings, suggesting that TCL2 can also suppress the
expression of GL1.
Neither GL1-GL3 activator complex nor SPLs alone
activates TCL2

Available evidence suggested that TTG1-GL3-GL1 activator complex activates both GL2 and some single-repeat
MYB genes. Our previous reporter showed that GL1 and
GL3 are required and sufficient to activate GL2 and a subset of single-repeat MYB genes including TRY, CPC, ETC1
and ETC3, but not ETC2 and TCL1[19,20]. To test if
TCL2 is regulated by GL1-GL3 complex, GL1 and GL3
were co-transfected into protoplasts and RT-PCR was
used to examine the expression of TCL2. Expression of
CPC was used as a positive control. As expected, CPC was
strongly induced by GL1 + GL3. However, such activation
was not observed for TCL2 (Figure 7A).
We wanted to further investigate the molecular
mechanism controlling the activation of TCL2 transcription. Recently, it has been showed that TCL1 is directly
activated by MIR156 directed SPLs [21]. In order to
explore the possibility that expression of TCL2 may also
be controlled by MIR156 directed SPLs, we tested the
expression of TCL2 in 35S:MIR156 plant. Indeed, we

the Gal4 DNA binding elements in the reporter gene
[20]. It was also observed that the expression of the
reporter gene activated by GD-TCL2 in the presence of
GL3 is much higher than that of GD-TCL1 (Figure 6A),
implying that the binding affinity between TCL2 and
GL3 may be higher than that between TCL1 and GL3.
TCL2 suppresses the expression of GL1

In addition to competing with GL1 for binding GL3, we
also reported previously that TCL1 can directly suppress

Gan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:176

found that the expression level of TCL2 in 35S:MIR156
plant was dramatically reduced (Figure 7B), similar to
that of TCL1 [21]. To further test if SPLs can directly
active TCL2, we cloned five SPL genes including SPL3,
SPL9, SPL10, SPL13 and SPL15, transiently expressed
them in protoplasts, and then used RT-PCR to examine
the expression of TCL2. The five SPLs were chosen
because all of them but SPL15 have been shown to regulate trichome formation [21], while SPL15 is closely
related to SPL9 [24]. To our surprise, no significant
changes were observed (data not shown). Since overexpression of SPLs in plants has already been shown to
be able to induce the expression of TCL1, and SPL9 has
been shown to directly bind to the promoter region of
TCL1 [21], we test if the expression of TCL1 in protoplasts transfected with SPLs is affected. However, we did
not see any significant changes (data not shown). These
results suggested that SPLs alone may not be sufficient to
activate the expression of TCL1. To explore this possibility further, all five SPLs cloned were fused with GD and
co-transfected with Gal4:GUS reporter gene into protoplasts, then GUS activities were assays. Indeed, none of
the five SPLs tested could activate the reporter gene (data
not shown). These results indicated that although SPLs
can bind directly to the promoter region of TCL1, they
might require co-activators to regulate the expression of
their target genes, including TCL1, TRY and possibly,
TCL2.

Discussion
TCL2 is a negative regulator of trichome formation

In this study we analyzed the function of TCL2, a previously uncharacterized single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factor in trichome formation in Arabidopsis. We
showed that TCL2, like TCL1, TRY, CPC, ETC1, ETC2
and ETC3, act as a negative regulator for trichome formation. Overexpression of TCL2 under the control of the
CaMV 35S promoter resulted in a glabrous phenotype
(Figure 4). Knockdown of TCL2 via RNAi (TCL2RNAi)
resulted in ectopic trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels (Figure 4), while the number and
patterning of trichomes on leaves were largely unaffected,
a phenotype similar to that of tcl1 [13]. These results suggest that TCL2 negatively regulates trichome formation
and that TCL2 may have overlapping function with TCL1
in controlling trichome formation on the inflorescence
stems and pedicels.
We also showed that expression of TCL2 under the control of the TCL1 promoter in a tcl1 mutant background
(PTCL1:HA-TCL2/tcl1) could only partially rescue the trichome phenotype of the tcl1 mutant. Trichomes were still
present on the inflorescence stems and pedicels of PTCL1:
TCL2/tcl1 plants, although the frequency was significantly
reduced (Figure 5). On the other hand, expression of

Page 9 of 12

TCL1 under the control of the TCL1 promoter in tcl1
mutant background fully rescued the trichome phenotype
of the tcl1 mutant [13]. These results implied that TCL2
and TCL1 may function redundantly to control trichome
development on inflorescence stems and pedicels but their
function may not fully interchangeable.
Although transcript of TCL2 is detectable in roots
(Figure 2), all the mutants tested including TCL2 overexpressor, TCL2RNAi and PTCL1:TCL2/tcl1 are largely
indistinguishable from wild type in term of root hair
formation (data not shown). However, we could not rule
out the possibility that TCL2 may play a role in regulating root hair formation, a higher order combination of
mutations in single repeat MYBs may help clarify the
exact role of TCL2 in root formation.
How does TCL2 regulate trichome formation

Previous research has pointed out that trichome formation
is regulated by an activator/inhibitor feedback system
[7,10,19,25]. TTG1, GL1, and GL3 or EGL3 form an activator complex (TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1) that initiates trichome development by activating GL2. The same
activator complex also activates some single-repeat R3
MYB transcription factor genes, whose products, in turn,
compete with GL1 for binding GL3/EGL3, thus inhibiting
the formation of the activator complex. Our previous
study suggested that TCL1 could also directly suppress the
expression of GL1, providing another negative feedback
loop on the regulation of trichome formation [13]. By
using a protoplast transfection system, we showed that
TCL2 interacts with GL3 (Figure 6A), suggesting that
TCL2 could block the formation of the activator complex
required for trichome formation (see Additional file 2).
RT-PCR results showed that expression of GL1 is dramatically reduced in the plants overexpressing HA-TCL2, indicating the TCL2 can also suppress the expression of GL1.
These results suggest that TCL2 negatively regulate trichome formation in a manner similar to that of TCL1 (see
Additional file 2). However, we could not rule out the possibility that TCL2 may also regulate trichome formation
through other mechanisms, since our recent results
showed that single-repeat MYBs may regulate trichome
formation independent of GL2 [26].
Regulation of TCL2

Available evidence supports that TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1
activator complex plays an important role in regulating trichome formation. Recently, several phytohormones, such
as jasmonic acid (JA), gibberellins (GAs) and cytokinins
are found to be involved in the promotion of trichome formation, and this promotion is mediated, at least in part, by
transcriptional regulation of the components of TTG1GL3/EGL3-GL1 complex [27-30], providing further support for the critical role of the activator complex in the

Gan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:176
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/176

regulation of trichome formation. In addition to regulating
the expression of GL2 to promote trichome formation, the
activator complex also activates some single-repeat MYB
genes to provide a negative feedback loop. Available evidence suggested that the transcription of CPC, TRY,
ETC1, and ETC3, but not TCL1 and ETC2, is regulated by
the proposed activator complex [19,31], implying that
other pathways may also be involved in the regulation of
single-repeat MYB genes. Recently, it has been showed
that MIR156-regulated SPLs, which promote phase transition, directly activate TCL1 and TRY expression through
binding to their promoters and that this activation is independent of GL1[21].
Using protoplast transient expression system, we found
that the expression of TCL2 is not regulated by TTG1GL3/EGL3-GL1 complex (Figure 7A). Reduced expression
of TCL2 in 35S:MIR156 transgenic plants suggested that
MIR156-targeted SPLs may also regulate the expression of
TCL2 (Figure 7B). However, when expressed in protoplasts, none of the five SPLs tested could induce the
expression of neither TCL2 nor TCL1. Further test suggested that SPLs alone could not activate reporter gene
expression when recruited to the promoter region of the
reporter gene by a fused DNA binding domain. These
results indicated that there might be other co-activator
working together with SPLs to regulate the expression of
TCL1, and possible TCL2 (see Additional file 2). It is also
possible that unidentified targets of MIR156 may involve
in the regulation of single-repeat MYB genes.

(plantmedia) and 1% (w/v) sucrose. Seedlings used for
phenotypic analysis were obtained either by plating seeds
on 1/2 MS medium or by directly sowing seeds into soil.
Plants were grown at 22 C with 14/10 hour photoperiod
at approximately 120 μmol m-2 s-1.
Constructs

Conclusions
In this report, we identified TCL2 as a new member of
single-repeat MYB transcription factor family, and provided evidence to show that TCL2 is a negative regulator
of trichome development. We showed that TCL2 may
have overlapping function with TCL1 to regulate trichome
formation, but its function is not fully interchangeable
with TCL1. Furthermore, we showed that TCL2 interact
with GL3 in plant cells, its expression is not regulated by
GL3/GL1 activator complex, and that MIR156 is involved
in the regulation of TCL2. Finally, we found that although
SPLs can bind directly to the promoter region of TCL1,
they likely require co-activators to regulate the expression
of their target genes, including TCL1, TRY, and possibly,
TCL2.

35S:GD-TCL1, 35S:HA-GL3 have been described previously [13]. To generate HA or GD tagged constructs for
TCL2, SPL3, 9, 10, 13 and 15, the full-length open-reading
frames (ORF) of corresponding genes were amplified by
RT-PCR using RNA from 10-day-old light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, then the PCR products were cloned in
frame with an N-terminal HA or GD tag into the pUC19
vector under the control of the double 35S enhancer promoter of CaMV. The PTCL2:HA-TCL2-GFP was cloned by
fusing TCL2 in frame with GFP and then subcloned into
the pUG19 vector under the control of the TCL2’s own
promoter (a fragment that covers the region -1502 to +1
of the start codon of TCL2). For plant transformation, corresponding constructs in pUG19 vector were digested with
EcoRI, then subcloned into the binary vector pPZP211 or
pPZP221 [32].
To generate TCL2RNAi construct. The TCL2 fragment was amplified by RT-PCR using forward primer
5’ -CAACTCGAGGATAACACCAACCGTCT-3’ and
reverse primer 5’-CAAGAATTCAGGAGGAGAAATAGAGA-3’, which contain an XhoI and an EcoRI enzyme
cutting site at its 5’-end respectively. The PCR product
was digested by XhoI and EcoRI and cloned into vector
pHANNIBAL. The vector contained the CaMV 35S
promoter and the nos terminator in sense orientation.
The resulting plasmid was named as pHANNIBALTCL2S. The anti-sense fragment was amplified by RTPCR using forward primer 5’-CAATCTAGAGATAACACCAACCGTCT-3’ and reverse primer 5’-CAAAA
GCTTAGGAGGAGAAATAGAGA-3’, which contain
an XbaI site and a HindIII enzyme cutting site at its
5’-end respectively. The PCR product was digested by
XbaI and HindIII and cloned into pHANNIBAL-TCL2S
plasmid, resulting pHANNIBAL-TCL2RNAi construct.
The TCL2RNAi cassette was then removed from
pHANNIBAL-TCL2RNAi by digestion with NotI, and
subcloned into binary vector pART27 for plant
transformation.

Methods

Phylogenetic analysis

Plant materials and growth conditions

Full length protein sequences of TRY, CPC, TCL1,
TCL2, ETC1, ETC2 and ETC3/CPL3 were used for phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence alignment and
dendrogram with branch length were generated using
CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence Alignment Program
with default settings (http://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/
clustalw).

The tcl1 mutant, 35S:MIR156 and 35S:HA-TCL1 transgenic plant are in the Columbia-0 (Col-0) background
[13,21]. T-DNA insertion lines related to TCL2 were
obtained from SALK Institute.
Seedlings used for RT-PCR analysis were grown on 1/2
Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium with vitamins

Plant transformation and selection of transgenetic plants

About five-week-old plants with several mature flowers
on the main inflorescence were used to transform with
various constructs via Agrobacterium tumefaciens
GV3101 by using the floral dip method [33]. Phenotypes
of transgenic plants were examined in the T1 generation, and confirmed in T2 up to T4 generations. Up- or
down-expression of corresponding genes in related lines
was confirmed by RT-PCR. For each construct, at least
three independent transgenic lines with similar phenotypes were obtained, and results from a representative
line were presented.
Plasmid DNA isolation, protoplast transfection and GUS
activity assay

Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen EndoFree
Plasmid Maxi Kit (http://www.qiagen.com). Protoplast isolation, transfection and the GUS activity assay were performed as described previously [34-36]. Briefly, protoplasts
were isolated from rosette leaves of ~4-week-old plants.
Effector and reporter plasmids were co-transfected into
protoplasts and incubated under darkness for 20-22 h.
GUS activities were measured using a BioTEK Synergy™
HT microplate reader (http://www.biotek.com). Expression of 35S:luciferase (Luc) was used to normalize the
expression of the GUS reporter. Luciferase activities were
measured using a microplate luminometer (http://www.
turnerdesigns.com) together with the Promega Steady-Glo
luciferase assay system (http://www.promega.com/).
Microscopy

Trichomes were analyzed and photographed as
described previously [13,19].
Four-day-old seedlings expressing TCL2-GFP under the
control of the TCL2 promoter were used to examine the
expression and localization of TCL2-GFP, by using a Leica
DM-6000B upright fluorescent microscope with phase and
differential interference contrast (DIC), photos were taken
using a Leica FW4000 digital camera connected to the
microscope (http://www.leica-microsystems.com).
RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from different parts of plant, seedlings or transfected protoplasts using the RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). cDNA
was synthesized using 2 μg total RNA by Oligo(dT)primed reverse transcription using OMNISCRIPT RT Kit
(QIAGEN). Some of the primers used for cloning or
examining the expression of corresponding genes have
been described previously [13,19], and others are as follows. TCL2-specific primers (5’-CATATGGATAACACCAACCGTCT-3’ and 5’-GAGCTCTTAAGGAGGAGAA
ATAG-3’) were used to amplify the full-length ORF of

TCL2. HA-specific (5’-TACCCTTACGATGTTCCT
GATTAC-3’) and TCL2-specific (5’-GAGCTCTTAAGGAGGAGAAATAG-3’) primers were used to check the
expression of HA-TCL2. TCL2RNAi-specific primers (5’GTCCTCTTTCACTTTCAAATACCAATG-3’ and 5’-CT
TAAAGCTTTTATCTTGTCC-3’) were used to check the
expression of TCL2 in TCL2RNAi transgenic plants.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Adobe Photoshop, Expression of single repeat
MYB genes in 35S:TCL2RNAi transgenic plants. RNA was isolated from
10-day-old seedlings of wild type and two independent 35S:TCL2RNAi
transgenic lines, and RT-PCR was used to check the expression of single
repeat MYB genes. Note that transcript of ETC1 was not included in the
figure because we were unable to detect the expression of ETC1 in
seedlings. The expression of ACTIN2 (ACT2) was used as a control.
Additional file 2: Adobe Photoshop, Model of the transcription factor
network that controls trichome formation in Arabidopsis. TTG1, GL3/
EGL3 and GL1 form an activator complex, to regulate the transcription of
GL2, and some of the single repeat MYB genes. Single MYB transcription
factors, in turn, compete with GL1 for binding of GL3/EGL3, thus limiting the
formation of the TTG1-GL3-GL1 activator complex. As shown in this study,
TCL2 can intact with GL3, it can also suppress the expression of GL1, thereby
limiting the transcriptional activity of the TTG1-GL3-GL1 activator complex.
Like that of TCL1, transcription of TCL2 is regulated by SPLs, however,
unknown co-activator may required for the transcriptional activation.
Question marks indicate unknown regulators or unclear processes.
