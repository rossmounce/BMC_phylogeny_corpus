Abstract
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major global public health problems. In India, HBsAg
prevalence among general population ranges from 2% to 8%, placing India in intermediate HBV
endemicity zone and the number of HBV carriers is estimated to be 50 million, forming the second
largest global pool of chronic HBV infections. India is a vast country, comprised of multiracial
communities with wide variations in ethnicity and cultural patterns, which is attributable to its
geographical location, gene influx due to invasion and/or anthropological migrations in the past.
Moreover, recent increase in trade, trafficking and use of illicit drugs has also considerably
influenced the epidemiology of HBV, specifically in the eastern and north eastern parts of India.
However, data on the molecular epidemiology of HBV in India is scanty. HBV genotypes A and D
have been well documented from different parts of mainland India. Interestingly, in addition to
genotypes A and D, genotype C having high nucleotide similarity with south East Asian subgenotype
Cs/C1 strain, have been detected exclusively from eastern Indian HBV carriers, suggesting a recent
introduction. Thus, compared to other parts of India, the molecular epidemiology of HBV is
naturally distinct in eastern India. Very recently, taking the advantage of circulation of three distinct
HBV genotypes within the population of eastern India, different aspects of HBV molecular
epidemiology was studied that revealed very interesting results. In this study, the clinical significance
of HBV genotypes, core promoter and precore mutations, possible routes of introduction of HBV
genotype C in eastern India, the clinical implications of x gene variability, prevalence of the AFB1
induced p53 gene codon 249 mutation, the transmission potentiality of HBV among asymptomatic/
inactive or occult HBV carriers and the genetic variability of HBV persisting in the PBL was
investigated. In this manuscript, the information available on the molecular epidemiology of HBV in
India has been reviewed and the results of studies among the eastern Indian population have been
summarised.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major global public
health problems. HBV infection is the 10th leading cause
of death and HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) is the 5th most frequent cancer worldwide. About
30 percent of the world's population has serological evi-

dence of current or past infection with HBV. Of these, an
estimated 350 million are chronically infected with HBV
and approximately 1 million persons die annually from
HBV-related chronic liver diseases, including severe complications such as liver cirrhosis (LC) and HCC [1].

HBV is distributed worldwide, but its prevalence varies
significantly between different populations of the world.
Based on the prevalence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)
carrier rate in the general population, sub-Saharan African, East Asian and Alaskan populations are classified as
having high HBV endemicity (HBsAg carriage > 8%),
while the populations of southern parts of Eastern and
Central Europe, the Amazon basin, the Middle East, and
the Indian subcontinent are classified as intermediate
HBV endemicity (HBsAg carriage 2–7%), and the populations in western and northern Europe, North America,
and Australia are classified as low HBV endemic (HBsAg
carriage < 2%) regions [2].

Random errors/variations in the HBV genome, occurring
due to long periods of persistence and immune selection
pressures operating at the population level have led to the
emergence of distinct genotypes and their subgenotypes
in specific geo-ethnic populations, and being transmission competent these variants stably circulate within the
given geo-ethnic population [6,13-15]. In addition, certain mutations may also emerge under medical pressures
(vaccine, or antiviral therapy), which are selected at the
individual level. During specific phases of chronic HBV
infection, mutations (e.g. 587A, 1896A, 1762T/1764A etc.)
emerge that are advantageous for escaping the natural or
therapy induced antiviral immune pressure and thus
favours viral persistence.

The HBV genome and origin of genetic diversity
HBV belongs to the virus family Hepadnaviridae (infecting
different avian and mammalian hosts), which includes
several genera of partially double stranded DNA genome
of approximately 3.2 kb length, generated through reverse
transcription from a longer intermediate RNA (approximately 3.5 kb, generally referred to as pregenomic RNA or
pgRNA) [3]. The HBV genome encodes four partially overlapped open reading frames (ORF): the surface (preS1,
preS2, S), core (precore, core), polymerase and the 'x' genes
respectively. High genetic variability is a characteristic feature of the HBV as the viral polymerase lacks proofreading
activity and uses an RNA intermediate during its replication [3,4]. On the other hand, the extreme overlapping of
the open reading frames of the HBV genome limits the
possibility of fixation of all these mutations [5]. These
opposite aspects render the substitution rate of HBV to an
intermediate level between RNA and DNA viruses [5,6].
Such a replication system makes random errors during
genomic replication, which are the source of genetic variation, upon which natural selection can act, leading to
evolution of the HBV genome [7]. The nucleotide substitution rate, for HBV has been estimated to be 1.4 – 5.0 ×
10-5 per site per year, being 10 fold superior than other
DNA viruses, but the rate of synonymous (silent) substitutions is higher than the rate of non-synonymous substitutions, suggestive of a constrained evolution of the HBV
genome [5,8,9]. In contrast, in a liver transplantation setting, the mutation rate has been found to be almost 100fold higher [10], while mutation rate is negligible in silent
or occult HBV infection, where there is minimal host
response over many decades [11]. However, Hannoun et
al., [12] calculated a mean frequency of fixation of nucleotide substitution of a wider range (2.1–25 × 10-5 nucleotide change per site per year) depending on the HBeAg/
anti-HBeAg status of the host. Thus it appears that, hostvirus interaction and immune selective pressures,
imposed by the host immune system, either naturally or
medically, can affect the variability of the HBV genome.

HBV genetic diversity: genotypes &
subgenotypes
Classically, HBV strains were distinguished by the presence of two pairs of mutually exclusive serotype determinants 'd'/'y' and 'w'/'r', in the HBsAg along with the main
antigenic determinant 'a', which led to the description of
4 serotypes, namely adw, adr, ayw or ayr. Additional serotypes were subsequently characterized leading to the
description of nine serotypes namely ayw1, ayw2, ayw3,
ayw4, ayr, adw2, adw4, adrq+ and adrq- and a distinct geographical pattern for the distribution of serotypes was also
documented [6]. However, with the advent of molecular
biological techniques and advanced computational methods for the phylogenetic analysis of complete viral
genome sequences, HBV genotypes and subgenotypes
have been described, that have largely replaced the classical serotype based classification of HBV strains.
Based on more than 8% genetic variability among HBV
strains found worldwide, eight HBV genotypes namely A,
B, C, D, E, F, G, and H have been well established [16-19].
Further extensive phylogenetic analyses of the HBV genotypes have resulted in recognition of subgenotypes of genotypes A, B, C, D and F, based on more than 4% intragenotypic divergence. Until now, the presence of 5 subgenotypes have been recognized for each of the HBV genotypes A, B, C and D, while 4 subgenotypes have been well
reported for genotype F [15]. Having evolved distinctly in
specific geo-ethnic populations, HBV genotypes/subgenotypes have a distinct geographical distribution pattern
(Figure 1).

Clinical significance of HBV genetic variability
Accumulating evidences clearly indicate that HBV genotypes/subgenotypes can significantly influence HBeAg
seroconversion rates, viremia levels, mutational patterns
that could significantly influence the heterogeneity in
clinical manifestations and even response to antiviral
therapy [13,14,20]. More fascinatingly, the emergence of
the most widely studied clinically important mutations

endemicity are shown by grey, light grey and white shades respectively.

(e.g. 1896A, 1762T/1764A etc.) that are significantly associated with HBV e antigen (HBeAg) negative chronic
infections have been shown to be subjective to the infecting HBV genotypes. The precore (PC 1896A) mutation creates a premature stop codon at position 28 precluding the
HBeAg expression and is specifically frequent among
patients infected with genotypes B, C and D [14]. The
basal core promoter (BCP) double mutations 1762T/
1764A downregulate HBeAg production and are associated with chronic HBV infection leading to HCC [21],
occur frequently among patients infected with HBV genotypes A, C and F [14]. Recent studies have also shown that
certain HBV genotypes may also influence the development of HBV vaccine escape mutants and therefore the
efficacy of HBV vaccination is dependent on the HBV genotypes of the given population [22]. Due to this nexus
between HBV genotypes and the known clinically important mutations, certain genotypes appear to be significantly associated with more severe consequences, than
others.

Owing to the distinct geographic distribution patterns of
HBV genotypes, only one or two HBV genotypes have
been reported to circulate in most of the populations studied so far. Thus most comparative studies on clinical significance of HBV genotypes among a population of
similar ethnicity have remained restricted mainly to two
distinct genotypes (genotype B versus genotype C in East
Asian countries and genotype A versus genotype D in
Europe and India) [14,23]. The results of these studies
have demonstrated marked differences in the virological,
epidemiological and clinical characteristics among the
compared genotypes. Thus molecular epidemiological
studies in geographical regions where more than two HBV
genotypes are circulating in the same population may
reveal more interesting aspects of the HBV genetic variability.
Interestingly, in addition to diverse clinical manifestations between different HBV genotypes, it has been noted
that the predominant mode of transmission varies signif-

icantly between populations. Vertical or perinatal transmission is predominant in HBV endemic East Asian
countries where HBV genotypes B and C are prevalent,
whereas horizontal transmission is the main route of
infection in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Indian subcontinent, where genotypes A and D prevail [14]. This is
more prominent in case of genotype G, as most genotype
G isolates have been isolated from homosexual men and
confined to the USA and Europe [24,25]. This raises an
important question about the genotype restricted patterns
of HBV compartmentalization and thus distinct modes of
transmission of HBV, which have important implications
in the molecular epidemiology of HBV.
Due to their characteristic geo-ethnic distribution patterns, HBV genotypes/subgenotypes has been successfully
used to correlate the population migration with shifting
epidemiology and introduction of new HBV strains in a
given region. In countries with a history of human migration, the prevalence of different HBV genotypes have been
shown to reflect the original HBV genotype distribution
among the immigrants [6,14]. Apart from human migration, certain high-risk behavioural patterns, such as intravenous drug abuse, have been reported to rapidly
influence the molecular epidemiology of HBV genotypes/
subgenotypes in a given region [26,27]. Thus the investigation and surveillance of HBV genotypes and subgenotypes, using molecular epidemiological techniques help
in tracing the routes of influx of newer strains and are thus
important for designing effective preventive strategies.

or simply by increasing the transversion frequency [35],
resulting in a specific guanine to thymine transversion
mutation in the third nucleotide position of codon 249
(AGG to AGT, leading to an arginine-to-serine substitution) in the p53 protein [36]. This mutation is considered
as a reliable biomarker for the development of HCC in
geographical regions where the chronic exposure to HBV
and dietary AFB1 are very high.
Experimental evidences have established that HBx is a
multifunctional protein with oncogenic potentials, and is
capable of interacting and modulating the normal function of a large battery of cellular factors, leading to deregulation of the normal cell activities, leading to HCC [37].
However considering the high incidence of HBV genotypes A, B or C in the high HCC incidence zones of the
world, it seems that HBx encoded by certain HBV genotypes have higher hepatocarcinogenic potentials than HBx
of other genotypes. Moreover, emergence of certain HBV
genotype associated mutations (K130M, V131I) in the x
ORF has also been shown to predict the development of
HCC [21]. Despite its importance in HCC development,
the clinical significance of the genetic variability of the x
genetic region still remains poorly understood [38].
Hence, molecular epidemiological studies targeting HBx
genetic variability and occurrence of AFB1 induced p53
mutations may be helpful in assessment and surveillance
of HCC risk in regions where chronic HBV and AFB1 exposure is high.

Epidemiology of HBV infections in India
Aetiology of HBV related HCC
HCC is one of the most malignant cancers, increasing by
estimated 5, 60,000 new cases per year, and the third
among most common cause of death among men [28].
The main causes of HCC are chronic infection with HBV,
long term dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), chronic
alcoholism, besides other causes [29]. Worldwide, the
highest incidences of HCC and the youngest patients with
this tumour are found in China, Taiwan, and sub-Saharan
Africa, each of which is hyperendemic for HBV infection
with either HBV genotypes B, C (in China, Taiwan) or
genotype A (in sub Saharan Africa) and a high rate of dietary exposure to the fungal toxin, AFB1[14,29].
From a large number of molecular epidemiological studies, persuasive evidence has now accumulated that in
HCC endemic regions, AFB1 and HBV interact synergistically in the aetiology and pathogenesis of HBV related
HCC [29-31]. Several groups have shown that one of the
gene products of HBV, the HBx binds to and inactivates
the p53 protein [32,33]. It has been experimentally demonstrated that besides physically interacting with p53,
HBx may induce inactivating mutations in the p53 gene
either by down regulating the detoxification of AFB1 [34],

Infectious diseases are a major cause of deaths in South
Asia, including India. HIV, Tuberculosis and chronic hepatitis B continue to threaten the lives of millions in India.
India now has the second largest population with AIDS
and HIV infection in the world [39], signifying the rapid
change in the epidemiology of parenterally/sexually transmitted viral infections via different modes [40,41]. High
rates of these infections in many South Asian countries are
attributable to poverty, unhygienic living conditions, illiteracy, unsafe blood supply, poor medical facilities, and
reuse of contaminated syringes, unsafe sexual practice,
and frequent use of intravenous drugs.
According to the WHO report on prevention of HBV in
India [42], HBsAg prevalence among general population
ranges from 0.1% to 11.7%, being between 2% to 8% in
most studies. HBsAg prevalence rate among blood donors
ranged from 1% to 4.7%. With the exception of higher
HBsAg positivity in some North Eastern states (~7%), no
substantial geographical variation was apparent in other
parts of India. Considering, on an average, HBsAg carrier
rate of 5%, the total number of HBV carriers in the country
was estimated to be about 50 million that forms nearly
15% of the entire pool of HBV carriers in the world and is

Virology Journal 2008, 5:156

the second largest pool of chronic HBV infections in the
world [42]. Using conservative prevalence estimates of
different HBV seromarkers for estimating the number of
HBV infections and serious disease outcomes in population, it was predicted that over 9 million are estimated to
acquire HBV infection during their lifetime, an estimated
1,507,000 will develop chronic HBV infection, and nearly
200,000 will die of acute or chronic consequences of HBV
infection [42], which clearly indicates an impending danger.
Recently, in contrast to the mainland India, very high rates
of HBsAg have been recorded among certain primitive
tribes of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Studies showed
hyperendemic HBV infection, with HBsAg carrier rates
ranging from 23.3% among the Nicobarese tribe, 37.8%
among the Shompen tribe, [43], 11.6% among the Karen
[44], and over 65% among the Jarawa tribe [45]. The
HBsAg prevalence rates among the Jarawa are the highest
ever reported in the world.
India is a vast country, comprised of multiracial communities with wide variations in culture, ethnicity, food habits, lifestyle of different communities and thus infectious
and chronic disease patterns [46]. Geographical location
of India is between West and Central Asian countries and
East Asian countries, having different HBV genotype distributions. Gene flow from these neighbouring countries,
due to anthropological migration in the past has contributed to considerable genetic, geographic and socio-cultural diversity of the Indian population [47,48]. In
addition, more than 200 years of colonial rule in India
have been suggested to have important epidemiological
implications on the genotypic distribution of HBV [49].
Genetic studies on mtDNA and Y chromosomal DNA in
the Indian population have also attested to the significant
European admixture [50]. This multiethnic origin of the
Indian populations is also reflected in the HBV genotype
distribution in different parts of the country. Moreover,
recent increase in trade, trafficking and use of illicit drugs
and frequent visits to and from different countries have
also considerably influenced the epidemiology of HBV
and other parenteral infections in India and specially in
the eastern and north eastern parts of India [51-53].

Modes of HBV transmission in India
A large study involving 8575 pregnant women from
Northern India, documented HBsAg carrier rate in antenatal mothers to be 3.7%, HBeAg carrier rate 7.8% and vertical transmission was observed in 18.6% [54]. Taking
into account the low percentage of possible vertical transmission, it appears that the potential of perinatal HBV
transmission in India is similar to Africa but lower than
that in East Asia. It has been estimated that HBV infection
is largely acquired by horizontal transmission in child-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/156

hood and perinatal transmission plays a less important
role [54,55]. A study from Eastern India demonstrated
that HBsAg prevalence among antenatal mothers attending a maternity home in Calcutta is in conformity with
national average of HBsAg prevalence (3–5%) in India
[56]. However, both HBeAg positivity (1%) and the level
of serum HBV DNA among antiHBe positive cases being
low, the infectivity status among the antenatal mothers is
assumed to be low, suggesting that perinatal transmission
of infection from mother to infants is not an important
route of HBV transmission in India [55,56].
The peaking of infection rates in adulthood in Indian population also suggests a close relationship of acquisition of
infection in the adults [57]. In an earlier study, frequent
exposure to percutaneous injuries, repeated use of
parenteral injections for trivial illnesses and the untrained
para-medical personnel, lacking in knowledge about
modes of sterilization in primary care centres have been
found to be the major factors that facilitate transmission
of HBV, as well as other viruses in this population [57].
Apart from exposure from extraneous sources, intrafamilial aggregation of HBV infected persons in a family has
been well documented in India [55]. HBsAg contamination of surfaces is widespread in homes of chronically
infected persons [58], which may explain the non-sexual
interpersonal spread of HBV such as among household
contacts. Household contacts of subjects with chronic
HBV infection are known to be at high risk of acquiring
infection through multiple modes [59]. A serological survey on 722 family members of 215 HBV infected Index
cases of eastern India revealed that intrafamilial horizontal transmission is more significant mode of transmission
than sexual mode of transmission in later life for maintaining HBV carrier pool in this community [55]. In an
another study on HBV transmission in the families of 12
chronic liver disease patients from Northern India, horizontal transmission pattern was found in 50%, vertical
transmission pattern in 17% and by both patterns in rest
of the families on the basis of homology between the viral
sequences of the members of same family [60].
Previous studies among the primitive tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar islands have shown high endemicity of
HBV infection [43]. Horizontal transmission through
close contact with carriers and perinatal routes was identified as an important mode of transmission of HBV in
these tribal communities. Besides, use of unsafe injections
represents an independent risk factor for acquiring HBV
infection in this island population [43]. Very high endemicity of HBV infection in the tribal populations have
been suggested to be due to their association with a
number of socio-culture practices like endogamy, bloodletting, scarification, and tattooing and eating of orally
processed food.

Distribution of HBV genotypes and
subgenotypes in India
HBV genotypes A and D have been well documented from
different parts of mainland India [49,61-66]. In two different studies from northern India, genotypes A and D
were found to be equally prevalent [49,62]. However,
another study from the same region reported genotype D
to be predominant with a low frequency of genotype A in
northern Indian HBV infected patients [65,66], which was
comparable to the HBV genotype distribution documented from western and southern parts of India [52,61].
In sharp contrast to rest of the parts of India, the eastern
part of India presents an interesting epidemiology of three
different HBV genotypes (genotypes A, C and D) in comparable proportions [52,63,64].
Apart from only one study on subgenotypes of genotype
A [67], there is a lack of data on the distribution of subgenotypes of HBV genotypes A and D in northern, western
and southern parts of India. Most of the available information on the distribution of HBV subgenotypes of genotype A, C and D is available from eastern India only. In the
eastern part of India, subgenotypes Aa/A1, Cs/C1, D1, D2,
and D3 are prevalent [63,64]. In addition a novel subgenotype of D, designated as D5 was identified and characterized by complete genome sequencing of HBV isolates
from Eastern India [64,15]. Based on the phylogenetic
analysis and high nucleotide sequence similarity with
south East Asian subgenotype Cs/C1 strain, genotype C
strains from eastern Indian patients was suggested to be a
recent introduction to eastern Indian population [52,63].
Thus, the eastern part of India is of great significance from
the perspective of changing scenario of HBV epidemiology with presence of three distinct genotypes of HBV and
four distinct subgenotypes of genotype D within a population with similar ethnic background. The HBV genotype
distribution reported from differen parts of india has been
shown in Figure 2.
On the other hand, in the Andaman and Nicobar islands,
genotype D among three different primitive tribes (the
Onge, the Andamanese, and the Nicobarese) was detected
and its introduction from the people of mainland India
was suggested [68]. In contrast, genotype C (subgenotype
Cs/C1) was found exclusively among the Jarawas that was
suggested to reflect their history of migration to the
islands, long back [69].

Prevalence of clinically important HBV mutants
An important aspect of the global HBV epidemiology is
the emergence and increasing significance of HBeAg negative infections as well as the distribution and significance
of HBV mutants, which are associated with suppression of
the HBeAg synthesis and persistent infection. It is well
known that the prevalence of e negative chronic hepatitis

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/156

B and its molecular basis varies geographically with the
prevalent HBV genotypes [70]. However, very little information on the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of
HBeAg negative chronic infections is available from India.
In Mediterranean populations, genotype D has been
shown to present an extremely high prevalence of HBeAg
negative chronic HBV infection, associated with HBV
mutants in the PC region. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of genotype D in Northern and western parts of
India, comparatively low prevalence of basal core promoter and precore mutant (33 – 37%) have been reported
amongst HBeAg negative chronic HBV patients [71,72].
Moreover, PC mutation has not been found to be associated with severe liver disease, rather it was shown to
favours the asymptomatic state in the western Indian population [71]. Although the prevalence of BCP mutations
among Eastern Indian patients (32.5%) was similar to
northern Indian patients (36%), but the prevalence of PC
mutation in eastern India (18%) was found to be much
lower in HBeAg negative CHB patients, compared to other
parts of India [57,73].

Incidence of HBV related HCC in India
Cancer is not a notifiable disease in India, and registration
of incident cancer cases is done by means of active case
finding. Although HCC cases are under reported in India,
but association studies on the available cases indicate that
chronic HBV infection is the most important factor
responsible for the development of HCC, in India [74].
In a comparison based study of Indian Cancer Registries
by Sen et al., [46], the incidence of HCC was found to be
very much lower in comparison to the neighbouring
countries of East Asia. An age standardized HCC incidence
rate (ASR) of 5.3 and relative frequency of 4.8% was
reported in males. However among the women, relative
frequency of 3.1% and ASR of 3.9 was documented. Moreover, a recent study found the incidence of HCC in India
to be low enough and excluded liver from the list of highrisk cancer site among Indians [75].

Interesting molecular epidemiology of HBV in
the Eastern part of India: scope of research
Thus, compared to other parts of India, the distribution
patterns of HBV genotypes/subgenotypes and mutants is
characteristically distinct in eastern part, where in addition to HBV genotypes A and D, genotype C is also present
in a comparable proportion. This genotype is suggested as
recently introduced and confined to this part of India. It
was thus interesting to determine the routes of introduction of this south East Asian strain of HBV (Cs/C1), using
molecular evolutionary techniques. The simultaneous
presence of three different genotypes in the same population of eastern India is unique, providing opportunity to
directly compare the clinical significance of HBV geno-

Virology Journal 2008, 5:156

types in disease manifestations and also in studying the
importance of clinically relevant mutants in this population.
In the eastern part of India, despite high prevalence of
chronic HBV infection and distribution of HBV subgenotype Aa/A1 and subgenotype Cs/C1, the incidence of HCC
is notably low. This is in sharp contrast to HCC prevalence
in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asian countries, where
similar genotypes and subgenotypes (Aa/A1, Cs/C1) of
HBV are prevalent. As the HBV x gene plays an important
role in development of HCC, comparison of genetic variability of the HBV x gene region of Indian HBV genotype
A and C isolates with isolates from sub Saharan Africa and
East Asian might provide important clues. However,
reports on genetic variability of HBx from other parts of
the world are extremely rare, while no reports focusing the
genetic variability of HBx from Indian HBV strains are
available. It is also interesting to look for mutations of
p53 gene, codon 249 in particular, which is significantly
associated with AFB1 exposure and HBV related HCC cases
in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asian countries. Apart
from only one account documenting extremely low occurrence of p53 gene codon 249 mutation in northern Indian
HCC patients [76], no reports are available on this aspect
from the Indian subcontinent.
With the advent of sensitive amplification based assays,
low quantities of HBV DNA have been frequently detected
in the serum or liver or peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL)
among HBsAg negative, antiHBc and/or antiHBs positive
subjects (occult HBV infection). However, specific investigation on occult HBV DNA in the PBL and associated variants is extremely scanty. In a previous study from India,
HBV DNA specifically with G145R immune escape mutation was shown to persist for long in the peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBL) of HBV infected subjects [77]. Considering the importance of this observation in the HBV compartmentalization, transmission and epidemiology,
studies focusing on the genetic variability of HBV DNA
and its relevance in long persistence in the PBL was necessary.
Taking the advantage of the distribution of three distinct
HBV genotypes within the same population of eastern
India the thesis work was aimed to (i) study the molecular
epidemiology and clinical significance of hepatitis B virus
genotypes, core promoter and precore mutations in eastern India, (ii) identify possible routes of introduction of
HBV genotype C in Eastern India, (iii) analyze the HBV x
gene variability and its implications in Eastern Indian
HBV carriers, (iv) determine the prevalence of the specific
mutation of p53 gene (at codon 249), (v) study the transmission potentiality of HBV among family members of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/156

asymptomatic/inactive HBV carriers and (vi) study the
genetic variability of HBV isolates persisting in the PBL.

Summary of the experimental results obtained
in the thesis
Geographically, eastern part of India is contiguous with
the northeastern part of India, the later being physically
and anthropologically attached to South East Asia. From
this perspective, the appearance of HBV genotype C (prevalent HBV genotype in Southeast Asian countries) in
north eastern and eastern India was well anticipated, and
thus a different epidemiology of HBV genotypes in these
regions was expected. The results of this thesis work, based
on the analysis of different genetic regions (surface, precore/core, x) of the HBV genome clearly established the
presence of three different HBV genotypes (genotypes A, C
and D) in the eastern Indian population [78-80]. This
unique distribution of three distinct genotypes in the eastern Indian population provided an opportunity to
directly compare the clinical significance of three distinct
genotypes in the same geo-ethnic population.
The comparison of clinical and virological characteristics
between HBV genotypes A, C and D revealed the higher
potentials of genotypes A and C in causing disease severity
in this part of India, as they were associated with prolonged HBeAg positivity, higher ALT levels, higher viremia
and, higher prevalence of mutations in the BCP region (at
nucleotides 1762T/1764A) [79]. This study also indicated
that precore mutation (1896A) does not have a prognostic
role in predicting progress towards liver disease in this
part of India [79]. More interestingly, infection with a particular HBV genotype was found to be associated with certain epidemiological risk factors; genotype D infection
with history of jaundice in family or childhood or intrafamilial transmission, an important mode of transmission
in this community, while percutaneous injury (frequent
injection, needle prick, body piercing, use of unsterilized
blade in community barber's shop), were associated with
genotypes A and C infections [79].
To further elucidate the changing epidemiology of HBV
infections and to explore the routes of introduction of
HBV genotype C in this part of India, two different groups
of subjects were studied. One of the groups included IDUs
from the north eastern state of Manipur, who are well
known to be exposed to the epidemics of intravenous
drug abuse and parenteral viral infections from south East
Asian countries, by virtue of sharing of drugs and injecting
instruments. Another group examined included HBV
infected subjects from a tribe (the Karen, considered a
community in India) migrated from Myanmar. Both the
study groups were selected based on the fact that they had
well epidemiological links with both the south East Asian
population and eastern Indian population. Analysis of the

HBV genotypes among the IDUs in the present study well
correlated with the hypothesis of spread of genotype C
through drug routes [81]. On the other hand, as expected,
genotype C was also found to be the prevalent strain of
HBV among the Karen community of Andaman & Nicobar (A & N) islands, which well corroborated with the
migration history of this community nearly 80 years ago,
from the Southeast Asian country, Myanmar [82]. Nevertheless, considering the geographical separation of the A &
N Islands, the possibility of spread of genotype C from the
people of these islands (Karen) seems to be rather difficult. However, the northeastern states of India including
Manipur are well connected to the eastern parts of India
by various means and thus frequented by people from
these states. Apart from HBV infection, the rapid change
of epidemiology of HCV and HIV in the north eastern and
eastern parts of India suggests the introduction of HBV
genotype C through the northeastern states, through
mobile and travelling population [81].
The thesis work was also unique, as it revealed for the first
time, the genetic variability of the x gene region of the
HBV strains circulating in the eastern part of India. Phylogenetic analysis of the x gene further confirmed the presence of HBV subgenotypes Aa/A1, Cs/C1, D1, D2, D3 and
D5 in the serum of infected individuals [80]. The present
study based on analysis of sequence and predicted structure of the HBx and its functional domains revealed the
possible basis of genotype/subgenotype specific differences in the hepatocarcinogenic properties of HBV strains.
It also suggested that the proline- serine rich hypervariable
region (PSR) located in the N terminal part of HBx primarily determines most of the genotype/subgenotype specificity of the HBx [80]. During this study, detailed analysis
of HBx sequences retrieved from the GenBank also demonstrated that certain hepatocarcinogenic mechanisms
may act in a HBx genotype/subgenotype dependent [83].
It also revealed that frequent loss of HBx genetic region is
a unique feature of HBV strains circulating in our population, and low genetic variability in the x gene region, compared to HBV strains from other countries. The
occurrences of sporadic mutations, insertions, deletions
or truncations previously reported to be prevalent in HCC
patients from other countries was found to be extremely
low, in the x gene region and changes specific for any particular clinical outcome were not observed in this study
[80]. Apart from the low genetic variability of the HBx in
the present study, the codon 249 mutation of p53 gene
were not detected in any of the samples in the present
study. Taken together, the data suggested a possible explanation for the low incidence of HBV-AFB1 related HCC in
the population [80].
In the thesis, attempts were also made to investigate the
transmission patterns in the families of incidentally

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/156

detected HBsAg carriers or individuals with occult HBV
infection, through intrafamilial modes. The results indicated that the clinical status of the index case does not
influence the aggregation pattern of intrafamilial infection in this population. Although the percentage was
small, the present study, based on advanced molecular
evolutionary analyses, confirmed for the first time that
occult HBV infection could indeed be transmissible
through apparent non-sexual, non-parenteral contacts in
a familial setting [78]. It also revealed that sexual transmission was not the predominant mode of transmission
in some families, even when one of spouses had high levels of viremia, suggesting that sexual transmission in adult
life may not be an efficient mode of transmission in this
population [78]. In this study, genotype D was found to
be prevalent among the HBsAg positive index cases while
genotype A was prevalent among the HBsAg negative
(occult HBV infection) family members, that supported
the different epidemiology of HBV genotypes, even in a
familial setting [78].
Finally, the present thesis work was archetype in examining the genetic variability of HBV in the peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBL). Attempts to characterize the HBV
sequences revealed the compartment restricted predominance of HBV genotype A (subgenotype Ae/A2) specific
sequences with a potent immune escape G145R mutation
in the PBL of majority of the study subjects from this study
population. Interestingly, entirely different HBV genotypes/subgenotypes (C, D or subgenotype Aa/A1) were
found to predominate in the sera of the same study population. The highly contrasting prevalence of subgenotype
Ae/A2 associated with the immune escape G145R mutation in serum and PBL suggested that the HBV DNA and
expressed viral antigen in the serum, liver and PBL are
under different selection pressure. During this work,
detailed comparison and analysis of the pregenomic RNA
base pairing of different HBV genotypes also suggested a
potential molecular mechanism that explained the specific selection of the G145R mutation in the context of
subgenotype Ae/A2 specific sequences and higher
immune selection on the PBL [Datta et al. Manuscript
under review].

Conclusion
In conclusion, the results of this thesis sheds light on
many important aspects of HBV molecular epidemiology
that are very much important for identifying the population at risk of acquiring HBV and developing severe disease, and also pose a risk of transmission through
different modes. This information are essential for determining the risk factors associated with HBV infections, to
formulate necessary preventive measures to lessen the
burden of new infections and spread of newly introduced
genotype to other parts, from eastern India. Moreover,

considering the higher pathogenic potentials associated
with certain HBV genotypes, the results of the thesis work
will be helpful in prognosis and better management of
HBV infected subjects.
Emergence of new genotypes/subgenotypes, clinically
important mutations have immense importance in determining the clinical outcome, efficacy of vaccination and
therefore strict surveillance of these variants are extremely
important. Hope that the present study will advance the
understanding of changing molecular epidemiology of
HBV, and will also help in formulation of effective preventive measures. Last but most important, the results of
this thesis work, demonstrating compartment specific
high prevalence of HBV DNA associated with vaccine/
immune escape mutation in the PBL of HBsAg negative
subjects have extremely important implications in the
field of transfusion medicine, organ transplantation, and
in vaccination strategies, and thus need further investigations. Finally, together with contributing unique data on
molecular epidemiology of HBV in India, this thesis work
also open new avenues for further studying the molecular
virology of HBV.
