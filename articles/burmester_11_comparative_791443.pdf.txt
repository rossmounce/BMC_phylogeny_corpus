Abstract
Background: Millions of humans and animals suffer from superficial infections caused by a group of highly
specialized filamentous fungi, the dermatophytes, which exclusively infect keratinized host structures. To provide
broad insights into the molecular basis of the pathogenicity-associated traits, we report the first genome
sequences of two closely phylogenetically related dermatophytes, Arthroderma benhamiae and Trichophyton
verrucosum, both of which induce highly inflammatory infections in humans.
Results: 97% of the 22.5 megabase genome sequences of A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum are unambiguously
alignable and collinear. To unravel dermatophyte-specific virulence-associated traits, we compared sets of
potentially pathogenicity-associated proteins, such as secreted proteases and enzymes involved in secondary
metabolite production, with those of closely related onygenales (Coccidioides species) and the mould Aspergillus
fumigatus. The comparisons revealed expansion of several gene families in dermatophytes and disclosed the
peculiarities of the dermatophyte secondary metabolite gene sets. Secretion of proteases and other hydrolytic
enzymes by A. benhamiae was proven experimentally by a global secretome analysis during keratin degradation.
Molecular insights into the interaction of A. benhamiae with human keratinocytes were obtained for the first time
by global transcriptome profiling. Given that A. benhamiae is able to undergo mating, a detailed comparison of the
genomes further unraveled the genetic basis of sexual reproduction in this species.
Conclusions: Our results enlighten the genetic basis of fundamental and putatively virulence-related traits of
dermatophytes, advancing future research on these medically important pathogens.

Background
Dermatophytes are highly specialized pathogenic fungi
and the most common cause of superficial mycoses in
humans and animals [1]. During disease, these microorganisms exclusively infect and multiply within keratinized host structures - for example, the epidermal
stratum corneum, nails or hair - a characteristic that is

putatively related to their common keratinolytic activity
[2] (Figure 1; Additional file 1). Consistent with this
assumption, during in vitro cultivation with keratin as
the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, dermatophytes
were proven to secrete multiple proteases, some of
which have been identified and discussed as potential
virulence determinants [2]. Little is known, however,
about the general basis of pathogenicity in these fungi, a
drawback that might be explained by the fact that these
microorganisms have so far not been intensively studied
at the molecular level. Dermatophytes are comparatively
slow growing under laboratory conditions and

genetically less amenable than other clinically relevant
fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans or Aspergillus fumigatus [3]. Recent advances in dermatophyte
research allowed the first broad-scale transcriptional and
proteomic analyses [4-8], and some selected genes have
been functionally characterized [9-11]. However, genome-wide analyses have been hampered by a lack of full

genome sequences, thereby precluding the generation of
principle hypotheses on dermatophyte pathogenicity in a
comparative genomic context.
The two dermatophyte species Arthroderma benhamiae
and Trichophyton verrucosum are both zoophilic, yet the
natural reservoir of T. verrucosum is almost exclusively
cattle, whereas A. benhamiae is usually found on

rodents, in particular guinea pigs [12,13]. The two species also differ in their ability to grow under laboratory
conditions, with T. verrucosum being very difficult to
cultivate at all [14]. Conversely, A. benhamiae is comparatively fast growing and produces abundant microconidia. As a teleomorphic species, the fungus is even able
to undergo sexual development, including the formation
of sexual fructifications (cleistothecia) [15,16]. These
characteristics, together with the recent establishment of
a guinea pig infection model and a genetic system for
targeted gene deletion (P Staib and colleagues, manuscript submitted) for this species, suggest A. benhamiae
is a useful model organism to investigate the fundamental biology and pathogenicity of dermatophytes [8].
Despite the above mentioned phenotypic differences, A.
benhamiae and T. verrucosum are phylogenetically very
closely related, and both induce highly inflammatory
cutaneous infections in humans, such as tinea corporis
[15,17]. Therefore, a genome comparison of the two
species should reveal common basic pathogenicity-associated traits.
In the present study, we report and compare the genome sequences of A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum and
refer to potential dermatophyte-specific pathogenicityassociated factors, as revealed by comparisons with
groups of proteins important for pathogenicity in other
species of the Onygenales (Coccidioides posadasii and
Coccidioides immitis) and in the mould A. fumigatus.
Applying our insights thereof, we used secretome analysis to reveal secreted factors of A. benhamiae that mediate extracellular in vitro keratin degradation. The
interaction between A. benhamiae and the human host
was monitored by global transcriptome profiling of the
fungal cells in contact with human keratinocytes. Investigating the molecular basis of sexual reproduction, we
inspected in detail the A. benhamiae mating type locus.

Results and discussion
Comparative genomics of A. benhamiae and
T. verrucosum

The genomes of A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum were
sequenced by a whole-genome shotgun hybrid approach.
The assembly of A. benhamiae spans 22.3 Mb [DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank:ABSU00000000] and that of T. verrucosum comprises 22.6 Mb [DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank:
ACYE00000000] (Table 1; Additional file 2; both genomes are also deposited in the Broad Institute database

[18]). Thus, these genomes are smaller than those of
phylogenetically related ascomycetes, such as aspergilli
(28 Mb and 37.3 Mb in case of Aspergillus clavatus and
Aspergillus niger, respectively), Coccidioides species (27
to 29 Mb), and Histoplasma capsulatum (30 to 39 Mb).
The genomes of A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum
contain 7,980 and 8,024 predicted protein-encoding
genes, respectively (Table 1). Introns were found in
5,809 of the A. benhamiae and 5,744 of the T. verrucosum genes. Both genomes comprise a mosaic of long
G + C rich, gene-containing portions separated by A +
T rich ‘islands’ with a GC content below 40%, ranging
from a few kilobases to more than 25 kb. As expected
from previous reports based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 [15,19-21], the
comparison of the two genome sequences revealed a
strong similarity. Using the software Mummer [22],
approximately 21.8 Mb of the genomes (98.0% of the
available A. benhamiae and 96.7% of the T. verrucosum
genomic sequences) can be aligned to each other, indicating that the vast majority of genes lie in collinear
regions and are shared between the two organisms. The
average identity of the alignable portion of the genomes
is 94.8%. The alignment of the two genomes points to
only five major genomic rearrangements, one inversion
and four balanced translocations between chromosomes
(Figure S1 in Additional file 2). The presence of only a
few rearrangements between the two genomes suggests
very recent speciation. These findings are reflected
by the phylogenetic tree constructed by use of the
available genome sequences (Figure 2; Figure S2 in
Additional file 3).
However, we also identified notable dissimilarities
between the genomes of A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum. After having detected the orthologous pairs with
best bidirectional hits, we came up with lists of proteins
that presumably were unique for either species. Since
the best bidirectional hits were identified using protein
Blast, we next applied BlastN to correct for possible
gene prediction errors. We used a filter threshold for
significant hits of 80% identity between sequences over
less than 50% of the query length. There were 238
A. benhamiae sequences that gave no hits or non-significant hits in T. verrucosum, and 219 T. verrucosum
genes were not found in A. benhamiae. Of these, 83 and
78 genes (A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum, respectively)
have assigned names and/or functional domains. A list

of the predictions is provided in Additional file 4. Given
the overall strong genome sequence similarity, a future
functional investigation of these distinctions appears to
be of interest, in particular with respect to the tremendous differences between the two species in terms of in
vitro growth ability and animal host preference (see also
the ‘Other interesting genes’ section).
We analyzed the A. benhamiae fast-evolving genes in
comparison to T. verrucosum. Using the dN/dS ratio as
a measure for selective pressure, we obtained a list of
positively selected genes (dN/dS >1) (Additional file 5).
In total we found 132 positively selected genes with
assigned functions, enabling assumptions about their
roles in the cell and, hence, the reasons for their accelerated evolution. Of particular interest are the two most
abundant groups of these genes, those encoding transcription factors (18 genes) and MFS transporters (5
genes). The latter are known to be usual constituents of
secondary metabolite (SM) gene clusters.
Both dermatophyte genomes encode the basic metabolic machinery for glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle,
glyoxylate cycle, pentose phosphate shunt, and synthesis
of all 20 standard amino acids and the five nucleic acid
bases. Moreover, dermatophytes appear to be capable of
producing a wide range of SMs, which is reflected by
the presence of polyketide synthase (PKS)- and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-encoding genes
(see the ‘Genetic basis for secondary metabolism
gene clusters’ section). The outstanding ability of

dermatophytes to specifically infect superficial host
structures may be supported by the possession of a
broad repertoire of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes,
the expression of many of which was also proven
experimentally (see the next paragraph and the ‘Identification of secreted fungal proteins during keratin degradation by secretome analysis’ section). In addition, the
ability of dermatophytes to assimilate lipids, major constituents of the skin, is putatively reflected by the presence of 16 lipase genes in either genome. A putative
link between the possession of lipases and fungusinduced skin disease has previously been revealed for
basidiomycetes of the genus Malassezia [23].
Of particular note is the apparent relative paucity of
tRNA genes in both dermatophytes in comparison with
other closely related ascomycetes. The genomes of A.
benhamiae and T. verrucosum contain 80 and 77 tRNA
genes, respectively, whereas the number of tRNA genes
varies between approximately 100 to 130 in Coccidioides
species and 150 to 370 in aspergilli. However, some
strains of H. capsulatum, representing a comparatively
closely related pathogen, also possess only 83 to 89
tRNA genes, suggesting that the low number of tRNA
genes is not specific to dermatophytes.
Identification of a broad repertoire of protease genes in
dermatophyte genomes

Dermatophytes are keratinophilic fungi, sharing the ability to utilize compact hard keratin as a sole source of

Burmester et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R7
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R7

carbon and nitrogen. In line with this knowledge, the
two sequenced genomes reflect a remarkable metabolic
capability for protein degradation. They contain 235
predicted protease-encoding genes, 87 of the deduced
proteins possessing a secretion signal (Table S3 in Additional file 6). We did not detect any protease in A. benhamiae or T. verrucosum unique to either species, a
finding that may reflect similar life styles and/or host
adaptation mechanisms, especially with respect to their
common keratinophilic growth. In general, deviations in
the number of proteases per genome are rather large in
the fungal kingdom, ranging from approximately 90 in
Ustilago maydis to approximately 350 in Gibberella zeae
(according to the MEROPS database [24]). Dermatophytes belong to the most protease-rich species.
The protein sequence of each protease is highly conserved across dermatophyte species [25]. Collections of
predicted secreted proteases of A. benhamiae and T.
verrucosum as well as Coccidioides spp. (Onygenales)
were compared to those of A. fumigatus as a member of
the Eurotiales, for which many secreted proteases have
previously been characterized. Most A. fumigatus proteases in A1 (pepsins), M28 (leucine aminopeptidases),
S9 (dipeptidylpeptidases), S10 (carboxypeptidases) and
S53 (tripeptidylpeptidases) families have an orthologue
in dermatophytes and Coccidioides spp. (Table S4 in
Additional file 7). The major striking differences found
between the secreted protease batteries of A. fumigatus
and Onygenales are the following: subtilisin (S8), deuterolysin (M35), and fungalysin (M36), which belong to
endoprotease gene families, have expanded in Onygenales (Table S4 in Additional file 7); the same is true for
exopeptidases of the M14 family (metallocarboxypeptidases) and the M28 family (aminopeptidases) - a major
carboxypeptidase (McpA) homologous to the human
pancreatic carboxypeptidase A was previously characterized in dermatophytes [26], and of particular note,
Aspergillus spp. have no McpA orthologue; and genes
encoding acidic glutamic proteases (G1 family) were not
detected in either dermatophytes or Coccidioides spp.
Major differences between dermatophytes and Coccidioides spp. proteases were found in M35, M36 and S8
proteases families (see the phylogenetic trees in Additional file 8). Proteases of these three families of dermatophytes and Coccidioides spp. form distinct clades in
phylogenetic trees (Additional file 8). Members of the
S8 and M36 families have undergone additional amplifications in the dermatophyte lineage, and expansion of
the M35 family appears to be different in Coccidioides
spp. and dermatophytes. In the latter, a clade was apparently lost. In addition, three genes encoding proteases of
the S41 family were found in the dermatophyte genomes
while only one gene encoding a protease of this family
was identified in Coccidioides spp.

Page 5 of 16

Recent comparative genomic analyses of Coccidioides
species with other members of the Onygenales showed
gene family sizes are associated with a host/substrate
shift from plants to animals in these microorganisms
[27]. Experimentally, the expression of genes encoding
fungalysins and subtilisins was recently monitored in A.
benhamiae by cDNA microarray analysis during growth
on keratin, and also during cutaneous infection of guinea pigs [8]. Interestingly, the prominent keratin
induced A. benhamiae subtilisin-encoding genes, such
as SUB3 and SUB4, were not observed in this former
analysis to be strongly activated in vivo, in contrast to
others that conversely were not found to be induced
during in vitro growth on keratin. A role for Sub3 was
recently observed in adhesion of the dermatophyte
Microsporum canis to feline epidermis, but not for the
invasion thereof [28]. These findings suggest additional
functions of secreted proteases during host adaptation
other than keratin degradation. Since the formerly used
cDNA microarray does not comprise the full genome of
A. benhamiae, the future identification of in vivo specific
dermatophyte proteases on the basis of the presented
genome appears to be of major interest.
Identification of secreted fungal proteins during keratin
degradation by secretome analysis

A potential role of secreted proteases, in particular serine proteases, in pathogenesis has been widely reported
in many prokaryotes and fungi [2,29-31], including functions as allergens [32]. In order to apply insights from
the present genome sequences to determine putative
virulence gene function, we set out to reveal the basic
panel of factors that are secreted during growth of A.
benhamiae on keratin. To achieve this, secretome analysis was performed, an approach that, to our knowledge,
has not been applied to A. benhamiae before. Experimental analysis (after 2 days of growth) led to the identification of 203 single electrophoretic species (Figure
3b). From these entities, 53 different proteins were
detected (Table S5 in Additional file 6). By far the largest group of identified proteins is formed by putative
proteases (approximately 75% relative spot volume). In
addition, we found other, different hydrolases and proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Table S5 in
Additional file 6). Three of the subtilisin-like serine proteases (Sub3, Sub4, and Sub7), three fungalysine-type
metalloproteases (Mep1, Mep3, and Mep4), the leucine
aminopeptidases Lap1 and Lap2, as well as the dipeptidyl-peptidases DppIV and DppV were detected in the
secretome, consistent with gene expression analysis in
A. benhamiae during keratin degradation [8]. Supporting
our results, the pattern of proteins secreted by the two
related dermatophyte species Trichophyton rubrum and
T. violaceum during growth on soy protein was

details.

previously described in [4]. In that study, a gel-based
approach led to the identification of 19 proteins secreted
by at least one of these species. Remarkably, 15 of the
corresponding homologs were also found to be secreted
in the present study by A. benhamiae on keratin medium, including major keratinases of the subtilisin family
of secreted proteases (also see Table S6 in Additional
file 6). Individual differences between the present and
formerly observed secretion patterns might be due to
the different dermatophyte species analyzed and/or to
the different protein substrates and cultivation parameters used. In conclusion, the set of dermatophyte
secreted proteases in a protein medium is similar to that
of A. fumigatus, which includes endoproteases such as
the major subtilisin Alp1 and the fungalysin Mep and
exoproteases such as Lap1, Lap2, DppIV and DppV.
Endo- and exoproteases secreted by microorganisms
cooperate very efficiently in protein digestion to produce
oligopeptides and free amino acids that can be incoporated via transporters. During the process of protein
digestion the main function of endoproteases is to produce a large number of free end peptides on which exoproteases may act. At neutral and alkaline pH,
synergistic action of Lap and DppIV was shown in
Aspergillus spp. [13,24]. Laps degrade peptides from the
amino terminus until reaching an X-Pro sequence,

which acts as a stop. In a complementary manner, the
X-Pro sequences can be removed by DppIV, thus allowing Laps access to the next residue. Dermatophyte and
Aspergillus spp. Lap1, Lap2, DppIV and DppV have
shown comparable substrate specificity [33]. Therefore,
our proteomics approach allows us to hypothesize common basic mechanisms in dermatophytes during extracellular protein digestion. However, the presence of
large protease gene families in dermatophytes reflects
selection during evolution and the ability of these fungi
to adapt to different environmental conditions during
infection and saprophytic growth.
Differential gene expression in A. benhamiae during
infection of keratinocytes

Growth of A. benhamiae on keratin might mimic
selected in vivo growth substrates, yet may not reflect
the entire process of infection. In order to gain more
insights into basic host adaptation mechanisms, we studied the global transcriptional response of A. benhamiae
during infection of human keratinocytes. After 12 h of
co-cultivation, germinating A. benhamiae microconidia
were observed to be localized and concentrated on the
host cells, suggesting that the fungus actively adheres to
the keratinocytes (Figure 1c,d). To perform 454 RNA
sequencing, the fungal cells were harvested after

Burmester et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R7
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R7

incubation for 96 h with and without keratinocytes.
About 50 A. benhamiae genes showed differential
expression with a fold change >5 (P-value < 0.05; Table
S7a in Additional file 6); 45 genes encoding putatively
secreted proteins (Table S5 in Additional file 6) and 13
genes coding for proteins involved in the biosynthesis of
SMs are expressed either only with or without keratinocytes, or under both conditions. Of the 235 predicted
protease-encoding genes, 158 are expressed under both
conditions. Sixteen potentially secreted proteins, including three proteases, are differentially expressed (Table
S7b in Additional file 6). In particular, the expression
profile of the genes encoding carboxypeptidase S1 and
dipeptidyl-peptidase DppV implies their potential involvement in the infection process. The transcript levels of
two NRPS genes were reduced during co-cultivation
with keratinocytes, a finding that is noticeable but cannot be explained at this stage.
To confirm the RNAseq results, we selected several
genes that were predicted to be differentially expressed
and tested them by Northern blotting. We used
two housekeeping genes, actin (ARB_04092) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH,
ARB_00831), as controls as they are not expected to be
differentially regulated between the control and co-incubation conditions. All tested genes were regulated as
expected from the RNAseq data (Figure S4 in Additional
file 9). The expression level alterations of metabolic
enzymes (ARB_07891, ARB_04156, ARB_01650 and
ARB_04856) and membrane transporters (ARB_01027)
reflect the adaptation of the fungus to the different
nutrition provided by keratinocytes and their remnants,
whereas the strong up-regulation of the hydrophobin
ARB_06975 indicates altered binding properties and
adhesivity during growth on epithelial cells and during
infection. In conclusion, this independent experimental
method shows that the accuracy of the RNAseq data
was exemplary.
Genetic basis for secondary metabolism gene clusters

The A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum genomes encode a
relatively high number (26 and 25, respectively) of SM
biosynthesis gene clusters (Table 2), a finding that contrasts with observations made in other fungi and bacteria highly adapted to humans. For comparison,
Candida albicans or Staphylococcus aureus hardly produce SMs and Histoplasma species have no more than
seven SM gene clusters per genome; more closely
related to dermatophytes is Coccidioides immitis, which
has 16 SM gene clusters, the main difference being in
the number of NRPSs (5 versus 15 in A. benhamiae).
Nine PKS, 15 NRPS and 3 PKS/NRPS hybrid genes
were identified in the A. benhamiae genome, all of
which except for one NRPS gene (ARB_02149) are

Page 7 of 16

conserved in both species (Table 2). Addressing the
question of whether the absence of the latter gene in T.
verrucosum is associated with phenotypic and/or hostspecific differences between the two species will be of
future interest. To see whether only the NRPS or the
entire associated gene cluster is absent from T. verrucosum,
we examined the conservation of the other constituents of
the ARB_02149 gene cluster and observed that the ‘missing’ NRPS belongs to an otherwise very well conserved and
collinear region that spans more than 75 kb (the whole T.
verrucosum supercontig 79). However, one other gene
besides ARB_02149 is missing in T. verrucosum, the MFS
transporter ARB_02151 (Figure 4). Interestingly, the ‘missing’ genes are separated by a perfectly conserved ABC multidrug transporter (ARB_02150 = TRV_01489). The
Arthroderma ARB_02149 gene cluster has several traits
typical of functional SM gene clusters, such as the presence
of genes for the MFS transporter, feruloyl esterase and C6
transcription factor. This makes us suppose that the NRPS
was lost in Trichophyton rather than acquired by Arthroderma. However, it remains unclear if the MFS transporter
was deleted simultaneously, and why the deletion did not
capture the ‘middle’ ARB_02150 gene.
All nine PKS genes detected in A. benhamiae have
unequivocal counterparts in the T. verrucosum genome
(Table 2). An interesting feature of the dermatophyte
PKS set is the unusual proportions of reducing and
non-reducing PKSs. Whereas in all other closely related
ascomycetes (such as aspergilli) most of the PKSs are
non-reducing, in dermatophytes most are reducing
PKSs. A comparison with the closest sequenced relative,
C. immitis (Table 2; see more details below), also
revealed substantial differences in the composition of
the PKS set: the ratio of reducing to non-reducing in
dermatophytes is 2:1, whereas in C. immitis it is 2:3.
This observation suggests dermatophytes have an
uncommon SM profile, which deserves future investigation. Particular attention should be paid to the fact
that these fungi are characterized by intense pigmentation, a phenotype that may be related to their pathogenicity. For the related species T. rubrum, the
polyketide-derived mycotoxin xanthomegnin has been
suggested to be responsible for the characteristic red
colony reverse pigment. Most interestingly, xanthomegnin production has even been detected in epidermal material infected by T. rubrum, in contrast to
non-infected controls [34]. A putative link between SM
production and host adaptation of A. benhamiae might
also be reflected by our observation that several genes
associated with the synthesis of such molecules were
found to be differentially regulated during infection of
human keratinocytes (see the ‘Differential gene expression in A. benhamiae during infection of keratinocytes’
section).

To get an impression of possible expansions of
families and evolutionary relationships, we compared
the sets of SM producers in dermatophytes with that of
C. immitis (Table 2; Figure S5.1 and S5.2 in Additional
file 10). As mentioned above, the total number of SM
gene clusters is higher in dermatophytes, mainly due to
the more abundant NRPSs. However, we observe differences also in the PKS set as well as in the number of
PKS/NRPS hybrids: C. immitis possesses only one
hybrid, whereas each dermatophyte has three. The
higher number of non-reducing PKSs in C. immitis is
mainly due to the expansion of one clade; most likely
we are seeing the results of duplication of some ancestor
genes with a domain architecture of a beta-ketoacyl
synthase domain, an acetyltransferase domain, an acyl
carrier protein domain, and a methyltransferase domain
(KS-AT-ACP-ME). Four of six C. immitis non-reducing
PKSs belong to this clade. Of the other two, one has a
clear ortholog in dermatophytes, and the other has an
unusual structure (AT-KS-ACP-thioesterase domain
(TE)) without an orthologous dermatophyte gene. In
comparison to C. immitis, dermatophytes possess two
additional non-reducing clades, which means that, in
spite of the lower number of non-reducing PKSs, they
have more various potential capacities. The reducing C.
immitis PKSs also cannot boast great variety: two of
four C. immitis genes are most likely the result of a
duplication (they form a separate clade and do not have
dermatophyte orthologs), one PKS has orthologs in dermatophytes, and one is only a probable homolog (see
below). On the other hand, in dermatophytes we see an
expansion of the group with a fumonisin synthase-like
structure (KS-AT-ME-enoyl reductase domain (ER)ketoacyl reductase domain (KR)-ACP): three orthologous pairs formed by out-paralogs in each species have
only one close homolog in C. immitis. Since the C.
immitis gene lacks one of the domains (methyltransferase), we cannot consider it as a fumonisin-like ortholog.
Besides the 6-methyl-salicylic acid synthase, completely
lacking in C. immitis, another not completely reducing
PKS (KS-AT-ME-KR-ACP), as well as two PKS/NRPS
hybrids, do not have homologs in C. immitis. Taken
together, these data agree with our hypothesis that
highly adapted parasites such as Coccidioides do not
require a large arsenal of SMs.
Sexuality in dermatophytes

Sexual reproduction is known for A. benhamiae but not
for T. verrucosum [35,36]. The A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum genomes revealed the whole sets of genes for
mating and meiosis in both species, suggesting that the
lack of a known sexual cycle in T. verrucosum is not
due to major deletions of genes essential for sexual
reproduction and meiosis (Table S8 in Additional file 6).

Page 9 of 16

Both sequenced strains showed a single mating type
encoding an HMG box transcription factor. To identify
the complementary mating type, we sequenced the corresponding region of an A. benhamiae mating partner
strain (strain CBS 809.72; Figure 5). The newly identified
region encodes an alpha-box type transcription factor,
indicating that A. benhamiae exhibits two mating types,
as described for other closely related fungal pathogens
such as H. capsulatum and C. immitis [37]. A. benhamiae mating type + strains as well as mating type strains are often routinely isolated [36]. There is no
apparent disequilibrium between mating type + and
mating type - strain frequencies.
We did not identify a striking defect in the T. verrucosum mating type locus, which appears to be intact. Several strains of T. verrucosum were found to be of the
same mating type as the sequenced strains, suggesting a
strong disequilibrium towards mating type +.
In Aspergillus (Eurotiales), Coccidioides and Histoplasma (Onygenales) the mating type (MAT) loci are
flanked by APN2 and the SLA2 genes encoding a DNA
lyase and a cytoskeleton protein, respectively [37]. The
MAT idiomorphs and flanking regions described here for
A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum are essentially identical
to those of other closely related dermatophytes [38].
Other interesting genes

Of particular interest are the genes of A. benhamiae that
have no obvious counterpart in T. verrucosum (Additional file 4) and whose predicted functions suggest
their potential involvement in basic biological phenotypes and/or pathogenicity. Two such genes,
ARB_04713 and ARB_02149, encoding a phosphopantetheine-binding domain and an NRPS, respectively,
were found in the transcriptome analysis, although not
expressed differentially. The expression pattern of the A.
benhamiae-specific NRPS ARB_02149 further suggests
that its as yet unidentified product is produced during
infection by the fungal cells.
Another gene of particular interest encodes hydrophobin. In A. fumigatus, surface hydrophobin was shown to
prevent immune recognition [39]. The A. benhamiae
hydrophobin gene (ARB_06975) shows 99% similarity
with the respective T. verrucosum gene (TRV_00350)
and displays moderate overexpression (1.6×) under cocultivation conditions (Table S7b in Additional file 6).
The analysis of a potential role of dermatophyte hydrophobins in immune response functions and/or adhesion
to host surfaces will be part of future research.

Conclusions
Numerous examples in microbial pathogenicity research
still need to be explained at the genomic level, thus
requiring genome sequences to be made available. Here,

we present the first genomes of dermatophyte species,
filamentous fungi that cause most superficial infections
in humans and animals. The presence of putative pathogenicity-related factors, such as numerous secreted proteases, was revealed at the genome level and also
experimentally confirmed during keratin degradation by
A. benhamiae. Although keratin utilization is traditionally supposed to be of major relevance for the pathogenicity of these microorganisms, the entire process of
host adaptation during infection seems to be more complex. Transcriptome analysis showed that only some of
the typically keratin-induced proteases were found to be
strongly expressed during fungus-keratinocyte interaction. Instead, genome and transcriptome analyses draw
attention to so far hardly noticed dermatophyte factors for example, putative SMs - the role of which should be
addressed in the future. Our research on dermatophytes

was strongly facilitated by the selection of A. benhamiae
as a model species, which provides practical advantages
such as comparatively fast growth and the production of
abundant microconidia. Moreover, future basic studies
on the regulation of mating, dermatophyte evolution
and host preference will profit from the ability of A.
benhamiae to undergo sexual reproduction. In conclusion, by presenting dermatophyte genomes and global
insights into major processes of host adaptation, we
intend to advance molecular studies on these medically
important microorganisms.

Materials and methods
A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum strains and growth
conditions

A clinical isolate of A. benhamiae strain 2354 was used
(isolate LAU2354) [15]. T. verrucosum strain 44 [17]

Burmester et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R7

was kindly provided by Yvonne Gräser (Charité, Berlin,
Germany). Strains were cultivated at 28°C on Sabouraud
2% (w/v) glucose agar (SG, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
for 12 days; liquid cultures were shaken at 180 rpm at
30°C for 5 to 7 days. Hyphae and conidia were separated
by filtration using a 40 μm cell strainer (BD Bioscience,
Heidelberg, Germany). Conidia were counted with a cell
counter (Beckman, Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) or manually using a Thoma chamber. For crossing experiments
of A. benhamiae LAU2354 with the opposite mating
type CBS 809.72, MAT medium [40] (1/10 SG, 0.1% (w/v)
MgSO4 and 0.1% (w/v) KH2PO4) was used.
DNA and RNA preparation for DNA sequencing and cDNA
library

For DNA preparation, mycelia were separated from the
medium by filtration through Miracloth (Calbiochem,
Darmstadt, Germany) and ground in a mortar under
liquid nitrogen. After evaporation, the powder was suspended in a solution containing 150 mM EDTA,
50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% (w/v) SDS, 20 mM NaCl
and 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Merck). After incubation
for 1 h at 55°C, the solution was gently mixed with 1/
4 volume of 4 M NaCl and kept on ice for 30 minutes.
After centrifugation for 10 minutes at 6,000 rpm and
4°C, polyethylene glycol 6000 (Serva, Heidelberg,
Germany) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). The DNA was precipitated for
1 h on ice and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm
at 4°C. The pellet was dissolved in a solution containing
25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl
and 1% (v/v) Triton X100. For density centrifugation, 1g
CsCl and 12 μl bisbenzimide (10 mg/ml) for each milliliter of solution were added [41,42]. Ultracentrifugation
was performed in a vertical rotor at 44,000 rpm for 24 h
at 25°C. DNA was separated into two bands of different
density according to the AT-content of the DNA. The
upper band contained a DNA fraction highly enriched
for mitochondrial DNA. For T. verrucosum, two rounds
of density gradient centrifugation were necessary. In the
first round, ethidium bromide was used instead of bisbenzimide. For RNA preparation, SG medium was
inoculated with conidia to a final concentration of 3 ×
104 conidia/ml and shaken at 180 rpm for three days at
30°C. Total RNA was isolated using a commercial kit
as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). After RNA extraction, a cDNA library
was constructed from this material according to the
manufacturer’s protocols (MINT cDNA synthesis kit,
Evrogen, Moscow, Russia).
Plasmid/fosmid libraries and sequencing

Nuclear DNA of A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum was
sheared, size fractionated (3 to 4 kb), end-repaired, and

Page 11 of 16

cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18. For both fungal
species, two fosmid libraries each were prepared in
pCC1FOS (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI,
USA) as described by the manufacturer, one for the
high-GC chromosomal DNA fraction and one for the
AT-rich mitochondrial DNA fraction. For T. verrucosum, 40,000 fosmids from GC-rich and 80,000 fosmids
from AT-rich DNA were obtained. For A. benhamiae,
the corresponding yields were around 50,000 (GC-rich)
and 20,000 (AT-rich), respectively. End sequences of
plasmid and fosmid clones were obtained using dye terminator chemistry and a 3730×l sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Moreover, a fosmid
library was generated with a GC-rich DNA fraction of
the A. benhamiae strain CBS 809.72 encoding the opposite mating type locus. We tested 1,000 fosmids by colony filter hybridization and in PCR experiments.
Fosmids were identified by hybridization experiments
with a digoxygenin-labeled part of the apn2 gene
(ARB_07318) and in PCR experiments using apn2
amplifying primers (5’-CTTCTAGTGACTCGCCACAGG-3’ forward and 5’-GAGTTGGAGGTTGAGATGCTGAC-3’ reverse). Three clones were positively
identified by both methods. To test whether the fosmids
contained the full length MAT region, the clones were
tested in PCR experiments amplifying parts of other
flanking genes, such as the sla2 gene (ARB_07317) and
the rps4 gene (ARB_07322). For sla2, PCR primer pair
5’-CTTGTTCAGGAGAGCTATGG-3’ and 5’-CAGCTTCTCGAGCTCCTCCC-3’ was used; for rps4, PCR primer pair 5’-CAGCGCCTGGTCAAGGTCGACG-3’ and
5’-GGTCACGCTCCTCAGCAATGG-3’ was used. DNA
of a positive fosmid was shotgun sequenced using dye
terminator chemistry (ABI).
In addition, genomic 454 libraries were generated
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced
using a GS FLX (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The
nucleotide sequences were assembled species-specific
using the newbler software. Clone gaps were filled using
a primer walking strategy with custom primers. Isolation, quantification and quality control of total RNA was
performed as described [43]. A cDNA-library was constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocols
(Evrogen) and 1,411 ABI dye terminator sequences were
obtained mainly from the 5’ end. The sequences were
matched to the assembled genomic sequences to determine exon/intron structures and to obtain an intron signature for the species.
Next generation sequencing and assembly

The same DNA as for the preparation of the plasmid/
fosmid libraries was used for the preparation of genomic
libraries for the 454/FLX system (Roche) according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. Three runs each were

Burmester et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R7
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R7

performed on the 454/FLX sequencing machine. All
454/FLX sequence data were assembled species-specific
using the newbler software. The Sanger based sequencing reads were assembled onto this ‘backbone’. Clone
gaps were filled using a primer walking strategy with
custom primers.
Both genomes are deposited in NCBI with accession
codes [DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank:ABSU00000000] for
A. benhamiae and [DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank:ACYE00000000] for T. verrucosum.
Gene prediction

Gene models of both fungi were generated by using in
silico predictions and sequence data from an EST library
constructed from cultured A. benhamiae cells. We
matched 1,411 ABI dye terminator sequences obtained
from the cDNA library sequencing to the assembled
genomic sequences to determine exon/intron structures
and to obtain an intron signature for the species. The
alignments of the cDNA sequences to the genomic
backbone yielded evidence for 861 introns and at least
653 protein-coding open reading frames (coding
sequences), which were validated by BLAST. These data
were used to train the gene prediction program geneid
[44]. To validate the accuracy of the gene prediction, 47
gene structures in one genomic region were annotated
manually and compared to the automated predictions,
indicating a specificity of 82% at a sensitivity of 97%.
For the annotation and comparative analyses of the genomes a web based genome browser was set up using the
GenColors database/software system [45].
Best bidirectional hits and BlastN analysis

Blast analysis of all coding sequences of one genome
against the other yielded best bidirectional hits. We used a
filter threshold for significant hits of 30% identity between
amino acid sequences over at least 50% of the protein.
A BlastN analysis of the genomic sequences was performed for all protein coding genes of T. verrucosum
against all A. benhamiae contigs. A filter threshold for
significant hits was 80% identity between sequences over
at least 60% of the query length; 239 T. verrucosum
sequences gave no hits or non-significant hits.
Transcriptome analysis

The human keratinocyte line HaCaT was obtained from
Prof. Fusenig (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). The cells were cultivated in DMEM
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, gentamycin (28 μg/ml) and 1% (w/v) ultraglutamine at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere and 5% (v/v) CO 2 for 2 days.
Medium and supplements were purchased from Lonza
(Basel, Belgium). Human keratinocytes were infected by

Page 12 of 16

A. benhamiae conidia with a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 6. Infected human cells were cultivated in fetal
calf serum-free DMEM supplemented with both gentamycin and ultraglutamine for 96 h at 28°C. As a control,
A. benhamiae conidia were grown in the absence of keratinocytes under the same conditions. After infection,
the human keratinocytes were lysed by addition of
0.03% (v/v) Triton X for 2 minutes and A. benhamiae
was harvested. Fungal cells were collected by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 3,500 g. A. benhamiae cells were
washed twice in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline
(Lonza) and stored in aliquots at -80°C. For RNA
sequencing, total RNA was isolated using RiboPure™Yeast Kit (Ambion Europe, Huntingdon, UK) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions from keratinocytes
co-incubated with conidia and conidia only grown in
cell culture medium for 96 h.
RNA was reverse transcribed using a SMART technique (Evrogen). The single-stranded DNA was then
amplified using SMART primers for 20 cycles to produce double-stranded DNA in sufficient quantity for
GS-FLX sequencing (Roche). We generated A. benhamiae transcriptome data by sequencing parts of individual cDNAs after fragmentation by nebulization using
454/FLX sequencing technology. For postprocessing of
these sequences, SMART adapters were identified and
clipped using a combination of perl scripts plus cross_match. After further cleaning with seqclean (removal of
polyA tails and low complexity regions), 682,580 ESTs
(98.8 Mb) remained for mapping.
Mapping of the ESTs to the repeat-masked A. benhamiae genome as a backbone was done in two major
steps. First, we used Blat [46] to assign each EST to its
most probable position in the genome allowing a maximum intron length of 10 kb. A valid hit required a
minimum length of 30 bp and a minimum identity of
90% to the backbone sequence. In the second step, each
EST was realigned to its most probable position utilizing
a slightly modified version of Exalin [47] that implements the Smith-Waterman algorithm and information
theory for better alignments and intron prediction.
Using this approach, we were able to align 571,963
ESTs to the genome. Finally, EST positions were translated to positions of known gene models if possible. In
this way, we determined for each gene a set of ESTs
and thereby its raw expression level. The data were normalized to the total number of mapping ESTs. Table S9
in Additional file 6 shows the total numbers of generated reads, the reads mapped to a genome, and the
reads in gene models for each technical replicate of
infection and control samples.
The raw counts for the transcripts were analyzed
using the R Statistical Computing Environment and the

Burmester et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R7
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R7

Bioconductor packages DESeq [48] and edgeR [49]. Both
packages provide statistical routines for determining differential expression in digital gene expression data using
a model based on the negative binomial distribution.
The resulting P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false
discovery rate [50]. Genes with an adjusted P-value
<0.05 found by both packages were assigned as differentially expressed.
The RNAseq data are submitted to the Sequence read
archive of NCBI and are available with the accession
numbers [NCBI:SRR070551] and [NCBI:SRR070552]
(sample runs) and [NCBI:SRR070553] and [NCBI:
SRR070554] (control runs).

was carried out in an Ettan IPGphor II using a 0 to 1
kV gradient for 11 h, 1 to 8 kV for 3 h and finally 8 kV
for 24 kVh. Afterwards, strips were incubated for 15
minutes in equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 2% (w/v)
SDS, 75 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.8, 30% (v/v) glycerol) with 65
mM DTT, followed by an alkylation step of the proteins
with 135 mM iodoacetamide in equilibration buffer
under the same conditions. Separation of proteins by
the second dimension was carried out using pre-cast
Criterion gels (12.5% (w/v), Tris-HCl; Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were
visualized by Colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250
staining [53].
Protein identification

Northern blotting

Total RNA from mycelial samples was isolated using
RiboPure™-Yeast Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was denatured (15
minutes, 60°C; 5% (v/v) formaldehyde, 50% (v/v) formamide, 40 mM MOPS, pH 7) and separated by agarose
gel electrophoresis (1.2% agarose, 40 mM MOPS, 10
mM sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA, 2% (v/v) formaldehyde, pH 7). Blotting, hybridization and chemoluminescent signal detection were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (DIG Application Manual
for Filter Hybridization, Roche). Gel load and blot signal
strength were quantified and normalized using Bio-Rad
(Munich, Germany) Quantity One (v4.6.7) software.
Secretome analysis

For cultivation of A. benhamiae, medium was prepared
as follows: 10 g/l keratin (MP Biomedicals Europe, Illkirch, France) was autoclaved in water and subsequently
20 mM potassium phosphate pH 5.5, 0.4 mM MgSO 4,
77 mM NaCl, 5 mM glucose and 0.5% (v/v) SL-8 trace
elements [51] were added. Microconidia obtained from
A. benhamiae cultivated for 7 days on MAT agar at 30°
C were used to inoculate shaking flasks at a final spore
concentration of 106 per milliliter. After cultivation for
2 days at 200 rpm and 30°C, cultures were filtered
through Miracloth (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany)
and the supernatant was centrifuged at 4,000 g for 20
minutes at 4°C. Secreted proteins were precipitated with
10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid/6.5 mM DTT overnight
at 4°C. The precipitate was pelleted at 4,000 g for 20
minutes at 4°C and resuspended twice in ice-cold acetone/water (9:1)/6.5 mM DTT followed by subsequent
centrifugation steps. The air-dried pellet was dissolved
in lysis buffer 3, as described [52]. Immobiline DryStrips
of 11 cm covering a pH range from 3 to 10 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were rehydrated overnight according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isoelectric focusing

Protein spots were excised from the gels and digested
with sequencing-grade Trypsin (Promega, Mannheim,
Germany) as described elsewhere [54]. Eluted peptides
were mixed with an equal amount of a saturated alphacyano-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) solution in aqueous 30% (v/v) acetonitrile and
spotted on an MTP anchor-chip 800/384 (Bruker Daltonics). Mass spectrometry spectra were acquired with
an Ultraflex I TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics) mass spectrometer using Peptide Mass Standard II (Bruker Daltonics) as calibrant. The five most intense mass
spectrometry signals were selected for tandem mass
spectrometry analysis. MASCOT (version 2.1.02; Matrix
Science, London, UK) searching against protein predictions from the A. benhamiae genome and the NCBI
database (taxa fungi) was used for protein identification
with the following the parameters: fixed modification of
cysteine to S-carbamidomethyl derivatives, variable
methionine oxidation, no missed cleavage and a peptide
mass tolerance of 200 ppm.
PKS and NRPS domain architecture prediction

The PKS and NRPS domain architecture was predicted
using the InterProScan [55] and NRPS-PKS [56] tools.
Generation of the phylogenetic tree

For genome-based phylogeny, 23 proteins from 28 fully
sequenced fungal genomes were used for the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships of A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum (Additional file 3). The 23
ortholog groups were selected based on the KOG (clusters of orthologous groups for eukaryotes) assignments,
as described by Xu et al. [23]. Only KOGs without paralogs, that is, proteins represented by a single protein in a
species, were taken into consideration. Five proteins
from the publication of Xu et al. [23] were not confirmed as fulfilling this requirement. Thus, they were
not included. The genome set selected for the survey

Burmester et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R7
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/1/R7

was non-redundant, that is, we did not consider four
closely related Candida species as well as six Saccharomyces species, but only representatives of each clade,
that is, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae, respectively. By
contrast, we included all available Pezizomycetes, since
A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum presumably belong to
this phylum. A representative of Zygomycota (Rhizopus
oryzae) was used as an outgroup. The considered genomes were as follws. Eurotiomycetes: Arthroderma benhamiae, Trichophyton verrucosum, Aspergillus clavatus,
Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus
nidulans, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus terreus, Botrytis
cinerea, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum,
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,
Stagonospora nodorum, Uncinocarpus reesii. Sordariomycetes: Chaetomium globosum, Fusarium graminearum, Magnaporthe grisea, Neurospora crassa.
Saccharomycotina: Candida albicans, Lodderomyces
elongisporus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taphrinomycotina: Schizosaccharomyces japonicus. Basidiomycota:
Coprinus cinereus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Puccinia
graminis, Ustilago maydis. Zygomycota: Rhizopus oryzae.
The protein sets for each KOG protein shared among
the 28 genomes were collected. Each set was then
aligned by ClustalX, and the conserved blocks were
extracted using the Gblocks tool [57] with allowance of
smaller final blocks (five amino acids) and gap positions
within the final blocks using otherwise default parameters. The extracted blocks were concatenated for
each species. The phylogenetic analysis was performed
using PHYML [58] for the construction of the maximal
likelihood tree, and PHYLIP for the construction the
neighbor joining tree, with the Jones-Taylor-Thornton
model of the amino acid substitution in both cases. The
neighbor joining and maximal likelihood trees had identical architecture.
The phylogenetic trees for proteases and enzymes
involved in SM production were obtained using PHYLIP
for the construction of the neighbor joining tree, with
the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of the amino acid
substitution.
