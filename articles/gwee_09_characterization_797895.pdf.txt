Abstract
Background: Vasopressin and oxytocin are mammalian neurohypophysial hormones with distinct
functions. Vasopressin is involved mainly in osmoregulation and oxytocin is involved primarily in
parturition and lactation. Jawed vertebrates contain at least one homolog each of vasopressin and
oxytocin, whereas only a vasopressin-family hormone, vasotocin, has been identified in jawless
vertebrates. The genes encoding vasopressin and oxytocin are closely linked tail-to-tail in eutherian
mammals whereas their homologs in chicken, Xenopus and coelacanth (vasotocin and mesotocin) are
linked tail-to-head. In contrast, their pufferfish homologs, vasotocin and isotocin, are located on the
same strand of DNA with isotocin located upstream of vasotocin and separated by five genes. These
differences in the arrangement of the two genes in different bony vertebrate lineages raise
questions about their origin and ancestral arrangement. To trace the origin of these genes, we have
sequenced BAC clones from the neurohypophysial gene loci in a cartilaginous fish, the elephant
shark (Callorhinchus milii), and in a jawless vertebrate, the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum).
We have also analyzed the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in an invertebrate chordate, the
amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae).
Results: The elephant shark neurohypophysial hormone genes encode vasotocin and oxytocin,
and are linked tail-to-head like their homologs in coelacanth and non-eutherian tetrapods. Besides
the hypothalamus, the two genes are also expressed in the ovary. In addition, the vasotocin gene is
expressed in the kidney, rectal gland and intestine. These expression profiles indicate a paracrine
role for the two hormones. The lamprey locus contains a single neurohypophysial hormone gene,
the vasotocin. The synteny of genes in the lamprey locus is conserved in elephant shark, coelacanth
and tetrapods but disrupted in teleost fishes. The amphioxus locus encodes a single
neurohypophysial hormone, designated as [Ile4]vasotocin.
Conclusion: The vasopressin- and oxytocin-family of neurohypophysial hormones evolved in a
common ancestor of jawed vertebrates through tandem duplication of the ancestral vasotocin gene.
The duplicated genes were linked tail-to-head like their homologs in elephant shark, coelacanth and
non-eutherian tetrapods. In contrast to the conserved linkage of the neurohypophysial genes in
these vertebrates, the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus has experienced extensive
rearrangements in the teleost lineage.

Background
Neurohypophysial hormones are an ancient family of
structurally and functionally related nonapeptides, with
representatives found in deuterostomes as well as in protostomes. Vasopressin and oxytocin are mammalian neurohypophysial hormones with distinct activities:
vasopressin has renal urine reabsorption (antidiuretic)
and blood-pressure raising (vasopressor) activities while
oxytocin has uterus-contracting (uterotonic) and milkejecting (galactagogic) activities. Vasopressin is a basic
peptide while oxytocin is a neutral peptide, a characteristic determined mainly by the amino acid at the 8th position. All jawed vertebrates contain at least one
vasopressin-family, basic peptide and one oxytocin-family, neutral peptide whereas only a vasopressin-family
peptide has so far been identified in jawless vertebrates
such as lamprey and hagfishes [1,2]. Vasotocin is the vasopressin-family peptide in all non-mammalian vertebrates.
Oxytocin-family peptides, however, exhibit a wide diversity. The oxytocin homolog in non-eutherian tetrapods
and lobe-finned fishes (lungfish and coelacanth) is mesotocin and in ray-finned fishes is isotocin. The cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, skates and chimaeras) contain at
least eight types of oxytocin-family peptides. They are
asvatocin and phasvatocin in the spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula); asvatocin and phasitocin in the Japanese banded dogfish (Triakis scyllium); valitocin and
aspargtocin in the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias); glumitocin in skates (Raja); isotocin in the electric ray (Torpedo mormorata); and oxytocin in a holocephalian
chimaera, the ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) (see Table 1). It
should be noted that these neuropeptides are named

according to certain unique residues and their biochemical properties and not according to any phylogenetic
grouping. For example, oxytocin molecule is present in
placental mammals and in a cartilaginous fish, the ratfish.
The presence of oxytocin in these distantly related vertebrates is the result of independent nucleotide substitutions in the two lineages.
The neurohypophysial hormones are synthesized as part
of a larger precursor molecule comprising a signal peptide, the nonapeptide hormone, and a neurophysin. The
precursors of the vasopressin-family hormones and the
isotocin hormone in teleost fishes contain an additional
peptide, the copeptin, at the carboxyl terminal. In placental mammals, the genes encoding vasopressin and oxytocin are closely linked in a tail-to-tail orientation.
Nevertheless, the two genes are expressed in distinct magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nuclei and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. In addition,
vasopressin is expressed in the parvocellular neurons of
the paraventricular nuclei and suprachiasmatic nuclei [3].
The cis-regulatory elements that mediate the hypothalamus-specific expression of the two genes have been shown
to be located in their intergenic region [4-7]. In contrast to
the tail-to-tail arrangement of vasopressin and oxytocin
genes in placental mammals, their homologs in opossum,
chicken, Xenopus and coelacanth are located on the same
strand of DNA and are closely linked in a tail-to-head orientation (Fig 1). Interestingly, although their homologs in
pufferfishes (vasotocin and isotocin) reside on the same
strand of DNA, they are arranged in a different order: isotocin gene is located upstream of vasotocin gene and sepa-

rated by five unrelated genes (Fig 1) [8]. These marked
differences in the organization of the vasopressin- and
oxytocin-family genes in different bony vertebrate lineages raise questions about their origin and the organization of the ancestral vasopressin-family and oxytocinfamily genes.
The cartilaginous fishes are the oldest group of living
jawed vertebrates that diverged from bony vertebrates
about 450 million years ago [9]. The ancestor of jawed
vertebrates split from jawless vertebrates about 477 million years ago [10]. The neurohypophysial hormone gene
locus has not been sequenced from either cartilaginous
fishes or jawless fishes. Characterization of the neurohypophysial hormone gene loci in these vertebrates should
shed light on the origin and organization of the ancestral
vasopressin- and oxytocin-family genes. In this study, we
have sequenced and characterized the neurohypophysial
hormone gene loci in a cartilaginous fish, the elephant
shark (Callorhinchus milii) and in a jawless vertebrate, the
Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). We have also
identified and analyzed the neurohypophysial hormone
gene in the recently completed genome sequence of the
amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), an invertebrate chordate which represents the most basal group of living chordates (the cephalochordates).
The cartilaginous fishes are divided into two groups: elasmobranchs (sharks, rays and skates) and holocephalians
(chimaeras). The elephant shark is a holocephalian chimaera that inhabits the continental shelves off southern
Australia and New Zealand at depths of 200 to 500
meters. We chose elephant shark as a representative cartilaginous fish because it has the smallest genome (910

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/47

Mb) among cartilaginous fishes [11,12]. Like lungfishes
and coelacanths, cartilaginous fishes conduct urea-based
osmoregulation. Cartilaginous fishes, particularly the
marine species, maintain their plasma iso-osmotic or
slightly hyper-osmotic to the seawater mainly through the
retention of urea. In addition to the gut, kidney and gills,
which are the major osmoregulatory organs in fishes,
marine cartilaginous fishes contain a fourth osmoregulatory organ, the rectal gland that is devoted exclusively to
sodium chloride excretion. Interestingly, elephant shark
does not contain a discrete rectal gland like the marine
elasmobranchs. Instead, its rectal gland comprises about
10 tubular structures located in the wall of post-valvular
intestine [13]. However, elephant shark maintains its
plasma levels of Na (~300 mmol l-1) and urea (~450
mmol l-1) similar to those in marine elasmobranchs [13].

Results and discussion
Neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in the elephant
shark
We probed an elephant shark BAC library with a fragment
of the elephant shark vasotocin gene and identified six
overlapping BAC clones. Two of the BAC clones, #191N1
and #208M19, were sequenced completely to obtain 167
kb contiguous sequence (GenBank accession number
FJ185172). It contains sequences for vasotocin and oxytocin
genes in addition to three other complete genes
(Prosapip1, Ubox5 and Gnrh2) and one partial gene (Ptpra)
(Fig 2A). Oxytocin is typically only found in placental
mammals and is involved in lactation, uterine smooth
muscle contraction and maternal behavior. However, oxytocin had been previously purified from the hypothalamus of a holocephalian cartilaginous fish, the ratfish, the
only non-mammalian vertebrate to contain oxytocin [14].
The presence of oxytocin gene in elephant shark indicates
that oxytocin is most likely common to all holocephalian
cartilaginous fishes. The elephant shark vasotocin and oxytocin genes are arranged tail-to-head like their homologs
in coelacanth, Xenopus, chicken and opossum. They each
comprise three exons and two introns like their homologs
in other vertebrates. The introns of elephant shark vasotocin and oxytocin genes (1.16 kb to 3.24 kb) are longer
than their homologs in human (84 bp to 1.37 kb) but
comparable to that in coelacanth (1.55 kb to 5.57 kb).
The intergenic distance between the elephant shark genes
is, however, shorter (8.3 kb) than that between the genes
in human (12 kb) and coelacanth (15.4 kb). Overall,
repetitive sequences account for 41.6% of the elephant
shark locus with LINEs and SINEs contributing 16.9% and
20.1% respectively (Fig 2A).

vasotocin precursors in other vertebrates (Fig 3). An atypical tripeptide sequence, Gly-Arg-Arg, links the hormone
to the neurophysin and presumably acts as a signal for
proteolytic processing and carboxyl-terminal amidation
of vasotocin. All the cysteine residues that are considered
important for the conformation of neurophysin are conserved in the elephant shark vasotocin neurophysin (Fig
4). The copeptin moiety at the carboxyl terminal includes
an N-linked glycosylation site that is conserved in all vertebrates except teleost fishes and lamprey (Fig. 4). It also
includes a leucine-rich core segment similar to the copeptin of vasopressin-family precursors in all vertebrates (Fig
4).
The elephant shark oxytocin gene codes for a shorter 126amino acid protein which includes a signal peptide, the
oxytocin nonapeptide and a neurophysin (Fig 3). Oxytocin is attached to the neurophysin via a typical tripeptide sequence Gly-Lys-Arg that is known to act as a signal
for proteolytic processing and carboxyl-terminal amidation of the nonapeptide. Like the oxytocin-family precursors in tetrapods and coelacanth, the elephant shark

oxytocin does not contain a copeptin (Figs 3 and 5). Thus,
these precursors are different from the oxytocin-family
precursor in teleost fishes which contains a copeptin moiety. However, the teleost fish oxytocin-family precursor
does not contain an arginine residue between the neurophysin and the copeptin (Fig 4 and 5), and therefore, the
copeptin may not be cleaved into a separate moiety.
No evidence for gene conversion between elephant shark
vasotocin and oxytocin genes
The second exons of human and bovine vasotocin and oxytocin genes that encode the central region of the neurophysin exhibit an unusually high level of sequence
identity (Table 2). In the case of bovine genes, in addition
to 197 bp of the exonic sequence, 135 bp of the preceding
intron is also totally conserved. This observation had led
to the hypothesis that the two genes have experienced a
recent gene conversion event [15]. We have previously
reported that the second exons of the coelacanth vasotocin
and mesotocin genes also show a high degree of sequence
identity at the amino acid (97%) and nucleotide (98%)
levels [8]. However, we have shown that these exons do

not have a high GC3 content which is a signature of a gene
conversion event, and therefore proposed that the high
sequence conservation is the result of purifying selection
acting on the nucleotide sequences rather than due to a
gene conversion event [8].
The second exons of the elephant shark vasotocin and oxytocin genes also exhibit a high level of sequence identity at

the amino acid (95.1%) and nucleotide (97.1%) levels.
Moreover, the high level of sequence identity extends into
14 bp of the 5' intron and 6 bp of the 3' intron (Fig 3). To
determine whether these exons have experienced a gene
conversion, we estimated the GC3 content of all the three
exons of the two genes. The GC3 content of the second
exons of the two genes is in fact lower (69 and 72%) than
that of their homologs in mammals (94 to 95.5%), and is

comparable to that of their respective first exons (60 and
70%) and third exons (57 and 68%) (Table 2). Furthermore, the GC3 content of the second exons is comparable
to that of the three exons of the single vasotocin gene in the
Japanese lamprey (73.5% to 76.2%; Table 2). Together,
these data suggest that there is no evidence for gene conversion between the second exons of the elephant shark
vasotocin and oxytocin genes and that the GC3 content of
the second exons of these genes merely reflects the GC3

content of the ancestral vasotocin gene in the lamprey. It is
therefore likely that the high identity of the second exons
of the elephant shark vasotocin and oxytocin genes is also
due to purifying selection acting at the nucleotide level
similar to that on the second exons of the coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin genes. This implies that the second
exons encode a functional element besides coding for
amino acids. This conserved element may be involved in
transcript stability, microRNA binding [16], enhancing

Expression patterns of elephant shark vasotocin and
oxytocin genes
We determined the expression patterns of the elephant
shark vasotocin and oxytocin genes by a semi-quantitative
reverse transcription PCR. Single strand cDNA was prepared from about one microgram of total RNA each from
hypothalamus, brain (excluding hypothalamus), gills,
heart, kidney, liver, muscle, ovary, pancreas, rectal gland,
spleen, intestine, testis and uterus; and PCR was carried
out using the same volume of cDNA preparation from different tissues. The results therefore indicate the relative
levels of expression of each gene between various tissues.
Interestingly, besides the hypothalamus, both vasotocin
and oxytocin genes were found to express in some peripheral tissues indicating that they play a paracrine role in
these tissues. Vasotocin was found to express at relatively
high levels in the ovary and at low levels in the kidney,
rectal gland and intestine and oxytocin was found to
express at moderate levels in the ovary (Fig 6). To the best
of our knowledge, no such peripheral expression of neurohypophysial hormone genes has been reported in teleost fishes or in non-mammalian tetrapods. However, it is
well known that these genes express in peripheral tissues
in some mammals. For example, oxytocin gene is expressed
in the uterine epithelium, placenta, amnion and intrauterine tissues in rats; in the amnion, chorion, decidua intrauterine tissues and cumulus cells surrounding the oocytes
in humans; and in the corpus luteum and testis in cows
[18]. The vasopressin gene is expressed in the aorta [19,20],
pancreas [19] and testis in rats [21]. Consequently, it has
been proposed that these hormones play a paracrine role
in mammals. The osmoregulatory system in marine carti-

laginous fishes involves the kidney, gills, rectal gland and
gastrointestinal tract. The kidney excretes water, salt and
nitrogenous wastes such as urea and trimethylamine
oxide; the gills eliminate nitrogen in the form of ammonia; and the gut epithelium reabsorbs water, salt and
nutrients. The rectal gland is a highly specialized saltsecreting organ unique to marine cartilaginous fishes [22].
The expression of vasotocin gene in the elephant shark kidney, rectal gland and intestine suggests that vasotocin
plays a paracrine role in the osmoregulatory functions of
these tissues. In mammals, oxytocin is known to induce
smooth muscle contraction in the ovary and uterus and
thereby play a role in ovulation and parturition [23]. In
addition, oxytocin synthesized in the human cumulus
cells has been suggested to play a role in fertilization and
early embryonic development [18]. In elephant shark, fertilization and partial embryonic development occurs
internally ('ovoviviparous'). Mating normally occurs
before the spawning season and females store sperm is a
special pouch until the eggs mature. Eggs mature in
batches and the stored sperm is used for fertilization as
and when the eggs mature. During spring, females migrate
into shallow bays and inlets and lay eggs in shallow soft
sediment habitats. Each female lays two fertilized eggs at
a time every 7 to 8 days over a period of two to three
months [24]. The elephant sharks for this study were collected in shallow waters during the peak spawning season.
The expression of both oxytocin and vasotocin genes in the
elephant shark ovary during this period suggests a role for
these hormones in ovulation (i.e., release of mature
oocytes from the follicles) and/or in 'parturition' (release
of fertilized eggs) in this ovoviviparous vertebrate. In vivo
and in vitro studies on the effects of vasotocin and oxytocin should provide evidence to support this hypothesis.

Neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in the Japanese
lamprey
The living jawless vertebrates are represented by the lampreys and hagfishes. So far only a vasotocin gene has been
cloned in these vertebrates [1,25]. However, it is not
known if they also contain an oxytocin-family gene. To
determine this we sequenced the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in the Japanese lamprey. We screened a
Japanese lamprey BAC library using a probe for the vasotocin gene and identified one positive BAC clone
(#191L19). This BAC was sequenced completely. It contains a 90-kb insert (GenBank accession number
FJ195978) that encodes three complete genes: vasotocin,
Gnrh2 and Ptpra. This locus contains only 4.7% repetitive
sequences, with LINEs and SINEs contributing to 0.5%
and 0.4%, respectively (Fig 2B). Thus the amount of repetitive sequences in the lamprey locus is considerably lower
than that in the homologous loci in the elephant shark
(42% repeats) and coelacanth (17% repeats) [8]. The lamprey vasotocin gene comprises three exons and two
introns like the vasopressin- and oxytocin-family genes in
jawed vertebrates. The relative order and orientation of
the three genes in the lamprey locus are identical to that
of their homologs in elephant shark, coelacanth, Xenopus,
chicken, and opossum. However, the lamprey locus lacks
an oxytocin-family gene in the intergenic region between
the vasopressin-family gene and the Gnrh2 gene that is
present in these vertebrates (Fig 1B). Although there is a
possibility that a oxytocin-family may be present elsewhere in the lamprey genome, previous screenings of
cDNA libraries from the Japanese lamprey and hagfish
[1,25] were successful in identifying only a vasotocin gene
in these vertebrates. We therefore conclude that jawless
vertebrates do not contain an oxytocin-family gene
present in jawed vertebrates.
Neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in amphioxus
The living chordates are classified into three major lineages, the cephalochordates (e.g., amphioxus), urochordates (tunicates) and vertebrates. The cephalochordates
are the most basal group of chordates and the urochordates are the sister group of vertebrates [26]. Recently a
gene encoding a vasopressin-related peptide has been
cloned in the urochordate, Ciona intestinalis. This gene
comprises three exons and two introns like the vasopressin- and oxytocin-family genes in vertebrates. However, unlike the nonapeptides encoded by the vertebrate
genes, the Ciona gene codes for a 13-amino acid peptide
hormone (designated as Ci-vasopressin; Table 3[27-38])
that lacks a carboxyl-terminal amidation signal (Gly-LysArg) [39]. Interestingly, in another urochordate, Styela plicata, a gene encoding an oxytocin-like peptide has been
cloned. This gene also comprises three exons and two
introns but codes for a 14-amino acid peptide hormone
(Table 3). It however contains a typical carboxyl-terminal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/47

amidation signal. This prohormone is designated as Styela
oxytocin-related peptide (SOP) [40]. To date no neurohypophysial hormone gene has been cloned in cephalochordates. Recently, a whole-genome sequence of a
cephalochordate, the amphioxus has been completed
[26]. We searched for neurohypophysial hormone genes
in the amphioxus genome assembly by TBLASTN algorithm using the elephant shark and lamprey neurohypophysial hormone precursor protein sequences as queries.
Only one gene with a high similarity to vasopressin-family peptide was identified. We annotated the coding exons
based on homology to the elephant shark and lamprey
neurohypophysial hormone genes, and refined the exonintron boundaries by manual inspection. The amphioxus
gene comprises three exons and two introns, with the
positions and phases of introns being identical to that of
the vasopressin- and oxytocin-family genes in vertebrates.
The 167-amino acid prohormone encoded by this gene
consists of a signal peptide, a nonapeptide hormone, neurophysin and copeptin similar to the vasotocin and vasopressin prohormones in vertebrates (Fig 4). The
nonapeptide is linked to the neurophysin molecule by a
typical tripeptide sequence (Gly-Lys-Arg) that is known to
act as a signal for proteolytic processing and C-terminal
amidation of the hormone. The nonapeptide hormone,
however, contains Ile at the 4th position unlike the vertebrate vasotocin and vasopressin peptides which contain a
Gln at this position (Fig 4). We therefore designate the
amphioxus peptide as [Ile4]vasotocin. The amphioxus
copeptin does not contain an N-glycosylation site similar
to the copeptin in teleost fishes and lamprey. It also lacks
a Leucine-rich core segment that is present in the copeptin
of all vertebrates (Fig 4). The presence of a typical nonapeptide neurohypophysial hormone in amphioxus indicates that urochordates (Ciona and Styela) are the only
exception among metazoans that do not contain a typical
nonapeptide hormone (see Table 3). The amphioxus
[Ile4]vasotocin gene is flanked by RNR and ST8sia2 genes,
which are unrelated to the genes flanking the neurohypophysial hormone genes in vertebrates (Fig. 7). The Ciona
neuropeptide gene, Ci-vasopressin, is flanked by genes
(RPS6KA3 and CELSR3) that are unrelated to the genes
flanking the neurohypophysial hormone genes in vertebrates as well as in amphioxus (Fig. 7). Thus, the synteny
of genes in amphioxus is not conserved in Ciona, and the
synteny of genes in vertebrates is conserved neither in
amphioxus nor in Ciona.
Origin and evolutionary history of vertebrate
neurohypophysial hormone genes
Neurohypophysial hormones are an ancient family of
hormones with representatives found in diverse taxa
among invertebrates and vertebrates. However, invertebrates contain either a vasopressin-family peptide or an
oxytocin-family peptide (Table 3) but seldom both pep-

tides. Although some invertebrates like octopus contain
two peptides, cephalotoxin and octopressin, both are oxytocin-like peptides [41,42]. In contrast to invertebrates, all
jawed vertebrates contain at least one member each of
vasopressin- and oxytocin-family peptides. In jawless vertebrates, which occupy an intermediary position between
invertebrates and jawed vertebrates, only a vasotocin gene
has been cloned so far. In this study, we sequenced the

neurohypophysial gene loci in a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark, and a jawless vertebrate, the Japanese lamprey. We also characterized this locus in the genome of
amphioxus, a cephalochordate. Our study shows that
while both amphioxus and lamprey contain a single neurohypophysial hormone gene that encodes a basic vasopressin-family peptide, elephant shark contains both a
vasopressin-family gene and a oxytocin-family gene that

are closely linked tail-to-head (Fig 7). These data suggest
that the two families of peptides arose in a common
ancestor of jawed vertebrates through a tandem duplication of the ancestral vasotocin gene. The coding sequence
of the duplicate gene has subsequently diverged to code
for a neutral peptide thereby giving rise to the oxytocinfamily of neurohypophysial hormone. The different patterns of expression of vasotocin and oxytocin genes in elephant shark also imply that, in addition to mutations in
the protein coding sequence, the regulatory region of the
duplicated gene(s) has also undergone changes to confer
a different pattern of expression to the two daughter
genes. Investigation of the expression pattern of vasotocin

gene in lamprey should shed light on the ancestral expression pattern, and how it has diverged in the daughter
genes. Unfortunately, due to the unavailability of RNA
from various tissues of the Japanese lamprey, we could
not determine the expression pattern of the vasotocin gene
in the lamprey.
The tail-to-head orientation of the elephant shark vasotocin and oxytocin genes indicates that this was the ancestral state of the two genes soon after the duplication of the
vasotocin gene. The close linkage and organization of these
genes have been conserved in coelacanth, Xenopus,
chicken and opossum genomes while the oxytocin gene

Page 11 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:47

has undergone a local inversion in human and rodent
genomes (Fig 7). In contrast to these vertebrates, the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in pufferfishes has
undergone extensive rearrangements. The isotocin gene in
fugu has been translocated to a position upstream of vasotocin gene and the two genes are separated by five unrelated genes. In addition, the two genes located
downstream of the vasotocin gene in fugu (CL1 and
UGNT) are unrelated to the genes present at a similar
position (Gnrh2 and Ptpra) in other vertebrates (Fig. 7). A
search for the neurohypophysial hormone genes in the
genome assemblies of other teleost fishes such as the
stickleback, medaka and zebrafish on the UCSC Genome
Browser [30] revealed that while the arrangements of isotocin and vasotocin genes in stickleback (ChrXIII) and
medaka (Chr9) are similar to that in fugu, the two genes
are located on separate chromosomes (Chr5 and Chr8
respectively) in zebrafish. These data indicate that the
neurohypophysial hormone gene locus has undergone
extensive rearrangements in teleost fishes, in contrast to
its well conserved synteny in other vertebrates including
the jawless lamprey. These findings are consistent with
previous observations that teleost fish genomes have
experienced a higher rate of chromosomal rearrangements compared to other vertebrates (reviewed in [43]).
The rearrangements in teleost fishes might be related to
the "fish-specific" whole genome duplication that
occurred in the teleost ancestor [44,45]. The duplicated
gene loci generated by this whole genome duplication
might have facilitated rearrangements between paralogous chromosomal segments through homologous
recombination.
We would like to add that our efforts to build a phylogenetic tree of invertebrate and vertebrate neurohypophysial
hormone genes resulted in an anomalous gene tree in
which the vasopressin- and oxytocin-family genes in fugu,
elephant shark, coelacanth and mammals clustered with
each other suggesting that the two genes originated independently in each lineage (Additional file 1). This is
highly unlikely and is an artifact of the phylogenetic analysis due to the highly conserved sequences of these two
paralogous genes. For such paralogous genes, the conservation of synteny in different taxa is a much better indicator of their orthologous relationships.

Conclusion
We have characterized the neurohypophysial hormone
gene locus in elephant shark (a cartilaginous fish), Japanese lamprey (a jawless vertebrate) and amphioxus (a
cephalochordate) and showed that amphioxus and lamprey each contains a single gene belonging to the vasopressin-family while elephant shark contains a
vasopressin-family and an oxytocin-family gene that are
closely linked in a tail-to-head orientation. These results

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/47

indicate that vasopressin- and oxytocin-family peptides
evolved in a common ancestor of jawed vertebrates
through tandem duplication of the ancestral vasotocin
gene. The vasotocin and oxytocin genes in elephant shark
exhibit distinct expression patterns. Thus, this is a classical
example for the origin of a novel gene with a distinct function and expression pattern through duplication of an
ancestral gene. The synteny and order of genes in the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus are conserved in lamprey, elephant shark, coelacanth and tetrapods, but
disrupted in teleost fishes presumably due to the rearrangements facilitated by a whole genome duplication
event in the teleost fish ancestor.

Methods
Isolation of elephant shark BAC clone
The 1.4Ã elephant shark genome sequence assembly
http://esharkgenome.imcb.a-star.edu.sg/ was searched
using TBLASTN algorithm and human vasopressin and
oxytocin precursor protein sequences as queries. The
search identified three scaffolds (AAVX01010109.1,
AAVX01174980.1 and AAVX01018755.1) that contained
sequences with high similarity to the human vasopressin
and oxytocin genes. Searching these scaffold sequences
against non-redundant protein sequence database at
NCBI using BLASTX showed that they contained gene
fragments for vasotocin and oxytocin hormone precursors. A pair of primers (VTF 5'-CTG TTC CAG TGT TTG
CCG TGT-3' and VTR 5'-TAC CAT CAT CAC AGC AGA
TTC C-3') complementary to the second exon of the putative vasotocin gene fragment in scaffold AAVX01174980.1
was used to amplify a 217-bp fragment by PCR from the
elephant shark genomic DNA. The PCR cycling conditions
consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95Â°C for 2
min, followed by 35 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 sec, 60Â°C for 1
min and 72Â°C for 30 sec, with a final elongation step at
72Â°C for 5 min. The PCR product was gel-purified using
GeneClean (Qbiogene, Irvine, USA), labeled with [Î±-32P]
dCTP using Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and used as a probe to
screen an elephant shark BAC library (IMCB_Eshark BAC
library cloned in pCCBAC-EcoRI). Six positive BAC clones
(#65F8, #113K9, #157M2, #191N1, #208M19,
#209O22) were identified. Two of these clones (#191N1
and #208M19) were selected for sequencing. Comparing
the sequences of the three elephant shark scaffolds that we
identified using human vasopressin precursor protein
sequence to the sequence of these BACs showed that they
all belong to this locus.
Isolation of lamprey BAC clone
Using the following primers (LPF 5'-ATC TGC TGC GGG
GAG GCC ATG GG-3' and FPR 5'-CAG GCC GGG AGC
TCC RCA YTT-3') complementary to the coding sequence
of the lamprey vasotocin gene (BAA06669), a 140-bp frag-

ment of the vasotocin gene was amplified from the Japanese lamprey genomic DNA. An 'overgo' probe was
prepared for this sequence by using a pair of oligonucleotides with an 8-bp overlap at their 3' ends (LPF 5'-ATC
TGC TGC GGG GAG GCC ATG GG-3' and LPR2 5'-CAC
CCA GGC GAC AGC CCA TGG C-3'). The overlapping oligonucleotides were mixed in equal proportion (10 pmol/
Î¼l of each) and annealed by incubating at 80Â°C for 5 min,
followed by incubation at 37Â°C for 10 min and then
transferred to ice. The annealed oligonucleotides were
extended and labeled with [Î±-32P]dATP and [Î±-32P]dCTP
by primer extension with Klenow at room temperature for
30 min to produce a 36-bp dual-labeled overgo probe.
The unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passage
through a Sephadex-G50 column (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The overgo probe was then used to screen
a Japanese lamprey BAC library (IMCB_Japanese lamprey
BAC library, cloned in pCCBAC-EcoRI; average insert size,
~100 kb; unpublished) and only one positive BAC clone
(#161L19) was identified, presumably due to an uneven
representation of the genome.
Sequencing and assembly of elephant shark and lamprey
BAC clones
Two of the elephant shark BAC clones (#191N1 and
#208M19) and the single lamprey BAC clone (#161L19),
were sequenced completely using the shotgun sequencing
strategy. Briefly, BAC DNA was fragmented by hydrodynamic shearing (Hydroshear, GeneMachines, San Carlos,
CA) and then end-repaired by Klenow treatment. Fragments in the size range of 2â3 kb were gel purified and
subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK vector.
High quality sequences were acquired by sequencing both
ends of plasmid inserts using standard BigDye Terminator
v3.1 chemistry on an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer. Raw shotgun DNA sequence reads were quality-trimmed and
assembled with Phred/Phrap/Consed software package

were filled by 'primer-walking' using BAC DNA as a template or by sequencing bridge clones or by sequencing
PCR products.

while that of coelacanth was retrieved from GenBank
(accession number EU284132). Multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences were carried out with ClustalX
Version 1.83 [46]. Repetitive sequences were identified
using the RepeatMasker (version open-3.1.6) [31] and
GIRI Repbase [47].
RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the elephant shark tissues
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). About one microgram of total RNA from each tissue was reverse transcribed
using SuperScriptâ¢ First-Strand Synthesis System for RTPCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The single strand cDNA was resuspended in 50 Î¼l of
water and one microliter was used for PCR. PCR primers
were designed to amplify across exons 2 and 3 of the neurohypophysial hormone genes. Care was taken to avoid
regions of high conservation. Elephant shark actin was
amplified as an internal control for the quality of RNA
and cDNA.

The following primers were used in PCR: vasotocin
(sense, 5'-CAC CGG GAA TCT GCT GTG ATG-3'; antisense, 5'-GAT ACC GCC TGG TAC TTC TTTG-3'), oxytocin
(sense, 5'-GCT CAG AGC GTG GCA AGT-3'; antisense, 5'GGT CCA CGG CAC AGC TTT-3'), and actin (sense, 5'GGG TAT TGT CAC CAA CTG GGAC-3'; antisense, 5'-TCT
ACC CGT GTC ACA CCC AC-3'). PCR amplification cycles
include an initial denaturation at 95Â°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 sec, 55Â°C for 30 sec and
72Â°C for 1 min, followed by an extension step at 72Â°C for
5 min.
