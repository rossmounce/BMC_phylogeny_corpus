Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic position of turtles is the most disputed aspect in the
reconstruction of the land vertebrate tree of life. This controversy has arisen after many different
kinds and revisions of investigations of molecular and morphological data. Three main hypotheses
of living sister-groups of turtles have resulted from them: all reptiles, crocodiles + birds or
squamates + tuatara. Although embryology has played a major role in morphological studies of
vertebrate phylogeny, data on developmental timing have never been examined to explore and test
the alternative phylogenetic hypotheses. We conducted a comprehensive study of published and
new embryological data comprising 15 turtle and eight tetrapod species belonging to other taxa,
integrating for the first time data on the side-necked turtle clade.
Results: The timing of events in organogenesis of diverse character complexes in all body regions
is not uniform across amniotes and can be analysed using a parsimony-based method. Changes in
the relative timing of particular events diagnose many clades of amniotes and include a phylogenetic
signal. A basal position of turtles to the living saurian clades is clearly supported by timing of
organogenesis data.
Conclusion: The clear signal of a basal position of turtles provided by heterochronic data implies
significant convergence in either molecular, adult morphological or developmental timing
characters, as only one of the alternative solutions to the phylogenetic conundrum can be right.
The development of a standard reference series of embryological events in amniotes as presented
here should enable future improvements and expansion of sampling and thus the examination of
other hypotheses about phylogeny and patterns of the evolution of land vertebrate development.

Background
The controversial phylogenetic position [1-5] of turtles
among land vertebrates and their highly derived anatomical features [6-8] have been subject of molecular and
morphological investigations. Three main hypotheses of
sister-groups have resulted from them (Figure 1), if we
ignore extinct taxa: the Sauria clade [9-11] or one of its
subgroups, the Archosauria [4,12], with crocodiles and

birds, or the Lepidosauria [13-15], with squamates and
the tuatara. In view of this conflict, new lines of evidence
to address this phylogenetic issue have been called for
[16]. Although embryology has played a major role in
morphological studies of vertebrate phylogeny and primary homology testing, data on developmental timing
have never been examined to explore and test these conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses about turtle origin.

Uncertain position of turtles in the amniote tree of life. The three (out of eight) main hypotheses for the position of
turtles within recent amniotes (bold dashed lines) and the alternative arrangements of cryptodire turtle groups compared in
this study. a, b and c and light dashed lines indicate the most basal taxon according to each hypothesis. For all hypotheses compared see Figure S1 and S2 and Table S6.

When examining the phylogenetic position of turtles
among amniotes, relationships within turtles themselves
are very relevant, as they determine the reconstruction of
the last common ancestor of the clade. The subdivision of
extant turtles into the side-necked pleurodires and the
hidden-necked cryptodires is widely accepted, but no consensus exists on the systematics of the cryptodire subgroups. Alternative groupings of these clades are also
included in our analysis (Figure 1a–c). Several additional
hypotheses for the origin of turtles have been suggested in
the past, but are no longer earnestly discussed, such as a
close relationship of turtles to the remaining Amniota, to
Aves, to Crocodylia, or to Mammalia [17].
Following recent comparative embryological work [18]
we defined 104 developmental characters of external morphology during organogenesis until hatching/birth based
on a comprehensive review of the literature and our own
study of embryological series (Figure 2). We examined 15
turtle and seven amniote species representing the other
major extant amniote clades (see Additional file 1: Tables
S1–S9, Figures S1–S5). One salamander was used as an
outgroup. We included the first comprehensive data on
side-necked turtle external embryology, represented by

Emydura subglobosa. We implemented Parsimov [19], a
parsimony-based method to quantify and compare
sequence heterochrony, and used the number of timing
shifts from the consensus data of the methods of character
optimisation as a criterion to support the robustness of a
particular branch [20-22]. There are 24 topologies on
which Parsimov was implemented, resulting from eight
alternative hypotheses for the position of turtles within
Tetrapoda (Figure S1, Table S6), each combined with the
three alternative topologies of the cryptodire subgroups
(Figure 1a–c, Figure S2). In addition, a total of 5356 event
pairs (= characters) were mapped: 3197 characters
(59.7%) were constant, and 875 variable characters
(16.3%) were parsimony-uninformative. The remaining
1284 characters (24%) were informative.

Results and discussion
The turtle-saurian relationship is clearly the best supported hypothesis using Parsimov [19], independent of
which hypothesis of inner turtle phylogeny is taken as reference. Among the latter, the cryptodire hypothesis with
sea turtles in a basal position [6] was the best supported
topology of all (56 consensus synapomorphies for unordered character states and 53 when using ordered charac-

ter states, Figures 3 and 4). The Archosauria hypothesis
has very little support in comparison to all main hypotheses considered (Figure 1, Table S6 and S7). The differences among the alternative phylogenies are distinctly
significant and suggest that embryological data of the
kind treated here are clearly most congruent with a basal
position of turtles within Sauropsida.
As additional exploration of the developmental data on
the alternative hypotheses, we mapped the event pairs on
the 24 topologies and counted tree length for each of

them. When mapping unordered character states, the tree
lengths range between 6383 and 6429 (Table S6). The
alternative tetrapod trees combined to one of the hypotheses of inner turtle relationship were the shortest ones
(Figure 3). The best-supported topologies with 6383 steps
are (Testudines + Sauria) and (Testudines + Lepidosauria).
In contrast, when using the ordered character state
approach, tree lengths range between 8886 and 8988
(Table S7). We found the shortest tree for a sister group
position of turtles to the Sauria clade (Table S7) with 8886
steps. It is notable that both for the ordered and unor-

dered character state approach the Testudines-Sauria tree
is among the shortest and that the archosaurian hypothesis is among the most weakly supported ones (Table S6
and S7).
The analysis presented here clearly shows that heterochronic shifts during tetrapod development do occur and
can be recognised even with the conservative Parsimov
method [19,22]. The number of autapomorphies at a
node on alternative phylogenies as test criterion is not a
standard cladistic analysis, and the relative timings of
events are not conventional characters either. But the differences among the alternative phylogenies are distinctly
significant and suggest that embryological data of the
kind treated here are clearly most congruent with a basal
position of turtles within Sauropsida.
Characters that are phylogenetically informative are
mostly those of the organogenic phase (from neurulation
until more or less all organs are present). Character complexes such as eye, ear, eyelid, mandibular arch, pharyngeal arches, pharyngeal slits and neck flexure are involved
in major temporal shifts. In contrast, we found few temporal shifts during limb development, in accordance with
the conserved pattern across tetrapods reported in recent
studies [23,24]. There are also few temporal shifts in the
early period of embryonic development, that is, from the
occurrence of blastopore and neurulation up to early
somite cluster formation.

Some changes at the different nodes of the phylogenies
examined are potentially linked with functional or ecological aspects. One character that clearly distinguishes
Mammalia from Sauropsida is the temporal occurrence of
the lens/iris contour. In mammals it occurs late with
respect to the occurrence of several other events, in sauropsids earlier, perhaps coupled with the differing life
strategies of these two groups. Since mammals are generally protected by and associated to the mother in the
uterus or during the lactation period, they may not "need"
to develop their eye as early as reptiles do, because the latter generally have to find food and avoid predators shortly
after hatching. Other senses-related changes may also be
interpretable in this light. Temporal shifts that characterise Testudines + Sauria are mainly related to the early
occurrence of events of the eye, ear and nasal complex in
relation to limb-related characters. The primary cervical
flexure of 90° and its final disappearance is delayed
within Sauropsida. This is possibly related to an earlier
hatching/birth in mammals and their need for a muscular, neck-related suction. A late occurrence of the fourth
pharyngeal slit in Sauria in relation to the occurrence of
the third slit may be – compared to turtles as a sister group
– correlated to a shorter neck. When discussing neck
related characters also the count of cervical vertebrae and
the ossification mode should be kept in mind. The Sauria
are distinguished from the Testudines by an accelerated
occurrence of some somite clusters. This is potentially
coupled with the fact that whereas Testudines are characterised by a constant and low count of vertebrae [25],

heterochrony can be expressed in different ways (e.g.,
growth heterochrony [30]) and empirical studies are
needed to further study its phylogenetic signal and relevance in vertebrate evolution.
Several extinct groups, for which no molecular or embryological data are available, have been suggested as potential sister-groups of turtles [31,32]. We cannot test based
on our exclusively neontological data whether Testudines
evolved within one of the fossil "Anapsida"-clades or on
the stemline of Sauria within Diapsida [5]. Histological
studies of head development should help understanding
skull fenestration evolution and turtle origins. In this
regard, the mode of jaw development in the snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina was preliminary interpreted as consistent with a stem-position of turtles outside of Diapsida
[33].

Conclusion
The embryological data and their analysis presented here
are in agreement with a basal position of turtles instead of
one nested within a saurian clade. Whatever future comprehensive genomic studies reveal, it is clear that important homoplasies have characterised either the evolution
of adult morphological structures or the evolution of
developmental patterns of organogenesis, or both, in land
vertebrate evolution.
The elucidation of the developmental and molecular
mechanisms [34,35] and the discovery of potentially transitional forms in the fossil record [7,36] for the turtle
shell, in concern with solving the phylogenetic position of
turtles, promises to explain one of the major evolutionary
transitions in land vertebrate evolution.

There are few empirical studies of sequence heterochrony
with similar methods to those used here, so comparisons
with our study are only preliminary. Other studies of a
similar phylogenetic breadth [26,27] have found less heterochronies per node than reported here; studies at lower
taxonomic levels and on diverse character complexes have
found several heterochronic changes at different phylogenetic levels [20,28,29]. As claimed in recent comprehensive studies of skeletal development in mammals [20-22],

Analyses of sequence heterochrony
The key methodology for a comparative analysis of developmental sequence data is 'event-pairing' [37]. It consists
of the pair-wise comparison of events in a sequence, with
each pair being assigned a score. The method permits to
produce characters that can be analysed in the context of
phylogeny. A matrix is created in which the occurrence of
each element is related to every other one. Hence, each
event-pair can be treated as a character with three possible
character states reflecting the relative timing of one element relative to another: a. Event A occurs before event B
(event-pair coded as 0). b. Event A occurs at the same time
as event B (coded as 1). c. Event A occurs after event B
(coded as 2). Published phylogenies can be used to plot
the resulting characters. After this step the state at each
node of the phylogeny can be inferred and the ancestral
sequence reconstructed. Parsimov [19] is a method that is
based on the basic event-pairing. It determines the minimal solution that accounts for every event-pair change

and yields a consensus that contains all hypotheses of
movement that must necessarily form part of any equally
most parsimonious solution to the observed event-pair
changes [[19]: page 239].
Procedures implemented in the analysis
The procedures of the heterochrony analysis follow in
general Jeffery et al. [19] with extensions by Olaf BinindaEmonds (see below). Here the principal steps are summarised (find a detailed step-by-step-protocol in Table S5).
First, a table listing species (columns) against characters
(lines) was prepared. The stage-associated events were
recorded for each species (Table S3). Afterwards the stages
were temporally ranked for each species separately by the
following principle: characters "A", "E", "F" occur first
(rank 1), characters "B", "D", "G" occur second (rank 2),
character "C", H" occur third (rank 3), etc. (Table S4). An
event pair sequence for each species was generated (see
Additional file 2 and 3) using the perl-based EventpairSim.pl and afterwards one topology was drawn with Mesquite 2.01 [38]. In PAUP* 4.0b10 [39] the event pairs
were plotted over the unrooted topology by the principle
of parsimony, the tree length was documented and
ACCTRAN and DELTRAN character optimisations were
calculated (Table S6). The heterochrony analyses were
performed with the perl-based parimv7g.pl using Windows
XP Pro SP2 on a 2.4 GHz computer; each run took approximately 20 hours when all tree analyses were running in
parallel. The names of the events (Table S2) that were initially encoded as numbers for the analysis were retransformed to names at the end using ReplacerParsimv.pl [40].
The procedure was repeated for each of the tested proposed topologies separately (Table S6). For the preferred
topology (Figures 4 and S3) autapomorphic heterochronic shifts are listed using unordered character states
(Tables S8 and S9).

In addition to the Parsimov analyses and character mappings (Table S6 and S7) we did a phylogenetic reconstruction with PAUP* 4.0b10 (heuristic search) using event
pairs as character states. Both for ordered and unordered
characters no sensible cladogram results and turtles form
a paraphyletic group (Figure S4 and S5). These results
underline the worthlessness of the non independent event
pairs for phylogenetic reconstructions [22].
On the use of ordered vs. unordered characters
Whether to order characters or not in phylogenetic analyses is a controversial matter. In our analyses developmental ranks were encoded to produce event pairs comprising
only three characters states [[19], see Methods: Analyses of
sequence heterochrony]. We tested both the unordered
and the ordered approaches. Ordering characters introduces additional assumptions, such as that a change or
relative timing from 'late' to 'early' requires an intermedi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/82

ate step of simultaneity. But since developmental characters are of a continuous kind, ordering is a reasonable
assumption [29,41,42]. Hence, we also ran the analyses
with ordered characters to test the robusticity of our analyses (Table S7). The evidence for all supported topologies
is the same. The topology Testudines + Sauria, with
marine turtles basal within cryptodires, is the best supported. The second best supported hypothesis for the
position of turtles within Tetrapoda is that of Testudines +
Lepidosauria, followed by Testudines + Archosauria. In
sum, both analyses together strongly support the same
topology for the position of turtles and inner turtle phylogeny (Figures 3, 4 and S3).
Treatment of event simultaneity
The issue of how to treat events scored as simultaneous
has been discussed before [43-47]. Event simultaneity is
generally ascribed to a lack of resolution because it is considered unlikely that two events occur at exactly the same
time. However, perceptions of the impact of event simultaneity vary. Velhagen [43] cautioned against including
simultaneous events in event pair analysis, arguing that
these are nearly always artefactual. However, most eventpair analyses have included simultaneous event scores,
often with a word of caution [19,39,44,48,49]. We follow
Weisbecker et al. [22] in refraining from excluding characters that where coded as simultaneous, as we think that in
our data set changes from simultaneity suggests in most
cases real changes in timing and not lack of resolution.
The alternative of treating simultaneous data as missing
involves loss of information and introduces error and
potentially spurious reconstructions of developmental
change in phylogeny. For the sake of completeness we ran
Parsimov for all topologies excluding the tie shifts (from
0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 1, 1 to 0) and replaced all "1s" for "?"
in the event pair matrix. We counted the consensus shifts
for the branch leading to Testudines + sistergroup in each
topology (Table S6 and S7) and listed the shifts overlapping in the ties-included and ties-excluded analyses
(Tables S6 and S8).
Taxonomic sampling
As an outgroup to all observed amniotes we have chosen
the axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, based on detailed and
comparative description of its developmental stages
[50,51]. We refrained from taking a more basal lissamphibian species out of Gymnophiona [11] because members of this clade are morphologically highly derived [52],
as shown by in the reduction of limbs. Comparative staging tables of Anura are published only for species characterised by several highly derived characters [53,54] and
the development of their legs is switched around in comparison to the plesiomorphic vertebrate pattern [23]. Caudata show the plesiomorphic pattern of an early forelimb
contra a late hind limb development. But compared to

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:82

other caudates like Necturus [55] or Andrias [56] the axolotl obviously exhibits a delayed development of limbs
during maturation [51]. When discussing the development of the limbs within Amniota this should be kept in
mind.
Phylogenetic breadth in the sampling of published information was chosen based on the extent of existing
descriptions and the quality of illustrations (Table S1).
For the echidna, Tachyglossus aculeatus, the staging system
of Semon [57] was used. To expand this information, we
examined 21 embryo photographs and drawings of this
species (Hubrecht collection, Berlin [58]) and ordered
them chronologically by the number of somites (Table
S3).
All taxa analysed are listed in Table S1. Each major tetrapod clade is represented by one species, except for Cryptodira, represented by 14 species (Figures 4 and S3). With
this in mind we should be careful not to overinterpret
character changes [29]. For example, our preliminary and
cautious interpretation on the evolution of the neck
length in Testudines vs. Sauria could be refuted by including pleurodire turtles with shorter necks (Pelomedusidae)
or birds with elongated necks (Struthioniformes). Our
examination of the embryology of sensory characters
could be extended by including mammal and bird species
of nidicolous as well as nidifugous behaviour. Also the
ground pattern of neck length and flight behaviour in
these groups should be addressed. When including taxa of
different body shape the results could still remain similar
to ours and the functional explanations should be
rethought.
Remarks on characters excluded from the heterochrony
analysis
Examples of excluded characters are the shape and development of pigmentation, detailed carapace or scale differentiations – all characters important for staging
prehatching embryos of a particular species. Although pigmentation and colouration are mentioned in most staging
tables, some authors refer to first occurrence of pigment
cells that are hard to see in photographs and in embryos
that have been fixed for a long time. Other authors call an
organ "pigmented" when the organ is completely "dark".
In most cases we were not able to interpret the drawings
and photographs as mentioned in the descriptions based
on their different quality and the subjective view and
approach of each author. We also refrained from listing
every single somite number because there is high variability in the formation of the mesodermal segments. The presented definition of clusters, five somites each, serves to
reflect the variance of somite development but is also an
example of subjectivity in character definition – an una-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/82

voidable limitation of any morphological study of this
kind.
In literature the forelimb development is usually better
documented, because in general a more or less simultaneous development of fore- and hind limb is observable as
we experienced when observing both limbs. When defining events for the limb development we either discuss
both limbs separately or only the forelimb was discussed.
If there had been an unrecorded "abnormal" temporal
shift between fore- and hind limb in one particular species, it would have only reflected a derived feature of this
species and would be useless for the approach of this
study.
Alternative hypotheses of cryptodire relationships
Whereas Gaffney and Meylan [59] and Shaffer et al. [60]
hypothesised a basal position of the snapping turtles
(Chelydridae) within Cryptodira (Figure 1a and S2a),
Joyce's [6] analysis resulted in a basal position of the sea
turtles (Chelonioidea) within living taxa (Figures 1b and
S2b). Other authors [61,62] hypothesised the Trionychoidea (Kinosternidae + Trionychia) to be paraphyletic and
placed Trionychia (soft-shelled turtles) basal to all
remaining cryptodires. Trionychia are represented in our
study (Figures 1c and S2c). The interrelationships of the
Testudinoidea (swamp turtles and tortoises) and Trionychia species that we included in our analysis are widely
accepted and follow Gaffney and Meylan [59]. Within
Chelonioidea, Dermochelys is generally considered to be
the sister group of all remaining marine turtle taxa [63];
given conflicts of morphological and molecular data [64],
we set Chelonioidea excl. Dermochelys as unresolved for all
analyses (Figures 4 and S3). Taxonomic names of turtles
follow Fritz & Havaš [65].
