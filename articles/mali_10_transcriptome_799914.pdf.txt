Abstract
Background: The phenomenon of desiccation tolerance, also called anhydrobiosis, involves the ability of an
organism to survive the loss of almost all cellular water without sustaining irreversible damage. Although there are
several physiological, morphological and ecological studies on tardigrades, only limited DNA sequence information
is available. Therefore, we explored the transcriptome in the active and anhydrobiotic state of the tardigrade
Milnesium tardigradum which has extraordinary tolerance to desiccation and freezing. In this study, we present the
first overview of the transcriptome of M. tardigradum and its response to desiccation and discuss potential parallels
to stress responses in other organisms.
Results: We sequenced a total of 9984 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from two cDNA libraries from the
eutardigrade M. tardigradum in its active and inactive, anhydrobiotic (tun) stage. Assembly of these ESTs resulted in
3283 putative unique transcripts, whereof ~50% showed significant sequence similarity to known genes. The
resulting unigenes were functionally annotated using the Gene Ontology (GO) vocabulary. A GO term enrichment
analysis revealed several GOs that were significantly underrepresented in the inactive stage. Furthermore we
compared the putative unigenes of M. tardigradum with ESTs from two other eutardigrade species that are
available from public sequence databases, namely Richtersius coronifer and Hypsibius dujardini. The processed
sequences of the three tardigrade species revealed similar functional content and the M. tardigradum dataset
contained additional sequences from tardigrades not present in the other two.
Conclusions: This study describes novel sequence data from the tardigrade M. tardigradum, which significantly
contributes to the available tardigrade sequence data and will help to establish this extraordinary tardigrade as a
model for studying anhydrobiosis. Functional comparison of active and anhydrobiotic tardigrades revealed a
differential distribution of Gene Ontology terms associated with chromatin structure and the translation machinery,
which are underrepresented in the inactive animals. These findings imply a widespread metabolic response of the
animals on dehydration. The collective tardigrade transcriptome data will serve as a reference for further studies
and support the identification and characterization of genes involved in the anhydrobiotic response.

Background
Desiccation tolerance or anhydrobiosis is the ability of
an organism to survive almost complete drying without
sustaining damage. Anhydrobiosis is observed in certain micro-organisms, plants and animals such as rotifers, brine shrimp cysts, tardigrades and insect larvae,

as for example those of the Polypedilum vanderplanki
[1-3]. Studying the mechanisms of tolerance against
desiccation may lead to development of new methods
for preserving biological materials, which is of enormous practical importance in industrial as well as in
medical fields [4]. In the dry state, the metabolism is
suspended and the duration that anhydrobiotic organisms can survive ranges from years to centuries. Tardigrades are able to survive long periods of desiccation
[5-8]. The hitherto longest known observation of an

extended lifespan of 20 years has been demonstrated in
the anhydrobiotic state of the species Echiniscus testudo Doyère 1840 [9]. Anhydrobiosis probably depends
on a series of complex morphological, physiological
and genetic adaptations that involve the stabilization of
macromolecular complexes. As a consequence, a number of components have been identified and appear to
be important for protecting these organisms from
desiccation damage. Among them are the highly
hydrophilic LEA proteins, which have been initially
described in plants but have been identified in several
invertebrates [10,11,2,12], as well as non-reducing disaccharides like trehalose [13-16]. We are studying
anhydrobiosis in the limno-terrestrial tardigrade Milnesium tardigradum Doyère 1840 which shows remarkable resistance to adverse environmental conditions in
all stages of life [17] - even to extreme levels of ionizing radiation [18] and the vacuum of space in low
earth orbit [19]. M. tardigradum outperforms several
other tardigrade species in tolerance e.g. survival of
extreme temperatures above 100°C [20] as well as
freezing [21,22]. Similar anhydrobiotic resistance to
extreme environmental stress has been observed in
other animals such as bdelloid rotifers or chironomid
larvae [23,24] suggesting common mechanisms that
allow anhydrobiotic survival and conferring radiation
tolerance. The tardigrade phylum currently includes
more than 1000 species living in the sea, in fresh water
and on land. These last, needing at least a film of
water to be active, are called limno-terrestrial and
include most of the anhydrobiotic species [25]. They
have been studied for their fascinating ability to perform anhydrobiosis and consequently serve as a potential model for studying tolerance and survival of
multicellular organisms to a variety of extreme environmental conditions. Although there are several physiological, morphological and ecological studies on
anhydrobiotic tardigrades [26-30], only limited DNA
sequence information from molecular phylogenetic studies is available [30-34]. However, some sequence
resources are only available from the species Hypsibius
dujardini Doyère 1840 [Daub et al. Unpublished data
2003] and Richtersius coronifer (Richters 1903) [35].
Studies of H. dujardini have been focused mainly on
developmental and evolutionary biology [36-38]. In
this study we generated 9984 ESTs of M. tardigradum
from active and inactive (anhydrobiotic/tun) stages,
thereby establishing M. tardigradum as a model for
anhydrobiosis research. These ESTs and the resulting
unigenes were functionally annotated using Gene
Ontology vocabulary. Furthermore, a cross-species
comparison between M. tardigradum, H. dujardini and
R. coronifer has been performed.

Results and discussion
cDNA libraries and sequence datasets

We have generated two directionally cloned cDNA
libraries from active and inactive stages of M. tardigradum and subjected them to single pass Sanger sequencing. Furthermore we retrieved two EST datasets from
public sequence databases (see Table 1 and 2). The
datasets used in this study consisted of EST sequences
from, M. tardigradum active and inactive stages, H.
dujardini [Daub et al. Unpublished data 2003] and R.
coronifer [35] of which the latter two were retrieved
from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) dbEST and the NCBI Trace Archive. The source
of all tardigrade samples consisted of whole adult animals except for the H. dujardini sample where adults
and juveniles had been pooled.
Analysis of the M. tardigradum cDNA library

As summarized in Table 1, a total of 9979 clones were
sequenced from the M. tardigradum library generated
from two stages, active and inactive, in order to obtain
various transcripts and to extract putative anhydrobiotic
candidate genes. Assembly of the ESTs allowed the
identification of 1997 and 1858 non-redundant
sequences for active and inactive stages, respectively.
The average unigene length was 579 nucleotides.
Homology search (BLASTX) using M. tardigradum unigenes against the NCBI database showed that nearly
50% of the ESTs had no corresponding entry in GenBank. All ESTs were deposited in GenBank (See accession numbers in the additional file 1). The three
available tardigade datasets were processed and compared (Table 2, Figure 1) in order to get an overview of
the similarity and redundancy between our library and
the other two EST resources.
GO enrichment analysis of M. tardigradum ESTs

To study the functional differences between active and
inactive stages of M. tardigradum, we performed a GO

enrichment analysis between the two datasets (Figure 2;
additional file 2). Studying functional differences give
insight into global mechanisms that are at work in the
desiccating animals. Comparing the datasets revealed
that 24 GO terms were significantly underrepresented in
the inactive stage. The underrepresented GO-terms
which were mapped to “nucleosome”, “nucleosome
assembly”, “chromatin assembly or disassembly” and
“chromatin assembly” (GO:0000786, GO:0006334,
GO:0006333, GO:0031497) consist exclusively of transcripts coding for histones. The cellular component
(CC) subset of differential terms is also solely associated
with structural components of the genome, such as
“nucleosome” (GO:0000786), “chromatin” (GO:0005694),
“chromosome” (GO:0000785), and “chromosomal part”
(GO:0044427). Finding only underrepresented terms is
consistent with the global metabolic arrest of animals

undergoing cryptobiosis. Histone mRNA expression is
tightly linked to DNA replication and regulated by the
cell cycle [39]. A study in Caenorhabditis elegans under
anoxia showed similar adaptations such as cell cycle
arrest, dephosphorylation of the histone H3 and morphological changes in the chromatin distribution [40]. A
metabolic suppression could limit cellular and genomic
damage by reducing the energy turnover to a minimum
making the organism less susceptible to stress and
therefore ensuring cell survival e.g. by decreased production of free radicals. Also GO-terms involved in translation regulation seem to be affected e.g. “regulation of
translation” (GO:0006417), “translation regulator activity” (GO:0045182) and “translation factor activity,
nucleic acid binding” (GO:0008135), implying modulation of translational activity as a response to desiccation.
The most abundant ESTs in active and inactive libraries of
M. tardigradum

The total EST count obtained by comparing the active
against the inactive dataset of M. tardigradum is summarized in the Table 3. The relative abundance of some
transcripts in the inactive stage may indicate that they
have been transcribed during the desiccation process or
have been stored to be translated on rehydration. Biologically, high survival rates in M. tardigradum are
accomplished only when drying slowly at high relative

humidity [16,41], suggesting that anhydrobiotic tardigrades like rotifers [42], need time to activate certain
mechanisms for optimal anhydrobiosis. Probably this is
because the transcription of RNAs coding for protection
components has to take place. Among the genes that
have a higher relative representation in the inactive
stage are as follows:
Lipid-related transcripts

Lipid-related transcripts are represented mainly by
intracellular fatty acid binding protein (FABP). FABPs
have a low molecular mass and bind with high affinity
to hydrophobic ligands such as saturated and

unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. Various functions
have been proposed for FABPs such as the uptake,
transport, and delivery of fatty acids to beta-oxidation
[43,44]. FABPs are also thought to be active fatty acid
chaperones by protecting and shuttling fatty acids
within the cell [45,46]. However the biological role and
mechanisms of action of FABPs remain poorly understood. The transcript level of FABP was identified by
cDNA array and Northern blot analysis as being upregulated during hibernation of ground squirrels
[43,47]. Members of the FABPs family have recently
been identified and reported to increase in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus plicatilis during dormancy

degradation could be possible as this can occur at

[48]. The presence of FAPB in inactive stage of M. tardigradum may imply conserved mechanisms shared
between rotifer dormancy and anhydrobiosis in tardigrades and presumably other organisms as well. FAPB
may protect membranes and ensure fatty acids as
energy saving storage during anhydrobiosis.
Protease inhibitors

To date, little is known about the possible mechanisms
of proteolytic inhibition or suppression in anhydrobiotic
organisms. Protease inhibitors are candidate genes
which would offer protection against protein degradation during anhydrobiosis. Among the abundant protease inhibitors transcripts in inactive stages of M.
tardigradum are Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor
and Cystatin B. Overexpression of Cystatin B (an intracellular cysteine proteinase inhibitor) in transgenic yeast
and Arabidopsis showed an increase in the resistance to
high salt, drought, oxidative, and cold stresses [49]. Elevated levels of transcripts coding for protease inhibitors
such as Cystatin B have also been found in brine shrimp
cysts [50]. The abundance of protease inhibitors may
inhibit proteolytic reactions of proteases that could
damage tissues during the desiccation process or as a
response to induction of proteases as a result of

Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I

Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI) is a mitochondrial gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, a crucial enzyme involved in oxidative
phosphorylation and thus energy production. COXI was
over threefold more represented in the inactive state.
Transcripts encoding COXI were also abundantly
expressed during dehydration stress in the antarctic
nematode Plectus murrayi [51] and up regulated by
temperature increase in the yeast-like fungus Cryptococcus neoformans [52]. The mitochondrial COXI upregulation may serve to prevent the damage to the electron
transport chain caused by desiccation and to keep an
increased energy production for the survival of the
tardigrades.
The sequences, which could not be assigned any function based on homology search in NCBI, were searched
for conserved domains in ProDom [53] and Swiss-Prot
databases [54] but did not show any hits. Since these
are not all full-length sequences, it is possible that they
may have missed characteristic motifs or domains for
classification. A detailed investigation of their function
as well as other identified transcripts presented in Table
3 will be a task in the future.
Transcripts with putative functions in desiccation
resistance identified in all three tardigrade species
datasets

In a cross-search over the four tardigrade EST resources
(active and inactive libraries of M. tardigradum, R. coronifer and H. dujardini), transcripts which are potentially
associated with desiccation tolerance during anhydrobiosis in other organisms were identified (see additional
files 3, 4 and 5).
Detoxification-related genes

Oxidative stress proteins have been shown to be an
important component in many biological processes [55].
They mediate detoxification and have putative roles as
antioxidants such as glutathione S-transferase (GST),
thioredoxin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione
peroxidases and peroxiredoxin. It was shown that overexpression of GST/glutathione peroxidase increased the
resistance to oxidative and water stress in transgenic
tobacco plants [56]. GSTs are a diverse superfamily of
multifunctional proteins that are reported to play a prominent role in the detoxification metabolism in nematodes [57]. In particular the up-regulation of detoxifying
enzymes GST and SOD in Plectus murrayi [51] suggests

Mali et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:168
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/168

an efficient role of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
scavenging mechanisms under desiccation stress. These
observations led us to postulate that the tardigrade GST
and SOD are likely to deal with oxidatively damaged cellular components during desiccation. These enzymes
that help in the removal of these compounds contribute
to cellular survival after oxidative damage.
Aquaporins

Many organisms adapt to desiccation stress by the activation of various water-channel proteins, called aquaporins (AQP) [58,59]. Data from Polypedilum
vanderplanki indicates that of the two aquaporins isolated from this organism, one is involved in anhydrobiosis, whereas the other controls water homeostasis of the
fat body during normal conditions [60]. Similarly, the
aquaporins in larvae of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta
solidaginis were either upregulated (AQP3) or downregulated (AQP2 and AQP4) following desiccation [61].
The upregulated AQP3 is especially intriguing because
it is permeable to water and glycerol across the cell
membrane as larvae prepare for the osmotic stress associated with desiccation. In our study aquaporin transcripts have been identified in all tardigrade datasets.
These AQPs may act in concert with other transmembrane proteins to mediate the rapid transport of water
across the plasma membrane during anhydrobiosis
when its diffusion through the phospholipid layer of the
membrane is limited.
Molecular chaperones

In the four tardigrade datasets we have identified some
putative heat shock protein (HSP) encoding genes. HSPs
are highly conserved throughout evolution and they
function as molecular chaperones and play primary
roles in protein biosynthesis and folding [62]. In tardigrades, there is considerable debate concerning the role
of HSPs under desiccation stress. In the R. coronifer, a
lower level of Hsp70 protein was found in desiccated
animals when compared with active ones [63]. In M.
tardigradum, one isoform of the hsp70 tarnscripts
showed up-regulation during the transition from active
to the inactive state [64,65], while the other hsp70 isoforms are downregulated and seem not to be directly
involved in anhydrobiosis. Using the same model M.
tardigradum, Reuner et al. [65] found an upregualtion
of hsp90 in the inactive state. Certainly Hsp70 isoforms
and hsp90 are involved in tardigrade desiccation, but
further studies are necessary to understand how these
proteins work to protect anhydrobiotic organisms.
Much attention was recently paid on the chaperonelike LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins in
anhydrobiotic animals [66,67]. LEA proteins are mainly
low molecular weight (10-30 kDa) proteins associated

Page 6 of 11

with tolerance to water stress resulting from desiccation
and cold shock [68,69]. Genes encoding LEA-like proteins have been identified in the nematode Aphelenchus
avenae under dehydration condition [70-72]. A similar
gene was identified and upregulated in the larvae of P.
vanderplanki by water stress imposed by either desiccation or hypersalinity [73]. Recently, LEA have also been
identified and shown to be induced under dehydration
in the springtail Megaphorura arctica [74]. In the tardigrade EST libraries, LEA transcripts have been found in
the H. dujardini library (the less tolerant tardigrade)
and also in the proteome map of M. tardigardum [75].
These data suggest that LEA-like proteins could be
widespread in anhydrobiotic organisms and serve important functions during desiccation.
The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP)
found in all tardigrada datasets is often designated as a
stress-related protein because of its highly regulated
expression in stress conditions and its close relation to a
family of small chaperone proteins [76]. Importantly,
TCTP can bind to native proteins and protect them
from thermal denaturation [77].
Trehalose synthesis-related gene

Trehalose, which accumulates in many anhydrobiotic
organisms during desiccation is proposed to act as a
common water replacement molecules and stabilizer of
biological structures [78-80]. The accumulation of trehalose has been reported in the cysts of the crustacean
Artemia franciscana [81], in the nematode Aphelenchus
avenae [82] and in the insect larvae of the P. vanderplanki [83]. However, anhydrobiotic Bdelloid rotifers are
unable to produce trehalose [41,84]. In addition, the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase genes (tps) have not been
found in rotifer genomes [41]. Although trehalose accumulates substantially in the eutardigrade Adorybiotus
coronifer [85], it was surprisingly immeasurable in M.
tardigardum [16] and we could not find transcripts of
tps in M. tardigradum ESTs. Nevertheless, transcripts
coding for trehalases have been described in M. tardigradum [86] but we propose that its function is probably limited to the catabolism of trehalose taken up
from food sources. The hypothesis of trehalose as a protective agent during desiccation may not be applicable
to all anhydrobiotic organisms and in M. tardigradum
other strategies are probably employed.
Comparative ESTs analysis between the three tardigrade
species

The datasets analysed in this study represent most of
the available transcriptome data from tardigrades, and
until now there is little information on tardigrade genome and transcriptome structure. The genome sizes
range from very compact genomes, ~75 Mb for H.

Mali et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:168

dujardini, considered as one of the smallest tardigrade
genomes [36], up to 800 Mb for other species
http://www.genomesize.com. Our dataset adds a substantial part towards the complete gene content in the
tardigrada species.
To investigate the complementation of the three tardigrade datasets (M. tardigradum, H. dujardini and R. coronifer) we searched for putative orthologous sequences
across all three datasets. Using a TBLASTX search with
an e-value threshold of 10-5 we compared the M. tardigradum unigenes against the other two datasets. The
BLAST bit-score of each top-scoring hit was extracted
and M. tardigradum sequences that exhibited sequence
similarity against at least one other tardigrade species
are presented as a clustered heatmap in Figure 1 (see
also additional file 6). M. tardigradum unigenes show
similarities against both other species with some hits
only present in either one of them (N = 785). A higher
coverage of M. tardigradum transcripts can be seen in
the H. dujardini dataset compared to R. coronifer which
is likely due to the smaller R. coronifer dataset. This
cross species comparison implies that the remaining
2498 unigenes contained in the M. tardigradum dataset
represent further yet unknown tardigrade transcripts
and expands the known tardigrade sequence data. These
might be very interesting for studying the evolutionary
relationships of protein families.
To calculate the average relative transcriptome
sequence similarity between M. tardigradum and the
other two tardigrade species we included only sequences
that were common to all three tardigrade species (N =
368). These contained mainly abundant transcripts e.g.
ribosomal proteins, ADP-ribosylation factor, ubiquitin,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and heat
shock proteins. The resulting average transcript similarity for M. tardigradum against H. dujardini was 147.66
+/- 88.27 and M. tardigradum against R. coronifer
150.95 +/- 93.74. This is reflected in the phylogenetic
distance calculated using 18S rRNA sequences (see additional file 7), which positions R. coronifer closer to M.
tardigradum.

Conclusions
This study describes novel sequence data from the tardigrade M. tardigradum that identified a set of 3283 unigenes, which significantly contributes to the available
tardigrade sequence data and will help to establish this
tardigrade as a model for studying desiccation tolerance.
The comparison of active and inactive stage EST
libraries by performing an exploratory GO enrichment
analysis suggests a metabolic suppression in terms of
replication and translation during desiccation. The tardigrade-EST resource generated from this study will serve
as a reference for future global gene expression

experiments, aiming at the identification of key regulators of desiccation resistance during anhydrobosis.
Furthermore the datasets of H. dujardini and R. coronifer will serve as additional resources that could give
clues about the evolutionary conservation of these regulators between tardigrade species of different anhydrobiotic capabilities.

Methods
Animal culture and sampling

M. tardigradum was reared in a laboratory culture on
3% agar plates covered with Volvic® mineral water at 20
± 2°C and a light/dark cycle of 12 h as previously published [8]. For all experiments, adult animals (eight
weeks after hatching) in good condition were collected
directly from the agar plate using a pipette and a stereomicroscope. Tardigrades were starved for 3 days, and
washed for several times with Volvic® mineral water
before being processed to avoid contaminations. A total
of 1000 animals were collected into 1.5 ml Eppendorf
tubes in aliquots of 200 animals each. Animals representing the active state were frozen directly in liquid
nitrogen. Anhydrobiotic stages of M. tardigradum were
generated by a previously published protocol [8]. Briefly,
M. tardigradum (200 animals) were placed in 1.5 ml
Eppendorf tube and desiccated at room-temperature at
85% relative humidity (RH) for 12 to 16 hours (till they
have completed the tun formation) and then at 35% RH
for further 48 hours. The animals were frozen at -80°C
until their experimental use.
Library construction

Total RNA extraction was performed by following the
instructions of QIAGEN RNeasy R Mini kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Complete lysis of the tardigrades and
especially disruption of their harsh cuticle was achieved
by sonication on ice for 1 min (duty cycle 0.5s) by using
a microsonicator (Probe 73, Sonopuls; Bandelin). For
cDNA synthesis 1 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed
using the Creator™ SMART™ cDNA Library Construction Kit following the manufacturers recommendations
(Clontech-TaKaRa Bio Europe, France). The resulting
first strand cDNA was amplified by LD-PCR for 18
cycles according to the manufacturers protocol using
the 5’ PCR primer (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3’) as the forward and the CDSIII/3’PCR Primer
(5’-ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGACATG-d(T)
30N-1N-3’) as reverse primer. The amplified PCR products were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
After digestion of the amplified cDNA with the SfiI
restriction enzyme, products smaller than 300 bp were
removed using the Chroma Spin-400 column as
described in the Creator SMART™ protocol and cloned
into pDNR-Lib cloning vector. This procedure was

chosen because of the low amount of starting material.
Plasmids were transferred via electroporation to Escherichia coli (strain DH10B, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany).
cDNA sequencing

In total, 9984 cDNA clones were either picked by hand
or automatically using a QPix robot (Genetix, UK) into
384 well LB-agar culture plates containing chloramphenicol. Sequencing was mostly from the 5’ end using
standard M13 forward sequencing primer. The sequencing of the cDNA library was sequenced on a ABI
3730XL capillary sequencer by GATC Biotech AG (Konstanz, Germany).
Sequence analysis and annotation

The EST analysis pipeline (Figure 3) includes typically,
EST pre-processing, EST assembly and annotation of
the resulting unigenes. The result is the generation of a
clean, high-quality EST sequence set. Both chromatogram (M. tardigradum) and FASTA sequences (H.
dujardini and R. coronifer) files are accepted as entry
point to the analysis. Base calling was performed with
phred [87,88] using a score threshold of 20. Low quality
sequences, cloning vector, poly A or T tails, adaptors,
and short sequences (<100 base pairs) are removed from
the sequences with SeqClean [89]. Repetitive elements
are masked with RepeatMasker [90]. Sequences that can
be considered contaminants and unexpected vector
sequences are also removed with SeqClean, using
NCBI’s UniVec database (v5.1) [91].
TIGR Gene Indices clustering tools (TGICL) with
standard parameters [92] and CAP3 [93] have been used
for the assembly step. For functional annotation, processed putative unique transcripts were loaded into the
Blast2GO software [94]. Blasting was done with
BLASTX algorithm using Blast2GO (v2.3.5) standard
parameters. Unigenes were annotated with GO terms
using standard evidence GO weight parameters. The
‘Augment Annotation by ANNEX’ function was used to
refine annotations. Subsequently, Inter-ProScan [95] was
performed to find conserved functional domains. GO
terms derived from domains were merged into the existing GO annotation of the respective unigenes.
GO enrichment analysis

was performed using the GOSSIP statistical framework
[96] webservice via the BLAST2GO software. GOSSIP
employs 2 × 2 contingency tables of annotation frequencies for each GO term and computes p-values using
Fisher’s exact test. The statistical framework accounts
for false positives (type-I-errors) that arise from multiple
testing by calculating adjusted p-values. We screened for
significantly enriched GO-terms by controlling the false
discovery rate (FDR), setting a cut-off threshold of
pFDR(p) ≤ 0.05. GO terms fulfilling this criterion were
considered differentially enriched between the two M.
tardigradum datasets.
