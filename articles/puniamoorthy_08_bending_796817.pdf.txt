Abstract
Background: Sexually dimorphic structures contribute the largest number of morphological differences
between closely related insect species thus implying that these structures evolve fast and are involved in
speciation. The current literature focuses on the selective forces that drive these changes, be it 'sexual conflict'
or 'female choice'. However, there are only few studies examining the function of sexual dimorphisms and even
fewer that investigate how functional changes influence dimorphisms. This is largely due to the paucity of taxa for
which the morphology, behavior, and phylogenetic relationships for multiple species are known. Here we present
such data for sepsid flies. Sepsids have starkly dimorphic forelegs whose function can be documented under
laboratory conditions. We use data from 10 genes to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships for 33 species
and test whether mounting positions are correlated with the presence and absence of sexual dimorphisms in the
forelegs.
Results: The phylogenetic tree fully resolves the relationship with 29 of the 31 nodes of the tree having a
posterior probability of 1.0. Twenty-eight of the 31 sepsid species have sexually dimorphic forelegs. All 28 species
with such forelegs have the same mounting technique whereby the male uses his modified forelegs to grasp the
female wingbase. Mapping mounting behavior and foreleg morphology onto the tree reveals that the wing grasp
evolved once and was reduced twice. All changes in the mounting behavior are strictly and statistically significantly
correlated with the origin and losses of sexually dimorphic legs (concentrated changes test: P < 0.001); i.e., the
two species that have independently lost the wing grasp have both also re-evolved monomorphic legs. The wing
grasp in these species is replaced with a novel but very similar mounting technique not involving the forelegs: the
males bend their abdomens forward and directly establish genital contact to the female. In addition, one of the
secondarily monomorphic species, Sepsis secunda, has evolved a new sexual dimorphism, a 'bump' on the dorsal
side of the 4th tergite, which is now touching the ventral side of the female abdomen.
Conclusion: Our study reveals that the evolution of sexually dimorphic legs in Sepsidae can only be understood
once the function of the legs during mating is considered and the relationships of species with and without sexual
dimorphisms are known. We demonstrate that homoplasy in sexually dimorphic structures can be due to
homoplasy in mating behavior. We furthermore document that the two species with secondarily monomorphic
legs have independently replaced the typical sepsid wing grasp with very similar, new mounting techniques. This
suggests that convergent evolution may be common in mating behaviors.

Background
Most closely related species of insects differ exclusively or
predominantly with regard to sexually dimorphic traits
[1,2]. This observation implies that these traits evolve fast
and are likely to be involved in speciation. Understanding
the evolution of sexual dimorphisms is thus crucial for
understanding the impressive species diversity of the
Insecta, the most speciose clade of multicellular animals
[3]. This has made the study of sexual dimorphisms also
one of the most important goals of modern evolutionary
biology.
Much of the literature focuses on the theoretical issues
that drive the sexual selection that is responsible for the
origin and maintenance of sexual dimorphisms. Traditionally, the fast evolution of male ornaments had been
attributed to selection via female choice [4]. Some empirical data and genetic models had shown that this choice
could be driven by direct benefits that increase survivorship [5,6] or indirect genetic benefits that could improve
viability and/or the attractiveness of the offspring [7-12].
However, there is an alternative explanation for the fast
evolution of sexual dimorphisms. The unequal investments in gametes by males and females leads to a conflict
of interest between the sexes ("sexual conflict" [13,14]).
Males have a higher interest in multiple matings than
females and may thus try to coerce females into being
polygamous. As a result both sexes can become involved
in a sexually antagonistic arms race and evolve mechanisms to gain control over reproduction, regardless of the
costs to the other sex [15,16]. Evidence for such morphological coevolution between male and female reproductive characters has been found across a number of insect
groups like Coleoptera (e.g.: Bruchidae and Dytiscidae),
Hemiptera (e.g.: Gerridae) and Diptera (e.g.: Empididae
and Scathophagidae) [17-25].
However, comparatively little is known about the function of many sexually dimorphic structures and even less
is known about how the function of these structures
changes over evolutionary time. One reason for this gap in
our knowledge is that studying the evolution of function
requires concurrent information on the morphology,
behavior and phylogeny of multiple species. Only then
can functional changes be mapped onto a phylogenetic
hypothesis. Unfortunately, for many sexually dimorphic
features, only the morphology has been documented in
detail and it is often unclear how they are being used. This
is particularly so for male genitalia whose function is difficult to study because they interact with internal elements
of the female reproductive tract [26,27]. Even if the function for a particular structure has been studied in great
detail, information is usually only available for one or a
few species [28] and if there is information for several species, the phylogenetic relationships are frequently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/155

unknown. As a consequence there are only few studies
that have documented the evolution of the function of
sexually dimorphic structures [18,29-33]. Here, we use a
wealth of information on the morphology and function
of the male forelegs for 31 species of Sepsidae (Diptera:
Cyclorrhapha) to document how sexual dimorphisms are
correlated with mating behavior over evolutionary time.
Over the past 30 years, sepsid flies have become model
organisms in the study of behavior in general and sexual
selection in particular [34-43]. Sepsids are ideal models
because some of the structures involved in the interactions between males and females are easily accessible and
display stark sexual dimorphism [44,45]. Furthermore,
sepsids can be maintained in the laboratory and some
aspects of their mounting and copulation behavior can be
video-taped and studied without dissection. The most
interesting sexually dimorphic structure that is easily
accessible is the forelegs. In most sepsid species, the males
use their forelegs for grasping the female wing base prior
to copulation. The forelegs are often strongly sexually
dimorphic, with female legs being unmodified while the
male legs display a wide variety and species-specific cuticular outgrowths, indentations, and/or modified bristles
(see Figures 1 and 2). The males of most sepsid species
will indiscriminately jump on females and attempt to
clamp to the female's wing base. It is here that the morphological modifications of the male forelegs play a
major role. They tightly mesh with the wing veins and
cells of the female wing [44,45] and help the male during
the next stage of mating, a rodeo-like struggle that is
found in most species and that starts after the male has
mounted the female [34,46-48]. The females of many sepsid species use vigorous shaking in order to dislodge and/
or test the stamina of the male [40,43,49,50]. In addition,
females usually bend their abdomen ventrally so that the
males cannot establish genitalic contact without female
consent [34,42]. Copulation can only be initiated once
the female lifts the tip of her abdomen, which may or may
not occur in response to male behaviors [38,51,52]. Many
copulation attempts by males are ultimately aborted
either because the males voluntarily dismount or because
males are dislodged through shaking [38].
Sexually dimorphic forelegs are found in the vast majority
of sepsid species. However, monomorphic legs are known
for six species: Orygma luctuosum Meigen 1830, three species of Perochaeta Duda 1926, Sepsis duplicata Haliday
1838, and S. secunda (Melander et Spuler 1917). Here, we
document the foreleg morphology and mounting behavior for two outgroup species, 3 species of Sepsidae with
monomorphic legs and 28 species of Sepsidae with sexually dimorphic legs. We reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among all species based on sequence data for 10
genes, map foreleg morphology and mounting behavior

onto the phylogenetic tree, and use a concentrated change
test [53] to establish whether the gains and losses of
dimorphic forelegs are correlated with changes in how the
forelegs are used during mounting.

Methods
Morphology
The forelegs of ethanol-preserved males and females for
the 33 species were removed from the thorax and both the
anterior and posterior views of the femur, tibia and trochanter were documented at 200Ã and 400Ã magnification using a Hirox microscope and the software DigiScale. Drawings of the anterior view of the male femur
and trochanter were prepared based on these digital
images and comparisons with additional specimens of the
same species. The morphology of the male foreleg was
then compared to the morphology of the female foreleg.
Legs were regarded as sexually monomorphic when male
and female forelegs could not be differentiated from each
other upon removal from the thorax. For certain select
species, a Jeol JSM-7220A Scanning Electron Microscope
was used to document additional dimorphic structures.
Rearing and Mating experiments
Laboratory cultures were established for 30 sepsid species
based on females collected in the field. The parental cultures were maintained under controlled conditions in
incubators and supplied regularly with dung and sugar
water. Mating experiments involved virgin flies that were
obtained by sexing newly emerged flies within 24 hours of
eclosion, keeping males and females as virgins in separate
containers. Mating trials were carried out approximately
four days after separation. A male and a female were introduced into a small Petri dish and their interaction was

recorded using a Leica MZ16A Microscope camera and a
VCR. The recording started upon the introduction of both
flies into the Petri dish and ended after a successful copulation or after 25 minutes if the males did not attempt to
mount. The analog recordings were digitized using the
non-linear editing software, Final Cut Pro, and studied
frame by frame (1 frame = 1/25 seconds) in order to document the mounting behavior of the different species in
detail. The number of recordings per species is listed in the
results section. Information on the mating behavior of
Saltella sphondylii was obtained from an earlier study by
Martin and Hosken [54].
Phylogenetic Relationships
We reconstructed the relationships among the 33 species
based on 10 genes (18S, 28S, AATS, EF1a, Histone 3, 12S,
16S, COI, COII, CYB; for details see [55]; for Genbank
accession numbers [see Additional file 1]). The data set
was subjected to a Bayesian analysis as implemented in
MrBayes 3.1 [56]. We used MrModeltest [57] to establish
that the GTR + I + G model was favored for all genes by
both the Akaike information criterion and hierarchical
likelihood ratio testing. The data set was analyzed for
3,000,000 generations and a tree was sampled every 300
generations (=10,000 trees) with a subsequent burn-in of
2500 trees.
Character mapping and concentrated change test
Sexual dimorphism (SD) was scored as a presence/
absence character (sexually dimorphic legs absent = 0;
present = 1). With regard to the mounting behavior (MB),
we used the role of the forelegs to define two character
states. State 0 was used to code those species where the
male foreleg is not used to grasp the female wing base.

Presence of the grasp was coded as character state 1. To test
whether changes in behavior and morphology are correlated, we mapped both binary characters onto the phylogenetic tree and used the concentrated change test [53] as
implemented in MacClade 4 [58] using the Sepsidae node
as the target clade.

Results
Morphology
Out of the 31 sepsid species included in this study, the following 28 have sexually dimorphic forelegs. The number
of mating trials with successful mountings is listed after
the species names: Australosepsis frontalis (Walker, 1860),
n = 15; A. niveipennis (Becker, 1903), n = 17; Decachaetophora aeneipes (de Meijere, 1913), n = 10; Dicranosepsis
emiliae (Ozerov, 1992), n = 13; D. hamata (de Meijere,
1911), n = 9; Meroplius fukuharai (Iwasa, 1984), n = 5;
Nemopoda nitidula (Fallen, 1820), n = 8; Parapaleosepsis plebeia Duda, 1926, n = 15; Saltella sphondylii (Schrank,
1803), Sepsis biflexuosa Strobl, 1893, n = 3; S. cynipsea (Linnaeus, 1758), n = 20;S. dissimilis Brunetti, 1910, n = 20; S.

(Fabricius, 1794), n = 10; Themira annulipes (Meigen,
1826), n = 4; T. biloba Andersson, 1975, n = 3; T. flavicoxa
Melander et Spuler, 1917, n = 10;T. leachi (Meigen, 1826),
n = 3;T. lucida (Staeger, 1844), n = 15;T. minor (Haliday,
1833), n = 15;T. putris (Linnaeus, 1758) n = 15; and T.
superba (Haliday, 1833) n = 20. The forelegs of N. nitidula
may at first sight appear almost monomorphic, but this is
due to the fact that the dimorphic elements are very small.
They are thus here documented in a separate micrograph
[see Additional file 2]. The three species with sexually
monomorphic forelegs in our study were Orygma luctuosum, n = 14, Perochaeta dikowi Ang et al., 2008, n = 20 and
Sepsis secunda, n = 8. The two outgroups, Gluma nitida
McAlpine, 1991 and Willistoniella pleuropunctata (Wiedemann, 1824) also have monomorphic forelegs (see Figure
2).
Mounting behavior
The mounting behavior was documented for all of the
above mentioned sepsid species except Saltella sphondylii
for which the behavior has been described in the literature
[54]. All 28 species with sexually dimorphic legs exhibit
the "typical" sepsid mount where the male jumps/climbs
onto the female and uses his modified forelegs to clasp
onto the base of her wing (see Figure 3a). Video clips documenting the mounting behavior are provided as additional files [see Additional files 3, 4 and 5] (or visit the
following websites [59-61]). However, the three species
that have monomorphic forelegs have mounting tech-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/155

niques not involving the male foreleg. The males of
Orygma luctuosum jump on the female and wrap their fore
and mid legs around the female thorax [see Additional file
6] (or visit the following website [62]). This is followed by
a brief struggle whereby the female either attempts to
shake off the male, often using her legs to 'kick' him, or by
rolling over in order to dislodge the male. In successful
mating trials, upon establishing genital contact, the male
rests his forelegs on the female's postpronotal callus and
not around the wing base.
The mounting behaviors of the two other species with
monomorphic legs, Sepsis secunda and Perochaeta
dikowi, are very similar to each other but differ considerably from the behavior of O. luctuosum. In P. dikowi (see
Figure 3b) and S. secunda (see Figure 3c) males approach
the females from behind and bend their abdomen ventroanteriad in order to directly establish genital contact without the use of the male forelegs. Once genital contact has
been established, copulation starts. The only difference
between the two species is that in P. dikowi, the males initially extend their surstylus beyond the female genitalia
and touch the ventral side of the female abdomen near
sternite three. The surstylus then slides posterior before
establishing genital contact [see Additional file 7] (or visit
the following website [63]). During copulation the male
forelegs rest on the females' postpronotal callus (for a
detailed description of mating behavior see [64]). In S.
secunda the males will first establish genital contact and
then place their forelegs loosely and mid-way along the
anterior edge of the female wing [see Additional file 8] (or
visit the following website [65]).
Phylogeny and character evolution
The dataset was subjected to a Bayesian analysis and three
independent analyses resulted in similar tree topologies,
comparable clade probabilities and substitution model
parameters. This suggested that consistent estimates of the
posterior probability (PP) distributions had been
obtained. Our analysis yielded a very well resolved tree
placing Orygma luctuosum as sister group to all the remaining sepsids. All but two nodes had PP values of 1.00 (see
Figure 2). The dimorphism and behavior characters were
mapped onto the phylogenetic hypothesis. The presence
of a sexually dimorphic foreleg is strictly correlated with a
mating position involving the wing grasp (concentrated
changes test using all of Sepsidae as target clade: two
losses in SD with two losses in MB, P = 0.000742). All
three changes in the sexual dimorphism character occur
on the same branches as the changes in mounting behavior (see Figure 2).

Discussion
Mounting behavior in Sepsidae is strictly and statistically
significantly correlated with the origin and losses of sexual

dimorphisms. The "typical" mounting position of Sepsidae involving the wing grasp only evolved once and
within the family (see Figure 2; red hatchmark) and the
origin of this mounting position coincides with the origin
of sexually dimorphic forelegs (see Figure 2; green hatchmark). The males of the three sepsid species with monomorphic forelegs, Orygma luctuosum, Perochaeta dikowi,
and Sepsis secunda place the forelegs on different parts of
the female body. Given its placement on the tree, the
mounting behavior and lack of sexual dimorphism is plesiomorphic in O. luctuosum. In fact, not only do the forelegs of O. luctuosum closely resemble the legs of the
outgroups (see Figure 2) but the mounting behavior is
also very similar to the behaviors of the outgroups Gluma
nitida [66] and Willistoniella pleuropunctata (see Figure 4).
For instance, male coelopids have been observed to
mount females and wrap their legs around the female thorax and as observed in O. luctuosum, the females will 'kick'
the males with their midlegs and even roll over [67,68].
Other acalyptrate flies like Protopiophila litigata (Diptera:
Piophilidae) and Dryomyza anilis (Diptera: Dryomyzidae)
also exhibit similar mounting behaviors. For example,
upon mounting, P. litigata males rest their fore tarsi on the

female postpronotum [69] while in D. anilis, the male
forelegs are placed on the female head [70].
However, the monomorphic legs of Perochaeta dikowi and
Sepsis secunda are due to the convergent loss of the male
leg armature in two distantly related clades of Sepsidae. A
study of the mating behavior reveals that in both species,
the forelegs are no longer used for grasping the female
wingbase. One can imagine many different ways of replacing the typical sepsid mounting position with a new
mounting technique. Yet, P. dikowi and S. secunda have
convergently invented near identical, new behaviors. In
both species, the male approaches the female from
behind. In both species, the males curl their abdomens
forward in order to touch the female abdomen with their
claspers. In both species, it is only afterwards that the male
legs play a minor role in mating: in P. dikowi, males rest
their fore tarsi on the female postpronotal callus whilst
the males of S. secunda rest their fore tarsi mid-way along
the female wing margin. Convergence in morphology is
often driven by similarities in habitat and environment.
However, there are no aspects of the known autecology of
these two species that could explain the convergent evolution of the mounting behavior. Both are typical scavenger

flies that use cow dung as breeding substrate. Sepsis
secunda is mostly found on open pastures in hot and dry
areas of North America, while P. dikowi is only known
from forests at mid-elevation sites in the tropics [64]. Furthermore, both species co-occur in the same habitat with
other sepsid species that have the "normal" wing grasp.
Evolutionary biologists have long predicted and documented convergence in sexually dimorphic structures
[45]. Some authors attribute the convergent evolution of
correlated traits to highly conserved patterns of pleiotropy
as a potential mechanism for channeling sexual shape
dimorphism in Diptera [71]. These hypotheses address
the proximate causes for the convergent evolution of sexual dimorphisms and should be complemented with
studies that can address the ultimate causation. We suggest that the ultimate reasons for why similar genetic
architecture may be utilized to produce convergent dimorphisms are convergent changes in mating behavior. In our
case the convergent loss of the wing clamp leads to the
convergent loss of the leg dimorphisms. Yet, more intriguing is our finding of convergent evolution of a very specific new mounting behavior which may suggest that
highly conserved patterns of pleiotropy and a conserved
genetic architecture may also exist for behavior.
We had previously outlined that there is only scant information on how the function of sexually dimorphic traits
change over time. Our study helps to fill the void. In the
sepsid outgroups and Orygma luctuosum the fore femora
and tibiae of the males function like the same structure in
most flies. However, in most species of Sepsidae the male
forelegs acquire an additional function, i.e., the clamping
of the females' wingbase and as a result a new sexual
dimorphism evolves. Subsequently, the male forelegs
undergo extensive and fast modification as revealed in

Figure 1 where all 28 species with sexually dimorphic legs
have species-specific modifications. However, as P. dikowi
and S. secunda document sexual dimorphisms can also
disappear once a structure loses its role in mating behavior.
There are still relatively few studies that document how a
behavioral change is correlated with a morphological
change [18,29,31,32]. However, a similar case is also
known from seaweed flies (Diptera: Coelopidae) where
the male foretarsus touches the female antenna during
mating [72]. A new morphological structure, a thumbnaillike process, evolved on the basitarsus of males and it
must be evolving rapidly because it differs between the
different species of Coelopidae [73]. The antlered flies in
the genus Phytalmia (Diptera: Tephritidae) provide
another example. Males have cuticular projections on the
head (antlers) that are used in male-male combat for territory and the complexity of the antler shapes differs quite
drastically between species [74]. Species with complex
antlers have simple behavioral repertoires whilst those
with simpler antlers evolved more complex behaviors
involving the fore, mid and hind legs (e.g.: 'wing-locking'
and 'stilting' [33]).
The novel mounting technique in Perochaeta dikowi and
Sepsis secunda is not only associated with the loss of sexually dimorphic legs, but also associated with the gain of
new sexual dimorphisms. In P. dikowi the males have
modified fourth or fifth sternites that form brushes. These
are used during copulation [64]. In S. secunda, the males
have sexually dimorphic 4th tergites. Normally, this tergite
is monomorphic which is not surprising given that the
dorsal side of the male abdomen is not involved in the
mating behavior of most sepsids. However, in S. secunda
the male tergites touch the female when the male abdo-

men is curled forward [see Additional file 8] (or visit the
following website [65]). A new dorsal, bump-like extension of the tergite four evolves and this tergite becomes
strongly sexually dimorphic (see Figure 5; SEM picture).
In addition, S. secunda has an elongated abdomen (elongated segments I & II). In particular, the posterior part of
the segment II is strongly lengthened and connected to a
distinctly constricted tergite three (see Figure 5; red
arrow). This constriction is likely related to the new mating behavior that requires the male to bend his abdomen
forward. Indeed, this constriction closely resembles the
wasp waist of parasitoid wasps that need to have similar
flexibility in order to use their ovipositor for injecting poison and/or eggs into a host. It appears likely that these
morphological changes in S. secunda occurred rapidly
because they are not found in its sister group, S. duplicata,
and the two species are very similar with regard to the barcoding gene COI (1.97%; normal distances in most
closely related Diptera species > 3% [75]).

Several groups of Diptera are important models for investigating sexual conflict. A number of studies have documented coevolution between male and female
reproductive characters. For instance, Minder et al. (2005)
show that the sperm length in males evolves with the
length of spermathecal ducts in females across several species of yellow dung flies (Scathophagidae) [22]. In Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophilidae) female resistance
evolves in response to the harm caused by male accessory
gland proteins that reduce female fitness and are transferred during copulation [77-80]. Furthermore, Bonduriansky and Rowe (2005) argued that intralocus sexual
conflict reduces the heritability of sexual traits in Prochyliza xanthostorna (Piophilidae) and Otronen (1994) suggested that inter-sexual conflict over mating patterns led
to repeated copulations in Dryomyza anilis (Dryomyzidae)
[81]. In Sepsidae, some authors argued for sexual conflict
[38,47,82] while others claimed that the evolution of sexual dimorphisms is driven by female choice [35,37].

Throughout the discussion, we often implicitly assumed
that the change in behavior preceded the loss of the sexual
dimorphism although technically the strict correlation
between the two traits could also imply the reverse order.
However, based on functional considerations it appears
unlikely that the reduction of the male leg armature preceded the behavioral change given that the leg armature
has been experimentally shown to be important for successful mating in sepsids [37,44,51,76]. Reversing the
order of events would also not alter our finding of a strict
correlation between mounting behavior and the losses
and gains of sexual dimorphisms in Sepsidae.

In our study, we have identified several elements that are
characteristic of an arms race: morphological variation
among close relatives as well as a correlation between
morphology and behavior. However, we only documented this coevolution within the male sex and in order
to document sexual conflict, we would also need to document coevolutionary responses in the females (see [45]).
In the absence of this evidence, we cannot attribute the
diversity of male foreleg armature to sexually antagonistic
coevolution.

Conclusion
One of the most powerful indirect techniques in evolutionary biology is using the comparative method to investigate convergent evolution [83]. By combining
behavioral, morphological, and phylogenetic data, we are
here able to show that sexual dimorphisms evolve fast and
convergently in Sepsidae. Homoplasy is not restricted to
sexual dimorphisms, but also affects mounting behavior.
Our study furthermore documents how important it is to
study the function of sexually dimorphic structures.

dimorphic dorsal 'bump'.

NP conducted all the mating behavior experiments in this
paper. Both NP and KFâYS were responsible for the morphological documentation of the various sexually dimorphic and monomorphic structures. The molecular work
i.e. DNA matrix assembly was primarily carried out by KFâ
YS with help from Ms. Sujatha N. Kutty. RM contributed
to the conception of this research and performed all the
phylogenetic analyses in the paper. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.
