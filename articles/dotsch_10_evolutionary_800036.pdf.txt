Abstract
Background: The constant increase in development and spread of bacterial resistance to antibiotics poses a serious
threat to human health. New sequencing technologies are now on the horizon that will yield massive increases in our
capacity for DNA sequencing and will revolutionize the drug discovery process. Since essential genes are promising
novel antibiotic targets, the prediction of gene essentiality based on genomic information has become a major focus.
Results: In this study we demonstrate that pooled sequencing is applicable for the analysis of sequence variations of
strain collections with more than 10 individual isolates. Pooled sequencing of 36 clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa
isolates revealed that essential and highly expressed proteins evolve at lower rates, whereas extracellular proteins
evolve at higher rates. We furthermore refined the list of experimentally essential P. aeruginosa genes, and identified
980 genes that show no sequence variation at all. Among the conserved nonessential genes we found several that are
involved in regulation, motility and virulence, indicating that they represent factors of evolutionary importance for the
lifestyle of a successful environmental bacterium and opportunistic pathogen.
Conclusion: The detailed analysis of a comprehensive set of P. aeruginosa genomes in this study clearly disclosed
detailed information of the genomic makeup and revealed a large set of highly conserved genes that play an
important role for the lifestyle of this microorganism. Sequencing strain collections enables for a detailed and extensive
identification of sequence variations as potential bacterial adaptation processes, e.g., during the development of
antibiotic resistance in the clinical setting and thus may be the basis to uncover putative targets for novel treatment
strategies.
Background
In the face of the global emergence of multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens, the search for new classes of
antimicrobial agents is one of the most important challenges of modern medicine. Novel potential anti-bacterial
drugs have mainly been discovered by conventional
screening methods. These methods involved the testing
of natural products or synthetic chemicals for growth
inhibition or killing of wild-type test organisms, with the
specific mode of action being worked out later [1-4].
However, recent advances in in silico genomic approaches
have provided an opportunity to specifically highlight
potential drug targets and have facilitated a paradigm
shift from direct antimicrobial screening programs
toward rational target-based strategies, where drug dis* Correspondence: susanne.haeussler@helmholtz-hzi.de

improvements of genome-based technologies such as
whole genome expression- and protein-profiling as well
as whole genome sequencing has lead to further changes
in the drug discovery process. This is due to the fact that
large amounts of relevant biological information have
become available to address highly complex biological
questions [8-10].
As essential genes provide perfect potential drug targets, it has been claimed that an important task of rational target validation would be the identification of the
essentiality of the genes within the genome of one organism [6]. There are several techniques to identify essential
genes. First, experimental genetic inactivation of a potential target can be accomplished by gene disruption [11],
either in a case-to-case approach [12] or in a high
throughput mode [13,14] in order to provide a genomewide assessment of essential genes in an organism. When
interpreting genetic inactivation data it should, however,

be recognized that the inability to isolate a viable stain
under standard laboratory conditions is generally judged
as evidence of essentiality, albeit these conditions might
not reflect the growth conditions in, e.g., the host environment. In addition to the experimental validation of
gene essentiality, information can be received by applying
comparative genomics which involves the comparison of
multiple fully sequenced genomes in order to identify a
minimal genome set necessary to support bacterial viability [15,16]. This bioinformatic strategy assumes that bacteria accomplish essential functions through common
mechanisms and that the genes encoding these functions
would be highly conserved. An alternative approach for
the prediction of gene essentiality would be to draw information from the sequence of the gene itself. The detailed
bioinformatic analysis of the genomic makeup of one
organism might give all the information necessary to classify a gene.
Although it was suggested that there is no difference
between the rates of evolution for essential and nonessential genes in eukaryotes, Jordan et al. [17] demonstrated that essential genes appeared to be more conserved than non-essential genes, based on the analysis of
multiple complete genomic sequences and experimental
knock out data of three bacterial species. However, other
studies have suggested an important direct influence of
the expression levels on the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions in bacteria and demonstrated that when a control for this variable was included, essentiality played no
significant role in the rate of protein evolution [18].
In this study we aimed to address the main issue of
whether essential genes are more evolutionarily conserved than nonessential ones in bacteria and analyzed
the impact of the gene expression rate and subcellular
localization of the encoded proteins as additional factors
that are linked to protein evolution. A remarkable collection of genomic data is already available for the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa [19]. Sequence
information of six strains has been published [20-22,24],
and there is a large collection of transcriptional profiles
that have been recorded under various environmental
conditions [25]. Furthermore, comprehensive experimental knock out libraries of two P. aeruginosa strains have
been established [13,14].
In this study we amended the existing collection of P.
aeruginosa genomic data with whole-genome sequence
data from 36 clinical P. aeruginosa strains in order to
accurately and definitively revisit the interdependence of
gene essentiality, rate of nonsynonymous substitutions,
gene expression and subcellular localization.

Results and Discussion
Pooled sequencing of 36 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates

In order to analyze the sequence variation of P. aeruginosa on a genome wide scale, a collection of 36 strains,
merged to three 'sequence pools' (additional file 1), was
sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer. Additionally, four single strains (also included in one of the
sequence pools) were sequenced individually, so that the
accuracy of results obtained from the pooled samples
could be analyzed. Pooling DNA from different strains instead of sequencing all 36 genomes individually - was
demonstrated to efficiently yield a large amount of data
with an economically reasonable effort. Since we were
mainly interested in the variation of the P. aeruginosa
core genome [21], the obtained sequence fragments (35
bp Illumina paired end reads) were mapped to the
genome of the reference strain PAO1 [23]. Genome coverage was sufficient for all sequencing runs with read
depths (whole genome average) of 30.8 to 63.8 (Table 1),
with the exception of some regions showing significantly
decreased read depths. Such sequencing 'holes' indicate
regions that are absent from the respective strain or - in
case of sequence pools - from a fraction of the pooled
strains. Short read data from all sequencing runs have
been deposited at the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA)
with the accession number 'SRP001802'.
Sequence variation in P. aeruginosa

The median sequence variation (for protein coding genes
in all 36 strains) was calculated to be ~0.47%, which is
consistent with previous reports that found sequence
variation in P. aeruginosa to be about one order of magnitude lower than in other γ-proteobacteria [26,27]. Nucleotide substitutions in genes coding for proteins can be
either synonymous (do not change the amino acid
sequence, also called silent substitutions), or non-synonymous (change the amino acid sequence). The median
number of non-synonymous differences dN for all protein coding genes was 2.1 × 10-3 with a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous (dS) substitutions of dN:dS = 0.19,
indicating that variations of amino acid sequences are
generally suppressed by selection.
It is well known that the P. aeruginosa core genome is
highly conserved and there are only few exceptions of
highly variable genes (e.g., pilA or the pyoverdin cluster,
[26]), while inter-strain variation is mostly restricted to
the accessory genome including pathogenicity islands
and prophages [28]. Consequently, sequence variation
among the 36 clinical P. aeruginosa strains was markedly
increased (dN = 3.5 × 10-3) for genes belonging to these
regions of genomic plasticity (RGPs, [21]).

Essential genes in P. aeruginosa

According to the generally used definition, essential
genes cannot be deleted from an organism without a
lethal effect. Following this definition, the essential subset
of genes within the P. aeruginosa genome has been determined [29] from a comparison of the two comprehensive
transposon mutant libraries that are currently available
for the two reference strains PAO1 [14] and PA14 [13].
For a total number of 335 genes, no transposon insertion
was detected in either project [13]. However, three of
these 335 putative essential genes were absent in at least
two of the four individually sequenced genomes (Table 2):
PA0637, which belongs to a cluster of genes (PA0616 PA0648) encoding hypothetical phage-related proteins;
PA2387 (fpvI), encoding a transcriptional regulator
involved in pyoverdin mediated iron-uptake; and PA2565,
encoding an unclassified hypothetical protein. Further-

more, we found that the normalized read depth was significantly reduced for these three genes in at least one of
the sequence pools indicating that these three genes are
not ubiquitously present in all strains and thus are most
likely not essential for P. aeruginosa.
Codon adaptation index in P. aeruginosa

In a previous attempt to link gene essentiality with the
gene expression level, the codon adaptation index (CAI,
[30]) was used as an approximation for gene expression
[18] which is based on the assumption that highly
expressed genes are generally optimized for translation
speed and accuracy [31]. Essential genes were found to
have a generally increased CAI as an indicator for their
increased expression in E. coli and B. subtilis [18]. Here
we used expression data of 232 microarrays from 27 independent experiments (downloaded from the NCBI Gene

Expression Omnibus (GEO) website [25]) to get an estimate of the average gene expression level of each P. aeruginosa gene and compared gene expression and CAI for all
genes of the P. aeruginosa genome. The bias caused by the
specific setup of individual transcriptome experiments
was assumed to be minimized by the large number of
independent data sets that where included in this calculation. Indeed, the CAI is generally very high (Figure 1A),
which is not reflected in a global increase in gene expression (Figure 1B). Additionally, correlation of CAI and
gene expression was found to be weak (Figure 1C), supporting the previous findings of Kiewitz and Tümmler
[27] who showed that the codon usage is globally optimized in P. aeruginosa and not restricted to only highly
expressed genes pointing towards a generally high level of
adaptation throughout the genome that would ensure
optimal gene expression under various environmental
and metabolic conditions. In consistence, we found the
CAI to be significantly reduced in genes of the accessory
genome (Figure 1D), which in many cases were acquired
horizontally and also differ from the core genome in several other aspects (e.g., GC content).

Gene essentiality and expression level are correlated with
genetic variability

It has previously been shown that essential genes are
more evolutionarily conserved than nonessential genes
[17], and indeed determination of non-synonymous and
synonymous substitution rates dN and dS for the 36 clinical P. aeruginosa strains confirmed this expected correlation of sequence variation and essentiality (Figure 2). If
genes are grouped by their functional classification, the
variation is lowest for genes involved in 'transcription,
RNA processing, degradation', 'translation, post-translational modification, degradation' and 'cell division', which
are enriched for essential genes (Figure 3).
In addition to gene essentiality, a high gene expression
rate has previously been shown to correlate with low
sequence variation [18], and it was proposed that the
underlying driving force for the slower evolution of
essential genes is that most of the highly expressed genes
are also generally indispensable. To test this for P. aeruginosa, we compared the gene expression data of P. aeruginosa (averaged from 232 microarrays as described above)
with the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions, dN (Fig-

Furthermore, essential genes showed a significantly
increased expression level in P. aeruginosa. If the gene
expression data are grouped by essentiality it becomes
clear, that essential genes show a significant increased
proportion of highly expressed genes (Figure 4B). With
the aim of testing whether the observed correlation of
gene essentiality and dN is the result of this overrepresentation of high expression rates among the essential genes
or whether there is also an independent effect, we performed a statistical test for conditional independence.
Therefore, the dN-values of the non-essential genes were
normalized in order to compensate for their lower
expression rates. The null hypothesis for the test for conditional independence was that the distributions of the
dN-values are identical for essential and non-essential
genes after this normalization has been performed. The
null hypothesis of conditional independence had to be
rejected for the averaged data set of all 36 strains (p =
0.0169). This means that, besides the expression level,
essentiality also accounts for dN in P. aeruginosa,
although the statistical significance is not very high.
Apparently, the effect of gene expression on protein evolution rates is dominant in P. aeruginosa, but still an inde-

pendent (though weaker) effect of essentiality could be
observed.
Extracellular proteins evolve at a faster rate

Other parameters that have been identified to correlate
with slow protein evolution include protein localization
(with extracellular proteins being more variable than
cytoplasmic ones) [32-34], evolutionary age [34] and protein connectivity [33].
In P. aeruginosa genes encoding extracellular and outer
membrane proteins ('extracellular genes') showed a significant increase in dN as compared to cytoplasmic genes
(Figure 5). We also repeated robust regression for the dN
and expression data for each class of subcellular localization independently. The aforementioned negative correlation of dN and gene expression could be found for all
localization classes with the exception of extracellular
genes. On the contrary, extracellular genes even had a
slightly positive coefficient indicating that they are even
more variable if they are highly expressed (not shown).
Highly conserved non-essential genes

As described above and depicted in Figure 2, essential
genes were shown to be generally more conserved than
non-essential ones in our collection of P. aeruginosa
strains. Vice versa, many highly conserved genes were
essential according to the standard definition (experimentally essential) because no transposon mutants are avail-

able in either of the two comprehensive libraries [13,14].
However, we also found a large subset of genes that are
experimentally dispensable but highly conserved. Genes
that are dispensable, but conserved throughout distantly
related bacteria, have been termed persistent non-essen-

tial genes and are proposed to be regarded as truly essential from an evolutionary point of view [35]. These genes
might be dispensable for short term survival and growth
under laboratory conditions but are in fact essential for
successful survival of the population under varying environmental conditions in its native habitat.
Interestingly, overall as many as 980 protein encoding
genes (only 124 of which were experimentally essential)
did not exhibit any variations in the protein sequence (dN
= 0, completely conserved genes) in the 36 clinical isolates
and 79 were even identical at the nucleotide level (dS = 0).
While this is consistent with the generally high conservation of the P. aeruginosa core genome, these genes could
furthermore be interpreted as being 'evolutionarily essential' for the species P. aeruginosa in a sense similar to the
aforementioned persistent non-essential genes [35].
Among the 980 completely conserved genes (additional
file 2) we found many encoding ribosomal proteins, genes
important for energy production (respiratory chain, ATP
synthase) or DNA replication and repair, e.g., dnaN
(encoding for a DNA polymerase III subunit) or the helicase ruvA/ruvB. Many of them also belong to the class of
persistent non-essential genes in γ-Proteobacteria [35].
Remarkably, among the set of completely conserved
genes we also found the two paralogous operons phzA1G1 and phzA2-G2 that encode enzymes necessary for
phenazine synthesis [36]. Both operons are almost identical, not only within one strain (with only a few dissimilarities between genes phzA1/2, phzB1/2 and phzC1/2 in
PAO1) but furthermore no sequence variation could be
detected for the whole collection of 36 clinical strains
(with the only exceptions of phzA1 and phzB2) - in most
cases not even at the nucleotide level (dS = 0). Phenazines
including pyocyanin, which is responsible for the well
known blue-green color of P. aeruginosa cultures, and
which is a major virulence factor [37], have been shown
to mediate extracellular electron transfer under
microaerophilic conditions [38]. Other genes involved in
phenazine synthesis and regulation (phzM, mexG, pqsE)
and many regulatory genes - vfr, algU, rsmA, gacA, phoP,
mvaT, algR, and phoB, all of which play an important role
in the environmental versatility of P. aeruginosa including
virulence [39,40] - also showed no protein variations.
Additionally, we identified the quorum sensing (QS)
genes lasI, rhlR and rsaL to be fully conserved at the protein level. It has been reported that QS is frequently
impaired in clinical isolates, especially those isolated
from long term chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF)
patients [41-43]. Thereby, loss of QS is mainly caused by
disruption of lasR that also showed considerable variation in this study, including the identification of premature stop-codons in a fraction of strains (not shown).
While the high conservation of the above described genes
of the las and rhl system underlines the general impor-

tance of QS for P. aeruginosa, loss of QS - preferably by
disruption of lasR - might be an important adaptive strategy to more specific habitats such as the chronically
infected CF lung.
Highly conserved genes linked to antibiotic resistance

Assuming that high conservation of genes is positively
correlated with their evolutionary importance, the 980
highly conserved genes described above might be potential novel drug targets. To further examine this potential,
we compared the list of genes with the results of three
recently published screens for resistance determinants in
P. aeruginosa [44-46]. In total, of the 980 genes 27 were
identified in at least one of the three screens as being positively linked to antibiotic resistance (additional file 2).
Since non-specific drugs can cause more side-effects,
potential new drug targets should be specific for the bacteria targeted. Thus, in order to determine the specificity
of the highly conserved genes with respect to their phylogenetic distribution, we performed a BLASTP search of
all 980 protein sequences against the database of nonredundant protein sequences (nr) obtained from the
NCBI BLAST website http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. 56
genes were found to be specific to Pseudomonas, this
included 24 species-specific genes for which no orthologs
outside P. aeruginosa were identified (Table 3). For the
majority of genes a large number of orthologs could be
identified that belonged to a variety of species outside the
Pseudomonas genus indicating a broad phylogenetic distribution among different bacterial genera. At least one
human ortholog was identified for 6 of the 980 genes
(additional file 2), which might be adversely affected by a
drug.

Conclusions
Thanks to recent advances in sequencing technologies it
has been possible to analyze many genomes with little
expense within a short space of time. Because wholegenome sequence data and bioinformatics provide potential for large scale comparative genomics and evolutionary inference, they will be an important sector in the
future global approaches for deciphering the genomic
make-up of an organism and for rational drug discovery
programs. In the presented work, we have demonstrated
the combined use of short read sequencing and bioinformatic methods to analyze a whole collection of clinical P.
aeruginosa strains. The genome sequence data of 36
pooled bacterial strains combined with the availability of
more than 200 gene expression profiles and the experimental genome-wide assessment of essential genes, gave
the unique opportunity to revisit the central question of
the interdependency of the effects of various factors on
sequence variation in an accurate and definite manner.
Here, we have confirmed that the rate of expression is a

major determinant of how rapidly a protein evolves. We
were furthermore able to demonstrate an independent
correlation of gene essentiality with protein evolution
rates in P. aeruginosa, although essential genes on average
also showed an increased expression. Additionally, we
could demonstrate increased substitution rates for genes
encoding for extracellular proteins.
Furthermore, our comparison of whole genome
sequence data of 36 P. aeruginosa strains revealed a subset of 980 proteins that were fully conserved, and did not
show any variation in the amino acid sequence. The full
conservation of these protein sequences may indicate
their evolutionary importance for P. aeruginosa as a species, comparable to the persistent nonessential genes on
the inter-species level. Among the completely conserved
proteins, we found many that are involved in the central
cellular mechanisms like energy production, replication
and protein synthesis, many of which were also identified
by Fang et al. as persistent nonessential genes, or that are
coding for regulatory and virulence factors (additional
file 2). In accordance with the lifestyle of P. aeruginosa as
a versatile environmental organism and opportunistic
pathogen, this demonstrates a) the high level of optimiza-

tion of the genome (which is also obvious in the codon
bias, Figure 1) and b) the evolutionary importance of
these genes for its survival in various habitats.
The genomic analysis of multiple strains will greatly
enhance our knowledge on the distribution and variation
of genes and their relation to the lifestyle of the particular
organism. A future expansion of this study, which is
biased towards clinical isolates, would be to include soil
and water isolated P. aeruginosa strains and to test
whether they share the identified traits. Furthermore, the
comparison of strain collections with specific virulence
or resistance phenotypes will simplify the detection of
genetic determinants that are responsible for the development of severe infections and/or multi-resistance and
will uncover putative targets for novel anti-bacterial strategies.

Methods
Organism & Culturing

A collection of 36 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates (additional file 1) was used for sequencing. The strains were
divided into 3 groups and sequenced as pooled samples.
Group 1 contained fourteen strains, group 2 seven strains

Dötsch et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:234
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/234

and group 3 fifteen strains. Out of group 1, four strains
(Psae1152, Psae1747, Psae2136 and Psae2162) were
selected to be also sequenced individually. Each strain
was cultivated independently in 5 mL LB medium in 50
mL glass flasks at 37°C, 180 rpm over night. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation of 1 mL culture (5 min, 8000
rpm) in a tabletop microcentrifuge and washed once by
resuspension in 1 mL H2O and repeated centrifugation.
For sequencing of pooled samples, all 36 isolates were
grown independently in 2 mL LB medium in glass tubes
at 37°C, 180 rpm over night. Cells were harvested by centrifugation of 1 mL culture (5 min, 8000 rpm), the supernatant and visible extracellular matrix material were
removed and the remaining pellets were resuspended in 1
mL H2O. Cell suspensions were pooled according to their
allocation to one of the three groups at equal cell numbers as estimated by determination of the optical density
at 600 nm using a NanoDrop photometric device (ThermoScientific). The resulting pooled suspensions were
centrifuged (5 min, 8000 rpm), supernatant was removed
and the pellets were stored at -70°C.
DNA preparation and sequencing

Genomic DNA was isolated from thawed pellets using
the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were further
prepared and sequenced using 35 bp paired end sequencing on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina). Libraries of 300
bp prepared according the manufacturer's instructions
"Preparing Samples for Paired-End-Sequencing". Cluster
generation was performed using the Illumina cluster station, sequencing for read 1 and read 2 on the Genome
Analyzer followed a standard protocol. The fluorescent
images were processed to sequences using the Genome
Analyzer Pipeline Analysis software 1.3.2 (Illumina).
The primary sequencing results (short read data) of the
four individually sequenced strains and the three pools
have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive
(SRA, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi) as
a single study with the accession number 'SRP001802'.
Sequence analysis

The sequence output (35 base pair short reads) of the
Genome Analyzer II was transformed to FastQ format
and mapped against the genome sequence of reference
strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 downloaded from the
Pseudomonas genome database [19] using the 'easyrun'
option of the Maq software [47]. For the four single
strains, genetic variations were identified from the 'consensus.snp' output file produced by Maq. SNPs were filtered by consensus quality (≥ 30) and read depth (≥ 15) to
exclude low quality reads. For the pooled sequences,
genetic variations were identified using a Perl script for
SNP detection from pooled DNA samples that uses the N option of Maq to calculate frequencies with confidence

Page 9 of 11

intervals for all SNPs [48]. To optimize parameter settings
for P. aeruginosa sequence data, the results of the four
individual samples were pooled in silico and analyzed
using the aforementioned script with varying parameter
sets (minimum mapping quality: 20 - 40, maximum mismatches per read: 1 - 5). The results were compared with
the SNPs detected in the four individually sequenced
strains. Using ≥ 25 mapping quality and ≤ 3 mismatches
yielded a sensitivity of 89.8% and specificity (fraction of
true positives) of 99.0%, therefore these parameters were
applied as standard settings for SNP identification in the
pooled sequences data.
In case of the four individually sequenced strains, the
rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution (relative to the PAO1 reference genome) were
computed for all gene sequences based on the Goldman
& Yang model [49] using MBEtoolbox for Matlab [50].
For the pooled sequencing data, these algorithms were
not applicable because SNPs are not generally present in
all strains. Therefore the substitution rates dS and dN
were approximated by calculating the weighted average
amount of substitutions per site (i.e., per codon):
dN j ,k =

3
j

∑w a ,
i i

i

where dNj, k and dSj, k are the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rate (per site/codon) for gene j in
data set k, lj is the length of gene j (base pairs), wi is the
weight (relative frequency) of SNP i and ai is 1 if the SNP
constitutes a nonsynonymous substitution and 0 otherwise ('silent' mutations). To calculate the average values
for the complete set of 36 strains, the values of each
pooled sequence were weighted by the number of strains:
dN j =

∑ s dN
k

j ,k ,

k

where dN j and dS j are the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rate averaged for all 36 strains, sk is
the number of strains included in data set k and dNj, k and
dSj, k are the respective rate for data set k.
Information on gene essentiality in P. aeruginosa was
taken from the Database of Essential Genes [29]http://
tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/, which integrates the results of two
comprehensive P. aeruginosa transposon mutant libraries
[13,14]. Gene annotation data (PseudoCAP functional
category, subcellular localization, etc.) were downloaded
from the Pseudomonas genome database [19]http://
www.pseudomonas.com/. Gene expression data were
obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database [25]. The median expression for each gene was cal-

Dötsch et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:234

culated from normalized absolute log2 signals of 232
microarrays (27 independent experiments) found in the
database for the GPL84 platform (Affymetrix P. aeruginosa array Pae_G1a).
Robust regression

Standard least squares regression is extremely sensitive to
single outliers. Robust regression replaces the squared
error by other error measures reducing the influence of
outliers [51]. In order to avoid artifacts introduced by
outliers with respect to dN or the expression level, we
have preferred robust regression over standard least
squares regression. Here we have applied robust regression based on Huber's error function as it is implemented
in the statistics software R in the rlm-method in the package MASS.
Statistical test for conditional independence

The random variable X is said to be conditionally independent of the random variable Y given the random variable Z if P(X|Y,Z) = P(X|Z) holds. Conditional
independence means that X might be highly correlated
with Y as well as Z, but the correlation between X and Y
is fully explained or covered by Z. Here, we apply a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to the distributions of the dN-values
(corresponding to the random variable X) of the essential
genes and the non-essential genes (essentiality/nonessentiality represents the random variable Y) where the
dN-values of the non-essential genes are weighted
according to the different expression levels (random variable Z) in essential and non-essential genes [52].
Identification of orthologous proteins

P. aeruginosa PAO1 protein sequences obtained from the
Pseudomonas Genome Database [19] were aligned to the
'nr' database of non-redundant protein sequences
obtained from the NCBI blast website [53] using
BLASTP. All the resulting alignments with at least 50%
identities and an alignment length of at least 50% of the
size of the PAO1 protein were considered as orthologs.
