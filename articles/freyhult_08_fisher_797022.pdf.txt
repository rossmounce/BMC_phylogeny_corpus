Abstract
Background: The H/ACA family of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) plays a central role in
guiding the pseudouridylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In an effort to systematically identify the
complete set of rRNA-modifying H/ACA snoRNAs from the genome sequence of the budding
yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a program – Fisher – and previously presented
several candidate snoRNAs based on our analysis [1].
Findings: In this report, we provide a brief update of this work, which was aborted after the
publication of experimentally-identified snoRNAs [2] identical to candidates we had identified
bioinformatically using Fisher. Our motivation for revisiting this work is to report on the status of
the candidate snoRNAs described in [1], and secondly, to report that a modified version of Fisher
together with the available multiple yeast genome sequences was able to correctly identify several
H/ACA snoRNAs for modification sites not identified by the snoGPS program [3]. While we are
no longer developing Fisher, we briefly consider the merits of the Fisher algorithm relative to
snoGPS, which may be of use for workers considering pursuing a similar search strategy for the
identification of small RNAs. The modified source code for Fisher is made available as
supplementary material.
Conclusion: Our results confirm the validity of using minimum free energy (MFE) secondary
structure prediction to guide comparative genomic screening for RNA families with few sequence
constraints.

Findings
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guide nucleotide modi-

fications of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), as well as an
expanding repertoire of cellular RNAs [4,5]. SnoRNAs can

be divided into two broad families: the C/D-box snoRNAs
that guide site-specific 2'-O-methylation of ribose [6,7],
and the H/ACA snoRNAs [8,9] that guide specific conversions of uridine (U) to pseudouridine (ψ).

dictions (a large number of potential candidates are predicted, but many of these will not be true snoRNAs), and
so additional screening of the Fisher candidates is necessary. This is likewise true for the snoGPS program [3].

Both H/ACA and C/D-box snoRNAs target the exact nucleotide for modification via base-complementarity to their
target molecule, thereby permitting sequence-specific
binding to the region of the target to be modified. Based
on the guide regions as well as other known sequence
motifs and structural elements, search tools have been
developed both to identify C/D-box [10,11] and H/ACA
snoRNAs [1,3,11], and, more recently, snoRNAs with no
known target sequence [12,11]. Tools are also available
for screening archaeal genomes for snoRNA-like sRNAs
[13-15].

In this report we describe some minor modifications to
Fisher, a brief update on the candidate snoRNAs we
reported in Edvardsson et al. [1], and a comparative
genome analysis using 14 available yeast genome
sequences which heavily reduced the number of false positives and enabled us to identify three yeast snoRNAs not
identified by Schattner and colleagues' snoGPS program.
We therefore provide a brief comparison of the two search
strategies.

We previously developed the program Fisher as a tool to
screen for H/ACA snoRNAs in the genome of the budding
yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1]. Since the conserved
sequence motifs of the H/ACA box snoRNAs are short
(and in the case of regions of intermolecular interaction
with rRNA target molecules, discontinuous) (Figure 1) the
H/ACA box snoRNAs are harder to identify based on
sequence motifs only, and Fisher therefore relies on both
primary and secondary structure searches. However,
Fisher suffers from a high frequency of false positive pre-

The core bioinformatic analyses reported forthwith were
completed in 2004, but while we were working to experimentally characterize three candidates arising from our
screen, Torchet et al. [2] published a characterization of
those same candidates, which they found independently
using a lab-based experimental approach. Hence we
elected not to pursue the project further. We present the
bioinformatics part of our previous study on account of
the fact there are ongoing requests for the source code of
Fisher, and we therefore wish to provide additional information and results to those originally presented in
Edvardsson et al. [1] concerning the potential utility of

base complementarity to a target RNA (not all snoRNAs carry two functional pseudouridylation pockets). We have designated
these regions ψ1–4 for descriptive purposes. Other key motifs are the H-box, located in the hinge region between the two hairpins, and the ACA box at the 3' end of the molecule.

this program, including confirmation that such a strategy
can in principle be used on other datasets. A brief description of the algorithm follows. For a full description, see
[1]. For the source code of Fisher, see Additional file 1.
The Fisher algorithm in brief
The essence of the algorithm is as follows. First the search
is made for an H-box of the form AN1AN2N3N4N5. This is
then scored using a probabilistic model. If the score is
acceptable the H-box is accepted. The algorithm then
searches downstream for ψ3 and ψ4 motifs (see Figure 1,
Table S1 in Additional file 2) in appropriate locations.
Then the algorithm continues to search for the AHA
sequence. The complete H-AHA region together with a
variable upstream sequence from the H-box is then passed
to the secondary structure filters where acceptable folds
are investigated. It is also possible to require a hairpin to
the left of the H-box containing ψ1 and ψ2 motifs (see Figure 1, Table S1 in Additional file 2) in appropriate locations. The candidates are scored depending on both
primary and secondary structure.
Previously reported candidate snoRNAs
In Edvardsson et al. [1], we presented three possible candidate S. cerevisiae snoRNAs, two of which were located in
the introns of ribosomal protein genes (coding for
RPL43A and RPS11A). A third candidate was overprinted
on the coding sequence of the gene coding for snoRNP U3
protein MPP10. Neither these, nor any other of the 50
high-scoring candidates from our initial analysis could be
detected using either RT-PCR or Northern Blots, whereas
control snoRNAs were readily identified (AMP, P. A.
McLenachan, A. R. Gore, A. M. Idicula, unpublished
observations). We therefore concluded that the real false
positive rate was prohibitively high, despite favourable
preliminary results reported in Edvardsson et al. [1].

et al. [18] Branch lengths are not preserved from the original

current analysis are shown.

Combining Fisher with comparative genome data
Next, we made use of genome sequences from 14 additional yeasts, in order to establish whether sequence conservation could be employed as a filter to reduce the high
false positive rate. The genomes used were as follows: S.
bayanus, S. mikatae [16,17], S. paradoxus, K. waltii [17], S.
castellii, S. kluyveri, S. kudriavzevii [16], C. glabrata, D.
hansenii, K. lactis, Y. lipolytica [18], C. albicans [19], S.
pombe [20] & A. gossypii [21] (see Figure 2 for overview of
their phylogenetic relationships).

nucleotides, and allowed any base at the middle position
of the ACA-box, which increased the number of potential
candidates. We then used blastn [23] to screen the other
yeast genomes for sequences homologous to these candidates, using a penalty of nucleotide mismatch of -4, a
reward for nucleotide match of +5, and a gap creation and
extension penalty of -10. Blast hits shorter than 40 nucleotides, with an identity below 40% or an E-value above
0.01 were not considered as potential homologues. Blast
alignments were extended to cover the full length of the S.
cerevisiae candidate sequence and realigned using CLUSTAL W [24]. This was done iteratively by adding nucleotides to the homologous sequences and realigning until
the alignment covered the full candidate sequence. This
gave a list of pairwise alignments between each S. cerevisiae candidate and potentially homologous sequences in
other yeast genomes, for which pairwise identities could
be established.

As in Edvardsson et al. [1], the S. cerevisiae genome was
downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database
(SGD) [22], and only a reduced version of the genome
was used for the snoRNA screen: i.e. all regions corresponding to open reading frames were removed, with
introns added back into the dataset. We modified Fisher
to accept ψ4 to ACA distances of between 13 and 16

We compared these results with the results of blasting
known S. cerevisiae H/ACA snoRNAs against the comparative genome dataset. We found that all snoRNAs known
at the time of analysis had homologs (as identified by
blastn) in at least three of the four genomes that are most
closely related to S. cerevisiae (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S.
bayanus and S. kudriavzevii), with high sequence identities

BMC Research Notes 2008, 1:49

(see Table S2 in Additional file 2). The sequence identities
were all above 89, 82, 78 and 82%, for S. paradoxus, S.
mikatae, S. bayanus and S. kudriavzevii, respectively. We
therefore further examined those candidates where potential homologues were identified in at least three of these
four genomes, and with a pairwise sequence identity not
below 87, 80, 76 and 80%, respectively.
Sequences in other genomes with high sequence identity
to Fisher candidates were examined for the presence of the
following features: H-box, ACA-box, and a 3' pseudouridylation pocket (consisting of ψ3 and ψ4 and elements –
See Figure 1, Table S1 in Additional file 2) downstream of
the H-box. These features were required to be completely
conserved or to at least fulfil the same requirements as
specified by Fisher (see [1]). We examined rRNA regions
around the pseudouridylated nucleotides in S. cerevisiae
and confirmed that these were conserved across the yeast
species investigated. Hence the ψ3 and ψ4 and elements
making up the pseudouridylation pockets of potentially
homologous sequences were all required to be complementary to the same sequence (see Table S1 in Additional
file 2). We likewise required the ACA-box to be located at
a distance of between 13 and 16 nucleotides from the 5'
end of the ψ4 element. Finally, we made sure that all
homologous sequences had an H-box upstream of the ψ3
element at a position corresponding to the H-box position in the aligned candidate sequence, or not more than
ten nucleotides upstream or downstream from this position.
We next examined the secondary structure of all candidates that fulfilled the above sequence criteria. H/ACA
snoRNAs form a hairpin in the region between H-box and
the ACA-box, with the ψ3 and ψ4 and elements forming an
interior bulge (the 3' pseudouridylation pocket). Observation of known snoRNA structures indicated that the
region just downstream of ψ3 and just upstream of ψ4 are
always base paired. This observation was investigated in
more detail for all known snoRNAs by folding the regions
just downstream/upstream of ψ3 and ψ4 using RNAcofold
[25,26]. Table S3 (Additional file 2) shows the number of
base pairs predicted for the stem-loop structure formed
between the nucleotides immediately 3' and 5' of the ψ3
and ψ4 elements, and the number of unpaired bases
between the pseudouridylation pockets and the stem
region immediately above. The investigation showed that
every known H/ACA snoRNA with a 3' pseudouridylation
pocket have, at a distance of at most one nucleotide from
the ψ3 and ψ4 boxes, a region of at least three complementary bases.
We therefore used these criteria for assessing candidate
snoRNA sequences with RNAcofold, and discarded all
sequences that did not conform to these folding criteria.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/49

Finally a manual check of folding for the complete
sequences of all remaining snoRNA candidates served to
filter out candidates that did not conform to the expected
snoRNA structure.
Identification of candidate snoRNAs and conservation across yeast
genomes
To be able to compare our results with the results reported
by Schattner et al. [3], we performed a search for snoRNAs
predicted to guide pseudouridylation at nine sites on S.
cerevisiae rRNA, for which snoRNAs were identified for six
targets (Schattner et al. [3], and three of which remained
unidentified at the time of our analyses (maps 10, 13, 15,
22, 32, 35 and 7, 14, 33, respectively – see Table S1 in
Additional file 2)). For the six targets studied by Schattner
et al., Fisher reported 1590 unique snoRNA candidates.
The comparative filters reduced this number to eight candidates (see Table 1). Among these candidates were
snR80, snR81 and snR82, i.e. three out of the six novel
snoRNAs identified by snoGPS [3]. Two of the novel
snoRNAs, snR84 and snR85, cannot be found by Fisher
since they only possess a 5' pseudouridylation pocket and
Fisher can only identify snoRNAs with a single 3' pocket
and snoRNAs carrying two (i.e. both a 5' and a 3') pocket.
snR83 possesses a 3' pseudouridylation pocket, but was
not among the 1590 candidates. It is rejected by Fisher
because it does not fold into a secondary structure with
two hairpins. It has a canonical 3' hairpin, but lacks the 5'
hairpin and is therefore rejected.

For the remaining three target sites (maps 7, 14 and 33 in
Table S1, Additional file 2), Fisher reported 2256 candidate snoRNAs for a reduced genome dataset (described in
[1]). The comparative filter reduced this number down to
two candidates for each target site (Table 1).
We subsequently performed Northern blots to probe for
expression of these candidates, and found that candidates
2 and 11 were expressed in S. cerevisiae (IT & AMP, unpublished observations). Candidate 2 corresponds to snR80,
which was determined by Torchet et al. [2] to guide pseudouridylation of SSU759 and LSU776, and candidate 11 is
snR86, which Torchet et al. demonstrated was required for
pseudouridylation of LSU2314. None of the candidates for
position 14 (SSU1415) were detected on Northern blots,
and we concluded that these are false positives. Torchet et
al. demonstrated that this pseudouridylation was guided
by snR83, which Fisher fails to detect. As is evident from
Table 1, snR80, snR82 and snR86 are conserved in diverse
yeast species. Both snR80 and snR86 both form hairpin
structures (3' hairpins shown in Figure 3). Alignment of
snR80 from S. cerevisiae with snR80 sequences from other
yeasts, shows that the H-box, ACA-box and the ψ3 and ψ4
boxes forming the 3' pseudouridylation pocket are almost
perfectly conserved, with overall sequence similarity

being high among sensu stricto species (S. cerevisiae, S.
paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus) (see
Figure S1, Additional file 3). In the case of snR86, only the
sequence corresponding to the 3' hairpin is conserved (i.e.
from just upstream from the H-box to the 3' end) (see Figure S2, Additional file 3). Based on a comparison between
snR86 sequences from S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata, Torchet
et al. proposed that the large 5' region of sn86 was structurally conserved. We examined snR86 sequences from 10
yeast species, and, given the low sequence similarity,
uncertainty on the genomic position of the 5'-end for
these sequences, and the consequent difficulty in reliably
aligning these, we are only confident of the conservation
of structure of the 3' region (Figure 3, Figure S2 in Additional file 3).
Comparison of our results to those for snoGPS
snoGPS [3] uses a combination of deterministic tests and
a probabilistic model to search for snoRNA genes. The
program has the option to search for only the 5' stem-loop
or only the 3' stem-loop, but as stated in [3] the two-stem
alternative is usually used, where a two-hairpin structure
is required. snoGPS starts by searching for the guide
sequences and the downstream ACA- or H-box. The hairpin structure is investigated by, for example, measuring

distances between boxes, and complementarity in the
stem regions. For detecting two-stem snoRNAs snoGPS
then proceeds to look for a second stem-loop either
upstream or downstream of the first. Candidates are then
scored using a probabilistic model trained on known
snoRNAs. The deterministic tests in snoGPS are generally
looser than the corresponding tests in Fisher, but the
probabilistic model helps cut down the search space.
However, the snoGPS search of the S. cerevisiae genome
reported in Schattner et al. [3] was complemented with
comparative genome analysis and free-energy calculations, to further reduce the number of false candidates.
This search resulted in the identification of three new
snoRNAs (snR80, snR81, snR85), and confirmation of
three additional candidate H/ACA snoRNAs identified
previously using QRNA (snR84, snR82, snR83) [27].
The comparative genomics filter presented here significantly reduced the number of snoRNA candidates output
by Fisher. As described above, Fisher detected three of the
six snoRNAs identified with snoGPS (snR80, snR81,
snR82), and snR86, not identified by snoGPS. In addition, Fisher correctly identified snR80 as the candidate
responsible for modification at SSU759. Given that the
deterministic filters used in snoGPS are more generous

Page 6 of 8

BMC Research Notes 2008, 1:49

than the corresponding filters in Fisher, we would expect
that the candidates we identify would probably have been
excluded due to the probabilistic filters implemented in
snoGPS. Another possibility is that the candidates did not
pass the comparative genome analysis in [3], which contained a manual evaluation stage.

Comparing the results from our method with the results
reported in [3] we conclude that our algorithm is more
restrictive, but still at the same level of predictive power. A
clear drawback with the Fisher algorithm is that it cannot
detect snoRNAs with only a 5' pseudouridylation pocket,
providing an obvious explanation as to why we could not
identify snR84 and snR85. In the case of snR83, which
possesses a 3' pseudouridylation pocket but not a 5'
pocket, in silico folding reveals it possesses only a single
hairpin structure. As Fisher requires snoRNA candidates to
conform to a two-hairpin secondary structure, any snoRNAs with the structural characteristics of snR83 should
not be identified. Ironically, snR86 is a very large snoRNA
(~1000 nt), and the unusual size and predicted secondary
structure reported therein [2] is such that we would expect
Fisher to not detect it.
While Fisher reports a double hairpin structure for snR86,
a multispecies alignment and secondary structure predictions do not strongly support this. Upstream of the H-box,
there is limited conservation across diverse yeast, in contrast to the well-conserved downstream region (see Figure
S2 in Additional file 3). It would certainly be possible to
modify Fisher to allow single-stem structures. However, a
caveat of such a modification would be an increased
number of false positives. In that the success of such
searches depends heavily upon the availability of multiple
genome sequences from related species, an increase in
false positive results may not necessarily represent a major
obstacle for such datasets.

Conclusion
Our analyses demonstrate that, in spite of the high false
positive rate apparent when screening a single genome,
the Fisher algorithm is effective if used in combination
with a comparative genomics analysis. The combined
approach reported here resulted in a small number of candidates, thereby permitting subsequent experimental
screening for bona fide snoRNAs. This report confirms the
utility of minimum free energy (MFE) secondary structure
prediction as a method for screening for families of structural RNA with few sequence constraints, and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining secondary structure
with comparative genome data.
