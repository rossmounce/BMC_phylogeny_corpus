Abstract
Background: An early dispersal of biologically and behaviorally modern humans from their African
origins to Australia, by at least 45 thousand years via southern Asia has been suggested by studies
based on morphology, archaeology and genetics. However, mtDNA lineages sampled so far from
south Asia, eastern Asia and Australasia show non-overlapping distributions of haplogroups within
pan Eurasian M and N macrohaplogroups. Likewise, support from the archaeology is still
ambiguous.
Results: In our completely sequenced 966-mitochondrial genomes from 26 relic tribes of India, we
have identified seven genomes, which share two synonymous polymorphisms with the M42
haplogroup, which is specific to Australian Aborigines.
Conclusion: Our results showing a shared mtDNA lineage between Indians and Australian
Aborigines provides direct genetic evidence of an early colonization of Australia through south
Asia, following the "southern route".

Background
The greatest ever reconstructed journey of our own species
(Homo sapiens) begins in Africa with a group of huntergatherers, perhaps just a few hundred strong and ends
some 150 – 200 thousand years (ky) later with their six
and a half billion descendants spread across the occupied
world. Most of the DNA and archaeological evidence are
in agreement of the proposition. However, route(s) and
time of such spread, undertaken by the anatomically
modern Africans to populate the world has been the
greater untold part of the story. Recent genetic studies
(especially those based on mitochondrial DNA) suggest
single "southern route" dispersal of modern humans,

extended from the Horn of Africa, across the mouth of the
Red Sea into Arabia and southern Asia some time before
50 ky [1-7]. Subsequently, the modern human populations expanded rapidly along the coastlines of southern
Asia, southeastern Asia and Indonesia to arrive in Australia at least by 45 thousand years before present (kyBP),
best represented by the anatomically modern human skeleton from the site of Lake Mungo 3 in New South Wales
[1,8-16]. An early phylogenetic link between Indians and
Australian Aborigines has also been suggested by observations based on morphology [17]. The major challenge to
this scenario is to document individual steps in this colonization process based on genetics and archaeological evi-

dence. The mtDNA lineages sampled so far from south
Asia, eastern Asia and Australasia show non-overlapping
distributions of haplogroups within macrohaplogroups
M and N and its subclade R [10]. The archaeological map
of Arabia and India are at present largely blank for the critical period from ~50 to ~60 kyBP [18,19]and whatever
intriguing hints of early modern human occupations are
available from the site of Patne in western India,
[20]Jwalapuram in southern India [21] and Batadombalena in Sri Lanka [22,23] suggest closer affinities to African
Middle Stone Age traditions, [3,21] whereas, similarly
"advanced" technologies in the area to the east of the
Indian subcontinent, especially in the relatively wellexplored area of Australia and New Guinea are lacking
[3,8,11].

Results and discussion
The complete mtDNA sequencing indicate that both Australians and New Guineans exclusively belongs to the outof-Africa founder types M and N, thus ultimately
descended from the same African emigrants ~50 to 70
kyBP, as all other Eurasians [24]. However, in context of
the Eurasian phylogeny [25-35], shared branches more
recent than the founding types M, N, and R have not been
reported so far, except a shared variant at nucleotide position 8793 between Australian specific haplogroup M42
and East/Southeast Eurasian specific haplogroup M10
[24].
Our complete mtDNA sequencing of 966 individuals
from 26 relic populations of India identified seven individuals from central Dravidian and Austro-Asiatic tribes
who share two basal synonymous mtDNA polymorphisms G8251A and A9156T with the M42 haplogroup,
which is specific to Australian Aborigines. The phylogenetic reconstruction of 7 Indian (this study) and 6 Australian Aborigine mtDNA sequences from published source
[2,25,36] is shown in Figure 1, and it differs from the previous reports [24,36] in the placement of the G8251A polymorphism. This polymorphism together with A9156T is
present in all 7 Indian samples of this study, as well in one
Indian sample (i.e. PU202) reported previously based on
RFLP [37-39] and in 4 out of 6 Australian sequences used
in this reconstruction. Both G8251A and A9156T are considered ancestral to M42, but the lack of G8251A in an
Australian sub lineage consisting of two genomes indicates a back mutation event. Being based on the combination of two synonymous polymorphisms and their
replication in quite a few Indian samples (7 in this study
and one reported previously [37]), the present phylogenetic reconstruction of the haplogroup M42 seems parsimonious and more stable than the previously suggested
M10 and M42 link through 8793 polymorphism [24].
The coalescence time estimate 55.2 ± 10.8 kyBP of the
average sequence divergence of the Indian and Australian

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/173

M42 coding-region sequences from the root is consistent
with the first evidence of human occupation provided by
11 silcrete flakes with plain and relatively thick striking
platforms recovered from below the lowest gravels in the
barrier sands of the Mungo B trench, [40] bracketed by
ages of 50.1 ± 2.4 and 45.7 ± 2.3 kyBP [8]. The similar or
slightly older ages for the initial human arrival in northern
and western Australia [41-43] also seem to be in agreement. The underlying deposits at Mungo B trench, dated
to 52.4 ± 3.1 kyBP, appear to be culturally sterile [8]suggesting colonization of continental Australia some time
after 50 kyBP from south Asia.
The shared lineage provides direct genetic evidence to the
long suggested ancient link between India and Australia
[17,44,45]. However the deep divergence (i.e. 55.2 ± 10.8
kyBP) of the Indian and Australian branches within M42,
coupled with the evidence of the earliest and most pronounced population expansion outside Africa in Southern Asia estimated to ~52 kyBP using Bayesian Skyline
analysis [46] followed by high mtDNA diversity in Indian
populations [2,4,10,15,27,33], strongly suggest that Australia perhaps along with East/Southeast Eurasia and
Papua New Guinea [24] was populated from Southern
Asia plausibly slightly before or in the beginning of the
population expansion that has given rise to a large
number of mtDNA lineages within macrohaplogroup 'M'
in India.

Conclusion
Our results showing a shared mtDNA lineage between
Indians and Australian Aborigines provides direct genetic
evidence that Australia was populated by modern humans
through south Asia following the "Southern Route". The
divergence of the Indian and Australian M42 codingregion sequences suggests an early colonization of Australia, ~60 to 50 kyBP, quite in agreement with archaeological evidences.

Methods
With the above background, a total of 966 mitochondrial
DNAs (mtDNAs) were completely sequenced from 26
relic tribes of India. Each sample comprises unrelated
healthy donors from whom appropriate informed consent was obtained. The ethical clearance for the study was
obtained from the organizational ethical clearance committee of Anthropological Survey of India.
DNA was extracted from all the collected 4–5 ml blood
samples using standard phenol-chloroform methods [47]
with minor modifications. For complete mtDNA sequencing, DNA was PCR amplified following standard protocols and using the PCR primers and conditions of Rieder
et al. [48]. PCR product was sequenced with both forward
and reverse primers using BigDye Terminator v3.1
sequencing kits from Applied Biosystems on an Applied

Phylogenetic reconstruction of M42 Lineage
Phylogenetic reconstruction of M42 Lineage. The phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using 7 New mtDNA
Sequences from India and 6 Australian Aborigines mtDNA sequences from published source [2,25,36]. The sequence region np
16024 to 434 is missing in two (i.e. DQ112754 and DQ112755) published sequences. Suffixes A, C, G, and T indicate transversions, "d" signifies a deletion and a plus sign (+) an insertion; "s" indicates synonymous polymorphisms; recurrent mutations are
underlined. The prefix "@" indicates back mutation. The coalescence age estimates calculated as per Kivisild et al [2] are presented in thousand years ago (kya). Variation at hypervariable positions 16184–16193, 16519 and insertion C at 309 and 315
are not shown.

Biosystems 3730 automated DNA analyzer. Contig
assembly and sequence alignments were accomplished
with SeqScape v2.5 software from Applied Biosystems.
Mutations were scored relative to the revised Cambridge
Reference Sequence (rCRS) [49] with each deviation confirmed by manual checking of electropherograms. The
phylogenetic tree was reconstructed from median-joining
networks rooted to L3 using NETWORK 4.2.0.1 software
[50]. The tree was checked manually to resolve homoplasies. To confirm the strength of the present phylogenetic
reconstruction, we also searched the complete mtDNA
sequences available at http://www.hvrbase.org[51], http:/
/www.genpat.uu.se/mtDB/[52]
and
http://
www.hmtdb.uniba.it[53]
for
the
mitochondrial
genome(s) harboring polymorphisms G8251A and
A9156T and no similar sequence other than those used in
the present phylogenetic reconstruction were found. The

coalescent age estimates were calculated by Rho (ρ) statistics [54] and using mutation rate of one synonymous transition per 6,764 years [2] calibrated on the basis of an
assumed human-chimp split of 6.5 million years ago.
Standard errors for coalescence estimates were calculated
following Saillard et al [54]. The seven new complete
mtDNA sequences used in the Phylogenetic reconstruction in this study have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers FJ380210–FJ380216). Our other complete
mtDNA sequences under publication elsewhere can also
be found at GenBank with accession numbers FJ383174–
FJ383814.
