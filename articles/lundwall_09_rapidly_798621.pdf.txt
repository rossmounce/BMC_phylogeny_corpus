Abstract
Background: Beta-microseminoprotein, an abundant component in prostatic fluid, is encoded by
the potential tumor suppressor gene MSMB. Some New World monkeys carry several copies of
this gene, in contrast to most mammals, including humans, which have one only. Here we have
investigated the background for the species difference by analyzing the chromosomal organization
and expression of MSMB in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Methods: Genes were identified in the Callithrix jacchus genome database using bioinformatics
and transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR and quantified by real time PCR in the presence of SYBR
green.
Results: The common marmoset has five MSMB: one processed pseudogene and four functional
genes. The latter encompass homologous genomic regions of 32-35 kb, containing the genes of 1214 kb and conserved upstream and downstream regions of 14-19 kb and 3-4 kb. One gene, MSMB1,
occupies the same position on the chromosome as the single human gene. On the same
chromosome, but several Mb away, is another MSMB locus situated with MSMB2, MSMB3 and
MSMB4 arranged in tandem. Measurements of transcripts demonstrated that all functional genes
are expressed in the male genital tract, generating very high transcript levels in the prostate. The
transcript levels in seminal vesicles and testis are two and four orders of magnitude lower. A single
gene, MSMB3, accounts for more than 90% of MSMB transcripts in both the prostate and the
seminal vesicles, whereas in the testis around half of the transcripts originate from MSMB2. These
genes display rapid evolution with a skewed distribution of mutated nucleotides; in MSMB2 they
affect nucleotides encoding the N-terminal Greek key domain, whereas in MSMB3 it is the Cterminal MSMB-unique domain that is affected.
Conclusion: Callitrichide monkeys have four functional MSMB that are all expressed in the male
genital tract, but the product from one gene, MSMB3, will predominate in seminal plasma. This gene
and MSMB2, the predominating testicular gene, have accumulated mutations that affect different
parts of the translation products, suggesting an ongoing molecular specialization that presumably
yields functional differences in accessory sex glands and testis.

Background
Human beta-microseminoprotein (MSMB) is synthesized
from a gene located on chromosome 10, which has
recently attracted much attention since genome wide association studies identified it to be connected with prostate
cancer susceptibility [1,2]. It is an 11-kDa non-glycosylated protein that is expressed in many tissues, but the
concentration is particularly high in prostate secretion [3].
At ejaculation MSMB is transferred with other prostatesecreted components to the seminal plasma, where it has
a concentration in the range of 0.5-0.9 mg/ml in young
healthy males [4]. The protein is synthesized as a precursor of 114 amino acid residues and contains a signal peptide that is removed during secretion to yield the mature
protein of 94 residues, something that is also reflected in
its alternative name: prostate-secreted protein of 94
amino acids (PSP94) [5]. Recent NMR studies show that
MSMB has a unique structure, with an extended configuration, consisting of a four-stranded Greek key-motif and
an exclusive domain of two two-stranded beta-sheets [6].
The only other protein that is assumed to have a similar
structure is the newly identified PC3-secreted microprotein (PSMP): a protein that is highly expressed in the prostate cancer cell-line PC3 [7]. The function of MSMB is not
yet known, but it forms very strong bi-molecular complexes with cysteine-rich secretory protein-3 (CRISP3) in
seminal plasma and PSP94-binding protein (PSP-BP) in
blood serum [8,9].
Phylogenetic studies show that MSMB is present in all this
far analyzed vertebrate species and also in the chordate
amphioxus [10,11]. The protein displays a very rapid evolution, as revealed by the low conservation of the primary
structure between species: e.g., only 45% of the residues
are identical in human and rat MSMB [12]. However, all
vertebrate MSMB molecules seem to carry 10 conserved
Cys that stabilize the 3D structure by forming 5 disulphide bonds [13]. In the chordate amphioxus, one of
these disulfides is missing [11].
We have previously shown that some New World monkeys, e.g. the closely related cotton top tamarin (Saguinus
oedipus) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) of the
primitive Callithricidea family, carry several MSMB in their
genomes, something that is in contrast to most other vertebrate species, which carry a single MSMB [14]. More
recently, we cloned and sequenced 5 MSMB from a cotton-top tamarin genomic library [15]. We concluded that
2 of them were pseudogenes, as one of them, MSMB4, had
a deletion that shifted the reading frame and lead to premature termination, and the other, MSMB5, had the features of a processed pseudogene. The remaining three
genes, MSMB1, MSMB2, and MSMB3 appeared to be
functional from a structural point of view. It was not possible to investigate MSMB transcripts in tamarin tissues

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/96

due to lack of material, but promoter analysis using luciferase reporter in monkey kidney COS cells showed that
only MSMB2 displayed an activity that was comparable
with that of human MSMB.
In this study we have extended our investigation of MSMB
in the common marmoset in order to physically map the
genes at the postulated MSMB locus and to analyze the
relative expression of the genes in the male genital tract.

Methods
Nomenclature
Presently, the HUGO gene nomenclature committee does
not provide official gene symbols to genes that are specific
to non-human primates. In our earlier publications on
cotton-top tamarin MSMB, we used gene names that were
based on clone names. As these names clearly do not agree
with Hugo's gene naming rules, we have decided to adopt
a new nomenclature that is based on the genes' location
on the chromosome. The new gene symbols are given
with the old symbols written within parenthesis as follows: MSMB1 (mspA), MSMB2 (mspE), MSMB3 (mspJ),
MSMB4 (mspB) and MSMB5 (mspH).
Bioinformatics
The June 2007 Callithrix jacchus draft assembly, produced
at the Washington University School of Medicine, St
Louis, was probed with the sequence of the human MSMB
transcript using the program BLAT, available through the
University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome Bioinformatics Site [16]. DNA sequences of the housekeeping
genes GAPDH and CSTB were identified by the same
method using the human orthologs. The DNA contigs
that were identified to contain MSMB or housekeeping
gene sequences were then analyzed further using EMBOSS
Tools [17] and the program package Vector NTI, which is
freely available through Invitrogen's webpage [18].
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Prostate, seminal vesicles and testis from a common marmoset, kept in captivity at the German Primate Center in
Göttingen, Germany, were recovered and frozen in liquid
nitrogen immediately post-mortem and then stored at 80°C until further processing took place. Samples consisting of, 0.09 g prostate or 0.05 g seminal vesicle tissue were
homogenized in 1.5 ml Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden) using a polytron homogenizer (Kinematica Inc, Lucerne, Switzerland). In the same way 0.36 g of
testis tissue was homogenized in 6 ml Trizol reagent. RNA
extracts were prepared according to the protocol provided
with the Trizol reagent. Before cDNA synthesis, samples of
3.3 μg of total RNA were incubated for 30 min at 37°C
with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase (Fermentas Sweden,
Helsingborg, Sweden) in 10 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2, to which 0.5 μl (20

units) of Ribolock RNase inhibitor (Fermentas) was
added. To terminate the digestion, 1 μl of 25 mM EDTA
was added to the samples, which subsequently were incubated for 10 min at 65°C. Each sample was then supplemented with 1 μl containing 100 pmol of oligo(dT)18,
heated for 5 min at 65°C, cooled on ice and subjected to
a collect spin. To the samples were then added 4 μl of 5 ×
reaction buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 250 mM KCl,
20 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM DTT), 0.5 μl (20 units) of Ribolock, 2 μl of 10 mM dNTP and 1 μl (200 units) of RevetAid
M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). Control samples were prepared in parallel by omitting the reverse transcriptase. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by
incubating the samples for 1 h at 42°C. Finally, the samples were diluted with 180 μl of ultra pure water and then
stored at -20°C before further analyses.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Two sets of primer pairs were synthesized for the PCR on
MSMB genes. The first set had forward and reverse primers
that were based on sequences of the second and the third
exon and the second primer set were based on exon three
and four sequences. Primers were also synthesized for two
housekeeping genes: GAPDH and CSTB. The primer
sequences are given in Table 1. The PCR reactions were
run with 2 μl of cDNA in a total volume of 10 μl of 40 mM
Tricine-KOH, 15 mM KOAc, 3.5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 3.75 μg/
ml BSA, 0.005% Tween 20, 0.005% Nonidet-P40, 200 μM
dNTP, 1 μM of forward and reverse primers, and 0.2 μl of
50 × Advantage 2 polymerase mix (Clontech, In vitro Swe-

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/96

den AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The PCR reactions consisted of an initial 1 min incubation at 95°C, followed by
25, 30 or 35 cycles of 30 s of denaturing at 95°C and 1
min annealing and extension at 68°C. At the end of the
program there was an additional 1 min-extension at
68°C. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis
in 2% agarose gels that were stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml). The low range MassRuler DNA ladder
(Fermentas) served as molecular size marker.
DNA sequencing
The specificity of primers was confirmed by PCR on marmoset genomic DNA followed by DNA sequencing. The
PCR was run as above, but the RNA was replaced with 10
ng of genomic DNA. Material from 5 PCR reactions was
pooled and purified using Jetquick (Genomed, SAVEEN
Werner AB, Malmö, Sweden). The DNA concentrations
were estimated following electrophoresis by comparing
the staining intensity of purified PCR fragments with that
of the DNA-bands in the MassRuler DNA ladder. Sequencing reactions were done with 40 ng of DNA template and
4 pmol of diluted PCR primer in a total volume of 20 μl,
using the Big Dye Terminator Ready Reaction Premix
diluted 1:4 and following protocols provided with supplier of the Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Stockholm, Sweden). The DNA
sequencing was done on an ABI 3130 DNA Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems) as a service by the Clinical Chemistry Department at University Hospital MAS, Malmö, Sweden.

Quantitative RT-PCR
The cDNAs that were synthesized for semi quantitative
RT-PCR were also analyzed by real-time PCR in the presence of SYBR Green. In MicroAmp Optical 384-Well Reaction Plates (Applied Biosystems), 10 μl reactions were set
up by addition of 2 μl of primer mix (containing reverse
and forward primers at 5 μM), 3 μl of diluted cDNA template, and 5 μl of Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). The plate was then sealed with MicroAmp
Optical Adhesive Film and real-time PCR was performed
using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). Each primer pair was run on quadruple samples at different concentrations by serially diluting the
templates between 5 and 25 times to yield at least 8
recordings for each gene in each tissue. The real-time PCR
was run with the Fast SYBR Green protocol using the following cycling conditions: an initial activation step at
95°C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at
95°C for 1 s and annealing and extension at 60°C for 20
s. The generated data was analyzed with the Sequence
Detection System 2.3 software that is provided with the
instrument. Cycle threshold (CT) values were calculated
automatically and then slightly adjusted manually to
accommodate all samples in their exponential phase.

The efficacy of the primer pairs was analyzed with prostate
cDNA serially diluted 5 to 160 times. The CT values were
plotted against the logarithms of the relative concentration and the PCR efficacy was calculated from the slope of
the curve using the formula E = 10(-1/slope). All primer pairs
were functioning with high efficacy (Table 2).
The relative concentration of different MSMB transcript in
a tissue was calculated from the difference in CT, i.e. ΔCT,
between the endogenous reference, which was the mean
CT value of the primer pair generating the lowest CT at a
given template dilution, and all measured values at this
dilution. The relative transcript levels were obtained by
exponentially transforming ΔCT values to 2-ΔCT and the
mean values were calculated with one standard deviation
[19]. For comparison of MSMB expression in different tissues, ΔCT was calculated as the difference in CT between
the mean values of MSMBs and the housekeeping genes
GAPDH and CTSB. The sum of 2-ΔCT for all four MSMBs in
each tissue was calculated and then used to compute the
ratio of MSMB transcripts in testis, seminal vesicles and
prostate.

Results
Identification of 5 marmoset MSMB genes
The initial BLAT search of the common marmoset genome
database identified three contigs encompassing different
MSMB genes. Further analysis showed that the contig
denoted 1607 carried three MSMB genes in tandem
(1607:1-1607:3) and that contig 2785 also carried what

Real time PCR was done with serially diluted prostate cDNA. The
recovered CT values were plotted against the logarithms of relative
transcript concentrations and analyzed by linear regression. The PCR
efficacy (E) was calculated from the equation E = 10(-1/slope). A perfect
doubling of PCR products in each cycle yields a slope of -3.32 and an
E-value of 2.00. The relative efficacy is the observed efficacy divided

appeared to be a functional gene, whereas the gene on
contig 8721 had the features of a processed pseudogene.
By comparing the sequences of these contigs with those of
the cotton-top tamarin MSMB genes it was possible to
identify the genes on contig 1607 as MSMB4, MSMB3 and
MSMB2 and that contigs 2785 and 8721carried MSMB1
and MSMB5 respectively (Table 3). In contig 2785, we
also identified a region, located 2.7 kb upstream of
MSMB1, that is 99% similar in sequence to a piece of the
MSMB1, encompassing exon 1, 0.6 kb upstream sequence
and 2.8 kb of intron 1 sequence. This duplication is not
present upstream to MSMB1 in the cotton top tamarin,
suggesting a very recent duplication in the common marmoset.
By probing the human genome database with DNA
sequences flanking marmoset MSMB genes, it was possible to conclude that MSMB4, MSMB3, MSMB2 and
MSMB1 are all located in a genomic region that show
homology with the long arm of human chromosome 10,
whereas DNA flanking MSMB5 is homologous with the
long arm of human chromosome 8. The homology search
also showed that marmoset MSMB1 has the same position on the chromosome as the human MSMB, as
revealed by identification of the postulated genes NCOA4
and TIMM23 at approximately the same position downstream of both the human MSMB and the marmoset
MSMB1. In contrast, the genes MSMB4, MSMB3 and

The conservation of protein coding nucleotides was calculated and is expressed as percentage of conserved nucleotides. The translation initiation
codon was omitted as it is not available for the processed pseudogene MSMB5. The bold numbers indicate highest similarity between a marmoset
and a tamarin gene.

MSMB2 were assigned to a locus close to ANUBL1, which
is situated 5.8 Mb to the centromeric side of MSMB in the
human genome (Fig. 1). The MSMB4 is located 150 kb on
the telomeric side of ANUBL1 and between them is a gene
with very strong similarity to genes of the FAM21 family.
In the human genome, the homologous position is occupied by FAM21C, but the gene in the marmoset genome is
transcribed in the opposite direction to that of FAM21C in
the human genome. The marmoset MSMB4 is separated
from MSMB3 by 32 kb of intergenic DNA, and between
MSMB3 and MSMB2 there is another 20 kb of intergenic
DNA.
Molecular properties of the marmoset MSMB genes and
proteins
The four functional marmoset MSMB genes all consist of
four exons separated by three introns to yield total gene
sizes in the range of 12 kb to 14 kb (Table 4). All genes are
flanked by conserved DNA sequences that extend 14-19

kb upstream and 3-4 kb downstream to the gene, generating regions of 32 to 35 kb that encompasses an MSMB
gene with conserved flanking DNA (Table 4). The proportion of conserved nucleotides in the genes is in the range
of 91-93%. The conservation of translated nucleotides is
less, with a range of 85-91%, suggesting that the coding
nucleotides are affected by accelerated evolution (Table
5). This is also supported by the finding that 77% of the
mutated coding nucleotides generate amino acid replacements. One surprising outcome of the sequence comparisons was that the coding nucleotides of MSMB4 are more
similar to those of both MSMB2 and MSMB3 than these
two are to each other. This seems to indicate that mutations affecting MSMB3 and MSMB2 are unevenly distributed. The mutated nucleotides could be identified in the
aligned sequences, which shows that most mutations
affecting MSMB3 are located in exon 4, whereas in
MSMB2 they are located in exon 3 and the second half of
exon 2 (Fig. 2A). From this follows that mutations in

Exons, introns and conserved upstream and downstream regions in
marmoset genes were identified by homology with the human MSMB
and their sizes were calculated. Duplicated region encompasses the
gene and conserved flanking nucleotides.

MSMB3 affect the unique C-terminal domain of the
secreted protein, whereas in MSMB2 they affect the N-terminal domain, with a Greek key motif (Fig. 2B). It should
also be noted that only 12% of the mutations affect
MSMB4.
The predicted translation products from the different
MSMB genes are almost identical in molecular mass and
differ by only 0.1 kDa, despite that MSMB1 has only 93
amino acid residues: one shorter than the other proteins.
Their calculated isoelectric points vary from acidic for
MSMB1, pI 4.9, to slightly alkaline for MSMB2, pI 8.1,
with MSMB3, pI 7.2, and MSMB4, pI 6.5, located in
between.
Expression in the male genital tract
The relative expression of different MSMB transcripts in
the genital tract of male marmoset was monitored by RTPCR. The PCR primers were selected from DNA sequences
located on different exons so that products generated
from genomic DNA would also include intron and
thereby differ in size from products generated from
spliced mRNA. In a first control experiment, the specificity
of primer pairs was tested with genomic DNA. With primers complementary to DNA sequences in exon 2 and 3 the

DNA sequences were pair wise aligned using the EMBOSS program
ALIGN. The fraction conserved nucleotides were counted, omitting
gapped nucleotides. The table shows the percentage of conserved
coding nucleotides (nt) and conserved nucleotides in whole genes

expected PCR products should be around 1.0 kb. The PCR
products generated is of the expected size, as can be seen
in Fig. 3A. The specificity was also confirmed by DNA
sequencing of the products. The primers used for MSMB2
also gave rise to a second product of 160 bp that by
sequencing was identified as coming from the pseudogene MSMB5. The housekeeping genes GAPDH and CTSB
were used as references in order to enable comparison of
transcript levels in different tissues. As can be seen, the
priming on the transcripts of the housekeeping genes is
very specific, yielding a single PCR product with each
primer pair. The similar staining intensity also indicates
that the cDNA was synthesized from approximately the
same quantity of mRNA (Fig. 3B).
The relative expression of different MSMB genes in the
male genital tract was analyzed by RT-PCR with two different sets of primers. The first set, priming in exon 2 and 3,
should yield products of 140 to 160 bp and the second
primer set, based on sequences in exon 3 and 4, should
generate products that are between 144 and 196 bp. RNA
samples were treated with DNase prior to cDNA synthesis
in order to overcome the potential problem with amplification of the pseudogene MSMB5. As can be seen, the PCR
yielded products with the expected sizes for all genes in
the three tissues that were analyzed, indicating that all
four MSMB genes in the common marmoset are expressed
(Fig. 4). In the testis, primer set 2, specific for MSMB4,
also yielded unexpected larger PCR products that presumably represent alternatively spliced or not completely
processed MSMB4 transcripts. In order to monitor the relative expression of genes, the number of PCR cycles had to
be optimized for both primer pairs and tissues. The optimal number of PCR cycles was: in the prostate 25 for both
primer pairs, in the seminal vesicles 30 or 35 depending
on primer pair; and in the testis 35 for both primer pairs.
The difference in number of optimal PCR cycles suggests
that the level of MSMB transcripts is highest in the prostate, followed by the seminal vesicles and with testis having the lowest level. The relative staining intensity suggests
that MSMB3 clearly is the dominating molecular species
in both the prostate and the seminal vesicles. In the testis
the transcription seems to be more evenly distributed
between the different genes, but MSMB2 appears to be the
dominating molecular species.
Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA samples from marmoset prostate, seminal vesicle
and testis were analyzed with real time RT-PCR in order to
gather detailed information on levels of MSMB transcripts
in the male genital tract. The PCR reactions were made
with different template dilutions, equivalent to 2 to 10 ng
of total RNA. This generated CT-values in the range of 1331, where the lowest values were obtained with 10 ng of
prostate RNA and the highest with 2 ng of testis RNA. The

negative controls, i.e. samples without reverse transcriptase, were run with undiluted material equivalent to
50 ng of RNA. Around half of the controls yielded CT-values ranging from 33 to 36, but for the remainder there was
no detectable signal. The difference in CT value between 5
times diluted samples, equivalent to 10 ng of RNA, and
the matching controls was in the range of 5.8-22.6, which
suggests that there is no influence of unspecific signals
during the measurement of samples.
Virtually all transcripts in both the prostate and the seminal vesicles are derived from MSMB3, with only minor
contributions from the three other MSMBs (Table 6). In

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/96

the testis the dominating MSMB species is derived from
MSMB2, which accounts for around half of the transcripts,
while the other genes contribute between 9-29% (Table
6). The relative concentration of MSMB transcripts in the
testis, prostate and seminal vesicles was estimated by
comparing with transcripts of the housekeeping genes
GAPDH and CSTB. The latter should have fairly constant
transcript levels in all tissues and the real-time PCR
yielded CT values of 22-23 for both of them. Using
GAPDH for normalization yielded average ratios of
1:121:1.97 × 104 for the relative expression in testis, seminal vesicle and prostate. The same analyses with CSTB
yielded average ratios of 1:52:1.28 × 104.

Discussion
We have previously shown by Southern blotting that the
common marmoset and the cotton-top tamarin have the
same, or almost the same, number of MSMBs [14]. This is
now confirmed by the demonstration of 5 MSMBs in the
common marmoset that are orthologous with the 5
MSMBs in the cotton-top tamarin [15]. In addition, we
identified a unique duplication in the marmoset MSMB1,
which has created a new potential transcription initiation
site around 2.7 kb upstream of the "normal" start site.
Whether this new site is used for initiation of MSMB1
transcription or should be considered as a truncated pseudogene remains to be seen. In earlier studies on the cotton
top tamarin it was not possible to determine whether the
MSMBs, excluding the processed pseudogene MSMB5, are
situated at a single genetic locus, but from the location of
homologous regions in two of the genes it was speculated
that there probably is an MSMB located around 20 kb
downstream of MSMB3 [15]. In this study on the common marmoset it was found that there is indeed a gene
located 20 kb downstream of MSMB3, but also another
gene located 32 kb upstream. These three genes MSMB2,
MSMB3 and MSMB4 constitute a unique MSMB locus
that, according to the homology with human chromosome 10, is separated by several Mb from the MSMB locus
containing MSMB1, which is conserved in the human and
the mouse genomes. Presumably, the functional callitrichine MSMB have evolved by three rounds of duplication. The first presumably involved a duplication that
yielded MSMB1 and a precursor to the genes at the unique
second MSMB locus. We have previously shown that
MSMB3 and MSMB4 are closely related [15]. It is therefore
likely that a second duplication yielded MSMB2 and a precursor to these two genes. Finally, a third duplication
yielded MSMB3 and MSMB4.
Translated exon sequences of the marmoset MSMBs are
more dissimilar than their flanking introns, something
that was previously observed also in the cotton-top tamarin [14]. Furthermore, most mutations of translated
nucleotides also lead to amino acid replacements. This

suggests that MSMBs in the callitrichine monkeys are subjected to an accelerated evolution. Analysis of mutated
nucleotides in genes at the unique MSMB locus show that
MSMB2 has accumulated mutations in exon 3 and the terminal half of exon 2, whereas MSMB3 is mostly affected
in exon 4. This pattern of mutation overlaps with the
domain structure of MSMB, such that in MSMB2 it is the
first, Greek key, domain that is affected, whereas in
MSMB3 it is the MSMB-unique second domain that is
affected. The most reasonable interpretation of this phenomenon is that an evolutionary pressure has lead to specialization of the two genes. In contrast, the very few
mutations detected in MSMB4 suggest that this gene is not
under similar high evolutionary pressure. In fact, in an
earlier study we demonstrated that the cotton-top tamarin
MSMB4 is a pseudogene, something that could indicate
that this gene is subjected to an ongoing purifying selection [15].
The studies on the expression show that all four functional marmoset MSMB are transcribed in several different cell types in the male genital tract. However, the
MSMB concentration in the prostate, seminal vesicles and
testis is very different, as can be seen when transcript levels

are normalized with housekeeping genes. The level in the
seminal vesicles is around 1% of that in the prostate and
the level in the testis is even lower, by another two orders
of magnitude. From this it can be concluded that almost
all MSMB in seminal plasma originates from the prostate,
with only minor contribution from seminal vesicles and
testis. In the prostate, MSMB3 is clearly dominating, with
the remaining three molecular species each contributing a
few percent to the total MSMB transcript pool. A similar
situation is also found in the seminal vesicles, which are
dominated by MSMB3 and with only minor contribution
from the other MSMB genes. In a previous investigation,
we analyzed common marmoset seminal plasma with isoelectric focusing and demonstrated a predominating
molecular species of MSMB with a pI value that was estimated to 7.3 [20]. This value is very close to the theoretically calculation of 7.2 for MSMB3. Thus, the high
transcript level in the accessory sex glands is also reflected
in a high protein concentration in seminal plasma. The
isoelectric focusing also demonstrated two minor molecular species of MSMB, with pI of 6.6 and 4.9. These figures
agree with the calculated pI values of 6.5 for MSMB4 and
4.9 for MSMB1, suggesting that the transcripts of these
genes are also translated. In contrast, the isoelectric focus-

Common marmoset MSMB were subjected to real-time RT-PCR in the presence of SYBR green. Samples were measured in quadruplicate at
different RNA concentrations. Each value is based on a minimal of 8 measurements. The relative amount of transcript is given as 2-ΔCT, with the
standard deviation σ. The fraction of MSMB transcripts (given as %) in a tissue was calculated by dividing individual 2-ΔCT values with the sum of 2ΔCT values of the four MSMB in the tissue.

ing did not display any MSMB molecule that would agree
with a pI of 8.1; the calculated value of MSMB2. Whether
this is due to poor translation of the MSMB2 transcript,
instability of the translation product or other reasons, e.g.
posttranslational modification, remains to be determined.
The same predominance of MSMB3, as seen in the accessory sex glands, was not observed in the testis. Instead it
was MSMB2 that generated around half of the transcripts,
which is interesting and could suggest that MSMB3 only
display high transcript levels in the accessory sex glands,
whereas in other organs MSMB2 or one of the other gene
products are dominating. This is in line with the previous
experiments using monkey kidney COS cells, in which
only cotton-top tamarin MSMB2 displayed activity comparable with human MSMB in luciferase reporter assays
[15]. Perhaps the cell and tissue specific difference in relative expression between MSMB3 and MSMB2 is mirroring the above mentioned putative specialization with
accelerated evolution of either the Greek key domain or
the MSMB-specific domain. This very interesting aspect
could presumably be analyzed in more detail in the
future, when once the function of MSMB is known.

seminal vesicles and yields almost all beta-microseminoprotein in seminal plasma. Marmoset MSMB displays
rapid evolution, as revealed by the lower conservation of
translated nucleotides compared to introns and flanking
DNA. MSMB3 and the predominant gene in the testis,
MSMB2, have accumulated mutations that affect different
domains of beta-microseminoprotein, suggesting a specialization of these genes which might indicate different
function of MSMB in accessory sex glands as compared to
testis.

Conclusion
The common marmoset has orthologes of all MSMB, previously identified in the cotton-top tamarin, suggesting
that multiple MSMB is a property of all Callitrichine monkeys. Transcripts of MSMB1, MSMB2, MSMB3 and
MSMB4 are present in both testis and accessory sex
glands, but the level in the prostate is around 100 times
higher than in the seminal vesicles and 10,000 times
higher than in the testis. One gene, MSMB3, accounts for
more than 90% of the transcripts in the prostate and the
