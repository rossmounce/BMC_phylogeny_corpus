Abstract
The first symposium of computations in bioinformatics and bioscience (SCBB06) was held in
Hangzhou, China on June 21–22, 2006. Twenty-six peer-reviewed papers were selected for
publication in this special issue of BMC Bioinformatics. These papers cover a broad range of topics
including bioinformatics theories, algorithms, applications and tool development. The main
technical topics contain gene expression analysis, sequence analysis, genome analysis, phylogenetic
analysis, gene function prediction, molecular interaction and system biology, genetics and
population study, immune strategy, protein structure prediction and proteomics.

Introduction
This BMC Bioinformatics supplement consists of 26
papers peer-reviewed and selected from the First Symposium of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
(SCBB) in conjunction with the International Multi-Symposiums on Computer and Computational Sciences
(IMSCCS|06) held in Zhejiang University, Hangzhou,
China on June 21–22, 2006. A total of 230 conference
participants, including research scientists, faculty, and
graduate students with different disciplines and backgrounds in both academia and industry, attended the conference. This symposium was designed to report the
progress of bioinformatics and computational biology
from the recent work presented by the authors, as well as
to bring together computational biology and bioinformatics researchers to discuss fundamental methods, algo-

rithms, and research software for analyzing biological
data; thus, to establish future collaborations. The authors,
coming from 7 countries and 36 research institutions all
over the world, contributed their work to this special
issue.

Process of submission and reviews
We received submissions both from the presenters at the
symposium and from non-presenters. Submitted manuscripts were intensively reviewed by at least two referees.
The quality of each paper was evaluated based on the contribution to computational biology and bioinformatics.
Technical novelty and expression rigor in the methodology was required. The accepted papers in the specific issue
covered a broad range of subject areas and can be mainly
divided into the following categories:

Gene expression analysis
Most papers regarding gene expression analysis focused
on microarray data analysis. 9 papers in the proceedings
mainly address micorarray experiments, data analysis and
tool development, which indicates that microarray data
analysis is still the hottest topic in bioinformatics and
computational biology. Perkins et al [1] presented their
work of comparing the gene expression difference
between primary heptocyte cell culture and liver tissue
after exposure to hexahydro-1, 3, 5-trinitro-1, 3, 5-triazine, which is a toxic chemical that contaminates soil
and ground water, which affects human and animal
health. The microarray data analysis was performed using
JMP Genomics from SAS Institute Inc. (Cary, NC. http://
www.jmp.com) and ArrayTrack (http://www.fda.gov/
nctr/science/centers/toxicoinformatics/ArrayTrack) and
EASE [2]. They found that the absolute common differentially expressed gene list between primary heptocyte cell
culture and liver tissue is not so high, but if the KEGG
pathway functional category is considered, the overlapped
common functional gene list is much greater. Their results
suggest that we need to take care of the extrapolating
effects from in vitro and in vivo models.

Because microarray experiments are expensive, it is important to determine an appropriate sample number for a
micorarray experiment. Wu and his colleagues [3] have
developed a method to determine the minimum microarray samples such as the minimum time points for the micorarray researchers. Their basic idea is to use hierarchical
clustering to obtain the gene expression patterns in a
microarray experiment. Using time series data as examples, they found that gene expression patterns could be
"saturated" at a certain time point, and more time points
will not furhter contribute to pattern discrimination so
they are unnecessary.
Two presenters focused on the methods of identifying differentially-expressed genes. Yang et al [4] investigated the
effect of sample imbalance on differentially-expressed
gene identification. When we try to find the differentiated
gene list between two conditions such as control and
treatment, it often happens that the sample number of
two conditions might not be equal. Under these circumstances, choosing a right method to identify differentiallyexpressed genes is critical. By using two evaluation models, they compared 6 popular methods to select differentially expressed genes in two real datasets and one
simulated data, and found that different methods turned
out different results in these unbalanced data. So they suggested that care should be taken in choosing the right
method for identifying-differentially expressed genes on
specific unbalanced data. Based on their fuzzy set theory,
Liang et al [5] developed a new approach called fuzzy
membership test (FM-test) to identify differentially-

expressed genes. They assign FM- d-value to the genes that
can distinguish two conditions. They applied their methods to both diabetes and lung cancer microarray data and
found some existing genes for diabetes and lung cancer, as
well as some new genes related to diabetes or lung cancer,
indicating that their method is effective.
There were two papers that concentrated on the validation
of clustering algorithms for gene expression data. Yin et al.
[6] compared the runtime performance of three major
clustering algorithms: Hierarchical Clustering, SelfOrganizing Map (SOM) and Self Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA) using yeast microarray dataset, they found
that SOTA is the most efficient algorithm, followed by
SOM, and Hierarchical algorithm is the slowest one. They
recommend using SOTA because it has the advantages of
both SOM and hierarchical clustering algorithms. Meanwhile, they presented a novel data mining tool, called
"Cluster Diff", for similarity analysis of clusters. Datta and
Datta [7] compared six popular clustering algorithms
including UPGMA, K-Means, Diana, Fanny, Model-Based
and SOM using both SAGE and cDNA microarray data.
Judging by both the statistical and the biological functional consistency of the clusters, they found that overall
UPGMA is a good performer, but they thought the absolute winner may not be clear in the resulting data. They
suggested that choosing a right clustering algorithm for
specific dataset and their validation method is very promising.
A recent report [8] showed that the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) algorithm runs better than many other
classification algorithms, but it is extremely time-consuming for analyzing large microarray datasets. Zhang et al [9]
report an innovative tool called Parallel Multicategory
Support Vector Machine (PMC-SVM) based on the
sequential minimum optimization-type decomposition
method for support vector machine (SMO-SVM). Tested
on four large microarray datasets, they found that PMCSVM was found to drastically improve the performing efficiency without losing any accuracy, in contrast to the
serial SVM algorithm.
Guoqing Lu et al [10] developed a data mining tool called
AffyMiner, for specifically mining Affymetrix microarray
data. It can be used to identify differentially-expressed
genes, perform clustering, and classify interesting gene
function according to Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway
analysis. Classifying microarray data (such as a cancer
microarray data to distinguish multiple classes corresponding to different subtypes of a specific cancer) is
important. It can be used for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Since SVM is a very good algorithm for microarray
data classification, it is very useful to create a graphical
user interface (GUI) for use of SVM for data analysis.

Pirooznia and Deng [11] have developed a user-friendly
Java GUI application allowing users to perform SVM training, classification and prediction. They demonstrated that
their software can accurately classify genes into functional
categories based upon expression data from DNA microarray experiments. The software provides various kernel
functions for users to choose the best way for classifying
their data, and it is freely available at http://
mfgn.usm.edu/ebl/svm/.

ods. Hydrophobin proteins are fungal proteins that have
been used to make paints. Yang et al [16] define common
new motif patterns for hydrophobin protein family. Based
on the newly identified patterns and the existing pattern
of the protein family, they find 9 new hydrophobin proteins that have not yet been named as hydrophobins,
which provides new sources for potential industrial applications.

Biological function analysis
Sequence analysis
Shortest common supersequences (SCS)
There were five papers studying sequence analysis. As an
important transcription binding site, TATA is an old topic.
However, Shi and Zhou [12] made some new findings on
the frequency distribution of TATA Box and its extension
sequences on human promoters. Based on their extensive
statistical analysis, they divided 16 TATA elements into 3
distribution patterns. Interestingly, they found that 14
TATA extension sequences were new TATA Box elements.
Mao and Zheng [13] proposed a new approach to find
common human transcription factor binding motifs in
the upstream regions of co-regulated genes resulted from
gene expression experiments. They employed comparative genomics as well as de novo motif finding strategy to
identify common motifs. The method turned out to be
better than existing methods. Ning and Leong [28]
reported a novel heuristic algorithm, the Deposition and
Reduction algorithm, for detecting the shortest common
supersequences (SCS). They prove that their algorithm
runs better than or is comparative to the existing popular
used algorithms, especially when more long sequences are
used to locate SCS.
Longest common sequence (LCS)
Computation for finding the longest common sequence
(LCS) of multiple biosequences is the fundamental task
and challenge due to intensive computation. To speedup
the computation has significance in bioinformatics. Chen
et al [26] developed a parallel algorithm for finding LCS.
In their algorithm, an effective pruning technique is
deployed which can significantly reduce the computational complexity. The algorithm is implemented using a
message passing interface, a parallel library to parallelize
the program. The experimental results on gene sequences
in the tigr database show the parallel algorithm is optimal
and highly efficienct.

Two papers dealt with protein sequence families. Chen et
al [15] proposed a new method to cluster protein
sequences. They named this new method as SEQOPTICS
(sequence clustering with OPTICS), which is based on the
approach OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identifying the
Clustering Structure). They demonstrated that their
method performs better than well known existing meth-

It is important to understand the functionalities of biological structures. Such efforts can be transformed to a process of finding a maximum common subgraph (MCS)
graphically between two different biological structures. In
this domain people utilize parameterized computation in
the MCS study. Huang et al [27] derived a new lower
bound for the exact algorithms of the maximum common
induced subgraph. The authors also investigated the
upper bound effects.

Genome analysis
Lu et al [17] developed a user friendly web tool, GenomeBlast to compare small genomes. This tool can be used to
identify homologous and unique genes among compared
genomes, as well as to view genome distribution graphically and construct genome phylogenetic trees. The web
server is available to any users.

Phylogenetic analysis
Based on the ant-colony algorithm, Qin et al [18] propose
an innovative approach to construct phylogenetic tree.
This is a distanced based method. They improved the antcolony algorithm by developing an adaptive heuristic
clustering algorithm. They demonstrate that their adaptive algorithm is better than Genetic Algorithm (GA) for
constructing phylogenetic tree. This new method provides
an alternative approach for finding DNA, protein relationship based on phylogenectic tree.

Gene function prediction
Although the genomes of many organisms have been
sequenced, the gene function is largely unknown. Li et al
[19] presented a new approach, Fuzzy Nearest Clusters to
predict the function of unclassified genes based on microarray data. They assume that the genes in the same cluster
or subgroup should have similar functions, and assign the
function of the unclassified genes to the function of genes
whose function is known in the same cluster of subgroup.
Because they use the fuzzy strategy, the approach holds an
advantage that it can predict multiple roles for an unclassified gene.
Duan et al [20] surveyed the relationship between protein
sequence similarity and their Gene Ontology (GO) function terms. They found that protein sequences that have

GO functions tend to have sequence similarity. But they
also suggested more evidence should be considered to
accurately predict a gene function besides sequence similarity.
Stepanova et al [25] developed a method which can be
used for the prediction of hormone-response elements
(HRE) de novo. This method can handle large groups of
transcription factor binding sites. Their model has been
proved by their experimental results.

Molecular interaction and system biology
Azuma et al [27] focused on molecular-level dynamics to
affect molecular properties at the cellular level. Based on a
particle model, they designed an algorithm to simulate
the chemical reaction-diffusion dynamics of molecules.
They evaluated their simulation algorithm in a reversible
enzyme reaction model and demonstrated its efficiency.
This algorithm provides a quantitative way to model the
molecule interaction dynamics and it is very useful for
understanding the mechanism of molecular interaction as
well as cellular signaling and metabolism.

Genetics and population study
Zhang et al [22] proposed a two-stage approach to identify haplotype frequencies in pedigrees. The two stages
include the haplotyping stage and the estimation stage.
They demonstrated that their new method performs faster
and more accurately than other existing well known software.

Structure prediction
The Chou-Fasman's method is a famous method to predict protein secondary structure. Hang Chen et al [23] proposed a new version of Chou-Fasman's method by
significantly improving its performance from three
aspects, which include changing the values in the nuclear
regions, using new secondary structure parameters and
modifying Chou-Fasman rules. It turns out that their
improved method performs much better than the original
Chou-Fasman's method and is comparable to other well
known methods.

Biological immune system
For the immune system of an organism, there exits artificial intelligent technology such as dealing with immune
selection, memory storage, immune metabolism, and
density control. Qin et al [24] proposed an adaptive ant
colony algorithm that simulates the behavior of biological
immune system. The solutions to NP-hard problems are
much more diversified, so that the stagnation and premature phenomena in such biological system can be
avoided.
