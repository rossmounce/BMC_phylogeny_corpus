Abstract
Background: The third variable loop (V3) of the HIV-1 gp120 surface protein is a major determinant of cellular coreceptor binding. However, HIV-1 can also modulate its tropism through other regions in gp120, such as V1, V2
and C4 regions, as well as in the gp41 protein. Moreover, specific changes in gp41 are likely to be responsible for
of damage in gp120-CCR5 interactions, resulting in potential resistance to CCR5 inhibitors.
In order to genetically characterize the two envelope viral proteins in terms of co-receptor usage, we have
analyzed 526 full-length env sequences derived from HIV-1 subtype-B infected individuals, from our and public (Los
Alamos) databases. The co-receptor usage was predicted by the analysis of V3 sequences using Geno2Pheno (G2P)
algorithm. The binomial correlation phi coefficient was used to assess covariation among gp120V3 and gp41
mutations; subsequently the average linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed.
Results: According to G2P false positive rate (FPR) values, among 526 env-sequences analyzed, we further
characterized 196 sequences: 105 with FPR <5% and 91 with FPR >70%, for X4-using and R5-using viruses,
respectively.
Beyond the classical signatures at 11/25 V3 positions (S11S and E25D, R5-tropic viruses; S11KR and E25KRQ, X4tropic viruses), other specific V3 and gp41 mutations were found statistically associated with the co-receptor usage.
Almost all of these specific gp41 positions are exposed on the surface of the glycoprotein. By the covariation
analysis, we found several statistically significant associations between V3 and gp41 mutations, especially in the
context of CXCR4 viruses. The topology of the dendrogram showed the existence of a cluster associated with R5usage involving E25DV3, S11SV3, T22AV3, S129DQgp41 and A96Ngp41 signatures (bootstrap = 0.88). Conversely, a large
cluster was found associated with X4-usage involving T8IV3, S11KRV3, F20IVYV3, G24EKRV3, E25KRV3, Q32KRV3,
A30Tgp41, A189Sgp41, N195Kgp41 and L210Pgp41 mutations (bootstrap = 0.84).
Conclusions: Our results show that gp120V3 and several specific amino acid changes in gp41 are associated
together with CXCR4 and/or CCR5 usage. These findings implement previous observations that determinants of
tropism may reside outside the V3-loop, even in the gp41. Further studies will be needed to confirm the degree to
which these gp41 mutations contribute directly to co-receptor use.

Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry
into the host cell is mediated by the viral mature envelope (env) glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, that constitute
a trimeric complex anchored on the virion surface by the
membrane-spanning segments of gp41 [1-4]. The gp120
exterior glycoprotein is retained on the trimer via labile,
noncovalent interactions with the gp41 ectodomain [5],
and it must be flexible to allow correct conformational
modifications. The initial binding of gp120 to the cellular
CD4 receptor indeed triggers conformational changes in
gp120 that promote its following interaction with one of
the chemokine co-receptors, usually CCR5 or CXCR4
[6-13]. This binding also induces the arrest of the transmembrane gp41 transitions at a prehairpin intermediate
stage that leads to the insertion of the fusion peptide into
the target cell membrane and ultimately to virus-cell
fusion activity [14,15]. Multiple intermolecular contacts
are required to maintain trimer integrity in gp120: the C1
and C5 region in gp120 are thought to be a provider to
the gp120/gp41 interface and to the disulfide bond loop
region of gp41, respectively [5,16-18].
HIV-1 strains can be phenotypically classified according
to the virus’ ability to use the CCR5 and/or CXCR4 coreceptor. Pure R5-tropic and pure X4-tropic viruses can
use only the CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors to enter the
target cell respectively, while the dual-tropic virus can use
both co-receptors [19-23]. The binding to the chemokine
receptor is based upon the presence of selected amino
acids in gp120 (specifically within the V3 loop, but also in
other regions), providing greater affinity to CCR5 or
CXCR4, and therefore the viral tropism [24-32].
It has been shown that R5-tropic viruses are generally
responsible for the establishment of the initial infection,
and they predominate in the majority of drug-naïve
patients (prevalence, > 80%) [33-36]. However, in
roughly 50% of all infected individuals, the virus changes
its chemokine receptor usage during the progression of
HIV-1 infection, due to the appearance of dual/mixed
viruses [37-44]. Conversely, pure X4-tropic viruses are
rare and occur in less than 1% of treatment-naïve
patients and less than 5% of treated individuals, even at
very late stages of the disease [33-36,45].
Based on the V3 location of the main genetic coreceptor usage determinants, the genotypic approaches
for the tropism determination are so far based on
sequencing and analyzing the V3 loop of gp120 with different algorithms available online [46,47].
However, emerging data clearly indicate the involvement of other gp120 regions in co-receptor binding,
beyond the V3 loop (as V1, V2, and C4), and even that
of the gp41 transmembrane protein [48-55]. Interestingly, recent studies have also shown that several muta-

Page 2 of 11

tions in gp41 were found to be significantly associated
with co-receptor usage [48,54,56,57].
Therefore, due to the above mentioned reasons, the
present investigation aims to genetically characterize
HIV-1 B-subtype env sequences in terms of co-receptor
usage and to define the association of mutations within
the gp120 V3-region and the gp41 protein according to
CCR5 and/or CXCR4 usage. For this purpose, we analyzed 526 HIV-1 subtype-B env sequences, only viral isolates from single patient, mostly retrieved from the Los
Alamos database.

Methods
Sequence analysis

The analysis included 526 HIV-1 subtype-B env fulllength sequences, partially retrieved from our database
(from 33 HIV-positive patients receiving highly active
antiretroviral therapy), and the majority from the Los
Alamos database [58]from 493 infected individuals at all
stages of infection, with one isolate per single patient
[58]. Sequences available with pure phenotype and/or
co-receptor determinations have been considered, while
molecular clone and dual-mix viruses have not been
used. Published env consensus sequences of pure HIV-1
(A, B, C, D, F1, F2, G, H, J, and K) were used as reference for each subtypes [58], and multiple sequence
alignments of V3 and gp41 segments were performed by
using ClustalX [59] and were manually edited with the
Bioedit software [60].
V3 and gp41 sequencing

The sequencing of the V3 gp120 region and the entire
gp41 was performed on 33 plasma samples, as described
elsewhere [61,62]. In brief, for gp41 sequencing, RNA
was extracted, retrotranscribed, and amplified by use of
2 different sequence-specific primers. Gp41-amplified
products were full-length sequenced in sense and antisense orientations by use of 8 different overlapping
sequence specific primers for an automated sequencer
(ABI 3100; Applied Biosystems). Sequences with a mixture of wild-type and mutant residues at single positions
were determined to have the mutant(s) at that position.
Nucleotide sequences were previously submitted to
Genbank [63].
For the sequencing of gp120 V3-domain, HIV-1 RNA
was extracted, the V3-containing region of the env gene
was then reverse-transcribed and amplified using the
forward primer V3S2 5’ CAGCACAGTACAATGTACACA 3’ (nucleotide [nt]: 630-650 of HIV-1 HxB2
gp120 env gene) and the reverse primer V3AS5 5’
CTTCTCCAATTGTCCCTCA 3’ (nt: 1292-1310). The
conditions for reverse transcription and amplification
were: one cycle at 50°C for 30 min, one cycle 94°C for

Dimonte et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:33
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/33

2 min, 40 cycles (94°C 30 s, 52°C 30 s, 72°C 40 s), and a
final step at 72°C for 10 min, using the following reaction mix: 25 μl of RNA template, 8 μl of 5 mM Mg++,
3 μl of Dnase Rnase free water, 0.75 μl of each primer
at a concentration of 10 μM, 1 μl of Rnase out (40 U/μl),
1.5 μl of RT/Taq, 1 μl of dNTPs at a concentration of
10 mM for a total of 40 μl.
PCR-products were then sequenced by using the BigDye
terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied-Biosystems), and an automated sequencer (ABI-3100). Four different overlapping sequence-specific primers were used to
ensure the coverage of the V3-sequence by at least two
sequence segments. The sequencing conditions were: one
cycle 96°C 3 min, 25 cycles (96°C 30 s, 50°C 10 s, 60°C 4
min) and the following primers were used: V3S6 5’
CTGTTAAATGGCAGTCTAGC 3’, V3S5 5’ GTTAAA
TGGCAGTCTAGCAG 3’, V3AS1 5’ GAAAAATTCC
CCTCCACAATT 3’ and V3AS3bis 5’ CAATTTCTGGG
TCCCCTC 3’.
Subtypes were assessed by the construction of phylogenetic trees generated with the Kimura 2-parameter
model. The statistical robustness within each phylogenetic tree was confirmed with a bootstrap analysis using
1000 replicates.
Tropism prediction

Within all 526 gp160-sequences, the V3 region was extrapolated and submitted for tropism prediction to Geno2Pheno algorithm. Geno2Pheno [46] is a bioinformatics
tool based on support vector machines. Beyond tropism
prediction, it assigns to each V3 sequence a score, called
false positive rate (FPR), ranging from 0% to 100%, which
represents the probability for a sequence to belong to an
R5-virus. According to FPR values, we selected sequences
with FPR < 5% (indicating a strong X4 prediction) and
sequences with FPR > 70% (indicating a strong R5 prediction) for X4-tropic and R5-tropic viruses, respectively.
These sequences, together with the related gp41sequences,
were then used for the entire study.
Statistical analysis

To analyze gp41 and V3 mutations, we calculated the frequency of all mutations in the 345 gp41 amino acids and
35 V3 amino acids, using the env selected sequences.
Fisher exact tests were used to determine whether the
differences in frequency between the 2 groups of patients
were statistically significant (sequences with strong R5
and X4 prediction, respectively).
The Benjamini-Hochberg method has been used to
identify results that were statistically significant in the presence of multiple-hypothesis testing [64]. A false discovery
rate of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
To identify significant patterns of pairwise associations
between V3 and gp41 mutations, we calculated the 

Page 3 of 11

coefficient and its statistical significance for each pair of
mutations. A positive and statistically significant correlation between mutations at two specific positions (0 < <
1; P ≤ 0.05) indicates that the latter mutates in a correlated manner in order to confer an advantage in terms
of co-receptor selection and that the co-occurrence of
these mutations is not due to chance. Moreover, to analyze the covariation structure of mutations in more
detail, we performed average linkage hierarchical
agglomerative clustering, as described elsewhere [63,65].
Mann-Whitney U tests have been used to assess statistically significant differences among all the pairwise mutations associated. Statistical tests have been corrected for
multiple-hypothesis testing by using the BenjaminiHochberg method at a false discovery rate of 0.05 [64].

Results and Discussion
Prevalence of mutations

The study included 526 HIV-1 subtype-B env sequences,
with the majority retrieved from the Los Alamos database. The V3 region was extrapolated from these gp160sequences and submitted to the Geno2Pheno algorithm
for tropism prediction.
Based on the FPR values, we selected 105 V3
sequences with FPR < 5% and 91 sequences with FPR >
70%, for their X4-using and R5-using co-receptor,
respectively. These 196 sequences, together with the
related gp41sequences, were then used for the rest of
the study.
As a first analysis, we confirmed in our dataset that
the classical V3 positions 11 and 25 (consistent with
previous observations [66-68]), wild-type amino acid at
position 11, S11S, and E25D mutation were significantly
associated with R5-tropic viruses, while mutations
S11KR and E25KRQ were significantly associated with
CXCR4 co-receptor usage (Figure 1a).
Since networks of V3 mutations are variable and complex, positions 11 and 25 are not sufficient to provide a
full understanding of the mechanisms underlying different co-receptor usage. For example, it has been demonstrated that CCR5 interacts with the conserved V3
region encompassing the residues 4 to 7 (P4-N5-N6-N7)
and the binding of this co-receptor is blocked when N7
is replaced by charged amino acid [30]. In our dataset,
the mutation N7K has been found only in X4-predicted
viruses (prevalence 9.5%; P = 0.002) (Figure 1a).
By evaluating the V3 loop sequence, we have identified 9 V3 mutations whose prevalence was significantly
higher in the R5-predicted viruses than in the X4-predicted viruses (P < 0.05) (Figure 1a). Seven of them had
a prevalence > 10% in R5-predicted viruses (the known
E25D, and H13P, G15A, R18Q, F20L, Y21F and T22A).
We also identified 33 mutations whose prevalence was
significantly higher in X4- than in R5-viruses, suggesting

their association with CXCR4-usage (P < 0.05). Among
them, 17 had a prevalence > 10% in X4-predicted
viruses (the known S11KR and E25KRQ, and I12V,
H13ST, A19V, F20VY, Y21H, I27TV, Q32KR, H34Y),
suggesting that within the V3 region, many more mutations are associated with CXCR4 usage (Figure 1a).

Interestingly, the majority of these V3 mutations
found associated with the co-receptor usage were also
recently found by our group as being involved in
mechanisms underlying different co-receptor usage,
using a completely different approach and dataset of isolates [68].

In addition, it is important to note that the selected
dataset of sequences used in this study is small compared to the total number of sequences available in the
Los Alamos database; we also analyzed a different dataset of sequences with known phenotyping determination, composed by 326 and 91 V3-sequences (one HIV1 B-subtype sequence/patient), with non-syncytiuminducing (NSI)- and syncytium-inducing (SI)-information, respectively.
Almost all statistically significant associations among
V3 mutations and tropism found previously in the study
were confirmed with this new analysis. The classical R5tropic determinants S11S and E25D were found with
high prevalence in NSI-sequences (73.6% and 64.1%,
respectively, versus 34% and 11%, respectively, in SIsequences; P < 0.05), while the classical X4-tropic mutations S11KR and E25KRQ were found with high prevalence in SI-sequences (40.6% and 51.6%, respectively,
versus 2% and 11%, respectively, in NSI-sequences; P <
0.05). Moreover, the novel identified V3 mutations
T22A in the R5-predicted viruses, and I12V, A19V,
Y21H and H34Y in the X4-predicted viruses were also
confirmed (P < 0.05).
The high variability of the V3 loop found in our study
should not be surprising, since positive selection has
been implicated in the maintenance of such diversity, in
individuals as well as at the population level and in coreceptor selection [68-72]. It is likely that the principal
driving force in the evolution of the V3 region of HIV-1
is the cell receptor usage, the escape from host immune
response, or a combination of the two [73,74].
By analyzing the gp41 sequences, we found 35 out of
345 gp41 positions significantly associated with different
co-receptor usage (P < 0.05) (Figure 1b). In particular,
we identified 13 gp41 mutations whose prevalence was
significantly higher in R5-using than in X4-using viruses:
7 of them had a prevalence > 10% in R5-predicted
viruses (A69N, E110K, S129D, R209L, F241L, V267A,
and I270T). Beyond these mutations, the wild type
amino acid at 13 gp41 positions were also significantly
associated with the R5-prediction (Q52Q, N126N,
L134L, Q142Q, D153D, L181L, V190V, F206F, A212A,
R250R, E280E, N287N and G314G) (Figure 1b).
Conversely, we identified 13 mutations whose prevalence was significantly higher in X4- than in R5-viruses,
suggesting their association with the CXCR4-usage.
Among them, 5 mutations had a prevalence > 10% in
X4-predicted viruses (V69I, A96T, S129N, D163N and
A189S) (Figure 1b).
Several gp41 residues associated with different coreceptor-usage reside within the Heptad Repeat 1 and 2
(HR1 and HR2) (A30, L34, Q52, D125, N126, S129,
L134, N140, N141 and Q142), in the cluster I epitope
transiently exposed during fusion (V69), and in the

tryptophan-rich membrane-proximal external region
(MPER) (D153 and D163). All these positions are localized in gp41 ectodomain known to be immunodominant and to induce high-titer antibodies in the majority
of HIV-1-infected individuals [75-81]. The fact that all
these mutations are localized in the extracellular domain
of gp41 is consistent with the idea that gp41 may act as
a scaffold in order to maintain the stability of the
gp120/gp41 complex, and therefore finally influencing
the viral tropism as well, directly or indirectly.
Association among mutations

By the analysis of associations between mutations, for
the first time we found specific and statistically-significant correlations between V3 and gp41 mutations. In
particular, several associations among mutations were
associated with the CXCR4 prediction. An exception
was represented by the A96N gp41 mutation that was
positively correlated with T22AV3 ( = 0.22; P = 0.030;
both associated with CCR5-usage) and negatively correlated with the known S11KR mutations ( = -0.17; P =
0.018). The A96Ngp41 mutation is specifically localized
in gp41 ectodomain and in particular within the clusterI, that is a gp41 immunodominant loop involved in the
interactions with gp120 [16,18,82-85].
Similarly, S129DQ gp41 , associated with CCR5-usage
and localized in the gp41 HR2 domain, established negative correlation with the S11KR, strongly associated with
CXCR4-usage, ( = -0.21; P = 0.041) (Table 1). Notably,
antibodies directed to the HR1/HR2 complex exist in the
sera of HIV-1-infected individuals and this highlights the
immunogenic character of the complex [75,86,87].
Regarding the positive correlations between V3 and
gp41 mutations associated with CXCR4-usage, several
were localized in the gp41 ectodomain (Table 1). In particular, a strong correlation was observed for A30Tgp41with
either F20IVYV3 ( = 0.38; P = 0.001) or E25KRQV3 ( =
0.29; P = 0.006) (Table 1). Of note, F20IVY V3 and
E25KRQV3 were found in 80% and 90% of patients with
A30Tgp41 respectively, thus further supporting that these
mutations are highly correlated with each other. Another
positive correlation was observed for L34M gp41 with
N7KTYV3 (Table 1).
Interestingly, both A30Tgp41 and L34Mgp41 were also
found recently associated phenotypically with CXCR4
usage [54,56,57]. Specifically, evaluating the available
gp41 sequence data from samples submitted for coreceptor tropism testing by Trofile™, a CLIA-validated
cell-based recombinant virus assay, Stawiski et colleagues
have observed 26 gp41 mutations associated with
CXCR4-use (Dual Mix/CXCR4), with the majority being
on the extracellular region [56].
A30T gp41 and L34M gp41 are located in a specific
region of HR1 involved in a direct interaction with

gp120 [88]. In addition, the presence of A30Tgp41 and
L34Mgp41 was observed in CXCR4-using isolates characterized by a high infectivity and/or replication capacity
in CXCR4-expressing cells, thus supporting their involvement in the mechanism underlying CXCR4 usage
[56,89,90]. Overall, this supports the role of these two
mutations in the stabilization of non-covalently complex
gp120/gp41, and/or in viral receptor attachment and
membrane fusion.
Of note, we also found positive correlations between
V3 mutations and gp41 mutations localized in the transmembrane domain or in the cytoplasmic tail of gp41.
This is the case of A189Sgp41, localized in gp41 transmembrane domain, which correlated with Q32KRV3 (
= 0.27; P = 0.021). Both mutations were found positively
associated with the CXCR4 prediction. Moreover, it has
already been noted that Q32KR V3 could determine a
reduction of gp120 binding affinity for the CCR5 N-terminus, and this reduction is even stronger than that
observed when positive charges are present at the classical V3 positions 11 and 25 [68].
Similarly, L210P gp41 , localized before the Kennedy
sequence (that is a loop of the C-terminal tail of gp41
which is supposed to be exposed on the viral surface
[91]), showed a strong correlation with G24EKRV3 ( =
0.31; P = 0.019).

The correlation between V3 and gp41 mutations was
also confirmed by hierarchical clustering analysis. In
particular, the topology of the dendrogram suggests the
existence of a cluster associated with R5-usage and
involving S11S, E25D, and T22A in the V3 and A96N
and S129DQ in gp41 (bootstrap = 0.88) (Figure 2). Conversely, a large cluster was found associated with X4usage. This involves the V3 mutations T8I, S11KR,
F20IVY, G24EKR, E25KQR, Q32KR along with the gp41
mutations A30T, A189S, N195K, L210P (bootstrap =
0.84) (Figure 2).
Overall, our results suggest that specific additional
gp41 mutations could be taken into account in order to
implement the genotypic prediction algorithms currently
in common use, as already demonstrated by Thielen
and colleagues, who observed an improvement (albeit
marginal) of CXCR4 co-receptor usage prediction [57].
In this work, it has been shown that mutations at N-terminus of gp41, such as A30T and L34M, are strongly
associated with co-receptor phenotype in two independent datasets (444 and 1916 patients screened, respectively). The authors affirm that this region could
theoretically be used to predict co-receptor use, alone or
in combination with the V3 region. In our study, these
2 mutations, A30T and L34M, were both 100% associated to CXCR4-tropic viruses (Table 1).

Figure 2 Clusters of correlated mutations. Dendrogram obtained from average linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering, showing
significant clusters involving V3 and gp41 (gray box) mutations. The length of branches reflects distances between mutations in the original
distance matrix. Boostrap values, indicating the significance of clusters, are reported in the boxes. The analysis was performed in sequences
derived from 196 patients, 91 reported as R5-tropic and 105 reported as X4-tropic at genotypic test.

It is conceivable that even mutations in gp41 may
modulate co-receptor specificity and facilitate efficient
CXCR4-mediated entry. This is consistent with other
observations that showed that determinants of CXCR4
use in a set of dual-tropic env sequences, with V3
sequences identical to those of R5-tropic clones, mapped
to the gp41 glycoprotein. Indeed, Huang et colleagues
have shown that mutations in the fusion peptide and
cytoplasmic tail of gp41 contribute to CXCR4 use by a
dual-tropic clone, while a single G515V mutation

(according to HXB2 gp140 numbering) in gp41-fusionpeptide of another dual-tropic clone was sufficient to
confer CXCR4 use to the R5-tropic original clone [48].
Similarly, the same authors reported previously that for
HIV-1 subtype-D the V3 loop sequence of dual-tropic
clones was identical to those of co-circulating R5-tropic
clones, indicating the presence of CXCR4 tropism determinants also in domains different from V3 [41]. Interestingly, the threonine in position 96 that we find
mutated in 72.5% of our viral X4-tropic B-subtype

Dimonte et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:33
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/33

sequences (A96Tgp41) and negatively correlated with the
R5-determinant T22AV3, is the wild-type amino acid of
gp41 in HIV-1 consensus sequence of subtype D viruses.
Based on crystal structures of HIV-1 gp41 so far available [92-95], the positions A30, L34, A96, S129 and
N140 are all exposed on the surface of the glycoprotein
(in HR1 or HR2 domains). Similarly, position L210 too,
being near the epitopes for neutralizing antibodies, is
presumably exposed on the surface glycoprotein [91].
Differently, the position of gp41 N195 seems to be
located at the end of the classical single membrane
spanning domain (172-198 amino acids), recently proposed to shuttle between two different conformations
during the fusion process [96]. The same residue, based
on another work [91], is part of an external loop of
gp41 in an alternative membrane-spanning model, suggesting its alternating intra- and extra-membrane
localization.
Consequently, we could speculate that gp41 A30T,
L34M, A96NT, S129DQN, N140IT, N195K and L210P
mutations may act together (directly or indirectly) with
specific V3 signatures, via allosteric effects on the
gp120/gp41 complex. This may allow the best conformational structural plasticity of gp41 and gp120 for
their appropriate and specific binding to the cellular
receptors and co-receptors. To support this hypothesis,
the x-ray crystal structures of CD4-bound HIV-1 gp120
have revealed that the gp120 “core” consists of a gp41interactive inner domain, a surface-exposed and heavily
glycosylated outer domain and a conformationally flexible bridging sheet [14,30,97]. In addition, recent studies
showed that in CD4-bound state two potentially flexible
topological layers in the gp120 inner domain apparently
contribute to the noncovalent association of gp120 with
gp41 [98] and insertions in V3 or polar substitutions in
a conserved hydrophobic patch near the V3 of gp120
resulting in decreased gp120/gp41 association and
decreased chemokine receptor binding [99].
With regard to the gp120-CD4 binding, it was found
that the resulting conformational modifications protrude
the V3 flexible loop to interact with the cellular coreceptor [29,97]. Interestingly, monoclonal antibodies
directed against the D19 epitope within the V3 region
had a neutralizing function only for the X4-tropic
viruses, regardless of the presence of sCD4, while for R5
isolates only upon addition of sCD4 [100]. Consequently, the inaccessibility of this antibody to R5-tropic
viruses in the absence of sCD4 might indicate that there
are significant V3 loop conformational differences
between these two viral variants [101], but also that specific interactions occurring in the gp120/gp41 complex
may participate in the HIV-1 co-receptor usage and
neutralization sensitivity.

Page 8 of 11

Finally, we should mention that Anastassopoulou et
colleagues have shown that viruses resistant to the small
molecule CCR5 inhibitor, vicriviroc, can be caused by 3
conservative changes in the fusion peptide of HIV-1
gp41 [102], and similarly Pfaff et al., very recently,
found the involvement of gp120 and gp41 mutations in
modulating the magnitude of drug resistance to another
small CCR5 antagonist, aplaviroc [103]. Overall, these
studies, which focus on changes toward resistances without assessing the issue of tropism-switch, are complementary to our results.

Conclusions
In this study, we found that specific gp41 mutations are
significantly associated with different co-receptor usage
and with specific V3 mutations, thus providing new
information that could be taken into account for
improving co-receptor usage prediction. These findings
implement previous observations that determinants of
tropism may reside outside the V3 loop, even in the
gp41 transmembrane protein. It is possible that the
gp120/gp41 complex may become structurally or functionally involved at different stages during virus-cell
entry and fusion. Probably, the associations among V3
and gp41 mutations may also have an impact on the
HIV pathogenesis, it is known that CXCR4 phenotype
has been associated with progression and increased
severity of HIV disease, and several gp41 mutations are
associated with viral fitness and cytopatic effects. Additional studies are needed to confirm the degree to
which these gp41 mutations contribute directly to coreceptor use and to establish the specific and precise
utility of this information.
