Abstract
Background: For marine snails, olfaction represents a crucial sensory modality for long-distance
reception, as auditory and visual information is limited. The posterior tentacle of Aplysia, the
rhinophore, is a chemosensory organ and several behavioural studies showed that the rhinophores
can detect pheromones, initiate orientation and locomotion toward food. However the functional
neuroanatomy of the rhinophore is not yet clear. Here we apply serotonin-immunohistochemistry
and fluorescent markers in combination with confocal microscopy as well as optical recording
techniques to elucidate the structure and function of the rhinophore of the sea slug Aplysia punctata.
Results: With anatomical techniques an overview of the neuroanatomical organization of the
rhinophore is presented. Labelling with propidium iodide revealed one layer of cell nuclei in the
sensory epithelium and densely packed cell nuclei beneath the groove of the rhinophore, which
extends to about two third of the total length of the rhinophore. Serotonin immunoreactivity was
found within the olfactory glomeruli underneath the epithelium as well as in the rhinophore
ganglion. Retrograde tracing from the rhinophore ganglion with 4-(4-(dihexadecylamino)styryl)-Nmethylpyridinium iodide (DiA) demonstrated the connection of glomeruli with the ganglion.
Around 36 glomeruli (mean diameter 49 μm) were counted in a single rhinophore. Fluorimetric
measurements of intracellular Ca2+ levels using Fura-2 AM loading revealed Ca2+-responses within
the rhinophore ganglion to stimulation with amino acids. Bath application of different amino acids
revealed differential responses at different positions within the rhinophore ganglion.
Conclusion: Our neuroanatomical study revealed the number and position of glomeruli in the
rhinophore and the rhinophore ganglion as processing stage of sensory information. Serotoninimmunoreactive processes were found extensively within the rhinophore, but was not detected
within any peripheral cell body. Amino acids were used as olfactory stimuli in optical recordings
and induced sensory responses in the rhinophore ganglion. The complexity of changes in
intracellular Ca2+-levels indicates, that processing of odour information takes place within the
rhinophore ganglion. Our neuroanatomical and functional studies of the rhinophore open up a new
avenue to analyze the olfactory system in Aplysia.

Background
Chemical signal perception represent an important part of
communication and is used by a large variety of organisms from protozoans [1] and yeast [2] to insects [3], molluscs [4,5], fish [6], mammals [7] and humans [8]. Sea
slugs of the genus Aplysia have been investigated intensively with respect to behavioural and neurobiological
studies, and the gill withdrawal reflex has become a well
known neuronal model circuit for studies of the cellular
basis of learning and memory [9-11]. Fewer studies have
targeted the olfactory system of Aplysia [12-14]. In Aplysia,
chemosensation plays an important role in the context of
various behaviours, e.g. localization of food [14,15] and
sexual behaviour [16]. The rhinophore is considered as
the olfactory organ in Aplysia [15] and was suggested to be
important for the detection of pheromones [16,17]; different peptide-pheromones were identified in the genus
Aplysia [4,18,19]. Recently, it could be demonstrated that
secondary metabolites (alkaloids) from marine sponges
stimulate neurons in the rhinophore ganglion of the rhinophore of Aplysia punctata [20].
Despite biological significance of olfaction, little is known
about structural and functional aspects of the olfactory
sensory pathway in Aplysia. The neuroanatomy of the tentacle was investigated in the terrestrial snail Achatina [21],
which belong to the group of Pulmonata and to stylommatophoran snails. The tentacles of Achatina fulica contain a tentacle ganglion, glomeruli and four pathways for
the projection of olfactory sensory neurons were
described. Aplysia was shown to posses a rhinophore ganglion but in contrast to Achatina the eye is at the base and
not at the top of the rhinophore, and photoreceptors are
located in the rhinophore epithelium [21-24]. In Phestilla
sibogae the presence of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine in the rhinophores was confirmed [25], possibly revealing glomerulus-like structures along the
olfactory pathway [26]. Serotonin-immunoreactive elements were also found in the rhinophores of Pleurobranchea californica and Tritonia diomedea [27]. Phestilla
sibogae, Pleurobranchea californica and Tritonia diomedea are
closely related to Aplysia punctata belonging to the systematic group of ophistobranchia. Here we look for serotonin
immunoreactivity in the rhinophore of Aplysia punctata. In
addition, neuroanatomical tracing and histology are used
to analyse the structure of the rhinophore.
Amino acids were shown to be potent olfactory stimuli for
aquatic animals [28-31] and elicit feeding responses in
Pleurobranchaea californica [32]. Murphy and Hadfield
[33] studied the innervation of the rhinophores and the
oral tentacles of Phestilla sibogae and used electrophysiological techniques to demonstrate that only the rhinophores were highly selective to free amino acids. Therefore
we use optical imaging technique and amino acids as

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/6

stimuli, to investigate chemoreceptive processing in the
rhinophore. The present study is aimed to contribute to
our understanding of the olfactory sensory pathway in
marine snails and the chemosensory capabilities of these
animals.

Results and discussion
Neuroanatomy of the rhinophore
The anatomy of the rhinophore of Aplysia was previously
investigated only with respect to the location of sensory
cells [13] and as part of a phylogenetic study of seahares
[34]. The presence of neuromodulators such as catecholamines has been demonstrated in the rhinophore of Aplysia californica by Croll [35]. This is the first study to focus
on the functional neuroanatomy of the rhinophore of
Aplysia punctata with respect to number and location of
glomeruli, serotonergic innervation and neuronal pathways. The rhinophore of Aplysia punctata contains a
groove, which extends to about two third of the total
length of the rhinophore. Figures 1A and 1B show an
example of a longitudinally sectioned rhinophore
labelled with phalloidin and serotonin-immunoreactivity
(IR). The rhinophore usually contracted during the process of dissection, and prominent longitudinal muscles
became strongly labelled with phalloidin binding to muscular f-actin (Figs 1A, B, F). Serotonin-IR was detectable in
various regions of the rhinophore: the rhinophore nerve,
the rhinophore ganglion at the basis of the groove, and
the glomeruli (Figs 1A, B, G). Serotonergic fibres proceeded from the rhinophore nerve via the rhinophore
ganglion to the glomeruli. Since no serotonin-IR was
detectable in cell bodies within the rhinophore, all serotonergic neurons innervating the rhinophore should be of
extrinsic origin. Croll [35] described tyrosine hydroxylase
immunoreactivity in both large and small somata beneath
the epithelium in the rhinophore, homogeneously distributed over walls of the entire structure, whereas serotonergic immnureactivity was found in cellular processes
but not the somata inside the rhinophore. Croll et al. [26]
found no serotonergic cell bodies in the periphery in the
nudibranch Phestilla, similar to our findings. This indicates a physiological role of catecholamines and serotonin
in olfactory processing mediated by centrifugal neurons in
the case of serotonin and more local modulation in the
case of catecholamines. Serotonergic innervation of olfactory glomeruli is commonly found in insects and was
shown to enhance the response of olfactory projection
neurons (e.g.: [36,37]).

A series of cross sections demonstrates phalloidin-labelled
muscle-fibres bundles oriented in the longitudinal and
horizontal axis of the rhinophore (Figs 1C, D, E). Glomeruli were situated beneath the sensory epithelium close to
the inner wall of the entire groove (Figs 1B, 2A, C). Staining of cell nuclei with propidium iodide indicates that the

glomeruli are not surrounded by a regular border of periglomerular cell somata (Figs 1G, 2A, H). In histological
sections, however, glomeruli appeared to be surrounded
by a layer of glia-like processes (Fig. 2I). In contrast to
insects and vertebrates, where olfactory glomeruli became
brightly labelled with phalloidin due to aggregation of
neuronal f-actin [38], glomeruli within the rhinophore of
Aplysia punctata were not labelled with phalloidin, and the
rhinophore ganglion was only lightly stained with phalloidin (Fig. 2F). Histological sections revealed that the rhinophore ganglion has a folded structure (Fig. 2G).
Retrograde labelling of the glomeruli by insertion of 4-(4(dihexadecylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide
(DiA) in the rhinophore ganglion demonstrated the connection between the rhinophore ganglion and the
glomeruli (Fig. 2H). DiA stainings show the neuronal
connection between the rhinophore ganglion and
glomeruli. Retrograde labelling with DiA revealed mostly
neuropil staining indicating that neuronal processes
extending from the rhinophore ganglion to the glomeruli
were preferentially labelled. We do not know if the cell
bodies of these neurons lie in the rhinophore ganglion
(because of massive staining) or further out in the periphery, or on adjacent sections. Future studies will focus in
more detail on individual projections of sensory neurons
using patch clamp/single neuron recordings and dye filling techniques.
The number of glomeruli was estimated in a complete
series of sections of the rhinophore labelled with 5-HT
antibody. The total number of glomeruli counted in one
rhinophore was 36 in one rhinophore, and the mean
diameter of individual glomeruli averaged 49 μm +/- 27
μm with a range from 25 μm to 135 μm.
Previous investigations on Aplysia californica have shown
that the groove houses various types of sensory cells [13].
Emery and Audesirk [13] suggested that intraepithelial
cells with 30 μM long cilia produce a steady water flow
around the epithelial cells of the rhinophore to facilitate
olfaction. Anterograde labelling experiments in a terrestrial snail (Achatina fulica) by Chase and Tollozcko [21]
have shown that sensory neurons project to the glomeruli
and directly to the rhinophore ganglion or to further centres in the cerebral ganglion. Future experiments are
needed to find out if similar projection patterns of sensory
neurons are present in Aplysia.
Labelling of cell nuclei with propidium iodide and histological sections showed the high amount of cell nuclei in
the sensory epithelium (Figs 1F, G, 2A, H, I). The layer of
sensory cell nuclei is clearly separated from the more basal
nuclei (Fig 2H). Glomeruli were located underneath this
epithelium (Figs 2H, I).

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/6

Propidium Iodide and Mallory's stain revealed cell nuclei
of variable sizes surrounding the glomeruli. Both methods
revealed very few nuclei inside the glomeruli similar to the
conditions in vertebrates and in insects (Figs. 2H, I). Propidium Iodide has very high affinity to nucleic acids, and
since we used agarose sections with excellent penetration
properties we are convinced that all nuclei were labelled.
In contrast to the glomeruli, cell nuclei were present
inside the rhinophore ganglion (Fig. 2G). Cell nuclei can
be from both neuronal and glial cell bodies.
The anatomy of the rhinophores with distributed glomeruli around the groove leaves different possibilities open
for central projections of olfactory receptor neurons
(ORNs). The general view of a uniglomerular projection
pattern, which seems to occur in most insects [39,40] and
vertebrates [41,42], would be complicated with the
present arrangement of glomeruli. Possibly, ORNs of the
same type are situated beneath one glomerulus and are
not uniformly distributed over the sensory epithelium, or,
in the other case, axonal projections of individual ORNs
to their target glomeruli would be very long and across the
rhinophore. Recent studies in Xenopus laevis described an
innervation of more than one glomerulus by individual
ORNs [43]. Multiglomerular projection patterns also
appear in crustaceans [44]. In Aplysia, future studies on the
projection pattern of ORNs combined with functional
imaging studies of the glomeruli will provide further
insight in the functional role of glomeruli in molluscs.
Calcium imaging of odour evoked responses within the
rhinophore ganglion
To investigate whether the rhinophore ganglion responds
to olfactory stimulation of the sensory epithelium of the
rhinophore, we applied different amino acids as odorants
and recorded the responses optically. First of all we tested
our system by the application of artificial sea water (ASW)
with high K+ (Fig. 3A). The Ca2+-response induced by a
high K+-solution could be reproduced and showed nearly
a similar increase after repetitive application.

We chose different amino acids, as they were used in previous experiments in gastropod molluscs [32,33]. To
avoid direct excitation of neurons within the rhinophore
by the stimuli, we did not use glutamic and aspartic acid,
which induced highest responses in the nudibranch Phestilla sibogae [33]. In more than 10 experiments we found
no Ca2+ – response within the rhinophore ganglion
induced by the application of methionin at different concentration (200 μm – 20 mM).
Clear Ca2+-responses within the rhinophore ganglion
were found during stimulation with alanine (ALA). Figure
3B shows three responses to ALA from three different animals. In all experiments 2 mM ALA was applied. We

found a decrease of Ca2+-levels as well as an increase (Fig
3B upper trace). Application of different amino acids (2
mM each) during one experiment revealed differential
responses of intracellular Ca2+-levels in distinct regions
(Fig 3C). The traces in Fig 3C show Ca2+-measurements in
two different regions of interest. Arginine (ARG) and
glutamine (GLN) induced a response in one region,
whereas the other region showed no response, but both
regions responded with a change in Ca2+-level to the stimulation with glycine (GLY) and valine (VAL). Both regions

showed a decrease in Ca2+-levels to all stimuli (Fig. 3C)
indicating an inhibition or reduction of cellular activity by
these stimuli. Stimulation with 2 mM phenylalanine
(PHE) induced no detectable responses.
The responses to different concentrations of ALA (2 μM –
20 mM) were highly dependent on the recording position
within the ganglion. Ten responses from ten regions
within the rhinophore ganglion are demonstrated in figure 4. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected more or less

shown in the figures. The size of individual ROIs can be
estimated from the scale bar (Fig. 4B). We assume that in

many cases ROIs may have not included a single neuron
since the diameter ROIs were between 15 and 60 μM and
only the largest cell bodies reach 50 μM.
In the course of a single experiment, odour induced
responses to amino acids recorded from different regions
remained similar. We applied ALA in concentration from
2 μm to 20 mM. At low concentration (<2 mM) it was difficult to decide whether an observed Ca2+-response was
stimulus dependent. At a concentration of 2 mM ALA,
clear responses could be observed in three regions (Fig 4C
VIII-X). Regions VIII and IX showed a decrease of the Ca2+levels, whereas in region X the Ca2+-level increased.
In response to 20 mM ALA all of the selected regions
showed a change in intracellular Ca2+-levels. It was either
a decrease or an increase of the Ca2+-levels, or even a combination of both as shown in trace II. Remarkably,
responses from neighbouring regions (II and III; IX and X)
showed opposing Ca2+-responses indicating a possible
inhibitory coupling. The spatial response patterns were
complex. Stimulation with 20 mM ALA induced an
increase in Ca2+-levels in four regions (Fig. 3A-I,-V,-VI,-X),
whereas in five other regions we found a decrease in Ca2+levels (Fig. 3A-III,-IV,-VII,-VIII,-IX), and in region II a
decrease was followed by an increase in Ca2+-levels.
In all of our experiments, the highest Ca2+-responses were
induced by ALA. Since the rhinophore is cut during the
preparation, we cannot exclude partial injury of the rhinophore ganglia. However, the calcium imaging experiments demonstrate that parts of the rhinophore ganglion
respond differentially to stimulation of the sensory epithelium with amino acids indicating that olfactory stimuli
are relayed and processed in the rhinophore ganglion. In
a previous investigation we tested sponge alkaloids and
revealed clear responses to sceptrin at 200 μM concentration [20]. The term olfaction is used in terrestrial animals
for airborne chemicals, but also in aquatic animals for
water borne chemicals detected by primary receptor neurons in the nose (e.g. fish, amphibians) or on the antennae (crustaceans) [45]. In vertebrates it is referred to as
long distance reception in contrast to close range chemoreception via taste receptors (secondary receptor cells).
In Phestilla sibogae different densities of subepithelial sensory cells and intraepithelial sensory cells were found in
the oral tentacle and the rhinophores [46]. These morphological data together with the electrophysiological evidence for greater sensitivity of the rhinophores [33] led
Boudko and colleagues [46] to the conclusion, that rhinophores serve for long-distance chemoreception or olfaction. To our knowledge, a clear separation based on
receptor cell morphology has not been done for Aplysia;
therefore we prefer to use the term "olfaction" because of

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/6

the apparent similarities regarding the organization of the
central pathway in glomeruli.
In Limax, processing of olfactory information was mainly
investigated at the level of the procerebrum [47-49], and
complex odour induced oscillations were described. In
Aplysia, using calcium imaging techniques we did not find
any indications for odour induced oscillations at the level
of the rhinophore ganglion. However, the complexity of
changes in intracellular Ca2+-levels indicates that processing of odour information takes place within the rhinophore ganglion.
The spatial distribution of odour induced activity
recorded in this study indicates that the activity in the rhinophore ganglion depends on the chemical nature and
intensity of the stimulus.
Various studies in insects as well as vertebrates suggest
that olfactory glomeruli represent functional units for
odour processing, and olfactory information is represented in a spatial map of differentially activated glomeruli (e.g.:[50,51]). It will be interesting to determine if this
is also the case in Aplysia and if glomeruli represent functional units for odour processing. Glomeruli diameters
ranged between 25 μm and 135 μm indicating different
numbers of neurons converging in one glomerulus. In
insects, macroglomeruli were found to play an important
role in pheromone communication (e.g.: [52,53]). As the
rhinophore of Aplysia plays an important role in pheromone detection [17], it would be interesting to investigate
the large glomeruli and their potential function in pheromone processing. Measuring the responses of sensory
neurons in the epithelium may also help to identify olfactory sensory neurons. Many marine organisms produce
secondary metabolites for defence, deterrence and as pheromones. Sea slugs as well as many other marine animals
depend on chemosensory information from their aquatic
environment, as the optical sense plays a minor role in
shallow muddy waters or the deep sea and acoustic/mechano-sensory senses give only limited information about
for example food quality. The chemical sense probably is
the primary sense in many marine organisms, and Aplysia
represents a promising model system for future investigations of the chemical ecology of sea slugs.

Conclusion
The glomeruli and the rhinophore ganglion represent different processing stages for sensory information. We
found 36 glomeruli in the rhinophore and retrograde
labelling with DiA revealed the connection between
glomeruli and rhinophore ganglion. The glomeruli are situated close to the epithelials layers towards the lumen of
the groove and appear to be surrounded by a thin glia-like
sheath. Serotonin-immunoreactivity was found exten-

sively within the rhinophore, but was not detected in any
peripheral cell body. Therefore these serotonergic fibres
appear to be efferent projections from central ganglia.
Amino acids were used as potentially important olfactory
stimuli for aquatic animals, and optical recordings show
that amino acids induce sensory responses in the rhinophore. The complexity of changes in intracellular Ca2+levels led us suggest, that processing of odour information
takes place within the rhinophore ganglion. Our neuroanatomical and functional studies of the rhinophore open
up a new avenue to analyze the olfactory system in Aplysia,
leading towards understanding neuronal processing of
chemical cues in the marine environment.

Methods
Tissue preparation, immunocytochemistry, and
fluorescent tracers
Specimens of Aplysia punctata were collected from shallow
waters around Helgoland. Animals were cooled in ice,
fixed in 4% formaldehyde in Artificial Sea Water (ASW;
pH 7.5; in mM: 460 NaCl, 104 KCl, 55 MgCl, 11 CaCl2,
and 15 Na -HEPES (N-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N-2ethansulfonic acid Na-salt). Before further treatments rhinophores were washed three times in 0.1 M phosphate
buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). For labelling with fluophore-conjugated phalloidin, immunocytochemistry,
tracing with lipophilic markers and nuclear staining, the
rhinophores were embedded in 5% low-melting point
agarose (Agarose II, Amresco, Solon, OH, No. 210–815)
and sectioned in a frontal or sagittal plane at 150 μm
thickness with a vibrating microtome (Leica VT 1000S,
Wetzlar, Germany). Free-floating agarose sections were
preincubated in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum (ICN, Biomedicals, Orsay, France, Cat.
No.191356) for one hour at room temperature. Different
combinations of double stainings were performed. To
label serotonergic neurons, sections were incubated with
a primary antibody against 5-HT, raised in rabbit (1:4000,
DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, Cat. No. 20080, Lot No.
051007) in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% NGS
overnight at room temperature. This antibody was used in
previous studies in gastropod molluscs [26,27]. After five
rinses in PBS, sections were incubated in Alexa Fluor 488
conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:250,
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, Cat. No. A -11008). To
label filamentous (f)-actin in muscles and neurons, sections were incubated in 0.2 units of Alexa Fluor 488 or
568 phalloidin (Molecular probes, A-12379 and A12380) in PBS overnight at 4°C. To stain cell nuclei, sections were incubated for 15 min in 25 μg/ml propidium
iodide (Molecular probes, P-1304) in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature. Sections were finally
washed at least five times with PBS, transferred into 60%
glycerol/PBS for 30 min, and mounted on slides in 80%
glycerol in PBS.

Staining with lipophilic tracers
The fluorescent lipophilic dye 4-(4-(dihexadecylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium
iodide
(DiA;
Molecular Probes, D -3883) was used as retrograde tracer.
Crystals of DiA were transferred into the rhinophore ganglion with a fine minuten pin. Following dye application
the rhinophores were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS
and incubated for 7 days at 4°C. Embedding, sectioning
and double labelling with propidium iodide were performed as described above. Finally, sections were rinsed
in PBS and mounted in PBS on microscopic slides.
Histology, Mallory's stain and microscopy
Rhinophores were fixed in Bouin's fixative solution for 2
days, washed with ethanol, embedded in Spurr's resin and
sectioned in a frontal plane (6 μm). After normal histological procedures, the plastic sections were stained after the
method from Mallory (for details [54]) on a hotplate. The
sections were washed with distilled water, dried on the
hotplate and mounted in Entellan (Merck,. Darmstadt,
Germany). Images were taken with a digital Camera (Spotinsight Color, Vistron Systems, Puchheim, Germany)
mounted on a microscope (Zeiss Axiophot, Carl Zeiss
GmbH, Jena, Germany). Image processing was performed
with CorelDRAW Graphics Suite (Corel Corporation,
Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).

Fluorescent tracers and antibodies were visualized using a
laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP).
Glomeruli counts per slice were corrected for doublecounting in adjacent slices using the method after Weibel
[55]. Image processing was performed with the following
software: Zeiss Image Browser (Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany), Corel Photopaint and CorelDRAW Graphics Suite
(Corel Corporation, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), and
Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, USA).
Fluorimetric measurements of intracellular Ca2+ levels
All physiological experiments were performed at the
marine station Helgoland. The rhinophores were dissected as described above and cut longitudinally using a
razor blaze. The half containing the ganglion was incubated for 60 min at 4°C with ASW containing 5 μM Fura
II acetoxymethylester (AM). After removal of the incubation buffer the rhinophores were washed for 10 min.
Changes in fluorescence were monitored with an imaging
system (Visitron, Puchheim) and a CCD camera mounted
on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100) equipped
with a UV objective (Zeiss NeoFluar 20X). Different
regions within the rhinophore ganglion were measured
using the "region" function of the software (Metafluor,
Meta Imaging Series, Universal Imaging Corporation).
Changes in fluorescence were obtained by ratiometric
measurements with excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm
excitation. Values were presented as relative changes in

ratios representing alterations in intracellular Ca2+-levels.
Fluorescence images were acquired with an interval of 5 s
and an exposure time of 50 ms per image.
For odour stimulation the recording chamber (volume 3
ml) was mounted on the microscope stage, and the bath
flow was adjusted to 4 ml/min with a peristaltic pump.
The chamber volume was exchanged in less than one
minute. Amino acids, which induced the highest response
in Pleurobranchea californica [32] were chosen: Alanine,
Arginine, Glutamine, Glycine, Phenylalanine, Methionine
and Valine. Amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) were applied for one minute at various concentrations with the peristaltic pump system. In control
experiments, the rhinophore ganglion was removed and
treated similar as the rhinophore obtaining no response
to amino acids. Each amino acid (1 M stock each) was dissolved in ASW and final concentrations ranged from 2 μM
to 20 mM. Stimulus solutions were prepared immediately
before use by dissolving the respective stock solution in
ASW. After application the recording chamber was
washed with ASW for at least 10 min to remove all amino
acids possibly attached to the rhinophore. In most cases,
50 regions were measured simultaneously. As a control
for the viability of the preparations the last stimulus at the
end of an experiment was a high K+ buffer stimulation
(400 mM NaCl was replaced by 400 mM KCl), which
always elicited a strong response. Calcium-imaging experiments were performed with 25 (K+)-responsive rhinophores.
