Molecular identification of Lodoicea maldivica
(coco de mer) seeds
Chun-yin Mak* and Chuen-shing Mok

Abstract
Background: The edible endosperm of Lodoicea maldivica with the common name of coco de mer is used in
Chinese medicine for treating cough. Native to Seychelles, Lodoicea maldivica seeds have commanded high prices
for centuries due to its scarcity. This study aims to develop a molecular identification method for the
authentication of Lodoicea maldivica seeds.
Methods: DNA was extracted from the sample. Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems were developed to
amplify a region of the chloroplast DNA and the nuclear phosphoribulokinase (PRK) region specific to Lodoicea
maldivica respectively. DNA sequence of a sample was determined and compared with that of the Lodoicea
maldivica reference material.
Results: The PRK gene of Lodoicea maldivica was successfully amplified and sequenced for identification.
Conclusion: A new molecular method for the identification of Lodoicea maldivica seeds in fresh, frozen or dried
forms was developed.

Background
Lodoicea maldivica (coco de mer), the sole member of the
genus Lodoicea, is a fan-leaved palm native to Seychelles,
bearing the largest and heaviest seed in the plant kingdom (weighing up to 30 kg). The seed is enclosed in a
hard shell resembling a pair of coconuts joined in the
middle. The seed is sometimes also referred to as the sea
coconut, bum seed, double coconut, coco fesse or
Seychelles nut. Lodoicea maldivica palms take between
25-50 years to reach maturity and bear fruit. The fruit
may take one to three years to germinate [1]. Only two
natural populations of Lodoicea maldivica remain [1].
Individual plants are also cultivated in various botanical
gardens around the world. The harvest of seeds has
virtually stopped all natural regeneration of the plant.
The populations are also threatened by fire and
encroachment by invasive plants. In March 2010, Lodoicea maldivica was added to the appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in its 15th meeting of the
Conference of the Parties [2]. Trade of Lodoicea maldivica is also governed by the Protection of Endangered

Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance in Hong Kong
(Cap. 586). According to the ordinance, unless exempted,
the import, introduction from the sea, export, re-export
or possession of Lodoicea maldivica requires a licence
issued by the Hong Kong government. The edible endosperm (ie fruit) of the plant has long been used in
Chinese medicine for treating cough and is used mainly
in soup in Hong Kong, China [3]. As fake products are
often found in the markets, an identification method is
needed.
This study aims to develop a new method for the identification of Lodoicea maldivica with DNA sequencing analysis. DNA was extracted from the edible endosperm
sample. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system was
designed to amplify a region of the chloroplast DNA to
validate the quality of the extracted DNA [4,5]. A number
of genes or spacer regions may be considered to identify
unknown samples, for example, the internal transcribed
spacer 1 [6], internal transcribed spacer 2 [6], nuclear ribosomal RNA genes 18S unit [6], large subunit of ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) [7], intergenic region between the b subunit of ATP synthase
(atpB) and rbcL [8] and the chloroplast trnL-trnF intergenic spacer region [9]. In this study, a PCR system targeting the nuclear phosphoribulokinase (PRK) region was

designed. This region has been employed in many palm
phylogenetics and shown ample characters to resolve
relations at species level [10-13]. After DNA sequence
analysis, the identity of the unknown was evaluated by
pair-wise matching of its sequence with that of the certified Lodoicea maldivica reference species.

Methods
Materials

A Lodoicea maldivica seed certified by the Ministry of
Environment, Natural Resources and Transport of the
Republic of Seychelles was used as reference. The official certificate supports the authenticity of the species.
The fresh reference seed is, thick, relatively hard and
brown in colour with white flesh inside and about 10 kg
in weight. The seed was assigned a voucher number of
TD/TD/CRM/10001. The seed was kept frozen before
analysis. Seven sliced commercial products with description of sea coconut or coco de mer (namely Sample A to
Sample G) and one coconut sample (sample H) were
purchased from the local market. Sample details are
listed in Table 1
For the samples in the form of pre-packaged product
mixed with other materials, the suspected coconut portion was isolated from the background matrix before
homogenisation. For fresh/frozen samples, the sample
was homogenised by a blender, and about 1-5g of the
sample was transferred into a flat bottom glass container.
The sample was freeze-dried. The dried sample was
ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen. For dried
samples, the sample was simply ground into fine powder
in liquid nitrogen.
DNA extraction

DNA extraction was performed with the CTAB method
[14]. A total of 1.0 mL of pre-warmed (65°C) CTAB
extraction buffer (2% w/v hexadecyl trimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB), 0.1 M Tris, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA)
was added to 100 mg of the test sample in a 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube. Alpha-amylase solution (10 μL-20 μL),
20 μL of proteinase K solution (20 mg/mL), 100 μL of 10%
w/v polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVP) and 5 μL of RNase A
(100 mg/mL) were added. The mixture was incubated at
65°C overnight with constant agitation. After centrifugation (Eppendorf, Germany) for ten minutes at 16,000× g at
room temperature, the supernatant was transferred to a

new 2.0 mL tube and an equal amount of chloroform was
added. The sample was shaken vigorously for 30 seconds
before centrifugation (Eppendorf, Germany) for ten minutes at 16,000× g at room temperature. The upper layer
was transferred to a new 2.0 mL tube and extracted with
an equal amount of chloroform. The sample was centrifuged 16,000× g (Eppendorf, Germany) for five minutes.
The upper layer was transferred to a new 2.0 mL tube and
two volumes of CTAB precipitation solution (0.5% w/v
CTAB, 0.04 M NaCl) were added. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes without agitation. The supernatant was discarded after the sample was
centrifuged (Eppendorf, Germany) for ten minutes at
16,000× g. The precipitate was dissolved in 350 μL of
1.2 M NaCl solution and was centrifuged (Eppendorf,
Germany) for ten minutes at 16,000× g. The upper layer
was transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube. Two volumes of
cold absolute ethanol were added to precipitate the DNA.
The sample was kept at -20°C for at least 20 minutes. The
supernatant was discarded after centrifugation (Eppendorf,
Germany) for ten minutes at 16,000× g at 4°C. A total of
500 μL of 70% cold ethanol solution was added and the
sample was centrifuged (Eppendorf, Germany) for ten
minutes at 16,000× g at 4°C. The DNA pellet was dried in
a 37°C oven for several minutes and was then re-dissolved
in 100 μL of DNase-free water.
PCR for chloroplast DNA

The chloroplast DNA region (partial) was amplified with
50 ng DNA template, 1.0 μL of 5 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μL of
25 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 μL of 10× PCR buffer plus MgCl 2
(Applied Biosystems, USA), 0.5 μL of 10 μM specific
primers (Table 2) and 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, USA). Water was added to
make up to 25 μL. The DNA template was denatured at
95°C for five minutes and then 35 cycles of 30 seconds
at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, 45 seconds at 72°C and
final extension at 72°C for five minutes. The amplification products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide and observed under UV
illumination.
PCR for PRK gene

The PRK gene was amplified with 50 ng DNA template,
1.25 μL of 5 mM dNTPs, 2.0 μL of 25 mM MgCl 2 ,
2.5 μL of 10× PCR buffer without MgCl 2 (Applied

(BSA), 0.5 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1 U of
AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Water was added to make up the final volume to 25 μL.
The DNA template was denatured at 95°C for four minutes, and then 35 cycles of one minute at 94°C, 30 seconds at 54°C, one minute at 72°C and final extension at
72°C for seven minutes. The amplification products
were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, stained with
ethidium bromide and observed under UV illumination.
DNA sequencing

The PCR products of PRK gene were purified with DNA
Clean & Concentrator™ -25 (Zymo Research, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The BigDye®
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used for the cycle sequencing reaction.
The PCR product was first denatured at 96°C for one minute and then 25 cycles of thermal cycling was performed
as follows: 96°C for ten seconds, 50°C for five seconds,
60°C for four minutes. The BigDye® XTerminator™ Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used to purify
the extension products according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and the products were then run on the ABI
PRISM® 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
USA).

commercial products thereof are made up of various
forms of its edible endosperm. In order to develop a
method for testing the authenticity of the claimed Lodoicea maldivica products, we think that PCR-ready DNA
must be extracted from the endosperm of Lodoicea
maldivica.
The chemical PVP is an important reagent in DNA
extraction. Without the addition of PVP, the sample
solution for the extracted DNA contained high levels of
polysaccharide, as shown in the UV spectra. The contamination was greatly reduced by the addition of PVP during the initial incubation at 65°C in the extraction step.
While the amount of DNA extracted from all samples in
this study was very low (< 10 ng/μL), the quality of the
extracted genomic DNA was sufficient for the PCR and
sequencing.
PCR-chloroplast DNA

Plant 1 and Plant 2 primers are targeted for the amplification of a region of plant chloroplast DNA and were
used to verify the quality of the template DNA [2]. A
single PCR product of about 550 bp was successfully
amplified from all samples. The positive PCR results
indicated that DNA of sufficient quantity and quality
were successfully extracted and that the PCR was not
inhibited by other components of the analytical sample.

Sequence Analysis

We aligned the sequence of the unknown sample in pair
with that of the reference species using the bl2seq tool
of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) website [15]. Moreover, we performed multiple
sequence alignment using the CLUSTAL2 tool of the
European Bioinformatics Institute website [16].

Results and Discussion
DNA extraction

A study [17] reported that DNA from the solid endosperm
of coconut was not a good starting material for molecular
biology work because the matrix may hinder enzyme
activity and because of the high lipid and polysaccharide
content. The study suggested that DNA from young leaves
of the plant should be used as the source of genomic
DNA. Nevertheless, only the edible endosperm of Lodoicea maldivica is used in Chinese medicine and the

The nuclear region of the PRK gene was amplified with
the second PCR system. This region has been used successfully to resolve palm phylogenetic relations at the species level [10-13]. Positive results (ie a fluorescent DNA
band of about 750 bp) from this PCR system would indicate that the sample contained the PRK gene whereas
negative results would indicate that the sample was not
from Lodoicea maldivica.
Single-band PCR products of about 750 bp were successfully amplified from Lodoicea maldivica reference
material and two commercial products namely Sample A
and Sample H. Other samples yielded either negative
results or multiple PCR products in the amplification of
PRK gene. Lodoicea maldivica yielded only one single
PCR product in the analysis of PRK gene. The sample
should be considered as not of Lodoicea maldivica in origin when no or more than one band was observed after
agarose gel electrophoresis [4]. The identities of these

Mak and Mok Chinese Medicine 2011, 6:34

unknown samples were found by using one of the markers
[6-9] as mentioned in the background section.
Sequence analysis

All the amplified PRK genes were successfully sequenced.
The nucleotide sequence of the Lodoicea maldivica reference material was submitted to the GenBank [GenBank:
JF820816]. We compared the nucleotide sequence in pair
between the reference material and each of the unknown
samples using the bl2seq tool [15]. For those sequences
not matching the reference material, further search in the
GenBank was performed. The PRK gene sequence of
sample A was identical to that of the reference material
(Figure 1). While the PRK gene sequence of sample H
only matched that of the reference material with 80%

Page 4 of 5

homology (Figure 2), it matched the PRK sequence of
species Cocos nucifera with 100% homology in GenBank
database [GenBank: HQ265608] (Figure 3). Currently,
there is only one single entry of the Lodoicea maldivica
PRK gene sequence in NCBI GenBank [GenBank:
AF453357]. The sequence was obtained from a Lodoicea
maldivica voucher (voucher number: C.E. Lewis 98-020/
BH) and reported by Lewis et al. in 2002 [12]. However,
the exact source of the voucher was not reported. The
BLAST [15] result of the Lodoicea maldivica reference
material sequence obtained in this study showed a 99%
homology to that of the [GenBank: AF453357] (Figure 1).
The Lodoicea maldivica reference species used in this
study was obtained from the country of origin of the species with official certificate. The present study provides
an alternative source of nucleotide sequence data for
GenBank for the identification of Lodoicea maldivica.
The applicability and accuracy of the method have been
demonstrated by the consistent results obtained from
replicated analysis of the samples.

Conclusion
A new molecular method for the identification of Lodoicea maldivica seeds in fresh, frozen or dried forms was
developed.
