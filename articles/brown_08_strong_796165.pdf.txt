Abstract
Background: Determining an absolute timescale for avian evolutionary history has proven
contentious. The two sources of information available, paleontological data and inference from
extant molecular genetic sequences (colloquially, 'rocks' and 'clocks'), have appeared irreconcilable;
the fossil record supports a Cenozoic origin for most modern lineages, whereas molecular genetic
estimates suggest that these same lineages originated deep within the Cretaceous and survived the
K-Pg (Cretaceous-Paleogene; formerly Cretaceous-Tertiary or K-T) mass-extinction event. These
two sources of data therefore appear to support fundamentally different models of avian evolution.
The paradox has been speculated to reflect deficiencies in the fossil record, unrecognized biases in
the treatment of genetic data or both. Here we attempt to explore uncertainty and limit bias
entering into molecular divergence time estimates through: (i) improved taxon (n = 135) and
character (n = 4594 bp mtDNA) sampling; (ii) inclusion of multiple cladistically tested internal fossil
calibration points (n = 18); (iii) correction for lineage-specific rate heterogeneity using a variety of
methods (n = 5); (iv) accommodation of uncertainty in tree topology; and (v) testing for possible
effects of episodic evolution.
Results: The various 'relaxed clock' methods all indicate that the major (basal) lineages of modern
birds originated deep within the Cretaceous, although temporal intraordinal diversification
patterns differ across methods. We find that topological uncertainty had a systematic but minor
influence on date estimates for the origins of major clades, and Bayesian analyses assuming fixed
topologies deliver similar results to analyses with unconstrained topologies. We also find that,
contrary to expectation, rates of substitution are not autocorrelated across the tree in an
ancestor-descendent fashion. Finally, we find no signature of episodic molecular evolution related
to either speciation events or the K-Pg boundary that could systematically mislead inferences from
genetic data.
Conclusion: The 'rock-clock' gap has been interpreted by some to be a result of the vagaries of
molecular genetic divergence time estimates. However, despite measures to explore different
forms of uncertainty in several key parameters, we fail to reconcile molecular genetic divergence

time estimates with dates taken from the fossil record; instead, we find strong support for an
ancient origin of modern bird lineages, with many extant orders and families arising in the midCretaceous, consistent with previous molecular estimates. Although there is ample room for
improvement on both sides of the 'rock-clock' divide (e.g. accounting for 'ghost' lineages in the
fossil record and developing more realistic models of rate evolution for molecular genetic
sequences), the consistent and conspicuous disagreement between these two sources of data more
likely reflects a genuine difference between estimated ages of (i) stem-group origins and (ii) crowngroup morphological diversifications, respectively. Further progress on this problem will benefit
from greater communication between paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists in accounting
for error in avian lineage age estimates.

Background
Many evolutionary models [1-4] are tightly linked to
absolute timescales. A reliable temporal framework is
therefore required for understanding the tempo (and,
through correlation with geophysical phenomena, mechanisms) of biological evolution. There are two complementary sources of information for dating ancient
biological divergences: (1) physical historical remains
(either paleontological or ichnological); and (2) molecular sequence differences among extant taxa, the analysis of
which requires assumptions about the processes and rates
of sequence evolution. Unfortunately, these two sources
of information ('rocks' and 'clocks', respectively) often
yield starkly disparate estimates of the timing of major
biological divergences [5].
Of course, some discrepancy is expected, as these two
sources of data concern different stages during the process
of cladogenesis (δTrue MA-FA; Figure 1). As fossils document
products of evolution, they necessarily post-date speciation events. The underestimation of speciation times from
fossil data (δFossil error) can be partitioned into two components: (i) the interval, following speciation, required for
diagnostic characters to evolve (δDiagnostic character); and (ii)
the time, following the evolution of diagnostic characters,
realized for the deposition of a sampled fossil (δOldest fossil).
Here, δDiagnostic character can be regarded as a fixed value
(although different for every node), however δOldest fossil can
be reduced with subsequently older fossil finds. In contrast to fossils, molecular data instead reflect genetic divergence, which must predate speciation events because
genetic lineages present in two newly evolved sister lineages coalesce (on average) 2Ne generations prior to speciation [6]. However, the errors associated with molecular
age estimates (δCoalescence and δClock error) are more complex
than analogous fossil errors. For example, if no polymorphism exists for a particular locus at speciation, then
inferred genetic divergence times based on that locus will
actually post-date speciation, as no information exists to
trace the underlying genealogy. Furthermore, molecular
data may overestimate or underestimate the true speciation time because of stochastic errors associated with

divergence time estimation (δClock error), and this uncertainty will increase as one extrapolates backwards through
time, even with an infinite amount of data [7]. Regardless,
for a given node with a minimum age constraint derived
from the fossil record, the realized discrepancy between
the two estimates (δRealized MA-FA = MA - FA = δMolecular error +
δFossil error) will always be positive, and is a parameter that
both paleontologists and molecular biologists are working to minimize [5].
Strictly speaking, any molecular estimate that generates a
positive value of δRealized MA-FA is consistent with the fossil
record. It is instead the magnitude of δRealized MA-FA that suggests conflict, and distressingly large values sometimes
exist. Conflict between the two sources of information is
especially evident with respect to the ages of extant avian
lineages (Neornithes). Based on a strict interpretation of
the fossil record (i.e. insignificant δFossil error), Feduccia
[8,9] proposed an explosive Cenozoic origin for most
modern avian lineages, presumably a result of open
niches left by newly extinct non-avian dinosaurs and
other taxa. Although a recent fossil find [10] forces a minimum of five of the earliest Neornithes divergences into
the late Cretaceous, the fossil record generally supports
the view that most modern lineages originated in the
Cenozoic [8,9,11-15]. In contrast, molecular estimates all
indicate that these same lineages are considerably older,
sometimes as much as twice as old as analogous paleontological estimates [4,16-26]. Between these two extremes
lies the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg; formerly CretaceousTertiary or K-T) boundary, a period when as many as 50%
of land-dwelling species went extinct [27]. The conflicting
age estimates thus have different implications regarding
the influence of the K-Pg mass extinctions on the evolutionary radiation of modern birds.
Although resolution of this conflict is clearly important
for understanding avian diversification, it is hindered by
compelling arguments from both sides. The supposition
that the quality of the fossil record deteriorates backwards
in time, for example, is contradicted by the observed congruence between stratigraphic and phylogenetic ordering

Figure 1
Different ways that fossil and molecular data date lineages
Different ways that fossil and molecular data date lineages. Time intervals defined by the horizontal dashed lines and
vertical arrows pertain to age estimates for the divergence between hypothetical lineages X and Y. Even with a complete fossil
record and perfect molecular clock a discrepancy is expected between fossil (FA) and molecular (MA) age estimates. As diagnostic morphological characters generally evolve (TMorphology) after species divergence (TSpecies), the fossil record will always
underestimate (by δDiagnostic character) the true speciation time. Genetic data, on the other hand, will overestimate speciation time
(by δCoalescence), as polymorphisms present during species divergence will coalesce some time in the past (TGene; related to the
ancestral species effective population size). The genuine difference between molecular and morphological divergence times will
thus be δTrue MA-FA. With a less complete fossil record, the oldest known fossil is unlikely to temporally correspond precisely to
the origination of a diagnostic character delimiting X and Y, further decreasing FA by δOldest fossil. Under the more realistic scenario of lineage-specific rate heterogeneity and limited taxon/character sampling, errors associated with molecular methods
(δClock error) may result in overestimation or underestimation of the true speciation time, although underestimates are bounded
by the fossil constraint (δFossil error). The observed discrepancy in age estimates, δRealized MA-FA, may be considerably larger than
expectations (δTrue MA-FA).

of taxa [28]. Sophisticated stratigraphic analyses indicate
that fossils of the antiquity necessary to produce congruence with molecular studies are extremely improbable
[11,29,30] (but see [31,32]). Furthermore, of the known
Mesozoic avian fossils [12,14,33,34], the vast majority
unambiguously lay outside Neornithes [35]. Although a
few Cretaceous fossils putatively represent modern lineages (e.g. parrot [36], loon [37] and others [12,14]) these
have largely been dismissed as fragmentary and inconclusive [9,12,38,39]. One the molecular side, the recognition
that rates of molecular evolution are often not clock-like
(including birds [23,40-42]), and that lineage-specific
heterogeneity is common [43], has spurred the development of numerous 'relaxed' molecular clock methods (see
reviews in [44-46]). In support of molecular genetic data,
these methods perform well in simulation [47,48] and,
when applied to empirical data, deliver Cretaceous ages
for the origin of modern birds [16,23].

Given these arguments, the paleontological and molecular phylogenetic communities are currently at an impasse
regarding the application of an absolute temporal axis for
early organismal evolution [33,49], and a range of evolutionary models [1-4] remain viable for birds. Here we
endeavour to determine whether a more rigorous treatment of molecular genetic data lessens the 'rock-clock' discrepancy (δRealized MA-FA). In particular, we incorporate large
fossil and taxon data sets, two components of molecular
dating that have been shown to have a strong impact on
the resulting divergence time estimates [50,51]. In addition, we accommodate and explore the impact of uncertainty in both tree topology and molecular dating strategy.
Finally, we test for signals of episodic molecular evolution
related to both speciation events and absolute geologic
time, processes that could potentially mislead molecularbased age estimates by systematically inflating branch
lengths within speciose clades [52].

Results
Phylogenetic inference
Our optimal phylogenetic reconstruction (TOptimal; AICc =
414160.2536) is a significantly better fit to the mtDNA
matrix than a recent consensus topology derived from the
literature (TConsensus; AICc = 421460.9166; see the methods section and Figure 2). Nevertheless, the two topologies agree in many instances. For example, several
traditional orders identified as having little support for
monophyly
(e.g.
Coraciiformes,
Ciconiiformes,
Caprimulgiformes and Falconiformes [53]) were also
polyphyletic in our analyses. However, the two trees also
differ in many respects, most notably in the placement of
Passeriformes. In TConsensus, the clade is relatively derived
in the tree, whereas in TOptimal it forms the basal-most
clade in Neoaves. Several traditionally hard-to-classify lineages (e.g. Pteroclidae, Opisthocomidae, Phaethontidae,
Podargidae and Steatornithidae) are of suspect placement
in TOptimal. These and other uncertainties tend to be localized and do not (as we report below) overly influence date
estimates for the basal nodes in the avian tree. Some of the
topological differences, however, are of operational
importance, as they cause either redundancy or obsolescence of some fossil constraints used in estimating divergence times. Overall, of the 18 total internal fossil
calibrations considered, 16 were used on TConsensus, and 17
on TOptimal (Figure 2).
Divergence time estimation
A substantial signal was present for both a departure from
a molecular clock and a lack of ancestor-descendant autocorrelation of substitution rates. Using penalized likelihood in r8s, both topologies TConsensus and TOptimal were
found to be unclock-like, with optimal smoothing values
(log10λ) of 1.0 and 0.4, respectively. Analyses in Dating5
clearly rejected the constant-rate Poisson model (-ln L =
63214.8; χ2 = 8051.61, df = 271, p = 0.000) but could not
reject the stationary (high variance) rate model (-ln L =
2123.01; χ2 = 268.352, df = 269, p = 0.482) which produced a large index of dispersion R = 469.782. Bayesian
analyses in Multidivtime delivered positive but very small
values for the degree of autocorrelation of substitution
rates across both topologies (Table 1). Finally, analyses of
TConsensus using BEAST indicated that non-autocorrelated
models of rate variation fit the data significantly better
than a molecular clock (Table 2). Of the non-autocorrelated models, the lognormal distribution (UCLN) had a
much better harmonic mean model likelihood than the
exponential distribution (UCED), and relaxation (TFlexible) of a fixed topology further increased fit. Using each of
these uncorrelated models, the covariance of substitution
rates between ancestor and descendent branches across
the tree was not significantly different from zero.

Given the extensive phylogenetic uncertainty within
Neornithes, we focus on divergence times of clades for
which monophyly is not contentious (Table 3). Two key
trends are recognized. First, for a given dating method, differences in topology tended to have a minor but systematic influence on inferred ages. In general, TOptimal
delivered older average date estimates than TConsensus using
r8s (8.9 MY) and Multidivtime (3.6 MY), but the opposite
trend was found with PATHd8 (-8.2 MY). When confidence/credibility intervals are considered, however, topology did not significantly influence most individual date
estimates. Overall, in terms of the degree of discrepancy
between fossil and molecular dates on a whole-tree basis
(average δRealized MA-FA), topology had a noticeable (> 5
MY) influence on divergence estimates for only the
PATHd8 analyses (Table 3).
Second, the choice of the relaxed clock method had a
strong influence on inferred ages. R8s, Multidivtime and
BEAST tended to deliver similar estimates for most clades
of interest (Table 3). In contrast, PATHd8 generated considerably younger dates with much smaller confidence
intervals, despite using the same bootstrapped phylograms and fossil constraints as r8s. Dating5 tended to produce the most extreme results, with inferred basal split
estimates similar to those from Multidivtime, but some
derived split estimates younger than those from PATHd8.
Most significantly, PATHd8 and Dating5 together identified five of these major clades as having crown diversification restricted to the Cenozoic (Ratites, Charadriiformes,
Procellariiformes, Cuculiformes and Apodiformes),
although the remaining methods generate estimates for
these same nodes that are on average more than 50%
older. In terms of comparing molecular and fossil age estimates (average δRealized MA-FA), r8s, Multidivtime and
BEAST all show considerable discordance between the
two sources of data, with the average molecular estimates
for the major nodes (Table 3) being 36–45 MY older than
corresponding fossil ages. PATHd8 and Dating5, in contrast, exhibit greater agreement between estimates from
'rocks' and 'clocks', with an average discrepancy of 17–25
MY.
Despite these differences, all methods agree that the basal
splits within Neornithes occurred deep within the Cretaceous (Table 3, nodes A-E). The youngest estimate for the
root of Neornithes (PATHd8, TOptimal) is of Early Cretaceous age, 37 MY older than the oldest undisputed neornithean fossil [10]. Conflict among methods instead
involves the diversification of derived lineages (Figures 3
and 4). Two patterns can be discerned. First, PATHd8 and
Dating5 support bursts of speciation (many lineages arising almost simultaneously), whereas the remaining methods generally support more gradual diversification.
Second, and more germane to the 'rock-clock' problem,

PATHd8 alone supports an extensive post-K-Pg radiation
of Neoaves. For example, from results of the non-autocorrelated rate models in BEAST allowing topological uncertainty (TFlexible; see Figure 4), not only are the basal splits
inferred to have occurred in the Cretaceous, but 37 credibility intervals (green bars) do not overlap the K-Pg
boundary. Finally, no support is shown for episodic evolution, either correlated with speciation events ([52]; no
effect) or an increase in inferred substitution rate either
during early diversification or following the K-Pg mass
extinction (Figure 5).

Discussion
Phylogenetic inference
Whether using fossil or molecular data, a daunting impediment to divergence time estimation in birds is that resolution of many inter-ordinal phylogenetic relationships
has proven obstinate, despite large data matrices with
multiple character types [53]. Although our reconstruction TOptimal is overly optimistic in being fully resolved, it
provides a useful alternative to the conservative TConsensus
(Figure 2).

TOptimal recovers several traditional orders as polyphyletic
(Caprimulgiformes, Coraciiformes, Falconiformes, Ciconiiformes), consistent with expectations [53] (but see
[54]). Although TOptimal has caprimulgiform (nightbirds)
families much more distantly related to one another than
previous morphological [55] and molecular [56] investigations, differences in taxon sampling confounds direct
comparison across studies. While Coraciiformes (kingfishers and relatives) is not found to be monophyletic, the
two recovered sub-groupings both fall within a larger
clade containing owls (Strigiformes), parrots (Psittaciformes) and woodpeckers and relatives (Piciformes). The
monophyletic status of the order Falconiformes has
received mixed support in previous analyses [54,57-61].
Placement of Falconidae in TOptimal is suspect and likely
stems from insufficient taxon sampling from this family
[62]. Regardless, no support was found for hypotheses
uniting falconiform taxa with owls (Strigiformes) [54] or
New World vultures (Cathartidae) with storks (Ciconiiformes) [61].
Several monotypic avian families have traditionally
proved difficult to classify. The enigmatic hoatzin
(Opisthocomidae) has variously been allied with at least
four distantly related orders (Galliformes, Cuculiformes,
Musophagiformes and Columbiformes; see [61,63]). We
find here an alliance with doves (Columbiformes), similar to joint analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
sequences [63]. The taxonomically problematic sandgrouse (family Pteroclidae) has alternatively been considered a member of Charadriiformes (shorebirds and allies
[61,64]) or Columbiformes [54,57,60]. Our reconstruction has the sandgrouse distantly related to both orders,
and instead allied with Falconiformes. This relationship is
unsupported elsewhere and we have little confidence in
this placement. The novel placement of the tropicbird
(family Phaethontidae) as sister to Sphenisciformes is
similarly suspect.
Finally, we find no support in our mtDNA analyses for the
neoavian clades 'Metaves' and 'Coronaves' identified from
nuclear β-fibrinogen intron analyses [58], although our
constraint tree allowed for this possibility (TConstraint; see
additional file 1). A major difference between these trees
involves the phylogenetic position of the perching birds
(Passeriformes); while nuclear DNA analyses recover Passeriformes as a relatively derived clade within 'Coronaves'
[57,58], in TOptimal they instead comprise the basal-most
lineage of Neoaves. This may be indicative of different
phylogenetic signals in nuclear versus mtDNA sequences,
as other mtDNA studies have also inferred a basal phylogenetic position of Passeriformes in Neoaves [65].

Uncertainty in tree topology and substitution rate
evolution
While TOptimal yields interesting hypotheses about avian
relationships, the focus of this study is on estimating basal
divergence times in Neornithes and we might regard
topology as a nuisance parameter (and explicitly so in the
BEAST TFlexible analyses). Topological error is usually not
considered in divergence time estimation, but potentially
could systematically bias age estimates through: (i) incorrect placement of fossil calibrations; and (ii) improper
estimation of branch lengths. Through our joint consideration of TConsensus and TOptimal, we find that topology does
have a systematic influence on inferred divergence times
for nodes of interest (Table 3), but that for the present
data set this influence differed in direction across methods
and was generally insignificant when confidence/credibility intervals were considered. Removal of the restriction of
a fixed topology in BEAST (TFlexible) yielded age estimates
similar to those from Multidivtime analyses assuming
TOptimal. Although yielding diffuse estimates, this 'relaxed
topology' approach better reflects uncertainty in the
underlying data.

An interesting result reported here is that rates of molecular evolution are found to be non-autocorrelated across
the Neornithes tree (Tables 1 and 2), a result previously
noted for virus and marsupial data sets [47]. An autocorrelation of rates would imply an inheritance of the trait

16.9

'rate of evolution'. This makes intuitive sense when considering that ancestor and descendant lineages are likely
similar in body size, generation time, DNA repair efficiency, population size and other traits influencing rates
of sequence evolution, and the most popular molecular
dating methods available indeed implicitly assume that
rates are autocorrelated across a tree [66,67]. However,
even if 'rate of evolution' is heritable, nodes separated by
long periods of time may accumulate sufficient rate variation that autocorrelation in this trait will break down.
Alternatively, 'rate of evolution' may simply be more
labile than we expect. Regardless, violation of an implicit
autocorrelation assumption did not have significant
effects on inferred dates for nodes of interest (Table 3). For
example, r8s and Multidivtime, which each deal with rate
variation in an ancestor-descendant fashion, deliver age
estimates that match quite closely to those generated by
BEAST, which does not make such an assumption.
Antiquity of basal avian lineages
All methods employed here agree that the basal divergences within Neornithes occurred in the Cretaceous
(Table 3, nodes A-E), supporting the refutation of a Cenozoic origin of modern lineages [8,9] mandated by the discovery of the 66 MY duck Vegavis iaai [10], which
minimally forces five basal divergences into the Cretaceous. Moreover, our results are not dependent on this
oldest fossil calibration, as analyses in r8s, PATHd8 and

Multidivtime without using the Vegavis constraint
returned nearly identical results to those reported here
(data not shown); indeed, we must paradoxically conclude that this oldest undisputed neornithean fossil was
essentially uninformative in our molecular dating analyses. Given the consensus across 'relaxed clock' methods
employing very different assumptions about how molecular substitution rate evolves, we regard an Early Cretaceous origin of Neornithes as robustly supported. This
inferred Cretaceous origin, and consequent survival of
several avian lineages across the K-Pg boundary [68], is
consistent with previous molecular studies [4,16-26] and
is supported by historical biogeography reconstructions
[69].
An explanation occasionally offered for the antiquity of
molecular dates is that rates of sequence change may
speed up during radiations [33], consistent with a basic
tenet of punctuated equilibrium theory where most character change is concomitant with speciation [70], possibly
resulting from stochastic effects during founder effect speciation [52,71]. If true, an elevated number of molecular
substitutions recorded during diversification could erroneously be interpreted as a longer time span at a slower
background rate, resulting in a systematic overestimation
of divergence times for all nodes predating the radiation.
Some evidence exists for a correlation between speciation
and character evolution [52,72-74], although a study of
island radiations failed to detect such an effect [75]. While

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/6

punctuated molecular evolution may be less frequent in
animals (18% of cases versus 44% and 60% in plants and
fungi, respectively [52]), this effect is nevertheless a prime
candidate to explain the strong and persistent discrepancy
between molecular- and fossil-based divergence estimates. However, we find no signal for punctuated (speciational) molecular evolution [52] in the present data set.
In addition, we fail to detect an accelerated rate associated
with either the K-Pg boundary or during the initial diversification of Neornithes (Figure 5). If rates of sequence
change were strongly influenced by diversification, we
would expect clear departures from the inferred mean
standardized substitution rate [76]. Although Cenozoic
rates tend to be more variable than Mesozoic (ancestral)
rates, we find no evidence for an obvious acceleration in
substitution rate associated with any of the major nodes
for any genetic partition. Although these two approaches
to identifying episodic evolution would ideally involve
more comprehensive taxon sampling, if punctuated evolution were primarily responsible for inflating inferred
molecular dates then we likely would have detected the
effect with the present data matrix.
Rather than narrowing the formidable 'rock-clock' gap
through application of methods designed to minimize
biases and accommodate uncertainty, we have instead
considerably reinforced it. In part, the discordant age estimates can be explained through reference to the genuine
time-lag (δTrue MA-FA; see Figure 1) between the divergence
of genetic lineages (predating speciation) and the evolution of diagnostic morphological characters (postdating
speciation). However, given the estimated magnitude of
δRealized MA-FA (Table 3), it is unlikely that δTrue MA-FA alone
explains the dissonance. One the one hand, while the fossil record may be adequate for many evolutionary questions [28], there are clear instances where it is not. The 66
MY Vegavis iaai [10], for example, requires the coexistence
of Paleognathae representatives; however, Cretaceous
paleognaths are unknown. This may be a result of a geographical bias in fossil sampling favouring the northern
hemisphere [2,17,69,77-79], as many taxa are hypothesized as having southern hemisphere (Gondwana) origins
[69]. Although fossil gap analysis implies that a Cretaceous origin of several avian orders is unlikely [11], this
method improperly assumes that fossils are randomly distributed (uniformly recovered through time) since the origin of a taxon; alternative fossil recovery curves can
support very different scenarios, including scenarios that
are more consistent with molecular genetic timelines [80],
even when the fossil record is particularly sparse [31].
Although rightly considered with caution, the increasing
number of fragmentary remains of putative neornithean
lineages from the Cretaceous [78] lends credence to the
ancient origin and diversification of Neornithes. On the
other hand, there may yet be some unrecognized biases in

the analysis of molecular genetic sequences, and our
results suggest new directions for future avian divergence
time studies (described below).
Radiation of Neornithes
Despite broad agreement on the antiquity of basal divergences in Neornithes, arbitration among macroevolutionary models [1-4] to best describe the history of more
derived lineages is complicated by disparity amongst various 'relaxed clock' results. Two important points of distinction can be recognized (Figures 3 and 4). First,
Dating5 (overdispersed clock) and PATHd8 (rate smoothing across sister lineages) both infer bursts of speciation
across the avian tree, while r8s (smoothing in an ancestordescendant fashion), Multidivtime (Bayesian modelling
of ancestor-descendant autocorrelated rate evolution) and
BEAST (Bayesian modelling of rate evolution without an
autocorrelation assumption or fixed topology) instead
infer a more gradual diversification of Neornithes. Second, PATHd8 alone supports a prominent radiation of
avian families in the Cenozoic, a scenario statistically
rejected in many instances by the remaining four analyses.
Although published PATHd8 divergence time estimates
for Neoaves using nuclear DNA produced similarly young
estimates [57], a reanalysis of these same data using Multidivtime roundly refuted the findings [16], echoing the
incongruence of PATHd8 reported here. While the better
reconciliation between molecular and fossil age estimates
that PATHd8 offers seems satisfying at first, the unique
discrepancy of this method from the other much more rigorous and biologically realistic methods raises concern.

Given the apparent lack of autocorrelation of substitution
rates, together with the intrinsic topological uncertainty in
the Neornithes tree, the analyses in BEAST best reflect our
current understanding of early avian evolution (Figure 4).
Without the restrictive assumptions inherent in other
'relaxed clock' methods, these analyses unambiguously
support a Cretaceous origin and diversification of basal
avian lineages. Even when considering large inferred credibility intervals, 37 early avian divergences are restricted to
the Cretaceous, similar to that found through the analysis
of nuclear DNA sequences [16]. It should be noted, however, that these nodes mostly represent order- and superfamily-level divergences; the majority of families sampled
here (80 of 100 in BEAST) have their origins either overlapping or restricted to the Paleogene, consistent with
interpretations from the fossil record [77]. In this respect,
our results are similar to those inferred from a comprehensive study of the tempo of early mammalian evolution
[81]. The results of both studies indicate that significant
cladogenesis occurred in the Cretaceous, but that many
crown groups diversified in the Cenozoic.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/6

Future progress
While there is a growing consensus for the Cretaceous origin of many Neornithes orders and families, the rate and
timing of their diversification (and the influence of the KPg mass extinctions upon that diversification) is not yet
resolved. MtDNA may have further utility in making
progress on the problem, as our analysis of posterior credibility interval widths indicates that longer sequences
would likely improve divergence time estimates (Figure
6). However, we recognize that mtDNA is limited in that
all sites belong to a single 'super-locus', and so a significant reduction of uncertainty (e.g. the slope in Figure 6)
will ultimately require the supplement of multiple independent nuclear loci. In addition, while the present study
was focused at the family level, increased taxon sampling
will break up long branches (benefiting phylogenetic
reconstruction) and improve branch length estimates.
Nevertheless, our results suggest fertile ground for future
molecular research into this problem. For example, we
find that: (i) variation in the number of substitutions
across branches can be accommodated by a high variance
stationary-rate model [82]; and (ii) rates are not autocorrelated across the avian tree in an ancestor-descendent
fashion. This suggests potential for development of a
hybrid model that accommodates both pieces of information and that future studies test assumptions of rate autocorrelation before invoking them, at least for the tree
depth that we consider here.

In regards to the 'rock-clock' debate [33,49], we feel that
much of the perceived dissonance between fossil- and
molecular-based age estimates stems from a comparison

of different phylogenetic entities: molecular phylogeneticists generally deal with stem-group origins, while paleontologists generally concentrate on crown-group
diversification [4]. Moreover, it is too rarely emphasized
that when dating the same node a genuine discrepancy is
expected, as coalescent times (Tgene; see Figure 1) will predate cladogenesis while morphological diversification
(Tmorphology; see Figure 1) will postdate cladogenesis. The
reality is that in normal practice neither group directly
addresses the main parameter of interest, the timing of
speciation (Tspecies; see Figure 1), the pattern of which is
essential to the understanding of the origins of biodiversity. However, tools do exist to better estimate speciation
times from both fossils (e.g. accounting for 'ghost' lineages [31]) and genetic data (e.g. explicitly modelling
ancestral effective population sizes to account for coalescent times [83]). Further, molecular methods can be augmented with greater information from the fossil record,
possibly by incorporating models of preservation bias
into temporal constraints [31]. Newly developed methods
exist where probability distributions can be applied to calibrated nodes in a Bayesian framework [47,84,85].
Although we recognize that this approach is superior in
that it can lend more credence to the fossil record than
standard minimum-age constraints, we refrained from
using such methods here as there is currently insufficient
information with which to specify meaningful prior distributions for most avian diversification times. Realization
of such distributions will require more communication
between paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists
[86,87].

Conclusion
One possible explanation for the discrepancy between
molecular and fossil data in dating early divergences of
avian lineages has been that the genetic data have been
misinterpreted. In this vein, the ancient age estimates
reported from previous molecular studies are seen as artefacts of oversimplified or improperly executed methods.
Here we have examined this conjecture by accommodating uncertainty in genetic divergence time estimates.
Through analyses of a large mtDNA matrix using multiple
cladistically tested calibrations, alterative tree topologies
and several sophisticated relaxed clock methods we have
found that the molecular estimates are robust to varying

assumptions about the evolution of evolutionary rates
and consistent with those from previous studies. Our
findings thus strongly support pre-K-Pg genetic origins for
multiple modern bird lineages, including various extant
orders and families, in contrast to the model of post-K-Pg
diversification derived from a narrow interpretation of the
fossil record.

Methods
Molecular sequence data
The molecular data set comprises 135 avian species and
100 traditionally recognized families, as well as five outgroup taxa (turtles, n = 3; crocodilians, n = 2; see Additional file 2). The names for avian taxa shown in our
figures and tables generally follow Gill and Wright [88].
Turtles were used solely to root phylogenies and were not
used for dating purposes. For each taxon a total of 5248
base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was
either sequenced directly using primers reported by or
modified from [89] or downloaded from GenBank. mtDNAs from taxa newly collected by us and first reported
here
(GenBank

numbers
EU372666–EU372688,
EU166921–EU167086,
EU391159). Protein-coding genes were aligned at the
amino acid level, while RNA genes were aligned as nucleotides using secondary structure models following [90].
From the original matrix, 654 alignment positions could
not be aligned unambiguously and so were excluded from
subsequent analyses, yielding a final matrix of 4594 bp
(Table 4).
Fossil calibration points
We include as many fossil calibration points as possible in
disparate parts of the avian tree to maximize information
from the fossil record, and reduce dependency on any one
calibration estimate. Given that serious bias can result if
even a single fossil has been misdiagnosed in its taxonomic affinity, we limit our calibration points to those
fossils that have been rigorously analyzed in a cladistic
context (Table 5). Our fossil calibrations are nearly identical to those used by Brown et al [16], which is a modification of the fossil complement used by Ericson et al [57].
These internal avian calibration points are all implemented as minimum age constraints in the various dating
analyses. We also use two bounded external calibrations

[91]. This last calibration has recently been independently
supported by molecular data using soft calibration
bounds [92].
Phylogenetic trees and branch length uncertainty
Inferring dates on an incorrect tree topology will lead to
estimates that are suspect, if not wholly incorrect. We seek
to accommodate the existing uncertainty about avian phylogenetic relationships by dating nodes on two alternative
trees. The first topology considered is taken from Figure
27.10 of Cracraft et al [53], which is a consensus tree
based on previous molecular- and morphology-based
phylogenetic reconstructions. This tree is conservative in
that all represented branching events are well supported
by independent lines of evidence; uncertain relationships
among lineages are presented as hard polytomies. This
topology is referred to as TConsensus. The second topology
considered was derived from a partitioned-model maximum likelihood search using the program RAxML-VIHPC 2.2.3 [93]. The data were divided into four partitions: first, second and third codon positions of mitochondrial cytochrome-b, ND1 and ND2 genes, and
concatenated mitochondrial 12S rDNA and tRNA genes
(L, I, Q, M, W, A, N, C, Y). A collapsed consensus tree
derived from Cracraft et al (thick branches only of Figure
27.10 in [53]) was used as a backbone constraint to make
tree searches more efficient (TConstraint; see Additional file

1). Several hundred heuristic searches were performed
under the GTRMIX model assuming a range of values for
both the initial rearrangement setting (i; range 5–20) and
number of rate categories (c; range 5–25). The topology of
the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is referred to as
TOptimal.
For the non-Bayesian dating methods, we accommodate
uncertainty in branch length estimation through a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. For each original
data partition, 100 pseudoreplicate datasets were generated using the program SEQBOOT of the PHYLIP 3.6
package [94]; these bootstrapped matrices were concatenated to produce 100 pseudomatrices with the same size
and number of partition-specific characters as the original
matrix. For TOptimal, branch lengths and substitution
model parameters were estimated using a partitioned
GTR+G model in RAxML. For TConsensus, branch lengths
and all substitution model parameters were estimated
from each bootstrap matrix on the fixed topology using
the GTR+I+G substitution model in PAUP* [95] because
RAxML cannot evaluate a tree containing mutlifurcations.
Using these procedures we generated 100 trees with
branch lengths (phylograms) for each topology.
Divergence time estimates using relaxed molecular clocks
Owing to the concern that assumptions of particular analytical methods may systematically bias divergence time
estimates, we compare several methods for accommodating among-lineage rate heterogeneity for the purpose of
estimating the divergence times of modern avian lineages.
To facilitate direct comparison, all methods utilize the
same fossil calibrations and tree topologies outlined
above.

First, the program r8s 1.7 [66] was used to estimate rates
and dates for internal nodes in the phylogeny via penalized likelihood (PL). This semiparametric procedure combines a parametric model that allows for different rates on
each branch in the tree [96] with a non-parametric penalty
function that penalizes rates that change too quickly
along the tree from ancestor to descendent branches [97];
a smoothing parameter (λ) determines the relative contribution of the penalty function. The optimal smoothing
value was determined individually for each topology
through a sequence-based cross-validation procedure [96]
using penalty = add and the normalized (χ2) errors. Confirmation of the optimal smoothing values was obtained
via multiple optimizations with different initial conditions (by setting num_restarts = num_time_guesses = 3).
Confidence intervals for node ages were determined using
the distribution of estimated ages across bootstrapped
trees assuming the optimal smoothing value from the
original phylograms. Summary of the mean estimate and

Page 13 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2008, 6:6

associated error for a given node was accomplished using
the profile command in r8s.
Second, the program PATHd8 [98,99] also smoothes rates
across the tree, but does so by calculating an average path
length from an internal node to all its descending terminals; deviations from a molecular clock are corrected
through reference to fossil calibrations. Important distinctions from r8s above are that PATHd8 smoothes rates
between sister groups (rather than from ancestor to
descendent nodes) and it does this locally rather than over
the entire tree. The same 100 phylograms as analyzed with
r8s above were used to generate confidence intervals on
divergence times, although summary statistics were calculated manually.
As a third approach, the Bayesian MULTIDISTRIBUTE
package [100] represents an attempt to explicitly model
rate change across a tree [67,101,102]. Here, the logarithm of the rate at the end of a branch is modelled with a
normal distribution, the mean of which has an expected
value equal to the rate at the beginning of the branch;
thus, rates are implicitly assumed to be autocorrelated
from ancestor to descendent nodes, although this autocorrelation may decay with increasing branch lengths. The
posterior probability distribution of divergence times is
approximated by samples from a Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) chain. The data were partitioned as noted
above. For each partition, estimates of the transition/
transversion rate ratio and the gamma site class-specific
rates under the F84+G model (the most complex model
supported by the MULTIDISTRIBUTE package) were calculated in the baseml program of the PAML 3.15 package
[103]. The output from baseml was used as the input for
the MULTIDISTRIBUTE program estbranches, which produced MLEs of branch lengths and their approximate variance-covariance matrix. Although differing in branching
order, TConsensus and TOptimal had similar overall tree
lengths; as a result, the same priors were applied to both
topologies in the program Multidivtime: rtrate = rtratesd =
0.012, and brownmean = brownmeansd = 0.01. As one of
our external calibration points bounds the root node
(crocodile-bird split at 251-243 MY), date priors were less
important and were defined narrowly (bigtime = 255 MY,
rttm = 247 MY, rttmsd = 1.5 MY). The program was run
without the assumption of correlated changes in rates
across data partitions. Following a burnin of 106 samples,
104 samples were taken at a sampling interval of 102. All
analyses were repeated with different inseed values to
check for convergence of the MCMC chain.
Fourth, the overdispersed clock method of Cutler [82]
represents a strong departure from other approaches to
dating in the way it models branch length heterogeneity.
Instead of treating a variable number of substitutions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/6

across lineages as indicative of changes in substitution rate
across the tree, Cutler's method assumes that rate is stationary, but with high variance. Thus, rather than assuming that the number of substitutions along a lineage is
Poisson distributed (where the variance is equal to the
mean), the observed variation across branches is accommodated by the larger variance afforded through a Gaussian distribution. As a result, branches with either
particularly high or low numbers of substitutions need
not be clustered on the tree; in other words, heritability
(phylogeny) plays no role in the observed numbers of
substitutions. The program Dating5 [104] calculates χ2
statistics for both the constant-rate Poisson and stationary
models and compares the overall fit of the models using a
likelihood ratio test. In addition, the program calculates
R, the index of dispersion (the ratio of the variance to the
mean number of substitutions) under the stationary
model. Dating was restricted to TOptimal as the current version of Dating5 does not allow for polytomies. In addition, we could not achieve likelihood convergence with
the partitioned data, and so reported results are from concatenated sequences. From asymptotic likelihood theory,
95% confidence intervals were calculated using a threshold of 2 log likelihood units around the MLE.
Finally, the program BEAST 1.4.6 [105] differs in two
important ways from the dating methods listed above.
First, it does not require a fixed topology; rather, branch
lengths, topology, substitution model parameters and
dates can be estimated simultaneously. This incorporation of uncertainty in topology may be particularly important for the present data set, where relationships amongst
many clades are uncertain. Second, BEAST does not
assume that substitution rates are necessarily autocorrelated across the tree. Although intuitively satisfying, autocorrelation of rates has not been demonstrated in the
literature; in fact, Drummond et al [47] report that many
empirical data sets do not exhibit significant autocorrelation of rates.
BEAST 1.4.6 offers two statistical distributions for describing the change in rate across a branch [47]: rates can be
drawn independently from either an exponential distribution (UCED) or a lognormal distribution (UCLN). To find
which distribution fit the present data best, we initially
fixed the tree topology to TConsensus. The data were partitioned as above, with each partition assigned a GTR+I+G
substitution model. BEAST MCMC runs of 25 × 106 generations following a burnin of 105 generations were performed for UCED, UCLN and CLOCK models. To
arbitrate between models, we calculated Bayes factors by
comparing harmonic mean model likelihoods [106]. For
both non-autocorrelated models, we also calculated the
covariance among branch rates, which indicates the
degree of ancestor-descendant autocorrelation of rates

across the tree. Using the optimal model, we then accommodated topological uncertainty by removing the restriction of a fixed tree. However, we did constrain certain
clades (the backbone constraints described above) to be
monophyletic to facilitate the placement of calibration
points and increase the efficiency of the MCMC search.
Three replicate runs of 25 × 106 generations were performed to check for convergence of the MCMC chain.
Mean parameter estimates and 95% highest posterior
densities (HPDs) were determined through analyzing the
combined BEAST tree files in TreeAnnotator 1.4.6 [107].
We refer to these results with the topology TFlexible.
For each of the five dating methods above we calculated
the average discrepancy between molecular (MA) and fossil (FA) estimated ages for those nodes that had fossil calibrations. The MA used in these calculations was the mean
estimate from MCMC samples (Multidivtime, BEAST), or
the optimal estimate from the empirical data matrix (r8s,
PATHd8, Dating5). The value MA-FA is equivalent to δRealized MA-FA described above, and gives an indication of the
degree of agreement between the molecular data and the
fossil record.
Episodic evolution and information content
If present, episodic (or punctuated) molecular evolution
could seriously bias molecular genetic estimates of divergence time by systematically overestimating the ages of all
nodes that preceded the punctuation. We therefore tested
for the presence of episodic evolution in two ways. First,
we used the method of Pagel et al [52,108] which quantifies the proportional contribution of punctuated (β) and
gradual (g) evolution to path lengths in a phylogeny,
based on extent of association between sequence change
and cladogenesis events. This method requires a fully
bifurcating tree, and so analyses were limited to our optimal reconstruction TOptimal. To test for this signature we
analyzed maximum likelihood trees from RAxML bootstrap analyses (n = 100). Second, to test whether substitution rate accelerated coincident with or following the K-Pg
boundary we plotted standardized inferred substitution
rate (per data partition) versus inferred divergence time
from the Multidivtime analyses above. If the K-Pg boundary extinctions facilitated diversification of avian higherlevel taxa, it could produce a spike in this plot [76]
detected as a departure from the mean standardized rate.
These two tests are complementary in that the first focuses
specifically on the effects of speciation, whereas the second focuses on absolute time effects, which may or may
not be related to speciation.

As in the case of episodic evolution, a simple lack of historical signal present in molecular sequences could generate erroneous divergence time estimates. We therefore
assessed the 'information content' present in our mtDNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/6

matrix by regressing posterior 95% credibility width
against posterior mean divergence time. When the when
the amount of data is saturated then this regression will
produce a linear relationship (i.e. R2 → 1), the slope of
which indicates the amount of uncertainty that cannot be
reduced through adding longer sequences [7,85], but can
be reduced through adding independent loci.
