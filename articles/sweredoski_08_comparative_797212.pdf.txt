Abstract
Background: Helitrons are DNA transposable elements that are proposed to replicate via a rolling
circle mechanism. Non-autonomous helitron elements have captured gene fragments from many
genes in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) but only a handful of genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
This observation suggests very different histories for helitrons in these two species, but it is unclear
which species contains helitrons that are more typical of plants.
Results: We performed computational searches to identify helitrons in maize and rice genomic
sequence data. Using 12 previously identified helitrons as a seed set, we identified 23 helitrons in
maize, five of which were polymorphic among a sample of inbred lines. Our total sample of maize
helitrons contained fragments of 44 captured genes. Twenty-one of 35 of these helitrons did not
cluster with other elements into closely related groups, suggesting substantial diversity in the maize
element complement. We identified over 552 helitrons in the japonica rice genome. More than 70%
of these were found in a collinear location in the indica rice genome, and 508 clustered as a single
large subfamily. The japonica rice elements contained fragments of only 11 genes, a number similar
to that in Arabidopsis. Given differences in gene capture between maize and rice, we examined
sequence properties that could contribute to differences in capture rates, focusing on 3'
palindromes that are hypothesized to play a role in transposition termination. The free energy of
folding for maize helitrons were significantly lower than those in rice, but the direction of the
difference differed from our prediction.
Conclusion: Maize helitrons are clearly unique relative to those of rice and Arabidopsis in the
prevalence of gene capture, but the reasons for this difference remain elusive. Maize helitrons do
not seem to be more polymorphic among individuals than those of Arabidopsis; they do not appear
to be substantially older or younger than the helitrons in either species; and our analyses provided
little evidence that the 3' hairpin plays a role.

Background
Traditionally, transposable elements (TEs) have been classified as either Class I or Class II [1]. Class I, or retroelements, transpose through an RNA intermediate. This

group includes both long-terminal repeat (LTR) transposons and non-long-terminal repeat retrotransposons
[2]. Class II elements transpose via DNA, include inverted
repeats [3], and often leave a "footprint" after excision [4Page 1 of 13

6]. The two classes of transposable elements share at least
two features: first, both duplicate host sequences during
integration into the host genome, and second, the 3' end
of the insertion is either a duplicate of the 5' end or a poly
(A) tail [1].
In 2001, Kapitonov and Jurka identified a new group of
eukarotyic DNA TEs in eukaryotes that they named helitrons [7]. Helitrons are DNA elements that are proposed to
move via a rolling circle replication mechanism similar to
that of some prokaryotic transposable elements [8]. They
are unique in that they do not duplicate host insertion
sites and do not contain terminal repeats. They can also be
quite large, up to 15 kb or more [9]. However, helitrons do
have two conserved sequence features. First, they tend to
insert between Adenine and Thymidine residues. Second,
they have conserved ends consisting of TC on the 5' end
and CTRR on the 3' end, often with a palindromic
sequence of 16–20 bp near the 3' terminus. Because they
do not replicate by the "cut and paste" method of most
class II elements, helitrons were initially difficult to classify
and were considered their own class. They have now been
assigned as a separate subclass of class II TEs [1].
Non-autonomous helitrons are common in eukaryotic
genomes, representing ~2–3% of genomes in species as
diverse as Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Caenorabditis
elegans and bats (Myotis lucifugus) [7,10,11], but they are
arguably most interesting in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays),
where they contribute to substantial differences in gene
order and content among individuals [12,13]. For example, the bronze region features extensive sequence nonhomologies among maize inbred lines [14], in large part
due to non-autonomous helitron insertions. Remarkably,
much of this non-homology represents expressed gene
fragments that have been captured within non-autonomous elements. Gene capture appears to be both widespread and frequent. For example, just four helitrons were
found to contain fragments that originated from at least
seven genes [15]. Moreover, overgo hybridization suggests
that as many as 10,000 genes or gene fragments may be
unshared between inbred lines, perhaps due to helitron
activity [16]. The presence of expressed gene fragments
within helitrons highlights their potential to contribute to
functional, as well as structural, diversity within plant
genomes [9,13,15-18].
The observations in maize provide a puzzling contrast to
observations in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis contains >1000
non-autonomous helitrons, many of which were initially
catalogued as Basho elements [19]. Like helitrons in maize,
many A. thaliana elements contain gene fragments. Unlike
maize, however, these fragments appear to represent only
a small number of gene capture events [20]. This contrast
between maize and Arabidopsis raises a number of impor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/467

tant questions about the evolution of helitrons and their
role in gene capture. First, are the small numbers of maize
helitrons characterized thus far typical with respect to the
extent of gene capture, or could the apparent differences
between species be due to the small number of helitrons
isolated from maize thus far? Second, if one examines a
third experimental system, like rice (Oryza sativa), do
maize or Arabidopsis helitrons appear to be more typical
with respect to gene capture? Third, if there are real differences in gene capture between maize and other plant species, can one glean any clues as to the mechanistic or
evolutionary factors that contribute to these differences?

Results
Helitron identification and polymorphism in maize
We used a BLAST-based approach to identify helitrons
from maize genomic data (Figure 1). Our search began
with a training set of 12 maize 'seed' elements from the literature [12,15,21,22], from which we isolated both 5' and
3' ends as BLAST queries. These queries were 80 bp in
length, but generally yielded ~40 bp matches corresponding to helitron ends (Figure 1). This approach was applied
iteratively, accruing additional BLAST queries, until no
more ends were detected (see Methods). After careful consideration of redundancy in Genbank entries, we produced a curated set of 23 predicted maize helitrons, with a
mean length of 3648 base pairs and a range from 718 bp
to 7847 bp. We combined our predicted helitrons with the
12 query sequences to produces a total set of 35 maize helitrons (Table S1).

Before drawing conclusions from our predicted set of
maize helitrons, it is important to examine the properties
of the predicted elements. We first examined the 3' and 5'
ends for features characteristic of helitrons (Figure 2). To
date, maize helitrons have had 5' ends marked by insertion
next to a flanking 'A' and a beginning sequence of 'TCT',
followed by a 13 bp pattern without a strong consensus
[18]. Du et al. [23] recently used this 18 bp pattern,
including sequence ambiguities, to identify potential 5'
ends of helitrons in maize genomic sequence. Our collection of 35 putative elements perfectly reflect the search
pattern of Du et al. (2008), but also clearly indicate a lack
of strong consensus nucleotides at residues 10 to 14 (Figure 2). Similarly, our sample of predicted helitrons reflect
the recognized preference for helitrons to terminate in
'CTAGT', and the 3' ~30 bp motif also match the maize
consensus [23,24]. Although our search began with a seed
set that reflected particular properties, there is no guarantee that our BLAST strategy would return strong signals in
the particular residues that have previously been defined
as typical of helitrons. Moreover, these patterns are qualitatively indistinguishable when the 12 'seed' helitrons are
removed from consideration (data not shown). In addition to 5' and 3' motifs, our results clearly indicate the lack

Approximately 40 bp were isolated from 5' and 3' ends of known helitrons, along with ~40 bp of flanking sequence. These ends
were used as blast queries to Plant Genbank; hits to both ends that were <20,000 bp apart (represented by light blue-grey
boxes with attaching arrows) were considered putative helitrons. These putative helitrons were screened for redundant or
overlapping entries (pink box) to yield predicted helitrons. See Methods for details.

of consensus nucleotides in flanking genomic sequences,
except for the strong (but not absolute) bias toward inserting downstream from an 'A' (Figure 2).
Because maize helitrons were first identified by comparisons of sequence data between maize inbred lines [14],
we next assessed polymorphism among maize individuals. We attempted to survey our 23 predicted helitrons with
a PCR assay of eight maize inbred lines (see Methods). We
were unable to amplify single bands consistently for eight
of the predicted helitrons, and so could not unambiguously assess polymorphism for these presumptive helitrons. Another eight were fixed in the panel of eight maize
inbred lines, and polymorphism could not be verified in
a broader germplasm set, either due to a lack of polymorphism or poor amplification properties. However, five helitrons were polymorphic in the sample of inbred lines.
Thus, 5 of our 23 predicted helitrons (21%) were confirmed to be polymorphic.
We next used the 5' and 3' ends from our panel of 35 putative maize helitrons to build profile HMM models (see
Methods) and used the models to scan all maize genomic
sequences in Genbank. We found that the recall rate,
which is a measure of sensitivity, was very low (data not
shown), indicating that the HMM could not effectively
model the 5' and 3' maize motifs. The failure of the HMM
approach may indicate that maize harbors a broad diversity of helitron subfamilies with widely variable 3' and 5'
ends (see Discussion).
Helitron identification and polymorphism in rice
While conducting our Blast-based search for maize helitrons in Genbank, we also discovered 23 putative helitrons
in genomic rice sequences. Mirroring our approach for
maize, we used the 5' and 3' ends from this panel of putative rice helitrons to build profile HMMs and used the
models to scan two separate sources: genomic sequences
of indica and japonica rice. In contrast to the HMM application to maize, the rice HMMs achieved a much higher
recall rate, suggesting that rice helitrons may share extensive sequence similarity. The HMM models identified 552
putative helitron elements in the japonica rice genome
(Table S2), and 604 elements in the indica rice genome. To
determine whether we would expect to identify 552 elements based on chance alone, we constructed randomized rice genomes with the same length and
compositional properties of japonica rice (see Methods)
and reapplied the HMM. In five randomized genomes, the
HMM failed to identify a single helitron, thus illustrating
that our findings are not expected due to random hits to a
genomic sequence of similar length and composition.

Because the helitron components from the rice genomes
were similar and because the japonica genome is better

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/467

annotated, we focused on the set of japonica elements for
description. The mean length of predicted japonica helitrons was 441 bp, with 97% of these under 1.0 kb in length
and at least two of the longest (> 3 kb) containing internal
retrotransposons. None of the putative helitrons appear to
be autonomous, based both on length and on BLASTn
comparisons to putative helicase genes (data not shown).
We examined the 5' and 3' ends of predicted rice helitrons,
just as we examined them in maize (Figure 2). The rice helitrons generally yield stronger consensus motifs, with
nucleotide biases extending for ~30 bp on the 5' end and
11 bp on the 3' end. Nonetheless, there are shared features
of the motifs between maize and rice, particularly the 5'
'TCT' and the 3' 'CTAGT'. We also examined the regions
flanking rice helitrons. Like maize, the helitrons exhibited a
preference for a 5' flanking 'A' nucleotide. The 3' flanking
sequences were markedly A+T rich, which is also a preference in maize but less pronounced (Figure 2).
The strong motif pattern in rice terminal regions suggested
that we had uncovered a well-conserved group of helitrons.
To pursue this suspicion, we separated the putative helitrons into single-linkage clusters, yielding one particularly
large cluster of 508 elements for which we constructed a
neighbor-joining tree (Figure 3). With this tree, we were
able to infer approximate times of element insertion.
Using the terminal branch lengths (TBLs) in the phylogeny as a proxy for time, and assuming a molecular clock
with a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.3 × 10-8 substitutions per site per year [25], we estimate the mean insertion
time for elements is ~5.1 million years ago. One interesting feature of this analysis was that there were very few
short TBLs (Figure 3), which suggests a lack of recent helitron activity. The overall impression is that of a large family of helitron elements in rice that have not been
particularly active in the very recent past.
We assessed polymorphism of rice helitrons computationally by comparing their locations between the japonica
and indica genomes. To first determine orthology between
helitrons, we compared 100 bp flanking each side of each
helitron between genomes (see Methods). Assuming no
genomic rearrangements between japonica and indica,
orthologous helitrons should not only share flanking
regions but also be in the same chromosome, on the same
strand and between the same bordering flanking regions.
Given this definition of orthology and a subsequent list of
possible orthologous pairings, we used the maximal noncrossing matching algorithm [26] to find the one-to-one
mapping with the largest cardinality. Using this approach,
we estimate that 404 of the 552 japonica (73%) elements
are found in the same location within the indica genome.
For the 27% of japonica helitrons that were not found in the
same location indica, it was not always clear if the helitron
is truly polymorphic between genomes or if data were

Estimated insertion times of rice helitrons. The histogram of rice insertion times (left), which is based on terminal branch
lengths (TBLs) from the phylogeny of the 508 elements in the largest rice subfamily, suggests that most helitrons in rice do not
result from recent insertion events. A clade of the phylogeny is shown (right) to illustrate the general property that most TBLs

missing in one of the two genome sequences. However,
some helitrons were polymorphic between japonica and
indica with insertion sites at the predicted 3' and 5' boundaries (Fig. S1), as might be expected of recently inserted
elements. Thus, our 27% estimate contains some true polymorphisms, but this figure is also the upper limit of helitron polymorphism between the japonica and indica
genomes. The true value could be substantially lower.
Characterization of captured coding sequences
We compared our sample of maize and japonica rice helitrons to three data sources – plant ESTs, plant CDSs, and
plant genomic data – to identify gene capture events. The
maize helitrons had hundreds of hits to EST data, but it was
not always possible to determine whether this was due to
homology to a known protein, due to transcription of
portions of the helitron, or due to other unknown factors.
We thus adopted conservative criteria to identify gene cap-

ture events: i) matches were only scored with length criteria (> 50 bp) at stringent cutoffs (e-value < e-10) and ii)
gene capture was only noted if homology with CDS or
genomic data included a clearly annotated gene or exon.
Even with these conservative criteria, gene capture is
clearly rampant within maize, as noted previously
[14,15]. We identified 44 genes that had been captured by
helitrons (Table 1). Many of the capture events were shared
among our predicted and 'seed' helitrons, suggesting that
our search yielded predicted elements with internal similarities to confirmed helitrons. Multiple exons were captured for several of the genes. As these capture events were
duplicated via transposition, some portions of the capture
event were lost from template copies, resulting in helitrons
that retain different portions of the same gene capture
event. For example, a 600 bp piece of the oleosin KD18
gene has been captured in helitrons 10, 15, 20, and 27, but
only the last 280 bp of this sequence is present in helitrons

24 and 29, while helitron 11 contains only the first 90 bp
(Table 1).
In stark contrast to maize, we found evidence for only 11
unique gene capture events in the 552 japonica rice helitrons. Portions of these 11 genes are found in 92% (508
of 552) of the predicted elements. Six of the 11 genes are
distributed widely, in that portions of each of these genes
can be detected in ~200 elements (Table 2). It also is not

originated from more than one of the eleven genes – i.e.,
61% (337 of the 552) of the predicted elements house
genic fragments that originated from two genes. For example, portions of both the dextrinase gene and the ribosomal S12 gene are found in 121 elements. Overall, these
data paint a picture of rice helitrons in which gene capture
is infrequent but individual capture events are distributed
by transposition (and perhaps recombination between
elements) throughout the genome. In this respect, our
sample of non-autonomous rice helitrons are more similar
to those in Arabidopsis than those in maize. Only five
gene capture events were identified in 565 Arabidopsis
helitrons, but they too were distributed in many copies
throughout the genome [20].
Comparative analysis of 3' palindrome folding properties
Maize helitrons contain more vestiges of genes than either
rice or Arabidopsis helitrons; we postulated that this difference could be mechanistic and perhaps reflected by
sequence characteristics among species. More specifically,
3' palindromes of helitrons are hypothesized to play a role
in replication termination [10]. If this is true, we predicted
that rice would have stronger 3' palindromes, facilitating
less "leaky" termination, commensurately less incorporation of flanking nucleotides during replication, and therefore less gene capture. We tested this hypothesis by
isolating 50 bp of the 3' of each of our helitrons in maize
and japonica rice and submitting them to UNAfold analy-

sis to estimate the average free energy of folding (d G ).
Contrary to our prediction, the 552 predicted japonica rice
helitrons have d G values significantly higher than that of
our collection of maize helitrons, with d G = -3.50 (SD =
1.82) and d G = -5.21 (SD = 2.84) for rice and maize,
respectively (t-test, p < 0.001). The difference remains significant whether one compares polymorphic helitrons
between maize and rice (d G maize = -5.51; d G rice = -3.44;

p < 0.001) or fixed helitrons between maize and rice
(d G maize = -4.94; d G rice = -3.53; p < 0.001). In contrast
there is no significant difference in d G between polymorphic and fixed helitrons within either species (data not
shown). Thus, there are differences in 3' folding characteristics between maize and rice, but the direction of the difference was contrary to our prediction in that the rice
elements have weaker 3' palindromes on average.

Discussion
Non-autonomous helitrons can be difficult to identify
both because their internal sequences are not well conserved and because they lack the obvious features of some
class I and class II elements. We pursued two approaches
to identify helitrons in maize, both of which were based on
the ~40 bp 3' and 5' elements ends. An iterative, BLASTbased method yielded a non-redundant set of 23 predicted maize helitrons. Our predicted set of maize helitrons
is smaller than that of Du et al. [23], for two reasons. First,
we may have searched an earlier version of Genbank (the
Genbank version searched by Du et al. [23] was unspecified). Second, Du et al. [23] used perl regular expression
searches based on 18 and 30 bp queries for the 5' and 3'
ends, respectively, which is shorter than many of our
BLAST hits and may not be sufficient for appropriate identification of helitrons [27]. Nonetheless, 18 bp and 30 bp
queries do appear to adequately cover the length of conserved 5' and 3' motifs (Figure 2).
We used our set of maize (12 'seed' helitrons and 23 'predicted' helitrons) and similarly identified rice helitrons to
construct profile HMMs for each terminal region and each
species. The rice HMMs ranked the rice training sequences
near the top of the list of all potential genome hits and
identified > 500 elements in each of the japonica and
indica genomes, representing the first genome-wide
description of putative helitrons in rice. Five features of this
sequence collection suggest they represent bona fide rice
helitrons: i) the end sequences feature known hallmarks of
helitron 3' and 5' ends (Fig. 2); ii) the 3' and 5' ends are
found much more often than expected in random
sequences; iii) some elements are polymorphic between
japonica and indica (e.g., Figure S1); iv) the elements share
internal similarities, even though internal similarity was
not a search criterion; and v) the putative rice helitrons
contain gene fragments, like helitrons in other plant species. The effectiveness of the rice HMMs may be due to the
presence of a large, 508-member subfamily with similar
sequence properties that provide a template for HMM
convergence. In contrast, maize HMMs failed to achieve
an acceptable rate of recall and did not effectively model
the 5' and 3' motifs. One potential explanation for the
failure of the maize HMM is the limited maize genomic
data available at the time of the analysis. However we sus-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/467

pect, but cannot prove, that the failure of HMMs to converge reflects a broader diversity of helitrons in maize than
rice, with perhaps more subfamilies of fewer members.
This conjecture is supported by the fact that single-linkage
clustering of our maize elements yielded a largest cluster
of only 5 elements, with 21 of 35 elements remaining as
singletons, suggesting maize helitrons share few extensive
internal sequence characteristics.
Nonetheless, our number of predicted helitrons in maize is
sufficient to categorize substantial differences among species. First, at an average length of 4616 bp, maize helitrons
are longer than those of the other two species, with average lengths of 441 bp and 950 bp for rice and Arabidopsis,
respectively. Second, both rice and Arabidopsis have clear
subfamily structure. This study identified at least one
major subfamily of non-autonomous elements in rice,
with > 500 elements. Although several distinct subfamilies of non-autonomous helitrons have been identified in Arabidopsis [19], a subfamily > 200 members
predominates the genomic landscape [20]. The lack of
maize clusters with > 5 elements may be in part an effect
of small sample, but nonetheless the difference in singlelinkage clusters among species is suggestive that patterns
of helitron diversity vary substantially among angiosperm
species.
Helitron polymorphism among individuals
It is also useful to compare polymorphism among individuals across maize, rice and Arabidopsis. The 12 'seed'
helitrons in maize were identified by virtue of the fact that
they were polymorphic among individuals, so this was
not a random set and cannot be considered to provide an
unbiased window into the rate of helitron presence/
absence polymorphism. We did find, however, that five of
our maize helitrons were polymorphic in a sample of 8
inbred lines, out of 15 predicted helitrons for which we
were able to procure clean and repeatable PCR results. In
rice, we found a maximal polymorphism rate of 27%
between japonica and indica, and in A. thaliana, 51% of
278 non-autonomous elements were polymorphic in a
sample of 47 individuals [20].

The percentage of polymorphic elements is not directly
comparable among species because the percentage is an
increasing function of the number of individuals assayed
for polymorphism. However, one can compare diversity
with Watterson's θ [28], which corrects for sample size
and can be used as an estimate of per element helitron polymorphism among individuals. The estimate of θ for rice
is 0.27, while that of maize and Arabidopsis are similar at
0.13 and 0.11, respectively. As noted above, the value for
rice is undoubtedly inflated by incomplete sequence data
between japonica and indica rice genomes. Indeed, long
TBLs in the rice helitron phylogenies suggest that few ele-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:467

ment insertions have been recent (Figure 3), suggesting
that few helitrons should be polymorphic between japonica
and indica. Nonetheless, the fact that θ per element is similar between maize and Arabidopsis suggests that: i) our
helitron predictions yield reasonable answers, in terms of
the polymorphism levels of non-autonomous helitrons
polymorphism in maize relative to the much better characterized genome of Arabidopsis and/or ii) maize helitrons
may not be exceptionally polymorphic among individuals relative to helitrons in other angiosperm species.
Gene capture
Perhaps the most puzzling difference among species is the
extent of gene capture. The propensity for maize helitrons
to capture gene fragments is well known [14-16,18]; our
additional analyses of gene capture events only serve to
corroborate these earlier observations (Table 1). In contrast, the relative dearth of gene fragments in non-autonomous helitrons has been characterized in A. thaliana and
now rice (Table 2). Although gene capture is a predominant feature of maize helitrons, it may not be a common
feature of plant helitrons sensu lato.

Why is gene capture common in maize, relative to Arabidopsis and rice? One obvious consideration is sampling
biases. As described above, the complement of nonautonomous helitrons described to date in both Arabidopsis and rice are dominated by a single subfamily. It is possible that gene capture is for some reason particularly rare
in these subfamilies, and that helitrons representing gene
capture events have escaped identification by the different
methods used in this study and the study of Arabidopsis
[20]. Another sampling phenomenon could apply to
maize, in that our sample of maize helitrons may be nonrepresentative, thereby over-representing the prevalence
of gene capture. Yet, this also seems unlikely because previously described, polymorphic helitrons also contain a
number of gene fragments [9,15,17,18,21].
Another possibility for differences in gene capture, along
with sampling phenomena, is time. Yet, the effects of time
are difficult to predict precisely. One the one hand, if helitrons are older in maize, then there may have been more
time for gene capture events to occur. On the other hand
(and somewhat paradoxically), it might be reasonable to
expect younger elements to contain more captured gene
fragments. The reasoning here is that captured gene fragments, which can be expressed [15,18], might be particularly deleterious for genome function. If that is generally
the case, non-autonomous helitrons with gene fragments
will be preferentially removed from the genome over helitrons that do not harbor expressed gene fragments. That is,
older elements should have fewer gene fragments.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/467

Although the predicted relationship between time and
gene capture is unclear, several features of our data suggest
that time does not drive the observed differences among
species. On the one hand, many (17 of 35 of our total
sample) of the maize helitrons are new insertions, given
that they are polymorphic among inbred lines. However,
Arabidopsis helitrons have similar levels of polymorphism
among individuals and thus are also recent. Arabidopsis
elements have amplified within 5 mya [20], after the
divergence of A. thaliana from its sister species A. lyrata
[29]. Yet, despite potentially similar time dynamics, maize
and Arabidopsis helitrons differ markedly in the number of
gene capture events. Moreover, rice and Arabidopsis helitrons have comparable numbers of gene capture events,
but helitrons in these two species seem to differ dramatically in terms of evolutionary time, with the rice elements
providing little evidence of recent transposition events
based on TBLs (Figure 3).
A third possible contributor to the difference in gene capture is differences in the fidelity of replication mechanisms. We proposed that the properties of 3' palindromes
could differ between species, thinking that the species
with weaker palindromes would have 'leakier' replication
that resulted in the poor termination of replication and
accompanying incorporation of flanking genes. We did
find a difference in the free energy of folding between
maize and rice, but it differed in direction from our prediction; maize helitrons have stronger 3' palindromes than
rice. This observation is not easy to reconcile with our prediction, but does call to question the functional significance of 3' palindromes.
The functional roll of palindromes in the termination of
replication is at this point hypothetical [10]. In fact, Brunner et al [15] suggest that the 3' end of helitrons plays a
role in the initiation (not the termination) of transposition. They base this argument on their observation that 3'
ends appear to be more conserved than 5' ends; this observation is supported, but only nominally, by our 3' and 5'
nucleotide profiles (Figure 2). If the 3' ends serve to initiate transposition, one might predict that more recent and
active elements will have strong palindromes, but we
detect no difference in d G between helitrons that are
recent (i.e., polymorphic among individuals) and older
(present in all assayed individuals). Added to this mystery, helitrons have been found recently without 3' palindromes [30], suggesting that the 3' hairpins may not be
necessary for element function at all.
To address bioinformatically the issue of 3' palindrome
function, we asked whether the 3' palindromes of maize
helitrons had unique properties relative to the complete

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:467

helitron sequence. To do this, we examined all 35 maize
helitrons, scanned for hairpins along their length (see
Methods), estimated dG for each hairpin, and graphed dG
in relation to length. Even counting liberally, only a small
subset of nine of 35 helitrons have 3' hairpins with markedly low dG properties relative to other hairpins in the
same helitron sequence (Figure 4). These nine helitrons are
not biased as to whether the element is or is not demonstrably polymorphic among individuals (data not
shown). Another nine helitron sequences had 3' hairpin
structures of moderate folding strength relative to palindromes throughout the remainder of the sequence, and
16 helitrons had 3' hairpins without an obviously strong 3'
hairpin (Figure 4). We thus find little evidence to suggest
that the 3' palindromes are particularly unique within
individual helitron sequences, suggesting that 3' palindromes either may not be necessary for helitron function
or, at the very least, must act in concert with other signals,
such as the terminal CTAG.

Conclusion
Why do maize helitrons capture so many genes relative to
rice and Arabidopsis? It is hard to make convincing arguments for time, enhanced polymorphism levels among
individuals, or properties of 3' hairpins, and thus the
answer to this question remains a mystery. One factor that
we cannot address properly here is genomic defense; both
rice and Arabidopsis have small genomes, and they may
more effectively purge long elements (with gene capture
events) to maintain genome size [20]. Another possibility
is that maize has more total transposition events. The
number of transposition events is the product of the
potentially mobile elements (which is itself a function of
the number and ratio of autonomous to non-autonomous elements) along with the transposition rate per element [31]. With more events, there is more opportunity
for gene capture. There is, however, currently no data to
argue for or against the idea that maize has had more
transposition events in its recent evolutionary history
than either maize or Arabidopsis. A third possibility is that
gene capture leads almost immediately to new helitron
subfamilies. Each new subfamily then may represent a
new TE invasion event [29] that can escape genomic
defenses. Hence, once gene capture begins, it can become
a run-away process, but then the mystery is how it begins.
Unfortunately, there is currently not enough information
about helitron copy number in maize, the diversity of helitrons in maize, or the transposition rates of helitrons in any
species to make definitive conclusions. Additional analysis of the full maize genome sequence will provide some
insights, but additional information about transposition
rates and population dynamics will also be critical for
understanding the striking differences among helitrons of
different angiosperm species.

Methods
Data sources
To start our search, we used 12 published helitrons to initialize our "seed set" [12,15,21,22] (Table S1). Our maize
search was based on genomic data from Genbank release
149.0. Our investigation of rice included the TIGR Rice
Genome Annotation, Release 5, for japonica rice, and data
for indica rice genome from BGI-RIS FTP (as of 01/26/
2005).
Computational identification of helitrons
To identify helitrons, we applied two separate approaches.
The first approach is represented in Figure 1. Briefly, we
extracted 80 bp flanking regions of ends of 12 known
maize helitrons, 40 bp upstream and 40 downstream from
the 5' and 3' insertion sites of known helitrons, and used
BLASTn [32] to search for paired-matches to these 80 bp
terminal regions in all plant entries into Genbank release
149.0. This BLAST search generated two sets of BLAST hits,
one set for 3' terminal regions and one for 5' terminal
regions. Next matches for putative helitrons were found by
looking for pairs of BLAST hits (e-value < = 1e-5) that were
in the same GenBank entry, on the same strand, and less
than 20,000 bases apart.

Many of our initial hits were actually the same region
identified multiple times, both because there is redundancy in Genbank entries and also because our pairedmatching criteria sometimes matched several 3' ends to
one 5' end, or vice versa. Additionally some new helitron
termini matched more than one of the 12 known helitron
termini. To correct redundancy we examined 40 bp putative flanking regions; if both flanking regions were identical, the regions were deemed redundant. After all
redundant hits were eliminated, each new putative helitron was hand inspected and then added to the seed set of
the original 12 helitrons and the search was repeated. This
strategy was repeated four times until no new elements
were identified.
To find helitrons in the two available rice genomes we built
a profile HMM using HMMER 1.8.5 http://hmmer.jane
lia.org/ with default values for the complete set of helitron
terminal regions, including putative maize helitrons identified by the BLAST methodology described above. Using
the profile HMMs, we scanned the genomes, looking for
hits that were separated by at least 200 bp and no more
than 20,000 bp and in the proper orientation. We then
manually curated this set of putative helitrons to remove
any remaining artifacts of the search method. To compare
our results to a randomized genome, we first obtained the
probabilities of observing each nucleotide given the previous two observed nucleotides. We then picked a random
sequence of three nucleotides from the original sequence
as our starting point and generated a random walk, given

Examples
Examples of the free energy of folding for palindromes in maize helitrons. Helitrons can be loosely categorized on the
basis of the folding strength of the 3' hairpin relative to the other hairpins throughout the helitron sequence. The top panel
shows helitron2, which has a strong 3' palindrome; nine of 35 maize helitrons exhibit this pattern. Another ten helitrons contain
3' palindromes of medium folding energy (helitron1, center), and 16 have 3' hairpins with a weak folding properties (Helitron14,
bottom). Shading indicates the region containing the most 3' palindrome.

the transition probabilities, to create a new random
sequence the same length as the original sequence. In this
way, our randomized genomes contained not only the
same base pair frequencies as the japonica genome but also
maintained some of compositional structure (to the second order) along a sequence.
Cataloging gene fragments
Our set of maize helitrons was used as a BLASTn query
against three sources: i) all maize genomic nucleotide data
available in genbank (Zea mays DNA sequences 12.507)
ii) maize coding sequence (CDS) available from TIGR
http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/ and iii) ESTs from
dbEST
as
of
December
12,
2007
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/. Similarly, rice helitrons
were used as a blastn query in a search against the rice
(CDS) database from TIGR Rice Annotation Release 5.0
(January 24, 2007). An E-value cutoff of 1e-10 was used for
all BLAST searches, and gene fragment hits were verified
manually.
Molecular evolutionary analyses
Helitrons were clustered into subfamilies by single-linkage
clustering, based on linkages defined by local alignments
representing ≥ 60% of the shortest sequences and identities ≥ 80% over the alignment. Sequences in the largest
japonica rice subfamily were aligned using the ClustalW
multiple alignment program. This alignment was manually checked using BioEdit [33]. MEGA 3.1 [34] was used
to build a neighbor-joining phylogeny using pairwise
deletion, the Kimura 2-parameter substitution model [35]
and 5,000 bootstrap replicates. For each species, Watterson's estimate of θ [28] was calculated on the basis of a
presence/absence matrix of all helitrons in all individuals.
Conserved nucleotides were estimated with WebLogo
[36].
Assessing polymorphism
In maize, we assessed polymorphism experimentally by
performing a PCR survey in a panel of maize inbred lines.
For each putative maize helitron three primers were
designed, two flanking primers outside the helitron and
one internal primer within the putative element. Following Hollister and Gaut (2007), two PCR amplifications
were performed for each helitron: one reaction that
flanked the putative helitron, and a second reaction that
includes a flanking primer with a primer internal to the
predicted helitron element. Primer sequences are available
(Table S1). All primers were designed using Primer3 [37],
with default conditions. Sequence from maize inbred line
B73 was used to design the majority of the putative helitron primers; however several helitron primer sets were
designed based on sequence information from other
inbred lines such as BSS53 (Supp. Table X). All PCR utilized a 58/51 touchdown protocol with 1 min denaturing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/467

at 95C, 45 s annealing at 58C, and 1.5 min extension at
70C for 15 cycles and 10 cycles of 1 min denaturing at
95C, 45 s annealing at 51C, and 1.5 min extension at 70C
followed by a 7 min elongation period at 70C. Element
presence and absence was assessed in a panel of eight
inbred lines, including B73 (often as a positive control for
presence), Mo17, Tx601, W153, Ky21, T8, Mo24 and
OH43. Additionally, some elements were assessed for
presence/absence in a panel of six maize landraces and
two Zea mays ssp. parviglumis individuals.
Polymorphism for rice helitrons was assessed computationally by comparing the indica and japonica genomes.
We concatenated sequences 100 bp upstream and 100 bp
downstream of the helitrons to find possible pairings
between the two rice genomes. Blast hits of these concatenated sequences between japonica and indica were considered homologues with e-values < = 1e-40. The ordering of
the helitrons within each chromosome was determined by
their position in the sequence. For the indica genome, we
also had to order the superscaffolds, which was done by
aligning the superscaffolds from indica to the whole chromosomes in japonica using MUMmer [38]. Given this
information, we applied the maximal non crossing
matching algorithm to the ordered helitrons, ultimately
estimating the maximum proportion of homologous helitrons in collinear order [26].
Palindrome analysis
The free energy of folding (dG) of sequence fragments was
estimated with UNAFold [39]. To examine the distribution of dG along complete helitron sequences, we first
identified sequences between 4 and 20 bp that had an
inverted sequence with a loop length between 1 and 10 bp
and score greater than zero, when the score was calculated
as the number of matches minus 2 times the number of
mismatches.
