Abstract
Background: Evolutionary conservation has been used successfully to help identify cis-acting
DNA regions that are important in regulating tissue-specific gene expression. Motivated by
increasing evidence that some DNA regulatory regions are not evolutionary conserved, we have
developed an approach for cis-regulatory region identification that does not rely upon evolutionary
sequence conservation.
Results: The conservation-independent approach is based on an empirical potential energy
between interacting transcription factors (TFs). In this analysis, the potential energy is defined as a
function of the number of TF interactions in a genomic region and the strength of the interactions.
By identifying sets of interacting TFs, the analysis locates regions enriched with the binding sites of
these interacting TFs. We applied this approach to 30 human tissues and identified 6232 putative
cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) regulating 2130 tissue-specific genes. Interestingly, some genes
appear to be regulated by different CRMs in different tissues. Known regulatory regions are highly
enriched in our predicted CRMs. In addition, DNase I hypersensitive sites, which tend to be
associated with active regulatory regions, significantly overlap with the predicted CRMs, but not
with more conserved regions. We also find that conserved and non-conserved CRMs regulate
distinct gene groups. Conserved CRMs control more essential genes and genes involved in
fundamental cellular activities such as transcription. In contrast, non-conserved CRMs, in general,
regulate more non-essential genes, such as genes related to neural activity.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that identifying relevant sets of binding motifs can help in
the mapping of DNA regulatory regions, and suggest that non-conserved CRMs play an important
role in gene regulation.

Background
Transcriptional regulation is a key component of gene regulation, which itself plays a major role in all forms of cellular differentiation and function. To understand the

mechanisms that regulate gene expression, it is important
to identify and define the network of cis-acting DNA regulatory elements, which can be viewed as the regulatory
code wired within the genome. The code itself is executed

through transcription factors (TFs), which determine
which set of genes will be expressed. Because the cis-regulatory elements are usually short and degenerate, distinguishing regions of regulatory importance from other
non-coding regions is often a great challenge.
One important method for cis-regulatory element detection is based on the concept of the cis-regulatory module
(CRM). The hypothesis behind this approach is that TFs
co-operate as a functional complex in regulating gene
expression. A corollary of this hypothesis is that a region
with multiple putative TF binding sites (TFBSs) is more
likely to be functional than a region with only a solitary
site. These studies were carried out by counting TFBS hits
in sliding windows along genomic sequence, and then
predicting that the regions with the highest density of
TFBSs represent CRMs. This CRM concept has been
applied to several biological systems [1-9]. Methods based
on Hidden Markov Models have been developed to use
this CRM concept to improve motif identification [10,11].
A limit that has prevented this approach from being
applied on a large scale is the a priori requirement of a set
of biologically relevant TFs. Definition of the set of relevant TFs generally requires extensive experimental work,
and for most cases such data is not available.
Evolutionary conservation (phylogenetic footprinting
approach) can help to improve the cis-regulatory elements identification when used in combination with
other methods. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that evolutionarily conserved sequences within non-coding regions are the result of selective pressure, and are
likely to be enriched for functional regulatory elements.
This type of approach has been successfully applied to a
variety of systems [12-18]. However, by the nature of the
approach, it is not effective for the discovery of speciesspecific regulatory elements. This limitation is becoming
increasingly important because a growing body of evidence suggests the biological importance of non-conserved sequences. Recent comparative genomics studies
have identified important RET elements in human and
zebrafish that are not conserved evolutionarily [19]. On a
genome-wide scale, comparisons between Drosophila species show only slight difference in conservation between
known regulatory regions and other non-coding regions,
again suggesting the regulatory importance of non-conserved sequences [20]. A large scale analysis from the
ENCODE project found that only 55% of regulatory factor
binding sites overlap the high-confidence evolutionarily
constrained sequences, suggesting the possibility of large
number of neutral regulatory elements which are biologically functional but are not under selective pressure [21].
To study tissue-specific gene regulation, we have been
working to develop approaches to identify and analyze

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/437

regulatory regions that contribute to tissue specificity. We
suggest that species differences in regulatory regions may
be particularly important in specialized functions such as
the determination of tissue specificity. Therefore, it is
important to identify tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements in an unbiased way in terms of evolutionary conservation. In the work described here, the goals were to (1)
develop a computational method for identification of cisregulatory elements that works with both conserved and
non-conserved regions, (2) discover regions that are
responsible for tissue specificity, and (3) functionally
compare conserved and non-conserved regions with the
hope of providing a glimpse into the evolution of gene
regulation.
Our algorithm, called CRM-PI (cis-regulatory module
identification based on protein interaction), searches for
DNA regions with dense TFBSs whose binding TFs are
known or predicted to be important to tissue specificity.
The approach is similar to the above-described methods
for mapping CRMs in genomes [1-9], but it has been
adapted to deal with situations in which experimental
data defining biologically relevant sets of interacting factors is lacking. Sets of putative interacting TFs are first
computationally predicted based on the positional relationship and co-occurrences of their binding sites in the
conserved regions of the promoters of tissue-specific
genes [22]. Based upon these predictions on the trans-acting factors, efforts are made to construct cis-acting DNA
regions (i.e. CRMs) in the promoter of each tissue-specific
gene, including conserved and non-conserved regions.
Since our predicted CRMs do not rely on evolutionary
conservation, we are able to investigate the contribution
of both conserved and non-conserved CRMs to tissue specific gene regulation, and to study the associated characteristics in the context of the evolution of gene regulation.

Results
Detection of CRMs based on tissue-specific TF interactions
We utilized computationally predicted tissue-specific TF
interactions to identify CRMs. In our previous work we
identified 9060 putative tissue-specific TF interactions
[22]. Two TFs were predicted as interacting if the relative
positions and co-occurrence of their binding sites in promoters differed significantly from random expectation
(Figure 1; Additional files 1 and 2). Since identifying the
CRMs harboring these interactions in each individual promoter is not trivial, we developed an algorithm, CRM-PI,
to detect CRMs by calculating an empirical "potential
energy" between interacting TFBSs along the genomic
sequence. A promoter region containing many interacting
TFBSs will have low "potential energy" (see Methods).
CRM-PI obtains an energy landscape along the regulatory
regions and searches for regions with low "potential
energy". For those locations at which the energy is below

we identified groups of genes that are preferentially expressed in tissues (e.g. gene C and D in the schematic). For each group
of genes, we searched the binding sites of known TFs in promoter regions and determined the TF pairs whose binding sites
tend to co-occur in close proximity. A tissue-specific TF interaction network was obtained from the analysis. We then scanned
the genomic regions and identified cis-regulatory regions (CRMs). The CRMs are defined as regions enriched with TF interactions. Note the first steps were implemented in our previous work [22] while this paper focuses on the last step.

expressed in the larynx. The energy landscape (Ecrm)
based on larynx-specific TF interactions is shown in the
bottom panel of the figure. An energy minimum around 200 bp is lower than the threshold (dashed line) and thus
predicts the presence of a CRM (highlighted by vertical
bar). Five known cis-regulatory elements are also located
around this position (red dots). Interestingly, the region is
not evolutionarily conserved (upper panel). Furthermore,

if we simply count hits of all TFBSs instead of only the relevant (interacting) ones, the TFBS density at this region is
just around the average value.
CRM-PI detected novel as well as known CRMs. For example, we identified three putative CRMs for cyclic nucleotide gated channel beta 3 (CNGB3, NM_019098), a gene
that is preferentially expressed in the retina. Two CRMs are

within upstream 400 bp, while the other one is located
around upstream 3200 bp (vertical bars in Figure 2B). The
CRM closest to the transcription start site (TSS, 0 on the xaxis) is conserved (average conservation score: 0.92).
However, the TFBS density is not high around this region.
For the CRM spanning from -200 bp to -340 bp, the
region is also relatively conserved. The one at -3200 bp,
however, is not conserved, and there is only a minimal
increase in TFBS density in this region. These examples
demonstrate that our approach can identify CRMs in both
conserved and non-conserved regions.
We applied our method to 7261 genes that are preferentially expressed in various human tissues [22]. For each of
the 7261 tissue-specific genes, we calculated the energy
landscape based on the TF interactions specific to the
respective tissues. The investigated regions included
sequences upstream of the translation start sites, introns,
and sequences downstream of the transcription end sites
(see Methods). Among the tissue-specific genes, 2130 of
them were found to contain a total of 6232 CRMs, with an

average length of 90 bp. The summary statistics for each
tissue is shown in Table 1. Detailed information of the
predictions can be found in Additional file 3.
Evaluation using known regulatory elements and DNase I
hypersensitive sites
In an effort to evaluate CRM-PI, we first explored its
behavior with known cis-regulatory elements. We collected the elements from the TRANSFAC database [23],
and chose those in the investigated regions of the tissuespecific genes as the positive controls. In total, we identified 548 regions as positive controls.

Sensitivity and specificity are widely used criteria in evaluation of a prediction. Here, because only a very small
fraction of cis-regulatory elements are determined, we calculated enrichment instead of specificity. Sensitivity is
defined as the ratio of the recovered positive control
regions (in unit of nucleotides) to total length of the positive control regions. The enrichment is defined as the
ratio of the probabilities of predicting a nucleotide site in

To obtain a relative sense of the performance of our
approach, we compared our results with an approach that
predicts CRMs based purely on conservation. In this simplified comparison, we used conservation scores as the
cutoff, and the non-coding regions with conservation
scores higher than the cutoff were predicted as CRMs [24].
We found that the performance of our approach was similar to that of this conservation-based method (Figure 3).
However, comparison of the approaches revealed that
there are significant areas of non-overlap between the sets
of identified CRMs, suggesting that the different
approaches can complement each other (see Discussion).

enrichment close to 1.
We obtained a series of predictions using different thresholds to assess the performance of our approach in terms of
sensitivity and enrichment. As expected, if more stringent
cutoffs are used, the number of known regulatory regions
recovered decreases (Figure 3). At the same time, the
enrichment of known regulatory regions in the prediction
increases with more stringent cutoffs, indicating that the
known regions are not randomly distributed in the prediction set and tend to have more significant "potential
energy" from our prediction. This result justifies the usage
of "potential energy" as a measure of the relative probability that a region is in a CRM. In our prediction, we chose

We also used DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) as an
indirect assessment of our predictions. DHSs represent
chromatin regions that show increased sensitivity to
digestion by the enzyme DNase I. The increased DNase I
sensitivity is thought to reflect areas of DNA where there
is increased accessibility to TFs and other DNA binding
proteins. DHSs are generally enriched with regulatory elements. We analyzed the 84 DHSs that are associated with
tissue-specific genes [25]. Figure 3B shows the sensitivityenrichment plots for our approach. Our approach can predict DHSs with a reasonable performance. However, an
approach based solely on conservation does not effectively distinguish DHSs from the overall genomic
sequence (enrichment of DHSs in the prediction is close
to 1).
Some features of predicted CRMs for tissue-specific genes
The analysis revealed that CRMs are not homogenously
distributed across regulatory regions. We calculated the
probability for each position to be in a CRM (Figure 4).
There is a significant peak showing high regulatory activity
around transcription start sites (TSSs). The peak is located
at ~ -60 bp upstream to the TSS. The regulatory activity
decays rapidly with increasing distance from the TSS in
both directions. The decreases are symmetric for upstream
and downstream to TSSs, an observation consistent with
the ENCODE analysis [21]. We also noticed that there is a
moderate peak at the start position of the first intron. As a
comparison, we calculated the same probability for random sequences as the background (pink line in left
panel). The random sequences were generated according
to the nucleic acid compositions and 1sr/2nd/6th order
transition probabilities of all promoter sequences in the
human genome. The averaged probabilities for a base pair
to be in CRM are 0.0005, 0.00056, and 0.0014 for random sequences of orders 1st, 2nd and 6th, respectively.

gene structure
Dependence of regulatory activity on positions relative to
Dependence of regulatory activity on positions relative to
gene structure. We calculated the probability for each position containing a CRM. The reference positions (origins in
the x-axis) are transcription start sites, the respective start
sites of introns and transcription end sites in three regions,
respectively. The pink curve in the left panel is from random
sequences which were generated with the same nucleic acids
compositions and 1st order transition probabilities, respectively, as those of the all promoter sequences in the human
genome.

For clarity, only the results of the 1st-order random
sequences are presented in Figure 4. All regions investigated have significantly higher regulatory activity (>0.01)
than the random sequences. This finding is consistent
with the results from several large scale ChIP-chip experiments showing that regulatory elements are not restricted
to upstream sequences [21,26-28].
We then examined the number of CRMs associated with
each gene and found that the CRM numbers display a
power-law-like distribution. In other words, most of the
genes have only a few associated CRMs and a few genes
have many CRMs. More than half of the genes (65%) are
associated with only one or two CRMs. On the other
hand, only 5 genes (MTTP, MAP2, FSTL5, SLC26A3, and
CD36) are regulated by more than 20 CRMs. Of course,
these multiple CRMs are not necessary simultaneously
active in cells. Different sets of CRMs may be used in different tissues, indicating distinct regulatory mechanisms.
For example, CD36 is preferentially expressed in blood,
bone marrow, heart, and soft tissue. The numbers of
CRMs specific to these tissues are 1, 4, 8, and 9, respectively.
Another example of this phenomenon is provided by
PITX2, which encodes a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor. PITX2 is preferentially expressed in both
placenta and eye based on our EST analysis. We calculated
the potential energy landscapes using the interaction sets
specific to placenta and eye, respectively. Figure 5 shows

the energy landscape around the TSS of PITX2. The landscape in the upper panel was based on placenta-specific TF
interactions. The placenta-specific interactions yield a
CRM around 1800 bp in the first intron (the intron spans
from 573 bp to 4343 bp). The most important TFs binding to the CRM are LHX3, CHX10 and ATBF1. Similarly,
we calculated the energy landscape based on eye-specific
interaction for the same gene (bottom panel in Figure 5).
Two CRMs were found based on eye-specific TF interactions. One is located around -3600 bp upstream and the
other around 1400 bp in the first intron. The TF binding
to the CRM in the upstream region is FOXJ2. Three FOXJ2
binding sites occur in the region of the CRM, suggesting
several homotypic interactions between FOXJ2. The TFs
found in the CRM in intron include FOXJ2, CHX10,
POU3F2 and CRX. This example demonstrates that different sets of TFs bind to their respective CRMs and can regulate the same gene in different tissues.
Conserved and non-conserved CRMs regulate distinct
classes of genes
Since our approach to CRM prediction does not rely on
evolutionary conservation, one would expect to obtain
both conserved and non-conserved CRMs. As expected,
the identified CRMs occurred in both conserved and nonconserved regions. Among all predicted CRMs, 55% of
them have an average conservation score less than 0.2.

We explored whether there might be differences between
the conserved and non-conserved classes of CRMs in
terms of the activity and/or properties of their target
genes. We first investigated the functional classes enriched
for the respective gene groups regulated by conserved
CRMs (cCRMs) and non-conserved CRMs (ncCRMs) (see
Methods for definitions). We counted the numbers of
genes in various functional classes based on gene ontol-

ogy (GO) annotation [29] and calculated the P values for
each class (see Methods). Table 2 lists the most significantly enriched functional classes in the gene groups targeted by cCRMs and ncCRMs, respectively. We can see
that genes involved in gene expression and protein modification (e.g. transcription, protein amino acid dephosphorylation) tend to be targeted by cCRMs. In contrast,
the genes related to nervous system function (e.g. synaptic
transmission) tend to be regulated by ncCRMs. The observations on the different enriched functional classes for
cCRMs and ncCRMs could be rationalized by the fact that
transcription and translation activities are among the
most fundamental processes in cells, while neural activity
is more specific to species. To exclude possible effects
brought about by the conservation of their target genes,
we performed the same analysis on the conserved gene
groups (of average conservation scores not less than 0.5).
One can see that most of the results are consistent with the
above (Additional file 4).
We then linked CRM conservation with the essentiality of
their target genes. Essential genes are defined as those that
render the cell, or organism, non-viable if knocked out.
The essential and viable genes were obtained through
mouse knockout experiments [30], and the gene lists
themselves were obtained from the Human Protein Reference Database [31]. From the database, we identified 153
viable and 83 essential genes that were tissue-specific and
had at least one CRM in their regulatory regions. The fractions of essential genes in the gene group regulated by
cCRMs and ncCRMs are 0.48 (45 out 93) and 0.27 (38 out
of 143), respectively, suggesting that the classification
cCRM/ncCRM is significantly correlated with the classification viable/essential genes (chi square test, p < 0.01).
Our result demonstrates that the regulatory elements for
essential genes tend to evolve slower than those regulating
non-essential genes. Since it has been found that more
dispensable genes tend to have a higher evolutionary rate
[32], this result indicates a possible co-evolution between
coding sequences and their regulatory elements.

A recent study on interspecies variation in gene expression
revealed that genes containing a TATA box in their promoters tend to have increased gene expression variation
across species, indicating that the TATA box could be a
genetic signature for gene expression variation [33]. We
examined the relationship between the conservation of
the CRMs and the likelihood of containing a TATA-box in
the promoters. Twelve percent (9 out of 74) of genes regulated by cCRMs contain a TATA-box. In contrast, 23%
(39 out of 169) of genes regulated by ncCRMs contain a
TATA-box (chi square test, p < 0.05). Hypogeometric testing also indicates that the cCRM group significantly overlaps with the non-TATA group (p ~ 0.003) and the ncCRM
group with the TATA group (p ~ 0.03). This observation
and the above results demonstrate that the genes controlled by cCRMs and ncCMRs are distinctive in terms of functional classification, gene essentiality and the likelihood
of being associated with a TATA-box containing promoter.
Computational complexity and software availability
The computation of a gene's energy landscape takes less
than 1 second for a typical 5â10 kbp promoter sequence,
and ~42 minutes for ~6000 random sequences in a linux
system operating on a DELL PRECISION 690. The program CRM-PI is available upon request.

Discussion
Gene regulation is not a static process. It is not only about
"which TF regulates which genes", but also about "when,
where and how the TF regulates the gene". In this context,
CRMs are best thought of not just as static segments of
DNA sequences located around genes, but rather as
dynamic entities that are a function of both time and
space. There are many attributes associated with the
CRMs, and these attributes are also dynamic. In our analysis, we predicted tissue-specific CRMs, i.e. CRMs associated with gene regulation specific to individual cells or
tissues. In different tissues, the CRMs regulating the same
gene can be dramatically different (see example in Figure
5). In addition, distinct sets of regulatory elements may
regulate the same gene at different developmental stages.

As more information becomes available, it should be possible to more fully relate regulatory elements with temporal (e.g. development) and spatial (e.g. cell types)
attributes. The additional temporal and spatial information will likely be helpful in describing regulatory elements in their larger biological context.
Sensitivity
Our approach achieved a reasonable sensitivity of 0.12 for
identification of tissue-specific cis-regulatory regions. This
performance is similar to other currently available tools.
Gupta and Liu tested the CRM predictions of 7 available
methods on conserved human-mouse alignment regions
of 5 k upstream sequence, and their sensitivities ranged
from 0.10 to 0.31 [10]. PreMod is a new promising
approach of CRM detection based on conservation, and
its sensitivity is 0.15~0.30 for TRANSFAC binding sites.

The modest sensitivity of CRM-PI can be attributed to
many factors. First, our approach used 306 TFs with
known binding sites, which is just a fraction of the total of
~1500 human TFs [34]. As a result, many CRMs bound by
the factors not included this study will be missing from
our prediction. Second, our positive controls from
TRANSFAC are not necessarily tissue-specific, while our
predicted CRMs are only those that contribute to tissue
specificity. Third, we expect that if we could include more
information for TF interactions, such as binding site orientation and distances, our approach would be more sensitive to detect true CRMs.
Comparison with other CRM methods
One significant difference between our approach and
other CRM methods is that we proposed that only relevant TFBSs contribute to a functional CRM. Therefore,
CRM-PI counts the number of interactions instead of the
total number of TFBSs in a sliding window for CRM detection. One interesting observation is that we obtained similar densities of TFBSs in promoter sequences and 6th
order Markov random sequences (0.152 vs 0.148 hit per
bp). In other words, we would have similar numbers of
CRMs for real promoters and random sequences if we
simply counted the TFBSs. However, the numbers of
CRMs (i.e regulatory activities) between the promoter and
random sequences are significantly different (> 0.01 vs.
0.0014), suggesting the importance of including only relevant TFs for CRM detection.
Comparison with conserved-based approach
To enrich for true interactions between TFs, we utilized
evolutionary conservation as a constraint [22]. After
obtaining the TF interactions, we searched the cis-regulatory regions for each promoter regardless of the degree of
evolutionary conservation. As a result, we have found a
substantial fraction of CRMs in non-conserved regions,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/437

indicating that our approach and conservation-based
methods detect different sets of the CRMs. For example,
using TFBS regions of TRANSFAC database as positive
control, we correctly predicted 66 TFBS regions. Among
these 66 sites, only 19 were predicted by PReMod, a
genome-wide conservation-based approach [12]. Therefore, our method can complement the widely used conservation-based methods.
Evolution of regulatory mechanisms
From the perspective of molecular evolution, identification of both conserved and non-conserved regulatory elements can provide insight into the evolution of gene
regulation. It has been hypothesized that variation in gene
regulation can be as important as coding region changes
in contributing to the differences between species [35].
Supporting this viewpoint, human and chimpanzee share
99% sequence identity in coding sequences, yet they still
demonstrate major difference in morphology and behavior [36]. Therefore, how genes are regulated might, in
some ways, be as critical as evolutionary variation
between genes themselves, suggesting that the evolution
of regulatory elements might be as important as that of
coding sequences in the explanation of divergence among
species.

Despite this, there have been few comprehensive studies
on the evolution of regulatory elements. In one study,
Gasch et al analyzed the conservation and evolution of
cis-regulatory systems in fungi [37]. Many cis-regulatory
elements in S. cerevisiae were found to be conserved in
other fungi, but they also found some novel cis-regulatory
elements specific to individual species.
One problem limiting comprehensive study of regulatory
variation is the lack of sufficient known cis-regulatory elements, especially in mammalian systems. Current studies
of the evolution of gene regulation often compare gene
expression across species instead of regulatory elements
directly [38-40]. It is worth emphasizing that it is not
identical to study evolution in terms of gene expression
and cis-regulatory elements. For example, a recent study
based upon comparison of the messenger RNA levels in
liver tissues within and between human, chimpanzee,
orangutan and rhesus macaque found that TFs tend to
evolve more rapidly than other genes [40]. In contrast, our
study on promoter sequences indicates that TFs tend to be
regulated by conserved CRMs. Our findings may reflect
the evolutionary discrepancy between the gene expression
and regulatory elements. The study of regulatory elements
therefore requires unbiased (conserved vs. non-conserved) identification of these elements. We suggest that
our method will be helpful in the identification of both
conserved and non-conserved regulatory elements, which

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:437

in turn will provide insights into the evolution of regulatory mechanisms.
Limitations and future directions
In this study, we limited the promoter sequences to 5 kb
upstream of the transcription start site (TSS), and thus
excluded many enhancers and other regulatory elements
that are far from the TSSs. However, extension of our analysis to the entire genomic would likely introduce significant noise, a reflection of the trade-off problem between
sensitivity and specificity.

Another area of compromise involved whether or not to
include evolutionary conservation. We decided to ignore
use of the evolutionary conservation constraint so as to be
able to detect both conserved and non-conserved CRMs.
A limitation of excluding evolutionary conservation, however, is that we loose its power for helping to identify certain cis-regulatory regions. One possible compromise
approach that could take advantage of both approaches
would be to include only mammalian genomes to define
conservation. In this way, we would have the power of the
conservation constraint, and in the meantime, we can
hopefully retain most of species-specific cis-regulatory elements.
Our approach to CRM identification can be extended to
treat cell-type- or development-stage-specific gene groups.
The real challenge of our strategy is how to find welldefined gene groups whose members share similar mechanisms of gene regulation. Secondly, choosing a more
non-redundant and comprehensive motif set, such as a
refined combination of Jaspar [41] and TRANSFAC, may
improve the current performance of our approach. Other
developments, such as improvements in motif finding
algorithms, may further help improve the global performance of our approach.

Conclusion
We have presented a study of cis-regulatory systems that
regulate tissue-specific gene expression. In contrast to
popular phylogenetic footprinting approaches, our proposed method utilizes information based on TF interactions to identify cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), an
approach that is unbiased in terms of evolutionary conservation. The results suggest that non-conserved CRMs contribute significantly to tissue-specific gene regulation.
With more data available, it should be possible to put the
CRMs in a fuller biological context and better understand
the roles they play in cellular differentiation and function.

studied include (i) upstream 5 kb to translation start site
(ii) introns (iii) 3'UTR (iv) downstream relative to transcription end site (TES) to its 3' adjacent gene. If the
region is longer than 5 kb, we cut it to 5 kb from TES.
Position weight matrices and genome-wide search
Similar as previous work [22], we collected 306 human
position weight matrices (PWMs) from TRANSFAC database and literatures. The match scores between a matrix
and a sequence were calculated for all possible positions
along the promoters defined in previous work [22]. The
score threshold for the top 0.015% matches in all promoters was utilized as the cutoff. This cutoff is somewhat arbitrary and may cause some false positive hits. The study of
CRMs based on TF interactions is expected to increase the
specificity of these hits.
Identification of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs)
The basic hypothesis of our method is that the TF complex, rather than individual TFs, is the functional unit of
gene regulation. Based on this hypothesis, we perform our
analysis by searching for clusters of transcription factor
binding sites (TFBSs), which are denoted as cis-regulatory
modules (CRMs). These clusters are more likely to be
functional than solitary TFBSs. A key step in our method
is to identify sets of relevant TFs. We argue that only the
clusters of relevant (interacting) TFs are biologically
meaningful. Relevant TFs are defined here as the TFs that
may interact to co-regulate tissue-specific genes. We identified cis-regulatory modules based on TF interactions. If a
region has sufficient TFBSs whose binding TFs interact
with each other, we predict the region as CRMs.

In our previous work, we predicted tissue-specific TF interactions [22]. Briefly, we first identified tissue-specific
genes based on gene expression profile across various tissues. We then derived TF pairs that are likely to regulate
the tissue-specific genes. We scanned known TFBSs (i.e.
the binding matrix from TRANSFAC) in the promoters of
the tissue-specific genes. If the co-occurrence of two TFBSs
is over-represented and/or the distances between the two
TFBSs in the promoters are significantly deviating from a
random expectation, we predicted the two TFs interact
with each other in the tissue (Figure 1). The interaction
strength between two motifs is defined as
S = -log(P) = -log(PoccPd),

(1)

where Pocc describes whether the co-occurrence (g) of the
TFBS pair is enriched in the tissue-specific promoters (n)
compared to the total co-occurrence (G) in all N promoters.

Sequences in the genome
We obtained sequences and gene structures based on RefSeq gene annotation (hg17). The regulatory regions we

The contribution from distances between two TFBSs, Pd, is
obtained from comparison of the observed TFBS-pair distance distribution with that of two random sites using a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.
In this work, we then predicted cis-regulatory modules
(CRMs) based on the obtained TF interactions. We developed an algorithm, CRM-PI, to calculate an empirical
"potential energy" between interacting TFBSs along the
genomic sequence. In this context, two TFBSs are considered as interacting if their respective TFs are interacting.
Previous methods for identification of CRMs often
counted the number of TFBSs in a sliding window along
the genomic sequences. Our method is equivalent to
count the number of interactions in the regions. Note that
multiple TFBS matches for the same TF are considered separately. More precisely, we calculated an empirical "potential energy" for each TFBS site,

Ei = â

â S exp(âd

/ D)

(3)

j

Here Sij is the interaction strength between two TFBSs (see
equation 1); dij is the distance between sites i and j; D is
the decaying constant, which is equivalent to the window
size from other CRM methods. In our calculations of TF
interactions, we found that the average genomic length
between two interacting TFBSs is roughly 200 bp, which
we choose as the value of D. Changing this value in a certain range does affect our results. If the two interacting
sites are far away, their contribution to the energy would
be small. For each TFBS, we summed up the "potential
energy" due to the interactions with all other TFBSs.
In some cases, multiple TFBSs overlap at site i, and we
choose the TFBS hit whose Ei value is the lowest. This Ei
values still contain the contributions from other overlapped TFBSs. We utilized a simpler approach, compared
to previous methods such as AHAB [8] and ClusterDraw
[9]. For all sites in the studied sequence, we sort them
according to their Ei values from low to high, and delete
the overlapped hits for each of the ordered sites sequentially. We then update the Ei values for the non-overlapped hits. Although this greedy algorithm may not
guarantee in obtaining the optimal solution, its efficiency
in CPU time makes it a practical choice for a genome-wide
calculation.
The Ei values for the sites generally fluctuate greatly along
the sequence. The lengths of CRMs based on the Ei values

are often around the length of a TF binding site. To
smooth the energy landscape and define a continuous
CRM, the contributions from the vicinity of the studied
site with a window size W were summed up to be as the
CRM energy Ecrm of this site. We chose a window size of W
= 400 bp. Furthermore, to make the calculations in different tissues comparable, we performed a simulation on
random sequences to determine the cutoff for Ecrm. The
random sequences have the same transition probabilities
as the sequences (-5000 bp to translation start site) of all
RefSeq genes (~23000). For each tissue, we calculated Ecrm
on 10000 random sequences and recorded the lowest Ecrm
value for each random sequence. We chose the cutoff as
the Ecrm which is ranked on 5% lowest values (i.e. the
value at the lowest 500) in the random simulation. The
Ecrm was normalized by this value, thus the cutoffs for all
tissues are Ecrm = 1.
Conservation of sequences and CRMs
We utilized conservation scores, which were calculated
based on multiple sequence alignment of eight vertebrate
species using the phylogenetic hidden Markov model
(phastCons) [42], to evaluate the conservation of
sequences and CRMs. The eight species compared were
human, chimp, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, fugu, and
zebrafish. The conservation score obtained from this comparison reflects the general conservation level within the
vertebrates and allows for a metric to determine conservation of larger stretches of genomic sequence. Since CRMs
often span several hundred base pairs, the average value of
conservation scores of all base pairs in a CRM is an appropriate measurement for the general conservation trend of
this CRM.

To determine whether there might be differences between
the conserved and non-conserved classes of CRMs in
terms of the activity and/or properties of their target
genes, we compared the gene groups regulated by conserved CRMs (cCRMs) and non-conserved CRMs
(ncCRMs). The cCRM group was defined as those with
conservation score > 0.5, and the ncCRM group defined as
those with conservation score < 0.2. For those genes controlled by more than one CRM, we used the average conservation score of the associated CRMs. By this definition,
455 and 877 genes were regulated by cCRMs and ncCRMs,
respectively. (It should be noted that variation in the cutoffs chosen for the definition of cCRMs and ncCRMs was
tested and such variation did not significantly affect the
results presented in the result section.)
Functional enrichment for cCRMs and ncCRMs
We first counted the number of genes associated with
cCRMs (or ncCRMs) in each functional class and then
compared the observed number with that which would be
expected if genes were randomly assigned to the func-

tional class. P-values were calculated using the binomial
distribution. We did the multiple testing over the functional classes by performing random simulation to determine the cutoff for significant P-values. In each
simulation we selected a group of genes with the same size
of the genes controlled by cCRMs (or ncCRMs) and calculated the P-values for their occurrences in different functional classes. We obtained the most significant P-value
from each simulation and determined the P-value at top
5% of the P-value distribution from the simulation as the
cutoff for significance. For cCRM and ncCRM, the cutoffs
for the P-values are 10-3.66 and 10-3.9, respectively.
