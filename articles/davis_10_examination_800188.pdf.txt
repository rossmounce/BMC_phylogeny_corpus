Abstract
Background: Strawberry (Fragaria spp.) is the familiar name of a group of economically important crop plants and wild
relatives that also represent an emerging system for the study of gene and genome evolution. Its small stature, rapid
seed-to-seed cycle, transformability and miniscule basic genome make strawberry an attractive system to study
processes related to plant physiology, development and crop production; yet it lacks substantial genomics-level
resources. This report addresses this deficiency by characterizing 0.71 Mbp of gene space from a diploid species (F.
vesca). The twenty large genomic tracks (30-52 kb) captured as fosmid inserts comprise gene regions with roles in
flowering, disease resistance, and metabolism.
Results: A detailed description of the studied regions reveals 131 Blastx-supported gene sites and eight additional ESTsupported gene sites. Only 15 genes have complete EST coverage, enabling gene modelling, while 76 lack EST support.
Instances of microcolinearity with Arabidopsis thaliana were identified in twelve inserts. A relatively high portion (25%)
of targeted genes were found in unanticipated tandem duplications. The effectiveness of six FGENESH training models
was assessed via comparisons among ab initio predictions and homology-based gene and start/stop codon
identifications. Fourteen transposable-element-related sequences and 158 simple sequence repeat loci were
delineated.
Conclusions: This report details the structure and content of targeted regions of the strawberry genome. The data
indicate that the strawberry genome is gene-dense, with an average of one protein-encoding gene or pseudogene
per 5.9 kb. Current overall EST coverage is sparse. The unexpected gene duplications and their differential patterns of
EST support suggest possible subfunctionalization or pseudogenization of these sequences. This report provides a
high-resolution depiction of targeted gene neighborhoods that will aid whole-genome sequence assembly, provide
valuable tools for plant breeders and advance the understanding of strawberry genome evolution.
Background
Strawberry is the familiar name of a valuable genus [Fragaria spp. (Rosaceae)] comprising cultivated plants that
produce popular and nutritious fruits, as well as wild
plant species that populate many areas of the northern
hemisphere and South America. The genus contains a
diversity of species representing ploidy levels from diploid to decaploid [1,2]. The octoploid (2 n = 8 x = 56)
genome composition of the cultivated strawberry, Fragaria × ananassa, places this hybrid species among the
most genetically complex crop plants. Paradoxically, the

~200 Mbp size of the basic (x = 7) strawberry genome
[3,4] ranks among the lowest of crop plant C values. The
discordance between small basic genome size and wide
ranging genomic complexities makes Fragaria a unique
system in which to study the effects of reticulate evolution, polyploidization, domestication, and breeding on
genes and genomes.
While the cultivated strawberry's genome is complex,
extant diploid species provide the opportunity to analyze
simpler yet relevant genomes as appropriate comparators
to the cultivated octoploids. The widely distributed diploid (2 n = 2 x = 14) species Fragaria vesca has been
implicated as an ancestral subgenome donor to the
octoploid strawberries: F. ×ananassa and its immediate
ancestors F. chiloensis and F. virginiana [5]. Thus, F. vesca

provides an outstanding system for addressing genetic
and genomic questions relevant to the octoploid strawberries, as well as to the entire Rosaceae family [6]. Existing genomics resources for F. vesca include mapping
populations and linkage maps [7,8], an efficient genetic
transformation system for reverse genetics [9,10], growing EST support [11], and forthcoming whole-genome
sequence information [12].
Large scale projects aimed at sequencing the complete
genomes of many crop and model plant species have been
preceded by smaller scale efforts that informatively sample and annotate limited but representative genomic
regions. Examples include the sequencing of: an initial
1.9 Mb contig from Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 4
[13], constituting about 1.4% of the 140 Mbp Arabidopsis
genome; six BAC clones, comprising 592 kb or 0.06% of
the 950 Mbp tomato genome [14]; and BAC ends that
generated 17 Mb of sequence or 4.7% of the 372 Mbp
papaya genome [15]. Detailed analysis and annotation of
these genomic sequence samples provided initial insights
into genome composition, gene number, and other
parameters that could help to guide, or in some cases
physically anchor, a subsequent complete genome
sequencing project.
In a companion paper [16], we examined a random
sampling of 30 F. vesca genomic sequence segments comprising ~1.0 Mb, or ~0.5% of the F. vesca genome. The key
resource for that and the present study was a fosmid
library from F. vesca; constructed from physically sheared
and blunt-end cloned genomic DNA fragments from F.
vesca ssp. americana 'Pawtuckaway' [17,18]. On the basis
of that representative genomic sampling, we concluded
that the F. vesca genome contains about 30,500 proteinencoding genes, plus > 4700 truncated gene fragments.
Over 30 new repeat families were identified, the most
common of which were long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Total transposable element (TE) content
of the F. vesca ssp. americana genome was estimated to
be at least 16%.
In the present study, our aim was to examine a specific
set of genomic sequences and gene neighborhoods, targeted for study because they contain genes of likely relevance to horticultural and fruit quality traits, with
emphasis on metabolic pathways, flowering-related
genes, and disease resistance-related genes. The alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH) was targeted on the basis of its use
in ongoing phylogenetic studies in Fragaria [4,19], and
for its historical status as the first protein-encoding gene
to be sequenced in strawberry [20]. The granule-bound
starch synthase I (GBSSI) gene was also of interest relevant to its use in phylogenetic studies of Fragaria [5] and
the Rosaceae [21].
Our approach necessarily differed from that of the previous study [16], because our focus was on the features of

specifically targeted genomic sites rather than on representative genomic sampling. We herein present a detailed
description of 20 genomic regions comprising 0.71 Mb of
DNA sequence. This description encompasses the identification and annotation of putative genes, pseudogenes,
and repetitive elements. It is expected that the results
reported herein will be of particular value to plant biologists interested in the studied genes and the traits to
which they may relate, and to molecular breeders pursuing the genetic improvement of strawberry and/or other
members of the Rosaceae family.

Results
Fosmid library

The CTAB isolation procedure produced genomic DNA
fragments in the 40 kb size range, evidently a consequence of random, procedure-induced physical shearing.
Following end-repair, this genomic DNA was used in a
single ligation reaction to construct the fosmid library,
which consisted of 33,295 clones arrayed in eighty-seven
384-well plates and spotted in ordered pairs onto multiply replicated sets of two high-density filters.
Filter hybridizations

Of twenty protein-encoding gene probes used in filter
hybridizations, eighteen probes yielded at least one PCRconfirmed target clone. One fosmid clone was selected
for each of sixteen probes, while two fosmid clones with
distinctly differing restriction fragment patterns were
selected for sequencing from each of two probes: gRGA2
and TPS. Thus, a total of 18 protein-encoding gene
probes were used to select 20 fosmids (Table 1) to be subcloned and sequenced.
Fosmid Insert Sequences

Uninterrupted insert sequences bounded by vector ends
were obtained from 13 of 20 fosmid clones. These insert
contigs ranged in length from 29,623 bp to 42,439 bp
(Table 1). Of the remaining 7 clones, sequence assembly
generated two (2 clones) or three (5 clones) ordered contigs (Table 1). For the 7 multi-contig clones, the sum of
contig sequence lengths varied from 31,107 bp to 44,532
bp. The total length of insert sequence generated from
the 20 selected fosmids was 708,363 bp, or an average of
35,418 bp per insert. These sequences have been deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers listed in
Table 1.
Identification of Genetic Elements

As detailed below, several categories of genetic elements
were identified, including protein-encoding genes and
pseudogenes, expressed sequences, transposable elements (TEs), and other repetitive elements including simple sequence repeats (SSRs). The results of the
bioinformatic analyses are presented in two forms: tabu-

FGENESH gene prediction. The term "genes merged" refers to the cumulative number of genes involved in such gene mergers.
predictions of start and stop codons were considered to be validated if support for their predicted locations was obtained from
examination of ORFs in homologous sequences identified by Blast homology searches.

the annotated gene sites, including strand assignments,
putative start and stop codon sites, and putative gene
product identity. A more detailed listing of the homology-based evidence supporting each gene site identification is provided in Additional file 1: Fosmid Gene
Content Annotation.
Ab initio predictions (Fosmid Figures: Part A)

The number of predicted protein-encoding genes varied
considerably among the six FGENESH models (Table 2),
ranging from a low of 115 (Mt model) to a high of 208 (Nt
model), with an overall mean of 152.5. As detailed below,
the subsequent generation of a set of homology-based
inferences provided a basis for comparison with the outputs of the six ab initio models.
Blastx homology (Fosmid Figures: Part B)

Blastx searches of the NCBI Arabidopsis and Viridiplantae protein databases, employing the fosmid inserts as
query sequences, were used to identify protein-encoding
gene sites, including intact genes, pseudogenes, and TErelated proteins. Using a conservative cutoff of e = 10-10
[16], a total of 123 gene sites were identified, while a less
conservative cutoff of e = 10-5 yielded eight additional
gene sites. With reference to their best Blastx matches, 11
gene sites encoded TE-related proteins (reverse transcriptase, transposase, polyprotein, etc.), 100 encoded

Blastn homology to Fragaria and Rosaceae ESTs (Fosmid
Figures: Part C)

In total, Blastn searches of the NCBI Rosaceae EST database (conducted prior to June 1, 2009) recovered 128
"top-tier" (≥ 95% sequence identity) EST matches, of
which 126 were from Fragaria (F-ESTs) [Additional file 1:
Fosmid Gene Content Annotation, Columns K, L, M, N,
O and P] and two were from Rosa. Top-tier F-EST coverage varied considerably among the 131 Blastx-inferred
gene sites. Fifty-five gene sites had one or more top-tier
F-EST matches, while 76 had none. Fifteen genes sites
had complete EST coverage [Additional file 1: Fosmid
Gene Content Annotation - coded in red], providing a
basis for establishing gene models, as addressed below.
Numerous "second-tier" (85-94% identity range) ESTs
from Fragaria and other rosaceous species (including
Malus, Prunus, Rosa, Rubus, and Pyrus) occurred at
many of the identified gene sites [Additional file 1: Fosmid Gene Content Annotation, Columns Q, R and S], and
elsewhere within the fosmid sequences. The second tier
F-ESTs were denoted by rounded boxes in the Fosmid
Figures.
Several top-tier F-EST matches occurred at genomic
sites that lacked Blastx matches and FGENESH predictions. Six such gene sites occurred at fosmid insert
boundaries, where the match comprised a 5' or 3' UTR
sequence but little or no coding sequence. In the absence
of recognizable coding sequence within the fosmid
boundaries, these putative gene sites were invisible to
FGENESH and Blastx. Additionally, two F-EST sites that
lacked Blastx matches and FGENESH predictions
occurred internally in the inserts. Gene site 9 in fosmid
08G19 (Figure 12) was defined by F-ESTs [GenBank:
DY667692 and DY674185], and gene site 3 in fosmid
52B01 (Figure 15) was also defined by an F-EST [GenBank: DY670302]. These F-ESTs lacked obvious ORFS,
and Blastx searches using the ESTs themselves as queries
obtained no quality matches. Thus, the F-ESTs in question may be non-coding, or may encode previously undescribed proteins.
Comparison of ab initio predictions and homology-based
inferences

Homology-based inferences of gene site numbers and
locations and of start and stop codon positions provided
a basis for evaluating the differing outputs of the six
FGENESH ab initio models. As previously noted, the
number of predicted genes varied considerably among ab

Figure 1 Fosmid Key. The gene space diagrams that accompany this text share a common format for presentation of figures. Analysis of fosmids
includes five horizontal panels: A through E (as depicted on the left side of the figure). Panel A graphically depicts the ab initio gene location and orientation predictions of the six FGENESH training models. Panel B depicts the outputs of Blastx searches of the GenBank non-redundant protein database, delimited to Arabidopsis. Panel C depicts the outputs of Blastn comparisons against Rosaceae ESTs. Panel D depicts the inferred locations and
orientations of the putative gene sites inferred on the basis of Blastx homology-based analysis, and also depicts the locations of transposable element
sites detected by structural analysis. Panel E provides a description of SSR content as detected by the SSRIT analysis. The information to the right provides a range of descriptive information that is found throughout Panels A-E. On the right side of the figure, the various icons used in the Fosmid Figures are defined.

initio models (Table 2). As compared with the number of
131 Blastx inferred gene sites, the Mo (115) and Vv (121)
models under-predicted, while the remaining models
over-predicted the number of protein-encoding genetic
elements.
Under-prediction was primarily due to "gene merging":
the prediction of one large gene over a region wherein
two or more separate genes were detected by homology
search (e.g., Figure 11, gene sites 2 and 3). The Vv model
generated a high of 16 such "gene mergers", involving a
total of 38 Blastx-inferred genes, while the Nt model generated only 3 gene mergers, involving 7 Blastx-inferred
genes (Table 2). Over-prediction was primarily due to
absence of homology-based evidence of gene location at
some sites of ab initio prediction. The number of non-

validated ab initio predictions ranged from a high of 65
(Nt) to a low of 9 (Mo) (Table 2).
For each of the Blastx-identified genes, start and stop
codon positions were inferred on the basis of homology
searches supplemented by manual examination of reading frames as displayed by SeqBuilder (DNAStar), utilizing comparisons to F-ESTs wherever possible. This
homology-based analysis established the putative locations of 93 start and 92 stop codons.
The discrepancy between the homology based inference of 131 gene sites and the substantially lesser numbers of inferred start and stop codon locations was
attributable to several factors. Nineteen of the 131 gene
sites were artifactually truncated at their 5' or 3' ends,
either by a fosmid end or by a contig gap. Because no contig gaps interrupted genes of specific interest, effort was

not invested in closing these gaps, with the expectation
that they soon will be closed by the anticipated whole
genome sequencing of Fragaria vesca. Another obstacle
was "biological truncation" [16], in which a terminal segment of a coding region is missing due to deletion or rearrangement. As many as 20 of the identified gene sites
appeared to be truncated pseudogenes, as evidenced by
substantial shortening of the predicted protein as com-

pared with its putative Arabidopsis homolog. Of the 11
TE-related gene sites, only one start codon and two stop
codons could be identified. Lack of EST support also precluded establishment of start and/or stop codon positions
in many genes.
When the homology-inferred 93 start and 92 stop
codon locations were compared to those predicted for the
respective genes by the FGENESH models (Table 2), the

Gene Models

Using the GeneSeqer program, intron locations were
determined in each of the 15 genes for which complete
coding sequence (cds) EST coverage was available. This
information, in combination with previously detailed
determinations of start and stop codon locations, pro-

vided a basis for defining gene models [Additional file 2:
Gene Models]. Among the 15 modeled genes, intron
number ranged from zero to nine per gene, with a mean
of 2.87. The intron size range, from 84 bp to 933 bp,
approximated a Poisson distribution, with 23 of 43
introns falling below 150 bp in length and 30 falling below

A central objective of this project was to obtain the complete genomic sequences of a suite of targeted genes that
were of potentially broad interest to the Fragaria/Rosa-

clone contained a gene site that clearly corresponded,
with ≥ 98% nucleotide sequence identity, to its respective
hybridization probe. Each of the targeted genes was contained entirely within the respective fosmid boundaries,
providing knowledge of promoter and other flanking regulatory sequences. Noteworthy features of these targeted

its immediate neighbor a pentatricopeptide (PPR) gene (site 5). The gene of unknown function at site 3 has complete top-tier F-EST coverage, and
was modeled. Gene site 7 encodes a putative transposable-element-related protein.

Regulator of Anthocyanin Synthesis (RAN)

Fosmid 76C08 (Figure 5) was selected by a probe targeted
to a Del-like regulatory gene designated as RAN in strawberry [22]. The probe sequence has 98% nucleotide identity to a region of gene site 6 on the same fosmid. In

taxon-delimited Blastx searches, this gene site had the
following best protein matches: GL3 (GLABRA 3) and
transcription factor (bHLH 1) (Arabidopsis); and myclike anthocyanin regulatory protein (Viridiplantae). One

genes (sites 2 and 3), of which the site 3 gene was the best match to the hybridization probe. Site 2 has one top-tier F-EST match that does not provide
complete EST coverage, but suggests that this gene site is transcribed. Site 3 had no top-tier F-EST coverage. An LTR retrotransposon was identified

gene site 4, and at its N terminal end to gene sites 6 and 7.

the 5' end(s) of the F. vesca SOC gene - a hypothesis that

Figure 21 gLRR Resistance-like gene neighborhood. On fosmid 49M15, the evident probe target was a disease resistance protein family gene at
site 4a. Site 4b has Blastx homology to a squalene epoxidase gene. Both genes are on the plus strand. Neither the stop codon of gene 4a nor the start
codon of gene 4b could be confidently determined. Moreover, the two respective coding regions are bridged by a matching 1447 bp Malus cDNA
sequence [GenBank: EG631376], suggesting that region 4a + 4b may be transcribed as a single unit. Note that regions 4a-4b are merged into one gene

sequence similarity to NBS-LRR resistance-like proteins
encoded by both members of tandemly duplicated Arabidopsis loci At3g14460 and At3g14470.

LRR disease resistance-like gene

Fosmid 49M15 (Figure 21) was selected by its hybridization to the probe gLRR at gene site 4a. This gene site had

Davis et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/81

as its best Blastx match a disease resistance family protein
encoded by Arabidopsis locus At2g34930, and had no
top-tier F-EST matches. The 3' structure of this gene is
ambiguous, with evidence from a Malus (apple) cDNA
sequence suggesting that this gene may be transcriptionally merged with the neighboring squalene epoxidase-like
gene (site 4b).
Micro-colinearity with Arabidopsis

By cross-referencing Arabidopsis proteins identified by
Blastx to their respective physical map positions,
instances of microcolinearity or conserved microsynteny
with Arabidopsis thaliana were identified in twelve fosmids, involving a total of 36 putative Fragaria genes
(Table 3). As an example of microcolinearity in fosmid
08G19 (Figure 12), Fragaria genes 2 and 3 are homologous to Arabidopsis loci At3g54340 and At3g54350. As
examples of interrupted colinearity but conserved
microsynteny, Fragaria genes 4 and 6 in fosmid 76K13
(Figure 10) are homologous to Arabidopsis loci
At1g21600 and At1g21610, while Fragaria genes 5 and 6
in fosmid 10B08 (Figure 11) are homologous to Arabidopsis loci At1g27880 and At1g27850.
Transposable-Element-Related Sequences

Two full length COPIA-type LTR retrotransposons were
identified: one on fosmid 14K06 (Figure 6 - site 2) and
one on fosmid 19M24 (Figure 18). Single Mutator-like
elements were identified on fosmids 10B08 (Figure 11)
and 52B01 (Figure 15 - site 2). Gene sites 4 and 1 on fosmids 73I22 (Figure 2) and 76C08 (Figure 5), respectively,
encoded putative reverse transcriptase-related proteins,
while gene sites 1 and 5 on fosmids 14K06 (Figure 6) and
49M15 (Figure 21), respectively, encoded transposaselike proteins. Blastx searches detected retroviral polyprotein-like sequences on fosmids 08G19 (Figure 12 - site 7),
19H07 (Figure 16 - site 8), 53J04 (Figure 9 - site 7), and
53O08 (Figure 4 - site 4).
SSR content

Any uninterrupted tract of five or more identical repeat
units (of repeat length ≤ 5 nucleotides) was counted as an
SSR by the SSRIT analysis. Part E of each Fosmid Figure
depicts the locations, motif sequences, and repeat lengths
of these SSR sites. The number of SSR sites per fosmid
insert varied from zero (fosmid 32L07 - Figure 20) to 19
(fosmid 49M15 - Figure 21). The total number of qualifying SSRs found in the 20 targeted fosmid inserts was 158,
giving an average SSR distribution of ~1 per 4.5 kb (Table
4). There were 123 di-nucleotide repeat SSRs and 35 trinucleotide repeats, and no tetra- or penta- nucleotide
repeats. Of SSRs with repeat numbers of 18 or more, two
were AT (= AT and TA) repeats and 13 were AG (= AG
and CT) repeats. The eight longest SSR tracts were all AG
repeats, ranging from 24 to 38 repeats. Among tri-nucle-

Page 27 of 32

otide repeat types, AAG (= AAG, AGA, and GAA)
repeats were by far the most common. The numbers/frequencies of the various SSR repeat types are summarized
in Table 4.

Discussion
Our evaluation of targeted gene space in the strawberry
diploid species, Fragaria vesca, unveils new knowledge
about 20 important genomic neighborhoods: information
that can guide a diversity of gene- or trait-specific investigations, and facilitate site-specific molecular marker
development. Moreover, the cumulative generation of
over 1.75 Mb of genomic sequence by the present investigation of 20 gene-targeted sites and its companion study
of 31 randomly selected sites [16], provides an invaluable
baseline of robustly assembled and carefully annotated
Sanger sequence data to which future Next Generation
data sets and high throughput bioinformatic analyses can
be compared and assessed. We anticipate that the experience gained through this effort will contribute valuable
perspective, precedent, and impetus to whole genome
sequencing efforts in Fragaria.
Although our assessment of gene content ultimately
relied on homology-based methods, ab initio predictions
provided an illuminating framework within which to
organize and interpret homology-based determinations.
In undertaking a comparison of the six higher plant ab
initio training models (Arabidopsis, Medicago, monocot,
Nicotiana, Lycopersicon, Vitis) accessible on Softberry's
FGENESH website [23], we hypothesized that the taxa
most closely related phylogenetically to Fragaria would
provide the best training models for our analysis. According to the most recent release of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group [24], the ordered phylogenetic distances of the
six training model taxa from Fragaria (order Rosales) are
(closest to most distant) Medicago (Fabales) <Arabidopsis
(Brassicales) <Vitis (Vitales) <Nicotiana and Lycopersicon
(Solonales) < monocots. By one measure, the "accurate"
prediction of start and stop codons, the Medicago (Mt)
model was marginally better than the Arabidopsis (At)
model, and both of these surpassed the remaining four
predictive models. It would be of considerable interest to
know whether and to what extent an FGENESH model
trained on Rosaceae sequence data would outperform the
Mt and At models for predictive analysis of Fragaria
sequence; however, such a model was not available for the
present study.
Our analysis indicated that the six FGENESH models
were variably prone to over-prediction, under-prediction,
gene-merging, and/or gene-splitting. However, with
knowledge of these tendencies in hand, the overall perspective provided by comparisons among these disparate
models provided a useful backdrop to the interpretation
of homology-based analyses, helping to draw attention to

Davis et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/81

structural anomalies worthy of further exploration. On
balance, our experience suggests that integrated consideration of all six FGENESH model outputs provided maximal insight into the genetic content of the studied
Fragaria sequences. As easily visualized by viewing a
broad sampling of the Fosmid Figures, the FGENESH
models were in substantial agreement in some genomic
regions, but at considerable variance in others. Yet such
disagreements are themselves informative, potentially
drawing attention to sites of unconventional functionality.
Gene content

The genomic frequency of gene sites identified in our
study of 20 gene-targeted fosmid clones is similar to that
found in 31 randomly selected clones from the same
genomic library [16]. Discounting 11 TE-related gene
sites, the present study identified 120 protein encoding
genes and pseudogenes within a total of ~708 kb, or an
average of one gene site per 5.9 kb. Similarly, the companion study identified 182 gene sites in 1,035 kb, or one
gene per 5.7 kb [16]. That an intentional focus on generich, as opposed to randomly selected, genomic sites
yielded similar protein-encoding gene densities is consistent with the finding that TE and other repetitive
sequence content in the F. vesca genome is quite low [16],
and that most of this genome is, in fact, gene rich.
A surprising finding in the present study was the number of targeted genes, as well as non-targeted genes, that
were tandemly duplicated. Full length tandem gene duplications of targeted genes were seen in fosmids 14K06
(ADH), 73I22 (CHS), 41O22 (TPS), 76K13 (PISTILLATA),
19M24 (NBS-LRR resistance-like), and 34E24 (NBS-LRR
resistance-like). Tandem or near-tandem duplications of
genes or gene fragments not targeted by probes were also
seen. Such duplications involved apparently truncated
pseudogenes on fosmids 13I24 (CIPK20 KINASE), 32L07
(SMC2), and 41O22 (pentatricopeptide containing protein). On fosmid 08G19, two apparently full-length copies
of a small basic intrinsic protein gene flanked a retroelement-like sequence. Although the clustering and neighboring duplication of disease resistance-like genes is a
well-known phenomenon in plants [25], it is noteworthy
that, excluding the resistance-like genes, none of the
homologues to the tandemly duplicated Fragaria genes
enumerated above were themselves tandemly duplicated
in Arabidopsis.
EST support varied with respect to the members of tandem gene duplicates. Substantial EST support existed for
both CHS copies. In contrast, EST support was lacking
for ADH-1, but was sufficient to allow definition of a gene
model for ADH-2. Only one of the two Pistillata copies
had top-tier EST support. Similarly, only one of the two
tandemly duplicated NBS-LLR resistance-like genes on

Page 28 of 32

fosmid 19M24 had any top-tier EST support, while no
such EST support existed for either TPS copy on fosmid
41O22 or for the single copy on fosmid 53J04. The
absence of EST support for one or both members of a
tandemly duplicated gene pair might be the consequence
of differential expression patterns, or might simply be
attributable to sampling bias in the existing Fragaria EST
database, wherein most of the currently available
sequences are from whole seedlings of Fragaria vesca
subjected to a handful of stressors. Alternately, absence of
EST support might be indicative of mutational gene
silencing, which is one of several possible evolutionary
fates of duplicated genes [26]. Resolution of these possibilities awaits the much needed expansion of the Fragaria
EST database to include a comprehensive diversity of tissue types, and representation of influence by a broad
spectrum of environmental variables.
Targeted genes

The complete elucidation of candidate gene sequences
from strawberry opens many opportunities to now test
functional predictions as they relate to plant productivity.
Clearly the information identified from analysis of
LEAFY, SOC, PHYA, HY5 and CO all may present a
means to now translate information about flowering from
Arabidopsis and other species to strawberry. Strawberry
species exhibit a wide range of photoperiodic behaviors.
These are of intense interest to breeders as photoperiod
sensitivity strongly dictates the utility of a given cultivar.
Anthocyanin pigmentation is an important aspect of
fruit color and quality, but also can be a factor in stress
resistance and other physiological functions and environmental interactions throughout the plant [27]. The identified CHS, CHI, DFR, and RAN genes are likely to be
factors in many aspects of anthocyanin pigment composition and spatiotemporal distribution. Along with the
anthocyanin pathway gene products, terpene synthases
play a demonstrated role in flavor and fragrance as
aspects for fruit quality, also making them of interest to
strawberry breeders.
Two other metabolic genes, ADH and GBSSI, were of
interest because of their widespread usage in plants [28],
and their specific recent usage in Fragaria [5,19,29], for
phylogenetic analysis. The finding that the ADH gene is
tandemly duplicated in F. vesca, and the differential EST
support for its two gene copies, further extends the
potential interest in ADH as a focal point for comparative
evolutionary studies in Fragaria. The GBSSI gene
sequence described herein is that of GBSSI-1, as distinct
from the GBSSI-2 gene used in the phylogenetic analysis
of Fragaria by Rousseau-Gueutin et al. [5]. The presence
of at least two copies of the GBSSI gene is a general feature of the Rosaceae family [21].

Davis et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/81

Disease resistance genes are of central interest to plant
breeders. Conserved segments of NBS-LRR resistancelike genes have been isolated from genomic DNA in many
plant species, including strawberry [30], using degenerate
primers targeted to conserved sites [31]. The NBS-LRR
and LRR resistance-like gene sequences we present here
are the first complete genomic disease-resistance like
gene sequences to be reported in strawberry.
Colinearity

As the number of sequenced genomes grows, various
studies have examined gene arrangement between
sequenced genomes in the interest of inferring evolutionary relationships. One recent study defined microsyntenic relationships by examining colinearity of Prunus (a
close taxonomic neighbor of Fragaria), Populus, Medicago and Arabidopsis. A positive relationship was defined
as a distance not less than 200 kb that contained four
gene pairs [32]. Comparisons using this approach relating
Prunus and Arabidopsis genomes indicated that
microsynteny is not well-conserved between these species. In the present study gene-pair relationships were
examined between the genes ordered in the fosmids and
the known gene order in Arabidopsis. Not surprisingly,
similar results were obtained to those in the Prunus-Arabidopsis comparisons. The data in Table 3 indicate that
out of the set of 20 fosmid clones, only nine shared evidence of potential gene-pair relationships with Arabidopsis.
The data agree well with the conclusions of Jung et al.
[32]. There are some clear special cases that should be
considered carefully. The two adjacent genes on fosmid
34E24 are NBS-LRR genes. These are typically found as
proximally located members of a multigene family, so it is
not surprising that these would be detected as colinear in
these analyses. Two fosmids contain strawberry terpene
synthase genes, where Arabidopsis only has one. In both
cases an immediate neighbor is an Arabidopsis gene, yet a
gene found on different linkage groups. This finding indicates the possibility that the terpene synthase gene may
have been a site for duplication in strawberry relative to a
common ancestor, or perhaps a site of duplication within
strawberry.
EST support and coverage

The genomic sequence analyzed provides a means to test
gene prediction against actual gene-coding sequence,
best estimated by analysis of EST relationships. Of the
total predicted genes on all fosmids, approximately half
(78/148) maintain >85% identity with an EST in the Viridiplantae database. When compared against ESTs from the
Rosaceae even fewer matches were obtained, and those
were typically from Malus, Rosa and Prunus where significant EST resources exist. Of all of the sequences featur-

Page 29 of 32

ing EST cognates, only fourteen genes have sufficient
EST support to provide complete delineation of exon/
intron boundaries as a basis for gene modeling, while 76
gene sites had no top-tier Fragaria EST support. Exemplifying the latter case, support was lacking for fosmid
08G19 gene 3 (Figure 12) and fosmid 10B08 gene 1 (Figure 11). The first is annotated only as an embryo defective transcript and the second is Leafy. Both of these are
examples where transcripts may be expected to be found
in specialized tissues and/or developmental contexts.
Therefore, it is not surprising that representative cDNA
sequences do not appear in the public databases, wherein
over 90% of sequences represent seedling transcripts in
response to abiotic stress.
Taken together, these findings indicate the need for
more Fragaria EST coverage, especially from specific tissues and developmental states. EST coverage from other
diploid species, such as Fragaria iinumae, will be helpful
in the development of subgenome-specific markers in the
cultivated strawberry Fragaria ×ananassa. The reciprocal condition also exists, where fosmid-based sequences
have EST coverage, but it is either confined to the Rosaceae (no match in Viridiplantae) or possibly strawberry
specific (no match beyond Fragaria). These uncharacterized expressed sequences are abundant in EST collections
but were not identified in this study.
SSR loci

The identification of SSR loci for use as potential molecular markers for linkage mapping, marker assisted selection, and diversity studies has received considerable
attention in Fragaria [33,34]. A total of 158 SSRs of five or
more homogeneous repeat tracts were identified. Of the
di-nucleotide repeat motif types, AG and AT were by far
the most common, as has also been reported in species as
diverse as Arabidopsis and rice [35]. Among tri-nucleotide repeat types, AAG was the most common, eclipsing
the frequency of any other tri-nucleotide type by a factor
of at least 2.8. AAG is also the most common tri-nucleotide repeat motif in Arabidopsis, while CCG is the most
common type in rice [35].
The utilized SSRIT program counts only uninterrupted
repeat tracts as SSRs. Thus, a continuous sequence such
as (TCC)6TCT(TCC)5 (as in fosmid 14K06, SSRs D and E)
would be counted as two SSRs by SSRIT because the two
TCC tracts are interrupted by a TCT. From the perspective of PCR primer pair design for SSR marker genotyping, this and several other instances of close-proximity
SSR tracts would have to be treated as a single SSR locus,
amplified by a single primer pair. Thus, the total number
of operationally defined SSR loci detected in the fosmid
inserts is somewhat less than the total number of 158
counted SSRs. If any pair of SSR tracts separated by less
than 100 bp is counted as constituting a single opera-

Davis et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/81

tional SSR locus for purposes of molecular marker development, there are 144 discrete SSR loci, with a frequency
of 1 SSR locus per 4.9 kb, or about 200 SSR loci per Mb.
The current F. vesca linkage map [8] has a total length
of 424 cM. Given the 206 Mb size of the F. vesca genome,
there is an average ratio of 486 kb/cM. Extrapolating from
these data, SSR loci are distributed in the F. vesca genome
with a density of about 92 SSR loci per 1 cM of map distance, thus indicating that sufficient SSR loci exist to support the construction of SSR-based linkage maps to a
resolution of well under 1 cM.
Repetitive elements

In this study, thirteen TE-related elements were detected
on the basis of Blastx homology and structural analysis. A
thorough analysis of TE-related and other repetitive element content in 31 random sequence samples comprising
~1 Mbp in F. vesca was presented in the companion study
[16], while Ma et al. [36] reported the isolation of retroelement sequences from Fragaria ×ananassa. No top-tier
EST support was found for any of the TE-related
sequences identified in the present study or that of Ma et
al. [36], and no evidence of contemporary TE transpositional activity has been reported to date in Fragaria.

Conclusions
Characterization of a targeted sampling of gene space in
strawberry provides tremendous information that can be
used on many levels. First, a comprehensive accounting
of genic regions revealed by Sanger sequencing will
inform and guide high throughput, whole genome
sequencing efforts, and serve to anchor short-read
sequencing assemblies. The focus on genes with known
roles in biological processes relevant to agricultural production allows comparative study of these genes and their
nascent transcripts, and development of markers for use
in breeding and selection. The results allow contrast with
other genomes, spotlighting the surprising tendency for
gene duplications in strawberry. The detailed characterization of diploid strawberry gene space also is a reference point that will permit comparisons with other
diploid and polyploid Fragaria species, further unveiling
evolutionary relationships in this economically important
genus.
Methods
Plant Material

Fragaria vesca ssp. americana variety 'Pawtuckaway' was
collected from a site on Mt. Pawtuckaway in Deerfield,
New Hampshire by T. M. Davis and S. Williamson, and
was propagated and maintained in the Department of
Biological Sciences Greenhouse facility at the University
of New Hampshire (UNH). It has been donated to the
National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR) [37] in

Page 30 of 32

Corvallis, OR, wherein it is identified as accession CFRA
1948.001 (PI 657856).
DNA Extraction

Total genomic DNA was isolated from two grams of
freshly harvested, unexpanded leaves from greenhousegrown plants using a modified 2% CTAB protocol [38],
but without addition of 100 μl 24:1 chloroform:octanol to
the tissue slurry after grinding in liquid nitrogen. Modifications also included the addition of antioxidants (0.10%
(w/v) ascorbic acid/0.13% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite
(Na2O5S2), added to CTAB just prior to use, followed by
incubation on ice rather than at 60°C. No steps were
taken to exclude organelle DNA.
Fosmid Library Construction

Fosmid cloning was performed using the Epicentre CopyControl™ Fosmid Library Production Kit per the manufacturer's instructions (Epicentre, Madison, WI). Endrepaired DNA (264 ng) was ligated into the CopyControl™ pCC1FOS™ fosmid vector (Epicentre), packaged,
transfected into EPI300™-T1R E. coli cells (Epicentre), and
the transformed cells were stored in a 20% glycerol freezing buffer at -80°C. Fosmid clones were robotically picked
into 384-well plates (Genetix, Boston, MA) and spotted
in duplicate onto Performa II high-performance, positively charged, nylon high-density filters (Genetix) using
a Genetix Qbot at the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies (HCGS), UNH. Clones were grown in a 4% glycerol
enriched LB freezing buffer, and stored at -80°C.
Probe Construction, Filter Hybridization, and Clone Selection

Labeled probes with an average size of 650 bp were synthesized by incorporation of Biotin-16-2'-deoxy-uridine5'-triphosphate (Biotin-16-dUTP) (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN) into PCR products. Primer pairs used in probe synthesis were designed using DNAStar LaserGene PrimerSelect Mac OS X 5.53 software, based on unpublished
data generated in house, public domain Fragaria EST
sequences, or conserved regions of orthologous genes.
PCR reactions were prepared using MasterTaq kits
(Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). Filters were hybridized using
the Standard Hybridization protocol described in the
NEBlot® Phototope® Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA), with minor
modifications. Probes were used in multiplexed sets of
two to six. All clones to which protein-encoding, nuclear
gene probes hybridized were subjected to confirmatory
PCR screening using the same primer pairs used to generate the respective probes. When multiple clones were
obtained for a single probe, clones were fingerprinted by
restriction digestion, and insert ends were sequenced.
Any clone in which the target gene was adjacent to and
possibly truncated by the insert end was excluded from
subsequent sequencing.

Fosmid Subcloning and Sequencing

Fosmid clones that were selected on the basis of positive
hybridization to probes and further differentiated on the
basis of end-sequences and restriction digests were subcloned and sequenced as described in Pontaroli et al. [16].
Fosmid clones were sequenced to 14× redundancy, using
an ABI 3700 capillary sequencer with T3 and T7 primers
and ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator chemistry (Applied
BioSystems, Foster, CA). Base calling and quality assessment were done by using PHRED [39], and reads were
assembled with PHRAP. Contigs were ordered using
CONSED [40]. Assembled insert sequences were deposited into the GenBank database [41].
Bioinformatics

For each fosmid, predictions of protein-encoding gene
content, including start and stop codon predictions, were
obtained using FGENESH (Softberry) [23], as trained on
six reference models: Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Medicago sativa (Mt), Monocots (Mo), Nicotiana tabacum
(Nt), Lycopersicon esculentum (Le), and Vitis vinifera
(Vv). To obtain homology-based gene inferences, each
fosmid sequence was subjected to Blastx and Blastn
(NCBI) [41] queries of relevant GenBank databases using
default parameters, except that "maximum target
sequences" was set at 1000, and under formatting
options, "graphical overview" was set at 1000 and the
default low complexity filter was turned off. Blastx
searches were done against the Arabidopsis thaliana and
Viridiplantae databases, for the purposes of locating
putative protein-encoding genes and assigning them to
the plus or minus strand, inferring start and stop codon
locations, and establishing putative gene identities. Blastn
searches of the "EST others" database and limited to the
Rosaceae family of plants were used to identify supporting ESTs in Fragaria and other rosaceous species as a
means of further validating gene locations, inferring
start/stop codon positions, and identifying expressed
sites that lacked Blastx protein homology matches or
FGENESH gene predictions. The locations of inferred
start and stop codon sites were then compared to the
start and stop codon locations predicted for the respective genes by each of the FGENESH models. Blastn and
tBlastx searches of the Viridiplantae nr database were
performed on a limited, ad hoc basis as needed to resolve
questions that emerged from the systematic analyses.
Gene models for genes with complete EST coverage were
devised by integrating start and stop codon identifications with exon/intron boundary predictions generated
independently using GeneSeqer [42].
The identification of transposable-element-like
sequences employed a multifaceted approach. Full-length
LTR retrotransposons were discovered by structural
search using LTR_FINDER [43] and LTR_STRUC [44].

Page 31 of 32

Novel repeat elements were identified using RepeatModeler [45]. Blastx was also used to discern TE-related protein-encoding sequences.
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified using
SSRIT [46] with search parameters set for pentamers as
the maximum repeat length and five as the minimum
number of repeat units. The LaserGene ® suite of programs
(DNASTAR) was used for various purposes, including
visualization and annotation of reading frame translations,
construction of EST contigs, and sequence alignments.
