Abstract
Background: The Rickettsia genus includes 25 validated species, 17 of which are proven human
pathogens. Among these, the pathogenicity varies greatly, from the highly virulent R. prowazekii,
which causes epidemic typhus and kills its arthropod host, to the mild pathogen R. africae, the agent
of African tick-bite fever, which does not affect the fitness of its tick vector.
Results: We evaluated the clonality of R. africae in 70 patients and 155 ticks, and determined its
genome sequence, which comprises a circular chromosome of 1,278,540 bp including a tra operon
and an unstable 12,377-bp plasmid. To study the genetic characteristics associated with virulence,
we compared this species to R. prowazekii, R. rickettsii and R. conorii. R. africae and R. prowazekii have,
respectively, the less and most decayed genomes. Eighteen genes are present only in R. africae
including one with a putative protease domain upregulated at 37°C.
Conclusion: Based on these data, we speculate that a loss of regulatory genes causes an increase
of virulence of rickettsial species in ticks and mammals. We also speculate that in Rickettsia species
virulence is mostly associated with gene loss.
The genome sequence was deposited in GenBank under accession number [GenBank:
NZ_AAUY01000001].

Background
Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacteria mostly associated to arthropods, some of which caus-

ing mild to severe diseases in humans. Pathogenic species
are classified into two groups based on phylogenetic analyses [1]. The typhus group (TG) includes two Rickettsia

prowazekii (R. prowazekii) and R. typhi, and the spotted
fever group (SFG) includes 15 pathogenic species and
numerous species of unknown pathogenicity [2,3]. Two
additional validated species, R. bellii and R. canadensis,
and a variety of unvalidated species from insects or
leeches are organized into the most outer outgroups of the
genus Rickettsia [3-5]. The relatively low rate of lateral
gene transfer, the continuous gene loss and the colinearity
of most of their genomes make Rickettsia species an outstanding model for comparative genomics [4,6,7].
Indeed, genome reduction [8] paradoxically results in
higher virulence in R. prowazekii.
The pathogenic mechanisms of rickettsiae are unclear.
Within ticks, rickettsiae remain quiescent during the starvation of their vector but undergo a reversion to the virulent state, termed reactivation, following incubation at
37°C or blood meal [9]. This phenomenon is marked in
R. rickettsii by morphological changes in the microcapsular and slime layers [9]. The precise molecular mechanisms of this change, however, are only poorly
understood. During human infection, attachment to and
invasion of host cells were suggested to involve the outer
membrane proteins rOmpA and rOmpB and the adhesins
Adr1 and Adr2 [10,11]. A phospholipase D activity was
proposed to play a role in escape from phagosomes
[8,12], and intracellular motility was demonstrated to rely
on actin polymerization [13,14]. None of these factors
nor the presence of a type IV secretion system [15], however, explain the virulence differences observed among
Rickettsia species [6].
Over the last ten years, R. africae has emerged as the causative agent of African tick-bite fever [2], the most common
SFG rickettsiosis both in terms of seroprevalence [16] and
incidence [17-20]. Such an epidemiologic success is due
to various factors, including the increase of tourism to
wildlife parks in sub-Saharan Africa, the attack host-seeking behavior of its vector ticks,Amblyomma sp., and the elevated prevalence of R. africae in these ticks, with infection
rates of up to 100% [21]. In addition, the bacterium has
been identified in other areas with warm climates, such as
the West Indies, where it was found in Guadeloupe, Martinique, St Kitts and Nevis, and Antigua islands [2]. Such
a distribution, as well as the presence of R. africae in Reunion island, is likely to result from the transfer from Africa
of cattle bearing infected ticks [2]. Tick-associated rickettsiae may infect ticks feeding on infected hosts or may be
passed from one generation to the next transovarially. R.
africae is transmitted transovarially and appears to be the
most successful rickettsia in its adaptation to its vector
tick, as the prevalence of tick infection is higher than that
of any other rickettsia [22]. In addition, infection does not
appear to alter tick fitness (P. Parola, unpublished data).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/166

These data highlight the fact that R. africae is an extremely
successful and fit bacterium.
By comparison with R. conorii, the second most prevalent
SFG rickettsia in Africa, whose genome has previously
been sequenced [23], R. africae exhibits a higher prevalence in ticks [2], a lower virulence in humans [17], and a
greater genetic homogeneity [24]. The genetic factors
underlying these characteristics are, however, unknown.
We assumed that the R. africae genome sequence might
help understand the characteristics of this species and the
genetic mechanisms associated with the difference in virulence. Here, we present the sequence of the R. africae
genome and additional data that suggest that this species
has emerged recently. In support of this hypothesis, we
show that R. africae is a clonal population. We also
present data that support the assumption that rickettsial
virulence increases following gene inactivation.

Results
General Features of the Genome
The genome of R. africae consists of two replicons: a circular chromosome of 1,278,540 base pairs (bp) (Figure 1)
and a 12,377 bp circular plasmid (Table 1, Figure
2[25,26]). We acknowledge the fact that the ESF-5 strain,
first isolated in 1966 [27], may have undergone loss or
rearrangement of plasmid or chromosomal genes during
multiple passages in cell culture. Sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession number [GenBank:
NZ_AAUY01000001]. The chromosome has a G + C content of 32.4%, in the range of other SFG rickettsial
genomes (32.3 – 32.5%), whereas the plasmid has a G +
C content of 33.4%, similar to those of R. felis (33.2 and
33.6%) [28] but higher than that of R. massiliae plasmids
(31.4%). The predicted total complement of 1,271 open
reading frames (ORFs), 1,260 chromosomal (78.26%
coding sequence), and 11 plasmidic (81.3% coding
sequence) ORFs [see Additional file 1], is in the range of
genomes from SFG rickettsiae with the exception of R.
felis, which exhibits a larger genome (Table 1). Of these,
1,117 (87.9%) exhibited homologs in the non-redundant
database, and 1,024 (80.5%) were assigned putative functions [see Additional file 2]. Overall, the 1,260 chromosomal ORFs encoded 1,112 protein-coding genes, with 87
of these being split into 2 to 10 ORFs by the presence of
one to several stop codons. By comparison with other SFG
genomes, R. africae had fewer split genes than any other
species with the exception of R. felis (Table 1). In addition,
R. africae exhibited a single rRNA operon, with non-contiguous 16S and 23S rRNA genes as in other rickettsial
genomes, 33 tRNAs and another three RNAs. The R. africae
chromosome exhibited an almost perfect colinearity with
the R. conorii genome [23], with the exception of a 88,459bp inversion [see Additional file 3]. At both extremities of
the inversion, there were repeats of the Rickettsia palindro-

mic element – 6 (RPE-6) familly. In this inverted fragment, R. africae exhibited 20 ORFs and 10 RPEs that were
absent from R. conorii. Among these 20 ORFs, a cluster of
11 consecutive ORFs had orthologs in the 3'-extremity of
the Tra cluster previously identified in the R. massiliae
genome [29]. These 11 ORFs included traDF (ORF0650),
a transposase (ORF0651), spoT15 (ORF0652), a split
spoT13 (ORF0653/ORF0654), a split spoT6 (ORF0655/
ORF0656), a split signal transduction histidine kinase
(ORF0657/ORF0658), dam2, a site-specific DNA adenine
methylase (ORF0659), and ORF0660 of unknown function (Figure 3). In addition to the orthologs in R. massiliae,
these genes had orthologs in similar clusters in R. felis, R.
bellii, R. canadensis and O. tsutsugamushi but were absent
from all other species. As in R. massiliae, R. bellii and R.
canadensis, the R. africae cluster was bounded at its 3'-end
by a tRNA-Val, but, in contrast with these three species,
neither an integrase with its attI site nor a tRNA-Val fragment marker of integration was present at the 5' end (Figure 3). The presence of a similar gene cluster inserted at
the same position in several Rickettsia species, with a GC
content different from that of the genome (29.78% vs
32.4%, respectively, in R. africae) suggests that it was
acquired horizontally from a common ancestor and then
transmitted vertically. In R. africae, an attC site, specific to

integron-inserted gene cassettes, located at the 3'-end
(coordinates: 687890–688018) of the spoT15 gene
(ORF652), supports the role of integration in the insertion of this gene cluster. AttC sites were also identified in
R. massiliae (coordinates: 743029–743145), R. felis (coordinates: 407889–408017), and R. bellii (coordinates
468143–468211). Nevertheless, the presence of transposases in all species and the fact that, in R. felis, nine of
these genes are located in the pRF plasmid support the
role of several genetic mechanisms at the origin of this
cluster, possibly involving plasmids, integrons and transposons. In comparison with other species containing this
gene cluster, R. africae had the smallest number of genes.
In particular, it lacked most of the Tra cluster, with the
exception of traDF, but retained three spoT genes, including two degraded to pseudogenes. In R. bellii and R. massiliae, tra genes were described as encoding components of
a type IV secretion system (T4SS) for conjugal DNA transfer [15,29]. In terms of gene content, the R. africae cluster
was more similar to those of R. felis and R. canadensis, with
the loss of the Tra cluster, the conservation of spoT genes
and the presence of pseudogenes, than to those of R. massiliae and R. bellii, in which the Tra cluster was intact but
spoT genes were partially degraded. Such findings suggest
that species-specific evolution of this gene cluster

occurred, which likely resulted from gene excisions in R.
africae, R. felis and R. canadensis, or gene expansion by
transposase duplication in R. massiliae.
In addition to the traDF gene described above, the R. africae chromosome retained many of the components of the
type IV secretion system (T4SS) involved in both DNA
transfer and effector translocation in other bacteria [30],
including virB1, virB2 (ORF0232), virB3 (ORF0128),
virB4 (ORF0129, ORF1109), virB6 (ORF0130, ORF0131,
ORF0132, ORF0133, ORF0134, ORF0135), virB8

virB10 (ORF0363), virB11(ORF0364), and virD4
(ORF0365). In addition, R. africae possessed a traX
(ORF0816) and a split fimD (ORF0592/ORF0593/

ORF0594) gene but lacked other Tra cluster genes found
in R. massiliae, R. felis, R. bellii and O. tsutsugamushi, such
as traC and traGF[15,28,29,31]. Therefore, the Tra cluster
was mostly eliminated from the R. africae, and, following
a "use it or lose it" scheme, this species probably did not
need a tra gene-linked conjugation system. In addition,
the pRA plasmid did not contain genes encoding proteins
involved in conjugation.
Six transposase-encoding genes were identified in the
chromosome, including one split into two ORFs
(ORF0955/ORF0956) and one present as a remnant and
two in the pRA plasmid, including one present as a fragment. This contrasts with the large expansion of trans-

degraded genes than R. felis (86, P < 10-2).

Common rickettsial gene set and phylogeny
When compared to eight other available rickettsial
genomes, a total of 645 genes and 39 RNA-encoding
genes of R. africae had orthologs in all genomes. In addition, another 32 R. africae genes had orthologs only in
SFG rickettsiae and were either absent or remnant in TG
rickettsiae. Consequently, we identified 645 genes as constituting the core gene set of all available rickettsial
genomes and 700 ORFs as the core gene set of SFG rickettsiae. Following concatenation of the 645 core genes, a reliable phylogenetic organization (Figure 4) was obtained
using three analysis methods that was consistent with previous phylogenetic studies of Rickettsia species [4,32-36].

Transcription of genes conserved in R. africae but absent
from highly pathogenic species
R. africae had 18 intact genes that were either absent or
degraded in all three virulent species R. conorii, R. rickettsii
and R. prowazekii. Of these, 12 encoded proteins of
unknown functions (raf_ORF0036, raf_ORF0064,
raf_ORF0391,
raf_ORF0412,
raf_ORF0414,
raf_ORF0415,

raf_ORF0660,
raf_ORF0758,
raf_ORF0793,
raf_ORF0876,
and
raf_ORF0884) (Figure 5) [see Additional file 4]. The
remaining six genes encoded a plasmid maintenance system antidote protein (raf_ORF0424), the spoT15 gene

(Dam2)
(raf_ORF0659),

(raf_ORF0782), a putative integral membrane protein
(raf_ORF0973), and a protein (RIG1002) exhibiting a
high degree of amino acid sequence identity (>50%) with
proteins of -proteobacteria classified within the
COG3943 as putative virulence proteins. When investigating the transcription of these 18 genes in R. africae
grown at 28, 32 and 37°C, we observed a significantly
higher transcription level at 37°C than at lower temperatures for two genes, raf_ORF414 and raf_ORF660. The

In comparison with other Rickettsia genomes, R. africae
had 242, 238 and 69 fewer genes than R. bellii, R. felis and
R massiliae, respectively, but 279, 260, 52, 23, 17, and 15
more genes than R. typhi, R. prowazekii, R. akari, R. rickettsii, R. sibirica, and R. conorii, respectively. When comparing the numbers of degraded genes (split + remnants), R.
africae, with 127 degraded genes, had a significantly less
degraded genome (P < 10-2) than that of other spotted
fever group rickettsiae including R. akari (176), R. conorii
(196), R. massiliae (212), R. rickettsii (198) and R. sibirica

former gene contained a putative protease domain site,
but the latter had no known function.
The R. africae plasmid
The R. africae plasmid (Figure 2) is a new example of a
plasmid in Rickettsia species, following those in R. felis
[28], R. massiliae [29], R. monacensis [37], R. helvetica, R.
peacockii, R. amblyommii and R. hoogstraalii [38]. This plasmid, named pRA, is smaller (12,377 bp) than those of R.
felis (62,829 bp and 39,263 bp long, for pRF and pRF,
respectively), R. monacensis (23,486 bp), and R. massiliae
(15,286 bp). The pRA plasmid is predicted to contain 11
genes, 6 of which (54%) have homologs in public databases and are associated with functional attributes. These
six genes encode for a chromosomal replication initiator
DnaA-like protein (ORF1260), a site-specific recombinase
(ORF1262), two contiguous transposases exhibiting
100% sequence similarity (ORF1263 and 1264) but with
one (ORF1263) shorter than the other, the auto-transporter protein SCA12 (ORF1268), and a ParA-like plasmid stability protein (ORF1270). Five genes (ORFs 1260,
1263, 1264, 1269 and 1270) have orthologs in the R. massiliae plasmid, six have orthologs in the R. felis plasmids

(ORF1260, 1263, 1264, 1268, 1269 and 1270), and three
have orthologs in the R. monacensis plasmid (ORF1260,
ORF1268, and ORF1270). The presence of two genes
(ORF1260 and 1270) conserved in plasmids from four
species suggests that these plasmids have a common origin. The presence of two almost identical successive transposases in R. africae matching a single gene in R. massiliae
and R. felis suggests a duplication event in the former species. The pRA plasmid lacks heat shock protein-encoding
genes found in other rickettsial plasmids. In contrast,
ORF1262, a site-specific recombinase, is absent from
other species. Its closest phylogenetic neighbour is a sitespecific recombinase from Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, a high G-C content -proteobacterium living in
aquatic environments [39]. The sca12 gene (ORF) found
intact in R. africae pRA was absent from the R. massiliae
and R. monacensis plasmids and present but fragmented
within R. felis pRF, but it was absent from pRF as well all
other Rickettsia species.
As outlined by Baldridge et al. [38], the plasmid content of
a Rickettsia species may vary according to the passage history of rickettsial strains. When estimating the prevalence

of the plasmid among R. africae strains, we detected it in
the 22 tested isolates from South Africa and in the 48
eschar biopsies from patients with ATBF contracted in the
same country and in 20/32 R. africae-positive Amblyomma
ticks [see Additional files 5 and 6]. Therefore, it appears
from these results that, depending on the geographic location, the plasmid of R. africae may be unstable. Whether
the plasmid has been lost by PCR-negative strains or cannot be amplified with the primers we used is as yet
unknown. Such inter-strain differences in plasmid content were also observed in R. felis (Unpublished data).

ilar sets of conserved (sca0 – 2, 4 and 5), degraded (sca3,
8 – 10 and 13) and absent (sca6, 7, 11, 14 – 17) sca genes
as R. conorii and R. rickettsii. In addition to these 10 SCAencoding genes, R. africae exhibited a degraded sca9 gene
and a complete sca12 gene carried by the pRA plasmid,
only shared with R. felis, where it was also found partially
degraded on the pRF plasmid. The sca12 genes from both
species were grouped into a distinct cluster close to the
sca1, 2 and 6 genes [see Additional file 9]. This result further supports a common origin of the pRA and pRF plasmids.

Stress response
Rickettsiae live intracellularly in both arthropod and
mammal hosts. This implies that periods of tick starvation
and feeding cause bacterial dormancy and multiplication
following reactivation [40]. As a consequence, and despite
their obligate intracellular location, rickettsiae may face,
and thus have to adapt to, highly variable and extreme
environmental conditions. Known as the stringent
response, this bacterial adaptation to nutritional stress has
been described to be mediated by the accumulation of
guanosine nucleotides pppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate) and ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate
5'-diphosphate)
[41].
Accordingly,
the
transcriptional analysis of R. conorii exposed to a nutrient
deprivation was characterized by the up-regulation of gmk
and of genes from the spoT family, suggesting a role for
these nucleotides as effectors of the stringent response
[42,43]. The R. africae genome exhibited eight spoT genes
phylogenetically classified within two major clades [see
Additional file 7]. The largest clade included spoT genes
with hydrolase activity (1–10, 14, 15, 17–21), while the
second included those with a synthetase domain. With
eight genes, R. africae had more spoT genes than R. rickettsii
(5 genes), R. conorii (4), R. sibirica (4), R. akari (7), R.
canadensis (5), R. typhi (4) and R. prowazekii (1) but fewer
genes than R. felis (14) and R. bellii (10) [see Additional
file 8]. Altogether, our data suggest that R. africae is more
regulated than more pathogenic species.

A proteomic approach recently allowed the identification
of two paralogous proteins encoded by the genes RC1281RC1282 and RP827-RP828, as putative adhesins Adr1 and
Adr2. These proteins may be key actors for entry and infection in both R. conorii and R. prowazekii [11]. Both proteins are ubiquitously present within the Rickettsia genus
[4]. Their presence within the R. africae genome
(ORF1174 + ORF1175) [see Additional file 10] reinforces
their suspected key role in rickettsial life.

Infection of mammal hosts
The R. africae genome encoded rOmpA (or Sca0) and
rOmpB (or Sca5), two surface-exposed and immunodominant proteins belonging to the paralogous "surface cell
antigen" (SCA) family and known in Rickettsia species to
be responsible for antigenic differences between species
[1] and to elicit an immune response in patients [44].
Experimental studies suggested that these two auto-transporter proteins could function as adhesins [10,11,45,46].
In addition, another eight SCA-encoding genes were
found in the genome. These 10 genes were represented by
22 ORFs due to partial degradation of some of the paralogs [see Additional file 8]. Among the 17 SCA-encoding
genes detected in Rickettsia species [47], R. africae had sim-

Both pld and tlyC, encoding phospholipase D [8] and
hemolysin C [12], respectively, which play a role in
phagosomal escape [13,48], were conserved in the R. africae genome (ORF1161 and ORF1039, respectively). This
bacterium also exhibited genes encoding other proteins
with membranolytic activity, including tlyA (hemolysin
A) and pat1 (patatin-like phospholipase) [12,49]. As
expected, the genome of R. africae has a rickA gene
(ORF0824) orthologous to all rickettsial rickA genes and
coding a protein activating the Arp2/3 complex, whose
nucleation triggers actin polymerisation [50] [see Additional file 11]. The Rick A protein in R. africae is slightly
different from those of other species, with a phenylalanine instead of a serine within the G-actin-binding site,
an ENNIP [PS] motif repeated twice instead of four times
in the central proline-rich region of the protein [see Additional file 11], and an aspartate and an isoleucine instead
of an asparagine and an alanine or valine, respectively, in
the carboxy-terminal region. Despite these differences, the
RickA protein of R. africae appeared to be functional as
demonstrated by its ability to polymerize actin and multiply intranuclearly (Figure 6).
Sixteen vir gene paralogs were found in the R. africae
genome. Virulence genes of the vir family belong to the
type IV secretion machinery, a system that allows the
delivery of virulence factors from bacterial and eukaryotic
host membranes to the cytoplasm of the host cell [51]. All
16 genes were found to be intact and common to all Rickettsia genomes with the exception of virB6-2 in R. africae
and virB6-5 in R. massiliae [see Additional file 8]. In both
species, these genes were split into two ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of the virB6-2 gene distinguished clearly the

SFG and TG and showed that the R. africae VirB6-2 protein
is phylogenetically closer to that of R. sibirica [see Additional file 12].
Clonality of R. africae
Of the 155 Amblyomma ticks tested, 139 (89.6%) were
PCR-positive for R. africae [see Additional file 5]. Therefore, infection rates of Amblyomma ticks with R. africae
may be higher than previously described [21,22,52],
which suggests an extreme fitness of this rickettsia for its
vector. In addition, such infection rates are the highest
among Rickettsia species [see Additional file 13].

Using MST, PCR products of the expected sizes were
obtained from the dksA-xerC, mppA-purC and rpmEtRNAfMet intergenic spacers from all tested specimens.
Sequences obtained from these amplicons were in all
cases identical to those previously obtained for R. africae
[GenBank: DQ008280], [GenBank: DQ008301], and
[GenBank: DQ008246], for the dksA-xerC, mppA-purC and
rpmE-tRNAfMet spacers, respectively). This is the first rickettsia demonstrated to be clonal. Other tested Rickettsia
species, including R. conorii (31 MST genotypes out of 39
strains tested [53]), R. massiliae (2/7 [24]), R. sibirica (3/3
[24]), and R. felis (3/6 [24]), were significantly more
genetically variable than R. africae (p < 10-2 in all cases).

Discussion
Using a comparative study of rickettsial genomes, we
found that virulence in Rickettsia species is not correlated
with acquisition of foreign DNA but may rather result
from a reduction in regulation due to genome decay
[6,23]. Comparative genomics sheds light on a much
wider spectrum of virulence acquisition mechanisms in
bacteria than initially thought [54]. Based on the examples of enterobacteria and staphylococci, gain in pathogenicity in bacteria was mainly thought to result from
horizontal gene transfer, either directly or through mobile
genetic elements [55,56]. However, a recent study of Rickettsia species associated with arthropods, insects, leeches
and protists clearly demonstrated that horizontal gene
transfer was a rare event within this genus [5]. In addition,
genomic studies demonstrated that rickettsiae are undergoing genome decay, affecting in priority horizontallyacquired genes [57], and that there is no association
between pathogenicity and acquisition of virulence markers [6]. In fact, the genome of the most virulent species, R.
prowazekii [58], is a subset of the less pathogenic species R.
conorii [23], thus highlighting a paradoxical relationship
between smaller genome size and higher pathogenicity.
Careful comparison of the R. prowazekii and R. typhi
genomes also demonstrated that the former species, more
pathogenic than the latter, had a more decayed genome
despite a 12-kb insertion that likely resulted from a single
genetic event [59].

When investigating the genomic characteristics associated
with the milder virulence of R. africae, we first ruled out a
potential role of the plasmid by the fact that it is unstable
in this species. Then, we compared the gene contents of R.
africae with R. conorii, R. rickettsii, and R. prowazekii, which
exhibit a higher pathogenicity in humans and their
arthropod hosts. We observed that R. africae showed no
gene loss but had 18 genes fully conserved that were either
absent or degraded in the other species (Figure 5). We
speculated that, because R. africae had more intact genes
than more virulent species, some of these genes may be
involved in maintaining a low virulence level. Such a
behavior may not be unique to rickettsiae. It was found
that gene knockout resulted in increased virulence in Mycoplasma, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Vibrio cholerae [60-62].
In M. ulcerans, genome reduction was also linked to gain
in virulence [63]. It emerges as a concept that virulence
may be increased by gene loss [54]. We assume that a similar phenomenon may happen in rickettsiae, and that
inactivation of some genes may deregulate the control of
bacterial multiplication, in particular during the reactivation phenomenon following warming, thus enhancing
pathogenesis.
Among the 18 putative candidate genes unique to R. africae, we identified only two genes (raf_ORF414 and
raf_ORF660) that were significantly more transcribed at
37°C than at lower temperatures. Of these, one
(raf_ORF414) encoded a protein that had a putative protease domain. A protease was previously shown in Vibrio
cholerae to be a virulence repressor [60]. However,
whether this differentially-transcribed protease plays a
role in virulence repression in R. africae is as yet unknown.
In contrast, the spoT15 gene (raf_ORF652) unique to R.
africae was not upregulated, and this species retained
another two spoT pseudogenes (raf_ORF653–654 and
raf_ORF655–656) that were completely lost by other species. SpoT genes, effectors of the stringent response, were
shown to play a major role in adaptation to stress in R.
conorii, in particular when subjected to abrupt temperature variations similar to those occurring during a tick
blood meal [42]. R. africae, however, has more spoT genes
than R. conorii or R. rickettsii and does not show any modification of expression of its specific spoT15 gene during
temperature variations. We speculate that higher regulation ability in R. africae is linked to lower pathogenicity.
In addition, when compared to other tick-borne Rickettsia
species, R. africae exhibited several unique characteristics.
First, this species is extremely successful and fit: it is highly
adapted and harmless to its tick host, being efficiently
transmitted both transtadially and transovarially in
Amblyomma sp. ticks, which consequently act as efficient
reservoirs [64]. In contrast, R. rickettsii [65,66] and R.
conorii [67] have a negative effect on their tick vectors in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/166

experimental models. As a result, the prevalence of R. africae in its host ticks is higher than that of most other rickettsiae. Similarly, R. africae is less pathogenic for humans
than other SFG species such as R. conorii and R. rickettsii,
in particular because the infection is never lethal [17].
This observation was later supported by the demonstration that inoculation eschars in ATBF were histologically
different from those in MSF [68]. In particular, in contrast
with other SFG rickettsioses where eschars are characterized by perivascular infiltration of T cells and macrophages, with some B lymphocytes and few
polymorphonuclears, the vasculitis in ATBF is made of a
large infiltrate of neutrophils causing an extensive cutaneous inflammation and necrosis [see Additional file 14]
[68]. Such a local reaction, in addition to the few R. africae
cells detected in eschars [68], suggests that the bacterium
replicated poorly in human tissues. Second, R. africae has
significantly fewer degraded genes than other SFG species
(p < 10-2), except R. felis. Specifically, this characteristic
suggests that R. africae is undergoing a slower degradation
process than other rickettsiae. Third, the identification of
a single MST genotype among 102 strains suggested that
R. africae was clonal [24,69]. This contrasted with the variable plasmid content of this species. Originally thought
to be absent in Rickettsia species, plasmids have been
detected in eight species to date [28,29,37,38], and their
plasmid content may exhibit intraspecies variability. In R.
felis, two plasmid forms have been sequenced [28], and
Baldridge et al. found two plasmids in both R. peacockii
and R. amblyommii [38]. In addition, these authors
showed that R. peacockii lost its plasmids during long-term
serial passages in cell culture [38]. In R. africae, the pRA
plasmid may also be unstable, as shown by the absence of
plasmid detection in 12/32 Amblyomma ticks tested. This
plasmid encodes 11 ORFs, two of which are common to
R. felis, R. massiliae and R. monacensis plasmids [see Additional file 1], which strongly suggests a common source
for these mobile elements. We suspect that rickettsial plasmids and Tra clusters are vertically inherited but are
apparently unstable and are currently degrading.

Conclusion
Based on its genome and lifestyle, we suspect that the
clonal R. africae is more regulated and more specifically
adapted to its host and warm environment than other
tick-associated rickettsiae. We speculate that losing this
regulation, as observed in several intracellular pathogens,
is a critical cause of virulence [6]. Further transcriptomic
analysis of R. africae and other Rickettsia species grown at
various temperatures is currently ongoing to identify putative other candidate genes involved in stress response.

Methods
Genome Sequencing
Bacterial purification and DNA extraction
In this study, we used R. africae ESF-5 strain, CSUR R15
(Collection de souches de l'Unité des Rickettsies, Marseille, France), which was isolated in an Amblyomma variegatum tick collected from cattle in the Shulu province of
Ethiopia in 1966 [27]. R. africae was cultivated in Vero
cells growing in MEM with 4% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 5 mM L-glutamine. Bacterial purification,
DNA extraction and pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis were
performed as described in Additional file 15 [see Additional file 15].
Shotgun sequencing of R. africae genome
Three shotgun genomic libraries were made by mechanical shearing of the DNA using a Hydroshear device (GeneMachine, San Carlos, CA, USA). Sequence blunt ends, to
which the BstXI adaptator was linked, were obtained
using the T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs).
Fragments of 3, 5, and 10 kb were separated on a preparative agarose gel (FMC, Rockland, ME, USA), extracted
using the Qiaquick kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and
ligated into a high copy-number vector pCDNA2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for the two smaller inserts and
into the low copy-number vector pCNS [28] for the largest
inserts. Further details are available in Additional file 15
[see Additional file 15].
Annotation
We predicted protein-coding genes (ORFs) using SelfID as
previously described [15]. Functional assignments for the
ORFs were based on database searches using BLAST [70]
against UniProt [71], NCBI/CDD [72], and SMART [73]
databases. In most cases, we applied an E-value threshold
of 0.001 for the database searches to retrieve homologues.
Detailed analyses using multiple sequence alignments
and phylogenetic reconstructions were carried out to
assign putative functions to the ORFs, when needed.
Orthologous gene relationships between R. africae and
other Rickettsia species were approximated using the best
reciprocal BLAST match criterion. The numbers of transposases, ankyrin/tetratricopeptide repeat-containing
genes, and integrases were computed using RPS-BLAST
with NCBI/CDD entries related to those domains with a
10-5 E-value threshold. tRNA genes were identified using
tRNAscan-SE [74]. To identify Rickettsia palindromic elements, we used hidden Markov models [75] based on the
previously identified Rickettsia palindromic element
sequences. ClustalW [76], T-coffee [77], and MUSCLE
[78] were used to construct multiple sequence alignments. Toxin-antitoxin genes were identified using the
Rasta-Bacteria software http://genoweb.univ-rennes1.fr/
duals/RASTA-Bacteria.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/166

Phylogenetic analysis
We based our analysis on the 645 complete orthologous
genes found by Blast programmes in all Rickettsia
genomes [70]. Subsequently, the amino acid sequences of
these 645 proteins were concatenated for each genome
and multiple alignment was performed using the Mafft
software [79]. Gapped positions were removed. The maximum parsimony and neighbor joining trees were constructed using the MEGA 3.1 software [80].
Clonal origin of R. africae
We examined R. africae within 155 Amblyomma sp. ticks
and eggs from various geographical origins [see Additional file 5]. These included 80 adults (40 male and 40
female), 40 larvae, 15 nymphs and 20 eggs. PCR amplification of the traD gene was performed using the R. africaespecific primer pair traD-F (5'-caatgcttgatctatttggtag-3')
and traD-R (5'-cttccttttctctaagctatgc-3') and the probe
traD-probe (5'-FAM-ttatggtgctaactccatgcgtgatg-TAMRA3'). The presence of the plasmid was estimated using the
primer pair 1267F (5'-ccagccattaccgtaatcac-3') and 1267R
(5'-tagtgccttatactcaagttc-3') and the probe 1267-probe (5'FAM-gcagaaagtgattaaggcgatcagctg-TAMRA-3') that is able
to detect ORF 1267 encoding a protein of unknown function specific to the plasmid. The presence of the plasmid
was examined in 22 strains obtained from patients who
contracted the disease in South Africa and maintained in
the CSUR [see Additional file 6], in PCR-positive eschar
biopsies from another 48 patients who developed ATBF
following a trip to South Africa, and in 32 Amblyomma sp.
ticks found positive for R. africae, using the abovedescribed PCR assay [see Additional file 5]. To evaluate
the genetic diversity of R. africae, we used the multi-spacer
typing (MST) method as previously described [53]. This
method has been described as the most discriminatory
genotyping tool at the intraspecies level in Rickettsia sp.
[53]. We applied this method to the aforementioned 22
human R. africae strains, 48 eschar biopsies, and 32
Amblyomma sp. ticks from Sudan (3), Madagascar (3),
Mali (3), Niger (6), Central African Republic (6), Ivory
Coast (3), Guadeloupe (4), Martinique (2), and St Kitts
and Nevis (2) [see Additional file 5]. The obtained
sequences were compared to those available in GenBank,
and the MST genotypes were determined as previously
described [53].
Transcription of genes conserved in R. africae but absent
from highly pathogenic species
To evaluate the transcription of the 18 genes conserved by
R. africae and degraded in highly pathogenic species, we
designed specific primer pairs and probes for each gene
and tested the transcription of these genes by RT-PCR on
RNA extracted from R. africae- infected Vero cells cultivated at 32 and then at 37°C and in XTC cells at 28 and
