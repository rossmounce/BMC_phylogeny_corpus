Abstract
Background: The vertebrate opsins are proteins which utilise a retinaldehyde chromophore in
their photosensory or photoisomerase roles in the visual/irradiance detection cycle. The majority
of the opsins, such as rod and cone opsins, have a very highly conserved gene structure suggesting
a common lineage. Exceptions to this are RGR-opsin and melanopsin, whose genes have very
different intron insertion positions. The gene structure of another opsin, peropsin (retinal pigment
epithelium-derived rhodopsin homologue, RRH) is unknown.
Results: By in silico analysis of the GenBank database we have determined that the human RRH
comprises 7 exons spanning approximately 16.5 kb and is localised to chromosome 4q25 in the
following gene sequence: cen-EGF-RRH-IF-qter – a position that excludes this gene as a candidate
for the RP29 autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa locus. A comparison of opsin gene structures
reveals that RRH and RGR share two common intron (introns 1 and 4) insertion positions which
may reflect a shared ancestral gene.
Conclusion: The opsins comprise a diverse group of genes which appear to have arisen from
three different lineages. These lineages comprise the "classical opsin superfamily" which includes
the rod and cone opsins, pinopsin, VA-opsin, parapinopsin and encephalopsin; the RRH and RGR
group; and the melanopsin line. A common lineage for RRH and RGR, together with their sites of
expression in the RPE, indicates that peropsin may act as a retinal isomerase.

Background
The photosensory opsins are a family of membrane
bound, heptahelical G-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs) characterised by their ability to covalently bind
a vitamin A-based retinaldehyde chromophore via a Schiff
base to a lysine residue located in the 7th transmembrane
α-helix [1,2]. In the natural environment, the vertebrate
vitamin A based chromophore takes the form of either 11cis-retinal (A1) or 11-cis-3,4-didehydroretinal (A2) [3]. In

the vertebrate retina, the primary events in image detection occur in the outer segments of rod and cone cells,
with the opsins located in these lamellar stacks being
named after these cell types – rod-opsin in rods and coneopsins in cones. Absorption of a photon of light by the
chromophore located in the retinal binding pocket of an
opsin causes its photoisomerisation from the 11-cis to an
all-trans conformation. This change of the chromophore
induces a conformational change of its surrounding opsin

molecule allowing transducin (G-protein) binding and
activation of the phototransduction cascade [1,2]. The
vertebrate retina generally contains a single rod opsin
class and as many as four different cone opsins [4],
though the majority of mammals are dichromats being in
possession of only two types of cone opsin. In the nonmammals, non-rod, non-cone photosensory opsins have
been described. For example, pinopsin (P-opsin) was isolated from the avian pineal [5] and vertebrate ancient
opsin (VA-opsin) was isolated from the teleost inner retina and pineal/deep brain structures [6]. Other opsins
have also been described from a variety of vertebrate classes which either act as a photoisomerase, e.g. RGR-opsin
[7]; or have an unknown function, e.g. peropsin [8], parapinopsin [9] and encephalopsin [10]; or are expressed in
photoreceptive cells but have as yet an unknown function,
e.g. melanopsin [11]. The one key feature present in all the
opsin classes is the presence of a lysine residue in the 7th
transmembrane α-helix which is thought to enable retinal
attachment in all cases [12].
The first complete vertebrate opsin sequence (bovine rod
opsin) was described in 1983 [13], and this opsin has
since become the numeration template for critical residues that are conserved throughout all of the opsins. The
genomic structure of bovine rod opsin consists of five exons separated by four introns [13], a structure that has
been conserved in all vertebrate rod-opsins including
those of the ancient Agnatha [14], with the single exception of the rod opsin in teleost fish which is intronless
[15]. Employing the nomenclature proposed by Hunt et
al. [16] which correlates the spectral sensitivity (λmax)
with amino acid sequence identity, the first cone-opsin sequences isolated were those of the human blue (ultraviolet/violet sensitive, UVS/VS) (OPN1SW), green and red
cone opsins (both longwave sensitive, LWS) (OPN1MW,
OPN1LW) [17]. The UVS/VS opsin gene shares the same
genomic structure as the rod-opsin gene in that is possesses four conserved intron insertion positions. The LWS
opsin also shares the four conserved introns with the rodand UVS/VS cone-opsin, but has an additional fifth intron
in a 5' prime position to the four conserved introns [17],
which we have termed intron 0 (zero) [12]. Sequences
from the remaining two visual opsin classes of the vertebrates, shortwave sensitive (SWS) and middlewave sensitive (MWS), have been isolated and share the same
genomic structure as the rod and UVS/VS cone opsins
[18]. Interestingly, the SWS and MWS opsin families
found in birds, fish, reptiles and amphibia are absent in
the mammalian lineage – a feature thought to be related
to the "nocturnal bottleneck" occupied by mammals during their evolution resulting in the loss of these two cone
classes [19,20].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/3

Many of the more recently described non-rod, non-cone
opsins also share a relatively high degree of intron position conservation with the visual opsins, only differing in
the position of intron 2 as in pinopsin where it is shifted
14 nucleotides in a 3' direction [21] and VA-opsin where
it is shifted 42 nucleotides in a 3' direction [22], or its absence as in parapinopsin [9] and encephalopsin (OPN3)
[23]. However, RGR-opsin (retinal G-protein coupled receptor, RGR) [24] and melanopsin (OPN4) [25] do not
share intron insertion positions with any other opsins for
which a gene structure is known, whilst the gene structure
of peropsin is presently unknown.
Little is known about peropsin (retinal pigment epithelium-derived rhodopsin homologue, RRH) except that it
shares ~26% amino acid identity with the photosensory
opsins, is uniquely expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and by synteny with mouse will map to
human chromosome 4q [8]. To address this issue, we
have determined by in silico database searches that the human peropsin gene (RRH) has seven exons and maps to
chromosome 4q25. A comparison with the gene structures of other opsins indicates that RRH and RGR share
two intron insertion sites. These findings and their phylogenetic relationships are discussed within the context of
the possible function of peropsin. In view of the variety of
nomenclature systems that are applied to the various
opsin classes [2,12], we have attempted to be as consistent
as possible with nomenclature and have deferred to preferred locus symbols accepted by the Gene Nomenclature
Committee of The Human Genome Organisation, HUGO
– http://www.hugo-international.org/hugo/ and Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM – http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/. Thus, RRH and peropsin should
be considered synonymous.

Results and Discussion
Structure of the RRH gene
We have used the 1374 base pairs (bp) of the RRH (peropsin) cDNA sequence (GenBank: AF012270) that has
been previously described [8] to conduct an online BLAST
search of the GenBank nr database. The RRH cDNA
matched 7 non-contiguous regions in the Plus/Plus strand
orientation of the 118642 bp human BAC clone RP11602N24 (GenBank: AC126283) at a level of 99–100%
identity with highly significant Expect-values (E-value) –
the closer the value to "0" the more "significant" the
match [26]. Subsequently, a BLAST 2 Sequences comparison of RP11-602N24 with the RRH cDNA indicated that
the RRH cDNA is contained within 7 putative exons. Using these putative exons as a model, a sequence alignment
was produced such that each intron concurred with the
GT/AG intron donor/acceptor site rule [27] (Figure 1).
Exon 1 contains the bases 17–156 of the RRH cDNA,
which are equivalent to 34 bp of 5' untranslated region

(UTR) and the initial 106 bp of coding sequence. We were
unable to align the first 16 bp of the RRH cDNA to RP11602N24 and have concluded that these 16 bp are a cDNA
cloning artifact since the breakdown of sequence similarity does not occur at an apparent intron acceptor site in
the genomic sequence. Exons 2–6 contain the next 793 bp
of coding sequence, whilst exon 7 contains the final 115
bp of coding sequence and the 3'UTR. No nucleotide substitutions were observed between the published coding sequence and that derived from RP11-602N24, but three
separate nucleotide substitutions were observed in the
3'UTR. The entire exon/intron structure encompasses approximately 16.5 kilo base pairs (kb) and has been ascribed GenBank accession number BK000958.
Chromosomal localisation of RRH
In order to map RRH, we subjected the sequence of RP11602N24 to a BLAST search and found that it contains the
I factor (complement) gene, IF, which has been shown to
map to 4q25 [28]. Localisation of RP11-602N24 and
hence RRH to 4q25 is consistent with the syntenic prediction from the mapping data for mouse Rrh [8]. To further
refine the localisation of RRH, a BLAST search using a terminal 2 kb of sequence (bases 116643–118642) of RP11602N24 identified BAC clone B200N5 which maps to
4q25 and contains approximately 143 kb of sequence
(GenBank: AC005509). A BLAST search using B200N5 indicated that this clone contains the epidermal growth factor gene, EGF, which is also known to map to 4q25 in the
order cen-EGF-IF-qter [28]. We assembled a mini-contig
consisting of approximately 260 kb of sequence from
clones RP11-602N24 and B200N5 and have been able to
determine the following gene order: cen-EGF~85

kb~RRH~26 kb~IF-qter, and their directions of transcription (Figure 2). Localisation of RRH to an interval of approximately 110 kb between EGF and IF on chromosome
4q25 excludes this gene as a causative candidate for the
autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa locus (RP29) located on 4q32-q34 [29].
Comparison of opsin gene structures
To determine whether any of the intron insertion sites in
RRH are conserved with those of other opsins, nucleotide
sequences of representatives of the various opsin classes
were aligned and intron positions marked (Figure 3). RRH
shares two common intron insertion sites (1 and 4) with
RGR, whilst the other four intron insertion sites appear
novel amongst the opsin families represented. RRH and
RGR share two further introns that are present in relatively
close proximity. Intron 3 of RRH is located 9 bp in a 3' direction of intron 3 in RGR (both introns being in phase
+1), whilst intron 5 in RRH is located 3 bp (1 codon) in a
3' direction of the corresponding intron in RGR (both introns being in phase 0). Between RRH and members of
the other opsin families only two intron positions are in
relatively close proximity – intron 6 in RRH is located 1 bp
5' of intron 4 in the rod and cone opsins, and intron 2 of
RRH (phase 0) is 8 bp 3' of intron 3 (phase +1) of OPN4.

From the perspective of intron positions, it would appear
that the opsins have arisen from three ancestral genes (Figure 4). Considering the clade (81% bootstrap confidence)
which includes the visual opsins (rod and cones), brain
(pinopsin, VA-opsin, parapinopsin) and encephalopsin,
it can be seen that three intron positions (introns 1, 3 and
4) are perfectly conserved throughout (Figures 3 and 4).

The direction of transcription and location of translation initiation codons (atg) of the various genes are also indicated in bp.

This would suggest that the ancestral opsin gene giving
rise to this clade had introns present at these three positions. Subsequent gene duplication events have given rise
to opsin classes that either do not possess intron 2, or possess intron 2 in at least one of three positions (position 2,
2a or 2b), whilst the LWS cone opsin group has accumulated a further intron (0) in the visual opsin lineage (Figure 4). Given the organisation of the lamprey (Agnatha)
rod opsin gene [14] and pinopsin gene [30] (which has an
intron arrangement of the VA-opsin family rather than
that of the pinopsin family [22]), these highly conserved
gene structures have been in existence for at least 550 million years. Further support for an ancestral chordate opsin
gene with these three conserved introns is provided by an
opsin from the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. This urochordate possesses Ci-opsin1 whose gene has seven introns,
three of which are in positions conserved with those in
vertebrate visual opsins [31], corresponding to positions
1, 3 and 4 [12]. Given their common lineage, we have
chosen to term this collection of opsins the "classical
opsin superfamily".

brane domains compared with ≥ 40% identity exhibited
between the majority of the classical opsin superfamily
[12]. An exception being encephalopsin which shares
~30% identity with other members of the classical opsin
superfamily [12], but clearly has a highly conserved gene
structure. The phenomenon of intron sliding or slippage
[32], which has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to the slight variations in position of some introns observed between some insect opsins [33], may explain the
1 bp shift between intron 6 of RRH and intron 4 of the
classical opsin superfamily, but their proximity may also
be due to chance. Whilst single nucleotide intron slippage
is an evolutionary phenomenon thought to occur in <5%
of introns [34], these two opsin groups do not appear to
have a recent common ancestor which probably indicates
a random insertion of introns. Similarly, the close proximity of introns 2 and 3 of RRH with introns 3 of OPN4
and RGR respectively are likely also to be chance occurrences given that intron insertion and deletion events are
much more common than intron sliding events
[32,35,36].

RRH and RGR form a separate clade (87% bootstrap confidence) and share two conserved intron positions with
each other, 1 and 4, but none with classical opsin superfamily or melanopsin (Figures 3 and 4). This may be indicative that RRH and RGR derive from the same ancestral
gene which possessed introns at positions equivalent to
positions 1 and 4 in RRH and RGR, even though they only
share ~25% amino acid identity across the transmem-

OPN4 (melanopsin) shares no conserved intron positions
with any of the other opsin classes, and it has been proposed that this opsin class represents a separate line of
opsin evolution [12,37]. Collectively the data suggest that
three separate lines of evolution have occurred to form the
present day vertebrate opsins represented by the structurally highly conserved classical opsin superfamily, the

intron positions 1–4 are common to all rod (RHO) and cone opsins, whilst intron 0 is only found in the LWS opsins (OPN1MW,

(OPN4) [25] are indicated by yellow filled circles. Only intron insertion sites 1–7 for melanopsin are indicated due to the
extreme length of the melanopsin C-terminus which makes positioning of introns 8 and 9 inaccurate since there is no overlap

more relaxed RRH and RGR grouping, and OPN4 which
stands as the single member of the melanopsin class to
date.
An ancestral link between RRH and RGR may provide an
insight at to the potential function of peropsin. RGRopsin is known to act as a photoisomerase in the reconversion of retinal chromophore from the all-trans to the 11cis conformation [38,39], and perhaps peropsin also functions as an isomerase in some manner given its localisation in the RPE. This suggestion is supported by recent
findings that indicate that an amphioxus (Branchiostoma
belcheri) homologue of peropsin acts as an all-trans to 11cis photoisomerase [40]. Alternatively, peropsin may act
as a thermal isomerase since Rgr-/- mice are able to convert
all-trans-retinal to the 11-cis conformation under dark adaptation [7]. It has been suggested that peropsin may also
bind a different retinal isomer, or indeed a non-retinoid
ligand [8]. We have recently shown that the non-rod, noncone opsins such as RGR-opsin, peropsin, melanopsin
and encephalopsin are all expressed early in the embryonic development of the mammalian eye. These opsins are
expressed by E11.5 in mice and by 8.6 weeks in humans
[41], a finding which in all cases predates the expression
of the visual rod and cone opsins [42]. This early expression pattern may be supportive of a role in retinoid metabolism for these opsins in the developing retina [43], or
that these opsins have a role in the embryonic eye that are
quite different to those in the adult eye.

Conclusions
Using GenBank database searches we have been able to
determine that the human peropsin gene, RRH, comprises
seven exons spanning about 16.5 kb. By assembling sequences from large genomic clones we have determined
that RRH localises within an interval of approximately
110 kb between EGF and IF on chromosome 4q25. Of the
six introns present in RRH, two are located in positions
conserved with introns 1 and 4 of RGR, which given the
phylogenetic relationship of RRH and RGR may suggest
that these two opsins have arisen from a common ancestor, and by inference possess a common function e.g. acting as a retinal chromophore (photo)isomerase. Our data
also strengthens the argument that the present day opsins
are represented by genes that have arisen from three different ancestral genes that have given rise to (1), a classical
opsin superfamily cosisting of visual opsins and those
opsins who share a highly conserved gene structure with
the visual opsins; (2), a peropsin and RGR-opsin family;
(3), a melanopsin family.

. Searches were carried out using the standard nucleotidenucleotide BLAST (blastn) option against the "nr database" using default values with the low complexity filter
off. Subsequent sequence manipulations utilised the online BLAST 2 Sequences [44] server – http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bl2.html and MacVector 7.0
(Accelrys Ltd., Cambridge, UK).
Phylogenetic Analysis
Nucleotide coding sequences of: (i) human rod opsin,
RHO (U49742); (ii) human red cone (LWS) opsin,
OPN1LW (AH005298); (iii) human blue cone (UVS/VS)
opsin, OPN1SW (U53874); (iv) chicken green cone
(MWS) opsin (M92038); (v) chicken blue cone (SWS)
opsin (M92037); (vi) chicken pinopsin (U15762); (vii)
carp VA-opsin (AF233520); (viii) catfish parapinopsin
(AF028014); (ix) human encephalopsin, OPN3
(AF140242); (x) human peropsin, RRH (AF012270); (xi)
human RGR-opsin, RGR (U14910); (xii) human melanopsin, OPN4 (AF147788), were entered in to DAMBE version 4.1.15 [45] – http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~xxia/software/
software.htm, and converted to amino acid sequences
which were then aligned using the ClustalW [46] option.
In order to maintain codon integrity the nucleotide sequences were then aligned to the amino acid alignment.
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA version 2.1 [47] – http://www.megasoftware.net. A maximum parsimony tree with branch confidence values
based on 500 bootstrap replicates was constructed and the
tree drawn in TreeViewPPC version 1.6.6 – http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html. Branches with
less than 40% support were collapsed.
