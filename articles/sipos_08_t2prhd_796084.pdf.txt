Abstract
Background: The models developed to characterize the evolution of multigene families (such as
the birth-and-death and the concerted models) have also been applied on the level of sequence
repeats inside a gene/protein. Phylogenetic reconstruction is the method of choice to study the
evolution of gene families and also sequence repeats in the light of these models. The
characterization of the gene family evolution in view of the evolutionary models is done by the
evaluation of the clustering of the sequences with the originating loci in mind. As the locus
represents positional information, it is straightforward that in the case of the repeats the exact
position in the sequence should be used, as the simple numbering according to repeat order can
be misleading.
Results: We have developed a novel rapid visual approach to study repeat evolution, that takes
into account the exact repeat position in a sequence. The "pairwise repeat homology diagram"
visualizes sequence repeats detected by a profile HMM in a pair of sequences and highlights their
homology relations inferred by a phylogenetic tree. The method is implemented in a Perl script
(t2prhd) available for downloading at http://t2prhd.sourceforge.net and is also accessible as an
online tool at http://t2prhd.brc.hu. The power of the method is demonstrated on the EGF-like and
fibronectin-III-like (Fn-III) domain repeats of three selected mammalian Tenascin sequences.
Conclusion: Although pairwise repeat homology diagrams do not carry all the information
provided by the phylogenetic tree, they allow a rapid and intuitive assessment of repeat evolution.
We believe, that t2prhd is a helpful tool with which to study the pattern of repeat evolution. This
method can be particularly useful in cases of large datasets (such as large gene families), as the
command line interface makes it possible to automate the generation of pairwise repeat homology
diagrams with the aid of scripts.

Background
The conceptual models developed to explain the evolution of multigene families [1,2] have also been applied to
sequence repeats inside a gene/protein. Studies of repeat
evolution [3-9] have often revealed complex patterns:

some repeats may evolve in concert, subject to homogenization, while other repeats may maintain their sequence
identity, which is more consistent with birth-and-death
and/or divergent evolution. Phylogenetic reconstruction
is an established approach with which to study the mode

of evolution of multigene families [10-14] and repeats [39]. In the analysis of closely related species, the association of genes on the same locus (orthologues) on phylogenetic trees suggests independent evolution of the
respective members, as expected for the birth-and-death
model. On the contrary, the association of paralogues
from the same species suggests homogenization, which is
consistent with the concerted model. The application of
the same logic to repeats poses a number of problems.
Studies on the evolution of multigene families by phylogenetic methods make use of a prior concept of homology
defined by the locus. As the term "locus" denotes genomic
position, it follows that the exact repeat position in the
full sequence (starting and ending positions) should be
used to identify them. This approach has seldom been
used in the previous studies, probably because it complicates the interpretation of the phylogenetic trees. Instead,
a simple numbering according to repeat order is often
applied, although this can be misleading: if a repeat is not
detected by the selected method (for example the profile
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method) in one of the
compared sequences, the ordinal numbers of the following repeats will be shifted by one and hence the analysis
will become laborious.

Results and Discussion
To simplify the analyses of repeat evolution, a novel rapid
visual method has been developed to highlight the relationships of repeats detected in a pair of sequences by the
profile HMM method. The primary aim of the application
is the analysis of tandem amino acid sequence repeats but
DNA sequences can also be used with a profile HMM
trained with DNA sequences. When DNA sequences are
used, the script does not consider the reverse complement
of the sequences, so the usefulness of this application in a
genomic context (for example in the case of transportable
elements) might be limited, though the implementation
can be easily extended to handle this kind of analysis.
The "pairwise repeat homology diagram" visualizes
repeats in a simple scheme, together with their homology
relations (orthology and paralogy) inferred by a phylogenetic tree, providing an intuitive way to analyse the patterns of repeat evolution. This visualization also facilitates
a survey of the sequence structure (size, linker sequences
and non-repetitive regions). Regions in which consecutive
repeats are connected with those in the other sequence
forming a ladder-like pattern are most likely to have
evolved independently following the birth-and-death
and/or divergent process. On the contrary, in regions
where repeats have only internal or no identified connections, repeats possibly evolve in concert. The patterns
demonstrated by internal connections can reveal units of
concerted evolution or recent internal duplications. It
should be taken into account, however, that if there are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/27

clades formed by more than two identical sequences, the
branching pattern of such clades, and hence the identified
relation, is arbitrary and uninformative in this kind of
analysis.
Implementation
The method is implemented in a Perl script with command line interface (t2prhd, standing for "tree to pairwise
repeat homology diagram"). The repeats are first identified with hmmsearch from the HMMER package [15] and a
profile HMM specified by the user. Raw search results are
parsed by using BioPerl [16] modules and the extracted
repeats are aligned with hmmalign. The resulting alignment is converted into Fasta and sequencial PHYLIP formats and a phylogenetic tree is built by using CLUSTAL W
[17] (with default parameters) or by using PhyML [18].
The script reads in the resulting tree as a Bio::Tree::TreeI
object. After getting the list of all leaf nodes it finds the
"sister leaf nodes" (leaf node pairs having the same ancestor) by an algorithm that for n leaf nodes (repeats) needs

in the best case n and in the worst case n iterations. So,
2

the asymptotic upper bound for the time complexity of
this algorithm is O(n) and the asymptotic lower bound is
Ω( n ). These sister leaf nodes have a most recent common
2

ancestor as indicated by the tree and accordingly we
regard them as unambiguously identified homologues.
The script creates an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file
containing the diagram by using the XML::Writer module
and saves the outputs and logs produced by the external
applications. Optionally, it can also generate a LaTeX output. The identified homology relations are represented by
lines or arcs connecting the respective repeats: blue lines
are drawn between repeats from different sequences
(orthology), and brown arcs in cases of internal relations
(paralogy). The colour intensity of the connecting lines is
a function of the patristic distance between the respective
leaf nodes (d) divided by the total tree length (T):
d
(1 − T )

w

. The default value of the "colour gradient

parameter" w is 1 (linear colour scale), but by setting this
parameter the colour scale can be tuned so that one can
discriminate between close distance values. To make the
interpretation of the colour scale easier a legend is drawn.
The generated SVG file can be viewed by Firefox 1.5 [19] or
higher as an example and can be rasterized (and also
viewed) using the Batik toolkit [20] or any other image
editor capable to handle the SVG format. The generated

LaTeX file should be processed by pdflatex, the pgf/TikZ,
fancyhdr, xcolor and fullpage packages are required. The
script has a manual page embedded in POD format.
The script is also accessible as an online tool [21] (with
CLUSTAL W back-end only) through a web interface created by using the Pise form generator [22]. The real power
of this visual method is manifested in studies with large
data sets, where the analysis of numerous or large trees
would be highly laborious. In these cases, it is very advantageous that the command line interface enables the use
of the scripts to automate the diagram generation.
Example
Tenascins are extracellular matrix glycoproteins containing regions of repeated EGF-like and fibronectin-III-like
(Fn-III) domains. The evolution of these repeated
domains in mammalian Tenascins has been studied in
detail by means of phylogenetic and other methods [8].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/27

To illustrate the power of the method, we generated pairwise repeat homology diagrams with three selected protein sequences. The protein sequences corresponding to
the DNA sequences studied by Hughes [8] were used
(abbreviations and GenBank accession numbers in parentheses): human Tenascin X (TXH, [GenBank:
AAB47488.1]), human Tenascin C (TCH, [GenBank:
CAA39628.1]) and murine Tenascin X (TXM, [GenBank:
AAB82015.1]). The profile HMM files were downloaded
from Pfam (EGF-like: PF00008.17, Fn-III: PF00041.11).
Hughes [8] concluded that EGF domain repeats underwent homogenization within each Tenascin gene after
duplication, but remained conserved after the divergence
of rodents and primates. The same conclusions can be
drawn after the evaluation of the diagrams generated with
paralogous (Figure 1A and 1B) and orthologous (Figure
1C) sequence pairs. Our diagrams are also in accordance
with the conclusions of Hughes regarding the evolution of

with the default PhyML parameters of the script (WAG+Γ+I, 4 gamma categories, gamma parameter and proportion of invariable sites estimated by ML, BIONJ starting tree) and with colour gradient paramater w set to 2. The repeats (EGF on A, B and
C; Fn-III on A', B' and C') are indicated by red rectangles in the protein sequence schemes (N-termini on top). The identified
homology relations are represented by lines or arcs connecting the respective repeats (blue lines between repeats of different
protein sequences (orthology), and brown arcs in case of internal relations (paralogy)). The colour scale bar demonstrates the
colour intensities as a function of the patristic distance between the respective clades divided by the total tree length. The lines
represent the values between 0 and 1 by units of 0.1. The sequence positions are shown on the right of each scheme. Abbreviations: TCH: Homo sapiens Tenascin C; TXH: Homo sapiens Tenascin X and TXM: Mus musculus Tenascin X.

Fn-III type domain repeats. These repeats can be divided
into three categories. The last three C-terminal repeats
demonstrate conservation since the duplication of the
Tenascin X and Tenascin C genes (Figure 1A', B' and 1C').
Other repeats became homogenized within each gene
subsequent to gene duplication, but have remained conserved following the divergence of primates and rodents
(Figure 1C'). The repeats of the third category have
evolved in a concerted fashion in rodent and primate lineages since their divergence (Figure 1C').

Conclusion
Although pairwise repeat homology diagrams do not
carry all the information about the phylogenetic tree on
which they are based, by visualizing the exact positions of
the repeats and the homology relations, they permit a
rapid and intuitive assessment of the patterns of repeat
evolution (compare Figure 1C' with Figure 2). These features make t2prhd a powerful tool, especially in cases of
massive datasets, as in studies of repeat evolution in large
gene families.
