Abstract
Background: Genomic diversity of H. pylori from many different human populations is largely
unknown. We compared genomes of 65 H. pylori strains from Nottingham, England. Molecular
analysis was carried out to identify rearrangements within and outside the cag-pathogenicity-island
(cag PAI) and DNA sequence divergence in candidate genes. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out
based on various high-resolution genotyping techniques.
Results: Analyses of virulence genes (cagT, cagE, cagA, vacA, iceA, oipA and babB) revealed that H.
pylori strains from England are genetically distinct from strains obtained from other countries. The
toxigenic vacA s1m1 genotype was found to be less common and the plasticity region cluster was
found to be disrupted in all the isolates. English isolates showed a predominance of iceA1 alleles
and a functional proinflammatory oipA gene. The English H. pylori gene pool revealed several Asian/
oriental features. This included the predominance of cagA – glr (cagA right junction) motif types III
and II (up to 42%), presence of vacA m1c alleles and phylogenetic affinity towards East Asian /
Amerindian gene pools based on fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP)
analysis and glmM sequence analysis.
Conclusion: Overall, our results demonstrated genetic affinities of H. pylori in England with both
European and the Asian gene pools and some distinctive genetic features of virulence genes that
may have evolved in this important European population.

Background
Infection of the gastric mucosa with H. pylori results in a
number of disease outcomes including gastritis, which

precedes the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric
cancer and lymphomas of the MALT [1-3]. These diseases
caused by H. pylori and their prevalence rates differ in

different geographic countries and only a subset (10%)
[4] of infected patients develop one of them. This raises
the question as to why H. pylori causes disease in a few
individuals, but not in the great majority [5].
Many studies have demonstrated the involvement of bacterial virulence factors, host genetics and environmental
factors in contributing to the development of disease. Bacterial virulence factors include proteins mediating establishment/colonization, persistence of infection and
finally long-term damage to the host [6]. The cag pathogenicity-island (cag PAI) is the most noteworthy among
these factors. PCR analyses have suggested that this island
is not intact in many strains across the world [7] and the
presence of an intact PAI although not always [8,9] is
indicative of a more severe outcome [10]. The expression
of various products encoded in the cag PAI is known to be
involved in inducing inflammation, ulceration and carcinogenesis [11]. However, the cagA is expressed by the
majority of H. pylori strains, irrespective of the geographic
origin and clinical diagnosis [12].
The vacuolating cytotoxin antigen (VacA) is another virulence factor that is considered to constitute an increased
risk for development of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer
[13,14]. Allelic variations in the vacA gene are found in the
signal (s1, s2) and the middle region (m1a, m1b, m2) and
the s1 type is associated with ulcer disease [14,15].
More pronounced inflammation is associated with
strains, which express the outer membrane protein OipA.
OipA induces IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells. Active
OipA protein production may be 'on' or 'off' depending
on the number of CT repeats in the signal sequence of the
oipA gene (HP0638). H. pylori strains may also be grouped
geographically based on oipA sequence pattern [16]. Specific adhesins viz., babA and babB mediate the adherence
of the bacterium to specific human blood group Lewis
antigens and are associated with various disease outcomes
[17]. Similarly, a putative E. coli restriction enzyme NlaIII
homologue, the iceA gene in H. pylori, which is activated
on contact with the epithelium, is also shown to induce
high levels of IL-8 [18].
Accordingly, strains with OipA 'on' status, active forms of
iceA and babA [18] and particularly strains which are
cagA+ and vacA s1 have been shown to cause a more severe
outcome [14,15,19], though not in all cases [20].
Many studies have pointed out a bio-geographical variation in virulence factors; for example, the sequences of
vacA and cagA differ in strains from the United States and
Europe from those in China and Japan [21]. Also, the
prevalence and type of H. pylori infection varies with a very
high rate of occurrence (up to 70%) in Asia and the Mid-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/32

dle East [22], in contrast to only 30–50% in Europe and
the United States [23]. Further, the infection is minimal in
children in the west while in the rest of the world it affects
both young and the old. Active infection with H. pylori was
seen in about 7.5 million people in the general population of England and Wales. This although varied from one
region to the other with the highest rates recorded in London [24]. Thus H. pylori remains an important infection in
the UK.
H. pylori population has been described as highly recombining, and therefore exhibits enormous strain diversity,
part of it may be due to the presence of the plasticity zones
[25]. Since this organism has also been shown to be transmitted within families, a greater number of epidemiological studies reveal that these strains not only show similar
genotypic profiles when obtained from related patients
but also show common profiles within isolates from specific countries [26]. Phylogeographic affinities were pronounced in case of European strains based on the multi
locus sequence typing of seven housekeeping genes where
the European strains and the Asian strains shared an
ancestral relationship [27]. This observation was also
recorded in other studies based on the evolutionarily conserved ERIC sequences that indicated close associations
between the Irish, Spanish and the European strains and
also clustering of the English strains with a few Asian
strains [26]. However, the number of English strains used
in that study was very small. It is noteworthy in this
respect that comprehensive phylogenetic analyses in case
of English strains have been rarely performed.
In this study, we aimed at a comprehensive assessment of
the prevalent genetic structure of H. pylori strains infecting
the English population in Nottingham, which is centrally
located in the United Kingdom. The strains were analyzed
to study a total of 45 different parameters pertaining to 28
informative loci including the virulence factors cagA, oipA,
iceA and vacA in addition to other genes of the cag PAI and
the motifs downstream to it. Composition of the plasticity
region cluster including the putative gastritis (JHP0986)
and gastric cancer (JHP0947) associated markers were
also studied [25]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed
using FAFLP markers, nucleotide sequences of the cagA,
babB and the glmM genes and the repetitive sequences
interspersed in the H. pylori genome (ERIC and REP).
According to our observations, phylogenetic placement of
English strains shows affinities with East Asian and Amerindian strains.

determined by PCR using primer sequences from the reference articles denoted by the number in superscript.

Macroscale analysis of the cag-PAI and the downstream
motifs
The status of cag A gene was assessed by using primers specific to sequences at both the 5' end and the 3' ends. PCRs
for the 5' end were positive in 41 strains (62.1 %),
whereas only 35 strains (53%) were PCR positive for the
cag 3' end. Twenty-one strains (31.8%) had both the ends
detected by PCR indicating therefore the possible presence of a complete gene.

or the type I (Ia/Ib) motif (28.8%). The type IIIb motif
was observed in a single isolate (N3), while 13.6% strains
displayed the type II motif. The type IV motif was amplified in only 9% of the strains and among the three strains
recovered from patients of Indo – Pakistani origin, N105
showed a type I a signature, while N115 showed type II
motif. The type III motif was also observed for strains
from patients of Chinese (N 99) and Russian (N90) ethnicities settled in UK.

Of the ten strains PCR negative for both cagA ends, the
oipA gene frame status was "on" for 8 of them. Hence we
showed no association between the presence of the cagA
gene and the frame status of oipA. Only two strains out of
the 10 completely PCR negative for cagA did not have any
motif type on the right end of the gene PCR amplified.

The frame status of the oipA gene was 'off' in 8 of the 12
strains that did not have successful amplification of any
motif types on the right end of the cag PAI and between
the 3' end of the glr gene.

The most frequently detected gene by PCR in UK strains
was cagT (83.3%) followed by cagE (71.2%).
Upon analysis of the extreme right junction of the cag PAI
(region extending from the cag A 3' region to the glr gene),
54 strains out of 66 had either the type IIIa motif (28.8%)

The sequence of the 250 bp product amplified from the 3'
end of the cagA gene was determined for 16 English
strains. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences in comparison with others from Holland (n = 1), East Asia (n =
4), India (n = 2), Bangladesh (n = 2), South America
(Peru, n = 2 and Guatemala, n = 2), South Africa (n = 1)
and Gambia (n = 2)) (Figure 2E) revealed that the Asian
strains carried a unique cagA gene sequence and formed a

segregated cluster. Strains from Africa clustered close to
the Indian ones whereas English strains showed no specific clustering.
vacA and iceA statuses of the isolates
87.8 % of the strains possessed the toxigenic type s1 vacA
allele while the less toxigenic s2 allele was detected in ~
6% strains. The vacA m2 genotype was present in 66.6%
strains and only 21.2 % strains had the m1a genotype. The
m1c subtype found in strains from India [28] was
observed in 3 strains and none of the strains had a type
m1b vacA allele. Therefore, the s1m2 type of vacA was
most commonly (66.6%) found in these English strains.
Only 38 of the 58 strains (65.5%) with vacA s1 allelic subtype had the oipA gene in frame.

The iceA1 allele was present in 38 strains (57%) whereas
the iceA2 allele was found in 24 strains (36.3%). Only two
strains were positive for both the alleles (N22, N105). The
likely explanation is that these "strains" were in fact mixture of two strains.
Status of the Proinflammatory protein oipA gene
(HP0638)
Strains from UK mostly had the oipA frame status 'on'
(70.5%) with the CT dinucleotides repeated 6 times in
37.7% strains. This was followed by the repeat number of
7 observed in 18 % strains and 9 in 11.5% strains. 10 CT
repeats were found in a single isolate (N52) and a single
repeat was shown in three strains. These results and those
for other loci studied are shown in the bar diagram [Figure
1].
Inventory of the plasticity region ORFs in English strains
The ORF HP986 (referred to as the gastritis associated
marker) [25] was PCR amplified in 31 strains (52.5%),
while the gastric cancer associated ORF JHP947 [25], was
amplified in only 10 strains (19.2%). Other ORFs from
this region that were amplified included JHP912, which
was seen in 93.5% strains. The ORF JHP926 was amplified
in 32.6 % of the strains while a J99 specific ORF JHP931
thought to be involved in DNA replication [25] was found
in 51.1% strains. ORFs JHP944 and JHP945 were amplified in 13% and 40% strains respectively. None of the
strains showed any specific pattern of ORFs within the
plasticity region.
Phylogenetic placement and affinities with other
genogroups
The housekeeping gene, glmM, was present in all the
strains (100%) and the adhesin babB was amplified in 51
strains (77.27%). The babB gene has been a marker of
choice for tracing lineage in H. pylori and recent studies
employing this gene have postulated H. pylori 's association with its human host to be approximately 11,000

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/32

years old [27,29]. Hence phylogenies [Figure 2C – glmM
tree and 2D – babB tree] were generated based on the
sequences of these genes in representative strains. These
phylogenies revealed that strains from England clustered
with other European strains (Ireland-Ire and SpainHupB), while some affinities between them and Peruvian
strains could also be noticed. Individual branches representing geographically specific glmM sequences were
observed for India (MS, L), Japan (Hu), and Africa (R).
FAFLP patterns of English strains revealed about 130 fragments in the size range of 50–500 bp when the genomic
DNA was digested with enzymes MseI+0/EcoRI+A. A
binary table indicating the presence or absence of a particular amplicon in each strain was scored and these values
were used to assess the genetic relatedness within English
(abbreviated N) and with other European strains
including those from Sardinia (SarD), Spain (HupB) and
Ireland (Ire). These strains clustered in one group labeled
in the figure as the European cluster. Another cluster
obtained was the one which represented contribution
from Asian- European gene pool and included strains
from India (L, BJ & MS), Japan (Hu), Africa (R) and others
from Europe (HupB, Ire, N) [Figure 2B].
A similar trend was observed with other fingerprinting
techniques employing the Enterobacterial Repetitive
Intergenic Consensus sequences (ERIC) and the Repetitive Extragenic Palindrome (REP) sequences. Based on the
amplification patterns of genomic DNA between the REP
sequences, the English strains grouped with the Irish ones
in a European cluster and a segregated cluster constituting
all Indian strains from Ladakh and a single strain from
England (N114) was obtained [Figure 2F]. ERIC phylogeny for this set of strains in comparison with other strains
from different world populations as reported earlier [26]
indicated that these strains clustered closely with either
the Spanish and Irish strains and more distantly with the
Indian and African strains.

Discussion
Evolution of infectious microorganisms is a consequence
of the genetic polymorphisms they accumulate, which in
turn is the result of the long term selection pressure
exerted by the host immune system in case of chronic
infection as well as the environment [9,30]. This is more
pronounced in case of bacteria like H. pylori that cause
multi decade long infections, wherein an acquiescent
requirement to constantly keep their genomic content
recasting is crucial. In H. pylori this concern is resolved by
the use of restriction – modification systems and regulation at gene level by nucleotide substitution, insertion and
deletion events [31]. Further, the presence of insertion elements, plasticity regions and the pathogenicity islands
contribute considerably to its genetic diversity.

We attempted to analyze genetic variation and structure of
H. pylori populations infecting the native people of England. The UK today is more culturally diverse than ever
before with the majority of the UK population being ethnic Europeans (92 %). The remaining 4.6 million (or 7.9
%) people represent other ethnic groups. South Asians are
the largest of these groups, followed by Caribbean and
Black Africans [32]. Such a multiethnic presence creates an
interesting genetic conundrum when we attempt to analyze incidence and healthcare-impact of any pathogen
that biases itself with respect to the host genetic makeup.
Also, associations of the disease outcome with the virulence factors has thus far been enigmatic and since there
were no comprehensive studies involving multiple loci for
genotype-phenotype assessments, the current study was
envisaged in combination to generate base line data relevant in molecular epidemiology of virulent strains in
England.
The cag PAI is a major virulence determinant in H. pylori
and strains lacking this island are akin to commensals
rather than pathogens [1]. Reports suggest that the presence of a complete set of genes within the cag PAI ensures
a 5-fold increased severity of disease outcome than the
intermediate PAI [10]. We have earlier showed that a
higher number of strains from Japan had an intact cag PAI
[7], hence it may be thought as an important factor influencing the outcome of the infection as a higher rate of gastric cancers was observed in the Japanese patients. The
possible role of cagA in oncogenic mechanisms is being
worked upon [33]. Most English strains in our case
retained the cagT and the cagE genes. Studies showed that
strains lacking the cagT gene had a defective 'molecular
syringe' that is encoded by the PAI [34] reflecting thus on
inability of the Type IV system to eject out the cagA protein. The cagE gene on the other hand is known to induce
NFkB activation and IL8 secretion [8] in addition to mediating host-cell cytokine rearrangements in infected epithelial cells. About 25 % of the strains carried the type IIIa
motif on the right end of the cagA gene. This observation
also supports the hypothesis that some of the European
strains share some features typical of the Asian genogroups. This is also supportive of an earlier observation
[31] that a very small number of strains from the European countries also show the type III motif.
English strains mainly showed a higher number of the
toxigenic s1 type of vacA allele. Interestingly, the s1m1
combination was observed in less percentage in contrast
to the s1m2 genotype that was seen in 60 % of the cases.
Earlier studies in a subset of European population (MidEssex) by RFLP of the mid-region of the vacA gene in
strains originating from dyspeptic patients demonstrated
that 46% of these strains had the s1m2 genotype while
40% strains had the more toxigenic s1m1 combination

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/32

[35]. The s1m2 genotype was also common in strains
from North Wales among clarithromycin sensitive and
resistant H. pylori [36]. It was interesting to find the m1c
allele [28], which is known to be prominent in the East
Asians, in UK strains. None of the strains had multiple
vacA genotypes, which are common in China and other
East Asian countries [37]. It has been reported earlier that
the s1 allele was most frequently observed in the European population with the s1a allele predominant in
Northern and Eastern Europe. Also, s1a and s1b alleles
were observed in France and Italy while the Spanish and
Portuguese strains had the s1b subtype [13].
The virulence spectrum of the English strains was also
exemplified by the observation that 70% of these strains
had the oipA gene in frame. Greater than 6 CT repeats in
the upstream homopolymeric tail of the oipA gene is characteristic of European strains [16]. Our results indicate
that English strains most commonly displayed 6 CT
repeats. Strains with 9 CT repeats were reported to have
the gene out of frame owing to the deletion of the CTAA
sequence present immediately upstream of the CT repeats
[16]. Similar results were found with English strains with
9CT repeats. From our analyses, the iceA1 allele was more
common than the iceA2 allele. Although no association
between iceA subtypes and clinical outcome has been
reported, strains carrying iceA1 produce higher levels of
IL-8 in the gastric mucosa and are more often associated
with DU in the North America and Dutch people than
strains carrying iceA2 [38]. The plasticity region genes are
speculated to provide the strains with survival benefits in
some hosts [25]. This region extends from the ORFs
JHP914 to JHP951 in the sequenced strain J99 and is
shown to be unstable since some genes within the zone
are lost during subsequent infections or laboratory passages [25]. It is now evident from partial sequencing of a
Peruvian isolate that this plasticity region might encode
yet another type IV secretion system [39] and that the 2
sequenced genomes carry incomplete sets of genes corresponding to this cluster. All the English strains we looked
at were similar to either strains 26695 and J99 in that
none of them harbored a complete plasticity region cluster as shown recently for a Peruvian strain [39] (data not
shown). However, any role of such a putative secretory
system is still enigmatic due to lack of correlation of its
intactness or abrogation with disease, although, some of
the ORFs in the plasticity region have been shown to be
associated with a particular disease outcome [25,40]. For
English strains, we analyzed seven ORFs from the plasticity region cluster, of which HP986 was strain 26695 specific, while others excluding HP912 were J99 specific. The
ORF HP912, the predicted cell division protein/septum
formation protein (ftsA) was PCR amplified in 93.5 %
strains. JHP931, a predicted DNA topoisomerase I was

amplified in 51%. None of the strains had the same
regions of the plasticity zone deleted.
Our phylogenetic analyses based on the FAFLP markers
showed a star like distribution on an unrooted neighborjoining network. Four clusters were evident and the largest
cluster was populated mainly by English isolates. Further,
affinity to Irish and Indo-European genogroups was also
observed. These observations were also substantiated by
other slow evolving markers such as ERIC and REP
sequences. This denotes stable associations among the
genogroups. Similarly, cluster analysis of babB and glmM
genes also revealed close associations within the European strains and with the Indian strains. However,
homologies with East Asian and Amerindian strains were
most noteworthy and were comparable to those shown by
Irish strains [41]. This reflects ancient genetic events and
possible oriental influences on the evolution of H. pylori
in the English population. Such kinds of non-random
genetic links of H. pylori may be helpful in understanding
evolution of this organism and its clinical consequences
in different parts of the world. These findings are in
accordance with a recent study that demonstrated that
Indian and European H. pylori isolates grouped in the
same subpopulation and that East Asian and a subset of
European isolates share an ancestral relationship and
diverged from each other recently [27,42]. The Asian
strains, however, were distinctly separated from the European and western strains based on the cagA gene
sequences except for a few strains that show remote similarity to the East Asian gene pool. We found only a single
English strain (N115) that diverged significantly towards
the Asian cluster and was recovered from a patient of
Indo-Pakistani origin and thereby denotes contribution
from the Asian gene pool.

strain groups. Further characterization of associations of
such informative loci as we examined, in the gene pool of
diverse strain groups and with varied disease spectrum
may lead to newer insights into the mechanisms of H.
pylori colonization, and virulence in different hosts.

Methods
Bacterial DNA preparations
Sixty-six DNA preparations using Nacl-CTAB method [43]
from English H. pylori strains were obtained from the
strains corresponding to patients reporting at the Queen's
Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK. These strains were
recovered from patients diagnosed with ulcer disease, having either current ulceration, past ulceration, evidence of
scarring at endoscopy or erosions at endoscopy. More
than half of these patients were taking acid suppression
therapy. These strains were mainly from ethnic English
people, although a few were from people originally from
Russia (N90), China (N99), South Asia (N105, N115,
N131) and Italy (N106) who had settled in the UK.
Strains from other countries were taken from our international collection of genomic DNAs provided by our collaborators. Among these are strains from Spain (HupB, n
= 7), Ireland (Ire, n = 14), Japan (Hu, n = 10), Peru (Sjm,
n = 6), Sardinia (Sard, n = 2), India (MS, n = 1; L, n = 10;
BJ, n = 1), Bangladesh (n = 2), Holland (n = 2), and S.
Africa (R, n = 8).
Molecular genotyping and sequencing
Amplification of candidate gene loci including oipA, babB,
vacA middle region, cagA and glmM genes were carried out
as described previously [44,31,41]. Purified PCR amplified products (QIAquick Gel extraction kit) were
sequenced using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
USA) in an ABI 3100 automated DNA sequencer.

Conclusion
In summary, our study demonstrated certain distinctive
genetic features of the H. pylori gene pool in England
based on genotypes of virulence genes and neutral markers. Important among these features is the genetic affinity
towards East Asian strains. This is also probably the first
comprehensive study on detailed, multilocus and multi
method genotyping of H. pylori from England or elsewhere. The genomic profiles generated in this study may
be useful for electronic archiving and retrieval for interlaboratory comparison and are suitable for storage in epidemiological databases for comparative analyses. However, it will be necessary to analyze additional
representative strains, especially from other European
populations. Also, our study has largely been an examination of a specific (peptic ulcer disease) group of patient
isolates and may not be reflective of other patient isolates
from different disease stages in England. Future studies are
therefore clearly needed to involve other disease specific

The iceA allele status was determined using oligonucleotide primers mentioned elsewhere [44]. The cag A, cag E
and the cag T genes within the cag PAI were detected using
4 pairs of primers as mentioned earlier [7]. Analysis of
rearrangements of the motifs at the right end of the cagA
gene and towards the 3' end of the glutamate racemase
gene (glr) were performed with seven different sets of
primers as described previously [31]. PCR primers and
procedures used for evaluating the presence of the plasticity region ORFs HP 912, JHP 926, JHP 931, JHP 944, JHP
945, JHP 947 and HP 986 have been described elsewhere
[25]. The annealing temperatures for the ORFs HP912,
JHP 926 and JHP 944 were standardized to 59, 57 and
66°C respectively for 1 min, followed by an extension at
72°C for 1 minute.
Consensus sequence for each sample was generated using
Genedoc (version 2.6.002). Clustal X (version 1.81) was

used to align these sequences and dendrograms representing the genetic relationships between strains were generated using Treeview (version 1.6.6). Frame status of the
oipA gene was analyzed using Lasergene software (DNAStar Inc. USA). Genetic diversity of the cagA sequences of all
the representative isolates tested from English patients
were compared to other records from Genbank [China47
(AJ252985), Hong Kong81 (AF198486), Hong Kong77
(AF198485), Japan 54 (AF198484), S. Africa19

sequences were also used along with sequences from English strains for the phylogenetic tree construction.

parisons. The cag PAI rearrangement profiles and cag A –
glr motif types were also compared to existing records in
the database.

Whole genomic fingerprinting and genotyping
Whole genome fingerprinting based on FAFLP genotyping
was done as described previously [43,45]. Briefly, the profiling of whole genome micro-restriction fingerprints with
EcoRI/MseI enzymes using fluorescence tagged primer
pairs EcoRI+A/MseI+0 and EcoRI+G or A / MseI+0 was performed. The PCR amplified fragments for each of the
strains were then subjected to electrophoretic separation
on a 5% acrylamide gel and scoring of the fluorescent
markers was done using an automated DNA analysis
workstation (ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer).

Additional material

The PCR methods for the ERIC fingerprinting technique
has been previously described [26]. The REP based typing
procedure involved primers for amplifying unique DNA
sequences between the two REP signatures [46]. All the gel
images corresponding to ERIC and REP PCRs were analyzed using the Quantity 1.0 software in a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad, USA). These images were then
uploaded into Diversity 2.2.0 database (Bio-Rad, USA).
Band sizes, band attributes and standard molecular
weights were assigned alongside the molecular weight
markers. Cluster analysis of DNA profiles was conducted
on the basis of fingerprint characteristics. Based on the
data for the presence or absence of 3–15 different DNA
fragments in the fingerprints of strains of H. pylori, a
binary data matrix was created. Overall similarity between
the pairs of strains was calculated from the binary data
matrix using the simple matching dice coefficient. The
resulting similarity matrix was used for cluster analysis by
the unweighted paired group method with arithmetic
averages (UPGMA) to generate trees.
Data archiving and genome wide comparisons
All the data obtained through candidate gene sequencing
and DNA profiling was deposited in the genoBASE pylori
database http://www.cdfd.org.in/amplibase/HP. The
genoBASE pylori server was queried for genome wide com-
