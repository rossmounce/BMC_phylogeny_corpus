Abstract
Background: HIV-1 is a retrovirus with high rate of recombination. Increasing experimental
studies in vitro indicated that local hairpin structure of RNA was associated with recombination by
favoring RT pausing and promoting strand transfer. A method to estimate the potential to form
stem-loop structure by calculating the folding of randomized sequence difference (FORS-D) has
been used to investigate the relationship between secondary structure and evolutionary pressure
in some genome. It showed that gene regions under strong positive "Darwinian" selection were
associated with positive FORS-D values. In the present study, the sequences of HIV-1 subtypes B'
and C, both of which represent the parent strains of CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and China URFs, were
selected to investigate the relationship between natural recombination and secondary structure by
calculating the FORS-D values.
Results: The apparent higher negative FORS-D value region appeared in the gag-pol gene region
(nucleotide 0–3000) of HIV-1 subtypes B' and C. Thirteen (86.7 %) of 15 mosaic fragments and 17
(81 %) of 21 recombination breakpoints occurred in this higher negative FORS-D region. This
strongly suggested that natural recombination did not occur randomly throughout the HIV
genome, and that there might be preferred (or hot) regions or sites for recombination. The FORSD analysis of breakpoints showed that most breakpoints of recombinants were located in regions
with higher negative FORS-D values (P = 0.0053), and appeared to have a higher negative average
FORS-D value than the whole genome (P = 0.0007). The regression analysis also indicated that
FORS-D values correlated negatively with breakpoint overlap.
Conclusion: High negative FORS-D values represent high, base order determined stem-loop
potentials and influence mainly the formation of stem-loop structures. Therefore, the present
results suggested for the first time that occurrence of natural recombination was associated with
high base order-determined stem-loop potential, and that local base order might play a key role in
the initiation of natural recombination by favoring the formation of stable stem-loop structures.

Background
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a
complex retrovirus, which encodes the enzyme reverse

transcriptase (RT), and exhibits high mutation rates due to
the lack of the DNA proofreading activity of the viral RT.
HIV-1 genome is diploid, containing two plus-strand viral

RNA copies that can be identical. In the process of viral
DNA synthesis, template switching occurs by translocation of RT between two genomic RNAs, and results in
both intra-molecular and inter-molecular recombination.
If dual infections or superinfection with different strains
or subtypes of HIV-1 occurs, two different RNA templates
might be co-packaged into one virion, yielding a heterozygous virion. In a subsequent infection cycle, RT may
switch from one template (the donor) to the other (the
acceptor), producing a mosaic HIV-1 genome [1,2]. HIV1 has high potential to form recombination variants [3,4].
The high rate of recombination is due to the frequent template switching of RT. At least 2.8 template switching
events occur per genome per replication cycle was estimated previously [5]. Genetic recombination and point
mutation are both important strategies to increase viral
diversity, which allow HIV-1 to escape immune attack and
to develop possibly drug-resistant variants [6].
Retroviral recombination generally occurs during minusstrand DNA synthesis [7]. The "Dock and Lock" model
had been proposed to shed light on the mechanism of retroviral recombination. This model suggested that RT
switches templates when it encounters palindrome (hairpin) structures that can induce RT to pause. RT pausing
during synthesis can enhance strand transfer [1,2,8]. RNA
secondary structures play an important role in the function of an RNA molecule, such as RNA-protein interactions, transcription, translation, and so on. Previous
studies in vitro have indicated that specific RNA secondary
structures were associated with strand transfer by favoring
RT pausing [9,10]. However, it remains uncertain whether
RNA secondary structure is involved in the generation of
circulating HIV-1 recombinants.
Currently, some HIV-1 recombination variants have been
identified worldwide [6]. Sixteen prevalent inter-subtype
recombinants were recognized as circulating recombinant
forms (CRFs) from 01 to 16, respectively [11]. Three CRFs,
CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC were found in
China. Of them, CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC possibly
arose in Yunnan Province, and had circulated widely
among injecting drug users (IDUs) [12-16]. In addition,
the unique recombinant forms (URFs), between subtypes
B' (Thailand variant of subtype B) and C, are epidemic
among IDUs in Dehong Prefecture in western Yunnan,
suggesting on-going generation of new HIV-1 intersubtype recombinants [14,15]. Most HIV-1 infected IDUs in
China were unemployed, and never received any antiretroviral therapy due to lack of income [16]. Therefore,
there is no drug selective pressure associated with generation of recombinants in China, and these recombinants
represent the occurrence of natural recombination.

The stem-loop structure is the most important secondary
structure of RNA. A method to estimate the potential to
form stem-loop structure by calculating FORS-D has been
used to investigate the relationship between secondary
structure and evolutionary pressure [17,18]. Previous
studies by Forsdyke showed that gene regions under
strong positive "Darwinian" selection were associated
with positive FORS-D values, reflecting the conflict
between stem-loop structure potential and specific protein function [17,19-21]. In addition, our previous work
found that the FORS-D values correlated negatively with
ccr5 gene deletions, indicating that stem-loop structure
influences the deletion [22]. These suggested that stemloop structures might play an important role in mutation
strategies and gene evolution. Therefore, in the present
study, we selected China CRFs and URFs as a means to
investigate the relationship between the secondary structure and natural recombination by analyzing the FORS-D
values of HIV-1 genome.

Results and discussion
The distribution of FORS-D values in HIV subtype B' and C
genomes
Previous studies have analyzed the local secondary structural information of some HIV-1 strains by calculating the
"statistically significant" stem-loop potential, and found
that different regions of HIV-1 genome had different
potential to form stem-loop structures [23,24]. The
regions with high stem-loop potential were generally
associated with the interaction between local secondary
structures and corresponding protein factors. For example, trans-acting responsive element (TAR) and Revresponsive element (RRE), both of which are recognized
by the Tat protein and Rev protein respectively, have more
stable local secondary structures than other regions of
HIV-1 genome [23-25]. A negative correlation between
"statistically significant" stem-loop potential and
sequence variability (substitutions) was observed in the
HIV-1 genome. In the regions with higher negative FORSD values, indicating that base order favors stem-loop
potential, the rate of base substitutions tend to be lower.
Contrarily, higher positive FORS-D values decrease stemloop potential and is functionally important, because the
rate of base substitutions increases [20,23-25].

Genetic recombination is another important pathway to
generate variability for HIV-1. Previous studies found that
local stem-loop structure enhanced the occurrence of template switching of RT [2,10,26]. To assess whether local
stem-loop structure is involved in the generation of natural HIV-1 recombination, FORS-D analysis was applied to
estimate the potential of HIV-1 sequences to form stemloop structures. The FORS-D value represents a base
order-determined stem-loop potential, and provides a
measure of the contribution of base order alone to the

Yunnan Province of China has a high HIV-1 prevalence
among IDUs and generates multiple forms of HIV-1 intersubtype recombinants [14,16]. Because most HIV-1
infected IDUs are unemployed, they almost never receive
any antiretroviral therapy [16]. Therefore, the recombinant forms circulated among IDUs indicate the occurrence of the natural recombination between HIV-1
subtypes B' and C without drug selective pressure. To
investigate the relationship between local stem-loop
potential and natural recombination, two closely related
HIV-1 strains, 95IN21068 and RL42, which are known to
be parent strains of China inter-subtype B' and C recombinants, were selected as objectives to analyze FORS-D.

formation of stem-loop structure [18]. The FONS value
determines the trend of total stem-loop potential.

FONS and FORS-M values found in RL42 and 95IN21068
are shown in part A and B of Figure 1, respectively. Both
HIV-1 strains appeared to have similar trends in FONS
and FORS-M values. FORS-M values were relatively constant (For subtype B': median value was -35. 79 kcal/mol
with a range from -65.78 to -19.6 kcal/mol; for subtype C:
median value was -36.42 kcal/mol, with a range from 65.6 to -20.25 kcal/mol). However, a large fluctuation was
observed with FONS values. Several higher negative FONS
values appeared in 5' and 3' termini, 3' end of the gag
gene, and around nucleotide 7250 in the env gene. These
results were consistent with the previous observations in
other HIV-1 strains [20,23-25]. Figure 1C shows FORS-D
values for both 95IN21068 and RL42. Except for a few
regions, HIV-1 subtype B' and C genomes appeared to
have similar distribution of FORS-D values. The windows
with higher negative FONS values accordingly appeared
to have higher negative FORS-D values. The fluctuations
of FONS values observed in the whole genome of the both
HIV-1 subtypes were largely base-order dependent, as
reflected in the FORS-D values (Fig. 1A, B and 1C ). The
highest negative FORS-D values of both sequences
occurred around nucleotide 7250 in RRE region (nucleotide 7081–7432).
For each HIV-1 subtype, the distribution of FORS-D values differed in different regions of the gene. The apparent
higher negative FORS-D value region occurred in the gag
gene and at the 5' end of the pol gene (nucleotide 0–3000)
(For subtype B': gag-pol region: -5.403 ± 0.8155 kcal/mol;
whole genome: -3.165 ± 0.4886 kcal/mol, P = 0.0217. For
subtype C: gag-pol region: -6.495 ± 0.6398 kcal/mol;
whole genome: -3.775 ± 0.5035 kcal/mol, P = 0.0045).
However, an intense fluctuation of positive and negative
FORS-D values around the abscissa was observed in the
region from the 3' part of pol gene to env gene (nucleotide
3000–8000). This region encodes RT, integrase, envelope
glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, other important regulatory (Tat and Rev) and accessory (Vpr, Vif, Vpu, and Nef)
proteins. They determine HIV-1 replication and efficient
infection, and are exposed immediately to the human

tribution correlates with secondary structures of RNA templates due to sequence difference between vector and
circulated strains. To assess whether stem-loop structures
are involved in occurrence of natural recombination, we
selected subtype B' RL42 and subtype C 95IN21068, both
of which represent the parent strains of existing CRFs and
URFs in China, to carry out FORS-D analysis. Currently,
besides CRF07 and 08, only two other full-length
sequences of URFs circulated in China are available. These
four existing recombinants, representing four different
recombination variants, were selected and analyzed using
the Simplot software. Their mosaic patterns are shown in
Fig. 1D. The breakpoints of recombination are identified
in the FORS-D distribution of RL42 and 95IN21068 (Fig.
1C and 1D) by fine vertical dashed lines. In addition to
these four full-length sequences, other URFs were also
analyzed despite the availability of only gag-RT region
(about 2600 nucleotides) [14]. Figure 2 shows their partial mosaic map and FORS-D distribution in breakpoints.

immune system and under strong positive "Darwinian"
selection [27]. Previous studies on retroviral genes [19],
MHC genes [20], snake venom phospholipase A2 [21] and
other genes [17], had showed that a region under strong
positive selection exhibited generally positive FORS-D
values. Our results supported the observation that FORSD value was associated with evolutionary pressure [17,1921].
The relationship between the HIV-1 B'/C intersubtype
recombination and stem-loop potential
In vitro studies using the HIV-1 derived vector system indicated that HIV-1 genome has high rate of recombination
and hot spots for recombination occurrence [3,5]. The hot
spots were located in stable hairpin structures [4]. However, the previous observation did not indicate whether
the occurrence of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in worldwide dis-

In total, 15 different inserted recombined fragments were
identified in China HIV-1 B'/C intersubtype recombinants
(Fig. 1D and 2B) [12-15]. Thirteen (86.7 %) of these
mosaic fragments occurred in the higher negative FORS-D
value region (nucleotide 0–3000) of parent genomes,
where the gag gene and 5' end of the pol gene are located.
On the other hand, because several shared breakpoints
were observed in these mosaic molecules, which were
confirmed by our previous reports [14,15], 15 mosaic
fragments only contained 21 unique breakpoints. For
example, fragment 5, 6, 7 and 13 shared the 3' end breakpoint. Among these breakpoints, 17 (81 %) also located
in this higher negative FORS-D value region. This strongly
indicates that natural recombination did not occur randomly throughout the HIV genome, and that there might
be preferred (or hot) regions or sites for recombination
[3,5]. These observations suggest an association between
recombination and high negative FORS-D values (Fig. 1C
and Fig. 2A).
In order to further confirm the relationship between
recombination and high negative FORS-D values, FORSD values of corresponding breakpoints of parent
sequences were calculated as described in the Methods.
The FORS-D values of breakpoints of 15 fragments were
shown in Table 1. For most fragments, at least one breakpoint of each fragment was found to be located in regions
with higher negative FORS-D values. Two exceptions were
fragment 11 and 12. They had at least one breakpoint
located in the regions of higher negative FORS-D values in
one parent subtype, and at least one breakpoint located in
the regions of negative FORS-D values (close to the mean
of whole genome) in another parent subtype (Table 1).
Twenty-one breakpoints appeared to more favor occurring in higher negative FORS-D values region (69 %, P =

# The fragment numbers were consistent with those of Fig. 1D and 2B. * The FORS-D values of breakpoints were calculated as described in the
Methods. The average FORS-D values of subtype B' and C HIV-1 genome were -3.17 and -3.78, respectively. The value of < -3.17 (subtype B') or <
-3.78 (subtype C) represents the region with higher negative FORS-D value.

0.0053), and negative FORS-D values region (92.9 %, P =
0.0007). In addition, the average FORS-D values of breakpoints (-6.29 ± 0.81 kcal/mol) also appeared to be more
negative than whole genome (-3.47 ± 0.35 kcal/mol) (P =
0.0079), suggesting that the values of breakpoints were
significantly different from that of whole genomes. The
data indicated that recombination preferentially occurred
in high negative FORS-D regions.
In vitro experiments indicated that strand transfer of RT
involved RT pausing and triggering retroviral recombination [1,26]. Further evidence showed that secondary structures of RNA template, especially, hairpin or stem-loop
structures play a key role in RT pausing and strand transfer
[2,10,26]. Two obligatory strand transfers of RT had been
observed to occur in terminal sequences of viral genome
with stable hairpin structures and high stem-loop potential [9]. The hairpin structure facilitates RT pausing, which
stimulates RT-RNase H activity and results in donor template degradation. Pause-induced donor template degradation initiates strand transfer. Then, strand transfer is
thought to progress through a two-step mechanism, first
acceptor invasion, then primer terminus transfer. Two
models, the kissing hairpin interaction model and the
"Dock and Lock" model, have been proposed to explain
this mechanism [1,26]. Both models emphasize the key
role of hairpin structure in strand transfers. High negative

FORS-D value, representing high base order-determined
stem-loop potential, occurred generally in one or both
acceptor and donor sites (Fig. 1C, 2A, and Table 1), which
was supported by previous in vitro observation [2].
Further evidence for the location of breakpoints was provided by plotting FONS, FORS-M, and FORS-D values of
each window against its percentage of breakpoint overlap.
Figure 3 shows the linear regression analysis of the relationships between FONS (A), FORS-M (B), and FORS-D
(C) values (kcal/mol) and breakpoint overlap. In form
Fig. 3, we observed that plots for FORS-M were horizontal(r = 0.0003), and plots for both FONS and FORS-D
slopes were slightly diagonal (r = 0.053 and 0.061, respectively). The slopes of the least-squares regression lines for
FONS and FORS-D values were significantly greater than
zero (P = 0.006 for FONS and P < 0.0001 for FORS-D).
The regression analysis indicated that FONS and FORS-D
values correlated negatively with breakpoint overlap, and
that the correlation coefficient, as well as P value, also supported these relationships (Fig. 3). FONS value represents
the total stem-loop potential, and FORS-D provides a
measure of the contribution of base order alone to the
stem-loop potential of a sequence. Negative FORS-D values imply that local base order favors the formation of stable stem-loop structures. Therefore, the observation above
suggested for the first time that occurrence of natural

tures [1]. In addition, the present results supported the
previous observation that hairpin structures were
involved in retroviral recombination [2,10,26]. However,
a further study to extend the FORS-D analysis to other
intersubtype recombinants (CRFs and URFs) circulated in
other countries and regions of the world should be
conducted.
Does the information of local base order expressed by
FORS-D values play a key role in the selection of
evolutionary strategies for reducing the selective pressure?
Two CRFs and multiple forms of URFs have been detected
in Yunnan Province of China, where needle or syringe
sharing among IDUs is popular [14,16]. Needle or syringe
sharing increase the risk of dual virus infections and subsequent recombination between different subtypes of
viruses. To date, however, little is known about whether or
not these new recombinants are associated with stronger
infectivity and higher replication ability. We do know that
the location of natural recombination is not random
throughout the HIV genome, and there are some specific
hot spots for recombination situated in the genome. Previous experimental observations in vitro revealed that
hairpin structures increase the rate of recombination
between viruses [2,8,10,26]. Here, our results support that
previous notion, and indicated firstly that natural recombination was associated primarily with high base orderdetermined stem-loop potential (FORS-D values).

FORS-D value tends to fluctuate around zero and determines the trend of FONS value. It contains a large amount
of evolutionary information about nucleic acids, and generally appears to be negative number [17]. Negative
FORS-D values favor the formation of stem-loop structure
and are widely distributed in long genomic segments from
a variety of species. Positive FORS-D values, represent the
conflict of evolutionary pressures on base order, and
occur more frequently in regions under positive Darwinian selection, such as promoter regions, exons and so on
[17,19-21]. The regions with positive FORS-D values indicate a tendency for local base order to support protein
encoding function rather than formation of stem-loop
structure. Therefore, FORS-D value generally appears to
correlate positively with base substitution densities and
dN/dS ratio [17]. On the other hand, our previous and
present studies showed that FORS-D values were associated with the occurrence of deletion [22] and recombination mutations, which suggests that local base order is
involved in the occurrence of both recombination and
deletion. Because positive FORS-D values correlate with
high ratio of base substitution and negative FORS-D values for recombination or deletion, we can deduce that
local base order plays a critical role in the selection of gene
evolutionary pathways. However, further evidence is
required to support this hypothesis.

Conclusion
By analyzing the FORS-D values of HIV-1 subtypes B' and
C, both of which represent the parent strains of
CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and China URFs [12-14], we
found that most breakpoints of these recombinants were
located in regions with higher negative FORS-D values,
and appeared to have a higher negative average FORS-D
value than for the whole genome. The regression analysis
indicated further that FORS-D values correlated negatively
with breakpoint overlap. These results suggested for the
first time that occurrence of natural recombination was
associated with high base order-determined stem-loop
potential, and that local base order might play a key role
in the initiation of natural recombination of HIV-1 by
favoring the formation of stable stem-loop structures.
Combining with previous reports that FORS-D correlates
positively with the ratio of base substitution [17,19-21],
we could deduce that local base order might play a critical
role in the selection of gene or genome evolutionary pathways, and determines the evolutionary strategies adopted
by gene or genome to reduce the selective pressure.

Methods
Sequences and recombination analysis
In this study, the sequences of RL42, 97CN001, 97CNGX7F and URFs, were retrieved from GenBank (Table 2).
RL42, 97CN001 and 97CNGX-7F are generally used as
representative strains of China HIV-1 subtypes B [28],
CRF07_BC [12] and CRF08_BC [13], respectively.
Sequences of RL42, 97CN001, 97CNGX-7F and URFs
were aligned with subtype reference sequences using Clustal X 1.8 [29]. The full-length sequences of subtype reference isolates are available in the Los Alamos database
[11]. The recombination breakpoints were analyzed by
using Simplot software (version 2. 5) [30]. The parameters
were used as follows: Window size: 200 bps; Step size: 10

bps; Tree algorithm: Neighbor; Distance model: Kimura;
Bootstrap replicate: 100; Reference type: 50 % consensus.
FORS-D analysis of HIV-1 subtypes B'and C
The previous studies had described the application of
FORS-D analysis in detail [17,18]. In brief, two factors,
base composition and base order, contribute to stem-loop
formation of a nucleic acid molecule. So the total stemloop potential of a sequence can be divided into the contribution of base composition alone and the contribution
of base order alone to form stem-loop structure. For a natural sequence, FONS, FORS-M and FORS-D represent
total stem-loop potential, base composition-determined
stem-loop potential and base order-determined stemloop potential, respectively. FONS values are calculated
by using computer program, RNAstructure (version 3.6)
[31], which based on free energy minimization to find a
theoretical optimum secondary structure. FORS-M value
is the mean minimum free energy value of the 10 randomised sequences generated from the same window. Ten
randomised sequences were obtained using the shuffle
program included in the on-line software package SMS
[32]. FORS-D is the difference between FONS and FORSM, and closely corresponds to "statistically significant"
stem-loop potential developed by Le et al. for analyzing
potential RNA folded substructures [33].

Because CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and most URFs are B'/C
inter-subtype recombinants with mostly subtype C and a
few small subtype B' segments [12-14], we selected RL42
and 95IN21068 for FORS-D analysis. RL42 and
95IN21068 are related closely to those recombinants in
phylogenetic evolution and generally used as a subtypes
B' and C sequence reference, respectively. Both sequences
lack the 5' long terminal repeats (LTRs) and are available
from GenBank under accession numbers AF067155 and
U71182, respectively. To analyse the FORS-D, each

sequence was divided into 177 successive 200-nucleotide
windows. Each overlapped the previous window by 150
nucleotides. For each 200-nucleotide window, both
FONS value and FORS-M value were calculated using
RNAstructure software. Then, the difference between
FONS and FORS-M (FONS less FORS-M) generated FORSD value.

FORS-D analysis of recombination breakpoints
The position of each breakpoint was obtained using the
Simplot software (version 2.5) with 200-nucleotide window size and 10-nucleotide step size. So three successive
200-nucleotide windows were selected to calculate FORSD values of recombination breakpoints. The position of
each breakpoint was used as the center of the middle window, and each window overlapped the previous one by
190 nucleotides. The average of three windows represents
the FORS-D value of each recombination breakpoint.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad
Prism version 2.00 (Biomedical Sciences, Creighton University). The FORS-D location of breakpoints was analyzed by the χ2 test. The differences of FORS-D values of
recombination breakpoints and gag-pol gene region with
whole genomes were compared by the t test.
