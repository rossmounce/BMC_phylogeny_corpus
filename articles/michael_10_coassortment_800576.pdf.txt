Co-assortment in integron-associated gene cassette
assemblages in environmental DNA samples
Carolyn A Michael1*, Nigel R Andrew2

Abstract
Background: It has been shown that integron-associated gene cassettes exist largely in tandem arrays of variable
size, ranging from antibiotic resistance arrays of three to five cassettes up to arrays of more than 100 cassettes
associated with the vibrios. Further, the ecology of the integron/gene cassette system has been investigated by
showing that very many different cassettes are present in even small environmental samples. In this study, we seek
to extend the ecological perspective on the integron/gene cassette system by investigating the way in which this
diverse cassette metagenome is apportioned amongst prokaryote lineages in a natural environment.
Results: We used a combination of PCR-based techniques applied to environmental DNA samples and ecological
analytical techniques to establish co-assortment within cassette populations, then establishing the relationship
between this co-assortment and genomic structures. We then assessed the distribution of gene cassettes within
the environment and found that the majority of gene cassettes existed in large co-assorting groups.
Conclusions: Our results suggested that the gene cassette diversity of a relatively pristine sampling environment
was structured into co-assorting groups, predominantly containing large numbers of cassettes per group. These
co-assorting groups consisted of different gene cassettes in stoichiometric relationship. Conservatively, we then
attributed co-assorting cassettes to the gene cassette complements of single prokaryote lineages and by
implication, to large integron-associated arrays. The prevalence of large arrays in the environment raises new
questions about the assembly, maintenance and utility of large cassette arrays in prokaryote populations.

Background
Integrons include a site-specific genetic system capable of
mobilising and rearranging genes packaged as mobile
gene cassettes [1]. In concert with other DNA mechanisms capable of mobilisation between cells, the integron/
gene cassette system contributes to the overall process of
lateral gene transfer (LGT). LGT is a major contributor
to genetic diversity amongst prokaryotes [2] and hence a
significant force in prokaryote evolution. The ability of
the integron/gene cassette system in particular to influence the evolution of prokaryote strains is graphically
shown in the rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance
genes both geographically and amongst different prokaryotes [3]. However, cassette-associated genes are not limited to the provision of antibiotic resistance. While the
majority of the ORFs (open reading frames or putative
genes) contained within gene cassettes have no analogue

in sequencing databases, those few for which a function
has been attributed, have been adaptive in nature [4,5].
An integron generally consists of an integrase gene,
IntI, its promoter PInt, an attachment site attI, which is
recognised by the IntI integrase, and a promoter P c .
Gene cassettes, the class of DNA elements mobilised by
an integron, typically consist of an ORF, and an attachment site termed attC (or 59-be elsewhere), which also
provides a recognition site for the IntI integrase. The
integron mobilises DNA by inserting or excising gene
cassettes through the action of the IntI integrase at sites
defined by both attI and attC. Repeated rounds of insertion result in the formation of a tandem array of gene
cassettes adjacent to the integron, commencing at the
attI site [6]. Because Pc is oriented towards the cassette
array through attI, those cassette-associated genes proximal to Pc may also be expressed [7].
A number of gene cassette arrays have been observed
in detail to date [8-10]. These arrays can contain in
excess of 200 gene cassettes in strains of the vibrios.

Interestingly, phylogenetic examination of closely related
strains containing large arrays such as the Vibrio pandemic strains, has showed multiple cassette indels
between otherwise identical cassette arrays [11] suggesting that the dynamics of gene cassettes within an array
may not be limited to single cassette mobilisation. However, an examination of the dynamics of gene cassettes
within the wider prokaryote communities has not been
explored. While cassette diversity in environmental samples is substantial [12-14], relationships amongst different types of gene cassette have yet to be addressed in an
environmental context. An understanding of environmental interactions among gene cassettes is of fundamental importance because patterns of co-assortment in
the environment may firstly reflect the linkage seen
amongst gene cassettes within arrays, as well as offering
the ability to monitor changes in the constitution of
arrays in situ. Consequently, in this work we asked the
following questions:
1) Do gene cassettes co-assort in the environment?
2) To what extent does any co-assortment represent
the presence of gene cassette arrays or other genetic
linkage between cassettes?
3) Are large gene cassette arrays, as seen in sequencing studies, a common vehicle for containing gene cassettes in the environment?
4) What patterns of co-assortment are present in a
natural environment?

Methods
Sampling

Spatially explicit soil samples were taken from a dry
sclerophyll woodland in North Ryde, Australia, (151.07°
079′E. 34..46°108′S WGS1984). The soil is derived from
Hawkesbury Sandstone, is well-drained and low in nutrients, particularly P and N. The environment at the time
had been experiencing a period of relatively high temperatures and protracted drought. Two parallel 5 m
transects, 10 m apart were used. Six 5 ml soil samples
were taken at 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 m distances
from an origin point along each transect. Samples were
stored overnight at 4°C prior to environmental DNA
extraction and subsequent analysis.
Single soil samples were taken from additional sites at
ranges up to 200 km. These sites included a pristine site
at Hornsby rifle range (151.05°.079’E 33.41°.179’S WGS
1984).
Environmental DNA extraction

The extraction of representative DNA from environmental soil samples followed the methods of Yeates et
al. [15]. Replicate DNA extractions were performed on
all soil samples.

a fluorescence value of 20 units were excluded due to
the low Signal/Noise value.
Distribution analysis

The data set from the CSCS PCR included correlated
peak height and size class information and was consolidated in a spreadsheet. Size classes were rounded to
unit base pair and then applied to a 1-1000 bp size continuum for each sample and the results of duplicate
DNA extractions averaged. Size classes less than 70 bp
were discarded as primer dimer artifacts and PCR noise.
Subsequently, remaining peaks in the replicate DNA
extractions, PCRs and digests were averaged across
replicates and the percentage standard error calculated.
Thereafter, mean peak height values for each size class
in each soil sample were assembled into a further
spreadsheet with samples ordered along the collection
transects.
Sorting populations by spatial distribution

To determine if different cassette size classes coassorted, each gene cassette size class within the spreadsheet-based data distribution, was firstly scored for the
number of DNA samples in which it appeared. Additionally, each cassette size class was scored on its presence in either or both sampling transects. The
distributions were then rearranged so that gene cassette
size classes sharing the same spatial distribution were
adjacent in the table (Additional file 1).
Measuring co-assortment

Relationships amongst cassettes between samples along
both transects was assessed using non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) in Primer 6.1 [17]. Amplicon
abundance data was log(x+1) transformed to improve
the underlying distribution of the data.
Null Modelling

High-resolution electrophoresis

The fluorescent products of the CSCS PCR were analysed on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer by supplying 1 ul
aliquots of each PCR reaction, using denaturing gels at
approximately 2500V for 1.5 hours. Polyacrylamide gels
(6%) were poured with the addition of TEMED and
ammonium persulphate after degassing to enhance polymerisation. 1500 bp size standards from ABI were used
preferentially for increased low-end resolution and due
to the absence in the samples taken of significant fragments larger than 1000 bp. The system was run typically
at 2500V for approximately 4 hours to achieve single
base pair resolution over the range 20-1500 base pairs.
Peaks below 70 base pairs in size were excluded as
being primers or primer artifacts. Likewise, peaks below

The spatial distribution of gene cassette size classes was
assessed using null models [18], to assess the degree to
which the spatial distributions might arise from chance
alone. Null models used in this analysis determined the
degree of randomness within a distribution [19] with
respect to the two parameters of interest in this study:
size class and sample site. Therefore, null modelling
returned a probability that an arrangement of gene cassette size classes sharing a particular spatial distribution
within the data set was due to chance alone. Null models were performed on the gene cassettes size class data
using EcoSim 7® [20]. A co-occurrence model, the
C-score index [21], was used to test for species cooccurrence in a presence/absence matrix. Five thousand
iterations of a random assemblage matrix were

compared using a random seed number to begin the
sequence. Row sums were fixed and column sums were
equi-probable. The average amount of co-occurrence
among all unique pairs of species in the assemblage is
measured by the C-Score. This measure is superior to
other indices in both Type I and Type II error properties [20]. We used one simulation algorithm which is
considered robust and recommended by Gotelli &
Entsminger [20]: Sim9: Fixed rows-fixed columns. This
simulation maintains fixed row and column sums. It has
a good Type I error rate, and is powerful at detecting
patterns in noisy data sets when used with the C-score.

Results and discussion
The environmental DNA samples used in this work had
previously been examined for gene cassette diversity
[12]. In that work, it was also established that the amplicons returned by the fluorescent cassette (CSCS) PCR,
represented identifiable gene cassette sequences. Consequently, the amplicons returned from the CSCS PCR
were termed gene cassette size classes.
Initial analysis of the gene cassette size class data set
showed that cassette size classes did not assort randomly (Table 2, p observed > = expected: < 0.0001).
This was seen most clearly in the non-metric multidimensional scaling plot (Figure 1), where the degree of
similarity of cassette populations between different sample sites mirrored their physical locations, thus showing
relationship amongst sample sites. In order to further
investigate this non-random arrangement of cassette
size classes, a more detailed examination of the distribution was undertaken:
Only two of the cassette size classes were detectable in
all environmental DNA samples. The remainder were
detectable only in subsets of the DNA samples. It was
noted that for the majority of the cassette size classes,
their distribution within the sampling area was contiguous. That is, the presence of a gene cassette size class
within one DNA sample generally implied its presence
in adjacent samples in the same transect.
The majority of detected cassette size classes coassorted with other cassette size classes within the
sampling area. That is, the particular spatial distribution of a gene cassette size class amongst the environmental DNA samples was shared by other gene
cassette size classes, so forming a “co-assorting group’.

The most obvious type of co-assorting group was
where a number of cassette size classes were present
only in a single DNA sample. An example of such a
group was the 16 different cassette size classes that
occurred only in the D sample of transect 2 (Additional file 1). A further type of co-assorting group consisted of a number of different cassette size classes
present in multiple DNA samples. An example of this
type of group was the 18 different cassette size classes
that only occurred in transect 2, samples E and F
(Additional file 1).
Amongst co-assorting groups containing many cassette size classes, across multiple environmental DNA
samples, it was noted that the size class with the largest
peak height in one DNA samples was generally the size
class with the largest peak height in the other DNA
samples in which the group was present. This relationship also held amongst other member peak heights
excepting where the peaks were very large or small and
so approached the performance limits of the instrumentation used. This meant that the “fingerprint’ of the relative peak heights of the different size classes of a group
in one DNA sample was also evident in other environmental DNA samples. For example, a group containing
18 different size classes across seven of the environmental DNA samples, labelled “Group A’ in Additional file
1, is shown in Figure 2. The same pattern of peak height
conservation appeared in some groups of size classes
that occupied a subset of the DNA samples of a more
widespread group. An example of this is seen in Group
B in Additional file 1, where cassette size classes were
present in all except one of the environmental DNA
samples in which Group A was present (Figure 2).
Co-assorting groups with greater than four different
cassette size class members involved more than 80% of
the 585 different gene cassette size classes detected.
Similarly, 20 distinct co-assorting groups, each containing greater than ten different size classes could be
distinguished when the cassette data set was sorted for
spatial distribution.
Do co-assorting groups of cassette size classes reflect
genetic linkage?

Where a cell line contains an example of the integron/
gene cassette system, cassette arrays containing many
different members are often present. Gene cassettes
within such arrays, being on the same DNA molecule,
are in stoichiometric relationship. Consequently, we
hypothesised that the co-assorting cassette size classes
observed in this work represented multiple gene cassettes from one or more arrays within a single bacterial
lineage. We examined this hypothesis by testing for stoichiometric relationship between cassette size classes
within a co-assorting group.

Co-assorting groups containing many cassette size
classes across multiple environmental DNA samples
were chosen for this work. This choice allowed a comparison of the relative amounts of two representative
cassettes in different locations, while still providing a
negative control in those DNA samples where the coassorting group did not occur. Representative cassette
size classes that differed significantly in size (bp) were
selected to obviate possible PCR artefacts such as polyA tailing.
Group A-B, (Additional file 1 and Figure 2) was
selected for this comparison study. The 482 bp cassette
size class from group A, the largest peak height size
class in this group was selected for examination. Selection of a 429 bp size class as the second size class from
the analogous Group B (Additional file 1, Figure 2) provided a stringent test of the proposed stoichiometric
relationship. The relative abundances of the 482/429 bp
cassette pair were in constant ratio where they occurred
in the sampling area demonstrating that these two cassettes were in stoichiometric relationship (Figure 3A).
Similarly, a 258 bp and 347 bp gene cassette selected
from a different co-assorting group (Additional file 1)
were compared and shown to be in stoichiometric relationship (Figure 3B). Finally, a third pair of gene cassettes, a 253 bp cassette and a 325 bp cassette, that
were not members of the same co-assorting group, was
examined as a control (Figure 3C). This 253/325 bp pair
did not maintain the same relative abundance across
environmental DNA samples in which they both
occurred, indicating that these non-co-assorting cassettes were not in a stoichiometric relationship.
Sequences of the 482 bp and 429 bp gene cassettes
were found to be novel and are shown in Additional
files 2 and 3, while the 258 bp and 347 bp gene cassettes
were determined to be Bal 29 (Genbank AF349051) and
Bal 28 (Genbank AF349084) cassettes respectively [22].
All sequenced cassettes contained ORFs, none of which
showed significant matches with the existing genomic
databases beyond homology with previously sequenced
gene cassettes. PCRs using the specific primers derived
from these cassettes were used to probe the suite of
environmental DNA samples taken from the sampling
area. The presence of appropriately sized amplicons in
only those samples containing the original size class verified that targeted cassettes were members of the appropriate co-assorting groups.
The PCR methodology used in this work does not
recover all gene cassettes within a DNA sample due to
diversity amongst attC sequences in gene cassette populations. Consequently, the number of gene cassette size
classes detected under-samples the true diversity present
in the sample. However, the methodology used produces
amplicons, identifiable as gene cassettes, with a

specificity of greater than 95% [16] and the cassettes
amplified are not restricted to individual cassette arrays.
Consequently, the subset of the environmental cassette
assemblage returned by this method was not substantially biased. The detection method used, being based
on amplicon sizing, also does not discriminate between
different cassettes of the same size [12] and so further
under-samples the environmental gene cassette diversity.

Therefore, the gene cassette size class data set used in
this work was a representative rather than comprehensive estimate of the gene cassette metagenome in this
environment. Nevertheless, the stoichiometric relationship uncovered between the gene cassettes that were
found to comprise the co-assorting groups of cassette
size classes indicated their location within a copy-number-controlled environment. While a copy-numbercontrolled environment could be construed to be
cassettes within the same integron-associated array, the
prevalence of prokaryote lineages containing multiple
integrons [23], suggests that the co-assorting groups
could equally indicate cassettes within the same cell but
present in different integron associated arrays. So,
encompassing both of these possibilities, we considered
that a single co-assorting group as found here, represented a subset of the gene cassette complement of an
individual prokaryote lineage within the sampling
environment.
Assessing linkage between co-assorting gene cassettes

In order to examine the possibility that gene cassettes in
co-assorting groups might be part of the same array, PCR
primers used to identify co-assorting gene cassette pairs
were also used in long range PCRs on the environmental
DNA samples. By using alternate primers specific to each
gene cassette, four possible orientations between the two
target cassettes were examined to determine any linkage
between the cassettes of a co-assorting group, as well as
to examine any intervening DNA.
The 258/347 bp gene cassette pair produced a 3.1 Kbp
amplicon from long-range PCR. This product was seen
in only one of the environmental DNA samples containing these cassettes. This PCR used a forward primer
specific for the 258 bp gene cassette (MRG 53b) and a
reverse primer for the 347 bp gene cassette (MRG 56)
indicating that these two cassettes were in the same
orientation, as defined by the orientation of their respective attC sites. Further, this orientation was the same as
typically seen amongst the attC sites of cassettes within
arrays. PCRs on the 3.1 Kbp amplicon, using both 258
bp (MRG 53b/MRG 54) and 347 bp specific primer
pairs (MRG 55/MRG 56) showed that complete copies
of both gene cassettes were present on the 3.1 Kbp fragment. A final PCR of the 3.1 Kbp fragment using generic attC site primers (HS 286/HS 287), showed the
presence of intervening gene cassettes between the 258
bp and 347 bp gene cassettes, further indicating the presence of these two cassettes within an array.
The 429/482 bp cassette pair produced no reproducible amplicon in any long-range PCR in any of the environmental DNA samples. It is noteworthy that the 258/
347 bp gene cassettes originated from a co-assorting
group containing only eight cassette size classes.

Page 7 of 10

Additionally, these eight size classes differed in length
from the 258 bp and 347 bp cassettes by no more than
six bp and so probably represented PCR artefacts in the
amplification of a short array. In contrast, the 429 bp
and 482 bp cassettes originated in a group containing
more than 20 distinctly different size classes. Consequently, it was more likely that the 258/347 bp pair
were closely linked within an array than the 429 bp and
482 bp cassettes. Therefore, the likelihood of successful
amplification of the 429/482 bp pair if contained within
a large array was necessarily reduced.
Do the same cassettes co-assort in other environments?

Gene cassettes are mobile genetic elements and so the
cassette complement of a prokaryote lineage might be
expected to vary under the continued influence of LGT.
The analytical method used in this work to establish the
presence of co-assorting groups could not be used to
detect changes in the cassette complements of individual
lineages within the sampling area, as changes in the
constitution of a cassette group across the sampling area
would produce two distinct co-assorting groups. However, the PCR primers defining individual cassette pairs
within co-assorting groups, as developed to determine
stoichiometric relationships, could also be used to assess
other environmental DNA samples for the presence of
these target cassettes.
Amongst a selection of 22 environmental DNA samples taken from a diverse range of environments within
Australia, the 429/482 bp pair of cassettes was found in
no other environment. However, both members of the
258/347 bp pair were found in one of the alternate
environments (Hornsby rifle range), approximately 20
km from the site used for the majority of this study.
Additionally, this pair of cassettes was previously identified in soils taken from the Balmain power station site
and identified as Bal29 and Bal28 respectively. The Balmain site was approximately 15 km distant from the
sample area used in this study. In contrast to the other
sites in which the 258/347 bp pair was found, the
Balmain site was characterised by heavy metal and
hydrocarbon contamination. The observation that these
two cassettes retained their association over large geographical distances and in disparate environments suggested that the linkage between these cassettes was
robust. Consequently, it was inferred that cassette mobilisation may not necessarily be a common event in these
environments. This corroborated observations of the
significant numbers of inactivated integrons seen in
environmental sequencing studies [23].
The distribution of gene cassettes in the sampling area

The detection of co-assorting cassettes and their identification as cassette complements of individual prokaryote

lineages allowed conclusions to be drawn regarding the
arrangements of gene cassettes in prokaryote populations:
There were at least 2043 different gene cassettes within
the sampling area [12]. In this study, we considered a
representative sample of this gene cassette assemblage,
being the 585 distinct size classes returned by the analytical methods used. Of these 585 size classes, more than
70% could be ascribed to 20 discernable co-assorting
groups containing more than ten cassette size classes. As
shown in this work, these co-assorting groups were
representative of the gene cassette complements of distinct prokaryote lineages present in this environment.
From this perspective, the following observations were
made regarding the gene cassette assemblage in the
sampled environment.
Firstly, lineages with large complements of gene cassettes, the largest being 46 different size classes in this
study, contained the majority of the gene cassette diversity in this environment. Secondly, the distribution of
individual co-assorting groups did not generally extend
across the sampling area but rather exhibited “patchy”
but spatially contiguous distributions within the sample
area. For example, the group from which the 258 bp
and 347 bp cassettes were taken was present in samples
A through E in transect 1 but not in sample F which
was more than three metres away from its neighbour,
sample E. Neither did this group appear in any of the
transect 2 samples.
Thirdly, it had been previously established that
approximately 10% of prokaryote phylotypes contain
one or more integrons [23,24]. In the environmental
DNA samples used in this work, it was found from
paired 16S TRFLP analyses using different restriction
enzymes, which both returned essentially the same
number of 16S species, that there were approximately
504 distinct prokaryote phylotypes. Consequently, we
predicted that approximately 50 of the phylotypes present would contain integrons and consequently, gene
cassettes. Therefore, the 20 prokaryote cassette complements containing ten or more size classes, together with
the at least 20 groups containing less than ten size
classes detected in this work, represented a close
approximation of the expected number of cassette-bearing phylotypes. However, it has also been shown that
the number of cassette size classes detected in this sampling area significantly underestimated the local cassette
diversity [12]. In this environment, therefore, the
expected number of integron-containing lineages had
been approximated by the number of observed coassorting groups, while the cassette diversity remained a
significant underestimate. While there are a number of
possible explanations to account for this discrepancy, it
was most likely that the additional gene cassette species
were undetected members of the co-assorting groups

present. If this were the case, the array or arrays [23]
associated with each cassette-bearing lineage would generally be large. Consequently, the relatively small arrays
seen in association with the highly mobile, antibioticresistance bearing, class 1 integrons would be the exception rather than the rule in this environment and possibly in the wider cassette metagenome.
This last observation calls into question the adaptive
utility of the integron/gene cassette system. It is currently thought that gene cassettes proximal to the integron are preferentially expressed [25]. Accordingly, for
gene cassettes to reliably provide a selective advantage
to the host through their expression, an array must
necessarily be short: typically of the order of 8-10 gene
cassettes to ensure reliable expression as has been the
case in the well studied class 1 integron [7]. It has been
hypothesised that large cassette arrays such as those
seen in Vibrio spp. express only those cassettes proximal
to the integron with the distal cassettes forming a cassette library to be accessed through rearrangements of
the array [25]. In this work, the preponderance on large
cassette complements in the environment, coupled with
the apparent stability of at least some cassette associations, suggested that the large cassette complements and
hence arrays represented a current adaptive advantage
rather than a readily accessible adaptive “library’ [25] or
long-term replicative burden to the host lineage. The
means by which large arrays might provide such an
adaptive advantage could be explained by the existence
of intra-array promoters and consequent expression of
distal cassettes: a theory in need of further assessment.
Further applications of the measurement technique used
in this work

A study of the reproducibility of the normalised peak
heights of individual cassette size classes from replicate
DNA extractions and PCRs showed a high reproducibility for peak heights greater than 20 and less than 2000
fluorescence units, with a SE% (percentage standard
error) value of less than 5%. Parallel comparison of the
normalised peak heights for the same cassette size class
in different DNA samples containing the same coassorting group, showed more variability with an average
SE% of 15%. It was assumed that this variability was due
to differing quantities of constituent gene cassettes in
each size class apart from the cassette that was part of
the co-assorting group.
The reproducibility of relative peak heights for a coassorting group independent of DNA sample suggested
that a combination of the cassette size classes and their
relative peak heights of their amplicons are useful “fingerprints’ of the many cassette complements in this
environment. These “fingerprints’ may be used to monitor changes in the cassette assemblages, both spatially

and temporally, by detecting changes in either or both
the characteristic cassette size classes present or in the
normalised peak heights. Lateral gene transfer in natural
prokaryote populations can then be examined
systematically.

Conclusions
We have found that the gene cassette diversity of a relatively pristine sampling environment is predominantly
structured into a number of co-assorting groups of cassettes. These co-assorting groups consist of gene cassettes in stoichiometric relationships. Conservatively, we
have then attributed co-assorting cassettes to the gene
cassette complements of single prokaryote lineages.
Amongst integron-bearing prokaryote lineages, complements containing large numbers of different cassettes
were found to be relatively common in the sampling
environment. As a result, we expect that large gene cassette complements and hence large integron-associated
gene cassette arrays are not uncommon and may predominate within environmental gene cassette assemblages.
