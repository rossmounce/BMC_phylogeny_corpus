Abstract
Background: Several entropy-based methods have been developed for scoring sequence
conservation in protein multiple sequence alignments. High scoring amino acid positions may
correlate with structurally or functionally important residues. However, amino acid background
frequencies are usually not taken into account in these entropy-based scoring schemes.
Results: We demonstrate that using a relative entropy measure that incorporates amino acid
background frequency results in improved performance in identifying functional sites from protein
multiple sequence alignments.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the application of appropriate background frequency
information may lead to more biologically relevant results in many areas of bioinformatics.

Background
Protein multiple sequence alignments are widely used to
infer conservation of amino acid residues within an evolutionarily related family [1,2]. Highly conserved residues
tend to correlate with structural and/or functional importance, and accurate identification of such important residues aids in experimental characterization of protein
function.
One commonly used sequence conservation measure is
the entropy score. In its simplest form, the entropy score
for each aligned column in a multiple sequence alignments can be expressed as:
naa

Sentropy = H = −∑ pi log 2 pi
i

(1)

where naa is the number of residue types in the column
representing an alignment position, and pi represents the
observed frequency of residue type i in the aligned column. Other, more complicated, residue conservation
measures derived from the entropy score have been developed and used in identifying functionally important residues [3-8].
In recent years many sophisticated functional site prediction algorithms have been developed (for reviews, see
[9,10]). Many of these prediction algorithms implicitly or
explicitly analyze the amino acid variations in a given
position in multiple alignments. The evolutionary trace
method analyzes residue variation patterns within and
between protein subfamilies from multiple alignments,
and maps important residues to protein structure [11,12].
A further development of this method incorporates
entropy information for more accurate ranking of residue
importance [13]. Oliveira et al devised entropy-variability

plots that can be used to identify structurally and functionally important residues [14]. Pei et al used the conservation difference between artificial sequence profiles and
naturally occurring sequence profiles to detect homology
and identify active sites [15]. Soyer et al used site-specific
evolutionary models for predicting functional sites in proteins [16]. Wang et al used linear models to analyze multiple alignments for mutated viral proteins to identify
amino acid positions important for drug resistance [17].
Chelliah et al identified interaction sites by separating the
structural and functional constraints for each position in
multiple alignments [18]. Greaves et al used geometrybased and sequence profile-based calculation for predicting enzyme active sites [19]. Cheng et al introduced a
hybrid method incorporating both sequence conservation
and structural stability to predict functional sites [20]. The
SIFT server automatically constructs multiple alignments
for query sequence and then predicts amino acid substitutions that are likely to affect protein function [21]. The
ConSurf server identifies protein functional region by surface mapping of phylogenetic information inferred from
multiple alignments [22]. The MINER server uses phylogenetic motifs from multiple alignments to identify protein functional site regions [23]. Besides functional site
identification, the residue conservation information can
also be used to identify residues determining subfamiliy
functional specificity [24-28]. The prevalence of these
methods suggests that the extraction of conservation
information from multiple alignments is important for
the correct prediction of functional residues or regions.

Results and discussion
Rationale
Here, we argue that entropy scores that do not incorporate
background amino acid frequencies are not theoretically
optimal for calculating residue conservation. To demonstrate this, we rewrite the entropy score using a uniform
amino acid frequency distribution Pu (pu = 1/naa for each
residue type in the aligned column):
naa

H = −∑ pi log 2 pi
i

naa

naa

i
naa

i

= −∑ pi (log 2 pi − log 2 pu ) − ∑ pi log 2 pu

(2)

= −∑ pi log 2 (pi / pu ) − log 2 pu
i

= −D(Pi || Pu ) − log 2 pu
where D(Pi || Pu) is commonly referred to as the relative
entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Therefore, the
entropy score is numerically identical to the negative relative entropy between the observed amino acid frequency

distribution Pi and a uniform distribution Pu, minus a
constant. In statistics, relative entropy arises as the
expected logarithm of the likelihood ratio, and it may be
used as a measure of the distance between two probability
distributions [29]. In the case of residue conservation, the
higher deviation from the "background" indicates
stronger evolutionary constraint, which suggests that this
position may perform an important functional role. However, nature does not sample every amino acid equally
when creating proteins. Therefore, the simple uniform
distribution Pu above is not optimal as a reference distribution to evaluate functional importance.
We propose that a relative entropy measure incorporating
the observed background frequency from protein
sequence databases would be a better measure to capture
the functional importance of amino acid residues. More
specifically, we propose to use the formula:
Srelative _ entropy = D(Pi || Pib ) = ∑ pi log 2 (pi / pib )

( 3)

i

where Pib can represent the background amino acid frequencies found in naturally occurring protein sequences,
or any other arbitrary set of background frequencies. This
measure will increase the scores for aligned columns containing "rare" residues, which are often functionally
important. To explain this in a more intuitive way, consider two invariant positions that have only cysteines and
only serines, respectively. The position with cysteines is
more likely to be functional. The entropy measure will
assign the same score to the two positions, but the relative
entropy measure assigns a higher score to the invariant
cysteine position, since cysteine has a much lower background frequency (~2%) than serine (~7%).
Comparative analysis of entropy score and relative
entropy score
To investigate whether our proposed relative entropy
measure (Srelative_entropy) is more sensitive than the entropy
measure (Sentropy) in detecting functional sites, we evaluated the performance of these measures to identify functionally important residues using the Thornton [30] and
Lovell datasets [18]. In addition, to investigate how the
use of different background frequencies affects the performance of the relative entropy method, we used two sets
of frequencies: the general background frequencies
observed in nature and the family-specific background
frequencies retrieved from the alignments for each query
sequence.

For each protein in the datasets, we built multiple alignments and calculated the entropy or relative entropy
scores for each residue and evaluated their performance
by two criteria: The first criterion is the ROC score, which
measures how the quantitative scores correlate with true

functional sites. The second criterion is the "top 10 hits"
score, which counts the number of functionally important
residues that are in the top 10 highest scoring residues. We
found that the relative entropy method significantly outperforms the entropy method under both evaluation criteria for both datasets (Figure 1). In addition, using
family-specific background frequencies in the relative
entropy method has similar performance to using general
background frequencies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/385

To further investigate why the relative entropy methods
perform better than the entropy method, we selected an
example from the Thornton dataset where both the relative entropy methods accurately identify the active sites in
their "top 10 hits", but where the entropy method fails to
do so. This example protein (PDB identifier 1a65A) is an
oxidoreductase, and contains three consecutive active
sites (His-Cys-His). We plotted the structures as ribbon
representation and colored the residues by their scores

evaluate performance. The family-specific relative entropy method has negligible difference in performance compared to the
default relative entropy method using general background frequencies. Both relative entropy methods perform better than the
entropy method, demonstrating that the incorporation of background frequency information improves functional site identification.

from each of the three methods (red color indicating high
scoring positions) (Figure 2). We found that the entropy
method incorrectly assigns the highest scores to the region
near the C-terminal of the protein (Asp-Asp-Leu-Pro-ProGlu-Ala-Thr-Ser-Ile-Gln-Thr-Val) and not for the residues
in the active site (His-Cys-His, depicted as spheres in figure). The frequencies of these amino acids in nature are
approximately 5%, 9%, 5%, 6%, 8%, 6%, 7%, 5%, 4%
and 6% for Asp, Leu, Pro, Glu, Ala, Thr, Ser, Ile, Gln and
Val, respectively, but only 2% and 2% for His and Cys,
respectively. Therefore, by applying the relative entropy
measure, we down-weighted the C-terminal region and
predicted higher scores for the active sites. For the familyspecific relative entropy method, the family-specific frequencies are 4% for His and 1% for Cys, so the position
with the Cys has a higher score (more intense red color)
than the neighboring His, but all three sites are still
among the top 10 hits. Our analysis indicates that taking
into account background frequencies boosts the scores for
positions containing rare amino acids and results in
improved performance for identification of functionally
important positions.
Comparative analysis of entropy scores using more
accurate frequency estimates
We further investigated whether entropy-based methods
could benefit from incorporating more accurate amino
acid frequency information. We compiled a HMM model

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/385

from multiple alignments for each query sequence, and
calculated the positional entropy or relative entropy
(using the general background frequencies) for each
aligned column, similar to a previous study [24]. There are
two main advantages of using HMM models: (1)
sequences are weighted so that the effects of uneven or
biased database sampling are reduced and (2) frequencies
of unobserved amino acids can be estimated through the
use of Dirichlet mixtures [31].
We evaluated the performance of the HMM-derived
entropy and relative entropy methods, as well as several
other residue conservation measures, including three
AL2CO-based methods [2] and the SCORECONS method
[32]. AL2CO is a program that implements an entropybased method (AL2CO_entropy), a variance-based
method (AL2CO_variance) and a sum-of-pairs method
(AL2CO_sop). The AL2CO_entropy method is similar to
our entropy method; the AL2CO_variance method uses
background frequencies that are estimated from the alignment; and the AL2CO_sop method uses pairwise similarity scores derived from a given amino acid substitution
matrix. All three AL2CO-based methods apply the default
independent count weighting scheme [33] to weight
sequences in alignments. The SCORECONS method generates a composite score that takes into account amino
acid frequencies, stereochemical diversity, gap penalties,
and sequence weighting. This scoring method has been

each method evaluated, each residue in the structure is colored by its predicted functional importance score, with the color
changing from red to white to blue as the score decreases. The entropy method incorrectly assigns the highest scores to residues in the C-terminal region, but the two relative entropy methods correctly assign the highest scores to the active sites.

used as a benchmarking score for protein-DNA interaction site identification [32] and protein functional site
identification [20]. We found that when HMM-derived
amino acid frequencies are used, the relative entropy
method still outperforms the entropy method (Figure 3),
and both methods outperform the three AL2CO-based
methods and the SCORECONS method. Among the three
AL2CO-based methods, the AL2CO_variance method
performs the best, which may be partially due to its use of
background frequencies. The SCORECONS method,
which does not outperform the HMM-derived entropy
method, was originally developed for scoring conservation in protein-DNA interaction sites and therefore may

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/385

not be well-suited for predicting functionally important
residues in general. In summary, our analysis suggests that
using more accurate amino acid frequency estimates,
together with using appropriate background frequencies,
results in improved functional site prediction from multiple alignments.
Improvements for functional site prediction can occur by
increasing the sophistication of the measures considered:
The relative entropy method only scores individual positions without considering neighboring residues. A
method that analyzes context (neighboring residues) may
improve performance. The multiple alignments generated

information, as well as accurate estimates of amino acid frequencies.

by the PSI-BLAST program may not be optimal, and more
accurate multiple alignments (such as those generated by
the HMM method) may improve performance. In addition, an appropriate treatment of gaps and sequence
weights (for example, a family specific treatment), consideration of phylogenetic relationships among sequences,
and analysis of local structural information when available, is also likely to improve performance. We believe that
a hybrid method that incorporates the relative entropy
method and all the above improvements will have significantly better performance for functional site prediction.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the use of background frequency information significantly improves entropy-based functional site
prediction. This principle has been advocated before
(such as in [34]), but its use has been very limited: For
example, sequence logo is widely used to visually display
conserved nucleotide or amino acid sites in sequence
motifs; however, many logo generation programs [35-38]
are unable to accept user-supplied background frequencies. (Some exceptions include the PICTOGRAM server
[39] and the CONSENSUS server [40].) In addition, several programs for editing or annotating multiple alignments exist [41,42], but they are unable to use
background frequencies to calculate relative entropy for
each aligned residue.
The use of background information is limited in other
areas of bioinformatics as well. For example, many programs are available to identify "functional enrichment"
for a list of genes from microarray experiment, but only a
few of them are able to accept a user-supplied list of "background genes". Dozens of tools are available to identify
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) or other functional motifs in a given sequence, but few of them are able
to take into account the background frequency of predicted TFBS or motifs in the corresponding genome
(exceptions include [43]). Fold recognition methods are
widely used to assign a query sequence to a structural fold,
but few considers the relative abundance (or prior probability) of candidate folds in the corresponding proteome.
The broader application of appropriate background information in all areas of bioinformatics will lead to more
biologically relevant results.

Methods
Data sources
We used two datasets consisting of protein functional sites
for evaluating different algorithms. The Thornton dataset
was compiled manually from primary literature on
known protein structures and was shown to be more comprehensive and specific than the SITE annotation in PDB
files [30]. The Lovell dataset contains manually compiled
protein functional sites, including ligand binding sites

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/385

and enzyme active sites [18]. The Thornton dataset contains 1,546 enzyme active sites from 508 proteins, and the
Lovell dataset contains 1,137 functional sites from 243
proteins. The same versions of the two sets have been used
previously for structure-based searching of functional sites
[20].
Criteria for performance evaluation
We used two criteria for evaluating the performance of
functional site prediction algorithms. The first criterion is
the ROC score, which computes the area under a curve
that plots fraction of true positives versus false positives by
varying the threshold value of classification. A perfect classification algorithm that puts all the functional sites at the
top of the ranked residue list has an ROC score of 1, and
a random classification algorithm has an ROC score of
0.5. The second criterion is the "top 10 hits" score, which
computes the number of functional sites among the top
10 scoring residues in a given protein. A perfect classification algorithm has a top 10 hits score of Nfun or 10 (if Nfun
is more than 10), while a random classification algorithm
has an average top 10 hits score of 10*Nfun/N (Nfunand N
denote the number of functional residues and the number
of all residues in the given protein, respectively).
Functional site identification
We evaluated several functional site identification methods that take protein multiple sequence alignments as
input for their predictions. For the Thornton and Lovell
datasets, we generated multiple sequence alignments by
searching each query sequence against the Uniref90 database [44] with the PSI-BLAST program blastpgp in the
BLAST program package [45]. We used three iterations
(through the "-j 3" option), the "-m 6" display option and
all other default parameters for the PSI-BLAST program.
The resulting multiple sequence alignments were converted to ClustalW format, and then analyzed by various
scoring methods described below.

For the entropy and relative entropy method, we used
equation (1) and (3) in the main text to assign a score to
each aligned column in the multiple alignments. We
treated gaps in the same way as an amino acid, though we
found little performance difference when ignoring gaps.
Only the residue types that appear in aligned columns
were used in the computation of the relative entropy
score. The background distribution Pib in equation (3) can
be varied to explore the use of different background frequencies. In our benchmarking experiment, we used two
different sets of background frequencies: (1) the general
background frequencies defined in karlin.c program of
the BLAST package [45], and (2) the family-specific background frequencies observed in the multiple alignments
for each query sequence.

For the HMM-derived entropy and relative entropy
method, we first compiled a HMM model using the
hmmbuild program in the HMMER package [46] with
default parameters, and then calculated the positional
entropy or relative entropy using amino acid frequencies
estimated by the HMM model. The general background
frequencies are used for the relative entropy computation.

We also used three conservation measures implemented
in the AL2CO program [2], including the entropy measure
(AL2CO_entropy),
the
variance
measure
(AL2CO_variance) and the sum-of-pairs measure
(AL2CO_sop). All the three methods use the default
"independent count" scheme for weighting sequences
[33]. The default parameters for the AL2CO program were
used for computation, except that the BLOSUM62 matrix
rather than identity matrix was used in the sum-of-pairs
method. For the SCORECONS method [32], we used the
scorecons program with default parameters.
