Latex-fruit syndrome and degree of severity of
natural rubber latex allergy: is there a link?

Venice, Italy. 17-19 February 2011
Background
Latex-fruit syndrome (LFS), defined as hypersensitivity
to particular fresh fruits (Wagner S. & Breiteneder H.
Bioch Soc Trans, 2002), has been described in 30-50% of
pts affected from natural rubber latex (NRL) allergy and
it is due to IgE Abs that cross-react with similar epitopes on phylogenetically related proteins. Objective: To
estimate the prevalence of LFS in a group of NRL allergic children and adolescents and to evaluate a possible
correlation with the severity degree of NRL allergy.
Methods
This retrospective study analyzed 22 pts (17 M, 5 F;
mean age 15,2 yrs) referred to the Pediatric Allergology
of University of Bologna from Jan. 1990 to Sept. 2010
with a history of IgE-mediated NRL allergy associated
with a level of latex specific IgE (sIgE) ≥ 0.35 kU/L
(ImmunoCAP 1000, Phadia; Sweden) and/or a positive
response to Skin Prick Test (wheal ≥ 3 mm) with latex
extract (Lofarma, Milan; Italy). Levels of total and sIgE
to grass pollen and to the main fruits implicated in LFS
were analysed.
Results
The mean age at diagnosis of NRL allergy was 7,2 yrs
(range 3-12). NRL allergic pts were divided in 2 groups,
according to the severity of symptoms after latex contact.
In group A were included 13 pts (59%) with mild symptoms (contact urticaria); in group B the remaining 9 subjects (41%) with moderate-severe symptoms (generalized
urticaria w/wo angioedema and/or respiratory symptoms
and/or anaphylaxis). Eight of the 22 subjects (36,4%)
reported symptoms from LFS to the following fruits or
combination of its: kiwi (5), peach (2), chestnut (2),
cherry (1), apple (1), melon (1). The prevalence of LFS

was higher in group B than in group A (respectively 7/9,
78% vs. 1/13, 8%; p<.005, Chi-square test). No statistically
differences in median values of total and sIgE were found
between the 2 groups (Mann-Whitney U test).

Conclusions
Our study confirms a relevant prevalence of LFS (36,4%)
in patients with NLR, with kiwi, alone or in combination, as the main implicated fruit. Moreover, a significantly higher prevalence of LFS in subjects with more
severe manifestations of NRL allergy was documented.
