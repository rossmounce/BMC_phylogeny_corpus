Abstract
Background: Studies of the phylogeography of Mexican species are steadily revealing genetic patterns shared by
different species, which will help to unravel the complex biogeographic history of the region. Campostoma
ornatum is a freshwater fish endemic to montane and semiarid regions in northwest Mexico and southern Arizona.
Its wide range of distribution and the previously observed morphological differentiation between populations in
different watersheds make this species a useful model to investigate the biogeographic role of the Sierra Madre
Occidental and to disentangle the actions of Pliocene tecto-volcanic processes vs Quaternary climatic change. Our
phylogeographic study was based on DNA sequences from one mitochondrial gene (cytb, 1110 bp, n = 285) and
two nuclear gene regions (S7 and RAG1, 1822 bp in total, n = 56 and 43, respectively) obtained from 18 to 29
localities, in addition to a morphological survey covering the entire distribution area. Such a dataset allowed us to
assess whether any of the populations/lineages sampled deserve to be categorised as an evolutionarily significant
unit.
Results: We found two morphologically and genetically well-differentiated groups within C. ornatum. One is
located in the northern river drainages (Yaqui, Mayo, Fuerte, Sonora, Casas Grandes, Santa Clara and Conchos) and
another one is found in the southern drainages (Nazas, Aguanaval and Piaxtla). The split between these two
lineages took place about 3.9 Mya (CI = 2.1-5.9). Within the northern lineage, there was strong and significant
inter-basin genetic differentiation and also several secondary dispersal episodes whit gene homogenization
between drainages. Interestingly, three divergent mitochondrial lineages were found in sympatry in two northern
localities from the Yaqui river basin.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that there was isolation between the northern and southern phylogroups since
the Pliocene, which was related to the formation of the ancient Nazas River paleosystem, where the southern
group originated. Within groups, a complex reticulate biogeographic history for C. ornatum populations emerges,
following the taxon pulse theory and mainly related with Pliocene tecto-volcanic processes. In the northern group,
several events of vicariance promoted by river or drainage isolation episodes were found, but within both groups,
the phylogeographic patterns suggest the occurrence of several events of river capture and fauna interchange. The
Yaqui River supports the most diverse populations of C. ornatum, with several events of dispersal and isolation
within the basin. Based on our genetic results, we defined three ESUs within C. ornatum as a first attempt to
promote the conservation of the evolutionary processes determining the genetic diversity of this species. They will
likely be revealed as a valuable tool for freshwater conservation policies in northwest Mexico, where many
environmental problems concerning the use of water have rapidly arisen in recent decades.

Background
The relative role of geology and ecology in driving
lineage differentiation, and ultimately speciation, has
been an important topic in evolutionary biology since
the 19 th century. At present, it is a thriving field of
research aiming to disentangle the relative importance
of glacial refugia, extrinsic environmental factors and
species interactions, aided to the ability of locating
species boundaries, phylogeographical breaks and
hybrid zones [1].
Montane ecosystems are areas of high endemism, and
the mechanisms driving this endemicity have been
receiving increasing attention. For instance, endemism
in tectonically active regions should reflect cladogenesis
within the montane region, rather than the contraction
of geographic range from a much larger region ([2], but
see also [3]). Additionally, climatic factors have been
rejected as the only explanation for the species richness
of taxa within small to medium-sized geographic ranges;
thus, both geological and evolutionary processes must
be considered [4]. Molecular studies of montane Mexican taxa often revealed complex phylogeographical patterns, and those high levels of genetic divergence
suggest an underestimation of the level of endemism in
the Mexican highlands, implying that more surveys in
other co-distributed taxa are needed to achieve a better
understanding of the evolutionary drivers of diversification in these regions [5].
What is clear at the present time is that the evolutionary history of many Meso- and North American taxa is
linked to the severe geological (tectonic and volcanic)
and environmental changes that occurred during the
Neogene and Quaternary periods [3,6,7]. The challenge
now is to distinguish the relative contribution of each
factor to the observed phylogeographic pattern. The
number of studies that have been conducted in the
Mexican endemic-rich area of the northern sierras is
lower than the number of studies of the Trans-Mexican
Volcanic Belt (TMVB) (e.g., [8]). Therefore, one of the
main contributions of the present work is to investigate
the biogeographic role of the Sierra Madre Occidental
(SMOC) using an endemic freshwater species. The
SMOC may have acted as either a barrier where current
admixture of lineages can occur, as a corridor for range
expansion or as a centre of diversification, promoting
allopatric differentiation.
Biogeographic role of the Sierra Madre Occidental

The SMOC is a large volcanic plateau in western Mexico that extends parallel to the Pacific coastline for
more that 1200 km from the US-Mexico border (31°
N) to the TMVB (21° N). The topography of the
northern Sierra Madre is characterised by a high

Page 2 of 20

average elevation (1909 m). In contrast to other North
American mountain systems, the topographic relief of
the SMOC is not the product of elevated mountain
ranges, but rather of incised canyons. The western
edge is quite steep, while the eastern topographic gradients from the Sierra Madre into the central Mexican
Plateau are relatively smooth [9].
The SMOC is thought to form an important corridor
of dispersal for tropical flora and fauna moving in
response to climatic change [10,11]. This mountain system is one of the 14 biogeographic provinces of Mexico
and one of the five biogeographic provinces of the socalled Mexican Transition Zone, mainly defined by the
plant and animal taxa that are found above 1000 m.
This province has the highest Nearctic influence [11].
The SMOC is the result of Cretaceous-Cenozoic
magmatic and tectonic episodes related to the subduction of the Farallon plate beneath North America and
to the opening of the Gulf of California. During the
Oligocene, extensional tectonics (processes associated
with the stretching of the lithosphere) began in the
entire eastern half of the SMOC, migrating towards
the west during the Miocene [12]. The resulting postOligocene river capture has been inferred from geological data from the southern flank of the TepicZacoalco rift (southern SMOC), although more recent
piracy phenomena have been reported in other areas
([13] and references therein) or suggested by phylogeographic studies (e.g., [14]).
To the best of our knowledge, the phylogeography of
ichthyofauna endemic to the SMOC has not been thoroughly investigated, although population genetics surveys have been conducted for Oncorhynchus
chrysogaster ([15] and references therein) and Poeciliopsis sonorensis [16]. As pointed out by recent literature
[5], there are only a limited number of surveys on the
genetic structure of endemic species from the North
and Mesoamerican mountains (e.g., [17,18]).
We consider two alternative biogeographic scenarios.
Given the fact that the SMOC acts as a biogeographic
barrier for many taxa, a plausible first hypothesis would
be that the phylogeographic pattern of Campostoma
ornatum would result from the current admixture of
formerly West and East lowland lineages isolated during
the Pleistocene interglacial stages [19-22]. If so, we
would expect to find major lineages located on the
northwestern and southeastern slopes and an altitudinal
gradient of haplotype diversity. A second putative role
for the SMOC would be as a centre of diversification,
related to a working hypothesis of a highland distribution of C. ornatum predating the Quaternary ice ages.
Under such a scenario, deep genetic and morphological
divergences between the study species would have been

Domínguez-Domínguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:153

shaped by geological processes rather than by climatic
oscillations. Additionally, extensional tectonics causing
river piracy (a geomorphological phenomenon occurring
when a stream or river drainage system is diverted from
its own bed and connects with the one of a neighbouring stream) would cause a mismatch between the actual
conformation of river drainages and genetic patterns.
Study species

To study the biogeographic role of the SMOC on its
ichthyofauna, we selected the Mexican stoneroller, Campostoma ornatum, as our model organism. The Mexican
stoneroller is endemic to the central and northern sectors of the SMOC and its northern fringes (Madrean
Sky-Islands). It is found on both slopes of the SMOC: in
the Bravo and Conchos Rivers, as well as in the Casas
Grandes and Santa Clara (also known as El Carmen)

interior drainages and the upper parts of the Yaqui,
Mayo and Fuerte north-western Pacific River basins.
The southernmost basins where C. ornatum is present
are the interior Nazas and Aguanaval Rivers and the
Pacific Piaxtla River basin [23] (Figure 1).
The widespread distribution of C. ornatum is thought
have been shaped by tectonics (stream capture between
adjacent drainages) and climatic changes (dispersion via
periodically formed floodplains or the connection or
succession of pluvial lakes during glacial stages) [24]. Its
distribution area (the elevation range of the species is
800 - 2000 m a.s.l.) coincides with a biodiversity hotspot, the the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands [25].
Several cyprinid species for which deep intraspecific
genetic divergence has been previously reported exist in
large areas severely influenced by both tecto-volcanic
activity and climatic changes [26-28]. In fact, some of

those widespread species have been split into more than
one taxon, in light of their genetic divergence and morphological differentiation [14,29,30]. This was the case
for Campostoma anomalum, which was previously
regarded as a complex of three widespread and morphologically divergent subspecies, whose five distinct evolutionary lineages warranted species status [31,32]. The
species Campostoma ornatum, also with a wide distribution range and morphological variation, is also likely to
show deep intraspecific genetic differentiation because
populations from southern drainages (Nazas, Aguanaval
and Piaxtla rivers) show a differentiated morphotype
[24] and there is remarkable endemicity in the ichthyofauna of the Nazas river [33,34].
Conservation perspective

Phylogeography also has an applied perspective from the
conservation point of view. The genetic and morphological information obtained in the present work will be
examined to define, if appropriate, evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) within Campostoma ornatum. The
need to preserve the loss of Campostoma lineages
restricted to areas where aquatic biodiversity is imperilled was already highlighted [31]. In addition, the populations of the Mexican stoneroller in the USA declined
during the 20 th century [35] and there were plans to
perform reintroductions from Mexico [36].
At the present time, an ESU is essentially acknowledged to be a population or a group of populations that
merit the separate management or priority of conservation because it is highly distinctive, according to the following criteria: (i) reproductive isolation and adaptation,
(ii) reciprocal monophyly and (iii) “exchangeability” of
populations. Concordance across multiple data types (e.
g., genetic, morphological and geographic) is, of course,
desirable (revised by [37]). Defining conservation units
in endemic species may be of particular interest in densely populated countries, such as Mexico. This is
because environmental problems concerning the use of
water rapidly arise in semiarid regions, such as northwest Mexico [38,39], where the demand for water
resources has dramatically increased in recent decades
[40,41].
In the present study we aim to infer the evolutionary
history of C. ornatum throughout its distribution area in
order to determine the role of the SMOC on the evolutionary history of C. ornatum and to disentangle the
action of tecto-volcanic processes vs. climatic change.
To do this, we applied phylogenetic and population
genetic methods to sequence data obtained for a mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b, cytb) and two nuclear
fragments (RAG1 and S7) from 18 to 29 locations
within the distribution area of C. ornatum. In addition,
we included several meristic characters to first

corroborate the morphological variation pattern previously observed [24] and second to investigate the
putative association between genetic and phenotypic
data. In line with our main objective, we also addressed
the following question from the conservation perspective: do any of the populations/lineages sampled in different drainages deserve to be categorised as an (ESU)
under the Adaptive Evolutionary Conservation (AEC)
framework [42]?

Results
Genetic diversity

Sixty haplotypes were obtained by sequencing the cytb
gene in the 285 samples collected in the current study
(Table 1 and Figure 1). These haplotypes were defined
by 160 variable sites within a 1110-bp sequence fragment (total number of mutations = 169). Twenty-three
of those sites were singletons, and 137 substitutions
were parsimony informative. Twenty-two changes
involved amino acid replacements, and 147 were synonymous. Overall, haplotype diversity (h) was 0.964 ±
0.003 (standard deviation), nucleotide diversity (π) =
0.032 ± 0.001, the average number of nucleotide differences (k) = 35.041 and Tajima’s D = +0.895 (not significant) (Tables 2 and 3).
We sequenced the S7 nuclear gene in 56 specimens
from 19 locations, representing all surveyed river basins.
Twenty-eight of these individuals had between one and
seven heterozygous positions. After haplotype reconstruction, 24 variants were defined by 36 variable sites
(plus four indels) along the 843 bp of the final alignment (37 mutations in total). Two of the variable sites
were singletons, and 34 substitutions were parsimony
informative. Overall, haplotype diversity (h) was 0.862 ±
0.02, nucleotide diversity (π) = 0.008 ± 0.001, the average number of nucleotide differences (k) = 6.99 and
Tajima’s D = -0.066 (not significant). Fourteen sites
showed insertion/deletion variation. Indel polymorphism
was estimated in four indel events and haplotypes (average indel length event = 3.5, indel haplotype diversity =
0.169). When heterozygous positions are coded as
unknown but gaps are kept as the fifth state, the number of haplotypes decreases to 15, defined by 18 variable
sites (plus indels). Haplotype diversity (h) was reduced
to 0.632 ± 0.068, nucleotide diversity (π) = 0.0047 ±
0.0008, the average number of nucleotide differences (k)
= 3.84 and Tajima’s D = -0.0602 (not significant). Three
of the variable sites correspond to singletons, and 15
substitutions were parsimony informative.
The populations from Santa Clara (Santa Clara River
basin) and El Olote (Nazas River basin) were the most
diverse, as measured by the number of haplotypes, gene
diversity and allelic richness (Table 2). Seven populations, scattered along the Fuerte, Mayo, Nazas, Yaqui

and Conchos basins, contained only one haplotype
(Table 2). Divergent haplotypes were found in Cabullona
(CAB) and Agua Prieta (PRI), both in the Yaqui River
basin, as shown by the number of segregating sites (S)
and average number of nucleotide differences (k)
(Table 2). The possibility of admixture of lineages led us
to increase the number of sequenced individuals at
these two sites to 15 and 17, respectively. When genetic
diversity parameters were calculated according to the
phylogroups indicated by the 95% SP unconnected
subnetworks (see below), phylogroups VI (Yaqui, San
Bernardino and Mayo River locations) and VIII (Nazas,
Aguanaval and Piaxtla River locations) were the most
diverse, whereas phylogroup V (Cabullona and San Bernardino River locations) was the least diverse (Table 3).

Twenty-two of the 43 individuals for which the RAG1
nuclear gene was sequenced had between one and three
heterozygotic positions. After haplotype reconstruction,
12 variants were defined by 12 variable sites along the
979 bp of the final alignment (total number of mutations = 12). No gaps were found. Overall, haplotype
diversity (h) was 0.847 ± 0.021, nucleotide diversity (π)
= 0.00228 ± 0.00014, the average number of nucleotide
differences (k) = 2.23 and Tajima’s D = -0.166 (not
significant). One variable site was a singleton and 11
substitutions were parsimony informative. Eight substitutions corresponded to synonymous changes, with the
other four implicating amino acid replacements. If heterozygous positions were coded as unknown, six haplotypes were obtained for the 44 individuals mentioned

above. These haplotypes were defined by six variable
sites (total number of mutations = 6). Two of these sites
were singletons, and the remaining four substitutions
were parsimony informative. Two changes involved
amino acid replacement, and four were synonymous.
Overall, haplotype diversity (h) was 0.568 ± 0.077 (standard deviation), nucleotide diversity (π) = 0.00087 ±

Phylogenetic reconstruction

Phylogenetic hypotheses based on cytb (Figure 2) and S7
(not shown) recovered two highly supported main
clades. The first group included the Atlantic drainage of
Conchos, the interior drainages of Santa Clara, Casas
Grandes and the western Pacific drainages Yaqui,
Fuerte, Sonora and Mayo. A second clade clustered the
southern populations of C. ornatum: the interior drainage of Nazas and Aguanaval Rivers as well as the Piaxtla basin (Figure 2). However, the phylogenetic tree
based on RAG1 (not shown) did not reveal such a
monophyletic group for this “southern” group of populations, even after several other North American cyprinids were used as outgroups.
Within the northern lineage, several incongruities
were present among the three loci. The nuclear loci

Page 8 of 20

showed a large basal polytomy for all groups, as
expected for fewer variable markers. The better resolved
mitochondrial topology (Figure 2), largely congruent
with all of the analyses conducted (NJ, BI and ML),
showed a large polytomy forming three groups: one
included populations within the Yaqui and Sonora drainages; a second group comprised populations within the
Conchos, Fuerte and Santa Clara drainages; and a third
group was formed by populations within Yaqui and
Casas Grandes drainages. This pattern did not recover
the geographic pattern of the drainages, as only the
Santa Clara River drainage conformed to a monophyletic
group. All of the other drainages showed mixed haplotypes (Figure 2), and the southern population showed
mixed haplotypes between drainages.
Applying the 95% statistical parsimony (SP) criterion
to the mitochondrial dataset results in eight unconnected subnetworks (Figure 3). Haplotypes differing by
up to 14 mutations could be connected, with 95% confidence that multiple substitutions did not occur at any
particular nucleotide position. Overall, subnetwork VIII
(Nazas-Aguanaval-Piaxtla River basins) was the most
differentiated, as revealed by the fact that it remained
unconnected from the other seven subnetworks until a
step limit of 50 was enforced. Overall, haplotype
CUA6707, from subnetwork VIII, was the most basal, as
it has the fewest number of substitutions, when compared to the root (Campostoma oligolepis).
Most of the subnetworks were composed of haplotypes found in more than one drainage; only Santa
Clara (CLA) (subnetwork IV) and Ojo de Agua (OJO)
(within the Sonora basin; subnetwork II) contained private haplotypes not shared with any other subnetwork
or basin (Figure 3). Although subnetworks III and V
were composed of haplotypes found in only one basin
(Conchos and Yaqui), haplotypes from Conchos also
appeared in subnetwork I, whereas haplotypes from
Yaqui were also present in subnetworks VI and VII
(Figure 3). We found that haplotypes from the
Tomochic and Papigochic sites (subnetwork VI)
grouped in a star-like shape, as did haplotypes from the
Casas Grandes (GRA) and Ignacio Zaragoza (ZAR)
populations (within subnetwork VII).
Several divergent lineages were found in two particular
locations: some haplotypes from Cabullona (CAB) and
Agua Prieta (PRI) (both in the Yaqui River basin)
formed subnetwork V, whereas other haplotypes from
CAB and PRI were connected to different river basins
(Mayo from subnetwork VI, Casas Grandes from subnetwork VII). This points to a distinct evolutionary history for each of those mtDNA lineages currently
sympatric within the Yaqui River basin.
As a conservative measure, we calculated the 95% SP
network for the S7 nuclear gene considering the

request). Differentiation of the Nazas-Aguanaval-Piaxtla

River basin (Figure 4) was clearly revealed in both cases
(subnetwork 2 and 2’), as individuals from these sites
formed one of the two unconnected subnetworks (connection limit = 12). Subnetworks 1 and 1’ (Figure 4)
were formed by four major groups of haplotypes: Santa

reflects the frequency of each haplotype. Solid lines connecting each pair of haplotypes represent a single mutational event, regardless of their

Clara, Sonora, Conchos-Fuerte and Yaqui-Casas
Grandes-Mayo. Within this subnetwork, Santa Clara
was the most differentiated haplogroup, separated by
five mutational steps with respect to the BAS haplotype
(Mayo basin). These results held regardless of whether
gaps were considered as a fifth state.
The differentiation of the Nazas-Aguanaval River basin
was also clearly revealed by the 95% SP network calculated for the RAG1 marker. However, it must be noted
that Santa Clara displayed a similar extent of divergence
with one intermediate haplotype (Figure 5). Again,
sequences of inferred alleles used to calculate Figure 5b
are available from the authors upon request.
The estimated age of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the northern and southern lineages
was 3.9 Mya (2.1-5.9). The diversification events within

the main northern lineage were dated back to the Lower
Pleistocene (Figure 2).
Morphology

Morphological character values registered in the present
study are consistent with the variation pattern obtained
by prior literature [24] throughout the range of
C. ornatum, particularly the counts in lateral line (LLS),
predorsal (PrDS) and the circumferential scales (CircS).
The most significant result is the distinction between
the southern (mitochondrial phylogroup VIII) and
northern (I-VII phylogroups) lineages, as revealed by
54-71 LLS (usually 65-66) vs 62-81 (usually 69-72), 2532 PrDS (usually 27-29) vs 29-40 (usually 31-34) and
44-55 CircS (usually 48) vs 50-61 (usually 52-55)
(Figure 1 and Additional file 1). Despite the high inter-

drainage and inter-population variation recorded, this
morphological pattern supports the deep genetic divergence between the Nazas-Aguanaval-Piaxtla basins and
the northern drainages (Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5). In contrast, morphological variation within northern group
was not congruent with the genetic phylogenies inferred.
For instance, specimens from Santa Clara basin (lineage
IV) are clearly differentiated from the other northern
drainages, regardless of the surveyed genetic marker
(Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5). However, their morphological
variation appeared overlapped with regard to other
lineages within the northern group, e.g., the three surveyed variables fall within the range found for Conchos
drainage (Additional file 1).
Population genetics

Most of the total variation can be explained by the divergence between sampling sites (AMOVA, FST = 0.92, p <
0.001 under the Tamura-Nei model; FST = 0.58, p < 0.001
if only haplotype frequencies are considered) (Table 4).

FST-values were all significant when pairwise comparisons
between each phylogroup and between each river basin
were tested (Additional files 2 and 3). Additionally, there
was a high degree of distinctiveness between locations
across river basins as revealed by significant pairwise FST
-values [e.g., F ST = 1 between CON-BCY (MayoConchos), CON-COV (Mayo-Nazas), CON-HUA (MayoYaqui) and BCY-HUA (Conchos-Yaqui)]. Congruently,
most of the non-significant values corresponded to intrabasin comparisons [e.g., CON-BAS (Mayo), COR-OCA
(Conchos), HON-HUA (Yaqui) and OLO-ATO (Nazas)],
but some locations belonging in different drainages also
had FST-values that were not significant [e.g., BCY-URI
(Fuerte and Conchos, respectively) and BAS-CON (Mayo
and Yaqui, respectively) (Additional file 4)]. Drainage into
the Atlantic (the Conchos-Bravo River basin) or to the
Pacific Ocean (the remaining river basins) explained much
of the genetic variance.
Samples from the Piaxtla, Aguanaval and Nazas River
basins clustered together and were clearly separated

Figure 5 Statistical parsimony (95%) network for Campostoma ornatum RAG1 nuclear gene haplotypes. Statistical parsimony (95%)
networks of 44 individuals of Campostoma ornatum sequenced for the nuclear gene RAG1. Networks were calculated (a) by treating
heterozygous variable sites as unknown data and (b) using reconstructed haplotypes for each allele. Circle size reflects the frequency of each
haplotype. Solid lines connecting each pair of haplotypes represent a single mutational event, regardless of their length. Small black rectangles

from the other localities at the lowest K-value used for
SAMOVA. The population groupings resulting from
this analysis at different K values closely match the genealogical relationships among haplotypes (Figure 6). We
selected K = 4 and K = 13 as the best groupings, as
revealed by the patterns obtained. The clearest rise in
FCT values was observed for K = 4, which mostly coincided with major lineages obtained in the phylogenetic
trees [(Piaxtla+Nazas) (Conchos+Santa Clara+Fuerte)
(Yaqui1(Cab, Pap, Pri, Tau, Ter, Tom)+Mayo+Sonora)
(Casas Grandes + Yaqui2(Hon, Hua))]. The FST-values
for the K = 4 arrangement were all significant, with the
highest value resulting from the comparison of NazasAguanaval-Piaxtla with Yaqui2-Casas Grandes (Additional file 5), whereas the largest decrease in FSC was
observed when K = 13. FCT values reached the plateau
after K = 13 (Figure 6). This partition of the data

revealed different lineages within the Yaqui, Conchos
and Nazas River basins, i.e., [(Casas Grandes+Yaqui2
(Hon, Hua))] [Nazas1(Cov, Pby)] [Mayo+Yaqui1(Tau)]
[Nazas2(Ato, Olo)] [Piaxtla] [Conchos1(Por, Sat)] [Conchos2(Cor, Oca, Rip)] [Santa Clara] [Nazas3(Cua)]
[Yaqui3(Pap, Ter, Tom)] [Yaqui4(Cab, Pri)] [Conchos3
(Bcy) +Fuerte] [Sonora]. The FST-values for the K = 13
arrangement were all significant for the comparisons
involving Nazas 1 (the Cov and Pby populations) and all
other populations, including the Piaxtla River samples
(Additional file 6).
Therefore, we analysed the demographic history of
mtDNA lineages (i.e., phylogroups in 95% SP unconnected subnetworks), rather than sampling sites or
SAMOVA groupings. This way, we could infer which
lineages had experienced expansions, instead of trying to
infer demographic expansions in the contemporary

Neutrality tests applied to each phylogroup revealed no
deviations from neutrality due to population expansion.
The only lineage with Fs and R2 statistics close to significance was the one composed of subnetwork V (containing some of the individuals from CAB and PRI, Yaqui
River basin) (Table 3). The mismatch distribution analysis for this phylogroup was consistent with the sudden
expansion model (SDD = 0.04, p = 0.16; raggedness

showed a unimodal distribution that closely fit the
expected distribution (data not shown).

Discussion
Our genetic and morphological results unambiguously
showed two well-differentiated evolutionary groups
within C. ornatum, supporting prior preliminary investigations [24]. The first lineage is located in the northern
river drainages (Yaqui, Mayo, Fuerte, Sonora, Casas
Grandes, Santa Clara and Conchos), whereas the other

increment of FCT was the largest (ΔFCT = 0.06) and (ii) 13 groups, when the decrease of FCT was maximum (ΔFCT = - 0.26).

lineage occurs in the southernmost drainages of the species’ area of distribution (Nazas, Aguanaval and Piaxtla;
central SMOC). The large number of mutation steps
between the two lineages exceeded the 95% parsimony
limits for the cytb and S7 genes, a result indicative of a
long history of isolation between these clades. Such an
allopatric fragmentation dated back to the Pliocene (3.9
Mya, CI = 2.1-5.9), as revealed by the Bayesian coalescent
analyses. The absence of a sharp differentiation between
the western (Pacific drainages) and eastern (Atlantic or
endorheic basins) lineages, together with the lack of an
altitudinal gradient of haplotype diversity (data not
shown) lead us to discard a recent (Upper Quaternary)
origin for the observed phylogeographic pattern.
In the light of this, and following the proposal of distinguishing between competing models of diversification
for North and Mesoamerica [43], we can emphasise
tecto-volcanic processes as the crucial factors influencing the evolutionary history of C. ornatum, rather than
recent habitat fluctuations caused, for instance, by alternating glacial/interglacial stages. The genetic pattern we
observed allowed us to infer common river piracy
phenomena.
Southern group

The most plausible biogeographic scenario for the
separation of northern and southern groups (mean
divergences P = 5.2%) is an early Pliocene vicariant
event that split a widespread common ancestor. According to our dating, the allopatric fragmentation between
the northern and southern lineages took place around
3.9 Mya (CI = 2.2-5.9). This scenario is also supported
by the high genetic diversity found in phylogroup
V (Naza-Aguanaval-Piaxtla) (Table 3), which is congruent with a high number of female founders followed by
long term population stability. Observations from the
southern lineage specimens examined in the present
study (Nazas and Piaxtla) are in agreement with prior
findings [24], as they showed a differentiated morphotype distinguished by higher counts in the lateral,
predorsal and circumferential scales, as well as a deeper
body. Such a genetic and morphologic differentiation
warrants a taxonomic revision likely involving the
description of a different taxonomic entity (Figure 2).
The existence of an ancient paleosystem related to the
Nazas River has been put forward in prior literature in
light of the distribution of its ichthyofauna and herpetofauna [44-46]. Numerous fish species are endemic to the
Nazas River [33], which may be indicative of a independent evolutionary history of those species in isolation.
Recent molecular surveys also support the existence of
an ancient isolation of the Conchos River system and
the Nazas, Aguanaval, Mezquital Rivers, a vicariant

Page 14 of 20

event that has been dated to ca. 5 Mya based on the
divergence between the two groups of the genus
Cyprinodon (Actinopterygii, Ciprinodontiformes) [47].
The ancient connection and disruption of the Nazas
palaeosystem with the Conchos River is well supported
by the distribution of conspecific species in the Gila,
Cyprinella, Ictiobus and Cyprinodon genera [23,48-50].
Thus, to the best of our knowledge, the presence of C.
ornatum in the Aguanaval and Piaxtla Rivers is caused
by a recent dispersal event from Nazas River, as revealed
by the phylogenetic trees, the cytb network and F ST
results. This hypothesis is also in agreement with the
biogeographic scenario postulated for semi-aquatic
snakes of the genus Thamnophis [46].
Northern lineage genetic structure and demography

A complex, reticulate biogeographic history in time and
space emerged within the northern C. ornatum populations, following a clear pattern of taxon pulse episodes
[51]. This model assumes that species and their adaptations arise in “centres of diversification” and that distributional ranges of taxa periodically fluctuate around a
more stable, continuously occupied centre. This general
biotic dispersal may be interrupted by the formation of
barriers, producing episodes of vicariant speciation.
Breakdown of those barriers produces new episodes of
biotic expansion, setting the stage for yet more episodes
of vicariance [52]. At this point, it is worth noting the
dispersal ability of our model species. We assumed the
Mexican stoneroller to be a sedentary species. Its limited
active dispersal may putatively be enhanced by environmental factors, such as predation or abiotic change, as
has been described for other congeneric species [53,54].
Fuerte and Conchos

Although the Fuerte and Conchos River populations
form a well-differentiated group (P = 2.3% ± 0.4%
between Conchos and Fuerte Rivers populations, excluding the BCY and URI populations), pointing to a long
evolutionary history in isolation (ca. 1.7 Mya, CI = 0.82.9, Figure 2), a recent dispersal event from the Fuerte
to Conchos River systems is evident. We base this argument on four lines of evidence: (i) the Urique population (URI, Fuerte basin) shares a haplotype with the
Bocoyna population (BCY, Conchos River) (Figure 3),
(ii) both locationns have non-significant FST values, (iii)
the position of the URI population in the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 2) and (iv) the concordance of the pattern
in mitochondrial subnetwork I with the hypothesis of
recent (post-glacial) divergence [55]. The close proximity between the headwaters of Conchos and Fuerte
River basins makes highly likely the occurrence of a
stream capture event between them, as suggested by
[24]. Other species co-distributed between these basins,

All markers revealed that the Santa Clara population is
the most divergent (mean divergence p = 2.9%). This
result disagrees with the existence of the hypothesised
ancient pluvial Lake Palomas [56,57], which would have
covered much of the Guzman Basin systems and would
have become fragmented into a series of isolated, endorheic rivers, lakes and springs during the Upper Quaternary (ca. 200 000 years ago). This event would have
formed the current Guzman basin, which include the
Mimbres, Casas Grandes, Santa Maria and Santa Clara
River endorheic basins [58]. Our molecular dating
showed more ancient episodes of isolation for both the
Santa Clara (ca. 2.1 Mya (CI = 1-3.7)) and the Casas
Grandes (isolated about 1.5 Mya (CI = 0.4-2.8)) populations (Figure 2). Moreover, the latter was more closely
related to samples from the Bavispe River sub-basin
(Yaqui River Drainage) than to samples from Santa
Clara.
The close relationship between the fish fauna from the
Yaqui tributaries and the Casas Grandes system can be
attributed to an episode of dispersal from the Casas
Grandes to the Yaqui River. This hypothesis is supported by the position of the Yaqui River samples
(HON, CAV, HUA and PRI) in the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 2) and network (Figure 3), as well as by their
low genetic diversity. Such a connection/dispersal event
between Yaqui and Casas Grandes is also supported by
(i) the occurrence of other co-distributed species (such
as Cyprinella formosa [58]) and (ii) the finding of very
closely related species in each of those river basins (e.g.,
Cyprinodon pisteri and Cyprinodon albivelis, formerly
considered the same species [59,60], occur at Casas
Grandes and Yaqui, respectively [61]).

average number of differences (Table 3). In light of this,
we suggest a dispersal event from the Yaqui to the
Mayo River, an event supported by the position of the
Mayo populations (BAS and CON) in the phylogenetic
tree. Moreover, the La Tauna population (TAU, within
Yaqui River) shares a haplotype with the Concheño
(CON) and Basaseachic (BAS) populations, both from
the Mayo River, and also shows a non-significant pairwise FST value, which may be indicative of recent gene
flow. Faunal exchanges between the Yaqui River and
surrounding areas have been previously reported [15,62].
In fact, it has been argued that dispersal between the
Yaqui and its contiguous basins was, putatively, a reason
for the high fish biodiversity in the Yaqui River [23].
The Yaqui River system hosts three divergent haplogroups (subnetworks V, VI and VII) that occur in
sympatry at the Cabullona and Agua Prieta locations
(both belonging to Agua Prieta stream, an upper tributary of the Bavispe sub-basin). One of those haplogroups
clusters with haplotypes found in the Casas Grandes
River forming subnetwork VII. Haplotype cab7845 falls
within the second haplogroup (subnetwork VI), closely
related with haplotypes form the Tomochic and Papigochic sites (Yaqui River). The third lineage (subnetwork V) is composed by only two haplotypes and shows
a mean genetic divergence of P = 1.5%, also suggesting
a relatively long isolation. Interestingly, the Terapa
population (TER), also belonging to the Yaqui River
basin, shows a high amount of divergence with respect
to other Yaqui populations (P = 1.3%). These results
are, again, congruent with episodes of isolation in different tributaries of the Yaqui River, followed by a secondary dispersal from some isolated demes to other Yaqui
tributaries. We postulate this hypothesis as the most
likely explanation for the presence of those three divergent mitochondrial lineages at Cabullona and Agua
Prieta.

Yaqui basin

Sonora basin

Thus far, the Yaqui River supports the most diverse C.
ornatum populations. Haplotypes found in this northern
basin are found in three different mitochondrial subnetworks (including subnetwork VII, as previously
explained) (Figure 3) and their supported clades (Figure
2), which was confirmed by the nuclear dataset. Subnetworks V and VI are mainly composed by haplotypes
occurring at the Yaqui tributaries and diverged from the
other clades around 3 Mya (CI = 1.5-4.9) (Figure 2).
This indicates an initial and ancient vicariant event
between the Yaqui River and its contiguous basins
(Mayo, Sonora and Casas Grandes), followed by episodes of dispersal and subsequent isolation.
Concerning descriptors of genetic diversity, the mitochondrial subnetwork VI had the greatest number of
haplotypes, segregating sites, haplotype diversity and

Haplotypes from the Ojo de Agua (OJO) site, a small
spring located at the Sonora River Basin, belong to a
separated subnetwork (II) and show large genetic distances (P = 2.1% ± 0.3%) with other members of its
monophyletic group (Figure 2). This may be indicative
of relatively long period of isolation, starting around 1.2
Mya (CI = 0.4-2.2). In addition, the low values of genetic
diversity reported for these samples could be caused by
a reduction in effective population size, as is expected
due to the small size of the sampled area.

such as Codoma ornata, Gila pulchra and Catostomus
plebeius [23], may have experienced the same dispersal
event.
Guzman endorheic basin

Implications for conservation and taxonomy

In the light of our genetic and morphologic results, we
hereby define three ESUs (sensu [42]) within C. ornatum
corresponding to the following groups: (i) the southern
lineage, (ii) the northern lineage and (iii) the Yaqui river

Domínguez-Domínguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:153
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/153

basin. While acknowledging that the Yaqui belongs to
the northern lineage, we define this third sub-hierarchical ESU due to the existence of three deeply divergent
lineages at Agua Prieta. Here, the term sub-hierarchical
does not infer subordination but rather a frame of reference on a phylogenetic continuum [42]. At present, only
two of the sampled localities are currently protected by
Mexican legislation (Urique and Huachinera), although
the BAS sampling site is close to the Basaseachic Falls
National Park. Therefore, the definition of these three
ESUs shall promote the conservation of the evolutionary
processes shaping the genetic pattern of C. ornatum
throughout its range.

Conclusion
We found populations of C. ornatum with a complex,
reticulate biogeographic history with repeated events of
isolation and dispersal, which is consistent with the
taxon pulse theory. This complex history could be
related to the dynamic tecto-volcanic activity that has
occurred in the region since the early Pliocene. Both
genetics and morphology revealed a strong differentiation between the southern and northern populations of
C. ornatum. In light of this, a taxonomic revision is
necessary to clarify the taxonomic status of the two
well-differentiated groups within Campostoma ornatum.
The differentiation between the northern and southern
taxa was likely due to the isolation of the paleosystem
that connected the Nazas with other northern river
basins during the Pliocene. In addition, we determined
the presence of three very divergent mitochondrial
lineages occurring concurrently in the northern Agua
Prieta Stream (Yaqui river basin). We postulated that
episodes of isolation and the subsequent admixture of
lineages from different sources could explain the cooccurrence of these lineages at Yaqui. In addition, three
ESUs are proposed that cover the full range of the Mexican stoneroller. The pattern obtained for Campostoma
ornatum paves the way for a future comparative phylogeographical study aimed at disentangling the evolutionary factors that shape the genetic structure of this
species and its populations in the northwest of Mexico.
Methods
Specimen collection and laboratory procedures

A total of 285 Camposoma ornatum individuals were
collected at 29 locations in northwest Mexico (Figure 1).
Between 3 and 17 specimens were analysed per location
(Table 1). Organisms were caught using a seine net and
electrofishing. A small sample of tissue from the caudal
fin from each fish was cut and preserved in 96% ethanol
and stored in the laboratory at -20°C prior to analysis.
Voucher specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and preserved in 70% ethanol and deposited in the Colección de

Page 16 of 20

Peces de la Universidad Michoacana (CPUM) (Table 1).
To confirm the taxonomic identity of C. ornatum, morphological examination was performed following [24], i.
e., using the three most informative meristic characters:
(i) number of lateral line scales, (ii) number of predorsal
scales and (iii) number of circumferential scales. We
analysed ten specimens corresponding to, at least, one
population from each major drainage, except for Aguanaval and Mayo (Additional file 1).
Genomic DNA was extracted from a <0.25 cm2 piece
of the pectoral fin using the High Pure™ PCR Template
Preparation Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
We amplified a 1140-bp fragment of the mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene (cytb) in 285 individuals by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and the GLUf - THRr primer
pair [63].
Amplifications were performed in 30-μL reaction
volumes containing 1× PCR buffer (5PRIME), 1 U Taq
DNA polymerase (5PRIME), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2
μM of each primer and 50-100 ng of DNA. Similar conditions were employed to amplify the first intron of the
S7 ribosomal protein gene in 56 specimens (1000 bp,
primers S7RPEX1F and S7RPEX2R [64]) and approximately 1400 bp of the recombinant activation gene 1
(RAG1) in 43 samples (primers RAG1F1 and RAG1R1
[65]).
PCR for cytb started with an initial denaturing step at
95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35 amplification cycles
at 94°C for 1 minute, 56°C for 1.5 minutes, 65°C for 1
minute and a final extension step at 65°C for 7 minutes.
PCR for S7 started with an initial denaturing step at 95°
C for 2 minutes, followed by 30 amplification cycles at
95°C for 1 minute, 59.5°C for 1.5 minutes, 65°C for 2
minutes and a final extension step at 65°C for 7 minutes. PCR for RAG1 started with an initial denaturing
step at 94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 40 amplification
cycles at 94°C for 45 seconds, 56-58°C for 1 minute, 68°
C for 2 minutes and a final extension step at 68°C for 7
minutes.
PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose
gels and visualised under UV light after ethidium bromide staining. Cytb PCR products were purified and
bidirectionally sequenced at the DNA Sequencing Service (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). S7 and RAG1 PCR products were purified and bidirectionally sequenced on a
3130 × l Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, ABI) at
SAI (Sequencing Facility, University of A Coruña,
Spain). New sequences were deposited in GenBank
(Table 1).
Alignment and diversity analyses

DNA electropherograms were checked and aligned
using CODONCODES 3.5.6 (CodonCode Corporation,

Domínguez-Domínguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:153
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/153

Dedham, Massachusetts). Mitochondrial alignments
were straightforward. Apart from the 285 individuals
sequenced for the present work, phylogenetic analyses
included three Campostoma ornatum cytb sequences
available in public databases for (accession numbers
EU082476, DQ324062 and FJ913814). For phylogenetic
analyses, RAG1 alignments included sequence
EU082549 from Durango (Nazas River basin). Mitochondrial alignments were straightforward and unambiguous. For the analysis of nuclear DNA, the sites
where individuals contained heterozygous genotypes for
the sampled nuclear loci and any heterozygous base pair
positions were coded using standard degeneracy codes
[66]. Heterozygous sites in S7 and RAG1 sequences
were resolved to two haplotypes per individual using the
PHASE feature of DNAsp v.5.1 [67], which uses the
algorithms from PHASE 2.1.1 [68]. We employed the
recombination model (MR0), setting the output probability for both genotypes and haplotypes to 0.95. Following [69], runs consisted of 500 iterations as burn-in,
500 main iterations and a thinning interval = 1.
Haplotypes and their frequencies, standard indices of
genetic variation such as the number of segregating sites
(S), nucleotide diversity per gene (π), haplotype diversity
(h) and the average number of nucleotide differences (k)
were calculated using DNAsp 5.1 [67]. Allelic richness
(R) was computed after rarefaction to three individuals
[70] using CONTRIB (available at http://www.pierroton.
inra.fr/genetics/labo/Software/) for all populations that
included at least three individuals.
Phylogenetic analyses

As DNA variation may arise through different molecular evolution models, we ran jMODELTEST 0.1.1 [71]
to select the one that best matched our three datasets
following Akaike’s criterion: for the cytb gene, we
obtained the General Time Reversible model with a
gamma distribution shaped with a = 0.175, F81 for S7
and K80+I for RAG1. These models were used to estimate the phylogenetic relationships between all populations of C. ornatum based on the mitochondrial cytb
gene and the S7 and RAG1 nuclear genes. Phylogenetic
trees were calculated using the neighbour-joining (NJ),
Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML)
methods. Distance analysis was carried out as implemented in PAUP *4.0b10 [72] for 1000 bootstrap replicates. BI was performed in MrBayes [73], and two
independent analyses of four MCMC were run with
9,000,000 and 5,000,000 generations for mitochondrial
and nuclear loci, respectively, sampling every 100 generations. Once the convergence and stationarity were
verified by a suitable effective sample size (ESS) for all
parameters in Tracer v.1.4.1 [74], “burn in” consisting
in removing the first 10% of generations was

Page 17 of 20

performed and posterior probabilities were obtained
from a majority-rule consensus. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogeny was inferred using PhyML 3.0
[75] using the subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR)
tree searching option. Branch support was assessed
after 1000 bootstrap replicates as well as with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like (SH) procedure implemented
in PhyML. We used Campostoma oligolepis (accession
number DQ324064) as an outgroup to root the
tree. Using sequences from Campostoma pullum
(EU082477) or Campostoma pauciradii (DQ324065) as
outgroup did not significantly change any of the results
shown in the present study.
The phylogeny of the haplotypes was also inferred
using the statistical parsimony (SP) criterion [76]. The
95% SP network was calculated using TCS 1.2 [77]. As
several unconnected networks were obtained, we then
forced the TCS algorithm to connect all subnetworks
with a fixed connection limit of 50 steps. To have a
reference to calibrate the extent of divergence between
haplogroups, we rooted the resulting network with a
homologous sequence from Campostoma pauciradii
(DQ324065) by forcing a connection limit of 130 steps.
Similarly, 95% SP networks were calculated for S7 and
RAG1 datasets, both using only homozygous positions
(i.e., heterozygous coded as unknown) and the separated
haplotypes inferred by PHASE.
Molecular Clock

We estimated divergence times among sets of mitochondrial sequences and their associated credibility
intervals using the Bayesian coalescent approach as
implemented in BEAST 1.4.6 [78]. Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) simulations were run with the following
specifications: the GTR model of evolution, uncorrelated
lognormal distribution, the Yule tree process as a prior
and a branch length substitution rate sampled from a
prior normal distribution (mean value = 0.010, standard
deviation = 0.001). All simulations were run for 50 million generations, sampling chains every 1000 generations. Because of the lack of an appropriate fossil record
for the genus Campostoma, we applied a rate of molecular evolution of 1.05% per million years, calibrated for
the cytb in North American Phoxinini [79] and widely
applied to cyprinids [14,80]. The results of three independent runs (with an UPGMA starting tree) were
loaded and combined in TRACER 1.5 [74] to check for
convergence on a stationary distribution, determine
burn-in and assess effective sample size (ESS) and frequency plots of the relevant parameters. Ten percent of
the trees were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining
ones were combined in the BEAST module LogCombiner 1.4.6. Lastly, the BEAST module TreeAnnotator
1.4.6 was used to calculate the timescale.

Population genetics

We tested for evidence of population subdivision under
different criteria using an analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA) as implemented in ARLEQUIN v.3.5.1.2 [81].
We also used ARLEQUIN to test for genetic differentiation between pairs of populations using FST analogues
(FST) based on the Tamura-Nei model of sequence evolution. Statistical significance of covariance components
(and F-statistics) from AMOVAs and pairwise F ST
values was determined on the basis of the distribution
of values obtained from 1000 permutations of the data.
We also assessed population structuring using the
simulated annealing procedure as implemented in
SAMOVA (Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variance) 1.0
[82]. We used 100 simulated annealing processes for k
values from 2 to 29.
Demographic history

The demographic history of the cytb phylogroups was
first explored using Fu’s Fs [83] and R2 [84] statistics.
Their significance was assessed through the 95% confidence interval after 1000 coalescent simulations that
were conditional on the number of segregating sites, as
implemented in DNAsp.
We characterised the demographic expansions
detected for all phylogroups, rejecting the null hypothesis under the Fs and R2 tests with the mismatch distribution of the pairwise genetic differences [85], as
implemented in ARLEQUIN. Goodness-of-fit to a sudden expansion model was tested using parametric bootstrap approaches (1000 replicates). The sum of squared
deviations (SSD) between the observed and expected
mismatch distributions was used to assess the significance of the test.
