Abstract
Background: Many properties of organisms show great robustness against genetic and
environmental perturbations. The terms canalization and developmental stability were originally
proposed to describe the ability of an organism to resist perturbations and to produce a predictable
target phenotype regardless of random developmental noise. However, the extent to which
canalization and developmental stability are controlled by the same set of genes and share
underlying regulatory mechanisms is largely unresolved.
Results: We have analyzed the effects of clinal genetic variation (inversion polymorphism) on wing
asymmetry by applying the methods of geometric morphometrics in the context of quantitative
genetics using isochromosomal lines of Drosophila subobscura. For the analysis of overall size,
developmental stability was positively correlated with levels of heterozygosity and development at
the optimal temperature. For analyses of shape, the overall comparisons by matrix correlations
indicate that inter- and intraindividual variation levels were poorly correlated, a result also
supported when comparing the vectors describing patterns of variation of landmark position. The
lack of similarity was basically due to the discrepancy between the genetic and environmental
components of the interindividual variation. Finally, the analyses have also underscored the
presence of genetic variation for directional asymmetry.
Conclusions: The results strongly support the hypothesis that environmental canalization and
developmental stability share underlying regulatory mechanisms, but environmental and genetic
canalization are not functionally the same. A likely explanation for this lack of association is that
natural wing shape variation in Drosophila populations is loosely related to individual fitness.

Background
Phenotypic robustness refers to the invariance of the specified target phenotype given the genetic makeup and environmental conditions. Whereas the presence of naturally
occurring phenotypic variation is at the core of evolutionary biology, developmental geneticists have traditionally

considered it as a nuisance. Instead, they have relied on
the study of single or multiple mutant combinations to
reveal the generation of phenotypic patterns (e.g. [1]). A
resurgence of interest in the issue of phenotypic robustness has emerged in recent years, partly due to experimental results showing that many knock-out mutations have

little effect on phenotype ([2]; although Papp's et al. [3]
metabolic network analysis found that the majority of
genes that looked dispensable turn out to be such only
under laboratory conditions), and that developmental
systems show a high degree of stability with respect to perturbations [4,5].
Three major processes are involved in the control of phenotypic variability (the potential or propensity to vary, in
the terminology of Wagner and Altenberg [6]): canalization, developmental stability (DS), and plasticity [7]. As
first defined by Waddington [8] the term canalization
could be understood as a morphogenetic constrain [9],
where development appears to be buffered so that slight
abnormalities of genotype or slight perturbations in the
environment do not lead to the production of abnormal
phenotypes. However, evolutionary geneticists define
canalization as the tendency of traits to evolve a reduction
in variability [4,10]. DS can be defined as the ability of
organisms to buffer against the random noise that arises
spontaneously as a consequence of stochastic variation in
the cellular processes that are involved in the development of morphological structures [11]. Therefore, canalization and DS are subcategories of developmental
buffering: the first can be appraised by estimating interindividual variance whereas the most commonly used estimate of DS in bilaterally symmetrical organisms is
fluctuating asymmetry (FA); i.e. the intraindividual variation due to random differences between left and right
sides. The question of whether or not canalization and DS
are different buffering mechanisms has been a constant
source of debate. Two recent reviews implicitly [4] or
explicitly [10] assume that DS is a special case of canalization, a viewpoint also embraced by several authors (e.g.
[12-14]). Thus, by using geometric morphometrics Klingenberg and McIntyre [13] found that the vectors describing inter- and intraindividual variation of landmark
position for fly vein traits were highly concordant. On the
other hand, Debat et al. [15] came to the opposite conclusion applying the same methods to cranial landmarks in
the house mouse – although Klingenberg's et al. [16] work
with mouse mandibles found patterns of intra- and interindividual variation that were only partly consistent –. At
first glance, the different results may suggest that the
mechanisms that affect canalization and DS are related in
some developmental contexts but not in others. The problem is, however, that according to the causes of phenotypic variation a distinction between genetic and
environmental canalization is necessary [17,18]. Selection
for environmental canalization may produce genetic
canalization as a by-product [4,10], but this may not
always be the case.
The better way to address these contentious issues is to
rely on quantitative genetic analyses devised to partition

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/7

phenotypic variation into genetic and environmental
components [19]. Environmental variation can be further
2
partitioned into general ( σ E ) and special (micro) envi2
ronmental effects ( σ e ): the first refer to influential factors
(e.g. temperature) that are shared by groups of individuals, whereas the latter are residual deviations from the
phenotype that would be specified on the basis of genotype and general environmental effects. Such deviations
are unique to individuals and are largely unpredictable.
The variance associated with special environmental effects
can be estimated when experiments are performed on
completely inbred lines (i.e., there is no genetic variance).
In bilaterally symmetrical organisms it is also feasible to
estimate the two sources that contribute to those special
2
environmental effects: among-individual ( σ ea ) and
2
within-individual variance ( σ ew ). If the only real cause of
asymmetry is variation due to stochasticity in develop2
ment, then FA can be taken as an estimated of σ ew . Therefore, FA is only one source of the phenotypic variation
within environments (excluding environmentally
induced asymmetry), contrarily to the arguments in
2
Nijhout and Davidovitz [20]. The other source is σ ea .

The third process involved in the control of phenotypic
variability is plasticity, which can be defined as the ability
of an individual to express one phenotype under one set
of environmental circumstances and another phenotype
under another set. The expressed phenotypes can be discontinuous thus eliciting discrete morphs (i.e., polyphenism), or there can be a continuous range of potential
phenotypes (i.e., reaction norm). The reaction norm is
thus a property of the genome: genetic canalization and
phenotypic plasticity are not mutually exclusive and can
combine to form canalized reaction norms [7,17]. Plasticity is thus an alternative to genetic change allowing populations to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
To summarize, phenotypic plasticity increases the variance among groups of individuals that produce different
phenotypes in different environments, canalization
decreases the within-group interindividual variance
around the target phenotype by reducing the sensitivity to
genetic and environmental conditions, and DS buffers
against random perturbations in development (i.e.,
decreases FA). Because the left and right body sides share
the same genome (barring unusual somatic mutation or
somatic recombination) and in most organisms also very
nearly the same environment, FA provides an intrinsic
control for genetic and environmental effects and the
important question is to what extent these two sources of
variation share underlying regulatory mechanisms.

Within the framework of recently developed geometrically based methods for the statistical analysis of size and
shape variation (collectively referred to as geometric morphometrics [21,22]), the wing vein network of Drosophila
is regarded as an excellent model system to investigate
those problems [23,24]. Wing development in Drosophila
is well understood [25], and the vein pattern is highly
conserved across species (e.g. [26]). When flies are reared
at low temperatures it is well known that the final wing
size increases because of an increase in adult cell size [27].
This plastic response is parallel to what has been commonly observed in laboratory experiments on thermal
evolution, where adaptation to lower temperature
resulted in increased wing size (a proxy for body size)
entirely as a consequence of cell size divergence [28].
However, there is circumstantial evidence suggesting that
developmental and evolutionary temperature-related cell
size divergence have contrasting effects on wing shape.
Thus, Birdsall et al. [29] concluded that wing shape in
Drosophila melanogaster is quite resistant to developmental
temperature. Conversely, in D. subobscura there are
changes in wing proportions along a latitudinal size cline
mediated by cell area [30,31]. These populations exhibit,
in addition, prominent latitudinal clines for chromosomal inversion polymorphisms, and there is compelling
evidence showing that the inversion clines underlie the
latitudinal changes in wing proportions [32,33].
Here we report on the effects of clinal genetic variation
(inversion polymorphism) on wing form (size and shape)
and bilateral asymmetry using isochromosomal lines of
D. subobscura. We consider the consequences of inbreeding and temperature on the two components of developmental homeostasis (canalization and DS), and the
relationship between them. The remainder of the paper is
planned as follows. First, we provide a short account of
the inversion polymorphism in D. subobscura and the
experimental settings. Then, based on the well balanced
data set rendered by the experimental design we used the
standard least-squares (ANOVA) method to decompose
sources of variation for wing size and shape into causal
components at the core of further analyses. Furthermore,
because the underlying assumption to use FA as a measure
of DS is that left – right-side variation has not heritable
basis, the genetic and environmental components of bilateral asymmetry were partitioned. As a result, our approach
is unusual in studies of DS in providing estimates of the
two components of special environmental effects (co-)
variance under different genetic backgrounds and general
environmental settings. We also present some evidence
for the presence of genetic variation in directional asymmetry (DA) but not in FA. Next, we test whether or not the
vectors describing variation of landmark position for fly
vein traits are concordant, and finally we discuss the main
findings in relation with the evolution of buffering mech-

anisms and the putative adaptive value of natural wing
shape variation in D subobscura.

Experimental settings
D. subobscura is a particularly inversion-rich species, with
up to 38 natural chromosomal arrangements already
reported for the largest chromosome O (homologous to
arm 3R in D. melanogaster [34]) for which a balancer stock
is available. In colonizing populations of the New World
only six gene arrangements are segregating for that chromosome: Ost, O3+4, O3+4+2, O3+4+7, O3+4+8 and O5
(arrangement O7 is also present at very low frequency but
it is probably the result of a recombination event in the
Ost/O3+4+7 heterokaryotype [35]). In native Palearctic populations arrangements O3+4+2 and O3+4+8 are restricted to
the Mediterranean region (the likely area from which the
original American colonists derived [36]) and are not
involved in latitudinal clines [35]. On the other hand,
arrangement Ost shows a world-wide positive correlation
with latitude, while arrangements O3+4 and O3+4+7 show a
contrasting pattern [35]. Therefore, six independent isochromosomal lines for each of these three chromosome
arrangements (i.e., O1 , ..., O6 ; j = st, 3+4, 3+4+7) were

used in the present experiments.
The experimental flies were obtained from 54 crosses,
which will be referred to as inbred (isogenic; i.e.,

O1 × O1 , O2 × O2 ,..., O6 × O6 ) with 18 crosses in total, or

background (except for the male sex chromosome),

important. Anyhow, experimental flies were randomly

experiment: optimal (18°C) and warm (23°C).

none of the regressions of centroid size FA on average
wing size was statistically significant (ranging from β = 0.045 (95% C.I.: -0.091, 0.001) for inbred females at
18°C to β = 0.030 (-0.005, 0.064) for inbred females at
23°C), thus suggesting independence between size and
size FA.
b) Causal components of variation
For each sex two-way mixed ANOVAs were separately performed for inbred and outbred crosses at each experimental temperature (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4). Size variation (CS:
centroid size) among individuals comprised the largest
part (> 90%) of the variation. The fraction of the total phenotypic variance in wing size associated to genetic differences 2 among 2 karyotypes
and/or
lines
(i.e.,
σ k (CS) + σ1 (CS)
) ranged from 0.235 (inbred

males at+ σ1 (CS) +0.602 (inbred females at 23°C). (Bear
in mind that there is nothing in the ANOVA method of
estimation that will prevent a negative variance estimate
[37].)

No significant size differences were generally detected
among karyotypes for average CS, although O3+4 flies were

always the biggest within inbred lines (Fig. 1). On the
other hand, in outbred crosses heterokaryotypes were bigger than homokaryotypes (females: 18°C F(1,195) = 9.78, P
= 0.002; 23°C F(1,195) = 9.19, P = 0.003; males: 18°C
F(1,195) = 1.84, P = 0.176; 23°C F(1,195) = 4.23, P = 0.041),
but interactions of dominance effects were observed in all
samples with discernible heterosis in Ost/O3+4 lines when
compared to their homokaryotypic counterparts.
In concert with some independent preliminary results
using a set of Ost isochromosomal lines [38] a quite
remarkable finding here was that left wings were
consistently bigger than the right ones, thus causing a generally highly significant DA (i.e., "sides" effect in Tables 1,
2, 3, 4) of overall wing size even though DA was fairly subtle (see bottom statistics in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4). Each Drosophila wing vein has dorsal and ventral components that
come together after the apposition of the dorsal and ventral surfaces, but each vein protrudes only in one wing surface ("corrugation") [25]. When wings were mounted no
attempt was made to standardize the surface position: in
females 394 (60.8%) left and 387 (59.7%) right wings
were mounted on the slides with the dorsal side up (χ2 =

1.05, 1 df, P = 0.306). Potential biasing effects when measuring wings; namely, dorsal or ventral Bitmap images or
possible differences between left and right wings when
Bitmap images are captured from the top or bottom of the
microscope slide, were checked from a subset of 75
females and 75 males. An additional set of two images for
each wing were taken in the same session from the top
and bottom of the slide and digitized once. The centroid
size differences between the averages of both measurements was apparently random with respect to digitizing
procedure and always lower than 0.07%, whereas left
wings were 0.26% bigger than the right ones in females
and 0.34% in males. We are, therefore, quite confident
that the fairly subtle DA for wing CS is not an experimental artifact but a real phenomenon.
In addition to DA, there was subtle but significant FA in
all crosses (i.e., "individuals × sides" interaction effect in
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4) together with a small amount of genetic
variation for DA in some of them. This last finding could
hardly be attributable to a type I error because similar
results had been previously obtained [[38]; see below].
Conversely, two-level nested ANOVAs to test for genetic
components of overall size FA (using index FA1 in Palmer
[39]) failed to show any statistically significant effects

whatsoever (variance components ranging from -0.0047
to 0.0071 for karyotypes, and from -0.0343 to 0.0406 for
crosses within karyotypes; values in pixels2).
c) Consanguinity and temperature effects
Inbreeding and environmental effects were simultaneously analyzed by contrasting isogenic vs. outbred
homokaryotypic flies reared at both experimental temperatures (Fig. 1). Flies were obviously bigger when raised at
the lowest temperature, and three-way factorial ANOVAs
performed separately for each sex using CS (as loge (pixels), but results were qualitatively identical without a logtransformation) as the dependent variable, with karyotype, temperature and inbreeding as fixed effects, and
crosses nested within karyotypes, clearly indicated
inbreeding depression together with temperature by
inbreeding interaction (i.e., inbreeding was most noticeable at the sub-optimal temperature of 23°C), but no karyotype by temperature interaction was detected. These
results confirm that wing size is not a purely additive trait
in D. subobscura, in agreement with the previous observation that heterokaryotypes were bigger than homokaryotypes in outbred crosses (see also [40]).

Both inbreeding and (sub-optimal) temperature effects
were also apparent in females when overall size FA (index
FA1) was used as the dependent variable in three-way facPage 6 of 28

torial ANOVAs, with no differences among karyotypes.
On the other hand, no statistically significant effects were
detected for males, basically because inbred crosses performed approximately equal at both temperatures (Fig.
1). However, overall asymmetry augmented in inbred
crosses because DA largely increased (mainly in males) at
the highest temperature ("temperature × inbreeding"
interaction: F(1,856) = 9.46, P = 0.002).
It is worth mentioning here that in outbred crosses overall
size FA was about the same for homokaryotypes and heterokaryotypes: the only significant effect was again an
increase in FA at the sub-optimal temperature (more than

2
two-fold; c.f. σ w (DACS) values in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4).
Finally, inbreeding appears to have affected among-fly
variation only in males as suggested by the consistently
2
lower σ w (CS) estimates in outbred crosses within rearing
temperature.

In conclusion, overall size DS was positively correlated
with levels of heterozygosity (i.e., inbred vs. outbred
homokaryotypes) and development at the optimal temperature of 18°C. However, no positive association was
found between DS and chromosomal heterozygosity in
outbred crosses.

Variation and asymmetry in shape
a) Sources of variation
Two-way MANOVA analyses to quantify inter- and intraindividual variation in wing shape are shown in Tables 5,
6, 7, 8. For the present study of 13 landmarks, with 2 coordinates each, the shape dimension is 22. Sums of squares
and cross-products (SSCP) matrices are therefore not fullranked, and we retained 22 PC (principal components
[41]) scores for outbred crosses and only 15 PC scores –
which accounted for more than 98% of the total shape
variance – for inbred crosses to be capable of testing for
genetic components. The degrees of freedom in Tables 5,
6, 7, 8 (columns "df 1") are simply the corresponding
degrees of freedom in the ANOVAs for centroid size
(Tables 1, 2, 3, 4) times the number of PC scores retained
in each sample. Likewise, the overall covariation in wing
shape ("individuals" effect) was decomposed into causal
components (karyotypes, crosses in karyotypes, and
among flies); and the overall covariation in wing shape FA

("individuals × sides" interaction effect) was decomposed
into causal components attributable to wing shape DA
(karyotypes, crosses in karyotypes, and within flies).
Similarly to what had been found for CS, differences
between left and right wings were also highly significant
("sides" effect), thus indicating that DA was present for
overall wing shape. This finding is contrary to our
previous claim from a subset of Ost isochromosomal lines,
where DA for some landmarks (e.g. those defining the
position of the anterior crossvein) but not for overall wing
shape was detected [38]. After plotting the Procrustes
grand mean shapes of both wings it also became apparent
here that the location of the anterior crossvein was indeed
slightly more distal in the right wings. Furthermore, the
individuals × sides interaction effects were highly
significant in all cases and, hence, wing shape FA greatly
exceeded measurement error.

b) Causal components of variation
As has been forcefully stressed [42] shape is an inherently
multidimensional concept and cannot be easily reduced
to a scalar index without severe loss of information. Therefore, for a quantitative genetic analysis of shape data a
multivariate approach is required [43]. For overall wing
shape, genetic differences among karyotypes were mostly
detected for outbred crosses (Tables 5, 6, 7, 8), and we
have estimated the covariance matrices P = K + C + E as a
simple multivariate extension of the two-level nested
ANOVAs, where P is the phenotypic covariance matrix
and K, C, and E are, respectively, the covariance matrices
for karyotypes, crosses within karyotypes, and the
residuals.

Fig. 2 shows the amount of variation associated with the
different dimensions in shape space. Much of the variation was concentrated in the first few PCs, but the K matrices showed the clearest trend to quickly decrease after the
first PC. Permutation tests indicated that matrix correlations (MCs) between K and C matrices were generally
higher at 18°C (females MC = 0.258, P = 0.1908 ; males
MC = 0.305, P = 0.1963) than at 23°C (females MC =
0.157, P = 0.3356 ; males MC = 0.250, P = 0.2665), but
none of the MCs was statistically significant. On the other
hand, VCV matrices were correlated across rearing temperatures (females: MC K = 0.716, P = 0.0163; MC C = 0.818,
P = 0.0001; males: MC K = 0.706, P = 0.0160 ; MC C =
0.587, P = 0.0399 ; this last correlation was no longer sig-

nificant after the Bonferroni procedure [44]). A close
inspection to Fig. 2 reveals an increase in the genetic components of overall wing shape at 23°C, which agrees with
our preliminary findings [38]. Thus, the ratio between the
total variance of genetic (G = K + C) covariance matrix
onto the total variance of the phenotypic covariance
matrix was lower at 18°C in both sexes (females: 0.1312
vs. 0.5450; males: 0.2365 vs. 0.2522). A caveat: these
ratios cannot be interpreted as estimates of shape heritability [43].
MANOVA results in Tables 5, 6, 7, 8 also point to the presence of genetic variation for overall shape DA, mainly at
18°C (i.e., the "crosses in karyotypes" component from
the decomposition of the I × S interaction effect). As far as
we are aware, these are the first experiments that found
detectable genetic variation in DA for wing traits. The
uncovering of DA (i.e., "side" effect) for fly wings is quite
general when quantitative analyses of form are carried out
using the powerful methods of geometric morphometrics
to reveal even small morphological variation that
otherwise would remain hidden with less effective techniques [13,45]. This has raised concerns against the conventional wisdom that left and right are not distinguished
in Drosophila development [46] because it provides compelling evidence that DA in fly wings may signal the presence of genetic variation in a phylogenetic conserved leftright developmental axis (i.e., an imaginary plane
between the two lateral sides of the body), as discussed by
Klingenberg et al. [45]. Actually, modern treatises in
developmental biology (e.g. [9]) distinguish the left-right
axis besides the customary anterior-posterior and dorsalventral axes, and several asymmetrically expressed genes
(e.g. sonic hedgehog) have recently been discovered. In Drosophila, Ligoxygakis et al. [47] were the first (and to our
knowledge the only ones) who showed a developmental
mechanism for the developmental asymmetry. It seems,
therefore, that the detection of genetic variation for DA in
this genus appears to be basically a methodological problem, including statistical power and the environmental
conditions where the experiments are performed. The
mechanisms that constitute the genetic basis of morphological asymmetry in Drosophila obviously require further
study.

c) Genetic components of wing shape FA
Following [13] a multivariate equivalent of FA1 (i.e., the
"unsigned" left-right differences) was defined by changing
the signs of all coordinate differences (from left-right to
right-left) whenever the inner product (also referred to as
the dot product) of a left-right difference vector with the
vector of mean left-right difference was negative. For the
univariate case (CS) this procedure would render here the

absolute ( L − R ) differences, but notice that for the multivariate case it is not equivalent to calculate the absolute
( L − R ) differences of all Procrustes coordinates.
MANOVA analyses of these "unsigned" shape asymmetries in outbred crosses did not detect any genetic variation for shape FA at 18°C or 23°C (Tables 9, 10).
However, the approach used to define the multivariate
equivalent of FA1 might be influenced by the arbitrary
choice of the plane (i.e., the mean left-right differences) to
subdivide the shape space into "positive" and "negative"
halves (Christian P Klingenberg, pers. comm. 2004). A
modified Procrustes shape distance for non-isotropic
variation (i.e., landmarks usually differ in their amounts
of variation) has been recently developed by Klingenberg
and Monteiro [48], and can be used here as a scalar measure of the amount of shape asymmetry because FA is random in origin (i.e., only the magnitude and not the
direction may usually be the interesting component of FA
shape variation). When this scalar was used in our data set
the same conclusion was obtained; namely, there was no
detectable genetic variation for wing shape FA in any case
(results not shown).
d) Consanguinity and temperature effects on wing shape
To investigate allometric and nonallometric temperature
effects on overall wing shape we performed a multivariate
analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) of the Procrustes
coordinates (after averaging both sides and the two replicated measurements per side) considering temperature
and inbreeding (i.e., isogenic vs. outbred homokaryotypic
flies) as the categorical predictors and CS (as loge (pixels))
as the covariate. Temperature effects were only significant
in males, but inbreeding and temperature × inbreeding
interaction effects were highly significant in both sexes

(results not shown), which suggests a strong effect of the
categorical predictors on the nonallometric component of
shape. Size effects were also found to be significant
(females: Wilks' λ = 0.881, F(22,405) = 2.496, P < 0.001;
males: Wilks' λ = 0.915, F(22,405) = 1.715, P = 0.024), but
the allometric effect on shape remained relatively consistent at both temperatures in females (size × temperature
interaction: Wilks' λ = 0.930, F(22,405) = 1.395, P = 0.111)
but not in males (Wilks' λ = 0.853, F(22,405) = 3.165, P
<0.001). The association between size and temperature
(Fig. 1), measured by the variance inflaction factor (VIF <
5; [49]), was found to be lower than the suggested guideline for serious collinearity (i.e. VIF ≥ 10), which indicates
that the effects of temperature and size on wing shape
could be effectively separated.

accounted for relatively large amounts of variability. On
the contrary, for FA and measurement error PC1
explained almost all total variance (>80%). For all levels
in the analysis (i.e. individuals, FA and measurement
error) the dominant PCs were connected to the relatively
large variability of landmarks 3, 6, 7 and, to a lesser extent,
landmark 2. However, the disproportionate amount of
variation associated with these landmarks did not spread
to all sources of causal variation because their coefficients
were relatively small for the PC1 of karyotype variation
(which explained ~60% of the total variance; see below).
Furthermore, for the individual variation the first two PCs
were also linked to the shift of the anterior (landmarks 11
and 12) and posterior (landmarks 7 and 13) crossveins
along the adjoining longitudinal veins.

The conclusion is, therefore, that Drosophila wing shape
does not seem to be as resistant to environmental temperature as previously claimed from the analysis of 12 highly
inbred D. melanogaster lines [29].

Permutation tests indicated that VCV matrices were
mostly correlated for FA and measurement error effects
within samples (MCs > 0.95, P < 0.01; Table 11). The individual VCV matrix was significantly correlated with the FA
and measurement error matrices only for females at 18°C.
Between temperatures the VCV matrices were highly correlated for FA and measurement error (results not shown),
but loosely correlated for the individual variation
(females MC = 0.668, P = 0.0355 ; males MC = 0.494, P =
0.1066 ; statistical significance vanishes after the Bonferroni procedure).

Inbreeding effects (isogenic vs. outbred homokaryotypic
flies) on wing shape FA were tested from the ratio between
the traces of the corresponding "individual × side" VCV
matrices. Notice that the traces of these interaction matrices are equal to the respective mean squares of the Procrustes ANOVA as implemented by Klingenberg and
McIntyre [13], and are simply the sum of Var(L − R) (index
FA4 in [39]) for each x and y coordinates of the corresponding aligned configurations divided by the shape
dimension. We performed 10,000 randomization runs for
each test. Inbreeding effects were detected at 18°C but
only in females (18°C: female F = 1.694, P = 0.0003 ;
male F = 0.963, P = 0.6037 ; 23°C: female F = 0.834, P =
0.9231; male F = 0.984, P = 0.5541).
Patterns of wing shape variation
a) Fluctuating asymmetry
Principal component analyses were only implemented for
the outbred crosses since they are more representative of
the natural situation. The percentages of total shape
variation, together with the features of variation associated with the dominant PCs, are graphically plotted in
Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6. For the individual variation several PCs

The angles between the PC1s for FA and measurement
error were very much alike (ranging from angle α = 2.1°
to α = 3.4° ; recall that the 0.1% quantile of the resulting
distribution between pairs of random vectors in 22dimensional space was 50.3°), which reflects the
similarity due to landmarks 3, 6 and 7. However, the first
three PCs for interindividual variation were generally distinct to those of FA: the only clear correspondences were
between the PC1s for females at 18°C (α = 21.5°), and
the PC2 of interindividual variation with the PC1 of FA
for males at 18°C (α = 11.8°). (The correspondences were
qualitatively the same for interindividual variation and
measurement error; results not shown.) Overall, these
results seem to suggest that canalization and DS do not
generally share the same underlying regulatory mechanisms (but see below).

MANOVA (individuals, individuals × sides interaction, and measurement error) for females from outbred crosses reared at
18°C. Also plotted are the percentages of total wing shape variation explained by the principal components for the corresponding covariance matrices.

A potentially important problem with the foregoing
approach to compare the patterns of intra- and interindividual variation is to rely on the interaction VCV matrix as
the source of variation due to FA. As has been previously
argued the uncovering of DA is almost ubiquitous for
shape data when using the methods of geometry morphometrics, and there was evidence here for statistically significant genetic variation of overall shape DA at 18°C
(Tables 5, 6). Therefore, the VCV matrix from the
"individuals × sides" interaction effect gives a biased estimate of developmental stability and cannot be taken as
the covariance matrix for FA. In other words, this VCV
matrix also includes all causal components due to genetic

variation for DA, and the corresponding unbiased VCV
matrix for FA is that for the within-fly component of the
interaction effect (i.e., after removing the genetic variation
for DA [50,51]). In any case, all results were qualitatively
similar and, hence, the conclusion that canalization and
DS seem to be different mechanisms remains unchanged.
However, it is difficult to appraise how this potential
problem could have affected the previously published
conclusions when comparing interindividual variation
and "FA" in fly wings and mouse skulls (see Background
section).

Between rearing temperatures the congruence of PC1
eigenvectors was also very high for FA (females α = 4.0°;
males α = 3.5°) and measurement error (females α = 3.1°;
males α = 4.1°). For the interindividual variation the correlations between PC1s were significant only in males
(females α = 74.3°; males α = 19.3°); however, the PC1
vector describing the joint interindividual variation of
landmark position in females at 18°C matched the PC2 of
the interindividual covariance matrix at 23°C (α = 49.6°;
recall that the direction of PCs is arbitrary and all the
movements in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6 can be simultaneously
reversed by 180°) and vice versa (i.e., PC1 at 23°C vs PC2
at 18°C: α = 26.4°).

b) Causal components
Besides the interindividual variation in the two-way
MANOVAs (which comprises genetic plus environmental
covariances due to special environmental effects) it is
important here to asses the patterns of joint
displacements of landmarks for each of the causal components of wing shape variation (Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10). For karyotype variation PC1 accounted for ~60% of the total
variance and was linked to a great extent with equivalent
movements of those landmarks defining the location of
the crossveins, which shifted in the same direction. Landmarks 4 and 5 tended to move away each other, stretching
the wing margin between longitudinal veins III and IV.
Landmark 9 budged in the opposite direction to crossveins shifts, thus shaping the relationship between L1 to

the total length of longitudinal vein IV (i.e. shape index L1
WL ; Fig. 12).
A relative shortening of the basal length of longitudinal
vein IV relative to the total wing length with an increasing
dose of standard gene arrangements in all five major
chromosomes of D. subobscura had been previously identified in an outbred stock [32,33]. A similar pattern
regarding Ost dose is also clear here when considering the
six karyotypes (Fig. 11), but rearing temperature quantitatively modified the shape index (L1/WL was lower at the
highest temperature). However, there was no statistically
significant karyotype × temperature interaction. The wing
shape index appears to be a purely additive trait since heterokaryotypes were always intermediate to their
corresponding homokaryotypes (Fig. 11). Actually, none

of 12 within- group (i.e., sex and temperature) possible
contrasts comparing all three heterokaryotypes with the
average of the corresponding homokaryotypes was statistically significant (the mean square for "crosses" was used
as the error term; see legend in Fig. 11).
PC2 for karyotypes was also connected to the variability of
landmarks 3, 6 and 7. For the crosses component, several
PCs explained relatively large amounts of variation, and
shifts of crossveins now seem to be independent of each
other at 18°C but not at 23°C. Finally, for the within-fly
variation several PCs accounted for relatively large
amounts of variability. PC1s were again connected to the
variability of landmarks 3, 6 and 7; and PC2s to shifts in
the anterior crossvein.

The large amount of variation of the anterior and posterior crossveins for karyotypes and crosses can be interpreted in terms of developmental processes. The
crossveins are determined after the longitudinal veins,
and mutations that eliminate crossveins (e.g. crossveinless)
do not affect the longitudinal veins; however, some
mutants that affect the longitudinal veins also influence
the crossveins (e.g. the vn group in [1]). Intra- and
interespecific studies in several Drosophila species have
found displacements of one or both crossveins along their
longitudinal veins, and such shifts also occur in a number
of mutants (see [23]). However, these shifts do not occur
in isolation an also include other landmarks as well (e.g.,
landmarks 9 and 5 on L4; landmarks 1 and 2 on L1; Figs.
7, 8, 9, 10).

The matrix permutation tests (Table 11) indicated that the
VCV matrices of karyotypes and crosses were never
significantly correlated with the VCV matrices of FA and
measurement error. The high correlation between the
VCV matrices of the interindividual and FA effects for
females at 18°C was basically due to the (micro-) environmental component. Also notice that all correlations
between the VCV matrices of karyotype and FA effects
were close to zero or even negative, which clearly suggests
that this genetic component of canalization is unrelated
to DS.
In addition, the PC1s of karyotypes and FA were nearly at
right angles (18°C: females α = 85.8°, males α = 77.3°;
23°C: females α = 75.6°, males α = 78.5°). The only
matches were between PC2 of karyotypes and PC1 of FA

for females at 18°C (α = 13.0°) and males at 23°C (α =
31.2°). The PC1s of crosses and FA were also poorly correlated; the only exception being females a 23°C (α =
43.3°). These results clearly support the hypothesis that
genetic canalization and DS are not functionally the same
mechanism.
On the other hand, all observed angles involving PC1s
between "replicated genotypes" (i.e. the between-fly
component) and FA were relatively small and highly significant (18°C: females α = 20.1°, males α = 15.9° ;
23°C: females α = 22.7°, males α = 36.7°). (Results were
qualitatively the same for all observed angles involving
PC1s of the between-fly and measurement error covariance matrices; results not shown.) Together with the overall comparisons of the covariance matrices (Table 11),
these results indicate that (micro-) environmental canalization and DS share underlying regulatory mechanisms
but are not identical. There was not a complete congruence as PC1 of FA accounted for most part of the variation,
while PC1 of between-fly variation usually explained less
than 50% of the total variance (Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10).

To conclude, the theoretical lower limit for (micro-) environmental canalization (i.e., the environmental variance
among genetically identical individuals) would be FA
because the two sides share the same genome (barring
unusual somatic mutation or somatic recombination)
and nearly the same environment, so differences between
sides are likely to be small. Under stabilizing selection this
lower limit is obviously associated with higher fitness.
However, this "canalization limit" would hardly ever be
observed because of unavoidable additional sources of
environmental variance (e.g. variation between vials, the
position of the pupae in a vial, etc.). A similar logic than
the one used in this work has been applied to distinguish
between intrinsic and extrinsic stochastic variation in gene
expression: intrinsic noise can be separated by contrasting
the levels of gene expression in a construct with two identically regulated but fluorescently distinguishable gpf
genes in the Escherichia coli chromosome, whereas extrinsic noise is inferred by the correlated variation between
the two copies in the same environment [52,53].

explained by the principal components for the corresponding covariance matrices.

Conclusions
This study applied the methods of geometric morphometrics in the context of quantitative genetics of wing form
variation using isochromosomal lines of D. subobscura.
The main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) for
the analysis of overall size, DS was positively correlated
with levels of heterozygosity (i.e., inbred vs. outbred
homokaryotypes) and development at the optimal
temperature; however, no positive association was found
between DS and chromosomal heterozygosity in outbred
crosses; (ii) there was detectable genetic variation (mainly
for overall shape) for the directional component of
morphological asymmetry (i.e., DA) but not for FA, which

likely reflects variation due to stochasticity in development; (iii) for analyses of shape, the patterns of
covariation for FA and measurement error were highly
concordant in all samples, which also provides strong reasons to conclude that FA is generated by random
perturbations of developmental processes (obviously, this
does not imply that DS is independent of the genetic background: wing shape FA was found to be higher in inbred
females at 18°C when compared to their outbred
homokaryotypic counterparts); (iv) the inter- and
intraindividual variation patterns were generally poorly
correlated, which supports the hypothesis that canalization and DS are distinct mechanisms; however, (v) the

patterns of variation due to the (micro-) environmental
component of canalization (i.e., the among-fly special
environmental effects covariances) were quite similar to
those observed for FA; (vi) the lack of a significant withingroup correlation between the VCV matrices associated
with the interindividual genetic components of canalization and FA, as well as the low similarity between the corresponding vectors describing variation of landmark
position, strongly suggest that genetic and environmental
canalization are not similar mechanisms.
In addition, (vii) a discrepancy between sexes was
observed in some situations; e.g. overall size FA increased
with inbreeding and (sub-optimal) temperature effects
mainly in females, and the allometric effect on wing shape

at both experimental temperatures was similar in females
but not in males. It is also interesting to note here that
wing size (measured as WL; Fig. 12) clines for D. subobscura developed in North America after ~20 years since
colonization, but males were clearly lagging behind
females [54]. What is not obvious, however, is why there
is a difference between the sexes.
It has been suggested that a relationship between canalization and DS could only reflect a common underlying
association between character and fitness [55,56]. Those
traits under strong stabilizing selection may not be genetically canalized and the major source of selective pressure
for canalization can result from the benefits gained by
buffering the effects of environmental perturbations

[4,10]. The strongest evidence in favor of this hypothesis
comes from the well-known genotype-phenotype mapping of RNA folding. Conservation of RNA secondary
structure is under strong selection, and low structural plasticity is achieved through increasing the thermodynamic
independence of any one structural component from the
remaining structure [57]. Likewise, the flux summation
theorem developed in the field of metabolic control analysis implies, if true, that phenotypic robustness is an inevitable outcome of the underlying metabolism and not a
result of evolution (see [58]).
However, it is still an open question whether or not natural wing shape changes in Drosophila are adaptive. There
are no consistent patterns between latitude and wing

shape (e.g. [30]), contrarily to what happens for sizerelated traits where world-wide latitudinal clines are
found with genetically larger individuals derived from
higher latitudes (e.g. [30,59]). Many genes with small
additive effects on features of wing shape are dispersed
along the Drosophila genome (e.g. [60,61]), and we have
shown here that the wing shape index L1/WL appears to
be a purely additive trait since heterokaryotypes were
always intermediate to their homokaryotypic counterparts. The wing shape cline in North America colonizing
populations of D. subobscura [30] can be largely accounted
for parallel latitudinal clines in chromosomal gene
arrangements [32,33], and the small shifts of (e.g.) the
anterior and posterior crossveins in relation to karyotype
variation (Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10; notice that the plotted joint var-

iation in landmark positions is an exaggeration of the
actual variation in the data set) are difficult to link with
any adaptive response to a better flight capacity. Actually,
we lack even hypothetical functional explanations for
subtle shape variation: Gilchrist et al. [54] speculated that
wing shape variation in D. subobscura may simply represent drift around an optimum. Our present results (points
(v) and (vi) above) give some credence to that conjecture.
Genetic canalization on wing shape does not seem to arise
as a by-product of environmental canalization and, therefore, canalization is not a single mechanism to buffer any
source of variation as has been suggested [10].
According to Graham et al. [62] the classical linear theory
of DS can successfully account for both normally distrib-

uted error distributions and leptokurtic distributions
caused by the admixture of individuals having different
levels of DS, but cannot account for transitions between
FA and DA. We have previously suggested, however, that
a transition from "ideal" FA (i.e., a normal distribution of
left – right-side scores whose mean is zero) to a distribution showing DA could be made entirely compatible with
what it is already known from classical quantitative genetics [38]. Shifts between asymmetry types (FA, DA and
antisymmetry) have been reported to happen along a species distribution range [63], but unless the genetic
component can be partitioned out the variation in leftright differences cannot be assumed to describe DS. From
the results of outbred crosses reared at 18°C (Table 5, 6)
it is possible to test here for the congruence between pat-

terns of morphological variation with respect to the variation attributable to FA (i.e. the within-fly environmental
component of the interaction term) and that attributable
to genetic variation for DA (the within-fly genetic component due to crosses in karyotypes of the interaction term).
The corresponding VCV matrices were highly correlated
for females (MC = 0.914, P(permutation) = 0.0001) but not
for males (MC = 0.064, P(permutation) = 0.485). The angles
between the PC1s also reflect this discrepancy between
samples (females α = 8.6° ; males α = 45.9°). When considered together, these results clearly suggest that FA and
genetic variation for DA may or may not be functionally
linked.

Methods
Extraction of O chromosomes and fly handling
A large number of D. subobscura isochromosomal lines for
the O chromosome in an otherwise homogeneous genetic
background were derived from an outbred stock collected
at Puerto Montt (Chile; 41° 28' S) in November 1999 as
previously indicated [38]. Briefly, wild-type males were
individually crossed to three or four virgin females from
the highly homogeneous ch-cu marker strain, which is
homozygous for the morphological recessive markers on
the O chromosome cherry eyes (ch) and curled wings (cu)

and fixed for the gene arrangement O3+4. A single O1

Followed by at least another backcross to ch-cu females, a
single male from each line carrying the wild chromosome
was crossed to two virgin females from the Va/Ba balanced
marker stock. This strain was derived from the ch-cu stock
and carries the dominant lethal genes Varicose (Va) and
Bare (Ba) on the O chromosome. The isochromosomal

++++ × ǩǩ OVa ch + cu / O++++ . All lines used here had
a quasi-normal viability according to the recorded proportions of wild-type flies raised in the final crosses to obtain
the isochromosomal lines [38]. The lines were kept at
18°C (12:12 light/dark cycle) in 130-mL bottles with low
adult density to standardize the rearing conditions before
egg collections.

As previously indicated the experimental flies were
obtained from 54 crosses. Reciprocal crosses were made
for all outbred combinations by mating one-week virgin
females and males. After three days the males were
discarded and equal numbers of females from each reciprocal cross were placed together in a plastic chamber with
a spoon containing non-nutritive agar with a generous
smear of live yeast for egg collections. To standardize the
experimental conditions, eggs from the inbred (isogenic)
crosses were also obtained in a similar way; namely, after
mating the flies in bottles and transferring the females to
plastic chambers. Eggs were placed in six 2 × 8 cm vials
with 6 mL of food (26 eggs/vial); three vials were kept at
18°C (optimal temperature) and the other three at 23°C
(sub-optimal temperature). Within each experimental
temperature the vials were randomly placed on the same
incubator shelf. As a result, the total experiment consisted
of 324 vials (162 vials at each experimental temperature),
and all eggs were sampled on the same day. Emerging flies
(not less than 2 or 3 days old) were stored in Eppendorf
tubes with a 3:1 mixture of alcohol and glycerol at 4°C
before wing measurements.
All fly handling was done at room temperature using CO2
anesthesia on flies not less than 6 h after eclosion.
Wing measurements
Two randomly sampled females and males emerged from
each vial were used for morphometric analyses. Both
wings were removed from each fly and fixed in DPX under
coverslips on microscope slides. Bitmap images were captured with a video camera (Sony CCD-Iris, Tokyo, Japan)
connected to a PC computer with MGI VideoWave software and mounted on a compound microscope (Zeiss
Axioskop, Jena, Germany), using a 2.5 × objective. Calibration of the optical system was checked at each session.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/7

The images were stored on a Dell Workstation PWS350.
To quantify and minimize measurement error all wings
were digitized two times at different sessions as follows:
images of both the left and right wings were captured
during a given session and after an entire round on all
individuals the same process was repeated again. A similar
procedure was also used to record the x and y coordinates
of 13 morphological landmarks (i.e., labeled geometric
points located at the intersections of wing veins or at sites
where veins reach the wing margin; Fig. 12) by using the
Scion Image for Windows software [64]. Therefore, the
process we used guaranteed that the observer was blind
with respect to the results from previous measurements.
Analysis of wing size and shape
Geometric morphometrics precisely separates morphological variation (i.e., variation in form) into size and
shape components [21,22]. Size is a one-dimensional trait
and the measure most widely used in geometric morphometrics is centroid size (CS), computed here in a normalized form as the square root of the sum of squared
Euclidian distances between each landmark to the centroid (center of gravity) of all landmarks divided by the
square root of the number of landmarks. Individual size is
therefore represented by four scalars, one for each side
and session.

The shape of an original configuration of landmarks is the
geometrical information that is invariant to uniform scaling (variation in size), translation (differences in position), and rotation (differences in orientation). In
contrast to size, shape is an inherently multidimensional
space and we used Procrustes superimposition to characterize shape variation. This method allows comparing
configurations of landmarks by optimally superimposing
(according to a least-squares criterion) homologous
landmarks in two or more specimens to achieve an overall
best fit [65].Because the data set included both left and
right wings (i.e., we are dealing with "matching symmetry" [66,67]) our analyses also removed differences due to
reflection by changing the sign of the x coordinate of every
landmark for configurations from the right side. The
reflection, scaling, and superposition steps were performed for all wings within each cross and temperature
simultaneously, which allows contrasting wing shapes
between different lines or crosses. The final iteration to
minimize the sum of the squared distances between the
landmarks of all wings in the sample was done without
additional scaling and, consequently, we performed a partial Procrustes fit according to Dryden and Mardia [22].
Given the small amounts of shape variation in this analysis rescaling the coordinates of each configuration by the
scaling option 1/cos(ρ) [65] would have negligible effects
on the results.

The landmark coordinates after Procrustes superimposition are amenable to standard multivariate analyses.
However, it is important to remember that the removal of
size, position (in two dimensions), and orientation
reduces the dimensional space to 2p – 4, where p is the
number of landmarks [22]. Thus, for the present study of
13 landmarks, with 2 coordinates each, the shape
dimension is 22. Sums of squares and cross-products
(SSCP) matrices are therefore not full-ranked, and the
degrees of freedom need to be adjusted. There are three
alternative ways of avoiding these difficulties [22,67]: (i)
to omit, after Procrustes superimposition of the complete
configurations, the coordinates of any two landmarks; (ii)
to retain 22 PC scores from the covariance matrix of the
data set; (iii) to slightly modify the multivariate statistics
(see below) by using the Moore-Penrose generalized
inverse of the SSCP matrices so they can tolerate singular
matrices, and compute the product of nonzero eigenvalues instead of the determinant of SSCP matrices. We have
used here the second scheme.
Experimental design and asymmetry analysis
Quantitative genetic studies of directional and fluctuating
asymmetry obviously require measures from individuals
that can be grouped into families or independent lines.
Our final data set was a fully balanced design, comprising
54 crosses × 3 vials per cross × 2 females per vial × 2 males
per vial × 2 sides per fly × 2 measurements per wing × 2
temperatures = 5,184 wing landmark configurations in
total. Within each sex and temperature, least-squares
(ANOVA) estimates of variance components (i.e. CS) can
be easily obtained from the linear model:

Yijkl = µ + κi + lj(i) + νk(ji) + εl(kji),
where µ is the overall grand mean, κi is the effect of the ith
karyotype, lj(i) is the random effect of the jth cross within
karyotype i, νk(ji) is the random effect of the kth vial within
cross j and karyotype i, and εl(kji) is the residual error associated with the trait (i.e. the individual means computed
from both sides and the two replicated measurements per
side) of the lth individual within vial k, cross j, and karyotype i. Since there was no genetic variation within crosses,
the residual error provides an estimate of the total special
2
environmental effects variance (i.e. σ e ). Variation among
the three replicated vials was generally negligible (results
not shown) and, therefore, we have conveniently reduced
the previous model to a two-level nested ANOVA after
grouping flies across vials.

To first partition the total phenotypic variation into interindividual, intraindividual and measurement error components, we used the conventional mixed model, twoway ANOVA (or its MANOVA generalization; see below)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/7

for the study of left-right asymmetries [39]. In this
ANOVA the main random effect of individuals stands for
phenotypic variation in the trait (i.e. CS), the main fixed
effect of body side is for directional asymmetry (DA) and
tests whether or no the signed differences between the left
and right wings [designated as ( L − R )] have a mean of
zero, the interaction term is a measure of fluctuating
asymmetry (the variation in left-right differences among
individuals) provided that there is no genetic variation for
DA [51], and the error term gives an estimate of the measurement error. The two-level nested ANOVA can be
straightforwardly subsumed within the two-way ANOVA.
We now digress slightly to point out some inconsistencies
in the literature on what is the appropriate error term to
test for the "interindividual" effect in the mixed model,
two-way ANOVA (either the individual × side interaction
effect or the measurement error [13,15,68,69]). Interindividual variation, even if of no general interest in most
studies of asymmetry, comprises here genetic components
("karyotype" plus "crosses within karyotypes") and spe2
cial environmental effects variance ( σ e ; there is no
genetic variance within crosses). An estimated of the
among-fly special environmental effects variance (i.e.
2
σ ea ) is therefore obtained by subtracting the individual ×
2
side interaction effect (which includes σ ew plus
measurement error) as the appropriate error term. However, when genetic variation for DA is present the unbiased within-fly special environmental effects variance (i.e.
FA) is estimated after partitioning the individual × side
interaction effect into its causal components [51].

As pointed out by Klingenberg et al. [67] it is fairly
straightforward to extent the preceding ANOVA approach
to a full two-factor MANOVA to analyze wing shape asymmetry since all effects are computed from averages or contrasts in the same shape space. Recall that the traces of the
corresponding SSCP matrices are just the sum of squares
in the Procrustes ANOVA as implemented by Klingenberg
and McIntyre [13], but this ANOVA is based on an isotropic model (i.e., it assumes that there is an equal
amount of non-directional variation at each landmark
[70]) that is not generally correct for any real data. Covariance (VCV) matrices for each effect in the MANOVA were
calculated as a simple multivariate extension of the twoway ANOVA. Thus, the SSCP matrices were divided by the
appropriate degrees of freedom, and effects were separated according to the expected mean squares in the
ANOVA by subtracting the interaction covariance (VCV)
matrix from the interindividual VCV matrix, and the error
VCV matrix from the interaction one. Therefore, for (e.g.)
outbred crosses the interindividual covariance
components
were
calculated
as

SSCPI

The SSCPI matrix was further partitioned into amongkaryotype SSCPK matrix, among-cross within karyotype
SSCPC⊂K matrix, and the residual SSCPe matrix corresponding to the special environmental effects. As a result,
genetic effects for overall wing shape were separated from
special environmental effects according to the expected
means squares in the two-level nested ANOVA. Therefore,
for (e.g.) outbred crosses the karyotype covariance components
were
calculated
as

SSCPC⊂K

660 (remind that the
144
entries in the SSCPI matrix are equal to those computed
from individual means times twice the number of independent measurements per wing), the cross covariance

Similarly, genetic effects for DA can be investigated after
partitioning the SSCPIS matrix into their causal components [51].
Morphological patterns of variation
Within each sex and temperature, principal component
analyses [41] of the VCV matrices were performed for each
source of variation with the purpose of describing the
landmark displacements corresponding to each emerging
principal component (PC), and also to test for the congruence of these displacements between effects. This
technique extracts new shape variables (PCs) which successively account for the maximal amount of shape variation and contain information on how the variables relate
to each other. The PCs form an orthonormal set of vectors

(i.e., the inner product p’i pj = 0 for i ≠ j, p’i pj = 1 for i =
j; superscript 'denotes transposition) in an n-dimensional
space.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/7

Correlations between corresponding VCV matrices were
computed from the upper triangular part (diagonal
entries were included) since covariance matrices are
symmetrical, and statistical significance was assessed
using permutation tests designed to maintain the associations between pairs of x- and y-coordinates (i.e., by permuting pairs of rows and columns [13,15]); otherwise the
null hypothesis would imply the complete absence of all
geometric structure. The permutation procedure was carried out 10,000 times. Correlative patterns of whole shape
variation are difficult to interpret: a significant correlation
would suggest a real congruence, but a weak congruence
does not imply a significant correlation.
A second test examined the congruence of the landmark
displacements corresponding to each emergent PC for the
different effects within groups. Because the PCs correspond to directions in the multivariate shape space, correlations can be obtained by angular comparisons of
component vectors. Statistical significance of these correlations was then assessed by comparing those observed
values to a null distribution of absolute angles between
100,000 pairs of 22-dimensional random vectors [71].
The 0.1% and 0.001% quantiles of the resulting distribution were 50.3° and 41.6°, respectively.
Antisymmetry and allometric effects
The occurrence of antisymmetry (AS: a bimodal distribu-

tion of signed ( L − R ) [39]) for centroid size was
investigated within each sample using the Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test for the composite hypothesis of
normality [69]. The independence between size and size
FA within each sample was assessed by a linear regression
of unsigned ( L − R ) against mean centroid size

(L + R)

2 .

Scatter plots of left-right differences for each landmark
after Procrustes superimposition were visually checked to
see whether or not there was evidence for clustering of
these vectors that would have argue for the occurrence of
AS [13,15]. No indication of AS was detected. Finally, to
test for size effects on shape asymmetry within each sample we used multivariate regression of vectors of both
signed and "unsigned" shape asymmetries onto mean
centroid size [13]. Shape asymmetries were not related to
size (P-values > 0.10) and, therefore, no size corrections
were necessary.
Computer software for statistical analysis
The computer programs used for statistical data analyses
were MATLAB (V.6. [72]) together with the collection of
tools supplied by the Statistics Toolbox (V.3. [73]). Some
helpful functions in morphometrics from the MATLAB

were checked with the statistical software packages STATISTICA V.6 [75] and SPSS V.11 [76].
