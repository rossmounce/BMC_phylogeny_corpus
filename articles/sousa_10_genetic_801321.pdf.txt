Abstract
Background: Plasmodium vivax malaria is a major public health challenge in Latin America, Asia and Oceania, with
130-435 million clinical cases per year worldwide. Invasion of host blood cells by P. vivax mainly depends on a type
I membrane protein called Duffy binding protein (PvDBP). The erythrocyte-binding motif of PvDBP is a 170 aminoacid stretch located in its cysteine-rich region II (PvDBPII), which is the most variable segment of the protein.
Methods: To test whether diversifying natural selection has shaped the nucleotide diversity of PvDBPII in Brazilian
populations, this region was sequenced in 122 isolates from six different geographic areas. A Bayesian method was
applied to test for the action of natural selection under a population genetic model that incorporates
recombination. The analysis was integrated with a structural model of PvDBPII, and T- and B-cell epitopes were
localized on the 3-D structure.
Results: The results suggest that: (i) recombination plays an important role in determining the haplotype structure
of PvDBPII, and (ii) PvDBPII appears to contain neutrally evolving codons as well as codons evolving under natural
selection. Diversifying selection preferentially acts on sites identified as epitopes, particularly on amino acid residues
417, 419, and 424, which show strong linkage disequilibrium.
Conclusions: This study shows that some polymorphisms of PvDBPII are present near the erythrocyte-binding
domain and might serve to elude antibodies that inhibit cell invasion. Therefore, these polymorphisms should be
taken into account when designing vaccines aimed at eliciting antibodies to inhibit erythrocyte invasion.

Background
Plasmodium vivax malaria is a major public health challenge in Latin America, Asia and Oceania. Globally, 2.85
billion people are currently at risk of infection [1,2] and
130-435 million clinical cases are estimated annually
worldwide [3]. In the Amazon Basin of Brazil, during
the mid-1980s, P. vivax surpassed Plasmodium falciparum as the most frequent cause of clinical malaria,
and currently P. vivax causes more than 400,000 malaria
cases per year in Brazil [4].
Invasion of host blood cells by different species of
malaria parasites depends on numerous receptor-ligand

interactions. Most parasite proteins known to be
involved in such interactions are highly polymorphic
and are potential targets of naturally acquired immunity.
However, relatively little is known about the patterns of
polymorphisms in surface proteins of P. vivax. Merozoite invasion of erythrocytes by P. vivax relies on an
interaction between a ligand on the parasite and the
Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) on the
surface of erythrocytes [5]. The parasitic ligand is a
micronemal type I membrane protein called Duffy binding protein (DBP), or PvDBP in P. vivax. As demonstrated by a DBP gene-deletion experiment in P.
knowlesi - a malaria parasite closely related to P. vivax
that infects humans and other primates - DBP plays an
important role in formation of the irreversible junction
with erythrocytes, a key step of host cell invasion [6,7].

A series of competitive binding and directed-mutagenesis strategies have demonstrated the importance of the
DBP/DARC interaction [5,7-9]. Moreover, individuals
lacking Duffy receptors on their erythrocytes are highly
resistant to P. vivax invasion [10,11]. Because antibodies
against PvDBP inhibit the DBP/DARC interaction in
vitro and also block the invasion of human erythrocytes
[12-14], this protein is a major candidate for vaccines
against P. vivax. Nevertheless, recent reports that
P. vivax is able to infect and cause disease in Duffynegative individuals suggest the existence of alternative
invasion pathways yet to be elucidated [15-17].
The erythrocyte-binding motif of PvDBP is a 170
amino-acid stretch located in the cysteine-rich region II
of the protein (PvDBP II ). With 93% of PvDBP’s polymorphic residues, PvDBPII is the most variable segment
of the protein [18-20]. Although most of the cysteines
and some of the aromatic residues in PvDBP II are
involved in erythrocyte binding and are evolutionarily
conserved [18,19,21,22], several non-synonymous polymorphic residues within PvDBPII have been identified in
field isolates from Papua New Guinea [23,24], Colombia
[25], South Korea [26], Brazil [27] and Thailand [28].
This observation is consistent with positive natural
selection acting on PvDBP II and with allelic variation
serving as a mechanism of immune evasion.
To formally test this hypothesis in a population genetics framework, several tests of neutrality have been
applied to PvDBPII data (Tajima’s D; Fu and Li’s D and
F; McDonald-Kreitman), and the rates of synonymous
(dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitutions have been
compared based on the method of Nei and Gojobori
(1986). However, these analyses have produced inconsistent results [29,30], and their assumptions are frequently
inappropriate for the data analyzed. For instance, the
Nei and Gojobori (1986) method of estimating dN and
dS ignores either transition/transversion bias or unequal
base/codon frequencies, which may lead to biased
results [31]. On the other hand, phylogeny-dependent
methods based on maximum likelihood estimates of dN
and d S [31] assume no recombination and have been
developed to be applied to sequences from independent,
divergent species, rather than for intraspecific analysis
[32]. In this study, these problems are overcome by a
recently described probabilistic model called omegaMap
[33] to infer whether diversifying natural selection has
shaped the nucleotide diversity of PvDBP II . It uses a
population genetics approximation to the coalescent
with recombination (a natural model choice for population data), and it uses reversible-jump Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) to perform Bayesian inference on
both the dN/dS ratio and the recombination rate, allowing each to vary along a DNA sequence. Being based on
the Nielsen and Yang [34] model of codon evolution,

omegaMap incorporates information about the transition/transversion ratio and codon frequencies from the
data in a probabilistic framework. Specifically, the omegaMap approach was applied to PvDBPII to detect the
action of diversifying natural selection on regions of
PvDBPII containing B- and T-cell epitopes. This population genetics analysis was integrated with computational
modelling of the 3-D structure of PvDBP II , which
showed that several polymorphic residues (three of
which are clearly under positive selection) map close to
the erythrocyte-binding cluster of PvDBPII.

Methods
Parasite isolates and study sites

One hundred twenty-two field isolates of Plasmodium
vivax were obtained from six sites across the Brazilian
Amazon: Cuiabá (Mato Grosso State [MT], n = 25),
Acrelândia (Acre State [AC], n = 25), Manaus (Amazonas State [AM], n = 20), Augusto Correa (Pará State
[PA], n = 18), Porto Velho (Rondônia State [RO], n =
20), and Macapá (Amapá State [AP], n = 14) (see additional file 1: Locations of blood collection in Brazil). Epidemiological data indicate that malaria transmission in
these areas is generally hypo- to meso-endemic [35-37].
The samples were collected from the different regions
as follows: AC, between March and April 2004; AM,
May 2003; AP, November 2004; PA, October 2005; RO,
from October to December 2004; and MT, from July
2003 to July 2004. At the time of blood sample collection, the annual parasite index (API: the number of
positive blood smears per thousand inhabitants) of the
contagion localities allowed these areas to be classified
as high risk (API >50: Augusto Correa/PA and Acrelândia/AC), medium risk (API 10 to 50: Manaus/AM) or
low risk for malaria transmission (API <10: Macapá/AP)
[38]. In these regions, the individuals were locally
infected. However, in Cuiabá/MT and Porto Velho/RO,
individuals were infected elsewhere, and therefore the
risk of malaria transmission reported there was calculated based on the average API from contagion localities. Thus, both localities were classified as high-risk
areas for malaria transmission.
PvDBPII amplification and sequencing

Genomic DNA was immediately extracted from whole
blood samples using the PUREGENE DNA isolation kit
(Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The sequence encoding PvDBPII, corresponding to nucleotides 870 to 1545 (aa
290-515, reference sequence: Sal-I) [39], was amplified by
PCR using high fidelity platinum Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and the primers
forward: 5’ ATGTATGAAGGAACTTACGAAT 3’ and
reverse: 5’ ACCTGCCGTCTGAACCTTTT 3’. The PCR
products were purified using a GFX-96 PCR kit (GE

Sousa et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:334
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/334

Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), and their sense and antisense strands were both sequenced using PCR primers
and the DYEnamic ™ ET dye terminator kit (GE Healthcare). The products were analyzed on a MegaBace automated DNA sequencer (GE Healthcare). Since no
heterozygous sequence variations were observed, it was
inferred that these came from patients with a single infection or from the predominant variant of patients with
multiple infections. All singletons were confirmed by
sequencing from independent PCR amplifications. Six-fold
sequence coverage was achieved for each of the analyzed
isolates. The PvDBP II gene polymorphisms identified
among the Brazilian Amazon isolates were compared to
all DBP gene sequences of P. vivax in GenBank (last
update on 25th February 2010). The PvDBPII sequences
identified here were deposited in GenBank with accession
numbers EU812839 to EU812960. Sequence alignments
and comparisons were performed using the Clustal W
multiple alignment algorithm in BioEdit Sequence Alignment editor using manual editing [40].
Diversity analysis of PvDBPII

To estimate within-population diversity, the numbers of
segregating sites and observed haplotypes were counted.
Estimates of the nucleotide diversity (π), haplotype diversity (Hd), and their corresponding standard deviations
(SDs) were obtained using DnaSP 4.10 software [41].
Between-population differentiation was measured using
the pairwise fixation index FST with Arlequin 3.01 software [42]. The FST index (between-population component of the genetic variance, Wright 1951) was calculated
assuming the Kimura 2-parameter mutation model
[43,44]. The correlation between pairwise population
genetic distances (FST) and geographical distances was
estimated by nonparametric Spearman’s rank correlation.
Analysis of recombination and linkage disequilibrium (LD)

The recombination parameter r among contiguous sites
across PvDBPII was estimated by the method described by
Li and Stephens [45] using PHASE 2.1 software. The parameter r, which can be estimated by different statistical
methods, depends both on the recombination rate and on
the effective population size, and therefore, it is proportional to the number of recombination events per generation that occurred in a population. The algorithm was run
twice with 500,000 iterations, with a 20,000 iteration burnin and a thinning interval of 1,000 iterations. The pairwise
linkage disequilibrium (LD) across PvDBPII was analyzed
using the r2 statistic [46], and its significance was assessed
by calculating LOD (base-10 logarithm of odds) scores.
LD was calculated only for SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.1 in the total Brazilian sample. These calculations were performed and visualized
using the program Haploview [47].

Tests of neutrality

The method developed by Wilson and McVean [33],
implemented in the omegaMap software, was used to
estimate the parameter ω = dN/dS, where dN is the rate
of non-synonymous substitutions and dS is the rate of
synonymous substitutions. Estimates of the parameter ω
are indicators of the action of natural selection on coding sequences. Under no selection ω is expected to be
equal to 1, under negative selection the value is
expected to be significantly less than 1, and under positive selection the value is expected to be significantly
greater than 1. This method employs a Bayesian
approach to parameter estimation that is independent of
phylogeny, and it is therefore less prone to falsely
detecting diversifying selection. The model uses a population genetic approximation to the coalescent with
recombination, and it uses reversible-jump Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to perform Bayesian inferences of both ω and the recombination parameter r,
allowing both parameters to vary along the sequence. In
this study, analyses were conducted using 10 randomly
chosen orderings of the haplotypes and the following
priors: μ (synonymous transversion) = Improper inverse,
 (transition/transversion rate) = Improper inverse, j
(insertion/deletion rate) = Improper inverse. Since ω
requires a proper prior, a log-normal distribution centered on log (ω) = 0 was used with a wide standard
deviation of 2. An average block length of 20 codons
was chosen to be around 10% of the sequence length.
Estimates of the recombination parameter r were
obtained by omegaMap among contiguous sites across
PvDBPII. For r, there is no natural “reference” prior, so
it was used an informative prior based on Gunasekera
et al. [48]: a log-normal distribution with parameters log
(0.1) and 1. As it was expected that there would be less
information regarding r than ω, an average block length
of 40 codons was assumed for r to impose greater
smoothing. Sixteen independent MCMC chains were
run for 90,000 iterations with a 10,000 iteration burn-in.
The chains were compared for convergence and merged
to obtain the posterior distributions. The results showed
the geometric mean for the posterior distribution of ω
and r and the 95% HPD (highest posterior density)
interval. To determine the influence of the choice of
priors on the posteriors, the analyses were repeated with
an alternative set of priors (μ = Exponential mean 0.02;
 = Exponential mean 2.0; j = Exponential mean 0.1; ω
= Exponential mean 1.0; r = Exponential Mean 0.14).
The means for priors for μ,  and r were chosen using
the posterior distributions generated with the first prior
set. A mean value of 1 was used for the ω prior based
on the null hypothesis of selective neutrality.
To integrate the evolutionary analysis with structural
information, the posterior probability of selection at

Sousa et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:334

each codon was mapped onto the 3-dimensional structure of PvDBPII (see below) to visualize the spatial distribution of selected sites. The correlation between FST
for each polymorphism and its ω estimators was calculated using Pearson’s correlation (Minitab statistical software, release 13.20).
Prediction of promiscuous T-cell epitopes

Because only a few epitopes have been described for
PvDBP [30,49], an in silico analysis was used to infer
new and promiscuous PvDBPII T-cell epitopes able to
bind to several alleles of host MHC molecules. To identify the MHC Class-I binding regions in PvDBPII, the
ProPred-I program was used [50]. This program uses
matrices for each of the 47 MHC Class-I alleles the elements of which denote the affinity of antigen amino
acids for specific MHC alleles, thereby allowing peptides
in PvDBP II with antigenic properties to be identified.
Quantitative matrices derived from the published literature [51] and implemented in ProPred were also used to
predict MHC Class-II binding regions in PvDBPII [52].
3-D structural model of PvDBPII

Homology modelling was performed with Modeller 8v2
software using the X-ray structure of the Plasmodium
knowlesi DBL domain as a template (Pka-DBL) (PDB
file: 2C6J, chain A) [53]. This template shares 71%
sequence identity with PvDBPII. The 3-D structure of
PvDBP II was modelled between amino acids 261 and
553. The quality of these models was evaluated with
PROCHECK v.3.5.4 software [54]. Superpositioning
and renderings were carried out with PyMol v1.0
software [55].

Results
Polymorphisms in PvDBPII among Brazilian Amazon
isolates

By sequencing 675 bp of the PvDBP region II of 122
isolates from six Brazilian Amazon regions, 19 polymorphic sites (three synonymous substitutions and 16
non-synonymous substitutions) were identified with an
overall nucleotide diversity of 0.0081 (Table 1 and
Figure 1A). Of 16 sites with non-synonymous polymorphisms, one site at position 386 was not dimorphic.
At this site, lysine could be substituted by glutamine or
asparagine (K386Q/N). A positive correlation was found
between the risk of malaria transmission in each area
(estimated based on the annual parasitic index [API])
and both the nucleotide diversity and the haplotype
diversity of PvDBPII (Spearman correlation coefficients:
rs = 0.811, p = 0.049; rs = 0.828, p = 0.041, respectively).
Most of the non-synonymous polymorphisms were nonconservative (75%) with changes of the physico-chemical

Page 4 of 12

family of the respective amino acid. In a comparison of
the polymorphisms identified in isolates studied here to
the 401 PvDBPII sequences available in GenBank, only
one was recognized as exclusive to Brazilian isolates:
N305N (a synonymous substitution of Asparagine at
position 305), and this was present in 10 isolates from
Amapá (see additional file 2: Table with description of
PvDBPII polymorphisms identified in Brazilian isolates).
The polymorphisms observed in Brazil were arranged
in 34 haplotypes (Figure 1B), corresponding to a mean
haplotype diversity of 0.934 (Table 1). The modal haplotype Hap19 was observed in all six sampled regions.
The FST values of the populations ranged from 2.33 to
30.29%, with the highest values corresponding to the
Amapá population (Table 1). Moreover, the FST values
did not correlate with the geographic distance between
populations (Spearman correlation coefficient r s =
0.0750, p = 0.7905).
Intragenic recombination and linkage disequilibrium in
PvDBPII

In the absence of recombination and recurrent mutation, it would be expected that the 19 polymorphic sites
observed would be arranged into a maximum of 20 haplotypes. Because 34 haplotypes were detected, it was
inferred that recombination (and possibly recurrent
mutation) has shaped the pattern of PvDBPII variation
in Brazilian populations. Figure 2A shows the variation
in the recombination parameter (r) (calculated using the
software omegaMap) along the PvDBPII sequence, indicating that at least one region was clearly affected by
recombination (aa 381-390, lower 95% HPD > 0.1).
These results were further confirmed by estimating the
recombination parameter with PHASE 2.1 software (Figure 2B) and also by identifying regions with low LD
across PvDBPII using the statistic r2 measured with Haploview (Figure 3A).
Consistent with the observed haplotype structure and
r estimates, linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the
PvDBPII sequence is low in the Brazilian isolates (Figure
3A). In fact, an analysis of the 12 SNPs in the whole
sample with a minor allele frequency higher than 0.1
showed that only 8 of 66 pairwise combinations showed
r2 > 0.50. The highest r2 values were observed for several spatially close polymorphisms, encompassing the
SNPs delimited by N417K and I464I (LOD scores always
> 6.64). In particular, three residues within this set were
spatially close in the 3-D model (417, 419 and 424).
Because the LD analysis could be affected by population
structure, the data analysis was repeated without the
Amapá population (the most differentiated population
according to FST value), and an almost identical LD pattern was observed (Figure 3B).

Evidence of natural selection on PvDBPII and its epitopes

To gain insight into the action of natural selection, the
omegaMap approach was used [33], which is suitable
for genomic regions (such as the PvDBPII gene) where
recombination prevents the reliable reconstruction of a
phylogeny. This analysis, which estimates ω and its associated HPD interval, also revealed that natural selection
does not act uniformly within the gene (Figure 4A). The
sequence contains regions where purifying selection
seems to predominate, regions with ω values close to 1
that appear to be neutral or less affected by selection
and regions under positive natural selection (ω >1),
which are mainly in a central region of the protein (aa
368-439). To determine the influence of the choice of
priors on the posteriors, the analyses were repeated with
an alternative set of priors. Estimates for r and ω were
qualitatively similar for the two sets of priors used (see
additional file 3: Recombination and selection parameters in PvDBPII with an alternative set of priors).
Pathogen epitopes are responsible for host immune
recognition. Thus, the association between positive natural
selection and the presence of T- and B-cell epitopes in
PvDBPII was tested (Figure 4A). The results indicated that
ω was higher for sites belonging to B-cell and T-cell epitopes (experimentally identified and predicted) than for
non-epitope sites (Mann Whitney U = 2587.00, p < 0.0001)
[30,49]. The present study therefore showed that positive
natural selection preferentially acts on epitopes in PvDBPII.
In addition, the epitopes in the region showing the highest
ω values also have greater nucleotide diversity (0.011 0.046) than the value for all of PvDBPII (0.0081) (Figure
4B). In particular, nucleotide diversity was the highest in in
silico predicted epitope Ia. Ia contains three spatially proximate polymorphic residues at positions 417, 419 and 424
and shows a clear signature of positive natural selection,
with ω values of 3.72, 3.72 and 3.31, respectively.
Spatial distribution of polymorphisms across PvDBPII

The crystallographic structure of the Pka-DBL bindingdomain was used to produce a computational model of

PvDBP II. In Figure 5A, this model of PvDBP II is presented in space-filling form, and it shows the previously
identified essential, invariant and surface-exposed contact residues required for the recognition of DARC on
human erythrocytes [53], as well as the residues that are
polymorphic in the Brazilian Amazon samples. Although
polymorphic residues were widely distributed throughout the sequence, the polymorphic residues at positions
417, 419, and 424, which are part of a block of high LD,
are close to the erythrocyte-binding cluster of PvDBPII
(Figure 5A). Both K417 and I424 are prevalent in Brazil
as well as in other studied areas (Additional file 2).
The three-dimensional model of PvDBPII also shows
the residues according to the posterior probability of
their estimated ω (Figure 5B). Residues that seem to be
less affected by positive selection (shown in white) were
distributed throughout the protein, and interestingly,
residues associated with high ω (likely to have evolved
under positive selection, shown in green) were close to
(and on the same face of) the proposed DARC-recognition site. Moreover, these residues tend to be in epitope
regions, which were surface exposed (Figure 5C).

Discussion
The data obtained in this study regarding the nucleotide
diversity of PvDBPII among 122 P. vivax isolates from
Brazil provide evidence that (i) recombination plays an
important role in determining the haplotype structure of
PvDBP II ; and (ii) natural selection acts differentially
across the PvDBPII sequence. Indeed, the gene appears
to contain neutrally evolving codons as well as codons
evolving under natural selection, and these latter codons
are associated with high ω values (diversifying selection).
The most striking conclusion of the current study is
that diversifying natural selection acts on one PvDBPII
region containing B- and T-cell epitopes previously
identified and predicted in silico [30,49]. In particular,
the amino acid residues at positions 417, 419, and 424
are associated with high ω values and map close to the
erythrocyte-binding cluster of the molecule.

et al. [39]. The box indicates a substitution exclusive to Brazilian

Diversifying selection has been observed in multiple
proteins involved in parasite-host interactions, and it is
generally attributed to the selective pressure of the
host’s immune response [56]. This study inferred that
the evolution of the ligand domain of PvDBP, particularly of the codons for epitopes 45, 48, 66, Ia, IIa and
IIb, is driven by diversifying selection (as indicated by
high ω values). These epitopes are surface exposed and
have significantly higher nucleotide diversity than the
other residues in this region. However, inferential methods can lack the statistical power to reject neutrality and

detect the action of diversifying selection, particularly
when the analysis is restricted to a few codons such as
epitope sequences. In the present study, this may be the
case for epitopes 5, 16, 18, 20, Ib and Ic. In this context,
the use of appropriate methods for inferring natural
selection is important, and new methods based on more
realistic assumptions about molecular evolution (such as
that of Wilson-McVean) will help to assess the role of
diversifying selection in parasite diversity.
Comparisons with previous analyses

The low linkage disequilibrium (LD) and high recombination parameter across the PvDBPII gene suggest that
meiotic recombination partially accounts for the
observed haplotype diversity. This result corroborates

PvDBP II sequences). However, Cole-Tobian and King
[30] found a low recombination rate in PvDBPII, but the
test used (Sawyer’s permutation test) is not appropriate
for estimating the recombination rate in relatively short
regions like this [57]. The results presented here are
supported by three different analyses: Haploview;
PHASE and omegaMap. These results reinforce the
importance of recombination as well as natural selection
in the generation and maintenance of the genetic diversity of PvDBPII. Multiple recombination events have also
been described in other P. vivax antigens, such as the
Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (PvAMA1), Merozoite Surface Protein-3a (MSP) and MSP-1 [48,58,59].
Previous attempts to infer the action of natural selection in PvDBPII with different neutrality tests yielded
inconclusive results. Martinez et al. [29] used Tajima’s
[60] and Fu-Li’s [61] neutrality tests and found an
excess of rare alleles for PvDBPII, which is consistent
with either the action of a selective sweep or the

Page 7 of 12

purifying natural selection (as suggested by the authors).
A limitation of these tests is that the allelic spectrum is
influenced both by natural selection and by the demographic history of the population, and it is not trivial to
discriminate between the influence of these two variables without significant knowledge of the demographic
history of P. vivax populations, which is not the case. A
second type of neutrality test applied to the PvDBP II
data compares the pattern of synonymous (assumed to
be neutral) and non-synonymous polymorphisms (for
which natural selection is possible). Because the demographic history of a population affects synonymous and
non-synonymous sites equally, these tests are less sensitive to the potential confounding effects of the demographic history of populations. Applications of these
analyses to PvDBPII data include the McDonald-Kreitman test [62] and comparisons between dN and dS estimated using the Nei-Gojobori method [63], and these
suggest the action of positive natural selection acting on
PvDBPII [29,30]. However, the new method of WilsonMcVean [33] has enabled us to map how the action of
natural selection varies across PvDBPII and to integrate
this evolutionary information with an epitope analysis
and structural modelling. Indeed, the Wilson-McVean
method has four features that improve its performance
in correctly identifying the effect of diversifying selection. First, it assumes a more realistic mutational model
[34] that allows for different rates of transitions and
transversions and for differences in codon frequencies.
Second, its fully Bayesian approach allows ω parameters
and their associated HPD intervals to be estimated, providing a measurement of uncertainty. Third (and more
importantly), the Wilson-McVean method uses a reversible-jump MCMC to explore the posterior distribution of ω, allowing it to vary along the length of the
sequence. Although incorporating these more realistic
assumptions implies a computational cost, the analyses
have demonstrated their value. The Wilson-McVean
method allowed us to map how diversifying selection
has acted across PvDBP II and to test the association
between the presence of epitopes and the action of natural selection. Last (but not least), recombination, which
has been important in shaping PvDBPII diversity, does
not affect the performance of Wilson-McVean estimations. These features, the fact that a highly polymorphic
and functionally important region of PvDBP was examined for which results of functional studies are available,
and the complementary structural and epitopes analyses
partially overcome one of the limitations of this study:
the small size of the studied region. A thorough examination of the entire PvDBP sequence in different populations will provide a better understanding of how
natural selection has shaped the different regions of the
gene across different populations, including Brazil.

Polymorphic residues identified in the Brazilian isolates are shown in
blue or red for residues close to or not close to the DARC-binding
domain, respectively. All positions of these residues on the
sequence are indicated. (B) Residues on the 3-D structure are color
coded according to the posterior probability of positive selection as
calculated using omegaMap. Green residues indicate high posterior
probability (HPD > 93%) of positive selection. Codons that seem to
be less affected by natural positive selection (HPD < 93%) are
colored in white. Residues in dark gray were not analyzed by
omegaMap. (C) The previously identified epitopes 45, 48, and 66
[30,49] and the in silico predicted T-cell epitopes IIb, IIa and Ia are
shown in violet. The model’s rotation in the vertical plane is
indicated by arrows.

However, on the basis of the results presented here, it is
anticipated that, if the observed level of recombination
affects the entire gene, signatures of natural selection
might not propagate across large genomic regions.
Therefore, population genetics methods that are able to
examine signatures of selection at localized regions may
be more appropriate for an evolutionary analysis of
PvDBP.
Effects of population structure

In the present study a high level of population structure
was observed, as indicated by high FST values (from 2.33
to 30.29%), and this could affect the estimates of both
linkage disequilibrium and ω. However, when the most
differentiated population (Amapá) was excluded from
the analyses, the same LD pattern was still observed,
which indicates that these results are not an artifact of
population structure. In particular, the residues at positions 417, 419, and 424, which are associated with high

Page 9 of 12

ω values and map near the DARC binding domain in
the structural model, are in LD even when the Amapá
population is excluded from the analysis.
The possibility that the high ω values inferred could
be an artifact of population structure was also investigated. Two features of the data suggest that this is not
the case. First, if there is more differentiation (FST) of
non-synonymous polymorphisms than synonymous
polymorphisms, high ω values may emerge when ω is
estimated with sequences from different clustered populations, but this is not the case in the data presented
here (non-synonymous F ST: 14.7%, synonymous F ST :
24.0%). Second, if population structure creates high ω
values, a correlation between the F ST for non-synonymous sites and the ω values of the codons containing
these sites is expected, but this was not observed (Pearson correlation 0.2647, p = 0.303). Therefore, there is
no evidence that the observed pattern of LD and inferences about positive natural selection are artifacts of the
population structure of our Brazilian samples.
Immunological implications

Plasmodium vivax immune evasion could be explained
by a model based on a “just-in-time” release mechanism
of PvDBP [53,64]. This model proposes that DBP is
released from micronemes immediately before binding
to DARCs, thereby avoiding immune inhibition by direct
binding of antibodies to PvDBP. Therefore, residues on
the surface of the protein that is opposite to that of the
erythrocyte-binding domain remain exposed and are
immune system targets. Supporting this model is a previous observation that polymorphic residues occur on
the opposite side from the erythrocyte-binding domain
[53]. Therefore, from the perspective of population
genetics, it may be expected that positive natural selection imposed by the host’s immune response would preferentially act on the protein surface opposite from the
erythrocyte-binding domain, and values of ω > 1 would
be concentrated on this side of the protein. Because the
results presented here do not match this expectation
(Figure 5), the analysis of the Brazilian isolates does not
support the “just-in-time” release model. Notably, the
results presented here show that stretches with high
genetic diversity and residues under positive selection
are present near the erythrocyte-binding domain. These
results would be expected under a model of immune
escape, in which polymorphic residues near the binding
site elude recognition by inhibitory antibodies, implying
that positive selection acts preferentially on residues
near the erythrocyte binding site. This model is different
from the “just-in-time” model but is not mutually
exclusive.
In fact, the polymorphic residues at positions 417, 419
and 424, which form a unit of LD and are associated

Sousa et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:334
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/334

with high ω values, map to near the erythrocyte-binding
domain. The residue at position 417 was also reported
to be part of a linked haplotype in PNG (N417K,
W437R, I503K) [9]. This model of immune evasion has
been proposed for PvDBP [24,65-67] and also for
PfAMA1 [68]. Recent functional results from Grimberg
et al. [13] support this mechanism and show that antibodies involved in invasion-inhibitory activity also block
PvDBP-DARC interaction. Recently, it was demonstrated
that some epitopes described here (epitopes Ia and IIb)
were also recognized by inhibitory antibodies in immune
sera of individuals from Papua New Guinea as linear Bcell epitopes [69]. These epitopes include residues 417,
419 and 424, suggesting their involvement as targets of
inhibitory antibodies.
Recent data from experimental and natural infections
support our findings that PvDBP polymorphisms might
have immunological relevance. Using rabbit immune
sera, VanBuskirk et al. [9] demonstrated that polymorphisms change the antigenic character of DBP and
can compromise immune inhibition. Moreover, evidence
was found that in the Amazon area, long-term exposure
to malaria is required to allow the production of antiDBP antibodies able to inhibit the binding of different
PvDBPII variants to DARC [12]. These results support
the hypothesis that immune responses against PvDBP
are haplotype-dependent, as has also been proposed for
the apical membrane antigen 1 of P. falciparum
(PfAMA1), another micronemal protein vaccine candidate [70]. However, neutrality tests simply test the
hypothesis that the observed pattern of diversity cannot
be explained merely by the neutral model of evolution,
and may suggest which type of natural selection has
acted. Inferences about natural selection need to be
complemented with experimental tests of the effects of
the observed variations on parasite invasion and
immune escape.

Conclusions
The low LD and the high recombination rates observed
in PvDBPII haplotypes suggest that recombination and
diversifying selection are major factors influencing
PvDBP II haplotype diversity in the Brazilian Amazon
region. The results presented here stress the importance
of using appropriate tests (such as the omegaMap
approach [33]) to infer the relative roles of natural selection and recombination when determining the pattern of
diversity of parasite genes. These genes are often
involved in interactions with host immune systems, and
they are strong candidates for involvement in co-evolutionary processes. However, all methods of inferring the
action of positive selection have limitations [31,33,71].
Therefore, as pointed out by Nozawa et al. [71], it is
important to complement (as in this study) pure

Page 10 of 12

population genetics inferences with information from
structural modelling, in-silico and experimental inferences about epitopes, and functional studies. Taken
together, these results suggest that vaccine strategies
based on inhibitory anti-DBP antibodies that take into
account PvDBPII haplotype variability can overcome the
problem of antigen variability and generate a straintranscending and long-lived vaccine. Moreover, the
recent finding of Duffy-negative individuals infected
with P. vivax emphasizes the importance of a multivalent vaccine strategy that, in addition to eliciting inhibitory antibodies, may also reduce the ability of parasite
strains to escape immunological control.
