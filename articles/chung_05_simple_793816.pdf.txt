Abstract
Background: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was a newly emerged infectious
disease which caused a global epidemic in 2002–2003. Sequence analysis of SARS-coronavirus
isolates revealed that specific genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic. This
information can be used as a footprint for tracing the epidemiology of infections and monitor viral
evolution. However, direct sequencing analysis of a large number of clinical samples is cumbersome
and time consuming. We present here a simple and rapid assay for the screening of SARScoronavirus genotypes based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes for allelic
discrimination.
Methods: Thirty SARS patients were recruited. Allelic discrimination assays were developed
based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes (TaqMan). Genotyping of the SARScoronavirus isolates obtained from these patients were carried out by the allelic discrimination
assays and confirmed by direct sequencing.
Results: Genotyping based on the allelic discrimination assays were fully concordant with direct
sequencing. All of the 30 SARS-coronavirus genotypes studied were characteristic of genotypes
previously documented to be associated with the latter part of the epidemic. Seven of the isolates
contained a previously reported major deletion but in patients not epidemiologically related to the
previously studied cohort.
Conclusion: We have developed a simple and accurate method for the characterization and
screening of SARS-coronavirus genotypes. It is a promising tool for the study of epidemiological
relationships between documented cases during an outbreak.

Background
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a
recently emerged infectious disease which led to a global
epidemic between 2002 and 2003. A novel coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent [1]. The
genomic sequence of the SARS-CoV was promptly characterized [2,3]. Thereafter, studies had focused on the early
detection of SARS-CoV and the development of diagnostic
tools [4-6]. Systematic analysis of the SARS-CoV sequence
information have demonstrated that characteristic viral
genotypes predominated at certain periods during the
course of the outbreak [7-10]. Furthermore, characterization of the viral sequences have been shown to be a useful
tool for confirming epidemiological associations between
infected individuals as suspected from conventional epidemiological investigations [9-11]. In-depth analysis of
the available sequence data on SARS-CoV also revealed
that the viral isolates could be readily subclassified into
several major genotypes based on nucleotide variations at
specific genomic positions [8,12]. In a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV sequences [8], a 5-nucleotide motif at the GZ02 [GenBank :AY390556] reference
nucleotide residues 17,564, 21,721, 22,222, 23,823, and
27,827 was identified to be most useful for distinguishing
the major SARS-CoV genotypes. These major viral genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic
[8]. Thus, it is evident that viral sequence and molecular
epidemiological data provide valuable information and
tools for our combat against infectious diseases. However,
direct sequencing of viral isolates from a large number of
clinical samples is cumbersome and time consuming.
Therefore, a rapid system for the characterization and
screening of viral genotypes, such as for SARS-CoV, would
potentially be useful. In this study, we demonstrate the
feasibility of the adoption of allelic discrimination assays
based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes
for the genotyping of SARS-CoV isolates.

Methods
Study population
Viral culture isolates from 30 SARS patients who were
admitted to the hospitals of the New Territories East Cluster of Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic were
retrieved. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board. SARS was confirmed in all cases either by
positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens or documented seroconversion.
Genotype analysis by Taqman allelic discrimination assay
We focused on the development of allelic discrimination
assays for the five previously described characteristic single nucleotide variations (SNV) [8]. RNA was extracted
from viral isolates cultured from SARS patients' clinical
specimens using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/5/87

Valencia, CA, USA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Eleven microliters of the extracted viral RNA was
reverse transcribed by Superscript III (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) with random hexamer according to
manufacturer's instructions. Genotyping of the five SNVs
was determined using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) allelic discrimination assays on an ABI
Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Each assay consisted of two allele-specific minor
groove binding probes associated with either, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) or VIC™ as the fluorescent label, for the
discrimination of the two respective alleles at each SNV
locus. One assay was designed for each of the 5 SNVs. The
primer and probe sequences, designed using the Primer
Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) are listed in
Table 1. The probes were designed such that the discriminatory nucleotide is placed close to the middle portion of
the oligonucleotide. The assays were set up according to
the manufacturer's instructions (TaqMan Core PCR Kit;
Applied Biosystems) in a reaction volume of 25 µL. Each
reaction consists of 1X Buffer A, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.2 µM
dATP, 0.2 µM dCTP, 0.2 µM dGTP and 0.4 µM dUTP, 900
nM forward and reverse primers, 200 nM of each fluorescent probe, 0.25U UNG, 0.625U Taq polymerase and 0.5
µl of cDNA as template. The thermal profile consists of an
initial incubation at 50°C for 2 min, and then a denaturation period at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation at 92°C for 15 s, and 1 min of combined
annealing and extension at 60°C. The genotypes were
scored with the SDS2.1 software.
Sequence confirmation by direct sequencing
All viral sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing.
RT-PCR was performed to specifically amplify genomic
segments of SARS-CoV encompassing each of the 5 SNVs
using primers and protocols previously described [7]. The
DNA of each amplicon was sequenced by the dideoxy terminator method on an automated DNA sequencer (3100
Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) based on capillary
electrophoresis.

Results and discussion
Taqman allelic discrimination assays for the 5 SNVs were
first tested on synthetic templates (Sigma Genosys, Australia) (Table 1) and verified using 2 viral isolates, CUHKW1 [GenBank :AY278554] and CUHK-Su10 [GenBank
:AY282752]. CUHK-W1 is a SARS-CoV isolate with a
G:A:C:T:C motif at the GZ02 reference nucleotide residues
17,564, 21,721, 22,222, 23,823, and 27,827, characteristic of SARS-CoV strains isolated before worldwide dissemination of SARS [8,13]. On the other hand, CUHK-Su10
demonstrates a T:G:T:T:T motif which is characteristic of
SARS-CoV strains isolated after global spread was evident.
As evident from figure 1, the newly developed allelic

The SARS-CoV genotypes isolated from the 30 patients
were also confirmed by direct sequencing. The sequencing
results were fully concordant with that based on the allelic
discrimination assays at all the 5 SNVs. The seven samples
which gave no allelic signal by the allelic discrimination
assay at SNV 27,827 showed a shortened amplicon
encompassing the region. Direct sequencing of this short
amplicon revealed a deletion of 386 nt identical to a
SARS-CoV deletion variant previously reported by our

group [8,9]. This deletion variant was first isolated from a
discrete cohort of 15 epidemiologically related SARS
patients [9]. In the previous cohort of patients, the origin
of the deletion variant was traceable to mid-April 2003 in
two patients residing in an estate, T, in Hong Kong with
subsequent spread predominantly at the North District
Hospital, Hong Kong [9]. To further determine if the
newly identified cases were epidemiologically related to
the original patient cohort, the case histories were
reviewed.
The seven patients had fever onset between April 4 to 15,
2003 which predated the disease onset dates of all cases in

nt deletion. It is interesting to note that this study provided additional anecdotal evidence pointing to Estate T
as a propagation site for the deletion variant. In addition,
we were able to trace the emergence of this deletion variant to early April 2003, weeks before the first appearance
reported previously [9].

Our study has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of using
allelic discrimination assays as a method for genetic characterization of SARS-CoV genotypes in patients. It is
particularly useful when there is already extensive
sequence information. Direct sequencing is still the gold
standard for identifying new sequence variations when
new agents of infectious disease continue to emerge and
old ones reemerge. Once the variations have been identified, allelic discrimination assay is more efficient and suitable for large-scale population investigations. A recent
study illustrated the use of mass spectrometry-based technology in characterizing SARS sequence variations [14].
However, this method requires post-PCR manipulations
and the availability of specialized equipment. On the
other hand, allelic discrimination assays have been widely
used in the study of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and diseases such as cancers [15]
and rheumatoid arthritis [16]. The validity of the
approach for single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping
has been previously demonstrated [17-19]. Thus, this
study further extended the usefulness of allelic discrimination approach based on fluorogenic oligonucleotide
probes. The approach provides a rapid and simple means
to accurate genotype screening, making it ideal for epidemiological investigations.

Conclusion
We have evaluated a rapid approach for characterizing
SARS-CoV genotypes. The assay is simple, easy to perform
and reproducible. It can therefore be used as an efficient
means to screen for virus genotypes and track the transmission of a particular viral strain in times of epidemics.
Incidentally, we identified a previously reported deletion
variant of the SARS-CoV in a new cohort of patients and
traced the emergence of this variant to an earlier date than
previously reported.

remaining patient was a resident at Estate T and presented
to hospital A with symptoms and signs of chest infection
on April 8, 2003 and SARS was subsequently confirmed.
Thus, it appeared that we have identified another cohort
