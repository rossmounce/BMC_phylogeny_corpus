Anaerobic animals from an ancient, anoxic
ecological niche
Marek Mentel1, William Martin2*
Abstract
Tiny marine animals that complete their life cycle in the total absence of light and oxygen are reported by Roberto
Danovaro and colleagues in this issue of BMC Biology. These fascinating animals are new members of the phylum
Loricifera and possess mitochondria that in electron micrographs look very much like hydrogenosomes, the H2-producing mitochondria found among several unicellular eukaryotic lineages. The discovery of metazoan life in a permanently anoxic and sulphidic environment provides a glimpse of what a good part of Earth’s past ecology might
have been like in ‘Canfield oceans’, before the rise of deep marine oxygen levels and the appearance of the first
large animals in the fossil record roughly 550-600 million years ago. The findings underscore the evolutionary significance of anaerobic deep sea environments and the anaerobic lifestyle among mitochondrion-bearing cells. They
also testify that a fuller understanding of eukaryotic and metazoan evolution will come from the study of modern
anoxic and hypoxic habitats.
Commentary
The newly reported tiny marine animals that complete
their life cycle in the total absence of light and oxygen
are members of the phylum Loricifera, a phylum discovered less than 30 years ago, and they are less than a
millimetre in size [1]. They were collected from a deep
basin at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, where
they inhabit a nearly salt-saturated brine that, because
of its density (>1.2 g/cm3), does not mix with the waters
above. As a consequence, this environment is completely anoxic and, due to the activity of sulphate reducers,
contains sulphide at a concentration of 2.9 mM. Despite
such harsh conditions, this anoxic and sulphidic environment is teeming with microbial life, both chemosynthetic prokaryotes that are primary producers [2], and a
broad diversity of eukaryotic heterotrophs at the next
trophic level [3,4]. That this ecological niche also supports animals is a surprise that poses all sorts of interesting questions. Despite being unexpected, however,
the finding ties together recent developments from several independent fields (marine biology, cell biology,
evolutionary theory and geochemistry) that all point to
the evolutionary significance of eukaryotic life in anaerobic environments.

The first question raised is ‘how?’. How is it possible
that animals can inhabit this anoxic and sulphidic environment? This might seem impossible to some, after all
one often reads that ‘animals have an absolute requirement for oxygen’ [5] or ‘sulphide is poisonous’ [6]. However, not all animals are strictly dependent upon oxygen.
Some use different terminal electron acceptors other
than oxygen in their mitochondrial respiratory chains,
most commonly fumarate, leading to the excretion of
succinate and propionate [7], often accompanied by
acetate excretion as well [8]. Since the mechanism of
sulphide toxicity to animals entails the inhibition of
cytochrome c oxidase [9], mitochondria that are not
dependent upon that final mediator of an electron transfer to O 2 also do not have such a problem with sulphide. Among animal lineages, facultative anaerobic
mitochondria have been studied from various free living
invertebrates, including the oyster Mytilus (Mollusca)
[10], the peanut worm Sipunculus (Sipuncula) [11] or
the polychaete worm Arenicola (Annelida) [12] and
parasites like Fasciola (Platyhelminthes) [13] and Ascaris
(Nematoda) [14]. However, such oxygen-independent
energy metabolism in animals is often restricted to
some stages – albeit sometimes prolonged – of the lifecycle. The Loriciferans that Danovaro et al. [1] describe
spend their entire life cycle in the sediment: what was
once seen as an ‘absolute requirement’ for O 2 among

animals should now be seen as a lineage-specific preference, albeit it one that is very pronounced, especially
among those animals that, like ourselves, live on land,
permanently above the soil line.
Anaerobic mitochondria: more common all the time

A look at the phylogenetic distribution of characterized
anaerobic mitochondria among animal lineages shows
that these are not clustered but spread across metazoan
phylogeny (Figure 1). Are these recent adaptations to
anaerobic habitats or are they holdovers from our more
distant evolutionary past? The biochemistry and the
enzyme equipment used in the facultatively anaerobic
mitochondria of metazoans is nearly identical across
lineages [7,10-15], strongly indicating a common origin
from the metazoan ancestor that might have lived some
600 million years (MY) ago [16]. The examples in Figure
1 cover both the Lophotrochozoa and the Ecdysozoa,
where the newly-described Loricifera with their distinctive organelles belong. Although no biochemical data
are yet available for these intriguing new Loriciferan
mitochondria, from the electron micrographs presented
by Danovaro et al. [1] the organelles look like hydrogenosomes - anaerobic forms of mitochondria that generate H2 and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from pyruvate
oxidation [17] and which were previously found only in
unicellular eukaryotes. Danovaro et al. [1] also report
that the animals harbour structures resembling prokaryotic endosymbionts, reminiscent of the methanogenic
endosymbionts found in some hydrogenosome-bearing
protists; fluorescence of F 420 , a typical methanogen
cofactor [18], or lack thereof, will bring more insights as
to what these structures are.
If we follow the anaerobic lifestyle further back into
evolutionary history (Figure 2), beyond the origin of the
metazoans, we see that the phylogenetic distribution of
eukaryotes with facultative anaerobic mitochondria,
eukaryotes with hydrogenosomes and eukaryotes that
possess mitosomes (reduced forms of mitochondria with
no direct role in ATP synthesis [19]) shows a similar
picture to that seen for animals. In all six of the major
lineages (or supergroups) of eukaryotes that are currently recognized [20], forms with anaerobic mitochondria have been found [21]. The newest additions to the
growing collection of anaerobic mitochondrial metabolisms are the denitrifying foraminiferans [22,23]. For this
group, the underlying enzymes also have yet to be
worked out. However, for the remainder of the eukaryotes summarized in Figure 2, a handful of about a
dozen enzymes make the difference between a ‘normal’
(in the sense of ‘familiar from older college textbooks’)
O2-respiring mitochondrion found in mammals, and the
energy metabolism of eukaryotes with anaerobic mitochondria, hydrogenosomes or mitosomes [7,19,21,24].

Page 2 of 6

Notably, the full complement of those enzymes, once
thought to be specific to eukaryotic anaerobes, surprisingly turned up in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [24], which produces O2 in the light, has typical
O2-respiring mitochondria but, within about 30 min of
exposure to heterotrophic, anoxic and dark conditions,
expresses its anaerobic biochemistry to make H2 [25,26]
in the same way as trichomonads, the group in which
hydrogenosomes were discovered [17]. Thus, Chlamydomonas provides evidence which indicates that the ability
to inhabit oxygen-harbouring, as well as anoxic environments, is an ancestral feature of eukaryotes and their
mitochondria; in that sense it is a true missing link that
unites mitochondria like our own and those from the
anoxic world [19].
It is not yet known what role, if any, the mitochondria
of the newly discovered loriciferans play in the energy
metabolism of those animals and, unfortunately, the
same is true for the myriad of fascinating eukaryotic
protists that inhabit the very same environment where
the anoxic loriciferans were found. In a series of recent
papers, Stoeck and colleagues have surveyed the protistan diversity from L’Atalante and similar habitats with
environmental sequencing and metagenomic techniques
[3,4,27]. Those reports lead to a wealth of representatives from many of the same groups shown in Figure 2
being uncovered: ciliates, fungi and chromalveolates, in
addition to representatives of many other eukaryotic
groups, including the choanoflagellates [3], which are
regarded as the unicellular sisters to the metazoan clade.
The investigation of anaerobic mitochondria remains an
area of rapid progress and it will be a challenge to discover what those mitochondria are doing in real-life
anoxic and hypoxic environments, which are very widespread among modern habitats [28] and where eukaryotic anaerobes abound [27].
Evolutionary significance?

What is the evolutionary significance of the new findings? The L’Atalante basin has been anoxic for only
about 50,000 years [1] but have all of its microbial and
metazoan inhabitants only recently adapted to life in
anoxic conditions during that time? Hardly. Nobody seriously considers that anaerobic prokaryotes dwelling in
such anaerobic habitats, such as methanogens and sulphate reducers, have only recently adapted to anaerobic
niches. The prokaryote inhabitants have existed for well
over a billion years, and have reached this new habitat
by dispersal, not by adaptive evolution de novo and
in situ. Indeed, geochemical evidence has shown that
methanogenesis and sulphate reduction, and the niches
in which they occur, are truly ancient [29,30]. (For marine environments, dispersal is not a fundamental problem because, despite vast distances, similar types of

Loricifera [1] (highlighted in red). It was placed here (dotted line) as branching with Priapulida and Kinorhyncha as reported elsewhere [49,50].
Higher taxon designations are those used in references [48-50]. The Cycloneuralia, where Loricifera belong, are currently grouped within the
Ecdysozoa, which also includes nematodes and insects. To the right of the phylogeny, several species are listed whose facultatively anaerobic
mitochondria have been studied [10-14]; in no way does this imply the absence of anaerobic mitochondira in other groups. No biochemical
data are yet available for the Loriciferan mitochondria [1].

six major clades or supergroups [20], together with information about the mitochondria from some anaerobic, facultatively anaerobic
or parasitic representatives [19,21]. With greater sampling of anoxic habitats [3,4,27], additional information about anaerobic eukaryotes can be
expected. The latest additions are the new species of loriciferan animals (red) from the anoxic L’Atalante basin [1]. LECA: last eukaryotic common
ancestor. Note the absence of primitively amitochondriate lineages among eukaryotes [19,21].

seafloor habitats often harbour similar communities,
from microbes to large animals [31]). However, when it
comes to eukaryotes, there is still a curious tendency to
assume that eukaryotes only invaded anaerobic niches of
late. Perhaps this stems from a tendency (latently
anthropocentric, no doubt) to view mitochondria as
obligately O2-dependent organelles with the anaerobic
forms of mitochondria being rare exceptions, even
though the data (for example in Figures 1 and 2 or elsewhere [7,8,17,19,21]) tell us otherwise. In environments
such as the L’Atalante basin, ‘normal’, O 2 -dependent
mitochondria are the rare exception, if they exist at all,
but eukaryotes abound [1,3,4,32,33]. Hence, further
study of mitochondria from such environments should
be revealing. That, however, is easier said than done,
since, as seen in the present study [1] as in other work
on organisms from anoxic marine sediments [32], a considerable effort has to be invested in order just to
demonstrate that the organisms are even alive and not
just sunken carcasses. Work on organisms from these
environments poses substantial technical challenges,
making every new insight all the more exciting.
While Danovaro et al. opt for the term ‘enigmatic’
in discussing the evolutionary significance of their
findings, we have a decidedly different view. Given
that anaerobic forms of mitochondria are widespread
throughout the eukaryotic world, we see eukaryotes in
anaerobic habitats as evidence for evolution in the
Darwinian sense of descent with modification, with
the traits that support survival in anaerobic environments having been conserved from earlier phases of
Earth’s history. This view is underpinned by what
geologists and geochemists have been trying to tell
biologists over the last 10 years about the prevalence
of anoxic and sulphidic environments during the early
phase of eukaryotic and metazoan evolution, but with
the biologists perhaps not taking as much notice as
they should.
The bigger picture: add geological time

What are the geologists trying to tell us about anoxic
and sulphidic marine habitats? A readable summary of
about 10 year’s progress is given in three papers [34-36].
In a nutshell, the geologists are saying that the rise in
atmospheric oxygen some 2.4 billion years ago is one
thing, but that the oxygen levels in the ocean, where
evolution was taking place, is quite another. Several
lines of isotope evidence indicate that deep ocean waters
were not fully oxygenated until about 580 MY ago,
about the time when the first large animals made their
fossil debut. The reason for this anoxia, they say, has to
do with high levels of sulphide in marine environments,
from the workings of sulphate reducers [36], themselves
strict anaerobes. The message for biologists is that the

Page 5 of 6

Earth’s oceans appear to have been largely anoxic and
sulphidic (like the L’Atalante basin, but not hypersaline)
below the photic zone (the upper about 200 m) [34,36]
and, possibly, also in the lower photic zone [35] for the
time spanning roughly 1.8 billion years ago to about the
beginning of the Cambrian period 560 MY ago. That
was the time during which eukaryotes arose and diversified [21]. Hence, it should hardly be surprising that the
anaerobic lifestyle is widespread among eukaryotic
lineages, right up into the animals [37]. One view is that
the oxygenation of deep environments allowed the animals to become larger [38], which is different from saying that oxygen might in any way be causal to the
Cambrian appearance of diverse animal forms [39].
Geologists have not been trying to hide their perspective
from us biologists [40-42], nor have we biologists been
trying to hide our progress in understanding eukaryotic
anaerobes [21,43-46]. However, it seems that it will still
take some time for a new default view of deep marine
environments in the Late Precambrian – a new synthesis
of sorts – to be accepted by biologists. The scenario is
one of widespread anoxic and sulphidic habitats, almost
certainly (in our view) teeming with little eukaryotic
creatures, all with their mitochondria well suited to life
with little or no oxygen [37] and all more or less like
the ones we see in anoxic and sulphidic environments
today. Such environments staged and witnessed the origin of evolution’s greatest early inventions [47] and the
new insights emerging from them deserve our close
attention.
