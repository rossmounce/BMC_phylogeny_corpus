Abstract
Background: The Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane-bound
receptors with long N termini. This family has 33 members in humans. Several Adhesion GPCRs are
known to have important physiological functions in CNS development and immune system
response mediated by large cell surface ligands. However, the majority of Adhesion GPCRs are still
poorly studied orphans with unknown functions.
Results: In this study we performed the extensive tissue localization analysis of the entire Adhesion
GPCR family in rat and mouse. By applying the quantitative real-time PCR technique we have
produced comparable expression profile for each of the members in the Adhesion family. The
results are compared with literature data and data from the Allen Brain Atlas project. Our results
suggest that the majority of the Adhesion GPCRs are either expressed in the CNS or ubiquitously.
In addition the Adhesion GPCRs from the same phylogenetic group have either predominant CNS
or peripheral expression, although each of their expression profile is unique.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that many of Adhesion GPCRs are expressed, and most
probably, have function in CNS. The related Adhesion GPCRs are well conserved in their structure
and interestingly have considerable overlap in their expression profiles, suggesting similarities
among the physiological roles for members within many of the phylogenetically related clusters.

Background
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be divided into
five subfamilies according to the GRAFS classification system: Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled/Taste2 and
Secretin [1]. The Adhesion GPCRs, also known as long Nterminal seven transmembrane receptors related to family
B (LNB-TM7) and epidermal growth factor seven trans-

membrane (EGF-TM7) receptors. This family is the second largest GPCR family with 33 members in humans
and 30 members in mice and rats. The endogenous ligands are discovered for BAI1, GPR56, CD97 and EMR2,
while the rest of the Adhesion GPCRs remain orphans.

The Adhesion receptors are characterized by long N-termini with complex domain architecture including GPCR
proteolytic site (GPS), epidermal growth factor, thrombospondin, pentraxin, immunoglobulin, olfactomedin,
cadherin domains [2]. Several of the domains in the N-termini have been shown to have cell adhesion functions
and to be responsible for cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix
interactions [3,4]. The GPS domain is thought to be an
intracellular cleavage motif, which is crucial for transport
of the receptor from ER to the membrane [5]. The Adhesion GPCRs are cleaved into two parts: N-terminal and
7TM part with the C-terminal. Nevertheless it has been
reported that the N-terminal is responsible for ligand
binding and is able to re-associate with the rest of the
receptor and in this way initiate intracellular signalling
cascade [6]. The genes coding for Adhesion GPCRs are difficult to study due to their complex genomic structure and
a large number of exons.

phate is also a ligand for EMR2. It is also suggested that
EGF domains in the N-termini of CD97 are essential for
CD55 binding. [15,16]. LEC1, LEC2 and LEC3 on the
other hand are proposed to play more central roles like
synaptic cell adhesion [17] and have a different repertoire
of domains in the N-termini (hormone binding, olfactomedin and galactose binding lectin domains). LEC2 has
been reported to bind α-latrotoxin from black widow spider venom [5].

The Adhesion GPCRs can be divided into seven groups
according to phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1) [2]. The
brain angiogenesis inhibitors (BAIs) 1–3 form group I and
are known to be mainly expressed in the brain. The N-terminal of BAI receptors contains GPS, hormone binding
domain and thrombospondin repeats which are likely to
be involved in the angiogenesis inhibitor function of
BAIs. The role of BAIs in tumor suppression has been
closely investigated as angiogenesis is an essential part of
tumor formation [7]. BAI1 has been recently reported as a
receptor for phospatidylserine involved in recognition
and internalization of apoptotic cells [8]. GPR56 (group
II) is another Adhesion GPCR with a role in tumor development [9]. Mutations in GPR56 have also been reported
to cause human brain malformations [10]. It is described
that GPR56 is able to build complex with cell-surface protein tetraspanin CD81 and Gαq/11 and is able to bind tissue transglutaminase, TG2 [11,12].

CELSR1–3 receptors (group V) have the most complex
domain structure with cadherin repeats, two types of EGF
domains, laminin G and hormone binding domains.
CELSR receptors are thought to have crucial functions in
CNS development. Mutations in CELSR1 cause abnormal
neural tube development in mice [20]. CELSR2 and
CELSR3 seem to have opposite effects in neurite growth
regulation; CELSR2 is enhancing neurite growth while
CELSR3 is suppressing it. [21]. Unlike CELSR receptors,
the members of group VI, GPR133 and GPR144 as well as
group VII, GPR110, GPR111, GPR113, GPR115 and
GPR116 do not have any discovered function.

GPR64 also called HE6 (group II), unlike GPR56, has its
only known function in the periphery and disruption of
this gene results in mouse male infertility [13]. The very
large G-protein-coupled receptor (VLGR1) is important
for normal development of auditory hair bundles in the
inner ear [14]. The functions of other five members of
group II are not known.
The Adhesion receptors forming group III can be divided
into two groups according to the architecture of their Ntermini. EMR1, EMR2, EMR3, EMR4, CD97 and ETL
receptors have all a variable number of epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and calcium binding domains and are
reported to be important components of the immune system [2]. EMR2 and EMR3 are missing in the mouse and
rat genomes. CD55 and chondroitin sulphate have been
described as ligands for CD97, while chondroitin sul-

GPR123, GPR124 and GPR125 belong to group IV of
Adhesion GPCRs. GPR123 has been reported to have specific expression in the brain [18]. GPR125 was recently
presented as a stem cell marker with a possible therapeutic
use [19]. Both these receptors have protein-protein interaction domains in the form of leucine rich repeats, while
GPR124 and GPR125 have immunoglobulin domains in
N-termini as well.

The majority of Adhesion GPCRs are poorly studied, with
specific expression patterns and physiological functions
yet to be discovered. Until today, the published expression data on many Adhesion GPCR members is limited to
a few tissues and is performed by different methods with
varying sensitivity. Therefore, an overall expression analysis of Adhesion GPCRs is useful for comparison of expression and identifying specific patterns. It is also an
important step towards finding the functions of the
poorly studied receptors.
In this study we report an extensive tissue localization
analysis of the entire Adhesion GPCR family in rat and
mouse. By applying the quantitative real-time PCR technique we have produced comparable expression patterns
for each Adhesion family member. We have compared
expression patterns between rat and mouse and recent in
situ hybridization data for mouse from the large Allen
Brain Atlas project [22] as well as human and mouse ESTs
[23]. We describe similarities in Adhesion GPCR expression patterns between rat and mouse as well as within
groups of Adhesion GPCRs.

A phylogenetic tree, N terminal domains and general expression of Adhesion GPCRs. A consensus phylogenetic
tree of 7TM regions of mouse Adhesion GPCRs was generated by Maximum – Likelihood analysis (Phylip 3.67). The N-terminal
domains of Adhesion GPCRs are as follows: GPS (GPCR proteolytic site), PTX (Pentraxin domain), HBD (hormone binding
domain), EGF_Lam (laminin type epidermal growth factor domain), EGF_CA (EGF, calcium binding domain), LamG (laminin G
domain), CA (cadherin repeats), Ig (immunoglobulin domain), LRR(leucine rich repeat), Calx-beta domain, CUB (C1r/C1 s urinary EGF and bone morphogenetic domain), SEA (sea urchin sperm protein domain), TSP1 (thrombospondin repeats, type 1),
OLF (olfactomedin domain) and GBL (galactose binding lectin domain). The displayed predominant expression is based on
obtained real-time PCR data.

Results

Discussion

The mouse Adhesion GPCR gene sequences were downloaded from GenBank (Additional File 2) and 7TM
regions were identified with Conserved Domain Database
[24]. The tree calculations were carried out using ClustalW
alignment of TM regions, which was bootstrapped 100
times and distances were calculated with PROML from
Phylip 3.67 package. The Maximum-Likelihood consensus tree is presented in Figure 1.

In this paper we present for the first time the expression
chart of 30 members of Adhesion GPCRs in mouse and rat.
Together with EST data from human and mouse [23] and
previously published Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization data [22] this provides the most comprehensive
information about the expression pattern of the Adhesion
family of GPCRs (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

We performed an expression analysis of 30 rat and mouse
Adhesion GPCR family members in a range of central and
peripheral tissues. Seven coronal sections of rat brain
(Additional file 1), a number of brain regions and peripheral tissues were isolated from mice and rats and used for
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis. The expression values
of four housekeeping genes were used to calculate normalization factors for mouse and rat cDNA. Relative
expression values displayed as a fold increase from the
detected minimum expression for rat and mouse Adhesion
GPCRs are presented in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Expression
of BAI1 and BAI2 from group I was detected only in brain
regions of rat and mouse. BAI3 transcripts were detected
mostly in brain, with very low levels in some peripheral
tissues (Figure 2). The expression data of BAI receptors is
in agreement with previously published results [25,26].
GPR56, GPR64, GPR126 and VLGR1 from group II were
detected in central and peripheral tissues, whereas GPR97,
GPR112, GPR114 and GPR128 were detected in peripheral tissues (Figures 2, 3 and 6). The members of group III
LEC1, LEC2, LEC3 and ETL were expressed ubiquitously
in both rat and mouse, whereas LEC2 and LEC3 had
higher levels in CNS compared to levels in the periphery
(Figure 4). The members of group III CD97, EMR1 and
EMR4 were detected mostly in peripheral tissues and at
very low levels in the brain (Figures 4, 5). The expression
profile of receptors from Adhesion group III is in agreement with previous reports [27-31]. The member of group
IV GPR123 displayed central expression, while the other
members GPR124 and GPR125 showed ubiquitous
expression (Figure 5). The members of group V CELSR2
and CELSR3 were detected mainly in CNS, while CELSR1
was found both in central and peripheral tissues (Figure
6). These results confirmed previously published expression data of CELSR receptors [32,33]. Group VI member
GPR133 was detected in both CNS and periphery (Figure
6). GPR144, which is a pseudogene in rat, was not
detected in any of the examined mouse tissues (results not
shown). Group VII members GPR110, GPR111, GPR113
and GPR115 were detected in only few peripheral tissues
(Figure 7). GPR116 was detected in all analyzed tissues,
except blood, but mainly at low levels (Figure 7).

Adhesion receptors is an evolutionary conserved group, for
example an Adhesion like genes have been described in
fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) [34] and in the choanoflagellate (Monosiga brevicollis) [35]. According to our phylogenetic analysis based on TM regions of Adhesion
receptors they formed seven groups (Figure 1), which is in
agreement with previously published studies [2]. Despite
that phylogeny was based only on TM regions the N-termini of the receptors in each group had similar domain
types and organization. Surprisingly, our results showed
that the members within each group also share considerable similarities in their expression profiles (Figure 1). So
according to our results group I with BAI1, BAI2, BAI3;
group IV with GPR123, GPR124, GPR125; group V with
CELSR1, CELSR2, CELSR3 and even LEC1–3 and ETL1
which form a cluster within group III showed predominant expression in the brain of rat and mouse (Figures 2,
4, 5 and 6).
The Adhesion GPCR group containing GPR123, GPR124
and GPR125 is one of the least studied groups. The
detailed CNS profile of GPR123 was recently published by
Lagerström et al. with some indications of important neuronal functions [18]. It is therefore very exciting that our
results display wide expression in the rat and mouse brain
for all 3 members of this group. In contrast to GPR123,
which displayed specific central expression, GPR124 and
GPR125 displayed also very wide peripheral expression
(Figure 5). It is very interesting that both the human and
mouse ESTs for GPR125 are detected in stem cells and it
was recently reported that GPR125 could be used therapeutically as a stem cell marker for generation of vessels
[19]. The N-terminals of GPR124 and GPR125 contain
GPS, leucine-rich repeats, Ig domain and hormone binding domain in contrast to GPR123, which is lacking all of
these domains. It is therefore tempting to speculate about
if any of these domains have a role in peripheral actions
of GPR124 and GPR125. Other proteins with leucine-rich
repeats like LINGO-1 and LRRK2 have been shown to play
a role in structural and functional integrity of neurons
involved in Parkinson's disease [36]. The members of this
group are present in teleosts [18], amphioxus and fruit fly
(unpublished data). As this group is present within most
species with a nervous system and have a wide CNS
expression, members from this family could have their
main function within the CNS.

Similarly to the centrally expressed Adhesion GPCR genes,
the genes expressed predominantly in peripheral tissues
are also found in phylogenetic clusters. High levels of
GPR128 transcripts were detected in stomach, and all
parts of intestine. This is in agreement with the observation that the highest number of ESTs for GPR128 from
human and mouse are found in the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract (Figure 3). The GPR128 is unlikely to play a role in
immune system regulation as it is not detected in high levels in immune system specific organs. The GI specific
expression profile of GPR128 could possibly indicate a
function in cell migration during development of GI tract
endothelium. Two other genes from group II, GPR97 and
GPR114, were also expressed in the GI tract but they were
also detected at high levels in thymus, spleen and blood
(Figure 3). In addition, the highest number of ESTs for
these genes was detected in immune cells, spleen and
bone marrow. Altogether this indicates that GPR97 and
GPR114 most probably are involved in functions of
immune system in humans and rodents.
GPR56, GPR64 and GPR126 from Adhesion GPCR group
II displayed ubiquitous expression (Figures 2, 3). GPR56
is most studied of these receptors. It is reported to play a
role in development of human cerebral cortex [10] as well
as tumor development [12]. According to our results, the
expression of GPR56 is highest in mouse pancreas and rat
kidney. GPR64 has been described to regulate the function of the male reproductive system [13]. Our results
together with data from Allen Brain Atlas [22] display
expression of GPR64 in hypothalamus, brain stem, substantia nigra and spinal cord. This was surprising to us as
several publications have described GPR64 as an epididymal specific receptor. Therefore it is likely that GPR64
could also have an additional function in CNS.
Mutations in VLGR1 are known to cause audiogenic seizures in mice [37]. Hence VLGR1 expression in embryonic
CNS is widely described not only in mammals but also in
other vertebrates like zebrafish [38]. Interestingly, our
results indicate that there are common expression sites of
VLGR1 in zebrafish embryo and adult rat such as hypothalamus and eye (Figure 6). Such similarity in expression
patterns between mammals and teleosts points at remarkable conservation of function of the VLGR1 receptor during vertebrate evolution.
GPR133 and GPR144 are relatively recently discovered
[39] and poorly studied Adhesion GPCRs. The presence of
GPR133 like sequence (XM_001197663) in purple sea
urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) indicates a long evolutionary history and an important physiological function. The expression of GPR133 was highest in intestine,
skin, adipose tissue and olfactory bulb (Figure 6), which
points toward a function in periphery. The inability to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/43

detect GPR144 transcripts in mouse tissues verifies that
GPR144 is a murine pseudogene.
GPR116 is the only member of the Adhesion GPCR group
VII with ubiquitous expression (Figure 7). The expression
profile of GPR116 with highest transcript levels in lung,
olfactory bulb and heart is most similar to the ETL and
CD97 receptors. This could be a sign of functional similarities between these receptors. GPR110, GPR111 and
GPR115 have common expression site in the rat eye. Two
of these receptors, GPR111 and GPR115 also share expression in the rat skin. These receptors have similar structure
in their N-termini and similar protein length. It is possible
that these receptors play a role in similar peripheral functions like epithelial cell adhesion in eye epithelium and
skin.

Conclusion
It is remarkable that phylogenetic clusters of Adhesion
GPCRs seem to have either predominant central or
peripheral expression in rat and mouse tissues. Though, it
is also clear that within the phylogenetic clusters the
expression profiles are not identical as Adhesion GPCRs are
expressed in a large number of tissues. If we analyze the
functions of the well studied Adhesion GPCRs, it is evident
that even if the receptors from the same phylogenetic cluster do play roles in similar physiological processes, they
do not have the same function and sometimes can even
have opposite functions. One possible explanation for
this is that Adhesion receptors are very well conserved during evolution and sub-functionalization was a common
process among phylogenetic clusters of Adhesion GPCRs.
Adhesion receptors participate in highly complex processes
like development of nervous system and immune system
response. These processes require often a strict sequence
of steps with different types of adhesion molecules participating at the different stages. Altogether the Adhesion
GPCRs are a unique and fascinating family of membrane
receptors with conserved evolutionary history and a
number of vital physiological functions.

Methods
Animal handling and tissue isolation
A number of adult male and female 129sv mice and
Sprague-Dawley rats (Scanbur, BK AB) were kept in separate air-conditioned rooms (12 h dark/light cycle) at 22–
23°C in an air humidity of 55%. The animals had free
access to water and food pellets (Labfor, Lactamin, Sweden). These conditions were maintained for 7 days, and at
the end of the period the animals were sacrificed by
decapitation (rats) or cervical dislocation (mice) between
3 and 6 hours into the light period. All animal procedures
were approved by the Uppsala Ethics Committee and followed the guidelines of European Communities Council
Directive (86/609/EEC). Different brain regions and

Page 11 of 14

BMC Neuroscience 2008, 9:43

peripheral tissues were isolated. With regard to the rat
brains, they were taken out immediately after decapitation. Two whole rat brains were sliced into coronal cross
sections (approximately 3 mm thick) using a rat brain
matrix (Pelco International, Canada) as presented in Fig.
1. The remaining rat brains were dissected in more detail.
The entire hypothalamus was carefully removed by lifting
it from the brain with a slightly curved forceps. Thereafter
the following regions were manually dissected with the
guidance of a rat brain atlas (Paxinos G., Watson C., 1997.
The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press,
San Diego, CA): prefrontal cortex, motor cortex and hippocampus. The first section (approximately bregma 5.20–
4.20 mm) was denoted prefrontal cortex. Motor cortex
was collected from sections approximately between
bregma 4.20–2.70 mm and included primary and secondary motor cortex. The hippocampus was collected from
several sections and therefore comprised the hippocampus CA1–3 and the dentate gyrus. The tissues were
immersed into RNA-later solution (Ambion, USA), kept at
room temperature for 1 hour and thereafter stored at 80°C until further processed.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Individual tissue samples were homogenized by sonication in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Sweden) using a Branson sonifier. Chloroform was added to the homogenate,
which was then centrifuged at 10 000 g at 4°C for 15 minutes. The water phase was collected and RNA was precipitated with isopropanol. The pellets were washed with
75% ethanol, air dried and dissolved in RNAse free water.
DNA contamination was removed by treatment with
DNAse I (Roche Diagnostics, Sweden) at 37°C for 4 h
where after the DNAse I was inactivated by heating the
samples to 75°C for 15 minutes. Absence of DNA contamination in the RNA was confirmed by PCR and RNA
concentration was determined using a Nanodrop® ND1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Delaware, USA). cDNA was synthesized with M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, Sweden) using random hexamers as primers according to the manufacturers' instructions. The quality of the cDNA was confirmed by PCR.
Primer design and evaluation
Sequences for rat and mouse house keeping genes and all
known Adhesion GPCR gene sequences were downloaded
from GenBank. GenBank accession numbers are presented in Additional File 2. All primers were designed
with Beacon Designer v4.0 (Premier Biosoft, USA) and
positioned within TM regions of the Adhesion GPCRs. The
primers sequences for rat and mouse Adhesion GPCRs and
house keeping genes are displayed in Additional File 2.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
The cDNA was analyzed in quantitative real-time PCR
with a MyiQ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Sweden). Each real-time PCR reaction with a total volume of
20 µl contained cDNA synthesized from 25 ng of total
RNA; 0.25 µM of each primer, 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.4),
50 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, SYBR Green
(1:50 000). Real-time PCR was performed with 0.02 u/µl
Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Sweden) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 4 min,
followed by 50 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 55–62°C for 30 s
(optimal annealing temperature) and 72°C for 30 s. This
was followed by 84 cycles at 55°C for 10 s (increased by
0.5°C per cycle). All real-time PCR experiments were performed in duplicate. A negative control for each primer
pair and a positive control with 25 ng of rat and mouse
genomic DNA, respectively, was included on each plate.
Data analysis and relative expression calculations
MyiQ software v 1.04 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Sweden) was
used to analyse real-time PCR data and derive threshold
cycle (Ct) values. Melting curves were analysed to confirm
that only one product was amplified and that it was different from the negative control. LinRegPCR [40] was used to
calculate PCR efficiencies for each sample. After that
Grubbs' test (GraphPad, USA) was applied to exclude the
outliers and calculate average PCR efficiency for each
primer pair. The delta Ct method [41] was used to transform Ct values into relative quantities with standard deviations and the highest expression was normalized to 1.
The GeNorm software [42] was used with results from
four housekeeping genes in order to calculate normalization factors for every tissue to compensate for differences
in cDNA amount. Thereafter the normalized quantities
were calculated and minimum expression was set to 1. All
relative expression values were displayed as fold increase
from the detected minimum expression.
