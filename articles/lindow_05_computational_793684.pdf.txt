Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small (20–25 nt) non-coding RNA molecules that regulate
gene expression through interaction with mRNA in plants and metazoans. A few hundred miRNAs
are known or predicted, and most of those are evolutionarily conserved. In general plant miRNA
are different from their animal counterpart: most plant miRNAs show near perfect
complementarity to their targets. Exploiting this complementarity we have developed a method for
identification plant miRNAs that does not rely on phylogenetic conservation.
Results: Using the presumed targets for the known miRNA as positive controls, we list and filter
all segments of the genome of length ~20 that are complementary to a target mRNA-transcript.
From the positive control we recover 41 (of 92 possible) of the already known miRNA-genes
(representing 14 of 16 families) with only four false positives.
Applying the procedure to find possible new miRNAs targeting any annotated mRNA, we predict
of 592 new miRNA genes, many of which are not conserved in other plant genomes. A subset of
our predicted miRNAs is additionally supported by having more than one target that are not
homologues.
Conclusion: These results indicate that it is possible to reliably predict miRNA-genes without
using genome comparisons. Furthermore it suggests that the number of plant miRNAs have been
underestimated and points to the existence of recently evolved miRNAs in Arabidopsis.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), 20–25 nucleotides in length, are
involved in negative post transcriptional regulation in
most multi-cellular organisms (for a review see e.g. [1,2]).
The generality and importance of this recently discovered
regulatory mechanism is gradually becoming apparent,
and here we present computational evidence for new miRNAs indicating that their numbers are more abundant
than previously believed, and argue that they play a major
role in evolution.

Most of the miRNAs identified so far are conserved in
other species, some remarkably well[3]. Previous computational screens for miRNA have relied on this evolutionary conservation to identify a few hundred putative
miRNAs in vertebrates[4], C. elegans[5], and plants [6-8],
and many have been experimentally confirmed (reviewed
in [9]). However, these screens miss all miRNAs that have
diverged since the last common ancestor of the genomes
under comparison. A recent study using a combined bioinformatic and high-throughput experimental approach

have identified 53 miRNAs not conserved beyond primates[10]. In plants, where comparisons have been
between the distantly related A. thaliana (thale cress) and
O. sativa (rice) genomes that diverged some 200 million
years ago[11], it is probable that there are miRNAs which
have escaped detection. Of the 112 Arabidopsis miRNAgenes currently registered[12], only 56 are conserved in
the monocot rice (see methods section), indicating the
existence of a substantial number of unconserved miRNAgenes. miRNA and short interfering RNAs (siRNA) are
very similar in function, but different in biogenesis.
According to the current nomenclature[13] both microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are
20–25 nucleotides long single stranded molecules that
arise from processing of double stranded RNA (dsRNA)
precursors. They are distinguished by the type of dsRNA
they are excised from. While siRNAs come from long exogenous or endogenous dsRNA molecules (very long hairpins or RNA duplexes), mature miRNAs come from the
stem region of shorter hairpins.
The mature miRNA or siRNA forms part of the RNA
induced silencing complex (RISC) that binds to mRNAs.
miRNA/siRNAs that bind with almost perfect complementarity to an mRNA often results in the cleavage of its
target. Currently it seems that the higher the degree of
complementarity to a target mRNA, the larger chance of
that target being degraded. miRNAs with imperfect complementarity to a 3' untranslated region of a mRNA have
been shown to inhibit translation of the mRNA[14,15]
When the base pairing between the miRNA and the target
is incomplete it is non-trivial to identify targets for a
miRNA [16-19]. In plants, however, most of the known
miRNAs pair almost perfectly with one or more mRNAs,
making it straightforward to identify likely plant targets
(miRNAs often have more than one target). Using this
observation it is possible to predict miRNA candidates in
Arabidopsis that exhibit near perfect base pairing with the
targets, without relying on homology to other organisms[20]. Here this idea is extended and refined to yield a
highly specific screen that finds plant miRNAs in numbers
much larger than previously thought.

Results and discussion
Identification of non-conserved miRNAs
The general approach is outlined in figure 1. Initially, a
mRNA is compared with the genomic sequence to identify
matching regions of 20–27 nucleotides with at most 2
mismatches (allowing 3 mismatches produced more than
10 000 matches per mRNA). These are called micromatches, and the genomic part is referred to as a genomic
match. An average mRNA gives rise to about 1000 such
micromatches, the vast majority (often all) of which we
assume are spurious non-miRNA hits. However, it is pos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/119

sible, without comparing to other genomes, to filter the
micromatches and achieve highly specific and fairly sensitive predictions of miRNA genes (Figure 1).
Six filters were used to identify a base set of genomic
sequences as candidate miRNAs (with percentages of the
initial micromatches that were remaining after each filter
given in brackets): (1) they had high sequence complexity
(26.9%); (2) they had no overlap with annotated exons
on the same or the opposite strand (3.3%); (3) they had
no overlap with repeat sequences defined by RepeatMasker (2.6%); (4) the putative miRNA:mRNA duplex should
be relatively stable[17,21] with a calculated free energy of
less than -34 kcal/mol (0.20%); (5) they had no more
than identical 10 copies in the genome (0.19%), to eliminate repeated sequences not detected by standard repeatmasking; and (6) the miRNA was contained within a precursor structure that was similar to those observed in
known Arabidopsis miRNA precursors, i.e. was predicted to
be largely contained (at least 16 paired bases) within the
stem of a double stranded stem-loop structure whose stem
was predicted to have a free energy less than -60 kcal/mol,
with at least 4 paired bases flanking the putative miRNA,
and an intervening loop larger than 9 but less than 130
bases (0.0002%).
Although the base set predictions have a low number of
false positives (see below), they can be even more refined
to identify a subset of the predictions with extra confidence, because the probability of more than one mRNA
matching a falsely predicted miRNA is minimal, unless
the matching mRNA-targets are close homologs (in which
case the multiple targets do not add much extra confidence). Most of the known miRNA in Arabidopsis are
thought to have multiple targets often within the same
family of homologous proteins[22]. If a known miRNA
only has targets in a highly conserved protein family this
filter can however be expected to falsely eliminate them.
In order to check the validity of our approach we took the
mRNA targets of the known miRNAs and set out to see if
using these as queries we would be able to correctly identify the known miRNA-genes. Of the 112 precursor
sequences registered in RFAM (ver 5.1), we were able to
map 92 perfectly to the current RefSeq assembly (TIGR ver
5.0) of the Arabidopsis genome; the remaining precursors
were excluded from the positive control set. Likely targets
for Arabidopsis miRNAs have previously been predicted
allowing for up to 3 mismatches[23]. Repeating this procedure we find that our known miRNAs match 142 different annotated mRNA*. These are the positive control
targets (refered to a 'known targets') and many have been
experimentally confirmed[24,25]. Initially, the 142
mRNAs in the positive control set yielded 359,976 micromatches after removal of low complexity sequences.

those that have more than one target. See text for more details.

Hundreds of novel miRNAs
Applying the micromatcher procedure to all 28860
mRNAs annotated in Arabidopsis identifies 592 miRNA
candidate loci (480 families) in the base set (Additional
file 1). In the final step this is reduced to a set of 90 (70
new) when more than one non-homologouos target per
miRNA is required. This is called the multi-target set and
is a subset of the base set.

density

However, the filtering procedure reduces this dramatically
to 45 different loci (41 of which are already known) representing 16 different families (14 known). Assuming that
the 'unknown' loci we find are false positives the procedure has 91% specificity and 45% sensitivity on the level
of loci identified. Using the refinement step requiring
more than one non-homologouos target only true positives are found, but at the expense of halving the sensitivity to 22%. The validity of the estimates of specificity and
sensitivity is discussed below.

All miRNA gene predictions, their targets (with some basic

ESTs and 52 of the predicted precursors contain a 20-mer
sequence tag from the Arabidopsis MPSS database[27].
Evolutionary conservation of the predicted miRNA-genes
From an evolutionary point of view, it would seem to be
a lot easier to adapt 20 bases in a miRNA for a new target
than to evolve a protein for a specific regulatory task.

For mammals it has been suggested that the more targets
a microRNA has the more likely it is to be conserved[28]
because of the additional constraints of having to match
multiple targets.
Indeed also for plants: comparison of our predictions in
Arabidopsis to two other plant species reveals that the more
targets a miRNA is predicted to have, the more likely it is
to be conserved (Figure 2). Although no Brassica species is
yet completely sequenced and we had to use a conjunction of all single sequence Brassica entries from GenBank,
significantly more of the predicted miRNAs are conserved
in Brassica than in rice, indicating that many miRNAgenes have diverged beyond recognition since the divergence of monocots and dicots approximately 200 million
years ago.

Figure 2
false micromatches
Duplex energy is a strong discriminant between true and
Duplex energy is a strong discriminant between true
and false micromatches. The procedure was started with
142 mRNAs targeted by known miRNAs. Micromatches
were filtered for low-complexity, overlap with exons and
repeats. Then the remaining micromatches were divided in
two bins: true positives (green trace) that overlap with
known miRNA genes and false positives (red trace) that do
not.

Thus, we speculate that the highly conserved miRNAs are
likely to be central regulators, often of many target
mRNAs (imposing the evolutionary constraint to stay
conserved), and are more likely to be highly expressed.
Whereas more recently evolved miRNA would have fewer
targets, and a more localized spatiotemporal expression,
making them less likely to be detected by cloning efforts.
Since evolutionary conservation is part of many of the previous discovery procedures, it is likely that the set of
known miRNAs is biased towards those that are conserved, and our data suggest that in fact, miRNAs evolve
fast and are less conserved than e.g. protein-coding genes.
It has been proposed that some miRNAs originate from
inverted duplication of target sequences, exemplified by
the single locus miRNAs miR-161 and miR-163, which
have precursors that show extended homology to the target mRNAs also outside the mature miRNA sequence[29].
However, our structural filters require that the match

between miRNA and target is in the range 20–25, effectively eliminating such miRNA with extended homology.
Comparison to other studies
Of the predicted 592 precursors in the base set, 29 overlap
with the 92 predictions made by Bonnet et al.[30], and 4
of those by Wang et al.[8]. Thus, the different methods
complement each other: The present method based on
matching targets and miRNA is capable of finding nonconserved
miRNAs,
whereas
the
interspecies
comparisons[8,31] can find miRNAs without obvious
targets.

The idea to use potential targets to find miRNA-genes has
recently been employed in two other studies. Xie et al.
[32] started by finding frequently occurring subsequences
of human 3' UTR sequences conserved in other mammals
and successfully searched the genome for new miRNA
genes.
Moreover Adai and coworkers[33] published results in
Arabidopsis using potential targets to find new miRNAgenes. However, our approach differs significantly from
theirs in the way the matches (that we term micromatches) are analysed and the kind of conclusions that
can be drawn: Adai et al. looks for a 'cluster' of miRNAgenes that target the same sequence of a mRNA, and then
aligns the candidates in such a cluster, scoring the alignment high if it shows a characteristic pattern where the
miRNA and miRNA* are more conserved than the intertwining sequence. Thus, their method is limited to finding
miRNAs that occur more than once in the genome, presumably as a result of duplication events. Moreover as a
postfilter, Adai et al. require conservation in rice to generate their short-list used for experimental validation. Also,
Adai et al. do not make any estimation of the specificity of
their computational procedure and are consequently unable to speculate about the number of miRNAs.
In contrast our method is independent of whether a candidate has been duplicated in the genome or is conserved

across species. Instead our aggressive filtering on the
structural properties of the precursor enables us to make
highly specific prediction (judging from the results using
targets for known miRNAs as queries).
The multi-target miRNAs have a total of 528 different
mRNA targets, which are involved in a variety of functions, but there is a notable over-representation of proteins with transcription factor activity and receptor
binding activity as well as involvement in developmental
processes (false discovery rate < 0.001, see Additional file
2). The predicted miRNA-genes are generally found scattered throughout the genome (Table 2). Unlike in mammals where 90 out of 232 miRNA-genes are within introns
of protein coding genes [34], there is only one previously
discovered Arabidopsis microRNA situated in an intron.
This trend of plant microRNAs to be outside protein-coding genes also holds for our baseset predictions and even
stronger for the multiple target predictions (Table 2).
Although estimating the sensitivity and specificity on the
basis of the ability to correctly identify the small set of
known miRNAs carries the danger of biasing, the presently most important concern must be not to massively
overpredict new miRNA-genes. In constructing the filters
we have therefore aim at high specificity at the expense of
sensitivity. While false positives undoubtfully remain, the
fact that the predictions share the properties of functional
overrepresentation and bias of genomic location (properties not selected for in the filters) with known miRNAs
provides independent indication that we indeed do not
massively overpredict new miRNA-genes.
It is becoming evident that many regions between protein
coding genes are transcribed (e.g. [35,36]). Indeed given
the cases of miRNAs that have been suggested to regulate
other miRNAs[37] or RNAs that guide methylation
DNA[38], it would be interesting to extend our filtered
intragenomic match approach to identify other possible
miRNAs whose targets are not mRNAs.

Conclusion
The present analysis predicts 71 new Arabidopsis miRNA
genes with very few false positives (estimated specificity is
100%) and over five hundred with an estimate of 9% false
predictions. The procedure misses some real miRNAs,
such as those encoded in untranslated regions of genes,
those with very many targets (classified as repeats by our
method), and those not fulfilling our strict structural constraints, and we believe that the real number could be several thousands. Although, the predictions should
eventually be confirmed in the lab, our data suggest that
the Arabidopsis genome encodes substantially more
miRNA genes than previously thought, and that the
number of miRNAs is comparable to the number of protein transcription factors. Our results also indicate that
many miRNA are specific to small groups of related species and we speculate that they could play a part in speciation. Finally we find it unlikely that these conclusions are
specific to plants, and we hypothesize that they extend to
most other multicellular organisms.

Methods
Sequences
Arabidopsis genome and annotation were the RefSeq
sequences based on the 5.0 version released by TIGR.
Known miRNAs were from the 5.1 release of the microRNA registry[39].
The micromatcher procedure
Finding all micromatches
For each annotated spliced mRNA we exhaustively
searched the genome for micromatches of length at least
20 with maximum 2 mismatches (no gaps allowed) using
the suffixarray based program vmatch[40] (This search
took 6 days on an Intel Xeon 2.2 Ghz machine running
Linux).

Figure 3
Multi target predictions tend to be better conserved
Multi target predictions tend to be better conserved.
The precursor sequences of the predictions were used as
queries for a blast search against rice (downloaded from
tigr.org, March 2004) or brassica (downloaded from arabidopsis.org, August 2004), respectively. Columns show the
proportion of miRNA predictions in Arabidopsis that were
found to be conserved. Numbers refer to the actual number
of conserved miRNA predictions.

Note about the positive control set of mRNAs: To select
the positive control mRNA-targets we allow for 3 mismatches over the whole length of the mature miRNA; this
potentially includes in the positive control set mRNAs
that will be unable to recover the matching miRNA allowing only 2 mismatches over a length of 20 bases (the criterion used later). This discrepancy can lead to a too
pessimistic estimation of the performance of procedure.
Lowcomplexity filter
Genomic micromatches not fulfilling a simple low complexity filter were discarded: 1) all four bases had to be
present at least once, and 2) at most 11 of the three most
frequent dinucleotides in the sequence were allowed.
Duplex stability
Using the program RNAcofold (Vienna RNA package[41])
the free energy change when a microRNA-candidate binds
to a target site was calculated. Micromatches where this
duplex energy is larger than -34 kcal/mol were discarded.
Long matches
Micromatches longer than 26 residues were discarded. To
ascertain that a micromatch was not part of a longer
match, the two parts of the micromatch extended by 50
bases to each side were aligned with bl2seq (two sequence

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:119

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/119

NCBI blast), and those with a match longer than 26 were
discarded.

Taken together these structural criteria constitute a highly
selective, but somewhat conservative filter.

Overlaps with known features and repeats
A micromatch was discarded if it had any bases in common with annotated exons (including matches to the
reverse strand of the exon) or repeats as determined by
RepeatMasker[42] run with Arabidopsis specific repeat
libraries (RepBase Update 8.12, RM database version
20040306).

Matches to ESTs and ASRP
BLASTN was used to search all Arabidopsis ESTs downloaded from GenBank on September 27, 2004. Hits
longer than 70 nucleotides with more than 95% identity
between a predicted precursor and an EST were considered positive. Sequences cloned and sequenced as part of
the Arabidopsis Small RNA Project (ASRP)[44], were
downloaded from [45]. All matches at least 15 long with
at most one mismatch with our predicted mature miRNAsequences were found using vmatch[46].

Copy number
Additionally to traditional repeat-masking that relies on
the identification of known repeats, we made an additional pragmatic repeat filter: We simply determined the
number of times all candidate sequences occurs in the
entire genome, and removed candidates with a copy
number higher than 10.
Filtering on properties of the possible precursor
In order to predict a possible precursor molecule, two
genomic sequences around each micromatch were
extracted: One starting 10 bases 5' of the micromatch and
extending 240 bases 3' of the micromatch, and one with
the extension lengths reversed. Each of these was treated
independently in the following analysis. First the potential precursor sequence was folded with RNAfold[43] to
find the minimum free energy structure These values are
comparable, because all sequences are of almost equal
length. Candidates with a folding free energy larger than 60 kcal/mol are discarded. This is a highly permissive filter. The mature miRNA has to be fully contained in a double stranded region of the precursor. The complementary
part of the miRNA in this stem is denoted miRNA*. It is
demanded that all base pairs between the miRNA and the
miRNA* are pairing in the same direction opposite each
other. The number of paired bases in the mature miRNA
is required to be 16 or more.

In the known miRNA precursors, the stem is always longer
than just the length of the mature miRNA. To find how far
the stem of a candidate extends from the mature miRNA,
we count how far inward towards the loop or outwards
toward the ends of RNA-string the stem extends using the
following algorithm: Moving out from the terminal basepair between miRNA and miRNA* a score of 1 is assigned
for each base pair encountered and a score of -1 for each
unpaired base. The extension is stopped when the current
score is less than 5 lower than the maximum score so far.
The last base pair is considered the terminus of the stem.
Candidates with extensions less than 4 bases on either
side of the mature miRNA were discarded. It was also
required that the shortest number of bases between the
miRNA and miRNA* were larger than 9 and less than 130.

Conservation in other genomes
To determine how many of our predictions were conserved in other plant genomes, we blasted the predicted
Arabidopsis precursors against the rice-genome and brassica
sequence downloaded from [47]. A miRNA prediction
was taken to be conserved if it had a significant (e-value <
0.01) blast hit containing the mature miRNA with no
more than 2 mismatches and the homolog had flanking
sequence capable of folding back on the mature miRNA
with at least 15 base pairs between the miRNA and
miRNA*.
The number of non-homologous targets for a putative
miRNA
For all candidate microRNAs in the baseset matching
more than one mRNA, we found the number of different
non-homologous targets by performing single linkage
clustering on the aminoacid sequences of the corresponding mRNAs using the program 'blastclust' from NCBI.
Two proteins were considered homologous if they had
more than 70% identity across at least 50% of the length.
Clustering of micromatches into genomic loci
Micromatches with genomic start position within 4 nucleotides were logically grouped into the same locus.
Clustering of similar miRNA sequences into families
We used the program vmatch[48] to align and perform
single linkage clustering of the predicted mature miRNA
sequences. Candidate pairs aligning over at least 17 bases,
allowing an edit distance of 1 were grouped in the same
family.
Functional analysis of targets
We obtained gene ontology annotation (GOSLIM) from
[49]. From each GOSLIM category we constructed a 2 × 2
contingency table counting the number of targets vs nontargets with or without the GOSLIM annotation. We used
R[50] to calculate p-values with Fisher's Exact Test and
employed the package 'qvalue'[51] to correct for multiple
testing setting a false discovery rate level at 0.001. The
