Abstract
Background: Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes a wide variety of life threatening diseases in
humans and the incidence of such infections is high in developing countries like India. Although
distribution of emm types of GAS in India has been described, there is a lack of data describing
either the comparative distribution of emm types in throat versus skin isolates, or the distribution
of certain virulence factors amongst these isolates. Therefore in the present study we have
monitored the emm type pattern of Group A streptococcus throat and skin isolates from India.
Additionally, the association of these isolates with closely related sic (crs), a multifunctional
compliment binding virulence factor, was also explored.
Results: Of the 94 (46 throat and 48 skin) isolates analyzed, 37 emm types were identified. The
most frequently observed emm types were emm49 (8.5%) and emm112 (7.5%) followed by 6.5%
each of emm1-2, emm75, emm77, and emm81. Out of 37 emm types, 27 have been previously
reported and rest were isolated for the first time in the Indian Community. The predominant emm
types of throat (emm49 and emm75) samples were different from those of skin (emm44, emm81
and emm112) samples. After screening all the 94 isolates, the crs gene was found in six emm1-2
(crs1-2) isolates, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing and expression analysis. Despite the
polymorphic nature of crs, no intravariation was observed within crs1-2. However, insertions and
deletions of highly variable sizes were noticed in comparison to CRS isolated from other emm types
(emm1.0, emm57). CRS1-2 showed maximum homology with CRS57, but the genomic location of
crs1-2 was found to be the same as that of sic1.0. Further, among crs positive isolates, speA was only
present in skin samples thus suggesting possible role of speA in tissue tropism.
Conclusion: Despite the diversity in emm type pattern of throat and skin isolates, no significant
association between emm type and source of isolation was observed. The finding that the crs gene
is highly conserved even in two different variants of emm1-2 GAS (speA +ve and -ve) suggests a
single allele of crs may be prevalent in the highly diverse throat and skin isolates of GAS in India.

Background
Group A streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes)
causes various diseases ranging from mild impetigo, pharyngitis and scarlet fever to more severe and serious sequelae such as rheumatic fever (RF), rheumatic heart disease
(RHD) and acute glomerulonephritis [1]. The incidence
of severe GAS diseases is high in children aged between 5–
15 years and is more common in developing countries
[2]. The prevalence of RF/RHD is known to vary from 0.3
to 5.4 children per 1000 in India [3].
Diversity in GAS strain is reflected not only among types
of strains circulating in a particular community, but also
the virulence factors associated with them [1]. GAS
express a variety of virulence factors such as M protein,
Streptolysin O and S, C5a peptidase, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spe), streptococcal protective antigen
(Spa) and streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC).
Some of these virulence factors like Spa [4] or SIC [5] are
found to be restricted in their distribution to specific emm
types.
The complement binding protein, SIC, was first described
by Akesson et al, 1996 [6] in M1 and later its variants were
reported in M12, M55 and M57 [5,7]. Originally, SIC was
characterized as an inhibitor of complement function that
interferes with the function of the membrane attack complex by binding to one or more protein components associated with the complex. Subsequently SIC has also been
shown to inhibit antimicrobial activity of lysozyme, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI), α and βdefensins, and Cathelicidin LL-37, which are components
of the innate immune system [6,8,9].
The gene encoding SIC (sic) is highly polymorphic, both
between different emm types and within strains of the
same emm type [10]. Two forms of this gene have been
identified, the closely related sic gene (crs) present in
emm1 and emm57, and distantly related sic gene (drs) isolated from emm12 and emm55 [5]. Despite previous
reports suggesting crs is associated with only emm1 and
emm57 GAS isolates, Ma et al (2002) reported the association of the crs gene with other emm types including
emm2, emm4, emm12, emm28, emm75, emm89, emm94
and emm112, leading to question about the distribution
of crs [11].
Information regarding the circulating emm type is available from community screening [12] as well as from hospital data [13,14] in India. However, there is a lack of
information regarding the distribution of emm types
among strains isolated from different sites (throat and
skin) and their virulence factors. Earlier, we have reported
the presence of toxins [15] in GAS strains from our country and very recently, unraveled the conserved nature of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/150

other form of sic i.e. the drs gene [16]. Except for the presence of variable numbers of repeats, drs was found to be
conserved not only within Indian isolates but also within
the isolates from other countries. Here, we have explored
for the first time the presence of the crs gene in emm1-2
isolates of Group A streptococcus from throat and skin
infections. Although this study showed the conserved
nature of the crs1-2 gene among Indian isolates, unlike
drs, crs1-2 was found to be highly polymorphic when
compared to isolates from other countries.

Results and discussion
Characterization of GAS strains by emm typing
For the first time, the emm type distribution of both throat
and skin isolates of Group A streptococcus from India was
studied and compared. 94 isolates associated with either
throat or skin were categorized into 37 different emm
types (Table 1). The majority of throat isolates were of
emm49 and emm75, whereas emm44, emm81 and emm112
were mostly associated with skin infection. Only eleven
emm types were found to be common in both throat and
skin isolates. The distribution of emm types among throat
and skin samples was different to the study of McGregor
et al (2004) which involved samples belonging to geographic regions far away from Indian subcontinent [17].
However our data is quite similar to reports from other
Asian countries, such as Japan [18] and Nepal[19].

The most frequently observed emm types (Table 1) among
all isolates in this study were emm49 (8.5%), emm112
(7.4%) followed by 6.3% of emm1-2, emm75, emm77 and
emm81. These most frequent emm types were not only different from previously reported most prevalent emm types
in India [12-14] but also from epidemiological studies of
isolates from other countries like Japan [18], Taiwan [20],
Germany [21], Australia [22] and United States [23]. The
difference in the most prevalent emm types of this study in
comparison to earlier Indian reports may be due to the
fact that the most prevalent serotypes within a population
changes over time, which can be predicted by continuing
surveillance [24]. Additionally, in this study both throat
and skin isolates were studied, whereas earlier studies,
involved throat samples only. Out of 37 emm types, 27
have been described in earlier reports from India, where as
16 were identical to emm types reported from Hong Kong
[25] and interestingly, 29 to emm types of Ethiopia [26].
Identification for the first time of new emm types associated with skin infections in the Indian community further
justifies the inclusion of skin isolates in this study.
On the basis of differences in amino acid sequence of the
test strain from the parent strain in the type specific region
of the emm gene, 37 types were subdivided in to 38 subtypes [27]. This observation is in contrast to the report
available from Mexico where 31 types were differentiated

into 66 subtypes [28]. In this study, out of 37 types only
six isolates of emm81 could be divided into two subtypes
i.e 81.1(3) and 81.2(3) (Table 1).
This study involved a small sampling of isolates from one
area of a highly diverse country. The diversity in emm types
reflect the extent of heterogeneity which exists among the
strains prevalent in India. Only 11 emm types of this study
correspond to emm types used in multivalent vaccine that
is under trial in the USA [23]. This supports the development of a multivalent vaccine specific for this particular
region covering all emm types prevalent in the Indian
community. However development of such strategies

Screening of isolates for the crs (closely related sic) gene
To elude the host defense and establish infection, GAS
produces a number of virulence factors, including streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC). The polymorphic
extra cellular complement binding protein SIC has not
only pathological but also epidemiological significance.
We have studied the sic gene distribution by screening
ninety four GAS isolates. The six emm1-2 isolates (Table 1)
were positive for the presence of the crs gene (crs1-2) specific ~830-bp fragment (Fig 1A), while in Japan the sic
gene was isolated from 10 different emm types [11]. Therefore, the isolation rate (6.5%) of the crs gene in this study
was found to be less compared to a study (77.3%) made
in Japan [11]. Our data reports for the first time the presence of the crs gene from emm type 1–2, which is a distinct
type, not a subtype of emm1.0.
crs gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis
The crs gene product was further confirmed by sequence
analysis using modified internal primers [29], which
yielded a 912 bp full-length crs gene sequence (Accession
number EF543156 – EF543161). The six crs positive isolates did not show intravariation either at the DNA or at
the amino acid level. However, like sic1.0, crs1-2 also possessed a short repeat region (SRR), central long repeat
region (LRR) and C proximal Proline rich region (PRR) as
reported earlier [6]. A number of mutations such as insertions and deletions were observed in CRS1-2 throughout
the sequence in comparison to SIC1.0 [6] and CRS57 [7].
Similar to SIC1.0, a deletion of five amino acids
(GWSGD) was observed in CRS1-2 in comparison to
CRS57 at position 40. However, an insertion of 27 amino
acids (EWPEDDWSEDDWSNDYWSKYSWSSDKE) at
position 82, similar to CRS57 in comparison to SIC1.0
has been noticed in CRS1-2. On the other hand a deletion
of 29 amino acids (GALGTGYEKRDDWGGPGTVATDPYTPPYG) at position 165 makes CRS1-2 unique from both
CRS1.0 and CRS57 (Fig 1B). Insertion and deletion
sequences monitored in CRS1-2 in comparison to SIC1.0
and CRS57 is different from the 29 amino acid insertion
(PPYGGALGTGYEKRDDWGGPGTVATDPYT) and the 31
amino acid deletion (GLSKYDRSGVGLSQYGWSQYGWSSDKEEWPE) sequence, most commonly observed in
different alleles of sic1.0 [29]. It is likely, because this gene
is under strong natural selection pressure [10], and as such
harbors significant sequence variation and is highly divergent. The high number of allelic variations in sic is likely
due to the fact that humans mount antibody response to
SIC, a process that enhances variation by selecting escape
mutants [30]. It is also reported that human anti-SIC antibodies are directed against virtually all regions of SIC that
are highly polymorphic in natural population, which fur-

ther strengthen the antibody mediated SIC diversification
[31]. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig 1B) indicates the variant
of SIC, CRS1-2, is more closely related to CRS57 [7]
reported from Australia compare to SIC1.0 [6] reported
from Sweden (Fig 1B). This correlation raises the possibility that crs57 may have originated from emm1-2 instead of
emm1.0.
Expression of crs gene at protein level
The secreted proteins from all emm1-2 isolates were seen
in SDS-PAGE (12%) and specific antisera was used for
western blot analysis which confirmed the expression of
CRS1-2 from all these isolates. All six emm1-2 isolates (3
throat and 3 skin) showed the CRS specific protein of 34KDa similar to emm1.0 (Fig 1C).
Genomic location of crs 1.2 gene
In emm1.0, the crs gene is located within the mga regulon
whereas it is located outside the mga regulon in emm57. In
this study a PCR based method [6] was applied to find the
genomic location of crs1-2. The amplified product of size
1.2-kb and 2.2-kb obtained by using primer pair P1 – P2
and P3 – P4 [6] respectively indicated the genomic location of crs1-2 to be the same as for crs1.0 (Fig 2A &2B). An
additional PCR based analysis, which showed a 400-bp

Screening of sic positive isolates for speA
To examine the presence of other virulence factors, sic positive isolates were screened for the phage encoded virulence factor speA, which is also known as a source of
diversity in these GAS strains [10]. Association of the speA
gene with sic positive isolates only from skin infection
(Fig. 3) genetically differentiated them from throat isolates. This suggests the identification of two variants [10]
of sic positive isolates, carrying the conserved crs gene.
These two variants (spe A positive and negative), not only
belong to different sources (throat and skin) but also to
different regions of North India, and were also collected at
different time periods.

Conclusion
In the present study, we found that, although emm type
pattern among throat and skin isolates was different but
no significant association between emm type and source
(throat and skin) was observed. Out of 37 different emm

fragment by using primer pair P5 – P6 [7] further confirmed this observation (Fig 2C). Since emm1.0 and
emm1-2 shares majority of alleles, as shown by MLST analysis [17], therefore such similarity in the genomic location
of crs1-2 and sic1.0 is not unexpected.

types, only six emm1-2 isolates were positive for crs gene
validating its highly restricted distribution. Although no
intravariation was observed in the crs1-2 gene, a large
number of allelic variations were observed in the crs1-2
gene in comparison to crs genes reported from other countries. This suggests the crs gene is highly divergent in comparison to drs. Moreover, variation in virulence
characteristics like possession of speA in skin specific isolates not only differentiated emm1-2 isolates in two variants, but also reflects that virulence may be source
specific, not type specific. The presence of conserved sic in
these isolates further suggests a single allele of crs may be
prevalent in the GAS isolates of Indian community, showing diverse emm type distribution in throat versus skin isolates.

Methods
Bacterial Strains
Group A streptococcus isolates (94) from throat (46 cases,
comprising 36 from pharyngitis, nine RF/RHD and one
Chorea) and Skin (48), were already available in the
Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and
Research, Chandigarh (India). Skin samples used in this
study were collected during year 2000 – 2004 after obtaining ethical clearance from Institute ethics committee,
Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research,
Chandigarh, from patients presenting with any suppura-

tive skin lesion, wound, burn or rectum infection. However the throat isolates were collected from the throat of
symptomatic patients (Pharyngitis, RF/RHD and Chorea)
between the years 1995 and 2004. All these isolates were
collected from hospital (Postgraduate Institute of Medical
Education and Research, Chandigarh) as well as community screening (rural and urban slum) near Chandigarh
after getting consent from parents.
emm typing
emm gene sequencing was performed as previously
reported [12]. DNA sequences were subjected to homology search against the bacterial DNA database http://
www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/strepblast.htm. Pairwise comparison of the nucleotide homology for the first
160 bases of the hyper variable region of the emm gene
was conducted to designate emm type to a particular
strain. Types and subtypes were designated as described
earlier
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/strep
blast.htm.
Identification and Sequence analysis of crs
Published primers [5] were used for the screening of the
sic (crs) gene in GAS isolates. The complete crs gene was
amplified and sequenced by using a different set of published primers [29]. A Specific internal primer was
designed (ACCTAAGACCGAACAATCACCA) for crs1-2
sequencing. Sequencing was carried out in an Automated

DNA sequencer, model number 310, Applied Biosystems,
USA. Sequence data was compared with those already
deposited in the Data bank by using clustal X program
[32].
Western blot analysis of CRS protein
GAS cultures were grown for 8 hrs and centrifuged at
10,000 × g for 10 mins. Supernatant proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration)
at -20°C for approximately 20 mins. To retrieve the precipitated proteins the mixture was centrifuged at 16000 ×
g for 20 mins. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 M NaOH. After running SDSPAGE (12%), CRS protein was identified by using a specific antibody as described previously [7].
crs gene location in genome
The location of the crs gene on the mga regulon was
mapped by PCR using primer pairs (P1 – P2, P3 – P4 and
P5 – P6) that were designed from sequence flanking the
crs gene [6,7].
