Abstract
Background: Mutualisms are inherently conflictual as one partner always benefits from reducing
the costs imposed by the other. Despite the widespread recognition that mutualisms are essentially
reciprocal exploitation, there are few documented examples of traits that limit the costs of
mutualism. In plant/seed-eating pollinator interactions the only mechanisms reported so far are
those specific to one particular system, such as the selective abortion of over-exploited fruits.
Results: This study shows that plant chemical defence against developing larvae constitutes
another partner sanction mechanism in nursery mutualisms. It documents the chemical defence
used by globeflower Trollius europaeus L. (Ranunculaceae) against the seed-eating larvae of six
pollinating species of the genus Chiastocheta Pokorny (Anthomyiidae). The correlative field study
carried out shows that the severity of damage caused by Chiastocheta larvae to globeflower fruits
is linked to the accumulation in the carpel walls of a C-glycosyl-flavone (adonivernith), which
reduces the larval seed predation ability per damaged carpel. The different Chiastocheta species do
not exploit the fruit in the same way and their interaction with the plant chemical defence is
variable, both in terms of induction intensity and larval sensitivity to adonivernith.
Conclusion: Adonivernith accumulation and larval predation intensity appear to be both the
reciprocal cause and effect. Adonivernith not only constitutes an effective chemical means of
partner control, but may also play a key role in the sympatric diversification of the Chiastocheta
genus.

Background
Conflicts of interest are frequent in interspecific mutualisms [1,2]. Plant/seed-eating pollinator mutualisms
involve a plant pollinated by an insect whose larvae
develop upon the plant's seeds. In these nursery pollination mutualisms, the conflict lies in the number of seeds

eaten by the pollinator's larvae that therefore will not contribute to the plant's fitness [3-6]. As a consequence, evolutionary theory predicts that plants evolve traits that limit
the costs imposed by the insect partners. Despite this
broad prediction, attempts to identify mechanisms of
partner control in nursery mutualisms have so far fell

short in pinpointing a general mechanism. Pellmyr &
Huth [7] showed that the selective abortion of fruits in the
Yucca - Yucca moth interaction was an effective defence
against the developing larvae, but this mechanism was
found in only one of the three Yucca - Yucca moth systems
studied by Adicott & Bao [8]. Selective abortion may not
provide a general explanation for the stability of this
mutualism [9]. Instead, density-dependent mortality in
oviposition-induced 'damage zones', a characteristic specific to this system, may be a more important mechanism
in terms of the regulation of the interaction [10]. Selective
fruit abortion is also part of the Silene latifolia-Hadena
bicruris interaction [11,12]. Holland's investigation of the
Senita cactus - Senita moth system [13] found no evidence
of selective abortion but suggested that excess flower production followed by massive fruit abortion might actually
increase a plant's male fitness, rather than serving to control seed predation by pollinator larvae. In the fig-fig wasp
system it is theoretically possible that several mechanisms
for reducing the plant's costs coexist [14]. The geometry of
the fig seems to play a crucial role in limiting the intensity
of the damage inflicted by wasp larvae. Indeed, fig wasps
preferentially oviposit in the inner ovules and avoid the
outer ovules [15] presumably because the wasp larvae
which develop in the outer ovules are more exposed to
parasitoids that oviposit from outside the syconia than
the larvae developing in the inner ovules [16]. The use by
plants of chemicals to kill non-mutualistic pests or limit
the damage they cause is a very common phenomenon
[17,18] which may also play a role in mutualistic interactions. So far however, the importance of induced plant
chemical defence in partner control has not been
explored.
Here we studied the interaction between the European
globeflower Trollius europaeus (L.) and its seed-eating pollinators Chiastocheta spp. (Pokorny) and tested whether
plants can limit seed predation through chemical defence.
The European globeflower Trollius europaeus L. (Ranunculaceae) is an arctic-alpine perennial species growing in
moist meadows. Each individual typically produces a single yellow flower composed of around 10 tightly-closed
sepals which form a globose corolla that contains approximately 10 nectariferous staminodias, 30 multiovulate
carpels, and numerous stamens that sequentially dehisce
throughout flower longevity (typically 5-9 days [19,20]).
In the Alps, the plant is passively pollinated by six species
of Chiastocheta flies (Anthomyiidae): C. rotundiventris
Hennig, C. dentifera Hennig, C. inermella Zetterstedt, C.
macropyga Hennig, C. setifera Hennig, and C. trollii Zetterstedt. Chiastocheta flies are the only pollinators of T. europaeus and Chiastocheta larvae feed only on T. europaeus
seeds [21,22]. The female deposits one or several eggs on,
or between the carpels, at various flower stages depending
on the species [19,21]. Shift in oviposition time among
species ranges from 2 days to one week [23]. Egg mor-

phology, colour and position on the fruit make it possible
to assign them to a species [24], except for C. trollii and C.
setifera that cannot be distinguished based on egg features.
The early ovipositing fly species C. rotundiventris visits
young, unpollinated flowers, and typically deposits just
one egg per flower. The late ovipositing species C. dentifera
lays several eggs on pollinated, fading flowers. After
hatching, larvae develop on seeds throughout fruit maturation (about 4 weeks). Larvae from each species have a
specific location in the globeflower complex fruit, composed of several follicles (hereafter referred to as carpels,
Figure 1). The larva of the early ovipositing species C.
rotundiventris is found in the floral receptacle; it enters several carpels successively through their bases and eats one
to several seeds in each carpel, so that many carpels are
damaged by this species. In contrast, the larva of the late
ovipositing species C. dentifera is found in one single carpel and consumes most of its seeds, thereby inflicting only
limited damage to the carpels. The larvae of the intermediate species forage their way through several carpels
inflicting various levels of damage to carpels (Figure 1). At
the end of their development, the larvae exit the fruit and
drop into the soil to overwinter as pupae.

The globeflower cannot respond to over-exploitation by
Chiastocheta larvae with the selective abortion of parasitized fruits, as it only produces one to three flowers per
blooming, whereas yucca and senita cactus produce hundreds of flowers. Nor is the selective abortion of parasitized carpels an option because developing larvae move
freely from one carpel to another.
We hypothesize that the accumulation in the globeflowers
carpel walls of a luteolin based flavonoid, adonivernith
(luteolin 8-β-d-glucopyranosyl-2"-O-d-xylopyranoside)
with increasing number of developing larvae in the fruit
[25] is a mechanism of partner control. Indeed, the unparasitized fruits (artificially protected from ovipositing flies)
contain significantly lower amounts of adonivernith than
the parasitized fruits, suggesting that this compound is
induced by larvae infestation and will act as a defence
compound. Unfortunately, as Chiastocheta larvae cannot
be reared on an artificial medium, this hypothesis could
not be confirmed by means of in vitro toxicity experiments. However, other flavonoids have been identified as
active inhibitors of larval growth on the larvae of the corn
earworm (Heliothis zea [26], the autumnal moth Epirrita
autumnata [27], and the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda [28,29]). In other cases, flavonoids have been
described as feeding deterrents against the American butterfly Pieris napi oleracea [30], the stink bug Nezara viridula
[31], the storage pest Sitophilus zeamais [32], and the mustard leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae [33]
We hypothesise that adonivernith, the most abundant
phenolic compound found in the carpel walls of T. europaeus, constitutes a chemical plant defence against Chiastocheta larvae by acting as a larval growth inhibitor or as a
feeding deterrent. We predict that the accumulation of
adonivernith in the carpel walls following larval damage
will limit seed predation per damaged carpel. Moreover,
several species of Chiastocheta coexist in T. europaeus populations. They all feed on globeflower's seeds (which do
not contain adonivernith [25]), but differ in terms of their
exploitation pattern inside the fruit [23] and in the level
of damage inflicted to carpels. Each Chiastocheta species
may induce and react to adonivernith in a specific way.

In order to test whether adonivernith induction is a means
for globeflowers to control seed predation by pollinators'
larvae, we carried out a field study on T. europaeus flowers
in which we left only one egg of one of the different Chiastocheta species present (Figure 1). We dissected the fruit
after full larval development and measured the mass of
the larva, the number of damaged carpels, and the
number of seeds eaten. We also estimated the fruit's seed/
ovule ratio and the concentration of adonivernith in the
carpel walls. More specifically we asked the following
questions: Is adonivernith concentration correlated with
the level of larval damage to the plant? Is adonivernith
concentration correlated with larval mass? Is adonivernith
concentration correlated with the number of seeds eaten?
How do the Chiastocheta species differ in terms of adonivernith induction? Is the plant's chemical defence as efficient to control the different Chiastocheta species?

Results
Adonivernith concentration and the intensity of larval
damage
The variation in adonivernith concentration between
individual plants was wide enough to carry out the statistical analysis (range 0.12-1.01 mg/g, mean 0.48 mg/g,
coefficient of variation 0.32). Adonivernith concentration
positively correlated with the number of damaged carpels
when considering all species together (Linear Model LM,
t1,152 = 2.75, p = 0.007, Table 1 & Figure 2). Although not
significant due to the small sample size and high variability, the correlation was also positive when the species were
analysed separately, except for C. setifera/trollii (Table 1).
The seed/ovule ratio was not dependent on the number of
damaged carpels (Generalised Linear Model GLM, binomial family, t1,152 = 0.107, p = 0.91).
Larval traits and adonivernith concentration
There was no link between larval mass and adonivernith
concentration in the carpel walls when the species were
pooled (ANOVA, F1,137 = 0.0044, p = 0.94) nor when they
were analysed separately (not shown, p > 0.12 in all
cases). Similarly, there was no link between the total
number of seeds eaten per larva and adonivernith concentration when the species were pooled (ANOVA, F1,152 =
0.0018, p = 0.96) nor when they were analysed separately

(not shown, p > 0.51 in all cases). However, when the
number of seeds eaten per damaged carpel was considered,
adonivernith had a negative effect (LM, t1,151 = -4.44, p <
1E-4, Table 2 & Figure 3), and the seed/ovule ratio a positive effect on seed predation (LM, t1,151 = 5.58, p < 1E-6,
Table 2) when the species were pooled. The R2 of the corresponding multivariate linear model was 0.25 (when the
species were treated separately, the R2 were between 0.11
and 0.40, Table 2). Larval mass positively correlated with
the number of seeds eaten per larva when all the species
were pooled (t1,137 = 6, p < 1E-7, Table 3). When the species were analysed separately, the link was significant for
C. rotudinventris, C. inermella and C. dentifera (Table 3).

Differences between Chiastocheta species
The adonivernith concentrations differed between fruits
infested by different species. Fruits infested by C. rotudiventris and C. macropyga larvae had higher concentrations
than those infected by C. setifera/trollii and C. dentifera larvae (ANOVA, Figure 4.a). The number of damaged carpels
differed between species, C. rotudiventris damaged the
most carpels, closely followed by C. macropyga and C. setifera/trollii. C. inermella damaged around 3 carpels
whereas C. dentifera damaged no more than two carpels
(Figure 4.b). Larval mass differed between species;C. dentifera was the smallest species (Figure 4.c). The total
number of seeds eaten per larva varied across species: C.
macropyga and C. setifera/trollii ate more seeds than the
others, followed by C. rotudiventris and C. inermella, and
then C. dentifera (Figure 4.d). The seed/ovule ratio differed between species: C. macropyga and C. setifera/trollii
had the highest ratio and C. rotudiventris the lowest (Figure 4.e). C. dentifera ate the most seeds per damaged carpel, and C. rotudiventris the least (Figure 4.f).

Discussion
Advantages and disadvantages of a correlative study
In a previous study, Gallet et al [25] showed that the
amount of adonivernith in the carpel walls positively correlated to the number of larvae in the fruit. Here we only
consider fruits infested by a single larva and show that 1)
adonivernith concentration is dependent on the amount
of damage (the number of damaged carpels) caused by
the larva and 2) the number of seeds eaten per damaged
carpel decreases as adonivernith concentration increases.
Chiastocheta larvae are specific to Trollius fruits, and cannot
be reared on artificial medium under controlled laboratory conditions. Therefore we could not directly carry out
bioassays to show that the cause of the reduced seed consumption is indeed adonivernith. Other correlated factors
may be involved in the plant's response to larval damage
and in its toxicity against larvae. For example, Gallet et al
[25] showed that other undetermined phenolic compounds respond to increasing numbers of larvae,
although the response is more marked with adonivernith.
The chemical defence probably involves several com-

Disentangling cause and effect
Another advantage of the correlative approach is that it
makes it possible to disentangle two processes which
come into play simultaneously: the induction of plant
defence (in response to carpel damage inflicted by larval
predation) and the consequences of defence induction
(on larval predation). The plant defence and larval predation are both the cause and effect of adonivernith induc-

pounds and possible synergistic effects: some may be precursors or the degraded compounds of others, and some
may be more toxic to the larvae than others. Only bioassays performed in controlled conditions can link a cause
(adonivernith concentration) to an effect (larval mass),
but the correlative field study has the advantage of showing that the phenomenon is indeed at work in nature [34].
The huge variability of flavonoids in the natural environment [35-37], coupled with the wide range of factors that
may influence their production and accumulation means
an in vitro experiment would be entirely disconnected
from nature and is unrealistic. Seed-eating pollinator
mutualisms are complex systems to which observational
studies or semi-experimental field studies are better
adapted [7,11,16].

tion [38]. This explains why no direct link was found
between adonivernith concentration and the total
number of seeds eaten, nor between adonivernith concentration and larval mass: more seeds eaten means more carpel damage and therefore more adonivernith induction,
but at the same time more adonivernith induction means
less seeds eaten (Figure 5.a). Instead, adonivernith induction can be explored by looking at the link between adonivernith concentration and the number of damaged
carpels, and toxicity can be measured in terms of the link
between the number of seeds eaten per damaged carpel
and adonivernith concentration (Figure 5.b).
Plant reactions to the damage vary between individuals,
leading to variations in adonivernith concentrations in
fruits with the same amount of damage. Thanks to this
natural variability of plant defences, we were able to show
that in the most reactive fruits, the larvae ate less seeds per
damaged carpel. The variability of plant defences can have
a genetic (e.g. [39]) or an environmental (e.g. [40]) basis.
Origin of the chemical defence
Adonivernith is abundant in almost all parts of the globeflower, especially in the leaves and sepals [25]. It is probably involved in the defence against herbivores and
florivores, as well as in the resistance to ultra-violet radiation. Ultra-violet radiation has been shown to induce
adonivernith production in globeflowers (S. Ibanez,
unpublished results), and globeflower populations
located at high altitudes contain higher concentrations of
adonivernith in their carpel walls [25]. Adonivernith was

first described in the genus Adonis [41], the sister genus of
Trollius [42]. It is also present in other Trollius species [25],
which suggests that it was already present in the common
ancestor of Trollius and Adonis. The chemical defence used
by T. europaeus against Chiastocheta larvae is probably an
exaptation. However, the accumulation of adonivernith
in carpel walls is not induced by mechanical damage and
appears to be specifically induced by Chiastocheta larvae
[25].
The ecological and evolutionary stability of the interaction
When several larvae are allowed to develop in a single
fruit, each larva is exposed to increasing amounts of adonivernith as the number of larvae developing in the fruit
increases [25]. The mechanism is therefore densitydependant: the higher the population density of Chiastocheta, the more it suffers from chemical defence. The density-dependant mechanism is also found in yuccas [10]. In
two models exploring the evolutionary emergence of fruit
abortion in yucca and senita cactus [43,44], Holland et al
show that density-dependant mechanisms which limit
seed predation by moths can maintain the costs of seed
predation at a lower level than the benefits of pollination
thereby stabilising the interaction. This ensures the ecological stability of the interaction in the sense that globeflower populations are more likely to persist. The
modelling carried out by Ferdy et al [45] showed that if the
closure of the globeflower corolla led to an increase in
intraspecific contest competition due to an increase in egg
survival, then females would evolve a reduced clutch size
per flower thus stabilising the interaction, but unpublished field data (L. Després) does not support the model
hypothesis (i.e. higher egg survival in closed corolla).
However, the chemical defence mechanism described
here may play exactly the same role as globe closure in
Ferdy et al's model if it indirectly increases intraspecific
competition between larvae. The chemical defence would
then lead to an evolutionary stabilisation of the mutualism. Finally, the larvae are likely to evolve a resistance to
adonivernith. Preliminary results suggest that the activity
of the detoxifying enzyme cytochrome P450 (frequently
involved in insect resistance to plant chemicals [46]) in
Chiastocheta larvae is greater when they are exposed to
adonivernith (L. Després, unpublished results). In any
case the results of this study suggest that adonivernith is
more likely to act as a growth inhibitor or a feeding deterrent rather than a lethal compound.
Plant defence and sympatric speciation in the
Chiastocheta genus
Phylogenetical and biogeographical data indicate that the
diversification of the Chiastocheta genus mostly occurred
in sympatry [47]. The dominance of intra- over inter-specific competition could have driven the radiation [48]
through resource partitioning in space (exploitation pat-

tern [23]) and time (oviposition time [48]). Both processes are affected by plant defence: exposure to
adonivernith will depend on the exploitation pattern, and
the larvae of late-ovipositing species will be exposed to
higher concentrations resulting from the damage inflicted
by early-ovipositing species. The accumulation of adonivernith in the carpel walls will depend on the exploitation pattern (the number of damaged carpels) and on
oviposition timing. Interestingly, the larva of the late-ovipositing species C. dentifera only mines through a single
carpel, thereby avoiding contact with the carpel walls containing adonivernith. In the present study, it is the species
which least induces a plant's response, and the least sensitive to adonivernith. Intra- and inter-specific competition
may be direct in the form of larval contests and the data
presented here suggests that it may also be indirect by
means of adonivernith induction. Adonivernith may have
played a key role in the sympatric speciation of the Chiastocheta genus through the following three mechanisms: 1)
by increasing competition between larvae; 2) by provoking a behavioural avoidance strategy in C. dentifera; and 3)
by mobilising different capacities to metabolize this
chemical compound. We have already shown that larval
foraging behaviour varies across species and we predict
that the larval capacity for resistance also varies across species.

Conclusion
Adonivernith induction by larvae and adonivernith toxicity on larvae are two interlinked processes: adonivernith
accumulation and larval predation are both the reciprocal
cause and effect. The interaction between the larvae and
adonivernith varies between the six Chiastocheta species,
which may have played a role in the sympatric speciation
of the genus. Adonivernith induction reduces the costs of
mutualism for the plant, which has a stabilising effect on
the plant's pollination specialisation on Chiastocheta flies.

Methods
Field study design
We conducted the field study around the "Station Alpine
Joseph Fourier UMS 2925", col du Lautaret, France, in a
single large population "Ruillas", 2025 m a.s.l in June July 2007. A sample of 289 flowers was chosen randomly
and left untouched until naturally pollinated. We then
removed the eggs from each flower and waited one day for
a new set of ovipositing females to lay their eggs. At the
end of the day, we inspected the flowers and removed all
the newly-laid eggs but one. The flower was then covered
with a nylon bag to prevent further oviposition. If no eggs
were found, we repeated the same procedure the following day. We recorded the day each flower was bagged
(ranging from June 8th to 19th) and collected them 28 days
later.

Back in the laboratory, the fruits were stored at 4°C for a
maximum duration of 24 h before dissection. For each
fruit, all carpels were checked for damage, and the number
of damaged carpels recorded. Five intact carpels were chosen at random and dissected, and the ratio of the number
of developing seeds to the number of ovules (developing
and degenerating) per carpel was determined. All damaged carpels were dissected in order to estimate the
number of developing seeds that had been eaten [3]. The
larvae were located either in the damaged carpels, or in
the flower receptacle (in the case of C. rotundiventris), and
weighed. The position and the trajectory of each larva
inside the fruit (Figure 1) were used to assign it to one of
the five following species: C. rotundiventris, C. macropyga,
C. inermella, C. setifera or C. trollii (recorded as C. setifera/
trollii, as these two species cannot be distinguished at the
egg or larval stage [19]) and C. dentifera. If the fruit happened to contain no larvae, or more than one larva, it was
excluded from the analysis. The carpel walls of five damaged carpels and the five intact carpels used for pollination analysis were pooled for the chemical analysis as
preliminary results had shown that adonivernith concentration in intact carpels as opposed to damaged carpels
was not significantly different (F1,29 = 2.039, p = 0.164). If
the larva had damaged less than five carpels, the intact carpels were chosen at random and dissected so that all
chemical analyses were carried out on ten carpel walls. Of
the 289 flowers included in the first stage of the design,
154 were used for the statistical analysis. Missing samples
were either lost in the field, contained no, or more than
one larva (some hidden eggs might have been missed), or
had been consumed by herbivores such as bush crickets
(Tettigoniidae species) despite the protection offered by
the nylon bag. C. rotundiventris developed in 24 of the 154
fruits, C. macropyga in 25, C. inermella in 22, C. setifera/trollii in 34 and C. dentifera in 49.
Chemical analysis
All samples were individually stored at -18°C until analysis. This individual storage and the very small size of some
of the samples meant dry weight could not be measured:
all the results were given as fresh weight (FW). Each sample was weighed and extracted using 50 ml of an ethanolwater (50/50) mixture under reflux [25]. Aliquots (20 μl)
of the ethanolic solution were used for HPLC analysis on
a RP C18 μBondapak column, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, monitored using a Waters 600 Controller. Spectra were
recorded on a Waters 996 PDA. Solvent A was acetic acid
0.5% in distilled water and solvent B acetic acid 0.5% in
acetonitrile. Adonivernith was separated with an isocratic
flow (1.5 ml min-1) of 20% of B in A and its area was
recorded at 354 nm. Concentration was expressed in luteolin equivalent, based on a calibration curve established
with pure luteolin (obtained from Extrasynthese, Lyon,
France).

Data analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using the software
R 2.6.0 (R Development Core Team 2007). We carried out
ANOVAs, univariate and bivariate linear regressions using
the R function "lm" in the "stats" package. We produced
generalised linear models (binomial family) using the R
function "glm" in the "MASS" package. The datasets corresponding to the five taxonomical subdivisions of the Chiastocheta genus we used were either analysed all together
in order to draw conclusions at the genus level; or analysed separately in order to explore the differences
between species.
