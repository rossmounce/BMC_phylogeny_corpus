Background
Several studies suggest that CD4+ T-cell count (CD4) is
important in pathogenesis of human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection in HIV-positive patients including HPV clearance.
CD4 dynamics as well as other co-factors such as highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1 RNA viral
load (VL), demographics, behavioral risks and, clinical diagnosis allows for predicting the absolute probabilities of

HPV clearance/persistence. The modeling approach allows
for the utilization of complete datasets and does not
require any additional essential assumptions about missing
information and possible violations in study design.

Materials and methods
We analyzed 266 HIV-1 positive adolescent girls from
the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and

Figure 1 HPV infection clearance probability vs. (1A) CD4 counts and (1B) combination of CD4 and logarithm of HIV viral load (log(VL)).

Health (REACH) cohort. At enrollment and every
6 months thereafter, cervical lavage samples were
tested for HPV using MY09/MY11/HMB01-based PCR
and 30 HPV type-specific probes. HIV-related clinical
data and risk factors were recorded every 3 months.
For analytic purposes, HPV types were categorized
according to phylogenetic patterns into (1) 16/16-like,
(2) 18/18-like, (3) other high risk (56/56-like), and (4)
low risk. HPV clearance was defined by the absence of
type-specific infection for two subsequent visits after
infection. Maximum likelihood estimates based on the
logistic-type model were developed for 3-month reconstructed probabilities of HPV clearance/persistent with
CD4, VL, and HAART as the main predictors at the
moment of examination.

Results
Figure 1A presents the clearance probability for HIVpositive patients depending on CD4 for HPV16/16-like,
HPV18/18-like, HPV56/56-like, and low-risk HPV.
HPV16/16-like infection has the lowest chance to be
cleared by host at low CD4 levels. The probability of
3-month clearance was less than 20% for patients with
CD4 <200, but increased gradually with CD4 increase
but overall was slower than for HPV18/18-like, other
high-risk, and low-risk HPV. Additionally, the 3-D plot
in Figure 1B describes CD4 and log (VL) as predictors
of probability of HPV16/16-like clearance: the lowest
CD4 levels together with the highest VL were significant predictors for HPV persistence. The multiplicative
effect of HAART showed tendency to decrease on
HPV16/16-like clearance probability with increasing
CD4 levels.
Conclusion
This approach could extend opportunities to understand
the associations between CD4, VL, and HAART to
develop the comprehensive approach to individualized
prediction of HPV infection persistence/clearance in
HIV-positive patients.
