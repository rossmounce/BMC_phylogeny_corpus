Abstract
Background: Epimedium sagittatum (Sieb. Et Zucc.) Maxim, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant species, has been
used extensively as genuine medicinal materials. Certain Epimedium species are endangered due to commercial
overexploition, while sustainable application studies, conservation genetics, systematics, and marker-assisted
selection (MAS) of Epimedium is less-studied due to the lack of molecular markers. Here, we report a set of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified in these ESTs for E. sagittatum.
Results: cDNAs of E. sagittatum are sequenced using 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing technology. The raw reads are
cleaned and assembled into a total of 76,459 consensus sequences comprising of 17,231 contigs and 59,228
singlets. About 38.5% (29,466) of the consensus sequences significantly match to the non-redundant protein
database (E-value < 1e-10), 22,295 of which are further annotated using Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A total of
2,810 EST-SSRs is identified from the Epimedium EST dataset. Trinucleotide SSR is the dominant repeat type (55.2%)
followed by dinucleotide (30.4%), tetranuleotide (7.3%), hexanucleotide (4.9%), and pentanucleotide (2.2%) SSR. The
dominant repeat motif is AAG/CTT (23.6%) followed by AG/CT (19.3%), ACC/GGT (11.1%), AT/AT (7.5%), and AAC/
GTT (5.9%). Thirty-two SSR-ESTs are randomly selected and primer pairs are synthesized for testing the
transferability across 52 Epimedium species. Eighteen primer pairs (85.7%) could be successfully transferred to
Epimedium species and sixteen of those show high genetic diversity with 0.35 of observed heterozygosity (Ho) and
0.65 of expected heterozygosity (He) and high number of alleles per locus (11.9).
Conclusion: A large EST dataset with a total of 76,459 consensus sequences is generated, aiming to provide
sequence information for deciphering secondary metabolism, especially for flavonoid pathway in Epimedium. A
total of 2,810 EST-SSRs is identified from EST dataset and ~1580 EST-SSR markers are transferable. E. sagittatum ESTSSR transferability to the major Epimedium germplasm is up to 85.7%. Therefore, this EST dataset and EST-SSRs will
be a powerful resource for further studies such as taxonomy, molecular breeding, genetics, genomics, and
secondary metabolism in Epimedium species.

Background
Herb epimedii, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is
prepared from the aerial parts of Epimedium species of
Berberidaceae, which is a basal eudicot family containing
enormous medicinal plants. E. sagittatum (Sieb. Et

Zucc.) Maxim, together with other four Epimedium species, E. brevicornu Maxim, E. pubescens Maxim, E. wushanense T. S. Ying, and E. koreanum Nakai, is listed in
Chinese Pharmacopoeia [1]. Herb epimediicontains various bioactive components and has been utilized extensively as a tonic and antirheumatic medicinal herb for
thousands of years in China. Currently, Herb epimedii is
still widely used to treat many diseases such as impotence, frequency/urgency of urination, coronary heart
disease, chronic bronchitis, and neurasthenia [2]. In

addition, Epimedium species are also used as ground
cover plants and ornamental plants because of the abundance of flower colours and flower patterns. Therefore,
Epimedium species possess enormous potentials for
commercial application. The molecular research of Epimedium, however, is lagged behind. Firstly, at present,
many studies focus on extracting bioactive components
from Epimedium [3-5], but metabolic pathways involved
in producing these bioactive components are still largely
unknown. Secondly, many studies have attempted to
distinguish taxonomically Epimedium species and detect
the genetic diversity of Epimedium [6-8]. But only a few
of genomic markers have been exploited, so far, in our
lab for studying genetic diversity of natural populations,
including 14, 19, and 12 SSRs for E. sagittatum [9], E.
koreanum [10], and E. brevicornu [11], respectively. The
most important thing is that, according to our knowledge, most genomic SSRs exploited fail to transfer in
other Epimedium species. Thus, more markers are
needed for in-depth understanding of the natural diversity and for developing strategies for sustainable utilization of Epimedium. Thirdly, although many papers
reported taxonomic results of Epimedium using different
molecular markers such as RAPD [12], RFLP [12], AFLP
[13], and rDNA [6,7,14], the taxonomical relationships
among Epimedium species, especially closely related
Chinese species, are still not clear because of the shortcoming of molecular markers with little polymorphic
information or the limited number of species sampled
in former studies. Moreover, the morphological characteristics of E. sagittatum vary greatly among different
populations, and it is still not known whether it belongs
to polytypic species or a complex of cryptic species.
Finally, according to our knowledge, the novel gene discovery and molecular breeding of Epimedium new cultivars haven’t been started yet due to the lack of genetic
and genomic information.
Generation of a large-scale expressed sequence tag
(EST) dataset is a useful approach to accelerate the
researches of non-model species, especially for Epimedium. As a valuable resource for comparative genomics, functional genomics and biodiversity study, EST
database has been established for model plant species
and non-model species (citrus, grape, kiwifruit, etc.).
So far, only three Ranunculales species (Aquilegia formosa × Aquilegia pubescens, Eschscholzia californica,
and Papaver somniferum) have EST sequences available in the public databases and very limited number
of EST sequences are available for these species.
Although two cDNA libraries have been constructed
using flower and leaf materials of E. brevicornu [15,16],
no EST sequences have been uploaded to National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) database yet. As of June 2009,

Page 2 of 11

only 398 nucleotide sequences are available for Epimedium in NCBI.
Comparing with other types of molecular markers,
SSR marker has many advantages including high abundance, random distribution in the entire genome, high
information content, codominant inheritance, and reproducibility. According to the original sequences used for
identification of simple repeats, SSRs are divided in two
categories, genomic SSRs derived from random genomic
sequences and EST-SSRs derived from expressed
sequence tags. It is very time-consuming, cost-expensive
and labor-intensive for developing genomic SSRs from
the repeat-enriched genomic library when compared
with the development of EST-SSR. Genomic SSRs have
neither genic function nor close linkage to transcriptional regions, while EST-SSRs are potentially tightly
linked with functional genes that perhaps control certain
important agronomic characters [17]. Therefore, ESTSSRs are very useful for MAS in plant breeding. Besides,
EST-SSR markers contain high transferability because
EST-SSRs are derived from expressed sequences that are
more conserved than the non-genic sequences and can
be found in other relative species [18]. Due to the sharp
increase of EST sequences deposited in NCBI, more and
more EST-SSRs have been identified and used extensively for comparative mapping, DNA fingerprinting,
biodiversity, and evolutionary studies in lots of species
[19,20]. So far, surveying the polymorphism, diversity
and transferability of EST-SSRs have been performed in
Vitis [18], Citrus [20], Coffea [21,22], Medicago [23],
Glycine [24], Phaseolus [25], Hordeum [26], Festuca [27],
and Triticum [28].
Here, we report the generation of a large-scale EST
dataset from young leaves of E. sagittatum using the
cost-effective 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing technology,
the development and characterization of a set of ESTSSRs, and the transferability of EST-SSRs across genus
Epimedium. Therefore, the EST dataset can lay a foundation and facilitate MAS breeding and taxonomy in
genus Epimedium, and decode secondary metabolism in
Epimedium species.

Results
Contig assembly of 454 reads

A total of 228,768 sequences (51.7 Mb) are generated
from leaf cDNAsof E. sagittatum. After removing
SMART primers, polyA tail, and low quality sequences,
a total of 217,380 high quality sequences is retained
with a total length of 50.9 Mb and an average length of
224.9 bp ranging from 50 bp to 556 bp (Additional file
1). After clustering and assembly, 76,459 consensus
sequences with a total length of 18.8 Mb (6.5 Mb of
17,231 contigs and 12.3 Mb of 59,228 singlets) are
obtained (Additional file 1). The length of contigs ranges

from 51 bp to 1,911 bp with an average of 375.9 bp, and
that of singlets ranges from 50 bp to 556 bp with an
average of 207.8 bp (Additional file 1).
The size distribution of Epimedium consensuses is
shown in table 1. The length for the majority of ESTs is
201-300 bp, which is consistent with the 454 GS-FLX
sequencing capacity. After the assembly, although the
size distribution pattern of singlets is similar to that of
whole EST dataset, there are 5,497 contigs with
sequences longer than 400 bp (Table 1). In addition,
about 7.2% of contigs are still less than 200 bp after
assembly. This might be due to the short length of the
individual read and/or the low coverage of the transcriptome represented in this dataset. Most of the consensuses are derived from few reads. For example, 7,509
(43.6% out of contigs) and 3,074 (17.8% out of contigs)
consensuses are derived from 2 and 3 reads, respectively
(Table 2).

The consensus sequences are blasted against non-redundant protein database (NR database) and 29,466 consensuses comprising of 10,245 contigs and 19,221 singlets
have significant hits to NR database (Additional file 1).
All the consensus sequences are also compared against
Pfam domain database and about 50% (38,220) of them
are successfully annotated. Gene Ontology (GO) terms
are further assigned to 38,220 Epimedium consensus
sequences that are successfully annotated based on
Pfam matches. Only 22,295 Epimedium consensus
sequences are able to be assigned GO numbers. Figure
1 shows the percentage distributions of gene ontology
terms according to the GO consortium. Protein metabolic process (23.4%) is the most dominant group out of
12,242 consensus sequences that are annotated to the
biological process category. It is followed by the biosynthetic process at 23.2%, photosynthesis at 22.5%, generation of precursor metabolites and energy at 19.3%,
cellular process at 15.7%, translation at 13.6%, metabolic
process at 10.5%, and carbohydrate metabolic process at
9.3% (Figure 1A). A total of 13,807 sequences could be
assigned to the molecular function category. Binding
(30.5%) is the most dominant group followed by catalytic activity (20.6%), structural molecular activity (12.7%),
hydrolase activity (11.9%), nucleotide binding (10.5%),
transferase activity (6.9%), and transcription regulator

component, 64.9% of 12,308 consensus sequences are
assigned to membrane followed by intracellular (15.1%),
ribosome (12.0%) and extracellular region (5.8%) (Figure
1C).
Being famous medicinal plants used in China, Epimedium species have flavonoids as the major phytochemical components. There are also many other unidentified
compounds in Epimedium species [29]. Thus, genes
related to secondary metabolism, especially for the flavonoid biosynthesis, are under further studies in order to
decipher the molecular mechanism of natural variation
of phytochemical components and facilitate the molecular breeding of medicinal cultivars. In our EST collection, 29 EST consensus sequences are annotated relating
to secondary metabolic process (Figure 1A), including
genes encoding key enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase,
cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, 4-counaroyl:ligase CoA, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, flavanone 3 hydroxylase, flavanone 3’ hydroxylase, flavanone 3’5’
hydroxylase, flavonol synthase, flavone synthase,

dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, anthocyanidin synthase,
rhamnosyl transferase, and UDPG-flavonoid glucosyl
transferase. In addition, more than 300 EST consensus
sequences were annotated relating to transcription regulator activity (Figure 1B), part of which might play roles
in regulating flavonoid biosynthesis and metabolism. For
example, regulatory genes are annotated as members of
WD40 family, MYB family, and bHLH family that can
form a triplex compound to regulate the specific expression patterns of flavonoid structural genes. All these
structural and regulatory genes are being cloned and
functional studies are carrying out in our lab. Further
studies such as molecular modification (or gene transformation) and metabolic engineering of enzymes are
also in progress.

A total of 2,629 sequences containing 2,810 SSRs have
been identified from 76,459 consensus sequences, with
167 EST sequences containing at less two SSRs. The frequency of EST-SSRs observed in Epimedium transcriptome is 3.67%, and the distribution density is 149.5 per
Mb. The occurrence of different repeat type is shown in
Table 3. The most abundant repeat type is trinucleotide
(55.2%, 1,552) followed by dinucleotide (30.4%, 855), tetranucleotide (7.3%, 204), hexanucleotide (4.9%, 137), and
pentanucleotide repeat unit (2.2%, 62). The frequencies
of EST-SSRs distributed in different repeat numbers are
also shown in Table 3. There are 1,063 SSRs with 5 tandem repeats, which is the most common repeat number
(37.8%) followed by 6 tandem repeats (21.2%, 595), 4
tandem repeats (11.9%, 333), 7 tandem repeats (9.8%,
274) and 8 tandem repeats (7.5%, 210). The dominant
repeat motif is AAG/CTT with a frequency of 23.6%
(663), followed by AG/CT (19.3%, 543), ACC/GGT
(11.1%, 312), AT/AT (7.5%, 211), and AAC/GTT (5.9%,

The Epimedium EST-SSR Transferability

A total of 32 primer pairs (Additional file 2), referred to
EsESP01 to EsESP32, have been stochastically selected
among the 2,810 microsatellites to amplify 10 dinucleotide SSRs and 22 trinucleotide SSRs for testing the
transferability in other Epimedium species (Additional
file 3). Of these primer pairs, seven primer pairs
(EsESP1, EsESP3, EsESP4, EsESP20, EsESP24, EsESP31,
and EsESP32) cannot amplify any fragment in E. sagittatum, suggesting that these primers are not well
designed. Four primers, EsESP14, EsESP19, EsESP26,
and EsESP27, amplify numerous non-target bands, suggesting these primers are also problematic. Three primer
pairs, EsESP05, EsESP25, and EsESP29, succeed in transferring to other Epimedium species, but amplify PCR
products larger than the expected sizes. The rest of primer pairs produces polymorphic bands in most Epimedium species as shown in figure 2. Therefore, 85.7% (18
out of 21) EST-SSR primers can be transferred successfully to other Epimedium species. In theoretically, there
are 56.2% (18/32) of 2810, namely ~1580, E. sagittatum
EST-SSRs markers suitable for genetic studies in genus
Epimedium.
Species from other genera, including Vancouveria hexandra, Nandina domestica Thunb., Berberis julianae
Schneid., Berberis sargentiana Schneid., Dysosma versipellis (Hance) M. Cheng ex Ying, Mahonia bealei (Fort.)
Carr., and Mahonia fortunei (Lindl.) Fedde., have been
used to test the transferability of Epimedium EST-SSRs
across different genus of Berberidaceae. A total of 8 primers, EsESP6, EsESP7, EsESP9, EsESP10, EsESP11,
EsESP13, EsESP23, and EsESP28, can produce PCR

Zeng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/94

fragments in V. hexandra (the most closely related
genus reported by Wang et al [30]) with similar sizes
and same SSR motifs as those in Epimedium (sequence
data not shown). Only four primers, EsESP8, EsESP13,
EsESP18, and EsESP21, can amplify PCR fragments in
other Berberidaceae species mentioned above. However,
sequences of the PCR fragments from genera Berberis,
Nandina, Dysosma, and Mahonia, do not contain the
SSR motifs found in Epimedium species (data not
shown). Therefore, Epimedium EST-SSRs can successfully transfer to Vancouveria, but not other Berberidaceae genera tested.
The genetic diversity and dendrogram in genus
Epimedium

A total of 55 individuals representing 52 species (Additional file 3) have been used to evaluate the genetic
diversity in genus Epimedium. Two primer pairs,
EsESP07 and EsESP08, detect a single band in some
species while null in other species. Thus, they are
excluded for further study and the remaining 16 ESTSSRs are used to estimate the genetic diversity among
52 species. A high level of genetic diversity in genus Epimedium is discovered (Additional file 2). The number of
alleles per locus ranges from 3 to 27 with an average of
11.9 alleles. Ho ranges from 0.04 to 0.6 with an average
of 0.35. He ranges from 0.17 to 0.94 with an average of
0.65. Polymorphism information content (PIC) is from
0.17 for EsESP22 locus to 0.93 for EsESP21 locus. The
observed length of PCR products vary greatly in a large
spectrum compared with the fragment size in E. sagittatum (Additional file 2). The size variation of amplicons
reflects the length of repetitive sequences in each SSR
locus, suggesting that the polymorphism might be
related to the differences of tandem repeat numbers
(Figure 2).
In order to study the evolutionary relationship among
Epimedium species, those 16 EST-SSR primers successfully transferring in almost all Epimedium species are
used for reconstructing Epimedium phylogeny. V. hexandra is used as an outgroup species, because it is more

Page 6 of 11

closely related to Epimedium genus than Jeffersonia
dubia (Maxim.) Benth. et Hook. f. and Podophyllum peltatum [30]. Furthermore, sequences of some loci in V.
hexandra amplified by Epimedium EST-SSR primers
confirm that similar single nucleotide repeats exist in V.
hexandra as mentioned above. As shown in additional
file 4, the phylogenetic relationship among all 52 species
are supported by low bootstrap values, especially for
Chinese species, partially due to the small number of
EST-SSRs and the nature of EST-SSR with low PIC
used in this study. Previous studies also found it is hard
to differentiate the closely related Chinese species using
different types of molecular markers including RAPD
[12], RFLP [12], AFLP [13], and rDNA [6,7,14]. Therefore, more EST-SSR markers or combining results of
different types of markers would provide more opportunities for better resolving the phylogeny among Epimedium species, which is an on-going project in our lab.

Discussion
E. sagittatum ESTs annotation

Currently, numerous studies are focusing on isolating
the Epimedium bioactive components [3-5], but the
potential molecular mechanism producing bioactive
components is still unclear. Furthermore, little or no
information regarding to its biological conservation,
population genetics, molecular breeding, and molecular
biology is reported for Epimedium species due to the
lack of background information. The 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing technology is a very cost-effective method to
obtain large-scale EST sequences and will speed up the
researches of less-studied Epimedium species. The technology has been broadly used for bacteria de novo
sequencing, cDNA sequencing, small RNA sequencing,
metagenomic sequencing and whole genome shotgun
survey http://www.454.com/news-events/publications.
asp. Margulies et al. [31] demonstrated that the technology had 100 fold sequencing capability at the cost of
relative low accuracy than Sanger-based capillary electrophoresis sequencing systems when the GS20 sequencing machine was used. Recently, the new generation

capability of up to 200-300 bp per read and higher
sequencing accuracy than that of GS20 http://www.454.
com. In this study, an Epimedium transcriptome population is sequenced by 454 GS-FLX system, and a total of
226,544 sequence reads are generated. After assembly,
76,459 consensus sequences are obtained.
It is noticeable that only 29,466 Epimedium consensuses have significant hits in the NR protein database
(Additional file 1). Thus, there are a large number of
sequences that don’t have any significant match in other
species (46,993). This might be due to the following reasons: (1) the shortness of sequence reads leading to
assemble difficultly, (2) inefficiency of blast using short
sequences and the incompleteness of the known database, (3) the advantages of deep sequencing, which can
discover novel genes with low expression levels, (4) the
shortness of sequence reads resulting in low efficiency of
annotation, which was confirmed by correlation test
between sequence length and percentage of sequences
successfully annotated (Additional file 5), and (5) part of
consensuses representing UTRs. With regard to the first
point, the size of raw reads ranged from 50 to 556 bp
with an average length of 224.9 bp. After assembly, most
contigs still range from 201 to 300 bp, and the average
length only increased up to 245.7 bp. It is also supported
by the fact that most contigs were assembled with 2-5
reads (Table 2). Thus, the shortness of sequences is the
main disadvantage in this scenario when using 454 pyrosequencing technologies. Concerning on the second
point, short query sequences might not be able to have
sequence matches with a significant low E-value and high
score, thus resulting in a high level of false negative
results. In addition, Ranunculales is much less studied
when compared with core eudicots and monocots, suggesting that a lot of Ranunculales lineage-specific genes
might not be included in the database. As to the third
point, EST fragments are directly sequenced instead of
being cloned and sequenced, which leads to the truly random sequencing of all the expressed genes and might
facilitate the discovery of rare genes. Emrich et al [32]
found that coupling of LCM (Laser Capture Microdissection) and 454 sequencing technologies could facilitate the
discovery of rare, possibly cell-type-specific transcripts.
In summary, the nature of shortness in reads generated
by 454 GS-FLX sequencing technology is the origin of
low efficiency of annotation. However, it is still possible
that new genes and/or Ranunculales- or even Epimedium- specific novel sequences could be discovered due
to large-scale sequencing.
Potential applications of Epimedium EST dataset

Combining all the available information, we have a set
of 22,295 GO-annotated Epimedium consensus

Page 7 of 11

sequences, which is very valuable and cost-effective for a
non-model organism by sequencing one tissue at certain
developmental stage. Additionally, 10.5%, 9.3%, 3.0%,
and 0.2% of 12,242 Epimedium GO-annotated consensuses for biological processes are related to metabolic
process, carbohydrate metabolic process, amino acid and
derivative metabolic process, and secondary metabolic
process, respectively (Figure 1A). Many bioactive components of Epimedium might derive from these biological processes (Figure 1A). A total of 13,807 Epimedium
consensuses is annotated for molecular function, 2.2%
and 20.6% of which have transcription regulator activity
and catalytic activity, respectively, suggesting that these
genes might take part in regulating and catalyzing the
production of bioactive components (Figure 1B). All of
these sequences can provide fundamental information
for the metabolic-engineering and molecular breeding of
Epimedium.
In details, this large EST dataset of Epimedium is a
powerful resource for further studies. Firstly, it can facilitate cloning genes of interest, especially for genes
involved in controlling metabolic pathways such as the
flavonoid pathway. The Epimedium EST dataset generated in our study will provide enough sequence information for designing primers to obtain full-length genes.
Therefore, these sequences will promote the molecular
study of secondary metabolism in medicinal Epimedium
plants. Secondly, molecular markers can be exploited
based on EST sequences for researches in the fields of
biodiversity, taxonomy, and population genetics.
Although genomic SSRs have been developed from Epimedium, they have much lower transferability among
different Epimedium species than EST-SSRs [9-11].
Therefore, EST-SSRs can further promote the taxonomic study of Epimedium species, especially those closely related Chinese species. Thirdly, it is noticeable that
some EST-based molecular markers might be linked to
genes involved in controlling traits that are important
for market value [17,33]. Thus, EST-SSRs can provide a
powerful tool for genetic mapping and MAS. In summary, the EST dataset reported here can be used for
decoding the molecular mechanism of the flavonoid
pathway, as well as lays a foundation for biodiversity,
population genetics, genomics, and functional genomics
of Epimedium species.
EST-SSR frequency and distribution in Epimedium
transcriptome

A total of 2,810 perfect microsatellites over 12 bp have
been identified from Epimedium EST dataset, i.e. 3.67%
EST sequences possess single sequence repeats. Obviously,
the frequency of SSRs detected in Epimedium is similar to
that of other dicotyledonous species ranging from 2.65%
to 16.82% [34]. The EST-SSR frequency is dependent on

Zeng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/94

the following factors. Firstly, parameters used in exploring
microsatellites affect the results dramatically, such as the
repeat length threshold and the number of repeat unit. In
the present study, mononucleotide repeat motifs are
excluded in our strategy for identifying microsatellites.
Secondly, the genome structure or composition may also
account partially for the EST-SSR frequency, because the
genetic-biochemical background of the cells plays important roles in fixation of de novo-generated SSRs [35].
Thirdly, different softwares used in detecting SSRs might
also affect the frequency. Some SSR identifying tools can
find out imperfect SSR, for example, Sputnik [36], while
others can only identify perfect SSRs such as SSRIT [37]
and MISA [20,21,26].
Theoretically, the frequency of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-,
and hexanucleotide repeats should be in turn decreased.
However, trinucleotide repeat unit is the most dominant
SSRs, followed by di-, tetra-, hexa-, and pentanucleotide
repeat units (Table 3). It is consistent with the results
reported for other plant species [20,23,38-40]. As shown
in table 4, the most dominant di- and trinucleotide repeat
motifs are AG/CT (19.3%) and AAG/CTT (23.6%),
respectively. These results are in agreement with that of
Morgante et al [36], Kumpatla et al [34], and Toth et al
[35]. Interestingly, there are only three CCG/CGG trinucleotide repeats in Epimedium, which is the most predominant in monocots [36,38]. Our results strongly support
and extend the notion of rarity of the CCG/CGG repeat
units in a large number of dicotyledonous plants (Citrus,
Coffea, Medicag, Glycine, etc.) [34]. These might be
resulted from the high GC content and consequent
codon usage bias in monocots [36,38]. Selection might
also be against the CCG/CGG repeat unit because of the
requirements of the splicing machinery [41]. Long CCG/
CGG sequences could compete splicing machinery components and give rise to inadequate splicing. Moreover,
CCG/CGG repeats, might form potential higher structures such as hairpin and quadruplex, and thus affect the
efficiency and accuracy of splicing and influence the formation of mature mRNA [35,42].
Primer designing for EST-SSRs

In this study, attempt of diagnosing transferability have
been performed by 32 EST-SSR primer pairs designed
according to E. sagittatum ESTs. Unfortunately, seven
and four primer pairs fail to transfer in Epimedium and
basal eudicot, respectively, which might be due to primer
(s) across splice sites, the presence of large introns in
genomic sequence, or primer(s) derived from a chimeric
or questionable consensuses sequence [39]. Some primer
pairs succeed in amplifying in some species while fail in
other species, suggesting that null alleles exist. Null
alleles might be resulted from some mutations, including
the deletion of microsatellites, and indels or substitution

Page 8 of 11

in primer binding sites [39]. In addition, the observed
sizes of PCR products in Epimedium species deviate frequently from the expected product sizes according to the
EST sequences. For instance, polymorphic bands amplified by EsESP05, EsESP25, and EsESP29 are larger than
the expected sizes. It might be due to the presence of
introns in the corresponding genomic regions [27,39]
and/or variation in the repeat numbers.
The EST-SSR transferability in genus Epimedium

In the present study, transferability of EST-SSRs derived
from E. sagittatum is high (85.7%) across 52 species in
genus Epimedium. The high transferability of EST-SSRs
is also reported in other plants. For instance, 90% ESTSSRs in Citrus clementia can be transferred successfully
to ten Citrus species and three related genera [20], and
89% EST-SSRs in Medicago truncatula succeed in transferring to eight genotypes [23]. About 92% Festuca arundinacea EST-SSR primer pairs can produce characteristic
SSR bands in at least one of the six related species [27].
Numerous studies have also demonstrated that EST-SSRs
possess higher transferability due to the conservation
characteristics of EST-SSRs when compared with SSRs
derived from genomic libraries [43,44]. In genus Epimedium, the transferability of genomic SSRs derived from E.
sagittatum [9] and E. koreanum [10] ranges from 21.4%
to 42.9% and from 42.1% to 47.4%, respectively. Genomic
SSRs isolated from E. brevicornu also possess low transferability ranging from 33.3% to 66.7% across other four
medicinal Epimedium species [11]. Comparing with the
high transferability of EST-SSRs (85.7%), the transferability of Epimedium genomic SSRs is remarkably lower.

Conclusions
A large-scale EST dataset with 76,459 consensuses
derived from E. sagittatum is reported in this study. A
total of 22,295 sequences has been successfully annotated with GO terms based on the known sequences,
and part of unique sequences are involved in the flavonoid metabolic pathway, which would facilitate deciphering the molecular mechanism of secondary
metabolism in Epimedium. Based on this EST dataset,
2,810 are exploited by MISA software and 32 primer
pairs are randomly selected for detecting transferability.
The transferability of E. sagittatum EST-SSRs is up to
85.7% and there are ~1580 EST-SSR markers transferable in genus Epimedium for further genetic studies. Ho
and He range from 0.04 to 0.6 and from 0.17 to 0.94
with an average of 0.35 and 0.65, respectively, and the
number of alleles per locus ranges from 3 to 27 with an
average of 11.9 alleles. These results suggest that the
major germplasm of Epimedium show high genetic
diversity. Due to the nature of EST-SSRs with high
transferability and genomic SSRs with high

Zeng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/94

polymorphism and both locating in different regions
across whole genomes, combination of EST-SSRs
derived from this study and genomic SSRs developed in
our lab will be a powerful resource for molecular taxonomic study in genus Epimedium and constructing
genetic maps. In addition, EST-SSRs tend to concentrate
in the gene-rich regions, suggesting that part of ESTSSRs can be exploited for the use of MAS benefiting for
Epimedium molecular breeding in the future. Therefore,
the set of EST-SSRs developed in the present study is a
promising resource for the related studies of Epimedium. In a word, Epimedium EST dataset is a valuable
resource for studies in the fields of taxonomy, MAS,
and secondary metabolism in genus Epimedium.

Methods
Plant materials

A total of 52 Epimedium species including 55 individuals (Additional file 3) were selected and investigated
for the transferability of EST-SSRs derived from E. sagittatum. Leaf samples were collected from Wuhan Botanical Garden (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China) and
Garden Vision Nursery (Boston, MS, USA). According
to the taxa system reported by Stearn [45], samples
cover two subgenera and three sections, and represent
most of Epimedium germplasm.
cDNA preparation

The red-magenta fully expanded leaves of E. sagittatum
Maxim. grown in Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, were harvested and prepared for
RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated according to the
instruction of TRIzol kit (Invitrogen) and then purified
to exclude the tRNA and rRNA and to enrich mRNA,
according to the instruction of mRNA purification kit
(Promega). mRNAs were reverse-transcribed by Powerscript™ II (Takara) with PCR primers SMART IV™ Oligonucleotide (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGA
GTGGCCATTACGGCCGGG-3’) and CDS III/3’ PCR
Primer (5’-ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGAC
ATG-d(T)30 N-1 N-3’). Long Distance PCR for double
strand cDNA amplification was performed with LA Taq
enzyme (Takara) for 25 cycles (95°C for 30 s, 68°C for 8
min) according to the SMART™ cDNA Library Construction Kit User Manual. Finally, double strand
cDNAs were purified using DNA purification kit
(Qigen) to generate high quality cDNAs.
EST processing, assembly, and annotation

Around 10 μg cDNAs were used for a half-plate sequencing run using 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing technology.
The sequencing was done at the Oklahoma University
genome center. Considering the shortness of reads generated by 454 sequencing technology, full-length cDNA

Page 9 of 11

was sheared stochastically prior to sequence in order to
randomly represent all transcripts. Sequence data for
Epimedium Short Read Archive (SRA) described in this
paper can be found at the public database [NCBI:
SRA008151]. A total of 228,768 raw sequences was
obtained. Lucy software [46] with default settings, except
that minimum good sequence length cut-off was set to
50 bp, was used to remove low quality regions. SeqClean
software http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software/
was then used to eliminate poly A/T sequences, vector
sequences, adaptor sequences and bacterial sequences.
The resulted high quality sequences were assembled to
consensus sequences using CAP3 software [47] with
parameters as -p 95 -y 15 -s 251 -o 25. All consensus
sequences were compared against Pfam database for
protein domain analysis [48]. Based on the domain
annotation, GO accessions of the consensus sequences
were successfully assigned using Pfam2 go conversion
file from the GO consortium http://www.geneontology.
org/external2 go. GO annotations were formatted for
input into the GOSlim program and the output was
parsed to count the occurrence of each GO category.
EST-SSR detection and primer designing

The EST-SSR detection was performed using Perl program MISA http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa. Since it
was hard to distinguish real mononucleotide repeats and
single nucleotide stretch error generated by 454 sequencing, mononucleotide repeats were excluded from this
study. The parameters were designed for identifying perfect di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide motifs
with a minimum of 6, 5, 4, 4, and 4 repeats, respectively.
Primer 3 software [49] was used to design primers. The
major parameters for designing the primers were set as
follows: primer length ranging from 18 bases to 28
bases with 20 as the optimum, PCR product size ranging
from 100 to 300 bp, optimum annealing temperature 60°
C, and GC content from 40% to 70% with 50% as optimum. According to these parameters, 32 primer pairs
(Additional file 2) were synthesized and were used to
detect the transferability in genus Epimedium.
Survey of EST-SSR polymorphism

Total DNA was isolated from leaf samples according to the
CTAB method [50]. PCR amplifications were carried out
in a final volume of 10 μL containing 50 ng of genomic
DNA, 1× PCR buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1.5 mM
MgCl2], 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer, and 0.5 U
Taq polymerase (Biostar). The PCR reactions were performed under standard conditions for all primers in a thermocycler (Eppendorf). The annealing temperature was
fixed for all primer pairs at 60°C. After 5 min at 95°C, 35
cycles were carried out with 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C, 40 s
at 72°C for extension, and a final extension step of 10 min

Zeng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/94

at 72°C. The separation of alleles was performed on a 6%
polyacrylamide gel. PCR products were mixed with an
equal volume of loading buffer. The mixture was denatured at 95°C for 5 min before loading onto the gel. Gels
were stained with silver nitrate following the protocol as
described in Bassam et al [51], and 25 bp DNA marker
(Beijing Yuanpinghao Biotech Co., Ltd) was used for calculating the length of EST-SSR amplicons. All primers were
detected firstly in E. sagittatum to check if the primers can
successful amplify PCR products. Then primers succeeding
in amplifying bands were tested for transferability. For
detecting whether E. sagittatum EST-SSRs transferred successfully or not, the PCR products were firstly tested using
2% agarose gel and then polyacrylamide gel.
Genetic diversity and data analysis

Arlequin [52] was used to calculate the genetic diversity
and average allele number. Genetic distance of the SSRs
genotype was calculated using the log-transformed proportion of shared alleles (’Dps’) by MICROSAT [53].
Polymorphic information content (PIC) was calculated
by PIC_CALC http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/695591/PIC_CALC.rar combination with GenAlex6 [54]. A dendrogram was constructed based on Neighbor-Joining
method [55] in the PHYLIP package [56].
