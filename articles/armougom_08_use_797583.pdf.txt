Abstract
Background: Recent studies of 16S rRNA genes in the mammalian gut microbiota distinguished
a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in obese individuals compared to lean individuals. This ratio
was estimated using a clonal Sanger sequencing approach which is time-consuming and requires
laborious data analysis. In contrast, new high-throughput pyrosequencing technology offers an
inexpensive alternative to clonal Sanger sequencing and would significantly advance our
understanding of obesity via the development of a clinical diagnostic method. Here we present a
cost-effective method that combines 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and DNA barcodes of the
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes 16S rRNA genes to determine the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the
gut microbiota of obese humans.
Results: The main result was the identification of DNA barcodes targeting the Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes phyla. These barcodes were validated using previously published 16S rRNA gut
microbiota clone libraries. In addition, an accurate F/B ratio was found when the DNA barcodes
were applied to short pyrosequencing reads of published gut metagenomes. Finally, the barcodes
were utilized to define the F/B ratio of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing data generated from brain
abscess pus and cystic fibrosis sputum.
Conclusion: Using DNA barcodes of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes 16S rRNA genes combined with
pyrosequencing is a cost-effective method for monitoring relevant changes in the relative
abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes bacterial communities in microbial ecosystems.

Background
Investigations of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes play an
essential role in the exploration of microbial diversity and
bacterial taxonomy. The composition of bacterial communities is typically studied by implementing clonal
Sanger sequencing of 16S rRNA PCR products [1-4]. In
humans, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio)

was found to be significantly higher in obese individuals
than in lean individuals. Ley and colleagues [4] demonstrated that a decrease in the F/B ratio in obese individuals
correlated with weight loss over time. The authors suggested that modulation of the abundance of particular
bacterial communities inherent to the gut microbiota
would be beneficial for the treatment of obesity. In these

experiments, the composition of the gut microbiota was
monitored over a one-year period using a culture-independent method based on shotgun sequencing of 16S
rRNA clone libraries. Although this method was successfully used for taxonomy characterization at the species
level, it was a time-consuming and expensive [5] process
that required the application of exceedingly laborious
data analyses. The development of an inexpensive and
quick clinical diagnostic method would significantly
improve our understanding of obesity, which is a common health issue affecting a large numbers of individuals.

One of the major benefits of these DNA barcodes was the
ability to rapidly provide an accurate F/B ratio from a pool
of thousands of short sequencing reads generated by the
pyrosequencing method, without the need to assemble
sequences, perform multiple sequence alignments, generate phylogenetic reconstructions, or perform BLAST analyses. Therefore, our DNA barcodes used in combination
with pyrosequencing technology will be useful for clinical
diagnosis and for studies involving a large spectrum of
subjects and conditions such as exhaustive caloric intake
and antibiotic effects.

In this regard, the new high-throughput technology of
pyrosequencing [6] offers a cost-effective alternative to
traditional sequencing methods, particularly for metagenomic studies, but also for 16S rRNA-based microbial
diversity studies [7-9]. A comparison of the cost and highthroughput capacity of sequencing technologies indicated
that 454-Roche pyrosequencing generated far more
sequence data per run at a much lower cost (30 times)
than conventional dye-terminator sequencing [10]. The
short length of reads (100–250 base pairs) generated by
this new high-throughput technology, however, limits full
length bacterial 16S rRNA sequence assembly; thus, bacterial taxonomy characterization of mixed microbial samples remains a daunting task with the risk of chimera
production. In order to address this problem, recent studies have reported efficient methods for classifying short
sequences [11-13] at the phylum or genus taxonomic
level. In addition, short DNA-specific regions that exhibit
significant variability between bacterial species have been
recently investigated to avoid the computational challenge of full-length 16S rRNA sequence assembly
[5,8,14,15]. Thus far, however, the sensitivity of the primers used to target short specific or variable regions over the
entire bacterial domain is unclear due to the lack of
exhaustive 16S rRNA sequence testing.

Results

Since Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the main bacterial
phyla involved in alterations of the gut microbiota in
obese individuals, it would be useful to develop a faster
and less expensive method for monitoring variations in
their relative abundance. In this study, we report a
method for rapidly estimating the ratio of Firmicutes to
Bacteroidetes using thousands of pyrosequencing reads
generated from near-full 16S rRNA gene amplification
products or complete bacterial metagenomes. We identified two DNA barcodes as genomic signatures specific to
the 16S rRNA genes of species belonging to the Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes phylum. Such DNA barcodes for bacterial phyla are not short sequence tags added to PCR
products of microbial samples for massive parallel or barcoding pyrosequencing investigations [5,15].

DNA barcodes
The Bacteroidetes DNA barcode is a specific sequence of 12
nucleotides, while the Firmicutes barcode is a degenerate
sequence composed of 26 nucleotides (Table 1). Based on
the 16S rRNA gene sequence from B. fragilis (RDP-II accession number: S000000037), the Bacteroidetes DNA barcode spans base pairs 537 to 548. The Firmicutes DNA
barcode spans base pairs 1,163 to 1,188 of the 16S rRNA
gene from C. difficile (RDP-II accession number:
S000260455).
Sensitivity and specificity of the DNA barcodes
Figure 1 shows the high sensitivity inherent to the use of
DNA barcodes from Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla
when applied to the Ribosomal Database Project [16]
(RDP-II) and the Greengenes [17] database. The Bacteroidetes DNA barcode matches 96.52% and 93.60% of the
16S rRNA sequences from the Bacteroidetes phylum in the
RDP-II and Greengenes databases, respectively. Similarly,
the Firmicutes DNA barcode matches 96.43% and 95.28%
of the 16S rRNA sequences from the Firmicutes phylum in
the RDP-II and Greengenes databases, respectively.

The Bacteroidetes DNA barcode is also highly specific given
that 99.98% of the 113,000 16S rRNA sequences from the
RDP-II database do not possess this DNA barcode (Table
2). There are actually only 18 Firmicutes sequences, two
Planctomycetes sequences, and one Cyanobacteria sequence
that possess the Bacteroidetes DNA barcode. Using the
Greengenes database, the Bacteroidetes DNA barcode was
less specific, demonstrating sequence matches with a
greater number of phyla (7 of 15). The Firmicutes DNA
barcode was also highly specific, with 98.25% of all tested
16S rRNA sequences from the RDP-II database lacking

DNA barcodes or ARB tool were very close. A second dataset was obtained from a study of the gut microbiota of
obese mice [3] and included 5,088 16S rRNA sequences.
In this study, Ley et al. reported a 50% reduction in the
abundance of Bacteroidetes within obese mice compared
to a control group of lean mice. For the subset of mice
with the obese genotype, our estimate of the relative
abundance of Bacteroidetes was 22.27%, while the authors
reported a relative abundance of 22.86%. For the subset of
mice in the control group (lean mice), our method provided a Bacteroidetes abundance estimate of 36.45%, while
the authors found a relative abundance of 36.39% (Table
3).

this DNA barcode. Compared to the Bacteroidetes DNA
barcode, the loss in specificity observed with the Firmicutes DNA barcode is due to the fact that the latter matches
97.38% and 32.76% of sequences belonging to the Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria phyla, respectively, using the
RDP-II database (Table 2). However, These two phyla are
poorly represented in the intestinal microbial flora (<
0.15% of the total 16S rRNA sequences in each study) [14]. Finally, using the 335,830 sequences available in the
RDP-II database, the false-discovery rates for the Firmicutes
and the Bacteroidetes DNA barcode were found to be very
low, 0.90% (3035 of 335830) and 0.06% (105 of
335830), respectively.
Validation of DNA barcodes using full 16S rRNA gene
sequences
The 16S rRNA surveys based on the shotgun sequencing
method from 16S rRNA clone libraries allow full 16S
rRNA sequence assembly and can determine the relative
abundance of a bacterial phylum using the phylogeny
reconstruction ARB tool [18]. No significant statistical difference (P > 0.05) was found when the DNA barcode
method was used to assess Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
communities using four published 16S rRNA surveys of
the gut microbiota (Table 3).

The first dataset (11,831 sequences) was obtained from a
study of the diversity of human intestinal microbial flora
[1] that demonstrated the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
phyla represent 50.78% and 47.67%, respectively, of all
16S rRNA sequences. Applying our DNA barcode method
to the same dataset, we observed that 50.36% and 47.52%
of this dataset were represented by the Firmicutes and the
Bacteroidetes phyla, respectively (Table 3). Thus, the percentages obtained for the two bacterial phyla using the

In another study, Turnbaugh and colleagues analyzed the
increased capacity of the microbiome of obese mice to
harvest energy from their diet [2]. From a dataset consisting of 4,157 16S rRNA sequences, the authors demonstrated that the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the
obese donor and obese recipient groups was 28.74% and
31.88%, respectively. For these two groups, our results
indicated a nearly identical abundance of Bacteroidetes
(29.04% and 31.27%, respectively). In addition, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the lean groups was
equivalent using these two methods. The relative abundance of Firmicutes for the two obese groups, however,
was slightly different using our method (62.78% and
60.32%, respectively) and that reported by Turnbaugh et
al. (67.86% and 62.83%, respectively) (Table 3).
The final dataset was retrieved from a survey of 16S rRNA
sequences found in the gut microbiota of obese humans
subjected to a specific calorie-diet [4] and monitored for
the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.
While the differences between our results and those of this
study did not exceed 0.54% with regard to estimation of
Bacteroidetes abundance, the relative abundance of Firmicutes observed using these two methods differed by up to
4.64% (Table 3).
Discrepancies
There were only a few 16S rRNA sequences that were
resistant to equivalent taxonomic classification using the
three analytical methods: the ARB tool, the DNA barcode
method, and the RDP-II classifier. The vast majority of
16S rRNA sequences assigned to either the Firmicutes or
Bacteroidetes phyla were similarly classified using the ARB
tool (M1) or our DNA barcode (M2), therefore representing the "core" 16S rRNA sequence assignments (Figure 2,
M1 n M2). In addition to this core, assignment of a small
number of 16S rRNA sequences to the Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes phyla was performed exclusively by one
method or the other (Figure 2 M1\M2 and M2\M1), and
thus accounting for the discrepancies or ambiguous taxonomic assignments.

RDP-II: Ribosomal Database Project II. For each bacterial phylum of the RDP-II and Greengenes databases, the percentage of sequences possessing
the Bacteroidetes and/or the Firmicutes DNA barcode was calculated.

With regard to the 16S rRNA data presented by Eckburg et
al. [1], 17 of these sequences were assigned to the (Bacteroidetes) M2\M1 group, 62 were assigned to the (Firmicutes) M2\M1 group, and 12 were assigned to the
(Firmicutes) M1\M2 group (Figure 2). The most significant
discrepancy between M1 and M2 was observed with the
16S rRNA data from Turnbaugh et al. [2]. In this report,
178 sequences were assigned to the (Firmicutes) M2\M1
group, 88 were assigned to the (Firmicutes) M1\M2 group,
14 were assigned to the (Bacteroidetes) M1\M2 group, and
41 were assigned to the (Bacteroidetes) M2\M1 group (Figure 3).

The "RDP-II Classifier" (RC) method was used to obtain
additional 16S rRNA taxonomic assignments for the
sequences defined as discrepancies between M1 and M2.
We evaluated the agreement between the RPD-II classifier
and the sequence assignments of M1 and M2.
The 12 sequences in the (Firmicutes) M1\M2 group (Figure
2), which were assigned to the Firmicutes phylum by our
DNA barcode method, were classified into the Fusobacteria
phylum (nine sequences) and into a group related to the
Cyanobacteria phylum (three sequences) in the Eckburg et
al. study. Similarly, analyses using the RC method resulted
in the same classification as Eckburg's analysis with a
bootstrap confidence (Bc) superior to 95%, suggesting

that our Firmicutes DNA barcodes provided 12 false-positive results. This result was not surprising given that our
Firmicutes barcode matched a significant proportion of
sequences belonging to the Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria
phyla in the RDP-II and Greengenes databases (Table 2).
Moreover, the 62 sequences assigned to the (Firmicutes)
M2\M1 group and the 17 sequences assigned to the

Based on the16S rRNA data obtained by Turnbaugh et al.,
seven sequences among the 41 sequences assigned to the

the Bacteroidetes phylum as expected, but rather to the Firmicutes phylum (Bc > 90%). Interestingly, these seven
sequences also possessed the Firmicutes DNA barcode. In
addition, of the 14 sequences assigned to the (Bacteroidetes) M1\M2 group, six sequences were also classified as

from the 178 sequences assigned to the (Firmicutes)
M2\M1 group, the RC method classified five sequences in
the Bacteroidetes phylum (Bc > 90%) and not in the Firmicutes phylum. Moreover, of the 88 sequences assigned to
the (Firmicutes) M1\M2 group, only four were classified as
Firmicutes (Bc > 90%) using RC, suggesting the possibility
of 84 false-positives as a consequence of DNA barcode
application.
Thus, regardless of the method used, these results demonstrate the difficulty inherent to establishing the correct
phylum classification for a small number of complete 16S
rRNA sequences.
DNA barcodes applied to short 16S rRNA pyrosequencing
reads
Two pyrosequencing libraries generated in our laboratory
for studies related to bacterial diversity in mixed microbial
samples were analyzed. The first library was obtained
from a brain abscess of a patient at a Marseille hospital
and contained 2,612 reads with an average length of
95.78 base pairs. In parallel, results using classical Sanger
sequencing of a 16S rRNA clone library from the same
sample were used as a source of comparison. We analyzed
the F/B ratios using two different culture-independent

methods: 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and 16S rRNA clonal
Sanger sequencing. The results of the 16S rRNA clonal
Sanger sequencing method indicated that 50 of the clone
sequences belonged to the Bacteroidetes phylum, while 49
belonged to the Firmicutes phylum, resulting in an F/B
ratio of 0.98 (Table 4). Application of the DNA barcode
method indicated that 41 of the pyrosequencing reads
belonged to the Bacteroidetes phylum, while 39 belonged
to the Firmicutes phylum, resulting in an F/B ratio of 0.95.
We also analyzed the 2,612 reads using the sequence classification tool RDP-II classifier. The F/B ratio obtained
using this tool was 1.02 (Table 4); however, 1.03% of all
pyrosequencing reads obtained were too short in length to
be classified by the RDP-II tool. In addition and contrary
to our DNA barcode classification, the RDP-II classifier
limits the number of sequences that can be submitted
(30,000 per run). Finally, compared to the F/B ratio
obtained with the RDP-II classifier tool (1.02), the ratio
obtained with our DNA barcode method (0.95) was
closer to that obtained by clonal Sanger sequencing
(0.98).
The pyrosequencing error rate in the Bacteroidetes barcode
sequence, which contains 4 homopolymers (GGGTTTAAAGGG), was estimated to 8.89% (4 errors/45) for this
dataset. In all cases, the sequencing errors in the Bacteroidetes barcode sequence were due to a one base insertion

showed a one base insertion (T) in the homopolymer T
(Table 5).
A second pyrosequencing library from the sputum of a
cystic fibrosis (CF) patient from a Marseille hospital was
also analyzed. This library contained 4,499 reads with an
average length of 93.05 base pairs. A 16S rRNA clonal
Sanger sequencing approach was also applied to the same
CF sputum. The results of the two culture-independent
methods were similar, as indicated in Table 4. Results
from the clonal Sanger sequencing analysis indicated that
16 clone sequences belonged to the Firmicutes phylum,
while only one sequence was assigned to the Bacteroidetes
phylum (F/B = 16). Analysis of the 16S rRNA pyrosequencing data indicated that the Firmicutes DNA barcode
matched 34 sequence reads, while the Bacteroidetes DNA
barcode matched two sequence reads (F/B = 17).
DNA barcodes applied to metagenome pyrosequencing
From the metagenomic study performed by Turnbaugh et
al.[2], 1,046,611 and 677,384 pyrosequencing reads were
collected from Lean1 and Obese1 mice, respectively,
using the GS 20 pyrosequencer. The authors analyzed the

merged data (1,723,995 reads) by BLASTing against the
16S rRNA RDP-II database. Using this method, the
authors determined the total number of sequence reads
classified as 16S rRNA genes and the number of sequence
reads belonging to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla. This
analysis led to the determination of an F/B ratio of 2.14.
Using our DNA barcode method with this dataset
assigned 79 reads to the Firmicutes phylum and 33 reads
to the Bacteroidetes phylum, resulting in an F/B ratio of
2.39 (Table 4).

Discussion
Owing to the rapid accumulation of data coupled with
advances in sequencing technology – including the 454
Life Sciences GS FLX System sequencer [6], which generates more than 100 million bases per run – the development of methods capable of rapidly processing these data
has become essential. Thus, the aim of the present investigation was to provide a straightforward, accurate, inexpensive and rapid tool to estimate the relative abundance
of bacterial communities and the resulting F/B ratios from
thousands of 16S rRNA short sequencing reads, without
the need for any assembly procedure, multiple sequence
alignment, BLAST analysis, or phylogeny reconstruction.

The DNA barcode obtained for the Bacteroidetes phylum is
sensitive and specific. In the literature, Dick and Field
reported a 16S rRNA Bacteroidetes barcode that can be
used as a probe to estimate the occurrence of fecal Bacteroidetes [19]. As observed with our DNA barcode using the
RDP-II database, assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the Bacteroidetes DNA barcode reported by Dick and
Field produced a sensitivity score of 88.00% (compared to
96.52% for our Bacteroidetes barcode) and a specificity
score of a 99.25% (compared to 99.98% for our Bacteroidetes barcode). Thus, our Bacteroidetes barcode possesses
both greater sensitivity and greater specificity. Although
the Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria phyla are responsible
for a slight decrease in the specificity of our Firmicutes barcode, the relative proportion of both of these phyla is marginal (less than 0.15% of all 16S rRNA sequences in each
16S rRNA survey [1-4]).
Compared to the nearly completed 16S rRNA sequences
assembled from four clone library surveys of gut microbiota, the results obtained using our 16S rRNA barcode
application are in agreement (P > 0.05). Importantly,
there are some discrepancies that highlight several limitations of the bioinformatics and biological methodologies.
First, it is possible that some sequences belonging to the
Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes phyla may not be identified
using our method since the sensitivity of our DNA barcode is less than 100%. Moreover, due to limited specificity (less than 100% for our DNA barcode), some falsepositives may be introduced into the results. Another discrepancy is caused by the requirement for polymerase
chain reaction and its capacity to generate sequencing
errors. A single base sequencing error (substitution or
deletion) located in the region of a conserved nucleotide
comprising the DNA barcode may result in a false-positive
or false-negative result. The quality of the sequencing
analysis and the sequence assembly process are important
to the quality of the results obtained using the DNA barcode method.
The results provided by the RDP-II "classifier" taxonomic
assignment method suggest that there are few errors in the
taxonomic classification of the 16S rRNA sequences from
the clone libraries and emphasize the need to benchmark
the tools used in such analyses. To estimate the abundance of phyla within a bacterial community using the
phylogenetic reconstruction ARB tool, 16S rRNA surveys
of the intestinal microbial flora first target the computation of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) with the
NAST multialigner [20] or the autoaligner of the ARB software. It is obvious that the quality of the phylogenetic
reconstruction is directly related to the accuracy of the
sequence alignment analysis. In many cases, an alignment
is considered biologically satisfactory when it accurately
reflects the structural relationship between the given

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/576

sequences. As a consequence, MSA algorithms are typically benchmarked with a collection of structure-based
sequence alignments [21,22], which are considered to be
gold standards [23]. In contrast, the processing methods
involved in 16S rRNA studies suffer from a lack of benchmarking tests or gold standard references [24]. Thus, the
recent MSA programs [18,20] capable of aligning large
quantities of 16S rRNA sequences must be evaluated for
their alignment accuracy, as currently performed for Muscle, T-COFFEE, MAFFT, Probcons, and the Clustalw MSA
programs for protein sequences [25,26]. Recently, Carroll
et al. [27] proposed the first DNA database of 3,545 DNA
reference alignments. Finally, because the accuracy of phylogeny reconstruction depends on the number of informative sites, the short pyrosequencing reads collected by the
GS 20 are theoretically not suitable for inferring phylogenic reconstruction. In a study performed by Zongzhi et
al. [14], however, alignment of short pyrosequencing
reads by NAST and insertion of these sequences into a preestablished phylogenic tree of full-length 16S rRNA gene
sequences using ARB provided satisfactory results. While
laborious data analyses involving sequencing of the 16S
rRNA clone library enable the characterization of bacterial
taxonomy at the species level, they do not represent an
effective, low-cost strategy for clinical diagnosis or for
monitoring F/B ratio variations in a large spectrum of
obese humans.
In contrast, 16S rRNA or metagenome pyrosequencing
offers an inexpensive and rapid strategy that can exploit
the use of a DNA barcode representative of a bacterial
phylum to process thousands of short sequence reads. The
short read lengths of pyrosequencing are sufficient to successfully estimate F/B ratios using the DNA barcode
method, but because our Bacteroidetes barcode contains
homopolymers and because errors in pyrosequencing
reads (indels and ambiguous bases) occur most often in
homopolymeric regions [28], the proportion of Bacteroidetes can be underestimated (Table 5). Finally, we
assume a similar pyrosequencing error rate in the Bacteroidetes and in the Firmicutes barcodes since the F/B ratios
obtained with the pyrosequencing and the clonal Sanger
sequencing data were closed (Table 4).
A short pattern search against a significantly large
sequence database (e.g., metagenome data) is less timeconsuming with respect to CPU time and much faster
than performing the BLAST search algorithm against a 16S
rRNA database. Moreover, results from the BLAST analysis
require that the identified species be grouped by phylum
using a tool such as the ARB tool.
The evolution of pyrosequencing strategies has focused on
targeting of specific regions [14] and maximizing multiplexing capabilities (massive parallel or barcoding pyrose-

quencing), allowing independent samples to be pooled
together and sequenced in a single run due to a short tag
carried at the 5'end of the primer [5,15]. Since the DNA
barcodes for Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are separated by
approximately 600 bp, they cannot be sequenced in the
same read using pyrosequencing technology. An alternative method using distinct DNA amplification (with two
primer sets) of the 16S rRNA region of Bacteroidetes and
Firmicutes barcodes would not be an effective strategy due
to differences in amplification efficiency [29]. In the near
future, however, rapid technical advances (~400–500
bases for the next-generation GS FLX titanium instrument) will likely increase the read length and overcome
this drawback, which currently prevents massive parallel
and specific region pyrosequencing strategies.
Finally, these DNA barcodes should permit the development of real-time PCR assays using the barcode as a probe.
This will be an elegant, low cost, and effective application
for day-to-day use in clinical settings.

Conclusion

Greengenes database [31], the sequences of the bacterial
phyla were exported using the NCBI taxonomy.
Full 16S rRNA sequences retrieved from clonal Sanger
sequencing datasets
The 16S rRNA datasets (sequences, alignment, and phylogenetic tree) obtained from the Ley et al. 16S rRNA surveys
[3,4] were retrieved from an ARB file located at [32] and
[33]. For each ARB file, the sequences assigned to Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were extracted and imported in
Fasta file format. The relative abundance of the major bacterial communities of all complete 16S rRNA gene studies
was calculated from the Fasta format files. It was necessary
to install the ARB software package [34] to access these
data. The 16S rRNA dataset (sequences, alignment, and
phylogenetic tree) obtained from the Eckburg et al. study
[1] were downloaded from [35]. Complementary results
were obtained upon request. The last 16S rRNA dataset
(sequences, alignment, and phylogenetic tree) acquired
from the Turnbaugh et al. study [2] was selected from [36].

Based on a DNA barcode for 16S rRNA gene sequences, we
have proposed a useful and practical, yet low cost strategy
to effectively evaluate obesity in humans. This is accomplished using a method that rapidly determines the F/B
ratio present in a patient. Our DNA barcodes target the
two major phyla of the gastrointestinal bacterial community, which show changes in their abundance in obese
humans. Additionally, these DNA barcodes are capable of
rapidly processing thousands of short sequencing reads.
The F/B ratios that result from 16S rRNA clonal Sanger
sequencing, 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, and metagenome
pyrosequencing can be accurately estimated using our
DNA barcodes.

DNA barcode identification
The general procedure used to define the final DNA barcode is described in the flow chart in Figure 4. Extraction
of the N most representative sequences was performed
with the Seq_reformat program, a part of the T-COFFEE
package [37]. This extraction discarded sequence redundancy and reduced the time calculation for pattern search.
The MEME search motif program [38] was installed
locally and run using default options. The patterns were
tested against the 16S rRNA sequences of the databases
using Dreg, an EMBOSS package program. For Firmicutes,
the final barcode was refined manually via multiple
sequence alignments of the phylum. Muscle version 3.56
was performed for the multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) and Seaview [39] executable for the MSA edition.

The short length of the reads that result from highthroughput pyrosequencing coupled with the high degree
of nucleotide conservation among the 16S rRNA genes
prevents sequence assembly. Consequently, short DNA
fragments exploited as DNA tags or barcodes that enable
the characterization of taxonomy at the phylum, genus, or
species level represent tools that are adapted to assist in
clinical diagnosis and monitoring relevant changes in the
relative abundance of bacterial communities in microbial
ecosystems.

Evaluation of DNA barcodes with reduced 16S rRNA data
The Firmicutes signature was not applied to the dataset
obtained from the Ley et al. study [3] because more than
1,500 sequences of the 5,088 had a length inferior to
1,200 bp. Similarly, the dataset obtained from the Ley et
al. study [4] was reduced from 18,348 to 16,615
sequences because several sequences were too short to
potentially possess the Firmicutes barcode.

Methods
16S rRNA RDP-II and Greengenes databases
The 16S rRNA sequences of the bacterial phyla were
downloaded from the Ribosomal Database Project-II site
[30]. Both "isolates" and "uncultured" sequences greater
than 1,200 bp were selected. Only those sequences
defined as "Good Quality" were retrieved. From the

Sensitivity and specificity of DNA barcodes
The sensitivity of the DNA barcode was defined as the
fraction of 16S rRNA sequences of the phylum that possessed the barcode. The specificity of the DNA barcode
was defined as the fraction of sequences of a phylum that
did not possess the barcode.

Taxonomic assignment
We used a Naïve Bayesian rRNA classifier [40] to compare
discrepancies between the results of our DNA barcode
method and those of 16S rRNA surveys [1-4].
Discrepancies
M1 represents the DNA barcode method used herein, and
M2 is the method applied in the 16S rRNA studies [1-4].
M1 n M2 was the number of sequences identically classified by both methods. The n(Firmicutes) M1\M2 indicates
n sequences were assigned to Firmicutes phylum by M1,
but not by M2. The n(Bacteroidetes) M2\M1 indicates n
sequences were assigned to the Bacteroidetes phylum by
M2, but not by M1.
Clonal Sanger sequencing libraries
The DNA extraction, genomic amplification, cloning procedures, and sequencing are described in Bittar et al. [41].
From the brain abscess cerebral sample, a library of 100
sequencing clones was analyzed. From the cystic fibrosis
sputum, a library of 36 sequencing clones was analyzed.
Sequencing errors in the Bacteroidetes barcode
Identification of sequencing errors in the Bacteroidetes barcode was performed by BLAST similarity search against
the pyrosequencing dataset of the brain abscess sample
using an extended barcode consensus sequence (CCGGANTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGNGCG) from all the Bacteroidetes sequences identified by clonal Sanger sequencing.
Reads classified as member of the Bacteroidetes phylum by
RDP-II classifier (BP > 95) and with sequencing errors in
the Bacteroidetes barcode were labelled 002964_0126_24
23, 000955_0116_2845, 003177_0112_2481 and 00184
0_0197_1892.
Pyrosequencing libraries
The 16S pyrosequencing sequences from cystic fibrosis
sputum were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive
under accession number SRS001099 and taxid 433733.
The 16S pyrosequencing sequences from the pus of a
brain abscess were deposited in the NCBI Short Read
Archive under accession number SRS001098 and taxid
539654. Following the conditions detailed in Margulies et
al. [6], PCR products (the amplicon size is about 1460 bp)
were sequenced with the GS 20 platform (454 Life Science-Roche) using a titration 40 × 75 Picotitreplate™
(PTP) with eight regions. Four conditions were tested and
duplicated as described by the Roche procedure, and bioinformatics analysis was performed for the dataset from
the region that was closest to the optimal condition
(accession number SRS001099 and SRS001098) of one
DNA copy per bead.
