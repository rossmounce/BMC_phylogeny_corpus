Abstract
Background: Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a member of a distinctive group of single-celled parasitic
eukaryotes called microsporidia, which are closely related to fungi. Some of these organisms,
including E. cuniculi, also have uniquely small genomes that are within the prokaryotic range. Thus,
E. cuniculi has undergone a massive genome reduction which has resulted in a loss of genes from
diverse biological pathways, including those that act in DNA repair.
DNA repair is essential to any living cell. A loss of these mechanisms invariably results in
accumulation of mutations and/or cell death. Six major pathways of DNA repair in eukaryotes
include: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination repair (HRR), mismatch
repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER) and methyltransferase
repair. DNA polymerases are also critical players in DNA repair processes.
Given the close relationship between microsporidia and fungi, the repair mechanisms present in E.
cuniculi were compared to those of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to ascertain how the process
of genome reduction has affected the DNA repair pathways.
Results: E. cuniculi lacks 16 (plus another 6 potential absences) of the 56 DNA repair genes sought
via BLASTP and PSI-BLAST searches. Six of 14 DNA polymerases or polymerase subunits are also
absent in E. cuniculi. All of these genes are relatively well conserved within eukaryotes. The absence
of genes is not distributed equally among the different repair pathways; some pathways lack only
one protein, while there is a striking absence of many proteins that are components of both double
strand break repair pathways. All specialized repair polymerases are also absent.
Conclusion: Given the large number of DNA repair genes that are absent from the double strand
break repair pathways, E. cuniculi is a prime candidate for the study of double strand break repair
with minimal machinery. Strikingly, all of the double strand break repair genes that have been
retained by E. cuniculi participate in other biological pathways.

Background
DNA repair in eukaryotes
DNA repair processes are vital to all living organisms.
Without appropriate mechanisms to remove and replace
damaged bases and nucleotides, multiple lesions would

accumulate, leading to total genome degradation and loss
of vital genetic information. DNA lesions take many
forms, including single strand and double strand breaks,
in addition to inter- and intra-strand crosslinks and modified bases. Several pathways operate in a concerted man-

ner to minimize information loss each time a DNA lesion
occurs. Many of these fundamental pathways have been
conserved throughout eukaryotes, and many eukaryotic
enzymes have homologues in prokaryotes [1].
Eukaryotic DNA repair can be divided into six primary
pathways, all of which are conserved [2]. Some types of
DNA lesions (such as double stranded breaks) can be recognized and repaired by more than one pathway. Therefore there is some overlap in function between pathways
[2]. Mismatch repair (MMR), base excision repair (BER)
and nucleotide excision repair (NER) all operate to repair
aberrant bases or nucleotides from one strand of the double helix, using the other strand as a template for new
DNA synthesis. In contrast, methyltransferase repair does
not require the synthesis of new DNA; anomalous methyl
groups are removed without causing any breaks in the
double helix. Non-homologous end joining repair
(NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) are
double strand break repair pathways [2]. Double strand
breaks are one of the most detrimental forms of DNA
lesions, as they can cause genome fragmentation and
apoptosis if they are not properly repaired [3]. (See Figure
1 for a comparison of DNA repair processes.)
DNA polymerases are key players in DNA repair, as they
are required to fill in gaps created by repair enzymes or
incurred from damage [4]. Eukaryotic cells have a wide
range of polymerases that are specialized in function; certain polymerases act almost solely in genome replication,
others are only active at DNA lesions, and a few have dual
roles in repair and replication [4].
For consistency, the names of the genes and proteins
involved in these pathways will be referred to using Saccharomyces cerevisiae nomenclature.
Genome reduction in Encephalitozoon cuniculi
Encephalitozoon cuniculi belongs to a group of obligate
intracellular parasites known as microsporidia. These
organisms infect a variety of animals including fish,
insects and mammals. Various microsporidia have gained
the attention of the medical community in the past few
decades due to their infection of immuno-compromised
humans, such as AIDS and chemotherapy patients [5].

Microsporidian genomes range in size from 2.3 Mbp to
19.5 Mbp. The only completely sequenced microsporidian genome, that of E. cuniculi, is a mere 2.9 Mbp in size
[6]. The E. cuniculi genome is smaller than that of other
eukaryotes for several reasons: it has fewer and shorter
genes that are separated by tiny intergenic spaces and are
only interrupted by a few short introns [6]. Given the
degree of genome reduction, the effects are evident in
most cellular processes, including DNA repair.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/24

The precise phylogenetic position of microsporidia is not
yet known, but a large body of evidence indicates that they
are closely related to the fungi [6–10 and others]. Therefore, E. cuniculi's DNA repair systems have been compared
primarily to those of another fungus, the yeast S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae's repair pathways have been well studied
at the functional level, making this organism ideal for
comparative purposes. In order to gain an accurate perspective of what genes have been lost from E. cuniculi during the process of genome reduction (i.e., genes that were
present in the common ancestor of microsporidia and
fungi), only genes that have homologues in animals were
examined.

Results
DNA repair inventory
Comparison of DNA repair proteins in S. cerevisiae to E.
cuniculi's genome and proteome via BLAST and PSI-BLAST
searches has revealed that E. cuniculi appears to contain a
reduced set of proteins in all major repair pathways. Of
the 56 repair genes that were sought in E. cuniculi, 16 are
absent, with another 6 potentially absent. Six out of 14
DNA polymerases or polymerase subunits are absent (See
Table 1). Although all repair pathways have been reduced,
the loss of genes is not distributed evenly among pathways. Each process has been affected differently by
genome reduction. A detailed discussion of the components of each pathway is presented below.
Base excision repair (BER)
BER is one of the least complex of the DNA repair mechanisms, and involves only a small number of proteins.
When a base becomes damaged, it is recognized by a DNA
glycosylase that is specific for the particular base and/or
the type of damage (methylation, oxidation, etc.). S. cerevisiae contains four types of glycosylases, although far
more have been found in other organisms (animals, bacteria, etc.) [11]. Glycosylases cleave the glycosylic bond
between the base and the deoxyribose to remove the damaged base, at which point a non-specific apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease (Apn1 or Apn2) removes the
remaining deoxyribose phosphate to create a gap [12]. In
short patch BER (which replaces a single nucleotide), the
gap is filled by DNA polymerase β. In long patch BER
(which replaces two or more nucleotides), the DNA
polymerases β, or δ and ε in concert with proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) synthesize several nucleotides
which displace the original DNA strand. Rad27 then
removes the displaced DNA. The ligase Cdc9 (or DNA
ligase III and Xrcc1 in other eukaryotes) is used to seal the
nick [13,14].

The Rad1-Rad10 and Mus81-Mms4 endonucleases are
also believed to play minor roles in BER by processing the

3' ends of the DNA once an incision has been made into
the sugar-phosphate backbone [12].
E. cuniculi's BER pathway appears to be nearly complete,
but lacks DNA polymerase β, the Cdc9 DNA ligase (but
possesses Xrcc1, the cofactor of the ligase used in this
process in some eukaryotes) and part of a 3' endonuclease, Mms4. (See Table 1) Deletion of either polymerase β
or Mms4 is not a lethal mutation in yeast, however S. cerevisiae cannot survive in the absence of Cdc9 [15].
Another ligase is likely utilized for BER in E. cuniculi, as
sharing non-specialized enzymes between pathways is not
uncommon in S. cerevisiae (see discussion), and there is
no reason to believe that this is not the case in E. cuniculi.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER)
NER is used primarily to remove bulky lesions from DNA,
such as inter- and intra-strand crosslinks. NER is a more
complex process than BER, and utilizes a large number of
proteins that are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes. NER is comprised of two subpathways, global

genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair
(TCR). As is suggested by their names, the subpathways
act on different types of DNA: DNA that is not transcribed
(or the non-transcribed strands of expressed genes), and
actively transcribed DNA, respectively. In both GGR and
TCR, DNA damage recognition is the first step to occur,
followed by DNA unwinding. Next, incisions are made on
either side of the aberrant base(s), and a total of 25–30
nucleotides on either side are removed as a single strand.
The gap is then filled by DNA polymerase and sealed by
DNA ligase. Recruitment of five multi-protein complexes,
nucleotide excision repair factors (NEFs) 1 through 4 and
the replication protein A (RPA) complex, is believed to
take place in a stepwise manner to complete this process.
The RPA complex is composed of Rpa1 and Rpa2 and recognizes damaged DNA.
In GGR, the first protein complex to arrive at the damaged
site is NEF4, which recognizes damage and is composed of
the proteins Rad7 and Rad16. Rad7 binds the NEF2 complex (Rad4/Rad23), recruiting it to the damaged site and

Presence or absence in E. cuniculi is indicated (as defined in Methods), along with the genbank accession numbers for both S. cerevisiae and E. cuniculi proteins. Absent proteins
are presented in bold type. Italicized accession numbers indicate that the presence or absence of these proteins in E. cuniculi was unclear. (See results for more information.)
When S. pombe proteins appeared to be more conserved among eukaryotes than S. cerevisiae homologues (or where S. cerevisiae homologues do not exist), they were used
to conduct the BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches. These proteins are marked with asterixes. S. cerevisiae nomenclature is used, with S. pombe or animal homologues given in
brackets. Pathway components were largely compiled from the following sources: MMR from Marti et al. [22], BER from Boiteux and Guillet [12], NER from Prakash and
Prakash [17], NHEJ from Daley et al. [57], HRR from Aylon and Kupiec [24], DNA polymerases from Burgers [58] and Hubscher et al., [4].

increasing DNA binding efficiency. The presence of NEF4
is not strictly required for the recruitment of NEF2 to the
DNA lesion, but facilitates the process. The above proteins
do not act in the other sub-pathway; in TCR, initiation of
repair takes place when an RNA polymerase stalls. Two
proteins involved specifically in TCR, Rad26 and Rad28,
also participate in the beginning of this process [16].
In both GGR and TCR, NEF1 and NEF3 are the next components to be recruited, and are held at the damage site by
NEF2. NEF1 is composed of Rad1, Rad10 and Rad14,
while NEF3 is composed of Rad2 and transcription elongation factor IIH (TFIIH). TFIIH contains the Rad3,
Rad25, SSL1, TFB1, TFB2 and TFB3 proteins, and provides
the single strand DNA helicases required for repair proteins to access the damaged site. Rad1 and Rad10 form a
heterodimer that acts as a single strand endonuclease at
the 5' end of the stretch of damaged DNA and Rad2 is a
single strand endonuclease that cuts at the 3' end. RPA is
thought to be the last player to arrive at the scene.
Many of these proteins also have roles in other cellular
processes, such as recombination and transcription, therefore mutants express defects in several pathways. For a
comprehensive review of NER, see Prakash and Prakash
[17].
Most proteins participating in NER are present in E.
cuniculi, with two exceptions. Half of a GGR heterodimeric damage sensor complex (Rad23) and the Tfb1
subunit of TFIIH appear to be absent (See Table 1). Rad23
appears to have diverse functions within the cell, ranging
from DNA repair to the regulation of a cell-cycle checkpoint and protein degradation. Specifically, this protein
helps to prevent the degradation of Rad4, as well as serving a role with the 26S proteasome in regulating the NER
pathway [18,19]. Deletion of Tfb1 in S. cerevisiae is lethal
[20], likely due to loss of function in transcription.
The presence or absence of Rad7 and Rad16 were not confirmed, as BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches using S. cerevisiae and S. pombe sequences as queries did not return
homologues from most animals or other eukaryotes
besides fungi.
Methyltransferase Repair
Methyltransferases are present in both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes and remove certain DNA lesions involving
methylation (O6-methylguanine, O4-methylthymine).
These proteins irreversibly relocate methyl groups from
DNA to their own cysteine residues, and are therefore suicide enzymes [21].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/24

E. cuniculi does not possess the methyltransferase found
in other eukaryotes, Mgt1. Deletion of this gene is not
lethal in S. cerevisiae [15].
Mismatch repair (MMR)
In MMR, mismatches are recognized by the heterodimers
MutSα (Msh2/Msh6) and MutSβ (Msh2/Msh3). Single
base mismatches are recognized by MutSα and insertion/
deletion loops (IDLs) less than about 9 nucleotides in
length are recognized by MutSβ [22]. Both MutSα and
MutSβ can recognize a single unpaired nucleotide. PCNA
is also involved in MMR, perhaps assisting in these initial
recognition steps. MutLα (Mlh1/Pms1) binds MutSα and
β and allows them to efficiently bind to IDLs and mismatches. The exonuclease Exo1 then excises the mismatched base(s) and a DNA polymerase and DNA ligase
fill and seal the gap.

It should be noted that the proteins required for the MMR
process differ among eukaryotes. For instance, Drosophila
and Caenorhabditis lack Msh3 homologues, and therefore
do not require them for the removal of IDLs [22].
Schizosaccharomyces does possess a Msh3 homologue, but
it appears to play a different role within the cell, instead
participating in recombination [23].
The majority of S. cerevisiae MMR proteins are present in
E. cuniculi. The sole missing protein is Msh3, a subunit of
the MutSβ heterodimer that recognizes small IDLs (See
Table 1). Deletion of this gene in S. cerevisiae is not lethal
(See discussion) [20].
Homologous recombination repair (HRR)
HRR is the major form of double strand break repair utilized in yeast. A double stranded break is recognized by
damage recognition proteins, and single stranded overhangs are generated at both sides of the break. A region of
the genome that is homologous to the single stranded
overhangs is then found. Strand invasion follows, and the
homologous (non-damaged) DNA is used as a template
for synthesis on the broken strand. HRR is completed
through re-annealing of the broken DNA strand and ligation. See figure 2 for an overview of this process.

The Rad51, 52, 54, 55 and 57 proteins perform most steps
of the HRR process. Rad51 is a homologue of the bacterial
enzyme RecA, and is well conserved within eukaryotes.
When a double strand break is formed, the MRX complex
(which is composed of Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2, and also
acts in NHEJ) is involved in damage recognition. The
DNA ends on either side of the break are then chewed
back in the 5' to 3' direction by an unknown nuclease.
Rad24 (which is a checkpoint protein as well) is also
involved in end processing. The results of this process are
short 3' overhangs on either strand. RPA (which also acts

others are absent. Newly synthesized DNA is indicated in grey. Although the MRX complex (Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2) acts in damage recognition in this pathway, it is not shown. (Modified from Aylon and Kupiec [24].)

in NER, as described above) then coats the overhangs.
RPA is later replaced by Rad51, with the aid of Rad52,
Rad55/Rad57, and very likely Rad54 as a genome-wide
search for homologous sequences takes place. Strand
invasion then occurs while the helicase Hpr5 removes
Rad51 from the DNA. DNA is synthesized by an undetermined polymerase based on the donor template strands,
and then ligated. Although the mechanism is not clear, it
is evident that the Rad55/Rad57 complex is somehow
involved in this last step. The Sgs1 helicase plays a specific
role in the repair of double strand breaks generated by the
stalling of a replication fork. For a review of HRR, see
Aylon and Kupiec [24].
Three other signaling and damage sensor proteins are also
involved in the HRR pathway, as well as the BER pathway
and the NHEJ pathways. The Rad17/Med3/Ddc1 (9-1-1)
complex triggers DNA damage checkpoints [25], and
stimulates repair pathways [26] as well as various individual repair proteins, including DNA polymerase β [27],
Rad51 [28] (HRR), Rad27 [29] (BER, NHEJ) and Cdc9
[30] (BER).
E. cuniculi lacks more than half of the proteins involved in
the HRR pathway. Almost all steps of the process are
affected by these losses (see discussion). Missing proteins
include the Hpr5 helicase, Rad54 and Rdh54 (See Figure
2, Table 1). Rad24 and the 9-1-1 complex are all absent
from the cell signaling pathways. S. cerevisiae single
mutants lacking these proteins are viable [20], likely due
to yeast's ability to use either double strand break repair
pathway (HRR or NHEJ) to fix damaged DNA.
The presence or absence of Rad55 and Rad57 was not
determined. Rad55 and Rad57 are paralogs of Rad51. PSIBLAST searches using S. cerevisiae Rad55 and Rad57 proteins retrieve Rad51 in other fungi, therefore making it difficult to discern the presence of these proteins in E.
cuniculi, which is related to fungi.
Non-homologous end joining repair (NHEJ)
NHEJ is the second form of double strand break repair
that is a separate, though not completely independent
pathway from HRR. In S. cerevisiae this method of double
strand break repair plays a minor role compared to the
HRR pathway. Upon double strand break formation,
damage is recognized and both ends of the lesion are
brought together through the action of several proteins. A
minimal amount of DNA synthesis occurs, which is followed by ligation. As DNA on either side of the break may
be degenerated before the break is repaired, the potential
for information loss in this case is substantial [24].

The NHEJ process begins when the Ku complex (Ku70/
Ku80) binds either end of the double strand break (See Fig

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/24

3). These proteins are DNA-dependent protein kinases
that also have a role in telomere maintenance. Once
bound to the damaged site, the Ku complex is responsible
for recruiting the MRX complex for the next stage in the
repair process. The MRX complex is composed of Rad50
(an ATP binding protein), Mre11 (a 5'-3' exonuclease)
and Xrs2 (responsible for aligning the MRX complex with
the break site) [31]. Dnl4/Lif1 (a DNA ligase complex) is
tethered to the break site by Xrs2 and the Ku complex. The
DNA polymerase Pol4 and the structure-specific nuclease
Rad27 are the last players to arrive at the scene, thus completing the repair complex.
All of the yeast NHEJ proteins are present in most eukaryotes, and the core of Ku70 and 80 is homologous to a
smaller bacterial protein that performs the same function,
thus indicating a large degree of conservation. For a review
of this process, see Hefferin and Tomkinson [32].
E. cuniculi is missing nearly all NHEJ proteins. Absent proteins include Ku70, Ku80, Xrs2, Dnl4, and Pol4 (See Fig 3,
Table 1). As is the case with single S. cerevisiae mutants for
genes involved in the HRR pathway, most are viable [20]
due to yeast's ability to rely on the other (HRR) double
strand break repair pathway.
Although there are animal homologues of Lif1 and Xrs2
(Xrcc4 and Nbs1, respectively), BLASTP and PSI-BLAST
searches using yeast proteins did not retrieve homologues
in any organisms other than fungi. The presence or
absence of these proteins is therefore not known.
DNA polymerases
DNA polymerases are essential for both genome replication and repair. There are several polymerases present in
eukaryotic cells, all of which serve particular functions
within the cell. The polymerases α, δ and ε act in the process of genome replication, but also play roles in certain
repair processes, notably NER and HRR. Polymerase γ acts
solely within mitochondria, while all other polymerases
are nuclear. Polymerase β is a specialized repair polymerase that is involved in BER and NHEJ. The polymerases ζ,
η and Rev1 help prevent double stranded DNA breaks
from forming during replication due to their ability to
synthesize DNA through a lesion, where polymerases α, δ
and ε stall and dissociate from the replication fork [4].

Of the 8 polymerases identified in S. cerevisiae that have
human counterparts (confirming that they are not fungal
or ascomycete specific), E. cuniculi possesses 3: α, δ and ε
(See Table 1). All three of these polymerases are necessary
for viability in S. cerevisiae. All of the polymerases that are
absent in E. cuniculi are utilized solely for repair or lesion
bypass and are not essential for viability, likely because
their function is replaced by other polymerases [20].

Discussion
In general, the consequences of genome reduction on
DNA repair in E. cuniculi are most evident in the double
strand break pathways. The single strand repair pathways
have been less affected, but some are operating at a level
of reduced complexity compared to S. cerevisiae.
Reduction in complexity of DNA repair
E. cuniculi's BER pathway lacks the DNA ligase Cdc9, DNA
polymerase β and Mms4. Although deletion of Cdc9 is
lethal in S. cerevisiae [20], the role of this protein is likely
filled by another ligase. This is not unusual in S. cerevisiae,
as several enzymes are sometimes able to act on the same
substrate. For example, in the HRR pathway, the polymerase and nuclease have not yet been defined, likely because
different combinations of polymerases and nucleases are
capable of performing the required functions of this pathway [24]. The absence of DNA polymerase β could indicate that most BER in E. cuniculi is carried out via the long
patch pathway, where DNA is synthesized by the polymerases δ and ε. The use of one BER pathway over another is
common in eukaryotes; studies have indicated that in
yeast, long patch BER is carried out preferentially instead
of short patch BER, whereas in humans, the reverse is true
[13]. The absence of Mms4 is not likely to have serious
ramifications for BER in E. cuniculi. The Mus81-Mms4
endonuclease processes 3' ends of nicked DNA to prepare
for DNA synthesis. However, its role is predicted to be
minor, and somewhat overlapping with that of the Rad1Rad10 endonuclease, which is present [12].

The NER pathway is missing a core TFIIH component and
the Rad23 subunit of the Rad4/Rad23 damage recognition complex. TFIIH is composed of a ring containing the
three Tfb proteins (Tfb1, Tfb2, and Tfb3), which serve to
tether the functional parts of the complex: the helicases
Rad3 and Rad25 [33]. Since transcription must occur in E.
cuniculi, it is difficult to predict exactly how the absence of
these proteins would affect this organism, as deletion of
Tfb1 is lethal in S. cerevisiae. Complete absence of this protein is difficult to reconcile with the Tfb ring's essential
functions, as well as the presence of the two other ring
components (See below). However, it is not unreasonable
to assume that the absence of Tfb1 would likely lead to a
reduction in the efficiency of this repair process, particularly when Rad23 also appears to be absent.
E. cuniculi also lacks Msh3, which interacts with Msh2 to
form MutSβ, which recognizes insertion or deletion loops
(IDLs) in the MMR pathway. In S. cerevisiae, deletion of
Msh3 is not lethal, but mutants are slightly more prone to
frameshift mutations [15]. Although the MutSβ heterodimer is present in S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces,
humans and Arabidopsis, its presence is not ubiquitous
among eukaryotes. Drosophila and Caenorhabditis lack

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/24

Msh3, where it appears that the MutSα complex is able to
recognize both mismatches and insertion or deletion
loops [22].
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis are able to effectively perform MMR in the absence of Msh3, which is the sole missing protein in E. cuniculi. Therefore, it is very likely that
this pathway operates in E. cuniculi in a similar manner to
these organisms, whose MMR systems are fully functional.
The absence of the DNA methyltransferase Mgt1 suggests
that E. cuniculi is able to employ other methods to remove
O6-methylguanine from its DNA. In the bacterium
Escherichia coli, O6-methylguanine can be removed by
both the NER and the methyltransferase mechanisms
[34], therefore it is likely that E. cuniculi has simply dispensed with one of two parallel pathways.
DNA polymerases and repair
Eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess many specialized
DNA polymerases to accomplish specific tasks within the
cell. Some of these polymerases are involved in genome
replication, while others act solely in repair processes.

E. cuniculi possesses only three DNA polymerases (α, δ
and ε) of the 8 present in S. cerevisiae. All of these
polymerases are involved in standard genome replication,
while polymerase δ also plays a role in BER, NER, MMR
and in bypassing DNA lesions [4]. Polymerase ε is
required for BER and probably NER. Polymerases α, δ and
ε are all likely utilized in HRR [4]. E. cuniculi lacks
polymerase β, which is utilized in a variety of repair pathways and polymerases ζ and η, which are used for errorprone and error-free DNA synthesis across lesions, respectively [4]. E. cuniculi also lacks the mitochondrial DNA
polymerase γ.
S. cerevisiae mutants lacking polymerase β display a high
frequency of recombination and sensitivity to methyl
methanesulfonate (MMS). Rev1 mutants display
decreased revertibility, while polymerase η mutants have
a heightened sensitivity to UV radiation. Conversely,
polymerase ζ deletion mutants resist UV mutagenesis.
Cells lacking polymerase γ lose their mitochondrial DNA
[15], however microsporidian mitochondria (mitosomes)
are highly reduced and it is unlikely that they possess
autonomous DNA [35]. The phenotype of a S. cerevisiae
cell lacking several polymerases is not known, but one
could speculate that such cells would display a higher frequency of double stranded DNA breaks generated during
replication due to a lack of translesion polymerases.
Double strand break repair in E. cuniculi
The fact that most of the NHEJ repair proteins appear to
be absent in E. cuniculi is perhaps not overly surprising, as

Page 10 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:24

this method of double strand break repair appears to be a
back-up method in yeast [24]. (Note that this preference
is not strictly maintained throughout eukaryotic life.
Humans, for example, use NHEJ as the primary pathway
[1].) E. cuniculi's genome is known to be highly reduced
compared to that of S. cerevisiae. Therefore, it seems logical that the first genes to be deleted from a genome undergoing reduction would be those encoding proteins that
act in back-up pathways.
Of key interest is the lack of Ku proteins (Ku70 and Ku80)
in E. cuniculi. These proteins play a pivotal role in NHEJ;
they are involved in recognizing double strand break sites
and in recruiting other repair factors to the break site. Not
only is their function key, but they are present in archaebacteria, bacteria and eukaryotes. The core of the Ku proteins is largely conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes
[32]. However, the absence of these proteins in E. cuniculi
is not entirely unique, as we were also unable to identify
Ku proteins in the genome of the human parasite Plasmodium, nor has it been recognized in Trichomonas [36].
Dispensing with a backup double strand break repair
pathway during genome reduction would stand to reason
if the primary repair pathway was retained, however, this
is also highly questionable. E. cuniculi also lacks over half
of the HRR proteins that are present in yeast (See Table 1).
The DNA helicase Hpr5, Rad54, Rdh54 and the checkpoint/DNA end-processing Rad24 are among the proteins
that appear to be absent from the HRR pathway. Hpr5
plays a cryptic role in HRR, as S. cerevisiae deletion
mutants have hyperrecombination phenotypes [37], and
the protein was therefore assumed to be a negative regulator of the process. However, recent work by Aylon et al.
[38] has shown that Hpr5 is intimately involved in commitment to gene conversion, which must take place
before recombination can occur. Rdh54 is a Rad54
homolog that participates in interhomologue gene conversion and meiosis [39], while Rad54 is a chromatin
remodeling protein that has been implicated in strand
invasion and the removal of repair proteins from DNA
after HRR has taken place [40]. In addition to functioning
as a checkpoint protein, Rad24 also plays a role in the
resection and recombination processes [41].
It is possible that the functions of Rad55 and Rad57
(which are potentially absent) are carried out by Rad51, as
all three proteins are homologues of the bacterial protein
RecA. This is a distinct possibility, as Rad55 and Rad57
appear to act in concert with Rad51 during the HRR process [24].
Although the Rad51, Rad52 and Sgs1 proteins are present
in E. cuniculi, it is not known whether HRR can take place

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/24

in the absence of all other HRR components. It is difficult
to imagine this process occurring in the absence of DNA
resection (Rad24), strand invasion (Rad54) and gene conversion (Hpr5 and Rdh54).
Therefore, E. cuniculi appears to have drastically reduced
both mechanisms for double strand break repair.
Although E. cuniculi's genome contains very few duplicate
genes (regions of homologous sequence) to use as templates for DNA synthesis in HRR, both S. cerevisiae [42]
and mammals [43] prefer to use sister chromatids rather
than homologous sequences (on the same or different
chromosomes) for this process. As E. cuniculi is likely diploid [44] (as are yeast and mammals), it is reasonable to
assume that this preference would exist in this organism
as well.
Given that such a large number of genes involved in both
double strand break repair pathways are absent, it is curious that some of these genes have been retained. When
one looks closely at the functions of these genes, it is evident that they all play roles in other critical biological
processes. Mre11 and Rad50, both members of the MRX
complex (found in both double strand break repair pathways), are also involved in telomere maintenance and the
generation of meiotic double strand breaks [45,46].
Rad27 is a nuclease that is implicated in the processing of
Okazaki fragments during replication [47].
All of the proteins belonging to the HRR pathway that are
present in E. cuniculi are also involved in meiosis [45].
Although sexual reproduction has not been observed in E.
cuniculi, it does contain three of the seven core meiosisspecific genes (Hop2, Mnd1 and Spo11), as discussed in
Ramesh et al. [48], and there is evidence that it may possess a mating type locus [49]. Sexual reproduction has also
been observed in numerous other microsporidia [5],
therefore there is little reason to suspect that E. cuniculi is
an exception. As a large number of proteins involved in
the HRR pathway are absent in E. cuniculi, the repair functions of the remaining proteins are unknown. It is possible that they have been retained because of their role in
meiosis.
Potential consequences for E. cuniculi
Reductions within the DNA repair pathways have led to
two fundamentally different outcomes: reduced complexity by loss of a few proteins (NER, MMR, BER) and drastic
losses of half or more proteins involved in a pathway
(methyltransferase repair, HRR and NHEJ). Although an
organism may be able to tolerate a somewhat sloppy
repair system, it is difficult to imagine how the organism
could exist without any means to mend double-strand
DNA breaks, especially given their frequency during meiosis and mitosis. E. cuniculi must, therefore, utilize some

Page 11 of 14

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:24

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/24

other form of double strand break repair, or contain such
highly divergent copies of most NHEJ and HRR proteins
that they were impossible to identify in this study.

the nucleus in order for them to function. For the
moment, double strand break repair in E. cuniculi will
remain a mystery.

Along with many of the proteins that carry out the work
of repair, E. cuniculi has lost several proteins that participate in cell signaling and cycle control. The 9-1-1 signaling complex is absent, which has been proposed to play a
role in the signaling cascade leading to cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis [50]. Both the Ku and MRX complexes are also
involved in cell cycle control, although their roles are not
well defined [51]. Loss of coordination of cellular activities could result from the absence of these proteins.

Conclusion

In addition to their role in repair, the Ku proteins protect
telomeres from degradation and help to control telomerase activity [52]. As E. cuniculi houses eleven chromosomes that contain telomeres [44], and encodes the
catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme [6], this organism must have developed an alternate method to maintain its telomeres, or it would suffer extreme telomere
attrition.

Our survey of E. cuniculi's DNA repair genes indicates that
the process of genome reduction has affected all major
DNA repair pathways. All of the single strand repair pathways (BER, NER and MMR) have lost at least one component, indicating that these pathways are less complex than
in S. cerevisiae, and could be less efficient. All replicative
DNA polymerases are present in E. cuniculi, although the
specialized repair polymerases are absent. The absence of
these enzymes could lead to inefficient DNA damage
repair and creation of double stranded DNA breaks that
are not easily repaired. Surprisingly, more than half of the
proteins participating in both double strand break repair
pathways (HRR and NHEJ) and the sole component
involved in methyltransferase repair are absent in E.
cuniculi. The proteins that remain are all involved in additional cellular functions (such as meiosis).

Methods
Like the Ku proteins, the DNA ligase Cdc9 performs several functions as well. It plays a role in recombination and
in the ligation of Okazaki fragments during replication
[53], therefore, it is possible that these processes are somewhat impaired.
The reduction that is observed within the DNA repair
pathways is similar to that observed throughout E.
cuniculi's genome, as this organism lacks many proteins
that participate in diverse biosynthetic pathways. In this
way, the genome of E. cuniculi is very similar to those of
many endosymbiotic and parasitic bacteria. Buchnera
aphidicola has also lost many DNA repair genes during the
process of genome reduction; indeed it has been proposed
that it was this lack of DNA repair genes that allowed
Buchnera's genome to become so small in the first place
[54].
We cannot rule out the possibility that our bioinformatics
tools were unsuccessful in locating highly divergent proteins that act in the DNA repair processes. It is also possible that in some cases, other non-homologous proteins
carry out essential functions to replace absent proteins (ie.
Tfb1 in NER). Such proteins may still be identified, as
roughly half of E. cuniculi's genome consists of hypothetical proteins [6]. Another potential explanation for this
lack of biosynthetic machinery is that E. cuniculi is able to
import many of the products of these pathways from the
host's cytoplasm (ie., ATP) [5]. However, it seems unlikely
that this would be the case for DNA repair proteins, as
protein uptake has not been documented in microsporidia, and these proteins would have to be targeted to

Identification of DNA repair pathway components in S.
cerevisiae and data mining in E. cuniculi
Components of the six major DNA repair pathways were
gathered from recent literature and supplemented with
data from the Saccharomyces genome database [15]. Refer
to Table 1 for a list of genes involved in each pathway and
the DNA polymerase subunits and references.

Amino acid sequences of DNA repair proteins from S. cerevisiae (Table 1) were collected from NCBI GENBANK,
and compared to E. cuniculi's protein and nucleotide data
using BLASTP and TBLASTN [55]. In instances where a
Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue to an S. cerevisiae
protein existed that was more conserved among eukaryotes than the S. cerevisiae protein itself, the S. pombe
sequence was used in the BLAST searches. (These proteins
are indicated with asterixes in Table 1 and S. pombe protein ID numbers are given).
In most instances, BLASTP searches were sufficient to
identify putative E. cuniculi homologues. In cases where
no significant results (significance was defined arbitrarily
as an e-value of 10-5 or less) were produced from the initial BLASTP analysis, the PSI-BLAST algorithm was used.
Homologues of the S. cerevisiae protein were identified in
all available eukaryotic protein data to construct a position-specific scoring matrix [55]. Up to six iterations were
run in cases where no significant E. cuniculi alignment was
found. In order to rule out similarity by chance, the identities of putative homologues detected in E. cuniculi were
confirmed by comparing them to GENBANK's S. cerevisiae
protein database using BLASTP. Homology was inferred

when this search recovered the S. cerevisiae protein that
was used for the initial E. cuniculi search as the top hit.
In many instances, BLAST searches in E. cuniculi confirmed annotations of DNA repair genes and polymerases
by Katinka et al. [6].

A brief examination of the number of interaction partners
of each protein in S. cerevisiae was conducted using data
from the online Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP)
[56]. Proteins that are absent in E. cuniculi do not have a
significantly different number of interaction partners
from proteins that are present. (Data not shown.)
