Abstract
Background: Spinal disorders are a major cause of disability for humans and an important health problem for
intensively farmed animals. Experiments have shown that vertebral deformities present a complex but comparable
etiology across species. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in bone deformities are still far from
understood. To further explicate the mechanisms involved, we have examined the fundamental aspects of bone
metabolism and pathogenesis of vertebral fusions in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).
Results: Experimentally, juvenile salmon were subjected to hyperthermic conditions where more than 28% developed
fused vertebral bodies. To characterize the fusion process we analyzed an intermediate and a terminal stage of the
pathology by using x-ray, histology, immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. At
early stage in the fusion process, disorganized and proliferating osteoblasts were prominent at the growth zones of the
vertebral body endplates. PCNA positive cells further extended along the rims of fusing vertebral bodies. During the
developing pathology, the marked border between the osteoblast growth zones and the chondrocytic areas
connected to the arches became less distinct, as proliferating cells and chondrocytes blended through an intermediate
zone. This cell proliferation appeared to be closely linked to fusion of opposing arch centra. During the fusion process a
metaplastic shift appeared in the arch centra where cells in the intermediate zone between osteoblasts and
chondrocytes co-expressed mixed signals of chondrogenic and osteogenic markers. A similar shift also occurred in the
notochord where proliferating chordoblasts changed transcription profile from chondrogenic to also include
osteogenic marker genes. In progressed fusions, arch centra and intervertebral space mineralized.
Conclusion: Loss of cell integrity through cell proliferation and metaplastic shifts seem to be key events in the fusion
process. The fusion process involves molecular regulation and cellular changes similar to those found in mammalian
deformities, indicating that salmon is suitable for studying general bone development and to be a comparative model
for spinal deformities.
Background
The vertebral column is the defining character of vertebrates providing the organism with a unique ability of
movement, form and function. Obviously, abnormalities
to this organ can lead to severe and often painful pathological conditions. Spinal disorders are a major cause of
disability for humans and an important health problem
for intensively farmed animals. A number of animal models have been used to further explore the pathology and
revealed that vertebral deformities present a complex but
comparable cross species etiology [1,2]. Morphological
changes like altered bone formation and cell density, thin* Correspondence: harald.takle@nofima.no

ning of osteoblasts along with increased cell proliferation
and cell death are changes found in spinal deformities
and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) in mammals
[3,4]. Discs from patients with spinal deformities further
have ectopic calcification of the vertebral endplates and
sometimes in the disc itself [5]. Cells of the mammalian
disc are derived directly from the phylogenetically conserved notochord [6]. Whereas only remnants of the
notochord exists in the nucleus pulposus (NP) in humans
by the age of 4, the notochord persist throughout all life
stages in teleosts. Spinal disorders in teleosts like sea
bass, sea bream, rainbow trout, halibut and salmon [7-12]
have mostly been descriptive and few molecular studies
have been carried out. However, in Atlantic salmon

and gene transcriptional changes using quantitative PCR
(qPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). We found that
loss of cell integrity and ectopic bone formation characterizes the development of spinal fusions. During the
fusion process a metaplastic shift appeared in the arch
centra where cells in the intermediate zone between
osteoblasts and chondrocytes co-expressed mixed signals
of chondrogenic and osteogenic markers. A similar shift
also occurred in the notochord where proliferating chordoblasts changed transcription profile from chondrogenic to also include osteogenic marker genes. We
suggest that hyperthermic induced development of spinal
fusions involve a metaplastic shift in cells from the chondrocytic lineage. With this work, we bring forward
salmon to be an interesting organism to study development of spinal fusions.

Results
The elevated temperature regime used in this study
induced mainly vertebral deformities of the fusion type.
The incidence of complete fusions was 10.0 (not significant = n.s.), 17.9 (p ≤ 0.001) and 28.1% (p ≤ 0.0001) at 2,
15 and 60 g, respectively (Figure 1). The incidence in the
two later samplings are underestimated, since these numbers do not take into consideration that fish sampled at 2
and 15 g could develop into fusions at the following samplings. Some fish displayed more than one type of pathology, but pathological changes other than fusions were low

bral fusion (ankylosis) accounts for 9 out of 20 recently
described vertebral deformities [13]. Spinal fusions
involves transformation of intervertebral notochord tissue into cartilage, shape alterations of vertebral body endplates, mineralization of the intervertebral cartilage and
replacement of intervertebral cartilage by bone [14],
pathological processes resembling those of IDD in mammals.
Skeletogenesis in salmon involves activity from the
three main bone and cartilage cell types; chondrocytes,
osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Bone formation further
occurs via two basic mechanisms; compact bone of the
amphicoel and trabeculae is formed directly through
intramembranous ossification, whereas the cartilaginous
template is replaced by bone in the arch centra through
endochondral ossification. Bone formation is brought
about by a complex set of highly regulated molecular
pathways, involving extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents (e.g. collagens and osteocalcin), signaling molecules
(e.g. hedgehogs and bmps) and transcription factors
(reviewed [15-17]). Some of the key transcription factors
in bone metabolism include runx2 and osterix [18],
involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells
(MSC) into osteoblasts that express bone matrix (col1a)
and matrix mineralizing (osteocalcin and osteonectin)
genes. Early chondrocyte differentiation is controlled by
sox9, which regulates transcription of col2a [19], the
major ECM component of cartilage. Further, before
endochondral ossification may occur, mef2c assures that
chondrocytes mature into col10a producing hypertrophic
cells [20]. Both mineralized bone and cartilage is remodeled through the activity of osteoclasts. These multinucleated cells provide and acidic environment, express
cathepsins and matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and
are tartrate acid phosphatase resistant (TRAP). Hence
mineralized matrix may be broken down [21,22]. The
skeletal pathways described in mammals are currently
being understood in teleosts. In a recent study, we investigated 20 genes for their role in salmon spinal column
skeletogenesis [23]. However, the genetic interactions of
bone and cartilage development are currently becoming
more entangled, as chondrocytes and osteoblasts are
shown to intersect through the formation of chondroid
bone. This process has been described through normal
maturation, differentiation plasticity and trans-chondroid
ossification [24-26]. Though, the molecular pathways
involved are still far from understood.
During the last decade problems with spinal disorders
in salmon have been increasingly in focus due to the
importance of this species in the aquaculture industry. To
further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of vertebral deformities, we analyzed an intermediate and terminal stage of the fusion process at a
morphological level by using radiography and histology

is a dynamic process as visualized by x-ray in Figure 2.
Histology and immunohistochemistry

Histological examination revealed more detailed morphological characteristics of intermediate and fused vertebral bodies (Figure 3A, B). The osteoblasts at the
growth zones of the vertebral endplate appeared wellorganized in non-deformed vertebrae and little aberrancy
was found when staining with toluidine blue (Figure 3C).

brae displayed alterations in vertebral endplates and more
disorganized osteoblasts (Figure 3D). These findings
became more pronounced at fused stage. The osteogenic
zone of the vertebral endplate extended abaxial inbetween two vertebral body endplates (Figure 3E). In
addition, arch centra had decreased in fused vertebral
bodies and chordocytes appeared denser compared to
non-deformed (Figure 3B). Alizarin red S visualized more
calcified tissue in areas with reduced arch centra in intermediate and fused vertebrae (Figure 3F-H). In fusions,
normal vertebral hour-glass shape was replaced by a
more compact and squared shape morphology, as the
arch centra were more or less replaced by bone (Figure
3H). Alizarin red S stained calcified tissue and showed
calcification of the centra and around hypertrophic chondrocytes (Figure 3I). No calcification was detected in the
intervertebral space of incomplete fusions (Figure 3I). In
fusions, growth zones of opposing vertebral bodies had
fused and intervertebral space mineralized (Figure 3K).
A balance between bone resorption and bone formation is required for maintaining bone integrity during
remodeling. Thus, we examined osteoclast activity using
TRAP staining. Weak positive TRAP staining was
detected at the ossifying border of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the arch centra in one sample from the intermediate group (Figure 4A, B). No positive staining was
found in samples from the fused group (Figure 4C).
To analyze if the morphological changes observed during development of fusions could be linked to an imbalanced cell cycling, we used immunohistochemistry with
antibodies specific to PCNA for detection of proliferation
and caspase 3 for detection of apoptosis. A few PCNA
positive cells were apparent at the osteoblast growth zone
at the endplates in non-deformed vertebral bodies (Figure
4D). PCNA positive cells were almost entirely restricted
to these areas and were rarely found in chordoblasts or
chordocytes (Figure 4E). However, we detected a markedly increase in PCNA positive cells at the growth zone of
the endplates, and in cells extending axial at intermediate
and fused stages (Figure 4F and 4G). Further, high abundance of proliferating chordoblasts were found in the
notochord of vertebrae with reduced intervertebral space
(Figure 4H and 4I). A few positive caspase 3 signals were
detected at the rims of the osteoblast growth zone of the
endplates in non-deformed vertebral bodies (Figure 4J).
Increased caspase 3 signals were found in these areas of
intermediate and fused vertebral bodies. Caspase 3 positive cells were also prominent at the transition between
the intervertebral and vertebral regions (Figure 4K and
4L). The positive signal was further spreading along the
rims of the vertebral bodies in axial direction (Figure 4M)
and in cells harboring the joints of the trabeculae (Figure
4N). Caspase 3 was not detected in the notochord in any
of the groups. The cells that stained positive had charac-

Spatial and temporal gene transcription in developing
fusions

To examine transcriptional regulations involved in development of fusions, we analyzed non-deformed, intermediate and fused vertebrae with real-time qPCR, while the

spatial gene transcription in intermediate and fused vertebrae were characterized by ISH. ISH of non-deformed
vertebral bodies have previously been described in Ytteborg et al. [23]. No staining was detected for ISH with
sense probes (additional file 1). Quantification of mRNA
revealed that most genes were transcriptionally downregulated during the pathogenesis of vertebral fusions
and that the suppression was more profound at the inter-

mediate stage than in fused specimens (Figure 5). We
divided the 19 analyzed genes into two groups; structural
genes and regulatory genes (transcription factors and signaling molecules).
Structural genes

Nine out of 11 structural genes had a down-regulated
transcription in the intermediate group compared to only
five in the fused group (Figure 5A). Four genes were
down-regulated in both groups, including genes involved
in bone (col1a1) and hypertrophic cartilage ECM production (col10a1) and mineralization (osteocalcin and alp).
Col2a1 transcription was down-regulated in intermediate
while up-regulated in the fused group (n.s.). Osteonectin
was up-regulated in both groups. Of genes involved in
osteoclast activity, mmp9 showed opposite transcription,
being down-regulated in intermediate while up-regulated
in fused. Mmp13 and cathepsin K showed similar transcription pattern in the two groups, mmp13 up-regulated
and cathepsin K down-regulated (n.s. in fused).

ISH analyzes of col1a, col2a, col10a, osteonectin and
osteocalcin revealed cells exhibiting characteristics of
both osteoblasts and chondrocytes. These findings were
more pronounced in fused than intermediate specimens.
Col1a was expressed in osteogenic cells along the rims of
the vertebral body endplates and in osteoblasts at the lateral surfaces of trabeculae at the intermediate stage (Figure 6A). In incomplete fusions, we could locate
osteogenic col1a positive cells in the growth zone of the
vertebral endplate extending abaxial in-between vertebral
bodies (Figure 6B, C). In addition, col1a was expressed in
high abundance in the intervertebral space of incomplete
fusions (Figure 6D). The chondrocytic marker col2a was
observed in chordoblasts in intermediate samples (Figure
6E). Furthermore, col2a was expressed at the growth zone
of the vertebral body endplates in both intermediate and
fused samples (Figure 6F, G). Positive staining of col2a in
the notochord became stronger as intervertebral space
narrowed down (Figure 6F, G). Transcription of col10a
was observed in hypertrophic chondrocytes and in osteogenic cells lining apical surfaces of trabeculae in intermediate and fused vertebrae (Figure 6H, I). Col10a seemed
to be less expressed in both intermediate and fused vertebrae, as also observed from the down-regulated transcription of this gene from the qPCR results. Osteonectin
showed a similar transcription pattern as col10, but transcription seemed increased in the trabeculae (Figure 6J).
Transcription of osteonectin was also associated with
chondrocytes in regions where arch centra fused (Figure
6K, L). Strong osteonectin transcription correlated with
an up-regulated mRNA transcription observed from
qPCR. Osteocalcin was transcribed in osteogenic cells
lining surfaces of trabeculae of fused vertebrae (Figure
6M) and in cells located abaxial in-between two opposing
vertebral body endplates (Figure 6N). When the vertebral
growth zones blended with the arch centra, chondrocytes
expressing osteocalcin was observed (Figure 6O).

However, the chondrogenic marker sox9 was up-regulated in both groups. The osteogenic markers runx2 and

runx2 in intermediate group. Osterix was down-regulated in intermediate group, however n.s. Except of bmp2
in fused vertebral bodies, signaling molecules (shh, ihh,

When analyzing selected genes by ISH, runx2 was
never detected in chordocytes, chordoblasts or chondrocytes in non-deformed vertebral bodies. Positive runx2
staining was however detected at the osteoblast growth
zone of the vertebral endplate (Figure 7A). In intermediate and fused samples we detected transcription at the
corresponding growth zone and along the lateral surfaces
of the trabeculae (Figure 7B). We observed an increased
transcription of runx2 in the chordocytes of incomplete

fusions (Figure 7C) and in the chordoblasts and chordocytes in more severe fusions (Figure 7D). These findings
corresponded to the up-regulated transcription found by
qPCR. Sox9 was expressed in chondrocytes in nondeformed vertebral bodies (Figure 7E) and in chordoblasts. In intermediate and fused samples, strong signals
of sox9 were detected in intervertebral space (Figure 7F).
Sox9 was also transcribed at the vertebral growth zones
of the endplates (Figure 7G) and the signal was extending

in a wide zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes in nondeformed vertebral bodies (Figure 7I). Hypertrophic
chondrocytes also transcribed mef2c in intermediate and
fused vertebral bodies (Figure 7J). Further, mef2c was
observed at the boundaries between two fused arch centra (Figure 7J). In fusions were arch centra narrowed
down, mef2c transcription did not seem restricted to
hypertrophic zones (Figure 7K). Some mef2c expressing
cells was also detected at the vertebral endplates (Figure
7L) and abaxial between vertebral growth zones of
opposing vertebral bodies in incomplete fusions (Figure
7M).

Discussion
In this study we present a molecular characterization of
mechanisms involved in development of vertebral fusions

in salmon. We have previously shown that the nondeformed fish used in this study had indications of soft
bone phenotype [23]. They were further characterized by
disrupted chondrocytic maturation, increased zones of
hypertrophic chondrocytes and delayed endochondral
ossification in the arch centra [23]. The number of deformities increased throughout the experiment and an
imbalanced bone and cartilage production characterized
susceptible fish, predisposed for developing deformities
[23]. In this study we wanted to analyze an intermediate
and a terminal stage of the fusion process to further characterize developing deformities. Through this experiment, we found that vertebral deformities were
developing through a series of events, of which five hallmarks were identified as particularly interesting. First,
disorganized and proliferating osteoblasts were prominent in the growth zones of the vertebral body endplates.

Second, a metaplastic shift made the borders less distinct
between the osteoblastic growth zone and the chondrocytic areas in the arch centra. Third, the arch centra ossified and the endplates became straight, hence giving the
vertebral bodies a squared shaped morphology. Fourth,
the intervertebral space narrowed down and the notochord was replaced by bone forming cells. Fifth, in a complete fusion all intervertebral tissue was remodeled into
bone.
One of the major morphological changes during the
fusion process was ossification of the arch centra. Our
findings suggest that this ectopic bone formation is a key
event in development of vertebral fusions, which involve
lack of normal cell differentiation and growth. Immunohistochemistry with PCNA showed that osteoblasts at
the growth zone of the vertebral body endplates had a
markedly increased cell proliferation during the fusion
process. The increased proliferation of osteoblasts was
apparently partly counteracted by increased cell death as
shown by stronger caspase 3 signaling. Nevertheless, the
osteoblasts at the vertebral endplates appeared less organized in intermediate and fused vertebral bodies by toluidine blue staining. In addition, in fused vertebral bodies
we observed moderate changes of abaxial translocation of
cells from the osteoblast growth zone. Abaxial direction
of growth from the borders of vertebral body end-plates
and formation of chondroid bone in these areas are also
described in previous experiments [14,27]. The findings
of increased proliferation and disorganized osteoblast
growth were evident in vertebrae with modest alterations, which may suggest that this is an early event in the
fusion process.
During the developing pathology, the marked border
between the osteoblast growth zones and the chondrocytic areas connected to the arches became less distinct,
as proliferating cells and chondrocytes blended through
an intermediate zone. PCNA positive cells further
extended along the rims of fusing vertebral bodies. This
cell proliferation appeared to be closely linked to fusion
of opposing arch centra. During the fusion process a
metaplastic shift appeared in the arch centra where cells
in the intermediate zone between osteoblasts and chondrocytes co-transcribed col1a, col2a, runx2, osteocalcin
and osteonectin, as visualized by ISH. Based on histology,
Witten et al. [25] have previously suggested the involvement of a metaplastic shift in developing fusions. In more
progressed fusions, most cells in the arch centra seemed
to co-transcribe osteogenic and chondrogenic markers.
Our suggestion is therefore that trans-differentiated cells
produce the ectopic bone.
Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that chondrocytes associated with calcifying cartilage can acquire
properties of osteoblasts [28] and are able to change their
phenotype from a primarily cartilage synthesizing cell

Page 9 of 15

type to a bone synthesizing cell type [29]. However,
hypertrophic chondrocytes able to trans-differentiate
into osteoblasts through a process called trans-chondroid
ossification has also been described [24]. Interestingly,
this type of growth has been identified during distraction
osteogenesis in rats [24,30], a process where bone is
formed rapidly upon stretching. During trans-chondroid
ossification, chondrocytes are found to express both col1
and col2 [24]. In a review by Amir et al. [31] it was speculated if tension stress during distraction inhibited final
differentiation of chondrocytes and rather trans-differentiated these cells into osteoblastic cells. At fused stage,
early markers for osteoblasts and chondrocytes (runx2,
osterix, sox9 and bmp2) were upregulated whereas the
osteoblast inhibitor (twist) and genes involved in chondrocyte hypertrophy (bmp4, mef2c, col10a, shh and ihh)
were downregulated, results also supported by ISH. Deletion of Ihh has been shown to disrupt the normal pattern
of various zones of chondrocyte differentiation in the
growth plate [32], whereas Sox9 accelerate chondrocyte
differentiation in proliferating chondrocytes but inhibit
hypertrophy [33]. Sustained runx2 expression, as found
in our studies, is further associated with trans-differentiation of chondrocytes into bone cells [34]. On the contrary, analyzing the ECM components of both osteoblasts
and chondrocytes (col1a, col2a, col10a, osteocalcin and
alp) revealed that these transcripts had reduced activity
in both intermediate and fused vertebrae. These findings
might reflect the reduced radiodensity described in fish
reared at elevated temperatures [23].
To further characterize the pathological bone formation in the chondrocytic areas in the arch centra, we analyzed osteoclast activity. Absence of osteoclasts
visualized through TRAP staining was characteristic during the development of vertebral fusions, indicating that
normal endochondral ossification was restrained. In
addition, cathepsin k had a down-regulated transcription
level. In normal developing salmon vertebrae, these areas
are modeled through endochondral bone formation, a
process requiring invasion of osteoclasts and activity of
TRAP, Mmps and Cathepsin K [21,35]. Transcription of
mmps are up-regulated during IDD [36] and compression-induced IVD [37,38] in mammals. Intriguingly,
mmp9 and mmp13 were also up-regulated during fusion
of vertebral bodies in salmon. Excessive co-activity of
mmp9 and mmp13 is linked to development and healing
of chronic wounds in rainbow trout [39] and salmon [40].
Lack of osteoclast activity and reduced activity of genes
involved in chondrocyte hypertrophy during development of vertebral fusions may therefore suggest that
mmp's were up-regulated in fused vertebral bodies as a
response to chronic injury rather than bone resorption.
Our results suggest that the ossification type during
development of spinal fusions and fast growth could be

Ytteborg et al. BMC Physiology 2010, 10:13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/10/13

trans-chondroid ossification. A mixed type of intramembraneous and endochondral ossification, as suggested by
Yasui et al. [24] and demonstrated by Okafuji et al. [30]
may also occur, however the lack of osteoclast activity
makes this less likely. Our findings indicate that chondrocytes had not only differentiated towards osteoblast-like
cells, but also completed the differentiation to cells that
were capable of producing mineralized bone matrix.
Whether the suggested trans-chondroid ossification is
trans-differentiation as a sudden switch from the chondrogenic to the osteogenic phenotype or a continuous
differentiation was not assessed in this experiment. However, based on our results, a pathway to bone formation
through chondrocytes might be possible during development of vertebral fusions.
The completing step in the fusion process is transformation of notochordal tissue into bone [14]. As intervertebral space narrowed down, proliferating chordoblasts
and denser packet chordocytes were revealed through
toluidine blue staining and PCNA antibody binding,
respectively. The structured chordoblast layer increased
and more of these cells stained for col2a. As the pathology progressed, proliferating chordoblasts seemed to
occupy most of the intervertebral space and vacuolated
chordocytes disappeared. Moreover, cells in the notochord had a transcription profile resembling the transdifferentiating cell at the borders between the osteoblast
growth zones and the chondrocytic areas connected to
the arches. Transcription of marker genes changed from
chondrogenic to also include osteogenic, as mRNA of
osteocalcin, runx2, osteonectin and col1a were detected.
QPCR further showed up-regulated transcription of both
runx2 and sox9 throughout the developing deformity.
Comparative to our findings, disc cell proliferation and a
switch in the synthesis of ECM components are associated with disc degeneration [41,42]. However, ISH
revealed that whereas sox9 and col2a was present in chordoblasts from the non-deformed stage, runx2 and col1a
was only detected in fused samples, when intervertebral
space was severely narrowed. This co-transcription of
chondrocytic and osteogenic markers in the notochord
supports the hypothesis of a metaplastic shift during vertebral fusions in salmon [25].
The metaplastic shift in the notochord and arch centra
may be induced to produce more robust cells, able to
withstand increased mechanical load. However, as bone
replaced chondrocytic areas throughout the pathology,
notochordal tissue did not calcify until the deformity
developed into severe fusion. We therefore suggest that
metaplasia leads to cell types more suited to the new
environment but that changes are related to a threshold
of the stimuli, in this case, grade of fusion. A shift in NP
cell population coincides with spinal disorders like IDD
and changes in the synthesis of matrix molecules differ

Page 10 of 15

with the degree of degeneration [43]. A comparative
pathological process to our findings is mammalian "Bamboo spine", describing a condition where vertebral bodies
have fused and reshaped through ectopic bone formation
[44,45]. Similar rescue processes have also been found in
the mammalian AF, where it is strengthened through cartilage formation upon elevated mechanical load [46,47].
Overall, the vertebral fusion process seen in salmon
might reflect an effort to restore and strengthen a vertebral area of a weakened vertebral column.

Conclusion
Vertebral fusions develop through a series of events. Disorganized and proliferating osteoblasts at the growth
zones and along the rims of affected vertebral bodies
characterized the fusion process. Moreover, loss of cell
integrity through cell proliferation was prominent at the
border between the osteoblastic growth zone and the
chondrocytic areas in the arch centra and in intervertebral space. During the fusion process a metaplastic shift
appeared in the arch centra where cells in the intermediate zone between osteoblasts and chondrocytes coexpressed mixed signals of chondrogenic and osteogenic
markers. A similar shift also occurred in the notochord
where proliferating chordoblasts changed transcription
profile from chondrogenic to also include osteogenic
marker genes. As the pathology progressed, ectopic bone
formation was detected in these areas. Since transcription turned from chondrogenic to osteogenic, our suggestion is that trans-differentiated cells produce the
ectopic bone. In complete fusions, all intervertebral tissue
was remodeled into bone. The molecular regulation and
cellular changes found in salmon vertebral fusions are
similar to those found in mammalian deformities, showing that salmon is suitable for studying general bone
development and to be a comparative model for spinal
deformities. With this work, we bring forward salmon to
be an interesting organism to study general pathology of
spinal deformities.
Methods
Rearing conditions

This trial was performed under the supervision and
approval of the veterinarian that has appointed responsibility to approve all fish experiments at the research station in accordance to regulations from the Norwegian
authorities regarding the use of animals for research purposes. The experiment was carried out at Nofima Marins
research station at Sunndalsøra, Norway, in 2007, as
described in Ytteborg et al. [23]. During egg rearing,
water supply was continuous from temperature controlled tanks stabilized at 10 ± 0.3°C. The temperature
was gradually increased at first feeding to 16 ± 0.3°C (1°C
per day). Temperatures exceeding 8°C during egg rearing

and 12°C after start feeding elevate the risk of developing
spinal fusions.

MO, USA) staining. Sections were stained for 5 min in
Alizarin red (pH 4.2) and for 2 min in 0.1% Toluidine blue
(pH 2.3), with a brief rinse in dH 2O in between. Single
staining with the two dyes was also performed. All sections were dehydrated in ethanol and mounted with
Cytoseal 60 (Electron Microscopy Science, PA, U.S.A)
prior to microscopy. To demonstrate osteoclast activity,
TRAP was visualized with the Acid phosphatase leukocyte kit No. 387 (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied according
to the manufacturer's protocol, with the exception of a 2
h incubation at 37°C. Subsequently, slides were rinsed in
dH2O and counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 s. Cell proliferation and apoptosis
were assessed by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cleaved Caspase 3, respectively [49-51]. Slides were placed in 0.1 M
citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 6) and heated in microwave, 5 min at 900 W and 4 min at 650 W. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked 10 min in 3% H2O2 in
methanol. The sections were washed 3× in PBS and incubated with a mouse anti PCNA monoclonal antibody
(clone PC10, Zymed Laboratories Inc., CA, USA) or
Cleaved Caspase 3 (Asp175 5A1, Cell Signaling Inc. Boston, MA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were washed 3× 5 min in PBS-Tween 20
before counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 2
min, washed in water, dehydrated in a graded series of
ethanol solutions, cleared with xylene, and mounted with
Cytoseal60 (Electron Microscopy Science). Controls were
incubated without substrate. Microscopic analyses were
performed by the stereomicroscope Zeiss Axio Observer
Z1 using brightfield illumination and digitized images
obtained with an AxioCam MRc5 camera using AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH, Göttingen, Germany).

Sample preparation

Primer design

Histological staining and ISH was carried out on five μm
Technovit 9100 ®New sections according to the protocol
[48]. Serial sections were prepared in the parasagittal orientation from vertebral columns, starting at the periphery and ending in the middle plane of the vertebrae using
a Microm HM 355S (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA,
USA). For immunohistochemistry, tissue was decalcified
for seven days in 10% EDTA, dehydrated in ethanol,
cleared and embedded in paraffin. Five μm serial sections
were prepared as described above, de-waxed with Clear
Rite (Richard-Allan, MI, USA), followed by two times
washing in xylene (Merck Chemicals Ltd.) for five min
each. Sections were then rehydrated before rinsed in
dH2O.

Primers (Table 1) for transcription analysis were based on
known salmon sequences or on conserved regions of
known teleost sequences paralogues. Primers were
designed using the Vector NTI Advance 10 (Invitrogen,
CA, USA) and NetPrimer (PREMIER Biosoft, CA, USA)
software. All PCR products were cloned using pGEM Teasy (Promega, WI, USA) and sequenced with Big Dye
Terminator chemistry and the ABI 3730 automated
sequencer, both delivered by (Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA). The obtained salmon clones were analyzed by
BLAST and deposited in the Genbank database.

Radiography and classification

Sampling was directed from radiographs so that the sampled area corresponded to the deformed or normal area.
Fish were sedated (Tricaine methane sulfonate, Pharmaq,
Norway) and radiographed during the experiment at 2 g,
15 g and 60 g. Fish that were not sampled were put back
into oxygenated water to ensure rapid wakening. The xray system used was an IMS Giotto mammography system (model number 6020/3, IMS Giotto, Bologna, Italy)
equipped with a FCR Profect image plate reader and FCR
Console (Fuji Medical Inc., Japan). At 15 g size, fish were
sampled for histological and gene transcriptional analysis. Samples for ISH and histology were fixed in 4% PFA
(n = 24) and samples for RNA isolation were snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C (n = 45).
All fish were divided into three categories where the
first group was non-deformed. These spinal columns had
no observable morphological changes in the vertebral
bodies or in intervertebral space. We further sampled
vertebral areas at two different stages in the pathological
development of fusions, termed intermediate and fused.
Vertebrae diagnosed as intermediate included various
degrees of reduced intervertebral space and compressions. Samples characterized as fused ranged from
incomplete fusions to complete fusions.
Statistical analyses

Histology and immunohistochemistry

Bone and cartilage formation in the spinal columns were
assayed by Alizarin Red S/Toluidine Blue (Sigma-Aldrich,

RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

Tissue homogenization from 15 replicates from each
group was achieved in a mortar with liquid nitrogen.
RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and Micro to
Midi Kit® (Invitrogen). Brief, tissue was homogenized in a
mortar with liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted

using Trizol reagent and Micro to Midi Kit® (Invitrogen)
before DNase treatment (DNase1, Invitrogen). The quality of the RNA was assessed spectrophotometrically
(NanoDrop Technologies, DE, USA) 1 μg RNA was
reverse transcribed to cDNA using oligo(dT) primer and
the Taqman Gold RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). The
cDNA synthesis was performed with 10 min primer incubation at 25°C, 1 h RT step at 48°C and 5 min RT inactivation at 95°C. All reactions were performed in accordance
to the manufacturer's protocol.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR

Real-time qPCR was conducted using the Light cycler
480 and SYBR Green chemistry (Roche, Switzerland) at
the following thermal cycling conditions: 95°C for 10 min,
followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60 ± 1°C for 15 s
and 72°C for 15 s. Further, specificity was assessed by the
melting curves, determined post PCR (95°C for 15 s, 60 ±
°C for 1 min and 97°C continuous). To determine the efficiency of target genes and reference gene (ef1a), we used
the standard curve method. Relative target gene mRNA
was normalized to relative ef1a mRNA levels for all sample, as recommended by Olsvik et al. [52]. The transcription ratios were analyzed using the Relative Expression
Software Tool (REST) and tested for significance by the
Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation Randomization Test© [53].
In situ hybridization

Digoxigenin labeled antisense and sense riboprobes were
synthesized according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Roche), using 250 ng of SP6 and T7 tailed PCR fragments as template. ISH was carried out on five μm

Tw9100 sections as described [48], and microscopic analyses of the NBT/BCIP stained sections were conducted
on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 equipped with an AxioCam
