Abstract
Background: Protein palmitoylation, an essential and reversible post-translational modification
(PTM), has been implicated in cellular dynamics and plasticity. Although numerous experimental
studies have been performed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying palmitoylation
processes, the intrinsic feature of substrate specificity has remained elusive. Thus, computational
approaches for palmitoylation prediction are much desirable for further experimental design.
Results: In this work, we present NBA-Palm, a novel computational method based on Naïve Bayes
algorithm for prediction of palmitoylation site. The training data is curated from scientific literature
(PubMed) and includes 245 palmitoylated sites from 105 distinct proteins after redundancy
elimination. The proper window length for a potential palmitoylated peptide is optimized as six. To
evaluate the prediction performance of NBA-Palm, 3-fold cross-validation, 8-fold cross-validation
and Jack-Knife validation have been carried out. Prediction accuracies reach 85.79% for 3-fold
cross-validation, 86.72% for 8-fold cross-validation and 86.74% for Jack-Knife validation. Two more
algorithms, RBF network and support vector machine (SVM), also have been employed and
compared with NBA-Palm.
Conclusion: Taken together, our analyses demonstrate that NBA-Palm is a useful computational
program that provides insights for further experimentation. The accuracy of NBA-Palm is
comparable with our previously described tool CSS-Palm. The NBA-Palm is freely accessible from:

Background
Protein palmitoylation is a reversible lipid modification
that plays important roles in cell signaling associated with
cellular dynamics and plasticity. However, very little is
known about the molecular mechanism underlying this
modification and regulation in cells. Palmitoylation, also

known as S-acylation, is one of the most ubiquitous posttranslational modifications (PTM), reversibly attaching a
16-carbon saturated fatty acid as lipid palmitate (C16:0)
to cysteine residues in protein substrates through thioester
linkage [1-6]. Biochemically, palmitoylation increases the
hydrophobicity of proteins to promote protein-mem-

brane association [1-6]. Also, palmitoylation modifies
numerous proteins to control protein-protein interaction
[7-9], intracellular trafficking [10,11], lipid raft targeting
[12,13], and proteins' activities [8,14], etc. Moreover,
palmitoylation has been implicated in a variety of biological and physiological processes, including signal transduction [14,15], mitosis [16], neuronal development
[3,6], and apoptosis [17], etc. Although protein palmitoylation has attracted extensive attention, its molecular
mechanisms still remain to be elusive.
Identification of palmitoylation sites is essential for a better understanding the molecular regulation of palmitoylation process. To date, only a few palmitoylation sites have
been experimentally identified. Although several efficient
techniques, such as mass spectrometry (MS), have been
employed recently, most of the known palmitoylation
sites are mapped by mutagenesis of candidate cysteine residues with conventional biochemical methods. The features of substrate specificity for palmitoylation is still
unclear and most previous studies have proposed that
there is no common and canonical consensus sequence/
motif for palmitoylation [1,3-5].
Moreover, only a few palmitoyltransferases have been
identified although palmitoylation of proteins has been
known for many years [2,4,18,19]. Palmitoylation of proteins can be carried out in both enzyme- and nonenzymedependent manners [5,18-20]. These intrinsic but diversified characteristics of palmitoylation introduce great difficulties into choosing appropriate candidate cysteine
residues in the substrates for further experimental manipulation. Thus, in silico prediction of palmitoylation sites
implemented in an apt algorithm/approach is in urgent
need and insightful for further experimental design.
Previously, we developed a computational program
named CSS-Palm, deployed with the approach of Clustering and Scoring strategy [21]. In that work, the data set for
training was curated from scientific literature (PubMed)
with 210 experimentally verified palmitoylated sites from
83 distinct proteins (referred to as old data set). Due to the
fast pace of research progress in this area, more palmitoylation sites have been identified since our last publication of CSS-Palm. After survey recent progress and
redundancy elimination, the final data set includes 245
non-homologous sites from 105 proteins (referred to as
new data set, see in Table 1). We then employ several
machine learning algorithms including Naïve Bayes [22],
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [23] and RBF Networks
[24] for palmitoylation site prediction. Also, the proper
window length for a potential palmitoylated peptide has
been optimized. The accuracy of prediction performance
fluctuates from 82% to 86%. By comparison, the Naïve
Bayes approach achieves the best accuracy of 85.79% for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/458

3-fold cross-validation, 86.72% for 8-fold cross-validation
and 86.74% for Jack-Knife validation, with the window
length of six. Thus, we construct a computational web
service of NBA-Palm – prediction of palmitoylation site
implemented in Naïve Bayes algorithm. And the prediction performance is comparable with our previous work
of CSS-Palm.

Results & discussions
Functional analysis of Palmitoylated Proteins
In order to elucidate the molecular determinants responsible for protein palmitoylation, we downloaded the GO
annotation files for Uniprot from EBI-GOA [25] for
processing. In our non-redundant data set with 105
palmitoylated proteins, we have observed 455 distinct GO
categories. Table 2 shows the top five Gene Ontology
(GO) entries of biological processes, molecular functions
and cellular components of palmitoylated proteins.

The most abundant GO item of biological process in
which palmitoylated proteins are implicated is "signal
transduction" (26 proteins). The other four biological
processes are "G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway" (21 proteins), "transport" (16 proteins),
"ion transport" (7 proteins) and "cell adhesion" (7 proteins). The most enriched GO group of molecular function is "protein binding" (41 proteins), while the other
four highly-abundant molecular functions are "receptor
activity" (27 proteins), "signal transducer activity" (25
proteins), "G-protein coupled receptor activity" (15 proteins) and "rhodopsin-like receptor activity" (14 proteins). Again, the most frequent GO entry of cellular
component is "membrane" (70 proteins), and the other
four highly-frequent cellular components are "integral to
membrane" (54 proteins), "plasma membrane" (245 proteins), "integral to plasma membrane" (19 proteins) and
"endoplasmic reticulum" (9 proteins).
Taken together, the computational analyses of the palmitoylated proteins support the notion that palmitoylated
proteins carry diversified cellular functions. The result
points to two conclusions. First, the data set is general
enough and suitable for our prediction work as training
data set. Second, computational tools which can accelerate palmitoylation function research are valuable and
helpful.

Performance of NBA-Palm
We carried out 3-fold cross-validation, 8-fold cross validation and the Jack-Knife validation to evaluate the performance of NBA-Palm (shown in Table 3 and Table 4). On the
old data set, NBA-Palm achieves best average MCC of
0.594 with window length of six. On the new data set, the
best average MCC is 0.548 with the same optimized window length of six. The prediction performances on the old
and new data set are very similar. However, the performance on the new data set is slightly lower than that on the
old data set. To find out the reason of this performance
decrease, we built sequence logos [26] on the old and new
data sets (shown in Figure 1a and Figure 1b). Both two
logos show that around palmitoylation sites there is a Leucine/Cysteine-rich region. Comparison of the two logos
leads to the observation that the pattern of the old data set
is slightly stronger than that of the new data set. This may
explain why performance of NBA-Palm on the new data
set is slightly lower.
Comparison of Prediction Performance with several
machine learning algorithms
Besides Naïve Bayes, we also adopt two additional
machine learning algorithms, RBF networks and support
vector machines (SVMs), to predict palmitoylation site.
Table 3 and Table 4 show the detailed performances of the
three algorithms on the old and new data sets, separately.
Several conclusions can be reached: firstly, despite of its
simple structure, Naïve Bayes is overall the best algorithm.
However, its performance is only slightly better than that
of the other two. Secondly, best window lengths for the

three algorithms are not identical, e.g. on new data set 6
for Naïve Bayes, 8 for RBF networks and 7 for SVMs,
according to average MCC of 3-fold cross-validation, 8fold cross-validation and Jack-Knife validation. Thirdly,
performances of Jack-Knife tests are often better than
those of 3-fold and 8-fold cross-validations because there
are more training data and less test data. Among the three
algorithms, SVM has the largest differences in MCC
between 3-fold cross-validation, 8-fold cross validation
and Jack-Knife test while Naïve Bayes has the smallest.
This implies that Naïve Bayes may be the most robust
algorithm when changing the numbers of training data
and test data. And the window length of Naïve Bayes algorithm is optimized as six by comparison of the average
MCC. Hence, Naïve Bayes is a very simple-structured algorithm with high performance and robustness, which is
extremely suitable for biological classification problems.
Comparison with previously described analysis CSS-Palm
Performance comparison was carried out between NBAPalm and the previously established method CSS-Palm
[21] on the same old data set. Details are shown in Table
5. In the Jack-Knife validation, NBA-Palm performs comparatively with CSS-Palm in all metrics. However, in 3fold cross-validation, NBA-Palm achieves much higher
MCCs, which is probably due to the volatility of the 3-fold
cross-validation, because the 3-fold cross-validation uses
less training data (2/3 of whole data set) and makes predictions on more testing data (1/3 of whole data set)
while Jack-Knife validation uses all data but one for training. The result implies that the robustness of the Naïve

The sequence logos of palmitoylation sites
The sequence logos of palmitoylation sites. Both two logos show that around palmitoylation sites there is a Leucine/Cysteinerich region. A taller letter indicates that this kind of residue is more frequently used. (a) on old data set; (b) on new data set.

Bayes method is probably inherited from the nature of
probability theory. This is consistent with the conclusion
above achieved in comparison of Naïve Bayes and SVM.
In contrast, CSS-Palm is based on sequence/peptide
homology scoring and clustering. And lacking a key
sequence/peptide in training data might cause large
changes in clustering results. Thus, CSS-Palm depends on
training data heavily with less robustness.
Perspective of Future work
Our work points to several paths for further research.
Firstly, as the proteomic techniques continue to be
improved, more and more palmitoylation sites will be
identified. We can expect that the accuracies will be further improved with more training data. Secondly, some
other machine learning methods could be applied, i.e.,
decision trees [24] and hidden Markov models [27]. These
approaches could be used separately or combined
together to build potentially better models. Thirdly, evolutionary information, for example, phylogenetic conservation between human and mouse, can also be integrated
into the prediction system to improve its accuracy.

Conclusion
In this work, we present a new method for protein palmitoylation site prediction based on Naïve Bayes. The performance is satisfactorily high. Comparison between
Naïve Bayes, RBF networks and SVMs was also carried out,
and demonstrated that Naïve Bayes outperforms the other
two methods. We also compared NBA-Palm with our previously established method CSS-Palm. The comparison
demonstrates that NBA-Palm carries superior computing
efficiency to CSS-Palm with equal predicting accuracy.
These results indicate that Naïve Bayes is an effective classification algorithm for biological problems. In addition,
with high specificity and sensitivity, NBA-Palm could be a
valuable computational tool for functional proteomic
biologists.

Methods
Data Preparation
Here we define the cysteine (C) residues that undergo
palmitoylated modification as positive data (+), while

imentally verified palmitoylation sites of 84 proteins [21].
Since palmitoylation-related research is updated rapidly,
more and more palmitoylated sites have been identified
and reported. We searched the PubMed with the keyword
"palmitoylation" to collect new palmitoylation sites. Now
the updated new data set contains 266 sites from 111 proteins (before March. 31st, 2006). We then retrieved the primary sequences of these proteins from Swiss-Prot/
TrEMBL database [28]. The final curated data set is available upon request.
The positive data (+) set for training might contain several
homologous sites from homologous proteins. If the training data are highly redundant with too many homologous
sites, the prediction accuracy will be overestimated. To
avoid the overestimation, we clustered the protein
sequences from positive data (+) set with a threshold of
30% identity by BLASTCLUST [29], one program of clustering highly homologous sequences into distinct groups.
If two proteins were similar with ≥30% identity, we realigned the proteins with BL2SEQ, a program in the
BLAST package [29], and checked the results manually. If
two palmitoylation sites from two homologous proteins
were at the same position after sequence alignment, only
one item was reserved while the other was discarded.
Thus, we obtained a non-redundant positive data (+) of
high quality with 245 palmitoylation sites from 105 proteins.
As previously described [30,31], the negative (-) sites were
composed of non-annotated cysteine residues in the same
proteins from which positive (+) sites were taken, instead
of using proteins randomly picked from the Swiss-Prot/
TrEMBL database. Thus, both (+) and (-) sites are
extracted from the same protein sequences, making our
test more strict. Obviously, the (-) sites may contain some
false negative hits – these cysteine residues in fact undergo
palmitoylation but are not characterized so far. In this
regard, the prediction performance of any computational
approaches will overestimate the false positive rates.
However, without a high-quality gold-standard (-) set,
this overestimation is inevitable.

For comparing the prediction performance from NBAPalm with our previous tool of CSS-Palm [21], both the
previously used old data set from CSS-Palm and the new
updated data set were used. The detailed information of
data description is listed in Table 1.
Algorithm design and validation
Sequence coding
We employed a traditional sliding window strategy to represent a potentially palmitoylated peptide (PPP). Given
the window length n, a fragment of 2n residues centering
on palmitoylated site was adopted to represent a PPP.
Since there is always C in middle of a PPP, we didn't
include the center site into the encoding fragment. We
chose an orthogonal binary coding scheme to transform
protein sequences into numeric vectors. For example, Glycine was designated as 00000000000000000001, Alanine
designated as 00000000000000000010, and so on. The
length of final feature vector representing the palmitoylated site is n × 2 ×20. Different values of n varying
from 3 to 8 were used to determine the optimized window
length.
The Machine Learning Algorithms
Naïve Bayes is a classification model based on so-called
Bayes theorem [22]. Naïve Bayes classifiers assume that
the effect of a variable value on a given class is independent of the values of other variables. This assumption is
called class conditional independence. It is made to simplify the computation and in this sense is considered to be
"Naïve". Given a potential palmitoylation site X,
described by its 0–1 feature vector (x1, x2,..., xn) described

in above section, we are looking for a class C that maximizes the likelihood: P(X|C)=P(x1, x2,..., xn|C) where C
can be "palmitoylation" or "non-palmitoylation". The
assumption of class conditional independence allows us
to decompose the likelihood to a product of simpler probn

abilities: P(X | C) = ∏ P( xi | C) . Despite of its simple
i =1

structure and ease of implementation, Naïve Bayes often

performs comparatively well with other algorithms, such
as SVMs and neural networks.
The support vector machine (SVM) is a new machine
learning method, which has been applied for many kinds
of pattern recognition problems. The principle of the SVM
method is to transform the samples into a high dimension
Hilbert space and seek a separating hyperplane in the
space. The separating hyperplane, called the optimal separating hyperplane, is chosen in such a way as to maximize its distance from the closest training samples. As a
supervised machine learning technology, SVM is well
founded theoretically on Statistical Learning Theory [23].
Recently, SVM has been successfully adopted to solve
many biological problems, such as predicting protein subcellular locations [32], protein secondary structures
[32,33], tumor classification [34] and phosphorylation
sites [30,31]. In present work, the feature vector of each
potential palmitoylation site was transformed into a
higher dimension space through polynomial kernel function.
The RBF network is a kind of multi-layer, feed-forward
artificial neural network [24]. An RBF network consists of
three layers, namely the input layer, the hidden layer, and
the output layer. The input layer broadcasts the coordinates of the input vector to each of the nodes in the hidden layer. Each node in the hidden layer then produces an
activation based on the associated radial basis function.
Finally, each node in the output layer computes a linear
combination of the activations of the hidden nodes. How
an RBF network reacts to a given input stimulus is completely determined by the activation functions associated
with the hidden nodes and the weights associated with
the links between the hidden layer and the output layer.
In our model, after feature vectors were fed into input layers, the links between nodes were iteratively updated until
convergence. The output layer finally produced the decision of "palmitoylation" or "non-palmitoylation".
The Jack-Knife validation and n-fold cross-validation
The prediction performances of NBA-Palm were evaluated
by the 3-fold cross-validation, 8-fold cross-validation and
the Jack-Knife validation, for the convenience of comparison with the previous method CSS-Palm. In the JackKnife validation, which is also named "leave-one-out"
cross-validation, each sample in the dataset is singled out
in turn as an independent test sample, and all the remaining samples are used as training data. This process is
repeated until every sample is used as test sample one
time. In n-fold cross validation all the (+) sites and (-) sites
were combined and then divided equally into n parts,
keeping the same distribution of (+) and (-) sites in each
part. Then n-1 parts were merged into a training data set
while the one part left out was taken as a test data set. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/458

average accuracy of n-fold cross validation was used to
estimate the performance. All models were implemented
in the WEKA software package[35].
Performance measurements
We adopted four frequently considered measurements:
accuracy(Ac), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and Mathew
correlation coefficient (MCC). Accuracy(Ac) illustrates the
correct ratio between both positive (+) and negative (-)
data sets, while sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) represent the correct prediction ratios of positive (+) and negative data (-) sets respectively. However, when the number
of positive data and negative data differ too much from
each other, the Mathew correlation coefficient (MCC)
should be included to evaluate the prediction performance. The value of MCC ranges from -1 to 1, and a larger
MCC value stands for better prediction performance.

Among the data with positive hits by NBA-Palm, the real
positives are defined as true positives (TP), while the others
are defined as false positives (FP). Among the data with
negative predictions by NBA-Palm, the real positives are
defined as false negatives (FN), while the others are defined
as true negatives (TN). The performance measurements of
sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Ac), and
Mathew correlation coefficient (MCC) are all defined as
below:

Sn =

TP
TN
, Sp =
,
TP + FN
TN + FP

Ac =

TP + TN
,
TP + FP + TN + FN

MCC =

(TP × TN) − (FN × FP)
.
(TP + FN) × (TN + FP) × (TP + FP) × (TN + FN)

ROC curves
The prediction performance of Naïve Bayesian algorithm
with window length of six is very similar to that of seven.
To compare their performance in detail, ROC curves were
used for intuitively visualizing prediction performance
(see in Figure 2). ROC curves plot the true positive rate as
a function of the false positive rate, which is equal to 1specificity. The area under the ROC curve (the ROC score)
is the average sensitivity over all possible specificity values, which can be used as a measure of prediction performance over different thresholds. ROC curves of
random predictors will be around the diagonal line from
bottom left to top right with scores of about 0.5, while a
perfect predictor will produce a curve along the left and
top boundary of the square and will receive a score of one.
