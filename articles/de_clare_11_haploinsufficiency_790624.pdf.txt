Haploinsufficiency and the sex chromosomes
from yeasts to humans
Michaela de Clare, Pınar Pir, Stephen G Oliver*

Abstract
Background: Haploinsufficient (HI) genes are those for which a reduction in copy number in a diploid from two
to one results in significantly reduced fitness. Haploinsufficiency is increasingly implicated in human disease, and so
predicting this phenotype could provide insights into the genetic mechanisms behind many human diseases,
including some cancers.
Results: In the present work we show that orthologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae HI genes are preferentially
retained across the kingdom Fungi, and that the HI genes of S. cerevisiae can be used to predict haploinsufficiency
in humans. Our HI gene predictions confirm known associations between haploinsufficiency and genetic disease,
and predict several further disorders in which the phenotype may be relevant. Haploinsufficiency is also clearly
relevant to the gene-dosage imbalances inherent in eukaryotic sex-determination systems. In S. cerevisiae, HI genes
are over-represented on chromosome III, the chromosome that determines yeast’s mating type. This may be a
device to select against the loss of one copy of chromosome III from a diploid. We found that orthologues of
S. cerevisiae HI genes are also over-represented on the mating-type chromosomes of other yeasts and filamentous
fungi. In animals with heterogametic sex determination, accumulation of HI genes on the sex chromosomes would
compromise fitness in both sexes, given X chromosome inactivation in females. We found that orthologues of
S. cerevisiae HI genes are significantly under-represented on the X chromosomes of mammals and of
Caenorhabditis elegans. There is no X inactivation in Drosophila melanogaster (increased expression of X in the male
is used instead) and, in this species, we found no depletion of orthologues to yeast HI genes on the sex
chromosomes.
Conclusion: A special relationship between HI genes and the sex/mating-type chromosome extends from
S. cerevisiae to Homo sapiens, with the microbe being a useful model for species throughout the evolutionary
range. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency in yeast can predict the phenotype in higher organisms.

Background
The relevance of haploinsufficiency (a deleterious phenotype upon the reduction of gene copy number from
two to one in a diploid cell) to human disease is being
increasingly appreciated. Haploinsufficiency for over 20
tumour-suppressor genes (including the PTEN, BRCA1
and 2, and p53 [1], and RUNX genes [2]) has been
demonstrated to contribute to tumourigenesis and
metastasis. It is also implicated in inherited conditions
such as Turner syndrome [3]; Stickler syndrome [4];

ribosome biogenesis disorders [5], and other developmental abnormalities [3].
Although several of these disease associations have
been recently confirmed with the construction of heterozygous deletion mouse mutants [6], performing
large-scale in vivo screens for haploinsufficient (HI)
genes in the higher eukaryotes is still hampered by the
inherent difficulties both in constructing deletion
mutants and quantifying the resulting phenotype. By
contrast, for the model unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there exists a library of diploid strains
each carrying a deletion of one copy of an individual
protein-coding gene in the genome [7], and growth can
be easily quantified either in batch or continuous culture. Since each strain within this heterozygous deletion

library is constructed incorporating a unique 20-mer
‘barcode’ [7], mutant strains representing the entire genome can be grown in a single competitive pool [8].
Using this approach, we previously defined sets of
haploinsufficient genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
under several different nutrient conditions by competition experiments [8]. More recently, we defined a set of
approximately 1,000 HI genes growing in rich medium
in a fed-on-demand turbidostat culture (P Pir, A Gutteridge, J Wu, B Rash, DB Kell, N Zhang, SG Oliver,
unpublished). In such cultures, a feedback loop, varying
the input rate of fresh growth medium, acts to maintain
a constant cell density. Thus, population growth can be
maintained at the highest possible rate [9,10]. These
conditions allow us to identify those genes which are
phenotype is independent of any specific nutrient limitation. It is this set of HI genes upon which we have concentrated in the present work.
The phenotypes of yeast strains carrying mutations for
conserved genes have been long established as being
highly predictive for human genetic disorders [11]; that
is, the function of a human protein, and its contribution
to a particular phenotype, can be inferred from that of
its yeast orthologue [12]. This ‘phenologue’ approach is
being increasingly justified as confirmation experiments
are performed in more complex higher organisms [13]
and conditions including ageing, cancer, neurodegenerative and prion disease, apoptosis, and DNA repair disorders are studied in yeast [12]. In addition, yeast screens
are widely used to identify gene targets for potential
therapeutic intervention [14].
We therefore sought to apply such an orthology-based
approach to relate haploinsufficiency in yeast and
humans, particularly with respect to known disease
genes, by examining the evolutionary significance of the
S. cerevisiae HI genes, their conservation across species,
and the degree to which yeast haploinsufficiency can
predict the phenotype in higher organisms.

Results
HI genes are preferentially retained across the eukaryotes

By examining orthology relationships, we found that
orthologues of S. cerevisiae HI genes are highly retained
among the yeast species; the probability of their having
an orthologue in another yeast species is significantly
higher than the average for the S. cerevisiae genome
(Fisher’s exact test; P = 10-3). We found that this is true
with respect to both those species which diverged prior
to, and those diverging after, the whole-genome duplication (WGD) that occurred approximately 100 million
years ago [15] in the Saccharomycetales lineage. Moreover, HI genes are also more likely to have subsequently
been retained in duplicate following the WGD (see
P values below), indicating that, at least through the

approximately 20 million year period of rapid postWGD gene shedding (between the divergence of the S.
cerevisiae and Kluveromyces polysporus lineages [16]),
selective pressure existed toward maintaining a higher
dosage of the proteins they encode.
Since ribosomal complexes are acutely sensitive to
protein dosage imbalance, and most genes encoding
ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are over-represented
among the gene pairs retained following the WGD [17],
we excluded r-protein genes from the analysis and still
found the S. cerevisiae genome to be enriched for pairs
containing at least one (P < 10-5), or two (P = 0.007) HI
members (see Additional file 1). A similar pattern is
observed in other post-WGD yeast species, with orthologues of HI genes being over-represented among surviving WGD paralogous pairs (P = 10-7, 0.05, 0.01 for
Saccharomyces bayanus, K. polysporus and Saccharomyces castellii, respectively). The K. polysporus result is
particularly significant, since post-WGD gene loss in
this species occurred essentially independently of
S. cerevisiae evolution [16]. All of this suggests that the
haploinsufficient phenotype predated the WGD.
The retention of orthologues of yeast HI genes
appears to have acted over a still greater evolutionary
timeframe: we found that yeast HI orthologues are
highly retained across the entire Ascomycete phylum,
an evolutionary span of at least 900 million years [18],
and that the orthologues of yeast HI genes are retained
significantly more frequently than the genomic average
in 75% of eukaryotic species with published sequenced
genomes (see P values in Tables 1 and 2). We considered the possibility that this over-representation is driven by a subset of the HI genes coding for proteins
involved in some important biological process that is,
itself, highly conserved among eukaryotes. In particular, the set of HI genes in S. cerevisiae is enriched for
genes encoding r-proteins. In order to rule out this
possibility, the HI genes were first classified into the
broad functional categories represented by the generic
S. cerevisiae GO_slim terms provided by the Gene
Ontology Consortium [19]. Genes within each of these
discrete sets were then sequentially removed and the
orthology analysis repeated. In each case, the statistical
significances of the orthology comparisons remained at
P < 0.05; for those species in which the full HI set is
more highly retained, the significant over-representation is preserved and, for those few species not exhibiting HI-orthologue over-representation, deletion of
functional categories does not give rise to significance.
This suggests that the over-representation of orthologues is indeed due to haploinsufficiency, rather than
any particular functional subset.
Similarly, we also sought to rule out the possibility that
conservation is driven by the homozygous deletant

phenotype, rather than the HI phenotype. Accordingly,
we first confirmed that, congruent with our previous
findings for chemostat culture [8], there exists no significant correlation between our turbidostat haploinsufficient set and essentiality/significant fitness defect in the
homozygous deletant (P value of an overlap between the
phenotypes = 0.7). Secondly, those HI genes for which
the null mutant is fitness compromised are no more
likely than the remainder of the HI gene set to be
retained across the species (the P value across the yeast
species for preferential retention = 0.3). Moreover, there
is no significant correlation between the null mutant fitness for a given HI gene, and the fraction of species in
which its orthologues are retained (correlation coefficient
= 0.06).

Haploinsufficiency in yeast is predictive

We also found that haploinsufficiency in yeast is a good
predictor for the phenotype of orthologues in higher
eukaryotes. Members of a set of 299 published human
haploinsufficient genes, assembled via text mining (following the method described by Dang et al. [20]), are significantly more likely than other human genes to have a
yeast orthologue that is HI (P < 10 -4 ). A total of 83 of
these human haploinsufficient genes have a BLAST besthit orthologue in S. cerevisiae (consistent with the
approximately 25% likelihood of a human gene being
associated with a yeast orthologue by this method), and
40 of these (unique) orthologues are also HI in yeast.
We therefore defined a set of candidate human HI
genes based upon the phenotype of their yeast orthologues (using unique yeast-human orthologue matches),
listed in Additional file 2, and examined their gene
ontology and disease associations. Of our 563 human
gene candidates, 104 are associated in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database [21] with a
genetic disease (see Additional file 3). A GO enrichment
search of the candidate HI/disease-associated set suggests an over-representation of gene functions essential
in tumourigenesis and metastasis. DNA damage
response and repair, apoptosis, and the oxidative stress
response, along with cell migration and cell-cell adhesion terms are all enriched with a P value of less than
0.0005 (corrected for multiple testing).
Our predicted HI/OMIM-associated set includes the
known HI tumour suppressor NF1, along with a cluster
of four genes, RPS19, RPL1, RPS7 and RPS24, associated
with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (the latter three of
which are novel HI predictions), and three connected
with Williams syndrome: RFC2, STX1A and PSPH (the
latter two being novel HI predictions). Since both of
these conditions have independently been associated
with haploinsufficiency [5,22], their presence among our
predicted set provides encouraging support for our
yeast-based method. Further clusters include four genes
related to colorectal cancer (a GO enrichment P value
of 0.0006). None of these four genes has previously been
annotated as HI according to our text-mining search. In
addition, we make novel HI predictions for several
genes associated with Xeroderma pigmentosum and, by
extension, defective nucleotide excision repair. Genes
involved in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways [23] of Huntingdon’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease are also
over-represented (P < 0.02 for all; see Additional file 3).

sex chromosomes since the dosage of the sex-linked
genes can vary by a factor of two between the sexes. We
previously noted [8] that chromosome III of S. cerevisiae, which carries the mating locus (MAT), is enriched
for genes that are HI under different nutrient-limited
conditions (P < 10-50). We argue that this accumulation
was selectively advantageous upon its occurrence in an
ancestral yeast, and has been subsequently retained
across the lineage.
As to the selective advantage, we have previously proposed that the accumulation of HI genes on this chromosome is a mechanism that leads to cells that have
lost one copy of chromosome III being eliminated from
the population. Generally, mating ability is repressed in
diploid cells due to the presence of both mating-type
alleles, but a diploid bearing only one copy of chromosome III can express the haploid mating programme,
becoming a so-called ‘diploid mater’. Such aneuploids
would be unable to sporulate and would give rise to (fitness-compromised) triploid progeny on mating with a

haploid partner (Figure 1a); thus, chromosome III
monosomy is a serious detriment to the population.
Here, we have found that the over-representation of HI
genes on S. cerevisiae chromosome III also holds when the
phenotype was defined in turbidostat culture (P = 10-5).
Thus the effect is not nutrient specific and holds true in
yeast growing in near-optimal conditions. To test the lossof-chromosome III hypothesis, we examined whether the
observed MAT linkage also holds in other fungi having
the same mating-type determination system. Indeed,
orthologues of HI genes from S. cerevisiae chromosome
III are found to be over-represented on the chromosomes
bearing the mating-type locus in species throughout the
Ascomycota (with P values ranging from 10-2 to < 10-19).
By constructing the relevant heterozygous deletion
mutants, we have confirmed, in a subset of these MATlinked HI orthologues, that the haploinsufficient phenotype does indeed carry over to two other yeast species.

Figure 1 Consequences of the accumulation of haploinsufficient genes on the mating-type chromosomes of fungi and the sex
chromosomes of animals. (a) In the diploid yeast cell, loss of one copy of the mating chromosome allows expression of the mating
pheromones (typically suppressed in the diploid), generating a mating-competent diploid. The accumulation of haploinsufficient (HI) genes on
this chromosome is proposed to be a selective mechanism against its loss, compromising fitness in the chromosome III monosome to such a
degree as to preclude diploid mating. (b) In animals, the presence of HI genes on the sex chromosomes should incur a selective penalty in the
heterogametic sex. In mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans, X chromosome inactivation in the female halves the expression of the genes along
the entire chromosome, resulting in selective pressure against X-linked HI genes in the homogametic sex as well. In contrast, in Drosphila
melanogaster males, the expression of the lone X chromosome is doubled, thus any HI genes present on the chromosome should present no
detriment to the fitness of either sex.

significantly slower than the wild type, corresponding to P
values of 7 × 10-3 and 4 × 10-6, respectively (see Table 3).
It should be noted the batch growth assays performed for
the non-cerevisiae yeasts are significantly less sensitive
than continuous culture competition experiments [8], and
hence small (but significant) differences in growth rate will
not be detected. That a growth defect (much less a significantly lower growth rate) is observed at all in batch culture
is indicative of a strongly haploinsufficient phenotype.
The antiquity of the relationship between HI genes and
the MAT chromosome is further suggested by the fact
that the association holds not only in diploid species, but
also in predominantly haploid yeasts such as K. lactis and
Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii (Table 4). Since the loss
of any chromosome from the haploid genome is lethal,
additional selective mechanisms against the loss of the
MAT chromosome should be unnecessary. Thus, HI
genes should not be significantly clustered near the MAT
locus in such species unless the arrangement is inherited
from a common ancestor of the diploid/haploid yeasts.
The only species not exhibiting linkage of HI genes to
MAT are the closely related pathogens Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis (see Table 4). These species possess only a parasexual cycle and are believed to
be incapable of undergoing meiosis [24], in contrast to
the other Ascomycetes studied (including Candida glabrata, for which a putative sexual cycle has been
observed; [25]).

Orthologues of yeast HI genes are explicitly excluded
from the sex chromosomes in higher eukaryotes

In the higher eukaryotes that have a heterogametic
sex-determination system, the situation is the reverse of
that in the Fungi. In the XY, X0, and ZW systems, all
chromosomes are maintained in duplicate in both sexes,
except for the sex chromosomes, for which there is only a
single copy in one of the sexes. The haploid status of the
sex chromosome means that the presence of HI genes on
these chromosomes would detrimental to the fitness of
the heterogametic sex. Indeed, we have found that the
orthologues of yeast HI genes are significantly underrepresented on the X chromosome of the human, mouse,
rat, chimp, dog, cow and horse (XY species) and the X
chromosome of the nematode worm (X0) (see Table 4). In
general, the Y chromosome is too small, and carries too
few yeast orthologues, to perform significance tests.
Genes on the X chromosome are also under-represented among the set of curated human haploinsufficient genes (6 of the 299 are on the X chromosome, a P
value for under-representation of 0.005). Furthermore, 2
of the 10 HI orthologues (that is, genes in our predicted
human haploinsufficient set) found on the human (and
chimp) X chromosome (namely NLGN4X and DDX3X)
are among the 12 human genes that retain a functional
homologue on the Y chromosome (P = 0.003, hypergeometric test). This perhaps indicates selection for the
maintenance of their two-copy status. The remaining

Discussion
It appears that there is a special relationship between yeast
HI genes, or their orthologues, and the sex-determining or
mating-type-determining chromosomes, which is conserved across the eukaryotes.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, haploinsufficient genes
are over-represented on chromosome III (the chromosome bearing the mating-type locus). We found that,
across the phylum Ascomycota, orthologues of S. cerevisiae HI genes are also represented on the chromosome
that bears the mating-type locus. We propose that the
linkage of HI genes to the mating-type loci represents
an ancient arrangement that guards against the survival
of diploid maters. These would be produced by the loss
of a single copy of the mating-type chromosome and

could lead to the generation of triploid hybrids, which
would be detrimental to the fitness of the population.
It might be contended that this arrangement is merely
a ‘frozen accident’ that confers no selective advantage
on the organism. For instance, an ancestral arrangement
of genes on the mating chromosome that happened to
include an over-representation of HI genes has been
preserved over evolutionary time due to a failure of that
chromosome to become rearranged through translocation events with the other chromosomes in the genome.
It is certainly true that among the Saccharomyces ’sensu
stricto’ (those yeasts which can mate with S. cerevisiae,
and with each other, to produce viable hybrids), no
translocation events have occurred between chromosome III and any of the other chromosomes. The same
is true of chromosomes I and XIII [26,27]. However,
Gordon et al. [28] have determined that 32 translocation
events have occurred during the evolution of the

de Clare et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/15

Saccharomyces ’sensu stricto’ from the common,
immediate pre-WGD, ancestral yeast, and 2 of these
have involved the mating-type chromosome. Moreover,
if one aligns the chromosomes of the pre-WGD species
Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii with those of S. cerevisiae, around 200 translocation events can be detected
and there is no evidence for any under-representation of
such events on the mating chromosome (P of underrepresentation = 0.99). The most parsimonious explanation is therefore that the over-representation of HI
genes on this chromosome has been maintained by
selection.
The arrangement has been preserved since the preWGD common yeast ancestor and, among the species
for which genome sequences are available, is lost only in
Candida albicans and Candida dublinensis, two species
that do not have a natural sexual cycle. This may lead
to a relaxation of the selective pressure for the accumulation of HI genes on the MAT-bearing chromosome. In
addition, both C. albicans and C. dubliniensis exhibit a
high degree of genomic instability, with frequent chromosomal rearrangement and aneuploidy in populations
of both laboratory strains and clinical isolates [29]. Not
only does this imply a very low probability of retaining
an ancient chromosomal arrangement (and thus the
ancient MAT-HI linkage) in the absence of sex-driven
selective pressure, but the necessity of tolerating frequent aneuploidy within the population might drive
selection against the accumulation of HI genes on any
one chromosome. Moreover, loss of one copy of the
MAT-bearing chromosome 5 of C. albicans is required
for adaptation to utilise alternative carbon sources, and
to drive the white/opaque transition [30]. Since opaque
cells have a vastly higher mating efficiency [30], loss of
the MAT chromosome should actually be favourable for
sex in C. albicans, and thus selective pressure should
act against the accumulation of HI genes on this chromosome. This is indeed what we have observed, with a
P value of 0.04.
In animals, as for the Fungi, we propose that a relationship between haploinsufficiency and the mating-type
chromosomes (in this case, an explicit exclusion of HI
genes from the X) arose in a common ancestor, and,
owing to the selective advantage (or, more precisely,
protection against a selective disadvantage) conferred,
has been retained throughout the lineage. HI depletion
is one of the features preserved in the highly-conserved
mammalian X chromosome lineage, but has also been
retained on the long-diverged Caenorhabditis elegans X.
Again, the idea of a ‘frozen accident’ should be considered, this time with the X chromosome of a common
animal ancestor being devoid of HI orthologues and
that situation being preserved due to a lack of genetic
exchange between X and the autosomes. It is true that,

Page 8 of 11

as with the Saccharomyces ’sensu stricto’ yeasts, very
few translocations involving the X chromosome have
occurred among the mammals (three between the
human X and cow chromosomes 7, 15 and 29; one
from human X to rat 12 and rabbit 3; and five from
human X to possum 4 and 7; [31]). Between the more
distantly-related species, however, chromosomal rearrangements involving genes on the X are frequent. For
example, Kohn et al. [32] mapped orthologues of 300
human X-chromosome genes to multiple chromosomes
in Tetraodon nigroviridis (spotted pufferfish) and Danio
rerio (zebrafish). In the latter species, 13 different linkage groups bear at least 5 of the X chromosome orthologues. Reversing the mapping, the human X
chromosome is composed of over 30 distinct synteny
blocks, from at least 10 different chromosomes, with
respect to T. nigroviridis [33]. These ancestral rearrangements would have provided ample opportunity for HI
genes to be transferred onto the X chromosome, and
suggests that there has been active selection against this.
In many of the higher eukaryotes, dosage compensation
mechanisms exist to bring the expression levels of the
female’s X-linked genes in line with those of the male [34].
In mammals, this is achieved by X chromosome inactivation and an analogous situation occurs in C. elegans, with
expression levels of the genes on both of the X chromosomes in the XX hermaphrodite being reduced by a factor
of two [34]. X inactivation therefore amounts to an additional selective pressure against the accumulation of HI
genes on the X chromosome, since their presence would
be detrimental in both the heterogametic male, and the
female with an inactivated X (Figure 1b).
In contrast, the opposite mechanism operates in D.
melanogaster, with the assembly of a male-specific ribonucleoprotein complex (the dosage compensation complex or DCC) modifying the chromatin structure on the
male’s X chromosome, and acting to double the expression levels of all its genes [34]. Thus, the presence of HI
genes on the X chromosome should not adversely affect
male fitness and, indeed, we have found that D. melanogaster (along with Gallus gallus, see below) does not
exhibit a depletion of HI orthologues on the X chromosome (Figure 1b).
Similarly, the failure to observe a significant underrepresentation of HI orthologues on the Z chromosome
of the chicken may be due to a lack of global dosage
compensation in the avian ZW system (see [35]). This
would result in an absence of selective pressure, in the
(homogametic) male, against the Z linkage of HI genes.
However, local downregulation of the expression of
small clusters of genes on the chicken Z in (ZZ) males
has been reported [35], and we note that HI orthologues
on this chromosome are 2.5 times more likely to be
found in the regions of peak expression (comprising 5

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/15

of the 18 genes in these regions having yeast orthologues), as opposed to these ‘silenced’ regions along the
chromosome.
Haploinsufficient genes are being increasingly recognised for their role in human disease, and our results
suggest that the phenotype may have had a major
impact on genome organization over a significant
stretch evolutionary time. Haploinsufficient S. cerevisiae
genes are retained across the eukaryotic lineage and,
furthermore, the haploinsufficiency of orthologous loci
is conserved from the Fungi to the animals. This striking result suggests that our S. cerevisiae results might be
used to speed the discovery of novel HI genes in
humans, perhaps by guiding a gene knockout study in
either human cell lines or mice.

Methods
Orthology assignments and phenotypic analysis

Orthology assignments were made using the InParanoid
algorithm [36], and compared with the results of a
BLAST [37] reciprocal best-hits search. GO_slim annotations for S. cerevisiae genes were retrieved from the
Gene Ontology Consortium [20]. GO enrichment
searches were performed using the Babelomics 4 FatiGO
tool [38]. Associations of the human candidate set with
inherited diseases were obtained from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database [19].
Paralogous WGD pairs for the Saccharomycetales
were obtained from Byrne and Wolfe [39]. S. cerevisiae
over-expression phenotypes were from Sopko et al. [40]
and homozygous deletion phenotypes from Winzeler
et al. [41]. The sequence of the human X chromosome
and the pseudoautosomal regions were obtained from
Ross et al. [42] and Graves et al. [43], respectively.
Statistical testing

To assess the significance of HI gene conservation, the
number of HI genes having orthologues in a given species, given the number of S. cerevisiae HI genes, was
compared against the whole-genome conserved proportion using a c2 or Fisher exact test (depending on sample
size), with the null hypothesis of identical distribution.
To assess the significance of HI gene numbers on a given
chromosome, we calculated the hypergeometric probability, given the number of genes on the chromosome, and
the number of HI genes in the genome.
A similar approach was taken in order to determine
the significance of the distribution of HI orthologues
across the chromosomes. The number of HI orthologues
on the particular chromosome, given the total number
of orthologues on the chromosome, was compared
against the total number of HI orthologues in the species. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine significance, using the null hypothesis that the distribution of

Page 9 of 11

HI orthologues would not differ from that of orthologues in general. We applied a similar methodology to
confirm that the distribution of HI orthologues did
indeed differ from the set of non-HI orthologues (data
not shown). All findings of significance were reiterated
using a z test for difference of proportions. Where
necessary, P values were corrected for multiple testing.
Deletion mutant construction

Candidate K. lactis and S. kluyveri genes were those on
their chromosomes bearing the mating-type locus,
which have a reciprocal best-hit orthologue on S. cerevisiae chromosome III which showed a haploinsufficient
phenotype in selections in turbidostat culture. Of these,
10 K. lactis, and 15 S. kluyveri genes (see Table 3) were
selected for targeting.
Strains were cultured in YPD rich medium (1% yeast
extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), and Escherichia coli
strains in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract,
1% NaCl). The pFA6a-KanMX and pAG25-NatMX plasmids were harvested from, respectively, E. coli transformants pFA6 and pAG25 by miniprep and digested with
NotI. The resulting KanMX/NatMX gene was purified
using a QIAquick kit (Qiagen, West Sussex UK).
Though amenable to transformation using techniques
and plasmids designed for S. cerevisiae, the efficiency of
homologous recombination in both K. lactis and S. kluyveri is much lower than in S. cerevisiae. Efficient gene
targeting therefore requires at least 500 bases of homology between the regions flanking the target gene, and
the replacement cassette. Such cassettes, containing
either the KanMX or NatMX [44] gene (conferring
resistance to geneticin 418 or nourseothricin, respectively), were constructed using the two-step polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) method described by Wach et al.
[45] with modifications. For the first step, two standard
PCR reactions were set up to amplify the 500-nucleotide
(nt) regions immediately upstream (or downstream) of
the target gene, with genomic K. lactis CK11 or S. kluyveri CBS 3082 DNA as a template. Oligonucleotides
were designed so as to concatenate an additional
26 bases homologous to the 5’ (or 3’) end of the marker
gene onto the upstream (or downstream) amplified
region.
These approximately 550-base upstream and downstream fragments were then used as primers in a second
PCR reaction. The Roche Expand Long Template PCR
system (Roche Diagnostics, West Sussex UK) containing
a mixture of Taq and Tgo DNA polymerases was used,
a typical reaction containing 0.5 μl (approximately
50 ng) of each of the first PCR products, 0.3-0.5 μg of
the NotI-digested plasmid. PCR was carried out in a
reaction volume of 50 μl, containing 200 μM of each
dNTP, 1.75 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 9.2, 16

de Clare et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/15

mM (NH4)SO4, and 0.75 μl of enzyme mix. A Bio-Rad
Thermo-Cycler 1000 (Bio-Rad laboratories, Hertfordshire UK) was programmed to initially denature the
samples at 92°C for 120 s, then perform 10 cycles of
10 s at 92°C, 30 s at 50°C, 120 s at 68°C, followed by
25 cycles of 15 s at 92°C, 30 s at 50°C, and 120 s at
68°C, with an additional 20 s elongation for each successive cycle [46].
The resulting PCR product was used to transform
K. lactis CK11 or S. kluyveri CBS 3082 following the
method of Hill et al. [47]. Cells were grown in rich
medium to a density of approximately 107 cells/l, harvested by centrifugation, washed in 10 ml 100 μM
lithium acetate, and finally resuspended in 1 ml of 100
μM lithium acetate. A total of 100 μl of cell suspension
was added per 10 μl of PCR product; 240 μl of 50% (w/
v) poly(ethylene glycol)-3000; 30 μl 1 M lithium acetate;
and 25 μl 2 mg/ml single-stranded (ss)-DNA. The suspension was incubated at 30°C with shaking for 30 min;
43 μl of dimethylsulfoxide added; and subsequently heat
shocked at 42°C for 10 min. Cells were incubated in
YPD for 3 h at 30°C, and G418 and nourseothricinresistant transformants selected on YPD containing 0.2
mg/ml G418 and 0.1 mg/ml clonNAT (Werner Bioagents, Jena Germany), respectively. Correct marker integration was confirmed by colony PCR amplification of
both the marker gene, and of the remaining copy of the
target locus.
Growth rate measurements

Stationary-phase cultures were diluted 1:100 in YPD,
and 200 μl transferred into 1 well of a 96-well microtitre
plate. A BMG Fluostar Optima microplate reader (BMG
Labtech, Aylesbury UK) was used to take 600 nm
absorbance readings at 10-min intervals over a period of
24-35 h. A curve-fitting algorithm, implemented in R,
calculated the maximum growth rate from the measured
growth curve, and the median was taken across all replicates of the strain in the plate. This value was compared
with the median for each of the other strains in the
same microplate, with significant growth-rate variation
identified using a two-tailed t test at 95% significance.
Measurements were repeated at least five times for each
strain. The standard deviation of the repeated measurements was calculated, and the maximum among all
strains (9%) was taken as the uncertainty in each strain.
Statistical testing

The P value for the overlap between the sets of haploinsufficient genes in S. kluyveri or K. lactis and S. cerevisiae was calculated by assuming that the frequency of
haploinsufficiency within the genome of these two species was equal to that in S. cerevisiae (approximately
20% in YPD). A P value can be ascribed to each

Page 10 of 11

orthologue set individually. With the null hypothesis
that haploinsufficiency in S. cerevisiae and S. kluyveri/K.
lactis is independent, the probability that both members
of a given orthologue pair are HI is P = 0.2, and if the
gene is HI in all three species, P = 0.2 2 = 0.04. The
probability of observing n orthologue pairs in which
both genes are HI, out of N pairs tested, is then given
by the binomial probability of n successes, and (N-n)
failures, with probability of success = 0.2. Thus the P
value for 9/10 K. lactis/S. cerevisiae pairs having both
orthologues HI is 4 × 10-6, and for 4/5 S. kluyveri/S. cerevisiae pairs both being HI is 7 × 10-3.
