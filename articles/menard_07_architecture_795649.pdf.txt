Abstract
Background: The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) groups bacterial species with beneficial properties that can
improve crop yields or remediate polluted sites but can also lead to dramatic human clinical outcomes among
cystic fibrosis (CF) or immuno-compromised individuals. Genome-wide regulatory processes of gene expression
could explain parts of this bacterial duality. Transcriptional σ70 factors are components of these processes. They
allow the reversible binding of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to form the holoenzyme that will lead to
mRNA synthesis from a DNA promoter region. Bcc genome-wide analyses were performed to investigate the
major evolutionary trends taking place in the σ70 family of these bacteria.
Results: Twenty σ70 paralogous genes were detected in the Burkholderia cenocepacia strain J2315 (Bcen-J2315)
genome, of which 14 were of the ECF (extracytoplasmic function) group. Non-ECF paralogs were related to
primary (rpoD), alternative primary, stationary phase (rpoS), flagellin biosynthesis (fliA), and heat shock (rpoH)
factors. The number of σ70 genetic determinants among this genome was of 2,86 per Mb. This number is lower
than the one of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species found in similar habitats including CF lungs. These two bacterial
groups showed strikingly different σ70 family architectures, with only three ECF paralogs in common (fecI-like,
pvdS and algU). Bcen-J2315 σ70 paralogs showed clade-specific distributions. Some paralogs appeared limited to
the ET12 epidemic clone (ecfA2), particular Bcc species (sigI), the Burkholderia genus (ecfJ, ecfF, and sigJ), certain
proteobacterial groups (ecfA1, ecfC, ecfD, ecfE, ecfG, ecfL, ecfM and rpoS), or were broadly distributed in the
eubacteria (ecfI, ecfK, ecfH, ecfB, and rpoD-, rpoH-, fliA-like genes). Genomic instability of this gene family was driven
by chromosomal inversion (ecfA2), recent duplication events (ecfA and RpoD), localized (ecfG) and large scale
deletions (sigI, sigJ, ecfC, ecfH, and ecfK), and a phage integration event (ecfE).
Conclusion: The Bcc σ70 gene family was found to be under strong selective pressures that could lead to
acquisition/deletion, and duplication events modifying its architecture. Comparative analysis of Bcc and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa σ70 gene families revealed distinct evolutionary strategies, with the Bcc having selected
several alternative primary factors, something not recorded among P. aeruginosa and only previously reported to
occur among the actinobacteria.

Background

Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) bacterial species are βproteobacteria that can be found in various environments
including freshwater and plant rhizosphere. They are also
the etiological agents of several human infections. This
bacterial complex includes several closely related species
or genomovars of Burkholderia that can be isolated from
cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. These species can also be
found in nosocomial infections. B. cenocepacia (Bcen) is a
species of the Bcc that can lead to the "cepacia syndrome",
a dramatic necrotizing pneumonia (for review see [1]).
Three major B. cenocepacia epidemic clones have been
described around the world: ET12, PHDC and Midwest
[2-4]. Three strains of these clonal complexes (one of
ET12 and two of PHDC) were sequenced by the Sanger
Institute and the Joint Genome Institute, and are available
on their respective web site. Several other Bcc and Burkholderia strains were sequenced or are in progress of getting
sequenced (for a list see [5]).
The ability at colonizing several biotopes is a character
observed in the Bcc but also among other bacterial species
like Pseudomonas aeruginosa of the γ-proteobacteria. This
versatility has been linked to an important diversity of regulatory processes including those of the σ70 gene family
[6]. Transcriptional σ70 factors can bind reversibly to
eubacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) to
form the holoenzyme, and enable its promoter-specific
attachment. This holoenzyme can drive synthesis of
mRNA (but the process could be regulated by several transcriptional repressors [7] and activators [8]). Through evolution, selective pressures seem to have favoured the
emergence of several paralogous lineages of σ70, and these
factors became a central component of bacterial adaptability to changing environments including host colonization. This resulted in the observation of some sort of
relation between the lifestyle of bacteria and the number
of genes encoding σ70 factors in their genome. For example, 65 σ70 gene sequences were detected among the
genome of Streptomyces coelicolor [9] which is ubiquitous
and morphologically complex but only one in Mycoplasma
spp. which are host- and disease-specific [10,11]. Among
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species sharing several niches
with the Bcc, 23 σ70 gene sequences have been reported
[6]. Generally speaking, σ70 factors can be divided into
four groups according to sequence similarities and promoter-recognition specificities [12,13]: (1) the essential
primary sigma factors, involved mainly in exponential
growth, and the alternative actinomycetal sigma factors;
(2) the stationary phase factors; (3) the factors involved in
sporangium development, flagellin synthesis and heat
shock response, and (4) the extracytoplasmic function
sigma factors (termed ECF). All these factors are in competition for the same RNAP core enzyme [14]. Genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/308

under the control of a same sigma factor are termed to be
part of a same sigmulon.
Here, we report the first global analysis of the σ70 gene
family among the Burkholderia cepacia complex. The first
fully sequenced Bcc genome of B. cenocepacia (strain
J2315 of the ET12 epidemic clone) was used as the reference sequence for this study.

Results and Discussion

Detection and number of σ70 gene sequences in BcenJ2315 genome
σ 70 TBLASTN searches of B. cenocepacia strain J2315
(Bcen-J2315) genome sequence were performed. First,
searches making use of ten σ70 factors of the main groups
of this family were carried out. Then, a second round of
TBLASTN searches using all B. cenocepacia factors detected
in the initial screening was done. This led to the identification of twenty σ70 gene sequences, thirteen on chromosome 1, seven on chromosome 2, and none on
chromosome 3 (Table 1). All genomic regions harbouring
σ70 coding sequences (CDS) were analysed by the testcode
programme, to identify their corresponding ORF. In the
case of the presence of multiple initiation codons, the
ORF showing the longest CDS was selected. All the
defined σ70 gene sequences and their position on the BcenJ2315 genome are listed in Table 1. Given the genome size
of Bcen-J2315 (8,056 Mb), an average of 2,86 σ70 gene
sequences per Mb was computed. This number of sigma
genes is slightly lower than the number reported in P. aeruginosa (23 σ70 in strain PA01, genome size of 6,26 Mb)
for which an average of 3,67 σ70 genes per Mb was calculated. It is also lower than the one of the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor strain A3(2) (8,67 Mb) which has a
similar genome size. However, S. coelicolor has a very distinct morphology (being hyphal and producing spores)
and ecology. This simplistic analysis suggests that bacteria
like the Bcc and P. aeruginosa, which are sharing several
habitats, have similar number of σ70 gene sequences.
However, the composition of these families was found to
be quite different (as described in the next sections).
Classification of σ70 gene sequences of Bcen-J2315 into
functional categories
Translated amino acid (AA) sequences from Bcen-J2315
σ70 coding sequences were positioned among the main
eubacterial σ70 lineages, using a decisional σ70 NeighborJoining (NJ) phylogenetic tree limited to key sequences
(Fig. 1). This phylogenetic tree divides the σ70 gene family
into four groups (see [13]): (1) one grouping the primary
(mainly RpoD) and alternative primary actinomycetal factors, (2) one grouping the stationary phase factors
(mainly named RpoS), (3) one the heat shock (RpoH),
flagellin (FliA), and cellular differentiation (WhiG) factors, and (4) one grouping factors involved in extracyto-

TBLASTN searches of Bce-J2315 σ factors were performed on fully sequenced Burkholderia genomes. In accordance with phylogenetic inferences shown in Fig. 3 and 4, TBLASTN were considered
to reveal homologs or orthologs of a same σ70 lineage when showing identity values above 50% and similarity higher than 63%, and when being part of a phylogenetic cluster supported by high
bootstrap values. • P. aeruginosa OrbS homologs, named PvdS, showed 38% identity and 56% similarity with Bcen-J2315 homolog. Sequences were retrieved from [51-54]. Genomes of the following
strains were analysed: B. cenocepacia, strains J2315, AU1054, HI2424, PC184 (negative for Bcen-SigJ); B. vietnamiensis, G4; Burkholderia sp., 383 ; B. ambifaria, AMMD, B. dolosa, AU0158; B. xenovorans,
LB400; B. mallei, ATCC23344, 10229, GB8 horse 4, SAVP1; B. pseudomallei, 1710a, 1710b, S13, 1655, 668, K96243; B. thailendensis, E264; P. aeruginosa, PAO1, PA14. * indicates an ORF different from

plasmic functions (named ECF factors). All these groups
are supported by high bootstrap values. This phylogenetic
tree allowed to allocate 14 of the Bcen-J2315 σ70 gene
sequences into the ECF (see Table 1). The ECF group is
often the most important in number, and is the main
group involved in bacterial responses toward changing
environmental conditions. ECF sequences represent 66%
of the σ70 gene sequences of the Bcen-J2315 genome, a
number which is lower than the one observed in P. aeruginosa (82%) [6,15]. Two deduced AA sequences, EcfA1
and EcfA2, are 100% identical in Bcen-J2315, and their
respective genes are positioned on two identical DNA
strands of 40 kb that are diametrically opposed on chromosome 1 (see section on ecfA for further details). For the
remaining 6 factors, three were allocated to group 1 (SigE,
SigI and SigJ), one to group 2 (SigK), and two to group 3
(SigL and SigM).
Bcen-J2315 deduced σ70 factors conserved domains were
revealed by CDD analyses (Fig. 2). Four conserved
domains (regions 1 to 4) were described [12] among the
σ70 family, with region 1 being sub-divided into R1_1 and
R1_2. Bcen-J2315 SigE, I and J contain all four regions.
Regions 2 and 4 were identified in Bcen-J2315 deduced
SigL, SigM and SigK sequences but only a full region 3 was
found in SigM and SigK. Sub region 1_1 was detected in
SigK. Only regions 2 and 4 were detected among the ECF
factors.

Molecular phylogeny of Bcen-J2315 primary, stationary,
and stress response/cellular differentiation/flagellin
synthesis σ70 gene sequences
The NJ tree of Fig. 1 could not be used to asses accurately
the phylogenetic relationships among each of the main
σ70 phylogenetic groups. The phylogenetic resolution of
the σ70 family appeared to be more robustly determined
by splitting the dataset into two subsets corresponding to
ECF and non-ECF (primary, stationary, and stress
response/cellular differentiation) deduced σ70 AA
sequences.

Reliable phylogenetic positioning of Bcen-J2315 deduced
σ70 factors was performed by first extracting all AA
sequences in the databases showing significant similarities with these factors. These sequences were then added
to the multiple alignment obtained by Lavire et al. [13],
and a NJ phylogenetic tree was inferred (Fig. 3). Names of
lineages used in Lavire et al. [13] were kept. The NJ tree of
non-ECF AA sequences is divided into three major clusters
of paralogs, matching the non-ECF categories described in
the above section (groups 1, 2 and 3). All these paralogous σ70 sequences appear to have emerged early in the
evolution of the eubacteria. The SigE/RpoD (group 1),
SigM/FliA and SigL/RpoH homologs (group 3) were
detected among at least the α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria,
suggesting an emergence prior to the diversification of
these bacterial groups. However, the group 2 factors

σ70 factors

- the primary and alternative primary
phylogenetic
radiation (group 1)
In the NJ tree of non-ECF σ70 factors (Fig. 3), the group of
primary and alternative primary factors was found divided
into 7 distinct and significant lineages: C, D and E corresponding to the essential eubacterial primary factors, G
and H being representatives of the alternative primary factors lineages of the actinobacteria, and I and J being two
novel lineages. Bcen-J2315 SigE and its Burkholderia
orthologs are found to be part of cluster E, the RpoD lineage of essential sigma factors of the proteobacteria, and
were thus renamed RpoD. A B. dolosa strain AU0158
RpoD-like sequence appeared distantly related to other
Burkholderia deduced RpoD but a closer look at its gene
structure showed a frameshift probably due to a sequencing mistake. An additional copy of the rpoD gene was
detected in the B. xenovorans genome (Fig. 3). This copy
shows a deduced AA sequence significantly different from
the ones of the sigE/rpoD Burkholderia orthologs, suggesting either acquisition by an horizontal transfer event or an

Bcen-J2315 SigI and SigJ deduced sequences and their
orthologs revealed two novel lineages of group 1 factors
which are restricted to the Burkholderia genomes (Fig. 3),
and were thus termed alternative Burkholderia primary factors. The sigJ coding sequence was not detected in B. xenovorans and B. cenocepacia PC184 genomes (Table 2 and
see section on genomic rearrangements). However, sigJ
DNA probings of Bcc genomic DNA blots showed a broad
distribution among the Bcc (including B. cepacia, B. cenocepacia, B. stabilis, B. dolosa, B. vietnamiensis, B. multivorans
and B. pyrrocinia) (Table 2). sigI was not detected in the
genomes of the Bcc strain 383, of B. xenovorans, and of B.
pseudomallei and its closely related genomes (see section
on genomic rearrangements). Nevertheless, Bcc DNA blot
analyses using sigI DNA probes showed this gene largely
distributed in the Bcc (Table 2). In B. xenovorans LB400
genome, sigI and sigJ were not detected but another lineage of alternative Burkholderia primary factors was found.
The presence of coding sequences of such factors can thus
be considered a common feature of Burkholderia genomes.
Alternative primary factors were never detected in P. aeruginosa. In fact, this is the first report demonstrating the
presence of alternative primary factors among bacteria
outside the actinomycetes. The function of these alternative primary factors is unknown but they possess all the
domains found among the RpoD factors i. e. -10 and -35
promoter recognition domains, RNA polymerase binding
domains, etc (Fig. 2). These factors could be replacing the
primary one under growth conditions inhibiting its
expression or functioning (potentially certain antibiotics).
- the stationary phase σ70 factors phylogenetic radiation (group 2)
The group 2 phylogenetic radiation is divided into two
clusters (supported by 96% and 97% of the bootstrap replicates, respectively) which match the diversification of
the proteobacteria into the β and γ subgroups (Fig. 3).
Bcen-J2315 sigK deduced amino acids sequence is clustered with the β-proteobacteria RpoS deduced sequences
(and was thus renamed rpoS). In B. cepacia and B. pseudomallei, RpoS was shown to be implicated in oxidative
stress response, to be induced by heat shock treatments,
and upon carbon starvation [16,17]. No RpoS-like coding
sequence was detected in any α-proteobacterial or other
eubacterial genomes. Among the actinomycetes, the stationary phase factors are known to be part of a fifth group
of sigma factors which was not considered in this study
i.e. the lineage of actinomycetal stress response and stationary phase factors (including sequences like S. coelicolor
RpoX, Mycobacterium tuberculosis SigF, etc) [18,19]. This
group is not closely related to group 2. Misleading automatic annotations of several RpoS gene sequences were
observed in Borrelia, Bacteroides, Blastopirellula, Rhodopirel-

lula, Moorella or Aquifex genome; their deduced factors did
not group in the RpoS cluster (data not shown). To clarify
this situation, we suggest the use of the name rpoS only for
sequences of the group 2 σ70 factors from the β- and γ-proteobacteria. The restricted distribution of RpoS gene
sequences and their close phylogenetic proximity with
Group 1 sequences (primary and alternative primary factors) suggest a likely emergence of rpoS from an ancestral
group 1 sequence. A duplication of the highly conserved
eubacterial rpoD gene probably led to this paralogous
group. Alternative primary factors described in the above
section might have evolved from similar but more recent
duplication events.

The emergence of rpoS can be considered a key event in
the evolution of the eubacteria. Molecular phylogenies of
RpoD (group 1), and FliA-like and RpoH-like sequences
(group 3) (Fig. 3) suggest an early diversification of the αproteobacterial sequences from those of the β- and γ-proteobacterial sequences. This can also be inferred from
other datasets e.g. rrs and concatenation of essential proteins [20]. The emergence of rpoS matches the separation
of the α-proteobacteria (no rpoS – ancestral state) from
the β- and γ-proteobacteria (harbouring rpoS).
- the stress response/cellular differentiation/flagellin synthesis σ70
factors phylogenetic radiation (group 3)
Group 3 is polyphyletic and divided into two groups, one
corresponding to FliA-like sequences, and one corresponding to RpoH-like ones (supported by 100% of the
bootstrap replicates). Bcen-J2315 sigM deduced AA
sequence belongs to the FliA subgroup, whereas BcenJ2315 sigL deduced AA sequence groups with the RpoHlike sequences (Fig. 3). A sigM (fliA) homolog was confirmed to be involved in motility among the Burkholderia
[21].
Molecular phylogeny of Bcen-J2315 extracytoplasmic
functions σ70 gene sequences (group 4)
Phylogenetic relationships among the ECF cluster are presented in Fig. 4. All database sequences closely related to
Bcen-J2315 putative ECF were considered in this analysis.
A first round of phylogenetic analysis allowed the identification of all database factors related to Bcen-J2315 ECFs.
A second round of analyses was then performed by limiting the dataset to a set of selected sequences representative
of the main phylogenetic trends observed. Fig. 4 shows
the best NJ tree obtained. Its structure is not supported by
high bootstrap values but all sub-groups of ECFs are supported by high ones. EcfA, EcfC and EcfI deduced AA
sequences are the only Bcen-J2315 ECF factors having
homologs in the P. aeruginosa genomes.
- ecfA: evidence of an ET12 clone-specific duplication event
EcfA-like deduced sequences are found in several proteobacterial genomes but could not be detected in the ones of
α-proteobacteria (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, B. vietnamiensis
and Burkholderia sp. 383 deduced EcfA sequences were
found to group apart from other EcfA-like sequences
belonging to the Burkholderia (Fig. 4); making these
sequences closer relatives of a Ralstonia homologous
sequence. ecfA encodes a factor highly similar to the wellcharacterized AlgU factor of P. aeruginosa which is
involved in alginate biosynthesis [22]. However, the B.
cepacia homolog of EcfA was recently shown not to be
involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and onion
pathogenicity. It was found involved in the adaptation to
heat stress and phosphate starvation [23]. Interestingly,
the ecfA gene sequence was found in two copies in the

obtained for this latter ET12 strain and the non-ET12 B.
cenocepacia isolates. B. cenocepacia PHDC strains (AU1054
and HI2424) and B. cenocepacia PC184 genomes harboured only the ecfA1 allele. The ET12 LMG 18863 strain,
which was not found to harbour the 40 kb ecfA-duplicated
region, could have either reverted to its previous genetic
organization or could be a more ancestral representative
of the ET12 clonal complex. These data suggest that duplication of the ecfA 40 kb locus could have contributed to
the radiation of the ET12 complex.

To trace back the ecfA duplication event in B. cenocepacia,
a PCR strategy was built. PCR primers were defined for
each hand of the duplicated 40 kb regions containing the
ecfA copies (Fig. 6a). PCR products from the B and C primers (Table 3), targeting the duplicated region containing
the ecfA2 allele, were obtained for all but the LMG 18863
strain of the ET12 clonal complex; a strain confirmed to
be a member of the ET12 clone by PCR screening of the
BCESM and cblA loci (data not shown, see [24]). PCR
products amplified with the A and B primers (Table 3),

duplication and its linked chromosomal inversion, were

detected two inversion events on these chromosomes. To
determine the role of ecfA-40 kb region in these duplication events, the chromosome 1 region was inverted manually between the two 40 kb duplications and compared
with Burkholderia sp. 383 chromosome 1 (Fig. 6c). In this
way, only the first inversion is detected, indicating that the
40 kb duplication was implicated in the large scale inversion of Bcen-J2315 chromosome 1. One border of the 40
kb duplication was found to harbor an Insertion Sequence
(IS) named ISBcen8 according to the IS Database [26].
This IS could have played a role in the duplication event
that led to the inversion of an important part of chromosome 1 of ET12 strains. This insertion sequence is found

(with at least 99% identity) in seven copies on chromosome 1, two copies on chromosome 2, and 3 copies on
chromosome 3. The ORF encoding the transposase of this
IS was identified with ORF finder and confirmed by GC
skew analysis. IS492 from the IS110 family (ORF: 34%
identity, 52% similarity) was found to be the closest
phyletic neighbour of this IS.
In several species such as P. aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi or
Bordetella pertussis, genome rearrangements were found
associated with infectious outbreaks [27-29]. Hughes et
al. [30] suggested that rearranged genomes could allow to
overcome the immune system of the host. The ecfA 40 kb

locus could thus have contributed to the emergence of the
hyper-virulent ET12 infra-specific clonal complex by driving a large scale inversion of chromosome 1.
- ecfB: involvement in temperature-dependent processes
This ECF lineage has a broad distribution (Fig. 4). Related
genes could be found in the α and γ-proteobacteria. ecfB
DNA probings of Bcc genomic DNA blots confirmed its
large distribution in the Bcc (Table 2). The deduced EcfB
protein is phylogenetically closely related to PrtI which is
involved in a temperature dependent regulation of certain
proteases [31]. However, no gene at the proximity of ecfB
was found to encode a protease in Bcen-J2315 and other
Burkholderia genomes. Such a situation was also observed
for the PrtI-like locus of the P. putida genome [6]. ecfB
could thus be involved in temperature dependent regulatory processes but seems to have been recruited for the
regulation of other protein families than proteases.
- ecfC and ecfI: ECF gene sequences involved in iron-uptake
The ECF NJ tree (Fig. 4) shows Bcen-J2315 deduced EcfI
sigma factor to group with the PvdS factor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the EcfC deduced factor to group
with FecI-like factors. EcfI was previously shown to be
involved in siderophore (ornibactin) biosynthesis [32]
(EcfI being named OrbS in this latter article). Here, it is
found to have a broad distribution (Fig. 4). FecI was
shown to be involved in the regulation of iron dicitrate
uptake in E. coli [33]. In other bacterial species, the fecIRA
system can regulate iron uptake by other siderophores
than citrate [34]. Phylogenetic analysis of EcfC/FecI
homologs suggests an emergence of this particular subgroup after the diversification of the α-proteobacteria (no
fecI homologs) from the other proteobacteria. Interestingly, FecI-like factors represented 26% of P. aeruginosa

deduced ECF factors, and 68% of those of P. putida [6].
Among P. aeruginosa and P. putida, these systems were all
physically linked to genes involved in the synthesis of
outer membrane siderophore receptor proteins. The high
numbers of FecI paralogs in these two pseudomonads
were considered indicative of a shared ability at colonizing certain niches that require distinct iron uptake systems
or particular interactions with siderophores [6]. In the
case of the Bcc, a single FecI-like factor was detected. The
ecfC gene, encoding this factor, was found physically
linked to fecR- and fecA-like gene sequences. FecI can
interact with FecR to activate the fecABCDE operon
involved in the transport of extracellular Fe(III)-citrate
complexes to the cytoplasm. FecR interaction is modulated by FecA which will activate the FecIR interactions
after perception of Fe(III)-citrate complexes. TBLASTN
searches using FecR were performed on selected Bcc
genomes to ensure that no FecIRA-like system was missed
during our analyses. These searches did not detect any
other FecIRA system in Bcen-J2315, B. vietnamiensis, B.
dolosa, and B. ambifaria genomes. Other TBLASTN
searches using HemO, CirA, Has, HxuC, and P. aeruginosa
SigX, FiuI, PigD, and PupI-homologs were performed to
complete this analysis. None of these BLAST searches
revealed novel coding sequences involved in haem- or
iron-uptake [6] in Bcen-J2315.
Interestingly, B. cenocepacia was recently shown able to get
its iron from ferritin by proteolytic degradation of this
iron-binding protein. B. cenocepacia is apparently the only
known pathogenic bacteria able to use ferritin as an iron
source [35]. The iron uptake strategies selected by P. aeruginosa and the Bcc are thus quite different; with P. aeruginosa showing a greater versatility in ECF regulated
processes.

- ecfD, ecfE, ecfG, ecfH, ecfL and ecfM loci: unknown physiological
implications
The physiological processes involving these regulatory
factors remain unknown. However, their distribution and
evolutionary history reveal several observations suggesting that they play significant roles.

EcfD is grouping with ECF factors deduced from genomes
of other proteobacterial groups (γ and ∆) but not α-proteobacterial ones. ecfD DNA probings of Bcc genomic
DNA blots showed a large distribution in the Bcc (Table
2). EcfE is not grouping with ECF factors from other proteobacteria but is closely related to σ factors found among
Solibacter usitatus and Cytophaga hutchinsonii. ecfE DNA
probings gave positive hybridization signals on B. cepacia,
B. cenocepacia, B. stabilis, B. dolosa and B. pyrrocinia
genomic DNA blots (Table 2). However, restricted
genomic DNA from all strains of B. multivorans and B. vietnamiensis, tested in this study, did not yield positive
hybridization signals with the ecfE probe. Phage DNA
might have played a role in the loss of ecfE in these bacterial species (see section on genomic rearrangements). Surprisingly, the ecfE deduced AA sequence of B. dolosa
AU0158 was found distantly related to other homologs of
the Bcc. EcfG is significantly grouping with σ factors
deduced from other β- and α-proteobacterial genomes but
not with γ-proteobacterial ones. In this case, a deletion of
ecfG-like sequences probably occurred early in the evolution of the γ-proteobacteria. Concerning the deduced AA
sequences of ecfK and ecfH coding regions, homologs
could be detected in genomes of the three main proteobacterial groups (α,β, and γ). Bcen-J2315 EcfH deduced
homologs were mainly found in genomes of α-proteobacteria but a sequence was also detected among one γ-proteobacterial genome, the one of Pseudomonas fluorescens.
ecfH was not detected in the B. vietnamiensis G4 and B.
ambifaria AMMD genomes (see section on genomic rearrangements). EcfK homologs were found in other Burkholderia genomes and in the one of a species of Polaromonas,
which is also part of the β-proteobacteria. ecfK was not
detected in the B. vietnamiensis G4 and B. ambifaria
AMMD genomes (see section on genomic rearragements).
EcfL is clustered with ECF without any known function
but encoding a TPR (Tetratricopeptide repeat) motif
involved in protein-protein interactions. This motif is not
found in EcfL and its related Burkholderia ECF factors. In
fact, deduced EcfL-like sequences retrieved from B. ambifaria AMMD, B. cenocepacia PC184 and B. pseudomallei 668
genomes are misleadingly annotated with a TPR repeat
motif in the databases. EcfL coding gene sequences are
found in the genomes of the actinobacteria and proteobacteria with the exception of the α-proteobacterial ones.
EcfM deduced orthologs were found among most proteobacterial sub-groups with the exception of B. pseudomallei
and closely related species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/308

- ecfF and ecfJ: evidence of Burkholderia-specific lineages
EcfF and EcfJ are distinct deduced σ70 factors which do not
group on the NJ tree (Fig. 4) with any of the previously
described ECF sigma factors available in the databases.
They can thus be considered Burkholderia-specific. However, ecfJ was not detected in the genome of B. xenovorans
LB400. The processes making use of these ECF factors
remain unknown.
Genomic rearrangements of σ70 genetic loci among Bcc
sequenced genomes
Inside the Bcc, syntheny analyses of the σ70 genetic loci
were performed using ACT [36]. Some of these results are
shown in Fig. 5. sigE, sigL, sigM, sigK, ecfA, ecfB, ecfD, ecfF,
ecfJ, ecfL and ecfM genetic loci were conserved over at least
10 kb (upstream and downstream) among the tested Bcc
genomes. ecfB is located 5,5 kb upstream ecfM. sigI, sigJ,
ecfC, ecfF, ecfG, ecfH, ecfI, and ecfK loci were affected by
various genomic rearrangements. ecfA, ecfB and ecfF are
physically linked to anti-sigma gene sequences. Three
major categories of genomic rearrangementswere defined,
one leading to a loss of a sigma gene through unknown
processes, one leading to a loss of a sigma gene through
integration of phage DNA, and one leading to a reorganization of the genetic environment surrounding the sigma
gene.
- loss of σ70 gene sequences in the Bcc: cases of ecfC, ecfG, ecfH,
ecfK, sigI, and sigJ loci
In this category, in one instance, a very precise deletion of
a sigma gene and its respective anti-sigma was observed.
This situation was observed for ecfG and its anti-sigma in
the B. vietnamiensis G4 genome. However, in most
instances, the loss of a sigma gene was concomitant to the
loss of important pieces of DNA. sigI and sigJ are, in fact,
found deleted in respectively Burkholderia sp. 383, and B.
cenocepacia PC184, and the extension of the deleted
regions were respectively of 20 and 150 kb. Loss of ecfH in
B. vietnamiensis G4 and B. dolosa AU0158 genomes were
also associated with the deletion of a DNA region (9 and
12 kb, respectively). In the case of the ecfK locus, which is
found at the proximity of a pilus synthesis cluster and
genes involved in the synthesis of an alkylhydroperoxidase (Fig. 5b), its deletion involved a loss of about 7 kb in
the genomes of B. vietnamiensis G4 and B. ambifaria
AMMD. Interestingly, the configuration of these latter
deletions were identical in these two genomes, suggesting
that it had either occurred prior to the separation of these
bacteria into two distinct species or involved similar processes. ecfC deletion event was observed among several
genomes but the extent of the deletion events was variable. Nevertheless, one border was always conserved. ecfC
(fecI-like) is deleted in B. vietnamiensis G4, B. ambifaria
AMMD and B. dolosa AU0158 genomes (Fig. 5a). Part of
the deletion concerned genes involved in iron-uptake.

These genomic rearrangements of the ecfC genetic cluster
could explain the differences observed between B. cepacia
and B. vietnamiensis in response to iron starvation. B. vietnamiensis was only found to produce ornibactin under
iron starvation while B. cepacia clinical isolates could also
produce pyochelin and cepabactin [37]. Among the B.
ambifaria and B. dolosa ecfC loci, 4 to 6 ORFs, over the
eleven likely involved in iron-uptake in Bcen-J2315, were
found conserved. One of these was found encoding a citrate symporter involved in the transport of Fe(III)-citrate
complexes. To our knowledge, it is not yet known if B.
ambifaria and B. dolosa ecfC loci are functional.
- loss of ecfE in B. vietnamiensis: involvement of phage DNA
Concerning this second category, syntheny analysis
showed the Bcen-J2315 ecfE region to have been modified
by the integration of phage DNA in B. vietnamiensis strain
G4. In this genome, ecfE and an overall 5 kb region are
replaced by phage DNA. All genes upstream the tRNA
gene of the ecfE region are conserved. The loss of ecfE in B.
vietnamiensis was confirmed by DNA blot analyses (Table
2). All restricted genomic DNA of the B. vietnamiensis
strains tested did not show any DNA hybridization with
an ecfE probe. Similarly, no positive hybrization signal
could be obtained on B. multivorans DNA blots (Table 2),
while positive signals were obtained for the other Bcc species. It is not known if the integration of phage DNA was
involved in the deletion of ecfE among the B. vietnamiensis
and B. multivorans strains analysed by DNA probings.
However, we consider that this is highly probable.
- reorganized σ70 genetic loci in the Bcc: cases of ecfI and ecfE loci
Concerning this third category, two cases were observed.
One concerned the ecfI (pvdS homolog) region, and the
other one the ecfE region. Regarding ecfI and its related
genetic cluster, the ornibactin biosynthesis cluster, genes
upstream ecfI are found deleted in B. vietnamiensis G4, B.
cenocepacia HI2424 and AU1054 genomes, and translocated elsewhere in the Burkholderia sp. 383 genome. Genes
involved in fimbrial synthesis, and the synthesis of a two
component system were partly affected by these rearrangements (see Fig. 5d). Similarly, the ecfE region and
three of its neighboring genes proximal to a tRNA gene
sequence in B. cenocepacia J2315 chromosome 1 were
translocated into a distinct region of the genome of Burkholderia sp. 383, while all other genes were kept in place
(Fig. 5c).

Conclusion

This paper was dedicated to the analysis of the σ70 gene
family, its architecture and plasticity, through an analysis
of about 20 genome sequences of the eubacterial Burkholderia genus. Emphasis was made on a bacterial group of
this genus which is named the "Burkholderia cepacia complex" or Bcc. Several epidemic clones have been described

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/308

in the Bcc, including bacteria responsible of the "cepacia
syndrome", a dramatic necrotizing pneumonia. The great
versatility of these Bcc species could be linked to an
important diversity in regulatory processes including
those of the σ70 gene family. The σ70 gene family is widely
distributed among the eubacteria, and probably emerged
early in bacterial evolution. Duplication events led to the
emergence of several Bcc σ70 paralogs which were found
limited to certain bacterial groups like the proteobacteria,
Burkholderia, the cepacia complex, and particular Bcc species or strains. This gene family was found to be under
strong selective pressures that could lead to acquisition/
deletion (ecfE, ecfG, sigI, sigJ, ecfC, ecfH, and ecfK), and
duplication events (ecfA and rpoD) modifying its architecture. These changes are likely to be key events in Bcc evolution, generating novel gene expression profiles that
could be more suited for the colonization of particular
biotopes including the respiratory tract of CF patients. A
key conclusion was that the comparative analysis of the
σ70 gene architecture of Bcc species and of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, a species found in similar habitats including
CF lungs, revealed distinct evolutionary strategy, with the
Bcc having selected several alternative primary factors,
something not recorded among P. aeruginosa and only
reported to occur among the actinobacteria. Only three
ECF paralogs (FecI-like, PvdS and AlgU) were found in
common between the Bcc and P. aeruginosa. The next step
in these studies will be to investigate the impact of gains
and losses of σ70 determinants in the ecology of the Bcc
and the colonization of the CF lungs.

Methods

B. cenocepacia genome sequence, and σ70 BLAST and
ORF searches
TBLASTN searches of B. cenocepacia J2315 genome were
performed using the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute web
site [26]. The following ten σ70 factors were used for these
searches: RpoD (accession #AAA24601), RpoS
(#CAA34435), RpoH (#AAA24587), SigF (#AAA22788),
FliA (#BAA00389), AlgU (#AAC43714), CnrH
(#AAA21967), HrpL (#AAD00805), PpuI (#CAA54870),
and RfaY (#AAA92044). All loci encoding putative proteins showing good similarities with the target proteins
were analysed by FramePlot [38], ORF finder [39] and
testcode [40]. BLASTP analyses of the deduced ORF proteins were performed [41]. Conserved domains among
sigma factors were detected using CDD 2.02 [42]. To
achieve saturation in the detection of σ70 factors, identified putative factors were concatenated and the resulting
sequence compared to Bcen-J2315 chromosomes using
ACT. This graphical tool allows visualisation of a BLAST
comparison of two sequences. A TBLASTN was performed
using Bcen-J2315 chromosomes as the database and the
concatenated sigma sequences as the query. Visual identification of DNA regions showing similarity with different

sigma factors was performed and candidate ORF were
analysed as stated above.
Molecular phylogenetic analyses
Multiple alignments were computed using CLUSTALW
[43]. Distances between sequence pairs, the inferred phylogenetic trees, and bootstrap values were all computed
through the Mega3 graphic tool [44]. Phylogenetic trees
were built using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [45].
Bootstrap replicates were performed using 1000 replicates. Gap containing sites were deleted globally or by pair
of sequences. Alignments can be downloaded using the
UMR5557 http server [46,47].
Bacterial strains, DNA extractions, PCR amplification and
DNA blot hybridizations
Strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. Bacteria
were grown in LB (Luria-Bertani) [48] broth at 30°C.
DNA extractions were performed as previously described
[49]. PCR amplifications (25 µl) were done according to
the Taq polymerase manufacturer (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise France) without 1% w-1 (detergent) but 1,25 µL of
DMSO. PCR primers are indicated in Table 3. PCR cycles
using total DNA were as follow: (1) 95°C for 5 min, (2)
95°C for 30 sec, selected annealing temperature for 30 sec
(see Table 3), 72°C for 30 sec (35 cycles), (3) 72°C for 5
min.

Genomic DNA blots were performed on Genescreen
(USA) nylon membranes following [50]. The DNA (5 µg)
was digested with EcoRI (Fermentas) at 1 U/µg DNA, for
16 h at 37°C. DNA probes were labelled using the random priming labelling kit (Amersham-Pharmacia, OrsayFrance). DNA hybridizations were carried out according
to the nylon membrane manufacturer (Genescreen, USA).
Membranes were hybridized and washed at 65°C. Autoradiography was performed according to [50].
