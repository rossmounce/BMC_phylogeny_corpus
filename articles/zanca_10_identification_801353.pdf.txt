Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs, some of which are conserved in diverse plant
genomes. Therefore, computational identification and further experimental validation of miRNAs from non-model
organisms is both feasible and instrumental for addressing miRNA-based gene regulation and evolution. Sugarcane
(Saccharum spp.) is an important biofuel crop with publicly available expressed sequence tag and genomic survey
sequence databases, but little is known about miRNAs and their targets in this highly polyploid species.
Results: In this study, we have computationally identified 19 distinct sugarcane miRNA precursors, of which several
are highly similar with their sorghum homologs at both nucleotide and secondary structure levels. The
accumulation pattern of mature miRNAs varies in organs/tissues from the commercial sugarcane hybrid as well as
in its corresponding founder species S. officinarum and S. spontaneum. Using sugarcane MIR827 as a query, we
found a novel MIR827 precursor in the sorghum genome. Based on our computational tool, a total of 46 potential
targets were identified for the 19 sugarcane miRNAs. Several targets for highly conserved miRNAs are transcription
factors that play important roles in plant development. Conversely, target genes of lineage-specific miRNAs seem
to play roles in diverse physiological processes, such as SsCBP1. SsCBP1 was experimentally confirmed to be a
target for the monocot-specific miR528. Our findings support the notion that the regulation of SsCBP1 by miR528 is
shared at least within graminaceous monocots, and this miRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation evolved
exclusively within the monocots lineage after the divergence from eudicots.
Conclusions: Using publicly available nucleotide databases, 19 sugarcane miRNA precursors and one new
sorghum miRNA precursor were identified and classified into 14 families. Comparative analyses between sugarcane
and sorghum suggest that these two species retain homologous miRNAs and targets in their genomes. Such
conservation may help to clarify specific aspects of miRNA regulation and evolution in the polyploid sugarcane.
Finally, our dataset provides a framework for future studies on sugarcane RNAi-dependent regulatory mechanisms.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs (1921 nt) that play crucial roles in diverse aspects of plant
development [1-3], biotic and abiotic stress responses
[4,5], signal transduction and protein degradation [6,7].
MiRNAs are generated by stepwise processing of RNA
polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent primary miRNA

transcripts (pri-miRNAs). The pri-miRNAs typically
form an imperfect fold-back structure, which is processed into a stem-loop precursor (pre-miRNA) and
further excised as an RNA duplex by the DICER-LIKE1
(DCL1) enzyme. Partial or complete base-pairing
between the miRNA and its target RNA allows the
miRNA-associated RNA-induced silencing complexes
(RISCs) to promote translational inhibition, accelerated
exonucleolytic mRNA decay, and/or mRNA cleavage
through slicing within miRNA-mRNA base-pairing (for
review, see [8]). The majority of the target genes of
highly conserved miRNAs are transcription factors that

play important roles in development [9]. Conversely,
lineage-specific miRNAs seem to regulate the expression
of a broader type of genes, including those involved in
cellular metabolism, stress response, and post-translational modifications [7,10].
The identification of miRNAs and their targets in a
large number of plant species is an important step to
understand the function and evolution of miRNAs and
miRNA-dependent gene regulation. Over 1,300 miRNAs
from eudicotyledoneous and 832 miRNAs from monocotyledonous plants have been deposited in the latest
release of miRBase (release 14.0 September 2009).
Although deep sequencing methods have substantially
contributed to the identification of conserved and lineage-specific miRNAs in model species [11], these
approaches are time-consuming and relatively expensive.
In this regard, public EST databases and genomic survey
sequences (GSSs) have become attractive alternatives to
identify non-coding sequences through computational
approaches in non-model plants.
The fact that most known miRNAs are evolutionarily
conserved raises the possibility of identifying new
miRNA homologs in other species using computer-based
strategies [12], and such in silico approaches have been
reviewed and classified not only as homology-based but
also as structure similarity-based searches [7,13]. Therefore, recent computational methods provide an accurate,
fast, inexpensive, and consequently convenient way to
retrieve miRNA precursor sequences from publicly available sequence databases. Finally, target mRNAs of conserved miRNAs can be searched using web-based [7] or
in-house algorithms and analyzed across plant species.
Most identified miRNAs and their targets have been
predicted in plants for which whole genome information
is available such as Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. Currently, there is no experimental and only scarce computational information about miRNAs and their targets in
sugarcane (Saccharum spp.). Sugarcane is an economically important biofuel crop. Recently, it has become a
target for improvement of sustainable biomaterial production due to its high biomass productivity and builtin containment features [14]. Modern sugarcane cultivars are highly polyploid, aneuploid hybrids between S.
officinarum L. (octoploid, with 2n = 80 chromosomes)
and S. spontaneum L. (ploidy level of 5-16, with 2n =
40-128 chromosomes). Modern sugarcane cultivars typically have 2n = 100-130 chromosomes, of which
approximately 15-20% are derived from S. spontaneum
and 5% are recombinants derived from both species.
Therefore, the genome of modern sugarcane cultivars
has at least 10 copies of most homo(eo)logous loci, contributing to the high complexity of its genome [15].
In this study, we used conserved miRNAs to systematically search public EST and GSS databases for

sugarcane pri-miRNAs or miRNA precursors. A total of
19 distinct sugarcane pri-miRNAs were identified by our
computational protocol, of which nine are monocot-specific. The expression profiles of selected sugarcane miRNAs were monitored by pulsed stem-loop RT-PCR [16]
in organs/tissues of a modern cultivar as well as in S.
officinarum and S. spontaneum. To identify target genes
of the identified miRNAs, we developed a BLAST-based
computational tool to search the NCBI EST and BAC
sequences of sugarcane, rice, and sorghum. By using
this method, we predicted several target messages, of
which one novel target was experimentally tested and
confirmed. Finally, we integrated sugarcane miRNA primary precursor and target information into a web-based
database (http://sysbiol.cbmeg.unicamp.br/SCmiRNA),
which is publicly available. The identification of miRNAs
and their targets is important not only to help us learn
more about the roles of miRNAs in sugarcane development and physiology, but also to provide a framework
for further studies on RNAi-based regulation mechanisms in this highly polyploid species.

Results and Discussion
Identification of miRNA primary transcripts in Saccharum
spp

MiRNAs have been intensively studied in a wide range
of plants over the past few years [8], but no systematic
and comprehensive study has been performed on sugarcane, one of the most promising biofuel crops worldwide [17]. In order to computationally identify miRNAs
in sugarcane, we developed a homology-based strategy
based on [7,13] that included the following steps: First,
we searched the sugarcane EST and GSS databases to
find sequences matching previously known plant miRNAs. Then we predicted the secondary structures of the
potential precursor sequences using MFOLD. The third
step consisted of an in-house MIRcheck-based script to
verify the putative pri-miRNA candidates (parameters
described in Methods), followed by a manual inspection
to eliminate possible false positives. Finally, closely
related EST sequences were blasted against each other
to detect redundancy and then further analyzed. We
considered as one miRNA precursor those ESTs sharing
> 95% identity at the sequence level. This protocol
allowed us to retrieve 19 distinct miRNA precursors
that were classified into 14 families (Table 1). Amongst
them, 18 miRNA precursors were found in the EST
database and a single one was found in the GSS
sequences, indicating the latter is still a poor source of
in silico miRNA discovery in sugarcane. Although previous reports have identified some sugarcane miRNA
precursors [12,13], in this study we have advanced these
findings by systematically analyzing these precursors as
well as identifying new ones. For instance, we identified

precursors for sugarcane miR827, miR528, miR1128, and
miR1432 (Table 1). Moreover, we evaluated the expression patterns of selected miRNAs in different sugarcane
tissues/organs (see next section).
The sugarcane miRNA families identified in this study
include the six families already deposited in the miRbase
(Table 1), indicating the robustness of our approach.
Nonetheless, careful inspection of the sugarcane miRNA
precursor sequences deposited in the miRbase v.14 and
comparison with our analysis revealed some divergences
between these databases. For example, the SsMIR156b/c
(Table 1) was previously annotated as a single stem-loop
MIR156 precursor (miRbase v.14). However, our analyses revealed that this precursor belongs to a cluster
representing a two-tandem microRNA precursor, which
is highly similar to its sorghum homolog (90% nt identity) and to the maize Corngrass1 microRNA (84% nt
identity) [18]. Moreover, genomic DNA PCR amplification from sugarcane hybrid RB 83-5486 using specific
primers and subsequent sequencing indicate that
SsMIR156b/c locus encodes tandem MIR156 genes (data
not shown). Comparison among the miRbase-derived
precursor sequences and with those identified in this

study suggests that the 16 previously annotated
sugarcane miRNA precursors represent only eight different precursors (Table 1). For instance, we identified only
two distinct precursors of miR408, SsMIR408a and
SsMIR408b (Table 1), instead of five (miRbase v.14).
Closer inspection suggests that SsMIR408a and
SsMIR408b are likely different alleles of the same locus.
This observation is supported by the fact that MIR408
genes have been found only as one copy in all plant
genomes evaluated to date (miRbase v.14). The discrepancies between our data and previous annotation in
the miRbase may be due to the use of SoGI Release 2.2
(July, 2008) that contains substantially more Tentative
Consensus (TCs) than the earlier releases, which likely
reflect differences in EST clustering or assembling.
In agreement with previous results [7,10], most sugarcane miRNA sequences have uracil as their first nucleotide (13 out of 19 mature sugarcane miRNAs; Table 1).
Moreover, sugarcane miRNA precursors displayed high
minimal free energy index (MFEI) values (average 1.02
± 0.22), which is a criterion used for distinguishing
miRNA precursors from other types of RNAs. MFEI is a
parameter that considers not only the minimal free

Zanca et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:260
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/260

energy (MFE) value of a particular sequence but also its
length and G+C content. MFEI values were calculated
as described by [19].
MiRNAs are located either in the 5’-arm or 3’-arm of the
stem-loop hairpin pre-miRNA sequences (Table 1). All
new identified miRNA precursors could fold into stemloop structures (see additional file 1), following the rules
and parameters reported by [7]. One exception was the
EST TC87836, which displays high similarity (e-value 0.0
and 89.5% nt identity) with one of the MIR319 precursors
present in the draft of the Sorghum bicolor genome [20]
(see additional file 2). It could not form a suitable stemloop structure and thus it was not validated by our inhouse MIRcheck-based script. This might be due to the
fact that the miR319* is located at the 5’end of the
sequence, which is not present in the TC87836 sugarcane
EST. Nevertheless, based on its extensive homology with
sorghum MIR319 precursor (see additional file 2), we
annotated this TC as a potential SsMIR319 precursor
(Table 1). That most ESTs do not contain their entire 5’end sequence information undermines EST databases as
sources for miRNA precursor searching. Based on the
example given in this study, it may be interesting to
develop rules and parameters to assign EST sequences as
miRNA precursors based only upon extensive nucleotide
identity with precursors from highly closely related species.
Not only SsMIR319, but several sugarcane pre-miRNAs show high sequence similarity with their sorghum
homologs (values between 86% and 94% nt identity).
Sorghum and sugarcane are each other’s closest relatives
among cultivated crops. They belong to the Andropogoneae tribe and diverged from a common ancestor
around 8-9 Myr ago [15]. Based on genomic sequence
comparisons [15,20], it is likely that sugarcane and sorghum did not have sufficient time to diverge, which
reflects the high degree of identity observed between
their miRNA precursors.
This feature allowed us, by using sugarcane MIR827
pre-miRNA sequence, to identify the sorghum MIR827
precursor (Figure 1), which was not annotated in previous work [20]. Sorghum MIR827 precursor is located
at chromosome 4 (position 50273627 to 50273779). The
mature miR827 is highly conserved among grasses and
displays few mismatches with sequences from Arabidopsis and Populus (Figure 1A; [21]). The new sorghum
miRNA precursor was validated by our in-house MIRcheck-based script and it showed high similarity with its
sugarcane homolog not only at the sequence level, but
also at a secondary structure level (Figure 1B).
Among the monocot-specific miRNA precursors, we
have identified three potential precursors of microRNA444 (Table 1). Interestingly, SsMIR444b and
SsMIR444c contain tandem and overlapping mature
miRNA sequences (additional file 1), similar to MIR444

Page 4 of 13

precursors identified in rice and sorghum [20,22]. At
least in rice, such precursors are able to generate natural
antisense miRNAs, or nat-miRNAs. The production of
nat-miRNAs depends upon sense/antisense transcription
and alternative splicing of the precursors prior to DCL1
cleavage [22]. These nat-miRNAs seem to be restricted
to monocot graminae, indicating this new pathway is
less than 50 million years old.
Recent works suggest that some plant and human
miRNA families are derived from a subset of DNA-type
transposable elements (TEs) called miniature invertedrepeat transposable elements (MITEs; [23,24]). MITEs
evolved from corresponding ancestral full-length (autonomous) elements that originally encoded short interfering
RNAs (siRNAs). Piriyapongsa and Jordan [24] found several examples in rice and Arabidopsis supporting the
notion that evolutionary intermediates may exist as TEs
that encode both siRNAs and miRNAs. Moreover, Voinnet
[8] suggests an association of recently evolved miRNA
families with MITEs. Thus, we compared the identified
sugarcane pri-miRNA sequences against the Gramineae
Repeat database (http://plantrepeats.plantbiology.msu.edu/
gramineae.html) using BLASTN (e-value <e-10) to identify
possible MITE-derived hairpin precursors. Only miR1128
and all three miR437 precursors presented substantial similarity with known MITEs (Table 1). Accordingly, their
maize homologs also have similarity with MITE-derived
hairpin sequences [25]. It has been shown in Arabidopsis
that miRNA genes evolved via local inverted duplication
events, which generated sequences capable of folding back
into hairpin structures when expressed [26]. Similarly, over
the course of evolution, MITEs might have stimulated the
RNAi biogenesis enzymes to process hairpin-like structures
to generate miRNAs with endogenous gene regulatory
functions [24]. We were able to detect mature miR1128 by
RT-PCR - as shown in the next section - and sequencing
of the generated amplicon confirmed its identity (data not
shown). Moreover, multiple sequence alignment of premiR1128 from sugarcane, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum)
and wheat (Triticum aestivum) [27,28] suggests partial
conservation of the miR1128 and miR1128* among these
species, but not the surrounding precursor sequences
(Figure 2). Along with other requirements [7,8], the conservation of the miRNA and miRNA* sequences in the precursor is a critical parameter to define a miRNA-generating
locus. Taken together, our data support the miRNA status
of the sugarcane miR1128. However, we cannot rule out
the possibility that MITE-associated miRNAs may lose
their miRNA status in the future [25].
Given the limited number of sugarcane EST and GSS
sequences available as well as existent sequencing errors,
the frequency of candidate miRNA precursors identified
in this study is comparable to others using such databases [29,30]. It is noteworthy that all miRNAs reported

in this study have been identified using previously
known miRNAs from several plant species. Therefore,
we did not uncover miRNAs that are specific to sugarcane. Further investigations that employ small RNA
libraries combined with computational approaches are
needed to identify sugarcane-specific miRNAs.
Expression patterns of sugarcane miRNAs

The expression pattern of a miRNA in organs/tissues
might provide initial clues regarding its biological function. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of selected

miRNAs identified in this work (Table 1). We have
chosen one miRNA poorly conserved (miR408), one
highly conserved among plant species (miR156), and
four potential monocot-specific miRNAs (miR444,
miR528, miR1128, and miR1432). In this study, stemloop RT-PCR approach was applied to detect mature
miRNA species in distinct organs/tissues from the commercial sugarcane hybrid RB 83-5486. The miRNAs
were detected in all organs/tissues analyzed, although
with distinct expression profiles (Figure 3A). Transcripts
of miR408 accumulate at high levels in all organs/tissues

but lateral buds, while miR156 accumulates at higher
levels only in leaf blade tissues. Sugarcane miR444 and
miR1128 seem to be similarly expressed in the organs/
tissues evaluated (Figure 3A). miR1432 mature transcripts accumulate at higher levels in leaf sheath and lateral buds, whereas miR528 transcripts were detected at

Page 6 of 13

lower levels in lateral buds. It is noteworthy that all
tested SsmiRNAs, though at variable levels, are
expressed in lateral buds (Figure 3A). Sugarcane is typically propagated via rhizomes, which contain one or
more lateral buds. The new plantlet will arise from
these buds and further develop into mature plants
(http://sugarcanecrops.com). Therefore, efficient bud
outgrowth is an extremely important step for the initial
development of sugarcane. It is possible that some of
these miRNAs play important roles in the genetic regulation of sugarcane lateral bud outgrowth. Functional
studies may provide clues on the possible roles of these
miRNAs in the early development of sugarcane.
We also compared the expression profiles of these
miRNAs between S. officinarum and S. spontaneum to
evaluate whether both species produce detectable
mature miRNA molecules. All miRNAs are detected in
the evaluated organs/tissues from these two closely
related species (Figure 3B). Although most miRNAs
seem to accumulate similarly in both species, some

presented variations in abundance when comparing the
same organs/tissues at similar developmental stages of S.
officinarum and S. spontaneum. For example, miR444 is
slightly more abundant in vegetative apex of S. officinarum. In contrast, miR408 accumulates at higher levels
in leaf blade tissues of S. spontaneum (Figure 3B). Similar data was observed for miRNAs accumulating in
some organs/tissues of stable Arabidopsis allopolyploids
[31]. The relatively low variation in miRNA accumulation between these species is likely a reflection of their
level of ploidy. Highly polyploid species might have
developed a genetic buffering against extensive miRNA
expression variation in particular organs/tissues or
developmental stages to maintain target gene expression
stability across generations of ploidy [31]. Our data also
present the possibility that both ancient species contributed similarly to the miRNA-based regulatory pathways
present in modern sugarcane hybrids. It will be interesting to test whether all target loci in hybrid modern cultivars are down-regulated by miRNAs from one ancient
progenitor or from both.
The final spatiotemporal accumulation of mature small
RNAs relies, at least in part, upon the transcriptional
control of MICRORNA (MIR) genes [32] and such regulation may be conserved among closely related species.
To gain more insight into the transcriptional regulation
of the sugarcane MIR genes, we analyzed in silico the
SsMIR1432 locus, which has available genomic sequences
(Table 1). Firstly, we employed eShadow software [33] to
search for evolutionary conserved regions in MIR1432
locus from sugarcane, sorghum, and maize. We detected
several potentially conserved regions, of which most are
localized upstream of the predicted pre-miRNA and
one highly conserved region includes the pre-miR1432
(Figure 4). Secondly, we scanned for putative conserved
transcription factor binding (TFB) sites as well as for
tandem repeats and CpG/CpNpG islands using JASPAR
(http://jaspar.cgb.ki.se) and PlantPAN [34] databases,
respectively. CpG/CpNpG islands are regions of the genome typically associated with promoters and 5’ ends of
several genes. Hypo or hypermethylation of CpG/CpNpG
islands in plants are of considerable interest because they
relate to patterns of gene regulation, epigenetic phenomena, and chromosome structure [35].
Although we did not detect any tandem repeats, the
CpG/CpNpG islands found in the three MIR1432 loci
overlap broadly with the possibly conserved regions
upstream of pre-miR1432. These regions also included
common predicted TFB sites for the investigated species,
such as an auxin response element (AuxRE) (Figure 4).
Taken together, these findings suggest the promoter
regions of the sugarcane MIR1432 locus share conserved
elements with its sorghum and maize homologs. Such

organ/tissue localization of miR1432 mature species and,
consequently, for target down-regulation. It has recently
been reported an evolutionary sequencing comparison
for the MIR319a locus in Arabidopsis and related Brassicaceae. Reporter experiments have demonstrated that
regions under stronger evolutionary constraints contain
important information for MIR319a transcription [36].
As more sugarcane genomic sequences become available,
it will be interesting to verify whether most, if not all
homologous miRNAs between sorghum and sugarcane
also share conserved elements in their promoters.
Potential targets of sugarcane miRNAs

Previous studies demonstrated that miRNAs regulate
gene expression mainly by binding to perfect or near-perfect complementary sites of mRNA sequences [37-39].
Such behavior indicates that plant miRNA targets can be
predicted by simple sequence homology-based searches.
Using an in-house BLASTn-based algorithm (described
in Methods), we identified a total of 46 potential distinct
target sequences for the 14 identified sugarcane miRNA
families. Consistent with the essential roles of miRNAs in
regulating a variety of biological processes in plants [8],
sugarcane target genes seem to be associated not only
with development but also with diverse physiological processes (Table 2). Because NCBI sugarcane EST database
is limited and its corresponding proteins have not yet
been fully annotated, we have additionally applied the
same search for rice and sorghum protein-coding
sequences. Most sugarcane miRNA targets identified
here have homologs in rice and sorghum (Table 2).
Although it is unlikely that true targets have been missed
in our search, it is important to mention that BLASTbased search strategies have limitations to detect some
targets even if a word size of seven is used. One such
example of this are the miRNAs miR395b, miR395c, and
miR395f targeting APS1 (At3g22890) and APS3
(At4g14680) genes within Arabidopsis [40]. The longest
stretch of matching base pairs is six, which falls under
the minimum word size employed by BLAST [40].
Interestingly, some target genes that are conserved
across angiosperms seem to have lost their miRNAbased regulation in specific lineages [41]. One such
example seems to be the new targets for the possible
monocot-specific miR528 (Table 2). The three identified
ESTs encode Cu2+-binding domain-containing proteins
(referred to hereafter as SsCBPs; Saccharum spp. Cu2
+
-binding domain-containing proteins). To evaluate the
relationship between this lineage-specific miRNA and its
angiosperm-conserved targets, we initially investigated
the accumulation of mature miR528 transcripts in distinct monocots and in the core eudicot Arabidopsis. As
expected, miR528 transcripts were detected in all graminaceous monocots but not in Arabidopsis (Figure 5A).

The red branches show the monocot group of CBP genes containing the predict target site for miR528. This monocot group of genes belongs
to a possible group of angiosperm orthologs (PoGO A). None of the eudicot sequences within this PoGO contain miR528 predicted target site.
The 10 most closely related sequences out of PoGO A were included in this analysis. Only bootstraps values higher than 50% are shown for
1000 replicates. Sequence references are given in Methods.

Although targets for the miR528 have been recently predicted in maize [42], no experimental validation has
been done to confirm such predictions. Thus, we used
the RLM-RACE method to map the cleavage sites in
one of the predicted SsCBPs(SsCBP1, TC90826). As
expected, most 5’-ends of the SsCBP1 mRNA fragments
were mapped to the nucleotide that pairs to the tenth
nucleotide of the microRNA, confirming its cleavage
guided by miR528 (Figure 5B).
To gain more insight into the evolutionary history of
the CBPs, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using
SsCBP1 sequence as a query to search for homologous
proteins within genomic and EST databanks of a set of
green plants, including angiosperms, basal land plants,
and green algae (Viridiplantae 1.0; see Methods). Our
analysis revealed that SsCBP1 belongs to a Possible
Group of Orthologous (PoGO A; for a definition and
criteria for PoGO, see [43]) that integrates only angiosperm sequences (Figure 5C). The simplest explanation is
that these genes share a common origin within the last
common ancestor of angiosperms. Interestingly, the
miR528-target recognition site is only present within
monocot genes from PoGO A (data not shown). All
eudicots orthologous to SsCBP1 from Arabidopsis,
poplar, grape, and soybean genomes completely lack the
miR528-target recognition site, suggesting that miR528
is indeed a monocot-specific microRNA. Taken
together, our findings support the notion that the regulation of SsCBP1 by miR528 is shared at least within
graminaceous monocots, and this miRNA-based posttranscriptional regulation evolved exclusively within the
monocots lineage after the divergence from eudicots.
Further studies on plant CBPs are needed to define
their physiological role(s) and the possible evolutionary
advantages given by the miR528-based post-transcriptional regulation of monocot SsCBP1 orthologs.

Conclusions
Our findings indicate that several sugarcane miRNA
precursors share high homology with their sorghum’s
possible orthologous beyond miRNA mature sequence.
In the case of pre-miR1432, which was obtained from
genomic sequences, we found precursor-surrounding
regions conserved among sugarcane, sorghum, and
maize homologs. This finding indicates these genes may
share common genetic and epigenetic regulatory programs. However, further work that includes additional
homologous sequences from other closely related species is required to confirm such conservation. Our data
also indicate that sugarcane miRNAs are expressed in
commercial hybrids as well as in the ancient progenitors
S. officinarum and S. spontaneum. Our approach leads
to the prediction of several conserved and nonconserved sugarcane miRNA targets in the available

Page 10 of 13

EST and genomic databases. The data is available in the
public website (http://sysbiol.cbmeg.unicamp.br/
SCmiRNA) that will be continuously updated to incorporate future miRBase updates. Our findings will be a
useful resource toward tracing the evolution of small
RNA-based regulation in sugarcane and related species.
Most importantly, this study will serve as a foundation
for future research into the functional roles of miRNAs
and their target genes in this important biofuel crop.

Methods
Plant material and RNA extraction

Leaf blade and sheath tissues were collected from threeweek-old sugarcane seedlings (hybrid RB 83-5486) grown
in greenhouse conditions. Mature six-month-old plants of
the same hybrid were used to obtain lateral buds and leaf
roll (apical meristem plus leaf primordia) tissues. We also
collected tissues from Saccharum officinarum (accession
Muntok, Java) and S. spontaneum (accession SES205A).
Five-month-old plantlets cultivated in vitro were transferred to greenhouse conditions. After one month, leaf
blade and vegetative apex tissues (pool of four plantlets)
were harvested from both species. Tissues were also collected from whole three-week-old seedlings of sugarcane
hybrid (RB83-5486) and Sorghum bicolor (BTx623), fourweek-old seedlings of Zea mays, one-month-old plantlets
of Oryza sativa (ssp. japonica cv Nipponbare), and from
one-month-old plantlets of Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia). Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Stem-loop reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR

Stem-loop RT and PCR primers for sugarcane miR408,
miR156, miR444, miR528, miR1128, and miR1432 were
designed according to [16] (see Additional file 3). Total
RNA was treated with DNAse I (Promega) to eliminate
any residue of genomic DNA. Six-hundred nanograms
of DNAse-treated RNA were used to generate the first
strand cDNA [16]. Oligo(dT) primer was added to the
reaction for further normalization with the endogenous
control gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; [44]). The reaction mixture was placed at
GeneAmp9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) and
incubated at 16°C for 30 minutes, followed by 60 cycles
of pulsed reverse transcription at 30°C for 30 seconds,
42°C for 30 seconds, and 50°C for one second.
cDNA dilutions were used for PCR reactions as following: 1.0 μL of cDNA, 1.5 mM Magnesium Sulfate, 0.25
mM each dNTP, 10 pmol each primer, and 1 U of Taq
DNA Polymerase (Fermentas). The reactions were placed
in the thermocycler with the following conditions: 94°C
for two minutes and appropriate cycle numbers of 94°C
for 20 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 45 seconds. All reactions were repeated at least three times.

Genomic PCR

Prior use of SsGAPDH (accession TC77224) as a control
to evaluate miRNA accumulation in sugarcane ancient
wild species, the efficiency of its primers was tested in
genomic DNA from leaves of S. officinarum (accession
Muntok, Java) and S. spontaneum (accession SES205A;
see additional file 4). Thirty nanograms of genomic
DNA were used as a template for PCR reactions. The
reactions were placed in the thermocycler with the following conditions: 94°C for three minutes and 32 cycles
of 94°C for 20 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C
for 45 seconds. The reactions were repeated twice.
Analysis of 5’RACE

Five micrograms of total RNA from sugarcane plantlets
(hybrid RB 83-5486) were ligated to a RNA adapter, in a
reaction mixture containing 0.5 U/μL of T4 RNA Ligase, 4
U/μL RNAse inhibitor, and 1 mM ATP. The subsequent
steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s
guide of the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). The first PCR was
done using the following SsCBP1 specific primer: 5’GAAAGCCCTCTCCGCCAGC. The PCR reaction was
subsequently used as a template for a semi-NESTED PCR
with an internal SsCBP1 specific primer (5’-GCGCCG
TCGCCGCACCC). After amplification, 5’RACE products
were gel-purified and cloned, and at least 13 independent
clones were randomly chosen and sequenced.
Sugarcane miRNA precursor identification

Sugarcane ESTs and GSSs were retrieved from The
Gene Index Program (116,588 unique sequences; Release
2.2, July 2008) and NCBI, respectively. The sequences
were used as drivers for a BLASTX search (e-value e-10)
against the NCBI protein sequence database (September
2008). All potential no hit sequences were recorded as a
distinct dataset. Recorded miRNAs from plants were
obtained from the miRBase (over 2,300 miRNA
sequences; Release 14.0) [45] and used as drivers for
BLASTN search of sugarcane miRNA precursors in the
aforementioned dataset, similarly as described by Zhang
et al.[13]. We allowed 0-3 nt mismatches or gaps
between drivers and database sequences. The BLASTN
parameters were adjusted to expected values of 1000
and number of descriptions and alignments of 1000.
The default word-match size between the query and the
database sequences was seven with a low complexity filtering ability. We also employed BLAST searches to
remove sugarcane sequences similar to tRNAs, ncRNAs
(http://biobases.ibch.poznan.pl/ncRNA), snoRNAs
(http://bioinf.scri.sari.ac.uk/cgi-bin/plant_snorna/home)
or other RNAs found in the Rfam database [46].
Wherever available, precursor sequences of approximately 620 nt were extracted (300 nt upstream of and
300 nt downstream from the BLAST hits) and used for

Page 11 of 13

hairpin structure predictions using MFOLD3.2 algorithm
[47]. Number of structures, free energy, miRNA-like helicity, number of arms per structure, size of helices within
arms, and size/symmetry of internal loops within arms
were analyzed by our in-house MIRcheck-based script
[37], following manual inspection. RNA sequences were
considered miRNA precursor candidates only if they
fitted the following criteria: (1) the RNA sequence could
fold into an appropriate stem-loop hairpin secondary
structure; (2) mature miRNA site was located in one arm
of the hairpin structure; (3) the mature miRNA sequence
was located in the same arm of the hairpin as its homolog
in other plant species; (4) mature miRNA had six or
fewer, and one or more, mismatches with the miRNA*
sequence in the opposite arm; (5) no break in miRNA*
sequences; (6) predicted secondary structures had MFEI
values higher than 0.65 [12,19], negative MFEs, and 3070% G + C contents; (7) two base pairs of maximum consecutive mismatches between miRNA and miRNA*; (8) a
minimum of two bases pairing after the alignment
between the predicted miRNA sequence and its opposite
miRNA* sequence within the secondary structure; (9)
and a final stem loop with a minimum of 60 nt.
Predicting sugarcane miRNA targets

Sugarcane miRNA mature sequences were used to
BLAST search for possible gene targets present in the
SoGI database and available BAC sequences. To minimize the number of false positives, 21-nt miRNA
sequences were initially divided into three blocks of eight
(block 1), three (block 2), and 10 bp (block 3). The maximum mismatches permitted in each block for the
mRNA:miRNA duplex were two, zero, and three, respectively. To more thoroughly assess the mRNA::miRNA
potential pairing, we additionally developed a more sensitive computational approach to identify target candidates.
Each miRNA complementary site was scored, with perfect matches given a score of zero. Points were added for
each G:U bulge (0.5), non-G:U mismatch (one), and
bulged nucleotide in the miRNA or target strand (1.5).
Only SoGI/BAC sequences that scored ≤3.5 points were
further considered as potential miRNA targets. Closely
related sequences were blasted against each other and
analyzed. Sequences sharing ≥95% of identity at nucleotide level were considered as one gene target.
SsCBP1 comparative sequence analysis

Comparative analysis of sugarcane SsCBP1’s possible
orthologous in green plants was done by constructing a
phylogenetic tree containing highly similar plant
sequences. A BLASTX search was performed using
SsCBP1 as query against a green plant protein dataset of
365,187 protein sequences obtained from several completed genomes (Arabidopsis thaliana, version 7.0 - http://

found among protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW [48] to produce ungapped alignments. The phylogenetic relationship of these aligned sequences was then
constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA4 software [49].
This process allowed identifying the most probable orthologous sequences of the SsCBP1. EST sequences from barley, wheat, and sugarcane were obtained from “TIGR Plant
Transcript Assemblies Database” [50], and cDNA
sequences from maize were obtained from MAGI (http://
