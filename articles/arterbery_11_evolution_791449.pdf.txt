corticosteroid receptors

Abstract
Background: Corticosteroid receptors include mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors. Teleost
fishes have a single MR and duplicate GRs that show variable sensitivities to mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids.
How these receptors compare functionally to tetrapod MR and GR, and the evolutionary significance of
maintaining two GRs, remains unclear.
Results: We used up to seven steroids (including aldosterone, cortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone [DOC]) to
compare the ligand specificity of the ligand binding domains of corticosteroid receptors between a mammal (Mus
musculus) and the midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus), a teleost model for steroid regulation of neural and
behavioral plasticity. Variation in mineralocorticoid sensitivity was considered in a broader phylogenetic context by
examining the aldosterone sensitivity of MR and GRs from the distantly related daffodil cichlid (Neolamprologus
pulcher), another teleost model for neurobehavioral plasticity. Both teleost species had a single MR and duplicate
GRs. All MRs were sensitive to DOC, consistent with the hypothesis that DOC was the initial ligand of the ancestral
MR. Variation in GR steroid-specificity corresponds to nine identified amino acid residue substitutions rather than
phylogenetic relationships based on receptor sequences.
Conclusion: The mineralocorticoid sensitivity of duplicate GRs in teleosts is highly labile in the context of their
evolutionary phylogeny, a property that likely led to neo-functionalization and maintenance of two GRs.

Background
The nuclear receptor super-family of proteins includes
steroid receptors that are ligand-activated transcription
factors mediating steroid actions on a multitude of behavioral, morphological and physiological processes [1].
The two major functional groups of vertebrate corticosteroid receptors are glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors distinguished by their amino
acid sequences and ligand specificity. Jawless vertebrates
(hagfish and lamprey) have a single corticosteroid receptor, while jawed cartilaginous and bony fishes possess
GRs and MRs [2,3]. Bony fishes fall into two main clades:
lobe-finned that includes tetrapods and ray-finned that
includes teleosts, the most species-rich group of vertebrates [4]. Functional relationships between the GRs and

MRs of tetrapods and teleosts remain somewhat uncertain due, in part, to a lack of consensus as to the bioactive
mineralocorticoid ligand and the presence of two GRs in
some teleosts. Here, we compare the ligand specificity of
GR and MR ligand binding domains (LBD) between
mammals and teleosts, presenting new evidence to support the hypothesis that neo-functionalization likely
facilitated the maintenance of duplicate GRs in teleosts
following an initial duplication event with the origin of
bony fishes. Focusing on the LBD allowed us to compare
variation in ligand binding without the confounding
effects of variation in other domains, such as the DNA
binding domain (DBD) and N-terminal region that can
alter transactivational activity [5].
Among most mammals, including humans, cortisol is
the principal glucocorticoid that induces the transcriptional activities of both the GR and MR [1]. The mineralocorticoid aldosterone also activates MR, but not GR
[1,6]. Like mammals, cortisol is the major glucocorticoid
among teleosts [1]. However, unlike mammals, there is

no convincing evidence for significant circulating levels
of aldosterone among teleosts [7-9]; the aldosterone precursor 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) is a prominent
candidate for the dominant mineralocorticoid in teleosts
[10]. Most teleosts have two GRs [11-13], with some
being cortisol-specific and others activated in vitro by
both aldosterone and cortisol in some species [12]. The
existence of teleost GRs with aldosterone sensitivity, but
where cortisol may be the predominant ligand in the
absence of aldosterone, has prompted investigations like
the current one into the functional and evolutionary relationships of corticosteroid receptors and the ligands that
induce their transcriptional activation.
To rigorously investigate the functional diversity of corticosteroid receptors, we compared the dose-dependent
ligand sensitivity of the LBD of MRs and GRs between a
teleost, the midshipman (Porichthys notatus) [4], and a
mammal, the mouse (Mus musculus). Midshipman fish
are a key model for steroid modulation of reproductive
behavior at multiple levels of analysis ranging from behavioral and molecular neuroendocrinology to neurophysiology [14,15]. Inclusion of the midshipman, from which a
partial GR (GR1) and partial MR sequences have been
published [16], and for which we report a second GR
(GR2) here, also provided us the opportunity to compare
ligand specificities of MRs and GRs between distantly
related teleosts using a single assay. To this end, we examined aldosterone and cortisol activation of MR, GR1, and
GR2 from a cichlid (Neolamprologous pulcher). Cichlids
are a representative of the largest order of teleosts (Perciformes) [4], have duplicate GRs [12], and are another teleost model for the behavioral neuroendocrinology of
reproductive plasticity [17-19].
Since multiple domains of steroid receptor gene products can influence transcriptional activity [20-23], we
cloned the LBD of each receptor in frame with the DNA
binding domain (DBD) of the yeast transcription factor
GAL4. We employed a GAL4-UAS promoter to control
expression of a luciferase reporter gene, similar to previous studies in heterologous cell systems [2,24,25], as
well as in vivo [26]. This system allowed us to focus on
variation in ligand binding independent of variation in
other properties of the receptor [See: [27]]. Using a battery of up to seven steroids, we show differences in the
LBD specificity of duplicate teleost GRs, as well as the
GRs between teleosts and mammals. When viewed
broadly in the context of a phylogenetic analysis of corticosteroid receptors, the results suggest that duplicate
GRs among teleosts exhibit an evolutionarily labile pattern of ligand binding that is unique among the major
vertebrate lineages with one glucocorticoid-specific GR
and another GR with more general corticosteroid sensitivity, similar to the ancestral vertebrate MR.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of corticosteroid receptors

To more completely characterize the evolutionary relationships between the corticosteroid receptors of our
main study species and other vertebrates, we first cloned
and sequenced the full LBD with the hinge region and a
short portion of the DBDs of midshipman MR (GenBank
no. GU384923.1) and GR2 (GenBank no. HM164445).
The resulting sequences were aligned with multiple corticosteroid receptors to verify the identity and similarity of
the cloned genes with their homologs from other species.
The cloned regions of the corticosteroid receptors
included the entire coding region for the LBD, hinge
region, and a few amino acids of the DBD sequence.
A phylogram of corticosteroid receptor sequences had
100% posterior probabilities at each node (Figure 1). Due
to a discrepancy between the names and the phylogenetic
relationship of Burton’s cichlid GR1 and GR2 relative to
other teleosts [11,28], a recent report renamed their GRs
[29]. We utilized this more recent and phylogenetically
consistent naming system. As suggested previously
[2,11,28,30], the results indicated that the ancestral corticosteroid receptor (represented by hagfish and lamprey
CR) underwent a duplication event giving rise to GR and
MR prior to the divergence of cartilaginous (represented
here by skate) and bony fishes that includes sarcopterygians/lobe-finned fish that gave rise to tetrapods (represented here by mouse). A second duplication event
resulted in GR1 and GR2 within the second major clade
of bony fish, the actinopterygian/ray-finned fishes (represented by trout, cichlids and midshipman).
Ligand specificity

Using a heterologous expression system, we tested the
activity of corticosteroid receptor homologues induced
by a variety of steroid hormones found among vertebrates. To do this we first confirmed expression of the
full-length LBD-GAL4 fusion products from the plasmid
constructs by Western blotting, which showed bands of
the expected sizes for each of the constructs (data not
shown). As an initial screen for ligand specificity and efficacy of the expression system, we measured the luciferase
activity produced by cells co-transfected with each of the
LBD-GAL4 constructs and the luciferase reporter construct in response to hormone treatments at one concentration, 10-7 M. Normalized values were expressed as fold
change over vehicle (ethanol) treatment (Figure 2).
Significant ligand induced activities were observed for all
the receptor LBDs examined. The MR constructs from
both midshipman and mouse showed significant activation in response to 10-7 M concentrations of aldosterone
and cortisol (Figures 2A, and 2B). The cortisol precursor
11-deoxycortisol (Reichstein’s compound S) also

Figure 1 Phylogram of the evolutionary relationship of corticosteroid receptors based on DNA sequence identity. In addition to the
receptors examined in this study (mouse, Mus musculus; midshipman fish, Porichthys notatus; daffodil cichlid, Neolamprologous pulcher), we
included GRs and MRs from another cichlid (Burton’s cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni); a cartilaginous fish, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea); and
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) which have all been used in similar transactivational studies [2,12,13,25]. The Burton’s cichlid GRs are named
according to a revised nomenclature [29]. Also included are the general corticosteroid receptor of a hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) and lamprey
(Petromyzon marinus) that are evolutionarily basal to the radiation of GRs and MRs. The superscripts ‘A’ and ‘C’ indicate sensitivity to aldosterone
and cortisol at ≤ 10-7 M based on our results and previous studies. *Aldosterone sensitivities of Burton’s cichlid GR1 and rainbow trout GR2 are
somewhat unclear [2,12,13].

produced activity significantly above baseline (Figures 2A
and 2B). Mouse GR LBD was sensitive only to cortisol
and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone but not
to the mineralocorticoid aldosterone (Figure 2C), consistent with previous results from rats [2]. Midshipman
GR1 (Figure 2D) behaved similar to mouse GR, with significant activity induced only by cortisol and dexamethasone. Midshipman GR2 was also activated by cortisol and
dexamethasone, but like mouse and midshipman MRs
showed significant activity in response to 10 -7 M of
aldosterone (Figure 2E).
The results of this initial screening demonstrated that:
(1) the LBDs were sufficient to confer ligand specificity,
(2) the GRs showed strong specificity for cortisol over
its upstream and downstream biosynthetic products 11deoxycortisol and cortisone (Reichstein’s compound E,

Figure 2), and (3) aldosterone sensitivity was variable
among the GRs, found only for GR2.
Ligand sensitivity

To rigorously characterize the ligand sensitivity of the
receptors, we performed dose response experiments with
the LBD constructs from the MRs and GRs of the mouse
and midshipman using cortisol, DOC and aldosterone as
well as dexamethasone for the GRs (Figures 3). As noted
earlier, DOC was included because it has been suggested
that this steroid, a precursor to aldosterone in tetrapods,
may function as an important agonist of MRs in teleost
fish that lack aldosterone [1,2,10].
We estimated EC50 values (see Table 1) from the logistic
dose response curves shown in Figure 3. For several of the
responses here, such as midshipman MR with cortisol,

receptor activation initially increased and then decreased
with increasing ligand doses, a trend previously observed
in corticosteroid receptors [e.g., [12,31]]. This may be indicative of cytotoxicity at high steroid doses [32]. This
reduced activity at higher doses leads to underestimated
upper bounds in the fitted logistic curves that, in turn,

yield underestimates of the corresponding EC50 values. To
counter this effect when performing our logistic fits, we
excluded doses at which the observed activity decreased
relative to lower doses (Table 1, Figure 3).
As in the initial screen, MR LBDs were sensitive to
both aldosterone and cortisol (Figures 3A and 3B). The

estimates impossible (Figure 3E, Table 1). None of the
LBD constructs were activated by either cortisone or
11-KT (Figure 2), indicating that the low sensitivity of
the GR2 construct to aldosterone and DOC did not
reflect this artificial construct’s overall lack of specificity.
Rather, this likely reflected true mineralocorticoid sensitivity of midshipman GR2.
GAL4-LBD assays, like those used here and in other
studies [2,25,34], allowed us to assess variation in LBD
activation, while eliminating differences in activity that
may result from variation in the N-terminal A/B
domains or DBDs [5]. Though the remainder of the
receptor may modify ligand responses, our results using
GAL4-LBD constructs likely reflected the activity of the
full-length receptor (e.g., the sensitivity of the midshipman MR was similar to that for full-length MRs of
other teleosts [10,12]).

EC50 of cortisol was an order of magnitude higher than
that of aldosterone for the mouse MR, while the EC50s
for aldosterone and cortisol were approximately the
same as for midshipman MR (Table 1). However, the
maximum fold activation induced by aldosterone was
nearly twice that induced by cortisol for midshipman
MR (Figures 3A and 3B). Therefore, while the EC50s of
cortisol and aldosterone did not differ substantially, the
level of activity induced at the EC50 was much higher
with aldosterone. DOC also induced activity of both
mouse and midshipman MR constructs. The dose
response curve for DOC in midshipman was very similar
to that of cortisol (Figure 3B). DOC did not activate
mouse MR to the same maximal level as either aldosterone or cortisol and the EC50 of DOC, like that of cortisol, was approximately an order of magnitude higher
than that of aldosterone.
The GR LBD constructs were most sensitive to dexamethasone (Figures 3C, D and 3E; Table 1), as reported
previously for full length GRs [11,13,33]. This high dexamethasone sensitivity was evident in both the maximum observed activation as well as the EC50 values. For
all GRs, the EC 50 for cortisol was approximately an
order of magnitude, or more, greater than that of dexamethasone. The response to cortisol was fairly similar
across GRs, with a somewhat lower EC50 for mouse GR
than either midshipman GRs.
The largest distinction between the GR constructs was
in the activation by aldosterone and DOC. While mouse
GR was not activated by aldosterone in our initial screen
using 107 M aldosterone (Figure 2A), 106 M aldosterone
caused substantial activation (Figure 3C) as seen previously for rat GR [2]. DOC, however, failed to activate
this receptor at any concentration. The midshipman
GR1 construct showed no response to either aldosterone
or DOC at any of the doses examined (Figure 3D). In
contrast to midshipman GR1, midshipman GR2 was
sensitive to both aldosterone and DOC (Figure 3E).
Neither of these ligands induced the levels of response
in GR2 that we observed with either dexamethasone or
cortisol. The sensitivity of the GR2 construct to low
doses of aldosterone and DOC made accurate EC 50

Amino acid substitutions and GR ligand specificity

Activation of the duplicate GRs by DOC and/or aldosterone was not consistent with the phylogenetic relationships of the receptors (Figure 1, Table 2). For
example, the aldosterone sensitivity of GR1 and of GR2
varied between cichlid species (Figure 1). This suggested
that mineralocorticoid sensitivity was evolutionarily plastic and may have resulted from a small number of
amino acid substitutions in the GRs rather than overall
sequence homology. Strong candidates for amino acids
regulating mineralocorticoid sensitivity are those that
are conserved between GRs with similar mineralocorticoid sensitivities, but not between GRs with differing
sensitivities, independent of phylogeny. We compared
the mineralocorticoid-sensitive GR LBD sequences from
Burton’s cichlid GR2 and midshipman GR2 with the
mineralocorticoid-insensitive rainbow trout GR1 and
midshipman GR1 (mineralocorticoid insensitive and
sensitive indicated by green and blue, respectively, in
Figure 4). Nine amino acids were conserved within,
but not between, these groups (A/S15, R/Q38, A/S49,
H/Y129, S/T161, H/Q195, S/Q203, F/I204 and A/D235;
Figure 4).
To test the role of the nine candidate amino acids on
GR mineralocorticoid sensitivity, we performed transactivation assays using GAL4 constructs of daffodil cichlid
MR, GR1, and GR2 with 10-7 M aldosterone and cortisol (Figure 5; same concentration used in our initial
screen, Figure 2). At the nine amino acid positions identified above, the LBD of daffodil cichlid GR1 was found
to be identical to midshipman GR2 while daffodil cichlid
GR2 was identical to midshipman GR1. The daffodil
cichlid MR construct was activated by both aldosterone
and cortisol, consistent with midshipman MR and a previous study of full-length Burton’s cichlid MR [12]. The
daffodil cichlid GR1 construct was activated by both

the side chains of the residues of substitution F/I204 are
located less than 4 Å from the putative bound ligand
position (Figure 6C). This substitution represents a major
change in the physical structure of the ligand-binding
pocket of the LBD, as well as a change in the degree of
hydrophobicity. Such a change could alter the positioning
and the binding of a ligand within the ligand-binding
pocket. The seven remaining amino acid substitutions
were more distant from the ligand-binding pocket and
failed to induce structural changes between the homology
models.

aldosterone and cortisol, while daffodil cichlid GR2 was
cortisol-specific at 10-7M, consistent with a role of the
identified amino acid substitutions in regulating mineralocorticoid sensitivity.
We next used protein structure homology modeling to
examine the locations of the identified amino acid substitutions and access the likelihood that such substitutions
might alter ligand specificity. Modeling the midshipman
GR LBDs was based on those of a putative ancestral GR
and a general corticosteroid receptor. Two of the nine
identified candidate amino acids, A/S49 and F/I204,
appeared to be particularly strong candidates for regulating LBD function due to estimated proximity to the
bound corticosteroid or to structural change induced in
the protein models (Figure 6A). The A/S49 substitution
was located at the end of helix 3, distant from the ligandbinding pocket; however, this substitution between polar
and non-polar residues altered the length of helix 3 and
the loop between helices 3 and 4 (Figure 6B). This may
have an important effect on the relative positioning of
helix 3 and thus how well the ligand-binding pocket can
accommodate either aldosterone or DOC. Furthermore,

Discussion
We took a broad comparative approach using chimeric
GAL4-LBD constructs in a single assay to examine the
ligand specificity of the LBDs of the full range of corticosteroid receptors within single species as well as across
deeply diverged vertebrate taxa. As discussed below, this
property likely led to neo-functionalization and maintenance of two GRs. Comparisons of the amino acid
sequences and predicted structures of the duplicate GR
LBDs added insight into the evolutionary changes that
may regulate ligand specificity. In particular, the mineralocorticoid sensitivities of duplicate GRs in teleosts were
highly labile in the context of their molecular phylogeny,
i.e., it could not be predicted based on the degree of similarity between their sequences (Figure 1).
Ligand specificity

Aldosterone is the primary mineralocorticoid in tetrapods [1], while teleost fish appear to lack the aldosterone synthase necessary to produce aldosterone [7]. We
demonstrated that teleost MR LBD is sensitive to both
mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, consistent with
previous results for both the LBD and the whole protein
[2,10,12]. The maximal activation by aldosterone was
greater than that of either DOC or cortisol (Figure 3B),
though the variation in EC50 values of these ligands for
the midshipman MR construct were not substantial
(Table 1). DOC, the potential natural agonist for MR in
teleosts [10], elicited a response from midshipman MR.
This was consistent with results for the full-length MR
of rainbow trout [10], the MR LBD of skate [25], and
the corticosteroid receptors of the more basal hagfish
and lamprey (Table 2, also see Figure 1) [2]. Our data
thus support the hypothesis that the evolution of an MR
predates aldosterone [2,35].
DOC, which elicits activity from MRs across a range
of vertebrates (Table 2), may be the primary ligand of
the ancestral MR [8]. Since DOC activates the corticosteroid receptors of jawless vertebrates [2], the proposed
ancestral corticosteroid receptor (see Figure 1) [2], the
maintained DOC sensitivity of MR may represent a conserved ancestral function. Aldosterone induced greater

Figure 4 LBD alignment. The alignment of the LBDs of the MRs and GRs used in this study demonstrates the high sequence identity between
genes. Sequence locations of the secondary structure helices are given below the alignment. To identify amino acids that may play a role in
mineralocorticoid sensitivity of the duplicate teleost GRs, we aligned the LBDs of GRs that are mineralocorticoid insensitive (green) and GRs that
show mineralocorticoid sensitivity (blue). We identified nine positions (highlighted within the alignment) with amino acid residues conserved
within but not between aldosterone-sensitive and insensitive groups. These residues included positions 15, 38, 49, 129, 161, 195, 203, 204 and
235. (Position 1 of the LBDs corresponds to positions 538 and 532 of the full-length mouse and human GRs, respectively.)

maximal activation than DOC for both mouse and midshipman MR LBD constructs with lower EC50s, suggesting that aldosterone evolved as a more potent MR
agonist among lobe-finned fishes, as evidenced in extant
lungfish and descendant tetrapods [1]. The response of
the mouse MR to DOC (Figure 3A), together with

evidence for DOC in the plasma of mammals [e.g.,
[36,37]], suggests that DOC may still be an important
ligand of the tetrapod MR. The MR LBDs studied here
showed sensitivity to both aldosterone and cortisol, as
well as two steroids involved in the biosynthesis of
aldosterone and cortisol (DOC, 11-deoxycortisol)

shape of the ligand-binding pocket. Model distances between phenylalanine or isoleucine and the ligand (cortisol, red) are indicated.

[see: [38]]. This reflects both the overall promiscuity of
the MR and conserved sensitivity of the ancestral corticosteroid receptor (Table 2). Three of these steroids
(DOC, 11-deoxycortisol, and cortisol) are present in the
plasma of teleosts [39]; thus, teleost MR has either a
wide array of endogenous ligands or alternate mechanisms inhibit certain steroids from binding to MR, as
occurs in mammals [40,41].
Neo-functionalization of duplicate GRs

The relative ligand sensitivities of GR1 and GR2 in teleosts
provide insight into the biological basis for maintaining
duplicate GRs. Bury and Sturm [38] hypothesized that the
difference in sensitivity between rainbow trout GRs
evolved such that GR2 is active at basal cortisol levels
while GR1 is recruited under stressful conditions with elevated cortisol. The GR LBDs examined in this study were
all activated by cortisol and with a slightly lower EC50 for
midshipman GR2 than GR1 (Table 1), though not on the
order of the difference observed in rainbow trout [13].
The dose-response data showed activity from GR2 at very
low cortisol concentrations, while GR1 was not activated
at these concentrations (Figures 3D and 3E). This is
further consistent with the hypothesis of GR1 activity
restricted to times of high cortisol release.
Bury and Sturm [38] described the observed difference
in cortisol sensitivity between duplicate GRs as a neofunctionalization and proposed that the functions of a
single GR are partitioned between the duplicate GRs into
stressful (high cortisol) and basal-level (low cortisol)
activity. Such partitioning seems more accurately
described as sub-functionalization since neither of the
duplicate GRs acquire a novel function. The evidence
presented here supports neo-functionalization based on
the promiscuity of ligand specificity among GR paralogues and suggests that promiscuous GRs acquired a
novel function distinct from their direct ancestral predecessor. As we report for midshipman and daffodil cichlid,
it appears that in many teleost species one GR shows
strong ligand specificity for glucocorticoids (cortisol and
dexamethasone), while the other GR responds to glucocorticoids as well as either aldosterone and DOC or 11deoxycortisol (Table 2). The broader ligand sensitivity is
more similar to that of the single skate GR as well as the
basal hagfish and lamprey corticosteroid receptors
(Table 2, also see Figure 1). However, because the
inferred ancestral GR of bony vertebrates is cortisol-specific [42], the observed promiscuousness among GRs
represents a novel property and thus is a neo-functionalization, rather than sub-functionalization of the ancestral
characters. A similar reversion of GR to a more broadly
sensitive receptor is seen in chickens (Gallus gallus) in
which the full-length GR is more sensitive to aldosterone
than to cortisol [43]. A promiscuous GR among bony

Page 10 of 15

vertebrates could function in a role similar to the ancestral GR of cartilaginous fishes (see skate, Figure 1), while
a cortisol-specific GR serves a more selective function.
The fact that GR steroid-specificity is not predictable
based on the phylogeny of receptor sequences (Figure 1)
suggests that activation by steroids other than cortisol is
evolutionarily labile, providing a basis for rapid adaptation of these receptors. The evolutionary plasticity of GR
specificity may occasionally lead to the duplicate teleost
GRs reverting to redundant states and thus one of the
receptors being lost in some lineages, which may
be responsible for the single GR of zebrafish (Danio
rerio) [33,44].
Amino acid substitutions and GR ligand specificity

We aligned the amino acid sequences of LBDs from GR1
and GR2 of midshipman with GR2 from Burton’s cichlid
and GR1 from rainbow trout to examine the molecular
basis of variation in the mineralocorticoid sensitivity of
GRs. Nine amino acid positions correlated with mineralocorticoid sensitivity (Figure 4). These positions showed the
same correlation with mineralocorticoid sensitivity in the
daffodil cichlid GR LBDs (Figures 4 and 5), strongly supporting a role for these residues in altering ligand specificity. Five of the identified residues (R48, A49, H195, S203
and F204) are noteworthy because the same amino acids
occur at these positions in the mineralocorticoid-sensitive
chicken GR [43], with residues H195 and F204 common
in many MRs (Figure 4). Furthermore, residue F204 has
previously been shown to directly interact with the ligand,
is adjacent to another ligand contacting residue [21,45],
and is important for proper receptor co-activator and corepressor binding [46]. Using homology model structures
to midshipman GR1 and GR2, we identified two of the
nine amino acid residues as particularly strong candidates
for regulating ligand specificity because they likely either
make contact with the ligand or change the structure of
the LBD (Figure 6). The A/S substitution at position 49 is
distant from the ligand-binding pocket, but it alters the
length and polarity of the distal end of helix 3 (Figure 6B)
which is likely to affect the conformation and flexibility of
helix 3 and the loop between helices 3 and 4. Such conformational effects can play an important role in the ligand
specificity of corticosteroid receptors [42,47]. Additionally,
the F/I substitution at position 204 is located in the binding pocket, within 4Å of the putative ligand position
(Figure 6C). Though this is a substitution between two
non-polar residues, this substitution introduces a change
in the degree of hydrophobicity and a large difference in
structure. Such amino acid substitutions within the LBD
affect the binding specificity and transactivational response
of steroid receptors to particular ligands [21,45].
Our results are consistent with the findings of Bridgham et al [24] that accumulation of restrictive mutations

Arterbery et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/14

make a reversal of protein structure and function
unlikely. None of the nine candidate amino acid residues identified in our analysis correspond to residues
previously suggested to play a role in the evolution of
GR cortisol specificity [24,42,47]. This incongruity indicated that mineralocorticoid sensitivity among teleost
GRs likely results from novel mutations that permit
aldosterone binding to otherwise cortisol specific receptors rather than back-mutations to the ancestral aldosterone sensitive state.

Conclusion
A luciferase reporter assay was used to characterize the
transcriptional activation of corticosteroid receptors
across the two most widely divergent groups of bony vertebrates, tetrapods and teleosts, showing the activation of
all teleost receptors by cortisol with variable activation by
other steroids in the corticosteroid biosynthetic pathways. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that GR aldosterone-sensitivity cannot be predicted among fishes on
the basis of receptor sequence similarity. This suggests
that different lines of teleosts have adapted duplicate GRs
for divergent functions. While one has cortisol-specificity, the other is broadly sensitive to corticosteroids,
more akin to the ancestral state. However, the latter is
not a reversal of phenotype, but instead represents a
novel condition brought about by specific amino acid
substitutions. Such neo-functionalization reflects the
dynamic and complex regulation inherent in the divergence of corticosteroid receptors across vertebrates.

P. notatus (plainfin midshipman) GR1 (GenBank no.

second GR from midshipman we used degenerate PCR
primers designed based on the amino acid sequences of
regions that are highly conserved in other species, adding restriction enzyme sites to the 5’ end of each primer
to aid in cloning. The degenerate MR forward and
reverse primer sequences were, respectively: TCACGGATCCGGNTGYCAYTAYGGNGTNGT and CGATG
AATTCTYAYTTYYTRTGRAARTA. The initial degenerate GR forward and reverse primers were: TCACGGATCCCARCAYAAYTAYYTNTGYGC and ACTCCC
GGGTYAYAAYTGRTGRAANARNA. Subsequent to
acquiring a partial sequence of midshipman GR2, the
following forward primer was used for amplifying and
cloning of the full GR2 LBD: AGAGGATCCCCAGC
CTGCCGCTATCGC. For each primer the regions in
bold represent restriction sites used for cloning. PCR
amplification was performed using the FailSafe polymerase mix (Epicentre, Madison, WI). Products were ligated
into the Bluescript KS- plasmid and transformed
into DH5a competent cells. Individual clones were
sequenced at the Cornell University Life Sciences Core
Laboratory Center (Ithaca, NY).

Methods
Tissue sources

Midshipman were hand collected from sites in northern
California during the breeding season (May-August),
shipped to Cornell University within 72 h, and maintained in saltwater aquaria until sacrificed within 24-48 h
of receipt. Tissue sampling was carried out following
deep anesthetization (0.025% benzocaine; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO). Mouse liver (Mus musculus) was donated
by David McCobb (Cornell University) and daffodil
cichlid liver (Neolamprologus pulcher) by Sigal Balshine
(McMaster University). All tissue samples were flash frozen and stored at -80°C until used for RNA extraction.
Animal protocols were approved by the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Cloning of LBDs

RNA was isolated from the tissue samples using Trizol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcribed using
Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocols. PCR
on cDNA from each tissue was conducted using gene/
species-specific primers that targeted the LBD of the

We produced a phylogeny of corticosteroid receptors
using MrBayes 3.1.2 [48], run at the facilities of the
Computational Biology Service Unit at Cornell University. In addition to the sequences used in this study, we
added sequences from several other fish species for
phylogenetic resolution: Myxine glutinosa (hagfish) corticosteroid receptor (GenBank no. DQ382336.1), Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey) corticosteroid receptor
(GenBank no. AY028457), Leucoraja erinacea (little
skate) MR (GenBank no. DQ382339.1), L. erinacea GR
(GenBank no. DQ382338.1), Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) MRa (GenBank no. AY495584.1), O. mykiss
MRb (GenBank no. AY495585.1), O. mykiss GR1 (GenBank no. Z54210.1), O. mykiss GR2 (GenBank no.
AY495372.1), Astatotilapia burtoni (Burton’s cichlid) MR
(GenBank no. AF263741), A. burtoni GR1b (previously
GR2b; GenBank no. AF263740), and A. burtoni GR2
(previously GR1; GenBank no. AF263738.1). An additional GR isoform, GR2a, from A. burtoni was not
included because it is a alternatively spliced isoform of
the same GR1 gene which produces the GR1b transcript
used in this analysis [12]. A phylogram was created based
on an alignment of LBD and hinge regions as well as full

Arterbery et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:14

length coding sequences when they were available.
A nucleotide alignment, which was used for the phylogenetic analysis, was aligned based on the deduced amino
acid sequences using Clustal W. A general time reversible
model with invariable sites and a gamma distribution for
variable rate sites (GTR+I+G) was used. Four Markov
chains of 1,000,000 generations sampling every 100 th
generation with a burn-in of 25% were used for the analysis. A majority rule consensus tree and posterior probabilities were generated. The resulting phylogram was
visualized and edited Mesquite 2.5 [49].
GAL4-UAS transactivation constructs

The GAL4 DBD, engineered with a FLAG epitope tag
(DYKDDDDK) at its amino terminus, was amplified and
cloned into the pBluescript KS- plasmid. The corticosteroid receptor LBDs were each subcloned in frame with the
GAL4 DBD in pBluescript KS- to produce gene cassettes
coding for single FLAG-tagged GAL4 - LBD fusion proteins. Each of these cassettes were then subcloned into the
pCMV5 mammalian expression vector under regulation of
the constitutive CMV promoter. To produce the luciferase
reporter construct, a DNA region isolated from a pUAST
vector containing five repeating GAL4 UAS domains with
a minimal HSP70 promoter was inserted into a pGL3-luc
vector upstream of the luciferase coding region. These
constructs were all sequenced to verify their accuracy
before maxi-prepping them for use in Western blot and
transactivation analyses.
Western blot analyses

The methods used were similar to those reported by
Kim et al. [50]. Briefly, HeLa cells were grown in DME/
F-12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% CDCS.
The cells were plated in six-well plates and grown to
approximately 70% confluency. Each well was transfected with 400 μg of pCMV5-GAL4-LBD using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany). Eighteen h after transfection, the cells were
harvested in protein loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris pH
6.8, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 65 mM DTT, 0.02% bromophenol blue). Cell extracts were heated to 95°C for
5 min, run out on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred
to PVDF membrane, and detected using the FLAG M2
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Transactivation assays

The methods used were similar to those reported previously [50]. Briefly, HeLa cells were grown in DME/F12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% CDCS.
The cells were plated in six-well plates and grown to
approximately 70% confluency. The cells in each well
were co-transfected with 500 ng of the pGL3 GAL4
regulated luciferase reporter construct and 400 ng of

Page 12 of 15

one of the pCMV5-GAL4-LBD constructs. An initial
screen of corticosteroid receptor ligand sensitivity of the
midshipman and mouse receptors was performed 12 to
24 h after transfection by treating the cells with vehicle
(ethanol) or 10-7 M of one of several steroid hormones.
Cells were incubated for an additional 18 h.
The hormones examined included aldosterone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone (cortisol), 11-deoxycortisol,
cortisone and the non-aromatizable androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT). The 11-deoxycortisol and cortisone
were used to examine cortisol specificity because they are
the immediate upstream and downstream steroids,
respectively, of cortisol in the steroid biosynthetic pathway [1]. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid,
was used with the GR constructs because of its wellestablished high binding affinity for mammalian GR
[21,51,52]. However, dexamethasone was not used with
MR constructs because the dexamethasone paradox, the
finding that MRs have variable affinities for dexamethasone in vitro versus in vivo [review: [53]], would have
confounded the interpretation of results in our heterologous expression system. The androgen 11-KT was chosen
to examine whether the isolated LBDs show generalized
binding to C3-keto steroids; 11-KT is also a predominant
androgen in midshipman [54]. To examine whether
mineralocorticoid sensitivity was consistent with the phylogeny of teleost corticosteroid receptors, we also performed these transactivation assays on the daffodil
cichlid MR, GR1, and GR2 with aldosterone and cortisol.
In addition to the discriminatory capacity of the LBDs,
we examined the relative ligand sensitivities of the
corticosteroid receptors of midshipman and mice by
incubating transfected cells for 18 h with 10-fold dilutions ranging from 10 -11 to 10 -6 M of aldosterone,
11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), dexamethasone, or cortisol. DOC, an aldosterone precursor, was selected
because it may be the dominant mineralocorticoid in
teleost fish [10]. The dose response analyses were
performed on cells co-transfected with the GAL4 regulated luciferase reporter construct and the pCMV5GAL4-LBD constructs from mouse and midshipman.
After 18 h the cells were washed with PBS and lysed
using1x Lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase activity of each cell extract was measured using a
mix of 50 μl luciferin (1:1 with water) and 50 μl extract.
The raw luciferase values for each fusion product were
normalized to the values for the vehicle (ethanol) treatment specific for that LBD. To ensure reproducibility,
each assay was run in duplicate, and each experiment
was performed at least three times.
Protein sequence and structural analyses

To investigate the molecular basis for variation in
mineralocorticoid sensitivity of GRs, we aligned the

Arterbery et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/14

amino acid sequences of LBDs from GR1 and GR2 of
midshipman and daffodil cichlid with GR2 of Burton’s
cichlid and rainbow trout GR1, two other species with
substantial documentation of the ligand sensitivity of
corticosteroid receptors [2,10,12,13]. Burton’s cichlid
GR1 and rainbow trout GR2 were excluded because
their mineralocorticoid sensitivities are less clear based
on previous studies [2,12,13]. We used this alignment to
identify amino acid substitutions that correlated with
mineralocorticoid sensitivity across GRs. To more closely examine the potential effects of identified amino
acid substitutions on the protein structure and ligandbinding pocket we created homology models of the GR
ligand binding domains using the SWISS-MODEL
homology-modeling server and DeepViewer 4.0 software
[55-58], using as templates the crystal structures of a
putative ancestral GR in complex with dexamethasone
(PBD ID: 3GN8) as well as fitting an ancestral corticosteroid receptor in complex with aldosterone (PDB ID:
2Q1H) and cortisol (PDB ID: 2Q1V).
Statistics

One sample t-tests were performed to test whether each
normalized luciferase activity was greater than the baseline of 1.0 at 10-7 M treatment with each ligand. We performed our dose response analyses for each LBD
construct by fitting three-parameter logistic curves of the
form f ( x) =  1 +

the response to dose x, b1 is the estimated upper bound
on the response, b2 is the estimated EC50, and b3 is the
estimated “slope” or shape parameter. Since our
responses were normalized to the LBD specific vehicle
treatment, the zero dose response was set to 1 in our
model. However, because the midshipman GR2 construct
showed significant activity with all the corticosteroids the
typical 4-parameter curve was used for this construct
because it produced a more accurate fit to the data.
Many LBD constructs showed a previously observed
decrease in responses at high doses after the initial
increase which may result from cytotoxicity at these
doses [32]. We accounted for this drop by excluding such
points from our analysis; for each construct, we calculated the dosage, d M , at which the maximum average
response was achieved and included only those data
points with doses at or below d M in our curve fitting
algorithms. The fitted curves were obtained using the
least squares curve fitting program in MatLab’s optimization toolbox (Natick, MA) and the built in non-linear
least squares curve fitting program in R [59]. Since fitting
nonlinear curves may converge to local minima in the
landscape of possible solutions, we tested the robustness
of our fits by running our curve fitting programs multiple

times with different initial values for the threeparameters b 1 , b 2 , and b 3 . We quantitatively assessed
each fit by computing the residual sum of squares (RSS)
and selected the model with the smallest RSS. In some
cases, two models yielded similar RSS and in these cases,
we selected the model which gave the most reasonable
qualitative fit. All graphs were produced with SigmaPlot
10 (Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA).
