Abstract
Background: Pseudoalteromonas is an important genus widespread in marine environment, and a lot of
psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas strains thrive in deep sea and polar sea. By now, there are only a few genetic
systems for Pseudoalteromonas reported and no commercial Pseudoalteromonas genetic system is available, which
impedes the study of Pseudoalteromonas, especially for psychrophilic strains. The aim of this study is to develop a
heterologous expression system for psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas.
Results: A cryptic plasmid pSM429 isolated from psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas sp. BSi20429 from the Arctic sea
ice, was sequenced and characterized. The plasmid pSM429 is 3874 bp in length, with a G+C content of 28%. Four
putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified on pSM429. Based on homology, the ORF4 was predicted to
encode a replication initiation (Rep) protein. A shuttle vector (Escherichia coli, Pseudoalteromonas), pWD, was
constructed by ligating pSM429 and pUC19 and inserting a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) cassette
conferring chloramphenicol resistance. To determine the minimal replicon of pSM429 and to check the
functionality of identified ORFs, various pWD derivatives were constructed. All derivatives except the two smallest
ones were shown to allow replication in Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM20429, a plasmid-cured strain of
Pseudoalteromonas sp. BSi20429, suggesting that the orf4 and its flanking intergenic regions are essential for
plasmid replication. Although not essential, the sequence including some repeats between orf1 and orf2 plays
important roles in segregational stability of the plasmid. With the aid of pWD-derived plasmid pWD2, the
erythromycin resistance gene and the cd gene encoding the catalytic domain of a cold-adapted cellulase were
successfully expressed in Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM20429.
Conclusions: Plasmid pSM429 was isolated and characterized, and the regions essential for plasmid replication
and stability were determined, helping the development of pSM429-based shuttle vectors. The shuttle vectors
pWD and its derivatives could be used as cloning vectors for Pseudoalteromonas, offering new perspectives in
the genetic manipulation of Pseudoalteromonas strains. With the aid of pWD-derived vector and its host, the
erythromycin resistance gene and the cd gene of a cold-adapted protein were successfully expressed,
indicating that the potential use of this system for recombinant protein production, especially for cold-adapted
proteins.

Introduction
Cold-adapted bacteria are excellent candidates for investigations of protein evolution and molecular adaptations
to extreme conditions. Moreover, cold-adapted enzymes
from psychrophiles offer novel opportunities for biotechnological applications [1,2]. Native plasmids from
cold-adapted bacteria are of particular interest, because
plasmids contribute directly in the adaptation of bacteria
to their natural environments and provide easy model
systems for investigation of basic molecular processes
[3]. Furthermore, native plasmids can be used in developing genetic systems.
Pseudoalteromonas is a genus of gamma-proteobacteria
that is widespread in the world’s oceans, and a lot of psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas strains thrive in deep sea
and polar sea. The genus Pseudoalteromonas contains
over 30 marine species [4], which play an important role
in marine ecosystem. Pseudoalteromonas has attracted significant interest for two reasons. First, Pseudoalteromonas
species are important for investigation of microbe-host
interactions in the sea. Second, many species synthesize
biologically active molecules, such as extracellular antibiotics, toxins, extracellular enzymes and polysaccarides [4-8].
However, by now there are only a few genetic systems for
Pseudoalteromonas reported [9-12] and no commercial
Pseudoalteromonas genetic system is available, which
impedes the study of Pseudoalteromonas, especially for
psychrophilic strains.
In our laboratory, psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas
strains have been studied for over ten years on their coldadaptation mechanism and the proteases they secreted
[5,13-18]. To further study the cold-adaptation mechanism
of psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas and protease expression, development of genetic systems for gene knockout
and cold-adapted protein expression is essential. In this
article, a small cryptic plasmid from psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas sp. BSi20429 (BSi20429 thereafter), designated pSM429, was isolated and characterized. A shuttle
vector pWD was constructed based on pSM429. The
regions responsible for replication and stability on pWD
were determined by studying the replication of pWDderived plasmids in Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM20429
(SM20429 thereafter), a plasmid-cured strain of BSi20429.
A stable pWD-derived plasmid, pWD2, was successfully
used as an express vector to express the erythromycin
resistance gene and the cd gene of a cold-adapted cellulase
in SM20429.
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and plasmid isolation

Pseudoalteromonas strains were previously isolated from
the sea-ice samples collected using a MARKII ice auger
during the Second Chinese National Arctic Research
Expedition cruise of the USCGC icebreaker Xue Long

Page 2 of 12

into the Canada Basin in August 2003. 102 Pseudoalteromonas strains were screened for the presence of plasmids. Alkaline SDS lysis and DNA preparation method
was used to isolate plasmids as described by Sambrook
et al. [19]. Pseudoalteromonas sp. BSi20429 grown at
20°C in 2216E broth was found to carry a plasmid.
Strain BSi20429, a gram negative bacterium, grows well
in aerobic conditions at temperatures from 4°C to 34°C
in 2216E broth (Difco) or marine LB broth (10 g peptone, 5 g yeast extract, 1 l artificial seawater, pH 7.5).
The optimal temperature for BSi20429 growing is
20-25°C. Escherichia coli DH5a [(supE 44, △lacU169
(θ80lacZ△M15) endA1, recA1, hsdR17, thi-1 l- gyrA96,
relA1] was grown at 37°C in LB medium [19] and used
as a host for gene cloning and plasmid construction.
Pseudoalteromonas transformants were selected in the
presence of 8 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 25 μg/ml
ampicillin, and further propagated in broth medium
containing 20 μg/ml choramphenicol. Antibiotics were
used in E. coli at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml. Plasmids
used in this study were listed in Table 1.
Plasmid sequencing and analysis

The plasmid isolated from BSi20429 was termed as
pSM429. Analysis of restriction digests on agarose gel
showed that pSM429 contains singular restriction site
for HindIII and NdeI, respectively. The plasmid was
linearised by these two restriction enzymes, and restriction fragments of different sizes were cloned into
pGEM-T Easy and sequenced by dideoxy chain termination method using an Applied Biosystems DNA
sequencer. The nucleotide sequence of pSM429 was
determined by using a combination of subcloning and
primer walking. The whole plasmid sequence was covered at least three times by single read. The nucleotide
sequence, amino acid sequence and the distribution of
direct and inverted repeated sequences were analyzed
using DNASTAR. The predicted protein-coding regions
were initially defined by searching for ORFs longer than
80 codons. The potential coding regions were then confirmed with prokaryotic gene finder GeneMark.hmm 2.4
for Prokaryotes [20] at http://opal.biology.gatech.edu/
GeneMark/gmhmm2_prok.cgi using Pseudoalteromonas
haloplanktis TAC125 chromosome I genome as a
model. The functional protein domain analysis of
predicted ORFs was performed by the InterProScan
program at the European Bioinformatics Institute
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/. Similarity searches
were carried out using Blast http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/blast/[21].
The nucleotide sequence of pSM429 was deposited in
the GenBank database under the accession number
EU627679.

Determination of plasmid copy number

The copy number of plasmid pSM429 in strain
BSi20429 was determined using the method described
by Qin et al. [22]. Strain BSi20429 was grown in marine LB broth at 20°C and total genome DNA was isolated by using PowerMax™Soil DNA Isolation Kit
(MO BIO). The genome DNA was diluted by 10 and
100 times in TE Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.5), and then was separated in equal
volumes on a 0.7% agarose gel by electrophoresis at
50 V for 2.5 h. By comparing the intensity of the
diluted chromosomal DNA band with the non-diluted
plasmid DNA band using the image analysis software
Gene Tools (Syngene), the copy number of pSM429
was calculated as follows:
Ip
Sc
Nc =
×
Sp
Ic

(N c , copy number of the plasmid; S c , chromosomal
DNA size (4.5 M); Sp, plasmid DNA size (3.78 kb); Ip,
intensity of plasmid DNA band; Ic, intensity of chromosomal DNA band).

Construction of the shuttle vector pWD and its
derivatives

Plasmids pSM429 and pUC19 were isolated as described
above. The complete DNA sequence of pSM429 was
amplified by PCR with primers AF (containing a SalI
site) and AR (containing a BamHI site). The 3.8-kb linearised pSM429 was digested with SalI and BamHI and
cloned in pUC19. The chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) cassette was amplified by PCR from pBT
(Stratagene), using primers CB (containing a BamHI
site) and CE (containing an EcoRI site). The 1.3-kb

and spread onto 2216E agar. Colonies were screened for
the presence of pSM429 as described above. Putative

the genome by PCR with two pairs of primers covering
different regions of pSM429 (RepF & RepR, ORF3F &

product was double-digested using BamHI and EcoRI
and ligated to the constructed pUC19+pSM429 treated
with the same restriction enzymes, and then transformed into E. coli DH5a. The constructed shuttle vector was designated as pWD.
Derivatives of pWD (pWD1, pWD2, pWD3, pWD4,
pWD5, pWD6) were constructed as outlined in Figure 1.
Purified DNA of pSM429 was used as a template in PCR.
All primers were designed with sites for SalI or BamHI at
their 5’ ends to allow direct cloning of the amplicons
digested with these two enzymes into the SalI and BamHI
sites of pWD. In new constructs, the complete fragment of
pSM429 was replaced by the amplicons with different
length. New constructed derivatives were transformed into
E. coli DH5a. Plasmids isolated from E. coli DH5a and
verified by sequencing were electroporated into SM20429.
Electroporation

The protocol to electroporate plasmids into SM20429
was based on the method described by Kurusu et al. [23]
with some modification. A 1% inoculum from over-night
culture of SM20429 in 2216E medium was inoculated
into 20 ml of the same culture and grown at 20°C. After
incubation for 4 h, the logarithmic-phase cells were harvested and washed twice with chilled ddH2O. The cells
were suspended in a final volume of 100 μl ddH2O containing 20 mM glucose, and mixed with 1 μg plasmid
DNA. Electroporation was performed with a Gene Pulser
(Bio-Rad) at a capacity of 50 μF and a voltage of 2.0 kV.
After one pulse, the cells were grown in 2216E medium
supplemented with glucose (20 mM) for 3 h, and then
were spread on selective plates with chloramphenicol.
Analysis of plasmid stability

SM20429 strains with plasmid pWD or other derivative
plasmids were grown in 2216E broth for about 24 generations by being serially transferred to fresh broth medium. Samples were removed from each transfer and serial
dilutions of the sample were plated on 2216E agar medium with or without antibiotics. The fraction of chloramphenicol-resistant (CmR) cells in the total population
was determined to calculate the segregational stability of
the constructed plasmid vectors. Finally, presence of plasmid DNA in CmR cells was confirmed by plasmid isolation and transformation to E. coli DH5a.
Construction of expression system in SM20429

The erythromycin resistance gene (ermC) from plasmid
pMG36e [24] was amplified by PCR using the primers
EMF (containing PstI restriction site) and EMR (containing SalI restriction site) to construct an ermCexpression vector. The 735-bp PCR product was cloned
into vector pMD19T simple (Takara). The fragment of
the promoter-less ermC gene in the pMD19T was

Page 4 of 12

separated with PstI and SalI and was used in the
construction of the ermC-expression vector with the
smallest stable plasmid pWD2.
The promoter-less erythromycin resistance gene was
cloned into pWD2 downstream of the Plac of pUC19.
The constructed ermC-expression vector was designated
as pWD-ermC. This expression vector was electroporated into SM20429. The transformed SM20429 cells
were cultured at 25°C in 2216E broth for 24 h. To test
the gene expression in SM20429, the total cell lysates of
recombinant strain SM20429 expressing ermC under the
control of Plac were analyzed by 12.5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
To test whether the recombinant ErmC was active, the
transformed SM20429 cells harboring pWD2 and the
transformed SM20429 cells harboring pWD-ermC were
inoculated in 2216E medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml
or 60 μg/ml erythromycin (EM), respectively, and then
cultured at 25°C.
Gene cloning and expression of the catalytic domain of
the cold-adapted cellulase from P. sp. BSw20308 and
cellulase assay

A gene encoding a cold-adapted cellulase Cel308 (GenBank Accession No. HQ997897) has been cloned from the
psychrophilic strain Pseudoalteromonas sp. BSw20308 isolated from the Arctic sea ice in our lab. The DNA fragment encoding the catalytic domain (CD) of the cellulase
was amplified by PCR from BSw20308, and then ligated
into pWD2 to construct the expression vector pWD-cd.
The vector pWD-cd was introduced into SM20429 by
electroporation for the production of the CD. The transformed SM20429 cells were cultured at 25-30°C in 2216E
broth. To analyze the expression of the CD of the cellulase,
the cellulase activity in the transformed SM20429 cells was
assayed. After grown at 25-30°C for 48 h, the SM20429
cells (3 ml) were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml PBS
buffer (0.02 M, pH 7.5), and then sonicated in an ice-water
bath. After centrifugation, the cellulase activity in the
supernatant was measured as described by Bhat et al. [25].
A mixture containing 100 μl of the supernatant and 900 μl
of 1% sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose was incubated at
35°C for 30 min. After incubation, the released amount of
reducing sugar was measured using the dinitrosalicylic acid
(DNS) method with glucose as standard [26]. One unit of
the enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
to release 1 μg of glucose per min.

pSM429 consists of 3874 bp with a G+C content of
28%, which is lower than that of the chromosomal DNA
(39-44%) of Pseudoalteromonas, as well as that of other
published Pseudoalteromonas plasmids, such as pPS1M3
(37%) [23], pMtBL (39%) [27] and pKW1 (43%) [28].
Sequence analysis revealed that the plasmid pSM429
contains four open reading frames (ORFs) with more
than 80 amino acid residues (Table 3).
Searches in the databases revealed that ORF4 showed
moderate similarity (25-26% identity, 50% similarity) with
the Rep proteins of pFKN [29] and the other plasmids
belonging to pPT23A family from Pseudomonas syringae
[30,31]. It also showed some similarity (with identity lower
than 26%) with the Rep proteins of the ColE2-related plasmids, as well as the Rep proteins of plasmids isolated from
the bacteria of different genus. As plasmids are generally
classified based on the amino acid sequence similarity
between their replication initiator proteins [32], a phylogenetic tree was constructed using Rep amino acid
sequences of some related plasmids as shown in Figure 2.
pFKN and pAV505 isolated from Pseudomonas syringae
were selected from pPT23A group and the other plasmids
were found by homology search using putative Rep amino
acid sequence of pSM429. All of the 12 Rep proteins in
the phylogenetic tree contain two conserved domains [33],
a replicase domain (Pfam Accession No. PF03090)
believed to be involved in DNA binding [34], and an alpha
helical domain (Pfam Accession No. PF08708) that was
found at the C terminus of primases [35]. This suggests
that these Rep proteins might be involved in the replication with the similar mechanism. However, pSM429 did
not cluster with other plasmids in the phylogenetic tree,
implying that pSM429 is a novel plasmid.
Construction of the shuttle vector pWD and
transformation system

The shuttle vector pWD, based on plasmid pSM429, was
constructed for replication in E. coli and Pseudoalteromonas strains (Figure 1). The 3.8-kb plasmid pSM429 was
linearised and cloned in pUC19. In addition, the 1.3-kb

chloramphenicol resistance gene was inserted into the
resulted plasmid as selection marker to construct the
shuttle vector pWD. The presence of the pUC19 ori and
pSM429 ori in pWD enabled pWD to replicate in both E.
coli and BSi20429. The constructed plasmid pWD could
be purified from E. coli in a large amount.
To construct the host strain for the plasmid transformation, the plasmid pSM429 was cured from BSi20429
using the SDS-treated method. Screening of 40 colonies
yielded 4 plasmid-cured colonies, showing an efficiency
of 10%, which is much more effective than the method
used in Pseudoalteromonas strains previously reported
[23]. One plasmid-cured strain showing a similar phenotype to the parental strain was designated as SM20429,
which was used for further study. The total DNA of
SM20429 was purified and used as template for PCR
checking. The results showed that the plasmid did not
integrate into the genome of SM20429. As SM20429
was sensitive to erythromycin and chloramphenicol
(data not shown), chloramphenicol was used for the
direct selection of Pseudoaltermonas transformants. The
constructed shuttle vector pWD was introduced into
SM20429 by electroporation. Chloramphenicol-resistant
transformants of SM20429 were obtained at the frequency of 5.0x 102/μg DNA. To confirm that the Pseudoalteromonas transformants harbored plasmids, several
transformants were subjected to plasmid analysis. Electrophoresis showed that plasmids were prepared from
all of the selected transformants, and the prepared plasmids showed the same electroporetic DNA pattern as
that of pWD (Additional file 2, Figure S2). Moreover,
pWD DNA prepared from the Pseudoalteromonas transformants could be transformed into SM20429 at a
higher frequency (104/μg DNA) than that prepared from
E. coli transformants, suggesting the presence of DNA
restriction and modification system in BSi20429.
Properties of the shuttle vector pWD and its derivatives

functionality of the identified ORFs on pSM429 and
delete the unnecessary regions on pWD for an expression vector, six plasmids derived from pWD with different deletions were constructed (Figure 1). Each of the
six derivatives was checked in E. coli, and then was
introduced into SM20429 by electroporation. Except for
the two smallest derivatives, pWD5 and pWD6, transformants of the other four derived plasmids were all
obtained, indicating that pWD5 and pWD6 were not
capable of replication in SM20429. Since pWD5 and
pWD6 lack the upstream or the downstream sequences
of the rep gene (orf4) compared to pWD4, the results
indicated that the fragment containing rep gene and its
flanking sequences are the minimal replication region of
pSM429 and all of orf1, orf2 and orf3 are not essential
for plasmid replication.
The segregational stability of pWD and its four derivatives were tested twice and counts were done in duplicate. Average results were presented in Figure 3. In the
absence of selective pressure, nearly 100% of the cells
retain plasmids in the first 40 generations of SM20429.
However, after 40 generations, the smaller derivatives,
pWD3 and pWD4, exhibited less segregational stability
than pWD and the other bigger derivatives, pWD1 and
pWD2, in SM20429. Compared to pWD2, pWD3 lacks
some repeat sequences located between orf1 and orf2, as

shown in Figure 4. The above result suggests that these
repeat sequences are essential for the segregational stability of the plasmid and possibly related to plasmid
partition.
Construction of an ermC-expression vector and
expression of ErmC in SM20429

The erythromycin resistance gene ermC was cloned into
pWD2 downstream of the Plac promoter to construct
an ermC-expression vector, pWD-ermC. This vector
was introduced into SM20429 by electroporation and
the ermC gene was expressed under the control of Plac
promoter. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the ErmC
protein was expressed in SM20429 cells, and the expression level of ErmC in SM20429 was lower than that in
E. coli DH5a (Figure 5A). To test whether the expressed
ErmC protein is active, the SM20429 strain harboring
pWD2 and the SM20429 strain harboring pWD-ermC
were inoculated in 2216E medium supplemented with
erythromycin (EM), respectively. The pWD2-harboring
strain that is sensitive to EM as the wild strain BSi20429
could not grow in the medium supplemented with 30
μg/ml EM, while the pWD-ermC-harboring strain grew
well in the medium supplemented with 60 μg/ml EM
(Figure 5B). Therefore, the pWD-ermC-harboring strain
obtained the ability resistant to EM, indicating that the

Figure 3 Segregational stability of pWD and its derivatives in SM20429. Average results of two independent experiments for each
construct were presented. Strains harboring the constructs were cultured in the absence of selective pressure, plated under the same
conditions, and assayed for plasmid maintenance by replica-plating onto antibiotic-containing media at 40-, 80-, 120-, and 160-generation
intervals. The presence of plasmids was finally checked by plasmid preparation and gel electrophoresis.

ErmC protein expressed in SM20429 was active. These
results suggest that Plac promoter is efficient for heterologous gene expression in SM20429.
Expression of cold-adapted protein with the constructed
expression system

In our previous work, a cellulase named Cel308 was
purified from the Arctic sea ice bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. BSw 20308 (Additional file 3, Figure S3), and
the gene encoding Cel308 was cloned and sequenced.
Character analysis showed that Cel308 is a cold-adapted
enzyme (Additional file 3, Figure S4). The cd gene
encoding the catalytic domain of Cel308 was cloned
into pWD2 to construct a cd-expression vector pWDcd. The plasmid pWD-cd was transformed into
SM20429 by electroporation. After cultivation for 48 h,
the intracellular cellulase activity of the transformed
strain was detected using a quantitative assay. The

results showed that 60 units of cellulase enzyme were
expressed in 1 ml culture of SM20429. In comparison,
no cellulase activity was detected in the cells of
SM20429 harboring pWD2 (Figure 6). The results indicated that the constructed expression system consisting
of strain SM20429 and vector pWD2 could be used to
express cold-adapted protein.

Discussion
As the first step to develop an effective genetic system
for Pseudoalteromonas strains, especially the psychrophilic ones, the Pseudoalteromonas strains isolated from the
Arctic sea ice were screened for plasmids. Only one
small plasmid, pSM429, was obtained out of over one
hundred strains, suggesting that small plasmids from the
Arctic sea ice isolates of Pseudoalteromonas are less
common. This finding is consistent with the fact that
only a few reports have been published about the

isolation and characterization of plasmids from coldadapted Pseudoalteromonas strains, including Pseudoalteromonas sp. PS1M3 [23], Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 [27] and Pseudoalteromonas sp. 643A
[36]. pSM429 has much lower G+C content than other
Pseudoalteromonas plasmids, implying its cold-adaptation.
The small plasmid pSM429 is valuable for expanding the
knowledge about the genetics of extrachromosomal elements in cold-adapted Pseudoalteromonas strains and
opens the possibility to construct a genetic system for
Pseudoalteromonas strains.
Genetic systems require stable cloning and expression
vectors that allow efficient cloning and expression of
homologous and heterologous genes. To develop a
genetic system of psychrophlic Pseudoalteromonas, a
plasmid-cured strain of BSi20429 was obtained to be
used as an expression host, and a shuttle vector for
Pseudoalteromonas-E. coli was constructed based on
pSM429. Sequential deletions were used to study the
functionality of ORFs in plasmid pSM429 and to analyze
their effect on plasmid stability. The results showed that
the rep gene is essential for the autonomous replication
of pSM429 in SM20429. This is consistent with the
finding that plasmids need specific replication protein to
recognize and cut the double-stranded origin of replication for the process to begin [37]. Furthermore, deletion
of surrounding sequences of rep gene caused the loss of
replication ability of the plasmid in SM20429, probably
because these regions contain the promoter sequence of
rep gene and the replication origin where the Rep

protein binds. Although not essential, an intergenic fragment including some repeat sequences on pSM429
markedly affects the segregational stability. Accordingly,
the stable construction pWD2 containing the replication
region and the intergenic region related to segregational
stability was used as an E. coli- Pseudoalteromonas shuttle vector and for construction of expression vectors.
An expression system in cold-adapted bacteria may circumvent the problem of limited stability of the product
that is always encountered during heterogonous expression of psychrophilic proteins in mesophilic hosts
[15,38]. A few low-temperature expression systems have
been reported [39,40]. However, there are still many
cold-adapted proteins could not be successfully expressed
by a recombinant protein expression system. The alternative systems would be important for the study of coldadapted proteins. In order to check the usefulness of
plasmid pWD2 and its host SM20429 as expression system, the promoter-less ermC gene was cloned into the
vector pWD2 and introduced into SM20429. The results
showed that the ermC gene was expressed in SM20429
and the recombinant strain displayed resistance to erythromycin, suggesting that the Plac promoter was efficient in SM20429. Then, with this system, the cd gene
encoding the catalytic domain of a cold-adapted cellulase
from a psychrophilic strain was successfully expressed,
suggesting the potential use of this system for overexpression of genes from psychrophiles. Indeed, this lowtemperature expression system is still in an early stage of
development. Further improvement, such as increasing

Conclusion
In this paper, we report the characterization and use of
a plasmid pSM429 from the Arctic Pseudoalteromonas

strain BSi20429. The plasmid pSM429 is 3874 bp in
length, with a very low G+C content (28%). The ORF4
on pSM429 was predicted to encode a Rep protein.
Phylogenetic analysis implied that pSM429 is a novel
plasmid. The regions essential for plasmid replication
and stability were determined. Accordingly, the stable
shuttle vectors based on pSM429 for E. coli and Pseudoalteromonas strains, pWD, pWD1 and pWD2, were
developed, which can be used as cloning vectors for
the Pseudoalteromonas strain we studied. With the aid
of pWD2 and its Pseudoalteromonas host, the heterologous expressions of the erythromycin resistance gene
and the cold-adapted cellulase gene were successful,
indicating the potential use of this system for recombinant protein production, especially for cold-adapted
proteins. These results are helpful for Pseudoalteromonas study.
