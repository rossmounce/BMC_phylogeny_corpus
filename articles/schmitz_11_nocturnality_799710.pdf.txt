Nocturnality constrains morphological and
functional diversity in the eyes of reef fishes
Lars Schmitz1* and Peter C Wainwright1,2

Abstract
Background: Ambient light levels are often considered to drive the evolution of eye form and function. Diel
activity pattern is the main mechanism controlling the visual environment of teleost reef fish, with day-active
(diurnal) fish active in well-illuminated conditions, whereas night-active (nocturnal) fish cope with dim light.
Physiological optics predicts several specific evolutionary responses to dim-light vision that should be reflected in
visual performance features of the eye.
Results: We analyzed a large comparative dataset on morphological traits of the eyes in 265 species of teleost reef
fish in 43 different families. The eye morphology of nocturnal reef teleosts is characterized by a syndrome that
indicates better light sensitivity, including large relative eye size, high optical ratio and large, rounded pupils.
Improved dim-light image formation comes at the cost of reduced depth of focus and reduction of potential
accommodative lens movement. Diurnal teleost reef fish, released from the stringent functional requirements of
dim-light vision have much higher morphological and optical diversity than nocturnal species, with large ranges of
optical ratio, depth of focus, and lens accommodation.
Conclusions: Physical characteristics of the environment are an important factor in the evolution and
diversification of the vertebrate eye. Both teleost reef fish and terrestrial amniotes meet the functional requirements
of dim-light vision with a similar evolutionary response of morphological and optical modifications. The trade-off
between improved dim-light vision and reduced optical diversity may be a key factor in explaining the lower
trophic diversity of nocturnal reef teleosts.

Background
Temporal resource and habitat partitioning is a major
axis of ecological diversification in reef fishes [1,2]. The
large majority of reef fish families are primarily dayactive (diurnal), yet night-active behaviour (nocturnality)
has been observed in at least 13 families across teleost
reef fishes including such well-known groups as soldierand squirrelfish (Holocentridae), cardinalfish (Apogonidae), grunts (Haemulidae), and moray eels (Muraenidae)
[1,3-6]. Nocturnality comes with the enormous optical
challenge of maintaining adequate visual performance at
low light levels that severely limit image resolution and
brightness [7-9] and compromise image quality. As
most reef teleosts are visual foragers [10,11], prey detection becomes increasingly challenging with a reduction

of ambient light. Nocturnal reef fishes feature reduced
trophic diversity compared to diurnal species, yet
despite low light levels nocturnal reef fishes successfully
target and capture a variety of different prey items,
including large elusive prey, mobile benthic invertebrates, and large zooplankton [2,12-15].
How do nocturnal fish successfully cope with the physical challenge of scotopic (dim-light) vision? The maintenance of good image quality in scotopic vision
requires modifications of the visual system [7-9,16] and
these requirements are thought to be met in reef fishes
by an evolutionary syndrome of several morphological
and physiological traits. For example, large eye diameter
[17-19], rod-dominated retinae [17,20], and a high
degree of convergence of rod photoreceptors on ganglion cells [21] are recognized adaptations to scotopic
vision in shallow-water teleosts. Information on eye
shape of shallow-water teleosts is sparse in the literature
[17,22], in spite of the potential for adaptive

modifications at this level of design, as suggested by the
extensive research efforts undertaken on the ecomorphology of the chambered eyes of terrestrial amniotes in
the last decade [23-27].
Diel activity pattern has been found to strongly influence the morphological evolution of the eyes of terrestrial vertebrates [23,25,27,28]. Even though there are
differences in marine and terrestrial vision [16,29], physiological optics predicts that diel activity patterns trigger evolutionary responses resulting in different
morphologies of diurnal and nocturnal eyes.
The three main issues that we address in this paper are
all related to whether physical characteristics, i.e., contrasting light levels of day and night, are correlated with features of eye morphology in teleost reef fishes. First, we
examined whether nocturnal species have larger eyes relative to body mass than diurnal species. Then we tested
predictions from optics for how eye morphology could be
modified for better performance in dim-light. Third, we
tested the prediction that physical and functional requirements of vision in dim light result in reduced morphological diversity of eyes compared to diurnal taxa. In contrast,
we predicted that diurnal reef fish have high morphological and optical diversity, because they are released from
the physical limitations of low light levels and selection
towards this adaptive peak should be weaker. In addition
diurnal reef fish may take advantage of adaptive peaks that
benefit other aspects of visual performance than light sensitivity. These adaptive peaks may be located in different
areas of eye morphospace, which will increase the morphological and functional diversity of diurnal reef teleosts.

Methods
Classification of diel activity patterns

We distinguished between two main diel activity patterns: nocturnal (night-active) and diurnal (day-active).
We classified all fish that are mainly active at night as
nocturnal, and all fish with main activity during the day
as diurnal, on the basis of literature surveys
[1,3-6,14,30-33] and personal observations (P.C. Wainwright). A finer distinction of diel activity patterns is
currently impossible because of the lack of more quantitative behavioural data for most reef fishes (although see
[14] and [34] for examples). There is some indication
that some fish species, in particular within Serranidae,
Scorpaenidae, and Haemulidae, are active both day and
night (cathemeral), or twilight-active (crepuscular). As
the evidence for this is often anecdotal we refrain from
a formal classification for the purpose of this analysis
until more data are available.
Specimens, measurements, and procedures

We sampled 265 species of teleost reef fish in 43
families with a total number of 849 specimens (1-30

Page 2 of 13

individuals per species) for eye morphometrics (Additional file 1). Most species in our sample are mainly reef
inhabitants and live in clear marine environments, but a
few species also enter murkier brackish and muddy
coastal waters, e.g., the silverside Atherinomorus stipes,
the mojarra Gerres cinereus, the haemulids Plectorhinchus chaetodonoides and Orthopristis chrysoptera, the
kyphosid Microcanthus strigatus, and the mullet Mugil
cephalus. The size range across individuals was 44-638
mm standard length. We sampled adults whenever possible, but some specimens were relatively small juveniles.
There were 211 diurnal species in the dataset, and 54
nocturnal species. The nocturnal species are from the
following 12 families: Apogonidae (9 species), Congridae
(1), Diodontidae (1), Haemulidae (13), Holocentridae
(10), Lutjanidae (5), Muraenidae (7), Ophichthidae (2),
Pempheridae (1), Priacanthidae (2), Sciaenidae (1), Serranidae (2).
We dissected all specimens shortly after euthanizing
them with an overdose of MS-222. We excised the left
eyeball first, removed attached ocular muscles, and cut
the optic nerve close to the sclera. We measured eyeball
diameter, axial length, the largest and smallest pupil diameter, and lens diameter (Figure 1) with an optical
micrometer on a Wild binocular stereomicroscope. It
should be noted here that the pupil of teleosts is generally considered static, i.e., there is no pupillary response
to changes in ambient light, with a few notable exceptions [35]. Then, we cut away iris and cornea, removed
the lens from the eye, and measured the equatorial diameter of the lens, again using the optical micrometer.
We repeated this procedure for the right eye. All
research was carried out in accordance with the UC
Davis animal use and care protocols.
Physiological optics

Optics provides models for light sensitivity on the basis
of morphological and physiological features of the eye.
Schmitz and Motani [27] introduced the optical ratio
(OPT) as a descriptor of light sensitivity, on the basis of
earlier work by Hughes and Land [36,37]. OPT is the
product of the ratio between the optical aperture (A)
and the posterior nodal distance (PND), i.e., the inverse
of f-number, and the ratio between optical aperture and
the diameter of the retina (RD):
OPT = A∧ 2/(RD × PND).

OPT is a useful discriminator between the three main
types of ocular image formation in terrestrial amniotes:
photopic (image formation in bright light), mesopic
(intermediate light), and scotopic (dim light). The formfunction relation of OPT and ocular image formation
has been tested empirically and found valid by

calculations were performed on the statistical platform
‘R’ (version 2.13.1) [39]. We calculated species means of
the individual averages obtained from measurements of
left and right eyes prior to all analyses. Then, we log10transformed the data and rounded to four significant
figures. Ratios were calculated directly from the original,
untransformed species averages.

approximating the optical variables with morphological
features [27,28,38].
Absolute eye size may also influence light sensitivity
under certain conditions. As both OPT and f-number
are ratios, they are independent of size unless there are
deviations from the optically expected isometry. Nevertheless, a bigger eye may still have better light sensitivity
to extended light sources because of a higher degree of
neural summation by pooling of photoreceptor signals.
The negative effect of signal-pooling on visual acuity
could be offset by the increase of the focal length of the
eye. Bigger eyes may also have better sensitivity to point
light sources such as bioluminescent flashes, because of
their absolutely larger apertures. In contrast to sensitivity to extended light sources, point light detection is
independent from retinal area and focal length [8,9].
However, the importance of point light detection for
reef fish is unclear.
Hypotheses and data analysis

We tested for differences between nocturnal and diurnal
eye morphology with several different techniques. All

We tested whether nocturnal fish have larger eyes than
diurnal species by Standardised Major Axis regression of
eye diameter and body mass, performed with the R
package smatr (as for all other regression analyses) [40].
We first calculated the slope for all species in order to
understand the scaling of eye and body size among all
reef fish. We then tested for differences in slope to
determine if the slopes were equal. Finally, we compared
intercepts between nocturnal and diurnal species. We
chose body mass as the independent variable because it
may better account for variability in body shape (e.g.
long and slender versus deep-bodied and short) than the
other commonly used size proxy, standard length.
Anguilliforms, with their extremely elongated bodies
and large mass but relatively small heads were not
included in this part of the analysis.
Differences between nocturnal and diurnal eye morphology:
Optical ratio and pupil shape

We empirically tested OPT with two sets of morphological proxies for optical variables. First we followed
Schmitz and Motani’s [27] approach and chose lens diameter (LD) as a proxy for optical aperture and eye diameter (ED) and axial length (AL) as proxies for retina
diameter and focal length (note that focal length substitutes for PND in aquatic eyes):
OPTmorph1 = LD∧ 2/(ED × AL).

We then substituted lens diameter with the smallest
pupil diameter PDmin, respectively) as another empirical
test:
OPTmorph2 = PDmin∧ 2/(ED × AL).

We did not use the largest diameter of the pupil
because this trait has two major functions. One function
is related to optical aperture, while the other concerns
lens accommodation. The elongation of the long axis of
the pupil may result in an aphakic ("lensless”) gap,
which is considered useful for lens accommodation [41].
Lens diameter also serves two major optical functions
in the teleost eye, which may compromise the distinction between nocturnal and diurnal reef fish. The lens
ensures that most light entering the eye chamber is
brought into focus by matching the size of the optical
aperture, but is also the only refractive element in the
teleost eye and determines the focal length. This means

Schmitz and Wainwright BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:338
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/338

that, if everything else stays the same, any enlargement
of lens diameter for a larger optical aperture may also
result in a longer focal length, with f-number and possibly OPT remaining constant. Variation may be limited
in particular concerning lens diameter and axial length,
with the latter also being a proxy for focal length.
In order to test whether OPT morph1 and OPT morph2
are useful discriminators of diel activity patterns in teleost reef fish we plotted the numerators (LD^2;
PDmin^2) against the common denominator (ED × AL).
This approach avoids introducing size-dependent bias to
the ratio by accounting for possible allometric scaling of
involved variables. We fitted SMA regression lines to
pooled data and also to nocturnal and diurnal species
separately, comparing slopes and intercepts.
Furthermore, the pupil of nocturnal fish is expected to
approximate a circular shape in order to maximize the
area of the optical aperture. We tested this prediction
by SMA regression of smallest and largest pupil diameter, where the regression line of nocturnal species
should have a higher intercept than that of diurnal fish.
Finally we derived a new ratio, that combines aspects
of OPT and geometry of the optical aperture. We modified OPTmorph1 by cancelling out LD/AL because both
traits are correlated with focal length and differences
between nocturnal and diurnal groups may be limited,
leaving LD/ED. Nocturnal species are expected to have
larger LD (~optical aperture) for a given ED (~retina
diameter) than diurnal species. Then, we combined LD/
ED with the ratio describing pupil shape, PDmin/
PDmax, where nocturnal species should have a large
PDmin for a given PDmax, in order to maximize the
pupil area. The combination of these ratios yields
OPTmorph3 = (LD × PDmin)/(ED × PDmax).
Differences between nocturnal and diurnal eye morphology:
Multivariate analyses

We applied principal component analysis (PCA, correlation matrix) to further explore the eye-morphospace of
nocturnal and diurnal reef teleosts. We performed two
different PCAs. The first PCA included three variables,
namely eye diameter, axial length, and lens diameter.
These are the same variables used in the discriminant
analysis in previous studies on terrestrial eyes [27,28,38].
The second PCA included these three variables plus the
largest and smallest pupil diameter, in order to have a
more complete description of eye morphology. For both
PCAs we performed a MANOVA to test for differences
between nocturnal and diurnal taxa.
Third, we tested whether linear, quadratic, regularized,
or flexible discriminant analysis (LDA, QDA, RDA, and
FDA, respectively) can successfully distinguish between
nocturnal and diurnal eyes. Similar to the PCA, we first

Page 4 of 13

began with a set of three variables (eye diameter, axial
length, and lens diameter), before adding in the largest
and smallest pupil diameter as fourth and fifth variable.
To determine the minimal misclassified proportion with
RDA, we varied the regularization-lambda between 0
and 1 at increments of 0.01. LDA and QDA were performed with the R package MASS [42], FDA with the
mda-package [43], and RDA with the klaR-package [44].
For all discriminant analyses we used prior probabilities
defined by the training dataset.
Diversity of nocturnal and diurnal eye morphology

For the comparison of the diversity of nocturnal and
diurnal eye morphology we analyzed the pattern of morphospace occupation defined by the PCA (PC axes 2-5)
on all five variables. We assessed morphological diversity
by means of variance. There are more diurnal (n = 211)
then nocturnal species (n = 54) in our dataset, and even
though variance is considered largely independent of
sample size, we accounted for a possible bias by a rarefaction analysis. We randomly re-sampled 54 diurnal
species without replacement and calculated variance on
PCs 2-5, and repeated this procedure 100, 000 times.
This procedure resulted in 100, 000 PC analyses with
the same number of diurnal and nocturnal species, with
diurnal species randomly selected anew for each run.
Then, we compared the distribution of nocturnal variances to the bootstrap distribution of diurnal variances.

Results
Differences between nocturnal and diurnal eye size

We tested whether nocturnal reef fishes have larger eyes
than diurnal species by regressing eye diameter against
body mass with the Standardised Major Axis (SMA)
technique. The resulting plot (Figure 2a) shows a distinct separation between nocturnal and diurnal species.
Eye diameter scales with negative allometry against body
mass in both nocturnal and diurnal subgroups. The
slope of the regression line for nocturnal fish is 0.270
while the slope for diurnal fish is 0.296 and the probability of the slopes being equal to 0.333 (isometry) is
smaller than 0.001. However, the slope of a regression
fitted to both groups at once is 0.317, and the associated
probability of the slope not being different from 0.333
(isometry) is 0.148. The slopes of nocturnal and diurnal
species are not different (p = 0.126), which allows for
meaningful comparison of intercepts: the regression line
of nocturnal fish has a much higher intercept (0.671)
than that of diurnal species (0.506; p < 0.001). The calculation of intercepts using the common slope (0.289)
indicates that on average nocturnal reef teleosts have
eye diameters about 1.355 times larger than the eye diameters of diurnal species for given body mass. The delineation between nocturnal and diurnal groups is most

Figure 2 Relative eye size and optical ratios of nocturnal and diurnal teleost reef fish. Panel (a) shows that nocturnal reef teleosts (black
circles) have larger eye diameter for given body mass than diurnal species (yellow circles). Open circles are elopomorphs, which have very
elongated bodies that make a comparison with body mass as independent variable impossible. The plot of the square of lens diameter against
the product of eye diameter and axial length (OPTmorph1) reveals that nocturnal reef teleosts have a relatively large lens (b). Nocturnal fish have
more circular pupils than diurnal fish (c), and if one combines the pupil ratio with OPTmorph1, cancelling out the ratio of lens diameter and axial
length, a fairly clear delineation between groups of diel activity pattern emerges (d).

distinct for smaller fish, whereas there is considerable
overlap among large fish.
Differences between nocturnal and diurnal eye
morphology: Optical ratio and pupil shape

We tested for differences in the optical ratio, the ratio of
the square of optical aperture and the product of retinal
diameter and posterior nodal distance (OPT, [27,28,38],
please also see Methods) with several sets of morphological proxies. First, we plotted the square of lens

diameter against the product of eye diameter and axial
length (OPTmorph1, Figure 2b). The diurnal and nocturnal groups have slightly, but significantly different SMA
slopes (1.05 and 0.994, respectively; p = 0.003). Nocturnal fish tend to have larger squared lens diameters for a
given product of eye diameter and axial length, but
there is considerable overlap between groups especially
for large eyes (Figure 2b).
The delineation between nocturnal and diurnal species
with OPTmorph2 is worse. Small nocturnal fish tend to

Schmitz and Wainwright BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:338
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/338

have a slightly larger product of largest and smallest
pupil diameter for given product of eye diameter and
axial length, but the differences are absent for larger
eyes. Again, the SMA slopes of the nocturnal (1.082)
and diurnal groups (1.004) are different (p = 0.008).
The pupil shape of nocturnal and diurnal fish is different (Figure 2c). Nocturnal fish have a more circular
pupil than diurnal fish, as the plot of the smallest
against the largest pupil diameter shows. The slopes of
the regression lines of nocturnal (0.994) and diurnal
species (1.009) are similar (p = 0.371), but nocturnal fish
have a much higher intercept (-0.021, compared to
-0.063, p < 0.001). The circular shape of the pupils of
nocturnal teleosts effectively reduces their aphakic gaps,
i.e. the “lensless” part of the pupil. In diurnal fish, the
lens diameter is 82.5% of the long pupil axis, which
means that on average there is an aphakic gap equalling
17.5% of the largest pupil diameter. In nocturnal reef
teleosts this distance is significantly smaller (10.3%, p <
0.001, t-test). Allometry does not affect this ratio,
because lens diameter scales isometrically with the largest pupil diameter (p = 0.844).
The best delineation between groups of diel activity
pattern is achieved by OPT morph3 (Figure 2d), even
though some overlap remains. This ratio combines OPT
with pupil shape, and excludes traits that are involved in
functions other than light sensitivity (please also see
Methods). Nocturnal species have a larger product of
lens diameter and short axis of the pupil for a given product of eye diameter and long axis of the pupil. The
slopes of the two regression lines are slightly different
(nocturnal slope = 0.985, diurnal slope = 1.026, p =
0.001), with nocturnal species plotting above diurnal fish
with comparably little overlap at least for small eyes. The
differences become smaller for larger eyes (Figure 2d).
Differences between nocturnal and diurnal eye
morphology: Multivariate analyses

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on
eye diameter, axial length, and lens diameter, the same
variables used to calculate OPTmorph1, also indicates that
nocturnal species tend to have a larger lens for a given
eye size than diurnal species. The first principal component (PC 1) explains most of the variance in the data
(98.96%), and is characterized by nearly identical loading
on its three components (eye diameter: -0.579, axial
length: -0.576, and lens diameter: -0.577; Table 1).
Scores on PC 1 are strongly correlated with the geometric mean of all three variables (p < 0.001, R-squared
of SMA regression is > 0.999), in contrast to scores on
PC 2 (p = 0.975, R-squared < 0.001) and PC 3 (p =
0.504, R-squared < 0.001). Hence, PC 2 and 3 represent
differences in shape alone. PC 2 is formed by positive
loading on lens diameter (0.64) and also eye diameter

(0.118), but negative loading on axial length (-0.759), in
contrast PC 3 is formed by positive loading on eye diameter (0.807) and negative loading on both lens diameter (-0.507) and axial length (-0.303). On the basis of
these loadings species with high optical ratio, i.e., the
ratio of the square of lens diameter and the product of
eye diameter and axial length should plot in the bottom
right quadrant of morphospace.
Indeed, nocturnal species in our dataset tend to
occupy the lower right corner of the plot of PC 2 and
PC 3 (Figure 3a), even though there is considerable
overlap with diurnal fish. Nocturnal species that are
found in areas in morphospace outside the diurnal area
(minimum polygon fit) include most elopomorphs (Figure 3b), and the sciaenid Equetus punctatus. The nocturnal diodontid Diodon holocanthus and the serranid
Alphester afer are deep within the diurnal morphospace,
whereas the diurnal serranid Pseudogramma gregoryi is
far in the nocturnal morphospace. Despite the overlap a
MANOVA on the scores of PC 2 and 3 suggests differences in average shape between nocturnal and diurnal
groups (p < 0.001).
The PCA performed on the complete set of eye variables (eye diameter, axial length, lens diameter, largest
and smallest pupil diameters) reinforces differences
between nocturnal and diurnal reef fish. Again, PC 1
contains most of the variance (98.03%) and is strongly
positively correlated with the geometric mean of eye
variables (p < 0.001). All variables load uniformly on PC
1, ranging from -0.449 to -0.446. PC 2 through 5 are
independent of size and reflect differences in eye shape
(PC 2, p = 0.963; PC 3, p = 0.877; PC 4, p = 0.431; PC
5, p = 0.701; R-squared for all slopes (SMA regression)
< 0.001). Both largest and smallest pupil diameters load
negatively on PC 2 (-0.467 and -0.546), whereas eye

Combined variances of PCs 2 through 5

Figure 3 Principal component analyses (PCA) of eye measurements. We performed two different principal component analyses. One PCA
was carried out using three variables (eye diameter, axial length, and lens diameter) and the resulting scatterplot of scores on PC 2 and PC 3 is
illustrated in (a) and (b)). Panel (a) shows 95% confidence ellipses for nocturnal and diurnal groups; panel (b) demonstrates that elopomorphs
occupy distinct areas in morphospace. The second PCA was carried out with five variables (adding largest and smallest pupil diameter; (c)).
Vectors indicate magnitude and direction of loadings on PC axes. The plot of PC 3 against PC 2 shows in both analyses that nocturnal teleost
reef fish (black circles) occupy different areas in morphospace than diurnal reef teleosts (yellow circles). Nocturnal species occupy a smaller area
of morphospace. This is supported by the low combined variance of PC scores on all PC axes, calculated for the PCA with five variables, the
most complete description of eye morphology available. Uneven sample size does not drive this pattern as shown by the resampling
distribution for diurnal (yellow) and nocturnal (black) species. Ellipses represent 95% confidence ellipses for nocturnal and diurnal groups.

diameter and axial length load positively (0.371 and
0.586). Lens diameter has no effect on PC 2. PC 3 is
formed by positive loading on eye diameter (0.169), lens
diameter (0.519), and smallest pupil diameter (0.345),
while axial length (-0.368) and largest pupil diameter
(-0.670) have negative loading on PC 3. For a full list of
loadings on all PC axes please refer to Table 1.

The plot of PC 3 versus PC 2 (Figure 3c) reveals that
nocturnal reef fish are mostly confined to the top left
quadrant of eye morphospace, i.e., nocturnal species
have low scores on PC 2 and high scores on PC 3. On
the basis of the loadings on PC axes, low scores on PC
2 indicate large pupil size for a given eye size. High
scores on PC 3 indicate round pupil shape (maximizing

smallest pupil diameter for given largest pupil diameter)
and a large lens for a given axial length and largest
pupil diameter. Hence, nocturnal reef teleosts have relatively large and rounded pupils, and a large lens (Figures
4a, b), whereas diurnal teleosts tend to have smaller,
more elliptical pupils (Figures 4c, d). There is no strict
delineation in morphospace between groups; diurnal
reef fish widely overlap with nocturnal species. Again,
the nocturnal diodontid Diodon holocanthus and the
serranid Alphester afer, this time along with the lutjanid
Lutjanus apodus and the haemulid Haemulon parra, are
deep within the diurnal morphospace. However, a
MANOVA on the scores of PC 2 and 3 suggests a

significant difference in average shape between nocturnal and diurnal species (p < 0.001).
Discriminant analysis (DA) of eye variables confirms
differences between nocturnal and diurnal groups
among reef fish. DA of eye diameter, axial length, and
lens diameter - equivalent to the approach of Schmitz
and Motani (27, 38) - yields a misclassified proportion
of 12.45% for linear and flexible DA and 11.7% for
quadratic DA. Regularized DA performed slightly better
with 10.94% misclassified at regularization-lambdas of
0.55-0.74.
The inclusion of two additional variables (largest and
smallest pupil diameter) slightly improves the

discrimination. The misclassified proportion for linear,
quadratic, and flexible DA is 10.19%. The lowest misclassification results (8.3%) are with a regularized DA, at
regularization-lambdas of 0.1-0.11 and 0.14-0.18.
There are several nocturnal species that are classified
as diurnal by all applied DA types, using either three or
five variables. In particular apogonids have a large number of consistently misclassified species (Apogon margaritophorus, Apogon townsendi, Sphaeramia nematoptera,
Zoramia leptacantha). Other consistently misclassified
species are the tetraodontiform Diodon holocanthus and
the serranid Alphestes afer, both of which are clear outliers (Figures 3a, c), the haemulid Diagramma picta, as
well as the holocentrid Myripristis amaena. Similarly, all
applied DA types classify two diurnal species as nocturnal: the mullet Mugil cephalus and the lionfish Dendrochirus zebra. The lionfish also has very large relative eye
size (Figure 2a).
Diversity of nocturnal and diurnal eye morphology

We assessed the diversity of eye morphology by means
of the morphospace defined by all shape axes (PC axes
2-5) of the PCA of all five eye variables. The variance of
diurnal species (0.105) is about twice as large as the variance of nocturnal species (0.055). The rarefaction test
(re-sampling without replacement) that accounts for
uneven sample sizes in diurnal (n = 211) and nocturnal
sub-groups (n = 54) suggests that nocturnal species
indeed have lower variance in eye morphology than
diurnal fish (p < 0.001) (Figure 3d). The bootstrap distributions of nocturnal and diurnal species have two
clearly separate peaks. Similarly, nocturnal species have
much lower variance in all morphological approximations of OPT (OPTmorph1, nocturnal variance = 0.0005:
diurnal variance = 0.001; OPT morph2 , 0.0015:0.0031,
OPTmorph3, 0.0006:0.0013).

Discussion
Light levels are considered a major physical factor in the
evolution of eye shape [29,45-47]. Diel activity patterns
are the main mechanism controlling ambient light levels
of teleost reef fish. If light levels do indeed impact the
evolution of eye morphology in reef fish, then nocturnal
and diurnal species are expected to differ in eye size and
shape. We also postulated that stabilizing selection for
traits that improve light-sensitivity limits morphological
and functional diversity in nocturnal species. Our results
confirm all hypotheses, even though shape differences
are more subtle than what is observed in terrestrial
amniotes [27], which may be due to constraints of aquatic vision. The observed patterns for relative eye size
and optical ratios indicate that differences between nocturnal and diurnal eye morphology become less pronounced for absolutely larger eyes. This may indicate

Page 9 of 13

that neural summation by pooling of photoreceptor signals becomes more important in larger eyes, where the
negative effects of decreased acuity by summation could
be at least partially mitigated by the increase of focal
length with eye size.
The optical system of diurnal reef species, which are
active in mostly bright light environments, is characterized by photopic image formation. Some diurnal fish on
reefs may experience lower light levels depending on
microhabitats that locally reduce light availability, such
as crevices, reef overhangs, or other three-dimensionally
complex reef structures. Light levels exponentially
decrease with water depth, yet light levels equivalent to
star-lit night conditions on land are not reached until a
depth of approximately 600-700 m in clear ocean waters
that characterize most coral reef environments [48]. As
far as currently known, none of the species in our dataset are active at such depths. Even if one assumes
coastal visibility conditions for reefs, diurnal species do
not experience the dim ambient light levels of their nocturnal counterparts during their diel activity period. Several species in our dataset are known to enter water
with large amounts of suspended sediment and lower
ambient light levels. One of these species, the mullet
Mugil cephalus, appears to show characteristics of scotopic vision, but all in all it is diel activity pattern that
defines the ambient light levels experienced by the species we sampled. Nocturnal fish need to rely on scotopic
image formation and there is a clear perception of how
the optical system of nocturnal species should be shaped
in order to meet the requirements of scotopic vision
[27].
Differences between nocturnal and diurnal eye size and
morphology

Our results confirm the predictions from physiological
optics. Nocturnal teleost reef fish have much larger eyes
for given body mass than diurnal species, as shown by
the regression of eye diameter on body mass (Figure 1a).
On average, eye diameter of nocturnal species is about
1.4 times larger than that of diurnal reef teleosts for
given body mass. We assessed differences in eye shape
by means of morphological proxies of the optical ratio
(Figures 2b-d) and also multivariate analyses (PCA, Figures 3a-c, and DA). The eyes of nocturnal reef teleosts
differ from their diurnal counterparts in that they have
relatively large lens diameters and large, rounded pupils.
These characteristics should increase the amount of
light transmitted compared to a smaller lens and smaller
or asymmetric pupils. More light transmission should
enhance the brightness of the retinal image, which will
translate into better scotopic vision for a given retinal
structure and neurological processing. Interestingly, the
differences in relative eye size and eye shape fade to

Schmitz and Wainwright BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:338
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/338

some degree for larger species. The negative allometry
observed in the scaling of eye diameter with body mass
is in the range previously reported for fish [18,22,49],
although elasmobranchs seem to have much stronger
negative allometry [50].
The characteristics of a nocturnal eye seem to be present in nocturnal species independent of phylogeny,
indicating convergent morphological evolution. We
sampled nocturnal species from 12 different families
across Elopomorpha and the acanthomorph clades
Holocentridae and Percomorpha, and most species show
nocturnal characteristics. It is not clear at this point
how many independent nocturnal lineages are included
in our dataset, because the phylogenetic relationships of
these clades are not well studied. In particular the phylogenetic relationships among families of acanthomorphs, a group containing more than 16, 000 extant
species, is currently poorly understood [51] and is one
of the most challenging problems in vertebrate phylogenetics. On the basis of the current understanding of teleost phylogeny [51-53] and a conservative approach,
there are at least seven independent origins of nocturnality represented in the data. There is at least one origin
of nocturnality within elopomorphs (Congridae, Muraenidae, Ophichthidae) and one within holocentrids.
Within percomorphs, there are probably more than five
independent origins: apogonids+pempherids (Apogonoidei) as possible sister group to the diurnal Gobioidei
[54], one each within the largely diurnal Serranidae (e.g.,
Alphestes) and Tetraodontiformes (e.g., Diodon), and all
other sampled nocturnal families, i.e., Priacanthidae,
Haemulidae, Sciaenidae, Lutjanidae, which conservatively, even though unlikely, may represent a single nocturnal radiation.
The apparently constraining requirements on eye
shape in nocturnal teleost reef fish are similar to what
has been observed in terrestrial amniotes, where the
strongest correlation between structure (OPT) and function (ocular image formation) is found at Pagel’s l of
0.01 [28]. Pagel’s l is a measure of phylogenetic signal
in the data, and a value of nearly zero indicates minimal
phylogenetic signal [55]. It is possible that the phylogenetic bias in eye morphology of teleosts is somewhat larger, yet this cannot be evaluated until a reasonably wellresolved and time-calibrated phylogeny at the species
level is available.
Phylogenetic bias may be part of the reason why the
differences between eye shape of nocturnal and diurnal
teleost reef fish appear not as distinct as in terrestrial
amniotes. For example, a comparison of DA results for
the same measurements in each dataset (eye diameter,
axial length, lens diameter) shows that the misclassified
proportion tends to be larger within reef teleosts
(10.94%) than in terrestrial amniotes (4.92%, regularized

Page 10 of 13

DA, spherical eyes, [27]). A phylogenetically-informed
DA [28] can potentially improve correct classification.
It is also necessary to consider differences between
vision in air and in water. The cornea does not function
as a refractive surface in water, leaving the lens to provide all the light refraction required to focus the image
in an aquatic eye [56-58]. Thus, the lens alone performs
two main functions of the optical system. First, the lens
focuses light onto the retina (assuming emmetropia) and
sets the focal length. In terrestrial eyes both cornea and
lens provide this function, and there is some variation in
the proportional contributions to the total refractive
power of the eye [59] that leaves opportunity for morphological diversity. This variation is absent in aquatic
eyes, which are more or less built according to Matthiessen’s ratio [58]. In order to keep the eye and focal
length at a reasonable size, the refractive power of the
lens needs to be strong [16,58]. The increase in refractive power can be realized by shortening the radius of
curvature, resulting in a nearly spherical, small lens
[58-60]. Second, lens diameter is correlated with pupil
diameter, i.e., the aperture of the optical system, ensuring that most incoming light is focused onto the retina
and does not cause any blur and scattering. The dual
function may be an inherent structural limitation that
renders further improvement of scotopic image formation difficult. For example, if an eye had a larger lens for
a larger aperture, the larger radius of curvature of the
lens would also increase focal length, provided everything else stayed the same. However, there is some indication that the eyes of nocturnal reef fish have shorter
focal lengths [61], which may help to at least partially
overcome the structural limitation of having only one
refractive element. More data are needed to better
understand potential differences between optical qualities of the lens of nocturnal and diurnal species.
Further research is also needed for an improved
understanding of diel activity patterns in reef teleosts.
There is a pronounced nocturnal-diurnal turnover at
dusk and dawn among reef fish [5,62,63], but it is likely
that a dichotomous split into nocturnal and diurnal species does not fully capture the complexity of temporal
resource and habitat partitioning. Indeed, there is evidence that some reef teleosts may be active day and
night, but current data are insufficient to have a clear
understanding of possible cathemeral (day- and nightactive) or crepuscular (twilight-active) behaviour.
Furthermore, some species may display plasticity in
their diel activity pattern [34]. A third category as used
in the analysis of terrestrial amniotes [27,28] may
further improve the delineation between groups. Some
of the nocturnal and diurnal species that overlap in discriminant space may in fact be cathemeral or crepuscular species, which are expected to be intermediate in

Schmitz and Wainwright BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:338
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/338

shape and light-gathering power. Clearly, more behavioural data are needed to further investigate diel activity patterns in reef fish.
The eye shape of some nocturnal species does not
match the evolutionary response to scotopic vision seen
in other reef fish, even though their nocturnal behaviour
generally seems to be well supported. The pufferfish
Diodon holocanthus is nocturnal as an adult, but settles
from a planktonic mode of life at a standard length of
100-120 mm [personal communication, D.A. Bellwood].
As the three specimens of D. holocanthus that we
sampled are all around 105 mm, we cannot fully exclude
that there is an ontogenetic effect biasing the characterization of the ocular morphology of this species. In addition, some nocturnal species with ocular morphology
not matched to scotopic vision may rely on non-visual
senses (e.g., olfaction, lateral line system). Alternatively,
they may solve the problem of vision at low light levels
by modifications of parts of the visual system other than
ocular morphology, e.g., at the level of the retina. It will
be important in the future to expand this study to
include additional features related to optical sensitivity,
for example the diameter and length of photoreceptors
[9,37].
Morphological and functional diversity of nocturnal and
diurnal eyes

One of the main objectives of this paper was to characterize the pattern of eye morphospace occupation. We
chose the morphospace of the PCA performed on all
five measured variables (PC 2-5), representing the most
complete representation of eye shape. The results show
convincingly that nocturnal species are restricted to a
small area of morphospace compared to diurnal species.
Functionally, the area of nocturnal species is related to
improved scotopic image formation. Diurnal species,
which are released from the physical limitations of scotopic vision, have a much wider morphospace occupation. Diurnal fish occur within the area of good scotopic
vision, but also explore other parts of morphospace
such as areas that are characterized by small pupil area
for given eye size. Intriguingly, there is a trade-off
between scotopic image formation and depth of focus,
because a large pupil is positively correlated with light
sensitivity yet negatively linked with depth of focus [60].
In addition, some diurnal species have strongly elliptical
pupils with often rostrally placed aphakic gaps, which
supposedly enable them to focus on close objects in the
anterior field of view, and may also allow for binocular
vision [41]. An ability to focus on close objects in the
anterior field of view may be helpful to select benthic
prey items. The presence of other adaptive peaks, in
combination with the release from physical limitations
of scotopic image formation results in a larger

Page 11 of 13

morphospace occupation of diurnal species compared to
that of nocturnal species.
It is unlikely that this pattern of morphospace occupation is strongly influenced by phylogenetic bias. There
are two possible phylogenetic mechanisms that would
result in low variance in nocturnal taxa. First, if all nocturnal species were from a monophyletic clade they
would be expected to be similar morphologically simply
because of their shared evolutionary history. As
explained earlier, we sampled at least seven independent
origins of nocturnality, which should reduce this possible phylogenetic bias. Second, if all nocturnal radiations
are very young compared to diurnal clades and one
assumes a Brownian model of evolution, then the nocturnal clades are expected to have low variance, simply
because they had less time to diversify [64,65]. Timecalibrated phylogenies are not available yet and it is difficult to estimate the basal node ages of nocturnal and
diurnal clades. However, the fossil record indicates that
most nocturnal groups are of approximately the same
age as diurnal groups, as many extant reef teleost
families appear in the Eocene [19,66]. The appearance
of a large number of clades in a geologically brief time
interval is congruent with the difficulty to resolve phylogenetic relationships of the percomorph “bush”. We also
attempted to sample widely within a given clade, both
in terms of geographic provinces and known phylogenetic relationships, in order to avoid sampling a geologically young sub-clade. All in all, the phylogenetic
influence on morphospace occupation should be small,
and the low variance seen in the morphology of nocturnal reef fish seems to be the result of stringent functional requirements.
It will be an interesting avenue of future research to
analyze how the eyes of mesopelagic (150-1,000 mm
depth) fish have met the functional requirements of scotopic vision. For example, the presence of circumlental
aphakic gaps in some deep-water species has been interpreted as a mechanism to improve sensitivity to point
light sources like bioluminescent flashes [67,68]. Warrant and Lockett [69] have suggested that there are two
main eye shapes among these deep-water fish: the familiar ellipsoidal eye shape of shallow-water reef fish, and a
tubular eye shape reminiscent of the eyes of owls and
nocturnal primates, with large, spherical lenses, large
pupils but small eye diameter for given axial length.
Tubular eyes apparently represent a different solution to
the problem of scotopic vision. Our data suggest that
nocturnal reef teleosts have not followed these evolutionary pathways.

Conclusions
The requirements of scotopic image formation of nocturnal reef teleosts are met with a series of

Schmitz and Wainwright BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:338
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/338

modifications of eye morphology that are considered to
improve light sensitivity. These modifications come at
the cost of a smaller depth of focus and strong reduction of aphakic gaps. Diurnal species, freed from physical limitations of scotopic vision, have higher
morphological and optical diversity.
Diurnal fish also display enormous trophic diversity.
All major feeding guilds, i.e., herbivores, carnivores, and
omnivores are represented in the diurnal group, including specialists feeding on mobile and sessile benthic
prey, coral mucous, algae, nekton, zooplankton, and
ectoparasites [1,4,70]. This variety contrasts the limited
trophic diversity of nocturnal fish, which are mainly carnivores. Common prey items of nocturnal fish are
restricted to large elusive prey, mobile benthic invertebrates, and large zooplankton [1,2,13,15]. This uneven
distribution of trophic diversity in nocturnal and diurnal
teleost reef fish may possibly be related to the physical
challenge of prey detection at night and modalities of
sensory systems. In particular the visual system is
important for understanding ecological radiations in
nocturnal and diurnal lineages, because most reef fish
are highly visual foragers [10,11].
To conclude, diel activity patterns emerge as a major
factor in the morphological evolution of the eyes of
both terrestrial amniotes and teleost reef fish. In both
clades the physical requirements of scotopic vision are
met with similar morphological and optical modifications, highlighting the important role of physical characteristics of the environment in the evolution of
morphology.
