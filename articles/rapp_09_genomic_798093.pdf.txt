Abstract
Background: Allopolyploid speciation requires rapid evolutionary reconciliation of two diverged
genomes and gene regulatory networks. Here we describe global patterns of gene expression
accompanying genomic merger and doubling in inter-specific crosses in the cotton genus
(Gossypium L.).
Results: Employing a micro-array platform designed against 40,430 unigenes, we assayed gene
expression in two sets of parental diploids and their colchicine-doubled allopolyploid derivatives.
Up to half of all genes were differentially expressed among diploids, a striking level of expression
evolution among congeners. In the allopolyploids, most genes were expressed at mid-parent levels,
but this was achieved via a phenomenon of genome-wide expression dominance, whereby gene
expression was either up- or down-regulated to the level of one of the two parents, independent
of the magnitude of gene expression. This massive expression dominance was approximately equal
with respect to direction (up- or down-regulation), and the same diploid parent could be either the
dominant or the recessive genome depending on the specific genomic combination. Transgressive
up- and down-regulation were also common in the allopolyploids, both for genes equivalently or
differentially expressed between the parents.
Conclusion: Our data provide novel insights into the architecture of gene expression in the
allopolyploid nucleus, raise questions regarding the responsible underlying mechanisms of genome
dominance, and provide clues into the enigma of the evolutionary prevalence of allopolyploids.

Background
Polyploidy is prevalent in nature and is particularly common in the angiosperms, where it is both an ancient and
active evolutionary process [1-3]. In the past decade
expressed sequence tag (EST) and genome sequencing
projects revealed numerous rounds of ancient polyploidy
scattered throughout the angiosperms [4-6], confirming
and expanding upon more than a century of comparative
cytogenetic work [7,8], which demonstrated that polyploidy is common and ongoing in hundreds of genera. In

plants, polyploidy often is associated with novel and presumably advantageous ecological attributes, such as range
expansion [9], novel secondary chemistry and morphology [10], and increased pathogen resistance [11],
although the underlying genetic basis for these novel
adaptations remains obscure. The reunion of two diverged
genomes in a common nucleus during allopolyploid speciation entails a suite of genomic accommodations [1214], including non-additivity of gene expression [15,16],
and expression partitioning among tissues and organs

[17-20]. Of particular interest are the mechanisms by
which doubled regulatory networks interact to generate a
viable genetic system capable of regulating growth, development and responses to the environment.
To better understand the earliest stages of allopolyploid
evolution, we monitored gene expression in two sets of
diploid parents and their colchicine-doubled allopolyploid derivatives from the genus Gossypium (L.), which has
become a useful model for polyploid evolution [19-21].
Our goal was to determine the effects of genomic merger
and doubling on global gene expression architecture. To
our surprise, we discovered in both crosses a striking pattern of 'expression dominance', where gene expression for
thousands of genes closely mirrored that of only one of
the two parents, both for up-regulated and down-regulated genes. In addition, we also detected a diverse spectrum of transgressive gene expression types and levels.
Collectively, these results provide a novel perspective on
allopolyploid gene regulation and hint at the underlying
genetic basis of allopolyploid adaptation.

Results and discussion
To monitor gene expression in nascent allopolyploids we
grew two sets of diploid parents and their colchicine-doubled allopolyploid derivatives in a randomized complete
block design in three separate growth chambers. We
hybridized labeled leaf cDNAs to custom micro-arrays,
assaying 40,430 genes for their relative expression levels,
and determined for each gene the level of expression variation between the parents, between each parent and the
allopolyploid, and between the in silico mid-parent
expression value and the allopolyploid. Here, we take
mid-parent to mean the average of the empirically determined parental values, across all replicates (see the methods section). The general levels of differential expression
in these experiments are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.
We first evaluated differential expression between the two
diploid parents involved in each cross (G. arboreum (A2)
and G. bickii (G1); G. arboreum (A2) and G. thurberi (D1)),
postulating that the degree of parental divergence would
be correlated with the amount of non-additivity in their
respective synthetic allopolyploid (2(A2D1) and 2(A2G1)).
As all plants were grown under common controlled conditions, we expected only modest expression differentiation among diploids, but high levels of expression
divergence were observed; 42.0% and 53.0% of the
40,300 unigenes were differentially expressed between G.
arboreum (A-genome group) and G. bickii (G-genome
group), and G. arboreum and G. thurberi (D-genome
group), respectively (Figures 1 and 2, panels A). The larger
difference in the latter comparison is consistent with data
showing that the A and G genomes are more similar in
size and are phylogenetically closer to each other than

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/18

either is to the D genome [21]. All three species are shrubs
native to arid regions but are from three different continents (G. arboreum from Africa, G. bickii from Australia,
and G. thurberi from North America), having diverged
from a common ancestor approximately 5 to 10 million
years ago [21]. Their extraordinary gene expression divergence was unexpected given an average coding sequence
divergence of about 3% [22], and represents the greatest
divergence reported to date among congeneric plant species [16,23]. Among the differentially expressed genes,
equivalent proportions are up-regulated in each parent
(18.2% (G. arboreum, A2) versus 23.8% (G. bickii, G1) and
27.5% (G. arboreum, A2) versus 25.5% (G. thurberi, D1); P
> 0.05 in χ-square tests).
To assess the impact of combining two diverged regulatory networks on gene expression in allopolyploids, we
contrasted each parent with the allopolyploid, and the
allopolyploid with an in silico mid-parent value, generated
using an average of the parental values and a composite
variance. A high fraction of genes were differentially
expressed between the allopolyploids and the parental
diploids (27.5% and 38.7%, in 2(A2G1) and 2(A2D1),
respectively). Also, and perhaps as expected, most genes
in the allotetraploid were expressed at values equivalent
to the mid-parent, namely, 99.0% and 93.9% in 2(A2G1)
and 2(A2D1), respectively.
This observation of largely mid-parent expression masks
an important underlying phenomenon, which we model
in Figure 3. Specifically, for genes that differ in expression
between the two parents, expression levels in the allopolyploid may be statistically equivalent both to one parent
and the mid-parent, while these latter two values are statistically unequal themselves (Figure 3). Moreover, and
importantly, all three of the foregoing values statistically
differ from that of the other parent. The critical observation is that the dominant parent is recurrent for thousands
of genes. Thus, allopolyploids display a strong expression
bias, where expression is statistically equivalent to one of
the two parents. This is true for both up-regulated and
down-regulated genes. Hence, we term this phenomenon
'expression dominance'.
To explore and categorize the expression alterations
accompanying polyploid formation, we binned genes
into the 12 possible patterns of differential expression for
an allopolyploid and two parents (Figures 4 and 5) [24].
For genes differentially expressed between the parents, the
most common result in both allopolyploids was the
expression dominance of one parental expression phenotype, as described above, where expression dominance is
operationally diagnosed as statistical equivalence of
expression between the allopolyploid and its respective
parent. Specifically, dominance of the paternal G. thurberi

Differential
Differential expression and genome-wide expression dominance in Gossypium allopolyploids. A. Synthetic allopolyploid 2(A2D1) generated from the diploid parents G. arboreum and G. thurberi. G. arboreum was the maternal parent in each
cross. Bold text indicates the total number and fraction of genes diagnosed as differentially expressed in each contrast. Also
shown for each contrast is the partitioning of the total number of differentially expressed genes into the direction of up-regulation; these numbers are indicated by the non-bold text. For example, in panel A, 13,863 genes are indicated as being differentially expressed between G. arboreum and the synthetic allopolyploid. Of these, 7792 were up-regulated in the synthetic
allopolyploid, and 6071 were up-regulated in G. arboreum. Differential expression between each allopolyploid and its in silico
mid-parent is shown in the middle of each triangle. Around 53.0% of the 40,430 unigenes were differentially expressed
between diploids, with a range of 4.4% to 34.3% between diploids and their allopolyploid derivatives. Expression dominance is
illustrated by the eight-fold asymmetries in differential expression between the allopolyploids and their diploid antecedents. B.
Genes were ordered by their normalized, standardized expression intensity in the allopolyploid (black line). The expression
intensity of the parents was superimposed (maternal = blue; paternal = green) to illustrate the expression level similarity
between the dominant genome and the allopolyploid. Thus, variance around the green dots (the dominant genome) is lower
than around the blue dots. Thus, expression dominance is bidirectional with respect to the status of the G. arboreum expression phenotypes in the two allopolyploids.

genome in the 2(A2D1) allopolyploid included nearly
11,000, or almost half, of all differentially expressed
genes, with 52.1% being up-regulated to the paternal
expression level and 47.9% down-regulated to the paternal expression level (panels II and XI in Figure 4A). Similarly, an expression dominance of a single parent exists in
2(A2G1), where about 5000 genes adopted the expression
state of one parent, in this case G. arboreum, and again
with approximately equal proportions (44% and 55%) of
up- and down-regulation (Figures 4 and 5).
An additional dimension of this phenomenon is that
expression dominance in the allopolyploid nucleus was
reversed in the two systems; in 2(A2D1), the bulk of gene
expression divergence was unequal to that from the
maternal G. arboreum parent (or G. arboreum was 'expression recessive'), while this same parent displayed expression dominance in 2(A2G1). The magnitude of expression
dominance was unequal in the two allopolyploids and
was most extreme in the 2(A2D1) allopolyploid, where
only 1769 genes were differentially expressed in leaves
between the allopolyploid and the paternal parent, but
eight times as many genes (13,863), representing fully a
third of the genes on the chip, were differentially
expressed in leaves between the allopolyploid and the
maternal parent. These data constitute evidence for bidirectional, genome-wide expression dominance in allopolyploids, the direction of which may vary with the specific
genomic combination involved.
The scope of expression dominance reported here is
unprecedented, and suggests that the observation of midparent expression in allopolyploids (Figures 1 and 2)
[15], while statistically correct, fails to capture the underlying dynamics of regulatory interactions that lead to
genome-wide preferential expression of the phenotype
contributed by one of the two genomes in an allopolyploid nucleus. In this light it seems likely that the statistical and analytical techniques used here would reveal that
genomic dominance is more widespread than reported in
Arabidopsis, where gene expression was studied in F1
hybrids between two allopolyploids [15]. Similar to our
results for polyploid Gossypium, in Arabidopsis hybrids a
relatively small percentage (5% to 6% in their case) of
genes were differentially expressed in comparison to the
mid-parent value. Of these, the general pattern observed
was global repression (down-regulation) in the hybrid,
with greater repression of genes that were up-regulated in
A. thaliana (with respect to A. arenosa) than the reverse.
Thus, for this small fraction of the total genes in the dataset that were studied (that is, only around the 5% that
were differentially expressed from the mid-parent), there
was differential expression repression in the hybrid with
respect to the two parents. They did not explore the phenomenon of expression dominance for the greater than

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/18

95% of genes that were not differentially expressed from
the mid-parent, an exploration that requires a categorically partitioned analysis of the full set of genes (cf. Figures 4 and 5). Thus, a newly discovered phenomenon
associated with allopolyploidy is revealed in the present
study, namely, global phenotypic expression dominance
for both up- and down-regulated genes.
Although bidirectional expression dominance comprises
the most common category of gene expression, all other
expression possibilities were observed (Figures 4 and 5) in
both allopolyploid systems studied, that is, 2(A2G1) and
2(A2D1). This includes transgressive up- and down-regulation in the allopolyploid, both for genes equivalently (Figures 4 and 5, panels VIII and VII, respectively, for up- and
down-regulation) or differentially (Figures 4 and 5, panels
V and VI, and III and X, respectively, for up- and downregulation) expressed between the parents. Interestingly,
although comparable numbers of genes exhibited statistically transgressive expression in the two allopolyploids
(606 and 490 in 2(A2G1) and 2(A2D1), respectively), six
times as many genes were up-regulated as down-regulated
in 2(A2D1) (421 versus 69), whereas in 2(A2G1) the opposite trend was observed (190 up, 416 down). In addition,
genes with novel down-regulation tended to have lower
than average standardized expression, whereas, the converse is not true for genes with novel up-regulation (panels IV and IX in Figure 4).
It is tempting to speculate that genome-wide expression
dominance and transgressive expression are connected to
novel plant phenotypes and physiologies in allopolyploids. To explore this, we utilized Gene Ontology (GO)
classifications for molecular and cellular function, coupled with Fisher's exact test, to identify processes over-represented in differentially expressed genes [25]. Between
the genome-dominant parent and the allopolyploid, no
significant terms emerge in either allopolyploid (Additional file 1), although we note that the non-genomedominant parent largely shares the same differences from
the allopolyploid as it does from the genome-dominant
parent. Interestingly, genes transgressively transcribed in
the allopolyploid are enriched for GO terms pertaining to
cofactor binding, coenzyme binding, electron transport,
oxioreductase activity, lyase activity, and the generation of
precursor metabolites and energy, giving credence to the
molecular underpinnings of the ecologically advantageous traits often seen in allopolyploids.

Conclusion
Here we have shown that polyploidy in cotton is characterized by bidirectional genome-wide expression dominance, depending on the specific species combination
and independent of the magnitude of gene expression. We
also report massive expression divergence among diploid

congeners in a common environment and the manner in
which these differences become reconciled in a nascent
polyploid. Our study illustrates the panoply of expression
outcomes that duplicate genetic loci experience when
divergent genomes become newly merged in a unified regulatory cellular milieu. At present the mechanistic underpinnings of expression dominance of a single genome in
an allopolyploid remain elusive. Among the possibilities
are asymmetries in the genomic distribution of methylation and other epigenetic marks, as suggested by recent
work with met1 RNAi knockdowns in synthetic Arabidopsis
polyploids, where expression differences in the allopolyploid were shown to be related to de novo changes in
methylation [26]. Unlike Arabidopsis, methylation
changes do not appear to accompany polyploidy in cotton [27], suggesting that the global expression dominance
in this system is due to another mechanism, or likely, a
suite of epigenetic mechanisms [28-31].
Notwithstanding our ignorance of the mechanism(s)
responsible for expression dominance, this phenomenon,
and indications of transgressive expression, provide clues
into the enigma of the evolutionary success of allopolyploids. Future insights will derive from integrating shifts
in gene expression into functional analyses in an ecologically relevant context, as well as from increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which they
occur [14].

Statistical
Statistical interpretations of differential expression
between parental diploids, their allopolyploid derivative, and an in silico mid-parent. The vertical axis represents relative expression level. Each taxon is labeled and
color-coded with its corresponding error bar. Lanes 1 and 2
represent two separate genes with expression patterns like
those in Figure 4 panels XI and II, respectively. For the first
gene (lane 1), expression is higher in the D-genome than in
the A-genome diploid parent. Expression in the D genome is
statistically equivalent to that of the allopolyploid but not to
the mid-parent (indicated by non-overlapping error bars),
while expression in the allopolyploid is equivalent to both the
mid-parent and the D-genome diploid. All three of the above,
however, are differentially expressed relative to the Agenome diploid parent. The reverse situation is illustrated in
lane 2, where expression in the D-genome parent is lower
than that of the A-genome parent, rather than higher. Notice
that in both lanes, expression in the allopolyploid mimics that
of one parent, in this case the D genome, illustrating the general phenomenon of expression dominance of a single
genome for both up- and down-regulated genes.

Plant material
Two synthetic allopolyploids and their diploid progenitors were used: (1) 2(A2G1) (Hyb-612 in Swanson-Wagner et al. [24]) was created by colchicine-doubling the
hybrid between G. arboreum (accession no. 5265, as
female) and G. bickii (accession no. 5048); (2) 2(A2D1) is
a synthetic allopolyploid generated from the diploids G.
arboreum (as female) and G. thurberi [33]. Ploidy level of
the synthetic allopolyploids used has been confirmed by
cytogenetic analysis [33-36]. These allopolyploids are
largely phenotypically intermediate with respect to their
diploid progenitors at the gross morphological level,
although flower size is notably increased. The seeds used
for this experiment were the C3 (post-colchicine doubling) generation for the 2(A2G1) material and fresh seed
from a living, perpetually grown descendent of Beasley's
original amphidiploid for the 2(A2D1). Seeds were scarified and germinated under high humidity in a 1:1 mix of
sand and soil. Five plants of each taxon were grown in a
randomized complete block design in each of three
growth chambers in the Center for Plant Responses to
Environmental Stresses in Bessey Hall, Iowa State Univer-

Partitioning of expression patterns in allopolyploid Gossypium, A- and D-genome contrast
Partitioning of expression patterns in allopolyploid Gossypium, A- and D-genome contrast. Graphs inset into panels I to XII represent the possible expression patterns between two diploids and an allopolyploid derivative, where statistically
differential expression is indicated by different vertical levels in each graph. Thus, for example, panel I in shows genes for which
the paternal parent was differentially expressed and up-regulated relative to the allopolyploid, and the latter was up-regulated
relative to the maternal parent. The total number of genes falling into each category is shown (N), as are the density distributions of expression levels (y-axis) for the genes involved in that particular expression pattern (maternal = dark blue; paternal =
green; allopolyploid = light blue). In each of panels I to XII the x-axis represents standardized expression intensity. The average
for the entire experiment is shown in each panel as the black horizontal line. All categories of gene expression are observed in
both allopolyploids, although in remarkably different ratios (See Figure 5). Expression dominance of the paternal, G. thurberi
genome in 2(A2D1) is shown by panels II and XI in Figure 4 (contrast with IV and IX), whereas the same phenomenon is shown
(albeit to a lesser extent) for the G. arboreum genome in 2(A2G1) (same panels and contrast, Figure 5). In both cases, expression dominance reflects approximately equal amounts of up- and down-regulation to mimic the expression phenotype of the
dominant parent. Transgressive up-regulation in each allopolyploid is partitioned into the possible constitutive categories and is
shown by panels V, VI, and VIII; similarly, down-regulation is shown by panels III, VII, and X. The middle panel in each figure
shows the distribution of expression divergence of each parent relative to the polyploid, with the maternal contrast on the y
axis and the paternal contrast on the x axis, with colors corresponding to those used in the insets in panels I to XII.

Figure 5
Partitioning of expression patterns in allopolyploid Gossypium, A- and G-genome contrast
Partitioning of expression patterns in allopolyploid Gossypium, A- and G-genome contrast. Graphs inset into panels I to XII represent the possible expression patterns between two diploids and an allopolyploid derivative, where statistically
differential expression is indicated by different vertical levels in each graph. The specific features of this figure and its relationship to Figure 4 are described in Figure legend 4.
sity. Plants were grown at 26°C with 12-hour days, and
watered as necessary. Plants were repotted into standard
gallon containers after 3 weeks.
RNA extraction and micro-array hybridization
The third through fifth fully expanded true leaves were
harvested, divided into 1 g packets, flash-frozen in liquid
N2 and stored at -80°C until extraction. RNA was extracted
from five individuals from each of three growth chambers
using a hot borate extraction/lithium chloride precipitation [37]. Equimolar amounts of high-quality RNA
(assessed using a Bioanalyzer, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) were mixed from each of three individuals. Three
replicates (corresponding to growth chambers) were
hybridized to custom oligonucleotide micro-arrays using

proprietary Nimblegen (Roche Nimblegen, Madison, WI,
USA) protocols. These micro-arrays, described elsewhere
[19,20], were designed using EST data from diploid A- and
D-genome species as well as allopolyploid cotton [38],
designed to minimize mismatch by selecting conserved
sequence between species. Probes were designed from
regions of overlap between the A- and D-genome species,
where no sequence divergence had arisen. Additionally,
whenever possible, probes were picked from regions of
overlap with the AD-genome ESTs as well. The exonic
sequence divergence between the A- and D-genome species < 1%, making the likelihood of broad-scale sequence
mismatch on the chips unlikely [39]. Additionally, the G
genome is more closely related to the A genome than D,
suggesting that level of mismatch in our set of 60 mers is

well below 1% [39]. The utility of these arrays and data
validation using independent methods (quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction and Sequenom mass array
technologies) have been presented elsewhere [40,41].
Statistical analysis
We employed standard micro-array data analysis techniques, as follows. Our Nimblegen platform assays each
gene with a mean of seven unique probes per gene. To
arrive at an estimate of expression for each unigene, we
combined the probe values on a per-gene basis using
Tukey's Biweight estimator [42]. In R software [43], the
natural log of the intensity for each unigene was mediancentered and scale-normalized. Estimates of gene expression were used to fit a linear model in SAS software taking
the form:

y ij = m + d i + s j + e ij ,
where yij is the normalized expression intensity of a unigene, μ is the intercept, δI is the fixed effect of genotype i,
with the random effect of replication sj, and the random
error term ei. For each gene, we estimated the log-fold
expression difference of four contrasts: the diploid parents
to each other, each diploid parent to the allopolyploid
and the mid-parent value to the allopolyploid. The midparent expression value was constructed in SAS software's
PROC MIXED by down-weighting each parent in the contrast statement by 0.5; such an approach uses the pooled
variance of both parental measures. The distribution of P
values for each estimate was controlled for a false discovery rate using the method of Storey and Tibshirani [44] at
a level of 0.05. Genes that were significantly differentially
expressed were binned into classes using conditional
statements, considering standardized expression levels
and the statistical relationship between contrasts of interest. To explore the distribution of expression intensities
among the 12 possible categories of expression patterns
among two diploids and their derived allopolyploid, we
mapped the kernel density of expression for each species
using the density estimator in the R software package.
These were plotted on a standardized scale against the
experimental mean to illustrate inter-specific comparisons.
