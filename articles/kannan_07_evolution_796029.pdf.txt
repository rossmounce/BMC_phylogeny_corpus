Abstract
Background: The cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain regulates signaling pathways in both
eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In this study, we analyze the evolutionary information embedded in
genomic sequences to explore the diversity of signaling through the CNB domain and also how the
CNB domain elicits a cellular response upon binding to cAMP.
Results: Identification and classification of CNB domains in Global Ocean Sampling and other
protein sequences reveals that they typically are fused to a wide variety of functional domains. CNB
domains have undergone major sequence variation during evolution. In particular, the sequence
motif that anchors the cAMP phosphate (termed the PBC motif) is strikingly different in some
families. This variation may contribute to ligand specificity inasmuch as members of the prokaryotic
cooA family, for example, harbor a CNB domain that contains a non-canonical PBC motif and that
binds a heme ligand in the cAMP binding pocket. Statistical comparison of the functional constraints
imposed on the canonical and non-canonical PBC containing sequences reveals that a key arginine,
which coordinates with the cAMP phosphate, has co-evolved with a glycine in a distal β2-β3 loop
that allosterically couples cAMP binding to distal regulatory sites.
Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that CNB domains have evolved as a scaffold to sense a wide
variety of second messenger signals. Based on sequence, structural and biochemical data, we
propose a mechanism for allosteric regulation by CNB domains.

Background

The cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain is a conserved
signaling module that has evolved to respond to second messenger signals such as cAMP and cGMP [1,2]. The CNB
domain is ubiquitous in eukaryotes and controls a variety of
cellular functions in a cAMP/cGMP dependent manner.

Some of the well characterized CNB domain containing families in eukaryotes include: the protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit that regulates the activity of PKA [3,4]; the
guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates nucleotide
exchange in small GTPases [5]; and the ion channels that regulate metal ion gating (reviewed in [6]).

CNB domains also occur in prokaryotes. The first characterized family containing a CNB domain in prokaryotes is the
CAP (catabolite gene activator protein) family of transcriptional regulators [7] that contain a DNA binding helix-turnhelix (HTH) domain covalently linked to the CNB domain [8].
This domain organization is important for CAP function as it
couples cAMP binding functions of the CNB domain with
DNA binding functions of the HTH domain [9]. The CAP family is functionally diverse and, in addition to cAMP, responds
to other exogenous signals, such as carbon monoxide (CO)
and nitric oxide (NO) (reviewed in [10]). The cooA subfamily,
for instance, responds to CO signals and binds a heme ligand
in the cAMP binding pocket [11]. Likewise, the CprK subfamily of transcriptional regulators binds to ortho-chlorophenolic compounds in the cAMP binding pocket [12].
Crystal structures of CNB domains from both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes have been determined and their structural comparison reveals a conserved mode of cAMP recognition [1]
and regulation (reviewed in [13]). CNB domains are characterized by an eight stranded beta barrel domain (beta subdomain) [14] that is conserved among all CNB domain
containing proteins [1]. A key structural region within the
beta subdomain is the phosphate binding cassette (PBC) that
anchors the phosphate group of cAMP [15]. CNB domains
also contain a helical subdomain (henceforth called alpha
subdomain), which, unlike the beta subdomain, is more variable in sequence and structure. The helical subdomain is also
a docking site for the catalytic subunit of PKA [16].
An emerging theme in CNB domain signaling is the allosteric
control of CNB domain functions. In the PKA regulatory subunit, for instance, cAMP binding to the beta subdomain
causes conformational changes in the distal alpha subdomain, thereby releasing its inhibitory interactions with the
catalytic subunit [17]. This propagation of the cAMP signal to
distal regulatory sites was suggested to involve specific
regions in the beta subdomain [18]. Specifically, a loop connecting the β2 and β3 strands (β2-β3 loop) was shown to
undergo large chemical shift changes upon binding to cAMP
[18]. While these and other studies have provided important
insights into PKA allostery, it is not known whether this mode
of regulation is unique to the PKA regulatory subunit or is
conserved among other members of the CNB domain superfamily. Here, we address this question by extracting and analyzing the evolutionary information encoded within CNB
domain containing sequences. Towards this end, we have
identified nearly 7,700 CNB domain containing proteins, and
classified them into 30 distinct families. A systematic comparison of these families reveals that the CNB domains
recombine with a wide variety of functional domains to
respond to diverse cellular signals. Statistical comparison of
the evolutionary constraints imposed on CNB domain
sequences reveals that the residues that anchor the phosphate
group of cAMP (within the beta subdomain) have co-evolved
with residues in the β2-β3 loop. Analyzing these residues in

light of existing structural and biochemical data provides a
model of allostery that is conserved through evolution.
In the following sections, we first describe the identification
and classification of CNB domains to illustrate the diversity of
this protein family, and later show how a comparative analysis of CNB domain sequences has provided insights into the
evolution of allostery.

Results and discussion
Identification and classification of CNB domains in the
public and Global Ocean Sampling data
Cyclic nucleotide binding domains in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information's non-redundant amino acid
database (NR) and Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) [19,20]
data were identified using a combination of psi-blast profiles
and motif models (see Materials and methods). This resulted
in nearly 5,241 significant hits in NR and 2,455 hits in the
GOS data. Most of the identified sequences were multidomain proteins in that they contained other functional
domains covalently linked to the CNB domain. Because these
functional domains play an important role in CNB domain
functions, they were used as markers for annotation and classification (see below).
The 7,696 CNB domain containing sequences can be classified into 30 distinct families (Figure 1) based on the sequence
similarity within the CNB domain (see Materials and methods). These 30 families are predominantly eukaryotic or bacterial in origin (Table 1). The only significant hit in Archea
was to a hypothetical protein (gi: 11498576) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. CNB domains in eukaryotes can be broadly
classified into five major categories: the kinase domain associated PKA and PKG families; the guaninine nucleotide
exchange factor (Epac's); transmembrane domain containing
HCN and Na channels; HCN type channels in protozoans;
and CNB domains in metazoans and plants that are fused to
functional domains such as PAS domains, PP2C like phosphatases and phospholipases ('Other_Eukaryotic' in Table 1).
Several of these families/subfamilies are lineage-specific and
contain domain combinations that have not been reported
before. The PP2C like phosphatase, for instance, is a plant
specific subfamily that contains a kinase domain carboxy-terminal of the CNB domain. The co-occurrence of kinases,
phosphatase and CNB domains in the same operon is interesting because previous bioinformatics analysis had failed to
provide any evidence for a cAMP or cGMP dependent regulation of kinase activity in plants [21].
CNB domains are also prevalent in prokaryotes and some of
the major groups include: the CRP family members (Marr,
Arsr, AsnC, ICLR, GNTR) that contain a DNA binding domain
covalently linked to the CNB domain; and a distinct class of
DNA binding domain containing proteins (NnR, ArcR, Fnr
and FixK) that are activated by second messenger signals

An autogenously regulated activator of asparagine

such as NO, oxygen and heme [10]. In addition, our analysis
reveals several novel families (CBS, HisK and AAA ATPases)
in prokaryotes that lack the DNA binding domain, but conserve other functional domains (Table 1) such as histidine
kinases (HisKs), cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) domains
and AAA ATPases (AAA_Atpases in Table 1).

Expansion of transcriptional regulators in the Global Ocean Sampling
data
Most of the GOS sequences, as expected, are prokaryotic in
origin since they belong to families that are exclusively
prokaryotic (Table 1). In particular, the CAP/CRP family,
which contains a DNA binding domain covalently linked to
the CNB domain and is implicated in the transcriptional
regulation of genes, is greatly expanded in the GOS data
(Table 1). The expansion of this family in the GOS data suggests that transcriptional regulation of many genes in oceanic
microorganisms may be controlled in a cAMP or cGMP
dependent manner. Also, the diversity displayed by the GOS
sequences in the CAP family suggests that this family may
regulate a wide variety of operons, in addition to the well
studied lac operon [22]. In addition to the CAP family, the
NtcA family (Table 1), which is involved in nitrogen fixing in
cyanobacteria [23], is also expanded in the GOS data. More
than half the GOS sequences fall into the 'Other_Bacterial'
family (table 1), which is poorly characterized. This family is
highly diverse and contains several distinct sub-families that
are associated with functional domains such as Rhodanases,
Chey response regulators and DUF domains (Table 1). Thus,

GOS data greatly contribute to the diversity of the CNB superfamily and enable the use of statistical methods to understand
how sequence divergence contributes to functional divergence (see below).

Diversity in prokaryotes
Until now, the primary function of CNB domains in prokaryotes was believed to be in the transcriptional regulation of
genes. However, our analysis suggests that other cellular
processes, such as ATP production, protein phosphorylation
and NADH production, may also involve CNB domain functions (Table 1). Of particular interest is the CBS domain associated CNB domains. CBS domains are known to function as
sensors of cellular energy levels in eukaryotes as they are activated by AMP and inhibited by ATP. They are also implicated
in various hereditary diseases in humans [24]. The function
of CBS domains in prokaryotes, however, is poorly understood, although the crystal structure of a CBS domain from
Thermotoga maritime has been determined as part of the
structural genomics initiative [25]. The occurrence of both a
CBS domain and a CNB domain in the same open reading
frame suggests that, in some bacteria, ATP levels may be regulated in a cAMP-dependent manner. Structurally characterizing the full-length protein (CBS + CNB domain) may shed
light on this regulatory mechanism in prokaryotes.
Other novel domains in prokaryotes that are fused to CNB
domains include the HisKs that are involved in bacterial two
component signaling, and the AAA class of ATPases

(AAA_Atpases in Table 1) that control a wide variety of cellular functions in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes [26].

A conserved core shared by the entire superfamily
While the functional domain linked to the CNB domain is
unique to a given family or subfamily, the CNB domain is
shared by the entire superfamily. A multiple alignment of
nearly 7,000 CNB domain sequences (Figure 2) reveals key
sequence motifs that are shared by the entire superfamily
(Figure 2). These residues/motifs define the core of the CNB
domain. Several of these core residues correspond to glycines
(Gly159, Gly166, Gly178, Gly195, and Gly199) that are located
in loops connecting the beta strands of the beta subdomain
(Figure 3). Note that the residue numbers correspond to PKAmouse numbering in Figure 2. The most conserved of these
glycines is Gly178, which is located in the β3-β4 loop and
adopts a main-chain conformation (phi = 85.0; psi = -176.5)
that is disallowed for other amino acids in the Ramachandran
map. The role of Gly178 is not obvious from crystal structure
analysis; however, the remarkable conservation of this residue across diverse eukaryotic and prokaryotic phyla suggests
an important role in CNB domain structure and function.

In addition to the conserved glycines, CNB domains also conserve a hydrophobic core in the alpha and beta subdomains.
The hydrophobic core in the alpha subdomain is formed by
residues Phe136, Ile147, Tyr229, and Ile224, while the core in
the beta subdomain is formed by residues Ile175, Met180,
Val213, Val162, Phe198 and Tyr173 (Figures 2 and 4a). Comparison of the cAMP-bound and the catalytic subunit-bound
structures of the PKA regulatory subunit (R1alpha) reveals
that while the hydrophobic core in the beta subdomain is relatively stable in the two functional states, the hydrophobic
core in the alpha subdomain is malleable and undergoes a
conformational change upon binding to the catalytic subunit
(Figure 4b). In particular, Tyr229, which packs up against the
PBC in the cAMP-bound structure moves away from the PBC
upon binding to the catalytic subunit (Figure 4b). Likewise,
Phe136, which typically points away from the PBC, moves
closer toward the PBC upon binding to the catalytic subunit.
These coordinated changes in the helical subdomain were
recently proposed to function as a latch for gating cAMP [13]
and also shield cAMP from solvent. The conservation of these
core residues across diverse families suggests that the
conformational changes in the alpha subdomain may be a
fundamental feature of all CNB domain functions.

Conserved features of the CNB domain
Conserved features of the CNB domain. A contrast hierarchical alignment showing conserved residues/motifs shared by the entire superfamily. The
histograms above the alignments plot the strength of the selective constraints imposed at each position. Secondary structure is indicated directly above the
aligned sequences with β-strands indicated by their number designations (that is, 1-7 correspond to the β1-β7 strands, respectively) and helices by their
letter designations. The leftmost column of each alignment shows the sequences used in the display alignment. See Materials and methods for sequence
identifiers. The background alignment of all CNB domain containing sequences are shown indirectly via the consensus patterns and corresponding
weighted residue frequencies ('wt_res_freqs') below the display alignment. (Such sequence weighting adjusts for overrepresented families in the
alignment.) The residue frequencies are indicated in integer tenths where, for example, a '5' indicates that the corresponding residue directly above it
occurs in 50-60% of the weighted sequences. Biochemically similar residues are colored similarly with the intensity of the highlighting proportional to how
strikingly foreground residues contrast with background residues.

Functional diversity of the CNB module: a common
scaffold to sense diverse ligands
Having delineated the core residues/motifs of the CNB superfamily, we focused on motifs that contribute to the functional
specificity of individual families. In particular, we focused on
the PBC region (Figure 5a), which displays a strikingly different pattern of conservation in some families (Figure 5b). The
canonical sequence motif in the PBC region is the FGE
[L,I,V]AL [LIMV]X [PV]R209 [ANQV] motif, where X is any
amino acid. A key residue within this motif is a conserved
arginine (Arg209), which coordinates with the phosphate
group of cAMP (Figure 5c). While mutation of this arginine to
a lysine in PKA reduces the affinity for cAMP by nearly tenfold [27], some eukaryotic families, such as PDZ_GEF (PDZ
domain associated family closely related to Epac), naturally

contain a methionine or histidine at the Arg209 position (Figure 5b). Although the functional implications of this variation
in PDZ_GEF (Figure 5d) are currently unclear, it is likely that
this may alter the affinity for cAMP or facilitate binding of a
different small molecule ligand. Notably, in the crystal
structure of PDZ_GEF, which was solved as part of the
RIKEN structural genomics initiative, the region analogous to
the PBC region in PKA adopts a strikingly different conformation (Figure 5d) and is not bound to any ligand.

Sequence variation within the PBC region contributes to ligand
specificity
Several families in prokaryotes conserve a non-canonical PBC
motif. Some of these include the transcriptional regulators
FixK, FnR, ArcR, NnR and ARSR (Figure 5b). Within the

FixK, or cooA family, for instance, the observed sequence variation within the PBC region appears to contribute to ligand
specificity inasmuch as the cooA family binds to a heme ligand in the cAMP binding pocket (Figure 5e). In the crystal
structure of cooA, a conserved histidine, which occupies a
position that is structurally analogous to Arg209 in PKA,
coordinates with the heme and plays a key role in cooA activation [11]. Likewise, in the crystal structure of the transcriptional regulator CrpK bound to chlorophenolacetic acid [12],
a structurally analogous asparagine (Asn92) residue hydrogen bonds to chlorophenolacetic acid (Figure 5f).

Evolution of allostery in the CNB module
The ability of the CNB domain to bind to diverse ligands
raises an important question: what features distinguish the
cAMP binding families (ones that conserve a canonical PBC
motif) from those that bind to other ligands? In order to
address this question we used the CHAIN (Contrast Hierarchical Alignment and Interaction Network analysis) program,
which quantifies the differences between two functionally
divergent groups of sequences using statistical methods [28].
Using this program, we identified sequence features that distinguish the canonical PBC motif containing CNB domains
from those that lack the canonical PBC motif. Analyzing these
features in light of existing structural and biochemical data

provides a model for allosteric regulation, which is likely conserved in all cAMP binding modules.

Selective constraints distinguishing the canonical PBC containing
sequences
The key residues that distinguish the canonical PBC containing protein families from the ones that diverge from this motif
are shown in Figure 6a. Notably, nearly all the distinguishing
residues are clustered around the cAMP binding site in the
beta subdomain (Figure 6b). The only exception is G169,
which is located in the β2-β3 loop (Figure 6a). Gly169 does
not directly interact with cAMP, but still appears to be co-conserved with residues in the cAMP binding pocket. A careful
analysis of the structural interactions associated with Gly169
indicates that the Cα of Gly169 mediates a CH-π interaction
with the guanidium group of Arg209, which in turn coordinates with the phosphate group of cAMP (Figure 6b). Thus,
although Gly169 does not directly interact with cAMP, it
appears to be structurally linked to the phosphate group of
cAMP via Arg209. Why would this structural link be
important?
Recent NMR studies on the PKA regulatory subunit had suggested a key role for the β2-β3 loop in coupling cAMP signals
to distal regulatory sites [18]. Specifically, the backbone

Genome Biology 2007,

amide of Gly169 was shown to undergo large chemical shift
changes upon binding to cAMP. This change was proposed to
alter the conformation of an adjacent aspartate (Asp170), the
backbone of which forms an N-cap to the B/C-helix (Figure
6b). Because the B/C helix forms a docking site for the catalytic subunit, this coupling between the PBC and the B/Chelix (via the β2-β3 loop) was proposed to play a key role in
PKA allostery [18]. The co-conservation of Gly169 with
Arg209 suggests that this allosteric coupling may have specifically evolved in CBDs that bind to cAMP. Notably, MARRbacteria and ASNC-bacteria (Figure 6a) are two families that
conserve Arg209 in the PBC, but lack Gly169 in the β2-β3
loop. These two families presumably may have evolved alternative mechanisms of regulation. Future studies will focus on
delineating these mechanisms using a combination of computational and experimental techniques.

Conclusion

A global analysis of CNB domain containing sequences in the
public and GOS data has provided novel insights into the evolution of CNB domain structure and function. Two evolutionary events appear to have contributed to CNB domain
functional divergence, domain recombination and sequence
variation. The sequence diversity observed within the PBC
suggests that the CNB domain has evolved as a scaffold for
not only binding cAMP, but also a wide variety of other ligands, many of which are yet to be characterized. Statistical
comparison of the evolutionary constraints acting on the
canonical PBC motif containing CNB domains with the noncanonical ones reveals that the residues in the PBC region
have co-evolved with residues in the β2-β3 loop. Examining
these constraints in light of structural and biochemical data
provides a model of allosteric regulation, which is likely
conserved in all cAMP binding modules. The results
described in this study have implications for protein engineering and for the design of allosteric inhibitors.

The taxonomic origin of the sequences was also taken into
account in the annotation processes. For instance, PKG-like
CNB domains from parasitic organisms were annotated as
'PKG_parasites'. Functional domains were identified using
rpsblast, which was run against a collection of conserved
domains in CDD, Smart and Pfam [32] with an e-value cutoff
of 0.0001.

Classification of Global Ocean Sampling CNB domain
containing proteins
Because CNB domains in the GOS data displayed significant
sequence similarity to known CNB domains, they were
assigned to one of the 30 families by running them against 30
family specific blast profiles. The taxonomic assignment for
the GOS sequences was likewise done based on their similarity to known NR sequences [19]. Examination of the domain
organization in individual families indicated that while the
NR sequence contained both the CNB domain and functional
domains, GOS sequences usually contained only the CNB
domain. This presumably is due to the fragmentary nature of
the GOS data. In any case, nearly all the CNB domain containing GOS sequences could be assigned to one of the 30 families
based on the similarity within the CNB domain alone.

Visualization of phylogenetic trees
In order to visually examine the evolutionary relationship
between the identified sequences, we first constructed a phylogentic tree of all the 7,696 CNB sequences. The resulting
tree, however, was very complex and hard to interpret. Therefore, we decided to take an alternative approach where we
depicted each family by a consensus sequence. The 30 consensus sequences, corresponding to each of the 30 families,
were generated from multiple alignments of individual
families. The neighbor joining algorithm as implemented in
the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics and Analysis (MEGA)
program [33] was used for tree construction and visualization. Bootstrap test was done using default settings in MEGA.

Measuring the evolutionary constraints imposed on
CNB sequences

Materials and methods
Identification of CNB domains
CNB domains in GOS and NR data were identified using a
combination of psi-blast [29] and Gibbs motif sampling procedures [30]. Psi-blast profiles and motif models were initially built using CNB domains of known structures. These
models were then iteratively updated as distant members
from NR and GOS data were identified. An e-value cutoff of
0.001 was used for psi-blast searches.

Classification of CNB domains in NR
CNB domains identified from NR (5,241 sequences) were
multiply aligned using the CHAIN analysis program [28]. The
aligned sequences were clustered into families and sub-families using the clustering option in the CHAIN program and
the SECATOR program [31]. Families were annotated by
identifying the functional domains linked to the CNB domain.

The evolutionary constraints imposed on CNB sequences
were measured using the CHAIN program [28]. In brief, the
CHAIN program identifies co-conserved residues that distinguish two related sets of sequences (foreground and background) by measuring the degree to which aligned residue
positions in the foreground set are shifted away from the
corresponding position in the background set. Residue positions that are shifted the most (indicated by red histograms
above the alignment) contribute to the functional divergence
of the foreground set from the background set. In the current
study, all the CNB sequences that contain the canonical PBC
motif constitute the foreground set, while the ones that lack
the canonical motif constitute the background set.
