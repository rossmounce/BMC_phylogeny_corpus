Abstract
Background: This study was motivated by the observation of unusual mitochondrial haplotype
distributions and associated physiological differences between populations of the killifish Fundulus
heteroclitus distributed along the Atlantic coast of North America. A distinct "northern" haplotype
is fixed in all populations north of New Jersey, and does not appear south of New Jersey except in
extreme upper-estuary fresh water habitats, and northern individuals are known to be more
tolerant of hyposmotic conditions than southern individuals. Complete mitochondrial genomes
were sequenced from individuals from northern coastal, southern coastal, and fresh water
populations (and from out-groups). Comparative genomics approaches were used to test multiple
evolutionary hypotheses proposed to explain among-population genome variation including
directional selection and hybridization.
Results: Structure and organization of the Fundulus mitochondrial genome is typical of animals, yet
subtle differences in substitution patterns exist among populations. No signals of directional
selection or hybridization were detected. Mitochondrial genes evolve at variable rates, but all genes
exhibit very low dN/dS ratios across all lineages, and the southern population harbors more
synonymous polymorphism than other populations.
Conclusion: Evolution of mitochondrial genomes within Fundulus is primarily governed by
interaction between strong purifying selection and demographic influences, including larger
historical population size in the south. Though directional selection and hybridization hypotheses
were not supported, adaptive processes may indirectly contribute to partitioning of variation
between populations.

Background
Fundulus heteroclitus is a euryhaline killifish that occupies
diverse habitats along steep osmotic and thermal gradients; large populations are found in extreme upper-estuary fresh water sites through brackish estuarine habitats to
marine environments, and across a steep latitudinal temperature gradient along the Atlantic coast of North America from Nova Scotia (Canada) to Florida (USA). This
species has long been of interest to science in part because

of their extraordinary physiological resilience in the face
of osmotic stress [1], and as a model for studying adaptive
evolutionary variation along ecological clines [2]. To date,
the bulk of evolutionary studies on this species have
focused on adaptive variation related to temperature and
pollution (see review in Burnett et al. [3]). However, other
studies reveal unusual patterns of mitochondrial haplotype distributions that covary with differences in osmotic
habitat [4] and physiological tolerance to osmotic stress

[5,6]. Together, results from these studies converge on the
hypothesis that natural selection has helped shape mitochondrial genomic variation as an adaptive response to
physiological challenges posed by life in fresh water habitats. The purpose of this study was to compare mitochondrial genome variation within and among Fundulus
species to test this and related hypotheses.
For coastal populations of F. heteroclitus, a phylogeographic break that centers on the Hudson River separates
"northern" from "southern" types, with a narrow zone of
introgression found in northern New Jersey. This phylogeographic break is supported by data from mitochondrial
haplotype variation [4,7,8], but also from studies of variation in nuclear proteins [2,7,9], microsatellites [10,11],
and gene expression [12]. Few studies in F. heteroclitus
have examined adaptive variation associated with potential selective agents other than temperature and pollution,
such as strong osmotic gradients in estuarine environments.
Hyposmotic tolerance varies widely among Fundulus species [13]. Though F. heteroclitus is widely tolerant of
osmotic extremes [13], populations are distributed along
steep salinity gradients in nature and within-species variation in hyposmotic stress tolerance exists. For example,
adult fish from northern populations are more tolerant of
hyposmotic transfer than southern populations [6], and
individuals from northern populations have higher reproductive success (fertilization success and larval survival) in
low salinities than those from southern populations [5].
Intriguingly, mitochondrial haplotype data show that the
"northern" haplotype is never found south of the phylogeographic break, except in extreme upper estuary habitats that are exclusively fresh water [4]. In these southern
fresh water habitats the northern haplotype is fixed, but
only dozens of miles downstream, after transition to
slightly brackish water habitats, the southern haplotype is
fixed (unpublished data).
I hypothesize (as have others [4,6]) that different mitochondrial genotypes are favored by natural selection in
different osmotic environments, and that the "northern"
haplotype provides an adaptive advantage in hyposmotic
habitats. One model that could account for the unusual
contemporary distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes
is as follows: As Pleistocene glaciers receded, successful
invaders of newly emergent northern habitats were likely
those that could tolerate low salinities leading to fixation
of those genotypes during northward expansion, and
those same genotypes remain fixed in southern habitats
that are fresh water. It is physiologically plausible that
mitochondrial genes may be involved in adaptation to
fresh water habitats since hyposmotic acclimation is very
energetically demanding [14,15] requiring the recruit-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/11

ment of mitochondria-rich cells in gill epithelia [16]. An
alternate hypothesis is that mitochondrial haplotypes
from the exclusively fresh water species F. diaphanus have
introgressed into F. heteroclitus populations accounting for
the unique haplotype distribution and hyposmotic tolerance in "northern" F. heteroclitus. This possibility has been
recognized by others [6,17] and is plausible since F.
diaphanus live exclusively in fresh water, co-occur with F.
heteroclitus in fresh water and northern habitats, these two
species are known to hybridize where they co-occur, and
hybrids are only successful from pairings of female F.
diaphanus with male F. heteroclitus [17,18]. Another alternative is that southern fresh water populations are remnants from a northward expansion of northern
haplotypes following Pleistocene glaciation.
To test these hypotheses I sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from northern, southern,
and fresh water populations of F. heteroclitus, from F. grandis (the sister taxon to F. heteroclitus) and from F. diaphanus. Mitogenome sequences were used to test for the
influence of neutral drift, directional selection, and selective constraint on intraspecific and interspecific variation,
and to define phylogenetic relationships among populations and species.

Methods
Populations and species used
Complete mitochondrial genomes were sequenced from
two individuals from each of five taxa including three
populations of Fundulus heteroclitus, one population F.
grandis (Fgds; Cocodrie, Louisiana) which is the sister species to F. heteroclitus, and one population of F. diaphanus
(Fdia; Piscataway Park, Maryland) which is a co-occurring
congener known to sometimes hybridize with F. heteroclitus [18]. F. heteroclitus were sampled from Maine (FhetME; north of phylogeographic break, northern haplotype), Georgia (Fhet-GA; south of phylogeographic break,
southern haplotype), and from an extreme upper-estuary
fresh water habitat (Fhet-MDPP; south of phylogeographic break, northern haplotype). This fresh water F.
heteroclitus population is from the Potomac River at Piscataway Park in Maryland. This is the same site as site "26" in
Duvernell et al. [11] and site "PS" in Smith et al. [4], and
is the same site from which F. diaphanus were collected for
this study.
DNA preparation, PCR, and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh livers using Qiagen DNeasy extraction kits, and PCR primers were from
Lee et al. [19] or Miya & Nishida [20] or specifically
designed for this study (see Additional file 1). Long-distance PCR (TaKaRa LA taq) was first used to amplify three
overlapping regions covering the complete mitogenome
sequence. Long PCR amplifications were performed in 50

μl reactions including 10 μM final concentration of each
primer under cycling conditions including 40 cycles of
94°C denaturation for 30-s followed by 15-min annealing/extension at 68°C, with a final 72°C hold for 10-min.
Long amplification products were used as the template for
a series of 39 overlapping PCR reactions. PCR was performed in 20 μl reactions including 0.25 μM final concentration of each primer under cycling conditions including
5 cycles of 20-s denaturation at 94°C, 15-s annealing at
37°C, and 45-s extension at 72°C, followed by 25 cycles
of 20-s denaturation at 94°C, 15-s annealing at 45°C, and
45-s extension at 72°C. Amplification products from both
long-distance and nested PCR reactions were electrophoresed on 1% agarose to verify size and cleaned using
Ampure magnetic beads (Agencourt Bioscience).
Both strands of PCR products were directly sequenced
using Big-Dye Terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems) in 10 μl reactions including 0.5 μl Big Dye and
0.32 μM final concentration of sequencing primers (forward and reverse PCR primers). The cycling profile consisted of 40 cycles of 15-s denaturation at 94°C, 20-s
annealing at 37°C, and 4-min extension at 60°C.
Sequencing reaction products were cleaned using
CleanSeq magnetic beads (Agencourt Bioscience) before
electrophoresis on an Applied Biosystems 3130XL
Genetic Analyzer.
Genome investigations
A consensus sequence was determined for each individual
genome following assembly of individual reads in Gap4
[21]. Complete mitogenome consensus sequences were
aligned using ClustalW in MEGA 4.0 [22] and alignments
annotated in SEQUIN http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Sequin/sequin.hlp.html. Transfer RNAs were identified
using tRNAscan [23] and protein coding genes by alignment with Kryptolebias marmoratus and Gambusia affinis
mitogenome sequences (GenBank accession numbers
AF283503 and AP004422, respectively) coupled with
determination of in-frame start and stop codon positions.

Genome-wide characteristics were enumerated and compared among lineages. These characteristics included
genome-wide, gene-specific, and taxon-specific differences in G/C content, synonymous and amino acid
replacement substitution rates, transition/transversion
substitution ratios, and codon usage bias. Topological
predictions of transmembrane segments of electron transport proteins were determined from the consensus prediction from multiple models [24-28] using the server-based
software TOPCONS http://topcons.cbr.su.se/ with the
sequence of individual Fhet-ME2 as the query sequence.
Radical amino acid polymorphisms were identified
according to the criteria outlined in Woolley et al. [29].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/11

A suite of models was used to test for the influence of different evolutionary forces shaping mitogenome variation
within and among species. First, dN/dS ratios were calculated for the entire mitogenome and for each gene separately to test for lineage-specific departures from
neutrality (ratios significantly greater than 1.0 are evidence for directional selection). Second, the branch-sites
model A test 2 [30] in CODEML (PAML 4.0, [31]) was
used to test for departures from neutrality at specific substitution sites, since dN/dS analyses of whole mitogenomes and whole genes may be insensitive for detecting
selection acting on a small number of important substitutions. Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare the null
neutral model (model = 2, NSsites = 2, fix_omega = 1,
omega = 1) against the alternate model of branch-specific
positive selection (model = 2, NSsites = 2, fix_omega = 0,
omega = 1.5) on the branch leading to F. heteroclitus
northern clade. The well-supported tree indicated in Figure 1 was used as the input tree for this model. A Bayes
empirical Bayes procedure [30,31] was used to test the
likelihood of alternate evolutionary forces (neutral drift,
purifying selection, directional selection) governing the
evolution of specific substitutions along the northern
branch. Third, McDonald-Kreitman tests [32] were used
to test for departure from neutral evolution across Fundulus lineages by testing for significant excess of amino acid
replacement fixations or excess of synonymous polymorphisms relative to divergence between pairs of taxa [33]. A
neutrality index (NI) was calculated as the ratio of the
number of synonymous fixed to synonymous polymorphic sites divided by the number of amino acid replacement fixed to replacement polymorphic sites [34], and
statistical significance evaluated using the Fisher's exact
test (two-tailed) performed in DnaSP [35]. Neutrality
index values were calculated for pairings of F. grandis with
each of the three F. heteroclitus populations. Index values
significantly greater than 1.0 indicate excess amino acid
polymorphism relative to divergence and significantly less
than 1.0 indicate a deficiency of amino acid polymorphism [33,34,36].
Phylogenetic analyses were used to test for possible
hybridization between F. diaphanus and co-occurring F.
heteroclitus populations. These analyses examined the relationship of Fundulus populations and species (Acanthopterygii;
Atherinomorpha;
Cyprinodontiformes;
Fundulidae) to each other and to other closely related
fishes for which complete mitogenomes exist including

Results and discussion
Genome-wide characteristics
Fundulus mitochondrial genomes (16,524–16,531 bp
long; GenBank:FJ445394–FJ445403) are typical in that
they contain the identical gene complement (22 transfer
RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 13 protein-coding genes) and gene order as found in most vertebrate
mitochondrial genomes. The control region is long (865–
870 bp) with many conserved blocks and found between
tRNA-Pro and tRNA-Phe. The origin of light strand replication is a short highly conserved block (36 bp) found
between tRNA-Asn and tRNA-Cys. Gene start sites are typically immediately downstream of the end of the previous
gene, and several genes start before the end of the preceding gene. For example, the end of ATPase8 and beginning
of ATPase6 overlap 10 bp, ND4L and ND4 overlap 7 bp,
and the ends of ND5 and ND6 (coded on the opposite
strand) overlap 4 bp. Indeed, the genomes are highly

compact as only 73 bp of non-coding intergenic spacer
DNA is found. All genes are encoded on the heavy chain
except for ND6 and eight tRNA genes (tRNA-Gln, tRNAAla, tRNA-Asn, tRNA-Cys, tRNA-Tyr, tRNA-Ser (UCN),
tRNA-Glu, and tRNA-Pro).
All four nucleotides are equally represented in most
mitogenome regions including tRNA, rRNA, and 1st and

2nd positions of codons in protein coding regions (Figure
2a), though a significant bias against G-ending four-fold
degenerate codon sites was detected in protein coding
regions (p < 0.001, Chi-square goodness of fit test). This
bias toward A-T enrichment at third position codon sites
is consistent across genes except ND6 (Figure 2b), and
consistent across all 10 mitogenome sequences (Figure
2c), though the bias is not nearly as dramatic as in Dro-

sophila where nearly 94% of all codons end in A or T [38].
Strand-specific differences in substitution patterns are also
observed. ND6 is the only gene encoded on the light
chain and A→G substitutions predominate, whereas T→C
substitutions predominate in the remaining genes that are
encoded on the heavy chain. The same strand-biased substitution pattern is also observed in fruit flies [39] and
these genome-scale phenomena may be the result of interaction between mutational tendencies and selection for
translation efficiency [33].
Mutation rates vary across genomic regions, but only subtle differences appear among lineages. Non-coding intergenic spacer regions have the highest mutation rate (33%
of sites were variable among all 10 Fundulus genomes) followed by protein coding regions (21% of sites variable)
(Figure 3). The lowest mutation rates are in tRNA (6% of
sites variable) followed by rRNA (8% of sites variable)
and the D-loop (13% of sites variable). This pattern
appears inconsistent across lineages. In branches separating sister taxa F. heteroclitus and F. grandis, rates of substitution in non-coding intergenic spacer regions appear to
decrease to match or fall behind substitution rates in protein coding regions (Figure 3). However, only 73 bases
constitute intergenic non-coding DNA, so such a small
proportion of the overall genome may be subject to spuri-

40

ous differences in mutation rate across lineages given the
small number of genomes sequenced. Similarly, transition/transversion rate differences in intergenic regions are
likely to be spurious; that is, apparent intergenic transition/transversion differences between F. heteroclitus lineages are due to just one mutation. Excluding intergenic
DNA, few differences remain among lineages in relative
mutation rates of tRNA, rRNA, D-loop, and protein coding regions, except that in the F. heteroclitus Georgia lineage tRNA and rRNA mutation rates are disproportionately
lower and D-loop mutations disproportionately higher
than the overall pattern (p < 0.001, Chi-square goodness
of fit test).
Evolutionary mechanisms
Amino acid polymorphisms tend to be unevenly distributed across proteins (Figure 4); regions of sparse amino
acid polymorphism, especially of sparse radical polymorphism, could be the result of stronger purifying selection
due to the presence of functional domains. Indeed, transmembrane regions of ND2, ND4, and ND5 are located in
the membrane-embedded arm of the NADH dehydrogenase complex and likely play an active role in proton
pumping [40], and in Fundulus these regions harbor significantly fewer radical amino acid polymorphisms (p >
0.05, Chi-square test of independence) relative to the loop

regions of these proteins (Figure 4) which is consistent
with data from mammals [41].
Only five amino-acid replacement mutations are fixed
exclusively in the northern lineage (including Maryland
fresh water and Maine individuals: green lineage in Figure
3). Two occur in ND1 (Pro→Ser at amino acid site 73,
Thr→Ala at site 264) and one in each of ND2 (Ala→Thr at
site 344), ATPase8 (Glu→Asp at site 42), and ND5
(Ile→Val at site 555). All ND subunits are located in the
membrane-bound portion of the NADH dehydrogenase
complex; ND1 is thought to be located at the junction
between the matrix arm and membrane-embedded arm,
and ND2 and ND5 are located in the membrane-embedded arm where proton pumping occurs [40]. ATPase subunit 8 is a core component of the F0 complex of ATP
synthase and may serve an important role in subunit
assembly [42]. Though these substitutions could represent candidate loci for directional selection, statistical support is not strong. Branch-site tests indicate low posterior
probabilities (less than 50%) for a model of positive selection in the northern lineage for each of these five sites.
However, given the relatively limited phylogenetic sampling included in this study (only five taxa) the branchsites tests may have insufficient power to detect positive
selection [43], and more thorough phylogenetic sampling
within Fundulus may increase statistical support for positive selection at these candidate loci. Only one amino acid
replacement is shared between F. diaphanus and the northern populations of F. heteroclitus (Ile→Val at site 592 at
edge of inner membrane region in ND5), offering little
support of convergent mutation conferring hyposmotic
tolerance between these fresh water tolerant and co-occurring groups. Over 160 synonymous mutations distinguish
northern from southern populations of F. heteroclitus,
though no lineage-specific codon usage biases were evident.
In protein coding regions, mutation rates indicate that
mitogenome proteins evolve at variable rates, and patterns of substitution differ between populations of F. heteroclitus. Ratios of synonymous to non-synonymous
mutations indicate that NADH dehydrogenase (ND)
genes are evolving relatively quickly whereas cytochrome
oxidase (CO) genes are evolving relatively slowly (Figures
5 and 6), consistent with findings in mammals [44].
Indeed, branch-site models indicate that more sites are
evolving according to a model of neutral evolution (in
contrast to a model of strong selective constraint) in the
ND genes than in the CO genes (on average 1.79 sites per
100 for ND genes compared to 0.14 sites per 100 for CO
genes). Very low dN/dS ratios are characteristic for all
genes across all lineages (Figures 3 and 5), consistent with
strong selective constraint governing mitogenome evolution. However, subtle differences appear in patterns of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/11

amino acid variation within and between Georgia and
Maine populations, as reflected by differences in the neutrality index.
Comparisons of fixed and variable synonymous and
replacement mutations between each F. heteroclitus population and F. grandis allow calculation of the neutrality
index (NI) which is the ratio of synonymous fixed sites to
synonymous polymorphic sites divided by the ratio of
replacement fixed sites to replacement polymorphic sites
(Figure 3) [34]. Note that only two genomes were
sequenced per taxon, so rates of within-group polymorphism are certainly underestimated but should not be
biased among taxa being compared. NI values greater
than 1.0 are common for animal mitochondrial genes
[33,45], where amino acid variation is higher within taxa
than expected relative to variation between taxa. This
observation rejects neutral expectations, and excess amino
acid polymorphism may reflect either the influence of balancing selection or selection against slightly deleterious
mutation. All F. heteroclitus populations show a general
pattern of NI values significantly greater than 1.0, though
this pattern is most striking in the Maine population
which is the only population in which the NI remains significantly greater than 1.0 after Bonferroni adjustment of
p-values. This observation is consistent with the slightly
deleterious model since historical population sizes are
considered much larger in Georgia compared to northern
populations [9,11], and excess deleterious mutation
should be harder to detect in larger populations because
of the proportionately greater efficiency of purifying selection. These results are consistent with NI values from Drosophila taxa of different historical population sizes [33],
but do not reject the alternative explanation that balancing selection may be maintaining functional polymorphism in the Maine population.
Georgia individuals harbor twice the number of synonymous mutations compared to northern populations (Figures 3 and 6), again likely reflecting much larger historical
population size in which synonymous mutations are
more likely to be maintained but mildly deleterious
replacement mutations are efficiently purged. Indeed,
synonymous polymorphic sites are consistently fewer
across genes within the Maine population compared to
the Georgia population (Figure 6), and chi-squared tests
of 2 × 4 contingency tables indicate that the Georgia mutation ratios are significantly different from those of both
northern populations (p > 0.01 for both comparisons),
but northern ratios are not different from each other (p =
0.77).
In agreement with very low dN/dS ratios, branch-site tests
indicate that over 95% of substitutions appear to be evolving according to a model of strong selective constraint

(out of 3,813 possible sites) reject the evolutionary model
of strong selective constraint, and all 33 of these sites best
fit a model of neutral evolution. Similarly, the vast majority of substitutions along all other branches in the phylogeny best fit a model of strong selective constraint.

Polymorphism in transcriptional control regions may
affect protein expression levels, and therefore be phenotypically important. Presumed functional domains within
the teleost control region, such as conserved sequence
blocks (CSB) in the central conserved region, CSB-II, and
CSB-III (as identified in Lee et al. [46]), are all highly conserved across Fundulus species. The only mutation unique
to northern populations within these regions is at the
beginning of the central conserved region (C→T at mitog-

enome position 15958 in F. heteroclitus ME-2), but the
functional importance of this polymorphism has yet to be
determined.
Together, these lineage-specific patterns of substitution,
dN/dS ratios, and branch-site tests offer little support for
the influence of direct selection on mitogenome evolution
within Fundulus heteroclitus. Though five amino acid substitutions are unique to the northern clade, lineage-specific mitogenome differences more likely reflect
differences in historical population size. Low dN/dS ratios
coupled with results from branch-site tests indicate the
influence of strong selective constraint, and an excess of
synonymous polymorphisms within the Georgia popula-

tion (relative to northern populations and relative to
replacement polymorphisms within Georgia) is consistent with larger historical population size. Nuclear data
also indicate greater genetic diversity in southern versus
northern populations of F. heteroclitus [9,11]. Larger populations can harbor more purely neutral mutations and
are more efficient at purging slightly deleterious mutations [47,48]. These results support the model that mitogenome evolution in killifish is primarily governed by
interaction between strong selective constraint and demographic parameters, which is consistent with broader patterns of mitogenome evolution in other organisms
including flies [49], copepods [50], rats [44], and humans
[51].

Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses of concatenated mitogenome protein sequences indicate that within Fundulus the Maine
population and the Maryland fresh water population
mitogenome types are very similar, all three F. heteroclitus
populations are monophyletic and form a clade with sister species F. grandis, and F. diaphanus is the outgroup (Figure 1). Posterior probabilities for branching nodes were
high, and sequence from two nuclear genes supports the
same topology (data not shown). Broader analysis of all
complete mitochondrial genomes (concatenated proteins) that are currently available for the clade indicate
that cyprinodontiformes and beloniformes fishes are
reciprocally monophyletic (Figure 1), in contrast to the
findings reported in Miya et al. [52]. Furthermore, Fundulus taxa appear to be relatively recently derived among the
cyprinodontiformes lineages. These data provide no evidence for hybridization between fresh water F. heteroclitus
and F. diaphanus in the upper Chesapeake estuary, and
thus does not contribute to explaining the unusual distribution of mitochondrial genotypes in extreme upperestuary habitats.

that fresh water types are relicts from an historical northward expansion following Pleistocene glaciation. An alternate explanation is that southern types that reside in
brackish habitats are competitively excluded from contributing to the gene pool in nearby fresh water habitats
where northern types reside. We know that transition
from fresh water to only slightly brackish demands considerable physiological adjustment [53]. We also know
that northern types have higher fitness [5] and better
osmotic compensatory ability [6] than southern types in
fresh water. One hypothetical mechanism keeping gene
pools distinct may be through breakdown of intergenomic coadaptation where unmatched nuclear-mitochondrial hybrids exhibit lower fitness (reviewed in Rand
et al. [54]). One way to test the competitive exclusion and
relict population hypotheses would be to densely sample
populations along the salinity cline to test for sharp inflections (indicating competitive exclusion) or gradual transitions (indicating introgression) in allele frequencies
across the ecological boundary between fresh water and
slightly brackish habitats. This work is ongoing in the
Whitehead laboratory.

Conclusion

Authors' contributions

These comparative data illuminate the relative influence
of evolutionary forces that shape mitochondrial genome
variation in killifish, but do not offer strong support for
hypotheses proposed to explain unusual distributions of
mitochondrial types in nature. Patterns of synonymous
and amino acid replacement substitutions and branchsite models of codon substitution provide little evidence
that directional selection has directly influenced mitochondrial genome sequence variation between southern,
northern, and fresh water populations of F. heteroclitus.
However, five amino acid replacements and one mutation
in a conserved and presumably functional block of the
control region are unique to the northern clade and may
be candidates for further study. Also, since all F. heteroclitus mitogenomes form a monophyletic group with F.
diaphanus as the out-group, there is no evidence for introgression with F. diaphanus in northern and fresh water
sites. Substitution patterns indicate the important role of
purifying selection governing mitochondrial genome evolution, and the most apparent lineage-specific patterns of
variation within F. heteroclitus is an excess of synonymous
relative to replacement polymorphism in the Georgia
population (Figure 3). This could reflect a larger historical
population size, in which synonymous (purely neutral)
polymorphisms are retained but slightly deleterious
replacement variants are purged.

AW designed experiments, carried out laboratory work
and statistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript.

Since these data do not support two explicit hypotheses,
the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for maintaining
"northern" mitochondrial types in southern fresh water
habitats remains unresolved. One possible explanation is
