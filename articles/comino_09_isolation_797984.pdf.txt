Abstract
Background: The leaves of globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) have
significant pharmaceutical properties, which mainly result from their high content of polyphenolic
compounds such as monocaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acid (DCQ), and a range of flavonoid
compounds.
Results: Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HQT) encoding genes
have been isolated from both globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon (GenBank accessions
DQ915589 and DQ915590, respectively) using CODEHOP and PCR-RACE. A phylogenetic
analysis revealed that their sequences belong to one of the major acyltransferase groups
(anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase). The heterologous expression of globe
artichoke HQT in E. coli showed that this enzyme can catalyze the esterification of quinic acid with
caffeoyl-CoA or p-coumaroyl-CoA to generate, respectively, chlorogenic acid (CGA) and pcoumaroyl quinate. Real time PCR experiments demonstrated an increase in the expression level
of HQT in UV-C treated leaves, and established a correlation between the synthesis of phenolic
acids and protection against damage due to abiotic stress. The HQT gene, together with a gene
encoding
hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate
hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
(HCT)
previously isolated from globe artichoke, have been incorporated within the developing globe
artichoke linkage maps.
Conclusion: A novel acyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of CGA in globe artichoke has
been isolated, characterized and mapped. This is a good basis for our effort to understand the
genetic basis of phenylpropanoid (PP) biosynthesis in C. cardunculus.

Background
Cynara cardunculus L. (2n = 2x = 34) is an allogamous species native to the Mediterranean basin, belonging to the
family Asteraceae, order Asterales. The species includes

three subspecies: the globe artichoke (var. scolymus L.),
which is grown for its edible immature inflorescence; the
cultivated cardoon (var. altilis DC.), which produces
fleshy stalks; and their common ancestor, the wild carPage 1 of 13

doon (var. sylvestris (Lamk) Fiori) [1-3]. Leaf extracts contain molecules of some pharmaceutical interest, including
antibacterial [4-7] antioxidative [8,9] anti-HIV [10-12],
hepatoprotective, choleretic [13], cholesterol biosynthesis
inhibitory [14,15] and anticancer [16] activities. Many of
these properties rely on specific phenylpropanoids (PPs),
particularly 5-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid, CGA)
and di-caffeoylquinic (DCQ) acids, along with various flavonoid compounds [17,18]. The level and composition of
the PP pool can vary considerably between organisms, tissues, developmental stages and in response to environmental conditions [19,20]. PP metabolism is induced by
biotic and abiotic stresses such as wounding, UV-irradiation and pathogen attack [21,22]. Recently, Moglia et al.
[23] have established that UV-C radiation enhances the
level of caffeoylquinic acid in the globe artichoke.

The CGA biosynthesis pathway has been the target of
some detailed research, mainly focused among
Solanaceae species [24-26] (Fig. 1). Even though little
direct information is as yet available concerning the biosynthesis of di- and tri-caffeoylquinic acid, the prior accumulation of CGA does appear to be necessary. Three
distinct pathways have been proposed for the synthesis of
CGA: (1) the trans-esterification of caffeoyl-CoA and
quinic acid via hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT) activity [27,28]; (2) the
hydroxylation of p-coumaroyl quinate to CGA [25]; and
(3) the hydroxylation of p-coumaroyl shikimate to caffeoyl shikimic acid, which is then converted to caffeoylCoA, a substrate of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate
hydroxycinnamoyl transferase HCT [24]. The silencing of
the HQT gene in tobacco and tomato results in a 98%

reduction in CGA level, but does not affect lignin formation, so in these species at least, the first two of these
routes are probably responsible for the biosynthesis and
accumulation of CGA [25]. On the other hand, a lowered
HCT expression in tobacco [29], Pinus radiata [30] and
Medicago sativa [31] changes lignin amount and composition, thereby implicating the third pathway in lignin biosynthesis. A fourth route, which uses caffeoyl-glucoside as
the active intermediate, has been described in sweet
potato [26]. Although the globe artichoke HCT sequence
is similar to that of tobacco HCT, its activity is more
closely related to that of tobacco and tomato HQT, in
showing a preference for quinic over shikimic acid as
acceptor [32].

gene approaches [35]. Genetic maps of globe artichoke
[36] have been based on observed segregation behaviour
in an F1 population formed by the intercrossing of the two
contrasting varieties 'Romanesco C3' (a late-maturing,
non-spiny type) and 'Spinoso di Palermo' (an earlymaturing spiny type).
Here, we report the isolation of the cDNA of a novel acyltransferase involved in C. cardunculus PP biosynthesis,
and assess its leaf expression level as induced by UV-C
irradiation. We also derive the map location of this gene,
along with that of the HCT gene described by Comino et
al. [32].

Results
Linkage maps, created for genes in biosynthetic pathways
in several species, can be used to locate known genes of a
pathway within a specific genomic region. [33,34]. The
presence of allelic variation at the sequence level in genes
of known biochemical functional is useful for candidate

ferase-like sequence, which was extended in both globe
artichoke and cultivated cardoon via a RACE strategy.
Full-length cDNA sequences have been deposited in Genbank (DQ915589, DQ915590). The genes are of identical
length (1335 bp) and their translation product is a 444
residue peptide with a molecular mass of ~50 kDa. The
best matches obtained from a local alignment search
within a non-redundant protein database (blastp) were
with a sweet potato HCBT (70% identity, 85% similarity),
and a tobacco HQT (72% identity, 84% similarity), which
belongs to a multifunctional superfamily of plant acyltransferases [38]. The sequences contain a HTLSD peptide
(aa 163–168, black boxes in Fig. 2), as does the HCT isolated by Comino et al. [32], matching the highly conserved HXXXD motif characteristic for acyl transfer
proteins. The DFGWG block [38,39] present in other acyltransferases of the BAHD family [40] is present from aa
391 to 395 (Fig. 2, black boxes). Phylogenetic analyses
confirmed that the isolated sequence showed a high
degree of similarity with other already isolated HQT

sequences [25,41] and with HCTs from globe artichoke
[32], coffee [41], tobacco and Arabidopsis [24] (Fig. 3).
Heterologous expression of globe artichoke HQT in E. coli
and enzyme assays
The globe artichoke acyltransferase cDNA was cloned and
expressed in E. coli, using a pET3a expression vector. SDSPAGE analysis demonstrated the presence of a heterologous protein of apparent molecular mass ~50 kDa (consistent with the predicted size of the transgene translation
product) both in the supernatant and in the pellet fraction. This protein was absent from the equivalent fractions of cultures of bacteria carrying an empty pET3A
plasmid. The recombinant enzyme was incubated in the
presence of p-coumaroyl-CoA or caffeoyl-CoA and quinic
acid or shikimic acid as substrates, and the products of the
reactions were analyzed by HPLC. In the presence of active
enzyme, new products (p-coumaroylquinate and caffeoylquinate) were detected in the reaction mixtures containing p-coumaroyl-CoA or caffeoyl-CoA and quinic acid.

These products could not be detected when reactions were
performed with the control crude extract (Fig. 4). No significant peaks were detected after addition of shikimic
acid instead of quinic acid in the reaction mixture.
Each reaction product was identified by comparing its
retention time and absorbance spectrum with authentic
samples or isolated compounds previously characterized.

The ability of the isolated acyltransferases to catalyse the
reverse reaction (i.e. the production of caffeoyl-CoA from
CGA) was also successfully achieved, as has been
described in other systems [24,28,42]. Caffeoyl-CoA was
detected when CGA was incubated with Coenzyme A in
the presence of the recombinant protein (Fig. 4), whereas
no metabolic product was detected from cultures carrying
an empty plasmid.

Real-time PCR
In order to assess the involvement in the response to UVC irradiation, the expression levels of HQT and HCT were
analysed by real-time PCR. Based on normalized levels
(using actin as an internal standard), it was clear that UVC treatment induced a significant increase in transcription
(12.3 ± 1.8 fold for HCT and 4.4 ± 0.7 fold for HQT).
Comparison between the standard curves for each enzyme
revealed a correlation coefficient of > 0.98 and an efficiency (slope of the curve) > 0.90 (data not shown).
Linkage analysis
Two
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(SNPs,
HQTsnp359 and HCTsnp97) were identified (Fig. 5) in
the HQT and HCT parental sequences. Both parents of the
mapping population were heterozygous for marker HQTsnp359 (parental genotypes ab × ab), that segregated in
the ratio 1:2:1 (aa:ab:bb) in the F1 individuals, with no
evidence of any segregation distortion (Table 1, Fig. 6).
This allowed the HQT gene to be placed on linkage group
(LG) 5 in both the female and male maps (Fig. 7a). A further 14 markers were assigned to the female LG5: four
microsatellites (CELMS-24, -36, -44 and CMAL-24), three
S-SAPs (cyre5 markers) and 7 AFLPs, covering 62.1 cM
and a mean inter-marker distance of 4.4 cM. More than
70% of intervals are < 4 cM in genetic length, with four
gaps of > 6 cM. In addition to the HQT locus, the male
LG5 consists of 15 markers: two SSRs (CELMS-24 and
CMAL-24) one S-SAP, one M-AFLP (polyGA marker) and
11 AFLPs, spanning 69.5 cM and a mean inter-marker distance of 4.4 cM (range 1.6–7.7). Seven markers (including
HQT-snp359) were shared between the parents, allowing
the alignment of their LG5. The HQT locus maps close to
AFLP markers e38/m47-01 and e47/m49-06 in the female
map, and to the M-AFLP marker polyGA/e33-02 and the
microsatellite CELMS-24 in the male map (Fig. 7a).

Only the female parent was heterozygous at HCTsnp97,
delivering a segregation ratio of 1:1 with no significant
distortion (Table 1, Fig. 6). As a result, the HCT gene could
only be located on the maternal map, where it maps to
LG9, separated by 3 cM from the AFLP locus p12/m61-04
and by 8 cM from the SSAP locus cyre5/m47-02 (Fig. 7b).

A further six markers are present on this 58.4 cM LG,
including one SSR (CELMS-10), two M-AFLPs (polyGT
and polyGA) and three AFLPs. The marker density is 7.3
cM (range 1.6–7.7), with two gaps of > 10 cM.

Discussion
Plants synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites,
which function as UV protectants, phytoalexins, flower
pigments, signalling molecules and building blocks for
lignin. Some have significance in the area of human
health, both as 'phytomedicines', which target specific
health problems, and/or as 'nutraceuticals', which provide
long term nutritional benefit [43]. Particular plant PPs
have been associated with anti-oxidant, estrogen-like and
vasodilatory activity, while others have proven antiinflammatory and anti-cancer chemopreventive action
[29,44-48]
CGA is the most widespread plant PP. Progress is being
made in relation to the definition of its biosynthetic pathway, with the characterisation of two acyltransferases
(HCT, [24] and HQT, [25]) able to synthesize p-coumaroylshikimate and p-coumaroyl quinate esters and a
cytochrome P450 p-coumaroyl ester 3'-hydroxylase
(C3'H) from a p-coumaroyl ester substrate [49,50].
The major phenolic compounds present in the leaves of
the globe artichoke are the DCQs, and their precursor
CGA. Although there is no firm proof as yet that DCQ
originates from CGA, the structural similarity of the two
molecules makes this rather likely. A globe artichoke acyltransferase involved in PP synthesis responded to both pcoumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA esters as acyl donors
[32].
In the present study, we have described C. cardunculus
sequences carrying peptide motifs characteristic of the
plant acyltransferase family. These sequences cluster
within the N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase
group [51] and are closely related to their tobacco and
tomato orthologues. The hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
activity of the enzyme and its involvement in PP biosynthesis have been confirmed by heterologous expression

assays, which showed that it can use either p-coumaroylCoA or caffeoyl-CoA esters as an acyl donor, and can use
quinic acid as an acceptor. As the HQT gene product failed
to utilize shikimic acid, we believe that it is involved in the
transesterification of caffeoyl-CoA and quinic acid, a reaction which occurs in the first route of CGA biosynthesis,
but also at the end of the third pathway, following the
action of HCT and C3'H resulting in the formation caffeoyl-CoA.
PP metabolism can be induced by the application of abiotic stresses [21,52] and it has been shown that PP leaf
content of globe artichoke mostly responds to UV-C irradiation, as compared to other treatments such as methyljasmonate and salicylate that are inactive [23]. Here, we
have investigated the effect of UV-C irradiation on the
transcription level of the HCT and HQT genes involved in
the caffeoylquinic acid pathway. The transcription of both
genes was induced by UV-C, suggesting their involvement
in the higher production of PPs observed as the response
to this stress. Previous work on globe artichoke demonstrated that UV-C application led to large increases of leaf
DCQs whereas no significant effect was observed on CGA
[23]. On the basis of our data this might be a consequence
of the rapid conversion of CGA to DCQs as by means of
an unknown downstream enzymatic step. Indeed the
involvement of the HQT gene in the profile of phenolic
acids accumulated can influence the kind of response to
the UV stress as reported in a previous study on tomato by
Clè et al. [20].

rily as a means of initiating comparative QTL mapping.
Within gene markers, such as the ones described here for
the HCT and HQT genes, are particularly suitable for general mapping, and should prove useful as anchor points
among diverse populations.

Conclusion
A novel acyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of
CGA in globe artichoke has been isolated and characterized. Its activity and involvement in CGA biosynthesis
have been confirmed by heterologous expression assays,
demonstrating that it can use either p-coumaroyl-CoA or
caffeoyl-CoA as an acyl donor, and quinic acid as an
acceptor. We previously observed that the PP metabolism
can be induced by UV-C irradiation, whose effect on the
transcription level of the HCT and HQT genes has been
investigated. The HQT as well as HCT genes have been
located in our previously developed globe artichoke
genetic maps; the linkage analyses of genes having known
biochemical function can help elucidate the complexity of
plant secondary metabolism.
This work is a further contribution in the understanding
of the genetic basis of phenylpropanoid (PP) biosynthesis
in C. cardunculus; our future research activity will be
focused on the analysis of the expression in vivo of both
HQT and HCT, as well as on isolating further acyltransferases involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway of the
species.

Methods
The genetic mapping of biosynthetic pathway genes of
known biochemical function can help unravel the complexity of plant secondary metabolism. The precision of
both marker order and inter-marker distances on LG5 and
LG9 have been improved with the integration of the HQT
and HCT genes. The former increased the number of
bridge markers on LG5, and reduced some large gaps (of
10 cM and 8 cM) affecting the female and the male LGs
(Fig. 7a). Its incorporation has caused some readjustment
in the marker orders and inter-marker distances determined previously [36]. Thus in the female LG, the order of
CELMS24 and e38/m47-01 was inverted, as were those of
CELMS-24, e35/m62-16 and pGA/e33-02, p13/m60-05
on the male LG. The placement of the HCT gene on
female LG9 did not increase the number of bridge markers, nor did it affect marker order. However, it did succeed
in filling a large (13 cM) gap, and in reducing the mean
inter-marker distance. Increasing marker density by the
addition of genes to a map can be accomplished via the
exploitation of mapping populations which segregate for
traits and markers in common across the populations
[53,54]. We are currently constructing further genetic
maps based on combinations between 'Romanesco C3'
and either cultivated or wild cardoon accessions, prima-

Plant material and RNA extraction
Leaves of globe artichoke, and cultivated cardoon were
collected from experimental fields in Scalenghe, Torino
(Italy).

Total RNA was extracted from approximately 100 mg
fresh tissue using the "Trizol" reagent (Invitrogen, USA),
following the manufacturer's instructions. Final RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry, and its
integrity was assessed by electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gel [55].
Isolation and cloning of full length cDNA of globe
artichoke and cardoon
Reverse transcription from both globe artichoke and cardoon total RNA was achieved using poly(dT)primer and
M-MuLV RNaseH-RT (Finnzymes, Finland), following the
manufacturer's instructions. The PCR amplification of
cDNA sequences was performed as described in Comino
et al. [32], using primers (Table 2) designed according to
the CODEHOP strategy [37,56]. A first amplification step
was performed using as primers CODhqtFor and CODhqtRev (Table 2), designed on conserved regions after
alignment (Clustal W at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw)

of HQT amino acid sequences available in Genebank:
Nicotiana tabacum (CAE46932) and Lycopersicum esculentum (CAE46933). Products were run on 1% agarose gel
and fragments of expected size were isolated and sent to
BMR genomics http://bmr.cribi.unipd.it for sequencing.
To obtain the full length sequence, specific primers based
on both, globe artichoke and cardoon, partial cDNA
sequences, were designed for 3'- and 5'-end amplification
as described in Comino et al., [32]. Using ClustalW with
standard parameters, the C. cardunculus full length amino
acid sequences were aligned with the publicly available
acyltransferases transferring hydroxycinnamoyl groups to
acceptors from the shikimate pathway. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA version 3.0 [57].
Heterologous expression of globe artichoke HQT in E. coli
and enzymatic assays
The globe artichoke HQT open reading frame (ORF) was
amplified using HQT-For and HQT-Rev primers (Table 2),
which contain additional restriction sites, respectively,
NdeI (5'-end) and BamHI (3'-end). In a first step the
amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and partially
with BamHI (15 min at 37°C with 1 unit of BamHI). This
partial second digestion being necessary because of the
presence of an internal BamHI restriction site. The
restricted PCR fragment was finally ligated into the cloning site of Nde I – Bam HI digested pET3a plasmid (Novagen, USA). The resulting recombinant pET3a-HQT
plasmid was transferred into E. coli strain BL21(DE)pLysE,
and grown on a selective medium (LB in presence of 50
mg/l ampicillin and 34 mg/l chloramphenicol). Individ-

ual colonies were transferred to 4 ml LB medium and
incubated for 12 h at 37°C. Two ml of this bacterial preculture were transferred in 50 ml LB medium and grown
for 3 h at 28°C prior to an isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction (final concentration of 1 mM)
during 8 h at 28°C. After centrifugation for 10 min at
5000 g, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of phosphatebuffered saline pH 7.5 and lysed by three cycles of freezing
(in liquid nitrogen) and thawing (at 37°C), followed by
three bursts of 30 s sonication on ice. Sonicated cells were
centrifuged at 4°C and 14,000 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was assayed for HQT activity, and profiled by SDSPAGE (10% resolving gel, 5% stacking gel) using Coomassie brilliant blue staining [55]. Negative controls used
comparable preparations harbouring an empty vector.
The recombinant proteins were used for enzyme assays.
CGA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany), and
quinic acid from Fluka (Switzerland). CoA esters (substrates) were synthesised using the procedure proposed by
Beuerle and Pichersky [58]. 4CL enzyme was kindly provided by Dr. Douglas (University of British Columbia,
Vancouver).
The 20 μl reaction mixture contained 100 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, between 50 ng and
1 μg of protein, and the various substrates (p-coumaroylCoA, caffeoyl-CoA, quinic acid and shikimic acid) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 5 mM. The reverse
reaction, i.e. conversion of chlorogenic acid and CoA-SH
(Sigma) into caffeoyl-CoA, was tested as follow: 50 ng to

1 μg protein was incubated in presence of 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM of chlorogenic acid and 100 μM CoA. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 30 min, stopped by the
addition of 20 μl of acetonitrile/HCl (99:1) and products
were analysed by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column
(LiChroCART 125-4, Merck). The two solvents used are
90% H2O, 9.9% CH3CN, 0.1% HCOOH and 80%
CH3CN, 19.9% H2O, 0.1% CH3COOH. The percentage of
the latter reached the 60% over a 15 min run time, and
100% after 28 min.
Real-time PCR experiments
For real-time PCR assays, UV-C stress experiments are performed as described in Moglia et al., [23]. Total RNA was
extracted as described above. The first-strand cDNA was
synthesised using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad), following manufacturer's instructions.

Primers (HCT-ForRT, HCT-RevRT, HQT-ForRT, HQTRevRT, Table 2) were designed on HCT (DQ104740), and
HQT (DQ915589) sequences using the Primer 3 software
http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/
primer3_www.cgi[59]. As a housekeeping gene, actin was
chosen for its stability and level of expression, which is
comparable to the genes of interest and whose expression
remained stable after the UV-C stress. The primers (ACTForRT, ACT-RevRT, Table 2) for its amplification were
designed on the artichoke actin (ACT, AM744951). All
primers were purchased from Metabion (Germany).
Standard curves were prepared for both the housekeeping
ACT and target genes. The cDNAs were performed in triplicate for each sample in 20 μl. Reaction mixes contained
2× iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA),
specific primers at 300 nM, and 3 μl of cDNA. PCR reactions were carried out in 48-well optical plates using the
iCycler Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). Cycling parameters were as follows: one
cycle at 95°C for 5 min for DNA polymerase activation,
followed by 35 cycles of 5 sec at 95°C (denaturation) and
20 sec at 60°C (annealing and extension). In all experiments, appropriate negative controls containing no template were subjected to the same procedure to exclude or
detect any possible contamination. Melting curve analysis
was performed at the end of amplification. Standard
curves were analyzed with the iCycler iQ software. This
quantification system was designed to automate analysis
options, including quantitative and melting curve analysis. The results of amplification were analyzed by the comparative threshold cycle method, also known as the 2ΔΔCt method [60]. This method compares, for each timepoint considered, the Ct values of the samples of interest
(CtI) with the appropriate calibrator (CtM). The Ct values
of both the calibrator and the samples of interest are normalized to the housekeeping gene.

SNP detection and linkage analysis
The allelic forms of globe artichoke HCT (isolated in the
previous work) [32] and HQT (this work) were analysed
in the two globe artichoke genotypes ('Romanesco C3'
and 'Spinoso di Palermo'), previously used for map development [36]. The full length HCT and HQT sequences
were amplified on parental genome with 2 sets of primers
(one for each isolated gene, HCT-For, HCT-Rev, HQT-For
and HQT-Rev reported in Table 2) and PCR products were
sequenced for SNP identification. SNPs genotyping were
carried out with the tetra-primers ARMS-PCR method
[61,62] by using two sets of outer and inner primers
(Table 2), designed using the software made available on
line
http://cedar.genetics.soton.ac.uk/public_html/
primer1.html. PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Segregation data of HCT- and HQT-SNP markers were
monitored and analyzed together with those of AFLP, SSAP, M-AFLP and SSR markers previously applied for
globe artichoke maps construction [36]. The goodness-of
fit between observed and expected segregation data was
assessed using the chi-square (χ2) test. Independent linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the two
way-pseudo testcross mapping strategy [63] by using JoinMap 2.0 software [64]. For both maps, linkage groups
were accepted at a LOD threshold of 4.0. To determine
marker order within a linkage group, the following JoinMap parameter settings were used: Rec = 0.40, LOD = 1.0,
Jump = 5. Map distances were converted to centiMorgans
using the Kosambi mapping function [65]. Linkage
groups were drawn using MapChart 2.1 software [66].
