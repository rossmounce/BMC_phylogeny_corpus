Protein attributes contribute to halo-stability,
bioinformatics approach

Abstract
Halophile proteins can tolerate high salt concentrations. Understanding halophilicity features is the first step toward
engineering halostable crops. To this end, we examined protein features contributing to the halo-toleration of
halophilic organisms. We compared more than 850 features for halophilic and non-halophilic proteins with various
screening, clustering, decision tree, and generalized rule induction models to search for patterns that code for
halo-toleration. Up to 251 protein attributes selected by various attribute weighting algorithms as important
features contribute to halo-stability; from them 14 attributes selected by 90% of models and the count of
hydrogen gained the highest value (1.0) in 70% of attribute weighting models, showing the importance of this
attribute in feature selection modeling. The other attributes mostly were the frequencies of di-peptides. No
changes were found in the numbers of groups when K-Means and TwoStep clustering modeling were performed
on datasets with or without feature selection filtering. Although the depths of induced trees were not high, the
accuracies of trees were higher than 94% and the frequency of hydrophobic residues pointed as the most
important feature to build trees. The performance evaluation of decision tree models had the same values and
the best correctness percentage recorded with the Exhaustive CHAID and CHAID models. We did not find any
significant difference in the percent of correctness, performance evaluation, and mean correctness of various
decision tree models with or without feature selection. For the first time, we analyzed the performance of
different screening, clustering, and decision tree algorithms for discriminating halophilic and non-halophilic
proteins and the results showed that amino acid composition can be used to discriminate between halo-tolerant
and halo-sensitive proteins.
Background
An extremophile is an organism that thrives in, and may
even require, physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to the majority of life on
Earth. The archaeal domain contains renowned examples of extremophiles [1]. A small percentage of proteins
can tolerate salinity and desiccation stresses. The
enzymes from extremely halophilic organisms represent
a fascinating example of adaptation because they can
per-form their functions in vivo and in vitro at 4-5 M
NaCl, losing activity rapidly when exposed to low salt
concentrations [2]. Recently, genes for a number of
halophilic enzymes have been cloned, including dihydrofolate reductase from Haloferax volcanii [3], glutamate
dehydrogenase from Halobacterium salinarum [4],

and malate dehydrogenase from Haloarcula marismortui
[5]. Structural features and crystals of some important
enzymes in from these organisms such as NAD+-linked
opine dehydrogenase[6], glucose dehydrogenase [7], 2Fe2S ferredoxin [8] and halophilic malate dehydrogenase
[9] have been prepared. The molecular mechanisms of
halotoleration in these enzymes, however, has not been
fully elucidated. Some of the sequenced halophilic
enzymes are categorized into the protease family, which
contains key enzymes necessary for many critical cellular
processes and which are widely used in biotechnology and
industrial applications [10]. Information transfer system of
archaea has shown gene conservation and differences in
the chromosomes and the large extrachromosomal elements among these organisms [11]. Since many members
of the archaeal domain are extremophiles, thriving in conditions lethal to most cells, archaea represent an important
source of enzymes for applied research and enzymology.
For instance, haloarchaea and their enzymes have great

potential as biocatalysts in applications requiring low
water activity such as reactions with high salt or organic
solvent concentrations [12].
Development of laboratory techniques such as sitedirected mutagenesis has provided the possibility of
molecular breeding of new halophilic enzymes. Addition
of amino acid residues at appropriate positions of nonhalophilic enzymes can allow for better reversibility from
denaturation or functioning at higher salt concentrations
[13]. For example, Tokunaga et al., (2008) studied the
halophilic characteristics of nucleoside diphosphate
kinases (NDKs) from the extremely halophilic archaea,
Halobacterium salinarum [13]. Residues 134 and 135 in
the carboxy-terminal region of non-halophilic Pseudomonas NDK (PaNDK) consist of an Ala-Ala dipeptide.
The double mutation, of A134E-A135E in the C-terminal
region of PaNDK changes the Ala-Ala dipeptide to a
Glu-Glu dipeptide, conferring halophilic characteristics
to this enzyme. An important question in the field is to
determine the protein features that are critical for halostability. To address this question, we can use an extremophile enzyme such as halolysin as a mod-el.
A variety of lab techniques have been used to find
which protein features are critical for halostability. It
has been noted that compared to non-halophilic homologs, halophilic proteins contain a greater proportion of
negatively charged amino acids relative to positively
charged amino acids [10,13], high GC composition [14]
and there is also an increased usage of Glu and Asp
[15]. A statistical investigation suggested that the overall
hydrophobicity of residues used by halophiles is similar
to non-halophiles and the great increase in surface
acidic charge of halophilic proteins is the principal
mode of halophilic structural stability and effective competition with salt for water [10]. Another study showed
that the charged state of two C-terminal region residues
(134 and 135) of NDK plays a critical role in determining halophilic characteristics. Changing one dipeptide
band was able to affect halostability, which clearly highlights the importance of dipeptide features [13]. These
data suggest that the acidic amino acid residues at a
particular region, rather than the overall net negative
charge, are responsible for halophilicity. It has also been
proposed that hydrophobic interactions play an important
role in the ability of these proteins to cope with salt stress
in a hyper-saline environment [16]. Comparing halophilic
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from archaeal Haloferax
volcanii with non-halophilic DHFRs of other taxa showed
that the most profound difference in halophilic DHFRs is
a general increase in acidic residues, particularly Asp and
Glu, and a decrease in basic residues, particularly Lys.
Another striking, and perhaps more important, difference
was a dejcrease in the overall hydrophobic content of the
halophilic proteins [17]. It has been suggested that

Page 2 of 14

halophilic proteins from archaea may maintain their folds
in high-salt concentrations by sharing highly negatively
charged surfaces and weak hydrophobic cores. It has been
shown that a mutant protein Glu243Arg of the malate
dehydrogenase was more halophilic and required significantly higher con-centrations of NaCl or KCl for equivalent stability [18].
Halolysin, halophilic alkaline serine protease, has been
extracted from archaebacteria such as Natrialba asiatica, Haloferax mediterranei, Natrialba magadii and
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [19]. Halolysin from halophilic archaeon is active at NaCl concentrations of 4-4.5 M
and loses its activity at salt concentrations lower than
2 M. This enzyme is a very interesting example of adaptation to harsh conditions [20]. The major limitation of
finding important halostability features by laboratory
experiments is that examining a large number of features in one experiment is very time-consuming and
nearly impossible; to date a comprehensive study on the
effects of important features, such as dipeptides, on
halostability has not been done. In recent years, the
development of bioinformatics tools, such as intelligent
data mining and knowledge discovery by artificial neural
networks and decision trees, has opened a new window
and greatly accelerated research in the field [21].
Bioinformatics and comparative genome analysis are
now providing powerful new tools for the molecular dissection of vital phenomena. Recently, different feature
selection algorithms, decision tree, and neural networks
have been used in finding features that contribute to
enzyme thermostability and pH resistance [22] and [23].
For getting more information about new data mining
methods such as feature selection algorithms and decision trees and their statistical backgrounds which can be
beneficial in illuminating the underlying structure of
proteins, please refer to Ebrahimi et al., 2009 [22].
The current study aimed to find the most important
features and patterns of halostability contribute to ability
to tolerate high salt concentrations. To this end, we
applied various modeling techniques to study 894 protein features of halo-tolerant (including halolysin proteins) and halo-sensitive. In addition to statistical
analysis, underlying structure of halo-tolerant proteins
in comparison with halo-sensitive ones was investigated
by different screening, clustering, and decision tree
modeling on two datasets with or without feature selection filtering. The findings of this study may provide
useful clues for designing halo-resistant proteins.

Methods
Two hundred and fifty eight halo-tolerant proteins from
different organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and
archaea were extracted from the UniProt Knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) and NCBI proteins

Ebrahimie et al. Saline Systems 2011, 7:1
http://www.salinesystems.org/content/7/1/1

(Additional file 1). All halolysin sequences (A42605,
AAG20619, AAV66536, BAA01049, BAA10958,
CAP14928, NP_281139, P29143 and YP_001690274)
were present in the halo-tolerant protein group. In addition, six-teen halo-sensitive proteins from bacteria,
fungi, and plants were extracted from the UniProt
Knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) and NCBI.
For each protein sequence, 894 protein features (attributes) such as length, weight, isoelectric point, count
and frequency of elements (carbon, nitrogen, sulfur,
oxygen and hydrogen), count and frequency of each
amino acid, count and frequency of negatively charged,
positively charged, hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, count and frequency of dipeptides, number of
a-helices and b-strands, and other secondary protein
features were extracted by using various bioinformatics
tools and softwares from ExPASy site http://www.
expasy.org and CLC bio software (CLC bio, Finlandsgade 10-12, Katrinebjerg 8200 Aarhus N Denmark).
The type of protein (halo-Tolerant, T or halo-Sensitive,
S) variable (set based on was set as the output variable
and the other variables were set as input variables. All
features were classified as continuous variables except
the N-terminal amino acid which was classified as categorical. A dataset of these protein features was imported
into Clementine software (Clementine_NLV-11.1.0.95;
Integral Solution, Ltd.) and RapidMiner software (RapidMiner 5.0.001, Rapid-I GmbH, Stochumer Str. 475,
44227 Dortmund, Germany) for further analysis.
To identify the most important features and find possible patterns contributing to different protein classes,
decision tree algorithms were applied to the datasets.
These models allowed the development of classification
systems that, in their rules, automatically included only
the attributes that really matter in making a decision.
All data mining models run twice: one time with all features and second time with approved features resulted
by feature selection method. During feature selection
process, attributes that did not contribute to the accuracy of the tree were ignored; so two datasets, one with
whole attributes and the other with just important features were used. The main idea of feature selection was
to choose a subset of input variables by eliminating features with little or no predictive information. This process yielded very useful information about the data and
could be used to reduce the data to relevant fields
before training another learning technique such as a
neural network. Various algorithms are available for performing classification and segmentation analysis, and
herein we used different decision tree and cluster analysis models. To investigate the effects of the feature
selection algorithm on other modelsâ behavior, all models were run with or without feature selection criteria.

1. Screening Models
a. Anomaly detection model

This model was used to identify outliers or unusual
cases in the data. Unlike other modeling methods that
store rules about unusual cases, anomaly detection models store information on what normal behavior look like.
This makes it possible to identify outliers even if they
do not conform to any known pattern. While traditional
methods of identifying outliers generally examine one or
two variables at a time, anomaly detection can examine
large numbers of fields to identify clusters or peer
groups into which similar records fall. Each record can
then be compared to others in its peer group to identify
possible anomalies. The further away a case is from the
normal center, the more likely it is to be unusual.
b. Feature selection algorithm

The feature selection algorithm was applied to identify
the attributes that have a strong correlation with enzyme
halostability. The algorithm considers one attribute at a
time to determine how well each predictor alone predicts
the target variable. The important value for each variable
is then calculated as (1 - p), where p is the value of the
appropriate test of association between the candidate
predictor and the target variable. The association test for
categorized output variables differs from the test for continuous variables. In our study, when the target value was
categorical (as in our datasets), p values based on the
F statistic were used. The idea was to perform a one-way
ANOVA F test for each predictor; otherwise, the p value
was based on the asymptotic t distribution of a transformation of the Pearson correlation coefficient. Other
models, such as likelih-ood-ratio chi-square (which also
tests for target-predictor independence), Cramerâs V
(a measure of association based on Pearsonâs chi-square
statistic), and lambda (a measure of association that
reflects the proportional reduction in error when the
variable is used to predict the target value) were
conducted to check for possible effects of calculation on
feature selection criteria. The predictors were then
labeled as important, marginal, and unimportant, with
values > 0.95, between 0.95-0.90, and < 0.90, respectively.
Various feature selection (or attribute weighting) algorithms were applied to identify the attributes that have
strong correlations with output variable (the type of proteins T or S). The models were:
Weight by information gain

This operator calculated the relevance of a feature by
computing the information gain in class distribution.
Weight by information gain ratio

This operator calculated the relevance of a feature by
computing the information gain ratio for the class
distribution.

Ebrahimie et al. Saline Systems 2011, 7:1
http://www.salinesystems.org/content/7/1/1

Weight by rule

This operator calculated the relevance of a feature by
computing the error rate of a OneR Model on the dataset without this feature.
Weight by deviation

Creates weights from the standard deviations of all attributes. The values can be normalized by the average, the
minimum, or the maximum of the attribute.
Weight by Chi Squared statistic

This operator calculated the relevance of a feature by
computing for each attribute of the input da-taset the
value of the chi-squared statistic with respect to the
class attribute.
Weight by Gini Index

This operator calculated the relevance of an attribute by
computing the Gini index of the class dis-tribution.
Weight by Uncertainty

This operator calculated the relevance of an attribute by
measuring the symmetrical uncertainty with respect to
the class. The formulaization for this was:
relevance = 2 * (P(Class) - P(Class | Attribute))/P
(Class) + P(Attribute)

assigned to each cluster. The records are then checked
again to see whether they should be reassigned to a different cluster and the record assignment/cluster iteration
process continues until either the maximum number of
iterations is reached or the change between one iteration
and the next fails to exceed a specified threshold.
b. TwoStep cluster

The TwoStep cluster model is a two-step clustering
method. The first step makes a single pass through the
data, during which it compresses the raw input data into
a manageable set of subclusters. The second step uses a
hierarchical clustering method to progressively merge
subclusters into larger and larger clusters without requiring another pass through the data. Hierarchical clustering
has the advantage of not requiring the number of clusters
to be selected ahead of time. Many hierarchical clustering
methods start with individual records as starting clusters
and merge them recursively to produce ever-larger
clusters.

3. Decision Tree Models

Weight by Relief

a. Classification and regression tree (C&RT)

Relief measured the relevance of features by sampling
examples and comparing the value of the current feature
for the nearest example of the same and of a different
class. The resulting weights were normalized into the
interval between 0 and 1.

This model uses recursive partitioning to split the training records into segments by minimizing the impurity at
each step. A node is considered pure if 100% of cases in
the node fall into a specific category of the target field.

Weight by Support Vector Machine (SVM)

b. CHAID

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related
supervised learning methods that analyze data and
recognize patterns, used for classification and regression
analysis. In this study, coefficients of the normal vector
of a linear SVM were employed as feature weights.

This method generates decision trees using chi-square
statistics to identify optimal splits. Unlike the C&RT
and QUEST models, CHAID can generate non-binary
trees, meaning that some splits can have more than two
branches.

Weight by PCA

Used the factors of one of the principal components as
feature weights.

2. Clustering Models

c. Exhaustive CHAID

This model is a modification of CHAID that does a
more thorough job of examining all possible splits, but
it takes longer to compute.

a. K-Means

The K-Means model can be used to cluster data into distinct groups when groups are unknown. Un-like most
learning methods, K-Means models do not use a target
field. This type of learning, with no target field, is called
unsupervised learning. Instead of trying to predict an
outcome, K-Means tries to uncover patterns in the set of
input fields. Records are grouped so that records within a
group or cluster tend to be similar to each other, whereas
records in different groups are dissimilar. K-Means
works by defining a set of starting cluster centers derived
from the data. It then assigns each record to the cluster
to which it is most similar based on the recordâs input
field values. After all cases have been assigned, the cluster
centers are updated to reflect the new set of records

d. QUEST

The QUEST model provides a binary classification
method for building decision trees. It is designed to
reduce the processing time required for large C&RT
analyses while also reducing the tendency found in classification tree methods to favor predictors that allow
more splits.
e. C5.0

The C5.0 model builds either a decision tree or a rule
set. The model works by splitting the sample based on
the field that provides the maximum information gain at
each level. The target field must be categorical. Multiple
splits into more than two subgroups are allowed.

4. Association Model
The generalized rule induction (GRI) model discovers
association rules in the data. GRI extracts a set of rules
from the data, pulling out the rules with the highest
information content. Information content is measured
using an index that takes both the generality (support)
and accuracy (confidence) of rules into account.
5. One-Way Analysis Of Variance
For each feature, one-way analysis of variance between
groups (halolysins, plant proteases, bacterial proteases,
fungal proteases, termitases, archaeal non-halophilic)
were carried out to determine whether this feature is
different between all groups. Pairwise mean comparisons
with the Tukey test at p = 0.05 were then carried out by
MINITAB 14 to see whether the mean of halolysins for
each feature is different from other groups.
Results
To provide a comprehensive view of structural changes
of proteins during halo-stability, for the first time, we
tried to cover all aspects of salt-sensitive, salt-tolerant
(including halolysin) proteins by extracting and calculating of 894 protein attributes of primary, secondary, and
tertiary structures for each sequence. Then, various
weighting and modeling algorithms were applied to
determine the protein features altering between salt-sensitive, salt-tolerant. Considering a large number of protein features enabled us to detect the key protein
characteristics in the structure of salt-tolerant proteins.
Some of these features and their descriptive statistics in
salt-sensitive, salt-tolerant, and halolysin groups are presented in Additional file 2.
Feature Selection

When feature selection model was applied on dataset of
protein features to compare halo-tolerant with halosensitive proteins (T/S groups), 513 of 851 features ranked
as important (p > 0.95) implying to contribute to stability
to stand in harsh conditions (first hundred features have
been presented in Table 1) and 51 features were found to
be marginal (0.90 < p > 0.95). A node was generated with
just important features and used whenever it was necessary to run all other models on feature selection dataset
(as mentioned in Methods). Results of specified feature
selection (or attribute weightings) were as follows:
Weight by information gain

Thirty eight attributes gained weights higher than 0.70
and only the count of hydrogen gained the highest weight
(equal to 1.0). The frequencies of Leu - Val and Thr - Val
gained weights higher than 0.90 (0.95 and 0.94, respectively). The frequencies of Val, Leu - Arg, Leu, Leu - Ala,
Leu - Leu, Gly, Asn, Pro - Val, Lys - Leu, Ala, Trp, Tyr,
Val - Ser, hydrophobic residues, Glu - Leu, carbon,

Page 5 of 14

oxygen and hydrophilic residues were the next protein
attributes weighed in this model (Table 2).
The frequency of Ala - Tyr, the frequency of Ala - Ala
and the count of non - reduced absorption at 289 nm
were the most important attributes selected when this
model applied on dataset of correlated removed features.
Weight by information gain ratio

This operator showed twenty eight features weighed
higher than 0.70 and the count of hydrogen, the frequencies of Glu - Met, Gly - Leu, Leu - Leu, Leu, Val,
Trp - Pro, Ala - Tyr, Val - Val, Leu - Gly and Val - Lys
(with weights of 1.0, 0.91, 0.91, 0.91, 0.91, 0.89, 0.87,
0.85, 0.80, 0.80 and 0.80, respectively) as the most
important attributes (Table 2).
When the operator applied to dataset of correlated
removed features, the frequency of Ala - Tyr (weight =
1.00), the frequency of Asp - His (weight = 0.86), the
count of Gly - Met (weight = 0.81), the count of Trp Ala (weight = 0.76), the frequency of Ser - Cys (weight
= 0.76) and the count of His - Phe (weight = 0.76)
gained the highest weights.
Weight by rule

Thirty two protein attributes gained weights higher than
0.60 and the frequency of hydrophobic residues and the
frequency of Ala obtained the highest weights (1.0). The
frequency of hydrogen, the frequency of Gly, the frequency of Lys, the frequency of Asn and the frequency
of Val weighed higher than 0.90; while the frequency of
other residues, the frequency of Cys, the frequency of
Leu, the frequency of Ser, the frequency of Thr, the frequency of Leu - Leu and the frequency of hydrophilic
residues gained weights higher than 0.80 (Table 2).
Only two proteins attributes, the percentage of Asn
and the frequency of Ala - Tyr with weights of 1.00 and
0.73, chose by rule operator when applied on dataset of
correlated removed features.
Weight by deviation

Among 38 protein attributes (weight equal to or higher
than 0.80) the count of hydrogen, the fre-quencies of Leu
- Val, Thr - Val, Val, Leu - Arg, Leu, Leu - Ala, Leu Leu, Gly and Asn were ten attributes with the highest
weights (1.00, 0.95, 0.95, 0.88, 0.88, 0.86, 0.86, 0.86, 0.86
and 0.86).
Just three protein attributes, isoelectric point, the
count of Tyr - Val and the count of Ser - Tyr weighing
0.89, 0.88 and 0.84, respectively, highlighted by deviation
model when run on dataset of correlated removed
features.
Weight by Chi Squared statistic

The count of hydrogen gained the highest weight among
39 attributes chose by this model having weights equal to
1.00. The frequencies of Asn, Val, Lys, Leu - Val, Val Gln, Gly, Leu - Gly, Leu - Leu, Leu - Arg, Ala - Val, hydrophilic residues, Val - Lys, Glu - Ala, Thr - Val, Gly - Leu,

The algorithm considers one attribute at a time to determine how well each predictor alone predicts the target variable. The important value for each variable is
then cal-culated as (1-p), where p is the p value of the appropriate test of association between the candidate predictor and the target variable. Since the target
value was categorical, p values based on the F statistic was used.

Gln, Thr - Lys, Trp, non-educed absorption and reduced
absorption attributes with weights between 0.99 and
0.84 were the other next attributes.
The count of non - reduced absorption at 280 nm
(weight = 1.00), the frequency of Ala - Tyr (weight =
0.95), the frequency of Ala - Ala (weight 0.73) and the
frequency of Ala - Phe (weight = 0.71) were the most
important features when Chi Square operator run on
dataset of correlated removed features.
Weight by Gini Index

Again the count of hydrogen gained the highest weight
when this model applied and the weights of frequency
of Leu - Val and the frequency of Thr - Val were 0.85
and 0.81. The frequencies of Val - Val, Ala - Tyr, Leu,
Ala - Val, Gly, hydrophobic residues, the frequencies of
Gly - Ala, Leu - Leu, Ala, Leu - Arg, Gly - Leu, Leu Gly, Val - Lys, Trp - Lys and Glu - Met were higher
than 0.70.
Two attributes (the frequency of Ala - Tyr and the
frequency of Ala - Ala weighing 1.00 and 0.91, respectively) selected by this model when correlated removed
features dataset used.
Weight by Uncertainty

Thirty seven attributes had weights higher than 0.80
with the frequency of Val - Gln having weight equal to
1.00. Four attributes showed weights higher than 0.90
(the frequencies of Ala - Val, Leu - Val, Thr - Val and
Gly - Leu) and the count of hydrogen, the frequency of
carbon, the frequency of Thr - Lys, the frequency of Leu
- Arg, the frequency of Leu - Leu, the frequency of
nitrogen, the frequency of Val and the frequency of Thr
- His frequencies gained weights of 0.89, 0.89, 0.89, 0.88,
0.88, 0.88, 0.88 and 0.88, respectively.
When the model applied on dataset of correlated
removed features, the frequencies of Ala - Tyr, Ala Ala and Ala - Phe with weights of 1.00, 0.91 and 0.79,
respectively, gained the highest weights.
Weight by Relief

The count of hydrogen, the frequencies of carbon, oxygen,
hydrophobic residues, Leu, nitrogen, Val, Ile, hydrophilic
residues, other residues, Gly, Thr, Asp, His, Phe - Pro, Val
- Ile and Tyr with weights of 1.00, 0.98, 0.90, 0.89, 0.85,
0.83, 0.78, 0.74, 0.73, 0.72, 0.67, 0.65, 0.62, 0.61, 0.61, 0.61

and 0.60 were seventeen attributes selected by this
operator.
Relief operator appointed just two protein attributes
(the frequency of Ala - Tyr and the frequency of Ala Phe with weights of 1.00 and 0.70, respectively) as the
most important features when applied on correlated
remove features datasets of 156 attributes.
Weight by SVM

One attributes (the frequency of Lys - Val), four attributes (the frequency of Val - Ile, the frequency of Lys Cys, the frequency of Asn - Asn and the frequency of
Glu - Met), five attributes (the frequency of Ala - Tyr,
the frequency of Lys - Thr, the frequency of Asp - Pro,
the frequency of Val - Lys and the frequency of Thr Val) and nineteen other attributes (Table 2) with
weights equal to or higher than 1.00, 0.90, 0.80 and
0.70, respectively, were the features selected by this
model.
The frequency of Ala - Tyr (weight equal to 1.00) was
the only protein attribute selected by SVM operator
when dataset of correlated removed features employed.
Weight by PCA

From 18 protein attributes selected by this operator, the
count of Ser - Leu had the highest weight (1.00) and
then the count of Ile, the count of Met and the count of
Phe (with weights of 0.99, 0.93 and 0.92, respectively)
and the count of Leu - Ser, the count of Leu, the count
of Tyr, non - reduced Cys extinction coefficient, reduced
Cys extinction coefficient and the count of Leu - Phe,
the count of Tyr - Lys (with weights of 0.89, 0.87, 0.83,
0.82, 0.81 and 0.89, respectively) and the count of Ile Leu, the count of Leu - Tyr, the count of sulfur, the
count of Val - Ser, the count of Ala - Tyr, the count of
Leu - Leu and the count of carbon (with weights of
0.78, 0.77, 0.77, 0.72, 0.72, 0.70 and 0.70, respectively)
were eighteen attributes selected by this operator.
The count of Ser - Tyr, the count of Tyr - Val, the
length of proteins and the count of Phe - Pro with
weights of 0.96, 0.87, 0.81 and 0.72 were the most
important features appointed by PCA operator when
run on dataset of correlated remove features.
Results of attribute weighting models have been presented in Table 2.

Anomaly detection

C5.0

When the anomaly detection model was applied on
dataset with feature selection criteria, the records
divided into two peer groups with an anomaly index
cutoff of 5.108, and no record in the first peer group
and 2 records in the second peer group (45 and 245
records in groups, respectively) found to be anomaly.
The counts of Gly - Ala, Ala and Gly - Ser with average
indices of 0.036, 0.026 and 0.037, respectively, occurred
in each anomalous record. The same peer groups with
the same number of records in each group and the
same number of anomalous records found when the
model applied on dataset without feature selection, but
the count of Ala - Asp, Ala - Gly and Lys - Pro with
average indices of 0.015, 0.014 and 0.015, respectively,
were the three protein attributes contributed to each
ano-malous record.

The C5.0 model generated a simple decision tree with a
depth of 1 and cross-validation of 99.3 Â± 0.5. The most
important feature used to build the tree was the count of
hydrogen. If the value of this feature was â¤ 0.500, the proteins fell into the halo-tolerant category; otherwise, they
were put into the halo-sensitive category. The same tree
and cross validation values and protein features gained
when C5.0 model with 10-fold cross validation applied on
dataset. When the same models were applied to datasets
using feature selection filtering, a tree with the same depth
(1) and cross-validation of 99.0 Â± 0.7 and 98.6 Â± 0.8 was
generated for C5.0 and C5.0 with 10-fold cross-validation,
respectively. The count of hydrogen with the same turning
point (0.500) again was used to induce the tree

K-Means

When K-Means model was applied on database filtered
with feature selection, the records were put into 5
groups or clusters (28, 245, 1, 15 and 1 records in each
cluster, respectively). When the model was applied on
dataset without feature selection filtering, again five
clusters with 30, 2, 42, 201 and 15 records were generated. The number of iteration declined from 7 to 3
when feature selection applied on dataset.
TwoStep model

TwoStep method clustered records into two groups with
45 and 241 records in each cluster, and two clusters
(with 45 and 151 records in each cluster) were created
for the dataset filtered using feature selection criteria.

C&RT

In the C&RT node, a tree with a depth of just 1 was created with the most important feature used to build the
tree being the count of hydrogen (value â¤ 0.500 for the T
mode and > 0.500 for the S mode). The same results
were obtained when feature selection was selected.
QUEST Model

In QUEST modeling, a tree with a depth of 2 was generated
and the frequency of Leu - Leu was used to create the first
tree branches. If the value for this attribute was equal to or
less than 0.008 and the frequency of Lys - Val was equal to
or less than 0.001, the proteins belonged to halo-tolerant
(T) group but if the value for the frequency of Lys - Val
higher than 0.001, the proteins fell into halo-sensitive (S)
group. When the value for the frequency of Leu - Leu
was higher than 0.008 and the frequency of Ser - Gln was

Ebrahimie et al. Saline Systems 2011, 7:1
http://www.salinesystems.org/content/7/1/1

equal to or less than 0.004, the proteins originated from S
group, otherwise from T group. The same results were
obtained when feature selection filtering was applied.
CHAID and Exhaustive CHAID Models

When the CHAID model was applied to the data with
or without feature selection, a tree with a depth of 3
was generated. The frequency of oxygen was the main
attribute to build the tree branches. If the value for this
feature was equal to 0, the protein originated from halotolerant (T) group. If the same value was higher than 0
and equal to or less than 0.095 and the frequency of
Gln - Leu was equal to 0, the protein fell into T group,
otherwise to S group. When the frequency of oxygen
was higher than 0.095 and the count of Asp - Lys was
higher than 1 and the count of Asp - Lys was equal to
or less than 2, the proteins originated from S group,
otherwise from T group. The same trees with the same
features and values were generated when exhaustive
CHAID model applied to datasets without feature selection filtering. When feature selection filtering applied on
dataset, again a tree with a depth of 3 generated and the
frequency of oxygen with the same values mentioned
before used to create tree branches. In addition to the
frequency of Gln - Leu, aliphatic index (value of 87.570)
and the frequency of Cys - Cys (with turning point of 0)
were used to create tree sub-branches. Nearly the same
results obtained with exhaustive CHAID model applied
on dataset with feature selection filtering (Figure 1).
The best percentage of correctness, performance evaluation, and mean correctness in the decision tree models were observed in the CHAID and Exhaustive
CHAID models followed by the C5.0, C5.0 with 10 fold cross validation, CR&T, CHAID, and finally the
QUEST models (Table 3).
GRI Model

GRI node analysis created 100 rules with 290 valid
transactions and minimum and maximum sup-ports of

Figure 1 A decision tree generated by the CHAID modeling
method without feature selection filtering comparing halotolerant (T) with the halo-sensitive (S) proteins.

Page 10 of 14

11.03% and maximum and maximum confidences were
50%. When feature selection was used, minimum support, maximum support, maximum confidence, and
minimum confidence changed to 4.83%, 16.9%, 77.55%,
and 50.0%, respectively. The highest confidence (77.55%)
and support (16.9%) occurred when aliphatic index was
> 97.67, but when the length was > 1116, the confidence
lowered to 69.57% (Table 4).
One-Way Analysis Of Variance and Mean Comparisons

There was a highly significant difference in 403 of 894
features (p < 0.001 and p < 0. 01) between group of
halo-tolerant and halo-sensitive groups. Pairwise comparisons between halo-tolerant and halo-tolerant groups
are presented in Additional file 2.

Discussion
Halodependence and halotolerance are phenotypic characteristics generally included in the âpolyphasicâ characterization of newly discovered microorganisms toward
their description as new taxa with new names and are
used to determine their position within the microbial taxonomy [24]. Some use the term for all organisms that
require some level of salt for growth, including concentrations around 35 g/L as found in seawater. Halobacterium species are obligatory halophilic microorganisms
that have adapted to optimal growth under conditions of
extremely high salinity. They contain a correspondingly
high concentration of salt internally and exhibit a variety
of unusual and unique molecular characteristics [25].
Since their discovery, extreme halophiles have been studied extensively by chemists, biochemists, microbiologists, and molecular biologists to understand molecular
diversity and universal features of life. A notable list of
early research milestones on halophiles includes the discovery of a cell envelope composed of an S-layer glycoprotein [26]. These early discoveries established the value
of investigations directed at extremophiles and set the
stage for pioneering phylogenetic studies leading to the
three-domain view of life and classification of halobacterium as a member of the archaeal domain. It has been
shown that some proteins and enzymes are responsible
for tolerance to hypersaline conditions [27]. Defining features that contribute to this valuable characteristic can
pave the road towards engineering new strains of plants
that can grow in harsh salty conditions. To date, some
studies have looked at phylogeny, taxonomy and nomenclature of halophilic strains and various models have
been employed to determine the most important features
that contribute to these organismsâ ability to withstand
hypersalinity [28]. It should be noted that for future protein engineering applications aimed at converting nonhalophilic proteases to halophilic proteases, modification
of a small number of amino acids in highly similar

sequences will be easier than changing many amino acids
[13]. Here, for the first time, we applied different modeling techniques to study more than 850 protein attributes
of halophilic proteins (including well-known halolysin
proteins) and compared them with halo-sensitive proteins in an attempt to understand the characteristics that
allow them to withstand salty conditions. We used different screening, clustering, and decision tree modeling on
two datasets with or without feature selection filtering.
The minimum and maximum numbers of protein features (36 and 251) with values higher than 0.50 selected
by relief and uncertainty algorithms, respectively.
Although the numbers of important protein features in
algorithms employed here were different, there were 14
attributes chosen by nearly all algorithms (90% of them)
as important features with values higher than 0.50.
These features were: the count of hydrogen, the frequencies of carbon, oxygen, hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, Leu, nitrogen, Val, Phe - Pro, Leu - Gly,
Leu - Leu, Leu - Ile, Val - Lys and Ala - Tyr. In 70% of
attribute weighting algorithms the count of hydrogen
gained the highest possible weight (1.0); showing the
importance of this attribute in feature selection
modeling.
Although the accuracies of tree induction algorithms
were high enough (higher than 94%), the depth of trees
generated by the various tree induction models were not
high, in the best case the depth reached to two branches
and the frequency of hydrophobic residues selected by
more than 40% of algorithms as the main protein attribute to build the tree. This feature was also selected as
one the most important feature by 90% of attribute
weighting algorithms. In this investigation, tree induction models showed the high accuracy in predicting
halo-stability condition of a protein based on its structural protein attributes (up to 100% in SVM algorithm).

This finding opens a new avenue in protein engineering
to predict the halo-stability of an engineered protein
before its production. It should be mentioned that
because of higher number (replications) of tolerantproteins in our data set than sensitive proteins, generated models were more precise in prediction of halotolerant proteins based on structural characteristics.
A consistent difference exists in the pattern of synonymous codon usage between halophilic and non-halophilic organisms [13] and there is strong evidence that
this difference is the result of selection linked to halophilicity [13]. Halophilic and non-halophilic proteins can
also be distinguished based on the amino acid composition of their proteomes and several authors have tried
to relate these differences to functional adaptation [13].
Significant changes in the frequencies of some amino
acids and increases in the their proportions in halophilic
organisms (with a two-fold change in the frequency of
acidic amino acids) have been documented [29]. In
other studies, the residues of some amino acids showed
a significant difference (p < 0.01) between mesophilic
and thermophilic proteins [30].
The frequency of some di-peptides (Phe - Gly, Leu Gly, Leu - Leu, Leu - Ile, Val - Lys and Ala - Tyr) were
among the most important features in attribute weighting algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
is the first report looked at the effects of all possible dipeptides on halostability. Other previous studies have
shown the importance of single acidic amino acid residues (Glu and Asp) [15,31] and Gly [32] in halophilic
proteins, here we looked at the importance of dipeptide
amino acid composition in salt stability. In another
study we showed the frequency of Gln was the most

significant differences in the percent of correctness, performance evaluation, and mean correctness of various
decision tree models were found when feature selected
datasets were used, but positive feature selection effect
observed in clustering models.
The number of peer groups (two groups) did not
change when feature selection filtering was applied, and
also the anomaly index cutoff did not change when feature selection applied on dataset. Although the number

of clusters generated by K-Means modeling did not
change between the models with or without feature
selection, the number of iteration declined from 7 to 3,
showing the positive effects of feature selection filtering
on removing outliers and the same findings observed
with TwoStep modelings.
Charged amino acids prevent charged ions from
attaching to proteins and have a significant role in stabilizing proteins against salty conditions and keeping

water molecules around these proteins. Feature comparisons showed that, in general, halophilic proteins contained an excess of negatively charged amino acids over
positively charged amino acids, and the number of negatively charged amino acid residues was higher than their
non-halophilic homologues; this result confirms several
previously reported studies [13]. The additional negative
charges are primarily located on the protein surface, presumably helping to stabilize the protein molecule by competing with salt for hydra-tion [15]. It has also been
proposed that hydrophobic interactions play an important
role in the ability of these proteins to cope with the salt
stress in a hypersaline environment [16]. It has been
shown that negatively charged amino acids, such as Asp
and Glu, may contribute to a proteinâs ability to resist salty
conditions; which is consistent with our data that show
the presence of a higher percentage of negatively charged
amino acid residues (18.5%) in halophilic strains compared
to their non-halophilic counterparts [33]. Our findings
were also in line with previous studies that showed a
higher average of negatively charged amino acids in halolysin proteins compared to other proteins (p < 0.001). It has
been shown that the cumulative amount of these amino
acids (such as Lys and Arg) and even the content of Val
was remarkably high in archaeal salt stable proteins [34].
Higher averages of hydrophobic amino acids found in
plant proteins correlates with their function as intracellular proteins that tend to aggregate as a sphere surrounded
by water to increase their stability. This may also explain
why more positively charged amino acid such as Lys, Arg
and His were found in halo-tolerant, although it has been
mentioned that this feature may also contribute to salt stability in some organisms [35].
A significant difference (p < 0.05) in aliphatic index
was found between halo-tolerant and halo-sensitive proteins, which can be due to the presence of more aliphatic amino acids such as Ile, Val, Pro, Met and Leu in
plant proteases. This difference or a higher number of
dipeptide bonds may be responsible for the higher number of beta-strands found in halo-tolerant [36].
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in
application of novel bioinformatics ap-proaches in understanding of important phenomena such as salt-tolerance.
Paul et al., [37] exploited another bioinformatics approach
(comparative genomics and proteomics) to discover different trends between halophiles and non-halophiles. They
observed that in the DNA level, the dinucleotide abundance profiles of halophilic genomes keep some common
characteristics, which are quite distinct from non-halophiles. These attribute was suggested as the specific genomic signatures for salt-adaptation by this group. At
the protein level, halophilic species are characterized
by low hydrophobicity, over-representation of acidic residues, especially Asp and underrepresentation of Cys.

Page 13 of 14

Our findings are in agreement with Paul group, since in
the present study, hydrophobicity, Count of hydrogen, and
Asp-related features were highlighted by different weighting and decision tree models as the main distinguishing
characteristics to separate halo-tolerant proteins from
halo-sensitive ones in different organisms. These findings
are promising demonstrating how different bioinformatics
methods accords and can be used to address the fundamental question in nature.

Conclusions
For the first time, we analyzed the performance of different screening, clustering, and decision tree algorithms for
discriminating halophilic and non-halophilic proteins. Our
results showed that amino acid composition can be used
to discriminate between protein groups. We found that
most of the mentioned algorithms can be used to discriminate between halophilic and non-halophilic proteins with
accuracy in the range of 98-100% and our analysis
detected no significant difference in performance between
different methods used in this paper. Interestingly, all decision tree models had a similar accuracy (higher than 98%)
and no significant differences were observed between analysis with or without feature selection. The best performance and correctness results were obtained with the
CHAID tree induction algorithms. In conclusion, we suggest that bioinformatics models can be used as effective
tools to discriminate halophilic and non-halophilic proteins. Finally, for the first time we showed the frequency of
some di-peptides amino acids can be used as the most
important protein attributes to discriminate between halotolerant and halo-sensitive proteins.
