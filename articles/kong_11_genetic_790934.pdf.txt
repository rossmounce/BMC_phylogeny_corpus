Abstract
In China H3N2 and H1N1 swine influenza viruses have been circulating for many years. In January 2010, before
swine were infected with foot and mouth disease in Guangdong, some pigs have shown flu-like symptoms: cough,
sneeze, runny nose and fever. We collected the nasopharyngeal swab of all sick pigs as much as possible. One
subtype H1N2 influenza viruses were isolated from the pig population. The complete genome of one isolate,
designated A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010(H1N2), was sequenced and compared with sequences available in
GenBank. The nucleotide sequences of all eight viral RNA segments were determined, and then phylogenetic
analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method. HA, NP, M and NS were shown to be closely to swine
origin. PB2 and PA were close to avian origin, but NA and PB1were close to human origin. It is a result of a
multiple reassortment event. In conclusion, our finding provides further evidence about the interspecies
transmission of avian influenza viruses to pigs and emphasizes the importance of reinforcing swine influenza virus
(SIV) surveillance, especially before the emergence of highly pathogenic FMDs in pigs in Guangdong.
Findings
Influenza viruses are members of family Orthomyxoviridae
and have segmented, Negative-sense RNA genomes. Swine
influenza virus (SIV) belongs to Influenza A Viruses. SIV
causes respiratory diseases in pigs and has been disseminated all over the world [1]. At present, there were three
main influenza viruses circulating in pigs in the world
including H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2. In addition some
other unusual subtypes of swine influenza were also
reported includingH1N7, H3N1, H4N6, H5N1, H5N2,
H6N6 and H9N2 [2-7].
The first SIV H1N2 was reported in Japan from 1978 to
1992 [8,9]. From then on, H1N2 was show up in different
pigs of different countries, including France from 1987 to
1988 [10], and in the United Kingdom in 1994 [11], the
United States in 1999 [12], Germany in 2000 [13], Korea
in 2003 and thereafter [14]. Recently it first shows up in
Swedish herd [15]. During an influenza virus surveillance
programme in Guangdong pigs, we isolated an H1N2
virus from clinically ill pigs, which was genetically characterized as a result of reassortment events between a

human H3N2 strain, Classical SIV strain and North America avian-like SIV lineage strain.
In January of 2010, some pigs have a severe outbreak of
influenza-like disease occurred in an intensive pig farm of
Guangdong province. Many pigs have similar clinical
symptoms: cough, sneeze, runny nose. These clinical
symptoms last for 3-8 days then some pigs have sick of
foot and mouth disease (FMD). Because Swine influenza
(SI) was immunosuppressive disease which frequently predisposesed to highly fatal secondary infections. Maybe the
SI lowers pig’s immunity to common illnesses, some pigs
will get FMD. From now on, the FMD caused rampant
epidemic diseases in pig population of Guangdong [16].
Initial isolations of the viruses were performed in 10day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken
eggs through the allantoic route, incubated at 35°C for
72 h. Embryonic death was monitored every 12 h, and
then allantoic fluid were harvested under aseptic conditions and stored at -70°C for reserved. Subtype identification were conducted through RT-PCR and through
standard hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase
inhibition assays. One influenza virus was isolated and
named: A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010(H1N2).
The virus RNA was extracted from allantoic fluid
by using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was

performed as a one-step reaction with the TAKARA
OneStep RT-PCR Kit, according to manufacturer’s
protocol. The primer of reverse transcription used 12
bp (5-AGC AAA AGC AGG-3). cDNAs were synthesized at 37°C for 1 h using M-MLV reverse-transcription system (Promega). Full-length PCR amplification
of eight RNA segments was performed with a set of
primer. The genome of this H1N2 SIV was sequenced
fully as described previously, with the GenBank accession numbers HQ85339 to HQ853346.
Phylogenetic analysis of A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010
(H1N2) was carried out by analyzing the data obtained
here with those of other sequences of influenza viruses
from GenBank database. A neighbor-joining nucleic acid
tree was constructed in MEGA 4.0 using the Kimura 2parameter model with 1, 000 bootstrap replicates. Clustal W of Lasergene was used for multiple alignments. In
this study, the nucleotide sequences used for the phylogenetic analysis are as follows: PB2 (nt 100-2307), PB1
(nt 468-2297), PA (nt 479-2150), HA (nt 65-1689), NP
(nt 45-1563), NA (nt 35-1422), M (nt 25-996), NS (nt
41-852). Table 1 lists the reference viruses with the
highest level of sequence identity to A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010 for each gene segment.
The HA deduced amino acid sequences of the A/
swine/Guangdong/1/2010 was analyzed in this study.
There were eight potential glycosylation sites in HA,
including six in HA1 and two in HA2. Its cleavage site
is (PSIQSRGLFGAI), which is not same with the HPAI
(RXR/KRGLF) of the 1918 influenza virus which have
strong pathogenic effect on the human (Figure 1).
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the HA gene of
A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010 is of classical swine lineage
resides in the same clade with pandemic (H1N1) 2009A/
California/04/2009, along with A/swine/Beijing/47/1991
(H1N1) and A/Swine/Indiana/9K035/99(H1N2) (Figure 2).
Sequence homology with A/swine/Beijing/47/1991(H1N1)
and A/swine/Hong Kong/273/1994(H1N1) was respectively found to be 94.6% and 93.9%. It still has a high
homology with A/Swine/Indiana/9K035/99(H1N2) with
92.1%, which is the first reported triple reassortment

swine influenza virus H1N2 in United States [12].
A/swine/Cloppenburg/IDT4777/2005(H1N2) is a novel
SIV H1N2 isolated from Germany, whose HA gene originated from a human epidemic strain, is clearly distinct in
genetic origin compared with those classical SIVs. Therefore, it is obviously that the HA gene of A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010 is a descendent of classical SIV and
originated from the HA gene of neither avian origin nor
human origin.
The phylogeny of the NA genes (Figure 3) also
demonstrated that A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010 is
genetically related to A/New York/568/1996(H3N2) and
that the NA genes of triple reassortment H3N2(TRH3N2) North American human [A/Ontario/RV1273/
2005] and swine [A/swine/Ontario/33853/2005] and
avian [A/mallard/South Dakota/Sg-00128/2007] influenza virus have established themselves as a single clade
[17,18]. This clade shares a common ancestor with the
human H3N2 viruses isolated during the 1990s in New
York [A/New York/568/1996(H3N2)]. Comparison of
partial sequences of the NA genes between TR-H3N2
and A/Turkey/MO/24093/99(H1N2) [19] showed high
value of identities (94.0%-97.2% and 97.4%, respectively),
which suggested close relationship between these
viruses. Sequence homology (bp) with A/New York/568/
1996 was identified as 96.5%. When compared with European H3N2 SIV and Avian-like SIV, a low degree of
similarity is respectively observed as 85.3%-87.8% and
81.8%-84.9%.
Phylogenetic trees of the nucleotide sequences of NP,
M and NS were involved in the classical SIV lineage. Different subtype triple reassortment influenza viruses still
stand with them in the same clade. PB2 and PA was likely
originated from North America avian-like SIV lineage.
PB1 was close to human H3N2 lineage as the NA gene.
(By way of example, the phylograms for the PB1, PB2,
PA, NP, M and NS genes of the viruses featured in the
present study are available in the additional files 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6).

gene, contains various lengths, amino acid sequences,
cellular localizations and functions, which in terms displays strain-specific pathogenicity. The PB1-F2 of
A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010 expressed a truncated protein including 57 amino acid like most human H1N1
viruses, which has a low homology with A/New York/
568/1996 and other triple reassortment influenza virus
(86.2%). It is different from A/Swine/Indiana/9K035/99
which coded full-length PB1-F2. The truncated protein
may change the levels of expression and cellular localizations [20]. The NS1 protein of this virus contains 219
amino acid, it loss the PL motifs (PDZ domain ligand,
PL), which located in 227-230aa. This feature is the
same with recent classical SIV H1N1 [21].
In China, classical swine influenza virus has been
existing since 1996. In the previous epidemiological
study, H3N2 infected pigs in this area. The H1N2 was
reported in 2004, which is a human-swine reassortment
virus [22]. In this study we find the multiple reassortment viruses, it confirmed the swine as a mixing vessel
in transmission. This deserves to be paid attention.
Especially swine population was seized with FMD after
the SIV infected pigs in this area. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus is a swine-origin reassortant: HA, NP and
NS from classical swine (North American) lineage; PB2
and PA from avian (North American) lineage; PB1 from
human seasonal H3N2; and NA and M from Eurasian
swine lineage [23]. Southern China is designated as a
putative influenza epicenter [24]. Both 1957 and 1968
pandemic influenza emerged from this area. The precursors of currently still ongoing H5N1 HPAIVs were identified also in Southern China. Recently H6 AIVs have
been identified in this area [25]. The current situation,
therefore, presents continued risk for further reassortment of swine influenza virus in pig populations and
continuous monitoring of this virus in swine population
will be needed.
