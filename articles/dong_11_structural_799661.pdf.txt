Structural characterization of helitrons and their
stepwise capturing of gene fragments in the
maize genome

Abstract
Background: As a newly identified category of DNA transposon, helitrons have been found in a large number of
eukaryotes genomes. Helitrons have contributed significantly to the intra-specific genome diversity in maize.
Although many characteristics of helitrons in the maize genome have been well documented, the sequence of an
intact autonomous helitrons has not been identified in maize. In addition, the process of gene fragment capturing
during the transposition of helitrons has not been characterized.
Results: The whole genome sequences of maize inbred line B73 were analyzed, 1,649 helitron-like transposons
including 1,515 helAs and 134 helBs were identified. ZmhelA1, ZmhelB1 and ZmhelB2 all encode an open reading
frame (ORF) with intact replication initiator (Rep) motif and a DNA helicase (Hel) domain, which are similar to
previously reported autonomous helitrons in other organisms. The putative autonomous ZmhelB1 and ZmhelB2
contain an extra replication factor-a protein1 (RPA1) transposase (RPA-TPase) including three single strand DNAbinding domains (DBD)-A/-B/-C in the ORF. Over ninety percent of maize helitrons identified have captured gene
fragments. HelAs and helBs carry 4,645 and 249 gene fragments, which yield 2,507 and 187 different genes
respectively. Many helitrons contain mutilple terminal sequences, but only one 3’-terminal sequence had an intact
“CTAG” motif. There were no significant differences in the 5’-termini sequence between the veritas terminal
sequence and the pseudo sequence. Helitrons not only can capture fragments, but were also shown to lose
internal sequences during the course of transposing.
Conclusions: Three putative autonomous elements were identified, which encoded an intact Rep motif and a
DNA helicase domain, suggesting that autonomous helitrons may exist in modern maize. The results indicate that
gene fragments captured during the transposition of many helitrons happen in a stepwise way, with multiple gene
fragments within one helitron resulting from several sequential transpositions. In addition, we have proposed a
potential mechanism regarding how helitrons with multiple termini are generated.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) not only make up big part
of genomes of higher plants, but also play an important
role in promoting their genomic diversity [1,2]. Helitrons, a new category of DNA TEs, have recently been
uncovered by the computational analysis of genomic
sequences of A. thaliana, O. sativa and C. elegans [3].
Lacking the typical structures that are characteristic of

traditional class DNA TEs, helitrons are difficult to be
identified. However, helitrons have a “TC” motif on the
5’-terminus and a “CTRR” motif on the 3’-terminus;
they also contain a 16-20 bp palindromic sequence,
which can form a hairpin structure of 10-12 bp
upstream of the 3’-terminus. In addition, they insert preferentially between adenine and thymidine nucleotides
[3,4]. Helitrons are ubiquitous in all studied eukaryotes,
such as A. thaliana, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, D.
rerio, I. tricolor, L. perenne, M. lucifugus, A. gambiae, M.
Truncatula, N. vectensis, O. sativa, X. maculatus, S.
bicolor, S. nephelus, and Z. mays [3-12].

Helitrons constitute over 2% of the maize genome. It
was estimated that there might be tens of thousands elements in maize inbred line B73 [13,14]. They could capture gene fragments and move around the genome,
which leads to gene diversity between the maize inbred
lines [15]. Helitrons have contributed the remarkable
variation of haplotype in the Bz (bronze) genomic locus
among different maize inbred lines [16,17]. Two helitrons containing hundreds of copies in maize inbred line
B73 have been identified [13].
More helitrons and their capture gene fragments have
been detected in maize than in A. thaliana and O.
sativa [3,13,14,18,19]. Yang et al. [14] found that over
half of the helitrons have contained gene fragments in
the B73 genome. They could be from 28 bp to a 7.6 kb
gene fragments in length, and might even include an
entire gene sequence [20,21]. According to the results of
Du et al. [13] and Yang et al. [14], the helitrons could
possess zero to nine gene fragments, which came from
376 and 840 different genes. The gene fragments carried
by these elements could also form chimeric genes
[13,20]. ESTs of helitron sequences have been detected
in certain maize tissues [15]. It is possible that some
functional genes can be produced from the shuffling of
the capture gene fragments.
The mechanism how helitrons capture gene fragments
and how they transpose remain unknown. The replication initiator (Rep) protein motif and a DNA helicase
(Hel) domain are considered to be the key protein features of rolling circle (RC) processes in bacteria
[3,4,10,22]. It was postulated that helitrons could mobilize by the RC replication of the “copy-and-paste” model
in eukaryotes [4]. Choi et al. [5] found a predicted
autonomous element carrying Rep/Hel-TPase and RPATPase in I. tricolor, however, it contained a frameshift
and a non-sense mutation. Morgante et al. [15] identified two sequences that contained the conserved RCRep motif and DNA helicase domain in two maize
inbred lines. However they both are interrupted by
other transposons. Du et al. [13] and Yang et al. [14]
proposed that helitrons had amplified within the last 6
million years and could still be active in the modern
maize. So far, no intact autonomous element has been
discovered in maize [13,14,19].
The full genome sequence of inbred line B73 has been
achieved using BAC by BAC sequencing strategy
recently [23]. Du et al. [13,24] and Yang et al. [14] have
developed methods for identifying helitrons, and mined
2,791 and 1,930 elements, respectively. They had analyzed the extensive distribution, variability and diversity
of helitrons in the maize genome. From these studies,
certain hallmarks of helitrons in maize have emerged,
such as that they preferentially inserted near other ones,
but less commonly inserted into certain gene. There

were some elements with more than one 5’-termini or
3’-termini. Many helitrons have been shown to carry
phosphatase 2C-like gene fragments.
To further understand the characteristics of helitrons
as well as the features of their transpositions, we have
again developed a set of PERL scripts to search for additional helitrons in the maize genome. A total of 1,649
helitrons have been identified including three putative
autonomous elements and two helitrons with high copy
number. Our study not only provides a detailed characterization of putative intact automomous helitrons, but
also presents evidence to suggest that gene fragment
capturing during the transposition of helitrons happened
in a stepwise way, with multiple gene fragments within
one helitron being the capturing the products of several
sequential transpositions. We have also proposed and
provided the evidence to support a mechanism regarding how multiple terminal elements are generated.

Results
Identification of additional helitrons

To obtain additional helitrons with high confidence, the
sequences of 23 published ones [7,15,17,25-27] including
twenty helAs and three helBs, were used as query
sequences to search against the maize genome sequence
by BLASTN. The resulting 248 candidate helitrons were
initially identified. To further verify these candidate helitrons, two strategies were used. Firstly, helitron locating
in repeated regions could be verified by BLASTN (Additional file 1, Figure S1A) [17]. Secondly, helitrons with
multiple copies of high similarity could be verified each
other by aligning their sequences together to determine
their exact 5’ and 3’ boundaries (Additional file 1, Figure
S1B). Altogether, we obtained 96 validated helitrons by
these two methods, including eighty helAs and sixteen
helBs. To further confirm these helitrons, we conducted
PCR experiments for some selected helitrons. All fourteen that had successful PCR amplification showed variable in sizes of PCR products (Additional file 2, Figure
S2), indicating the vacant sites and occupied sites, therefore providing final confirmation for our 96 seed
helitrons.
Based on the terminal sequence characteristics of the
96 validated helitrons, a PERL script was designed to
identify additional elements in the maize genome. As a
result, a total of 1,649 intact elements were obtained.
According to a standard previously reported [17], we
divided these new elements into two different families,
which including 1,515 helAs and 134 helBs (Additional
file 3, 4, Table S1, S2). The size of these elements ranged from 128 bp to 20,874 bp; the average length was
6,357 bp for helA, and 4,629 bp for helB. Overall, 82.7%
(1,253/1,515) of helA sequences were less than 10 kb in
length. Similarly 94.8% (127/134) helB were less than 10

kb. HelAs with the length of over 10 kb (22.5%; 59/262)
and all 7 helBs with the length of over 10 kb were classified as putative “autonomous” helitrons if they do not
contain other long transposons such as retrotransposon.
HelAs had a conserved sequence of the 24 bp at the
5’-terminus and 28 bp at the 3’-terminus including
palindromic structures. HelBs had conservative
sequences for 28 bp and 32 bp at the 5’-terminus and
3’-terminus, respectively (Additional file 5, Figure S3).
The 5’-terminus of helBs was significantly different from
those of helAs.
Putative autonomous helitrons

In general, the helitrons that encode replication initiator
(Rep) motif, DNA helicase domain and a possible replication A protein 1 (RPA1)-like motif in plants, are considered as putative autonomous ones [4]. To find
potential autonomous helitrons, all helAs sequences of
over 10 kb and helBs of over 5 kb were carefully annotated. Two sequences, named ZmhelA1 (AC208648.2,
14,632 bp) and ZmhelB2 (AC212020.2, 12,217 bp)
respectively were qualified as putative autonomous elements. ZmhelA1 and ZmhelB2 all contained conserved
Rep motif and DNA helicase domain without frameshift
(Figure 1A, B, C, Additional file 6, Table S3). Those
conserved domains were reported to be essential for
DNA replication and for unwinding double stranded
DNA in other prokaryotic and eukaryotic species
[3,5,10]. The putative autonomous ZmhelA1 also contained a putative RPA remnant before the Rep motif
(Figure 1A), although the RPA sequence had a very low
sequence homologous with that of A. thaliana and O.
sativa [3]. In addition, ZmhelA1 also carried eight predicted gene fragments. ZmhelB2 possessed three putative single strand DNA-binding domains (DBD)-A/-B/-C
of RPA1 following the helicase domain in the ORF (Figure 1A), which were in the same orientation as the Rep/
Helicase gene. ZmhelB2 also carried two postulated
gene fragments. Based on these structural characteristics, autonomous helitrons in maize could be at least
divided into two types, a result that was consistent with
the neighbor-joining phylogeny analysis (Figure 2).
To obtain additional putative “autonomous” elements,
the RPA-like and DNA helicase of A. thaliana and O.
sativa [3,5] were used to search against maize genome
by TBLASTN respectively. Then the obtained sequences
were extended 10 kb each in the 5’-terminus and 3’-terminus respectively. Finally, the obtained putative autonomous helitrons were annotated by Fgenesh (http://
linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml). As a result, five putative autonomous helBs were identified by this homolog
searching approach. One of the five putative autonomous helBs, ZmhelB1 (AC200867.3) with the length of
12,992 bp, also encoded an intact ORF as ZmhelB2 with

Page 3 of 11

potentially functional Rep motif, a DNA helicase domain
and a RPA1 motif without frameshift (Figure 1A, B, C,
Additional file 6, Table S3). These two putative autonomous helBs have similar structural characteristics as
that reported by Morgante et al. [15].
Helitrons of multiple terminal sequences and of high copy
number

Our result showed that 28.7% of helAs had contained
multiple terminal structures. We called the internal
terminal sequences as the pseudo terminus (Figure 3A,
B, C). Through multiple sequence alignment, we found
that the real 3’-terminus of helitrons contained highly
conserved “CTAG” motif, but not at the pseudo 3’-terminus of elements with multiple 3’-termini (Figure 3D).
One hundred helAs with multiple 3’-termini were randomly sampled to analyze structure of their pseudo 3’termini, the result showed that 99% (99/100) of the
internal 3’ end sequence had a pseudo 3’-terminus with
no intact “CTAG” motif. However, we did not find any
multiple terminal sequences in the 134 helBs.
Based on the sequence characteristics of pseudo 3’-termini that we obtained, the following consensus sequence
model was defined: “CCGT[ATCG]GCA[AT]CGCACG
[AG]{2}[ATCG]{6, 8}CTAT”. By searching against the
maize genome sequence according to the model, 662
pseudo 3’-termini sequences were obtained. Ten
sequences were randomly selected from these newly identified pseudo 3’-termini, and the intact 3’-termini structures were shown within 10 kb downstream. It was
ubiquitous that the pseudo 3’-termini we identified had no
intact “CTAG” motif in maize. Using the same methods,
we found that 17.6% of helAs also had multiple 5’-termini.
However, there were no distinct differences between the
pseudo 5’-terminal sequence and the true 5’-terminal one.
Helitrons with many copies have been previously identified in inbred line B73 [13,14]. Here we found two additional elements with high copy number. Two of the helAs,
named helitron_mc1 (AC186621.4, 1615 bp) and helitron_mc2 (AC188746.2, 2683 bp), possessed 50 and 54
copies with a high stringent criteria (coverage >95% and
identities >95%), respectively. Using a more relaxed set of
criteria (sequence identity >80%, size >200 bp), there were
2,450 and 5,103 copies, respectively (Table 1, Additional
file 7, 8, Table S4, S5). Helitron_mc1 had over 85% identities in 1,300 bp of the 3’-end sequence with helitron_mc2.
It is possible that helitron_mc2 have evolved from helitron_mc1. In addition, helitron_mc2 also possessed two
pseudo 3’-termini structures (Figure 4).
Gene fragments captured by helitrons

In order to analyze the gene fragments carried by helitrons, all detected elements were searched against the
nonredundant protein (nr) database using the BLAST

(64.7%) did not contain any gene fragment. Most of elements with lengths from 1 kb to 2 kb (90%) had only
obtained one gene segment. The number of capture
gene fragments by the helAs ranged from 0 to 12, with
a mean value of 3. Most helAs (82.1%) carried between

1 and 5 gene fragments. All of the helBs held no more
than five gene fragments, with an average of 1.8. The
majority of helBs (82%) acquired 1 to 3 gene fragments
(Figure 5).
A total of 4,645 gene fragments were carried by the
helAs, which encoded 2,507 proteins (Additional file 9,

Table S6). There were 229 helAs that had captured a
near identical fragment of phosphatase (type) 2C-like
protein (ACG41393.1) [13,14], the same gene fragment
found in helitron_mc1 and helitron_mc2. Different
members of the phosphatase (type) 2C family protein
were also captured by other helAs, such as ACF84978.1
(48 hits), AAQ06294.1 (29 hits) and ACF83293.1 (19
hits). It is possible that the phosphatase (type) 2C-like
protein carried by the helAs could have been amplified
previously [13].
A total of 249 gene fragments coming from 187 proteins have been captured by helBs (Additional file 10,
Table S7). There were 6 helBs that contained a same
gene fragment (ACG47094.1). Our results suggest that
helitrons do not have a bias in capturing gene fragments.

different chromosomes of the maize genome. How can a
single helitron capture a number of gene fragments originally located in several different loci of the genome is
a big puzzle thus far. Extensive sequence alignment analyses showed that there was high level but fragmented
sequence homology within their captured gene fragments among a number of newly identified helitrons.
For example, several captured gene fragments of
ZmhelA3 (362 bp, AC197568.2) were shown to have
high sequence similarity with multiple captured fragments of ZmhelA2 (1,728 bp, AC216828.1), ZmhelA4
(1,520 bp, AC213839.3), helitron_mc1 and helitron_mc2

(Figure 4A, 6A) respectively. All these four elements
have near identical first 25 bp of their 5’-termini and
last 30 bp of their 3’-termini. Interestingly, ZmhelA3
and ZmhelA2 have over 95% identity from 5’ to 3’ end,
excepting one insertion in the middle for ZmhelA2.
Therefore, ZmhelA2 can be explained by having captured a 1,366 bp gene fragment and having inserted into
25 bp of its 5’-termini of its ancestral element
(ZmhelA3). In the same way, ZmhelA4 and helitron_mc1
showed high sequence similarity (more than 85%) with
the 193 bp of the 3’-terminus of ZmhelA3. Detailed analysis indicated that, starting from an ancestral element

that is missing only one internal gene fragment (shown
in blue as Figure 6A) from ZmhelA3, the ZmhelA4 and
helitron_mc1 can both be generated by capturing different gene fragments over several steps of transposition.
Our result strongly suggested that the gene fragments
captured by helitrons happened in sequential fashion,
with each step of transposition likely capturing one gene
fragments. In fact, such a stepwise gene capturing capacity will provide endless opportunity to shuffle gene
fragments originating from all over the genome.
ZmhelB7 (AC186647.3, AC212020.4) might have
evolved from ZmhelB2. ZmhelB7 and ZmhelB2 have the
same terminal sequences, but the former lacked the
DNA helicase domain and the replication protein A
(RPA)-like fragments that were found in ZmhelB2 (Figure 6B). This indicated that helitrons could lose the
internal sequence during the process of transposition in
maize.

Discussion
Helitrons are particularly complex in the maize genome
[13,14,28]. A total of 1,649 elements were obtained
based on the terminal sequence characteristics of elements in this research. Du et al. [13] and Yang et al.
[14] identified 2,791 and 1,930 intact elements in the
maize genome, which overlapped 52.46% and 34.45%
with our result respectively (Additional file 11, 12, Table
S8, S9). The differences among these three searching
programs are mainly due to the parameters used in the
respective perl scripts. For example, the script used by
Du et al. [13] only aimed to identify helAs, while script
used in this study is intended to cover both helAs and
helBs. Additionally, Du’s script and that of the current
study have also differed in a number of searching criteria which leaded to a number of specific helitrons
being identified by each script. Based on previous estimation [15], there are still a large number of helitrons
in maize B73 genome have not been identified. Due to
the unique structure of helitrons, it is still very difficult
to unambiguously identify all these elements. With
more seed helitrons available, a more accurate script
could be generated which would drastically increase the
number of elements being identified in the B73 genome.
Putative autonomous helitrons

All helitrons that have been identified so far in the
maize genome are nonautonomous [13,14]. In fact, truly
autonomous elements have not been found in eukaryotic species to date. In a spontaneous pearly-s mutant of

Morgante et al. [15] identified two sequences contained

both are interrupted by other transposons. Three putative autonomous helitrons found in this research have
contained intact Rep motif and DNA helicase domain,
the same as those found in A. thaliana and O. sativa
[3]. We also detected other four helBs with the conserved Rep motif and the DNA helicase domain, however, their ORF were either having frameshift or
incomplete (Additional file 6, Table S3). Although we
can not confirm that these three putative autonomous
helitrons are actually function as autonomous element at
present, the presence of these three putative autonomous sequences with intact ORF in the B73 genome is
strongly suggested that true autonomous helitrons could
exist in modern maize.
ZmhelA1 had a putative RPA remnant before the Rep
motif. ZmhelB1 and ZmhelB2 possessed an intact
RPA1-like domain following the helicase domain in the
same ORF respectively. Choi et al. [5] speculated that
Rep/Helicase were ubiquitous in eukaryotes, and could
play a more important role in the helitrons transposition
than RPA1. The structural characteristics of putative
autonomous elements in A. thaliana, C. elegans, I. tricolor, M. lucifugus, O. sativa and Z. mays were carefully
analyzed [3,5,10,15] (Additional file 13, Table S10). The
putative autonomous elements in animal only contain
the conserved Rep motif and DNA helicase domain.
The putative autonomous elements in plants all contain
RPA-DBD-A/-B/-C before Rep motif or after helicase
domain, except for the conserved Rep motif and DNA
helicase domain. If ZmhelA1 indeed function as an
autonomous element, then it would suggest that RPA1
is not an indispensable feature for helitrons transposition. The putative autonomous helitrons in plants can
be divided into two types. One is RPA-DBD-A/-B/-C,
following the successive Rep motif and DNA helicase
domain in two different ORF respectively. The second
contains the Rep motif, DNA helicase domain and RPADBD-A/-B/-C in their appropriate order in the same
ORF.
Generation of helitron with multiple termini from nested
helitrons

Most helitrons in the maize genome were found to be
small sizes. About 80% (1,253/1,515) helAs were
between 100 bp and 10 kb in length, and 94.8% (127/
134) helBs ranged from 600 bp to 10 kb in this research.
Yang et al. [14] identified 1,930 elements, of which
95.4% (1,841/1,930) were less than 10 kb in length. The
finding of helitrons with multiple copies suggests that
they do not always capture gene fragments in the process of transposition.
There were 28.7% helAs that possessed multiple terminal structures as shown by Du et al. [13]. The pseudo
3’-termini sequences had damaged “CTAG” motif

Dong et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:609
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/609

comparing with the real 3’-termini. We found that the
pseudo 3’-termini structures were ubiquitous in maize
inbred line B73. HelAs had preference to insert near to
or inside other helitrons [14], which could have caused
to form multiple terminal sequences inside them. Genomic evolution or transpositions could have caused an
intact terminal structure to turn into a pseudo 3’-terminus (Figure 4B, C, D). Yang et al. [14] reported that
helitrons could recognize a new 3’- or 5’-terminus site
to form a new element in A. thaliana. Du et al. [13]
found that the 3’-termini sequences were more variable
than the 5’-termini ones.
The evolutionary pathway of helitrons with shared
capture gene fragments can be deduced according their
different combination of their capture gene fragments
(Figure 6A, B). We detected two elements with multiple
copies, helitron_mc1 and helitron_mc2, the latter possessed two pseudo 3’-termini structures (Figure 4).
There was a high similarity in the 5’-terminal sequence
of helitron_mc2 and ZmhelA5 (AC215227.3). Helitron_mc1, helitron_mc2 and ZmhelA5 had one, three
and one fragment respectively, which are highly homologous to 193 bp of the 3’-terminus of ZmhelA3 (Figure
4A). According to these observations, helitron_mc2
might have evolved from helitron_mc1 and ZmhelA5
[29,30]. The detail of the hypothesized evolution path
for helitron_mc2 is shown in Figure 4B, C, D. ZmhelA5
were inserted into helitron_hypo2 (a hypothesized intermediate). Then helitron_hypo2 carrying ZmhelA5
inserted into helitron_mc1 to form nested heltrons.
Eventually helitron_mc2 was generated by further transposition starting from the 5’-end of ZmhelA5 while
including the rest of three 3’ ends. The intact 3’ end
“CTAG” motif can be mutated either before or after the
generation of helitron_mc2. As there exist a large number of nested retrotransposons [31], there can be a lot
of nested helitrons in the maize genome. The later is
then served as intermediate to give rise to many helitrons of multiple termini seen in the B73 genome.

Conclusions
Helitrons in the maize genome are variable size. When
the elements transposed, they could sometimes capture
gene fragments or lose their internal sequence. Gene
capturing of helitrons can happen in a stepwise mode
through sequential transpositions. Three putative autonomous helitrons were discovered in maize with intact
replication initiator (Rep) motif and a DNA helicase
(Hel) domain, similar to those identified in other species. Therefore, it is possible that active autonomous elements exist in modern maize. Our study also indicated
that helitrons with multiple termini can be generated
from nested helitrons.

Methods
Identification of new helitrons

We initially used 23 published helitrons including 20
helAs and 3 helBs [7,15,17,25-27] (downloaded from
http://genomecluster.secs.oakland.edu/helitrons/). They
were used as query sequences to search against the
maize genome sequence by BLASTN. Searches were
conducted according to the following criteria for the termini of candidate helitrons: 5’ match coverage >25 bp,
identities >70%; 3’ match coverage >25 bp, identities
>80%.
Two candidate elements with less than 20 kb between
them were regarded as a single helitron. We initially
obtained 248 candidate helitrons. A single element that
had inserted into highly duplicated regions could be verified by BLASTN (Additional file 1, Figure S1A) [17].
Secondly, helitrons with multiple copies of high similarity are verified by aligning their sequences together to
determine their exact 5’ and 3’ boundaries (Additional
file 1, Figure S1B). Through these two methods, we
finally validated 96 helitrons. Then primers of fourteen
sequences of validated 96 elements were designed to the
flanking regions upstream and downstream of the
inserted element to verify the putative helitrons, to see
the vacant sites and occupied sites displayed by different
PCR bands in a set of 12 inbred lines (Additional file 2,
Figure S2).
A PERL script was then written based on terminal
characteristics of 96 validated elements to search against
the sequence database of the inbred line B73. We
applied two steps to identify helitrons more reliably,
firstly using the following search criteria: helA 3’-end,
CCCGT.{6,8}ACG[GA][GA].{6,8}CTAGT; helA 5’-end,
ATC[TC][ATCG]TA[TC]TA[TCA][ATCG]{5,6}AAG;
helB 3’-end, CGCC.{5,7}GGCG.{8,10}CTAGT; helB 5’end, ATC[ATCG]{7,8}TTAAAA.
According to the search results and the validated criteria mentioned above, we searched the genomic
sequences again using the stricter criteria as follows:
helA 3’-end, CCGT.GCA[AT]CGCACG[GA]{2}.{7}
CTAGT helA 5’-end, ATCT[ATCG]TACTAC.{5}A helB
3’-end, GCGCCC.{4}GGGCGC.{8}CTAGT helB 5’-end,
ATC[TGA].{4}[TC][AC]TTAAAA A total of 1,649 intact
elements were identified by this way. Helitrons with
multiple termini were searched against the maize genome according to the following criteria, but avoiding the
3’-termini of elements that ended in a guanine base:
CCGT[ATCG]GCA[AT]CGCACG[AG]{2}[ATCG]{6, 8}
CTAT.
Sequence analysis and annotation

Local BLAST software (blast-2.2.16) was used to align
the sequences. A neighbor-joining phylogeny (1,000

Dong et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:609
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/609

bootstrap replications) was built for the helicases of different species by the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis (MEGA) 4.0 software [32]. CLUSTALX 2.0
software was used to align sequence. Identified helitrons
were annotated by FGENESH (http://linux1.softberry.
com/berry.phtml).
The sequences of newly identified helitrons (1,649)
were used to blast against the nr protein sequence database in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Information about the quantity, location and annotation of
capture gene fragments was obtained from the blast
results.
PCR validation of predicted helitrons

The twelve representative maize inbred lines, including
Mo17, Huangye4, W182bn, W153r, W117, W64a,
Va102, Va35, N192, B73, B37 and B68, were chosen to
validate the helitrons. Genomic DNA samples from each
line were extracted from young seedling, according to
the CTAB procedure [33]. Specific primers were
designed in flanking upstream and downstream
sequence of known elements. PCR reactions were performed using 1ul of the obtained DNA, 2 ul 10× PCR
buffer, 0.75 ul dNTPs mixture (2.5 mM each), 1ul of
primer mixture (5 uM each), 0.25 ul Taq polymerase,
and distilled H 2 O was added to make up the final
volume of 20 ul. The PCR conditions were 1 min at
95࠷, then 35 cycles 95࠷ for 45s, x࠷ (57࠷ - 62࠷) for 45s
and 72࠷ for 1 min, and a final extension of 10 min at
72࠷.
