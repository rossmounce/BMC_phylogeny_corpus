Abstract
Background: Protein degradation by the ubiquitin system plays a crucial role in numerous cellular
signaling pathways. Deubiquitination, a reversal of ubiquitination, has been recognized as an
important regulatory step in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway.
Results: While identifying putative ubiquitin specific protease (USP) enzymes that contain a
conserved Asp (I) domain in humans, 4 USP17 subfamily members, highly homologous to DUB-3,
have been found (USP17K, USP17L, USP17M, and USP17N), from human chorionic villi. Expression
analysis showed that USP17 transcripts are highly expressed in the heart, liver, and pancreas and
are expressed moderately in various human cancerous cell lines. Amino acid sequence analysis
revealed that they contain the highly conserved Cys, His, and Asp domains which are responsible
for the deubiquitinating activity. Biochemical enzyme assays indicated that they have
deubiquitinating activity. Interestingly, the sequence analysis showed that these proteins, with
exception of USP17N, contain the putative hyaluronan/RNA binding motifs, and cetylpyridinium
chloride (CPC)-precipitation analysis confirmed the association between these proteins and
intracellular hyaluronan and RNA.
Conclusion: Here, we report that the overexpression of these proteins, with exception of
USP17N, leads to apoptosis, suggesting that the hyaluronan and RNA binding motifs in these
enzymes play an important role in regulating signal transduction involved in cell death.

Background
The post-translational modification by ubiquitin (Ub)
plays an essential role for numerous cellular functions
such as protein degradation, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, immune response, apoptosis, oncogenesis, pre-implantation, and intracellular signaling
pathways [1-6]. Conjugation of ubiquitin to a target pro-

tein is achieved by the sequential enzymatic actions via
ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating
enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3). A novel ubiquitination factor (E4) required for efficient multiubiquitination has been identified in yeast [7]. Proteins modified
with a polyubiquitin chain are then unfolded and
degraded by the 26S proteasome [1,4,5]. Deubiquitina-

tion, a removal of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugated
protein substrates, is mediated by a number of deubiquitinating enzymes. Most deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes
are cysteine proteases and consist of at least five families,
the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH), the ubiquitin
specific processing proteases (USP), Jab1/Pab1/MPNdomain-containing metallo-enzymes (JAMM), Otudomain ubiquitin aldehyde-binding proteins (OTU), and
Ataxin-3/Josephin [8-10]. The USP family members vary
in size and structural complexity, but all contain 6 characteristic conserved homology domains [5]. The UCH family members are relatively small molecules, which
hydrolyze C-terminal amides and esters of ubiquitin [5].
The JAMM isopeptidases are known to deneddylate cullin
(the CSN-5 subunit of the COP9/signalosome) and to
release ubiquitin chains from proteins targeted for degradation (the RPN11 subunit of the proteasome) [11]. The
members of OTU family have been reported as highly specific Ub isopeptidases, but they have no sequence homology to known DUBs [12]. Lastly, Ataxin-3 has a domain
called the Josephin domain, cleaves ubiquitin-AMC, and
binds to the DUB inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde [8].
Hyaluronan is a kind of glycosaminoglycan, which is
involved in the regulation of cell division [13], angiogenesis [14,15], and cell motility [16]. Hyaluronan exists in
extracellular and pericellular matrices and interacts with
various kinds of proteins [17]. Recent reports showed the
existence of a few intracellular hyaluronan binding proteins (IHABPs) and one of them, receptor form hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) binds intracellular
hyaluronan and plays multiple roles including cell cycle
arrest [18] and spindle pole stability [19].
USP17 subfamily members have been previously identified [20] and one of them, DUB-3, has shown that the
constitutive expression of DUB-3 blocks proliferation and
can lead to apoptosis [21]. In this study, we have identified four novel members of USP17 subfamily which
encode a deubiquitinating enzyme, from human chorionic villi tissues. Our study demonstrates for the first time
that USP17 subfamily members of the DUB enzyme regulate apoptosis and cell death of cancerous cells and contain putative hyaluronan and RNA binding domains.

Results
Cloning of USP17 subfamily members in human chorionic
villi and embryonic carcinoma cell lines
To identify putative deubiquitinating enzymes that contain a conserved Asp (I) domain in humans, the GenBank
database was accessed and searched using the BLAST algorithm at the NCBI, as described previously [22]. In this
study, we obtained multiple cDNAs including DUB-3 [21]
and USP17 [23] from human chorionic villi tissues and
various cancer cell lines by RT-PCR. We performed RT-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/292

PCR, sequenced PCR products three times independently
in order to exclude the possibility of PCR errors, and classified the genes as USP17 subfamily members (USP17K,
USP17L, USP17M, and USP17N) due to the high homology to known sequences [20,21]. To characterize the
genetic properties of human USP17 genes, the complete
nucleotide sequences of USP17K, USP17L, USP17M, and
USP17N [GenBank: AF544011, AF544012, AY188990,
and AY533200, respectively] were analyzed. Nucleotide
and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with
the SeqEd V1.0.3 program and Clustal method of the
MegAlign program, a multiple alignment program of the
DNASTAR package. The full-length cDNAs for USP17K,
USP17L and USP17M consist of 1593 nucleotides in open
reading frame and the deduced amino acid sequence of
530 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 58
kDa (Additional File 1). The full-length cDNA for
USP17N consists of 1197 nucleotides in open reading
frame and the deduced amino acid sequence of 398
amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 44.5
kDa (Additional File 1). The conserved Cys, His and Asp
domains, which are thought to form the active site of the
deubiquitinating enzymes, are also found in the USP17K,
USP17L, USP17M and USP17N (Fig. 1); these conserved
domains have been previously shown in other deubiquitinating enzymes including USP36 [24], DUB-1 [25], and
DUB-2 [26]. Sequence analysis for amino acids of novel
USP17 subfamily members indicates that USP17K,
USP17L and USP17M have high degree of homology
(>95%), and USP17N is identical with USP17C when
compared with each other and USP17 family members
(Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis for nucleotide sequences
and deduced amino acid sequences of novel genes
revealed that all novel genes were grouped into the USP17
subfamily (Fig. 2) and they were characterized in this
report.
Examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of these
enzymes by Pfam [27] revealed that novel subfamily
members of USP17 contain the putative conserved
hyaluronan binding motifs (Fig. 3) -(R/K)X7(R/K)- [28].
These putative motifs are located between amino acid residues Arg 401 to Lys 410, and Lys 445 to Lys 453 (Fig. 3).
In addition, "RGG" amino acid sequences predicted for
the novel RNA binding motif are found at the C-terminus.
Interestingly, USP17N lacks of these binding motifs (Fig.
3), suggesting the unique functional roles for these motifs.
Even though it has been suggested that human USP17
subfamily members are homologous to murine DUB subfamily members due to the fact that they are cytokineinducible and regulate cell growth and survival [20],
hyaluronan and RNA binding motifs are not found in
members of murine DUB subfamily (data not shown).

Expression of transcripts for novel USP17 subfamily
members in human tissues and cancerous cells
To investigate the expression pattern of transcripts for
novel USP17 subfamily members in human tissues and
cancerous cells, Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses were
performed. As shown in Figure 4A, Northern blot analysis
revealed that transcripts for novel USP17 subfamily members were expressed in the heart, liver, and pancreas at a
high level. Interestingly, we obtained multiple bands having different sizes (1.7 kb, 1.6 kb, 1.3 kb, 1 kb) using a 5'
500 bp probe of USP17L (Probe: N-500). We also
detected 1.6 kb and 1.7 kb major bands of USP17 subfamily members using a probe designed for a 3' 1 kb
probe of USP17L (Probe: C-1000) (Fig. 4A). It is possible
that other minor mRNA transcripts around 1.3 kb and 1

kb, which have not been detected with DUB-3 probe [21],
may be derived from alternative splicing, promoter usage,
or poly (A+) usage. The presence of a few different sizes of
transcript indicates that novel genes belong to the USP17
subfamily and that there are at least several members of
this family present. In addition to various human tissues,
RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of transcripts
for novel USP17 subfamily members was detected in various human cancer cell lines including HeLa, HEC-1A,
NCCIT, and fibrosarcoma cells (Fig. 4B).

biquitinating enzyme assays were performed. For in vitro
enzyme assay, novel USP17 subfamily members were
expressed as a GST fusion protein. As shown by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 5), four GST fusion proteins demonstrated a strong efficient cleavage of Ub-Met-β-gal (Fig.
5; lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). We generated the Cys conserved
domain mutant for each of novel USP17 subfamily proteins (C89S) using a site-directed mutagenesis method. As
expected, cells with the empty vector alone (Fig. 5, lane 1)
and mutants (Fig. 5; lanes 3, 5, 7 and 9) failed to cleave
Ub-Met-β-gal.
For in vivo deubiquitinating enzyme assay, HA-tagged
pMT123-ubiquitin was transiently expressed in human

endometrial carcinoma cells (HEC-1A) with or without
pcDNA3-myc-USP17L
and
pcDNA3-myc-USP17L
(C89S). Then, we analyzed deubiquitinating enzyme
activity by immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-HA
antibody. The expression bands of polyubiquitinated proteins were nearly invisible in cells expressing pcDNA3myc-USP17L (Fig. 6; lane 4), but not in cells expressing
pcDNA3-myc-USP17L (C89S) (Fig. 6; lane 5). The molecular weight for a mutant form of USP17L (C89S) is bigger
than wild type USP17L, suggesting that there may be a
conformational change due to the amino acid substitution. In addition, other USP17 subfamily members
showed the deubiquitinating enzyme activity in vivo (data
not shown). Taken together, we concluded that novel
USP17 subfamily proteins have deubiquitinating enzyme
activity.
Hyaluronan/RNA-binding properties of USP17 subfamily
proteins
Since it is not known whether hyaluronan-binding sites
within USP17 subfamily proteins are indeed functional,
we further examined whether USP17 subfamily proteins
actually binds hyaluronan. The cetylpyridinium chloride
(CPC)-precipitation assay has been used for investigating
binding affinity [29] and the assay in our study demonstrated that USP17 subfamily proteins interact with
hyaluronan based on the comparison of binding intensity
between endogenous and exogenous hyaluronans (Fig.
7A, lanes 4 and 5). However, USP17N did not interact
with hyaluronan (Fig. 7A, lane 5), indicating that the Cterminal domain of USP17 subfamily proteins is required
for binding with hyaluronan.

Since it has been reported that the HABP4_PAI-RBP1
domain, which is involved in mRNA stability [30], interacts with both hyaluronan and RNA [17], we additionally
investigated the activity of USP17 subfamily proteins for
binding with RNA. We performed the CPC-precipitation

assay and found that USP17 subfamily proteins also bind
to RNA in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 7A and 7B).
Interestingly, USP17N did not interact with RNA as
shown with hyaluronan (Fig. 7A, lane 6), indicating that
the C-terminal domain of USP17 subfamily proteins is
also required for binding with RNA.
Localization study of USP17L
In order to investigate the intracellular localization of
USP17 subfamily proteins, the GFP-tagged USP17L or
RFP-tagged USP17N, or both were transfected into HeLa
cells. Intriguingly, USP17L proteins are found in the
nucleus and are concentrated at the nucleoli (Figs. 8E and
8H) similar to intracellular hyaluronan [31]. However,
USP17N proteins are localized both in the nucleus and
cytoplasm (Figs. 8F and 8I). A merged format shows that
USP17L and USP17N are localized in different regions
(Figs. 8G and 8J). After 48 hours of transfection, cells
expressing GFP-tagged USP17L showed the onset of irregular nuclear division and irregular morphology of overall
cell shape compared with controls (data not shown). In
contrast, cells expressing RFP-tagged USP17N did not
show any sign of apoptosis, suggesting that hyaluronan
binding ability and the localization of USP17 subfamily
proteins may be critical for regulating apoptosis leading to
cell death.
Regulation of cell viability
Since it has been suggested that intracellular hyaluronan
binding proteins are involved in tumor formation
[32,33], we next investigated whether the USP17 sub-

family proteins are involved in the regulation of cell viability and cell cycle for cancer cells. In order to investigate
the cellular roles of USP17 subfamily proteins, myctagged USP17L was transfected into HEC-1A and HeLa
cells to establish stable cell lines. However, we observed
transfected cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 9) and
approximately 3 weeks later, all cells died. However, the
transfection of either USP17L (C89S) or USP17N into the
same cell lines did not result in any sign of apoptosis (Fig.
9). This indicates that USP17 subfamily proteins containing hyaluronan binding motifs and their substrate(s) may
regulate cell viability. Based on the observation of cell
death for USP17L-transfected cells, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to compare fold change for the
expression of caspase 3 as an indicator of apoptosis. The
expression of caspase 3 showed more than two fold
increase in USP17L-transfected cells compared with controls (Fig. 10). However, the expression of caspase 3 in
USP17L (C89S)-transfected cells and in USP17N-transfected cells was similar to one in controls (Fig. 10). All
reactions were performed triplicate.
In order to confirm the apoptosis induced by USP17 subfamily proteins, USP17L was stably expressed by the Teton system. The morphology of cells undergoing apoptosis
was similar to that of ones transfected with pcDNA3-mycUSP17L (data not shown). Therefore, we harvested the
USP17L-expressing cells at 1 week intervals for 3 weeks
and analyzed through FACS analysis. The rate of apoptosis for cells expressing either USP17L or USP17L (CS) was
analyzed by double-staining with annexin V and PI (Fig.

depending on the location in the quadrant (annexin V +,
PI -; early stage) and (annexin V +, PI +; late stage) [34].
The USP17L-expressing cells by the Tet-on system undergoing the early stage apoptosis showed about 2.5 fold
increase compared with control HeLa cells and those
undergoing late stage apoptosis showed about 1.5 fold
increase (Fig. 11). However, the significant change was

not observed in cells expressing USP17L (CS) or USP17N
(Fig. 11). This experiment was performed triplicate.

Deubiquitinating enzyme assays for novel USP17 subfamily members. In vitro deubiquitinating enzyme activity for USP17K,
USP17L, USP17M, and USP17N. Immunoblotting analysis was performed with anti-β-gal antiserum. Coexpressed plasmids
were pGEX-2TK (lane 1), pGEX-2TK-USP17K (lane 2), pGEX-2TK-USP17K (C89S) (lane 3), pGEX-2TK-USP17L (lane 4),
pGEX-2TK-USP17L (C89S) (lane 5), pGEX-2TK-USP17M (lane 6), pGEX-2TK-USP17M (C89S) (lane 7), pGEX-2TK-USP17N
(lane 8), and pGEX-2TK-USP17N (C89S) (lane 9). All of normal USP17 subfamily members cleaved the linkage between ubiquitin and β-galactosidase.
tinating enzyme is a key process controlling many proteins associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In
this study, we isolated four novel members of USP17 subfamily and showed through sequence analysis that they
have high degree of homology when compared with each
other and USP17 (Additional File 1). Phylogenetic analysis for nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid
sequences of USP17 subfamily members revealed that all
novel genes were grouped into the USP17 subfamily (Fig.
1). It has been recently reported that there are multiple
homologous genomic sequences of USP17 subfamily, and
one of them, DUB-3, encodes a cytokine-inducible deubiquitinating enzyme [21]. This is similar to murine DUB
subfamily members including DUB-1, DUB-2, DUB-2A,
and DUB-1A [1,9,25,26]. However, whether they have
distinct functions or polymorphisms remains to be seen.
Since USP17 transcripts were expressed in various cancer
cell lines and it has been suggested that intracellular
hyaluronan binding proteins, which USP17 subfamily
members belong to, are involved in tumor formation
[33], we investigated whether USP17 subfamily proteins
are involved in cell growth and proliferation. Interestingly, we observed that cancer cells (HeLa and HEC-1A)

overexpressing USP17 subfamily proteins except USP17N
appeared morphologically abnormal. In addition, FACS
analysis showed that double-staining of USP17L-expressing, but not USP17N-expressing cells with annexin V and
PI revealed increased apoptosis (Figs. 11A and 11B).
These results suggest that USP17 subfamily proteins containing hyaluronan and RNA binding motifs are involved
in signaling pathway of death for tumorigenic cells.
Besides the fact that the overexpression of USP17 subfamily proteins induces apoptosis in cancer cells, the ability to bind with hyaluronan is another important point
used to elucidate the cellular functions of USP17 subfamily proteins. Hyaluronan is one of glycosaminoglycans and is believed to play various roles both in
extracellular and pericellular matrices [32,35]. Since
enriched hyaluronan is found in various tumor tissues
[32,33], it was thought to be important for cancer. Several
evidences have been proposed to prove the connection
between hyaluronan and tumor growth. Therefore,
hyaluronan is used as a marker for various cancers these
days [32,33]. In addition, hyaluronan has been suggested
that it is involved in the fundamental regulation of cell
cycle, because hyaluronan is enriched in the nucleus dur-

Conclusion
In this study, we report that four novel USP17 subfamily
members which encode a deubiquitinating enzyme have
been identified and that the overexpression of these proteins leads to cell death. Our study demonstrates that
USP17 subfamily members, which regulate apoptosis and
cell death of cancerous cells, contain putative hyaluronan
and RNA binding motifs. Despite of a decade of research
since the discovery of DUB enzymes as an important molecule responsible for regulating protein degradation,
much remains to be defined regarding their cellular functions. A better understanding of relation between USP17
subfamily proteins and cell viability will facilitate therapeutic strategies for regulation of cell proliferation.

In vivo deubiquitinating enzyme assay for the novel USP17
subfamily member. HA-tagged pMT123-ubiquitin was transiently expressed in HEC-1A cells with or without pcDNA3myc-USP17L and pcDNA3-myc-USP17L (C89S). The expression levels of polyubiquitinated proteins were decreased in
cells expressing pcDNA3-myc-USP17L, but not in cells
expressing pcDNA3-myc-USP17L (C89S).

ing the cell division [31]. Since USP17 subfamily proteins
except USP17N binds to hyaluronan and induces cell
death, it is possible that hyaluronan and/or RNA binding
domains of USP17 subfamily proteins may be involved in
the regulation of cell cycle or tumorigenesis. Another possibility is that hyaluronan may serve as a bridge between
the USP17 subfamily enzymes and their potential substrates, which are intracellular hyaluronan-binding proteins. Moreover, USP17 subfamily proteins are condensed
at the nucleoli like hyaluronan dose, suggesting that
USP17 subfamily proteins are involved in mRNA stability
or chromatin remodeling similar to functions of PAIRBP1 and Ki-1/57, which are hyaluronan/RNA binding
motif-containing proteins [29,30]. Due to the fact that in
vivo deubiquitinating enzyme assay for USP17 subfamily
members showed the extensive reduction of ubiquitination for cellular proteins (Fig. 6), it is possible that a
number of proteins including apoptosis-related proteins
can be regulated by USP17 subfamily members. Important direction for future studies should include the isolation and characterization of substrates for USP17. This
will help us to understand the cellular roles of USP17.

Specimens and transfection
Chorionic villi samples used were described previously
[36]. Various human cancer cells (HeLa, HEC-1A, NCCIT,
and fibrosarcoma cells) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco
BRL, Rockville, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, USA). Transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE reagent (Gibco
BRL, Rockville, MD, USA) according to manufacturer's
instruction.
cDNA synthesis and cloning for USP17 subfamily members
TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, USA) was used
for total RNA isolation from obtained chorionic villi,
HeLa, HEC-1A, NCCIT, and fibrosarcoma cells. cDNA
synthesis from obtained total RNA was in accordance with
the protocol of SuperScript Preamplification system
(Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, USA). The full-length cDNAs
were amplified by RT-PCR in human chorionic villi tissues, HeLa, HEC-1A, NCCIT, and fibrosarcoma cells.
Primers (Forward: 5'-CGGGATCCATGGAGGACG-3',
Reverse: 5'-GGAATTCCACTGAGATCACT-3') used for isolating putative DUB genes are made on the basis of published sequences [GenBank: XM_252830]. Primers used
were synthesized commercially and gel-purified prior to
use (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). To express GST fusion proteins, pGEX-2TK-USP17K, pGEX-2TK-USP17L, pGEX2TK-USP17M, and pGEX-2TK-USP17N were cloned by
inserting each USP17 subfamily member into pGEX-2TK
vector (Amersham Life Science, Uppsala, Sweden). BLAST
programs on the web site established by the National
Center of Biological Information [37] were used for similarity searches in the GenBank, and Pfam [27] program
was used for prediction of possible motifs and domains in
the protein sequences.
Site-directed mutagenesis of USP17 subfamily members
Missense mutation constructs for pGEX-2TK-USP17K
(C89S), pGEX-2TK-USP17L (C89S), pGEX-2TK-USP17M
(C89S), and pGEX-2TK-USP17N (C89S) were derived

Hyaluronan/RNA-binding assays
Hyaluronan/RNA-binding assays. To confirm the interaction of USP17 subfamily proteins with either hyaluronan or RNA, CPC
precipitation assay was performed. Cell lysate aliquots from HeLa cells transfected with myc-tagged USP17L or myc-tagged
USP17N construct were incubated with hyaluronan or RNA and subjected to CPC precipitation. (A) Coprecipitated proteins
were subjected to Western blot analysis with an antibody against the myc tag. CPC precipitation without the addition of CPC
or myc-tagged USP17 construct was used as negative controls (lanes 1–3). Without the addition of CPC, the whole cell lysate
from cells transfected with myc-tagged USP17L or myc-tagged USP17N was used as a positive control (lane 7). (B) For RNA
binding assay, total RNA of HeLa cells instead of hyaluronan were added.

from each wild type construct by PCR-based site-directed
mutagenesis, using a QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to
manufacturers' instructions. The two primers; forward
primer (5'-GGGAAATACCCGCTACGTGAACGCTTC-3')
and reverse primer (5'-GAAGCGTTCACGTAGCGGGTATTTCC-3') were used for replacing cysteine with serine
at amino acid 89 of USP17 subfamily proteins. Primers
used were synthesized commercially and gel-purified
prior to use (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea).

Northern blot analysis
As described previously [36], Northern blot analysis was
carried out to confirm the expression level of USP17 transcripts using a human tissue blot purchased from Clontech. The immobilized nucleic acids were hybridized with
radiolabeled DNA probes. Probes used for this study was
the 5' 500 bp and 3' 1 kb of USP17L. They were labeled by
random primers with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences,
Buckinghamshire, England). Hybridization was performed in a bag containing 5 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's solu-

Kodak X-ray films with an intensifying screen for 24 hours
at -70°C.
Deubiquitinating enzyme assays
Deubiquitinating enzyme assays were previously
described [9]. For the in vitro deubiquitination assay,
pGEX-2TK-USP17K, pGEX-2TK-USP17K (C89S), pGEX2TK-USP17L, pGEX-2TK-USP17L (C89S), pGEX-2TKUSP17M, pGEX-2TK-USP17M (C89S), pGEX-2TKUSP17N, and pGEX-2TK-USP17N (C89S) were co-trans-

formed into E. coli BL21 competent cells (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA, USA) with pACYC184-Ub-β-gal. Plasmid-bearing E. coli BL21 cells were grown in LB medium and
induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside
(IPTG) for 4 hours at 37°C. Cells were harvested and were
lysed in cracking buffer (0.01 M phosphate [pH 7.4]. 8 M
Urea, 1% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol). These whole
cell lysates centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and the
supernatant was loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The
immunoblotting was performed with a rabbit anti-β-gal
antiserum (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA, USA) or a rabbit antiGST antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY,
USA).

USP17L, USP17L (C89S) or USP17N were determined.

The effect of USP17 expression on the ubiquitin-proteasome system in vivo was analyzed by transfecting pcDNA3myc-USP17L or pcDNA3-myc-USP17L (C89S) along with
pMT123-HA-ubiquitin into HEC-1A cells. After 24 hours
of transfection, cells were harvested and lysed. 40 µg of
total proteins was loaded in each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE
for immunoblotting analysis using an anti-HA antibody
(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Equal
loading was verified by immunoblotting against α-myc
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Real-time PCR analysis and the Tet-on system
After the transfection of pcDNA3-myc-USP17L, the
expression of caspase 3 as a marker for apoptosis was analyzed by real-time PCR (Opticon2, MJ Research, Ramsey,
MN, USA). Product specificity was examined by melting
curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis after each
real-time PCR reaction. To normalize the expression data
of the genes, GAPDH was used (Forward primer: 5'-ACTGGTGCTGCCAAGGCTGT-3', Reverse primer: 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3'). Quantification was performed
using an internal cDNA standard curve. Fold changes of
caspase 3 expression in USP17L-overexpressed cells were
calculated relative to the levels in control cells.

For the long-term (3 weeks) observation and FACS analysis, USP17L was expressed in HeLa cells using the Tet-on
system (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, USA) by manufacturer's instruction. Expression of USP17L was confirmed
by real-time PCR analysis.
FACS analysis
For apoptosis analysis, HeLa-Tet-on cells expressing
USP17L were harvested in PBS and resuspended 100 µl of
binding buffer (10 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2). 5 µl annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) and 10 µl propidium iodide
(PI, 50 µg/ml, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) were
added and incubated 15 minutes in the dark. Finally 400
µl of binding buffer was added and analyzed by FACSVantage™ SE system (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA).
Cells in stage of apoptosis were differentiated depending
on the location in quadrant (annexin V +, PI -; early stage)
and (annexin V +, PI +; late stage) [34].

USP17L and USP17N were subcloned into pEGFP-C1 and

and transfected into HeLa cells using ExGen500 (Fermen-

tas, Hanover, MD, USA). After 48 hours, the localization
of GFP-tagged USP17L and RFP-tagged USP17N was
observed using a confocal microscopy (Radiance 2100
2Q, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). In order to observe the
morphology of nuclei for HeLa cells, DAPI staining was
performed. After the fixation, 5 µl of DAPI staining solution (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was
added in wells containing HeLa cells, which express either
GFP-tagged USP17L or RFP-tagged USP17N. Stained cells
were observed using Nikon Eclipse E600 microscopy.
Hyaluronan- and RNA-binding assays
These assays were previously described [29]. 9 µg of
pcDNA3-myc-USP17L or pcDNA3-myc-USP17N was
transiently transfected into 1 × 106 HeLa cells in 100Φ
dish by ExGen500 transfection reagent (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA). The supernatant from lysates was divided
into 100 µl aliquots in Eppendorf tube and incubated at
room temperature with 50 µg of hyaluronan (H5388,

Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). For RNA binding assay, this
procedure was repeated with using total RNA of HeLa cells
instead of hyaluronan.
