Abstract
Background: Onychophora (velvet worms) represent the most basal arthropod group and play a
pivotal role in the current discussion on the evolution of nervous systems and segmentation in
arthropods. Although there is a wealth of information on the immunolocalization of serotonin (5hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in various euarthropods, as yet no comparable localization data are
available for Onychophora. In order to understand how the onychophoran nervous system
compares to that of other arthropods, we studied the distribution of serotonin-like
immunoreactive neurons and histological characteristics of ventral nerve cords in Metaperipatus
blainvillei (Onychophora, Peripatopsidae) and Epiperipatus biolleyi (Onychophora, Peripatidae).
Results: We demonstrate that paired leg nerves are the only segmental structures associated with
the onychophoran nerve cord. Although the median commissures and peripheral nerves show a
repeated pattern, their arrangement is independent from body segments characterized by the
position of legs and associated structures. Moreover, the somata of serotonin-like immunoreactive
neurons do not show any ordered arrangement in both species studied but are instead scattered
throughout the entire length of each nerve cord. We observed neither a serially iterated nor a
bilaterally symmetric pattern, which is in contrast to the strictly segmental arrangement of
serotonergic neurons in other arthropods.
Conclusion: Our histological findings and immunolocalization experiments highlight the medullary
organization of the onychophoran nerve cord and argue against segmental ganglia of the typical
euarthropodan type being an ancestral feature of Onychophora. These results contradict a priori
assumptions of segmental ganglia being an ancestral feature of arthropods and, thus, weaken the
traditional Articulata hypothesis, which proposes a sistergroup relationship of Annelida and
Arthropoda.

Background
Onychophora (or "velvet worms", Figure 1A and 1B) are
commonly regarded as the sistergroup of Euarthropoda,
i.e. Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Crustacea, and Hexapoda [16]. Morphologically onychophorans closely resemble the

extinct Cambrian lobopodians, which is why they are by
some authors considered as "living fossils" [7]. Due to
their basal position within the Arthropoda, Onychophora
represent a key group for the current discussion on the
evolution of arthropods [8-11].

Currently, there are two competing hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic position of Arthropoda within the
Bilateria: (1) the traditional Articulata concept, and (2)
the Ecdysozoa hypothesis [10,12-14]. In the controversial
debates on the validity of either hypothesis, the structure
of the nervous system is one of the most contentious
issues [9,12,14-16]. According to the Articulata hypothesis (Figure 2A), which proposes a sistergroup relationship
of Annelida and Arthropoda, a "rope ladder-like" nervous
system (not to be confused with the "ladder-like" organization in flatworms and some other bilaterians), is a
synapomorphy of these taxa [1,12,13,17-19]. The rope
ladder-like nervous system is characterized by segmental,
bilaterally arranged ganglia, which are longitudinally
linked by connectives (axonal tracts without associated
neuronal cell bodies) and transversely linked by commissures [20,21]. In many arthropods, the bilateral ganglia in
each body segment have been fused, thus forming
unpaired structures. Yet, according to the competing
Ecdysozoa hypothesis (Figure 2B), segmental ganglia do
not necessarily represent an ancestral feature of arthropods since they are absent in their next relatives, i.e. nematodes, priapulids, and allies. Only in kinorhynchs, which
show an orthogonal nervous system, the mid-dorsal and
mid-ventral longitudinal nerve cords are ganglionated
[22]. Under the Ecdysozoa concept, segmental condensations of neuronal cell bodies, i.e. ganglia, might therefore
have evolved convergently in Annelida and Arthropoda
[21].
Notably, segmental ganglia, as seen in euarthropods, do
not occur in Onychophora [23-25]. According to the
Articulata hypothesis, segmental ganglia must thus have
been reduced or modified in this taxon (Figure 2A;
[12,18,19]). Based on studies of the nervous system in
Onychophora, however, there are contrary views as to
whether the structural correlates or "rudiments" of segmental ganglia occur in this group [24,25]. If no such correlates or remnants exist in Onychophora, this feature

would not be useful for supporting the homology of segmentation in Annelida and Arthropoda [1,12,13,18],
which would seriously compromise the Articulata
hypothesis.
Immunolocalization of serotonin seems to be well suited
to explore segmental characteristics of nerve cords in a
phylogenetic context. In representatives of Echiura, which
lack external body segmentation, recent immunocytochemical studies have shown that serotonin-like immunoreactive (5-HT-lir) neurons are nevertheless arranged in

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:118

repeated units along the ventral nerve cord [26,27]. These
repeated units were suggested to correspond to the typical
segmental ganglia in Annelida, suggesting that the ventral
nervous system was primarily segmented in Echiura and
that this taxon might be closely related to or may even represent an in-group of Annelida [27]. This assumption is
supported by the phylogenetic analyses of different
molecular data sets [28-32]. Similar repeated sets of 5-HTlir neurons occur in the ventral nervous system of the
earthworm Lumbricus terrestris [33], an annelid species
with secondarily modified segmental ganglia. Comparable evidence of repeated sets of individually identifiable 5HT-lir neurons in Onychophora would suggest that segmental ganglia are an ancestral feature of Arthropoda
(albeit modified in Onychophora), supporting the Articulata rather than the Ecdysozoa hypothesis. Onychophora,
thus, represent an important group for understanding the
evolution of nervous systems in arthropods.
The arrangement and architecture of serotonin-like
immunoreactive neurons has been analyzed in a wide
range of different arthropod species (reviews [34,35]). In
all representatives of Euarthropoda studied thus far, segmentally iterated and bilaterally symmetric identifiable
sets of 5-HT-lir neurons are present [34-38]. Although
biogenic amines, including serotonin, have been shown
to be present in the onychophoran nervous system by histochemical methods [39,40] and immunolocalization
studies in the brain [41,42], no data are as yet available on
the arrangement of 5-HT-lir neurons within the ventral
nerve cord.

Figure 5A, further data not shown). Herein, each segment
is characterized by the position of legs and associated
structures (e.g. leg nerves), as there are no distinct metameric landmarks in the inter-pedal regions of the onychophoran body. At regular intervals, each cord gives rise to a
pair of lateral nerves innervating the legs (Figure 3; Figures
5C and 5D; Figure 6A). Additional peripheral nerves supplying the body wall musculature originate in the interpedal regions of successive segments (Figure 3; Figure 4C;
Figures 5C and 5D; Figures 6A and 6B). Within the body,
the nerve cords flank the gut in a ventrolateral position
(Figure 4A). They are dorsoventrally flattened and appear
oval in shape in cross-sections (Figure 4B). The internal
structure of each nerve cord is uniform throughout the
body, comprising a dorsal neuropil and a ventral, ventromedian and ventrolateral layer with neuronal somata
(Figures 4A and 4B). The median part of the neuropil
bears numerous giant fibers, two of which are larger than
the others (arrowheads in Figure 4B; see also [43]). On its
outer surface, i.e. towards the body cavity, each nerve cord
is enveloped by a thick layer of collagenous connective tissue.
Observations on several specimens of nerve cords of
Metaperipatus blainvillei and Epiperipatus biolleyi sectioned in sagittal, horizontal, and transverse planes, or
examined as whole-mount preparations (E. biolleyi: 3
specimens; M. blainvillei: 22 specimens) failed to reveal
distinct segmental thickenings (cf. Figures 5C and 5D; Figure 6; further data not shown).

This study describes the general morphology of the ventral nerve cord and the distribution of 5-HT-lir neurons in
two representatives of the major onychophoran taxa, Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae. We confirm that the onychophoran nerve cord is of medullary type characterized by a
scattered distribution of neuronal cell bodies along the
antero-posterior body axis and the absence of somata-free
connectives. In addition, we do not find any serially iterated arrangement of 5-HT-lir neurons, suggesting that segmental ganglia are primarily absent and not secondarily
reduced in Onychophora. This finding clearly weakens
the traditional Articulata hypothesis as it shows that a
chain of ventral ganglia most likely does not represent an
ancestral feature of arthropods.

Results
General morphology of ventral nerve cords
The bilaterally paired ventral nerve cords of onychophorans represent longitudinal structures that are connected
with each other by numerous commissures (see schematic
in Figure 3 and Figures 4A and 4B). Typically, there are
nine commissures per body segment, but their number
varies from eight to ten in different segments (see, e.g.,

lateral leg nerves, and via peripheral nerves innervating
the body wall (Figure 4C; Figures 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D; Figures 6A and 6B). 5-HT-lir neurons were exclusively unipolar (Figures 4C and 4D; Figure 5B; Figures 6B and 6C).
Within the perikaryal layer of each nerve cord, the somata
of 5-HT-lir neurons are arranged mainly in the periphery,
i.e., near the ventral and ventrolateral surface of the nerve
cords (Figures 4C and 4D; Figures 5C and 5D; Figures 6B

µm in size. Their single neurites project towards the
neuropil without fasciculating with other processes (Figures 4C and 4D; Figure 5B; Figure 6C). The course of the
neurites could not be followed within the neuropil
because of the high level of labeling of 5-HT-lir fibers (cf.
Figure 4C).

Serotonin-like immunoreactivity
In accordance with earlier physiological and biochemical
studies [39,40] our data show that 5-HT-lir material is
widely distributed throughout the ventral nerve cords in
both species studied: Metaperipatus blainvillei and Epiperipatus biolleyi (Figures 4C and 4D; Figures 5A, 5B, 5C, and
5D; Figures 6A, 6B and 6C). No species-specific differences in the distribution patterns were observed. The
neuropil contains a dense network of 5-HT-lir fibers (Figure 4C). Labeled fibers exit the neuropil via the median
commissures towards the contralateral cord, via the paired

The analysis of vibratome sections as well as wholemount preparations showed that in both onychophoran
species studied the distribution of 5-HT-lir neurons does
not exhibit any ordered arrangement (Figures 4C and 4D;
Figures 5C and 5D; Figures 6A and 6C). The immunoreactive neurons (80–100 per hemisegment) are instead scattered randomly throughout the entire length of each nerve
cord (Figures 5C and 5D; Figure 6A). Specifically, we neither observed segmentally iterated nor bilaterally symmetric patterns. In addition, we did not find any
individually identifiable 5-HT-lir neurons.

Discussion
This study revealed that in Onychophora, the arrangement of 5-HT-lir neurons does not show any recognizable
serial or segmental organization, which is in contrast to
the strict segmentally iterated arrangement of 5-HT-lir
neurons in most other arthropods, including Chelicerata,
Myriapoda, Crustacea, and Hexapoda (see reviews
[34,35]). 5-HT-lir neurons are instead scattered throughout the entire length of each onychophoran nerve cord in
an apparently random fashion. Serotonin-like immunoreactivity accordingly does not provide any evidence for
modified ganglionic concentrations of neurons or even
ganglion rudiments in Onychophora. Our data clearly
support previous reports [23-25] in showing that the onychophoran nerve cord belongs to the medullary type
("Markstrang") of nervous systems that are characterized
by a scattered distribution of neuronal cell bodies along
the nerve cords and the absence of somata-free connectives (e.g. [20]). In this respect, the organization of the
onychophoran nerve cord resembles that of the longitudinal nerve cords in other bilaterians, such as Platyhelminthes [44,45], Gnathostomulida [46], Nemertea
[47], Mollusca [48], Nematoda [47], and some representatives of Annelida [20,21], rather than that in Euarthropoda. In Euarthropoda, typical bilaterally arranged
segmental ganglia are present, which are longitudinally
connected by connectives (axonal tracts without associ-

ated neuronal cell bodies) and transversely linked by
commissures. This fact contradicts recent suggestions of
segmental ganglia being a common or an ancestral feature
of Onychophora (figure 7 in [49]; figure 3 in [50] and
[16]; figure 14 in [41]). Furthermore, our data argue
against the claims [16,50] that only two commissures per
segment are characteristic of the onychophoran nervous
system. Yet, the onychophoran medullary type nervous
system, in which few elements e.g. the leg nerves (see
below) are serially iterated, may have served as the starting
point, from which the euarthropodan rope ladder-like
nervous system with its typical segmental characteristics
has evolved.
In contrast to previous neuroanatomical studies [24,51],
we found that paired nerves innervating the legs represent
the only segmentally arranged structures associated with
the onychophoran nerve cord. This layout closely corresponds with the organization of musculature in Onychophora since muscles supplying the legs are the only
segmental structures within the onychophoran muscular
system [8,52,53]. The metameric thickenings described by
Federow [24] correlate with the position of legs, which are
partially hollow and provide additional space for the
nerve cords to evade laterally when the animal's body is
contracted. Although the commissures and peripheral
nerves do show a repeated pattern, this organization is
independent from the segmental arrangement of other
structures and organs, i.e. legs, nephridia and heart ostia,
which are typical for each onychophoran body segment
[8,10,54]. In addition to the neuroanatomical data
obtained from adult specimens, ganglia as discrete gross
morphological entities are not apparent in the development of the onychophoran nerve cord [3,9,10,55-57].

Conclusion
Taken together, studies on neuroanatomy and neurogenesis [9,55,57] in Onychophora do not provide any evidence that segmental ganglia or a rope ladder-like
organization is an ancestral feature of the onychophoran
nerve cord. Rather, this structure shows many similarities
with the medullary or "Markstrang" type of many other
representatives of Bilateria [21,47,48], including platyhelminths [44,45]. Whether this type of organization represents an ancestral or derived feature of Onychophora
must be clarified by further comparative studies using
immunolabeling methods with other neuron-specific
markers. However, recent neuroanatomical studies on
representatives of Annelida [21] also contradict previous
assumptions that their nervous system originally had a
rope ladder-like organization like that seen in Euarthropoda. This strongly suggests that a rope-ladder type of nervous
system,
comprising
segmental
ganglionic
condensations linked by somata-free connectives, has
evolved convergently in annelids and arthropods. Thus,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/118

our results as well as recent immunocytochemical findings on annelids are in stark contrast to previous views
[1,12,17-19] that a priori suggest segmental ganglia to be
one of the synapomorphies uniting the Annelida and
Arthropoda. Therefore, the character "presence of segmental ganglia" can no longer be taken as supporting the
monophyly of Articulata since these structures were most
likely absent in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Euarthropoda.

Methods
Animals
Specimens of Metaperipatus blainvillei (Gervais, 1837), a
representative of the Peripatopsidae (Figure 1A), were
obtained from rotten logs in a forest near Lago Tinquilco
(Chile) in July 2004. Specimens of Epiperipatus biolleyi
(Bouvier, 1902), a member of the neotropical Peripatidae
(Figure 1B), were collected under moss and among plant
roots growing along the sides of a dirt road in the area of
Cascajal de Coronado, near San José (Costa Rica), in
October 2005. The animals were kept in cultures before
they were studied.
Histology and light microscopy
For histological studies, specimens of M. blainvillei were
anaesthetized in ethyl acetate vapor for a few minutes,
fixed in Bouin's fluid for several weeks, dehydrated in an
ethanol series, methylbenzoate and butanol, and embedded in paraplast (Kendall). Complete series of 5 to 7 µm
thin sections were made with steel blades on a microtome
(Reichert-Jung, 2050-supercut). The sections were stained
with an Azan staining method [58] and analyzed with a
light microscope (Olympus BX51) equipped with a color
digital camera (Colour View II, SIS).
Immunocytochemistry, fluorescence microscopy and
confocal laser scanning microscopy
For immunocytochemistry, either dissected nerve cords or
vibratome sections of the specimens were processed. For
vibratome sections, tissue from the trunk of late embryos
(shortly before birth), juveniles, and adult specimens of
M. blainvillei were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) at
room temperature. The tissue was then rinsed in several
changes of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% sodium azide and kept therein for several
days. After removing the gut and slime glands, the tissue
containing nerve cords was embedded in 7% agarose gel
at 60°C and cooled to room temperature. The trimmed
blocks were sectioned into series of 60–80 µm thin sections with steel blades on a vibratome (V 1000 plus Sectioning System, Vibratome Company). Sections were
washed in several changes of PBS and then pre-incubated
in PBS-TX (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% sodium
azide, and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h at room tem-

perature. Incubations with the primary antibody (rabbit
anti-serotonin, ImmunoStar Incorporated; diluted
1:1,000 in PBS-TX) were carried out overnight at room
temperature. The specimens were then washed in several
changes of PBS and incubated overnight in a secondary
antibody (anti-rabbit, conjugated to Alexa 488, Molecular
Probes; diluted 1:500 in PBS-TX). After washing in PBS,
the sections were mounted on glass slides in Gel Mount
(Sigma).
For whole-mount immunocytochemistry, dissected nerve
cords of M. blainvillei and E. biolleyi were dehydrated
through an ethanol series (50%, 70%, 95%, 2 × 100%; 6
min each) and the sheaths of connective tissue enclosing
each nerve cord made more permeable by incubation in
xylene for 2 min. After re-hydration and several washes in
PBS, the tissue was incubated in a NaBH4 solution (0.5%
in PBS; 2 × 1 h) in order to minimize autofluorescence. All
of the following steps were carried out at 37°C. After several washes in PBS, the sheath enclosing each nerve cord
was digested with collagenase and hyaluronidase (Sigma;
1 mg/ml each in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100) for 1 h. After
washing in PBS, the tissue was pre-incubated in a blocking
solution (10% bovine serum albumin + 0.5% Triton X100 in PBS) for 2 h, and incubated with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-serotonin, ImmunoStar Incorporated;
diluted 1:1,000 in PBS-TX) for 24 h. The incubation in the
secondary antibody and mounting was carried out as
described for vibratome sections.
Both the vibratome sections and whole-mounts were
viewed with either a fluorescence microscope (Olympus
BX61 equipped with an F-View II digital camera, SIS) or a
confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 410). Digital fluorescent images were processed with the LUCIA
4.82 and AnalySIS software packages, and Adobe Photoshop CS. The confocal images in this study are based on
stacks of 75 optical sections of z-series taken at 0.75 µm
intervals. Depth coded images were produced using
ImageJ 1.34q.
Specificity of antiserum
The antiserum against serotonin (ImmunoStar Incorporated, http://www.immunostar.com; Cat. No. 20080, Lot
No. 541016) is a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised
against serotonin coupled to bovine serum albumin
(BSA) with paraformaldehyde. The antiserum was quality
control tested by the manufacturer using standard immunohistochemical methods. According to the manufacturer, staining with the antiserum was completely
eliminated by pretreatment of the diluted antibody with
25 µg of serotonin coupled to BSA. We performed an
additional control and preadsorbed the diluted antiserum
with 10 mg/ml BSA for 4 h at room temperature. This
preadsorption did not affect the staining, thus, providing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/118

evidence that the antiserum does not recognize the carrier
molecule alone. The anti-serotonin antiserum (formerly
supplied by Immunonuclear Corp.) has thoroughly been
tested in preadsorption controls by Beltz and Kravitz [59].
These authors preadsorbed the antiserum with the original serotonin-BSA conjugate that was used for generation
of the antiserum, as supplied by the manufacturer. Preadsorption of the antibody in working dilution with formaldehyde cross-linked serotonin-BSA, in which the BSA
concentration was 300 µg/ml, with a BSA:serotonin ratio
of ca. 10:1 at 4°C for 24 h completely eliminated all staining [59]. The manufacturer also examined the cross reactivity of the antiserum. According to the data sheet, with 5
µg, 10 µg, and 25 µg amounts, the following substances
did not react with the antiserum diluted to 1:20,000 using
the horse radish peroxidase (HRP) labeling method: 5hydroxytryptophan, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and
dopamine. In control experiments for possible nonspecific binding of the secondary antiserum, we omitted the
primary antiserum, replaced it with blocking solution,
and followed the labeling protocol as above. In these
cases, staining was absent. Despite this set of controls, we
cannot fully exclude that the antiserum could be binding
to serotonin-related substances in addition to serotonin.
We therefore refer to the labeling that we observed as "5HT-like immunoreactivity" or "5-HT-lir" throughout the
text.
Determination of neuron numbers
A precise number of 5-HT-lir neurons or statistics on their
distribution cannot be given because of the ambiguity of
segmental boundaries within the nerve cords. Instead, we
provide an approximate range of neuron numbers per
hemisegment (see "Serotonin-like Immunoreactivity" in
the Results). This range is based on counts from 4 nerve
cords with 20 segments in two specimens of E. biolleyi and
2 nerve cords with 15 segments in a specimen of M. blainvillei, respectively (see also Figures 5C and 5D; Figure 6A,
in which the neuron numbers fell into the range given in
the Results).
