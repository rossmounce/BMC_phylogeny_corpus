Background
While neutralizing antibodies should limit the replication
of HIV/SIV in the infected individual, autologous neutralizing antibodies are generated too late following HIV/SIV
infection to contribute to early virus control. The present
study addresses whether vaccine-induced immune
responses accelerate the generation of autologous neutralizing antibodies following SIV challenge in rhesus monkeys, and if this antibody response shapes viral sequence
evolution.

Methods
Two groups of six monkeys were vaccinated with a plasmid DNA prime/recombinant adenovirus serotype 5
boost regimen of either gag/pol or env/gag/pol immunogens and subsequently challenged with SIVmac251. Fulllength envelope from plasma virus was sequenced by single genome amplification to identify sites of envelope
mutations. The rate of the generation of an autologous
neutralizing antibody response, and the impact of envelope mutations on escape from antibody neutralization
were evaluated using a luciferase reporter gene-based neutralization assay.

cinated group conferred immune pressure on the virus.
Phylogenetic analysis of envelope sequences illustrated
that env vaccination was associated with an increased
accumulation of mutations. Prevalent mutations in
sequences from gag/pol vaccinees included deletions in
both variable loops 1(V1) and 4, whereas deletions in the
env-vaccinees occurred only in V1. A pseudovirion
expressing a V1 loop deletion and accompanying point
mutations conferred delayed neutralization and escape to
sera from env-vaccinees. These findings suggest that env
vaccination elicited neutralizing antibodies focused on
V1.

Conclusion
Our results indicate that env vaccination is associated with
an accelerated development of autologous neutralizing
antibodies. These antibodies were focused at least in part
on the V1 region of Env, since there was selective pressure
in this region of the envelope for the evolution of mutational changes.

Results
The gag/pol vaccinated monkeys developed autologous
neutralizing antibody responses by 18 weeks post-challenge, while the env/gag/pol vaccinated monkeys developed this response as early as 7 weeks post-challenge.
Moreover, this antibody response in the env/gag/pol-vac-
