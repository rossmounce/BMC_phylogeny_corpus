Abstract
Background: The endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis infects a broad range of arthropod and filarial
nematode hosts. These diverse associations form an attractive model for understanding
host:symbiont coevolution. Wolbachia's ubiquity and ability to dramatically alter host reproductive
biology also form the foundation of research strategies aimed at controlling insect pests and vectorborne disease. The Wolbachia strains that infect nematodes are phylogenetically distinct, strictly
vertically transmitted, and required by their hosts for growth and reproduction. Insects in contrast
form more fluid associations with Wolbachia. In these taxa, host populations are most often
polymorphic for infection, horizontal transmission occurs between distantly related hosts, and
direct fitness effects on hosts are mild. Despite extensive interest in the Wolbachia system for many
years, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate its varied interactions
with different hosts. We have compared the genomes of the Wolbachia that infect Drosophila
melanogaster, wMel and the nematode Brugia malayi, wBm to that of an outgroup Anaplasma
marginale to identify genes that have experienced diversifying selection in the Wolbachia lineages.
The goal of the study was to identify likely molecular mechanisms of the symbiosis and to
understand the nature of the diverse association across different hosts.
Results: The prevalence of selection was far greater in wMel than wBm. Genes contributing to
DNA metabolism, cofactor biosynthesis, and secretion were positively selected in both lineages. In
wMel there was a greater emphasis on DNA repair, cell division, protein stability, and cell envelope
synthesis.
Conclusion: Secretion pathways and outer surface protein encoding genes are highly affected by
selection in keeping with host:parasite theory. If evidence of selection on various cofactor
molecules reflects possible provisioning, then both insect as well as nematode Wolbachia may be
providing substances to hosts. Selection on cell envelope synthesis, DNA replication and repair
machinery, heat shock, and two component switching suggest strategies insect Wolbachia may
employ to cope with diverse host and intra-host environments.

Background
Intracellular bacterial symbiont associations are extremely
common in invertebrates. The capacity for these symbionts to shape host biology is immense and includes documented effects on host reproduction [1], food preference
[2], locomotion [3], and interspecific competition [4].
Teasing apart the contributions of insect and symbiont
genomes to such multi-organism determined phenotypes
is necessary if the evolution and ecology of both partners
are to be understood. This can be challenging, because the
complex biotic interaction also makes these systems less
tractable experimentally. Comparative study of sequenced
symbiont genomes and their relatives is offering new
means to direct empirical study of symbiosis [5].
The endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis infects a wide range
of arthropod and filarial nematode hosts. Across its host
range the microbe is associated with diverse phenotypic
outcomes. The Wolbachia-nematode associations are
mutualistic while all other associations could be
described as commensal or parasitic in nature. In nematodes the infection is confined to the nematode reproductive tract and the hypodermal tissue where the microbe
plays an integral role in host viability and reproduction
[6,7]. Phylogenies of Wolbachia and their nematode hosts
are congruent, reflecting a long history of strict vertical
transmission [8]. Tight associations like these are predicted to generate genome reduction [9], as host support
of symbiont requirements leads to degradation and loss of
the genes in these redundant pathways. Consistent with
this prediction, the genome of the Wolbachia strain that
infects Brugia malayi (wBm) is much smaller and highly
streamlined relative to the genomes of free-living bacteria
and other Wolbachia [10,11].
The Wolbachia-arthropod association, in contrast, is more
fluid in nature. Infections are not fixed in populations and
most appear to be mild in their effects on host fitness
[12,13]. Horizontal transmission among host lineages is
common on a phylogenetic time scale, meaning closely
related Wolbachia can be found in taxonomically diverse
hosts [14]. Infections can be found in numerous somatic
tissues as well as the gonads [15]. The presence of Wolbachia in insect hemolymph in combination with recent
experimental work also suggests that the bacteria may be
exposed to extracellular environments for sustained periods [16]. Across the arthropods Wolbachia also induces a
broad range of reproductive manipulations including
feminization, male killing, cytoplasmic incompatibility,
and parthenogenesis [1,17,18]. The pattern of Wolbachia
tissue distribution, infection densities, induced fitness
effects, and reproductive manipulations vary greatly
within the arthropods and are the result of host and bacterial genotype interactions [19-22].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/68

Here we report the results of genome wide screens for the
presence of diversifying selection in the Wolbachia that
infect the filarial nematode, Brugia malayi wBm [10] and
the insect Drosophila melanogaster, wMel [11]. Per gene
estimates of nonsynonyous substitution per nonsynonymous site versus synonymous substitution per synonymous site (dN/dS) in the Wolbachia relative to the outgroup
species, Anaplasma marginale [23] were used to infer past
history of positive selection [24]. This approach has been
utilized previously to explore the genetic basis of complex
phenotypes in a diverse range of taxa [24-29]. By identifying key molecular adaptations in each of the two Wolbachia lineages, we sought to shed light the mechanistic
basis of the Wolbachia symbiosis and how it might vary
with respect to different hosts. We hypothesized that
genes whose encoded proteins were involved with secretion or were localized to the Wolbachia cell surface would
show evidence of strong selection due to their interaction
with the host. We also expected to find evidence of selection on pathways that could be used for host provisioning
in wBm. The screen confirmed both these hypotheses. The
genomic comparisons also revealed possible points of
host provisioning in wMel and strategies Wolbachia may
have evolved for coping with diverse hosts and intra host
environments.

Results & Discussion
Summary
Of the 591 loci examined, 60 in wBm and 101 in wMel
bore signatures of positive selection (see Additional file
1). The proportion of genes affected by diversifying selection in Wolbachia was higher than reports from other
screens in bacteria [26] and may reflect the well-documented phenomenon of rapid evolution in endosymbionts [30-32]. The small effective population sizes of these
bacteria would predict more rapid fixation of nonsynonymous mutations due to drift and hence generate higher
average ratios of dN to dS [33]. The distribution of significant genes was not clumped with respect to genome position (data not shown) with the exception of the ribosomal
protein encoding genes, which are members of an operon.
Excluding hypothetical and unknown groups, the significant genes represent 13 functional classes (GenomeAtlas
annotation) in wBm and 15 in wMel (TIGR annotation)
(Fig. 1 and see Additional file 1). Genes comprising the
biological role categories nucleotide biosynthesis, amino
acid biosynthesis, and transport/secretion were similarly
affected by diversifying selection in both genomes. In general, evidence of selection was more common in the wMel
genome. Larger numbers of genes in the role categories of
DNA metabolism, energy metabolism, protein synthesis,
cell envelope synthesis, cofactor biosynthesis, and protein
fate were disproportionately affected in wMel (Fig. 1). We
have reviewed the gene composition for several of these

functional categories and speculate on their role in the
evolution of insect vs. nematodee symbiont associations.
Purifying selection
An examination of the dN/dS ratios also highlighted those
genes experiencing extreme levels purifying selection in
either of the Wolbachia lineages. A total of 323 genes in the
wBm lineage and 250 genes in wMel had a ratio < 1.0. We
then examined only the most severely affected genes (dN/
dS < 0.2) in each lineage and asked whether genes from
any of the functional categories were over-represented.
Most of the major functional classes were represented by
only a small number of genes. The exceptions were the
categories of synthesis and modification of ribosomal
proteins in both genomes and the biosynthesis and degradation of cell envelope in wBm only. The former represented ~15% of genes with dN/dS < 0.2 and the latter 8%
of the genes for wBm. The extreme conservation in ribosomal protein evolution is not surprising given their essen-

tial and conserved cellular functions for all kingdoms of
life. Purifying selection on cell envelope component genes
in wBm is interesting given that these same genes are experiencing diversifying selection in wMel (see Additional file
1). The Wolbachia cell envelope may be exposed to vastly
different environments in the insect versus nematode
hosts. Differences in how selection is operating on the
genes encoding membrane proteins may reflect adaptation to lineage specific ecological niches (see Direct contact
with the host below).
Evidence of provisioning
The basis of Wolbachia's dependence on its host and the
nature of any benefits provided to hosts are two fundamental unknown aspects of this symbiotic association.
The completed genome sequences of wBm and wMel
[10,11] have only recently advanced our understanding of
what Wolbachia can and cannot synthesize and what it
may be transporting across its membrane. Symbiont pro-

visioning of insect hosts is hypothesized for many associations and has been documented in numerous insects
including; aphids [34], tsetse flies [35], rice weevils [36],
and ants [37]. Evidence of provisioning would not be surprising in the nematode relationships as Wolbachia is
clearly acting as a mutualist. Arthropod Wolbachia have
traditionally been thought of as parasitic and therefore the
presence of diversifying selection on a number of cofactor
biosynthesis genes is particularly exciting (Fig. 2 & see
Additional file 1).
Both Wolbachia genomes lack complete pathways for de
novo synthesis of coenzyme A, NAD, biotin, lipoate, ubiquinone, and folate; presumably the host supplements
these compounds [10,11]. Several genes that encode for
components of these disrupted biosynthetic pathways
show evidence of positive selection in wMel and may
reflect the molecular evolutionary process of integrating
host and symbiont systems (Fig. 2 & see Additional file 1).
Selection on genes in these same pathways was also
detected in wBm, but under less stringent rejection criteria
(see Additional file 1). Unlike the above listed cofactors,
riboflavin biosynthesis pathways are complete in both
Wolbachia strains. Evidence for positive selection on riboflavin synthesis was present in wMel (Fig. 2, Model p <
0.001, & Fisher's p < 0.001) and again in wBm under
slightly less stringent criteria (see Additional file 1). Symbiont provisioning of riboflavin has been documented in
both weevil-SOPE and aphid-Buchnera associations
[36,38]. Two members of the heme biosynthetic pathway
(of seven genes in total) were affected by selection in
wMel. Additional genes in the heme biosynthesis pathway
were also identified in both wBm and wMel when less
stringent rejection criteria were applied (see Additional
file 1). An examination of the Brugia malayi genome [10]
suggests that the nematode may be incapable of synthesizing its own heme and therefore it is possible that wBm

Wolbachia may be provisioning its host with heme intermediates. Although insect hosts are not dependent on
Wolbachia for heme biosynthesis, the microbe may supplement host stores or play an additional role in iron
homeostasis.
In addition to the provision of metabolic cofactors, invertebrate hosts may also benefit from an additional source
of nucleotides provided by Wolbachia. Multiple genes in
this functional category (seven in wBm and five in wMel,
Fig. 1) were affected by positive selection (see Additional
file 1). Other endosymbionts, including the parasitic Rickettsia or beneficial Buchnera, scavenge nucleotides from
the host environment via ATP/ADP translocases. Wolbachia, however encodes complete purine and pyrimidine
biosynthetic pathways, and lacks the nucleotide translocase found in the closely related Rickettsia [10,11]. The
provision of nucleotides by wBm and wMel could benefit
their hosts during periods of rapid DNA replication and
cellular division, such as during oogenesis and embryogenesis [10]. Lastly, there is widespread evidence of diversifying selection in both genomes on amino acid
biosynthetic pathway genes (Fig 1 and see Additional file
1). Wolbachia lack many genes in the biosynthetic pathways for amino acids and therefore it is less likely they are
provisioning hosts in this regard [10,11].
Coordination of cell division with the host
The coordination of symbiont replication with host cell
division is required to prevent either loss of the symbiont
within the host or over replication leading to pathology
within the host [1], such as that occurring with wMelPop.
The mechanisms underlying this balancing act in Wolbachia-host associations are unknown. Filarial Wolbachia
densities increase when the infection passes from the
insect vector into the mammalian host [39,40]. Arthropod Wolbachia are also present at different densities

depending on host species [20], host developmental
phase [41], and tissue distribution [15,42]. For a number
of insect species, Wolbachia has the additional challenge
of dealing with host diapause where the microbe's replication would have to be slowed or stopped temporarily to
maintain synchrony with host cell division [43].

division and DNA replication genes may affect efficiency
of growth and underpin coordination with host cell activities. This is a particular challenge for wMel given the need
to a adapt to a broader range of host cell types, host cell
division rates, extracellular/intracellular environments,
and ambient temperatures.

Several genes associated with cell division particularly
with regulation of growth rates, appear to be positively
selected in wMel (Fig. 3), including the cell division genes
ftsA [44], ftsK [45], and rne [46]. Also affected in wMel, is
surE [47] whose expression is associated with adaptation
to stressful conditions and survival of stationary phase in
E. coli. Another rate limiting step in terms of growth and
cell division that may be targeted by selection is protein
synthesis. The processes of synthesis and modification of
ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and base modification were heavily affected in both genomes (included in
Protein synthesis, Fig. 1 and see Additional file 1). These
molecular adaptations may affect rates of cell cycling indirectly by regulating rates of protein synthesis.

Coping with Muller's ratchet
The accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in symbionts due to repeated bottlenecking during transmission
between hosts has been used to predict the irreversible
degradation of symbiont genomes via the process of
Muller's ratchet [48]. Selection for more effective repair or
recombination systems may mitigate the effects of the
ratchet upstream in the process. Both Wolbachia genomes
appear to contain a functional set of DNA repair enzymes.
Two genes in wBm and five genes in wMel encoding
recombination and/or repair proteins were affected by
positive selection. Muller's ratchet could be mitigated by
genetic recombination among divergent strains of Wolbachia that infect a single host. However, this is not likely
to occur for wBm where multiple divergent strains of Wolbachia do not coexist within a single host. Multiple genes
involved with aminoacylation of tRNAs were also affected
by positive selection (see Additional file 1). These proteins ensure fidelity of translation by providing error correction [49]. The prevalence of selection was roughly
equal in wBm and wMel (six vs. nine genes, respectively)
and could represent another strategy for minimizing
effects of other sources of error on protein performance.

In both genomes, diversifying selection on genes involved
with DNA replication was surprisingly common given the
fundamental conserved nature of the DNA replication
process (Fig. 4). A recent screen of uropathogenic E. coli
relative to non-pathogenic strains, also revealed diversifying selection on cell division & DNA metabolism genes
[26]. These pathogenic strains in their shift from commensal origins have gained the ability to invade and live
inside host cells. Heightened evolutionary change in cell

Variable environments
The accumulation of slightly deleterious mutants in Buchnera [48] by the process of Muller's ratchet has predicted
the importance of chaperones in maintaining the integrity
of proteins in symbionts. Evidence for positive selection
on groEL in Buchnera has been interpreted as support for
the action of the ratchet [50]. The protein, GroEL compensates for mildly deleterious mutations by permitting
proper structures to form. This screen has identified selection on other heat shock genes and regulators of the heat
shock process in including dnaK [50], htpG [51]hscA [52],
several clp genes [53], and multiple proteases (Fig. 5). The
prevalence of selection on genes encoding heat shock proteins is higher in wMel than in wBm. Several heat shock
encoding genes do display evidence of diversifying in
wBm under less stringent rejection criteria (see Additional
file 1). It is possible that the heat shock system forms part
of a strategy for dealing with variable environments that
may include, exposure to changing temperatures, different intracellular and extracellular environments. While
the superhosts of filarial Wolbachia include the insect vector, the vast proportion of the nematode lifecycle is spent
within a mammalian host. Shifts between mammalian
and insect hosts would expose the Wolbachia to different
temperatures and though required for long-term survival
would be temporally infrequent. Wolbachia that infect
arthropods on the other hand may be exposed to more
fluctuating temperature regimes on shorter time scales as
insects cannot thermoregulate and thus body temperature
is more likely to vary over a 24-hour period. These Wol-

bachia are also likely to be exposed to both extracellular as
well as diverse intracellular environments [15,16].
In wMel one of the genes encoding part of the two-component system also exhibited evidence of positive selection (see Additional file 1, signal transduction). The twocomponent system forms the basis of a small-molecule
signaling pathway and is thought to play a role in quorum
sensing [54]. In other bacteria these pathways affect
exopolysaccharide synthesis, biofilm formation, motility,
cell differentiation, and virulence. Genes comprising quorum-sensing systems have previously been shown to be
targets of selection [55]. Selection on this pathway in
wMel may indicate a mechanism for rapidly inducing
widespread transcriptional changes in response to shifting
habitats.
Direct contact with the host
The cell envelope and surface proteins represent the most
obvious candidates for host interaction. Strong diversifying selection on genes encoding surface proteins in parasites, including Wolbachia [27] has been well documented
[56]. Five genes in wMel and one gene in wBm involved
with biosynthesis of peptidoglycan or cell envelope
assembly were positively selected (Fig. 6). Peptidoglycan
serves as one of the primary recognition molecules for the
insect innate immune response and host immune systems
exploit variation in the structure and metabolism of peptidoglycan for the recognition of invading bacteria [57]. It
is possible that the diversifying selection in cell envelope

synthesis genes has been driven by immune evasion pressure. This may be especially important in wMel in times of
extracellularity such as infection of hemolymph [15,16].
An alternate explanation is that because production of
peptidoglycan is tightly linked with DNA replication, cell
growth, and cell division, selection pressure on aspects of
bacterial growth including growth phase and growth rate
may have driven selection in peptidoglycan synthesis
[58]. Several other genes encoding outer membrane proteins also exhibited evidence of selection in both genomes
(Fig. 6 other and see Additional file 1, Hypotheticals).
Communication with the host & extracellular environment
For an intracellular microbe, secretion and import represent the main route of communication with the host and
the extracellular environment. While both wMel and wBm
must communicate with their primary hosts, filarial Wolbachia may also play a role in communication with the
mammalian or insect super hosts via their occupation of
the hypodermal cells. These cells form channels and are
involved with secretion between nematode and super
hosts [59,60]. A large number of genes encoding proteins
underlying secretion pathways were under selection, three
in wBm and four in wMel (Fig. 7). These genes represent
the Type I secretion system (ABC transporter), Type IV
secretion system (vir genes), and SRP (signal recognition
protein) and Sec pathways (secY, yidC, and yajC). The Type
I system is widespread in bacteria and aids in the secretion
of diverse proteins [61]. Type IV secretion facilitates hostendosymbiont communication in a broad range of intracellular bacteria [62]. The Sec pathway comprises chaperones, transport machinery, and a system of pores that
carry proteins from the ribosome to the extracellular

space. The SRP pathway targets proteins from the ribosome to Sec pathway pores [63].
Ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins are common
in eukaryotes and viruses and are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions. ANK encoding genes are unusually common in the Wolbachia genome relative to other
bacteria. The ANK containing proteins are especially interesting in the Wolbachia system given their possible
involvement in determining reproductive phenotypes or
host specificity [64,65]. In Anaplasma phagocytophilum
[66], one of these proteins is secreted into the host cell
where it binds host chromatin and may affect host gene
expression. Only one gene encoding an ANK protein
exhibited diversifying selection in our screen (Fig. 3). The
functional role of this protein in Wolbachia is not known.

Conclusion
There are a number of caveats associated with the interpretation of genome wide screens for selection [67]. The
methods employed here should be fairly conservative
given, the use of per gene measures of dN/dS that are more
likely to detect only dominant features of a gene, the statistical tests of difference between dN & dS, and use of multiple test correction procedures. We cannot completely
exclude issues of saturation and increased fixation of nonsynonymous mutations in populations with small Ne
[33]. The results are also highly defined by the choice of
outgroup. As more genome sequences become available
future screens between strains within the Wolbachia genus
may provide finer scale comparison among lineages. The
trends identified here in terms of biological process, while
not proof of adaptation, highlight the most likely points

of interaction between hosts and symbionts. These areas
may be targeted for empirical study in hopes of better
understanding the mechanistic basis of Wolbachia symbiosis.
From this screen we would suggest the following hypotheses for further empirical testing. Both wMel and wBm
may provision hosts with the following compounds or
their intermediates; heme, riboflavin, ubiquinone, folate,
and nucleotides. Rearing the hosts under restricted diets
or more natural field conditions could reveal yet undescribed Wolbachia associated fitness benefits, particularly
in insects. Regulating DNA replication and cell division
may not only be a requirement for successful intracellularity, but also the key to adaptation to diverse cellular environments, temperatures, and host ranges in insect hosts.
Enhanced DNA repair, improved translation fidelity, and
the heat shock response may be adaptive responses to the
action of Muller's ratchet in these small bottlenecked populations. The heat shock response in combination and
two-component switching may be employed by insect
Wolbachia to cope with variable host environments. Communication with the host is fundamental for both Wolbachia and evidence of diversifying selection is present in
multiple secretion pathways. Insect Wolbachia are
uniquely experiencing selection on cell envelope synthesis genes. This may reflect a greater exposure to effector
molecules of the host immune system.

Methods
Selection and alignment of gene orthologs
Anaplasma marginale (St. marie's strain) [68] was selected
as the outgroup as it is the closest known relative to Wolbachia [23]. A member of the Î±-proteobacteria, A. marginale is a pathogen of cattle that is vectored primarily by
ticks [68]. Sequences of wMel, wBm and A. marginale protein encoding genes â 1195, 805 and 949 respectively â
were obtained from the RefSeq database. Proteins were
considered orthologous if each combination of Blast
searches (six in this three-way comparison) identified the
same gene as the best scoring match [25,69]. Ambiguous
matches with little sequence similarity and very short
alignments were eliminated by accepting only Blast hits
with e-values less than or equal to 1 Ã 10-6. All known
pseudogenes and phage sequences were excluded. The
amino acid sequences for the 591 orthologs selected by
the above procedure were then aligned with ClustalW ver.
1.83 [70] using default parameters and the resulting alignments back-translated into their DNA sequence, preserving patterns of indels from protein alignments.
Inference of positive selection
The likelihood ratio test of the null hypothesis of constant
rates of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site over synonymous substitutions per synony-

mous site (dN/dS) among all three lineages was performed
on each triplet of genes using codon-based maximum
likelihood models. The models were implemented using
codeml â a program for codon-based substitution models
from PAML package ver. 3.14 [24]. All models were implemented to utilize one dN/dS ratio among all amino acid
sites [71]. The likelihood test was performed as a onesided chi-square test of the null hypothesis H0 assuming
one dN/dS ratio among all three lineages versus alternative
hypotheses HA and HB allowing for two dN/dS ratios â one
for wBm or wMel respectively, and a second for the
remaining two lineages (branch-specific model).
Obtained log likelihood ratios were tested for significance
using the upper critical value of chi-square distribution for
one degree of freedom. The null hypothesis of constant
dN/dS ratio among all three lineages was rejected when two
times the log likelihood was greater than 3.84. A Benjamini & Hochberg multiple test correction [72] was
employed in combination with a critical rejection value, Î±
= 0.001. As random numbers are used to start the maximum likelihood iterations, we repeated the above analysis five times to check for convergence of the models.
Average value and standard deviation of the focal lineages
dN/dS ratios were used to assess model convergence. The
supplemental tables report mean dN and dS values across
the five replicate analyses. A number of genes with very
small mean dS produced artificially inflated ratios at the
reportable limit of codeml (999). In these cases the ratios
themselves are not particularly informative (Fig. 2, dN/dS =
999, unreportable). We therefore have used Fisher's exact
test [73] (p â¤ 0.001 & Benjamini & Hochberg multiple test
correction) [72] for all loci to identify genes where dN was
significantly different (and larger) from dS. All genes of
interest reported here have therefore met both the significance criteria under the appropriate model of selection
and possess report a mean dN that is significantly different
and greater from the mean dS.
Genome characteristics and assumptions of Codeml
The assumptions of codeml include similarity of base
composition and codon usage patterns as well as calculable genetic distances across the sequences being compared. The wBm and wMel genomes have very similar base
compositions, 34.1 [10] and 35.2% GC [11]. Anaplasma
marginale is 48.9% GC [68]. A comparison of codon usage
patterns between the three genomes by paired t-tests
revealed no statistical differences (data not shown). Mean
dN and dS values were 0.056 Â± 0.002 and 0.14 Â± 0.008 for
wBm/HA and 0.049 Â± 0.001 and 0.10 Â± 0.007 for wMel/
HB, respectively. Genetic distances are large enough that
dN/dS [74] should not suffer from a time lag. Alternatively,
genes experiencing a high degree of divergence and more
specifically saturation could lead to overestimates of dN/
dS. Anismova et al modeled the effects of various parame-

ters including divergence on both power and accuracy of
the likelihood ratio test [75]. Our datasets (three taxa,
mean gene length in codons â 343 Transition/transversion ratio â 4.0, and median dN/dS â 0.3 for both HA and
HB) are most similar to the reported results of experiment
C. These simulations identified no type I error at Î± = 0.01.
This study relies on a more stringent Î± and inspection of
the data indicates that most significant genes possess high
dN values relative to dS (see Additional file 1) and are
therefore not likely to be artifacts of saturation.
