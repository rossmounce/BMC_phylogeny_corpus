Abstract
Background: With the rapid growth in the availability of genome sequence data, the automated
identification of orthologous genes between species (orthologs) is of fundamental importance to
facilitate functional annotation and studies on comparative and evolutionary genomics. Genes with
no apparent orthologs between the bovine and human genome may be responsible for major
differences between the species, however, such genes are often neglected in functional genomics
studies.
Results: A BLAST-based method was exploited to explore the current annotation and orthology
predictions in Ensembl. Genes with no orthologs between the two genomes were classified into
groups based on alignments, ontology, manual curation and publicly available information. Starting
from a high quality and specific set of orthology predictions, as provided by Ensembl, hidden
relationship between genes and genomes of different mammalian species were unveiled using a
highly sensitive approach, based on sequence similarity and genomic comparison.
Conclusions: The analysis identified 3,801 bovine genes with no orthologs in human and 1010
human genes with no orthologs in cow, among which 411 and 43 genes, respectively, had no match
at all in the other species. Most of the apparently non-orthologous genes may potentially have
orthologs which were missed in the annotation process, despite having a high percentage of
identity, because of differences in gene length and structure. The comparative analysis reported
here identified gene variants, new genes and species-specific features and gave an overview of the
other side of orthology which may help to improve the annotation of the bovine genome and the
knowledge of structural differences between species.

Background
With the rapid increase in the amount of genome
sequence data available, the automated identification of

orthologous genes between species becomes of fundamental importance to facilitate functional annotation and
for comparative or evolutionary genomics. Homologous

proteins descend from a common ancestor and may be
classified as either orthologous (orthologs) or paralogous
(paralogs)[1]. Orthologs are commonly defined as the
functional equivalent genes between species, which may
have diverged after a speciation event, whereas genes created by a duplication event, either before species divergence (out-paralogs) or after a speciation event (inparalogs), are known as paralogs. Orthologs typically
retain similar domain architecture and function and such
conservation is an important component in comparative
analysis as well as in the annotation of proteins of
unknown function, in the characterization of gene function, for evolutionary genomics and the identification of
conserved regulatory elements. In contrast, paralogs may
have diverged significantly and acquired new functions,
e.g. through point mutations or recombination between
domains [1], even though a recent review by Studer and
Robinson-Rechavi [2] proposed a model in which both
orthologs and paralogs diverge in proportion to time of
the duplication event and therefore functional changes
can occur for both.
Complete and precise delineation of protein coding genes
in the genome and the process of assigning gene orthology remains a challenging task in mammalian genomes
because of their large size, the difficulty of creating accurate gene models, the complexity of protein domain architecture and the high frequency of gene duplication events,
that create large gene families. Errors in ortholog predictions can significantly affect downstream analyses; as a
result there has been increasing interest in high quality
ortholog prediction techniques.
During the last decade, there have been several methods
proposed for routine generation of genome-wide orthology descriptions, which rely mainly on phylogeny,
homology or integrated approaches. Orthology detection
methods, based mainly on phylogeny, and implemented
in software such as RIO [3], Orthostrapper [4,5], PhiGs
[6], PhyOP [7], TreeFam [8], or based on evolutionary distance (RSD [9,10]), generally do not erroneously report
genes as orthologous (false positive, FP), but have a high
frequency of missed orthologs (false negative, FN). However, it is difficult to automate phylogenetic analysis
approaches for genome-wide analysis, therefore prediction of orthologs for large genome datasets has been typically performed using homology based methods which
compare reciprocal-best-BLAST-hits (RBH).
The most frequently used BLAST-based homology methods for detecting orthologous genes include those of
BLASTP [11], COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups [12]),
KOG (euKaryotic Orthologous Groups [13]), The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) EGO/TOGA database
[14], InParanoid/MultiParanoid [15-17], TribeMCL [18],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/604

OrthoMCL [19,20], KEGG Orthology [21], Roundup [10],
MSOAR [22], the OMA project [23] and HomoloGene
[24]. However, homology methods used to infer orthology often have high FP error rates and low FN error rates,
such as observed with BLASTP, where orthology "hits"
typically include true orthologs but also many false positive results [25], the later including paralogs and members
of gene families. Moreover, the BLAST searches often
return, as the highest scoring hit, a protein that is not the
nearest phylogenetic neighbour of the query sequence
[26]. In summary, phylogeny-based methods are characterized by high specificity and BLAST-based methods by
high sensitivity.
To bypass the limits of single phylogeny or homology
methods, in this work we used the Ensembl orthology
prediction pipeline as reference [27]. Ensembl uses an
integrated approach starting from a homology-based
method which builds gene-models using species-specific
known sequences and proteins from other species aligned
to the target genome. All annotated transcripts are based
on experimental evidence and the automated pipelines
rely on the mRNAs, ESTs and protein sequences submitted into public databases by the scientific community.
Therefore, Ensembl does not annotate genes for which
there is no prior evidence of a transcribed sequence. Next,
the gene orthology and paralogy predictions are generated
using a bioinformatic pipeline where maximum likelihood phylogenetic gene trees (generated by TreeBeST)
play a key role. This method produces trees that are the
most consistent with the conservation of synteny between
species and gives fewer anomalous topologies than single
protein-based phylogenetic methods [28]. The Ensembl
method does not provide a complete gene set for each species, as it has been demonstrated by genome annotation
with different methods that have been able to identify
many genes in addition to those annotated by the
Ensembl automated pipeline, e.g. 700 chicken genes in
addition to the Ensembl gene list [29] and more than
1,000 additional genes between mouse and human
genome [30].
The current cattle genome sequence (Btau version 4.0)
was based on about 7× genome coverage with 90% of the
total sequence placed on the 29 autosomes and X chromosome. This last release was assembled by creating
sequence contigs arranged into scaffolds, on the basis of
sequence overlap and BAC ends contig data. The scaffolds
were then placed on chromosomes and ordered using
BAC and radiation hybrid physical maps. Most sequence
contigs remain unchanged from the previous release
(Btau3.1), but scaffold assembly was improved. Automated annotation identified about 22,000 genes, with a
core set of 14,345 orthologs found between cattle and
seven mammalian species [31]. Over 4,000 genes were

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:604

also manually annotated and orthology prediction with
dog, human, mouse, rat, opossum, and platypus genomes
was resolved for more than 75% of the predicted bovine
genes.
In this work we developed a BLAST-based method to
explore the current annotation of the bovine genome and
to describe those genes that were classified as being nonorthologous between bovine and other mammalian species (human, mouse and dog), according to Ensembl classification. We used a double comparative approach to
identify a set of bovine genes that had no orthologs in the
other three mammalian species and a set of orthologs in
human, mouse and dog with no bovine counterparts.
Within the first set we expected to find genes with speciesspecific features, assembly and annotation problems in
addition to bovine specific genes, the so called orphan
genes [32]. These are coding sequences having no matches
with genes of other annotated species. The orphan genes
arose mainly from duplication events, and recent experimental evidence describes them as fast evolving genes
[33,34]. The second set contains genes that appear to be
absent from the bovine genome, while being present in
the other species. Alignments, ontology, manual curation
and publicly available information were exploited to classify and investigate groups of genes. Differences between
species and possible species-specific features or problems
in the assembly of genomes were investigated in order to
explain missing orthologs.

Results
In silico libraries set up
The full gene sets for cow, human, mouse and dog, were
downloaded from Ensembl release 50 to a local database,
and comprised 22,836, 36,396, 28,329 and 23,550 genes,
respectively. The data used here consisted of genes found
to be non-orthologous between cow and human which
were further filtered to constitute a core of mammalian
orthologs by adding to the comparison the gene sets of
mouse and dog, currently the most complete mammalian
genomes in terms of sequence information [35,36]. The
initial query in Ensembl 50 using the Biomart tool
returned 5,507 bovine genes with no orthologs in human
and 19,811 human genes with no orthologs in cow. The
high number of human non-orthologous genes is
explained by the larger number of annotated genes in the
human genome. Mouse and dog gene sets, as described in
the method section, were then added to the query which
retrieved 3,801 bovine genes with no orthologs in human,
mouse and dog, and 1,010 human genes with no
orthologs in cow but with orthologs in mouse and dog, as
represented in the Venn diagram in Figure 1. The two queries are slightly different in principle because the final cow
dataset will contain bovine orphan genes, while the
human dataset includes genes that can be considered core

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/604

mammalian orthologs, apparently missing in cow. These
two resulting in silico data libraries were the subjects for a
two-way comparison based on the alignment of the genes
from a library of one species to the whole genome
sequence of the other species; i.e. bovine genes were
aligned to the human genome ("cow vs. human comparison") and human genes to the bovine genome ("human
vs. cow comparison").
Sequence alignments to genomes
The longest transcript (canonical transcript) for each nonorthologous gene from the starting libraries was aligned
to the genome of the other species, and then the canonical
transcripts grouped in six distinct categories; four containing the genes that could be aligned to the genome and two
containing the unaligned genes or those aligning with
unassembled contigs. The categories with aligned genes
are illustrated schematically in Figure 2. The "potential
ortholog" category (Figure 2a) included all the sequences
that fully or partially overlapped exons of known genes on
the genome, and which might represent orthologs missed
by the Ensembl pipeline. The genes that could be aligned
to intergenic regions of the genome were included in the
"new gene" category (Figure 2b) and might be considered
a source for putative new species-specific genes identified
in the genome. The "gene variant" category (Figure 2c)
included all the sequences that overlapped known exons
but also aligned to unannotated or intronic regions that
may indicate immature transcripts, transcript variants or
different gene structures. Finally, genes that were completely aligned within one or more introns of a known
gene were classified as "intronic" (Figure 2d) and probably constitute nested genes. All the genes not producing a
significant alignment with the genome or aligned to
unassembled contigs, where the annotation was not available, were classified respectively as "not aligned" and
"contig".

The 3,801 bovine genes obtained from the "cow vs.
human" comparison, were aligned to the human genome:
3,390 (89%) were mapped with a variable degrees of
identity, while 411 (11%) sequences had no hit on the
human genome. The statistical box plots in Figure 3a
show that the median percentage identity of the best hits
was about 80%, while the lowest value was around 53%,
with an E-value lower than 5e-46, indicating highly significant alignments. Table 1 (column "cow vs. human")
shows that 2,533 sequences (67%) were identified that
overlapped known genes on the human genome, 472
(12%) fell into the class "new gene" and 289 (8%) were
classified as "gene variant".
The same procedure was carried out for the "human vs.
cow" comparison; 967 (96%) human sequences out of
1,010 were mapped to the bovine genome. While 43 (4%)

had no hit at all, the statistical box plots in Figure 3b show
that the median percentage of identity for the best hit of
the mapped sequences on the genome is about 77% and
does not fall below 55%, while the E-value is always
below 2.6e-54. The aligned sequences were divided into
the six categories described above (Table 1, column
"human vs. cow"); 120 sequences could be aligned to
known bovine genes ("potential ortholog" category). A
considerable number of sequences fell into "new gene"
and "gene variant" groups (500 and 294, respectively).
Analysis of alignments
All the bovine and human genes were classified by Gene
Ontology (GO) terms and the GO tree was displayed with
the web tool described in the gene ontology analysis section of the methods (Figure 4, [37]). The tree for the three
main roots (molecular function, biological process and
cellular component) was built for the whole set of
sequences and for each of the five categories in which the
sequences were classified according to the alignment
results. Using this web tool the user can navigate through
the tree and for each level can retrieve all the sequences
described by a specific GO term. In addition, the tool has
a direct link to the Ensembl gene viewer and, for bovine
sequences, a link to the BLAST best protein hit at NCBI.

In cow, few GO terms were available for the bovine gene
set and, even though a similarity search approach was

used to provide new terms, about 36% (1,382) of the
sequences, mainly from the "potential ortholog" (918)
and "new gene" (310) libraries, could not be included in
the tree. The majority of the sequences in the molecular
function root were described as proteins with binding
properties for other proteins, ions and nucleic acids.
Other consistent classes contained genes involved in "catalytic activities" such as hydrolases, transferases and oxidoreductases or signal transducers.
A GO term could not be retrieved for about 10% (96) of
human genes, mainly (67) coming from the "new gene"
library. The distribution of the sequences in the human
trees resembled those observed in cow with minor differences.
The biotype classification in Ensembl described all the
1,010 human genes as protein coding genes. However,
among the 3,801 genes constituting the bovine libraries, a
large number (1,114) was represented by different species
of RNA (miRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA), while those
remaining were annotated as protein coding (2,001),
pseudogene (559) and retrotransposed genes (127).
About 86% (1,728) of the protein coding genes could be
aligned to the human genome.
As expected by the different level of annotation between
the two species, 66% of the bovine protein coding genes

are classified as novel while from human only 3.5% of the
genes were novel (Table 2).
Manual curation
The accuracy of the classification generated by the pipeline was manually verified for all the categories, except
"contig", for which the annotation information of
genomic regions was not available. This process was performed using a web interface tool described in the alignments procedures section of the methods, where the data
on the alignments are reported and graphically displayed
(Figure 5, [38]). The web interface tool provides a direct
external link to the Ensembl website, to allow all the
information for a given gene to be easily accessed. Criteria
used to evaluate the significance of the alignments, and
therefore the correctness of the classification, were: the
conservation of gene structure between human and cow,
the parameters of alignments and the presence of genscan
predictions, ESTs, mRNAs and UniGene features, aligned
alongside with the query sequence. Only protein coding
genes aligned to the genome with overall identity equal or
greater than 75% were selected for the manual curation,
even though the sequences below this threshold had
highly significant E-values. The genes in the "not aligned"
category, which could not be selected using a threshold,
were all examined. The analyses and supporting evidence
for each library is presented in the following sections and
the results summarised in Table 3.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/604

In silico bovine Libraries
Potential Orthologs
This category had the largest number of genes with at least
75% of identity, almost 79% of the total, and contains
883 sequences aligned to exons of known human genes.
Those with at least 90% identity (177) were systematically
examined, however, additional random checks were performed on the whole library. In most of the cases (80%),
bovine sequences were found to be shorter than the corresponding human genes, with bovine transcripts clearly
missing one or more exons at the gene boundaries. In
addition, for some short cow genes the alignments
showed a relationship with nearby genes, suggesting that
they might be wrongly annotated as distinct genes, while
in fact they represent a single gene. Short genes were also
represented by terminal exons of misassembled genes
which also showed matches elsewhere in the genome.
Many of these short genes have been removed in recent
releases of Ensembl (51 and 52 in particular). The comparison between cow and human genomes through these
alignments, showed that many cow genes had additional
evidence aligned alongside the corresponding gene
region(s), such as ESTs, mRNAs and genscans to support
the presence of additional exons, which had not been
annotated, in the proximity of the bovine genes. In a few
cases (10%), bovine sequences could be aligned with
human pseudogenes or retrotransposed genes. Potentially, real orthologs were identified only for short
sequences and other particular situations, such as genes
located at the ends of contigs or on unassigned chromosomes that appeared truncated or with wrongly assembled
structure. Artefacts (i.e. non informative alignments due
to the high percentage of identity but very low coverage of
the sequence) and nested genes constituted a minority of
this class.
Gene Variants
The total number of sequences examined in this class was
154, and for 67% substantial differences in gene length
and structure were observed between cow and human
genes. These sequences probably represent species-specific differences in gene architecture. In 13% of the
sequences the presence of additional exons is suggested in
the structure of the human gene, which was confirmed by
the quality of the alignments and the presence of genscan
predictions. The remaining 20% of the results showed
unreliable alignments and are likely to be alignment artefacts resulting from short sequences or short stretched of
high homology in otherwise divergent sequence.
New Genes
The bovine sequences aligned in intergenic regions of the
human genome were classified as possible new human
genes; of these 112 sequences were examined in detail.
Results for 57% of these annotated genes showed an over-

lap with genscan predictions and EST features that aligned
with the same regions of the human genome. Many of
these features showed good correspondence with the
structure of the bovine gene to which they aligned. The
results showed that 41% of the genes aligned with empty
regions of the genome where no other annotated features,
such as ESTs or genscans, were present. The remaining 2%
of the sequences were re-classified as potential orthologs
as they were annotated as genes in later releases of
Ensembl (51 and 52). In particular new human genes
were annotated in these later releases at the same position
where the pipeline described in this paper had placed the
corresponding bovine gene.

Intronic
Sixteen cow sequences aligned completely within introns
of annotated human genes. Of these sequences, 81%
showed an overlap with existing genscan or ESTs features
aligned in the same region of the human genome. Overall
19% of the results showed unreliable alignments.
Not Aligned
Among the bovine sequences that did not align to the
human genome, 273 were protein coding, most (79%)
were annotated as "novel genes" by Ensembl (Table 2).
When aligned with BLASTX against the protein nonredundant database at NCBI, 11% had a hit with human

sequences, while the remaining 37% had no match at all.
The problem of finding a significant match within this
library is partly due to 25% of the sequences being less
than 100 nucleotides in length, and therefore most are
likely to be artefacts, short open reading frames or fragments of sequences, indeed 33% of them were located on
unassigned chromosomes. Ensembl reported no evidence
(genscan models, ESTs, UniGene features) for 52% of
these sequences while significant evidence was available
only for 12%. The remaining sequences had only partial
and unreliable evidence. Some of the sequences showing
a good gene structure, but that originally had no match
with the protein database, have had protein evidence
added in a more recent Ensembl release (version 53).
Within this last group only one gene is described as
"known", with good supporting evidence and is annotated as "Stella Fragment" (Developmental pluripotencyassociated protein 3, DPPA3; ENSBTAG00000038326).

The same gene is present in human and mouse but is not
classified as orthologous in cow. Even though the annotated bovine gene appears to be a fragment, the sequence
diverges significantly from the sequence of the other species.
In silico human libraries
Potential Orthologs
- Human genes aligned to the bovine genome, and having
an overlap only with known exons of annotated genes,
were classified as "potential orthologs". In total 65 genes
were examined and fell into four different classification
groups. Despite the good overlap with annotated bovine
exons, 50% of these sequences were either shorter or
longer than the corresponding bovine gene, i.e. had either
different number of exons or exons with different length.
These genes were most likely not annotated as orthologs
because, in the current sequence assemblies, they have
species-specific features. In the second case, 24% of the
sequences overlapped two different bovine genes located
in the same chromosomal region, or novel bovine genes

with a single exon. The presence of bovine genscan predictions and other EST features in the same region suggested
annotation or sequence assembly problems with the
bovine genome in that particular position. Of the
sequences missed by the Ensembl automated annotation
pipeline, 20% could be considered as orthologs as they
have a good structure and sequence overlap with bovine
genes. The remaining 6% of the sequences showed a nonreliable alignment (artefacts) or aligned to pseudogenes.
Gene Variants
Human genes aligned to bovine genome and having an
overlap both with exons and introns or upstream/downstream regions of known bovine genes, were classified as
"gene variants". Several different examples were identified
within the 180 genes examined. The alignment of human
gene sequences with the presence of genscan predictions or
ESTs features together with the quality of the match, confirmed 80% of the sequences as potential "gene variants".
For 14% of the sequences, problems with the annotation
were observed, e.g. where a human gene matched with

Web interface to display the results of alignments of the bovine and human libraries. Records can be retrieved by
Ensembl ID, percentage of identity of the alignment, classification and gene name, through the search panel. For each record,
representing a sequence, the Ensembl ID, the sequence name, the chromosome of the alignment, the percentage of identity,
the E-value of the alignment and the classification flag were available. Moreover a link takes the user to the corresponding
region of the alignment in the Ensembl contig view and the "detail" button expands a detail panel. In this panel the selected
alignment is represented graphically in order to show the coverage and percentage of identity of the sequence but also the
position of the alignment to the genome scaffold, alongside with genscan predictions and known gene sequences, retrieved
directly from Ensembl database.

two different bovine genes in the same region; these are
probably bovine genes placed on misassembled regions of
the genome sequence, or that had been incorrectly annotated as two distinct genes. The remaining 6% of the
results were considered unreliable alignments (i.e. short
alignments or sequencing artefacts).
New Genes
Human sequences aligned to intergenic regions, i.e. where
no genes had been identified, were classified as "new
genes". This category had 287 protein coding genes of
which 44% could be considered new bovine genes. These
findings were also supported by new information introduced in the latest releases of Ensembl (from 51 onward)
where, for the 26% of those sequences verified as potential "new gene" by the manual curation, a new Ensembl
feature identified as "EST based gene" was found in the
same position corresponding as produced by our pipeline. For 19% of the "new genes" aligned to genomic
regions with supporting evidence such as genscan predictions, ESTs, or mRNAs, the evidence and overlap were
incomplete and therefore these sequences were classified
as "partial new genes". Similar situations were observed
where human genes overlapped two or more genscan predictions, or aligned within very large predicted genes,
which suggested problems in the annotation of specific
bovine genome regions. The remaining results contained
short sequences, fragments and artifacts that produced
unreliable alignments. In some cases, human genes
aligned with genscan exons that were spaced at large distances on the bovine scaffold, or had specific parts of the
gene matching with different regions of the genome. A
particular example of this situation was found for olfactory receptors, which are recurrent motifs in the dataset of
sequences. These probably represent domains or repeated
gene structures showing high similarity with sequences at
many different chromosomal regions.
Intronic
This category includes all the human sequences aligned
completely within introns of known bovine genes. A total
of 19 sequences were examined and 57%, were considered possible new nested genes. The remaining 42% of the
results represented artefacts or short aligned sequences
(less than 100-150 nucleotides in length).
Not Aligned
Overall 43 human sequences had no match with the
bovine genome. Forty sequences were known genes and
three were novel genes (Table 2). These sequences were
translated in all six reading frames and BLASTed against
the protein non-redundant database: for 35 a match was
found with a bovine sequence and in the 29% of the cases
the annotation and description corresponded to that for
the human gene.

Discussion
Over the last decade, many different approaches for identifying gene orthology between species have been proposed in the literature. The process of gene annotation, as
well as the discrimination between protein coding and
non coding genes [39], will become even more important
as the number of available genome sequences increases,
in line with the rapid progress of the sequencing technology. Depending on the sensitivity and specificity of methods used to identify orthologous genes, the fraction of
genes without orthologs between species is variable, and
also depends on the quality of the genome assembly
[40,41]. Among these genes, there are the so called
orphans [32], which have no homologs among the genes
of other species. Even though several explanations have
been proposed for the absence of homologs, one of the
possibilities is that they might represent species specific
genes. In the literature, the search for orphans genes has
been carried out in different species by comparing gene
sets at protein level [34,42,43]. In the work presented here
we faced the problem of non-orthologous genes between
species at nucleotide level. We focused on the bovine
genome (version 4.0), whose assembly and annotation is
still ongoing. Ensembl orthology predictions from release
50 were used, as these represented the highest quality
genome annotations across several mammalian species.
Ensembl automatically produces orthology predictions
between species and for each release of the database these
predictions can be easily queried using the "BioMart"
tool. A simple query to obtain the number of non-orthologous genes between the bovine and the human genome
returned 5,507 out of 22,836 genes. The reverse query
returned 19,811 out of 36,396 human genes with no
orthologs in the bovine genome. The differences are
dependent on the level and quality of annotation for the
two genomes, and on the larger set of annotated human
genes. In order to reduce this effect in a simple two-way
comparison, the bovine and human datasets were filtered
with information coming from other completed
genomes, specifically mouse and dog. A total of 3,801
bovine genes had no orthologs with these three species
while 1,010 human genes, with orthologs in mouse and
dog, had no orthologs in cow (Figure 1). These two groups
of genes were considered as the most consistent nonorthologous genes to use in further work. In the previous
assembly of the cow genome (Btau 3.1, Ensembl release
49), a similar query gave almost double the number of
bovine non-orthologous genes (6,247), while nonorthologous human genes were slightly fewer (865). This
reflects major improvements in the bovine genome
assembly and annotation between version 3.1 and 4.0,
but suggests that there are still problems either with the
assembly or the annotation of the bovine sequence.
The two sets of non-orthologous genes (cow vs. human
and human vs. cow) were investigated in order to test the

quality of orthology predictions, to reveal genuine differences between species and most commonly show problems with the genome assemblies. A bioinformatic
pipeline and web tool were developed to describe the
alignments of each library with the genome of the other
species, and the alignments were classified into 5 different
categories, according to the annotation associated with
the sequence in each genome (Figure 2, Table 1). These
classes were established according to the different scenarios that might explain annotation problems, which were:
potential orthologs, gene variants, new genes, intronic
genes and not-aligned sequences. For this analysis only
the protein coding genes were selected, which most likely
represent functional genes, while pseudogenes and retrotransposed genes were removed as the non-coding RNAs,
which were analysed separately [44].
Although all the aligned sequences showed highly significant E-values, only results with more than 75% of overall
identity were targeted for a detailed manual curation. A
web based informatic tool was created and used that provides easy access to the alignments and available annotation for each gene.
Among the genes examined, 90% of the sequences had a
significant match, even though for a small fraction the
alignments were not reliable. These included very short
sequences and genes which had short alignments or that
aligned with two different genes within the same genomic
region, and were considered sequence or alignment artefacts. These "problematic" sequences were distributed
throughout the genome and did not suggest the presence
of localised regions with problems with the genome
assembly or annotation (data not shown).
The current level of annotation of the bovine genome is
not comparable with that of human, however the alignment of the annotated bovine genes with the human
genome produced some interesting results. In some cases
there was evidence to suggest new, presently unannotated,
features in the human genome, including additional
exons, as observed in the "gene variant" class, or potential
new human genes, from the "new gene" and "intronic"
classes. The latter were supported by the presence of other
evidence in the region of the alignments, such as the coincident alignment of EST and genscan predictions. Indeed,
some of the features identified appeared in later releases
of Ensembl database, where additional human genes have
been annotated exactly where the pipeline used here had
aligned a bovine gene. This observation supports the
value of this type of comparative approach. The "potential
ortholog" class helped to identify additional orthology
relationships, however, it also identified deficiencies in
the genome sequence and errors in the annotation of
many bovine genes. Generally, the annotation suggested

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/604

that cow genes were shorter than the human orthologous
genes, which in many cases was because exons had been
missed at gene boundaries. Alignment of EST and genscan
predictions, in the corresponding positions of the bovine
genome, suggested the presence of new bovine exons. In
addition many genes were identified in the bovine
genome that had not been annotated.
It would be expected that genes with orthologs in human,
mouse and dog should have homology relationships in
cow, even though they had not been identified by the
automated orthology prediction. Thus, the alignment of
the human genes to the bovine genome should find new
features to improve genome annotation in cow. From the
results in the "new gene" class, 46% could be considered
as new bovine genes, indeed in latest Ensembl releases
half of those identified using the approach described here
were added in a new Ensembl feature called "EST based
genes", which were in agreement with our alignments.
The interpretation of the results for genes in the "potential
ortholog", "gene variant" and "intronic" classes, becomes
more complex as it is not completely clear if the observed
alignments and differences are due to species-specific features, or problems with the bovine annotation or the
genome assembly. From the genes belonging to "potential
orthologs", 20% may be considered as true orthologs
which were missed by the Ensembl prediction pipeline,
for the most part due to minor differences between the
sequences. Accepting the current annotation of the bovine
genome, 80% of the results in the "gene variant" class
were highlighted the presence of new exons for genes currently annotated in cow.
The "not aligned" class may contain real non-orthologs
between the four species but also orphan genes with no
match with other species. This class was analysed for both
cow and human genomes, by searching similarities with
the complete non-redundant protein database from
NCBI. For most of the human sequences, a match was
identified with bovine proteins whose annotation and
description is exactly the same as in human. These results
most probably represent gene sequences that are still not
annotated or assembled into the bovine genome, and
hence were completely missed by the Ensembl orthology
prediction. Some of the cow genes for which there is no
match with the human genome may be indeed novel,
bovine orphan genes, as only 11% in this class had a significant match with a human sequence and 37% had no
match at all in the NCBI database. Among these genes
there are novel sequences which also have supporting protein evidence; these are interesting candidates among
which to look for cow specific coding regions. The functions of orphan genes are generally poorly characterized
[43], they show distinctive features such as high tissue
specificity, rapid evolution and short peptide size [34].

Recent works have demonstrated that they evolve three to
four times faster than the average genes in Drosophila
[43] and in primates [34]. In some cases the sequence
divergence between species may be so great that the
orthology between the genes is not obvious. This situation
is represented by the "Stella fragment" related gene
(DPPE3), which is annotated and has good supporting
evidence. Indeed this gene has human and mouse counterparts but with the sequences highly divergent between
the species.
The discrimination between orthologs and paralogs still
remains difficult, especially when comparing incomplete
and large genomes, as addressed by Fulton et al. [45].
Genes predicted as paralogs by Ensembl are 49% and 60%
of the bovine and human libraries, respectively. Paralogs,
which mainly arise from a duplication event and may
undergo structural rearrangements during evolution [1],
are found in the non-orthologous sets described herein.
Their sequence divergence might explain why they were
missed as orthologs between species and in some cases
can be traced back with the similarity approach used in
this work.
Ontology descriptions, even if not complete for the
bovine gene set, due to the lower level of annotation, were
interesting in describing the groups of genes created in
this work. Many of the genes with no apparent orthologs
were clustered as proteins with binding properties. The
typical modular composition of such proteins and their
specificity for different ligands could explain structural
differences which might have an effect on the orthology
prediction. Despite the annotation and similarity search
performed to retrieve GO terms for the bovine non orthologous genes, no valid annotation was found for the 75%
of the cow genes in the "not aligned" group. This highlights the need to focus on this particular group of genes
that might reveal orphan as well as species specific coding
sequences.

larity and classification methods, is crucial for the analysis
of genome sequences and gene sets, especially when the
annotation process relies on the quantity and quality of
available data on transcript sequences for a particular species. In this context, this kind of comparative approach
could be used to extend the current genome annotation
protocols. The presence of non-orthologous genes in
other species should be considered as a central resource to
derive important information for the definition of gene
models and structures, in particular for the newly assembled genomes, where the lack of a complete set of genes
and poor transcript sequences information may restrict
the commonly applied annotation procedures.

Methods
Datasets
The cow genome assembly version 4.0 and the human
genome assembly version 36 were downloaded from
Ensembl release 50 [46]. Gene sets were retrieved directly
from Ensembl database using the multi-species comparison options in the BioMart web interface [47]. In detail,
the bovine library of non-orthologous genes was obtained
by retrieving three sets of Gene IDs obtained after applying a filter to exclude the orthologous genes of human,
mouse and dog, respectively 5,507, 5,273 and 5,842
genes. Only the genes in common among these three sets
(3,801) were retained (Figure 1a). The second library is
referred as "human"; this refers to the human subset of
genes that are found in common between human, mouse
and dog genomes and represent core mammalian
orthologs. Two lists of human genes were built; the first
contained orthologs between human and mouse datasets
filtered to exclude the orthologous genes of cow and the
second by the orthologs between human and dog datasets, filtered to exclude the orthologous genes of cow.
Only human Gene IDs in common between these two
lists (respectively 2,104 and 1,437 genes) were retained
for a total of 1,010 genes (Figure 1b). All the possible
orthology predictions (1:1, many:1, 1:many, many:many)
as provided by Ensembl were used.

Conclusions
This study was focused on a particular class of genes predicted to be non-orthologous between cow and human
genomes. These genes are normally considered the result
of divergent evolution and are reported by the automated
pipelines and following the manual annotations of the
bovine and dog genome in the international sequencing
projects [31,36]. Evidence found within this work suggest
that a high number of non-orthologous genes between
cow and human could be considered a side effect of an
incomplete genome assembly and annotation process.
The approach described here allowed the differences and
similarities for this class of genes to be highlighted and
also possible new features for the human genome to be
identified. The comparison between species, using simi-

The protein and nucleotide non-redundant databases
were downloaded from NCBI on January 2009 [48].
Statistical plots
Statistical box plots and distributions were drawn using R
v2.7.0 [49]. In this analysis, the best hit with the lowest Evalue for each sequence was considered.
Alignment procedure
All the alignments were done using WU-BLAST v2.0 [50],
with identity matrix for nucleotide alignments and
BLOSUM62 identity matrix for protein alignments. The
longest transcript (canonical transcript) for each gene was
aligned to the whole genome sequence using the parame-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:604

ters W = 10, E = 1e-5, links, topcomboN = 1 and hspsepSmax = 1,000,000. The best hit with the lowest E-value was
considered as the result for each alignment. Custom Perl
scripts were written to run the alignments, parse the
results using BioPerl v1.5.2 libraries [51] and store the
information into a relational MySQL v5.0 database [52].
The results were classified according to the genomic position and to the current annotation available for each species, using the Ensembl Perl API to query the Ensembl
database and retrieve all the genomic information
[27,53]. A web interface was created to query the database
of results and display the aligned sequences and the corresponding genomic regions, with other annotated genes
and the genscan [54] predictions available. This interface
was written using the Ruby language and was based on the
Ruby on Rails framework [55]. The interface was used to
perform the manual annotation and visual inspection of
the results, providing the possibility to query the database
of results directly using different parameters, such as
alignment identities, gene IDs and classification labels.
Direct access to the Ensembl information for each gene
was added to help the retrieval of all the necessary information during the manual annotation phase. The interface is available at http://www.itb.cnr.it/idralab/
non_orthologs.
Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis
We obtained Human GO annotations via the Biomart
searching tool from Ensembl release 52 [46,47]. The Gene
Ontology Database (January, 2009)[56,57] was used to
extend this preliminary GO data set with all the "is-a"
related GO terms (e.g. GO:0004601 - peroxidase activity "is a" GO:00016209 - antioxidant activity), up to the three
main roots (molecular function, cellular component and
biological process) in the Gene Ontology hierarchy.

a bar proportionally long as the number of the related
sequences (Figure 4). The visualisation tool is available at

Bovine GO annotations derive from the EBI Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database (January, 2009) [58,59],
without distinguishing between the available evidence
codes. In details, sequences were blasted (BLASTX, e-value
threshold of 1e-10) against a modified version of the UniprotKB database (January, 2009)[60,61] containing only
GOA annotated proteins, and were linked to GO annotations in accordance with the GOA database. As in the case
of human sequences, "is-a" related GO terms were added,
according to the GO DAG available data.
Perl scripts were designed to produce library-specific statistics on the sequence distribution among the GO terms,
and to save the data into a relational MySQL v 5.0 database [52].
A software tool written in PHP language was developed in
order to display the sequence-GO distribution. This visualization tool dynamically creates a navigable, tree-like
