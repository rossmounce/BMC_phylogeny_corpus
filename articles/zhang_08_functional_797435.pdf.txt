Abstract
Maelstrom (MAEL) plays a crucial role in a recently-discovered piRNA pathway; however its
specific function remains unknown. Here a novel MAEL-specific domain characterized by a set of
conserved residues (Glu-His-His-Cys-His-Cys, EHHCHC) was identified in a broad range of
species including vertebrates, sea squirts, insects, nematodes, and protists. It exhibits ancient
lineage-specific expansions in several species, however, appears to be lost in all examined teleost
fish species. Functional involvement of MAEL domains in DNA- and RNA-related processes was
further revealed by its association with HMG, SR-25-like and HDAC_interact domains. A distant
similarity to the DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonuclease family with the RNase H fold was discovered based on
the evidence that all MAEL domains adopt the canonical RNase H fold; and several protist MAEL
domains contain the conserved 3'–5' exonuclease active site residues (Asp-Glu-Asp-His-Asp,
DEDHD). This evolutionary link together with structural examinations leads to a hypothesis that
MAEL domains may have a potential nuclease activity or RNA-binding ability that may be implicated
in piRNA biogenesis. The observed transition of two sets of characteristic residues between the
ancestral DnaQ-H and the descendent MAEL domains may suggest a new mode for protein
function evolution called "active site switch", in which the protist MAEL homologues are the likely
evolutionary intermediates due to harboring the specific characteristics of both 3'–5' exonuclease
and MAEL domains.

Background
Germline cells among different species are characterized
by the presence of a morphologically unique organelle
called the germ plasm (also referred to as nuage, polar
granules or mitochondrial cloud) [1,2]. This organelle has
been considered the determinant of germline development. Very recently a germ plasm-specific small RNA
pathway has been identified, in which a new type of small
RNAs called PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) or repeatassociated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) play a role
in ensuring the genomic stability of germline cells by
silencing certain endogenous genetic elements such as retrotransposons and repetitive sequences [3-8]. Different
from short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs
which are usually 21–22 nt long, piRNAs or rasiRNAs
have longer nucleotide composition (26–31 nt) and 2'Omethyl modification in 3' end. Many germ plasm proteins
are functionally important in piRNAs synthesis and function, including PIWI proteins (PIWI, Aubergine and
AGO3) [4,9,10], VASA [11], MAEL [11], SPN-E [12,13],
Oskar [14], Tudor domain proteins [15], Armitage [13],
Krimper [11], Cutoff [16], Dead end [17] and Zucchini
and Squash [18]. Their loss-of-function mutations commonly cause a huge reduction in the amount of piRNAs or
rasiRNAs and an increase in transcript level of transposable elements in the germline cells [11,19,20] as well as the
spindle-class gene phenotypes: failure in establishing
anterior/posterior polarity in early oocytes, disrupted
asymmetric subcellular mRNA localization of Oskar,
Gurken and Biocoid, ectopic expression of Oskar and
Gurken, failure to proceed to the karyosome stage
[8,11,13,21].
The molecular functions of most germ plasm proteins in
the piRNA pathway have been assigned based on domain
examination, biochemical and genetic characterizations.
For instance, PIWI proteins contain the PAZ and PIWI
domains, which contribute to recognition of singlestranded RNA [22] and sequence-specific endonucleolytic
cleavage of target nucleotide [23,24], respectively. VASA,
SPN-E and Armitage share DEAD RNA helicase domains,
which provide helicase activities for piRNA production or
retrotransposon silencing [13,25]. Zucchini and Squash
are putative nucleases, which are believed to be involved
in piRNA maturation [18]. Other Dead end, Krimper and
Tudor proteins, contain RNA binding domains RRM [26]
or Tudor [27] which may facilitate the assembly of multiprotein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and targeting substrate RNA recognition during cleavage. In
contrast, although many studies including specific knockouts, protein interaction and cellular distribution experiments have been conducted, the definitive function of
MAEL in piRNA pathway remains unknown. MAEL was
initially identified in a genetic loss-of-function Drosophila
mutant, whose germline cells exhibit incorrect posterior

localizations of several transcripts (i.e., Gurken, Oskar and
Bicoid) [12]. It is a germ plasm-specific protein with all
spindle-class gene phenotypes [12,13,21,28] and directly
involved in the piRNA pathway [11,29]. The correct location of either SPN-E, VASA, Aubergine, Tudor or Krimper
in germ plasm determines the location of MAEL [11],
which in turn delineates the location of Dicer and
Argonaute2 [21]. MAEL can shuttle between germ plasm
and the nucleus [21]. Direct interaction between MAEL
and chromatin remodeling proteins SNF5/INI1 and
SIN3B during heterochromatin formation has also been
demonstrated [30]. Therefore, MAEL is the only known
protein connecting germ plasm and piRNA pathway to
chromatin remodeling, a process required for piRNA-initiated genome transposon silencing [31]. In the present
study, we were motivated to understand the putative function of MAEL using combined bioinformatic strategies
including extensive homologous sequence mining, phylogenetic analysis, domain architecture, protein fold recognition, and structure modeling.

Results
A conserved MAEL-specific domain and its unique lineagespecific evolutionary expansion and loss
Domain annotation showed that mouse MAEL protein
contains a HMG domain in its N-terminal segment, which
is a DNA-binding module in many non-histone components and transcriptional regulators [32]. However, no
domain information could be assigned for the C-terminal
segments of MAEL proteins (240 amino acids long). We
conducted homologous sequence searching for this
region using PSI-BLAST against the NCBI NR database.
Many unique homologues were identified in a broad
range of species from veterbrates, echinoderms, insects,
nematodes, to the protists (Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba dispar, and Trypanosoma brucei). We also examined
NCBI nucleotide and Ensembl genome databases and
identified eight other homologues in insects and urochordates (Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi). Three more
protist homologues were obtained through searching
GeneDB database. A multiple sequence alignment was
built for all the retrieved sequences (additional file 1) and
a condensed one is shown in Figure 1. Although the overall sequence identity is very low, the conservation is
apparent across all these MAEL homologues. Six residues
Glu-His-His-Cys-His-Cys (EHHCHC) are highly conserved, suggesting that they may contribute to MAEL-specific activity. Thus the C-terminal segment appears to
define a novel MAEL-specific domain that we now refer to
as the MAEL domain.

For the majority of species, only one copy of MAEL
domain exists. However, there are multiple MAEL homologues in several other species; for instance, two copies are
found in sea squirts (C. intestinalis and C. savignyi) and

mosquito (A. aegypti), three copies in Culex pipiens, and
five copies each in amoeba E. dispar and E. histolytica. Phylogenetic tree construction suggests that multiple MAEL
copies are generated from a series of ancient lineage-specific duplication events (Figure 2A). Strikingly, no fish
MAEL homologues could be identified. Its absence in teleost fish was confirmed by carefully examining the published whole genome databases in Ensembl for five

different species (Danio rerio, Gasterosteus aculeatus,
Oryzias latipes, Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis).
It can be inferred that it is the ancestor of the fish lineage
after the divergence of teleost and tetrapod lineages that
underwent the loss of MAEL domain. The timing of the
loss is probably related to the ancient fish-specific genome
duplication [33].

Phylogenetic relationship and domain architectures of MAEL proteins
Phylogenetic relationship and domain architectures of MAEL proteins. (A) An unrooted phylogenetic tree was
reconstructed using maximum likelihood (ML) analysis and Bayesian analysis. Single MAEL domains are represented by species
names. The duplicated ones in the species of Aa, Ci, Cp, Ed, Eh are represented by species names following Genbank ID,
whereas Cs domains are represented by Cs1 and Cs2. Branch length is proportional to estimated evolutionary change by
PhyML program; the scale bar represents 0.5 substitution per site. Node supporting values greater than 75% from ML bootstrap analyses and Bayesian MCMCMC sampling are shown on the left and on the right of the slash, respectively. Lineage-specific expansions of MAEL domains in amoeba, mosquito and sea squirt are highlighted with different colors (red, turquoise blue
and pink) and ancient duplication events were indicated by circled numbers. The loss of MAEL in teleost fish is indicated in blue
dashed. Asterisk labeled MAEL domains are the ones containing both conserved EHHCHC and EDDHD residues (see following main text). (B) Domain architectures of representatives of the MAEL proteins were deduced through searching against
Pfam and SMART domain databases and drawn approximately to scale. The domains shown are: HDAC_interact, named after
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) interacting (SMART: SM00761); HMG, named after High Mobility Group (SMART: SM00398); SR25-like (DUF1777, Pfam: PF08648). New species name abbreviations: Bm, Brugia malayi; Bt, Bos taurus; Cf, Canis familiaris; Cp,

Functional insight from domain architectures
Three other domains are associated with MAEL domains,
including HMG (SMART: SM00398), HDAC_interact
(SMART: SM00761), and SR-25-like domain (DUF1777,
Pfam: PF08648) (Figure 2B). HMG is a common DNA-

binding module in a variety of chromatin-associated proteins and functionally involved in the nucleoprotein complex assembly during genome recombination, initiation
of transcription, and DNA repair [32]. The association
between MAEL and HMG domains in most species sug-

gests that the MAEL domain may somehow function in a
DNA-related process. This functional assignment is also
suggested by the association of MAEL domain with
HDAC_interact domain in two homologues from mosquitoes (A. aegypti and A. gambiae). The HDAC_interact
domain is known to bind to histone deacetylases
(HDACs), core enzymes for removing acetyl group from
lysine residue of histones during chromatin remodeling
process [34]. It has been observed that pairs of interacting
domains in one organism may have a fusion homologue
composing of these two domains in another organism,
known as the rosetta stone protein theory [35]. Mosquito
MAELs may be rosetta stone proteins and it can be
hypothesized that there are interactions between other
MAEL and some HDAC_interact-containing proteins in
other species. Indeed, it has been illustrated that mouse
MAEL can interact with the SIN3B protein which contains
an HDAC_interact domain [30]. The associated SR-25like domain provides another link between the MAEL
domain and RNA-related process. The SR-25-like domain
is associated with RNA-binding modules, RNA recognition motif (RRM) [26] and PRP38 [36], It is also distantly
related to SR-25 domain which may be involved in RNA
splicing, as revealed by the SCOOP program [37]. Therefore, domain architecture suggests a potential involvement of MAEL domains in DNA binding, RNA binding
and chromatin remodeling.
A distant similarity between MAEL domains and the
DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonuclease family with the RNase H fold
We applied a fold recognition strategy to identify remotely
related homologues of MAEL domains. The rationale is
that in the case of remote homology, conserved protein
structural folds can be kept despite limited sequence identity [38]. A meta server was utilized, which assembles various state-of-the-art fold recognition methods and further
evaluates modeled structures based on a consensus score
computed by a 3D-JURY system [39]. MAEL domains
from human, X. tropicalis, Ciona and Drosophila were first
used as queries and several structural hits were identified
by MetaBasic, ORFeus and BasicDist with consensus
scores from 21 to 46. Although these 3D-Jury scores are
below the cutoff 50, which corresponds to correct assignment with statistical significance [40], domain and fold
examinations showed that all retrieved structures belong
to the DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonuclease family with the RNase H
fold [41,42]. We extended our search using an ancestral E.
histolytica MAEL domain (GI: 67477376, residues 315–
532) as a query. Eleven structural hits were identified with
high scores around 58–69, and they all belong to the
DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonuclease family. Structural fold similarities between DnaQ-H and MAEL domains encouraged us
to re-examine this relationship using PSI-BLAST. We
noticed that several DnaQ-H exonucleases can be
retrieved as insignificant candidates in our initial PSI-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/48

BLAST searching with a profile inclusion expectation (E)
value of 0.005. However, when we set inclusion E value at
0.05, significant similarity between the first 100aa segment of MAEL domains and several prokaryotic DnaQ-H
exonucleases was achieved in the fourth iteration.
We next examined this homologous relationship by
building structure-based multiple sequence alignments
for MAEL domains and DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonucleases. Since
sequence identity among different DnaQ-H domains is
very low, their alignment was first generated based on
structural information as assessed by a CE-MC server [43]
followed by manual adjustment based on published literature. Thereafter, we combined this alignment with the
aligned MAEL domains based on fold recognition results
and predicted secondary structures. The final alignment
showed the conserved residues among/between two
domains and compositions of secondary structures (Figure 3A). It is to be noted (Figure 3A) that equivalents of
beta sheet (β) 3 of the RNase H fold in most MAEL
domains are predicted to be alpha helix (α). We believe
that this is a wrong prediction since in the canonical
RNase H fold, β3 is an edge β strand, which can usually be
misidentified as an α helix because of its solvent sequence
property [44]. As shown in Figure 3A, the secondary structures of MAEL domains resemble those of DnaQ-H 3'–5'
exonucleases; both have a β1- β2- β3- α1- α2- β4- α3- β5α4- α5- α6 composition. More importantly, several ancestral protist MAEL domains also share all the critical DnaQH
characteristic
residues
(Asp-Glu-Asp-His-Asp,
DEDHD). These residues are commonly utilized by
diverse DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonucleases and interact with two
divalent metal ions to form an active site [45-47]. Thus, in
contrast to a very low sequence identity (<15%) between
MAEL domains and DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonucleases, the similar structural fold and the notable existence of DEDHD
residues in protist MAEL domains strongly support a distant evolutionary relationship.
Structural examinations on active sites by DEDHD and
EHHCHC residues in MAEL domains
The tertiary structures of protist and chicken MAEL
domains were further constructed by comparative modeling. Like DnaQ-H domains (Figure 3B, C), these MAEL
domains adopt a similar RNase H structural fold which is
characterized by a compact α/β fold with open anti-parallel β sheets in the middle and several α helices surrounded
(Figure 3D, E). Moreover, the characteristic DEDHD residues in protist MAEL domains are clustered into a structural core, which resembles active sites of DnaQ-H
domains (Figure 3A, B, C). In contrast, most other MAEL
domains lack the DnaQ-H specific residues DEDHD.
However, they are characterized by another conserved
stretch of residues, EHHCHC. During evolution such conservation of MAEL-specific residues may reflect functional

contributions most likely to a distinct active site. The spatial locations of EHHCHC residues were then examined in
these modeled MAEL structures to check their possibility
of forming an active site. Unexpectedly, we found that all
MAEL-specific residues have very close spatial locations
and they are clustered together at one side of the middle
anti-parallel β sheets (Figure 3E). Four residues (EHHchC) can shape a structural core and other two residues
may also potentially face down to it with slight structural
rearrangements. Similar change of structural conformations of α5 and α6 comprising last CHC residues has been
observed in crystal structures of DnaQ-H domains (additional file 2). There may exist another possibility that a
disulfide bond (-S-S-) is formed between two Cys residues
(C178 and C189 in the chicken MAEL domain) because
of their close proximity. This is also supported by
disulfide bond predictions [48]. Formation of a disulfide
bond may facilitate the last His to approach other EHH
residues, thus forming an active site with EHHH residues.
Therefore, structural examinations suggest that protist
MAEL domains with DEDHD residues may form a DnaQH active site whereas other MAEL domains with EHHCHC
residues may potentially form a new active site based on
the canonical RNase H scaffold.

Discussions and conclusion
Functional insight into MAEL in germline piRNA pathway
The proposed evolutionary link of MAEL domains to
DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonuclease with RNase H fold may provide functional clues for MAEL domains. The DnaQ-H 3'–
5' exonuclease family, also known as DEDDh exonuclease
family or Exonuc_X-T domain (Pfam ID: PF00929), is one
member of RNase H fold superfamily (SCOP: 53098)
which also includes RNase H, mu transposase, crossover
junction resolvase RuvC, and PIWI domain families
[24,49-52]. They all share a canonical RNase H fold but
contain different active site residues. The DnaQ-H family
is characterized by five conserved residues, DEDHD,
which form an active site in coordination with divalent
metal ions (Figure 3A). Its members contribute to diverse
nucleic acid metabolism processes such as replicative
proofreading (1J53:A) [47], DNA repair or RNA degradation (exonuclease I and oligoribonuclease) [45,46], and
RNA interference (ERI-1) [53]. Although different nucleotide targets (DNA or RNA) or diverse metal ions (Zn2+,
Mg2+, or Mn2+) are involved [45-47], their active sites
formed by the EDDHD residues delineates a common 3'–
5' exonuclease activity. That is, the acidic DEDD together
with two metal ions shape a negative pocket, which provides space for accommodating the 3' termini of oligonucleotide (DNA or RNA) chains. Thereafter, the
coordinated metal ions and another conserved H are in
direct contact with the bound chain, which induces a
break of the phosphodiester bond of nucleotide in the 3'–
5' direction [46]. Therefore, protist MAEL domains, har-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/48

boring DnaQ-H specific DEDHD residues and active sites,
may also employ a 3'–5' exonuclease activity, although
their associated metal ions and nucleotide targets are still
unknown.
In contrast to the protist MAEL domains, most recent
MAEL domains do not contain the DnaQ-H specific residues but are characterized by the EHHCHC residues.
What is the functional contribution of these residues to
MAEL domains? Structural observations showed that a
structural core can be potentially formed by the MAELspecific residues EHHCHC or EHHH. This may provide a
structural basis for an active site. On the one hand, this
active site may confer RNA-binding ability for MAEL
domains because of the lack of DnaQ-H specific residues.
In this way, MAEL may contribute to stabilizing or positioning the RNA substrate in piRNA pathway. On the
other hand, MAEL-specific residues and its potential
active site may define another nuclease activity. We
noticed that although all related families with the RNase
H fold have low sequence identities and contain different
active site residues, they all have DNA/RNA 3' or 5' enddirected nuclease activities with metal ion coordination in
their own active sites [50,51]. For example, RNase H is a
non-specific endonuclease whose catalytic activity
requires divalent ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+) and is responsible
for the hydrolysis of the RNA in a DNA/RNA duplex
[52,54]. In contrast, PIWI domains contribute to 5'-3'
exonulcease catalytic activity for the Argonaute family
proteins (Slicer) in all types of small RNA pathways
(siRNA, miRNA, and piRNA). The activity is achieved by
three PIWI active site residues, DDH, in coordination with
one divalent ion and used to cleave single-stranded RNA
substrate guided by complementary double-stranded
small RNAs (piRNA or siRNA) [23,24,55-57]. It seems
that the RNase H structural fold is an efficient scaffold
from which diverse nuclease families have evolved distinct nuclease activities by developing their own active site
residues with metal ion coordination. Therefore, being
one member of RNase H superfamily, the MAEL domain
may share this characteristic, thus the residues EHHCHC
may form an active site with a new nuclease activity. It has
been shown in diverse proteins that H, C and E residues
often interact with Zn2+ [58]. Moreover, the residue composition of EHHH is commonly utilized by several
Escherichia coli proteins including ColE7 endonuclease
[59], Zinc transport protein ZnuA [60], and Aldolase
(1DOS) for their active sites, which also interact with
metal ions, especially Zn2+ [61],
Experimental evidence have suggested that MAEL may be
involved in piRNA biogenesis since its loss-of-function
mutant impairs the production of piRNAs or rasiRNAs
and increases the transcript level of transposable elements
[11]. Different from siRNA and miRNA pathways, piRNAs

biogenesis employs a Dicer-independent mechanism
[4,10]. A ping-pong model has been recently proposed for
this process and it is hypothesized that AGO3 bound to
the sense strand of piRNAs catalyzes cleavage of the antisense strand that generates 5' end of antisense piRNAs.
The 3' end of the resulting antisense piRNAs is subjected
to a 3' cleavage by an unknown endonuclease or exonuclease and a HEN1-processed 3' methylation. Thereafter,
the produced antisense piRNAs associate with Aubergine
or PIWI and direct cleavage of transposon sequences,
which then generates the sense strand piRNAs after 5'
cleavage, 3' cleavage and 3' methylation [5,7,8]. This
cycling model is not complete since the exonuclease or
endonuclease enzyme responsible for the 3' terminal maturation remains uncharacterized [5,7,8]. Thus, because of
its evolutionary relationship to 3'–5' DnaQ-H exonuclease and the potential (3'–5' exo-) nuclease activities,
MAEL may be the nuclease candidate implicated in the
cleavage of the 3' termini. Recently, the nucleases Zucchini and Squash have been proposed as the 3' termini
nuclease candidate based on the evidence that they are
also located in germ plasm and have a similar mutation
phenotype in a loss of transposon silencing [18]. However, MAEL is distinct from those above two nucleases due
to its translocation between germ plasm and nucleus and
the direct interaction with chromatin remodeling proteins
[21,30]. We believe that multiple nucleases are involved
in the diverse steps of piRNA pathway in a sequential
manner, similar to PIWI family members targeting 5'
cleavage of piRNAs [62]; and MAEL is involved in a
genomic DNA-related piRNA step, which may include
chromatin remodeling process and initial transcriptions
of transposon. In this way, MAEL-associated HMG
domain or other chromatin remodeling proteins facilitate
the access of piRNA complex to the genomic regions
where are enriched with transposon sequences. The transposon transcripts undergoing processing interact with the
piRNA complex in which PIWI, one RNase H member,
generates 5' end of transposon transcripts via a piRNAdirected homologous cleavage whereas MAEL, another
RNase H member, contributes to a 3' terminal cleavage of
transposon transcripts.

lost after duplication. However, it seems that this singlecopy status is commonly inherited by several domains
including SANTA domain [66]; an evolutionary selection
against domain duplication together with the functional
conservation, therefore, should account for the establishment of this status. We did observe MAEL domain expansion in several species. One or two duplication events
occur at the ancestor of each lineage before its further
divergence (Figure 2A). This ancient lineage-specific
expansion may be caused by the release of evolutionary
constraints in individual lineages. Thereafter, functional
complexity may have arisen, as exemplified by diverse
protist MAEL domains with either DEDHC+EHHCHC
residues or EHHCHC residues (Figure 2A and legend).

Unique evolutionary characteristics for MAEL domains
Phylogenetic analysis has revealed several unique characteristics of MAEL domains including single-copy status in
most species, ancient lineage-specific expansion and the
loss in the teleost fish lineage. It has been long recognized
that during evolution eukaryotic species have high duplication rates [63] and vertebrates have experienced two or
three whole or regional genome duplications [33,64,65],
which led to expansions of some domain families. It is of
great interest that MAEL domain has escaped the usual
duplication potential in most species, especially in vertebrates. It is also possible that the duplicated sequence was

Active site switch, a novel path towards protein function
change
How did MAEL domain evolve from the DnaQ-H
domain? Considering the oldest identified MAEL
domains are from Protista that represents the earliest
eukaryotic branches [68], we believe that the first generation of MAEL domains should be traced back to an ancestral eukaryotic or a prokaryotic DnaQ-H domain, from
which the MAEL-specific characteristics might have originated. Indeed, the first three MAEL-specific residues EHH
are more ancient than others and commonly found in different prokaryotic ε exonucleases (Figure 3A). Their spa-

We also observed the loss of MAEL domain in all examined teleost fish species. Gene loss in protein family evolution is well-recognized. The lost member may be
functionally replaced by another member of the same
family. However MAEL does not belong to this case
because of its single-copy nature especially in the vertebrates. What happens in teleost fish germline cells without the MAEL protein? One possibility is that fish have a
distinct but functionally similar counterpart, which
remains to be characterized. Another possibility is that
MAEL loss results in a unique piRNA pathway or a unique
developmental morphology in fish germline cells compared to mammals and flies. Indeed, a distinct cellular
distribution of Vasa protein, a marker for germline cells,
has been observed in fish [10]. Moreover, it seems that
although RNAi is evolutionarily conserved among species,
individual lineage tends to develop some unique steps for
the RNAi pathway, as shown in plant-specific XS domain
in post-transcriptional gene silencing [67] and worm-specific Argonaute subfamily [62]. Furthermore, although the
evolutionary and functional implications of MAEL loss in
the teleost lineage are not yet understood, a practical
implication can be hypothesized that fish may be amenable natural MAEL knockout-like models where transgenic
insertion of MAEL proteins could be used to as a strategy
for studying its function and the germline piRNA pathway.

tial locations are also close as shown in 1J53:A [47]
(additional file 3), thus providing a substrate for evolving
to a mature active site. It can be hypothesized that the
DnaQ-H ancestor underwent a gene duplication event
(additional file 4) in early Eukaryota or during the divergence of the prokaryotes and eukaryotes, corresponding
to the time when small RNA pathways emerged. Thereafter, the duplicated one (MAEL ancestor) obtained a protein motif comprising CHC residues, forming an
evolutionary intermediate which has both DEDHD and
EHHCHC residues. The original DnaQ-H activity was
attained by some ancestral protist MAEL domains. However, driven by relaxed evolutionary constraint associated
with functional specification, other MAEL domains generated by further lineage-specific duplications or species
speciation (duplication 2) may have lost the original
active site with DEDHD residues, but at the same time
developed a new active site with EHHCHC residues while
keeping RNase H structural scaffold (Figure 4). The diversity of characteristic residues among three Eh MAEL
domains
(Eh67476664,
Eh67477376-C,
and
Eh67477376-N) in an amoeba duplication branch (node
value 89%/100%) supports this evolutionary path (Figure
2A). Compared to two other paralogs (Eh67476664,
Eh67477376-C) which have both sets of DEDHD and
EHHCHC residues, the Eh67477376-N has lost the
DnaQ-H specific residues. Thus, MAEL domains have
experienced a transition from DnaQ-H active site residues
to MAEL active site residues which, we believe, may represent a novel mode for protein function evolution called
the active site switch.
It has been long recognized that although protein superfamilies tend to preserve their structure during evolution,
a divergent evolution with functional changes is permitted [38,69-71]. Protein function changes involve diversity
or variability in active sites, properties of related residues
or their spatial locations, as reviewed by Todd et al. [70].
Several possible mechanisms underlying protein function
changes have been proposed including evolutionary optimization via functional residue hopping, independent
recruitment of active sites in different lineages, circular
permutation, and functional convergence after divergence
[70]. Here, MAEL domains undergoing the active site
switch provide another mode for protein function change;
that is, during evolution new activities can be developed
by introducing new active sites based on a preexisting protein scaffold. This evolutionary mode has long been
hypothesized based on many in vitro directed evolution
studies [72-74]. It has been shown that new activity can be
introduced by simultaneous incorporation and adjustment of functional elements through insertion, deletion,
and substitution of several active site loops, followed by
point mutations to fine-tune the activity [73]. A similar
process may have occurred in MAEL domain evolution. In
addition, the ancestral protist MAEL domains which har-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/48

bor the characteristics of both DnaQ-H and MAEL
domains, for the first time, illustrate the existence of an
evolutionary intermediate during protein function evolution. The identification of such an evolutionary intermediate may facilitate establishing real evolutionary links
between protein superfamily members with different catalytic activities, or protein superfamilies which have overall similar structural folds but different functions.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1: L Aravind, National Center for
Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA
Zhang et al show that the globular domain found C-terminal to the HMG domain in Maelstrom is a member of the
3'–>5' exonuclease superfamily of the RNase H fold. This
finding leads to a key functional prediction that might help
in understanding the role of this major regulator of gene
expression which lies at the interface between the RNAdependent process and chromatin dynamics. The basic
relationship proposed here is sound; however, the authors
note that the active site of this domain might have drastically been reconfigured in subset of the family with the utilization of an entirely new constellation of residues. This is
a rather bold proposal based on homology modeling and
the observed conservation. However, it is weakened by the
fact that, as observed correctly by the authors, the canonical
active site is preserved outside of the animal radiation along
with the maelstrom family specific residues preserved in
animals. This makes the claim suspect as it would imply
that both active sites were simultaneously present in the
ancestor. Hence, I strongly recommend that the authors
completely rework this section and concede the strong possibility of the absence of nuclease activity in the forms lacking the canonical active site. It is quite possible that at least
in animals it is an inactive RNA-binding protein.
Authors' response
Thank you for the invaluable comments. We have revised the

present structural evidence and give discussion based on other
evolutionary and functional information. We agree with the
reviewer on the question of whether both active sites (DnaQ-H
and MAEL-specific activities) can be realized in the same protist MAEL domain. We believe they could since their conservation likely reflects functional contribution; otherwise the
conservation of these residues should have been lost during evolution. It seems that because of the structural conformation constraints, the same protist MAEL domain cannot form two active
sites at the same time; instead, it may adopt different conformations for each of the different activities.
Further, there are several points in the paper that need to
be addressed for it to be suitable for publication.
-Nomenclatural: Currently the authors use the term
DNAQ-H for the superfamily. This is confusing as one
could imagine that these indeed arose from DNAQ itself.
Instead they should use the terminology "3'–>5' exonuclease superfamily in the RNAse H fold".
-Phylogenetic analysis: The resolution is probably insufficient and the topology of the tree appears suspect as a
result. Further some proteins are evolving very rapidly and
at different rates and distort topology (e.g. Entamoeba).
The tree is not critical for the argument and it is best that
it is presented in the additional file.
-Introduction is too long. The authors can very briefly
state the importance of Mael and its biology rather than
attempting the current detailed description.
-The key functional prediction and sequence/structure
analysis can be also briefly presented.

-Rename DUF1777 to something more meaningful.
In conclusion a modified version of the paper, which is
suitably condensed and presents the major findings succinctly would be suitable for publication as a discovery
note in Biology Direct.
Authors' response
We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have revised
the introduction, results and discussion sections and transferred
the methods section to additional file 5. We considered the proposal to put Fig 2A in the supplement but feel strongly that it
should be in the main paper. We discuss MAEL evolution extensively in the main text, so the tree will be important for readers
to understand MAEL evolution, especially the transition
between DnaQ-H and MAEL residues. We agree that some
supporting values are weak, so we only present supporting value
greater than 75% for the nodes. We renamed DUF1777 as SR25-like domain because of its similarity to SR-25 domain family (pfam: PF10500) as revealed by the SCOOP program. For
terminology, we used DnaQ-H 3'–5' exonuclease family with
the RNase H fold. The reason why we emphasized DnaQ-H
(also called DEDDh) is to differentiate another DEDDy family
of 3'–5' exonuclease with the RNase H fold, which is characterized by conserved residues DEDYD.

In this paper, Dapeng Zhang et. al. attempt to decipher the
molecular function of the germ plasm-specific protein,
Maelstrom (MAEL) which has been implicated in the
piRNA pathway and also in chromatin remodeling from
previous experimental studies. The authors conjectured
Page 10 of 15

Biology Direct 2008, 3:48

that Maelstrom has nuclease-like activity from three main
findings: Firstly, the novel MAEL-specific domain is
defined by a set similar sequence segments (related via a
few PSI-BLAST searches) with a conserved motif involving
residues (Glu-His-His-Cys-His-Cys) from mostly metazoans (except of fish species) and some protists. Some of
these protist MAEL sequences also contain the DnaQ-H
specific site (Asp-Glu-Asp-His-Asp) that exhibits a 3–5'
exonuclease catalytic activity. Therefore, it seems likely
that the metazoan MAEL proteins had inherited nucleaselike activity from their protist MAEL ancestors. Secondly,
domain architecture analysis of MAEL-related proteins
showed the association of the MAEL domain with the
HMG (SMART: SM00398), DUF1777 (PFAM: PF08648)
and HDAC_interact (SMART: SM00761) for DNA binding, RNA binding and chromatin remodeling respectively.
Finally, structural modeling showed that the MAEL-specific domain (Glu-His-His-Cys-His-Cys) in metazoan is
able to form a structural core despite the lack of the DnaQH active residues. The authors also argued that the residues His, Cys and Glu are the most frequently residues
capable of interacting with Zn2+ and also utilized by
ColE7 endonuclease, Zinc transport protein ZnuA and
Aldolase; analogous to metal ion-binding DnaQ-H.
There are several critical points with this manuscript:
(1) The sequence segment family collection of homologous Maelstrom protein sequences is incomplete. Using
the fan-like search methodology as described in Schneider
et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2006 v.7, 164), more MAELlike sequences including sequences from Danio Rerio (e.g.
A2CF13_DANRE,
EXOD1_DANRE,EXOD1_DANRE/
Q502M8), oxidoreductases, DNA polymerases III and 3–
5'
exonucleases
(e.g.
Q503G0_DANRE,
THEX1_HUMAN;1W0H:A) from numerous species can
be found. Thus, there are homologs among fish species.
Authors' response
We thank you for your insights and suggestions. We also appreciate your attempts at retrieving additional sequences using
your novel methodology. The sequences you identified all are
DnaQ-H domains and some sequences you mentioned like
1W0H:A have been included in our study as representatives of
the DnaQ-H domain. As we mentioned in the main text, PSIBLAST searching with a profile inclusion E value of 0.05 can
retrieve several DnaQ-H exonucleases as significant hits. However, they are not included in our initial sequence analysis for
MAEL domains since they do not have MAEL specific residues
(EHHCHC), and introducing these sequences may dilute conserved characteristics of MAEL domains. We used an E value
of 0.005 for PSI-BLAST searches with different MAEL
domains as queries. They all retrieved the same set of MAEL
domain sequences. We also tried the HHsenser server, another
sensitive sequence searching program, which retrieved similar
results. We could not detect any fish MAEL domain from pro-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/48

tein, nucleotide/EST or even Ensembl genome databases of five
fish species. So, we are proposing that the MAEL domain is lost
in fish species according to these observations. This discovery
should be very interesting to experimental biologists who are
working on the piRNA pathway. We agree that other distant
homologs exist in fish, such as DnaQ-H members and other
RNase H members (like PIWI).
Reviewers' response
The emphasis on a set of conserved positions (yet without
a clear functional role) does not make the definition of a
domain. Most importantly, the notion of globular
domains unifies protein sequence segments having similarity of their fold (and, as a consequence, in their hydrophobic pattern). Besides understanding the types of
protein families that are in the vicinity of the starting
sequence, the purpose of performing fan-like search is
also to determine if the search space of the starting
sequence for its orthologous sequences is well sampled.
When sequences are been collected, the relationship of
orthology or paralogy is not obvious. But eventually, with
sufficient sequence collection, sequences from different
taxonomic groups will be able to form distinct group of
protein families. Finally, with reference to these neighboring protein families, one can then use clustering or phylogenetic methods to determine the orthology coverage of
the starting sequence. This has not been done in the work
of the authors. We have carried out a full sequence family
collection with a fan-like PSI-BLAST search (inclusion
value for score matrix of ≤ 0.001; e-value for PSI-blast initialization < 0.06), aligned the family and created a phylogenetic tree from hits (with the group of exonucleases
represented by the structure 1Y97 as outgroup, see attachment). It looks as if the so-called maelstrom group is surrounded by the bloom syndrome proteins (DNA
helicases), DEAD-domain containing RNA helicases followed by bacterial nucleases as next hits. The fish
sequences mentioned by us are in the neighboring helicase groups and, apparently, are not nucleases.
Authors' response
We have conducted profile-profile alignments between MAEL,
DnaQ (Exonuc X-T, Pfam: PF00929), and DEAD helicase
(including bloom syndrome proteins, Pfam: PF00270)
domains using the logomat-p program (additional file 6). In
contrast to detectable similarity between MAEL and DnaQ
domains, no global similarity between MAEL and DEAD helicase can be identified. The similarity between MAEL and
DnaQ domains is shown for the first 100 amino acid segment,
also seen in the PSI-BLAST results. The reason why the second
half segment does not appear to be homologous is that conserved
residues are different (CHC in MAEL and HD inDnaQ) and
that no structural fold considerations were made. Therefore, the
evolutionary tree inferred from unrelated sequences is not reliable. We do not agree with the assessment of the reviewers.

(2) An exhaustive search for homologous sequences
across all species is the foremost important task in function annotation transfer via homology. This exhaustive
list of the homologous sequences enables one to construct
clusters of orthologous and paralogous genes and to
group them in a phylogenetic tree. Among orthologous
sequences, function annotation transfer is able to hold
well especially for one-to-one orthologs, with decreased
confidence at greater evolutionary distances. On the
opposite end, paralogous sequences are generalized to be
functional diversified and specialized. This makes the task
of function annotation transfer more complex (see
Koonin, 2005, Annu. Rev. Genet., 39, 309–338). In this
paper, the exact homology relationships among the collected sequences were not well established and, thus,
function annotation transfer in this context is problematic. It appears to us that the exonucleases are in another
branch of the tree compared with maelstrom sequences;
thus, the predicted function might not be correct.
Authors' response
This paper presents an evolutionary relationship between MAEL
domains and DnaQ-H domains with the RNase H fold based
on structural fold similarity as well as the evidence that protist
MAEL domains have DnaQ-H specific residues. We do agree
that a direct function annotation transfer may not be guaranteed based on this evolutionary link because of functional divergences during protein evolution. But considering the general
functions in nuclease activities of DnaQ-H family as well as its
distantly related RNase-H superfamily members, we predicted
that MAEL may have a similar function with either nuclease or
RNA-binding activity. We provide a preliminary evolutionary
tree between DnaQ-H and MAEL domains in the additional
file 4 and combined this with Figure 2A for extensive discussion
in the last section. We hope this discovery will facilitate the further investigation on MAEL function.
Reviewers' response
We think that the conclusion about the functional relationship to the DnaQ-H domain is premature in this
form. A hit with 3D-jury is, at best indicative. Our family
search and the resulting phylogenetic tree (see attachment) bring the maelstrom group equally close to various
helicases and nucleases. This more stringent homology
search results (inclusion value for score matrix of ≤ 0.001;
e-value for PSI-blast initialization < 0.06) revealed that
the Maelstrom sequences are in close vicinity to a group of
Bloom syndrome proteins (belonging to the DNA helicase family), bacteria nucleases and helicases while the
exonucleases were not significant enough to be found
(consistent with authors' PSI-blast results of insignificant
p-value for the exonucleases). A preliminary phylogenetic
study (with exonuclease as the out-group) showed that
the Maelstrom sequences are most homologous to the
Bloom syndrome protein sequences in comparison to the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/48

other sequences. DnaQ-H is by far not the closest functionally characterized neighbors. In the absence of further
structural and catalytic information of the MAEL motif
(Glu-His-His-Cys-His-Cys), the functional evolution relationship between Maelstrom and exonuclease is still
unclear except for a potential similarity of fold.
If you do not have an own resource for correct family collection, we strongly suggest the authors to use protein
family searcher like HHsenser http://toolkit.tuebin
gen.mpg.de/hhsenser to collect more homologous
sequences to clarify the relationship of Maelstrom to its
adjacent protein families.
Authors' response
As we indicated previously, no sequence similarity can be
detected between MAEL and DEAD helicase domains. We
tried HHsenser to retrieve MAEL homologues sequences, and it
generated similar results as PSI-BLAST. We thank reviewers
for this suggestion.

(3) Furthermore, the suggestion of nuclease-like activity
in metazoan MAEL proteins is weak given that the DnaQH active residues were not conserved even if the predicted
tertiary structure is correct and, probably, conserved in the
family. A structural is only a plausibility argument; it does
not prove the conclusion. Doubts are the more appropriate since the homology model involves a translocation/
shifting of the active site.
At the end, a set of sequentially similar sequence segments
without any trustworthy molecular function prediction
remains. This result is not necessarily demanding another
publication.
Authors' response
We present general discoveries about MAEL, its evolutionary
link to DnaQ-H domains and structural predictions on active
sites. We agree that functional prediction is not the definitive
conclusion. However, we believe that our rigorous analysis may
give us a strong basis to hypothesize on function. Firstly, the
evolutionary link and possible DnaQ-H active site in protist
MAEL domains may suggest that protist MAEL domains have
a 3'–5' exonuclease activity. Secondly, for the MAEL domains
with EHHCHC residues, the high conservation of these residues likely reflects their functional contributions. Structural
examinations direct our attention to an active site since these
conserved EHHCHC residues are located closely together. We
then found other evidence including the property of E, H and C
residues to interact with metal ions and general functions of
evolutionarily related RNase-H fold families. Although we do
not have experimental support, these lines of evidence provide
structural, chemical and evolutionary basis for an active site,
and thus lead to our hypothesis that it may have nuclease activity or RNA-binding ability. Thirdly, translocation/shifting of

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:48

the active site is common in evolution of protein families as
reviewed by Todd et al. (2002) and Anantharaman et al.
(2003). It is also true for the RNase H fold superfamily in
which the DnaQ-H family and other families use their own specific residues to form different active sites. Therefore, we believe
that the DnaQ-H active site is lost during MAEL evolution and
the MAEL domain developed its own active residues. More
importantly, we identified some protist domains which have
both sets of active residues of DnaQ-H and MAEL domains.
They can serve as an evolutionary intermediate during this
translocation/shifting, thus suggesting a new mode for protein
function evolution.
Reviewers' response
Firstly, the authors utilized the 3D-jury results to indicate
that the maelstrom protein segment might confer a similar fold to that of DnaQ-H domain exemplified by pdb
1W0H:A. It appears to us that the evolutionary distance to
these exonucleases is considerable and that other groups
are much more closely related. We found the Maelstrom
sequences to be most homologous to the Bloom syndrome protein sequences. Therefore, the structural fold
prediction might not be reliable and, at such evolutionary
distances, it would be not surprising if the relative positions of important residues are scrambled. Furthermore,
the metazoan Maelstrom proteins have lost these residues
that appear indispensable for the nuclease activity. Unless
it can proven experimentally, the suggestion that metazoan Maelstroms have nuclease activity seems less plausible, especially given the presence of a more closely related
group of Bloom syndrome proteins.

Secondly, Anantharaman et al. state that the presence of a
characteristic set of conserved active residues is important
for the identification of enzymes in sequence analysis. The
set of conserved active residues are typically derived from
known set of sequences and structures of related enzymes.
For those proteins with preserved structure but varying
catalytic residues, the detection of evolutionary relationship is far more difficult. In the case of the Maelstrom, the
structure is purely hypothetical and the MAEL motif (GluHis-His-Cys-His-Cys) has yet to show nuclease-like activity. Therefore, to say that a translocation or shifting of the
active nucleatic site has occurred in the Maelstrom in the
course of its evolution simply cannot be proven at this
point without further experimentation or other type of
compelling information. Thus, the molecular function of
the maelstrom domain remains unclear and the current
stage of research does not justify a report; otherwise, any
additional branch of the phylogenetic tree would deserve
another article.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/48

domains belong to the RNase H fold. It is not possible that a
reliable searching with MAEL sequences can retrieve both
DnaQ-H domains and DEAD helicase domains. Secondly,
since no similarity exists between the MAEL/DnaQ and DEAD
domains, it is not reasonable to align them together and infer
their evolutionary history. Thirdly, we agree with the reviewer
that similar structural fold alone does not provide sufficient evidence of common ancestry [75]. However, significant sequence
conservation, structural resemblance and catalytic residue conservation may strongly indicate evolutionary relationship
[71,75]. In our study, the proposed evolutionary relationship is
established on the basis of three lines of evidence: 1, sequence
similarity via PSI-BLAST, which provides the most straightforward evidence of homology [75]; 2, similar structural fold; 3,
ancestral protist MAEL domains have DnaQ-H characteristic
residues. We thank the reviewers for their efforts.
