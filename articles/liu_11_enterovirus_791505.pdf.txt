Enterovirus 71 induces degradation of TRIM38, a
potential E3 ubiquitin ligase
Xinlei Liu, Xiaobo Lei, Zhuo Zhou, Zhenmin Sun, Qinghua Xue, Jianwei Wang*, Tao Hung

Abstract
Background: The tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are a family of more than 70 members in human. However, only
a few of them have been well studied. The TRIM proteins contain the conserved RING, B-box, coiled-coil, and SPRY
domains, most of which are involved in protein ubiquitination. TRIM38 is a member of the TRIM protein family,
which we studied in more detail here as its functions are largely unknown.
Results: Our study shows that, similar to other TRIM family members, TRIM38 is localized in the cytoplasm. TRIM38
increases ubiquitination of other cellular proteins and catalyzes self-ubiquitination. TRIM38 also promotes K63- and
K48-linked ubiquitination of cellular proteins. An intact RING domain is important for the functions of TRIM38. In
addition, enterovirus 71 infection induces TRIM38 degradation.
Conclusions: Our observations demonstrate that TRIM38 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and can be degraded
during virus infection. These findings may provide insight into innate immune signaling pathways.

Background
The tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and antiviral defense [1-5]. Most
members of the TRIM family contain the conserved
RING domain, one or two B-box domains and coiledcoil domain (CCD) [6]. The RING domain is a specialized zinc finger of 40-60 residues in the N-terminus of
most TRIM proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RING finger domain of many TRIM
proteins, including that of TRIM5a, TRIM22, and
TRIM25, possesses an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which
can catalyze ubiquitin to cellular proteins or viral proteins [7-10]. The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of some
TRIM proteins plays an important role in regulating
innate immune signaling as well as restricting HIV replication [11-13].
Ubiquitin is a highly conserved protein consisting of
76 amino acids. It is involved in multiple cellular processes [14]. For example, ubiquitin protein conjugation
represents a novel post-transcriptional modification.
Furthermore, although ubiquitin contains seven lysine

residues, all of which can be used to assemble various
linkage polyubiquitin chains, only the functions of Lys48
(K48) and Lys63 (K63) linkage polyubiquitin chains have
been well characterized. K63-linked polyubiquitin chains
have been shown to be involved in stress response, protein kinase activation, protein-protein interactions and
assembly of signaling complexes [15,16]; whereas K48linked polyubiquitin chains are tagged to substrates,
which are recognized by the 26S proteasome for degradation [17]. The specificity to the ubiquitin conjugation
system is provided by E3 ligases through direct interaction with substrates. Some such E3 ligases are RING finger proteins [7,8].
In recent years, outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth
disease (HFMD) have occurred frequently in many
countries with high mortalities, in particular in the AsiaPacific area, and have become a great challenge to
public health [18-20]. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the
Picornviridae, is one of the major causative agents for
HFMD [21]. Although HFMD is usually a mild disease,
EV71 infection can be associated with severe neurological complications, including encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, and fatal pulmonary edema in infants and young
children [19,22,23]. Thus, EV71 has become the most
important neurotropic enterovirus after the eradication

of poliomyelitis [23]. Effective antiviral drugs and vaccines against EV71 are currently still unavailable. To
date, little is known about the mechanism of EV71
pathogenesis. It is believed that host factors are involved
in the pathogenesis of EV71 infections which may affect
host functions, such as translation and polyadenylation
by degradation of eIF5B and CstF-64 [24,25]. EV71 can
also strongly block the interferon response, an important innate immunity mechanism against virus infections
[26].
An increasing number of TRIM proteins have been
identified and have been found to be involved in processes associated with innate immunity [27]. TRIM38 is
a member of the TRIM protein family with a RING finger domain. However, its cellular functions have not
been well studied. In this report, we demonstrate that
TRIM38 is a potential RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase.
We also show that EV71 infection induces degradation
of TRIM38 in the cells, suggesting that TRIM38 may
play a role in viral infections.

Results
Characterization of TRIM38

Analysis by Map Viewer software on the NCBI website
showed that the TRIM38 gene is located on human
chromosome 6p21.3, and clustered with other TRIM
genes including TRIM10, TRIM15, TRIM26, TRIM27,
TRIM31, TRIM39, and TRIM40 (data not shown). The
RING-domain, which is located at the N-terminus of
TRIMs, is critical to the activity of most E3 ligase [7,8].
To characterize the similarity between TRIM38 and
other TRIMs, amino acid sequences of the TRIM proteins with their N-terminal domain were aligned using
Vector NTI Advance 9. The results show that these
TRIMs all possess a RING-consensus sequence (Figure
1A). The RING domain is a type of zinc finger which
contains a Cys3HisCys4 (yellow area, Figure 1A) amino
acid motif that binds two zinc cations [28]. Phylogenetic
analysis suggests that TRIM38 is closely related to
TRIM39 and TRIM27. TRIM38 and TRIM39 share 37%
amino acid identity, and TRIM38 shares 34% amino
acid identity with TRIM27 throughout the protein
sequence (Figure 1B).
We then examined the subcellular localization of
endogenous TRIM38 in A549 cell lines, which have a
relatively high expression of TRIM38, by first incubating A549 cells with polyclonal rabbit anti-TRIM38
antibody, followed by labeling with anti-rabbit IgG/
DyLight 594 conjugated secondary antibodies. As
shown in Figure 1C, TRIM38 was detected mainly in
the cytoplasm, but hardly in the nucleus. These results
indicated that the subcellular localization of TRIM38 is
similar to other TRIM proteins such as TRIM27 and
TRIM39 [29,30].

TRIM38 functions as an E3 enzyme and self-ubiquitinates
ex vivo

Many RING finger domain-containing proteins have
been shown to bind ubiquitin enzymes or their substrates, hence functioning as E3 ligases [7-9]. As
TRIM38 has a RING-finger domain which is located
between Cys-16 and Cys-62 at its N-terminal region, we
hypothesized that TRIM38 functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. To test this, 293T cells were transiently
transfected with Flag-tagged-TRIM38 and pRK5-HAubiquitin-WT polypeptide (HA-ubi). Subsequently,
whole cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot using
anti-HA polyclonal antibodies in order to detect HAtagged ubiquitin conjugated proteins. The expression of
Flag-tagged TRIM38 was probed with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. As shown in Figure 2A, ubiquitin conjugates were produced in cells transfected with HA-ubi
alone, reflecting ubiquitination by endogenous ubiquitin
ligase. The level of conjugates was markedly increased
in the presence of Flag-tagged-TRIM38 (Figure 2A).
Our data demonstrated that TRIM38 could catalyze the
ubiquitination of cellular proteins.
Recently, several groups reported that E3 ubiquitin
ligases are ubiquitinated by themselves [7,9]. Thus, we
evaluated whether TRIM38 can be self-ubiquitinated.
For this purpose, HA-ubi vector was co-expressed with
Flag-tagged-TRIM38, and co-immunoprecipitation
assays were performed. Immunoblot analysis revealed
that Flag-tagged-TRIM38 was ubiquitinated when coexpressed with HA-Ubi (Figure 2B). These results suggest that TRIM38 can be ubiquitinated by itself.
Substrates that are recognized by the 26S proteasome
are tagged by K48-linked polyubiquitin chains [17]. As
mentioned before, TRIM38 could be ubiquitinated.
Thus, we tested whether TRIM38-mediated cellular
proteins degradation was promoted by K48-linked ubiquitination by co-transfecting Flag-TRIM38 with pRK5HA-ubiquitin-K48 (HA-Ubi-K48) into 293T cells, and
ubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated using
anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies. Immunoprecipitated
poly-ubiquitinated TRIM38 was detected using the antiFlag and anti-HA antibodies. Western blot analysis
revealed that TRIM38 mediated its own K48-ubiquitination (Figure 2C) when co-expressed with HA-Ubi-K48.
RING domain is important for ubiquitin activity of TRIM38

Many RING-finger proteins have been identified as E3
ubiquitin ligases [7-9]. This E3 activity of RING-finger
proteins can be abolished by deletion of the conserved
RING domain. To evaluate the possible roles of the
RING domain in the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of
TRIM38, we constructed a TRIM38 mutant in which
the RING domain was deleted, Flag-TRIM38-ΔRING
(ΔRING, deletion from residues 16 to 62) (Figure 3A).

family members were aligned using Clustal W. The alignment was then used to build trees in MEGA4. The scale bar represents evolutionary
distance in amino acid residues. (C) TRIM38 was visualized via labeling with polyclonal rabbit anti-TRIM38, followed by labeling with anti-rabbit

HA-ubi vector was co-expressed with Flag-TRIM38 or
Flag-TRIM38-ΔRING. Cells were collected and wholecell extracts were analyzed by Western blot. As
expected, no ubiquitination activity was detected with
TRIM38-ΔRING compared to the wild type TRIM38
(Figure 3B). The results strongly suggest that the RINGfinger domain is required for TRIM38 to catalyze ubiquitin-conjugation of cellular proteins.
TRIM38 catalyzes K63-linked ubiquitin to cellular proteins

Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues, all of which
can be used to assemble various linkage specific polyubiquitin chains. However, only K48 and K63 polyubiquitin
linkages have been well determined in cells. The K63linked chains function in cell signaling pathways and the
K48-linked chains are used for proteasomal degradation
[15-17]. To test whether TRIM38 could influence both
or one of the two types of polyubiquitin linkages, we coexpressed Flag-TRIM38 or Flag-TRIM38-ΔRING with
K63-linked ubiquitin and K48-linked ubiquitin in 293T
cells. As shown in Figure 4, TRIM38 facilitated synthesis
of both K63- and K48- linked polyubiquitin chains. But
the activity of TRIM38 facilitating synthesis of K63linked polyubiquitin chains could be abolished by deletion of the conserved RING domain (Figure 4A),

however, the K48-linked polyubiquitination is not
affected if the RING domain of TRIM38 is deleted (Figure 4B). Our data demonstrated that the RING domain
of TRIM38 is needed to catalyze the K63-linked ubiquitin to cellular proteins.
EV71 infection promotes degradation of TRIM38

TRIM family proteins are associated with virus-host
interaction and antiviral activities, especially in IFN
responses [10,31]. Expression of several TRIM proteins
was shown to be altered after treatment with IFN.
TRIM38 expression was up-regulated by type I IFN in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocyte derived
macrophages [32]. To examine whether TRIM38 expression is affected upon virus infection, we analyzed the
TRIM38 expression level in response to EV71 infection.
For A549 cells infected with EV71 (MOI = 2), qRT-PCR
analysis was performed to determine the mRNA level of
TRIM38, using GAPDH as an internal control. As indicated in Figure 5A, EV71 did not influence the RNA
level of TRIM38. In parallel to the qRT-PCR analysis,
protein expression levels of TRIM38 were examined by
Western blot. We found that EV71 infection reduced
the amount of TRIM38 protein (Figure 5B). Similarly,
we found that Sendai viral infection led to a decrease in

itself ex vivo. (A) TRIM38 catalyzes the ubiquitination of cellular
proteins. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FlagTRIM38 (lanes 1 and 2), pRK5-HA-Ubiquitin (lanes 2 and 3). Whole
cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies
against HA, Flag and b-actin. (B) TRIM38 is self-ubiquitinated. Similar
to (A), except that cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiFlag. Immunoprecipitates and aliquots of cell lysates were subjected
to Western blot analysis with antibodies against HA, Flag, and bactin. (C) TRIM38 mediates itself K48-ubiquitination. 293T cells were

pRK5-HA-ubiquitin-K48 (lanes 2 and 3). Cell lysates were

TRIM38 expression (data not shown). These observations were associated with the replication of EV71, as
levels of EV71 proteins increased with time in A549
cells as seen by in-cell Western blot analysis (Figure
5C). Taken together, these findings indicate that EV71
infection reduces the TRIM38 expression at the protein
level rather than at RNA level and that TRIM38 may
play a role in virus infection.

Discussion
TRIM38 has been shown to be capable of activating NFB signaling pathways [33]. In this study, we performed
ex vivo ubiquitylation assays to evaluate if TRIM38 functions as an E3 ligase, and found that TRIM38 can
increase the ubiquitination of cellular proteins and be
self-ubiquitinated in the cells. Further, we demonstrated
that the ability of TRIM38 to increase the level of ubiquitination depends on its RING finger domain. In addition, we demonstrated that TRIM38 is located in the
cytoplasm, and its expression is reduced by EV71 infection. These results support the notion that TRIM38 is a
potential RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase and it may
participate in virus-host interactions.

Many TRIM proteins have an E3 ligase activity [34].
For example, TRIM25 could markedly increase the
ubiquitination level of exogenous RIG-I (Retinoic acidinducible gene I), and potentiate the production of RIGI mediated interferon-b to elicit host antiviral response
[8,35]. TRIM22 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in a
RING finger dependent manner [7], and is required to

quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR-Green. GAPDH gene primer sets were used as an internal control. (B) Detection of TRIM38 protein. At 4, 8,

mediate antiviral activity against encephalomyocardites
virus and HIV [10,31]. TRIM5a was also shown to be
crucial for anti-HIV function [36,37], and TRIM19/promyelocytic leukemia (PML) has been identified as a cellular factor against viral infection [38]. Here we show
that N-terminal RING domain of TRIM38 is necessary
for its potential E3 ligase activity. This result is consistent with that of other E3 ubiquitin ligases of the TRIM
family proteins. However, the substrate(s) of TRIM38
other than itself remains unknown.
Ubiquitin conjugation represents a novel pattern of
posttranscriptional modification and is involved in regulation of different cellular processes in addition to
proteolytic degradation. It has been demonstrated that
K63-linked polyubiquitination chains are involved in
TAK1 (Transforming growth factor b-activated kinase 1)
kinase complex activation and IKK (the IB kinase) phosphorylation [39,40]. TRAF6 (Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6) is also an E3 ubiquitin ligase and
specifically catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on
target proteins, including NEMO (NF-kappa-B essential
modulator) and TRAF6 itself to activate the type I interferon signaling pathways [41]. Based on our observations
in this study, we can speculate that TRIM38 may facilitate
the assembly of a K63-linked polyubiquitin chain in a
RING domain dependent manner and thus participate in
regulating innate immune signaling pathways.
E3 ligase has been shown to interact with virus proteins and is involved in antiviral activity during viral
infection. For example, TRIM22 was shown to interact

with the 3C protease of encephalomyocarditis virus and
mediate its ubiquitination against picornaviruses [10].
Our observations demonstrate that the expression of
TRIM38 protein is regulated after viral infection. Therefore, TRIM38 may play a role in the virus infection.
In conclusion, TRIM38 act as a potential E3 ubiquitin
ligase. We propose that TRIM38 catalyzes its substrates
through ubiquitylation in the cytoplasm, thus regulating
signaling pathways or interacting with virus proteins to
interfere with virus replication. The precise role and
mechanism of TRIM38 in ubiquitylation and virus infection need to be further addressed.

Methods
Cell lines and virus

The human lung carcinoma cell line A549 and human
embryo kidney cells 293T were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The EV71 strain used in this study
(Shenzhen 98), kindly provided by Dr. Qi Jin, was
described previously [27]. Virus infection was carried
out as follows. Briefly, A549 cells were infected with
EV71 at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI).
Viruses were washed away after 2 h, and cells were then
cultured with fresh medium supplemented with 2% FBS.
At the indicated times post infection, cell lysates were
harvested and were subjected to Western blot analysis.

Plasmids

The TRIM38 expressing plasmid pCMV6-Entry-TRIM38
was purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville,
MD). The Flag-tagged-TRIM38, Flag-TRIM38-ΔRING,
deletions were constructed by using a site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the
pCMV6-Entry-TRIM38 vector following the protocols
provided by the manufacturer. The ubiquitin expression
plasmids pRK5-HA-ubiquitin-WT, pRK5-HA-ubiquitinK63, pRK5-HA-ubiquitin-K48 were made available
through Addgene http://www.addgene.org.
Computational analysis of TRIM family members

For phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequences of
TRIM family members encoded by genes on human
chromosome 6p21.3 and 6p22 were aligned using Vector NTI Advance 9 (InforMax) and Clustal W [42].
The alignment was then used to build phylogenetic
trees in MEGA 4 [43]. The following amino acid
sequences of human TRIM family members were
included in the phylogenetic analysis, including
TRIM10 (GenBank accession number: NP_006769.2),
TRIM15 (NP_150232.2), TRIM26 (NP_003440.1),
TRIM27 (NP_006501.1), TRIM31 (NP_008959.3),
TRIM38 (NP_006346.1), TRIM39 (NP_067076.2), and
TRIM40 (NP_619645.1).

(Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE). After the membranes were
washed with 0.1% Tween20 in PBS, they were scanned
by using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor)
at a wavelength of 700 to 800 nm and analyzed with
Odyssey software. The molecular sizes of the developed
proteins were determined by comparison with prestained protein markers (Fermentas, Maryland, CA).
Immunoprecipitation

Cells were collected at 48 h after transfection and lyzed
with 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate,
1 mM EDTA and proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN). Whole-cell lysates of cells were used
for immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies
against Flag or HA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in the presence of protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Generally, 1-2 μg of
commercial antibody was added to 500 μl of cell lysates,
which was incubated at 4°C overnight. Immunocomplexes captured on the affinity gel or protein A/G agarose beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer and
eluted with SDS loading buffer by boiling for 5 min.
Then the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
Western blot analysis.
In-cell Western blot

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy

A549 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15
min at room temperature, and then blocked with 5%
BSA for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with antiTRIM38 polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) overnight at 4°C. After cells were washed with
PBS, they were incubated with Alexa Fluor-594 goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and washed three times with PBS. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS SP5 laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems).
Western blot

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lyzed in buffer
containing 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1%
NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mM EDTA
as well as a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Aliquots of cell lysates were resolved on
10% SDS PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Pall, Port Washington, NY). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and then
incubated with anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO),
anti-HA (Sigma) and anti-b-actin (Sigma) primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. This was followed by incubation with the corresponding IRD Fluor 800-labeled IgG
or IRD Fluor 680-labeled IgG secondary antibody

A549 cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of
104 cells per well. The next day, cells were infected with
EV71 at MOI of 2. At 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h post
infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for
10 min at room temperature. After cells were washed
with PBS, they were incubated with mouse antibody
against whole EV71 virion (Chemicon, Temecula, CA;
this antibody can only used for immunofluorescence or
In-cell Western blot) and rabbit anti-lamin A (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO; used as internal reference)
overnight at 4°C. Then, cells were washed with 0.1%
Tween-20 in PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse
800 (1:500) and goat anti-rabbit 680 (1:500) (Li-Cor).
Cells were scanned by using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor) at a wavelength of 700 to 800 nm
and analyzed with Odyssey software.
Real-time quantitative PCR

A549 cells were mock-infected or infected by EV71 at
an MOI of 2. At different time points after infection,
total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). cDNA was generated from total RNA using
a Superscript cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was
performed using SYBR® PrimeScript™ RT-PCR Kit II
(Takara) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
