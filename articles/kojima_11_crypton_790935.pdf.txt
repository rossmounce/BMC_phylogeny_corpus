Crypton transposons: identification of new diverse
families and ancient domestication events
Kenji K Kojima and Jerzy Jurka*

Abstract
Background: “Domestication” of transposable elements (TEs) led to evolutionary breakthroughs such as the origin
of telomerase and the vertebrate adaptive immune system. These breakthroughs were accomplished by the
adaptation of molecular functions essential for TEs, such as reverse transcription, DNA cutting and ligation or DNA
binding. Cryptons represent a unique class of DNA transposons using tyrosine recombinase (YR) to cut and rejoin
the recombining DNA molecules. Cryptons were originally identified in fungi and later in the sea anemone, sea
urchin and insects.
Results: Herein we report new Cryptons from animals, fungi, oomycetes and diatom, as well as widely conserved
genes derived from ancient Crypton domestication events. Phylogenetic analysis based on the YR sequences
supports four deep divisions of Crypton elements. We found that the domain of unknown function 3504 (DUF3504)
in eukaryotes is derived from Crypton YR. DUF3504 is similar to YR but lacks most of the residues of the catalytic
tetrad (R-H-R-Y). Genes containing the DUF3504 domain are potassium channel tetramerization domain containing
1 (KCTD1), KIAA1958, zinc finger MYM type 2 (ZMYM2), ZMYM3, ZMYM4, glutamine-rich protein 1 (QRICH1) and
“without children” (WOC). The DUF3504 genes are highly conserved and are found in almost all jawed vertebrates.
The sequence, domain structure, intron positions and synteny blocks support the view that ZMYM2, ZMYM3,
ZMYM4, and possibly QRICH1, were derived from WOC through two rounds of genome duplication in early
vertebrate evolution. WOC is observed widely among bilaterians. There could be four independent events of
Crypton domestication, and one of them, generating WOC/ZMYM, predated the birth of bilaterian animals. This is
the third-oldest domestication event known to date, following the domestication generating telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) and Prp8. Many Crypton-derived genes are transcriptional regulators with additional DNAbinding domains, and the acquisition of the DUF3504 domain could have added new regulatory pathways via
protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions.
Conclusions: Cryptons have contributed to animal evolution through domestication of their YR sequences. The
DUF3504 domains are domesticated YRs of animal Crypton elements.

Background
The structural and mechanistic variety of transposable elements (TEs) is well-documented [1]. They encode proteins
that include diverse functional domains involved in catalysis or interaction with DNA, RNA and other proteins.
Because of this diverse repertoire, TEs can supply functional modules to generate new genes. “Molecular domestication” of transposable elements [2] led to evolutionary

milestones such as the origin of telomerase and the vertebrate adaptive immune system. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) provides a solution for end replication
problems accompanying linear chromosome replication
and was derived from a reverse transcriptase (RT) related
to Penelope-like elements in the very early stage of eukaryote evolution [3,4]. V(D)J recombination is a mechanism
used in jawed vertebrates to generate a variety of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors. It is catalyzed by the
recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) derived from a
transposase encoded by the Transib family of DNA transposons [5]. Different kinds of transposon proteins were

domesticated, including transposase, integrase, RT, envelope and gag proteins [6]. Herein we report in-depth studies of another type of transposon enzyme, tyrosine
recombinase (YR), which was repeatedly domesticated in
the history of animals.
To date four types of enzymes are known to catalyze
DNA integration of eukaryotic transposons: DDE-transposase, YR, rolling-circle replication initiator and the
combination of RT and endonuclease (EN) [7]. DDEtransposase is the most abundant gene in nature [8] and
is carried by many DNA transposon superfamilies, selfsynthesizing transposons (Polinton), as well as long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (Gypsy, Copia, BEL
and endogenous retroviruses) [1,9-11]. They share three
conserved amino acids (DDD or DDE) at their catalytic
sites, which are separated by amino acid sequences of
varying length. Some domesticated DDE-transposases
became DNA-binding proteins, such as CENP-B in mammals and Daysleeper in Arabidopsis thaliana [12,13].
Non-LTR retrotransposons and Penelope-like elements
use a combination of RT and EN in their transposition
[14-17]. Helitron is the only group of eukaryotic transposons encoding rolling-circle replication initiator [9].
YR genes are ubiquitous in prokaryotes but rare in
eukaryotes [18,19]. All YRs found in eukaryotes are
encoded by mobile elements: yeast 2-micron circle plasmids [20], ciliate Euplotes crassus transposons (Tec1,
Tec2 and Tec3) [21,22], three groups of retrotransposons
(DIRS/Pat, Ngaro and VIPER) [23-25], and Cryptons [19].
The YR encoded by the yeast 2-micron plasmid, known
as “flippase” (FLP), is widely used for site-specific recombination in the FLP-FRT system [26]. Tec1 and Tec2
transposons encode a DDE-transposase in addition to
YR, and therefore the YR domains in these transposons
are probably involved in resolving transposition intermediates. To date the only YR-encoding transposons
found in the vertebrate genomes are DIRS and Ngaro retrotransposons. Cryptons were originally found in a basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans and several
pathogenic fungi. Their boundaries are difficult to characterize because they have neither terminal inverted
repeats (TIRs) nor long direct repeats. Instead they have
short direct repeats at both termini. These 4- or 6-bp
direct repeats are considered substrates for recombination. By analogy to prokaryotic YR-encoding transposons,
Goodwin et al. [19] proposed that Cryptons are excised
from the host genome as an extrachromosomal circular
DNA and integrated at a different locus in the genome.
YR typically recognizes recombination sites consisting of
two inverted repeats that are 11 to 13 bp long and separated by a segment 6 to 8 bp long [27]. Recently, transposons encoding only a YR have been found in sea urchin,
insects and cnidarians and classified as Cryptons [28,29].
YR contains four catalytically important residues (R-H-R-

Page 2 of 17

Y), but their overall sequence identity is very low among
different genes and transposons [18,19]. The conserved
tyrosine residue directly binds to DNA in the recombination reaction. In this paper, we report Cryptons from various species, including medaka fish, and six human genes
originated from ancient domestication events of Crypton
YRs.

Results
The diversity of Crypton elements in terms of their
sequence and domain structure

We identified 94 Crypton elements from 24 species
representing animals, fungi and stramenopiles that
include oomycetes and diatom (Figure 1, Table 1 and
Additional file 1). Phylogenetic clustering of Cryptons on
the basis of their YR domain sequences revealed four
groups reflecting the systematics of their hosts (Figure 2,
open circles), but two of them were not strongly supported phylogenetically because of the low bootstrap
values. Herein we designate them as CryptonF, CryptonS,
CryptonA and CryptonI to indicate their corresponding
hosts: fungi, stramenopiles, animals and insects. CryptonA and CryptonI are structurally similar; however,
CryptonF, CryptonS and CryptonA/CryptonI have distinct
protein domain structures (see Figure 1 and detailed
description in the next three sections). Because of the
low resolution of the phylogenetic tree, we could not
determine whether there is any relationship between
these four Crypton groups and to other YR-encoding elements, and we cannot rule out the possibility that they
have originated independently.
CryptonF elements from fungi and oomycetes, and
CryptonF-derived genes

We identified CryptonF elements in nine species of fungi
and four species of oomycetes (Table 1 and Additional file
1). These elements encode a protein that includes YR and
GCR1_C DNA-binding domains (Figure 1). Most of the
fungal Cryptons and the five oomycete Cryptons are associated with 6-bp terminal direct repeats, which are likely
substrates for Crypton integration (Additional file 1). In
Fusarium oxysporum, Crypton is fused with a Marinertype DNA transposon and this composite transposon is
hearafter named MarCry-1_FO (Figure 1). The analysis of
four MarCry-1_FO copies with more than 97% identity to
each other revealed the presence of 16-bp TIRs and target
site duplications (TSDs) of the TA dinucleotide, indicating
that their Mariner-type DDE-transposase is responsible
for transposition. CryptonF-2_PS from Phytophthora sojae
and related elements encode a C48 peptidase (Ulp1 protease) in addition to a YR (Figure 1). The oomycete CryptonF elements are nested in fungal CryptonF elements in
the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), indicating a horizontal
transfer between fungi and oomycetes.

Four genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were derived
from CryptonF elements (Figure 3 and Additional files 2
and 3). It was previously reported that the GCR1_C protein domain encoded by Gcr1, Msn1 and Hot1 genes is
similar to the C-terminal part of fungal Cryptons [19]. In
addition to these three genes, we found that Cbf2/Ndc10
contains a C-terminal domain similar to CryptonF proteins. The central portions of Cbf2 and Gcr1 are similar
to CryptonF YR domains, but the catalytic site is not preserved (data not shown). Vanderwaltozyma polyspora
carries two paralogous genes of Gcr1 and Msn1. Candida
tropicalis and related species (Candida albicans, Pichia
stipitis and Pichia guilliermondii) harbor another gene
derived from a CryptonF element, represented by

XP_002548716 in C. tropicalis. It is designated herein as
Crypton-derived gene 1 (Cdg1) (Figure 3). The only
domain shared by CryptonF elements and all Cryptonderived genes is the GCR1_C domain. The phylogenetic
analysis of GCR1_C domains (Figure 3C) indicates that
Hot1 and Msn1 are paralogous and that the gene related
to Hot1/Msn1 in C. tropicalis represents an outgroup of
both genes. Therefore, it is likely that four domestication
events (for Hot1/Msn1, Gcr1, Cbf2 and Cdg1) occurred in
this group.
We could not find any Crypton insertions in the subphylum Saccharomycotina (including S. cerevisiae,
C. tropicalis and related species). The distribution of
Crypton-derived genes indicates that Crypton was active

in the past and that the DNA-binding domain GCR1_C
was most likely derived from Cryptons.
CryptonS, a new group of Cryptons from oomycetes and
diatom

We found CryptonS elements in seven oomycete and one
diatom species (Figure 1, Table 1 and Additional file 1).
CryptonS elements do not encode any GCR1_C domain,
but the C-terminal region is conserved among CryptonS
elements. CryptonS elements are associated with 5- or 6bp terminal direct repeats. The majority of CryptonS elements share TATGG termini. Some CryptonS elements
encode an additional protein containing a C48 peptidase
domain. The peptidases encoded by CryptonS and CryptonF elements in oomycetes belong to the same family and
are related to the Ulp1 protease family. Domain shuffling
between two groups of Crypton elements could explain
the similarity, but more data are needed to determine the
relationship between these peptidases and other cellular
peptidases.
Cryptons in animals (CryptonA and CryptonI groups)

We identified Cryptons in seven metazoan animals belonging to five phyla (Table 1 and Additional file 1). CryptonI
elements were found only in insects, whereas CryptonA
elements were found in various animals, including cnidarians. Animal Cryptons (both CryptonA and CryptonI) have
no C-terminal domain (Figure 1). We did not find any
terminal repeats in animal Cryptons. CryptonI-1_RPro
from Rhodnius prolixus hosts a non-autonomous derivative family, CryptonI-1N1_RPro, in which 5’ 438 bp and 3’
260 bp are 98% identical to those of CryptonI-1_RPro.
This is the first report of non-autonomous Crypton elements. Comparison of 50 copies of CryptonI-1_RPro and
CryptonI-1N1_RPro revealed no terminal repeats (neither
direct nor inverted). In medaka, we also found two families
of non-autonomous derivatives (CryptonA-1N1_OL and
CryptonA-1N2_OL) of CryptonA-1_OL. As in the case of
other DNA transposons, Crypton non-autonomous elements are much more abundant than their autonomous
counterparts.
We can safely rule out the theoretically possible contamination of the genomic sequences from medaka used in
this study. First, we identified more than 2,700 copies of
autonomous and non-autonomous Crypton elements with
DNA sequence identities to consensus ranging from 59%
to 98%. The nucleotide diversity of Cryptons from medaka
is consistent with their long-term presence in the medaka
lineage. Second, we found many Crypton sequences in the
database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from three different medaka strains: Hd-rR, CAB and HNI (data not
shown). We also found several Cryptons with inserted
medaka-specific transposons such as piggyBac-N1_OL and
RTE-1_OL (Table 2).

Crypton-derived sequences in the ATF7IP gene

Identification of Cryptons in three deuterostome species
(medaka, sea urchin and acorn worm) prompted us to
extend analysis of Cryptons in chordates, including four
sequenced actinopterygian species (Fugu rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Danio rerio).
Although multiple copies of Crypton elements were found
only in medaka, sequences similar to Cryptons were found
in various chordate species (Table 3). Most of them do not
encode any functional recombinases, owing to frameshifts,
deletions and substitutions at catalytically essential
residues.
However, two similar sequences (ABQF01015803 from
the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata and AAVX01068049
from the chimaera (elephant shark) Callorhinchus milii)
include an intact open reading frame of YR (Figure 4A).
We did not further analyze the sequence from chimaera,
because the sequenced region was only 2,661 bp in
length. The Crypton-like sequence in zebra finch is inside
an intron of a gene coding for activating transcription
factor 7 interacting protein (ATF7IP) (Figure 4B). There
is a YR sequence at the orthologous locus of chicken Gallus gallus, which encodes a protein 97% identical to that
of zebra finch, but it contains a frameshift inside the YR
region. The orthologous YR sequence from the turkey
Meleagris gallopavo contains a frameshift at the same
position (data not shown). Because the divergence
between chicken and zebra finch occurred some 107 million years ago (MYA) [30], this unusually high similarity
indicates a strong selection operating on these YR
sequences. An exon-intron prediction program would
predict alternative splicing in the ATF7IP gene from
zebra finch, although at present there are no mRNA or
ESTs corresponding to the fusion transcript. It is possible
that the YR is translated as part of the ATF7IP protein
and retains catalytic activity in some birds.
Using the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC)
Genome Browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/, we found
that there are partial Crypton sequences at the orthologous positions of the ATF7IP gene from the human,
horse, kangaroo and platypus genomes (Figures 4B and
4C). There are also closely related sequences present in
the genomes of rhesus macaque and tarsier. Therefore,
the insertion of Crypton in the ATF7IP gene must have
occurred in the common ancestor of amniotes more
than 325 MYA [30]. None of the mammalian orthologous sequences encode intact YR proteins, and many
mammalian species are missing the YR sequence. This
indicates only a slight, if any, selective pressure on this
sequence in mammals.
Ancient domestication of Cryptons in animals

Most vertebrate genes similar to Crypton code for proteins (Additional file 4). In the human genome, there are

seven proteins similar to Crypton YRs, which are annotated as parts of six genes (Figure 5 and Additional file
5). The KIAA1958 gene contains two isoforms, both of
which include YR-derived sequences. The other genes
are potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 1 (KCTD1), zinc finger, myeloproliferative and mental
retardation type 2 (ZMYM2)/zinc finger protein 198
(ZNF198), ZMYM3/ZNF261, ZMYM4/ZNF262 and glutamine-rich protein 1 (QRICH1) (Figure 5). A PSIBLAST search of these proteins against the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) conserved
domain database (CDD) revealed that they share a
domain of unknown function (DUF3504 superfamily;
E-value ≤ 1e-29). The six genes are widespread among
vertebrates (Figure 6) and are highly conserved among
phylogenetically distant species (Table 4). The phylogenetic relationship of each gene agreed with that of species
(data not shown). The nucleotide sequences corresponding

to all seven DUF3504 domains were present in the NCBI
EST database, indicating their expression. The data clearly
show that they are neither pseudogenes nor defective Cryptons (see the accession numbers of DUF3504 genes in
Additional file 5). However, none of them preserve the YR
catalytic site. All of them lost the catalytic tyrosine and the
second conserved arginine, and all but KCTD1 also lost
the conserved histidine.
Although the resolution is low because of high divergence and the short length of the YR sequence, animal
DUF3504 genes tend to cocluster with animal Cryptons
(CryptonA) in the YR phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). There
are four independent clusters of DUF3504 genes:
KCTD1, KIAA1958a, KIAA1958b/KIAA1958L and WOC/
ZMYM/QRICH1 (Figure 2, filled circles). KCTD1 coclusters with several animal Cryptons, and the clustering is
supported by 100% bootstrap value. Cryptons form a
paraphyletic cluster, which indicates that the DUF3504

Figure 5 Schematic structures of DUF3504 proteins. KIAA1958 gene has two isoforms, each of which encodes a DUF3504 domain. The
structures of KCTD1, KIAA1958, QRICH1, ZMYM2, ZMYM3 and ZMYM4 are from humans. The structure of WOC is from Drosophila melanogaster.

domain of KCTD1 was derived from a Crypton YR. The
position of KIAA1958a is distinct from either CryptonA
or CryptonI, and WOC/ZMYM/QRICH1 is clustered as a
sister group of all animal CryptonA elements. Therefore,
phylogeny alone does not support the domestication of
animal Cryptons leading to WOC/ZMYM/QRICH1 and
KIAA1958a.
The DUF3504 domain was derived from YR, not vice
versa, because DUF3504 lacks the complete catalytic tetrad
essential for YR activity. YR is essential for transposition,
and repeated generation of active YRs from defective YRs
is highly improbable. The distributions of WOC/ZMYM/
QRICH1 and KIAA1958a are restricted to bilaterians and
jawed vertebrates, respectively. Apart from Cryptons, the
only other possible sources of YRs in animal genomes are
the retrotransposon families DIRS and Ngaro [23,24].
However, all searches of the YRs from CryptonA-1_OL,
Crypton-1_SP and CryptonA-1_SK matched the DUF3504
sequence with E-values ≤ 8e-12, whereas YRs of DIRS and
Ngaro did not match the DUF3504 sequence at all (even
when the threshold E-value was set at 100). Several representatives of DUF3504 are actually Crypton sequences; for
example, XP_001639277 is the protein coded by Crypton1_NV. The patchy distribution of Cryptons and the inconsistency between Crypton and host phylogenies indicate
ancient amplification and extinction events in Crypton
evolution. The ancient amplifications would have generated many lineages of Cryptons, and it is likely that WOC/
ZMYM/QRICH1 and KIAA1958a derived from lineages of

Cryptons that are now extinct. We cannot completely rule
out the possibility that the two genes and CryptonA elements were independently derived from DIRS-like retrotransposons or some as yet uncharacterized types of
mobile elements, but this implies independent origins of
CryptonA and other Crypton groups (CryptonF, CryptonS
and CryptonI). Therefore, four independent domestication
events of animal Cryptons are the most parsimonious
explanation for the origins of animal DUF3504 genes.
A representative of DUF3504 from Halocynthia roretzi
(BAB40645) has orthologs in other tunicates: Ciona intestinalis (XP_002125964), Ciona savignyi (AACT01002283
and AACT10141791) and Oikopleura dioica (CBY34656).
They could also represent a domestication event of Crypton. Another representative (YP_025778) is coded in the
mitochondrion of the green alga Pseudendoclonium akinetum. It could also be a candidate Crypton-derived gene;
owing to the lack of related sequences, however, we did
not analyze it further.
All DUF3504 genes encode much longer proteins than
their DUF3504 domains, and it is possible that the preexisting genes captured entire Crypton protein-coding
sequences. However, the only recognizable domain
encoded by animal Cryptons is YR (DUF3504), and
there is little sequence similarity beyond YRs among
Cryptons themselves. Therefore, it is unlikely that any
significant sequence similarity was preserved beyond the
DUF3504 domains between the DUF3504 and Crypton
proteins.

Figure 6 Distribution of Cryptons and Crypton-derived genes. Each gene identified in the haploid genome is represented by a plus symbol.
Minus symbols indicate the absence of Cryptons or Crypton-derived genes. Asterisks indicate the presence of their disrupted fragments. The
branch ages are based on TimeTree [30]. The unit of time is indicated. Crypton-derived genes listed at nodes of the tree indicate the times of
their domestication based on their distribution in different species. KIAA1958L, QRICH1, ZMYM2, ZMYM3 and ZMYM4 are not shown, because they
were likely derived by gene duplications.

KCTD1 gene

The KCTD1 gene contains the DUF3504 domain confined within a single exon. Among the vertebrate genes,

the KCTD1 DUF3504 domain is the closest to the Crypton YRs in terms of protein sequence similarity. The
sequence identity between the KCTD1 DUF3504 domain

and the YR of Crypton-1_SP is 32%, which exceeds the
analogous identity among different lineages of Cryptons.
For example, Crypton-1_SP in the CryptonA lineage and
Crypton-1_TC in the CryptonI lineage show less than
30% sequence identity to each other. KCTD1 encodes
two protein isoforms of different lengths. The longer
isoform (isoform b) contains both an N-terminal
DUF3504 domain and a C-terminal BTB/POZ (Broadcomplex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc
finger) domain (Figure 5), whereas the shorter one (isoform a) contains only the BTB/POZ domain. The
shorter isoform is approximately 80% identical to the
KCTD15 gene at the protein level, and related genes are
found in various organisms, including lancelet, sea
urchin and insects (Additional file 6). The KCTD15
gene does not have any DUF3504 domain and is found
in gnathostomes from mammals to chimaera. We infer
that KCTD1 and KCTD15 were duplicated from a single
gene in the early evolution of vertebrates and after that
a Crypton copy was inserted upstream of the KCTD1
gene, which generated a new transcriptional variant
encoding the isoform b. This insertion should have
occurred before the branching of the Chondrichthyes
(sharks, rays, skates and chimaeras) about 527 MYA
[30].
KIAA1958 gene

The KIAA1958 gene, of unknown function, is present in
two isoforms (a and b) which contain different DUF3504
domains encoded by different exons (Figure 5). DUF3504
domains in isoforms a and b are only 26% identical to
each other in the human genome. Although alternative
splicing has not been confirmed experimentally, the high
conservation of both DUF3504-coding sequences indicates that both encode functional proteins (Table 4 and
Additional file 4). Neither of the two DUF3504-coding
sequences is interrupted by introns. We found both isoforms in a wide range of tetrapods (Figure 6). Zebrafish
lacks isoform a, whereas Chondrichthyes (chimaera) lack
isoform b. Some Actinopterygii (medaka, stickleback,
fugu and pufferfish) lack both isoforms. Chicken, zebra
finch and platypus have an additional gene similar to
KIAA1958 isoform b, designated KIAA1958L. The exons
encoding isoform-specific regions of KIAA1958b are
positioned upstream from those of KIAA1958a. The
KIAA1958L gene likely originated from a duplication of
the segment including KIAA1958b-specific exons but not
including KIAA1958a-specific exons, and this duplication
event predated the branching between mammals and
birds. KIAA1958L is less conserved than KIAA1958 isoforms a and b. The DUF3504 domains of KIAA1958L
proteins from platypus and chicken are only 44% identical, whereas those of the KIAA1958b are 97% identical
between the species. KIAA1958a is nonfunctional in

Page 11 of 17

chicken and zebra finch, but it is intact in lizard. Isoform
b was not found in Chondrichthyes, and it is possible
that it originated later in the lineages which branched off
Chondrichthyes. KIAA1958a might have originated in
the common ancestor of gnathostomes. Another possibility is that both isoforms were acquired in the common
ancestor of gnathostomes and isoforms a and b had been
lost in the lineages of Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes,
respectively.
ZMYM2, ZMYM3, ZMYM4 and QRICH1 genes

The ZMYM2, ZMYM3 and ZMYM4 genes are present in
diverse gnathostomes from human to chimaera (Figure 6).
ZMYM2, ZMYM3 and ZMYM4 are similar to arthropod
WOC in terms of their sequence and structure [31,32].
The DUF3504 domains from the Drosophila melanogaster
WOC gene and the human ZMYM2 gene are 41% identical at the protein level. Some introns are also positioned at
the corresponding sites of ZMYM2 and WOC (Figure 7A).
In addition to chordates and arthropods, we found
sequence fragments related to WOC in echinoderms
(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), hemichordates (Saccoglossus kowalevskii), mollusks (Pinctada maxima and Aplysia
californica) and platyhelminthes (Schistosoma mansoni,
S. japonicum and Schmidtea mediterranea) (Additional
file 5). There is no evidence that WOC forms multiple
gene families in invertebrates. The ZMYM2, ZMYM3 and
ZMYM4 genes are listed in the data set of ohnologs
reported recently by Makino and McLysaght [33], which
means that they were duplicated from a single gene during
two rounds of whole-genome duplication in the early evolution of vertebrates before the split between jawed vertebrates and agnathans [34,35]. The synteny blocks of
ZMYM2, ZMYM3 and ZMYM4 share several genes in
addition to ZMYM genes (Figure 7B). The most parsimonious scenario is that the WOC/ZMYM gene family originated from the domestication of Crypton in the common
ancestor of bilaterians.
There are three other ZMYM genes (ZMYM1,
ZMYM5 and ZMYM6) in the synteny blocks (Figure
7B), but they have no DUF3504 domain. The N-terminal part of ZMYM5 is similar to that of ZMYM2,
whereas those of ZMYM1 and ZMYM6 are similar to
that of ZMYM4. These three genes are present only
among eutherian mammals. These data support independent gene duplication events inside each synteny
block. It is noteworthy that the C-terminal parts of
ZMYM1, ZMYM5 and ZMYM6 derived from transposases of hAT-type DNA transposons, but these hATderived sequences are not close to each other. The
C-terminal part of ZMYM6 is close to Charlie elements
in the human genome, whereas that of ZMYM1 is closer
to plant hAT elements such as HAT-1_Mad from apple
(data not shown).

Figure 7 Paralogous relationships of WOC/ZMYM/QRICH1 genes. (A) Two conserved intron positions among WOC, ZMYM2, ZMYM3, ZMYM4
and QRICH1. Introns are printed in lowercase letters and shaded. Protein sequences are shown below nucleotide sequences. The upper and
lower intron positions correspond to the 20th and 22nd introns of human ZMYM2, respectively. (B) The synteny blocks of ZMYM2, ZMYM3 and

gap junction protein a; DLGAP3 = discs large homolog-associated protein 3; C1orf212 = chromosome 1 open reading frame 212. Other gene
names are described in the text.

The QRICH1 gene was found in diverse vertebrates,
including lamprey (Figure 6). The DUF3504 domain in
QRICH1 is quite similar to those of ZMYM2, ZMYM3
and ZMYM4. Besides, five of eight introns of QRICH1
were at the sites corresponding to those of ZMYM2,
ZMYM3 and ZMYM4 (Figure 7A and data not shown).
The high structural and sequence similarity between
WOC, ZMYM2/3/4 and QRICH1 indicates that QRICH1
originated from either WOC or ZMYM genes. In the
neighborhood of QRICH1, we could not find any genes
paralogous to genes in the synteny blocks of ZMYM2,

ZMYM3 and ZMYM4. However, because QRICH1 is
present in the lamprey genome, it must have originated
at the time close to the whole-genome duplication
events.

Discussion
Evolution of WOC: the third-oldest event of transposon
domestication

The most ancient transposon-derived gene known to date
is TERT, which was generated by the domestication of a
Penelope-like retroelement [4], and Prp8, a spliceosomal

Kojima and Jurka Mobile DNA 2011, 2:12
http://www.mobilednajournal.com/content/2/1/12

component derived from a retrointron (group II self-splicing intron) [36]. TERT retains the catalytic activity of RT,
but Prp8 does not. These two genes are shared by almost
all eukaryotes. Another example of an ancient domestication event is the RAG1 gene [5]. It is distributed widely
among gnathostomes, but no RAG1 ortholog was found in
agnathans, including lamprey and hagfish. Given that
agnathans have a different type of adaptive immune system called “variable lymphocyte receptors” [37], the
domestication of RAG1 likely occurred in the last common
ancestor of gnathostomes after their branching from
agnathans. Other transposons domesticated in the distant
past are in HARBI1 and PBDG5 genes, both of which are
present in vertebrates from humans to actinopterygian fish
[38,39]. The KCTD1b, KIAA1958a and KIAA1958b genes
are as old as or older than the HARBI1 and PBDG5 genes
(Figure 6). A transposon-derived CENP-B, a highly conserved mammalian centromere, and three CENP-B-like
proteins (Abp1, Cbh1 and Cbh2) in fission yeast resemble
each other in terms of their sequences and functions, but
they derived independently from different pogo-like transposases [40]. The human genome harbors a significant
number of genes derived from transposons [6]. Some of
them were domesticated in the distant past, and there are
no traces of related repetitive sequences or TEs from
which they were derived. For example, the HARBI1 gene
was derived from PIF/Harbinger and PHSA (THAP
domain-containing protein 9, or THAP9) from a P-like
element [38,41]. Both HARBI1 and PHSA were found by
screening mammalian genes against DNA transposons
from zebrafish. Similarly, the key to our findings of Crypton-derived genes was screening of genes against Cryptons
preserved in medaka, because there are only a few remnants of Cryptons left in vertebrate genomes sequenced to
date, except in medaka.
The ancestral gene for WOC/ZMYM probably originated in the common ancestor of all bilaterians more than
910 MYA [30]. This is the third-oldest transposon domestication event known to date, following the two domestication events of RT [4,36]. Our study indicates that
domestication of Crypton-like elements in eukaryotes was
relatively common in the distant past. This implies that
Cryptons are very ancient and, given their rare occurrence
in the genomic fossil record and their great diversity, they
were probably much more active in the distant past than
in more recent evolutionary history.
Functional implications for domesticated Crypton YRs

No function of DUF3504 domains has been reported to
date. Even so, the YR origin of DUF3504 domains implies
their functions to some extent. YR forms a multimer when
it binds substrate DNA during recombination [42]. On
that basis, we can envision two possible functions derived
from YRs: DNA binding and protein-protein interaction.

Page 13 of 17

There are several indications for functions of domesticated
YRs. First, many genes derived from YRs are transcriptional regulators. Gcr1, KCTD1, WOC, ZMYM2, ZMYM3
ZMYM4, and ATF7IP are either transcriptional activators
or repressors [43-48]. Cbf2 acts as a centromeric protein
directly binding to centromere-specific sequences and is
essential for spindle pole body formation [49,50]. Although
these proteins usually contain a DNA-binding domain
other than DUF3504, exemplified by the GCR1_C domain
of Gcr1 and Cbf2, the DUF3504 domain could also work
as a DNA-binding domain. Second, there is an interesting
resemblance between functions of domesticated DDEtransposases and YRs. Daysleeper is a transcription factor
derived from a hAT DDE-transposase and binds a specific
motif for transcription regulation [12]. CENP-B is a centromere protein derived from the DDE-transposase of a
pogo-like transposon [13]. In these genes, transposasederived domains act as DNA-binding domains. Third, a
large family of prokaryotic transcriptional activators,
AraC/XylS, shows structural similarity to YRs. The overall
fold of the 129-amino acid protein MarA, a member of
the AraC/XylS family, almost entirely recapitulates the YR
domain of Cre recombinase [51]. MarA can simultaneously bind RNA polymerase II and DNA to form a ternary complex [52]. These data support the putative function
of DUF3504 to be DNA or protein binding.
To date relatively little is known about Cryptons. There
have been no studies of their transposition, transcription,
translation or regulation. The sequence similarity between
Cryptons is very low, especially in their non-protein-coding regions. We compared DNA sequences of Cryptons
from different species, but we could not find any conserved nucleotide sequences among them. Furthermore,
all Crypton domestication events are very old. Therefore, it
is very difficult to propose any specific functions of
DUF3504 domains. Instead, herein we propose potential
pathways in which DUF3504 domains could be involved.
KCTD1 and KCTD15 are paralogs that have diverged
during the early evolution of vertebrates (Additional
file 6). KCTD1 isoform b, generated by an insertion of
Crypton upstream of the original KCTD1 gene, is widely
conserved among jawed vertebrates (Figure 6), although it
is unclear whether the agnathans carry the KCTD1b gene.
The high conservation of KCTD1b (Table 4) indicates its
essential function shared among jawed vertebrates.
KCTD1 represses the activity of the AP-2a transcription
factor, and the BTB/POZ domain is responsible for the
interaction [46]. AP-2a plays an essential role in neural
border (NB) and neural crest (NC) formations during
embryonic development [53]. NB is the precursor of NC.
KCTD15 is expressed in NB and inhibits NC induction
[54]. The NC cells are a transient, multipotent, migratory
cell population unique to vertebrates. They give rise to
diverse cell lineages. We can speculate that by adding a

Kojima and Jurka Mobile DNA 2011, 2:12
http://www.mobilednajournal.com/content/2/1/12

new protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction KCTD1b
can contribute to the network of NC formation through
the regulation of AP-2a.
Among DUF3504 genes, the function of WOC/ZMYM is
of special interest because two of the genes in this group,
ZMYM2 and ZMYM3, are linked to human diseases. A
chromosomal translocation between ZMYM2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) causes lymphoblastic lymphoma and a myeloproliferative disorder [55]. A
translocation involving ZMYM3 is associated with
X-linked mental retardation [56]. Mutations of their
ortholog, WOC, cause larval lethality in D. melanogaster
[31].
WOC/ZMYM gene-encoded proteins are involved in
various processes, including transcription, DNA repair and
splicing. WOC is a transcriptional regulator that colocalizes with the initiating forms of RNA polymerase II
[31,32]. The WOC proteins also colocalize with all telomeres, and mutants of WOC are associated with frequent
telomeric fusions [31,32]. ZMYM2, ZMYM3 and ZMYM4
are components of a multiprotein corepressor complex,
including histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2
[47,48]. ZMYM2 binds to various transcriptional regulators including Smad proteins [57]. It also binds to proteins
involved in homologous recombination, such as RAD18,
HHR6A and HHR6B, which are human orthologs of the
yeast RAD proteins [58], and to spliceosomal components
including SFPQ (splicing factor, proline- and glutaminerich) [59].
Interestingly, the SFPQ gene is a component of the syntenic cluster of ZMYM4 (Figure 7B). The paralog of SFPQ
in the cluster of ZMYM3 is NONO (non-POU domaincontaining, octamer-binding), which is a partner of SFPQ
in heteromers [60]. PSPC1 (paraspeckle component 1)
present in the cluster of ZMYM2 also shows similarity to
SFPQ and NONO genes. In addition to their involvement
in splicing, the SFPQ proteins contribute to DNA repair
by interacting with RAD51 [61]. They are also recruiting
HDAC1 to the STAT6 transcription complex [62]. Therefore, it is likely that WOC/ZMYM and SFPQ/NONO/
PSPC1 proteins cooperatively act in transcription regulation, splicing and DNA repair, and that they have coevolved by maintaining their functional relationships. Their
DUF3504 domains may contribute to some of the proteinprotein interactions.

Zygomycota) and two orders of oomycetes (Peronosporales and Saprolegniales). Our phylogenetic analysis supports the horizontal transfer of CryptonF elements
between fungi and oomycetes (Figure 2), which is consistent with frequent horizontal transfer of genes between
them [63]. CryptonS elements are also present in two
oomycete orders and one species of diatoms. Both oomycetes and diatoms are lineages of stramenopiles, and the
origin of CryptonS elements could date back to their
common ancestor.
Animal Cryptons (CryptonA and CryptonI) were found
in six phyla: Chordata, Echinodermata, Hemichordata,
Arthropoda, Mollusca and Cnidaria. CryptonI elements
have the same overall structure as CryptonA elements
and were observed only in insect genomes. It is possible
that CryptonI elements constitute a branch of CryptonA
but they have evolved more rapidly in insects. The overall distribution in fungi, oomycetes and animals indicates that Cryptons were long present in these three
eukaryotic groups, probably with some contribution of a
horizontal transfer. It is likely that Cryptons originated
in the common ancestor of these three groups, although
because of the low resolution of the YR phylogeny, we
cannot rule out the possibility of their independent
origins.
The identification of Crypton elements in medaka is
surprising. The nucleotide diversity of Cryptons in the
medaka genome clearly shows that Cryptons were maintained in the lineage leading to medaka for a long time.
It is possible that Cryptons invaded the medaka population after the split of medaka from the three actinopterygian fish species (Gasterosteus, Takifugu and
Tetraodon), whose genomes have been sequenced. The
vertical transfer of Cryptons in the lineage leading to
medaka is a preferable scenario because of the domestication of Crypton in the common ancestor of bilaterian
animals, which led to the origin of WOC genes. In most
identified host organisms, Cryptons are preserved in
very low copy numbers (Additional file 1). We found
several fragments of Cryptons in various vertebrates,
including zebrafish (Table 3). The origin of Cryptonderived genes took place at different times during the
evolution of vertebrates (Figure 6). This is consistent
with the hypothesis that Cryptons continued to maintain
very low copy numbers in the vertebrate genomes and
were occasionally amplified in certain lineages.

Evolution of Cryptons

To date Cryptons have been identified in a limited number of fungi and animal species. Herein we report the
presence of Cryptons in new species, but information
regarding their overall distribution continues to be patchy (Table 1). CryptonF elements are present in three
phyla of fungi (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and

Conclusions
This study has revealed the diversity of a unique class of
DNA transposons, Cryptons, and their repeated domestication events. The DUF3504 domains are domesticated
YRs of animal Crypton elements. Our findings add a
new repertoire of domesticated proteins and provide

further evidence for an important role of transposable
elements as a reservoir for new cellular functions.

Data source

Genome sequences of various species were obtained
mostly from GenBank, and sequences of known Cryptons, DIRS and Ngaro were obtained from Repbase
http://www.girinst.org/repbase/. All characterized Cryptons have been deposited in Repbase.
Sequence analysis

Characterization of new Cryptons was achieved by
repeated BLAST [64] and CENSOR [65] searches using
genome sequences of various species with Cryptons as
queries. All analyses were done with default settings.
The consensus sequences of elements were derived
using the majority rule applied to the corresponding
sets of multiple aligned copies of Cryptons. Alignment
gaps were manually adjusted to maximize similarity to
other related elements. Characterization of DUF3504
genes was performed by BLAST searches against both
protein and nucleotide databases with known DUF3504
genes as queries. We predicted exon-intron boundaries
with the aid of SoftBerry FGENESH:
http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=fgenesh&group=programs&subgroup=gfind and manually
adjusted them through the comparison to orthologous
sequences in other species.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

We used MAFFT [66] with the linsi option or MUSCLE
[67] with default settings to align both nucleotide and protein sequences of various Cryptons and Crypton-derived
proteins. We constructed maximum likelihood trees by
using PhyML [68,69] with 100 bootstrap replicates [70] for
the amino acid substitution model LG. We also constructed trees with other substitution models, WAG,
RtREV and DCMut, and with the Neighbor-joining
method, but the resolution did not improve. The tree
topology search method was Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI), and the initial tree was BIONJ. The phylogenetic trees were drawn with FigTree 1.3.1 software
