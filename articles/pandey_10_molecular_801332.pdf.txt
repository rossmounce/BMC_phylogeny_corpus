Abstract
Background: Tomato leaf curl viruses, which are the members of the genus Begomovirus, have emerged as
devastating pathogens worldwide causing huge economic losses and threatening production of crops like cassava,
cotton, grain legumes and vegetables. Even though the ToLCV isolates from Northern India have been shown to
possess bipartite genome (designated as DNA A and DNA B), those from Australia, Taiwan and Southern India have
a single genomic component (DNA A). We describe here the genetic diversity of two isolates of monopartite
Tomato leaf curl virus infecting tomato in two extreme regions (North and South) of Indian subcontinent.
Results: The rolling circle amplification (RCA) products obtained from symptomatic samples were digested, cloned
and sequenced. The complete DNA sequence of two Tomato leaf curl virus isolates identified as ToLCV-CTM (India,
New Delhi, 2005) and ToLCVK3/K5 (India, Kerala, 2008) are reported here. These isolates had the characteristic
features of Begomovirus genome organization with six conserved open reading frames (ORFs). The ToLCV-K3 and
ToLCV-K5 isolates may be the strains of the same virus since they show sequence homology of 97% over their
entire genome. This, according to the guidelines established by the ICTV Geminiviridae Study-Group is higher than
threshold (92%) for delineation of different viral variants and hence single, average value has been assigned for all
their analyses presented here. The ToLCV-CTM and ToLCV-K3/K5 viruses were found to be monopartite, as neither
DNA-B component nor betasatellite associated with begomovirus species, were detected. The complete nucleotide
sequence of DNA-A genome of CTM exhibited highest sequence homology (88%) to Croton yellow vein mosaic
virus (AJ507777), and of isolates K3/K5 (88.5%) to Tomato leaf curl Pakistan virus (DQ116884). This is less than the
threshold value for demarcation of species in the genus Begomovirus.
Conclusion: K3/K5 and CTM are considered to be novel isolates of Tomato leaf curl virus. Sequence analyses and
phylogenetic study indicate that these two ToLCV isolates might have evolved by recombination between viruses
related to two or more viral ancestors. The existence of different ToLCV isolates having high genome diversity in
India poses a threat to the tomato production in the Asian continent.

Background
Geminiviruses are plant viruses characterized by twin
icosahedral particles [1]. These viruses are divided into
four genera, viz., Mastrevirus, Curtovirus, Topocuvirus
and Begomovirus, on the basis of the viral vector, genome
organization and host range. Geminiviruses transmitted
by whitefly belong to the genus Begomovirus, have either

bipartite genome (known as DNA-A and DNA-B, both
being ssDNA genomes of approximately 2.7 kb size, and
contain ~ 220 bp Common Region) or a monopartite
genome [2,3]. Monopartite genomes are homologous to
the DNA-A of bipartite geminivirus, and all the viral factors required for viral replication, encapsidation, transmission, and systemic spread are encoded on this
genome component [2]. Monopartite begomoviruses
have also been associated with a novel DNA component,
the DNA b or betasatellite, which is approximately half
the size of the helper virus genomic DNA [4]. Studies

have demonstrated that the cloned monopartite begomoviruses, when inoculated to the susceptible host, give rise
to disease symptoms like those of the field isolates [5].
Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV) is a member of the
family Geminiviridae (Begomovirus genus) and are more
common in tropical and subtropical climates [6,7]. It is
a major causative agent for reduction in tomato production in different parts of the world and may also infect
other Solanaceous species. The affected plants are
severely stunted, leaflets become reduced in size, pucker,
curl upwards, become distorted and have prominent yellow margins. The infection severely affects healthy fruit
formation if it sets in when the plant is young. The
virus is transmitted by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) that
are attracted to young leaves and growing tips.
The discovery of ToLCV in the Indian subcontinent
together with its spread has aggravated the ToLCV
situation. In such context the study of the identity, distribution, molecular variability, and the threat that these
emerging geminiviruses pose to tomato production in
India and more generally in Asia and Africa, has become
very important. The recombination between two species
of geminiviruses was first recorded in 1996 [8,9]. This
mechanism is now known to be widely prevalent in all
geminiviruses and is probably the most important molecular mechanism for generating genetic changes that
allow novel geminiviruses to exploit new ecological
niches [10]. This paper describes the results of a molecular study of the sequences of genomes of different
ToLCV isolates collected from the Indian subcontinent
in an effort towards identifying and determining the
molecular variability of ToLCVs.
In view of evolution of variants of Begomovirus family of
plant viruses, it becomes imperative to characterize the
diseased plants for the identification of isolates causing
infection. Recently, the identification and isolation of
geminiviral genome has become much easier by the use of
Phi-29 polymerase, a DNA polymerase that exponentially
amplifies circular DNA templates by rolling circle amplification (RCA), using picogram amounts of the starting
material [11]. Phi-29 polymerase also possesses proofreading activity and thus ensures high fidelity DNA replication.
In this study, we describe the molecular characterization of two new monopartite Tomato leaf curl virus isolated from symptomatic tomato plants growing in two
different regions of India. Although the symptoms were
severe, we could not detect either DNA-B or betasatellite associated with these new begomovirus species.
A phylogenetic relationship of these isolates was established with other previously characterized begomoviruses, indicating towards the fact that genetic
recombination has probably featured prominently in the
evolution of these viruses.

Results
Identification, detection and molecular characterization
of novel monopartite begomoviruses

Leaves of infected tomato plants were collected from two
different regions of Indian subcontinent and checked for
the presence of the causal agent. The field infected
tomato cv Pusa ruby leaves showing upward leaf curling
(Figure 1A). On the other hand, tomato plants agroinfected with both ToLCNDV 2A and 2B genomes exhibit
severe infection with symptoms of leaf mottling and
yellowing (Figure 1B). Complete nucleotide sequences of
the full length (~2.7 kb) genomes of the two isolates
amplified by the RCA technique were found to be monopartite. The genomes are 2751-2769 nucleotides in length
and are referred to as DNA A since they show maximum
homology to the DNA A of previously characterized
begomoviruses. The viruses were named as ToLCVCTM and ToLCV-K3/K5 and the sequences are submitted to NCBI under accession numbers DQ629102 and
EU910141/EU910140 respectively. We could not detect
the presence of any second genomic component (betasatellite or DNA-B), as revealed by PCR (using the betasatellite DNA specific primers) or the RCA by the phi-29
polymerase technique (Figure 2A, B). Each of the DNA A
sequences contained four complementary sense ORFs
(AC1, AC2, AC3 and AC4) and two virion sense ORFs
(AV1, AV2) and has been represented as a common genome map of the virus (Figure 2C). The degree of relationship of the nucleotide sequence of Intergenic Region (IR)
and the amino acid sequences of the proteins expressed
by the viral genomes of the three ToLCV isolates is illustrated in Table 1. Sequence comparisons of the three
genomes and the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3) showed
that they were more closely related to Old world viruses.

Tomato leaf curl virus and comparison with other
begomoviruses

Figure 2 shows a genomic map for each component,
while Table 1 summarizes the results obtained for the
genomes of both the isolates. ORF-wise amino acid
sequence identity comparison revealed that the genomes
of the viral isolates under study share highest sequence
identity with different begomovirus isolates reported
from the Indian subcontinent and thus indicated the
possibility of recombination. To test for any possible
recombination event, we first constructed a nucleotide
sequence alignment of ToLCV with each of the geminivirus genome sequences used in this study. The pairwise
as well as RDP3 software analyses performed with the
sequences of both the ToLCV Indian isolates indicated
the occurrence of multiple overlapping recombination
events with different parental combinations. The A

components of most of the viruses in South and North
India shared a common backbone from Tomato leaf
curl virus-Bangalore II (ToLCV-BII, Accession number
U38239) (Figure 3, See additional file 1) and have integrated other pieces of DNA that have been proposed to
originate from the other viruses not identified so far.
The Tomato leaf curl virus- New Delhi (ToLCV-CTM)

As depicted in Table 1, the ToLCV-CTM isolate showed
88% homology with Croton yellow vein mosaic virus
(CrYVMV-AJ507777), suggesting it to be a novel strain
of CrYVMV. The virus isolate exhibited a putative
recombination with the viral isolates used in this analysis (See additional file 1), and the result indicates that
Croton yellow vein mosaic virus is the major parent. The
other minor parents appear to be Tomato leaf curl virus
(U38239, ToLCV-BII; EU910140, ToLCV-K3/K5;
DQ852623, ToLCV-KII). In depth analysis identified at
least two significant segments for the CTM isolates,
where the crossover has occurred with the ToLCV-K5
(EU910140; nt 1091-1137, 2643-2692; spanning the AC3
and IR). The other putative crossover events appear to
be with ToLCV-BII (nt 2308-2326; spanning the AC1)
and with ToLCV-KII (nt 2434-2510; spanning the AC1).
Besides this, there were three unknown recombination

sites in the CTM genome. Moreover, the CR IR region
also shows an identity of only 65% to ToLCV-BII and
64% to CrYVMV.
The Tomato leaf curl virus- Kerala (ToLCV-K3/K5)

According to the guidelines established by the ICTV
Geminiviridae Study-Group, two geminivirus sequences
sharing more than 89% identity of their A component
sequences are considered strains or isolates of the same
species. The level of sequence homology (97%) over the
entire genome of ToLCV-K3 and ToLCV-K5 isolates was
observed to be higher than the threshold (92%) for delineation of different viral variants, suggesting that K3 and
K5 may be the different strains of the same virus, and
hence a single, average value has been assigned for all the
subsequent analyses. The full length genomes of K3/K5
virus showed 88.5% homology with Tomato leaf curl
Pakistan virus isolate Rahim Yaar Khan (ToLCPV,
DQ116884), indicating these to be novel isolates of the
genus Geminiviridae. The virus isolate exhibited a putative recombination, and interestingly, CrYVMV
(AJ507777) appears to be a major parent besides
DQ116884, ToLCPV (See additional file 1). The minor
parents appear to be isolates of Tomato leaf curl virus,
viz., U38239 (ToLCV-BII) and DQ852623 (ToLCV-KII).

In depth analysis identified that at the probability of 3.26
X10-74, U38239 ToLCV-BII could be a major parent and
ToLCPV could be a minor parent (nt 24-982, spanning
the AV1 and AV2). As seen from the Additional file 1,
Table S1, one of the important recombination sites lies
in the AC1 region of the genome and the other could
be the IR region. Besides, there was one unknown

recombination site identified for the ToLCV isolate
EU910141. We observed a recombination event with significant probability for AJ507777 and EU910140 indicating that a major portion of EU910140 has been
incorporated into AJ507777 during evolution. Moreover,
the IR of ToLCV-K3/K5 is homologous by only 82% to
that of ToLCPV and 67% to ToLCV-BII.

Phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison with
selected viruses

The CP gene sequences of the two ToLCVs identified in
our study were compared to published sequences (Table 1).
The amino acid sequence of CTM V1 ORF was almost
identical (96%) to that of ToLCV-BII (Figure 3), while the
C1 ORF showed high similarity (86%) to that of CrYVMV.
Likewise, the amino acid sequence of K5/K3 was 95%
homologous to the V1 ORF of ToLCPV and the C1 ORF
exhibited high similarity (95%) to that of ToLCPV and
Euphorbia leaf curl virus -Fujian (FJ487911). The full length
genomes of both the characterized isolates show 77-80%
homology to ToLCV- Ban4 (AF165098) another well characterized monopartite Tomato leaf curl virus [12, data not
shown].
The coat proteins of the isolates under study (K3/K5,
CTM) displayed 79% to 96% homology with other
ToLCV isolates, while that of K3/K5 showed 95% homology with Radish leaf curl virus (EF175733) and contain
two basic domains of KR and KVRRR at the N-terminus.
The pre-coat protein regions had closest homology
(CTM 96% and K3/K5 92%) to that of ToLCV-BII
(U38239) as shown in Table1. The CP gene of whitefly
transmitted geminiviruses typically end with a double
stop codon (TAATAA), the first and the second nucleotides of which are the second and first nucleotides
respectively of the stop codon of the complementary C3

gene [13], as observed in the case of ToLCV-CTS, a previously characterized monopartite Tomato leaf curl virus
(DQ629101; data not shown). However, this overlap is
eliminated and there are separate stop codons for CP and
C3 in the case of isolates K3/K5. This variation does not
lead to any change in the last amino acids (viz., VTN) of
the CP of isolates K3/K5; however, there is a change in
the last three amino acids of CTM (viz., VSN), that is
similar to Pedilnthus leaf curl virus (AM712436).
The C2 protein regions had closest homology (CTM
97%) to the C2 of CrYVMV and (K3/K5 95%) to the C2
of ToLCV- Iran (AY297924) as shown in Table 1. The
alignment of the C2 protein of K3/K5 and CTM with
other begomoviruses revealed that, like that of Tomato
yellow leaf curl virus C2 protein [14], a putative zincfinger motif C36-X1-C38-X7-C46-X6-H53-X4-H58C59
and four potential phosphorylation sites (T52, S61, Y68,
and S74) are present (Figure 2B). The identity of C4
protein of K3/K5 and CTM ranged from 22% to 93%,
having highest homology to ToLCPV isolate for K3/K5
(89.5%), and to CrYVMV isolate for CTM (57%).
The Intergenic Region (IR) sequences

A characteristic feature of genome of whitefly transmitted geminiviruses is the Intergenic Region, or, IR
where, except for the nonanucleotide sequences, the
region is especially prone to variation and provides a

was constructed on the basis of complete genome sequence. Trees were prepared using Treeview programs and are based on 100

sensitive guide to differences between isolates. The IR is
known as CR (Common Region) in the case of bipartite
begomoviruses or monopartite begomoviruses having
betasatellite molecules. When the IR sequence of K3/K5
and CTM isolates was compared and aligned to the
published IR sequences of other Old world geminiviruses from Asia (Table 1), it was apparent that the IR
from ToLCV- K3/K5 and CTM isolates were highly dissimilar to all other ToLCV isolates and other geminiviruses. There are marked differences in both the
sequence and arrangement of Rep-binding sequences
(Iterons) of these viruses (GGTGC/GGTGC for the
CTM isolate, and GGACC/GGTCT for the K3/K5

isolate) as is shown in Figure 4B. The IR region for the
ToLCV-K3 is 100% homologous to the ToLCV-K5 and
exhibit 97% homology with each other on the whole
genome basis (they could be variants of the same strain
since they were isolated at the same time, from the
nearby plants). The sequence and arrangement of IR
and iterons were identical for the K3/K5 isolates showing 91% homology to Whitefly transmitted Indian begomovirus from Parthenium hysterop (DQ339128; data not
shown) and differed from that of CTM isolate (only 64%
homology; Table 1). The IR of CTM isolate displayed
97% homology with Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus
AC1 gene (FN645906; data not shown). The Intergenic

âTAATATTACâ. Blocks of conserved sequences can also
be seen in Figure 3 at the middle and the 3â regions, but
there is a lot of variation in the 5â region to the conserved TATA motif and in the AT rich sequence
between the TATA motif and the nonanucleotide
sequence (Figure 4B).
The evidence that we could find for a recombinant
origin of ToLCVs was that the genome region corresponding to the IR or CR is highly divergent relative to
the analogous genome region in other geminiviruses,
and has potentially been derived through recombination
from either a highly divergent geminivirus lineage or
another source entirely. From the recombination analysis and phylogenetic results, it is clear that these exhibit
multiple putative recombinations between themselves
and also unknown viruses. The A components of all the
viruses in Asian continent share a common backbone
from ToLCV and have integrated other pieces of DNA
that have been said to originate from the other viruses
not identified so far.

Discussion
The molecular characterization of viruses with circular
genome has become very convenient with the use of the
RCA technique, which can detect the presence of DNA
A/B genomes and beta satellites without any prior information about the virus sequence. The present study confirmed the presence of representatives of two distinct

isolates of ToLCV in India, viz., ToLCV-CTM and
ToLCV-K3/K5 that exhibit maximum homology to
CrYVMV and ToLCPV isolates, respectively. Determination of the complete DNA-A nucleotide sequences of
these isolates suggests that the two isolates of ToLCV
from India are about 16% different from each other, while
each of them is more than 12% different from most of the
begomoviruses [15]. It is also worthwhile to note that in
both the cases one of the putative recombination sites is
present in the IR regions of the genomes. The crossover
during recombination might have occurred close to the
conserved stem loop structure of the IR in which the
origin of replication (ori) resides, as the ori has been suggested as the hot spot for recombination in the geminiviruses [16,17]. However, the existence of additional
recombinations can not be ruled out [18,19]. For example,
the IR region of ToLCV-K3/K5 isolates show highest
homology (91%) to Whitefly transmitted Indian begomovirus from Parthenium hysterop (DQ339128) and not with
ToLCV-BII or ToLCV-RYK. Considering the overall
sequence identity of both components and the fact that
sequence differences are scattered all along their genome,
it is possible that the two viral isolates from North and
South India have separated long time ago and are not the
result of a recent introduction in either direction. Recombination events have been shown to be key factors in the
development and spread of ToLCV infections and it has
been suggested that recombination is a significant contributor to geminivirus evolution [20]. Since not much is
known about the root of the geminivirus evolutionary tree,

Pandey et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:337
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/337

it is difficult to determine at this stage which geminivirus
genera share more recent common ancestry.
Under field and glasshouse conditions it was
observed that ToLCV-CTM DNA A alone was sufficient to establish and spread infection in the tomato
plants (Figure 1A). On the other hand, it was noticed
that tomato plants cv Pusa Ruby agroinfiltrated with
ToLCNDV A and B genomes together leads to leaf
mottling and yellowing (Figure 1B). We also observed
that the ToLCV-CTM genome infection specifically led
to upward leaf curling (as shown in Figure 1A) and is
not the result of infection by bipartite geminiviruses. It
is likely that ToLCV-CTM A genome (both in field
and glasshouse) is able to sustain infection. A number
of monopartite begomoviruses have been reported to
be associated with betasatellite molecules, which
depend on the helper virus for their proliferation,
movement and transmission between plants and, in
turn, help the virus accumulation and symptom
expression [4,21]. In this case, we could not detect the
presence of any second genomic component (betasatellite or DNA-B), as revealed by PCR or the RCA by the
phi-29 polymerase technique. The experiments with
previously characterized genomes of monopartite
viruses with no associated betasatellite, indicate that
ToLCV genomes are capable of replication, symptom
development and induction of plant defence response
even in the absence of coat protein [18] and pre-coat
protein [22]. This study reports the presence of new
strains of geminiviruses that infect tomato plants,
which have single genomic component. Clearly, the
transcription of this single component produces all the
gene products required to support a complete cycle of
infection and transmission of the virus.

Conclusion
We have characterized two new Tomato leaf curl viruses
(ToLCV-CTM and ToLCVK3/K5) with single genomic
component and demonstrated the association of these
isolates with the symptomatic tomato leaf curl samples
obtained from two geographically distant niches of
Indian subcontinent. Through the evaluation of the
genetic variation of these ToLCV isolates from India, we
found that there is uneven nucleotide variation along
the genome and the region corresponding to the IRs is
highly divergent relative to the analogous genome region
in other geminiviruses. It is clear from the sequence
analysis and phylogenetic results that the genomes of
these isolates exhibit multiple putative recombination
events between themselves and have integrated other
pieces of DNA that have been presumably originated
from the other viruses not identified so far. This study
also demonstrates the wide sequence variability amongst
ToLCV isolates from India. There is an urgent need for

more information in order to develop effective and sustainable approaches to manage the diseases caused by
these plant pathogens.

Methods
Provenance of the virus material and genomic DNA
extraction

More than 80% of the tomato plants in the fields
showed severe ToLCV symptoms with tomato in the
ToLCV-CTM samples obtained from the central region
of New Delhi, India in the middle of February 2006 and
from the fields of Kerala (a southern state of India) in
April 2008. Due to the association of whiteflies with the
plants, begomovirus infection was suspected to cause
the disease in the samples. Tomato plants exhibiting
stunted growth, severe leaf curling, reduced leaf size and
distortion of leaf lamina symptoms associated with
ToLCV infection were selected for sampling. Symptoms
of infected tomato samples collected in the field were
reproduced under glasshouse conditions to examine
symptom variability. Three weeks old healthy tomato
seedlings were grown along with the infected tomato
plants harboring whiteflies that were chosen for sampling. In all the cases, the symptoms expressed in the
field were reproduced in the growth chamber and plants
failed to recover from the disease even after 6 months
of infection. Total DNA from infected leaves was
extracted following the standard CTAB protocol [23].
Rolling circle amplification and cloning of full length viral
genome

The coat protein fragment was detected from infected,
symptomatic samples using the BGCPF (5â-TGTGARGGYCCWTGYAARGTYCA-3â) and BGCPR (5â-TASARGCATGWGTACANGCCATATAC-3â) primers. The
rolling circle amplification (RCA) was performed for the
samples ToLCV-K3/K5 and ToLCV-CTM using the
TempliPhi 100 Amplification kit (Amersham Biosciences,
USA) following the manufacturerâs instruction. The RCA
products were digested with BamH I enzyme (New England Biolabs) for ToLCV-K3/K5 and ToLCV-CTM
respectively to get a band of an approximate 2.7 kb size
for cloning into a suitable vector. The digested products
were checked on 1.2% agarose gel run at 60 Volts to
separate the DNA A and DNA B genomes (if present).
These were cloned in cloning vector pCAMBIA1391Z
and sequenced.
Identification of genes, Sequence analysis and
phylogenetic study

Three replicate clones from the PCR products were
sequenced to minimize any error. Sequence data of all
the components obtained were compared with other
reported isolates of Tomato leaf curl virus from Indian

Pandey et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:337

subcontinent as well as with those reported from other
parts of the world. All the open reading frames (ORFs)
that could potentially express proteins were used in protein-protein BLAST (BLASTp) [24] searches to identify
potential homologues of these in the NCBI non-redundant protein sequences database and a nested search
strategy to restrict the search to geminivirus protein
sequences. Nucleotide/amino acid sequence similarities
were carried out with isolates reported for each component from various begomovirus isolates (Table 1) using
Clustal W (Version 1.82) [25] and Bio-Edit (Version
7.0.0) softwares. The phylogenetic trees were constructed from the multiple alignments by the neighbourjoining majority rule consensus. The degrees of similarity shared by full-length genome sequences of various
representative geminiviruses (see Table 1) were graphically depicted using a neighbour joining tree (1000 bootstrap replicates). Using RDP3 software http://darwin.
uvigo.es/rdp/rdp.html, we performed analysis of various
DNA-A sequences for the identification of potential
recombinants, parental sequences, and approximation of
possible recombination breakpoint positions. The pairwise comparison of sequences was carried out between
sequences of different species and of different isolates
and an average profile for the considered cluster of
viruses was calculated for these two categories taking
100 nt along the genome sequence. The analyses were
performed with default settings for the detection methods, a Bonferroni-corrected p-value cutoff of 0.05. The
approximate breakpoint positions and recombinant
sequence(s) inferred for every detected potential recombination event were manually checked and adjusted
where necessary using the extensive phylogenetic and
recombination signal analysis features available in RDP3.
Once a set of unique recombination events was identified, a breakpoint map containing the positions of all
clearly identifiable breakpoints was compiled. The
sequences used for the analysis include EU910140,
AJ507777, U38239, DQ116884 and DQ852623.
