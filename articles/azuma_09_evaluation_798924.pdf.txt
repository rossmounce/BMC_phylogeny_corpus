Abstract
Background: Both computational and experimental approaches have been used to determine the
minimal gene set required to sustain a bacterial cell. Such studies have provided clues to the minimal
cellular-function set needed for life. We evaluate a minimal cellular-function set directly, instead of
a geneset.
Results: We estimated the essentialities of KEGG pathway maps as the entities of cellular
functions, based on comparative genomics and metabolic network analyses. The former examined
the evolutionary conservation of each pathway map by homology searches, and detected
"conserved pathway maps". The latter identified "organism-specific pathway maps" that supply
compounds required for the conserved pathway maps. We defined both pathway maps as
"autonomous pathway maps". Among the set of autonomous pathway maps, the one that could
synthesize all of the biomass components (the essential constituents for the cellular component of
Escherichia coli/Bacillus subtilis), and that was composed of a minimal number of pathway maps,
was determined for each of E. coli and B. subtilis, as "minimal pathway maps". We consider that
they correspond to a minimal cellular-function set. The network of minimal pathway maps,
composed of 20 conserved pathway maps and 21 organism-specific pathway maps for E. coli, starts
a sequence of catabolic processes from carbohydrate metabolism. The catabolized compounds are
used for anabolism, thus creating materials for cell components and for genetic information
processing.
Conclusion: Our analyses of these pathway maps revealed that those functioning in "genetic
information processing" are likely to be conserved, but those for catabolism are not, reflecting an
evolutionary aspect of cellular functions. Minimal pathway maps were compared with a systematic
gene knockout experiment, other computational results and parasitic genomes, and showed
qualitative agreement, with some reasonable exceptions due to the experimental conditions or
differences of computational methods. Our method provides an alternative way to explore the
minimal cellular function set.

Background
Advances in sequencing technology have allowed the
complete genome sequences of more than 750 prokaryo-

tes and 20 eukaryotes to be determined thus far. One of
the possible subjects to be solved using this advance of
data is the identification of a minimal gene set i.e. an esti-

mation of the genes that are necessary and sufficient for
sustaining a functional cell under certain conditions [1].
This type of research has attracted a lot of attention, not
only for its scientific meaning, but also for its industrial
applications. Both computational and experimental
approaches have been employed to estimate minimal
gene sets.
In the computational approach, it is assumed that the
genes shared by distantly related organisms are likely to be
essential, and that a catalogue of these genes might comprise a minimal gene set for cellular life [1]. Soon after the
two first bacterial genomes from Haemophilus influenzae
[2] and Mycoplasma genitalium [3] were sequenced, Mushegian and Koonin compared them and proposed 256
genes as a close estimate of a minimal gene set [4]. After
this pioneering work, many computational analyses were
performed [5-14]. In general, computational analysis is
likely to underestimate a minimal gene set, because it considers only orthologous genes. By contrast, for a substantial number of essential functions, non-orthologous, and
in some cases non-homologous, genes play the same role
in different organisms. The existence of two or more distinct (distantly related or non-homologous) sets of genes
that are responsible for the same function in different
organisms is called non-orthologous gene displacement
(NOGD). Wider genome comparisons have revealed that
NOGD even occurs with essential genes, including the
central components of the translation, transcription and,
especially, replication machineries [1].
In the experimental approach, the essential genes that are
indispensable for cell growth are determined by largescale gene disruption, and they are considered to comprise a minimal gene set. The first experimental attempt
along this line was performed by Itaya, before the advent
of comparative genomics [15]. He investigated 79 random
gene-knockouts in Bacillus subtilis, and found that six of
them were lethal. Based on this ratio, he estimated the
minimal genome size could be 318~562 kbp (270~470
genes, if one protein is 400 aa long). Many subsequent
experimental reports utilized individual knockouts [1618], RNA interference [19], transposon mutagenesis [2025], antisense RNA [26,27] and high-throughput gene disruption [28]. Because a gene-knockout may just retard cell
growth, the numbers of essential genes tend to be overestimated. In contrast, individual gene-knockout studies
might underestimate the number of a minimal gene set
for a metabolic system, because simultaneous gene knockouts tend to be lethal [12]. In addition, the estimation of
essential genes depends on the experimental conditions,
such as nutrients contained in culture media.
Considering these difficulties in detecting a minimal gene
set by both the computational and experimental

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/111

approaches, we adopted a different strategy. Instead of a
minimal gene set, we computationally explored a minimal cellular-function set. The cellular functions are functional modules composed of a group of genes, for
example, glycolysis, TCA cycle and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. Since one of the final aims of minimal gene set
determination is to reveal the functional components of a
living cell, and these components are sometimes debated
in terms of the combination of the cellular functions,
detection of the minimal cellular-function set is a more
direct method. In addition, this approach is more robust,
because the acceptance of a given cellular function could
be possible regardless of NOGD (see Methods). In this
work, we regard the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes) pathway maps as the entities of the cellular
functions. The KEGG database classifies the genes of
sequenced genomes into more than 100 functional modules, named pathway maps, in which the reactions, substrates and products of the corresponding genes (proteins)
are shown. Based on this information, not only the network of genes and compounds, but also the network of
pathway maps (cellular-functions) can be illustrated.

Methods
Outline
Figure 1 shows the schematic procedure for determining a
pathway map set. It is divided into three parts. In the first
part, the conserved pathway maps among many genomes
are determined, based on the comparative genomics. In
the second part, by checking the compounds imported to
and synthesized in the conserved pathway maps, an initial
pathway-map network is obtained. Finally, the pathway
maps that provide the necessary compounds for the conserved pathway maps are connected to the pathway-map
network, until there are no more suitable pathway maps
to be added. We regard the final pathway-map network as
a candidate for the minimal pathway map (cellular-function) set, and assessed them in terms of biomass production and the number of components (explained later).
Representative genomes and orthologous genes
As of December 2008, more than 700 bacterial genomes
have been completely sequenced. We divided them into
three lineages: proteobacteria, firmicutes, and others, with
reference to the classical phylogenetic classification (data
from KEGG). We selected 10 representative genomes from
each lineage, taking the genome size, the phylogenetic distance, and the annotation availability into account (see
the Legend of Additional file 1: Table S1 for detail). Thus
there are three lineages, each composed of 10 genomes, in
the total of 30 genomes (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Within a given triplet composed of three genomes, one
from each lineage, exhaustive homology searches were
performed. Conserved orthologous genes among the
three genomes [29] were detected by the bidirectional

Ortholog fraction
The KEGG database provides classifications of functionally identified genes of available genomes and presents
them as more than 100 functional modules, "reference
pathway maps". For each reference pathway map, the customized pathway map for each genome (organism) was
constructed by highlighting the genes assigned to the
pathway map. We evaluated the evolutionary conservation of each pathway map, based on the conserved orthologous genes derived as above. For the KEGG pathway
maps of a given genome in a triplet, all of the conserved
orthologous genes were assigned. Since the total number
of genes assigned to a pathway map depends on the
genome (organism), we defined the ortholog fraction
(OF) of pathway map i as,

where Ni, orth is the number of orthologous genes detected
in pathway map i using a given triplet, and Nai, min is the
minimum total-number of genes appearing in pathway
map i of the three genomes. OFi was averaged over 1,000
triplets. The pathway maps with high OF values are considered to be the "conserved pathway maps", and they will
be the "core" of a minimal cellular-function set. Referring
to the descending order of OF values, we chose γ pathway
maps and classified them as the conserved pathway
mapsγ.

Reconstruction of the metabolic network in a pathway
map
A metabolic network within each pathway map was
reconstructed, based on the enzymatic reactions of a particular organism provided by the KEGG API service and
the reaction_mapformula.lst file on the KEGG FTP site,
where the substrates and the products for all reactions in
a pathway map are described, mainly as a binary relation
(Figure 2a). We used Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus
subtilis (B. subtilis) as the model organisms in this work,
because there are many experimental and computational
data that can be compared. In the network reconstruction
process, we regarded the same compounds as one node,
and a substrate-product relation as an edge. Therefore a set
of reactions in a pathway map was transformed into a
unique network (Figure 2b). The reversibility or irreversibility
assigned
to
each
reaction
in
the
reaction_mapformula.lst file indicates the stream of compounds in the reconstructed network. We regarded compounds at the upstream termini as the initial substrates

(circles in Figure 2b), and all the compounds in the network as products of the pathway map. When a network
terminus consists of many initial compounds that are
connected by reversible reactions, either one of them can
be the initial substrate at the terminus (Figure 2c). We
assumed that if all the initial substrates of a pathway map
were provided, then all of the reactions would take place
there, and all products in the pathway map synthesized.
Cofactors were taken into account only if they were
described in the chemical reactions as substrates or products. Because such cases are unlikely to be common, cofactors were implicitly assumed to be abundant in the cell,
and used if they were required. When a compound is only
produced or only consumed in the pathway map, a gap
(dead end) exists. At this stage we did not take into
account the dead end of the pathway maps. The only-produced compounds are the downstream termini of the network, and the only-consumed compounds are the initial
substrates. When the chemical reactions are presented in
the indescribable form by the binary relation as, A + B →
C + D, both A and B should be the substrates for each of
C and D. The network in this case is shown in Figure 2d.
Construction of the pathway-map network
We randomly selected an initial substrate (in the above
case, exceptionally, both A and B) in a pathway map, and
tried to connect it to the same compound in another pathway map, regardless of the dead end material. If it was
possible, two pathway maps were linked with a directed
edge, and a new large network with a new set of initial

substrates and products was created. Repeating this procedure for all conserved pathway mapsγ, an initial pathwaymap network was constructed. It should be noted that the
initial substrates and network configuration of the initial
pathway-map network depended on the order of selection
of the initial substrate and the product being connected.
In our method, the only-consumed dead end compounds
were supplied from the other pathway maps, and the
only-produced dead end compounds were assumed to be
initial substrates for the other pathway maps or removed
by virtual transporters.
Extension of the pathway-map network
A pathway map that can provide the initial substrates of
the pathway-map network was chosen randomly from
those other than the components of the pathway-map
network, and was connected into the pathway-map network to create a new one. In this process, only a part of the
pathway map, i.e., minimal sequential chemical reactions
necessary to synthesize the initial substrate, was connected, so that the extra reactions for the initial-pathway
map network were excluded. Since the added pathway
maps are non-conserved and depend on the organism, we
called them the organism-specific pathway maps. Referring to each of the E. coli and the B. subtilis pathway maps,
this selection and connection process was repeated until
there were no more pathway maps to be connected. The
resultant network defined the network of "autonomous
pathway maps", because it was expected to synthesize
most of the necessary compounds inside the network. The
initial substrates of the autonomous pathway maps were
defined as nutrients imported from the extracellular environment. We generated 10,000 autonomous pathway
maps from the initial pathway-map construction process
using different random seeds. As the autonomous pathway-map network depends on the γ parameter (the
number of conserved pathway maps), we started from the
conserved pathway mapsγ and constructed 10,000 patterns of the autonomous pathway mapsγ, at each γ.
Estimation of minimal pathway maps
We assumed the autonomous pathway maps have to synthesize at least indispensable compounds for the organism by themselves. The attained autonomous pathway
maps were assessed to determine whether they satisfied
this condition. As the indispensable compounds, we
employed the biomass components estimated by Feist et
al. for E. coli [31] and by Oh et al. for B. subtilis [32], the
numbers of which are 61 and 64, respectively. The biomass components are the major and essential constituents
that make up the cellular content of organisms. For E. coli,
they were determined quantitatively using the dry weight
composition data for an average E. coli B/r cell, which
grew exponentially at 37°C under aerobic conditions in a
glucose minimal medium [31]. Among the set of autono-

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:111

mous pathway maps, the one that could synthesize all of
the biomass components was selected, and denoted as the
"autonomous pathway maps*". Minimal pathway maps
were decided as the autonomous pathway maps* composed of a minimal number of pathway maps.

Results and discussion
Pathway maps with high ortholog fractions
The ortholog fraction was calculated for each pathway
map (see Table 1). It revealed that the pathway maps classified as "genetic information processing", i.e., "ribosome",
"aminoacyl-tRNA
biosynthesis",
"RNA
polymerase" and "protein export", have high OF values
(Table 1. Also refer to the classification columns in Table
2). "DNA polymerase" is also involved in "genetic information processing", but its OF value is lower than the others. This pathway map includes DNA polymerases I-V and
DNA polymerase bacteriophage-type. The genes encoding
them, except for DNA polymerase III, are not well conserved. The most conserved pathway map is "riboflavin
metabolism", which is a member of the "cofactors and
vitamins" category. The other members belonging to this
class, i.e., "one carbon pool by folate", "pantothenate and
CoA biosynthesis" and "porphyrin and chlorophyll
metabolism", also have high OF values. This may reflect
the importance of these compounds because cofactors
and vitamins are involved in many kinds of reactions.
Decision of minimal pathway maps
We defined γ pathway maps in the descending order of
OFs as the conserved pathway mapsγ. Starting from the
conserved pathway mapsγ, 10,000 sets of organism-specific pathway mapsγ were determined by expanding the
pathway-map networks described in the Methods. The
autonomous pathway mapsγ of E. coli and B. subtilis, at
each γ, consisted of the conserved pathway mapsγ and the
organism-specific pathway mapsγ. These sets of autonomous pathway mapsγ were, in turn, used to determine the
minimal pathway maps. Initially, the autonomous pathway mapsγ that could synthesize all the biomass components were selected (i.e., the autonomous pathway mapsγ
*). In Figure 3 the least number of the autonomous pathway mapsγ * at each γ is plotted against the number of the
conserved maps, γ. The least numbers of autonomous
pathway mapsγ * are at a minimum when γ s are 20 (E.
coli) and 25 (B. subtilis). Therefore, minimal pathway
maps for E. coli and B. subtilis were determined from the
autonomous pathway maps20 * and the autonomous
pathway maps25 *, respectively, as those composed of the
minimal number of the pathway maps.

In Figure 3, the least number of the autonomous pathway
mapsγ * for B. subtilis only increases gradually. This indicates that the first time for the autonomous pathway maps
to synthesize all the biomass components is at γ = 25.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/111

Note that synthesizing all the biomass components is easy
if the total number of autonomous pathway maps is large,
because the larger the total number is, the greater the
products. By contrast, if the initial conserved pathway
maps to be extended are not appropriately prepared, the
extension process will be terminated before the pathway
map network develops. Thus, the conserved pathway
maps25 of B. subtilis provide a good starting point so that
the resultant autonomous pathway maps can synthesize
all the biomass components. In the case of E. coli, the
autonomous pathway mapsγ are able to synthesize all the
biomass components at γ = 10, but the least number of the
autonomous pathway mapsγ * decreases by the increment
of γ, and reaches a minimum value at γ = 20. After that, it
increases as in B. subtilis. It also indicates that the conserved pathway maps20 of E. coli provide a good starting
point to be the autonomous pathway maps*, composed
of a necessary and sufficient number of the pathway maps.
Conserved pathway maps
The components of minimal pathway maps for each of
the organisms are shown in Table 2. The conserved pathway maps are denoted as "C" (Conserved) in the "MPM"
(Minimum Pathway Maps) columns in Table 2. In the left
column of the Table, the KEGG classifications of the pathway maps are also indicated. The conserved pathway
maps of both organisms contain those classified as "carbohydrate", "lipid", "nucleotide", "amino acid", "glycan",
"cofactors and vitamins" and "genetic information
processing". They do not, however, include any pathway
maps classified as "energy", "other amino acids",
"polyketides and nonribosomal peptides", "secondary
metabolites", "xenobiotics", "environmental information
processing" and "cellular processes".
Organism-specific pathway maps
The organism-specific pathway maps in the minimal
pathway maps are denoted as "OS" (Organism Specific)
in the "MPM" columns in Table 2. In the "carbohydrate"
category, "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis", "citrate cycle (TCA
cycle)" and "pentose phosphate pathway" were selected. It
is also notable that in the "amino acid" category, the components of minimal pathway maps are identical in E. coli
and B. subtilis, whereby in B. subtilis, "alanine and aspartate metabolism" and "arginine and proline metabolism"
were identified as the conserved pathway maps, whereas
they were chosen as the organism-specific pathway maps
in E. coli. This indicates that even though their degrees of
conservation are marginal, they are necessary to constitute
the minimal pathway maps. In the "other amino acids"
category, β-amino acid (only in E. coli) and D-amino acid
metabolisms were required for the minimal pathway
maps. In addition, the pathway maps in the "energy",
"lipid", "cofactors and vitamins" and "secondary metabolites" (only in B. subtilis) categories were also selected. In

as the conserved pathway map. This result means that
catabolism is essential for cellular life, but is not conserved throughout the bacterial genomes, probably
because bacteria have evolved to adapt to a variety of environments. During the evolutionary process, bacteria that
succeeded in obtaining or adjusting genes to effectively
utilize the nutrients around them could survive. Consequently, their catabolic pathway maps have diverged.

maps20 * in E. coli and 3,391 sets of autonomous pathway
maps25 * in B. subtilis ("%" columns in Table 2). The discrepancy in the total number of the autonomous pathway
maps* for each organism is due to the difference in the
total number of conserved pathway maps. It is difficult to
obtain autonomous pathway maps* using a small
number of conserved pathway maps. Most organism-specific pathway maps in the minimal pathway maps are
adopted almost always in the autonomous pathway
maps*. For example, the organism-specific pathway maps
in the "amino acid" category, all appear with more than,
or nearly equal to, 90%. By contrast, some examples show
the participation in the minimal pathway maps and the
percentage of appearance in the autonomous pathway
maps* are not necessarily mutually related: some participants in the minimal pathway maps, e.g., "citrate cycle
(TCA cycle)", are not frequently accepted in the autonomous pathway maps*, whereas the other pathway maps,
e.g., "methane metabolism" in E. coli, are accepted with a

very high ratio, but do not participate in the minimal
pathway maps. This is partly explained by the number of
products and initial substrates for the pathway map.
When a pathway map includes several products that can
be the initial substrates of the pathway-map network, this
pathway map will be frequently accepted at the "extension
of the pathway-map network" process. However, if the
newly connected pathway map requires many kinds of
initial substrates, the extended pathway-map network
needs many additional pathway maps that will supply the
initial substrates. Consequently, the resultant autonomous pathway maps* cannot be minimal pathway maps.
We found that the "reductive carboxylate cycle (CO2 fixation)" is almost equivalent (reverse reaction) to the "citrate cycle (TCA cycle)" from the viewpoint of logistics of
compounds, and they were alternatively selected in many
cases (the sum of their percentages of appearance is
around 100%). But, there are dead ends in "reductive carboxylate cycle (CO2 fixation)" (at least ATP citrate syn-

Network of minimal pathway maps for E. coli
Network of minimal pathway maps for E. coli. The box and ellipse nodes represent the conserved pathway maps20 and
the organism-specific pathway maps20, respectively. The colors indicate the category of the pathway maps in the KEGG database (see Table 2). Orange, "carbohydrate"; brown, "energy"; blue, "lipid"; purple, "nucleotide"; red, "amino acid"; magenta,
"other amino acids"; sky-blue, "glycan"; green, "cofactors and vitamins" and yellow, "genetic information processing". The notes
in the boxes are abbreviations for the pathway maps, using a few words from the long descriptions in Table 2. Note that the
amino acids (colored red and magenta) are denoted by three letter codes. A directed edge indicates the flow of one compound. The blue directed edges entering the central cell from the environment indicate the imports of nutrients. The
exchanged compounds between pathway maps and the nutrients imported from extracellular environment are listed in Additional file 2: Table S3.

thase and 2-oxoglutarate synthase are missing in E. coli).
Subsequently, this pathway map requires more initial
substrates than the "citrate cycle (TCA cycle)". Furthermore, we noticed that 64 pathway maps (excluding the
conserved pathway maps) appeared at least once for the
autonomous pathway maps20 * in E. coli (Table 2). Considering that the number of the organism-specific pathway maps in the minimal pathway maps is 21, only one
third (21/64) can be the components of the minimal
pathway maps. This ratio is almost the same for B. subtilis
(16/52). These results indicate that there are many possibilities to synthesize the biomass components from extracellular nutrients, i.e., many solutions to realize the
autonomous pathway maps*, if the total number of the
pathway maps is unlimited.

Network of minimal pathway maps
The network of minimal pathway maps of E. coli is shown
in Figure 4. The compounds exchanged between pathway
maps, and nutrients imported from the extracellular environment are listed in Additional file 2: Table S3. The network starts from pathway maps mostly in the
"carbohydrate" (orange nodes) and "energy" (brown
nodes) categories that function in catabolism. "Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis", "pentose phosphate pathway" and
"propanoate metabolism" catabolize imported nutrients
into products and provide them as the initial substrates
for "citrate cycle (TCA cycle)", "carbon fixation" and "C5Branched dibasic acid metabolism", and further catabolism occurs there. Subsequently, the products are used for
anabolism. Most pathway maps of the "amino acid" cate-

gory (red nodes) utilize products of pathway maps in the
"carbohydrate" or "energy" category, but a few of them
utilize products of pathway maps in the "nucleotide"
(purple nodes), "other amino acids" (magenta nodes) or
"genetic information processing" (yellow nodes) category. Around one of the termini of the network, "aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis" (yellow rectangle) exists. Most of
the amino acids fed into this pathway map are synthesized by the pathway maps in the "amino acid" category.
However, glycine and cysteine are provided from "glutathione metabolism", glutamine is from "nitrogen metabolism" and glutamate is from "D-glutamine and Dglutamate metabolism". This is due to the overlaps of
pathway maps, that is, some of the amino acids synthetic
reactions occur in pathway maps that are not classified as
"amino acid". Note that the number of substrates into
"aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis" is 21. This is because
"aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis" synthesizes not only 20
aminoacyl-tRNAs, but also N-formylmethionyl-tRNA
using 10-formyl-THF. Most pathway maps belonging to
the "lipid" (blue nodes) or "cofactors and vitamins"
(green nodes) category are closely connected in the network. All the pathway maps are connected into one network, except four pathway maps belonging to the "genetic
information processing" category. Because any reactions
are not described in the reaction_mapformula.lst file for
them, they cannot have any links to the other pathway
maps via the substrates and products. This overall compound-flow looks reasonable for an ideal metabolism of
a living cell.
Comparison with experimental data
We compared minimal pathway maps of E. coli with the
data on the "Profiling of E. coli Chromosome" (PEC) database that presents 302 essential genes [33]. Also minimal
pathway maps of B. subtilis were compared with the result
of a systematic gene knockout experiment of B. subtilis
that detected 271 essential genes [16]. We defined the

"experimentally-derived essential pathway maps" as those
including at least two essential genes. The threshold "two"
was selected, because using this value, we could define a
comparable number of "experimentally-derived essential
pathway maps" to compare them with the minimal pathway maps. It should be noted that approximately half of
the genes coded in the E. coli genome are multiply
assigned to more than or equal to two pathway maps.
Therefore, the pathway map that includes at least one
essential gene does not necessarily represent the experimentally-derived essential pathway map. We also
employed the definition by which we could achieve the
highest correlation between our results and the experimental results. If both results were different, there would
be no mutual relation, even though we employed a biased
threshold. We discuss other definitions in the "Remarkable features of network construction" section.
Among 114 pathway maps presented in the KEGG database, 38 were determined to be experimentally essential
for E. coli. Among those, 30 are in common with minimal
pathway maps in E. coli. Also 37 were determined to be
experimentally essential for B. subtilis. They include 27
pathway maps that are in common with the minimal
pathway maps of B. subtilis (see the pathway maps marked
by "C" or "OS" in the "MPM" columns and "X" in the
"Exp" columns in Table 2). We calculated the Jaccard coefficients between our results and experimental results (the
number of pathway maps in both results/the number of
pathway maps appeared in either or both) for every minor
classification of metabolism in Table 2, and summarized
them in Table 3. In E. coli, the "carbohydrate", "nucleotide", "amino acid", "glycan" and "cofactors and vitamins" categories are very consistent (the Jaccard
coefficients ≥ 0.5), but "energy", "lipid", "other amino
acids" and "secondary metabolites" are less consistent (<
0.5). The Jaccard coefficients for whole pathway maps (all
categories) are 0.61 for E. coli and 0.53 for B. subtilis ("All"

row in Table 3). Some of the discrepancies are due to the
experimental environment. The inactivation experiments
were carried out with a rich medium. When we derived
minimal pathway maps, however, the initial substrates
were the materials that cannot be synthesized in any pathway map. Catabolism ("carbohydrate" and "energy" categories) and "cofactors and vitamins" categories are
considered to be strongly affected by nutrient composition. In the experiment, some cofactors, e.g., folate and
pho-CoA, might be transported from the medium into the
cell [16] and thus they do not need to be synthesized,
while we required minimal pathway maps to synthesize as
many requisite compounds as possible. The very high
consistencies seen in the "amino acid" and "nucleotide"
categories might show that in the experiments, amino
acids and nucleotides were provided in the LB medium,
but not abundantly [16].
Comparison with computational data
The results of computational studies, the persistent genes
of E. coli and the functional genomic core of B. subtilis,
were compared with our results. The former results are the
orthologous genes conserved in most of 228 bacterial
genomes [14] and the latter results are the genes adopting
highly biased codon usage[11]. These two data sets were
selected from many studies on the minimal gene sets,
because they are based on E. coli and B. subtilis genomes,
anonymously accessible, and easy to convert from original ID to the KEGG ID. The "computationally-derived
essential pathway maps" were assigned by the same process described in the "comparison with experimental data"
section, but we used thresholds 3 and 1 for E. coli and B.
subtilis, respectively, because these values were appropriate to identify a comparable number of computationallyderived essential pathway maps, so that we compared
them with the minimal pathway maps.

42 and 46 computationally-derived essential pathway
maps were defined for E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively.
Among them, 31 and 27 were in common with the minimal pathway maps of E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively.
The good consistency observed in E. coli (the Jaccard coefficient, 0.60 in total. See Table 3) could be due to the similarity of methodologies that detect minimal pathway
maps and persistent genes. Both methods relied on the
conservation of genes among many bacterial genomes.
The lower consistency in B. subtilis (0.45) might be
explained as follows. We noticed that the computationally-derived essential pathway maps for B. subtilis were
abundant in catabolism ("carbohydrate" and "energy"
categories). Such pathway maps occupy 35% of all computationally-derived essential pathway maps. On the
other hand, the occupancies of pathway maps of catabolism in our results and in the experimental results, are
only 17% and 22%, respectively. This is probably because

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/111

the genes used in catabolism are likely to be under codon
usage, to be expressed abundantly and ubiquitously, so
that the bacteria adapt a specific environment in which
they should survive.
Comparison with parasitic genomes
Buchnera aphidicola (B. aphidicola) strains (APS, Sg, Bp, Cc,
5A and Tuc7) and Wigglesworthia glossinidia (W. glossinidia) are parasitic organisms and phylogenetically close
to E. coli [34]. We compared the minimal pathway maps
of E. coli with their genomes. The pathway maps that the
genomes hold were taken from the KEGG database. In
Table 2, the pathway maps of B. aphidicola APS are shown
in the "Par" (Parasite) column. Against these data, the Jaccard coefficients of minimal pathway maps of E. coli are
calculated and shown in the "Parasite" column in Table 3.

In the "carbohydrate" and "lipid" categories, the coefficients were lower than those against the experimental and
the computational results, but in the "energy" and "other
amino acids" categories, the coefficients were higher than
those against the experimental and the computational
results. The total Jaccard coefficients against the data of B.
aphidicola APS, Sg, Bp, Cc, 5A, Tuc7 and W. glossinidia, were
0.59, 0.59, 0.59, 0.56, 0.59, 0.60 and 0.52, respectively,
indicating minimal pathway maps show better consistency with the data of B. aphidicola strains than with the
data of W. glossinidia. The minimal pathway maps were
also compared with the KEGG pathway maps of Mycoplasma genitalium. This organism is not a close relative of
E. coli. The Jaccard coefficient was 0.49 in total.
The high Jaccard coefficients between the minimal pathway maps of E. coli and the pathway maps of several parasitic genomes imply that the minimal cellular functions
are represented in the minimal pathway maps of E. coli.
Also the slight differences seen in the Jaccard coefficients
may reflect the phylogenetic distances between E. coli and
the parasites.
Remarkable features of network construction
We demonstrated that there were good consistencies in
the comparisons between the minimal pathway maps and
the experimental, computational and parasitic data. However, we noticed that these results depended on how the
essential genes to the essential pathway maps were converted. We used "number" of essential genes in the pathway maps to define the essential pathway maps. When we
employed the "fraction" of essential genes in the pathway
maps, as was applied to define the conserved pathway
maps (OF value), instead of the number, the results were
slightly different. In both experimental and computational results for E. coli, the fractions of essential genes for
all pathway maps in "genetic information processing"
were higher than 30% (data not shown). However, the

Page 12 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:111

fractions of essential genes for all pathway maps in catabolism ("carbohydrate" and "energy" categories) were
lower than 30%, except the fraction for "C5-Branched
dibasic acid metabolism" in the computational results
(50%). This is because the computationally-determined
essential genes are the conserved genes, and genes in
"genetic information processing" are strongly conserved.
Also these genes tend to code proteins that have no substitutions, e.g., each of the ribosomal proteins. Disrupting
them is likely to be lethal. Apparently, the computational
method referring only to the gene conservation can hardly
clarify the significance of catabolism. On the other hand,
we first identify the conserved pathway maps that include
conserved orthologous genes. Subsequently, the pathway
maps that supply the substrates for the conserved pathway
maps are identified. In this case, the pathway maps in
catabolism are naturally introduced. Although this
method relies on the reliability of chemical reactions or
pathway-map network data employed, the framework is
very simple. The significance of catabolism may be still
under discussion and one may consider only the genes in
"genetic information processing" and a small number of
additional genes are enough to constitute a living cell in
very rich media, even though there are no genes in catabolism. We cannot argue for the possibility of such a virtual
organism at this stage, but we can point out that in each
bacterial genome the portion of genes for catabolism is
considerable (in E. coli 7%), and to shed light on their significance, our method is effective. We consider this methodology provides an alternative way to explore a minimal
cellular-function set, other than current experimental and
computational approaches.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/111

data for biochemical reactions, instead of the KEGG data,
e.g., a genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli, iAF1260
[31] and that of B. subtilis, iYO844 [32]. By analyzing the
other data as well as modifying our algorithm, we can
refine our results.
As mentioned in the Background, a minimal genome and
a minimal cellular-function set depend on the environment or nutrients, and their general definitions are very
difficult. However, an estimation of minimal cellularfunctions to realize a specific biological system is useful to
design an efficient biological process, from the viewpoints
of synthetic biology and cell engineering. For instance, we
could design a bacterial genome that will degrade harmful
chemicals, such as dioxin, or synthesize beneficial materials, such as ethanol, in large quantities through photosynthesis, by considering only minimal pathway maps
related to their efficient catalysis.

Conclusion
The method to evaluate the minimal KEGG pathway
maps proposed here identified 41 pathway maps, including 20 conserved pathway maps and 21 organism-specific
pathway maps for E. coli, and 41 pathway maps, including
25 conserved pathway maps and 16 organism-specific
pathway maps for B. subtilis. The conserved pathway maps
include many pathway maps classified as "genetic information processing", whereas the organism-specific pathway maps mainly include pathway maps for catabolism,
reflecting evolutionary aspects. The consistencies between
minimal pathway maps and the experimental, computational, and parasitic data indicate that our procedure is
realistic.
In the case of KEGG data analysis, since our method to
detect organism-specific pathway maps is applicable to
only the enzymatic reactions, it is insufficient to estimate
the essentialities of "membrane transport", "signal transduction" or "cell motility", for which the chemical reactions are not provided in the reaction_mapformula.lst
file. However, our method can be applied to the other
