Abstract
Background: Ribosome biogenesis is an energy consuming and stringently controlled process that
involves hundreds of trans-acting factors. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), important
components of ribosome biogenesis are non-coding guide RNAs involved in rRNA processing,
nucleotide modifications like 2'-O-ribose methylation, pseudouridylation and possibly gene
regulation. snoRNAs are ubiquitous and are diverse in their genomic organization, mechanism of
transcription and process of maturation. In vertebrates, most snoRNAs are present in introns of
protein coding genes and are processed by exonucleolytic cleavage, while in plants they are
transcribed as polycistronic transcripts.
Results: This is a comprehensive analysis of malaria parasite snoRNA genes and proteins that have
a role in ribosomal biogenesis. Computational and experimental approaches have been used to
identify several box C/D snoRNAs from different species of Plasmodium and confirm their
expression. Our analyses reveal that the gene for endoribonuclease Rnt1 is absent from Plasmodium
falciparum genome, which indicates the existence of alternative pre-rRNA processing pathways.
The structural features of box C/D snoRNAs are highly conserved in Plasmodium genus; however,
unlike other organisms most parasite snoRNAs are present in single copy. The genomic localization
of parasite snoRNAs shows mixed patterns of those observed in plants, yeast and vertebrates. We
have localized parasite snoRNAs in untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs, and this is an
unprecedented and novel genetic feature. Akin to mammalian snoRNAs, those in Plasmodium may
also behave as mobile genetic elements.
Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive overview on trans-acting genes involved in
ribosome biogenesis and also a genetic insight into malaria parasite snoRNA genes.

Background
Malaria is a killer disease that is responsible for > 2 million deaths annually [1]. Given the global spread of multidrug-resistant malaria, there is an urgent need for new
chemotherapeutic agents. Of the four species of Plasmodium, P. falciparum (Pf) is the most deadly owing to its

ability to cytoadhere and cause complications like cerebral and placental malaria[2]. The genome sequence of P.
falciparum provided a foundation for studies on this
organism, and is being exploited to search for new drug
and vaccines candidates. The AT richness of the P. falciparum genome poses immense challenges for its thorough

computational analysis; in general, a majority of its genes
remain not annotated [3,4].
Several antibiotics and drugs target ribosome complexes,
the key machinery for translation of mRNAs into polypeptides [5]. Ribosomal biogenesis is an energy consuming
and stringently regulated process inside the cell. In
eukaryotes, it begins with the transcription of a pre-rRNA
molecules, which are modified and processed into smaller
mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs [6]. Small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) play a major role in the maturation of rRNA molecules [7]. snoRNAs are the small
metabolically stable non-coding RNAs present in the
nucleoli of cells [8]. They play crucial roles in nucleotide
modifications, viz methylation and pseudouridylation of
various RNAs like rRNA, snRNA, and tRNA. rRNA modification is important for proper functioning of the translation machinery, and deregulation of nucleotide
modification can lead to diseases like dyskeratosis congenita [9,10]. This disease is caused by point mutations in
the human gene encoding dyskerin, responsible for pseudouridylation. In an another case, snoRNA HBII-52 is
involved in the regulation of mRNA processing [11].
According to the conserved sequence motif and structural
features, snoRNA [except the RNA component of RNase
MRP (mitochondrial RNA processing)] can be classified
into two groups: box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs [12].
Box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs guide rRNA 2'-Oribose methylation and pseudouridylation respectively by
base pairing with the substrate RNA molecules [13]. Box
C/D snoRNAs contain two conserved sequence motifs,
box C (5'-RUGAUGA-3'; R-Purine) and box D (5'-CUGA3') which become proximal to each other due to short
stems which constitute the structural core motif of the
snoRNA. Commonly, box C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs are
about 65–100 and 120–160 bases in size respectively
[14]. In vertebrates, snoRNAs are predominantly located
in introns of ribosomal proteins and housekeeping genes,
whereas in yeast, most of them are transcribed from independent promoters [15,16]. Intron-encoded snoRNA
genes can follow different pathways for maturation: splicing dependent or independent [17].
In most eukaryotes, the copy number of rRNA genes is
high and they are present as tandem repeats. However,
Plasmodium genome is unique amongst eukaryotes where
rRNA genes have very few copies, and they are present on
different chromosomes [3,18]. Moreover, two distinct
types of developmentally regulated, cytoplasmic rRNA
transcripts have been detected in the parasite[19]. One
type of transcript is predominant in the asexual stages of
the parasite life cycle, and the other in the sexual stages.
The ratio of these two types of transcripts changes dramatically during the developmental cycle of the parasite, but

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/68

neither of them disappears completely at any stage of the
life cycle[19]. Both of them are distinct in length and also
differ in sequence in some non-conserved regions. Since
the highly conserved genomic organization of rRNA genes
amongst eukaryotes becomes different in Plasmodium, all
aspects related to ribosome biogenesis in Plasmodium call
for special interest. A better understanding of ribosome
structure and its biogenesis pathways may help in the
development of anti-malarial drugs. snoRNAs and other
trans-acting proteins comprise an important component
of ribosomal biogenesis, making their identification and
analysis of their genetic organization and evolutionary
linkages important for understanding their role in Plasmodium.
Genes corresponding to snoRNAs have been identified in
rice, Drosophila, yeast and various other organisms [2025]. Recent studies reveal that snoRNAs are a new class of
non-autonomous mobile genetic elements that traverse
using RNA intermediates[26,27]. In the present work, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the snoRNA genes
present in malaria parasites. Our study reveals the following key features of malaria parasite snoRNAs: (1) structural features of box C/D snoRNA are highly conserved in
Plasmodium genus, (2) unlike other organisms, most
snoRNAs in malaria parasites are present as a single copy,
(3) genomic localization patterns are mixture of those
observed in plants, yeast and vertebrates; parasite snoRNAs are present in clusters and introns of a gene (4) we
have found snoRNAs in 3'UTR of an mRNA, a feature not
reported in any organism till date, (5) and finally, we propose that as in mammals, the parasite snoRNAs may
behave as mobile genetic elements.

Results
Proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis
Considering the unusual gene structure and developmentally regulated transcription of ribosomal RNA in Plasmodium, we have tried to study the process of ribosomal
biogenesis in this genus. Amongst all the eukaryotes,
ribosomal biogenesis is most studied in yeast, leading to
identification of various genes important for processing
and maturation of pre-rRNA. We have used sequences of
proteins involved in yeast ribosomal biogenesis pathways
to find their homologues in Pf and tried to delineate pathways of ribosomal biogenesis in Plasmodium. We have
searched for all the ribosomal proteins in Pf genome and
also the trans-acting factors that have a role in ribosomal
biogenesis (results listed in additional file 1).

Plasmodium falciparum genome contains genes corresponding to all ribosomal proteins that are present in
small and large subunits of eukaryotic ribosome, except
RPL29. These ribosomal proteins share high sequence
identity with their counterparts in yeast and human.

Ribosomal proteins are unlike other Plasmodia proteins
that are generally larger than their homologues in other
eukaryotes.
As soon as RNA polymerase transcribes pre-rRNA, the
transcript is modified, mainly by pseudouridylation and
2'-O-ribose-methylation, at specific sites selected by
snoRNP complex[28]. This is followed by cleavage in 3'
external transcribed spacer (ETS) by an endoribonuclease
Rnt1p, a homologue of bacterial RNase III. Box C/D
snoRNP complex, responsible for 2'-O-ribose-methylation is constituted of a small RNA molecule (box C/D
snoRNA) and various proteins (fibrillarin, Nop56, Nop58
and Snu13). Similarly, box H/ACA snoRNP complex
responsible for psuedouridylation is comprised of a RNA
molecule (box H/ACA RNA) and proteins (Cbf5, Nhp2,
Nop10 and Gar1). Through our analysis we could find
homologues of each protein present in the snoRNP complexes, but the gene corresponding to Rnt1p enzyme was
absent from Plasmodium genome, when searched using
PSI-BLAST (for eight iterations).

vant snoRNA genes (for matched methylation sites).
Interestingly, none of the snoRNA genes present in this
subset localized to the protein-coding regions. They were
present either in introns or in intergenic regions, and had
canonical box C (UGAUGA) and box D (CUGA) motifs.
Therefore, after removing all those predicted snoRNAs,
which were either localized in the protein coding regions
or did not have canonical box C and D motifs, 16 snoRNA
were left.
We also extracted 1000 nucleotides upstream and downstream of each of these 16 snoRNA gene and rescanned
them through SNOSCAN program with lower cutoffs. Different introns of a gene harbouring a snoRNA were also
searched for other low scoring box C/D snoRNA genes.
This helped us identify two additional snoRNA genes,
PFS5 and PFS10 in the introns of PF11_0105 and
PF14_0230 respectively. Table 1 summarizes the 18 snoRNAs of Pf, and sequences of these are given in Table 2. A
schematic representation of some of the snoRNA genes in
context of the genome is shown in Figure 1. We have

Exosome is a multi-protein complex of 3'-5' exoribonuclease which is responsible for maturation and processing of
pre-rRNA and many other RNA like pre-mRNA and small
RNAs[29]. Exosome is composed of 9–11 subunit proteins, of which six (Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp43, Rrp45, Rrp46,
and Mtr3) have sequence identity with the E. coli RNase
PH domain. Genes corresponding to Rrp4, Rrp6, Rrp40,
Rrp42, Rrp44, Rrp45 and Csl4 could be identified in the
Plasmodium genome. However, homologues of Rrp43 and
Mtr3 could not be found in Pf genome, whereas Rrp41
and Rrp46 shared homology with a single protein
PF14_0256.
Identification of putative box C/D snoRNA
An analysis of methylation sites from various organisms
reveals that rRNA 2'-O-methylation sites are highly conserved[30]. We therefore used known yeast and human
methylation sites to find putative methylation sites in Pf
ribosomal RNAs by aligning its 18S and 28S rRNA (both
asexual and sexual stages) sequences with those from
yeast and human. Each of the mapped methylation sites
in asexual and sexual stage rRNA of Plasmodium falciparum
were observed to lie in conserved regions. For further studies we considered only the asexually expressed rRNA
sequences. The program SNOSCAN was used to predict
snoRNA genes in the Pf genome [20]. More than 100 box
C/D snoRNA genes were predicted for different methylation sites in the small (SSU) and large subunits (LSU) of
ribosomal rRNAs. To eliminate false positive snoRNA
genes, we used the following strategy – methylation sites
generated from the above-mentioned alignment were
matched with the sites predicted for putative snoRNA
(identified using SNOSCAN) to generate a subset of rele-

named the genes with the initial two characters representing the species and the following characters specify
snoRNA number. For example PFS1 represents P. falciparum snoRNA1 and PVS6 refers to P. vivax snoRNA 6.
Homologues of Pf snoRNA genes from other Plasmodium
species
Orthologous loci of other Plasmodium species (P.
chabaudi, P. yoelii, P. vivax, P. knowlesi and P. gallinaceum)
were searched for snoRNA genes, as outlined in additional
file 2. Of the 18 predicted box C/D snoRNA genes from P.
falciparum, most have potential orthologs in other Plasmodium species indicating the highly conserved nature of
snoRNAs in this genus. However, homologues of PFS16
could not be found in any other species of Plasmodium.

PFS16 is a paralog of PFS15 since both guide the same
methylation site, suggesting that this may be a recent case
of gene duplication. Phylogenetic analysis of homologous
snoRNAs revealed that P. vivax most likely diverged from
P. falciparum very early. The data indicate that P. knowlesi
is evolutionarily closer to P. vivax, whereas P. falciparum
seems more related to P. gallinaceum (Data not shown).
These evolutionary pattern retained phylogenetic deductions made by analysis of other conserved genes like rRNA
genes [31].

dicted Pf snoRNA was tested using two independent
techniques – northern hybridization and reverse transcriptase PCR assays. For the latter, total RNA was used,
whereas for northern hybrization we used RNA enriched
in small RNA. Out of the 18 predicted snoRNA genes,
expression could be confirmed for 14; 13 using northern
hybridization and one using reverse-transcriptase PCR
assay (Fig 2). Multiple bands could be observed in northern blots of PFS6, PFS8 and PFS12, most likely owing to
their processing from longer pre-snoRNA transcripts.
PFS12 northern blot has two major bands, one corresponding to the size of the snoRNA and other probably to
pre-snoRNA. The other low intensity band may be due to

processing intermediates and degradation products. No
experimental evidence for the expression of PFS2 and
PFS16 was found, which may be either due to low number
of detectable transcripts or lack of transcription of these
genes in the erythrocytic stages of parasites. We were also
able to find sequences of many snoRNAs in the expressed
sequence tags (EST) database of PlasmoDB (Table 3), an
observation that validates snoRNA expression in other
species of Plasmodium.

an important feature required for the stability and function of snoRNPs [8]. Some snoRNAs also contain two
antisense motifs (near D and D' box) complementary to
different target sequences. We were able to identify 18 box
C/D snoRNA genes exhibiting all the canonical structural
features including box C, box D, terminal stem and at
least one region (8–15 bases) complementary to the
rRNA. Some deviations were observed in the D' sequence
of some snoRNA genes (for e.g. ATGA in PFS15 and
PFS16, CCGA in PFS9, TTGA in PFS10). In the case of
PFS10, the CTGA motif is a part of the antisense element
(region complimentary to rRNA), while TTGA forms the

sense regions, which may be responsible for methylation
at two different sites instead of one. PFS2 shows a unique
feature of having two antisense regions in tandem, one of
which matches with the antisense region of PFS1. Five
(out of 18) snoRNAs have a box C' motif (PFS4, PFS6,
PFS8, PFS11 and PFS18). For all snoRNAs present in
introns (except PFS16), the distance between splice sites
and the snoRNA ends were greater than hundred bases,
which is required for splicing dependent maturation of
snoRNA [17].
Contrary to the general observation that Pf genes are
longer than their counterparts in other organisms, size of
snoRNA identified in this study falls in the generally
observed range of 70–90 bases, with an exception of
PFS14, which is 147 nucleotides long [32]. Interestingly, a
homologue of PFS14 in P. vivax is only 93 nucleotides in

length, as a polyA repeat present in other species is absent
from P. vivax. Additionally, a conserved polyA followed
by TA-repeats was observed downstream of many snoRNA
genes. PolyA repeat is a common feature observed downstream of retroposons.
The genomic organization of box C/D snoRNA in malaria
parasites
Genomic organization of snoRNA genes varies from one
species to another. Nine out of 18 snoRNA genes (PFS8–
PFS16) in Pf are present on chromosome 14, and the rest
of them are distributed on chromosomes 3, 8, 11 and 13
(Table 1). Nine out of 18 snoRNAs in Pf are present in
introns of protein-coding genes. Another 6 are localized
downstream of gene encoding ribosomal proteins. PFS2 is
located in an intron of the gene for guanine nucleotide
binding protein. This protein is a mediator for many cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein
transport, growth regulation and polypeptide chain regulation [33]. PF11_0105, a homologue of Enp1 protein,
harbors snoRNAs PFS5, PFS6 and PFS7 (Fig 3). Enp1 protein has a role in early processing and maturation of ribosomal RNA [34]. Two of the snoRNAs indentified, PFS15
and PFS16 are in the same intron of ribosomal protein
S27a, a feature unlike vertebrates but similar to plants,
which have a cluster of snoRNA genes in the same intron
[15,35]. Three snoRNAs PFS8, PFS9 and PFS13 are present
downstream of PF14_0231, a ribosomal protein of L7a
family, while PFS11 and PFS12 are present downstream of
PF14_0230 that belongs to the L5 family. The last intron
of PF14_0230 gene carries a snoRNA PFS10, which shifts
its locus downstream of the stop codon for the same gene
in other Plasmodium species, except in P. vivax (Fig 3B).
PFS14 is present downstream of protein PF14_0205
which is homologous to a ribosomal protein S25. The
intergenic distance between PFS11 and PFS12 is just 290
bp, which is reminiscent of two genes transcribed as a single transcript and further processed into mature snoRNA.
In order to test the same, we performed a reverse transcriptase PCR assay using specific forward primer against
PFS11 and reverse primer against PFS12. Our results show
(Fig 4) that these snoRNAs are present in a cluster and are
transcribed as a longer RNA transcript together from a single promoter. They are subsequently processed further
into two mature snoRNAs, PFS11 and PFS12. Similarly,
PVS11 and PVS12 in P. vivax are also coded as a polycistronic gene. Both these snoRNAs are localized in the
sequence of an expressed sequence tag (EST) CX022489 of
P. vivax (Fig 4).
The 3' UTR harbours snoRNA genes
Many of the identified snoRNAs from Pf (like PFS9, PFS11
and PFS14) lie just 602, 629 and 367 bases downstream
of the stop codon of genes PF14_0231, PF14_0230 and
PF14_0205 respectively, and are likely to be contained
within their 3' UTR. We performed reverse transcriptase

PCR assays using specific forward primer against the 3'
end of their protein coding region and reverse primer specific for the snoRNA gene. Our results show (Fig 4) that
PFS9 is located in the 3' UTR of the ribosomal protein L7a.
In the case of PFS11, we did not observe any amplified
product, which implies that it does not lie in the UTR. For
PFS14, a conclusive result could not be obtained, as the
amplified product was smaller than the expected size
(data not shown). PVS9, the homologue of PFS9 in P.
vivax was also localized to the 3' UTR of the ribosomal
protein L7a (Fig 4). PVS9 is present in the sequence of an
EST CV644537, whose sequence overlaps with the 3' end
of another EST CV636910. Sequence of the 5' end of
CV636910 was identical to the coding region of ribosomal protein L7a in P. vivax. So, using sequences of these
two overlapping ESTs, we calculated that the length of 3'
UTR of ribosomal protein L7a gene should be at least 681

bases. Since the distance between stop codon of this gene
and PVS9 is just 560 bases, the snoRNA should be present
in the 3' UTR of the ribosomal protein L7a gene. This is a
novel gene organization not reported in any other organism till date.
Identical copies of PKS11 with polyA tail
Two identical copies of a PKS11, which is a homolog of
PFS11, are present at different loci in the P. knowlesi
genome (one at PKN.000135 and another PKN.002755).
snoRNA gene on PKN.002755 has polyA repeats at 5' and
3' ends whereas PKN.000135 has poly A repeats at 3' end
only (Fig 5). Other species of Plasmodium have only one
snoRNA at similar loci as of PKN.002755.

Discussion
The aim of this work was to identify various genes
involved in ribosomal biogenesis pathway of malaria parasite. Various proteins and RNA molecules like RNA helicases, U3 snoRNA, RNA MRP have been identified and
reported earlier in Pf [36,37]. The structures and
sequences of 5' ETS of the different stage specific pre-rRNA

are also known from a previous study, but no information
is available for 3' ETS[18]. The present study highlights the
differences in the pathway, where gene for a particular
function (either protein or RNA) is missing in the Pf
genome. Absence of any factor would indicate deviation
from the known pathway and would call for identification
of alternative mechanisms present in malaria parasites.
In spite of the differences in the gene structure and transcription pattern of rRNA genes in Plasmodium, the protein
components of ribosome do not show much difference.
We could identify homologues for each of the proteins
present in large and small subunit of the ribosome, except
RPL29. The sequence identity with yeast and human
homologues for most of the ribosomal proteins were
higher than 60%, which indicate conservation of protein
structure and function.
Most of the trans-acting factors responsible for ribosomal
biogenesis are present in the parasite genome. Proteins
present in the various complexes like box C/D snoRNP,
box H/ACA snoRNP, U3 snoRNP and exosome have their

ies of PKS11 in P. knowlesi genome. Identification of gene
duplication in the genome shed new light on the mechanism of evolution of snoRNAs in Plasmodium genus.

homologues in the parasite genome. We were unable to
find a homologue for the endoribonuclease Rnt1p,
responsible for the cleavage in 3' ETS of pre-rRNA. This
step of ribosomal biogenesis in malaria parasite seems to
differ from yeast and the protein responsible for this function in Pf may be a drug target. Further study is required
to identify the sequences of 3' ETS of pre-rRNA and various proteins involved in the alternative pathway for its
processing.
Chakrabarti et al have reported the existence of 2'-Omethylation and snoRNAs in malaria parasites[37]. They
have identified non coding RNAs using GC content, RNA
folding potential and sequence conservations. We have
predicted box C/D snoRNA genes of P. falciparum using a
different computational method based on hidden markov
model (HMM), which has enabled us to identify even
those snoRNA which are present in only one species.
Identification of species specific snoRNA helps to understand the mechanism of snoRNA evolution. Out of the 18
snoRNA genes in this study, 16 were reported by Chakrabarti et al. Additionally we have identified some new
snoRNA genes not listed in the previous report. These are:
PFS16, which guides methylation on a site identical to
that for PFS15; and PFS14, whose size differs amongst
species due to a small AA rich insertion in the gene. Additionally, we also report the presence of two identical cop-

We have confirmed the expression of snoRNA genes using
northern hybridization and reverse transcriptase PCR
assays. We have also identified the orthologs of these
genes in other Plasmodium species. A comparative study of
these snoRNAs has revealed features unique to malaria
parasite. Most of the snoRNAs in vertebrates are localized
to introns of protein coding genes [15,38]. In yeast, most
snoRNAs are transcribed from their independent promoters [39], barring a few intron-encoded genes. In the case of
Plasmodium, we found a mixture of localization patterns
observed in yeast, vertebrates and plants (Fig 6). Table 4
summarizes the comparative study of these snoRNAs, all
of which have similar target sites in Pf, yeast, humans and
Arabidopsis. All the 18 human snoRNAs are located in
introns as compared to only nine in case of Pf and four for
yeast. Eight of the snoRNAs in yeast are monocistronic
and five exist as polycistronic genes. In the case of Arabidopsis, all these are present in cluster and are transcribed
as polycistronic genes, whereas, in Pf two gene clusters
were observed, one in the case of PFS11 and PFS12 and
another in the case of PFS15 and PFS16 (Fig 4). In both
vertebrates and yeast, one intron harbours single snoRNA
gene but in plants, there are reports of clustered snoRNA
genes present in a single intron [35,40]. Plasmodium falciparum has a cluster of two snoRNAs, viz PFS15 and PFS16,
which are present in the same intron of PF 14_0027 (Fig
3).

high occurrence of Nms as compared to pseudouridines
on rRNA. Occurrence of a mixed population of box C/D
and H/ACA snoRNAs and a higher number of Nms than
psuedouridylation is in line with findings in Plasmodium
as reported by Chakrabarti et al[37].

Trypanosomatids are unicellular parasitic protozoa which
are the causative agents of several infamous parasitic diseases, such as African trypanosomiasis, caused by Trypanosoma brucei; Chagas' disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi;
and leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania species and have
a dual host like malaria parasites. Most snoRNAs in these
organisms are clustered in reiterated repeats that carry a
mixed population of C/D and H/ACA-like RNAs[41]. Prediction of the modifications guided by these RNAs and
using partial mapping data, 84 2'-O-methyls (Nms) and
32 pseudouridines were identified on rRNAs, suggesting a

The functional and evolutionary significance of UTRs of
eukaryotic transcripts remains unclear. There are reports
of introns in the UTRs of RNA transcripts but their functional significance is unknown[42]. In this work, we show
that snoRNA PFS9 is contained within the 3' UTR of the
RNA transcript of ribosomal protein L7a using RT-PCR.
Identification of polyA site of the mRNA using 3' RACE
would be another method to prove this. The homolog of
PFS9, PVS9 in P. vivax is also located in the 3' UTR of the
ribosomal protein L7a gene. Localization of snoRNAs in
3' UTR is a novel organization not reported in any other
organism till date.
PFS10 is located in an intron of a ribosomal protein
PF14_0230 but its homologues in P. chabaudi, P. berghei
and P. yoelii are present downstream of the last exon. The
three snoRNAs PFS5, PFS6 and PFS7 are present in introns
of Enp1 gene of Pf but are localized differently in different
species (Fig 3B and 3C). From these observations, it seems
likely that human and malaria parasite snoRNAs prefer to
localize in introns rather than in intergenic regions. Harbouring snoRNA genes in introns and UTRs of a constitutively expressed gene may be a more efficient and
coordinated method for transcription. In case of P. vivax,
the mRNA of Enp1 gene does not code for the full protein.
It is probable that the mRNA harbouring snoRNA genes
has lost its translational capability, which is reported in
many cases [43].
An interesting observation shows that PFS1 and PFS2 are
evolutionarily linked and may have evolved from a common ancestor. Both PFS1 and PFS2 have an identical antisense region. PFS1 has two regions complementary to
rRNA, one for 18S Tm1370 and another for 28S Gm3308,
whereas PFS2 has for 18S A1129 and 28S Am3307.
Regions for 28S – 3307 and 3308 are similar, except for
deletion of a cytidine from PFS1 antisense region, leading
to change in target site.
Studies on mammalian snoRNA genes have revealed that
they are a new class of mobile genetic elements [26,27]. It
has been proposed that retroposition followed by genetic
drift is a mechanism that can increase snoRNA diversity
during vertebrate evolution to eventually acquire new
RNA-modification functions. In this study, our results
imply that this mechanism may hold true in Plasmodium
also. In the first case, two identical copies of a homologue
of PFS11 are present in the P. knowlesi genome, whereas
only a single copy is present in other species. Sequence

alignment of these two loci with flanking regions suggests
a 'copy-paste mechanism', as observed in case of retrotransposons (Fig 5). We propose that snoRNA duplication
may be due to their behaviour as snoRTs because of two
reasons 1) both the copies are 100% identical with few
bases of overhangs and one of them had a poly A at the 5'
end of the sequence (present on PKN.002755), whereas
the other copy doesn't have it; presence of polyA tail is an
important feature of transposons that traverse using RNA
intermediates 2) Only P. knowlesi has two copies whereas
other species of Plasmodium have only one copy. The
parental copy may be the snoRNA present on
PKN.000135 which may have been lost during evolution
in other species. Since this is the only identified cases of
snoRT in Plasmodium, our hypothesis cannot be conclusively verified. Similar studies on H/ACA snoRNAs may
help to draw a final conclusion. In another case, PFS15 is
conserved in Plasmodium species but its paralog – PFS16,
is absent from another species, indicative of gene duplication.

Conclusion
We have identified snoRNA genes in malaria parasite and
have done a comprehensive analysis of their structural
features and genomic organisation, which has helped us
to understand the mechanism of evolution of snoRNA
genes. Like rRNA genes, these are present in low copy
numbers and their patterns of gene organization are a
mixture of those observed in other organisms. A feature
unique to Plasmodium is the localization of snoRNA genes
in 3' UTR of the ribosomal protein genes. As in mammals,
snoRNAs may behave as retrotransposons in Plasmodium
and may be one of the mechanisms of snoRNA evolution.
The gene for the endoribonuclease Rnt1 is absent from
malaria parasites genome, which indicates the existence of
alternative pre-rRNA processing pathways as compared
with the one in yeast.

Methods
Identification of Plasmodium snoRNAs
The genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 was
downloaded from PlasmoDB [44]. Ribosomal RNA gene
loci were deleted from the genome sequence to avoid false
positive hits, which was then used for searching potential
box C/D snoRNA genes using snoRNA search program
SNOSCAN [20]. SNOSCAN is based on a greedy search
algorithm. It sequentially identifies six features in the
gene: box C, box D, a region of sequence complementary
to ribosomal RNA, box D' if the rRNA complementary
region is not directly adjacent to box D, the predicted
methylation site within the rRNA based on the complementary region and the terminal stem base pairings, if
present. To identify snoRNA genes, SNOSCAN needs the
rRNA (28S, 18S) sequences, whereas a list of rRNA methylation sites is optional. All the hits that had a score higher

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/68

than 20, a default parameter were considered to be positive candidates. Putative candidates were searched for
their location in non-coding and coding regions. Flanking
sequences of each snoRNA candidate were examined for
any low scoring gene. BLAST was used to find other variants of all snoRNA genes in other Plasmodium species [45].
Since P. falciparum rRNA methylation sites have not been
determined experimentally, an alignment between rRNAs
of S. cerevisiae and P. falciparum was generated, and the S.
cerevisiae methylated sites were mapped on Pf rRNAs
http://people.biochem.umass.edu/fournierlab/snor
nadb/main.php
Identification of Plasmodium proteins
PlasmoDB and Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)
databases were searched for genes corresponding to various trans-acting factors involved in the ribosomal biogenesis pathway using BLAST and PSI-BLAST [45].
Parasite culture
Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 was cultured in human
red blood cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
50 mg of hypoxanthine/litre, 25 mM NaHCO3, 0.2% of
glucose, 0.5% of albumax. For most purposes, mixed stage
cultures rich in trophozoite stage at high parasitemia (15–
20%) were used. To isolate the parasite, the culture was
treated with 0.05% saponin to lyse the red blood cell
membrane, and the released parasites were pelleted down
by centrifugation and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline.
Experimental verification of snoRNA using northern blot
and RT PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the mixed parasite pellet
using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized
using random hexamers as primers, 2 μg of total RNA and
SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (RT) (Amersham Pharmacia First strand cDNA sythesis Kit) in a 15 μl reaction
mixture. In the control reaction, DNA polymerase was
used instead of reverse transcriptase. 1 μl of the cDNA
reaction was used to PCR amplify the snoRNA genes using
gene specific primers. Northern hybridization: A total of
4–5 μg of total RNA enriched in small RNA (isolated using
mirVana miRNA isolation kit from Ambion) was size fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide 8 M-urea gel. Electrotransfer of nucleic acids to nylon charged membrane was
carried out in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Pre-hybridization was carried out for 2 hours in 0.5 M sodium phosphate and 7% SDS buffer. End labeled DNA primers were
used as probes for hybridization at 48-degree Celsius.
After 20 hour of hybridization, the blots were washed
three times in 2× SSC and 0.2% SDS. These blots were
exposed to the phosphoimager screen.
