Abstract
Background: Retrotransposition of mRNA transcripts gives occasionally rise to functional retrogenes. Through
acquiring tempero-spatial expression patterns distinct from their parental genes and/or functional mutations in
their coding sequences, such retrogenes may in principle reshape signalling networks.
Results: Here we present evidence for such a scenario, involving retrogenes of Rap1 belonging to the Ras family
of small GTPases. We identified two murine and one human-specific retrogene of Rap1A and Rap1B, which encode
proteins that differ by only a few amino acids from their parental Rap1 proteins. Markedly, human hRap1B-retro
and mouse mRap1A-retro1 acquired mutations in the 12th and 59th amino acids, respectively, corresponding to
residues mutated in constitutively active oncogenic Ras proteins. Statistical and structural analyses support a
functional evolution scenario, where Rap1 isoforms of retrogenic origin are functionally distinct from their parental
proteins. Indeed, all retrogene-encoded GTPases have an increased GTP/GDP binding ratio in vivo, indicating that
their conformations resemble that of active GTP-bound Rap1. We furthermore demonstrate that these three Rap1
isoforms exhibit distinct affinities for the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS. Finally, when tested for their capacity to
induce key cellular processes like integrin-mediated cell adhesion or cell spreading, marked differences are seen.
Conclusions: Together, these data lend strong support for an evolution scenario, where retrotransposition and
subsequent mutation events generated species-specific Rap1 isoforms with differential signaling potential.
Expression of the constitutively active human Rap1B-retro in cells like those derived from Ramos Burkitt’s
lymphoma and bone marrow from a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) warrants further investigation
into its role in disease development.

Background
Development of new functional genes is central to the
evolution of species-specific traits [1]. Two major
mechanisms allow for creation of new genes based on
existing templates: duplication of chromosomal regions
containing gene loci and retrotransposition of mRNA
transcripts into the genome - a process which in mammals is facilitated by active LINE-1 retrotransposons
(L1s) [2,3]. Novel functions for processed genes, termed
retrogenes, may come from the acquirement of new spatio-temporal expression patterns, dictated by the

genomic context of cDNA insertion [4-8]. Furthermore,
functional evolution of their regulatory sequences and
coding sequences, driven by natural selection, could
result in new functions within signaling networks
[5,9,10].
Evidence for the latter mode of gene evolution is
scarce. First of all, expression of retrogenes has only
recently begun to be explored. Although expression of
processed genes seems to be more common than previously anticipated, surveys are frequently limited to a
single species [9-11]. In addition, the physiological consequences of altered gene expression patterns [4,5,12]
and/or the biochemical consequences of amino acid
substitutions are rarely investigated [1,5].
In the present study, we provide evidence for the
functional evolution of retrogenes derived from the Raslike GTPase, Rap1. The activity of Rap1 is dynamically

controlled by many different receptor proteins, including
tyrosine receptor kinases and G-protein coupled receptors [13]. These receptors regulate the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), resulting in
GTP-binding of Rap1, or GTPase activating proteins
(GAPs) that strongly increase the hydrolyzing capacity
of Rap1 and thereby inactivate Rap1 [14]. Rap1 is
involved in many different morphogenetic processes e.g.
by affecting the activity of cell-matrix or cell-cell adhesion receptors. In addition, Rap1 plays important physiological roles in established structures like for example
the vertebrate blood vessel system. Here, an acute rise
in cAMP results in immediate enhancement of the level
of GTP-bound Rap1 that is crucial for an increase in
vascular permeability [15].
Rap1A and Rap1B are paralogs and differ only by 9
amino acids, that are mostly located at the very C-terminal part [16]. Rap1 proteins are highly conserved in
evolution and in fact identical Rap1A as well as Rap1B
proteins are found in human, chimp, macaque, cow and
mouse. While both proteins are ubiquitously expressed
in tissues, a differential distribution of isoforms has been
observed, e.g. Rap1B protein is predominant in platelets
[17]. Possibly, the high level of sequence conservation
and differential gene expression reflects specific functions for each of these GTPases. This would be consistent with the outcome of studies in mice with targeted
disruption of Rap1 genes. Loss of Rap1B impairs platelet
aggregation due to a diminished activation of a IIb b 3
integrins. In addition, defects in endothelial cells may
cause bleedings, resulting in a high percentage of
embryonic lethality [18]. Rap1A knockout mice are fully
viable and fertile, but haematopoietic cells from the
spleen and thymus adhere less efficiently to fibronectin
or collagen as compared to wild type cells [19]. In
agreement with earlier in vitro observations [20], a
recent work reported a reduced superoxide production
in Rap1A -/- neutrophils [21]. Double Rap1A/Rap1B
knockout mice die during early embryogenesis suggesting functional overlap between the two Rap1 isoforms
[22].
Our current study suggests that additional complexity
resides within the Rap1 signaling network. We characterize here two murine-specific Rap1A retrogenes and
one human-specific Rap1B retrogene that acquired limited substitutions in amino acids, including the residues
G12 and A59 that were found to be mutated in oncogenic Ras isoforms. By using computational and experimental approaches we collected evidence that the
species-specific events of retrotransposition and mutation created new Rap1 isoforms whose signaling capacity
differs from that of their parental isoforms. We discuss
potential roles for Rap1 retrogenes in cell physiology.

Results
Identification of Rap1A and Rap1B retrogenes with
limited mutations

We have recently generated a Rap1A-deficient mouse
strain [19]. Unexpectedly, PCR on cDNA derived from
tissues of Rap1A -/- mice with a 5’ primer recognizing
the targeted second exon sequence and a 3’ primer
located in the last exon yielded products, thus suggesting the existence of another mRNA homologous to
Rap1A. Indeed, we cloned two cDNAs that showed high
homology to mouse Rap1A (mRap1A), yet encoded proteins with either a single or triple amino acid substitution as indicated in Figure 1A and 1B. We named these
genes mRap1A-retro1 (containing the mutation A59V)
and mRap1A-retro2 (I9L, T35M, L96V). Based on mutational and structural analysis of Ras-like GTPases, it
seemed likely that mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2
would encode for activated (GTP-bound) versions of
Rap1A.
Remarkably, database searches did not identify any
mouse ESTs corresponding to either of the mRap1Aretro transcripts. To establish that the cloned mRap1Aretro1 and mRap1A-retro2 were not derived from
amplification of genomic DNA, two control experiments
were done. First, reverse transcriptase was left out of the
RT-PCR reaction, which abolished amplification of the
cDNAs. Secondly, the cDNAs were amplified using the
Gene Racer kit, which relies on removal of the CAP
from mRNA and subsequent ligation of a PCR primer
to the now available phosphate group at the 5’ end of
the mRNA (see Methods). The RNA expression of both
retrogenes was analysed in WT and Rap1A -/- organs
by RT-PCR. Using PCR primers (Methods), which allow
for simultaneous amplification of mRap1A-retro1,
-retro2 and mRap1A mRNAs, a single PCR product of
1186 bp comprising the complete coding sequence and
a large part of 3’UTR, was amplified (Figure 2A). We
identified a NlaIV restriction site unique for the
mRap1A cDNA and used it to distinguish between transcripts of mRap1A-retro1, -retro2 and that of mRap1A.
Digestion of the 1186 bp PCR fragment of mRap1A
yielded two fragments of 213 and 973 bp. By means of
this approach we could detect expression of mRap1Aretro1 and mRap1A-retro2 in multiple tissues like thymus, lungs, testis and brain (Figure 2). Importantly,
when RT-PCR was done on Rap1A -/- tissue with one
primer placed in the deleted second exon (see Methods)
cDNAs of both retrogenes were amplified (Figure 2B
and data not shown). The same was observed, when primers specific for Rap1A retrogenes were used [Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1] (see Methods).
Importantly, we previously pointed out that also in
human there is evidence for expression of a Rap1B

Figure 1 Comparison of the mouse and human Rap1 retrogenes. A. Overview of nucleotide changes in the open reading frame (ORF)
regions of the three retrogenes. Changes in amino acid sequence are highlighted in three different colors on the blue background,
corresponding to each of the retrogenes (Rap1A-retro1 in yellow; Rap1B-retro2 in red; hRap1B-retro in green). mRap1A, mouse Rap1A sequence
(NM_145541); hRap1B, human Rap1B sequence (NM_015646). 1-4 in the ORF indicate the conserved motifs, G1-4, that bind the nucleotides and/
or interact with effector proteins (G1: 10GxxxxGKS17, Walker A; G2: 28FVxxYxPTxxDxY40, G3: 57DxxG60; G4: 116NKxD119). The effector domain
region is marked in pink (amino acids 20-45: 32-40 the general recognition motif; and 20-31, 41-45 specificity regions, [33]). B. Locations of
retrogene-specific amino acid substitutions mapped onto the structure of Rap1A in complex with the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of c-Raf1 (PDB:

retrogene (G12R, K42E), named hRap1B-retro [23].
More specifically, database searches revealed expression of this retrogene in Ramos Burkitt’s lymphoma,
neuroblastoma cell lines and placental tissue, while a
study by Gyan et al. detected expression in a bone
marrow sample from a patient with myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) [24]. As indicated above for Rap1A
retrogenes, also the hRap1B-retro may encode for a
Rap1 protein with elevated GTP content because of a
mutation at position twelve (G12R), but no functional
characterization of the encoded protein was so far
undertaken.

Genomic localization and origin of Rap1A and Rap1B
retrogenes

BLAST searches with the mRap1A-retro1 cDNA
sequence against the mouse genome sequence (NCBI
35) revealed that the gene is located on the antisense
strand of the 14th intron of general transcription factor
II H, polypeptide 1 (Gtf2 h1) gene on chromosome 7
(see Figure 3A). The mRap1A-retro1 cDNA sequence
mapped to a single exon - a typical feature of retrogenes. A sequence identical to that of mRap1A-retro2
was found on an RZPD cosmid (German Science Centre
for Genome Research: MPMGc121C10270Q2) that

overlapped with a Celera contig, also derived from chromosome 7 and containing exons of Gtf2 h1 (see Figure
3), [Additional file 2: Supplemental Figure S2-alignment]. (In contrast to the RZPD cosmid, the latter
sequence contained a single point mutation resulting in
a frame shift mutation in mRap1A-retro2, which may
represent a sequencing error). Importantly, the Gtf2 h1
sequences flanking mRap1A-retro2 were not identical to
those flanking mRap1A-retro1 and appeared to represent a second copy of the Gtf2 h1 gene. Both Gtf2 h1
genes appear to be transcriptionally active as is evident
from two different cDNAs having intact ORFs and corresponding to Gtf2 h1a, Gtf2 h1b (Accession: 31982312
and Accession: 2582796). Importantly, mRap1A-retro1
and -retro2 retrogenes were not present in other mammalian genomes (i.e. Rap1A retrogenes were absent
from the rat genome, but the Gtf2 h1 sequences flanking Rap1A retrogenes were highly homologous between
mouse and rat, Figure 3A). Likewise, the duplicated Gtf2
h1 loci were only found in the mouse genome.
Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the group
of the two Rap1A retrogenes and the mouse Rap1A
gene form a monophyletic group in the tree with other
mammalian Rap1A genes (with bootstrap support of
94%, see [Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3]).
Thus, Rap1A retrogenes likely split off the mouse lineage. Together, this strongly implies that an event of
insertion of a Rap1A retrogene into the 14th intron of
Gtf2 h1 was followed by a duplication event and that
the both events date back to times after rodent speciation. After the duplication, both Rap1A retrogenes
diverged by non-synonymous mutations (i.e. mutations
leading to amino acid changes) in their ORF regions
(see the next subchapter).

We resolved the location of the hRap1B-retro retrogene to the region within the antisense strand of the 2nd
intron of SV2C (synaptic vesicle protein 2 isoform C)
on chromosome 5 (Figure 3B). This Rap1B retrogene
was only identified in the human genome sequence (i.e.
was absent from the chimp genome), as revealed by
genomic blast searches (see Methods).
Interestingly, hRap1B-retro’s mRNA sequence maps to
2 exons that are separated by an intron, which was created by L1-mediated insertion of the SVA element into
a preferred target site sequence (TTTT/AA) [25] present
in human Rap1B mRNA (at 1304 nt, Accession:
58219793). We could reconstruct the insertion site for
the human Rap1B retrogene based on the comparison
with the chimp genome (Figure 3). The 2 nd intron of
SV2C gene in the chimp genome bears the insertion site
5’-TTTT/A-3’, typical of the site recognized by L1’s
endonuclease. Presence of target site duplications
(TSDs) flanking Rap1A and Rap1B retrogenes provides
further evidence for involvement of the LINE-1 retrotransposition machinery (Figure 3). Phylogenetic analysis
established that hRap1-retro and the Rap1B in human
and chimp form a monophyletic group (bootstrap support of 95%, see [Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure
S3]). This implies that hRap1B-retro arose after divergence of macaca from the ancestor of chimp and
human.
Functional evolution scenario

Could Yang’s codon evolution model provide evidence
for the functionality of the retrogenes? If the retrogenes
are functional, we expect that there are selective constraints on amino acid changing substitutions. As a consequence, the ratio ω of non-synonymous to
synonymous nucleotide substitution rates should be significantly smaller than one for the retrogenes. To check
that, we analyzed multiple alignments of the Rap1A and
Rap1B genes with orthologs in human, chimp, macaca,
dog, cow, rat, and mouse. All computational analysis
described below were performed by means of the
codeml program of the PAML software package (v.
3.15) [26]. Codeml assumes a time-continuous Markov
process of codon evolution [27] and ω-ratios were computed as Maximum-Likelihood-Estimates that maximize
the probability to observe the multiple alignment under
the assumptions specified below as outcome of the Markov process. We also computed standard deviations of
the ω-ratios by means of codeml. The assumed stationary distribution of codons was set to the one that
reflects the empirical nucleotide frequencies at the three
codon positions in the multiple alignment. Further,
since the gene tree did not fully resolve relations
between the Rap1 genes [Additional file 3: Supplemental
Figure S3], we assumed that orthologs in the alignment

mRap1A-retro1 (Accession: EU359270) and mRap1A-retro2 (Accession: EU359271) is supported by (1) the NCBI chr.7 contig (NCBI, Accession:

Gtf2H1b (Accession: 2582796). As we resolved, by sequencing, the whole 5’ UTR region of mRap1A-retro1, it is depicted as a longer message as
compared to mRap1A-retro2. For alignments see [Additional file 2: Supplemental Figure S2]. Bottom: Rap1A retrogenes are absent from the

located on the chr. 5 (Accession: 51465008). Red-colored boxes: transcripts of retrogenes. Dark-colored boxes within the retrogenes transcripts

have evolved along the branches of the established species phylogeny [28] (see Methods). Because the mouse
retrogenes are most similar to the mouse ortholog, as
supported by the well-resolved parts of the gene tree
[Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3], we assume
the retrogenes split off the mouse lineage. For example,
Figure 4A shows the phylogenetic tree with orthologs of
Rap1A and the two retrogenes in mouse. The right
hand part of the tree depicts the evolution of the two
retrogenes in mouse that emerged by a retrotransposition and a duplication event. We assume the so called
clades model (of PAML), i.e. the codon evolution model
where the mammalian orthologs have evolved in accordance to one ω-ratio ω1, whereas the evolution of the
retrogenes was governed by a different ω-ratio ω2. The
multiple alignment of Rap1B genes and the respective
human retrogene was modelled analogously under the
clades-model. Amino acid sequences of mammalian
Rap1A and Rap1B proteins are highly conserved, which
is reflected in the small ω 1 -values indicating strong
negative selection on Rap1A and Rap1B genes. We find
that, ω2-values are much larger than the ω1-values.
We tested whether it is appropriate to assume two different ω-ratios in the tree within the clades model by
computing the likelihood under the simpler M0-model
of codeml and performing a Likelihood Ratio Test
(LRT). The simpler M0-model, which assumes only one
ω-ratio for the whole tree, is a special case of the clades
model. Because the M0 model is nested in the clades

model, the likelihood under the clades model is by definition larger or equal than the likelihood under the M0model for every alignment. The test statistic Δ of the
LRT is two times the difference in log likelihoods, Δ = 2
ln L(clades-model) - ln L(M0). The null assumption H0
of the LRT corresponds to the assumption that
sequences in the multiple alignment had evolved
according to the simpler M0-model. Then, under the
null assumption H0, the expected distribution of Δ is a
c2 distribution with one degree of freedom. The LRT
reveals for both alignments that the clades model with
two ω-ratios performs significantly better than the M0model of codeml, computed p-values were prap1A < 10-6
and prap1B = 0.0013.
The fact that ω-ratios are larger for retrogenes suggests that the selective pressure on the replacement of
amino acids was relaxed during the evolution of the retrogenes. However, ω2 estimates are at least two standard
deviations smaller than one for both, for the alignment
of Rap1A genes as well as for the alignment of Rap1B
genes. Thus, synonymous substitutions, which are
assumed to be neutral in Yang’s codon substitution
model, occurred significantly more often than nonsynonymous substitutions and we argue that the evolution of retrogenes was subject to moderate selective
constraints.
Interestingly, Lynch et al. [28] compared measures of
ω in paralogous genes of several eukaryotic genomes.
The authors demonstrated that ω systematically

retrotransposition event and a subsequent duplication
event. If we assume the expected number of neutral
synonymous substitutions under the 2-clades codon
evolution model (described above) to be proportional to
the elapse of time, then it can be speculated that the
duplication event occurred only shortly after the retrotransposition event. Moreover, we found evidence for a
scenario according to which the mutations at codon 35
resulting in synonymous and non-synonymous (T35 M)
substitutions in mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2,
respectively, were generated by deamination of methylated CpG (Figure 4b).
We further employed structural analysis and functional assays to uncover evidence for the molecular basis
of evolutionary pressure to conserve these genes.
Structure-related functional analysis

Figure 4 Codon evolution model of Rap1 retrogenes. A. The
phylogenetic tree depicts the evolution of mammalian Rap1A
orthologs and the two mouse Rap1A retrogenes. To check whether
the two retrogenes are functional, we compute ω-ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions with the clades model of
PAML. We assume one ω1-ratio for the left part of the tree whereas
the evolution of recently emerged retrogenes is modelled by an
individual ω2-value. Table shows the estimated ω-values and their
standard deviations as computed by PAML. The amino acid
sequences of mammalian Rap1A orthologs are fully conserved and
the ML estimate ω1 = 0.0001 is too close to zero for PAML to
compute a standard deviation. B. The evolution of the two mouse
Rap1A retrogenes involved a retrotransposition event and a
subsequent duplication event. Vertical edge lengths in the tree
dendrogram were computed by the PAML software and scale with
the expected number of neutral synonymous substitutions under
the 2-clades codon evolution model. Leaves and internal nodes are
annotated with the four codons at positions 9, 35, 59, 96, where
non-synonymous subsitutions occured. Codons at internal nodes
were reconstructed by applying the Maximum Parsimony principle
to single nucleotide substitutions. It can be hypothesized, that nonsynonymous (T35 M) and synonymous (T35T) mutations at codon
35 observed in mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2, respectively,
result from deaminations of methylated CpG dinucleotide. Nonsynonymous mutations are highlighted in cyan.

decreases in time and concluded that “early in their evolutionary history, duplicated genes tend to be under
moderate selective constraints” where the range for ω
lies between values of 0.37 and 0.46. We thus argue,
that the values of ω2(Rap1A) = 0.26 and ω2 (Rap1B) =
0.33 indicate that the evolution of mRap1A-retro1,
-retro2 genes and hRap1B-retro is constrained by a
regime of at least “moderate selection”.
The tree dendrogram of Figure 4B shows the evolution of the two mouse Rap1A retrogenes after a

In order to functionally characterize the Rap1 retrogene
encoded proteins, we first tested for their ability to bind
guanine nucleotides. mRap1A-retro1 and hRap1B-retro
contain mutations in 59th (in G3 motif) and 12th (in G1
motif) amino acid, respectively, that are involved in the
control of interactions with the GTP ligand (Figure 1B).
Since mutations at position 12 and 59 are transforming
mutations in Ras [29-31], it is expected that human
Rap1B-retro and mouse mRap1A-retro1 are more GTPbound than wild type Rap1.
Cos-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged versions
of wild type Rap1A, human Rap1B-retro, mouse
mRap1A-retro1, mouse mRap1A-retro2 or Rap1A-V12
and labeled with [32P]. HA-tagged proteins were isolated
by immuno-precipitation and their GTP/GDP content
was determined by thin layer chromatography (Figure
5A). As we and others reported previously, the percentage of GTP bound to wild type Rap1A is around twenty
percent, while Rap1A-V12 is highly GTP-bound [13,32].
Indeed, more than ninety percent of human Rap1Bretro and about forty percent of mRap1A-retro1 was
GTP-bound. mRap1A-retro2 was also almost exclusively
GTP-bound. The latter is most likely explained by the
mutation in the T35 located in the switch I region corresponding to the general recognition motif in the effector domain (Figure 1). Importantly, T35 is conserved in
Ras-like proteins [33]. Inspection of the crystal structure
of the complex between the Rap1A and the Ras-binding
domain of c-Raf1 shows that T35 helps in coordinating
the gamma-phosphate of GTP and the attacking water
molecule required for hydrolysis (Figure 1B).
Previously, it has been reported that V12 mutations in
Rap1 are still sensitive to Rap1GAP [34].
GAPs (GTPase activating proteins) are proteins that
mediate negative regulation of Ras-like GTPases by catalyzing the hydrolysis of GTP. Co-transfection of Rap1GAP
with any of the retrogenes caused a strong decrease in the

GTP/GDP ratio. However, this decrease was clearly less
pronounced for mRap1A-retro2 (Figure 5C) underlining
the importance of T35 for GTP hydrolysis but also its
involvement in control of interactions with target proteins.
It was shown that mutations in T35 residue perturb a
dynamic behavior of the switch I region [35] and this can
affect interactions with effector proteins but also regulatory factors like GAP which bind to this region [36].
The result above indicates that the conformations of
the proteins encoded by retrogenes resemble that of
active GTP-bound Rap1. GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap1V12 are known to strongly interact with the Ras-binding
domain (RBD) of RalGDS [37]. Therefore, we compared
the binding of the retrogene-encoded isoforms to GSTRBD with that of Rap1A-V12 using a pull down assay
(Figure 6). The binding of hRap1B-retro and mRap1Aretro1 to RalGDS RBD was comparable to that of
Rap1A-V12. In contrast, mouse mRap1A-retro2 did not
significantly bind to this RBD. As discussed above, this
is most likely caused by the T35 M mutation in the
effector domain region that mediates the interaction
with the RBD (see Figure 1B).
One of the best-documented functions of Rap1 is to
enhance integrin-dependent adhesion to extra-cellular
matrices [38]. We assayed the ability of retrogene isoforms to increase adhesion of HB6 cells (Jurkat T cells
expressing Epac1).

Figure 6 Analysis of activation of mRap1A-retro1, -retro2 and
hRap1B-retro. Cos7 cells were transfected with empty vector, 0.1,
0.5 or 2 μg Rap1A (Rap1A), 0.1, 0.5 or 2 μg Rap1 retrogenes or 0.1,
0.5 or 2 μg Rap1A-V12. After 48 hours cells were lysed, and Rap1GTP was isolated using GST-RalGDS-RBD and detected by using
Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody, indicated as PD: pull
down. The expression of HA-Rap1 was determined by
Westernblotting using anti-HA as a probe, indicated as TL: total
lysate.

Normally, these cells remain in suspension when plated on fibronectin-coated surfaces, but when activated
Rap1A is introduced into these cells they adhere in a
VLA-4 (a 4 b 1 ) dependent manner. We electroporated
expression vectors for the various Rap1 isoforms into
HB6 cells and the next day allowed them to adhere to
fibronectin-coated dishes (Methods). Both human
Rap1A-V12 and human Rap1B-retro clearly increased
adhesion (Figure 7). As reported previously, expression
of the RBD of RalGDS decreased adhesion by preventing
endogenous Rap1 effectors to interact with Rap1. Strikingly, expression of mouse retrogenes did not affect
adhesion positively or negatively. From this result we
conclude that whereas human Rap1B-retro has dominant-active properties in terms of regulation of integrinmediated adhesion, the mouse retrogenes are inactive in
this respect.
Cell spreading is a second function of Rap1, which is
independent of the control of integrin-mediated adhesion [39]. To test for this function, retrogenes were cotransfected with histon2B-GFP into A431 cells, grown
on glass coverslips, followed by staining with the antiHA antibody 12CA5 or phalloidin. First we confirmed
that virtually all cells expressing GFP also co-expressed
HA-tagged Rap1 (data not shown). Next, we used the
phalloidin staining to measure the surface area of GFPpositive cells. Untransfected and empty vector-transfected cells mostly have a round morphology under
these conditions. Expression of HA-Rap1V12, HAhRap1B-retro and HA-mRap1A-retro1 induced a clear

measured. Results are representative of three independent

increase in the fraction of spread cells (Figure 8A and
8B). In contrast, HA-Rap1A-retro2 did not significantly
alter cell spreading.
Together these results demonstrate that the proteins
encoded by the three Rap1 retrogenes differ in their biological activities.

Discussion
Reverse transcription of mRNAs followed by insertion
into the genome is an event, which in germ cells can
yield additional copies of genes for future generations.
In most cases they will develop into transcriptionally
silent pseudogenes, which harbor mutations in their
coding regions, preventing the production of functional
proteins. However, if retrotransposition yields processed
genes that have a distinct tempero-spatial expression
pattern and/or have acquired neomorphic functions as a
consequence of mutation, their presence may be advantageous to the organism and expression may be maintained [40].
Indeed, a number of reports have recently appeared,
suggesting that expression of processed genes (termed
retrogenes) might be more common than previously
anticipated. For example, the DPPA3 gene, which has
been used as a marker for pluripotency, was found to
have a number of related retrogenes, of which at least
one was found to be expressed in adult tissues [41].
Expressed retrogenes are not simple evolutionary relics,
but can obtain essential functions as was shown for the
Utp14B protein. Mutation of this autosomal gene results
in juvenile spermatogonial depletion [42].
In the course of analysis of our Rap1A knockout mice,
we isolated cDNAs from various tissues, corresponding
to two distinct Rap1A retrogenes. The existence of

Page 8 of 13

Rap1-like retrogenes appears not to be unique to mice.
Recently, we and others reported the existence of
hRap1B-retro retrogene in human, whose expression
might be linked to development of myelodysplastic syndromes and other types of leukemia [23,24]. Genomic
comparisons indicated that the Rap1A and Rap1B retrogenes are species-specific and that the Rap1A retrogenes
are paralogs. Interestingly, the recently emerged Rap1
retrogenes acquired limited amino acid-changing substitutions and our statistical analysis favors a scenario
whereby they evolved under selective constraints on
coding sequence. In this respect, hRap1B-retro (G12R,
K42E) and mRap1A-retro1 (A59V) were of special interest since they had substitutions at positions 12 and 59
(Figure 1), which resembled those found in constitutively active oncogenic Ras proteins. Both retrogeneencoded isoforms had an increased GTP/GDP binding
ratio and interacted strongly with the Ras-binding
domain of RalGDS in pull-down assays. Strikingly, only
hRap1B-retro increased integrin-mediated cell adhesion,
whereas mRap1A-retro1 was practically inactive in this
assay. Cell spreading on the other hand was increased
upon over-expression of both hRap1B-retro and mRap1retro1. These results are reminiscent of those obtained
with various Rap1 mutants, generated via site directed
mutagenesis [43]. In that study, Rap1A G12V appeared
to be more powerful in suppressing growth of tumorigenic HT1080 cells than wild type Rap1, but its capacity
to induce a flat revertant phenotype of in Ras-transformed DT cells was not strongly increased. In contrast,
a Rap1A A59T mutant showed opposite characteristics
with a mild effect on HT1080 proliferation but a clearly
enhanced effect in the flat revertant assay. Together,
these results indicate that the proteins encoded by the
Rap1 retrogenes have different biological activities, and
uncouple cell adhesion and cell spreading, possibly by
activating distinct (sets of) Rap1 effectors. Indeed, Rap1
effectors have been described, which preferentially
increase cell spreading like VAV [39] or both cell
spreading and cell-matrix interaction like RIAM [44]. It
will be interesting to see if the Rap1 retrogene products
indeed selectively interact with such effectors. The fact
that Rap1 retrogene encoded proteins are in a GTPbound state suggest that retrogene expression would
allow for activation of Rap1-dependent processes in a
stimulus-independent way. This phenomenon is well
known in the case of Ras, where somatic mutations
result in oncogenic proteins, which stimulate the ERK
and PI-3K pathways in the absence of growth factors.
Likewise, expression of Rap1 retrogenes may activate
the above-mentioned effectors VAV or RIAM or any of
the other Rap1-effectors that include diverse proteins
like phospholipase Cε or the scaffold protein AF6
(reviewed in [45]). The precise mode by which retrogene

ImageJ program. Next, the surface of at least 90 transfected cells (selected on the basis of the presence of GFP-H2B) from two independent

encoded Rap1 isoforms interact with known Rap1 effectors or perhaps additional proteins will determine the
physiological consequences. These may include effects
on cell adhesion, important for neural pathfinding and
immune surveillance or cell-cell adhesion, contributing
e.g. to vascular permeability.

Conclusions
Collectively, the data above strongly indicate that mouse
mRap1A-retro1 and human hRap1B-retro retrogenes
represent recent examples of functional evolution. However, it has to be taken into consideration that not all of
the described retrogenes will be selectively maintained
and neo-functionalized. Indeed, we have not been able
to detect a biological effect of mRap1A-retro2 overexpression. This may lend support for the scenario
where mRap1A-retro2 is unlikely to escape nonfunctionalization.
Although it is hard to rule out that the other two retrogenes are on their way to non-functionalization, the
fact that mRap1A-retro1 solely stimulates cell spreading

but not adhesion, points to a unique property of this
isoform. In addition, the fact that it like hRap1B-retro
encodes for constitutively active protein, indicates that it
can function largely independently of GEFs. Although
one could argue that our current study does not reveal
truly novel functions to warrant the term neo-functionalization, future studies that should try to identify downstream effectors for e.g. mRap1A-retro2 should shed
further light on this issue.
It is of note that the Ras-like protein family contains
at least two other members of retrogenic origin, a HRas retrogene named Eras, and a representative of Rap
subfamily, Rap2B. Interestingly, mouse and human ERas,
acquired mutations at positions 12, 59, 62 that render
constitutively active proteins [46]. ERas is absent from
genomes of fish and amphibians and appears to be
exclusively present in mammalian genomes. Its primary
function was linked to its highly specific domain of
expression in mouse ES cells [46], yet expression of
ERas was not detected in human ES cells [47]. On the
other hand, the Rap2B retrogene, originally discovered

Zemojtel et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:55
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/55

in human platelets [48], is vastly conserved in vertebrate
genomes. By contrast, Rap1 retrogenes are products of
recent evolutionary events that created species-specific
isoforms with differential signaling capacity. Although
their physiological significance remains to be established, the fact that all of them are GTP-loaded, yet
have distinct signaling capacities, shows how limited
amino acid substitutions may turn recently emerged retrogenes into functionally novel genetic entities.

Methods
Sequences of Rap1 orthologs

The sequences of Rap1A and Rap1B orthologs were
extracted using human and mouse Rap1A/B sequences
(NM_145541, NM_015646) as queries in tblastx
searches against the chimp, macaca, rat, dog and cow
genomes.
Genomic comparisons

In order to identify orthologous loci of mouse Rap1A
and human Rap1B retrogenes in the rat and in the
chimp genomes, respectively, we utilized nucleotide
and protein blast searches. We checked for presence/
absence of Rap1B and Rap1A retrogenes in the
sequences of human, chimp, orangutan, rhesus, marmoset, mouse, rat, guinea pig, cat, dog, horse, cow,
opossum and platypus genomes (as made available at
the UCSC genome browser). The multiple alignments
reported in the [Additional file 2: Supplemental Figure
S2] and in the [Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure
S3] were computed with ClustalX and visually
inspected afterwards.
Phylogenetic analysis

Given the alignment of all Rap1 genes, we wanted to
infer a gene tree according to which the Rap1 genes
putatively evolved. We used jModelTest (version 0.1.1)
to identify the nucleotide substitution model that best
fits the alignment [49] and PhyML [50] to infer possible
gene trees. The “HKY85 + I” nucleotide substitution
model (which parameterizes substitution rates with a
parameter for the transition-transversion ratio, accounts
for different nucleotide frequencies, and assumes that a
fraction of sites is invariable) was always selected as the
best-fit model according to the Akaike Information Criterion (with and without second order correction) and
the Bayes Information Criterion.
We then ran PhyML with “HKY85 + I” as nucleotide
substitution model on the alignment as well on 100
bootstrap replicates of the alignment. The resulting tree
with annotated bootstrap values is shown in [Additional
file 3: Supplemental Figure S3].
The ML tree does not reflect the accepted species
phylogeny. However, the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH)

Page 10 of 13

[51] test to compare different assumptions about the
tree revealed that the maximal likelihood of the tree
computed with PhyML is not significantly different from
the likelihood under the tree that reflects the species
phylogeny (shown in Figure 4).
Compounding both, the SH test and weak bootstrap
support values at basal branches, we concluded that the
alignment is too conserved to carry enough signal to
resolve basal branching patterns. We therefore assumed
that orthologs in the alignment have evolved along the
branches of the established species phylogeny (Figure 4)
and confirmed that the computation of ω values is not
sensitive to different basal branching patterns. For
example we considered the topology ((rodents, (cow,
dog)), primates) and compared results to the ones under
((rodents, primates), (cow, dog)) which represents the
established species phylogeny. The ω values shown in
Table in Figure 4A are the same under the two alternative tree topologies.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription

RNA was isolated using standard protocols and deprived
of DNA using the DNAseI kit from Promega Corporation according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
cDNA was made using the SuperscriptTM II Reverse
Transcripatase kit from Invitrogen according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For each RNA sample a control
reaction was prepared w/o RT polymerase to check
whether Dnase I digestion had been successful.
RT- PCR reaction and cloning of retrogenes

For PCR reactions, the Taq PCR core kit fom Qiagene
was used. 2-4 μl of RT reaction was mixed with PCR
buffer, dNTPs, water, Taq polymerase and 10 pmol of 5’
and 3’ specific primers. The following PCR conditions
were used: 96°C, 2 min. 25-35 cycles: 96°C-20 s, Tm-50°
C -20 s, 72°C-1 min.: 72°C, 10 min. Using the following
primer set we amplified a 1186 bp fragment of Rap1A
as well as mRap1A-retro1 and mRap1A-retro2 genes: 5’GCGGGATTGTCAATATTTAAAC-3’ and 5’-GCCATAGAAATCAGTTATCCC-3’. This primer set amplifies
the whole ORF and a part of the 3’UTR. To specifically
amplify Rap1A retrogenes from Rap1A -/- tissues one
primer was set in the targeted second exon: 5’-TCAGGAGGCGTGGGGAAG-3’ and the other in the 3’ UTR:
5’-GCCATAGAAATCAGTTATCCC-3’. PCR products
from multiple tissues (i.e. thymus, liver, spleen, testis)
were cloned into vector from TOPO TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen) and then sequenced using standard primers
recommended by manufacturer.
For the expression and activity studies both retrogenes were amplified using Pfu polymerase and primers compatible for cloning full length proteins into
pMT2HA.

Gene Racer reaction - full length RNA ligase-mediated
rapid amplification of 5’ cDNA ends (RLM-RACE PCR)

The Gene Racer kit (Invitrogen) was used according to
the manufacturer’s recommendation. Briefly, RNA was
dephosphorylated to eliminate truncated mRNA and
non-mRNA from subsequent ligation with the GeneRacer RNA Oligo. Next, the cap structure from intact, fulllength mRNA was removed using Tap enzyme. This
treatment generates a 5’phosphate required for ligation
to the “GeneRacer RNA Oligo”. Subsequently, ligation
of RNA Oligo to decapped mRNA was performed utilizing T4 RNA ligase. Then, cDNA was produced on this
RNA using random primers. Hereafter, PCR was performed in order to obtain 5’ ends. For this purpose, the
first-strand cDNA was amplified using “GeneRacer 5’
Primer” (homologous to the GeneRacer RNA Oligo): 5’CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA-3’ and a reverse
gene-specific primer located in the targeted second
exon: 5’-CTTCCCCACGCCTCCTGAACCAA-3’. Only
mRNA that ligated to ‘’GeneRacer RNA Oligo” and is
completely reverse transcribed will be amplified. This
PCR was prepared the standard way using Taq polymerase from Quiagen. Subsequently, this PCR reaction was
further used for nested PCR. Here, “5’GeneRacer Nest
primer": 5’-GGACACTGACATGGACTGAAGGAGTA3’ and reverse nested gene specific primer located in the
targeted second exon: 5’-CTTCCCCACGCCTCCTGAACCAA-3’ were used. The products obtained as single dominant bands were then cloned into pCR4-TOPO
vector (TOPO TA cloning kit Invitrogen) and
sequenced. The sequence derived from wild type material, was a 5’ sequence of mRap1A mRNA. The PCR
product from knockout material was corresponding to a
5’ UTR of mRap1A-retro1. The 5’UTR region of
mRap1A-retro1 is longer (by ~550 nt) than the 5’UTR
of mRap1A and different from the 5’ UTR of mRap1A
(as also evident from the genomic sequence of mRap1Aretro1).
Sequencing of Cosmid DNA harboring mRap1A-retro2

Cosmid MPMGc121C10270Q2, obtained from RZPD
(German Science Centre for Genome Research) was
identified during the screen for the Rap1A gene. We
sequenced 1741 nt of this cosmid harboring mRap1Aretro2, using the following oligos:
5’-GCGGGATTGTCAATATTTAAAC-3’; 5’-CTTCCCCACGCCTCCTGAACCAA-3’; 5’-CACCAGTGGAAAAGAAGAAGCC-3’ and 5’-GGCACAGTTACACCACTGTCTTG-3’.
Cell culture

Cos-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles
medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
and serum-starved in DMEM at 1.5% FCS. A431 cells

Page 11 of 13

expressing human p120 short interfering RNA (siRNA)
was described previously [52]. Cells were cultured in
DMEM containing L-glutamine (Hyclone), 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen).
Cloning of hRap1B-retro into pMT2HA vector

The fragment containing the ORF of hRap1Bretro was
amplified from human genomic DNA using primers: 5’ATGTCGACCATGCGTGAGTATAAGCTAGTCGT-3’
and 5’-ATGCGGCCGCAGACCTGGCTCAGAGCTACA-3’. We used Advantage polymerase from Clontech with PCR conditions: 1 cycle: 95°C 1 min./35
cycles: 95°C 15 sec, 68°C 1 min/1 cycle: 68°C 10 min.
The PCR product was cloned into vector from TOPO
TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then re-cloned into SalI
and NotI of pMT2HA vector.
Activity measurements for Rap1 and related proteins

Determination of the GDP/GTP ratio using [32P]-labeling of cells or using a non-radio active pull-down assay
were done as described in Zwartkruis et al. 1998 [13].
Haemaglutamin (HA)-tagged Rap1, Rap1V12 (HARapV12), Rap1GAP (HA-RapGAP I) have previously
been described [13].
Cell spreading assay

To measure cell spreading, A431 p120 RNAi cells [52]
were plated on glass cover slips. The next day cells were
transfected with either empty vector or pMT2HA vectors expressing the various Rap1 cDNAs and histon2B::
GFP using Fugene. After 24 hours, cells were fixed and
stained either for the HA-tag to confirm that GFP positive cells also expressed Rap1 protein or with TRITC
phalloidin. Cell surface area was measured using the
ImageJ program version 1.36b (NIH).
Adhesion Assay

For adhesion assays, transiently transfected Jurkat cells,
serum starved overnight, were harvested, washed, and
suspended in TSM buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2) at a concentration of 5 × 10 5 cells/ml. 24-Well Nunc Maxisorp
plates (Corning, NY, USA) were coated with fibronectin
(5 μg/ml) overnight at 4°C, washed, and blocked for 1
hour at 37°C with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
TSM. After washing, 200 μl of TSM was added per well
with or without the indicated stimuli. Subsequently, 200
μl cell suspension was added per well. Cells were
allowed to adhere for 1 hour at 37°C and non-adherent
cells were removed with warmed 0.5% BSA, TSM.
Adherent cells were lysed and subjected to a luciferase
assay as described previously [53]. Expression of transfected constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting of

Zemojtel et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:55
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/55

total cell lysates. Adherent cells were calculated, and the
cell numbers were corrected for transfection efficiency
and non-specific effects of constructs by measuring luciferase activity of total input cells ((counts in cells
bound/counts in total input cells) × 100%).
