Mimivirus reveals Mre11/Rad50 fusion proteins
with a sporadic distribution in eukaryotes,
bacteria, viruses and plasmids
Takashi Yoshida1, Jean-Michel Claverie2 and Hiroyuki Ogata2*

Abstract
Background: The Mre11/Rad50 complex and the homologous SbcD/SbcC complex in bacteria play crucial roles in
the metabolism of DNA double-strand breaks, including DNA repair, genome replication, homologous
recombination and non-homologous end-joining in cellular life forms and viruses. Here we investigated the amino
acid sequence of the Mimivirus R555 gene product, originally annotated as a Rad50 homolog, and later shown to
have close homologs in marine microbial metagenomes.
Results: Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that R555 protein sequence is constituted from the fusion of an Nterminal Mre11-like domain with a C-terminal Rad50-like domain. A systematic database search revealed twelve
additional cases of Mre11/Rad50 (or SbcD/SbcC) fusions in a wide variety of unrelated organisms including
unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, the megaplasmid of a bacterium associated to deep-sea hydrothermal
vents (Deferribacter desulfuricans) and the plasmid of Clostridium kluyveri. We also showed that R555 homologs are
abundant in the metagenomes from different aquatic environments and that they most likely belong to aquatic
viruses. The observed phyletic distribution of these fusion proteins suggests their recurrent creation and lateral
gene transfers across organisms.
Conclusions: The existence of the fused version of protein sequences is consistent with known functional
interactions between Mre11 and Rad50, and the gene fusion probably enhanced the opportunity for lateral
transfer. The abundance of the Mre11/Rad50 fusion genes in viral metagenomes and their sporadic phyletic
distribution in cellular organisms suggest that viruses, plasmids and transposons played a crucial role in the
formation of the fusion proteins and their propagation into cellular genomes.

Background
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a major cause of
genomic instability and can lead to chromosomal aberration and cancer [1,2]. DSBs occur in intermediate
steps during normal DNA metabolic processes such as
genome replication, meiotic recombination and programmed DNA rearrangement, but are also caused by
DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation as
well as genotoxic chemicals. All cellular organisms possess a set of conserved proteins to cope with this

dangerous form of genomic DNA; the Mre11/Rad50
complex in eukaryotes/archaea and its bacterial homologs (the SbcD/SbcC system) are the key players of the
DSB metabolism generating a recombinogenic 3’ overhang [3]. Due to their ubiquitous presence in cellular
organisms, it has been suggested that the last universal
common ancestor (LUCA) already possessed this system
[4]. Mre11 and SbcD are nucleases belonging to the calcineurin-like phosphoesterase family. Rad50 and SbcC
are ABC ATPases belonging to the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) superfamily, and exhibit
a long coiled-coil domain (~500Å when fully stretched)
used to bridge two DNA molecules. The Escherichia coli
SbcD/SbcC complex has an affinity for DNA hairpins

and is known to generate DSBs at these sites [2,5].
Homologous enzymes are also found in viruses; for
instance, T4 phage encodes a Rad50 homolog (gp46)
and a Mre11 homolog (gp47). These proteins are
involved in the recombination-dependent DNA replication, an elegant solution to the end replication problem
of linear viral genomes [6,7]. In bacteria, archaea and
T4, these nuclease and ATPase are encoded in an
operon [2,8].
Mimivirus (Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus;
APMV), a giant dsDNA virus infecting Acanthamoeba
spp., is the prototype of the Mimiviridae family, the latest addition to the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus
(NCLDV) group. Mimivirus is the largest among known
viruses in both particle size (~750 nm) and genome
length (1.2 Mb-genome encoding 1018 genes) [9-11].
The Mimivirus genome encodes at least eight putative
DNA repair enzymes capable of correcting mismatches
or errors induced by oxidation, UV irradiation and alkylating agents, including the recently analyzed putative
mismatch repair enzyme MutS7 (L359) that exhibits a
distinctive domain organization shared by other giant
viruses [12]. Mimivirus R555 originally annotated as a
Rad50 homolog [10] is part of this uniquely complete
Mimivirus DNA repair tool box. The R555 gene product
specifically attracted our attention following a study that
pointed out the existence of numerous homologs closely
related to R555 in a marine metagenomic data set [13].
Monier et al. analyzed the sequences gathered by the
Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) Expedition [14], and
identified 5,293 homologs for 229 Mimivirus proteins in
the metagenomic data set (mostly 0.1-0.8 μm size fractions). The number of such homologs for each of the
Mimivirus proteins was variable ranging from 1 to 249.
R555 homologs were found to be the most abundant
with 249 GOS scaffold matches, followed by 189
matches for R382 (mRNA capping enzyme) and 185
matches for R322 (B-type DNA polymerase). Here, we
analyzed the sequence of R555 using database searches
and phylogenetic reconstruction, and assessed the abundance of its close homologs in another large metagenomic data set generated by the Metagenomic Profiling
of Nine Biomes (BIOME), which consists of 42 viral
(<0.22 μm size fractions with a concentration of viral
DNAs) and 45 microbial metagenomes (typically >0.22
μm size fractions) [15].

Results
R555 encodes a fusion protein with Mre11-like and
Rad50-like domains

ORF R555 (1351 aa) of Mimivirus was initially annotated as a putative DNA repair protein [10]. When
searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein
sequence database using BLAST, R555 showed

Page 2 of 10

significant sequence similarities to 31 bacterial SbcC
DNA repair protein sequences (E-value: 10 -4 ~ 10 -9 ),
which were aligned with the C-terminal part of R555.
Similar to bacterial SbcC (COG0419), the corresponding
domain of R555 showed a set of ATP-binding motifs: an
N-terminal Walker A motif (P-loop) and a C-terminal
Walker B motif followed by a D-loop motif [16]. A
structural analysis of its Rad50 archaeal homolog in Pyrococcus furiosus suggests that two catalytic domains are
build up by the ATP-dependent dimerization of these
ATPase segments in an anti-parallel orientation [16]. In
addition to the ATPase domain, an analysis of the conserved domain [17] revealed the presence of a Metallophos domain (pfam00149; calcineurin-like phosfatase
family) [18] in the N-terminal region of R555 [19] (Figure 1). The Metallophos protein family includes a
diverse range of phosphoesterases as well as members of
DNA repair exonucleases (COG0420), such as yeast
Mre11 and bacterial SbcD proteins [18]. When the Nterminal region of R555 (residues 1-250) was searched
against the database by BLAST, the partial sequence was
found most similar to the Thermus thermophilus HB8
SbcD homolog (E-value = 10-7). Members of the SbcD
family proteins (COG0420) exhibit a conserved
sequence DXH(X 25 )GDXXD(X 25 )GNHD/E near the
metal chelating site [18,20,21]. This motif was found in
R555 except for the third aspartic acid residue that was
replaced by histidine. Several residues in the C-terminal
part of P. furiosus Mre11 were reported to be involved
in the nuclease activity (His173, His206 and His208 in
P. furiosus Mre11) [21,22]. The R555 sequence possesses
all of these catalytic residues except for an aspartic acid
residue (Asp242) replacing the His206 of P. furiosus
Mre11. In conclusion, the Mimivirus R555 gene product
corresponds to the fusion of an N-terminal Mre11-like
domain with a C-terminal Rad50-like domain.
Identification of similar fusion proteins in viruses,
plasmids, bacteria and eukaryotes

To search for additional instances of Mre11/Rad50 (or
SbcD/SbcC) fusion proteins, we performed PSI-BLAST
searches against the UniProt database using position
specific scoring profiles corresponding to COG0419
(SbcC) and COG0420 (SbcD) as queries. We successfully found twelve sequences showing significant similarities to both profiles from bacteria, eukaryotes and a
phage (Figure 1). Five bacteria (four firmicutes and one
thermophilic bacterium of the phylum Deferribacteres)
were found to possess an SbcDC fusion: the anaerobic
soil bacteria Clostridium kluyveri DSM555
(A5F9P1_CLOK5) and C. kluyveri NBRC 12016
(B9E6H1_CLOK1), the colon bacteria Anaerostipes caccae DSM 14662 (B0MG68_9FIRM), the rumen-associated Ruminococcus sp. 5_1_39BFAA (C6JB59_9FIRM),

and Deferribacter desulfuricans SSM1 (D3PEM5_9BACT), a thermophilic sulfur reducing bacterium isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. The
eukaryotes exhibiting a fused version of protein
sequence were the moss Physcomitrella patens subsp.
patens (A9RK34_PHYPA), the slime molds Dictyostelium discoideum (Q8T663_DICDI) and Polysphondylium
pallidum PN500 (D3AVR3_POLPA), the marine pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCAP 1055/1
(B7FXD6_PHATR), and the photosynthetic Prasinophyceae Micromonas pusilla CCMP1545 (C1N0B1_9CHLO)
and Micromonas sp. RCC299 (C1FJU6_9CHLO), found
throughout diverse marine environments. Finally, a similar fusion protein was also found in the Bacillus phage
0305phi8-36 (A7KV18_9CAUD). In both strains of C.
kluyveri, the fusion proteins were encoded in their plasmids. In Deferribacter, the gene for the fusion protein
was flanked by two sets of transposases (IS200/IS605)
on the 308-kb megaplasmid. In the cases of Anaerostipes
and the Bacillus phage, one of the P-loop NTPase segments normally part of SbcC was not observed. Mimivirus and the the Bacillus phage encode only the fused
version of homologs. However, in all of the cellular
organisms exhibiting a fused form of gene except for
Deferribacter, a normal set of genes separately encoding
Mre11/Rad50 or SbcD/SbcC homologs was identified
(Figure 1), suggesting that the role of the fused version
of proteins in these cellular organisms may differ from
that of the regular Mre11/Rad50 (SbcD/SbcC)
complexes.
The fusion form is compatible with known interactions
observed in the Mre11/Rad50 complex

Structural analysis of the Thermotoga maritima Mre11/
Rad50 complex revealed that Mre11 comprises a phosphodiesterase domain, an accessory DNA-binding “capping” domain and the most C-terminal helix-loop-helix
(HLH) domain, and that the HLH domain is involved in
the direct interaction with the root of the Rad50 coiledcoil domain (additional file 1) [1]. Our sequence analysis
shows that most of the newly identified fusion proteins
exhibit a sequence region that is similar in length to the
sequences of the Mre11 capping and HLH domains,
except for the fusion protein of Bacillus phage lacking
this part of sequence. Furthermore, three residues in the
HLH domain previously suggested to be responsible for
the interaction with Rad50 were found to be relatively
well conserved in the fusion protein sequences (additional file 1). Finally, the fusion of Mre11 and Rad50 in
this order from the N-terminus appears compatible with
the structural organization of the T. maritima Mre11/
Rad50 complex, as the C-terminal end of Mre11 is
located in a close proximity (~28Å) to the N-terminus
of Rad50. Such a distance would correspond to a linker

Page 4 of 10

of nine to twelve residues in an approximately extended
conformation. The sequences of R555 and most of the
newly identified fusion proteins appear to possess such
extra residues between the Mre11-like and Rad50-like
regions. This result suggests that the inter-domain interactions within the protein encoded by the fusion gene
might mimic those observed in the T. maritima Mre11/
Rad50 complex.
Fused versions of protein sequences are distinct from the
canonical Mre11/Rad50 or SbcD/SbcC sequences

We first performed a phylogenetic tree reconstruction of
the Mre11/Rad50-like fusion protein sequences, including several GOS sequences showing a strong similarity
to R555. No R555 homologs from the GOS data set
could be fully aligned with R555 due to the short size of
the metagenomic scaffolds. However, five GOS
sequences were found to contain an entire Mre11
domain and part of the Rad50 domain, and were
included in this analysis. In the resulting tree (Figure 2
(a) and additional file 2), R555 and its GOS homologs
formed a monophyletic group supported by a bootstrap
value of 100%, confirming the accuracy of our BLAST
procedure used to detect close homologs of R555 in the
metagenomes. Eukaryotic sequences ("the moss-diatomprasinophyte group”) and three sequences from closely
related bacteria ("the Clostridium-Ruminococcus group”)
showed well supported groups (bootstrap values were
91% and 100%, respectively). However, other bacterial
sequences were found scattered in the tree. Sequences
from plasmids or viruses did not show any particular
grouping.
A more comprehensive evolutionary picture emerged
when regular (i.e., “non-fused”) versions of sequences
were included in our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2(b)).
In this phylogenetic tree reconstruction, regular protein
sequences were concatenated to obtain a multiple alignment with the fused protein sequences. In the resulting
tree, the classical regular sequence versions showed
groupings corresponding to the three domains of life: a
bacterial clade represented by E. coli SbcD/SbcC, an
archaeal Mre11/Rad50 clade, and a eukaryotic clade
represented by the yeast and human Mre11/Rad50 proteins. These regular sequences forming three clades congruent with the three domains are hereafter referred to
as the “canonical” Mre11/Rad50 (or SbcD/SbcC)
homologs.
Remarkably, the thirteen fused versions of protein
sequences were placed outside the three canonical
clades, indicating that they are only distantly related to
the experimentally characterized classical versions of
Mre11/Rad50 homologs that are widespread within the
cellular organisms. Furthermore, the fused sequences
did not make a monophyletic group of their own,

To investigate further the taxonomic origin of the 249
R555 homologs from the GOS metagenomic data set,
additional ORFs from these R555 homolog-harboring
scaffolds [13] were searched against the UniProt database using BLAST. 85 ORFs from 68 GOS-scaffolds
showed significant similarities (E-value<10-5) to database
sequences. Notably, 50 of them were most similar to
viral sequences (49 phage genes and one eukaryotic
virus sequence), and 40 of the 68 scaffolds (60%) were
found to contain viral-like genes in addition to the
Mimivirus R555 homolog (additional file 3 and 4).
Phage protein homologs found in these scaffolds
included primases (ORF26 of Staphylococcus phageG1,
ORF023 of Staphylococcus phage Twort, gp21.95 of
Bacillus phage SPO1, gp068 of Lactobacillus phage
LP65, p152 of Synechococcus phage S-PM2, gp048 of
Listeria phage A511) and endonucleases (gp3 of Yersinia
phage Yepe2, gp14 of Enterobacteria phage K1F, gp3 of
Salmonella phage phiSG-JL2). On one hand, this result
suggests that many of these GOS scaffolds were of viral
origins. On the other hand, the abundance of ORFs
most similar to phage genes suggests that the R555
homologs in the GOS data set do not necessarily correspond to large DNA viruses but might belong to smaller
viruses. To further investigate this possibility, we examined the distribution of R555 homologs within another
large metagenomic data set (i.e. BIOME) comprising 87
metagenomes (42 from viral fractions and 45 from
microbial fractions) from nine environments (animal,
coral, fish, insect, marine, fresh water, hyper-saline,
microbialite, subterranean) [15]. By the same two-way
BLAST approach used to detect Mimivirus-like
sequences in the GOS data set [13], we identified 728
BIOME reads (with average length of 150 bp) similar to
Mimivirus protein sequences (for 184 distinct Mimivirus
genes). Two hundred sixty-one sequences were from
microbial fractions (> 0.22 μm), while 467 originated
from viral fractions (0.22 μm-filtrate purified by cesium
chloride (CsCl) step gradients). The relative abundance
of the Mimivirus-like sequences were high in marine
(viral), fresh water (microbial/viral), hyper-saline (viral)
and microbialite (microbial/viral) environments (additional file 5). Interestingly, of the 184 Mimivirus protein
sequences with close homologs in the BIOME data set,
R555 exhibited an exceptionally large number of homologs (288 BIOME reads), followed by much smaller
numbers for R322 (B-type DNA polymerase) with 38
reads, and L123 (hypothetical protein) with 20 reads

and enriched in viral fractions (< 0.22 μm) in the case
of the BIOME data. Such an enrichment in viral size
fractions was not observed for R322 (B type DNA polymerase), the gene most often used as a reference to
monitor the presence of large DNA viruses. This discrepancy between the R555 and DNA polymerase read

counts suggests that some of previously identified R555like homologs in the GOS data set might in fact originate from phages rather than from large eukaryotic
viruses. It should be noticed that the Mre11/Rad50 protein fusion in environmental sequence data was only
confirmed for a few cases of long sequences in the GOS
data set, although both of the nuclease and ATPase
domains of R555 showed many closely related sequences
in the BIOME data (data not shown).

Discussion
While investigating the DNA repair functions encoded
by the Mimivirus genome, we discovered that the R555
initially annotated as a Rad50 homolog was in fact a
fusion between Mre11 and Rad50, two proteins known
to be involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
breaks. Using the R555 sequence as a template, we then
found that similar fusion proteins are present in a wide
variety of unrelated organisms: phage, bacteria, unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, albeit with a highly
sporadic distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first
description of the existence fusion genes encoding both
Mre11-like and Rad50-like domains.
Interestingly, some of the fusion genes were identified
in plasmids (Clostridium kluyveri and Deferribacter). In
the case of Deferribacter, the plasmid-encoded sbcDC
fusion gene was found flanked by insertion sequences (i.
e., transposons). Our analysis of various metagenomic
data sets revealed that close homologs of R555 are
abundant in different aquatic environments and that
they are most likely associated with viruses. Finally, our
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Mre11/Rad50
(or SbcDC) fusion proteins are only distantly related to
the canonical versions of homologs and do not form a
monophyletic group. No simple evolutionary scenario
explains these observations. A possibility is that the cellular fusion genes were vertically derived from an ancestral gene present as a paralog of the canonical genes in
an ancestral cellular organism such as LUCA. These cellular non-canonical genes were then lost from most cellular lineages but were recruited by viruses including
the ancestor of Mimivirus. However, we consider this
“cell-central” hypothesis unlikely as this scenario postulates numerous independent gene loss events in cellular
organisms. A more likely explanation is to assume the
presence of non-canonical genes in ancestral viruses and
the occurrence of multiple gene fusion events.
In general, gene fusions are expected to facilitate or
simplify the co-expression and assembly of protein
domains initially encoded in separate genes. Such a physical link of two associated functions at the genomic
level also enhances the probability of successful lateral
gene transfers. Known examples of fused proteins in
viruses include the primase and helicase domain fusions

in large DNA viruses [23]. More recently, the mismatch
repair protein MutS of Mimivirus was suggested to
combine functions normally encoded in separate proteins, thanks to the fusion of the classical mismatch
recognition domains with a nicking endonuclease
domain [12]. The fusion proteins of this type, now classified in the MutS7 subfamily, are abundant in large
DNA viruses as well as in environmental metagenomes,
but also present in a few distantly related cellular organisms (i.e., the mitochondria of octocorals and Epsilonproteobacteria). Our observations on the Mre11/Rad50
fusion proteins show an intriguing resemblance to those
made on the MutS7 subfamily.
The apparent contradiction between their abundance
in metagenomes and the sporadic distribution in unrelated (but mostly marine) cellular organisms suggest
that the true niche of these protein variants is in viruses.
Viruses are abundant in aquatic environments, are
known to hold a huge genetic diversity yet underrepresented in the current databases, and are suggested to be
the place of the creation of new genes [24]. We propose
that viruses, plasmids and/or transposons might have
played a key role in the emergence of these Mre11/
Rad50-like fusion proteins as well as in their subsequent
propagation into different cellular organisms. The nonfused and non-canonical versions of Mre11/Rad50
homologs from viruses (such as gp46/gp47 of T4 and
other marine T4-like viruses) were found outside the
canonical clades corresponding to the three domains of
life. We confirmed that almost all T4-like viruses with
complete genomes possess homologs of these genes
(data not shown). This phylogenetic feature is consistent
with our hypothesis that viruses are the evolutionary
origin of the Mre11/Rad50 fusion proteins found in bacteria and eukaryotes.
Gene fusions probably occurred several times in different viral lineages using an operon structure as an
evolutionary template towards fused genes. Lateral
transfers then possibly spread the fused genes into different viruses and cellular organisms. For instance, the
presence of close homologs in mosses (Streptophyta),
diatoms (stramenopiles) and green algae (Chlorophyta)
suggests gene transfers among these very distantly
related eukaryotes via unidentified intermediates. Forterre hypothesized that the cellular DNA informational
proteins have been recruited independently in the three
domains of life from different viruses, which shared a
few common DNA processing enzymes such as the
canonical Rad50/Mre11 [25]. In our phylogenetic tree
(Figure 2(b)), cellular non-canonical versions (in either
fused or non-fused forms) were found intercalated
among the branches leading to non-canonical versions
of viral proteins. It is possible to see this branching pattern as another (but more recent) case of the lateral

Yoshida et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:427
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/427

flow of DNA processing genes from the virus gene pool
to cellular genomes. Future efforts in generating much
longer and deeper metagenomic reads are needed to
better understand the evolution of these new types of
proteins.
The function of R555 in the replication cycle of Mimivirus is currently unknown. In a previous work [11],
R555 was found to have the same intermediary expression pattern as other genes involved in DNA replication.
R555 may thus be involved in repair of transient DSBs,
for instance, in the region ahead of the advancing replication fork, since the Mimivirus genome encodes a
topoisomerase II (R480) [10], which removes superhelical tension by introducing transient DSBs [26]. Alternatively, the function of R555 may be associated with
genomic properties more specific to Mimivirus. As mentioned earlier, the T4 proteins gp46 and gp47 (homologs
of SbcC/SbcD, respectively) are involved in the recombination-dependent DNA replication (RDR) of the viral
genome [6]. T4 particles carry a linear dsDNA molecule.
The replication of such a linear molecule has to overcome the problem of synthesizing the complementary
strand of the 3’ terminus of the template DNA. T4
solves this problem using RDR linked to its terminally
redundant and circularly permuted linear genome. In
essence, 3’ single stranded (ss) end invades homologous
duplex DNA near the opposite end of the chromosome
(either the same DNA molecule or its sister). gp46/gp47
appears to contribute to the generation of the 3’ ss end
(by a process called “resection”) as well as to the bridging of two DNA ends. There is also evidence suggesting that poxviruses uses homologous recombination and
DSB repair for full-size genome replication, where the
G5 protein (a FEN1-like homolog) plays a crucial role
[27]. The Mimivirus R555 may be involved in a similar
process for the solution of the end replication problem.
The chromosome of Mimivirus is not circular permuted,
but exhibits a quasi-perfect (616/617 bp) inverted repetition of a 617-bp sequence near its termini [28]. These
homologous regions may serve as a template to complete the replication of the ends of the Mimivirus chromosome in a way similar to the RDR used by T4
(Figure 4). The coiled-coil segment in the phage gp46
protein (homologous to SbcC) is much shorter than in
its cellular counterparts. It has been suggested that this
may be related to the shorter length of the T4 168 kbp
genome and its much denser packing in viral replication
centers compared to cellular genomes [4]. Interestingly
the length of the predicted coiled-coil segment in R555
is comparable to these of cellular homologs, and appears
suitable to bridge two ends of the long Mimivirus genomic DNA (Figure 1). In T4, RecA-type recombinase
UvsX has a crucial role in the RDR, but Mimivirus possesses no RecA-type recombinase homolog. Mimivirus

Figure 4 Hypothetical model for the end replication of the
linear Mimivirus genome. The Mimvirus genome is illustrated by
two black lines with arrowheads indicating the 3’-ends. Inverted
repeats are indicated by black (forward) and gray (reverse) bars. Red
triangle indicates the position of the putative origin of replication
corresponding to the 400,000 nt position, where gene excess and A
+C excess curves show a reversal. Green sold lines indicate newly
synthesized leading strands, and green dotted lines newly
synthesized lagging strands. The R555 gene product is hypothesized
to be involved in the DSB resection. 3’ ss end then invades the
homologous duplex at the opposite extremity of the genome, and
the DNA synthesis starts (solid red line for leading and dotted red
line for lagging strand synthesis). Cross-strand structure is resolved
by cleavages (blue triangles).

B-type DNA polymerase (R322) may be involved in such
a recombination process, as the poxvirus B-type DNA
polymerase is known to have a recombinase activity
[29,30].
Another plausible role of R555 in Mimivirus may be
associated with the replication of DNA hairpins. In E.
coli, the SbcD/SbcC complex has an affinity for DNA
hairpin structures (>200 bp stem) and is known to generate DSBs at these sites, which are then repaired by
homologous recombination [2,5]. Most Mimivirus genes
3’-UTRs exhibit a palindromic sequence that serves as a
polyadenylation site on the transcribed mRNA and
tRNA molecules [11,31]. These sequences have the
potential of forming hairpin structures (>12 bp stem).
Out of the 581 Mimivirus genes for which the 3’transcript ends were mapped, 473 (81.4%) showed these
potential hairpin structures [31]. Given their large

number of occurrence in the Mimivirus genome, these
hairpins, albeit short, may occasionally inhibit DNA
replication. R555 might thus be involved in the process
ensuring the correct replication of functionally important palindromic sequences.

BLASTP. If the best score obtained from this BLASTP
search was lower than the BLASTX score obtained for
the alignment of the metagenomic read and Mimivirus
sequence, the metagenomic read was kept as a close
homolog of the Mimivirus ORF.

Conclusions
Homologs of the Mre11/Rad50 complex play crucial
roles in the DSB repair metabolism in cellular organisms. In this study, we showed that Mimivirus R555
gene product corresponds to a fusion of Mre11-like and
Rad50-like domains and that its close homologs are specifically abundant in aquatic viruses. We also identified
twelve additional cases of similar fusion protein
sequences in unrelated cellular organisms as well as in
another virus for the first time through a systematic
database search. The abundance of the Mre11/Rad50like fusion genes in viral metagenomes and their sporadic phylogenetic distribution can be explained by recurrent creations of new variants of genes in viruses and
their subsequent transfers to different cellular organisms
possibly relayed by plasmids or transposons.

Methods
Mre11/Rad50 and SbcDC fusion proteins were identified
by PSI-BLAST [32] using position specific scoring
matrices for the COG0419 (SbcC) and COG0420 (SbcD)
as queries. Prediction of coiled-coil domains was performed using the Coiled-Coil Prediction Server (http://
npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/; [33]). Multiple sequence alignments
were constructed using MAFFT ver. 6 with E-INS-i
option [34]. The alignments were examined and columns with more than 50% gaps were trimmed prior to
phylogenetic reconstructions. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyML ver. 3
with the JTT substitution model and 100 bootstrap
replicates [35]. We used MEGA5 (http://www.megasoftware.net/; [36]) for tree drawing. The BIOME data set
was downloaded from the CAMERA web site [37]. We
identified close homologs for the Mimivirus ORFs based
on the following procedure [13]. First, all the Mimivirus
ORF sequences were compared to the BIOME data set
using TBLASTX (E-value <0.1). This initial search
resulted into 13,305 metagenomic reads matching to
Mimivirus ORFs. These 13,305 sequences were then
searched against the UniProt database [38] using
BLASTX. This search resulted into 869 metagenomic
reads exhibiting their best match to Mimivirus ORFs (Evalue <0.1). For each of these 869 sequences, we
extracted a segment of the Mimivirus sequence that was
aligned with the reads. Next, this partial Mimivirus
sequence was searched against the UniProt database
(excluding Mimivirus entries in the database) using
