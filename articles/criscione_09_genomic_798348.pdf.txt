Abstract
Background: Schistosoma mansoni is a blood fluke that infects approximately 90 million people.
The complete life cycle of this parasite can be maintained in the laboratory, making this one of the
few experimentally tractable human helminth infections, and a rich literature reveals heritable
variation in important biomedical traits such as virulence, host-specificity, transmission and drug
resistance. However, there is a current lack of tools needed to study S. mansoni's molecular,
quantitative, and population genetics. Our goal was to construct a genetic linkage map for S.
mansoni, and thus provide a new resource that will help stimulate research on this neglected
pathogen.
Results: We genotyped grandparents, parents and 88 progeny to construct a 5.6 cM linkage map
containing 243 microsatellites positioned on 203 of the largest scaffolds in the genome sequence.
The map allows 70% of the estimated 300 Mb genome to be ordered on chromosomes, and
highlights where scaffolds have been incorrectly assembled. The markers fall into eight main linkage
groups, consistent with seven pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, and we were
able to anchor linkage groups to chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization. The genome
measures 1,228.6 cM. Marker segregation reveals higher female recombination, confirms ZW
inheritance patterns, and identifies recombination hotspots and regions of segregation distortion.
Conclusions: The genetic linkage map presented here is the first for S. mansoni and the first for a
species in the phylum Platyhelminthes. The map provides the critical tool necessary for quantitative
genetic analysis, aids genome assembly, and furnishes a framework for comparative flatworm
genomics and field-based molecular epidemiological studies.

Background

New research tools are urgently needed to combat the
neglected global disease of schistosomiasis [1,2], which is
caused by blood flukes in the genus Schistosoma. Over 200
million people across Africa, Asia, and South America are

infected and recent reevaluation of disability-adjusted life
year estimates indicates that schistosomes are a major global
burden [1]. Schistosoma mansoni is one of the four major
species of medical importance and infects over 83 million
people in Africa and the Middle East [3]. It is the only human

schistosome that has invaded the New World, with endemic
transmission established in the Caribbean and Brazil, where
over 6 million are estimated to be infected [4,5]. The complete
life cycle of this parasite can be maintained in the laboratory
using snail (Biomphalaria glabrata) and rodent hosts (Figure 1), thus making it one of the few experimentally tractable
human helminth infections. Despite its medical importance
and experimental tractability, research funding for this parasite lags far behind other tropical parasite diseases such as
malaria. A well developed genetic toolkit for this parasite will
help stimulate much needed research on S. mansoni.
Linkage mapping has been very successful for mapping the
genes underlying phenotypic variation in a number of parasitic organisms. In malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum) three genetic crosses have now been completed, and
a detailed microsatellite based map generated. The linkage
map has resulted in the identification of major genes underlying resistance to chloroquine, quinine, sulfadoxine, host
specificity, and male gametocytogenesis [6]. Similarly, link-

Schistosoma mansoni life cycle
Schistosoma mansoni life cycle. The life cycle involves both an aquatic snail
intermediate (Biomphalaria spp.) and a human definitive host. Mice and
hamsters can be used to maintain the life cycle in the laboratory. Male
(broad pink and red) and female (skinny pink) adult worms are found in
the venules draining the intestine. Eggs pass through the intestine and out
of the body with the feces. The eggs hatch in fresh water, and motile
miracidia actively search for snails. Following penetration into the snail
host, miracidia differentiate into sporocysts. Sporocysts proliferate
asexually in the snail, eventually releasing motile clonal cercariae into the
water. Cercariae penetrate the unbroken skin of a mammalian host, and
then migrate through the bloodstream to the hepatic portal system where
they develop into adults. In the laboratory, the entire life cycle takes 75 to
90 days to complete. S. mansoni is a conventional dioecious diploid, except
for the fact that larval forms replicate asexually within the snail
intermediate host. This aids in the staging of genetic crosses because
clonally generated male and female larvae from different snails can be used
to infect mice.

age maps of the parasitic protozoans Toxoplasma [7] and
Eimeria [8] have resulted in mapping of quantitative trait loci
underlying acute virulence, while trypanosome linkage maps
have also been created [9,10]. Linkage maps have been developed for a number of plant parasitic nematodes [11,12]. However, to date there are no genetic linkage maps for a helminth
parasite of humans, or platyhelminths of any species.
We describe a genetic linkage map for S. mansoni, which we
constructed for the following reasons. First, a map will aid in
the assembly of the genome sequence. The present version
(version 3.1) of the genome assembly contains 19,022 scaffolds, in part due to a highly repetitive genome (45%) that
inhibits further assembly [13]. Importantly, the largest 280
scaffolds comprise more than 70% of the 381 Mb in version
3.1 of the genome assembly; by placing markers in these scaffolds the majority of the genome sequence can be ordered on
linkage groups by examining their segregation patterns. Second, a linkage map is the critical tool needed for quantitative
trait mapping [14]. There is a rich experimental literature
demonstrating heritable variation in a wide variety of biomedically important traits of S. mansoni, such as host specificity [15] and virulence [16], and revealing co-evolutionary
interactions with the snail host [17]. Infections showing
reduced cure rates following treatment with the first line drug
praziquantel have been observed from multiple foci, and
worms recovered from these infections show increased tolerance to praziquantel in the laboratory, leading to worries
about the potential for spread of drug resistance [18]. Furthermore, resistance to oxamniquine has been selected in
natural parasite populations [19]. We note that this parasite
is particularly well suited to linkage mapping approaches
because large numbers of progeny can be recovered from single crosses, allowing statistically powerful experimental
designs. In addition, clonal amplification of larvae within the
snail intermediate host generates hundreds of genetically
identical individuals of each recombinant genotype, allowing
for precise replicated measurement of phenotypes (Figure 1).
Third, with the genomes of the Asian schistosome Schistosoma japonicum and the free living flatworm Schmidtea
mediterranea in the pipeline [13,20], comparative linkage
mapping and synteny analysis among platyhelminths will be
feasible. Given the medical and veterinary importance of
many flatworm species and the diversity of life styles (parasitic, free-living, monoecious, dioecious, clonal propagation,
regeneration), comparative flatworm genomics will provide a
fundamental framework for tackling both applied and basic
questions. Finally, the development of molecular markers
spanning the genome will enable more accurate estimates of
population genetic and recombination parameters from field
collected parasites. In turn, a better understanding of parasite
transmission among human or reservoir hosts will be gained
from field-based molecular epidemiological studies of S.
mansoni [21].

Results and discussion

We developed a genetic map by crossing a female S. mansoni
from the NMRI (Puerto Rico) line to a male S. mansoni from
the LE (Brazil) line (that is, P1 grandparents). Subsequently,
2 F1 parents were crossed to generate 88 F2 progeny (41
males and 47 females). We initially designed 376 primer pairs
(microsatellite loci) with at least 1 marker in the largest 283
scaffolds. Additional markers were placed in 73 of the largest
94 scaffolds to verify contig assembly and to obtain direct
estimates of the recombination rate (physical distance/map
distance). Screening of the grandparents and F1 parents with
all 376 loci revealed that 251 loci (Additional data file 1) could
be scored reliably and were informative in male and/or
female meioses. All 92 individuals (88 progeny, 2 F1 parents,
and 2 P1 grandparents) were genotyped with these 251 microsatellite markers. The data set was of good quality, with only
324 missing genotypes out of 22,088 possible (88 offspring ×
251 loci). Each locus had an average of 86.7 offspring scored
(range 80 to 88), while for each offspring an average of 247.3
loci were scored (range 221 to 251). We used the regression
mapping algorithm and Kosambi mapping function implemented in JoinMap version 4 to construct the linkage map
[22].

Anchoring linkage groups to chromosomes
In a sex-combined map, 243 of 251 markers (97%) assembled
into 8 major linkage groups of 10 or more markers (Table 1,
Figure 2). The remaining 8 of the 251 markers did not fall into
these 8 linkage groups: 5 clustered in 2 small linkage groups
(of 2 and 3 loci) while the remaining 3 markers were unlinked
(Additional data file 2). The S. mansoni genome (300 Mb)
consists of 7 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and 1 pair of
sex chromosomes (female = ZW, male = ZZ). ZW refers to systems in which the female is the heterogametic sex as opposed
to XY in which males are the heterogametic sex. In conjunction with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data of
bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or known genes, we
could anchor seven of the eight major linkage groups to chromosomes with high confidence (Figures 2 and 3). Linkage
group 9 (LG9) was tentatively called chromosome 5 by elimination. However, the lack of FISH markers on that chromosome prevents definitive assignment of a linkage group to
chromosome 5. In some instances, we found that mapped
markers and FISH-mapped BACs were not congruent (red
BACs in Figure 2). This incongruence could be due to inaccurate FISH hybridization, mislabeling of BAC clones, or incorrect genome contig assembly (discussed below). However,
our data do not permit the identification of the causative factor(s). Ordering of loci within these eight chromosomal linkage groups was conducted after retaining a single marker
from sets of loci showing identical segregation patterns (that
is, 0% recombination; Table 1). The mean chi-square values,
a measure of the goodness-of-fit of the regression mapping to
the pairwise estimates of recombination frequencies, were
well below 1 (range 0.105 to 0.341) for all the linkage groups.

This indicates that there was good support for the ordering of
markers within each linkage group (Additional data file 2).

Recombination parameters and map length
The final genetic map of the 8 major linkage groups (Table 1)
contained 210 loci because 33 loci showed identical segregation to other loci (Figure 2). The 8 chromosomal linkage
groups spanned 1,134.8 cM with an average marker spacing of
5.6 cM per interval. To account for linkage group ends beyond
terminal makers, we used the methods in [23,24], which calculate an expected map length for the terminal regions of the
linkage groups (see Materials and methods). These adjustments yielded a total adjusted genome length of 1,228.6 cM
(Table 1). Linkage groups ranged in (adjusted) size from 84 to
244 cM. The expected distance of a gene, E(m), from the nearest random marker (n = 210) is 2.9 cM with an upper 95%
confidence interval (CI) of 8.7 cM [14].
There was a strong positive relationship (r2 = 0.86, P =
0.0008) between the physical size (determined by cytology;
Table 1) and genetic map lengths of the chromosomes (Figure
4a), indicating that the average recombination rates are comparable among chromosomes. We made two estimates of
recombination rate with our data set. The first, 244.2 kb/cM,
is the physical genome size divided by adjusted map length.
The second is based on 24 mapped distance intervals between
markers that were placed on the same scaffolds of version 3.1
of the genome assembly (Additional data file 3). This provided a direct estimate of physical distance to map distance of
227.2 kb/cM (95% CI 181 to 309, based on 10,000 Monte
Carlo replicates of intervals). These estimates are the first for
a representative of the phylum Platyhelminthes and indicate
that recombination per physical distance in S. mansoni is
comparable to other multicellular invertebrates of similar
genome size [25]. Interestingly, the negative relationship
between recombination rate and physical genome size given
in [25] predicts a very similar rate of 302 kb/cM for S. mansoni. Our estimates are also consistent with recombination
frequencies obtained from previous cytogenetic work [26].
The average chiasma frequency of S. mansoni was estimated
at 18.3 (95% CI 17.3 to 19.3) [26], which equates to total map
lengths from 865 to 965 cM and recombination rates from
346.8 to 310.9 kb/cM. Thus, the cytogenetic estimate is marginally lower than our genetic estimate. In part, the cytogenetic estimates of recombination may be biased downward as
chiasma frequencies were only measured in males, in which
recombination is reduced (see below).
We were also able to compare 78 autosomal intervals between
male and female meioses (Figure 4b) to obtain sex-specific
recombination rates. Over these homologous regions, the
average female interval (9.42 cM) was significantly longer
than the average male interval (7.42 cM) (P = 0.019, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Sex-biased recombination rates (heterochiasmy) have been reported in many organisms (reviewed in
[27,28]). The evolutionary hypotheses and mechanistic proc-

esses put forth to explain sex differences in recombination
can be difficult to disentangle [28]. However, as the female,
the heterogametic sex, had 1.27-fold higher recombination
than the male, we can rule out the Haldane-Huxley rule. This
rule predicts lower recombination among autosomes in the
heterogametic sex because selection acts against recombination between different sex chromosomes. Our data provide a
second and phylogenetically independent example of a ZW
system that is inconsistent with the Haldane-Huxley rule (the
other is in the passerine bird Acrocephalus arundinaceus
[29]).

Genome assembly by linkage
Of the 243 markers assembled on the 8 chromosomes, there
are 203 unique scaffolds (totaling 209 Mb) represented.
Thus, the linkage map contains 70% of the estimated 300 Mb
physical genome and 55% of the 381 Mb currently in version
3.1 of the genome assembly. However, the current genome
assembly contains considerable redundancy and overestimates genome size and the 55% is thus likely to underestimate true coverage. Furthermore, if the total genetic map
length is calculated from the direct estimate of the recombination rate (300 Mb/227.2 kb/cM = 1,320 cM), then the
unadjusted map length accounts for 86% (1,134 of 1,320 cM)
of the total genetic map length. The genome assembly will
benefit from the broad coverage of the map, high density of
markers, and placement of previously unanchored and unordered scaffolds. The map data also provide a means to assess
the quality of the current assembly. There were 37 scaffolds
with 2 or more markers located < 2.2 Mb apart (Additional
data file 3), which equates to about 8 to 10 cM. Markers from
21 of the scaffolds were consistent with this pattern. However,
there were 16 scaffolds where markers mapped to different
linkage groups or had map distances that were much greater
than expected based on the recombination rate (Additional

data file 3; Figure 2). These data suggest that a substantial
portion (43% of our sample) of the current assembly is incorrect. However, given the highly repetitive nature of the
genome, it is encouraging that 57% of the scaffolds were valid
and that many of the mapped markers show congruence with
FISH-mapped BACs (Figure 3). These results also illustrate
the utility of linkage maps in correcting genome assembly
errors. Thus, the map will provide a platform for the continued assembly for the genome.

Marker segregation on sex chromosomes
There are several interesting features on LG2 of the Z chromosome (LG2_ChrZ; Figure 5a). Previous cytogenetic data
suggested that the heterochromatin region of the W chromosome does not recombine with a region on the Z chromosome,
but that there are two flanking pseudoautosomal regions
(Figure 5b). This was confirmed in our linkage map by the
identification of 23 Z-specific markers on 20 unique scaffolds
that clustered in a group (green markers in Figure 5a) and
were flanked by pseudoautosomal regions on either side. All
female worms that were genotyped had a single allele and the
alleles present in the F1 female parent and F2 female progeny
were always inherited from their respective male parent. In
contrast, male worms could be heterozygous. These patterns
are consistent with females being hemizygous at these loci.
FISH mapping confirms the close proximity of the pseudoautosomal markers sc68, sc42, and sc193 at the borders of the
heterochromatin region on the W (Figures 3 and 5c; Additional data file 4). Furthermore, the male meioses showed
extensive recombination across the Z-specific region in comparison to the female meioses (triangle in Figure 4b). In contrast, the female recombination was greater in
pseudoautosomal regions that bordered the Z-specific region
(sc240-sc111, sc111-sc193, sc195-sc68, sc68-sc64; shown as
circles in Figure 4b). This latter pattern is consistent with the

Linkage 2 of S. mansoni based on 210 markers
Linkage map of S. mansoni based on 210 markers. The map shows all 243 markers assigned to 210 unique positions on the 8 linkage groups; the numbers
are map distances in centimorgans. Loci that had 0% recombination with other markers are shown adjacent to the marker used in the construction of the
map. For example, marker sc84 on LG1_Chr1 had 0% recombination with both markers sc26 and sc93b. The Z-specific markers on LG2_ChrZ are shown
in green. Asterisks (* P < 0.01, ** P < 0.005, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0005, *****P < 0.0001) indicate significance for deviation from Mendelian
expectations. Genes with previously known physical positions from fluorescent in situ hybridization are shown in blue with GenBank accession numbers.
Blue lines show the scaffolds that match the DNA sequences of these genes in BLAST searches. These six genes add further support to the anchoring of
the LG3, LG4, and LG7 to chromosomes 2, 3, and 7, respectively. See Figure 3 for comments on the match with sc3 and Smox1.

Anchoring of linkage groups to chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization
Figure 3
Anchoring of linkage groups to chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The black and stippled regions show the heterochromatin (C-banded
regions) on the seven autosomes and two sex chromosomes, the vertical lines on chromosome 2 show the rDNA, and the ruler is marked in 1 Mb
increments. The chromosomal regions to which bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) hybridize are marked. All fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)mapped BACs shown hybridize uniquely to a single position in the genome and BLAST match to scaffolds from which the microsatellite markers were
designed (see Additional data file 4 for the BLAST matched markers for each BAC). The green BACs are congruent with linkage mapping results both in
terms of chromosome and relative marker order. Hence the number of green markers provides a visual impression of the strength of support anchoring
each linkage group. Black BACs are congruent with linkage mapping results for chromosome, but the ordering of markers is incongruent by a large
distance (compare Figure 2 and Additional data file 4). Red BACS are incongruent (that is, the linkage mapping results and FISH identify different
chromosomes). Red BACs on the same chromosome always matched to markers from different linkage groups, thus displaying a random pattern of
mismatching. The blue BACs 15A15.TJ and 11A15, 15B18 indicate potential positions for the orphan markers sc117 and LG8 that were not incorporated
into the linkage groups. BACs followed by TJ or TV indicate that only 1 BAC end matched correctly. TJ and TV refer to the two different BAC ends that
could be sequenced and follow the naming convention given in GenBank. The BACs followed by a (Z) on chromosome Z indicate BACs that match to Zspecific scaffolds. The assignment of LG9 to chromosome 5 is tentative as there was only one congruent and one incongruent marker. The inset figure
illustrates 1 of 16 scaffolds where markers on the same scaffold mapped to different linkage groups. The schematic of Smp_scaff000004 (2.21 Mb) shows
the relative positions of two FISH markers (BAC 11C10 and Smox1) and two linkage markers (sc3 and sc3b). Both sets of markers suggest that this
scaffold was incorrectly assembled (see Figure 2 for the FISH result of Smox1).

higher female autosomal recombination rate. It is plausible
that the higher female recombination rates in the pseudoautosomal regions that border the Z-specific region may be a
mechanistic consequence of limited areas for chiasma formation between the Z and W chromosomes in female meioses.
Consistent with this idea, we observed potential hot spots of
recombination on either side of sc85c that occur in female but
not male meioses. Estimated recombination frequencies
between sc68 and sc85c, and sc85c and sc64 were 8 and 10%
in the male, respectively. In the female, they were 80 and 88%
(Figure 5a.). Further support for these recombination hot
spots comes from the presence of 18 double recombinant genotypes (from F1 female gametes) that involved sc85c, and 120
pairwise comparisons that show excess recombination (>
60%) between markers in the region from sc208 to sc312 to
markers in the region of sc195 to sc240 (Additional data file
2).

Segregation distortion
Two regions in the linkage map showed strong deviations
from Mendelian inheritance (χ2-test, α = 0.01): 12 markers

between sc300 and sc481 on LG2_ChrZ, and 9 markers
between sc221 and sc26 on LG1_Chr1 (Figures 2 and 5a). The
remaining 222 markers did not deviate from Mendelian
expectations. The 2 regions displayed different patterns of
distortion. From sc481 to sc126 on LG2_ChrZ (Figure 2),
there was an excess of heterozygous genotypes of an allele
from the NMRI female and LE male. From sc305 to sc120,
however, there was a major decrease in the NMRI female
homozygote genotype (only one to six individuals). The pattern on LG1_Chr1 was uniform across loci in having a
decreased NMRI female homozygote genotype and one heterozygote combination, whereas the other heterozygote combination was normal and the LE male homozygote was
increased (Figure 2). It is not uncommon to find genomic
regions with segregation distortion when crossing diverged
populations due to the evolution of coevolved gene complexes
or of incompatible regions [24,30,31]. The NMRI and LE
lines have been separated well over 250 generations in the
laboratory (see Materials and methods). Genetic load from
inbreeding depression that may build up in laboratory maintained lines is another plausible explanation [32]. If loci
between the two regions were interacting (for example, an
allele is deleterious at one locus only in the presence of a particular allele at another locus), we would expect genotypic
associations between markers in the two regions. However,
pairwise comparisons failed to detect any genotypic associations (P > 0.14 in all comparisons). Thus, the cause of distortion at the two regions appears to be independent.

Conclusions

The linkage map complements the genome sequence and
other tools such as RNA interference, and adds to a growing
toolkit for genomic analyses in S. mansoni. We anticipate that
next generation sequencing and rapid single nucleotide polymorphism typing methods will be used to build on the foundation provided by this microsatellite-based map. In
particular, next generation sequencing of single parasite genotypes (rather than pooled individuals from laboratory parasite lines) will allow rapid improvements in the genome
assembly that can be verified by genotyping single nucleotide
polymorphisms in the genetic cross. The combination of these
tools will improve the genome assembly and provide markers
for fine mapping of genes that underlie traits of biological or
biomedical interest. We also foresee that provision of these
tools will invigorate research on this pathogen and attract
researchers from other fields. A great advantage to studying
S. mansoni over other human helminths is that the complete
life cycle can be maintained in the laboratory using mice or
hamsters as the definitive host, thus allowing experimental
investigation of life cycle traits (for example, [15,16,33]). Such
studies have demonstrated that numerous phenotypic traits
of S. mansoni vary within and between parasite populations
and that many of these traits have a genetic basis. Linkage
mapping, utilizing the 5 cM map described here, provides a
means to investigate the underlying basis of traits of medical

and epidemiological relevance, such as virulence, host specificity, and drug resistance. For example, different strains of B.
glabrata and S. mansoni have been shown to have different
compatibilities in terms of infectivity or virulence [15,17].
Drug resistance is a trait of particular biomedical interest and
this trait can readily be measured both in vivo in infected
rodents and in vitro using adult worms maintained in culture
media. Resistance to oxamniquine has been demonstrated as
a double recessive trait in S. mansoni [33], and there is clear
evidence that parasites with increased tolerance to the firstline drug praziquantel occur in natural populations [18].
Linkage mapping will allow identification of the genes
responsible for resistance to these drugs. For mapping the
genes underlying these traits additional crosses will need to
be conducted. The microsatellite markers used for map construction are highly variable, so the majority of markers are
likely to be informative in additional crosses. The map also
has multiple applications for developmental and evolutionary
biology. Provision of hundreds of molecular markers and
recombination parameters will facilitate high resolution population genetic studies of S. mansoni, which will improve our
understanding of transmission patterns in endemic areas.
The S. mansoni linkage map presented expands the genetic
toolkit for S. mansoni, providing opportunities to understand
fundamental features of S. mansoni biology, and opening
doors to new advances in combating this human pathogen.

Materials and methods
Genetic cross
We crossed a NMRI female to an LE male to generate F1 progeny. Subsequently, a male and female from the F1 were
crossed to generate 88 F2 progeny (reared to the adult stage).
The NMRI line originated in the early 1940s from human isolates in Puerto Rico and the LE line was established from a
human isolate in 1965 in Belo Horizonte, Brazil [34]. At each
stage in the cross, we conducted monomiracidial infections of
snails (B. glabrata). Because sex is determined in the zygote
(which develops into a miracidium) by a chromosomal mechanism, monomiracidial infections allowed us to be certain
that we were using single clonal types (that is, single genetic
individuals of the same sex) in the crosses. After 28 days (the
last 3 under darkness), snails were exposed to light to shed

cercariae. Cercariae were sexed with the following protocol.
We collected 20 to 50 cercariae of one clonal genotype from
each infected snail. For DNA extractions, samples were
placed in 50 μl of 5% chelex containing 0.2 mg/ml of proteinase K, incubated for 2 h at 56°C, and boiled at 100°C for 8
minutes. PCR with the W1 primers [35], which are specific to
a repetitive region on the W chromosome in females, was
used to discriminate between males and females. PCR was
performed with 15 μl reactions containing 2.4 μl of extraction
supernatant, 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each
dNTP, 0.4 μM of each primer, and 0.75 units (0.15 μl) Taq
DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Otsu, Shiga, Japan).
PCR cycling was 95°C for 3 minutes, once; 94°C for 45 s, 54°C
for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s, 35 times; 72°C for 7 minutes, once.
Because this test depends on the failed amplification in males,
we ran a concurrent PCR under the same conditions with the
autosomal locus sc18 (see Additional data file 1 for primers)
to ensure that the DNA had successfully been extracted from
each sample. Results were visualized on a 2% agarose gel containing GelStar® nucleic acid gel stain (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).
Upon identification of gender, snails were shed again to collect cercariae for infections. We exposed a hamster to 300
female cercariae (one genetic individual) and 300 male cercariae (one genetic individual) for the parental cross. After 45
days, the hamster was euthanized and perfused to collect
adult worms. Eggs were collected from the liver and hatched
under light to obtain miracidia for the next generation of
monomiracidial snail infections. This process was repeated to
stage the F1 cross. In the F2 generation we reared worms to
the adult stage in mice (BALB/c). Mice were exposed to 200
female cercariae (one genetic individual) and 200 male cercariae (one genetic individual) or with 200 cercariae of a single sex. F2 worms were collected from mice after 40 days.

Microsatellite markers and genotyping

Linkage map construction

Microsatellite markers were designed from the largest 283
supercontigs in version 3.0 of the genome assembly. These
283 supercontigs account for 72% of sequence data in version
3.1 of the genome assembly (available from the Sanger Institute [36]). The difference in the two versions is only the
removal of approximately 720 kb of sequence in version 3.1,
most of which (703 kb) was a single supercontig that was
removed. The major change was the renaming of supercontigs to scaffolds without change to the actual sequence data.
We provide this information in Additional data file 1. Markers
were selected from a masked copy of the genome to avoid
placing markers in repetitive DNA. Tandem Repeats Finder
version 4 [37] was used to search the contigs for microsatellite
repeats. Only perfect di- and trinucleotide repeats were
selected. Primer 3.0 [38] was used to design all primers with
an annealing temperature of 54 to 56°C.

We used JoinMap [22] both to assign markers to linkage
groups and then to order markers on each linkage group. The
F1 parents and F2 offspring were coded according to the CP
population type, a population resulting from a cross between
two heterogeneously heterozygous and homozygous diploid
parents. We input the phase of the F1 genotypes based on the
genotypes of the grandparents. Z-specific markers, which
were identified by the fact that all females were hemizygous
with an allele inherited from their male parent, were coded as
nnxnp (F1 female × F1 male). We generated a sex-combined
map irrespective of whether the locus was informative in one
or both of the F1 parents.

We used the M13(-21) method for genotyping [39]. The M13(21) oligonucleotide was added to the 5' end of each forward
primer. We also 'pig-tailed' the reverse primers by adding
GTTTCTT to the 5' ends [40]. PCR was performed in 5 μl reactions containing 15 ng of genome amplified template, 1× PCR
buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.08 μM of the
forward primer, 0.16 μM of the reverse primer, 0.16 μM of the
fluorescent labeled M13(-21) primer, and 0.15 units (0.03 μl)
Taq DNA polymerase. PCR cycling was 94°C for 5 minutes,
once; 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 45 s, 65°C for 45 s, 30 times;
94°C for 30 s, 53°C for 45 s, 65°C for 45 s, 8 times; 65°C for 10
minutes, once. PCR products were run on an ABI 3100 with
Genescan software and scored using Genotyper (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). LIZ500 size standard
(Applied Biosystems) was used for all loci. All traces were visually examined and checked for correct peak labeling.
All loci are named for the supercontig (version 3.0 of the
genome assembly) on which they reside. Additional data file 1
provides the cross reference information to the scaffold (version 3.1 of the genome assembly) that the markers are on. In
addition, Additional data file 1 provides the information on
repeat motifs, primer sequences, linkage map positions, scaffold (version 3.1) length, physical position of the microsatellite repeat motif on the scaffold (version 3.1), and physical
positions of the flanking sequences used to design primers.
Marker names with lower case letters indicate that more than
one marker was placed on that supercontig. This lettering
does not indicate physical ordering of markers on supercontigs. For example, sc5, sc5b, sc5c, and sc5d are all markers on
Supercontig_0000005 (Smp_scaff000005), but not necessarily in that physical order. For simplicity, we abbreviate
marker names in the text (for example, sc5b); however, the
names are written in full in the figure maps and tables to facilitate queries that match the genome database. A list of the 37

Assignment and ordering of markers to linkage groups
Overall, there was strong support for each linkage group and
the ordering of markers within each linkage group (Additional data file 2). Linkage groups were formed at a threshold
pairwise recombination frequency of 30%. This threshold
corresponded to an independence LOD (a description of this
calculation is given in [22]) of 4 or greater for each linkage
group except for LG5_Chr4 (Additional data file 2).
LG5_Chr4 had 25 markers that were grouped at an independence LOD of 10 but markers sc475 and sc173 were not among
them. However, these 2 markers were within the 25% threshold of the pairwise recombination frequency. Visual inspection of the estimated recombination frequencies and FISH
data supported the inclusion of sc475 and sc173 in LG5_Chr4
(Figure 2).
Prior to ordering markers within linkage groups, we identified loci that had 0% recombination with one or more markers. In such cases, we retained only one marker for
subsequent analyses (Additional data file 2), choosing the
locus that was more informative and/or had fewer missing
genotypes. We used the Kosambi mapping function to convert recombination frequencies into map distances. The
regression mapping algorithm with the default settings
(recombination frequency threshold < 0.4, LOD threshold >
1) was used to order loci within each linkage group. On
LG3_Chr2, a reduced stringency (recombination frequency
threshold < 0.49, LOD threshold > 0.1) was needed to include
markers sc54 to sc466 (Additional data file 2). Visual inspection of the estimated recombination frequencies and FISH
data supported the order of these markers. A ripple (all ordering permutations within a moving window of three adjacent
markers) was performed after the addition of each new
marker. When the best position of a marker decreased the
goodness-of-fit too sharply (default jump = 5) or gave rise to
negative distance estimates, the locus was removed. After all
loci are handled once, a second round is made to add previously excluded loci using the added information of all pairwise markers included in the first round. In a third round, all

loci previously removed are added to the map without constraints in order to obtain a general idea about where poorer
fitting loci reside on the map. All linkage groups except
LG2_ChrZ had a single round of mapping. Marker sc193 was
the only marker in LG2_ChrZ that needed a second and third
round. However, FISH data and visual inspection of the estimated recombination frequencies confirmed the relative
position of this marker (Figure 5c). The overall map order can
be evaluated by a goodness-of-fit measure between the direct
pairwise estimates of recombination frequency and the frequencies obtained from the map (using the mapping function). This goodness-of-fit measure is roughly distributed as
chi-square [22]. Mean chi-square values (Chi-square test statistic divided by the degrees of freedom) well below 1 indicate
good support for the ordering of markers [22].

Evaluation of double recombinants and mutations
With the exception of LG2_ChrZ, there were few improbable
genotypes and suspect linkages (Additional data file 2). The
genotype probabilities are calculated conditional on the map
and genotypes of neighboring loci [22]. These probabilities
flag possible double recombinants or possible genotyping
errors [22]. There were 59 genotypes with P ≤ 0.01. We visually re-inspected all genotypes (n = 16) with P ≤ 0.001 and
confirmed that the genotypes were correctly scored. Although
these could represent double recombinants, we cannot rule
out mutation (naturally, genome amplified, or PCR induced)
as a possible cause. For example, one genotype, which had the
only P < 0.0001, showed a double recombinant from both the
male and female meioses. Re-inspection of this genotype
showed that a possible 2 bp mutation in one of the alleles of
this offspring could create this possible pattern. Removal or
'assumed correction' of a subset of these genotypes, including
the latter, had little impact on the loci ordering or on map
length of each linkage group. Thus, we did not remove these
possible double recombinants (< 0.27% of the genotypes in
the data set) from the final analysis. On LG2_ChrZ, 18 of the
25 improbable genotypes involved marker sc85c. In the main
text, we discuss how the regions flanking sc85c represent possible host spots of recombination in the female meioses. Supporting this claim, a large number of suspect linkages (> 60%
recombination) occur on LG2_ChrZ between markers that lie
in the region from sc208 to sc312 with markers in the region
of sc195 to 240.

Estimation of linkage map parameters
To account for the terminal parts of the linkage groups, an
adjusted map length for each linkage group was calculated by
averaging the results from the methods of Fishman et al. [24]
and Chakravarti et al. [23]. The Fishman et al. [24] method
adds twice the average spacing of markers (across the entire
map) to the lengths of each linkage group. Method 4 of
Chakravarti et al. [23] expands each linkage group by (m + 1)/
(m - 1), where m is the number of loci mapped. Formula 14.8
in [14] was used to calculate the expected distance of a gene,
E(m), from the closest of n (= 210) random markers and the

upper 95% confidence interval for this distance. The total
adjusted map length of 1,228.59 cM was used as the estimate
of L. Formula 14.7 in [14], which accounts for linear chromosomes, was in near agreement with formula 14.8, where
94.24% of the genome was within 8.7 cM of a marker assuming a random distribution of markers.

Sex specific recombination and segregation distortion
Parental meioses were examined by creating maternal and
paternal population nodes in JoinMap. We only compared
intervals between homologous loci that generated the same
mapping order as the sex-combined map. Homologous map
distances for all autosomal markers were compared with a
Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test for a difference in male and
female recombination rates. Segregation distortion (nonMendelian inheritance) for all loci was tested in JoinMap (χ2test, α = 0.01). To determine if there were interactions
between the two distorted regions on LG1_Chr1 and
LG2_ChrZ, we tested for an association of genotypes between
pairs of markers from the two regions. We compared each of
the seven mapped markers on LG1_Chr1 from sc221-sc26 to
randomly chosen markers from the region of sc300-sc481 on
LG2_ChrZ (that is, we conducted seven tests). To analyze the
contingency tables of genotypes between loci, we used the
program RxC [41]. RxC employs the metropolis algorithm to
obtain an unbiased estimate of the exact P-value (that is,
Fisher's exact test) for any sized contingency table. The following Markov chain parameters were used to test significance: 2,500 dememorizations, 100 batches, and 2,500
permutations per batch.

Anchoring markers in the linkage map to
chromosomes
Methods for FISH analysis are described in [42]. BAC end
sequences obtained from GenBank (see Additional data file 4
for accession numbers) were used in BLAST searches of the
genome database. We only used BACs that FISH mapped to a
single homologous pair of chromosomes (or Z and W). Linkage groups were anchored to chromosomes by the following.
We first determined if the FISH mapped BAC BLAST
matched to a scaffold. If the scaffold was one in which we had
a mapped microsatellite maker, we considered that marker to
belong on the chromosome to which the BAC was FISH
mapped. Evidence from several of these matches allowed us
to anchor the linkage groups to chromosomes (Additional
data file 4; Figure 3). We also BLAST matched six genes with
known chromosomal locations (Figure 2): 28s rDNA on chromosome 2, eggshell protein genes p14 and p48 on chromosome 2, SmTRα on chromosome 7, and SmHox1 and Smox1
on chromosome 3 [43-47].
