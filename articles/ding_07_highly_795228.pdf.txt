Abstract
Background: Individuals in the same species are assumed to share the same genomic set.
However, it is not unusual to find an orthologous gene only in small subset of the species, and
recent genomic studies suggest that structural rearrangements are very frequent between genomes
in the same species. Two recently sequenced rice genomes Oryza sativa L. var. Nipponbare and O.
sativa L. var. 93-11 provide an opportunity to systematically investigate the extent of the gene
repertoire polymorphism, even though the genomic data of 93-11 derived from whole-short-gun
sequencing is not yet as complete as that of Nipponbare.
Results: We compared gene contents and the genomic locations between two rice genomes. Our
conservative estimates suggest that at least 10% of the genes in the genomes were either under
presence/absence polymorphism (5.2%) or asymmetrically located between genomes (4.7%). The
proportion of these "asymmetric genes" varied largely among gene groups, in which disease
resistance (R) genes and the RLK kinase gene group had 11.6 and 7.8 times higher proportion of
asymmetric genes than housekeeping genes (Myb and MADS). The significant difference in the
proportion of asymmetric genes among gene groups suggests that natural selection is responsible
for maintaining genomic asymmetry. On the other hand, the nucleotide diversity in 17 R genes
under presence/absence polymorphism was generally low (average nucleotide diversity = 0.0051).
Conclusion: The genomic symmetry was disrupted by 10% of asymmetric genes, which could
cause genetic variation through more unequal crossing over, because these genes had no allelic
counterparts to pair and then they were free to pair with homologues at non-allelic loci, during
meiosis in heterozygotes. It might be a consequence of diversifying selection that increased the
structural divergence among genomes, and of purifying selection that decreased nucleotide
divergence in each R gene locus.

Background
One usually expects that a gene found in an individual can
be found in the others in the same species [1]. This expectation is based on an assumption of "stable" or "symmetric" genome structure within species. In human, for
example, nucleotide sequences are highly identical
among haplotypes [2]. However, recent genomic comparisons revealed that chromosomal rearrangements are
quite common even within species [3]. Such rearrangements include insertion/deletion (indel), duplication and
transposition. Some of the rearrangements contain more
than 100 kb DNA [4]. Large rearrangements can produce
either paralogous gene copies or indel polymorphisms of
gene copy numbers. We define such genes as "asymmetric
genes", which are located in insertion DNA, either present
only in one genome (presence/absence, or P/A genes. Red
genes in Figure 1) or located on different regions between
genomes compared (asymmetrically located, or AL genes.
Magenta genes in Figure 1). The mobilization of gene fragments from one location of the genome to another by
Helitrons and the tandem gene amplifications following
the whole-genome-duplication event are revealed to be
general mechanisms for the insertion of noncollinear
gene sequences in maize [5,6].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/154

While mechanisms of these rearrangements have been
extensively studied (e.g., [7,8]), little is known about the
biological significance of asymmetric genes on genome
evolution. Comparative studies on human genomes
reveal a high level of variations in gene copy number and
the resulting loss of gene products often cause genetic disease [4,9], indicating an evolutionary importance of
asymmetric genes. In plants, indels of disease resistance
(R) genes result in resistant and susceptible phenotypes to
the infection of pathogens [10,11], and are subject to natural selection [12,13]. In addition, there are lines of evidence that indels play an important role in phenotypes of
individuals in several ways, including an altered gene
expression [14,15] and a noncollinearity in heterosis [1].
Gene duplication is another source of genetic variation
[3,4]. A gene duplicated through a Helitron in some
inbred lines of maize has been found to have an intact
coding sequence, which is likely expressed conditionally
[16]. These studies suggest that the asymmetrically existed
or located genes may be an important molecular basis of
many inheritable phenomena.
Yu et al. [17] found a relatively low proportion of P/A
genes (2.2–3.3%) and a high proportion of intergenic

An example of sequence comparison between two rice lines, Nipponbare and 93-11. The region of 6,070,001–
6,629,564 bp on chromosome 11 (based on IRGSP database) is shown. These 683 kb consecutive sequences, sampled around
R gene clusters, were aligned between Nipponbare (559,563 bp) and 93-11 (428,114 bp). Dotted line represents where a
sequence in one line cannot be aligned with a sequence at the corresponding position in the other line. Genes are shown as
square boxes pointing in the direction of transcription. This region contains 70 non-TE genes in Nipponbare and 62 in 93-11.
53 allelic non-TE genes are colored as green, 8 P/A as red, 4 P/Ad as orange, 14 AL as magenta, and 30 TE genes as blue boxes.
All R genes are labeled above or below the boxes. The sizes of genes, intergenic sequences, and indels are proportionally scaled
down. In this region, the PAG is 30.7%, and the percentage of asymmetric genes is 39.4% ((8 P/A +4 P/Ad +14 AL)/66).

nucleotide sequences that could not be aligned between
two rice genomes, whereas Morgante et al. [18] found that
20% of genes are not shared between two inbred lines in
maize. These results indicated that the proportion and the
composition of asymmetric genes varied among species. A
part of the reason, however, might be a different level of
criteria used for detecting the asymmetric genes.
In this study, we comprehensively addressed the genomic
asymmetry between two rice genomes, Oryza sativa L. var.
Nipponbare and O. sativa L. var. 93-11, including both P/
A and AL genes. The comparison of whole-genome
sequences provided new insights into this issue. To investigate the proportion of asymmetric genes among
intraspecific genomes, we systematically compared gene
contents and locations between the two rice genomes.
Furthermore, the proportions of asymmetric genes in four
gene groups (R genes, the RLK kinase gene group, and two
house-keeping gene groups, Myb and MADS) were examined to understand the evolution of asymmetric genes.

Results
Asymmetric genes between two rice genomes
Our selection of 2400 indica contigs contained 39.6 Mb
non-overlapping sequences accounting for 10% of the
whole rice genome (see Methods). Excluding doubtful
contigs with possible misassembly or transposable elements (TE), 2094 contigs containing 34.4 Mb of 93-11
sequences were aligned with 34.7 Mb of Nipponbare
sequences in total (Table 1). We counted all the indels of
> 1 kb in the two genomes, and found 2.29 Mb inserts
(6.6%) in Nipponbare and 1.78 Mb (5.2%) in 93-11. To
reflect the proportion of DNA in the chromosomes that
could not pair in meiosis in the heterozygote, the propor-

tion of asymmetric genome (PAG) was defined as the total
indel size divided by an average length of total DNA in the
two genomes. The total PAG in 4.1 Mb of the two
genomes was 11.8%. Based on TIGR or BGIs annotation
[19,20], 132 and 197 functional genes were found in
addition to 206 and 38 TE-related genes in Nipponbare
and 93-11, respectively (Table 1; details in Table S1). A
large portion (70.8% = 233/329, Table 1, 2) of the non-TE
genes had motifs with known function (data not shown).
To distinguish the P/A genes from AL genes, all the asymmetric genes identified were subjected to the Blast search
in the two genomes. Here we defined the P/A gene as an
asymmetric gene for which no gene homologue of more
than 20% gene coverage was found in another genome by
the Blast search with the e value threshold < 0.10. If we
found that a gene had an unequal number of homologues
between genomes (e.g., 2 in Nipponbare and 3 in 93-11),
the extra gene was categorized as a P/A duplicate (P/Ad).
The rest of asymmetric genes were defined as AL genes.
Among the 329 non-TE genes, we identified 82 P/A, 91 P/
Ad and 156 AL genes (Table 2). The regularly sampled contigs allowed us to estimate a total of 3703 asymmetric
genes between genomes (based on 389 Mb in the whole
japonica genome; [21]), including 923 P/A, 1024 P/Ad and
1756 AL genes. In total of 37544 non-TE genes in the
japonica genome [21], the estimated percentages of P/A, P/
Ad, and AL genes are predicted to be 2.5%, 2.7%, and
4.7% between genomes, respectively. Namely, about 10%
of the rice genes were asymmetric genes in the genomes.
Note that the percentage of P/A genes was about a half of
the estimate by Yu et al. (5.5% = 2.2% + 3.3%; [17]), suggesting that our estimation was very conservative.

Potential biases involved in the estimation of P/A-gene
number
To verify the proportion of asymmetric genes and their
function using the newly-updated quality sequence and
annotation [17,22], entire chromosome 10 assemblies of
japonica (22.7 Mb, in August 2005) and indica genomes
were chosen to perform the same analysis by two different
criteria (see Methods for details). By the same criterion as
used above, we found 9.1% of asymmetric genes in the
total of 2741 genes in chromosome 10 (2.7% P/A, 3.8%
P/Ad, and 2.6% AL genes on different chromosomes, not
including possible P/Ad and AL genes on the same chro-

mosome), confirming that our original estimates were
reasonable (Table 2 and Table S1). Note that an asymmetric gene was identified only when no single piece of
homologous sequence was found for > 20% gene coverage at the genome-wide Blast search with e value < 0.10 by
this criterion.
In the second criterion, on the other hand, a homologous
sequence was accepted when nucleotide similarity of
entire homologous genes from two genomes was > 60%
(CDS size ranges 150–7653 bp, 1048 bp on average). This
quantitative criterion allowed us to precisely define an

asymmetric gene. By this criterion, we could not find
homologous sequences for some genes for which homologous sequences were found by the first criterion, and
hence identified a higher percentage of asymmetric genes
(13.0%), including 4.5% P/A, 5.0% P/Ad, and 3.5% AL
genes (not including possible P/Ad and AL genes on the
same chromosome, Table 2 and Table S1).
To evaluate potential bias in the result obtained by the
second criterion, several factors were addressed. First, the
sequence similarity was examined for all of the 50 P/A
genes that had 20–45% homologous sequences in the
other genome by the Blast search. This analysis revealed
that these genes had no homologues with > 60% similarity for the entire gene sequences in the other genome,
indicating that they are truly different genes and are
present/absent between genomes.
Second, potential biases of TE-related genes were examined. Although we only used non-TE genes that were
determined by Yuan et al. [22] in this study, all 355 asymmetric and 246 randomly-selected symmetric genes on
chromosome 10 were examined in a local repeat database
following Bennetzen et al. ([23]; see Methods for details)
in order to confirm that they are truly non-TE genes. Both
TE and non-TE genes might contain small parts of similar
motifs or sequences. Therefore, the total proportion of TErelated fragments found in a gene was used to evaluate
how many TE homologous sequences were contained in
these genes. We found no significant difference of TE component between the asymmetric and symmetric genes
(Table S2; χ2Nipponbare = 15.6 and χ293-11 = 15.8, both p >
0.10). This analysis indicated no bias in containing TE
homologous sequences between asymmetric and symmetric genes.
Third, we systematically evaluated the precision of the
estimation of asymmetric-gene number. Our alignments
of chromosome 10 in 93-11 by BLASTZ [24] covered
67.7% of Nipponbare sequences, which was close to the
coverage 67.0% by International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (hereafter IRGSP; [21]). All genes in the alignable regions were symmetric except for a few AL genes
(probably because of inversion or translocation on the
same chromosome). In the remaining 32.3% of chromosome 10 in Nipponbare, 9.8% was identified as indel
sequences (9.8% in Nipponbare and 15.3% in 93-11).
Another 18.9% were non-alignable regions (Table S3; see
Methods for definitions), which were presumably indels,
too. The other 3.6% included 0.5% indels which were < 1
kb in both Nipponbare and 93-11, 0.2% filling DNA and
2.9% with unsequenced gaps in 93-11.
Fourth, we compared the gene percentages with empirically-validated genes, the expressed or functional genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/154

(with EST or conserved motifs), between symmetric and
asymmetric genes. A similar percentage (about 70%) was
observed, which suggested that the 'real' genes showed the
same pattern in both symmetric and asymmetric genes.
Finally, to examine a possibility of overestimating the P/
A-gene number due to un-sequenced gaps of genomes, we
checked all 82 P/A genes that have small pieces of homologous sequences in the Blast search. If a homologous
piece was not included in a gene or a contig of another
genome, this piece was likely to be located in a gap. If a
piece was included in a gene or contig, on the other hand,
this gene was likely true P/A genes, based on the fact that
97.7% of genes could be found in at least one piece in
either 93-11 or Nipponbare [17]. Only six P/A genes were
found to be in the first category (not likely a true P/A). All
these results suggested that the real proportion of asymmetric genes in rice genomes was probably > 10%, and
particularly that the asymmetric DNA was likely > 20%,
whereas there were both under- and over-estimating factors for the proportion of asymmetric genes.
In addition, the sequence comparison between GLA4 (an
indica variety with BAC-based sequences available in chromosome 4, [25]) and Nipponbare (2.2 Mb) also provided
an estimate of a 20.6% (449.9 kb) of indels (> 1 kb) and
43 non-TE genes in indels (or 12.5% asymmetric genes),
which again showed a similar rate of asymmetric DNA (or
genes) between rice genomes.
Variation of asymmetric genes among gene groups
A gene that has essential functions to the organism will be
conserved in a genome by natural selection. For genes that
have functions to cope with the variable environmental
factors (e.g., the genes to recognize the highly variable
molecules of pathogens), on the other hand, different
gene compositions may be preferable among genomes
[26,27]. If this is the case, the amount of asymmetric
genes may vary among gene groups with different functions.

To find out the distributions of asymmetric genes among
different gene groups, four gene groups were selected for a
genome-wide analysis between Nipponbare and 93-11.
One was the R genes representing gene groups under
diversifying selection [26,28] and possibly with high proportions of asymmetric genes [26]. Another was the RLK
genes containing a functional cytoplasmic kinase domain
and playing roles in diverse processes in growth and
development [29]. The other two were house-keeping
gene groups, Myb and MADS, which were involved in
plant development and cell cycle regulation [30,31]. In R
genes, 483 genes from 93-11 and 461 genes from Nipponbare were identified including 105 P/A (62 in 93-11 and
43 in Nipponbare), 42 P/Ad (21 in 93-11 and 21 in Nip-

ponbare), and 116 AL (58 in each genome) genes (Table
S1). These were 22.2%, 8.9%, and 24.6% of R genes,
respectively. 319 RLK genes included 17 (5.3%) P/A and
102 (32.0%) AL genes. On the other hand, 208 Myb and
MADS included only 6 (2.9%) P/A and 4 (1.9%) AL
genes. In total, 55.7% of R genes, 37.3% of RLK, and 4.8%
of housekeeping genes were asymmetric. Comparing with
the genome-wide average of the asymmetric structure
(9.9%), these percentages were 5.6 times higher in R genes
and 3.8 times higher in RLK genes, whereas housekeeping
genes showed a lower percentage of asymmetry (48% of
the genome-wide average). R genes and RLK genes had
11.6 and 7.8 times higher proportions of asymmetric
genes than housekeeping genes in rice genomes. These
differences were highly significant (χ2 = 119, p < 10-5),
suggesting that the proportion of asymmetric genes is not
at random and affected by natural selection.
The extremely high proportion of asymmetric R genes
could also be demonstrated by the 0.6 Mb consecutive
sequences (Figure 1), which contained two R gene clusters. Sequence comparison at this region on chromosome
11 (560 kb in Nipponbare and 428 kb in 93-11) demonstrated the genomic arrangement of asymmetric genes,
which revealed 30.7% of PAG and 39.4% of asymmetric
genes in this region.
Origin of asymmetric genes
Indels can be generated by unequal crossing-over in clustered genes [32] or by insertion of transposable elements
[5,33]. The genes generated by different factors will show
different makeup of asymmetric genes. For example, Morgante et al. [18] showed that many of the asymmetric
makeup were caused by the activity of nonautonomous
helitrons, whereas Jiang et al. [34] described that the gene
fragments were ferried around the rice genome by transposition. Therefore, the proportion of clustered (including tandemly-arranged) or TE-related genes among
asymmetric genes could provide clues for the origin of
asymmetric DNA. To address this issue, we grouped asymmetric genes into clustered and non-clustered genes or
single and multigene families (Table 2; see Methods for
definitions). The percentage of clustered asymmetric
genes in total asymmetric genes was only 2.4% (4/169) in
Nipponbare chromosome 10. This percentage was much
smaller than 11.0% (284/2572), the number of clustered
allelic genes divided by that of total allelic genes in the
same chromosome (Table 2). Similarly, this percentage
was not high in 93-11 chromosome 10 (4.3% = 8/186)
and in genome-wide samples (10.6% = 35/329, Table 2).
Among gene groups, however, the percentages varied
largely. The percentage of clustered genes was 69.2% in
asymmetric genes and 38.9% in allelic genes in R genes,
whereas these percentages were 63.9% and 41.8% in RLK,
and 0% and 11.0% in housekeeping genes. The same

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/154

trend was observed in the comparisons between the percentage of multigenes in asymmetric genes and that of
allelic genes (Table 2). These were 30.4% and 10.3% in R
genes, 53.8% and 37.5% in RLK, and 20.0% and 13.0% in
housekeeping genes. These results indicated the clustered
genes (or genes in multigene families), which were presumably created by duplication, did not particularly contribute to the composition of asymmetric genes in entire
genomes but might contribute to the composition of
some specific gene groups.
Obviously, TE-related genes composed a major part
(60.9% = 206/338) of asymmetric genes in Nipponbare
(Table 1). This percentage was twice as much of 27.4%,
the portion of TE-related genes (14196; [19]) amongst the
total genes in this genome, suggesting that the asymmetric
DNA (inserted DNA) in Nipponbare may be a part of
genome expansion caused by repeat-elements. This percentage was very different in 93-11 (16.2%, Table 1). The
low percentage in 93-11 indicated that the evolutionary
importance of TE elements in asymmetric DNA might
vary among genomes. However, this percentage might be
biased because of the shot-gun sequencing strategy and
the selected long contigs in 93-11, which would lead to
the enrichment of less repetitive regions in 93-11.
Variation of P/A-R genes among populations
We used the R gene group to verify the existence of P/A
genes among rice populations. The genotyping of 18 O.
sativa lines and 2 O. rufipogon ecotypes from worldwide
populations confirmed that all of the 17 P/A genes were
under the present/absent polymorphism. The presence-

allele frequencies varied largely (20–80%, Table 3), as
also shown in Arabidopsis [13]. Phylogenetic analysis
showed no sign of geographic differentiation and
japonica-indica sub-specific differentiation (Figure 2).
These results suggested that the high proportion of asymmetric R genes observed between 93-11 and Nipponbare
was commonly asymmetric in rice populations. Interestingly, 3 of the 8 single genes (37.5%) found both in Nipponbare and 93-11 (Table 3) were not fixed among the
other lines, suggesting that even more R genes can be P/A
genes among populations.
The average nucleotide diversity among alleles in rice lines
for 17 P/A-R genes was 0.0051 (0–0.048, Table 3). Majority of P/A-R genes showed very low genetic diversity. In
two related species (O. officinalis and O. meyeriana, Table
3), most of the P/A genes (12/17) could not be found
(Table 3). The other 5 genes, which could be found in
these species as inter-specific orthologs, showed extremely
low nucleotide diversities among rice lines (0.0008 on
average, Table 3).
Although a failure of detecting PCR products did not necessarily mean an absence of homologous gene, there were
three reasons to believe that R gene homologues were
really missing in some lines. First, two positive controls
(multi-R genes and non-R genes), one with higher nucleotide diversity and another with a similar level of diversity,
always succeeded in detecting PCR products (Table 3).
Second, most of the selected R genes represented low
genetic diversities (0.0051 on average), indicating that
these genes were not highly variable. Finally, we tried
multiple PCR methods with lower stringencies for amplification (see Methods for details) when PCR products
were not detected in some strains. Thus, at least most of
the cases, these R genes must be under the presence/
absence polymorphism in this species.

Discussion
Estimation and significance of asymmetric genes in plant
Our manual alignments of sequences allowed us to estimate 5.2% P/A (including P/Ad) and 4.7% AL genes
between two rice genomes. These must be underestimations because of our conservative methods. Our analysis
on the chromosome 10 provided a good example, in
which 9.5% P/A genes (4.5% of P/A and 5.0% of P/Ad)
were identified, and AL genes could be more than 10%.
The 3.5% AL genes identified in different chromosomes
did not include the AL genes on the same chromosome
(5.2%; 67 in Nipponbare and 75 in 93-11, data not
shown) and the undetermined genes (3.1%; 86 these
genes in Table 2, in which no counterpart could be identified in current database). Though some of these AL genes
could not be precisely determined by current sequence
data, there was a good reason to assume that the majority

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/154

of them were asymmetric genes. Therefore, the total percentage of AL genes could be > 10%.
The significant proportion of asymmetric genes identified
in this study was well consistent with the results from previous studies. For example, the percentage of P/A genes
(4.5%) was close to that of P/A genes identified by Yu et
al. (5.5%; [17]), and our results for the proportion of
asymmetric genes (13.0%) and asymmetric DNA (> 20%)
was comparable to the higher proportion (25%) of asymmetric DNA indicated between these two genomes [17].
The 2.1 and 2.2 Mb map-based BAC cloning sequences
between rice cultivar GLA4 and Nipponbare revealed a
20.6% of indels (> 1 kb) and 12.5% asymmetric genes in
indels. The dramatic structural differences between maize
inbred lines were also found in the bz [1] and z1C
genomic region [15]. Although the DNA-sequence noncollinearity in these regions has been attributed to retrotransposon insertions due to the gain of pseudogenes
from another donor site in the genome [35,36], the
genome-wide survey suggested that there are up to 10,000
P/A genes in maize genomes [18]. Furthermore, large variations in genome size were evident within many species.
For example, DNA content varied up to 10% among Arabidopsis populations [37], 12% between soybean lines
[38], and 50% between maize lines [39]. In the alignable
rice genome sequences, the total size of DNA segments
slightly varied at 1.0% (34.66 vs. 34.46 Mb) or 5.6%
(2.245 vs. 2.125 Mb) between Nipponbare and 93-11 or
GLA4. However the PAG ranged from 11.8% to 20.6%
between rice genomes. These results indicated that the
high PAG within species was common in plants.
It was obvious that single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were important in genetic variation [40]. However, the proportion of SNP in a genome was much
smaller than PAG. For example in the homologous
sequences of Nipponbare and GLA4, PAG was 53 times
higher than the proportion of SNP (0.39%; [25]) in the
same region. Although it did not necessarily reflect a relative biological importance of SNPs to PAG, PAG could
contribute to unpaired homologous chromosome segments in meiosis in heterozygotes, and hence to genomic
reorganizations that had large impacts on genomic evolution [41]. This was a similar effect to 'hybrid-dysfunction'
at the level of chromosomal rearrangement [42]. The estimated number of asymmetric genes in total (3703) was
remarkably large among rice genomes, and the number
among maize genomes was probably even larger [18,39].
Our analyses on the gene groups suggested that the asymmetric genes were affected by natural selection, and were
probably playing important roles in many inheritable
phenomena, such as heterosis, inbreed depression, and
disease resistance [1,10,11].

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:154

The noncollinearity of z1C gene cluster among maize
inbred lines provides a good example. The same genomic
interval containing this gene cluster among lines significantly lost their gene collinearity and also differed in the
regulation of each remaining gene set [5,14,15]. The alteration of expression patterns led to an effect of "overdominance" which could contribute to a heterosis
phenomenon. Given the fact that chromosomes could
consist of intervals of haplotypes that are highly diverged,
endless breeding opportunities could be predicted,
because of their linear arrangement along a chromosome
and their expression potential in hybrid combinations
[5,14,15]. The altered gene expression in hybrids by such
noncollinearity could promote neofunctionalization.
Maintenance of asymmetric genes
The high proportion of asymmetric genes in genomes
could be simply driven by the random genetic drift. Thus,
the presence/absence polymorphism itself could be only
a transit stage. If this was the case, the origin of the polymorphism must be relatively young [43]. In this scenario,
evolutionary rates of asymmetric genes must be similar
among different gene groups. On the other hand, if the
polymorphism was maintained by diversifying selection,
as suggested in R genes in Arabidopsis [12,13], the origin of
the polymorphism must be old and the evolutionary rate
could be different among gene groups. The age of the polymorphism in P/A genes could be estimated by examining
the level of nucleotide diversity among rice lines relative
to the level of genetic divergence between species [44].
The nucleotide diversities in the 17 P/A-R genes was generally low (π = 0–0.048, average 0.0051). The low genetic
diversities for majority of the observed genes indicated
that these genes were either young or under purifying
selection. If the P/A-R genes were duplicated relatively
recently, similar paralogs should be found in the
genomes. However, no similar paralogs for any P/A-R
genes were found based on a conserved NBS region in Rgenes either in Nipponbare or in 93-11 (data not shown),
indicating that young duplications cannot explain the
abundance of P/A-R genes. The old P/A-R genes with low
nucleotide diversity might be a consequence of diversifying selection that preferred a large numbers of diverse P/
A-R genes for plant-pathogen interaction, and of purifying
selection that suppressed nucleotide diversities by functional constraint on each P/A-R genes. Rpm1, the first discovered P/A-R gene in Arabidopsis [10], was a good
example. This gene was genetically almost identical
between populations, but still appeared to be under presence/absence polymorphism in distantly-related species
[44]. Due to its highly conserved sequence and ancient
origin, Rpm1 was believed to be under purifying selection
on gene itself and under balancing selection to maintain
a stable frequency among populations [12,44].

Evolutionary dynamics of asymmetric genes
Ceaseless insertion, deletion, translocation and unequal
recombination will contribute to the increase of asymmetric DNA. Any of these genomic rearrangements will create
higher-level of intraspecific violations of genetic collinearity [5]. The asymmetric DNA may have a self-enhancing
mechanism by generating instability in a heterozygote
because the free DNA has higher chances to pair selectively with homologues at non-allelic loci (or paralogs). A
higher rate of unequal crossing-over could be the consequence. In a heterozygote such as the hybrid between Nipponbare and 93-11, there are 55.7% of R genes that has no
orthologous alleles to pair with during meiosis, and the
high rate of unpaired DNA would increase the asymmetric
DNA through the high-frequency unequal crossing-over.
The other factors, such as inbreeding, fixation and gene
loss, and purifying selection, may also contribute to the
genomic symmetry. On the other hand, the genomic
asymmetry must be balanced with genetic stability.
Although it is no doubt that vast majority of symmetric
alleles are the basis of stable inheritance, the asymmetric
architecture of genomes should also be a core of genetic
variation and genomic evolution. The ratio of symmetric
to asymmetric DNA in genomes may reflect the balance
between stable inheritance and variation required for the
species.

Methods
Alignment of genomic sequences
In the database of 93-11 genome [20], the large pieces of
sequences available as of October 2004 were the contig 1–
10000, ranging from 8–60 kb in length [45]. To obtain the
contigs with full ranges in sizes of > 8 kb, we chose 2400
contigs with the number of 1–240 in last three digits. Each
of the selected contigs was subjected to BLASTN search (e
value threshold < 0.10) against Nipponbare genome. The
contigs with no hit in the Blast search were excluded to
avoid any possible misassembly, as we could not determine their locations. The rest of the contigs was aligned
with their Nipponbare counterparts manually by
Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor MI). When
an indel (> 1 kb) was present in an alignment, Clustal X
[46] was used to exclude any alignment error. When the
end sequence of a contig could not align with its Nipponbare sequence, it was excluded to avoid any possible misassembly in 93-11. 2.1 Mb and 2.2 Mb map-based BAC
cloning sequences in GenBank for rice cultivar GLA4 [25]
and Nipponbare, respectively, were also used to exclude
any other misassembly.
Gene annotation and data analysis
Genes in insertion sequences were identified based on the
annotation of TIGR or BGIs. All non-TE genes were examined in the local repeat database, based on Oryza Repeat
Database [47], using BLASTN searches as described by

Page 9 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:154

Bennetzen et al. [23] to detect any TE sequences in the
coding region of genes. After removing the TE-related
genes, the association of genes were performed using
GOst [48] to find out their ontologies. The CDS of each
predicted gene in inserts was searched for homologues in
the local database of whole Nipponbare and 93-11
genomic sequences using BLASTN (e value threshold <
0.10).
Identification of asymmetric genes on chromosome 10
Two methods were used to identify the asymmetric genes
on chromosome 10. In the first method, all non-TE genes
on chromosome 10 (annotated by TIGR; [22]) and complete sequences in this chromosome of Nipponbare [19]
and 93-11 [20] were included into our local database on
August 2005. Each CDS of these genes was used for crossblast searches (e value threshold < 0.10) in the local
sequence database of Nipponbare and 93-11. If a gene in
a genome had sequence counterparts (> 20% in length in
total) for its CDS in another genome, this gene was determined to have an allele in another genome. If no counterparts (or < 20% in length in total) were found in another
genome or in chromosome 10 of another genome, this
gene was identified as an asymmetric gene. Then all asymmetric genes were subjected to the Blast search against all
genomic sequences (including syngenta database) to find
out whether the gene was a P/A, P/Ad or AL gene by its copies in either one or both of these genomes.

In the second method, the complete sequences of chromosome 10 in Nipponbare (22.68 Mb covering 96.6% of
euchromatic regions; [21]) and 93-11 (20.7 Mb) were
aligned by BLASTZ [24]. This program is designed for
identifying orthologous regions and for alignments of
long genomic sequences. We used the same scoring matrix
as the one used for pairwise alignments of human and
chimpanzee [24]. To minimize false-positive alignments,
only alignments with > 300 bp were maintained and any
> 300 bp non-alignable region remained as gap. The
search for asymmetric genes focused on the non-alignable
regions. Two overlapping strategies were used for crosssearch. First we tried to identify the true insertions (> 1 kb)
in both genomes. If the sequences flanking an insertion of
Nipponbare matched an unbroken sequence of 93-11 and
the filling DNA (the non-alignable region) in 93-11 was <
1 kb, or vice versa, an insertion was defined (Table S3).
The other non-alignable regions (> 1 kb in both genomes)
could not be determined as insertions (named as nonalignable regions). Second, all the CDS of genes in insertions and non-alignable regions were subjected to the
Blast search (e value threshold < 0.10) against the whole
genome sequences of Nipponbare (both IRGSP and syngenta database) and 93-11. If no counterpart in blast
search was found, or the total length of counterparts was
< 50% of the CDS and the nucleotide similarity of entire

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/154

counterpart gene was < 60%, it was assigned as a P/A gene.
The P/Ad or AL was determined by their copies in either or
both of these genomes by the same criteria as used for P/
A genes.
Identification of four gene groups
NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat)
genes, a common type of R genes [27], were chosen to represent the most polymorphic R-group [26]. The genes
encoding a cytoplasmic serine/threonine (ser/thr) protein
kinase, a single-pass transmembrane domain and an
extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain were defined as
RLK gene group [49]. MADS and Myb genes contained
either MADS-box or Myb domain, both of which were
DNA binding domains [30,31]. The same methods as
Yang et al. [50] were employed to identify the R genes in
genomes of rice cultivars, Nipponbare and 93-11. Each R
gene with its flanking sequences was subjected to the Blast
search against genomic sequences of both 93-11 and Nipponbare to find out all the possible homologues (< 30%
nucleotide diversity) and to locate their physical positions
in chromosomes. Homologous sequences were manually
aligned by Sequencher v.4.1. The methods employed to
identify genes in the groups of RLK, Myb and MADS were
as described in Shiu and Bleecker [49], Davidson et al.
[30], and Parenicova et al. [31].
Identification of gene clusters and gene families
We defined a clustered gene if two or more homologous
genes resided within 80 kb. A criterion, < 30% of nucleotide diversity, was used to define homologues within a
family. Each asymmetric gene was subjected to the Blast
search against the local database of Nipponbare and 9311 to find all possible homologues. If more than one
homologue were found in Nipponbare or 93-11, the
homologues were designated as genes in a multi-gene
family.

Eighteen lines of world-wide O. sativa, two ecotypes of
wild rice O. rufipogon (S03005 and S01169) and two
related species (O. officinalis and O. meyeriana) were chosen to detect the presence/absence of R genes among these
populations. The rice lines were obtained from USDA,
National Plant Germplasm System, USA and Dr. Cailin
Wang in Institute of Food Crops, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China, and wild rice and related species
from Dr. Dajian Pan in National Guangzhou Wild-Rice
Conservation, China.
Genotyping and sequencing
All the lines were genotyped by a PCR method. The primer
pairs were designed to amplify ~700 bp fragments in the
LRR region (Table S4). We investigated the presence/
absence of 17 P/A genes (11 in 93-11 and 6 in Nippon-

bare) using 14 allelic (symmetric) genes (8 in single gene
and 6 in multigene families) as positive controls, which
were randomly chosen from the genes presented in both
Nipponbare and 93-11. Three housekeeping genes were
also selected as another positive control. To obtain reliable results, the PCR products were sequenced to verify the
expected genes amplified (GenBank: EF533726EF533871). In cases of null PCR products, we repeated the
PCR reactions two more times with one at 5°C lower
annealing temperature (45–50°C); if no PCR products
were obtained again, we repeated the PCR reaction once
more using a newly designed primer pair for the genes.
For the gene -3, -6, -11, -18 and -19 (Table 3), we used
conserved regions based on the sequence information
from various rice strains because their average nucleotide
diversities (π in Table 3) were > 0.01. We believed that
these efforts maximized excluding false PCR results due to
heterogenic sequences.
