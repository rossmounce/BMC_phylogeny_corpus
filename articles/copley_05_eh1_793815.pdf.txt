Abstract
Background: The Engrailed Homology 1 (EH1) motif is a small region, believed to have evolved
convergently in homeobox and forkhead containing proteins, that interacts with the Drosophila
protein groucho (C. elegans unc-37, Human Transducin-like Enhancers of Split). The small size of
the motif makes its reliable identification by computational means difficult. I have systematically
searched the predicted proteomes of Drosophila, C. elegans and human for further instances of the
motif.
Results: Using motif identification methods and database searching techniques, I delimit which
homeobox and forkhead domain containing proteins also have likely EH1 motifs. I show that
despite low database search scores, there is a significant association of the motif with transcription
factor function. I further show that likely EH1 motifs are found in combination with T-Box, Zinc
Finger and Doublesex domains as well as discussing other plausible candidate associations. I identify
strong candidate EH1 motifs in basal metazoan phyla.
Conclusion: Candidate EH1 motifs exist in combination with a variety of transcription factor
domains, suggesting that these proteins have repressor functions. The distribution of the EH1 motif
is suggestive of convergent evolution, although in many cases, the motif has been conserved
throughout bilaterian orthologs. Groucho mediated repression was established prior to the
evolution of bilateria.

Background
The Engrailed Homology 1 (EH1) motif is a short (<10
amino acids) region, initially found in engrailed (en) and
other homeobox containing proteins, that mediates transcriptional repression via interaction with the WD40
repeat containing groucho (Gro) [1,2]. Shimeld [3] proposed that the EH1 motif of Smith and Jaynes was shared
with various forkhead (FH/HNF-3) containing transcription factors. The short size of the motif, however, suggests
that it may occur by chance in many different protein families. Shimeld did not demonstrate statistically significant
sequence similarity between the motifs from the home-

obox- and forkhead-containing families. However, the
human orthologs of groucho (the transducin-like
enhancer of split proteins) have been shown to interact
with FOXA2 via a region of sequence containing an EH1
motif, clearly demonstrating the biological relevance of
the sequence similarity [4].
In this article I search systematically for instances of the
EH1 motif in homeobox and forkhead containing genes
and go on to demonstrate that the EH1 motif is also found
in proteins containing T-box, Doublesex Motif (DM) and
Zn finger domains. I show that within metazoan

genomes, the observed association of the motif with transcription factor function is statistically significant. The
location of the motif in members of the same transcription factor family is often non-homologous, occurring
both N- and C-terminal to the DNA binding domain, suggesting that the presence of the motif is, in part, due to
convergent evolution, as proposed by Shimeld; the conservation within orthologs points to many of these convergences predating the last common ancestor of the
bilateria.

Results and Discussion
Significant association of EH1 motif with transcription
factor function
I searched for sequence motifs in homeobox containing
transcription factors taken from the proteins of human,
Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, by first
masking known Pfam domains [5], and then using the
expectation maximization algorithm implemented in the
meme program [6]. The first non-subfamily specific motif
identified corresponded to previously known examples
and new instances of, the EH1 motif (see Figure 1a), in
100 sites, with an E-value of < 10-126. I then applied the
same approach to Forkhead containing transcription factors, identifying 25 sites with a combined E-value of < 1031 (Figure 2a). These motifs also appeared to conform to
the consensus of the EH1 motif, as previously reported by
Shimeld [3].

To further investigate the significance of this similarity, I
constructed hidden Markov models (HMM) of the motif
(EH1hox & EH1fh) which I then searched against the complete set of predicted proteins from human, D. melanogaster &C. elegans. The highest scoring non homeobox
containing domain match of EH1hox was a Forkhead protein (human FOXL1), and the second highest scoring
non-Forkhead containing match of EH1fh was to a homeobox containing protein (D. melanogaster inv). In both
cases, nearly all the high scoring hits were to proteins containing domains with transcription factor function (see
Figure 3). Among the best scoring matches of the EH1hox
searches were several T-box (TBOX), Doublesex Motif
(DM), Zinc finger (ZnF_C2H2) and ETS containing proteins (domain names as per SMART, Figure 2b–e) [7,8].
Excluding hits to homeobox containing proteins, but otherwise including all scores, the overall significance of the
association of transcription factor function with higher
scores to the EH1hox HMM is P < 10-47, using a logistic
regression model which tests association between score
and transcription factor annotation (see methods and
supplementary file 1 for raw data). The association
remains significant when scores derived from Forkhead
and PAX domain containing proteins are also excluded (P
< 10-34). This indicates that, although the scores associated with any individual EH1-like motif may not be statis-

tically significant, overall, we would not see so many EH1like sequences co-occurring with DNA binding domains if
their co-occurrence were governed simply by chance –
there is, therefore, likely to be a functional reason for
these partnerships. In the following sections, I review the
higher scoring associations detected here in the light of
known gene functions.
EH1 motifs in homeobox and forkhead containing proteins
The presence of EH1 motifs within various homeobox,
and to a lesser extent, forkhead containing proteins has
been widely reported, although not systematically studied
[3]. I found EH1-like motifs co-occurring with 3 major
groupings of homeobox sub-types: the extended-hox
class, typified by Drosophila engrailed (en); the paired
class, including Drosophila goosecoid (gsc), and the NK
class, including Drosophila tinman (tin) [1,9,10] (see [11]
for a description of these broad classes). Related to the
paired class homeobox domains, a number of genes containing PAIRED domains only (i.e. the PAX domain of
SMART [7]) were also found to contain EH1-like motifs
(see Figure 1b). With only a few exceptions, outlined
below, the EH1-like motif occurs N-terminal to the homeobox domain and C-terminal to the PAIRED domain
when present. A number of these proteins have been
shown to interact with groucho or its orthologs e.g. C. elegans cog-1 [12], vertebrate Nkx proteins [13], Drosophila
engrailed (en) and goosecoid (gsc) [2,14], and in high
throughput assays Drosophila invected (inv) and and ladybird late (Ibl) [15].

A handful of EH1-like motifs are found C-terminal to
homeobox domains. Of these, the best characterized is C.
elegans unc-4, which has been shown to interact with the
groucho ortholog unc-37 [16]; the Drosophila ortholog
unc-4 also interacts with groucho in high throughput
experiments [15]. The C-terminal EH1-like motif is conserved in the closely related Drosophila paralog OdsH. The
gene prediction for the human ortholog of unc-4
(ensembl gene identifier ENSG00000164853) appears to
be artefactually truncated, but the mouse ortholog
(Uncx4.1 ENSMUSG00000029546) and corrected
human gene models, contain EH1-like motifs both N & Cterminal to the homeobox domain. Taken together with
the fact that in the majority of related homeobox containing proteins the EH1-like motifs are N-terminal, this suggests that the N-terminal motif has been lost in Drosophila
and C. elegans unc-4 orthologs.
EH1-like motifs also occur N- and C-terminal to Forkhead
domains. The N-terminal class consists of the sloppypaired genes (slp1 and slp2) of Drosophila and orthologous or closely related sequences: human FOXG1, and
Drosophila CG9571; the C. elegans ortholog fkh-2 contains
an EH1-like motif although a cysteine residue causes a low

score. The C-terminal class consists of an apparent clade
including the human FOXA, FOXB, FOXC and FOXD
genes (Figure 2a), although if the EH1 motif was present
in the common ancestor of this clade, multiple losses
must have later occurred (see [17] for a Forkhead domain
phylogeny). The situation is complicated somewhat by an
EH1-like motif at the N-terminus of C. elegans unc-130 i.e.
in the FOXD like family. The EH1 motif in slp1 has been
shown to interact with groucho [18], and FOXA type
genes have been shown to interact with human groucho
orthologs [4].
EH1 motifs in novel domain contexts
Assuming a conservative per-domain cutoff score of 10.0
bits for true matches to the EH1hox model (see Figure 3),
yields hits to proteins containing T-box domains (highest
score 13.1 bits); Doublesex (DM) domains (highest score
11.6 bits) and C2H2 Zinc fingers (highest score 11.2 bits).
Also of note was a further match at 9.4 bits, to an ETS
domain containing protein. Prompted by these similarities I further investigated the presence of EH1-like motifs
in these families, looking for high scoring matches to the
EH1hox HMM that were conserved in closely related genes.
T-box containing proteins
I identified likely EH1 motifs co-occurring with T-Box
domains in two distinct contexts (Figure 2b). The motif
occurs C-terminal to the T-box in the Drosophila dorsocross proteins Doc1, Doc2 and Doc3. It is found N-terminal to the T-box in 11 proteins including mls-1 and mab9 from C. elegans; H15, mid/nmr2 and bi/omd from Drosophila; in humans there are strong matches to TBX18,
TBX20 and TBX22 and more marginal matches to TBX3
and TBX2. Although, to the best of my knowledge, none
of these proteins has been shown to interact with groucho
or its orthologs, several are known to act as transcriptional
repressors: for instance, in murine heart development,
Tbx20 represses Tbx2 which in turn represses Nmyc
[19,20]; the Dorsocross genes from Drosophila repress
wingless and ladybird [21], and Doc itself is repressed by
mid/nmr2 [22]. The human proteins TBX1 and TBX10,
and Drosophila org-1 which are closely related to those
above, do not appear to contain EH1 motifs. The human
T (brachyury) protein contains a motif broadly similar to
the EH1 consensus: LQYRVDHLLSA in a comparable Nterminal location to those found in other T-box containing proteins. Although this motif scores poorly against
EH1hox (-0.1 bits), the homologous regions from other T
orthologs (for instance, the non-bilaterian sequences discussed below) provide a more persuasive case for the presence of a functioning EH1 motif in these proteins.
Zinc finger containing proteins
The highest scoring match of EH1hox to a C2H2 zinc finger
containing protein, was ces-1 from C. elegans (bit score

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/169

11.2); this protein interacts with the groucho ortholog
unc-37 [[23], #54] and can act as a repressor [24]. The
putative EH1 motif is at the N-terminal end of ces-1. In
contrast, the Drosophila proteins bowl and odd have EH1like motifs at their C-terminal ends (with bit scores of
10.9 & 8.4 respectively). In neither case is there direct evidence from high throughput studies of an interaction with
groucho, but both can function as repressors [25]. The
human protein ZNF312 (bit score 8.6) is the ortholog of
zebrafish Fezl, which contains an EH1 motif essential for
repressor activity [26] – this motif is conserved in the
human paralog ENSG00000128610 and likely Drosophila
ortholog CG31670 (bit scores of 8.4 & 5.1) (Figure 2e).
Doublesex motif containing proteins
The Doublesex Motif (DM) was first found in proteins
controlling sexual differentiation in Drosophila. Two DM
containing proteins were confidently predicted to contain
EH1-like motifs – human DMRT2 (bit score 11.6), and
Drosophila dmrt11e (bit score 11.2) – these are likely
orthologs; a C. elegans protein, C27C12.6 contained a
weaker match (bit score 6.6) (Figure 2d). The molecular
function of these proteins is unknown.
Other potential associations with transcription factor domains
Although scoring less highly than some non-transcription
factor hits, another intriguing association is with the ETS
domain. The three uncharatcerized C. elegans paralogs
F19F10.5, F19F10.1 & C50A2.4 contain C-terminal
matches to the EH1 motifs (bit scores 9.4, 2.3 & 7.4), and
two other ETS proteins, C. elegans lin-1, and Drosophila
Eip74EF, both have relatively high scoring matches (bit
scores 6.5 & 6.6) (Figure 2c). A high scoring protein that
is not annotated as a transcription factor (as it contains no
interpro domains) is Drosophila Hairless (H) with a score
of 8.3 bits. Experimental work has previously confirmed
the presence of an EH1-like motif (SSYSIHSLLGG) within
H that is responsible for its interaction with groucho [27].
The Drosophila protein Dorsal has been reported to interact with groucho via an EH1-like motif [28] – this region
(NGPTLSNLLSF) is markedly different to those reported
here, having a low score against EH1hox (-10.7 bits) and so
may better be regarded as a, so far, unique type of groucho
interaction motif.
Evolutionary considerations
Convergent evolution
The EH1 motif is found N- and C-terminal to homeobox,
forkhead, T-box and Zn finger protein domains. Clearly,
as the locations of the EH1 motif are non-homologous,
the N- and C-terminal associations must have occurred
independently. The short size of the motif makes it tempting to speculate that the motif itself may have arisen independently (i.e. in repeated cases it may have evolved
within sequence that was already part of the gene, rather

recombination events combining domains are relatively
rare [29,30]. The fact that we would here have many such
events suggests that the alternative hypothesis of independent

Pre-bilaterian origins of association with different transcription
factors
Groucho is orthologous to the C. elegans unc-37 gene, and
the four human paralogs TLE1-4 (Transducin Like
Enhancer of split). An ortholog is also found in the cnidarian Hydra mangipapillata (e.g. the EST with gi
47137860, data not shown), and certain cnidarian homeobox containing genes also contain an EH1-like motif,
suggesting groucho/EH1 mediated repression pre-dates
the split between diplobasts and triplobasts; indeed, a
sponge Bar/Bsh like homeobox containing protein (i.e.
protein gi: 33641772) [31] also contains an EH1-like
motif, as does paxb from the non-bilaterian placozoan
Trichoplax adhaerens [32] and a Tlx-like protein from a
ctenophore (gi: 38602653), suggesting the repression system was in place in the earliest animals (see [33] for a discussion of early metazoan evolution). I find high scoring
EH1-like motifs in Forkhead domain containing proteins
from sponges, cnidarians and ctenophores, in both the Cterminal (FOXA-D clade) (region II in [34]) and N-terminal (FOXG, sloppy paired clade) varieties (reported as
'HPFSI' in [35]). The presumed ortholog of 'T' from the
Trichoplax adhaerens [36] contains an EH1-like motif (8.6
bits). These results suggest that groucho mediated repression using a variety of transcription factors was widespread in the last common ancestor of the metazoa.

than via a recombination event). The strongest evidence
for this is that, in general, the majority of domain combinations occur in a fixed N to C orientation, suggesting that

Conclusion
Candidate EH1 motifs exist in combination with a variety
of transcription factor domains, suggesting that these proteins have roles as repressors of transcriptional activity.
The distribution of the EH1 motif is suggestive of a
number of instances of convergent evolution, although in
many cases the motif has been conserved throughout bilaterian orthologs. Together with the existence of a cnidarian Groucho ortholog, this leads to the conclusion that
EH1/Groucho mediated repression was established prior
to the evolution of bilateria.

Methods
Proteomes were derived from ensembl 32 (human NCBI
35, C. elegans wormbase 140, Drosophila BDGP 4) [37]. In
cases of multiple splice variants, the one with the most
exons was included (or the longest in the case of ties).
Transcription factor activity was taken as the presence of
the gene ontology accession GO:0003700 associated with
an interpro domain predicted for the protein [38]. These
data were also taken from ensembl. Although C2H2 subtype Zn fingers are not annotated by Interpro as transcription factors they are DNA binding and frequently have

this role, so have been included in the transcription factor
set. Bit scores reported in the text are for comparisons of
the EH1hox HMM against the target sequence using the
HMMER software package [39].

The association of transcription factor function (coded as
a dichotomous variable, t, taking the values 1 [transcription factor] or 0 [non-transcription factor]) with the bit
score, x, of the EH1hox HMM, was tested using a logistic
regression model implemented in the glm() function of
the R package [40]). I fitted the model
Prob(t = 1) = exp(a + bx)/(1 + exp(a + bx))
The coefficients a, b were estimated from the data by maximum-likelihood. The hypothesis of no association is
equivalent to testing if b = 0.
Where inferences of orthology are made, they are based
on clear-cut separation of BLAST scores or alignmentbased phylogenies.
