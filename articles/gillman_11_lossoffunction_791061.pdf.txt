Loss-of-function mutations affecting a specific
Glycine max R2R3 MYB transcription factor result
in brown hilum and brown seed coats
Jason D Gillman1*, Ashley Tetlow2, Jeong-Deong Lee3, J Grover Shannon4 and Kristin Bilyeu1

Abstract
Background: Although modern soybean cultivars feature yellow seed coats, with the only color variation found at
the hila, the ancestral condition is black seed coats. Both seed coat and hila coloration are due to the presence of
phenylpropanoid pathway derivatives, principally anthocyanins. The genetics of soybean seed coat and hilum
coloration were first investigated during the resurgence of genetics during the 1920s, following the rediscovery of
Mendel’s work. Despite the inclusion of this phenotypic marker into the extensive genetic maps developed for
soybean over the last twenty years, the genetic basis behind the phenomenon of brown seed coats (the R locus)
has remained undetermined until now.
Results: In order to identify the gene responsible for the r gene effect (brown hilum or seed coat color), we
utilized bulk segregant analysis and identified recombinant lines derived from a population segregating for two
phenotypically distinct alleles of the R locus. Fine mapping was accelerated through use of a novel,
bioinformatically determined set of Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers which allowed us to delimit the
genomic region containing the r gene to less than 200 kbp, despite the use of a mapping population of only 100
F6 lines. Candidate gene analysis identified a loss of function mutation affecting a seed coat-specific expressed
R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene (Glyma09g36990) as a strong candidate for the brown hilum phenotype. We
observed a near perfect correlation between the mRNA expression levels of the functional R gene candidate and
an UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) gene, which is responsible for the final step in anthocyanin
biosynthesis. In contrast, when a null allele of Glyma09g36990 is expressed no upregulation of the UF3GT gene was
found.
Conclusions: We discovered an allelic series of four loss of function mutations affecting our R locus gene
candidate. The presence of any one of these mutations was perfectly correlated with the brown seed coat/hilum
phenotype in a broadly distributed survey of soybean cultivars, barring the presence of the epistatic dominant I
allele or gray pubescence, both of which can mask the effect of the r allele, resulting in yellow or buff hila. These
findings strongly suggest that loss of function for one particular seed coat-expressed R2R3 MYB gene is responsible
for the brown seed coat/hilum phenotype in soybean.

Background
Domestication of Soybean

Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a remarkable plant,
producing both high quality oil and protein and is one
of the primary row crops in the United States. Although
soybean is relatively new to western agriculture, it has

been under cultivation for > 3000 years [1,2]. The transition from wild Glycine soja to cultivated Glycine max
was the result of ancient plant breeders/farmers selecting for a large number of domestication-specific traits
(photoperiod insensitivity, lack of shattering, lack of lodging, seed size increases, seed set increases, etc.). Dramatic changes in seed oil/protein content and fatty acid
composition have apparently also been selected for during domestication, either directly or indirectly [3,4].

Genetics of soybean seed coloration

The visual appearance of the soybean seed itself has also
been altered as a result of domestication: All Glycine
soja accessions in the USDA GRIN germplasm collection possess black seed coats, whereas the majority of
Glycine max germplasm (12880/18585 Soybean entries,
accessed 06/07/2011) possess yellow seed coats.
Although a small market exists for black soybeans, all
modern high yielding cultivars feature yellow seed coats,
with a range of hila colors present (brown, black, imperfect black, buff, yellow). Cultivars with pale hila are
highly prized for natto and tofu production [5]. Because
hilum coloration is controlled by a small number of
genes [6], this trait is frequently used by breeders as a
readily assayed visible marker for the presence of “offtypes” in soybean seed lots. Seed coat and hilum color
are relatively simple epistatic multi-genic traits, and variation in hilum and seed coat pigmentation appears to
be due to the interaction of four independent loci: Inhibitor (I), Tawny (T), an unnamed locus termed R, and
the flower color locus W1 [6-8](Table 1). Other loci
with minor effects have been described, but these have
not been mapped and the genetics have been incompletely discerned [6-8].
The compounds responsible for soybean seed coat and
hilum color in soybean are derivatives of phenylpropanoid pathway [9-11] (Figure 1). The wild type condition
of black seed coats is primarily due to two anthocyanidin glycosides (anthocyanins): cyanidin-3-monoglucoside
and delphinidin-3-monoglucoside [10,11]. In lines which
feature brown seed coats, only cyanidin is apparently
present at maturity [10]. Aside from the cosmetic and

aesthetic aspect of coloration, anthocyanins are thought
to have diverse human health promoting capabilities
[12].
The action of UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-Oglucosyltransferase enzymes is a critical step in
anthocyanin accumulation

Two anthocyanin glycosides form the predominant
colored compounds in black seed coats: cyanidin-3monoglucoside and delphinidin-3-monoglucoside [10].
These are formed through the action of UDP-glucose:
flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) enzymes,
which specifically transfer a glucose moiety from UTP
to the 3’ position of cyanidin and delphinidin (recently
reviewed in [13], Figure 1). This glycosylation is thought
to increase the stability and solubility of the cyanidin
molecule [14]. In lines with brown seed coats (r), cyanidin accumulates, though high levels of proanthocyanidins are also present [10]. Recently, two highly similar
co-expressed UF3GT genes (Glyma07g30180 and Glyma08g07130) were determined to be expressed in seed
coats of black seeded soybean lines, and these genes
have been demonstrated to specifically transfer a glucose
moiety to the cyanidin molecule at the 3’-hydroxyl
group, resulting in the formation of cyanidin-3-glucoside
[15].
The Inhibitor locus

Seed coat color is primarily under control of the Inhibitor locus, which has at least four classically defined
genetic alleles [8], listed here from the most dominant
to the least: I (largely colorless seeds) >i i (color

restricted to hilum) >i k ("saddle;” color in hilum and
spreading slightly beyond the hilum) >i (seeds completely black). Inhibitor acts in a dominant, gain-of-function manner with maternal-effect inheritance, and
results in seed coats appearing pale yellow due to the
absence of anthocyanins [10]. Both the dominant Inhibitor allele (I) and the i i alleles have been shown to be
due to naturally occurring, gene-silencing effects derived
from linked but independent Chalcone Synthase (CHS)
gene clusters (chromosome 8, LG A2) that generate
siRNA which target CHS gene transcripts specifically
within the seed coat for degradation [16-22].
The genetics of soybean hilum coloration

Lines which have the dominant I allele can still exhibit
some traces of color within the hilum, with the specific
hilum coloration due to the allelic status at three other
genetic loci: Tawny, R, and W1 [6,8] (Table 1). Hilum
tissue is not maternally-derived, in contrast to the seed
coat [23]. In lines with the recessive (i) allele, seed coat

color is brown, imperfect black, buff or black, dependent
on the allelic status of the Tawny, R and W1 loci (Table
1).
The Tawny locus has two pleiotropic effects: homozygosity for the gray (t) allele results in gray pubescence
at maturity and, in lines carrying the combination of the
ii allele of the Inhibitor locus, a functional R gene, and
purple flowers (W1), seed which feature “imperfect
black” hila (Table 1). Alternatively, gray pubescent (t)
lines carrying the ii allele of the Inhibitor locus, a functional or nonfunctional R, and white flowers (w1) produce seed which feature buff hila [8] (Table 1). The
phenotypic effects of the recessive allele of Tawny have
been discerned to be due to loss of function mutations
affecting a flavonoid 3’ hydroxylase gene (Glyma06g21920) [24]. At the chemical level, this is the
result of a reduction in the accumulation of anthocyanins within the hilum, and the presence of pelargonidin
(Figure 1), which does not accumulate in lines carrying
the wild type version of the Tawny locus [10].

The recessive allele of the R locus is responsible for
brown hilum/seed coats

Another locus, classically termed R, also interacts epistatically with the Tawny and Inhibitor loci (as well as the
W1 locus) to control hilum and seed coat colors [8]
(Table 1). Lines with a functional Tawny gene and
homozygous for the recessive allele of the R locus possess either brown seed coats or brown hilum, dependent
on the allelic status of the Inhibitor locus (i or ii respectively). Although the genetics behind this trait were well
resolved shortly after the rediscovery of Mendel’s work
in the 1920s [6], the molecular genetic basis has not
been ascertained. Despite this, the ease of phenotyping
has resulted in the inclusion of this locus in the development of genetic maps for soybean [25-27].
Epistasis for genes involved in soybean coloration

Epistatic and pleiotropic interactions are the norm for
genes involved in soybean coloration (Table 1). For
example, loss of function mutations affecting a flavonoid
3’5’-hydroxylase gene (w1, F3’5’H, Figure 1) have been
demonstrated to result in two phenotypes: white flowers
and loss of purple pigment in hypocotyls [28]. The allelic status of the W1 locus, when combined with the
recessive gray allele of the Tawny locus, determines if
seed coats or hila are colored “imperfect black” or “buff”
(Table 1) [8].
Approaches to identify the r locus, which results in
brown hilum/seed coats

Loss of function mutations affecting a gene involved in
the terminal end of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway have been suggested as the cause of the recessive
brown seed coat/hilum phenotype (Figure 1). Possible
candidates have included UF3GT, Anthocyanidin
Synthase (ANS) and/or Dihydroxyflavone Reductase
(DFR) genes. However, no correlation has been found
between the genomic locations of any UF3GT, DFR or
ANS gene and the location of the R gene [29]. Alternately, a transcription factor or other regulatory element
could be responsible for the brown hilum/seed coat phenomenon. The objective of this work was to identify the
specific gene and causative basis behind the phenomenon of brown hilum/seed coat coloration, historically
defined as the R locus, in soybean.

Methods
RIL population development

The generation of the F 6 RIL mapping population,
derived from a cross between Jake X PI 283327, was
previously described [30]. Jake (PI 643912) has tawny
pubescence, purple flowers, and shiny yellow seed with
black hila (i i T R W1)[31]. The brown hila line, PI
283327 has tawny pubescence, purple flowers, and

Page 4 of 12

yellow seed with brown hila (ii, T, r, W1) (USDA GRIN
germplasm collection, accessed 06/22/2011 (http://www.
ars-grin.gov/npgs/). The reference cultivar Williams 82,
for which the genome sequence was determined [32],
has tawny pubescence, white flowers and yellow seed
with black hila (ii, T, R, w1) [33].
Bulk segregant analysis of selected RIL lines

A total of 100 F6 RIL lines were selected from a Jake X
PI 283327 cross in which segregation for hilum color
had occurred (50 possessed black hila, 50 had brown
hila) and seed from each were pooled to form two
bulks. Only RILs that were definitively black or brown
were used in the bulks, with ambiguous or mixed RILs
not included. The seeds (1 per RIL) were ground utilizing a coffee grinder to generate a fine powder. The grinder was cleaned thoroughly between grindings. DNA
was isolated using a DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit (Qiagen,
Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Bulk DNA was concentrated using standard
ethanol precipitation procedure to yield a final concentration of 3.52 micrograms mL-1 (black bulk) or 2.40
micrograms mL -1 (brown bulk). Bulk DNA was used
with Universal Soybean Linkage Panel (USLP) as previously described [34].
Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers

All SSR primer pairs from within the newly delimited R
locus region, drawn from a bioinformatically defined
list, were also examined for potential utility in fine-mapping [35]. Fine mapping PCR was performed in 20
microliter reactions as previously described [36] and
PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. Genotypic classes were assigned by visual comparison to PCR
reactions using DNA from parental lines. Only those
SSR primer pairs which showed obvious, easily scored
size polymorphism between the two parents (PI 283327
and Jake) were used in subsequent analysis. SSR primers
pairs which displayed polymorphism within the newly
defined R region, and which could theoretically be used
to select for this trait, are listed in Additional File 1.
DNA isolation, PCR and sequencing of candidate genes
from pureline seed

DNA was isolated using a DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen), and 5-50 ng of DNA were used in PCR with Ex
taq (Takara) with gene specific primers (Additional File
1) under the following conditions: 95°C for 5 minutes,
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 59°C for
30 seconds, and at 72°C for 1 minute per 1 kbp of predicted product size. Following PCR, products were
examined on a 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis and
sent for sequencing at the University of Missouri DNA
core facility. Sequence traces were downloaded,

Gillman et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:155
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/155

imported into Contig Express model of the VectorNTI
Advance 11 software (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
assembled and manually evaluated for polymorphisms.
Putative polymorphisms were verified by a second, independent PCR and sequencing reaction.
Selection of diverse lines from the germplasm repository

136 lines were selected for sequencing of the putative R
gene, drawn either from a previously established list of
diverse germplasm [37] or were individually selected
from the USDA GRIN germplasm collection (http://
www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/) to ensure a broad geographic
distribution with a range of hilum and seed coat colors.
Certain color classes were only minimally investigated,
due to epistatic interactions which precluded novel
information (e.g. yellow seed coat with buff hila, see
Table 1). A full listing of the 136 lines examined for the
allelic status of the R gene/Glyma09g36990 is listed in
Additional File 2. For a subset of ten lines, all three
exons were examined by sequencing (including the 5’
UTR, 3’UTR, the 1st intron and the majority of the 2nd
intron, although portions of the 2 nd intron are highly
repetitive AT-rich and recalcitrant to PCR and sequencing). These lines were: PI 84970 (Hokkaido Black, black
seed coats), PI 518671 (Williams 82, yellow seed coats,
black hila), PI 643912 (Jake, yellow seed coats, black
hila), PI 548461 (Improved Pelican, yellow seed coats,
brown hila), PI 548389 (Minsoy, yellow seed coats,
brown hila), PI 438477 (Fiskeby 840-7-3, yellow seed
coats, brown hila), PI 180501 (Strain #18, yellow seed
coats, brown hila), PI 283327 (Pingtung Pearl, yellow
seed coats, brown hila), PI 240664 (Bilomia No. 3, yellow seed coats, brown hila), PI 567115 B (MARIF 2782,
black seed coats). Because all mutations identified were
found to affect the 1st or 2nd exons, we elected to only
sequence the first and second exons (as well as 5’ UTR,
the 1st intron, and a portion of the 2nd intron) in the
remaining 126 lines.
qRT-PCR

Expression analysis on seed coat, cotyledon or leaf total
RNA (DNAse-treated using Turbo DNase (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA)) was performed as described [38]
with minor modifications. The RT-PCR mix was supplemented with 0.2X Titanium Taq polymerase (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) to improve primer efficiency.
Following the reverse transcriptase reaction, amplification was 95°C for 15 min, then 35 cycles of 95°C for 20
seconds, 60°C for 20 seconds, and 72°C for 20 seconds.
Primers used in this work are listed in Additional File 1.
The reference gene used to normalize data was CONS6
[39] and raw Ct values were first applied to efficiency
curves developed for each primer set utilizing Williams
82 genomic DNA, then normalized to the expression of

Page 5 of 12

the reference gene and expressed as a percent of
CONS6.
Numerous researchers have reported reliable data
from qRT-PCR utilizing RNA from mature yellow seed
coat tissue. However RT-PCR using RNA derived from
brown seed coat tissue was challenging, likely owing to
the known effect of interference due to proanthocyanins
[10]. The use of a simple PCR Inhibitor removal column
(Zymo, Irvine, CA, USA) remedied this difficulty, resulting in acceptable qRT-PCR data derived from mRNA
isolated from maturing brown seed coat tissue.
We also investigated CHS7/8 using a primer pair previously described [18]; however the results were highly
variable in both cotyledon and seed coat tissues with no
significant expression level differences detected between
the brown and black seed coat samples (data not
shown).

Results
Bulk Segregant Analysis

In order to identify the gene responsible for the r locus
effect (brown hilum or seed coat color), we initially utilized the bulk segregant analysis (BSA) [40] method on
RILs from a population derived from the cross of soybean cultivar Jake with the PI 283327 which had segregated for the R gene alleles with the USLP array [34].
Although this technique confirmed the previously identified location of the R locus [25,26], the extremely
broad window identified (data not shown, ~4.2 Mbp,
based on the Williams 82 sequence) failed to further
delimit the boundaries of the R locus.
We then assayed a novel SSR set [35] derived from
bioinformatic analysis of the whole genome shotgun
sequence (WGSS) for Williams 82 corresponding to the
region containing the R locus. The use of DNA from
the two bulks with polymorphic markers allowed us to
refine the R region to ~1.35 Mbps as tightly linked to
the locus responsible for brown hila (Table 2).
Identification of lines featuring recombination events
within the delimited R region

Three primer pairs from the novel SSR set (BARCSOYSSR 09_1475, 09_1501 and 09_1566 were examined for all 100 RIL lines. For the majority, the hilum
color phenotype was correlated with the expected parental polymorphic band. We also observed seven individual RILs which possessed recombination events
within the region identified on chromosome Gm09/LG
K (Figure 2A). We examined these seven RILs using all
novel polymorphic SSRs markers within this region,
and compared the marker genotype to the RIL phenotype (Table 2 Figure 2A). Our methodology allowed us
to fine-map the location of the R gene to a predicted
region of less than 200 kbp with only 100 RIL lines.

All markers indicated are drawn from the recently described list of Simple Sequence Repeat markers determined by bioinformatics analysis [35] of the Williams
82 whole genome shotgun sequence [32].

This region in Williams 82 contains 23 predicted open
reading frames, with another 3 genes annotated as
pseudogenes (Figure 2B).
Identification of four R2R3 MYB genes as candidates for
the R locus

BLAST searches using the 26 candidate genes were performed against NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
and TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org) databases to
search for candidate genes. BLAST searches revealed
four tandem genes which featured homology to the
R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene family: Glyma09g36970, Glyma09g36980, 09g36990 and Glyma09g37010. R2R3 MYB genes have been shown to
control flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway, and
mutants in multiple species are associated with changes
in fruit, flower and/or seed color (recently reviewed in
[41]). These four tandem R2R3 MYB genes are highly
similar (~80-90% nucleotide identity, excluding presumed intronic sequence) and may have arisen due to a
tandem gene amplification event(s). Strikingly, none of
these genes appears to have been identified in recent
seed focused studies using RNAseq methods [42,43].

in seed coat tissue (Glyma09g36970 is annotated as a
pseudogene in the current whole genome shotgun
sequence build), we utilized qRT-PCR. Only one of
these candidate R2R3 MYB genes, Glyma09g36990, was
expressed in any of the tissues examined (leaf, seed
cotyledons, and seed coats). Gene transcripts from Glyma09g36990 were present in the seed coats of both a
brown seeded and a black seeded cultivar. However, this
gene was not expressed in either cotyledon tissue (Figure 3A) or in leaves (data not shown). It is not clear if
the other three R2R3 MYB genes in the cluster are
expressed in other tissues. Nor is the role these genes
play in soybean physiology known, if any.
Curiously, the Williams 82 Glyma09g36990 gene
model was predicted to possess four exons, in contrast
to the canonical 3 exons identified for authentic R2R3
MYB transcription factor genes [44,45]. To characterize
the authentic expressed sequence, RT-PCR was used to
analyze full length cDNA for comparison to the reference Williams 82 gene model. The authentic gene is
slightly larger than that the predicted Glyma09g36690
gene model and possesses three exons (Additional File
3), in concordance with that reported for other R2R3
MYB genes [44,45].

Expression analysis of R2R3 gene candidates

Because soybean hilum tissue is extremely small and difficult to accurately dissect from seeds in non-pigmented
stages, we utilized a large seeded soybean line with
brown seed coats (PI 567115 B) and a large seeded line
with black seed coats (PI 84970) to examine mRNA
expression. In order to assess whether a subset of these
four tandem genes were pseudogenes and/or expressed

Analysis of Glyma09g36990 for potential causative
polymorphisms

PCR and Sanger sequencing of exons (and partial intronic sequence) was used to evaluate the Glyma09g36990
gene for polymorphisms in a selection of lines: Jake
(black hilum), PI 283327 (brown hilum), Williams 82
(black hilum), PI 84970 (black seed coats) and PI

Screen capture of generic genome browser version 1.71, displaying the region identified which contained the locus responsible for the brown
hilum color in soybean cultivar PI 283327(http://www.soybase.org, accessed 03-15-2011). Arrows indicate the location of the four candidate R2R3
MYB transcription factor genes. The genomic location of the only R2R3 MYB gene expressed in seed coats, which features a deletion from within
exon 2 (C377-) in the brown hilum line (PI 283327) is indicated.

567115 B (brown seed coats). We discovered a singlebase deletion within exon 2 in PI 283327 and PI 567115
B that results in a frameshift mutation (C377-, relative
to the start codon) (Figure 4, details in Additional File
3). The open reading frame for Glyma09g36990 was
allelic between Williams 82, Jake and PI 84970.
We then elected to examine a broad geographic distribution of lines (136 in total, Additional File 2) from the
available soybean germplasm corresponding to all of the
known seed coat and hilum color classes. From this pool,
we identified three additional presumed loss of function
mutations: G343-, resulting in frameshift; G95C TGG >
TCG (W32S) missense in conserved residue; AGgt >
AGtt (g404t) disrupts conserved mRNA splice recognition site (Figure 4, further details in Additional File 3).
In all cases where we observed an intact open reading
frame, we noted the phenotype of imperfect black hilum

(ii R t W1), buff hilum (ii R t w1), black hilum (ii R T)
or black seed coat (i R T), dependent on the allelic status of the Inhibitor and Tawny loci (Additional File 2).
Any of these four loss of function alleles resulted in
either brown hilum (ii r T), brown seed coat (i r T) or
buff hila (ii r t). In all cases, we observed a perfect association between the presence of one of the four loss of
function alleles and brown hilum or brown seed coats,
barring the presence of the epistatic dominant I allele or
gray pubescence, both of which can mask the effect of
the r allele, resulting in yellow or buff hila (Additional
File 2). These epistatic interactions (and masking in the
case of Inhibitor) are due to the placement of the step
affected by the R2R3 MYB gene at the terminal end of
the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (Figure 1). Any
one of the loss of function mutations affecting the R
gene are necessary and sufficient for brown seed coat

can be masked or modulated by the presence of certain
alleles of the Inhibitor and Tawny loci (Table 1 Additional File 2).
Time-course of mRNA expression for Glyma09g36990 and
two phenylpropanoid biosynthetic enzymes

If the candidate R gene is controlling expression of a
gene which forms a rate limited step in anthocyanin
production, we hypothesized that a correlation would
exist between 1) R gene expression levels, 2) the appearance of color compounds, and 3) the expression of ANS
and/or UF3GT genes in developing seed coats. We
examined a time course of seed coat and seed cotyledons by qRT-PCR (Figure 3) for expression of three
genes: the R gene candidate, ANS, and UF3GT. Seed

coats from the large seeded line with brown seed coats
(PI 567115 B) and one with black seed coats (PI 84970)
were investigated for quantitation of steady state transcripts. We selected four time-points corresponding to
the development of pigmentation during seed growth
and maturation for PI 84970 (black seed coats) and PI
567115 B (brown seed coats) (Additional File 4).
Although there are apparently two UF3GT genes
expressed in seed coats in soybean (Glyma07g30180 and
Glyma08g07130), only one of these genes (Glyma08g07130) is not expressed in cotyledon tissue [15].
We elected to focus on this gene for qRT-PCR, as we
noted a virtual absence of ANS or R gene expression in
cotyledons (Figure 3A and 3B).
We observed a near-perfect coefficient of correlation
(R2 = 0.96) between the level of expression (relative to
an internal control CONS6) of the putative R gene and
a UF3GT gene (Glyma08g07130) (Figure 3A and 3C). In
contrast, we observed a weak correlation between
expression of the R gene and ANS gene expression (R2
= 0.66) in the black seed coat line (Figure 3A and 3B).
In the brown seeded line PI 567115 B, no significant
correlation was found between R gene expression levels
and either ANS or UF3GT expression levels (Figure 3AC). During early and mid-development stages R gene
expression is similar in both black and brown seed coat
lines, though R gene expression declined during the last
stages of development of the brown seeded line, in contrast to the high expression noted for the black seed
coat lines (Figure 3A). In striking contrast to the
increase in expression of ANS and UF3GT during seed
coat maturation of the black seed coat line, only negligible ANS and UF3GT expression was observed in the
brown seed coat line as seeds approached maturity (Figure 3B and 3C).
These findings confirmed our hypothesis that loss of
function mutations within Glyma09g36690, an R2R3
MYB gene, are correlated with reduced expression of a
UF3GT gene and ANS genes and with the brown hilum/
seed coat phenotype. It remains to future work to determine the specific DNA sequence targeted by the soybean R2R3 MYB R gene product and its specific
interactions in complexes with basic-helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) transcription factors and WD40 proteins. It is
unclear if the R gene product acts to promote transcriptional activation of both ANS and UF3GT genes, or if
activation of ANS gene expression is due to an indirect
effect.

Discussion
Understanding the genetic factors controlling the accumulation of different colored, easily categorized exterior
pigments (both plant and animal produced) became one
of earliest models for the confirmation and expansion of

Figure 4 Genetic alleles of the R locus/Glyma09g36990 gene. Summary of four loss of function alleles identified from 136 soybean cultivars,
with one example of commonly used soybean accessions listed. The full list of cultivars examined, and allelic status, is listed in Additional File 2.

Mendel’s laws of inheritance. Indeed, modern genetics
owes a strong debt to the white color trait in pea, which
was exploited by Mendel in the original determination
of basic genetic theory [46]. The specific genetic cause
of the white flower phenotype in pea has been ascertained as a point mutation disrupting a splice site within
a bHLH transcription factor [47]. The study of variation
in seed coat colors in many plant species has continued
to be an area of active research for nearly a century.
Over time, a mechanistic understanding of the enzymes
responsible for the individual steps involved in pigment
formation, the chemistry of the pigments, and also the
regulation of those enzymes and pathways by coordinated interaction of transcriptional activators have largely been resolved.
One of the characteristic features of the accumulation of plant pigments that has emerged is the regulation of critical structural genes by R2R3 MYB
transcription factors in complexes with bHLH transcription factors and WD40 proteins [48]. R2R3 MYB
genes tend to display limited homology (aside from the
highly conserved DNA binding region), and the code
by which R2R3 MYB genes bind to specific sequences
has not been well elucidated [45,48]. These difficulties
can complicate phylogenetic analysis and the assignment of genes to paralogous functions. Nevertheless,
the soybean R gene candidate Glyma09g36990 shows
homology to R2R3 MYB genes (Additional File 3). In

the past few years a plethora of R2R3 genes have been
found which directly impact expression of UF3GT
and/or phenylpropanoid pathway derived color compound accumulation in seed coats [49], fruits
[41,50-52], flowers [50,53,54] and other tissues [55-57].
Aside from the aesthetic appeal of colored compounds,
many of these color compounds may have roles as
nutraceuticals [12]. Loss of function mutations within
R2R3 genes have also been discerned as causative for
loss of anthocyanin accumulation in other plant species [57,58]. Although an R2R3 MYB gene(s) would be
logical a priori candidates for the underlying basis of
the R locus, the low level of overall homology among
R2R3 MYB genes, the presence of at least 448 MYB
genes within the soybean genome [59] and the relatively poorly defined genetic map location for the R
locus [25-27] precluded candidate gene analysis prior
to our fine-mapping effort.
Here we used genetic mapping and candidate gene
association in a RIL population and a panel of soybean
lines with defined coloration (seed coat and hilum, pubescence, and flower) to determine the R gene controlling
black or brown seed coat in soybean is the R2R3 MYB
gene Glyma09g36990. Indirect evidence supports a
model in which a functional R gene acts to promote
transcription of the anthocyanidin late pathway structural genes U3FGT as well as ANS. These results are
consistent with many other instances of a transcriptional

regulatory activation control point for genes in the
anthocyanidin pathway [41,49-58].
All of the Glycine soja accessions in the USDA germplasm collection have black seed coats and thus functional versions of the R gene, while Glycine max has
both functional and mutant alleles of the R gene. Three
null alleles of the R gene and one allele with a presumed
severely deleterious missense mutation were present in
our survey of a subset of the soybean germplasm, all of
which are correlated with brown hilum or seed coat colors in our survey. Of the lines containing a mutant R
gene, the three null alleles had frequencies of ~53%,
~21%, and ~19%, while the missense mutation allele had
a frequency of ~6% in our limited survey of 136 divergent lines. This result suggests that multiple independent occurrences of natural mutations from R to r were
selected after soybean domestication but prior to full
dispersion of the crop across Asia, since no clear geographical association can be made for any particular
allele. The absence of selection pressure for seed coat or
hilum color may have allowed broad dispersal of the different alleles. The recently discovered gene for the
determinate growth habit in soybean, dt1, is an ortholog
of the Arabidopsis terminal flower 1 gene [37]. Coincidentally, the dt1 gene also has an identified functional
allele as well as four mutant alleles associated with a
determinate growth phenotype. The mutant dt1 alleles
are present only in Glycine max, but these alleles appear
to have been undergoing selection pressure at early
stages of soybean landrace radiation [37].
Future work may involve targeted overexpression of
R2R3 MYB gene in various cotyledon, seed coat and
other tissues in soybean. Because the R gene appears to
be exquisitely limited in expression to seed coats, overexpression of this gene in other tissues may result in
accumulation of anthocyanins in tissues which lack visible pigments, such as seed cotyledons. Potentially,
expressing this R2R3 MYB gene under control of a seed
storage protein promoter could increase the anthocyanin
content of soybean seeds, in contrast to the wild type
restriction of anthocyanins to seed coats. Though
hypothetical, this may represent a viable, alternate
means to visually select for transgene integration and/or
a visual means to assist in containment of transgenic
lines.

Conclusions
We performed bulk segregant analysis (BSA) [40] on a
F6-RIL population which had segregated for hilum color
[30], derived from a cross between a commercial cultivar with black hila (Jake) and a plant introduction line
with brown hila (PI 283327). We utilized a novel set of
bioinformatically derived SSR markers [35] to fine map
the R gene to less than 200 kilobasepairs, despite using

Page 10 of 12

a RIL population of less than 100 individual F 6 lines.
Analysis of the Williams 82 whole genome shotgun
sequence [32] corresponding to this region revealed four
tandem R2R3 MYB genes as likely candidates for the
authentic R gene. R2R3 MYB transcription factors are
one of the largest transcription factor families in plants
[41,44], and specific R2R3 genes have been identified in
a number of species which activate phenylpropanoid
biosynthetic genes [13,29,41,50,54,56,60,61]. Only one of
the four candidate R2R3 MYB transcription factor genes
(Glyma09g36990) in the genomic region containing R
proved to be expressed in any of the tissues we examined. The seed-coat specific expression of the functional
version of this gene was strongly correlated with the
level of expression of a UF3GT gene (Glyma08g07130),
which encodes a gene product that carries out the final
step in anthocyanin biosynthesis [15]. We discovered an
allelic series of loss of function mutations affecting our
R2R3 gene candidate, and the presence of any of the
four loss of function mutations was perfectly correlated
with the brown seed coat/hilum phenotype in a broad
distribution of soybean cultivars divergent in seed coat,
hilum and flower color. These findings strongly suggest
that loss of function for this particular R2R3 MYB gene
is responsible for the brown seed coat/hilum phenotype
in soybean. The presence of multiple independent alleles
suggests that this gene was selected during domestication either directly for brown coloration or indirectly for
pale hilum colors (due to its epistatic effects with Inhibitor and Tawny).
