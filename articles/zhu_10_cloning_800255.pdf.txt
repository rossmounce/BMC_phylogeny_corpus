Abstract
Background: NruI and Sbo13I are restriction enzyme isoschizomers with the same recognition sequence 5' TCG CGA
3' (cleavage as indicated ). Here we report the cloning of NruI and Sbo13I restriction-modification (R-M) systems in E.
coli. The NruI restriction endonuclease gene (nruIR) was cloned by PCR and inverse PCR using primers designed from
the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The NruI methylase gene (nruIM) was derived by inverse PCR walking.
Results: The amino acid sequences of NruI endonuclease and methylase are very similar to the Sbo13I R-M system
which has been cloned and expressed in E. coli by phage selection of a plasmid DNA library. Dot blot analysis using
rabbit polyclonal antibodies to N6mA- or N4mC-modified DNA indicated that M.NruI is possibly a N6mA-type aminomethyltransferase that most likely modifies the external A in the 5' TCGCGA 3' sequence. M.Sbo13I, however, is
implicated as a probable N4mC-type methylase since plasmid carrying sbo13IM gene is not restricted by Mrr
endonuclease and Sbo13I digestion is not blocked by Dam methylation of the overlapping site. The amino acid
sequence of M.NruI and M.Sbo13I did not show significant sequence similarity to many known aminomethyltransferases in the α, β, and γ groups, except to a few putative methylases in sequenced microbial genomes.
Conclusions: The order of the conserved amino acid motifs (blocks) in M.NruI/M.Sbo13I is similar to the γ. group
amino-methyltranferases, but with two distinct features: In motif IV, the sequence is DPPY instead of NPPY; there are
two additional conserved motifs, IVa and Xa as extension of motifs IV and X, in this family of enzymes. We propose that
M.NruI and M.Sbo13I form a subgroup in the γ group of amino-methyltransferases.
Background
Among the four types of restriction-modification (R-M)
systems discovered from microbial sources based on subunit complexity, ATP/GTP requirement, and methylation-dependency, the Type II restriction endonucleases
(REases) are useful tools in cleaving DNA into specific
fragments for gene cloning and analysis [1]. Type II
restriction endonuclease genes are usually accompanied
by companion methylase genes encoding methylases that
modify the same target sites to avoid self-destruction of
genomic DNA or extra chromosomal DNA [2]. In bacterial warfare, foreign or phage DNAs are unmodified by
the host resident methylases and therefore subjected to

restriction by the companion endonuclease, while "self"
DNA is partially or fully modified and thus resistant to
Type II endonucelase attack. Over 3500 R-M systems
have been found in nature with approximately 300 unique
specificities containing 4-8 bp recognition sequences [3].
There are three major types of base modification in bacteria and archaea: 5mC-methylation of the cytosine
pyrimidine ring carbon producing 5-methylcytosine, N4methylcytosine (N4mC), and N6-methyladenine (N6mA)
[4-6]. In 5mC methylases such as M.HhaI, there are ten
conserved amino acid motifs (blocks) that are arranged in
the order of I to X (circular permutation of motifs IX and
X in 5mC methylases has also been observed previously)
[7,8]. Among the N4mC and N6mA methylases, there are
three major groups of methylases, i.e, α, β, and γ, based
on the order of the amino acid motifs involved in S-ade-

nosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet, methyl donor) binding
(motifs X-I-II-III), catalytic function (motifs IV-V-VIVII-VIII), and DNA target recognizing (TRD) [9,2]. In the
α group of amino-methyltransferases, the AdoMet binding region precedes the TRD and the catalytic region (XI-II-III-TRD-IV-V-VI-VII-VIII, Motif IV = DPPY). In the
β group, the catalytic region is arranged before the TRD
and AdoMet binding region (IV-V-VI-VII-VIII-TRD-X-III-III, motif IV = DPPY or SPPY). In the γ group, the conserved motifs are arranged in the order of AdoMet binding region, catalytic region, and TRD (X-I-II-III-IV-V-VIVII-VIII-TRD, motif IV = NPPY).
The NruI restriction endonuclease (REase or R) and
methyltransferase (methylase or M) are enzymes isolated
from the bacterium Nocardia rubra (Comb D.G., Schildkraut I., Greenough L. unpublished results cited in [3]).
The NruI endonuclease binds to the symmetric sequence
5'-TCGCGA-3' in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and
cleaves the DNA between the G and C in both strands (5'TCG CGA-3'), thus producing DNA fragments with
blunt ends. Sbo13I endonuclease is an NruI isoschizomer
found in the strain Shigella boydii C13 (strain # NCTC
9361) [10]. The goal of this work was cloning of the NruI
R-M system in E. coli. During the initial cloning attempt,
the methylase gene selection strategy [11] was not successful in cloning the nruIM gene, probably as a result of
poor expression of nruIM in E. coli. Therefore, we
sequenced the NruI endonuclease protein and obtained
partial N-terminal amino acid sequence, which was then
used to design degenerate primers for inverse PCR amplification of the coding sequence. Additional PCR reactions were carried out to amplify the entire NruI R-M
system and the nruIR gene was successfully cloned in E.
coli. The Sbo13I R-M system was cloned in E. coli by
phage selection from plasmid expression libraries. When
the M.NruI and M.Sbo13I amino acid sequences were
searched against other known amino-methyltransferases
in protein database in BlastP analysis [12], very little
sequence similarity was detected, except five putative
methylases. We propose that M.NruI and M.Sbo13I
should be included in the γ group of amino-methyltransferases with two distinct features: motif IV is DPPY
instead of NPPY, and two additional amino acid motifs
IVa and Xa are also present, which might be involved in
DNA target recognition or catalytic activity.

Plasmid vectors pUC19, pACYC184, restriction enzymes,
modification enzymes, Taq and Vent® DNA polymerases
were produced at New England Biolabs, Inc (NEB).
Degenerate inverse PCR primers were designed from the
N-terminal NruI amino acid sequence (MGFLADXDLSYDEINELLTDN). The following primers were made by
the NEB Organic Synthesis Division for inverse PCR
amplification of the nruIR coding sequence:
Pho RTCNGCYAARAANCCCA (R = A/G; N = A/T/
C/G; Y = T/C; Pho = 5'Phosphate)
(P270, mixed primers corresponding to aa MGFLAD)
Pho RTCNGCNAGTAANCCCA (P271, mixed primers
corresponding to aa MGFLAD)
Pho TAYGAYGARATHAAYGA (P272, mixed primers
corresponding to aa YDEINE).
Two-step gradient inverse PCR was carried out using
primer pair P270 + P272 or P271 + P272 (DNA denaturing temperature at 95°C for 30 seconds, annealing temperature gradient at 37°C to 55°C for 30 seconds with
0.5°C increase in every cycle, 72°C extension for 2 min, 4
units of Taq DNA polymerase, 200 to 400 ng of endonuclease-digested and self-ligated genomic DNA template
for 35 thermocycles).
Genomic DNA was prepared from 10 g of Nocardia
rubra cells by a modified procedure based on the references [13,14]. Cell paste was resuspended in 35 ml of 0.1
M Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.1 M EDTA. Cell lysis was carried out
by addition of 25 ml of 2 mg/ml fresh lysozyme in 0.1 M
Tris-HCl, 0.1 M EDTA, pH 7.6, with incubation at 37°C
for 1 hour. Protease K was added to the cell lysate at 0.1
mg/ml, with incubation at 37°C for 1 hour. To further
facilitate cell lysis, SDS and sarcosyl solutions were added
to 0.1% and 0.9% final concentration, respectively, with
incubation at 55°C for 1 hour. The lysed cells were subjected to Phenol-CHCl3 extraction (3 ×), and CHCl3
extraction (2×). The nucleic acids were dialyzed in 4 L of
TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA) at
4°C overnight (2×). RNA was removed by digestion with
RNaseA at 37°C for 1 hour. The quality of genomic DNA
was analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel. The size of the
genomic DNA was estimated to be larger than 10 kb.
E. coli cell extracts were prepared as described previously [15]. Native NruI endonuclease was purified from
Nocardia rubra cell lysate by chromatography through
following columns: heparin Hyper-D, Source Q, Affigel
blue, ceramic HTP and Mono Q columns. N-terminus
amino acid sequences were determined by the Edman
degradation method [16]. NruI endonuclease activity was
carried out in a 1× NruI buffer: 100 mM KCl, 50 mM TriHCl, pH 7.7, 10 mM MgCl2, in a total volume of 50 μl at
37°C for 1 h on DNA substrate. Plasmid DNA and inverse
PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Dot blot

analysis using N6mA or N4mC antibodies was carried
out as described previously [17].
Bioinformatic analysis

Multiple sequence alignment of M.NruI and M. Sbo13I,
and methylase homologs were performed using the
PROMALS3D web server [18]. The amino acid sequences
of NruI and Sbo13I and putative isoschizomers were analyzed using the Clustal W web server [19]. MAFFT (v
6.0), using the minimum linkage method, was used to calculate distances from the PROMALS3D alignment and
an unrooted distance tree was constructed for the
M.NruI/M.Sbo13I family of N6mA methylases [20].
Cluster analysis of multiple sequences was carried out
using CLANS to visualize the clustering (formation of
closely related protein families) among the M.NruI/
M.Sbo13I group and known N6mA methyltransferases.
CLANS is a Java utility tool based on the FruchtermanReingold graph layout algorithm [21].

Results and Discussion
Attempt to clone NruI endonuclease gene (nruIR) and
methylase gene (nruIM) by methylase selection method

At first, the methylase selection method [11,13] was used
to clone the nruIM gene, but without success. It's known
that M.NruI exists in the native strain because the
genomic DNA from Nocardia rubra is resistant to NruI
digestion (data not shown). However, the cloning of the
NruI methylase gene (nruIM) proved to be extremely difficult. Dozens of genomic DNA libraries were constructed with different vectors and various enzyme
digested genomic DNA fragments. The plasmid DNA
libraries were subjected to NruI digestion and the
digested DNA was then transferred into a McrBC- Mrr- E.
coli host. But no true resistant clones were ever recovered
(data not shown). The negative results may be due to the
low expression of the methylase gene in E. coli and poor
modification of NruI sites on the plasmid. It's known that
Nocardia has a very high GC contents (the GC contents
of Nocardia farcinica IFM10152 are 70%) [22], and genes
from Nocardia may not be expressed efficiently in E. coli.
Purification of native NruI and N-terminal amino acid
sequencing

Native NruI was purified from Nocardia rubra cell lysates
by chromatography through the following columns: heparin Hyper-D, Source Q, Affigel blue, ceramic HTP and
Mono Q columns. The starting crude extracts had 5.6 ×
106 units, and the final purified enzyme contained 1.5 ×
106 units. The enzyme preparation was only functionally
pure, free of DNA, RNA and other nonspecific nucleases
(data not shown). The purified NruI endonuclease was
subjected to SDS-PAGE and more than ten protein bands
were identified (data not shown). The four bands between

Page 3 of 11

25 kDa and 47.5 kDa were selected and their N-terminus
amino acid sequences were determined by Edman degradation method (most Type IIP restriction enzymes are in
the range of 20 to 50 kDa in molecular masses, see
REBASE). Only the protein band close to 25 kDa produced
a
protein
sequence:
MGFLADXDLSYDEINELLTDN (X, unidentified amino acid residue). The
rest of the protein bands did not yield meaningful data
(data not shown).
Design of degenerate inverse PCR primers and
amplification of nruIR gene by inverse PCR

Genomic DNA was prepared from Nocardia rubra by
phenol-chloroform extractions. One μg of genomic DNA
was digested with individual restriction enzymes with 4-6
recognition sequences. Digested DNA was then purified
and self-ligated at a low DNA concentration. The ligated
DNA was further purified by Qiagen spin columns. The
final volume was 50 μl and 10 μl was used as the template
for degenerate inverse PCR.
The primer pair P271 and P272 with different templates
produced multiple PCR products. A total of 26 PCR DNA
fragments were purified from low-melting agarose gels
and sequenced by primers P271 and P272. DNA sequencing of four inverse PCR products generated a 774-bp
sequence contig. When the DNA sequence was translated into amino acid sequence and compared to known
REases in REBASE, it shows 55% similarity and 46% identity to Sbo13I endonuclease, an NruI isoschizomer (Figures 1 and 2, see below). It is known that isoschizomer
REases sometimes share ~30% to 95% amino acid
sequence identity [3,23]. So this high degree of sequence
similarity confidently identified this 774-bp contig to be
the gene fragment encoding part of the NruI REase. The

Figure 2 CLUSTAL W multiple sequence alignment of NruI, Sbo13I, and two putative restriction enzymes CmaR (protein ID: ZP_04834997,
a helix-turn-helix domain protein found in Corynebacterium matruchotii, ATCC 14266) and RspRS_ORF4066 found in the sequenced genome of Roseiflexus sp. RS-1. The marks "*" and ":" indicate identical aa residues and aa residues with similar properties respectively.

other inverse PCR products were presumably amplified
from genomic DNA non-specifically and discarded.
The remaining DNA of the NruI R-M system was
obtained by further inverse PCRs. The NruI R-M system
consists of R and M genes running in the opposite direction and the two genes were separated by a large gap
(326-bp non-coding sequence) (Figure 1). The nruIM
gene is 804 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 267 amino
acids, and the nruIR gene is 660 bp coding for a polypeptide of 219 amino acids (Figure 1). The N-terminus of the
translated nruIR is MGFLEDWDLSYDEINELTDN (Figure 2), which closely matches the N-terminal aa sequence
derived from the native NruI endonuclease
(MGFLADXDLSYDEINELLTDN). Another new finding
was that when the amino acid sequence of M.NruI was
compared to other known amino-methyltransferases in
GenBank and REBASE by blastx/blastp, M.NruI only
shows sequence similarity to M.Sbo13I and a few other

putative methylases. M.NruI/M.Sbo13I and a few others
share a unique amino acid sequence similarity among the
DNA amino-methyltransferases. This high degree of
amino acid sequence similarity was not found in other
N4C or N6A methylases (more detailed sequence comparison below).
BlastP analysis using NruI as a query also identified two
additional putative endonucleases Cma ORF1763 (GenBank ID: ZP_04834997) from Corynebacterium matruchotii ATCC 14266 (annotated as a helix-turn-helix XREfamily DNA binding protein) and RspRS ORF4066 found
in the sequenced genome of Roseiflexus sp. RS-1 (GenBank accession number CP000686, coordinate 50950665095614, complement strand sequence). Figure 2 shows
the Clustal W multiple sequence alignment of NruI,
Sbo13I, Cma ORF1763 (ZP_04834997), and RspRS
ORF4066R. The predicted catalytic sites in NruI, Sbo13I
and Cma ORF1763 (ZP_04834997) are PD-X21-EVK or

Zhu et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:139
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/139

DD-X21-EVK. In RspRS ORF4066R, however, the predicted catalytic residues are DD-X20-QIK (Mrr endonuclease-like catalytic site) [24]. The endonuclease activity
of Cma ORF1763 (ZP_04834997) and RspRS ORF4066R
remains to be examined by experimentation. There are
putative
companion
methylases
(ZP_04834998;
YP_001278360 = RspRS_ORF4066M, complete genome
coordinate 5094219 to 5095064) adjacent to Cma
ORF1763 (ZP_04834997) and RspRS ORF4066R respectively that show significant sequence similarity to
M.NruI/M.Sbo13I (see below). The gene organization of
the two putative NruI isoschizomers is shown in Figure 1.
Similar to NruI and Sbo13I, the homologous R-M genes
are transcribed in opposite directions, but lacking a large
non-coding region between the R-M genes.
Cloning of Sbo13I Restriction modification system in E. coli

Sbo13I restriction endonuclease and modification methylase were derived from Shigella boydii C13 [10]. Sbo13I
and NruI recognize the same DNA sequence TCG/CGA
and cleave at the same position. Previous results indicated that the Sbo13I R-M system was encoded by a resident plasmid (data not shown). Plasmid DNA of Shigella
boydii C13 was prepared by the cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density centrifugation method.
One isolate (A5) was used to map the 5.4 kb restriction
system-containing plasmid for single restriction sites.
The purified A5 isolate DNA was then digested with ClaI,
HindIII and NsiI, respectively and ligated into pUC19 or
pBR322 (CIP-treated with compatible ends). The ligated
DNA was used to transform E. coli strain RR1 and
selected on LB agar Amp plates. AmpR transformants
were picked into 200 μl of LB with antibiotic into microtiter plates. Master plates were prepared by stamping on

Page 5 of 11

LB with antibiotic. Replica plates were prepared by
stamping onto four levels of T7 phage: 109, 107, 105, and
103 phage/plate. Individual colonies which survived at all
levels of phage infection were considered to be phageresistant and hence likely to carry an active restriction
system.
A number of plasmids were found to carry ClaI or NsiI
fragments of approximately 5.4 kb in length and these
plasmids were resistant to Sbo13I digestion. These plasmids were subsequently shown to carry the complete
Sbo13I R-M system. The recombinant plasmid
pBLSboC13M8.1 which carries the gene encoding the
Sbo13I restriction endonuclease and methylase was
transferred into E. coli strain RR1 by transformation.
Approximately, 105 units of Sbo13I REase per gram of wet
cell paste were produced from the expression strain (data
not shown). The sbo13IR and sbo13IM genes were
sequenced by the Sanger sequencing method (data not
shown). The gene organization of the Sbo13I R-M system
is shown in Figure 1. Similar to the NruI R-M system, the
sbo13IR and sbo13IM genes are transcribed in opposite
directions. In addition, there is a controller gene sbo13IC
in front of the sbo13IR gene, which may regulate the transcription of the R gene, by analogy to the PvuII and BclI
controller proteins [25,26].
The NruI endonuclease was expressed in pre-modified
E. coli hosts and the recombinant NruI endonuclease was
purified (ZZ, SYX, unpublished results).

were spotted on the membrane for detection.

pUC19-sbo13IRM were transferred into E. coli DB24
(deficient in Dam methylase, Dcm methylase, McrBC,

primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for N6methyladenine (N6mA) or N4-methylcytosine (N4mC).
M.NruI-modified DNA shows positive signal at 25 ng to
150 ng DNA dot blot, similar to the signal generated by
the positive control N6 adenine methylases M.EcoRI,
M.ApoI, and M.BpmI (Figure 3, left panel). M.Sbo13Imodified total DNA generated background signal at 25
ng to 150 ng with the same antibodies (Figure 3, left
panel, compare negative control-empty vector with
M.Sbo13I-modified DNA). Dot blots using anti-N4mC
antibodies produced a strong signal from M.Sbo13Imodified total DNA, similar to the signals generated by
two known N4mC methylases M.BamHI or M.BglIImodified DNA (Figure 3, right panel) [27,28]. Based on
the dot blot analysis we concluded that M.NruI is probably an N6-adenine methylase that most likely modifies
the external A in TCGCGA sequence. Consistent with
this result, Dam methylation at the overlapping TCGCGAtc sequence also blocks NruI digestion [29]. M.Sbo13I
is probably an N4mC methyltransferase based on the fol-

lowing evidences: 1) rabbit N4mC antibodies generated
strong dot blot signal; 2) plasmid carrying sbo13IM gene
was not restricted by Mrr endonuclease in transformation experiment (data not shown); 3) Dam methylase
modified DNA sequence TCGCGmAtc can be cleaved by
Sbo13I [29]; 4) M.Sbo13I is somewhat similar to a known
N4mC methyltransferase M.Hpy99I although the similarity is at the border line. The final proof of modified bases
by M.Sbo13I may be derived from DNA oligos modified
by purified M.Sbo13I, which remains to be studied.
Sequence comparison of M.NruI and M. Sbo13I

Comparison of M.NruI and M.Sbo13I amino acid
sequences indicates that they are significantly similar to
each other (49% aa sequence identity). Furthermore,
these enzymes may form a new family (cluster) of methyltransferases based on their lack of similarity to many
other known methyltransferases available in REBASE.
Alternatively, they may belong to a subgroup of already
established α, β and γ groups of N6mA methyltransferases (Malone et al. 1995).
The other members of this family (cluster) were identified by querying M.NruI and M.Sbo13I protein
sequences against non-redundant protein sequences
(NR) and REBASE databases using BlastP searches. Sig-

nificant hits with an expectation value <1E-20 and
sequence length of more than 200 amino acids were considered potential M.NruI and M.Sbo13I homologs (putative isoschizomer). M.NruI and M.Sbo13I enzymes share
amino acid sequence similarities with proteins

ATCC_14266 from Corynebacterium matruchotii), and
M.Rca13941ORF2728P (DSM 13941 from Roseiflexus
castenholzii).
To identify the conserved amino acid motifs (blocks)
we performed a multiple sequence alignment of M.NruI/
M.Sbo13I family enzymes using PROMALS3D. Figure 4
illustrates the conserved amino acid sequence motifs
(blocks) in the alignment of the M.NruI/M.Sbo13I family

sequences. Motifs are labelled using the nomenclature of
Posfai et al. and Malone et al. [7,9]. The putative motifs
identified in the M.NruI/M.Sbo13I family have some similarities to standard motifs defined in the reference [9]
which are listed as below.
i.Motif I contains a core G-loop (Gly-X-Gly) tripeptide that may bind the methionine moiety of AdoMet.
X indicates any amino acid.
ii.Motif II contains a charged residue at the end of a
predicted β strand which may interact with ribose
hydroxyls of AdoMet. It is followed by a bulky hydrophobic side-chain (Ile or Leu) that may make van der
Waals contact with the adenine of AdoMet.
iii.Motif IV contains a P-loop, DPPY motif, which
may form the active site, along with motifs V to VIII.
Superficially, the DPPY motif suggests that M.NruI
and M.Sbo13I may be related to the α group of N6mA
methyltransferases. However, the phylogenetic distance analysis indicates otherwise.
iv.Motif V contains the consensus Asp-Leu-Tyr-X-XAla-(Gly/Ser) which differs from the standard motif V
(Asn/Asp-Leu-Tyr-X-X-Phe-(Leu/Val/Ile) defined in
the literature for the γ group of N6mA methyltrans-

ferases. The first three amino acids are the same as
standard amino acids, but the last two amino acids
are different.
v.Motif VI starts with Gly and ends with a hydrophobic amino acid (Val) which is very similar to the standard motif defined in literature.
vi.Motif VII is highly hydrophobic which is consistent
with the standard motif. This hydrophobic region
may interact with the target DNA adenine.
vii.Motif X is located at the N-terminus of the primary sequence and contains conserved hydrophobic
residues.
Figures 4 and 5 also show that Motifs X and V have
some extra conserved regions compared with the standard motifs. We also identified two additional amino acid
motifs (blocks) that may be involved in DNA target site
recognition or methyl donor cofactor binding. Motif IVa
is located between putative motif IV and V, and Xa is
located at the N-terminus (motifs IVa and Xa could be

extension of motifs IV and X). To identify to which clade
(group) of methyltransferases M.NruI/M.Sbo13I belongs,
we performed a phylogenetic analysis of M.NruI/
M.Sbo13I to known groups of N6-methyladenine methyltransferases. To construct the phylogenetic tree, a multiple sequence alignment of M.NruI/M. Sbo13I and
homologs was obtained using the PROMALS3D web
server [18] and the three recognized groups of Type II
N6mA methyltransferases (α, β and γ) separately.
MAFFT (version 6.0) using the minimum linkage method
was used to calculate distances from the PROMALS3D
alignment and an unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed for the M.NruI/M.Sbo13I and closely related
enzymes and other Type II N6mA methyltransferases
(Figure 6). From the unrooted distance tree, it is apparent
that M.NruI/M.Sbo13I and their relatives form a unique
clade (subgroup) among the γ group N6mA methyltransferases. Furthermore, we performed cluster analysis of
sequences using CLANS to visualize the similarities

analysis of proteins in GenBank using the M.NruI amino
acid sequence as a query revealed five additional putative
amino-methylases that share similar motif organization.
The M.NruI/M.Sbo13I family enzymes appear to belong
to the γ group of amino-methyltransferases with two distinct features: Motif IV contains DPPY instead of NPPY
sequence; two additional motifs (IVa and Xa) are also
present, which may be involved in target recognition and
AdoMet binding. Despite the extensive amino acid
sequence similarity between M.NruI and M.Sbo13I,
M.NruI is most likely an N6mA amino-methyltransferase
and M.Sbo13I is likely an N4mC methyltransferase.
Competing interests
The authors have a competing financial interest in NruI endonuclease. They
have no financial interests in Sbo13I endonuclease, M.NruI, and M.Sbo13I.

within the M.NruI/M.Sbo13I family and other known
groups of N6mA methyltransferases. CLANS is a Java
utility tool based on the Fruchterman-Reingold graph
layout algorithm [21]. Figure 7 clearly illustrates that
M.NruI/M.Sbo13I and related enzymes forms their separate cluster that is distinct from other known γ group
N6mA methyltransferases. It is very likely that although
the protein structure and function of the M.NruI/
M.Sbo13I family is conserved among members of N6mA
methyltransferases, their primary amino acid sequences
have diverged quite significantly from the common
ancestor. This conclusion was supported by the BlastP
results that M.NruI amino acid sequence query failed to
identify any significant hits to known N6mA methylases
in GenBank. BlastP using M.Sbo13I as query, however,
found some weak amino acid sequence homology with
M.Hp99I and M.NgoMXV, which are known N4mC
methylases.
Figure 8 further illustrates the motif organization of
established groups of methyltransferases and the
M.NruI/M.Sbo13I family. M.VspI [30] appears to share
the motifs organization of the M.NruI/M.Sbi13I family,
but belongs to a different clade in the unrooted phylogenetic tree.

Conclusions
Both NruI and Sbo13I R-M systems have been cloned in
E. coli. BlastP analysis of proteins in GenBank indicated
that two ORFs are probable isoschizomers of NruI/SboI
or enzymes with similar recognition sequence. BlastP
