Abstract
Background: The ubiquitous LysM motif recognizes peptidoglycan, chitooligosaccharides (chitin)
and, presumably, other structurally-related oligosaccharides. LysM-containing proteins were first
shown to be involved in bacterial cell wall degradation and, more recently, were implicated in
perceiving chitin (one of the established pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and lipo-chitin
(nodulation factors) in flowering plants. However, the majority of LysM genes in plants remain
functionally uncharacterized and the evolutionary history of complex LysM genes remains elusive.
Results: We show that LysM-containing proteins display a wide range of complex domain
architectures. However, only a simple core architecture is conserved across kingdoms. Each
individual kingdom appears to have evolved a distinct array of domain architectures. We show that
early plant lineages acquired four characteristic architectures and progressively lost several
primitive architectures. We report plant LysM phylogenies and associated gene, protein and
genomic features, and infer the relative timing of duplications of LYK genes.
Conclusion: We report a domain architecture catalogue of LysM proteins across all kingdoms.
The unique pattern of LysM protein domain architectures indicates the presence of distinctive
evolutionary paths in individual kingdoms. We describe a comparative and evolutionary genomics
study of LysM genes in plant kingdom. One of the two groups of tandemly arrayed plant LYK genes
likely resulted from an ancient genome duplication followed by local genomic rearrangement, while
the origin of the other groups of tandemly arrayed LYK genes remains obscure. Given the fact that
no animal LysM motif-containing genes have been functionally characterized, this study provides
clues to functional characterization of plant LysM genes and is also informative with regard to
evolutionary and functional studies of animal LysM genes.

Background
The Lysin motif (LysM), usually 42–48 amino acids in
length, is a ubiquitous modular cassette found in virtually
every living organism except for Archaea [1,2]. X-ray crystallography and homology-modeling of LysM motifs
revealed a symmetrical βααβ topology with the two α hel-

ices residing on one side of a two-stranded antiparallel βsheet [1,3,4]. A detailed domain folding study indicated
that the LysM domain folds in a stepwise and robust manner [5]. In bacteria, LysM proteins are generally involved
in bacterial cell wall degradation by anchoring enzymatic
domains to the cell wall through binding to peptidoglyPage 1 of 13

can (PGN), a linear form of alternatively β1→4 linked Nacetyl-muramic acid and N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc)
[6,7]. A LysM-containing receptor-like protein (LYP)
(lacking a kinase domain), CEBiP, was shown in rice to
biochemically bind chitin, a β1→4 linked homopolymer
of N-acetylglucosamine [8]. In Arabidopsis, LysM-containing receptor-like kinases (LYKs) were genetically
defined as receptors for chitin [9,10]. Chitin is a major
component of the fungal cell wall and an established
pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Hence,
these LYKs were implicated in the plant defense response
to fungal pathogens. In contrast, other LYKs (e.g., NFR1,
NFR5) were genetically defined as receptors for the rhizobial nodulation factor [11-13], an acylated, substituted
chitin oligomer. In this case, these receptors are coupled
to a complex plant developmental pathway leading to the
formation of a novel organ, the nodule, in which nitrogen
fixing, symbiotic bacteria reside. Although no direct evidence exists in vertebrates, the LysM domain is presumably capable of binding peptidoglycan, chitin and
structurally-related oligosaccharide molecules in these
organisms.
In a previous study, we categorized LysM motifs across
kingdoms into a minimum of 11 distinctive types [2]. The
phylogenetic gene family topology based on LysM motif
sequences revealed several multiple-kingdom clades.
Interestingly, several bacterial-rooted LysM clades contained sequences from fungi, insects, plants and animals.
This suggested that some LysM motif patterns may have
origins predating the divergence of fungal, plant and animal kingdoms, while other LysM motifs may have originated in a convergent manner [2]. Besides the great
diversity among LysM motifs, the numbers of LysM motifs
within individual LysM proteins range from one to twelve.
Moreover, LysM motifs are often associated with a diversity of other protein domains. The diversity of the LysM
motifs and associated domains makes it possible to create
a catalog of distinguishable LysM protein domain architectures. In the Pfam database, LysM motifs are associated
with over 50 domains and LysM proteins display 241
domain
architectures
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/fam
ily?acc=PF01476. Although the LysM domain is associated with a variety of protein domains across kingdoms, it
is intriguing that some associations are distinct to particular kingdoms. For example, LYK proteins are only present
in plants [1,2]. Nevertheless, the evolutionary dynamics
of LysM protein architectures in individual kingdoms,
especially the plant kingdom, have not been clearly
defined.
The last six years have seen a great leap forward in our
understanding of the biological functions of plant LysM
proteins. At the same time, a large number of uncharacterized plant LysM-protein sequences were deposited in pub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/183

lic databases. Little is known regarding the origins,
evolution, common gene and protein features, and comparative genomics of these plant LysM genes. A multipledimension "atlas" (within and across species, considering
phylogenetic context) of plant LysM genes is needed to
better understand this important gene family in the entire
plant kingdom.
The ubiquity of LysM genes across kingdoms, especially
within the plant kingdom, makes it an appropriate candidate gene family to study the evolution and impact of
polyploidy on plant genomes. The genomes of soybean
(Glycine max) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) have a
greater number of LYK genes than Arabidopsis, rice and
Medicago truncatula, probably due to the influence of an
additional genome duplication in each of the Glycine and
Populus genera. Tandemly arrayed LYK gene pairs were
identified in legume and poplar plants, but not in rice,
suggesting that these tandem gene duplications or local
genome rearrangements occurred only in certain plant lineages [2].
In this study, we report a domain architecture catalogue of
LysM proteins across kingdoms and reconstruct evolutionary scenarios of LysM genes in the plant kingdom.
While a simple core domain architecture of LysM proteins
is conserved across kingdoms, each individual kingdom
has a unique array of domain architectures. Compared to
green algae such as Chlamydomonas, the moss Physcomitrella possesses a more diverse set of LysM proteins,
including LYK, LYP, and LysM-containing F-box proteins.
More importantly, these LysM architectures persist
throughout all major plant lineages. In contrast, gymnosperms appear to have lost diversity among the LysM proteins. We calculated majority-ruled parsimony
phylogenies of plant LysM genes and present associated
gene, protein and genomic features along with the phylogenies. We also investigated the relative timing and patterns of large-scale duplications of LYK genes. Our
analysis shows that a block of tandemly arrayed LYK genes
likely resulted from an ancient genome duplication followed by local genome rearrangements. This study will
provide clues to functional characterization of plant LysM
genes and be informative to functional studies of animal
LysM genes.

Results
LysM domain architectures across kingdoms
Although the LysM domain family is relatively small compared to the top 20 PFAM domain families in terms of the
number of sequences, it displays a much wider range
of domain architectures than 10 of the top 20 domain
families
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk//family/browse?
browse=top%20twenty. The association of LysM with a
kinase domain appears to be present only in the plant

kingdom. However, it remains unclear whether other
individual kingdoms possess unique domain architectures. To this end, we surveyed the LysM domain arrangements of over 5600 sequences curated in the Pfam
database and drew all architectures represented by more
than 5 sequences (3ure 1). The simplest architecture, containing only one LysM motif, is present in all kingdoms.
Consistent with the inter-kingdom conservation of this
type of LysM protein, the LysM motifs of this family are
also conserved, as revealed by sequence alignment, and
they form a complete clade in a parsimony phylogeny that
is distinguishable from other LysM-motif clades [2]. Proteins containing 2 LysM motifs and a peptidase domain
are present in prokaryotes, green algae, and Physcomitrella,
a non-vascular plant. Indeed these two architectures are
the most common, comprising about one third of the

LysM sequences curated in the Pfam database. Similar to
the unique occurrence of LYK in the plant kingdom, a few

and
LysM+chitin

LysM+TLD, and LysM+GRAM+TLD in animals. This suggests that LysM proteins in different kingdoms evolved
specialized architectures and likely distinct functions.
Moreover, compared to other kingdoms, the prokaryotic
kingdom displays more diversified LysM domain architectures, which is reflected by the variation in the numbers
and the sequences of LysM motifs and the domains associated with the LysM domain. Plant LysM proteins, except

The domain catalogue of LysM proteins across kingdoms
The domain catalogue of LysM proteins across kingdoms. Only domain architectures with more than 5 occurrences in
the Pfam database were diagramed roughly to scale. Domains were represented as different symbols and domain names were
labeled beneath the diagrams except for the LysM domain, which is not labeled. The domain architectures above the dash line
are conserved across different kingdoms and those below the dash line are distinct to each kingdom. The black brackets
denote that the numbers of LysM are variable, ranging from 0 to 11 in prokaryotes, fungi and animal kingdoms and ranging from
0 to 2 in plant LYK proteins. The apparent lack of architectural diversity in Pinus is most likely due to the incomplete genome
sequence of this species. The predicted subcellular localizations of LysM proteins in plants are also illustrated by drawing the
transmembrane domain and drawing the diagram from N- to C-terminus. The incidence of individual architectures in plants is
labeled on the right of the diagram. The numbers in filled circles denote the overall architectures in the entire genome and
those in open circles are incomplete due to the lack of sufficient genome sequences.

motifs, contains no more than 3 copies of the LysM
motifs. Like prokaryotic LysM proteins, multiple LysM
domains are always distinct. In contrast, LysMs in fungi
and animals are usually similar at the level of primary
sequences. An extraordinary example is a nematode gene
(NP_504862), which contains 12 nearly identical tandem
LysM motifs.
Besides LYK, we identified other architectures that are
unique to and common in the plant kingdom (Figure 1).
The F-box+LysM combination is found not only in mosses
and angiosperm plants but also in green algae. LYP and
extracellular LysM (LysMe) are the other two common
architectures that are unique in plants. Interestingly,
angiosperm plants have apparently lost a few architectures
present in green algae and mosses, such as peptidase+LysM; C2+LysM; LysM+B3; and LysM+thioredoxin
(Figure 1). This suggests that overall gross diversity of
LysM protein architectures has decreased in angiosperm
plants.
The copy numbers of intracellular non-secretory LysM
genes (LysMn) are similar in the ten plant genomes we
examined. The same also holds true for F-box+LysM
genes, and LYP genes (Figure 1). In particular, the Fbox+LysM gene appears to be single-copy in these plant
genomes, except for poplar and soybean, each with two
copies (Figure 1). In contrast, there is clearly an expansion
of the LYK gene family in virtually all genomes examined,
and of the LysMe genes in the poplar and soybean
genomes. The LYK gene family has expanded in the
angiosperms; for example, there are 2 LYKs in Physcomitrella (bryophytes), 5 LYKs in the Selaginella (lycophytes), and 21 LYKs in Glycine max (Figure 1).
Phylogenies and comparative genomics of LysM genes
We examined the phylogenetic relationships of the LYK,
LYP, LysMe and LysMn protein families by calculating
majority-rule parsimony topologies based on the fulllength protein sequences. We grouped a total of 76 LYKs
from 10 species into 6 multi-plant-family clades and a
small group containing only MtLYK10 and 11 (Figure 2).
Clades I and II share a similar topology and species composition. Interestingly, LYKs in the "primitive" plant genera, Physcomitrella and Selaginella, are found in clades I and
VI. PpLYK1 and PpLYK2, located at the basal branches of
clades I and VI. Clades I and VI are "complete" in the sense
that they contain sequences from all sampled plant lineages. Most of the legume LYKs in subclades VIA and IA
were genetically defined as the putative receptors of nodulation factors. Yet the non-legume LYKs orthologous to
these putative nodulation factor receptors are functionally
undefined. This arrangement suggests a structural, and
presumed functional, conservation in plants, with more
recent specialization in legumes for nodulation factor recognition. One functional possibility for the non-legume

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/183

LYK proteins in clade I is as receptors for a postulated signal required for mycorrhizal infection. For example, it is
interesting to note that there are no Arabidopsis LYK genes
in clade I, consistent with the fact that this plant does not
establish a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhiza. In
addition to the nodulation factor receptors, the Arabidopsis chitin receptor is also found in clade VI, consistent with
the notion that chitin recognition is a more ancient trait
from which nodulation factor recognition evolved [2].
In order to better illustrate the relationships among the
various LYK proteins, Figure 2 also shows the gene and
genomic features of each clade in conjunction with the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). Most LYKs in subclade IA
have a conserved domain architecture, with 3 LysM motifs
and a non-functional kinase domain lacking the P-loop
and the activation motif [2]. Similarly, clade V contains
only one LysM motif. Most LYKs in clade I and II have a
simple gene structure with only one exon, while LYKs in
clade V and VI possess a complex gene structure with more
than 10 exons. However, most of these introns are embedded in the region encoding for the kinase domain, while
the LysM domains are encoded by an uninterrupted exon
(data not shown). Interestingly, 28 out of 79 LYKs in this
study are tandemly arrayed in several genomes [2].
Namely, 35% of LYKs are tandemly arrayed, which is
higher than the average level of tandemly arrayed genes in
Arabidopsis, (~16%), rice (~14%) and poplar (11%) [1416]. Subclade IA LysMs are oriented head-to-head with
LysMs in subclade IIA, while LYKs in subclade VIA are oriented in a head-to-tail manner with LYKs in subclade VIB
[2]. However, tandemly arrayed LYKs were not identified
in monocots, suggesting that tandem duplication of these
genes may have occurred after the split of monocot and
dicot plants.
We grouped a total of 39 LYPs from 9 species into 3 clades
(Figure 3). The clades I and III contain LYPs exclusively
from angiosperm plants, while the clade II contains LYPs
from both diverse eudicots and monocots as well as LYPs
from P. Taeda and P. patens. Compared to clades I and III,
sequences in clade II have a higher rate of coding changes,
as evidenced by the longer maximum-likelihood branch
lengths on the topology (Figure 3). All LYPs have exactly
2 LysM motifs without exceptions. At the primary
sequence level and dictated by their phylogenetic topology (data not shown), the first LysM motif, designated as
motif A, of all LYPs is highly similar and was previously
denoted as the plant LysM type VI [2]. In contrast, the second motif, designated as motif B, diverges. The motif B in
clade I and II, denoted as plant LysM motif VIII, is different from that in clade III denoted as plant LysM motif VII
[2]. The majority of LYPs contain a signal peptide.
Although a few have a predicted transmembrane domain,
about one third of them, especially LYPs in clade I, have a
predicted GPI anchor that may function to anchor the

Phylogenetic topology of plant LYK proteins
Phylogenetic topology of plant LYK proteins. A majority-ruled parsimony tree with maximum-likelihood branch lengths
was calculated using full-length LYK sequences. Bootstrap values of 1000 independent trees larger than 70 were labeled on
each branch. The tree was rooted using two algae sequences, Vc_chitinase (AAC13727) and CrLMR2 (EDP05962). Major
clades are separated by solid horizontal lines and subclades are separated by dashed lines. On the right, the numbers of the
LysM motifs are aligned in the first column, followed by the numbers of exons in the middle column, and tandemly arrayed

Phylogenetic topology of plant LYP proteins
Phylogenetic topology of plant LYP proteins. A majority-ruled parsimony tree with maximum-likelihood branch lengths
was calculated using full-length LYP sequences. Bootstrap values of 1000 independent trees larger than 50 are labeled on each
branch. The tree was rooted using the algae sequence Creye2 (AAF43040). Detailed diagrams of each LYP clade are drawn.
The classification types of LysM motifs described in Zhang et al. (2007) are shown along with the diagrams. The vertical bar
denotes the presence of either a transmembrane domain or a predicted GPI anchor site. Note the correlation between the
length of the whole protein and the length of the C-terminal tails.
protein to the plasma membrane (Figure 3). Therefore,
about half of the LYP are predicted to be directly or indirectly localized to the plasma membrane. In terms of
amino acid (aa) lengths, clade I LYPs generally are the
longest (mean ± SE, 409 ± 2.4), followed by clade III LYPs
(366 ± 11.7), while clade II LYPs are the shortest (270 ±
15.7). Despite the difference in their aa length, the position of the LysM motifs are relatively fixed with motif A at
about position 110–150 and motif B at about position
170–220 (data not shown). Therefore, the lengths of the
C-terminal tail are directly proportional to full protein
length. Generally, the clade I tails (193 ± 2.8) contain a
predicted GPI anchor, only a few of the clade III tails (149

± 8.2) have a predicted GPI anchor, and the clade II tails
(46 ± 9.7) lack a predicted GPI anchor (Figure 3.).
The LysMe proteins are about 100–120 aa in length and
are the smallest group of LysM proteins in plants. All
LysMe genes possess a very simple, intron-less gene structure. The LysMe proteins contain only one LysM motif
without exception and the LysM motifs in LysMe proteins
are the most conserved at the primary sequence level with
an identity of 91% in a survey of 30 LysMe proteins from
various plant species [2]. A total of 45 LysMe proteins
from 9 species were grouped into 4 clades (Figure 4).

and a Selaginella sequence (see Additional file 3).

A total of 41 LysMn proteins (including F-box+LysM proteins) from 9 species were grouped into 2 clades (Figure

distinctive subclades, angiosperm subclade and F-box
subclade, were identified in each clade, respectively. The
first subclade within the clade I contains sequences only
from angiosperm plants and the average maximum-likelihood branch length is shorter than that of the other subclade, which contains mostly sequences from mosses. The
first subclade within the clade II is a complete clade
rooted with a green algae F-box+LysM (LysMn1) protein
and contains LysMn1 proteins from all major lineages of
land plants. Together with the fact that LysMn1 is a singlecopy gene in most genomes (Figure 1), this implicates a
conservation of their biological function. Similarly the F-

Microsynteny of orthologous LysM genes
Phylogenetic topology is useful in deciphering gene
orthology or paralogy, but is not sufficient in most cases.
Collinearity of genes (or "microsynteny") across different
species can be used as supporting evidence. Indeed, a total
of 11 orthologous blocks of NFR5-like genes from 6
angiosperm species showed extensive microsynteny. A
degraded microsynteny was also identified in NFR1-like
orthologous regions in legume species [2]. This suggests
that the functionally related NFR5 and NFR1 genes
derived from a single duplicated ancestral genomic
region. We identified additional regions of microsynteny
for the LYP, LysMe and LysMn genes. Extensive microsynPage 7 of 13

teny exists for LysMn1 (F-box+LysM) orthologous regions
in the soybean, Medicago, poplar, and Arabidopsis
genomes (Figure 6a), suggesting a genome conservation
that mirrors the high sequence conservation of these proteins (Figure 5). OsLYP1, also known as the rice chitin
elicitation binding protein (OsCEBiP), is the only LYP to
which a biological function has been assigned [8]. It is
capable of directly binding of chitin and was implicated in
chitin-triggered immune responses. Microsynteny was
observed in OsLYP1 orthologous regions in the rice, soybean, poplar and Arabidopsis genomes (Figure 6b), suggesting a possible conservation of function across these
species.
LYK gene duplications and genome polyploidy
It has been estimated that most, if not all, flowering
plants, have one or more genome duplication events in
their history [17-19]. The great expansion of the LYK gene
family (Figure 1 and 2) is likely due to two rounds of independent genome doubling events followed by functional
speciation. The LYK phylogenetic topology clearly reveals
several rounds of gene duplications, especially the duplication event giving rise to the clades I and II (since the
subclades IA and IIA are tandemly arrayed in their
genomes). However, little is known regarding the timing
of these duplications. In order to better understand the
plant genome doubling events, we inferred the recent
chronological order of these LYK duplication events by
measuring the synonymous nucleotide substitutions per
site (Ks) of duplicated genes, which is a common practice
in dating gene duplication events. [18-23].

The clade-clade pairwise synonymous distance estimates
involving clades III to V produce Ks values averaging
greater than 4.0 (data not shown), indicating that they are
likely the results of very ancient duplications and, therefore, very difficult to accurately predict. Therefore, we
focused on the duplications between clades I and II and
between the subclades VIA and VIB (Figure 2). Pairwise
synonymous estimates between clades I and II revealed
two peaks at 2.2 ± 0.2 and 4.2 ± 0.2, respectively (Figure
7a), suggesting two separate gene duplications, consistent
with two genome duplications. The second peak at 4.2 ±
0.2 probably reflects the split between clades I and II and
is unusually high. The duplication peaked at 2.2 ± 0.2
probably reflects the split between paralogous subclades
(i.e., IA-IB and IIA-IIB) and is shared by flowering plants.
Indeed, pairwise estimates between paralogous subclades
IA-IB and between IIA-IIB both have a peak centered at 2.2
(Figure 7b, c). These suggest that the splits between IA-IB
and IIA-IIB, observed in both monocot and dicot plants
(Figure 2), likely resulted from the same genome duplication event. This split is assumed to have occurred at
approximately 300 million years ago (mya) assuming a
constant rate of 6.1 synonymous substitution per site
every one billion years [20]. Consistent with this, ancient

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/183

duplications in Arabidopsis were reported within this
same time window [21,22]. The subclades IA and IIA are
tandemly arrayed together in a head-to-head manner (Figure 2). This arrangement could have resulted from either
a tandem gene duplication or from a whole genome
duplication followed by local gene rearrangements. However, the tandem array of the subclades IA and IIA was
observed only in Rosid plants. The split between the subclades IA and IIA, estimated at approximately 300 mya,
appears to have occurred earlier than the emergence of
dicot plants, which was estimated at 170–235 mya [24].
This suggests that the common ancestors of the subclades
IA and IIA were not tandemly duplicated but were tandemly arrayed together likely through a large-scale
genome rearrangement shortly before the emergence of
Rosid plants. The subclades VIA and VIB are also tandemly
arrayed in legume and Vitis genomes (Figure 3). The
median value of pairwise estimates between VIA-VIB is
0.73 (data not shown) and is close to the values of 0.71
reported by Schlueter et al. (2004) and of 0.57 reported by
Pfeil et al. (2005). This peak likely reflects a recent legume
genome doubling event estimated at 54 mya [19,23,25].
We noticed 16 pairs of soybean LysM genes from the four
phylogenetic topologies (Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5) that are
highly similar at the protein sequence level (see Additional file 1). These likely represent homeologous gene
pairs resulting from the most recent genome doubling
event in soybean. The pairwise synonymous distances
between these homeologous pairs fall within 0–0.40 and
have a peak at 0.13 ± 0.03 (Figure 7d). This is close to the
value of 0.188 reported by Schlueter et al. (2005). Assuming a rate of 6.1 synonymous substitutions per site every
one billion years [20], the values for the LysM genes estimate this duplication event at approximately 14 mya,
which is consistent with previous studies [19,23,25].

Discussion
LysM protein domain architectures
The LysM motif is a ubiquitous protein module found in
association with a wide variety of protein domains, thus
creating a tremendous diversity of domain architectures.
Interestingly, only a simple core LysM architecture is conserved across different kingdoms and each individual
kingdom has its own characteristic architectures (Figure
1), suggesting that LysM genes in different kingdoms have
undergone distinct evolution and diversification, presumably reflecting functional selection. Recently, Onaga and
Taira (2008) reported the isolation of one LysM protein
(PrChiA) from the fern plant, Pteris ryukyuensis, consisting of 2 LysM motifs and a glycol_hydro_18 domain [26].
However, our analysis finds this specific protein architecture is limited to the fungal kingdom. The 2 LysM motifs
of this protein are 95% identical to each other, in contrast
to the fact that 2 LysM motifs in a given plant LysM protein are usually different from each other. Moreover,

majority-ruled parsimony topology based on LysM motif
sequences (about 42 aa in length) clearly shows that the 2
LysM motif sequences of PrChiA are separated from plant
LysM motif sequences and lie in the same clade with fungal LysM motif sequences (see Additional file 2). It is not
uncommon to isolate fungal genes from RNA preparations derived from plants and, therefore, further study of
the origin of this proposed fern gene is warranted. This
case exemplifies the value of domain architecture and
phylogenetic studies as an aid to predict gene function
and distribution.
Although LysM proteins presumably bind oligomers of Nacetyl glucosamine (e.g., chitin) and peptidoglycan, it is
not surprising to find the LysM motif associated with
other carbohydrate-binding modules given the fact that a
complex array of carbohydrates exists in nature. These carbohydrate-binding modules include the B_lectin domain
chitinhttp://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=PF01453,
binding domain in chitinases, and WSC (cell-wall integrity and stress response component) domain [27]http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=PF01822). The presence of
these domains with the LysM domain is consistent with
the pattern that these proteins are involved in binding
polysaccharides, including those of complex structure.
Physcomitrella, a bryophyte and arguably the most primitive plant whose genome has been sequenced, possesses a
few plant-specific LysM architectures. The LYK genes, one

example, are consistent with the recent report of a number
of receptor-like kinases in liverworts [28]. Proteins with a
LysM domain and predicted F-box domain are highly conserved in plant kingdom and may play a role in regulating
the stability of yet unknown protein substrates. It is interesting to speculate that these are glycoproteins recognized
by the LysM domain. Interestingly, this domain arrangement is also present in the Chlamydomonas genome, the
green algae that diverged from land plants over 1 billion
years ago. This indicates that the role for these proteins,
presumably in glycoprotein degradation, can be traced
back in Chlamydomonas and other primitive species as
well. This notion is supported by the fact that green algae
and moss genomes contain ubiquitin-proteasome elements, such as ubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating genes,
and other F-box genes (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Chlre3/
Chlre3.home.html; http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Phypa1_1/
Phypa1_1.home.html).
A few architectures that are present exclusively in primitive plants were progressively and apparently permanently
lost during angiosperm evolution (the lack of fern and
gymnosperm genome sequences precludes us from examining this trend in these lineages). Among these lost architectures, two of them, peptidase+LysM and C2+LysM, are
also present in the genome of Chlamydomonas, suggesting
the existence of common ancestors for these LysM proteins in nature. These LysM proteins appeared to have
been lost during the change from the unicellular, aquatic
life style to a terrestrial, vascular life style. However, the
nature of the peptidase domain in Chlamydomonas
(peptidase_C1) is different from that in Physcomitrella
(peptidase_M23). Actually, LysM+peptidase_M23 proteins are present in cyanobacteria (data not shown) and,
therefore may have been introduced into primitive plants
by horizontal gene transfer.
LysM gene evolution and plant genome duplications
Only one copy of F-box+LysM genes was retained in most
plant genomes after many rounds of polyploidy events.
Similarly, the copy numbers of LysMn and LYP genes
remain roughly the same across different plant genomes.
These suggest that increased gene copy number may have
deleterious effects and the dosage of these genes is under
tight regulation. In contrast, the LYK gene family underwent several successive rounds of expansion, especially in
flowering plants. Indeed, the expansion of the LYK gene
family can be found in primitive plant lineages; that is,
from the 2 LYK genes in Physcomitrella (bryophytes) to 5
LYK genes in the Selaginella (lycophytes) genome (Figure
1). This pattern of differential expansion of LysM genes is
probably due to the different rates of gene duplications of
individual LysM gene families in plants. However, it is
more likely that this is due to the different rates of gene
retention following gene duplications. For example, LYK
genes, compared to other LysM gene families, appear to
Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:183

have been retained more frequently following gene duplications.
The phylogenies of LysM genes, especially LYK genes,
reveal several rounds of gene duplication, consistent with
whole genome duplications (Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5). The
timing of these duplications can be estimated by the accumulation of synonymous to non-synonymous changes in
the sequences. Pairwise synonymous distance shows that
the LYK subclades VIA and VIB likely resulted from the
large-scale gene duplication shared by legume plants estimated at 54 mya [19,23,25]. Genome duplications
around the time window of 50 mya were also reported in
other flowering plants including grasses and Solanaceae
plants [23]. Pairwise synonymous estimates suggest that
the splits between the LYK subclades IA and IB and
between IIA and IIB may also be the outcome of the same
round of large-scale duplication estimated at 300 mya
(Figure 7). The Arabidopsis genome appears to have
undergone ancient genome duplications around this time
window [21,22]. Moreover, our data suggest that this
genome wide duplication is shared in flowering plants
and may have pre-dated the divergence of gymnosperm
and angiosperm plants ~300 mya [29].
A few LYK subclades are tandemly arrayed in plant
genomes (Figure 2). These arrangements could arise from
either a local tandem duplication or a genome doubling
followed by local rearrangement. The split of subclades IA
and IIA was estimated at 300 mya, probably upon or
shortly after the divergence of gymnosperm and
angiosperm plants [29]. However, the tandem array pattern is observed only in Rosid plants (Figure 2). This pattern may be conserved in dicot plants but, lacking the data
from Asterids and Caryophyllids, a firm conclusion is not
possible. The fact that the gene duplication likely occurred
earlier than the emergence of eudicot plants favors the
hypothesis that the common ancestors of the subclades IA
and IIA resulted from a genome duplication with their
current tandemly arrayed positions arising later due to
local rearrangement, The data do not support a conclusion that the common ancestors of subclades IA and IIA
resulted from local tandem duplication and were de-associated in monocots and re-associated again in dicots. In
contrast, the data do suggest that the tandemly arrayed
VIA and VIB resulted from a recent large-scale duplication
estimated at 54 mya.
Functional characterization of LysM genes
The LysM domain was first described in bacterial enzymes
whose role is to degrade the peptidoglycan cell wall [6,7].
In this case, the LysM domain anchors these enzymes to
the peptidoglycan, a polymer structurally similar to chitin.
Hence, the discovery of the LysM domain in proteins
genetically identified as the receptor for the bacterial chitooligosaccharide nodulation factor immediately sug-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/183

gested that the LysM domain mediated interaction with
the oligosaccharide [9-13]. Such a role is also consistent
with the finding of the LysM domain in LYKs or LYPs
implicated in the recognition of chitin, a well known fungal PAMP, which elicits the plant innate immunity
response [8]; [9,10]. These data clearly suggest a similar
oligosaccharide binding role for the LysM domains found
in other LysM protein families. Recently, peptidoglycan
was shown to trigger typical PAMP-elicited immune
responses in plants [2], while chitin was identified as a
PAMP active on animal cells [30,31]. It is very likely that
LysM domain containing receptors are involved in mediating these responses.
Uniformity of LysM gene nomenclature
A total of 201 LysM genes were identified from 10 plant
species in this study. Considering that LysM genes are
ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, one could imagine that
innumerable LysM genes exist in plants. Naming these
genes could be a great challenge. Indeed, there are already
a diversity of names given to various LysM genes [811,13,32] and this creates confusion within the research
community. In order to reduce this confusion, we incorporated all reported names of LysM genes in the phylogeny (Figure 2 and 3). Previously, we proposed a uniform
nomenclature for all LysM domain containing proteins
[2] and we used this same nomenclature in this study.
This nomenclature system reflects subcellular localizations, phylogenetic relationships, and biological functions. We recommend adoption of this nomenclature as a
way to reduce confusion in anticipation of an increasing
interest in this important group of plant proteins.

Conclusion
We report a domain architecture catalogue of LysM proteins across all kingdoms and describe a comparative and
evolutionary genomics study of LysM genes in the plant
kingdom. Our data show that LysM-containing proteins
display a wide range of domain architectures. Each individual kingdom appears to have evolved a distinct array of
domain architectures, suggesting the presence of distinctive evolutionary paths in individual kingdoms. We show
that early plant lineages acquired four characteristic
domain architectures and progressively lost several primitive domain architectures. Apparently, LYK gene family
underwent intensive expansion, while the dosages of
other types of plant LysM genes roughly stay the same
throughout the entire plant kingdom. One of the two
groups of tandemly arrayed plant LYK genes likely
resulted from an ancient genome duplication followed by
local genomic rearrangement, while the origin of the
other groups of tandemly arrayed LYK genes remains
obscure. We defined the orthologous and paralogous relationships of plant LysM genes based on sequence alignment, phylogenetic topology, microsynteny, and
nucleotide substitution levels. We also identified 16 pairs

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:183

of putative homeologous genes in soybean. This study
will provide clues to functional characterization of plant
LysM genes and be informative to functional studies of
animal LysM genes.

Chlre3.home.html). The final LysM proteins sequences,
CDS sequences, LysM positions, gene and intron structures, and other predicted features were compiled into the
Additional file 3.
LysM domain architectures
The LysM domain architectures were extracted from the
Pfam
database
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/fam
ily?acc=PF01476. For architectures in the prokaryotic,
fungal and animal kingdoms, only those identified in
more than 5 sequences were kept to draw the diagram of
LysM domain architectures (Figure 1). The domain structures of all plant LysM proteins were analyzed with Pfam
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ and inter-ProScan http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/. Signal peptides and
transmembrane domains were predicted using SignalP
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ with both Neutral Network and Hidden Markov Models and TMHMM
respechttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/,
tively.
Alignment, phylogeny, and synonymous distance
Protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE3.6 [33]
with a fasta output format and manually edited using
Jalview [34]. Majority-ruled parsimonious trees were generated using the program protpars of PHYLIP [35] with
maximum likelihood branch lengths calculated using
TREE-PUZZLE [36]. Bootstrap values were calculated
using the program seqboot of the PHYLIP package. All

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/183

trees were viewed and printed into a pdf format using A
Tree Viewer [37]. For calculation of synonymous distance,
codon-aligned nucleic acid sequences were created using
RevTrans 1.4 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/RevTrans/.
Synonymous nucleotide substitutions per site were calculated using the program yn00 of the PAML package [38].
The histograms of calculated Ks values were plotted and
descriptive statistics were displayed using the Minitab
15.0.
Microsynteny analyses
Genomic sequences surrounding selected LYP and LysMn
genes, about 1–2 Mb in length, were extracted from the
above databases. These stretches of genomic sequences
were annotated using a dicot species model and Arabidopsis matrix of FGENESH for dicot plants and a monocot species model and rice matrix for rice. The annotated
protein sequences were compiled together into a peptide
sequence database using the BLAST program. Repetitive
sequences were excluded from the databases. BLASTp was
used to compare protein identity and similarity against
the database with an E-value cutoff of 1e-20 and a percent
identify cutoff of 35% between species and 40% within
the same species. The gene and intron symbols were
drawn using GenePicPipe Synteny Grapher http://
www.medicago.org/genome/rpg1/. The microsynteny
maps were finally drawn in Adobe Illustrator 10.0.

Additional file 2
The LysM motifs of Pteris ryukyuensis chitinase A (PrChiA) are associated with fungal LysM motifs. A majority-ruled parsimony tree with
maximum-likelihood branch lengths was calculated using selected plant
LysM motif sequences and fungal LysM motifs in glycol_hydro_18 proteins. Bootstrap values of 1000 independent trees larger than 40 were
labeled on each branch. The fungal sequences were extracted from the
Pfam database.
