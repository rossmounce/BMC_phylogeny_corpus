Abstract
Background: The phylogeography of the Y chromosome in Asia previously suggested that
modern humans of African origin initially settled in mainland southern East Asia, and about 25,000–
30,000 years ago, migrated northward, spreading throughout East Asia. However, the fragmented
distribution of one East Asian specific Y chromosome lineage (D-M174), which is found at high
frequencies only in Tibet, Japan and the Andaman Islands, is inconsistent with this scenario.
Results: In this study, we collected more than 5,000 male samples from 73 East Asian populations
and reconstructed the phylogeography of the D-M174 lineage. Our results suggest that D-M174
represents an extremely ancient lineage of modern humans in East Asia, and a deep divergence was
observed between northern and southern populations.
Conclusion: We proposed that D-M174 has a southern origin and its northward expansion
occurred about 60,000 years ago, predating the northward migration of other major East Asian
lineages. The Neolithic expansion of Han culture and the last glacial maximum are likely the key
factors leading to the current relic distribution of D-M174 in East Asia. The Tibetan and Japanese
populations are the admixture of two ancient populations represented by two major East Asian
specific Y chromosome lineages, the O and D haplogroups.

Introduction
The Y chromosome Alu polymorphism (YAP, also called
M1) defines the deep-rooted haplogroup D/E of the global Y-chromosome phylogeny [1]. This D/E haplogroup is

further branched into three sub-haplogroups DE*, D and
E (Figure 1). The distribution of the D/E haplogroup is
highly regional, and the three subgroups are geographically restricted to certain areas, therefore informative in

tracing human prehistory (Table 1). The sub-haplogroup
DE*, presumably the most ancient lineage of the D/E haplogroup was only found in Africans from Nigeria [2], supporting the "Out of Africa" hypothesis about modern
human origin. The sub-haplogroup E (E-M40), defined by
M40/SRY4064 and M96, was also suggested originated in
Africa [3-6], and later dispersed to Middle East and Europe
about 20,000 years ago [3,4]. Interestingly, the sub-haplogroup D defined by M174 (D-M174) is East Asian specific
with abundant appearance in Tibetan and Japanese (30–
40%), but rare in most of other East Asian populations

and populations from regions bordering East Asia (Central Asia, North Asia and Middle East) (usually less than
5%) [5-7]. Under D-M174, Japanese belongs to a separate
sub-lineage defined by several mutations (e.g. M55, M57
and M64 etc.), which is different from those in Tibetans
implicating relatively deep divergence between them [1].
The fragmented distribution of D-M174 in East Asia
seems not consistent with the pattern of other East Asian
specific lineages, i.e. O3-M122, O1-M119 and O2-M95
under haplogroup O [8,9].

Note: the frequency data of YAP+ was from published studies [4-7,9-11,13,14,16-18,23,27-29,43-50].

Besides Tibetans and Japanese, D-M174 is also prevalent
in several southern ethnic populations in East Asia,
including the Tibeto-Burman speaking populations from
Yunnan province of southwestern China (14.0–72.3%),
one Hmong-Mien population from Guangxi of southern
China (30%) and one Daic population from Thailand
(10%), which could be explained by fairly recent population admixture [9-11]. However, a recent study reported a
high frequency of D-M174 in Andamanese (56.25%),
people who live in the remote islands in the Indian Ocean
and considered one of the earliest modern human settlers
of African origin in Southeast Asia [12]. Another study by
Underhill et al. suggested that the D-M174 lineage likely
reached East Asia about 50,000 years ago [5]. This implies
that the YAP lineage in East Asia could be indeed very
ancient.
Our previous studies showed that the dominant and East
Asian specific Y haplogroup O-M175 (44.3% on average)
reflected possibly the earliest modern human expansion
in East Asia [8,9,13]. Unlike the prevalence of O-M175 in
most of the East Asian populations, populations with relatively high frequencies of D-M174 are mostly located at
the peripheral regions of mainland East Asia with fragmented distribution [7,9-11,13-18], implying two possible explanations of human prehistory. Firstly, like OM175, D-M174 may also be just one of the lineages going
northward during the suggested Paleolithic migration of
modern humans in East Asia [8,9]. Subsequently, due to
population substructure (the last glacial is likely a key factor) and recent expansion of Han culture [18], the distribution of D-M174 was fragmented into the current
geographic pattern. The other possible scenario would

suggest an independent earlier migration different from
the one we proposed previously [8,9]. To address this
question, we conducted a systematic sampling and genetic
analysis of more than 5,000 male individuals from 73 East
Asian and Southeast Asian populations. Based on the Y
chromosome SNP and STR data and the estimated ages of
the major D-M174 lineages, we proposed that there was
an independent Paleolithic northward migration of modern humans in East Asia, predating the previously suggested northward population movement [8,9,13,19-21].

Methods
Samples
In this study, a total of 5,134 unrelated male samples were
collected from 73 populations, covering the major geographic regions in East Asia and Southeast Asia (Table 2
and Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2, most populations
were sampled from southern and southwestern China
where about 80% Chinese ethnic populations live with
inhabited histories longer than 3,000 years [22]. Samples
from previous studies were also included, including 91
YAP+ samples (16 Japanese, 54 Tibetans, 3 Koreans, 1
Guam, 1 Cambodian, 4 Thais and 12 samples of China)
from Su et al. [7,9,17] and 116 YAP+ samples (35 Africans,
13 Caucasians, 9 Indians, 26 Middle East and 33 Central
Asians) from Wells et al. [23](Table 2).
Y Chromosome Markers and Genotyping
Initially all the samples were genotyped for three Y chromosome specific biallelic markers, including M1, M40
and M174. The samples belonging to sub-haplogroup D
(D-M174) were subject to further typing of M15, M57 and
p47 in order to designate the sub-clades. The sub-haplo-

We typed the YAP locus in the 5,134 samples, of which
512 YAP+ were detected (9.97%), plus the previously
published 207 Yap+ samples, and a total 719 Yap+ samples were then typed for the five biallelic markers (M174,
M40, M15, M57 and p47) and eight STRs (DYS19/394,
DYS388, DYS 389I, DYS389II, DYS 390, DYS 391, DYS
392 and DYS 393). Among the 719 YAP+, a total of 697
samples generated complete sets of allele counts for all the
SNPs and STRs (data in the Additional files).
Data Analysis
For data analysis, we included the YAP+ samples from the
published data on 90 Japanese and 44 Tibetans from
Hammer et al. (2006), 19 Andamanese from Thangaraj et
al. (2003) and 6 Nigerians from Weale et al. (2003). The
divergence times between the sub-clades of D-M174 were
estimated using the STR data following the SNP-STR coalescence method [4,24,25]. The average mutation rate of
the Y-STRs tested is 0.00069 [26]. The network of the YSTR haplotypes were constructed for each D-M174 subhaplogroup using NETWORK4.2.0.1 http://www.fluxusengineering.com, and then superimposed onto the established phylogeny of the D-M174 lineage (Figure 1). The
average gene diversity of the populations was calculated
with the use of the allele frequencies of the eight tested
STR loci (Arlequin 3.0, http://lgb.unige.ch/arlequin/).

Results
Table 1 lists the reported YAP+ frequencies in worldwide
populations (refer to table note for references). Africans
have the highest frequency of YAP+, and all of them
belong to the sub-haplogroup E-M40. In contrast, DM174 is in general East Asian specific with sporadic occurrence in adjacent regions, i.e. Central Asia, Middle East
and Northeast India. The average frequency of D-M174 in
East Asians is 9.60% with high frequencies in Tibet
(41.31%), Japan (35.08%) and Andaman Island
(56.25%), but rare in other East Asian populations (<
5%). After genotyping the Y chromosome biallelic markers (M174, M40, M15, M57 and p47), the 719 Yap+ samples were assigned to 6 sub-haplogroups, i.e. DE*, E-M40,
D*-M174, D1-M15, D2-M57 and D3-p47 (Figure 1). Further typing for eight STR loci of the 719 YAP+ generated
the complete STR data sets for 697 samples. As shown in
Table 2, consistent with previous reports [7,9-11,13,16],
the prevalence of D-M174 is mostly in western and southern China and Japan.
The distribution patterns of the four D-M174 sub-lineages
(sub-haplogroups) (Figure 1) are different from each
other. D1-M15 is widely distributed across East Asia
including most of the Tibeto-Burman and Daic speaking
populations (Table 2). D*-M174 and D3-p47 are mainly
distributed in Tibeto-Burman populations with sporadic
occurrence in the Daic populations. In surprise, we
observed two DE* in the Tibetan samples, which was pre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/45

viously only observed in Africa (Nigerians), but not in
other world populations. In contrast, D2-M57 only
occurred in Japanese, an implication of the early divergence of this lineage from other D-M174 sub-haplogroups
(Table 2). We identified four E-M40 individuals in the
northwestern Han populations, a reflection of recent gene
flow from Central Asia [23].
To reveal the detailed structure of the D-M174 lineage in
East Asian populations, we conducted the network analysis combining the SNP and STR haplotype data (Figure 3).
D*-M174 has a deep structure with no loops in the network. The D*-M174 lineage contains distinct STR haplotypes of Tibeto-Burman (mostly Tibetan), Daic and
Andamanese respectively, and no haplotype sharing (i.e.
shared by individuals from different geographic/linguistic
populations) was observed, implying that D*-M174 is an
ancient lineage. As the most common lineage, the network of D1-M15 is also deep-structured and a clear south
vs. north divergence can be inferred though sporadic haplotype sharing exists. In contrast, D2-M57 is restricted to
Japan and D3-p47 is prevalent in Tibet and its adjacent
regions with sporadic appearance in Central Asian and
Daic populations. The short-distanced and star-like network structure of these two sub-haplogroups indicates a
long-term local existence and population expansion of
the D-M174 lineage in these two geographically far away
regions. The non-Tibetan Tibeto-Burman populations,
e.g. Naxi, Pumi and Qiang only have a subset of the
Tibetan haplotypes, again indicating a recent gene flow
from Tibet as recorded in the literature [7,22].
We next sought to estimate the age of the D-M174 sub-lineages. The coalescence analysis shows that the age of D*M174, D3-p47 and D1-M15 are the oldest (66,392 ±
1,466, 52,103 ± 1,327 and 51,640 ± 2,563 years). The age
of the Japanese specific lineage D2-M57 is the youngest
(37,678 ± 2,216 years) (Table 3). Notably, these estimated ages are much older than that of O3-M122, the
other East Asian specific haplogroup we reported before
(25,000–30,000 years) [8].

Discussion
The biased distribution of D-M174 bears the different
possible inferences of the human population prehistory
in view of the origin and migratory pattern in East Asia.
The hypothesis of northern origin of D-M174 is not supported by our data because D-M174 is rare in Central
Asian populations (Table 1) and the few Central Asian DM174s are all located at the peripheral positions of the YSTR network (Figure 3). Our data also disapproves the
notion of Indian origin since no D-M174 was detected in
the 996 individuals across India. The sporadic occurrence
of D-M174 in northeastern Indians (two D-M174s in 232
individuals tested) is because those populations are in fact
Sino-Tibetan speaking populations (Table 1). The lack of
Page 6 of 10

BMC Biology 2008, 6:45

gene flow between Tibet and India is likely due to the efficient geographic separation by the Himalayas [27].
On the other hand, the aborigines living on Andaman
Island are genetically isolated in view of their Y chromosome haplotypes. Though phenotypically different from
other Southeast Asian populations, the Andaman Islanders posses most of the major East Asian specific Y chromosome lineages including D-M174, O3-M122 and O2M95, a strong indication of a relic Paleolithic population
[28]. Also, the Daic and Hmong-Mien speaking populations are ancient southern populations in view of linguis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/45

tic and archaeological evidences [22]. The network
analysis indicates a clear divergence of D1-M15 between
northern (Tibeto-Burman) and southern (Daic and
Hmong) populations (Figure 3). Hence, the alternative
explanation of northern origin of D-M174 is unlikely considering the absence of YAP+ in North Asia [29] and the
sporadic appearance of D-M174 in Central Asia [23].
Consequently, the southern origin of D-M174 can be
established, which is consistent with the proposed initial
settlement of modern humans in mainland Southeast
Asia and the migration pattern of other Y chromosome
lineages [8,9,13].

There were studies arguing against the southern origin of
East Asian, in which higher gene diversity was observed in
northern populations compared with southern populations [14,30]. As we discussed in our previous report, the
data from Karafet et al. [14] suggested a false impression
of the high diversity of northern populations without taking the recent admixture from Central Asia into consideration [8]. The study of Xue et al. [30] has the similar
drawback though both Y-SNP and Y-STR data were used.
In Xue et al (2006), the high gene diversity was claimed for
Mongolian, Uygure and Manchurian, and all of them
have recorded recent extensive admixture with Central
Asian and Han Chinese populations [22]. In addition, the
southern populations studied in Xue et al. (2006) were
limited and the within population bottleneck effect
caused by long-time geographic isolation might have a
great impact on gene diversity estimation. When plenty
southern populations were studied, we observed a higher
diversity in those populations compared with the northern populations [8,9].
The gene diversity based on the STR data in the southern
populations is comparable with those in the northern
populations. Tibetan has the highest diversity (0.525 ±
0.294), followed by Daic (0.484 ± 0.272), Japanese
(0.419 ± 0.239) and Hmong Mien (0.347 ± 0.206). Gene
diversity of other East Asian populations was not calculated due to small sample size. The higher diversity in
Tibetan is largely due to the much larger effective population size of D-M174 in Tibetan compared with other populations. Tibetan and Japanese lived in two geographically
far away regions and their D-M174 lineages belong to two
different sub-haplogroups. These two sub-haplogroups all
have a short-distanced and star-like network structure,
which indicates a long-term local existence and recent
population expansion (Figure 3). It should be noted that
the estimation of gene diversity is subject to potential
bias, e.g. the age difference of the D-M174 sub-lineages.
The finding of two DE* in Tibet, which was only observed
in Africa, supports the antiquity of D-M174 and suggests
that the D-M174 lineage is among the earliest modern
human settlers in East Asia. Additionally, the biased distri-

bution of D-M174 and its ancient coalescent time suggests
an independent Paleolithic migration of modern humans
in East Asia.
Our previous data on the O3-M122 lineage suggested a
prehistorically northward migration (about 25,000–
30,000 years ago) of modern humans in East Asia, which
explains the current phylogeography of the major East
Asian specific Y chromosome lineages (O3-M122, O2M95 and O1-M119) [8,9,13]. However, the data on DM174 cannot be explained by the hypothesized migration
pattern. Firstly, D-M174 is rare in the central part of eastern Asia, especially in Han Chinese populations. Though
this could be explained by genetic drift, assuming DM174 moving along with O3-M122 during the proposed
northward migration, the prevalence of D-M174 in Tibet
and Japan requires recurrent mutations or independent
random enrichment of D-M174, which is unlikely. An
independent earlier northward migration is more reasonable in explaining the current distribution of D-M174 in
East Asia. We speculate that due to the later northward
migration of O3-M122 and the Neolithic expansion of
Han Chinese, the trace of the D-M174 migration in the
heartland of East Asia was wiped out by the later and
likely much larger migration of O3-M122. The current
peripheral distribution pattern of D-M174 in East Asia is
consistent with the proposed notion. Also, the age estimation supports that the northward migration of D-M174
may predate the migration of O3-M122.
The East African megadroughts (about 135–75 thousand
years ago) during the early late-Pleistocene was suggested
compelling modern humans out of Africa [31]. And the
early modern human could occupy coastal areas and
exploited the near-shore marine food resource by that
time [32]. Then, modern humans was suggested expanding along the tropical coast, and the earliest modern
human fossil found out of Africa was about 100,000 years
ago [33]. The period of 80,000–10,000 years ago during
the last glacial might have a huge impact on modern
human migration, and the sea level had fallen 50–200
meters below present [34], which resulted in larger dry

lands and possibility for human migration between currently separated lands by ocean, e.g. between Japan and
the mainland.
Human fossil records and previous genetic data suggested
that the earliest modern human settlement in East Asia
likely occurred less than 60,000 years ago [8,9,13,21,35].
For example, the oldest Australian fossil (Lake Mungo 3)
was dated about 45,000 ± 3,000 – 62,000 ± 6,000 years
ago [36,37], and the mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome analysis of current Australian ethnic populations
suggested the colonization of Australia about 50,000–
70,000 years ago [38]. Our age estimation of the D-M174
lineages is consistent with this notion though there might
be independent migrations of modern humans into East
Asia and into Australia [38].
The estimated ages of the D-M174 lineages are older than
those previously reported based on both Y chromosome
and mtDNA variations in East Asia [8,9,21]. To see
whether it is over-estimated, using the same method, we
calculated the divergence time between DE* and E-M40.
The estimated age is 27,176 years, which is much younger
than the D-M174 lineage, but consistent with the previous
estimation (27,800–37,000 years ago) [3]. Hence, the
antiquity of D-M174 likely reflects the true prehistory of
human populations in East Asia. The age estimation
model developed by Zhivotovsky (2001) is not sensitive
to effective population size and recent population expansion though the effect of population substructure cannot
be totally ruled out. The antiquity of D-M174 was also
supported by a previous study in which the origin of DM174 was estimated more than 50,000 years ago [5].
The divergence time of haplogroup D is about 60,000
years ago, considering the wide though fragmented geographic distribution of D-M174, the proposed Paleolithic
migration would be the first northward population movement of modern humans after their initial settlement in
southern East Asia. As the last glacial occurred during
80,000–10,000 years ago, the northward migration of DM174 is consistent with the proposed notion that modern
humans might exploit the food of "Mammoth Steppe"
[39]. Besides the later population expansion, the cold
weather during the last glacial may also contribute to the
current fragmented distribution of D-M174. Interestingly,
a recent archaeological finding supported that modern
humans explored the Tibetan plateau about 30,000–
40,000 years ago, which is much earlier than previously
suggested [40], but consistent with our hypothesis. The
after-glacial sea level rise eventually led to the separation
between Japan and the main continent, which explains
the relic distribution of D-M174 in current Japanese populations. The archaeological data suggested that the initial
colonization of modern humans in Japan occurred about

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/45

30,000 years ago [41,42], consistent with our age estimation of D2-M57 (37,678 ± 2,216 years ago). Taken
together, the current Tibetan and Japanese populations
are probably the admixture of two ancient populations
represented by D-M174 and O3-M122 respectively
[7,10,16].

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated an ancient Paleolithic population migration in East Asia, predating the previously
suggested northward population movement. The current
fragmented distribution of D-M174 is likely due to the
combination of later Neolithic population expansion and
the last glacial.
