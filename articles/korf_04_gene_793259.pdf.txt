Abstract
Background: Computational gene prediction continues to be an important problem, especially
for genomes with little experimental data.
Results: I introduce the SNAP gene finder which has been designed to be easily adaptable to a
variety of genomes. In novel genomes without an appropriate gene finder, I demonstrate that
employing a foreign gene finder can produce highly inaccurate results, and that the most compatible
parameters may not come from the nearest phylogenetic neighbor. I find that foreign gene finders
are more usefully employed to bootstrap parameter estimation and that the resulting parameters
can be highly accurate.
Conclusion: Since gene prediction is sensitive to species-specific parameters, every genome needs
a dedicated gene finder.

Background
Complete genomic sequences are becoming more and
more abundant. Given a new genome, one of the first and
most important tasks is determining the structure of its
protein-coding genes. Ab initio gene prediction plays a critical role because it produces gene structures quickly, inexpensively, and in some cases reliably. The accuracy of a
gene finder depends on many factors. Chief among these
is proper training. Training a gene finder can be a laborious task. In the past, genome projects moved rather
slowly, and the trickle of data meant that parameters
could be estimated before the genome was complete.
Today, sequencing and assembly are so rapid that
genomes can appear well in advance of proper training
material. This leaves some new genome annotation
projects without an appropriate gene finder.
When new genomic sequence emerges, it must be annotated with something, and frequently this is a gene finder
for a completely different genome. A particularly good

example of this is Genscan [1], which was trained primarily for the human genome, but has been used to annotate
genes in worms, flies, fish, fungi, amphioxus, and others
[2-6]. Since sequence features such as codon bias [7] and
splicing signals [8] vary from organism to organism, it is
expected that gene finders may not perform optimally in
a foreign genome. While the practice of annotating a
genome with a foreign gene finder is commonplace, its
consequences are not widely understood.
In this paper, I introduce a new ab initio gene finding program called SNAP. SNAP is similar to Genscan and other
generalized hidden Markov model (HMM) gene finders
[9-13], but unlike many, it is easily adaptable to a number
of organisms and its source code is freely available. I train
and evaluate SNAP in the Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress),
Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Drosophila melanogaster
(fruit fly), and Oryza sativa (rice) genomes, and demonstrate that SNAP is an accurate ab initio gene finder. For
newly sequenced genomes without a specific gene finder,

I show that annotating with a foreign gene finder may be
highly inaccurate and I introduce a bootstrapping procedure that allows one to estimate species-specific parameters de novo.

Results and discussion
SNAP is a high-performance ab initio gene finder
I trained and evaluated SNAP in four genomes (see Methods) and compared its performance to Genscan in all
genomes, to HMMGene [12] and Genefinder [14] in C.
elegans, and to Augustus [15] in D. melanogaster. Genscan performs as well as recent gene finders designed specifically for Arabidopsis [16], was considered one of the
standards for the Drosophila GASP experiments [3], and
is one of the gene finders used by the International Rice
Genome Sequencing Project [17]. HMMGene and Genefinder are well-established gene prediction programs for
C. elegans. Augustus is one of the latest gene prediction
programs and has been shown to outperform Genscan,
GENIE, and GENEID in Drosophila.

As shown in table 2, SNAP is more accurate than Genscan
in every genome. In C. elegans, SNAP performs better than
HMMGene and almost as well as Genefinder. In D. melanogaster, SNAP is similar to Augustus. The HMMs

employed by SNAP in this study have a minimal genome
model without a promoter, poly-A signal, or UTRs, and
the reason why SNAP outperforms Genscan is simply that
it is trained for each genome. When compared to gene
finders tuned for a particular genome, SNAP performs
about equally. It may be possible to increase the accuracy
of SNAP by including more states in the HMM to model
additional genomic features or by using more sophisticated statistical techniques such as interpolated Markov
models, maximum dependence decomposition trees or
isochore segmentation. Fine-tuning SNAP to particular
genomes is not the subject of this study however.
Gene prediction in novel genomes can be highly inaccurate
A newly sequenced genome may not have much training
material and little experimental data to anchor gene predictions. How can one find genes in such uncharted territory? The common procedure is to use a gene finder from
some other genome, perhaps the one that is most phylogenetically similar. To determine the consequences of this
practice I evaluated the difference between the intra- and
inter-species performance of SNAP. The results are displayed in table 3.

Gene prediction accuracy with foreign parameters appears
to follow GC content more than phylogenetic relationships. For example, Oryza parameters perform reasonably
well in Drosophila sequence (>25% genes correct) but very
poorly in A. thaliana (5% genes correct). Similarly, for
finding C. elegans genes, one is better off with parameters
from A. thaliana than D. melanogaster. Choosing the best
foreign gene finder is therefore not simply a matter of
using parameters from the closest relative.

Caenorhabditis these are almost invariant. At -4, the plants
prefer G while Caenorhabditis prefers T and Drosophila is
unbiased. The splice donor sites appear to be similar
among all the genomes. However, there may be speciesspecific higher-order contexts that contribute to some specificity since the tuned architectures (see Methods) are
slightly different for each genome. The translation start
site appears to have some genome specificity. Given the
compositional differences in the various signals, it is not
surprising that gene prediction with foreign gene finders
can be highly inaccurate.

Genomes have significant compositional differences
To look more closely at the reasons behind the inaccuracy
of foreign parameters, I have examined compositional differences in coding sequence, splice sites, and the translation start. Figure 2 displays the codon frequencies of
degenerate codons for each of the four genomes. In general, codon preference is reflected by GC composition.
That is, the GC-rich genomes prefer G and C in the 3rd
position and the AT-rich genomes prefer A or T. This helps
to explain the results of the previous experiment. But even
between genomes with similar GC-content there are significant differences among equivalent codons. For example, Oryza prefers CTC for Leucine while Drosophila prefers
CTG.

Parameter estimation in novel genomes
Even though foreign gene finders may perform sub-optimally, their predictions may display compositional properties of the novel genome. For example, when annotating
the A. thaliana genome with a C. elegans gene finder, the
predictions appeared very much like real A. thaliana genes.
Figure 3d shows a splice acceptor pictogram derived from
these predictions. Note that the sequence composition
broadly resembles true A. thaliana splice acceptors, including a preference for G at -3 and a T-rich upstream
sequence. It also retains some C. elegans qualities such as
a greater proportion of Ts at -5 and -6.

Pictograms [18] for splice sites and the translation start are
shown in figure 3. The two plant genomes (Arabidopsis
and Oryza) have very similar acceptor sites, but the two
animal genomes (Caenorhabditis and Drosophila) each
have unique features. The upstream region from -7 to -27,
frequently known as the poly-pyrimidine tract is T-rich in
plants, AT-rich in Caenorhabditis, and pyrimidine-rich
(proximally) in Drosophila. T is the most common nucleotide at positions at -5 and -6 in all genomes, but in

If predicted genes have compositional properties similar
to real genes, it should be possible to train a gene finder
for a novel genome in the absence of any data. One simply
runs a foreign gene finder (or more than one) to create a
virtual training set and estimates parameters for the novel
genome from the virtual data. So rather than use foreign
gene finders to identify genes, one uses them to bootstrap
parameter estimation. To determine if this procedure
works, I assumed one of the genomes was novel and evalPage 3 of 9

uated the gene prediction accuracy of bootstrapped
parameters derived from one, two, or three foreign gene
finders. The results are displayed in table 4.
Bootstrapped parameters work very well in many cases. In
A. thaliana, the best foreign parameters come from C. elegans. But if the gene predictions are used for training
rather than the final annotation, the prediction accuracy
rises from 86.3/91.0 (nucleotide sensitivity/nucleotide
specificity) to 96.6/93.2. The worst foreign performance
(D. melanogaster parameters) changes from an abysmal
26.0/96.0 to a respectable 75.2/95.5. Bootstrapped
parameters also appear to work very well in C. elegans and
D. melanogaster. In C. elegans, the highest performing sets,
96.7/91.1 and 95.8/91.9, come from mixing two or three
gene finders. In Drosophila, the best parameters are derived
from O. sativa predictions. In general, bootstrapped
parameters in these genomes can rival actual data, and
even the worst bootstrapped parameters are reasonably
accurate.

In O. sativa, bootstrapped parameters are only somewhat
helpful. The Arabidopsis and Caenorhabditis parameters
improve in both sensitivity and specificity, but the Drosophila foreign parameters are actually better than any of
the bootstrapped ones. The reason why O. sativa behaves
differently from the others is unclear at this time. In general, however, estimating parameters from gene predictions appears to be a simple and convenient way to train
a gene finder for a novel genome. It is important to note
that the genomes studied in this paper are all relatively
compact. The techniques here may not work well in mammalian genomes or other genomes where exons account
for a small fraction of the total sequence. I am currently
investigating methods to improve gene finding accuracy
and to quickly estimate gene prediction parameters in
large genomes.

Conclusions
In this paper, I demonstrated that SNAP is a high performance gene finding program in several genomes. For new
genomes without an appropriate gene finder, I showed

Methods
Data sets
Genomic data and annotation were retrieved from two
sources. The A. thaliana (Release 4.0) and O. sativa (OSA1)
data were downloaded from TIGR [19]. Data for C. elegans
(version 14.98.1) and D. melanogaster (version 14.3.1)
were downloaded from Ensembl [20] via the Ensmart
interface. Full-length mRNAs were retrieved using SRS
from the Sanger Institute [21] by using the keyword 'complete' in the Description field, selecting 'mrna' for Molecule,
and using the specific taxon in the Organism field.

The genomic sequence and annotation were subjected to
a battery of tests to select for complete genes with no obvious errors such as overlapping exons, exons out of
bounds, exons on the wrong strand, in-frame stop
codons, or introns <30 bp. In addition to these "sanity
checks", every gene was confirmed by an end-to-end, gapfree alignment between the in silico predicted transcript
and a full-length cDNA. This requirement ensures that
there are no extra/missed exons and that predicted splice
sites are consistent with the actual transcript. Genes with
unusual features such as non-canonical splice sites, internal stops, or split start/stop codons were removed. To simplify evaluation, genes with known alternate forms or
genes overlapping other genes have been removed. To
limit redundancy, all encoded proteins within a genome

were aligned to each other, and in cases where there was a
BLASTP [22,23] alignment of >90% identity, one of the
sequences was removed. The version of BLAST used was
2.0MP-WashU [10-Sep-2003] and the parameters were
the defaults plus -wordmask = seg + xnu. Bioperl [24]
libraries were used for processing BLAST reports. For the
A. thaliana set there were a large number of genes that
passed all criteria, so the final set was trimmed by random
selection to make it similar to the others.
The amount of sequence upstream and downstream of
each gene is variable; the distance is half way to the nearest annotated gene up to a maximum of 1 kb. The average
intergenic length in the four genomes is 2.9 kb, 2.7 kb, 6.6
kb, and 4.1 kb for Arabidopsis, Ceanorhabditis, Drosophila,
and Oryza. 1 kb was chosen because at longer lengths
some unannotated genes were clearly present (data not
shown). The GC content, proportion of single-exon genes,
and average exon and intron lengths are all similar to the
downloaded data for each genome (data not shown).
The gene sets used in this study are summarized in table
1. The Arabidopsis and Caenorhabditis genomes are very ATrich while the Drosophila and Oryza genomes have a more
balanced nucleotide composition. Some genomes have
unique features when compared to the others: Caenorhab-

ditis has very few single-exon genes, Drosophila has much
longer exons and introns, and Arabidopsis has the shortest
introns on average.
Gene model
SNAP models protein coding sequences in genomic DNA
via a specialized hidden Markov model similar to the one
used in Genscan [1]. There are a few key differences:

1. Genscan is described as having three intron states but
SNAP uses six to prevent stop codons at splice junctions
(Genscan does not predict genes with stop codons, but its
method to prevent stop codons is not described).
2. Genscan models both strands simultaneously while
SNAP treats each strand independently. Decoding the
strands independently allows genes on opposite strands
to overlap. The advantage this is that it allows genes
within introns of other genes, which is relatively common
in some genomes. The disadvantage is that it also allows
overlapping exons, which is not common.
3. The state diagram is fixed in Genscan but is read from a
parameter file in SNAP. This allows one to change the
HMM to describe a variety of genomic features. The sim-

plest state diagram for predicting single- and multi-exon
genes is shown in figure 1.
4. The sequence feature model architectures in Genscan
are fixed but SNAP allows one to employ any length
weight matrix and any order Markov model and to embed
these models within an array, decision tree, or 3-periodic
(coding sequence) framework.
5. Introns may have explicit length distributions over a
fixed distance followed by a geometric tail. Using explicit
lengths increases the computational load by an amount
that depends on the length of the explicit distribution and
on exon density. The total runtime is approximately 1.5
times as long for these genomes with a fixed distance of
250 bp.
Parameter estimation
In gene prediction algorithms it is common to employ
weight matrices (WM), weight array matrices (WAM), and
Markov models (MM) to model compositional features
such as the translation start site, splice sites and codon
bias [1]. The choice of architectures is partly limited by the
amount of data in the training set, but is ultimately
determined by what works best in practice. To find a useful combination of models I began with simple weight
matrices for the splice acceptor, splice donor, translation
start, and translation stop sites, and 4th order Markov
models for coding, intron, and intergenic sequence. I did
not include models for promoter, poly-A site, UTRs or
trans-splicing. These features are often not annotated and
I therefore used only the features which could be unambiguously defined in the training data.

The "default" models are as follows: the acceptor WM is
30 bp long with 3 exonic nucleotides, the donor WM is 9
bp with 3 exonic nucleotides, the start WM is 12 bp with
6 coding nucleotides, and the stop WM is 9 bp with 3 bp
on either side of the stop codons. The WMs (except the
stop which is not shown) are therefore accurately represented by the pictograms in figure 3. These default architectures were used in the gene prediction experiments
corresponding to table 4. For the experiments corresponding to tables 2 and 3, the architectures were tuned to find
those that work best in each organism. The number of
possible combinations of architectures is very large and
was not fully explored. Tuned architectures differ from the
default by changing the length of the WMs (exonic portions are kept constant) or by adding context to each position (which changes a WM to a WAM). The changes from
the aforementioned default architectures are as follows: In
A. thaliana, the acceptor is a 20 bp 1st order WAM, the
donor is a 9 bp 1st order WAM, and the start is a 12 bp 1st
order WAM. In C. elegans, the acceptor is a 15 bp WM, the
donor is a 9 bp 2nd order WAM, and the start is a 18 bp 2nd

order WAM. In D. melanogaster, the acceptor is a 40 bp 2nd
order WAM, the donor is a 15 bp 2nd order WAM, and the
start is a 18 bp 1st order WAM. In O. sativa, the acceptor is
a 40 bp WM. In addition, the intron models in A. thaliana
and C. elegans used explicit durations for a length of 250
bp.
Performance evaluation
All intra-species performance figures were calculated
using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy (non-overlapping
sets were trained on 4/5 of the data, gene prediction was
evaluated on 1/5 of the data, and the performance figures
were averaged over the 5 sets). Inter-species performance
did not employ 5-fold cross-validation since the training
and testing sets are from different genomes. Prior to gene
prediction, all sequences were masked with RepeatMasker
[25] with appropriate libraries using the MaskerAid [26]
enhancement. The repeat library for O. sativa was
obtained from TIGR [19]. Other repeat libraries were part
of the RepeatMasker distribution.

Genscan was run with the A. thaliana parameter file for A.
thaliana sequences and the human parameter file for the
others. Genefinder and HMMGene were run with C. elegans parameters. Augustus was run with the
"fly_singlestrand_partial.cfg" parameter file. Sensitivity
[true positives/(true positives + false negatives)] and specificity [true positives/(true positives + false positives)]
were calculated at the nucleotide, exon, and gene levels.
Gene sensitivity (fraction of genes predicted exactly correct) is also reported as gene accuracy.
SNAP implementation
SNAP is written in ANSI C as a command line Unix program. The source code is covered by the GNU General
Public License and is freely available from the author.
SNAP is a relatively efficient program in both memory and
time; it requires about 100 megabytes of memory and 30
cpu seconds to decode a 1 Mbp sequence on a 1 Ghz
machine. CPU time and memory scale linearly with
sequence length.
