Abstract
Background: Metal hyperaccumulators, including various Thlaspi species, constitutively express
the putative metal transporter MTP1 to high levels in shoots. Here we present data on the
transcriptional regulation and localization of expression of the homologous gene BjMTP1 in Brassica
juncea. Though B. juncea lacks the ability to hyperaccumulate metals, its relatively high biomass,
rapid growth and relatedness to true metal hyperaccumulating plants makes it a promising starting
point for the development of plants for phytoremediation. Our goal in this study is to determine
the transcriptional regulation of MTP1 in order to start to better understanding the physiological
role of MTP1 in B. juncea.
Results: Steady-state mRNA levels of BjMTP1 were found to be enhanced 8.8, 5.9, and 1.6-fold in
five-day-old B. juncea seedlings after exposure to Ni2+, Cd2+ or Zn2+, respectively. This was also
reflected in enhanced GUS activity in B. juncea seedlings transformed with BjMTP1
promoter::GUSPlus after exposure to these metals over a similar range of toxicities from mild to
severe. However, no increase in GUS activity was observed after exposure of seedlings to cold or
heat stress, NaCl or hydrogen peroxide. GUS expression in Ni2+ treated seedlings was localized in
roots, particularly in the root-shoot transition zone. In four- week- old transgenic plants BjMTP1
promoter activity also primarily increased in roots in response to Ni2+ or Cd2+ in plants
transformed with either GUS or mRFP1 as reporter genes, and expression was localized to the
secondary xylem parenchyma. In leaves, BjMTP1 promoter activity in response to Ni2+ or Cd2+
spiked after 24 h then decreased. In shoots GUS expression was prominently present in the
vasculature of leaves, and floral parts.
Conclusion: Our studies establish that a 983 bp DNA fragment upstream of the BjMTP1
translational start site is sufficient for the specific activation by Ni2+ and Cd2+ of BjMTP1 expression
primarily in roots. Activation of expression by both metals in roots is primarily localized to the
xylem parenchyma cells. This study is the first to identify specific Ni2+ and Cd2+ transcriptional
regulation and tissue localization of BjMTP1.

Background
Plant Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family members
have been suggested to be involved in metal ion transport,
and implicated in metal resistance in plants [1]. However,
the physiological role of these transporters is not well
understood. AtMTP1 (ZAT) from Arabidopsis thaliana was
the first member of the CDF family to be characterized in
plants [2]. When ectopically over expressed in A. thaliana
AtMTP1 confers enhanced resistance to Zn2+, and
increased Zn2+ accumulation in roots [2]. Enhanced Zn2+
resistance and accumulation was attributed to increased
vacuolar sequestration of Zn2+. More recent evidence has
established that AtMTP1 is predominantly localized at the
tonoplast membrane in both root and shoot tissue in A.
thaliana [3,4]. Consistent with a role in Zn2+ transport into
the vacuole, reduction in expression of AtMTP1 leads to
increased sensitivity to Zn2+, but not Co2+, Cd2+, Ni2+ or
Mn2+ [3,4]. Reduced expression of AtMTP1 also leads to
decreased accumulation of Zn2+ in shoots [4]. Reconstruction of AtMTP1 in proteoliposomes, and expression of the
AtMTP1 cDNA in Xenopus oocytes has provided direct evidence that AtMTP1 is competent to transport Zn2+ but not
Cd2+ or Co2+ [4,5]. To date all studies have found that
AtMTP1 expression is not modulated by exposure to elevated Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ or Mn2+ [2,4]. Expression of AtMTP1 in A. thaliana occurs throughout the plant,
though transcript levels are higher in roots than shoots in
young seedlings, and expression is higher in the inflorescences [4]. However, little is known about tissue-specific
expression patterns of AtMTP1. Such information is critical if we are to integrate the currently available data into a
model describing how MTP1 functions within the physiological context of the whole plant.
Homologues of AtMTP1 have been found in other plant
species including the hyperaccumulators Thlaspi goesingense [6], Thlaspi caerulescens [7] and Arabidopsis halleri [8].
It has been suggested that the constitutively higher shoot
expression of MTP1 in these hyperaccumulators is
involved in metal hyperaccumulation [6,7], and recent
genetic evidence supports this hypothesis [8]. However,
the role of the MTP1 protein in hyperaccumulation is still
unknown. In the Zn2+ hyperaccumulator A. halleri
AhMTP1 appears to be localized at the tonoplast membrane when transiently expressed as an AhMTP1::GFP
fusion in A. thaliana protoplasts [8]. Similar localization
has also been observed for an MTP1 homologue from
poplar [9]. However, in a similar experiment with
TgMTP1 from the Zn2+/Ni2+ hyperaccumulator T. goesingense the GFP fusion protein was found to localize to the
plasma membrane when transiently expressed in A. thaliana protoplasts derived from shoot tissue [10]. Resolution of this interesting difference awaits further
comparative studies.

Brassica juncea is an amphidiploid plant, resulting from
the hybridization of the crop Brassicas Brassica nigra and
Brassica campestris (syn. Rapa; [11]). It contains the conserved genomes of both of its diploid parents [12], and is
self compatible, unlike other crop Brassica species. Due to
its rapid growth and large biomass B. juncea has been considered as a possible plant for use in the phytoextraction
process, for the removal of pollutant metals from soils by
their accumulation into harvestable above ground biomass [13]. The relatedness of B. juncea to numerous
hyperaccumulators in the Brassicaceae family, and its ability to be self fertilized makes B. juncea a potentially good
recipient organisms for the bioengineering of a practical
phytoextraction plant using genetic material derived from
natural hyperaccumulator species [14]. However, such
promise has yet to be realized.
Brassica juncea have been shown to accumulate heavy metals, though B. juncea is not a hyperaccumulator [15-17].
However, there are no reports available that attribute a
specific role of BjMTP1 in metal accumulation in B. juncea. Here we report that both Ni2+ and Cd2+ induce transcriptional activation of BjMTP1 in whole seedlings, as
well as root and shoot tissue of mature plants, where as
Zn2+ has very little effect on BjMTP1 expression. We establish that a 983 bp DNA fragment upstream of the BjMTP1
translational start site is sufficient for this regulation, and
that expression in roots is specifically localized to the
xylem parenchyma cells. This study is the first to identify
transcriptional regulation and tissue localization of
BjMTP1. However, further work is needed to understand
the functional role of BjMTP1 in B. juncea's response to
Ni2+ and Cd2+.

Results
MTP1 sequences from B. juncea and its parents
Using AtMTP1 primers MTP1 homologues were amplified
from B. juncea and its two parents B. nigra and B. campestris (GenBank accession numbers EF128447, EF128446
and Ef128445, respectively). All Brassica sequences
showed 80% similarity to AtMTP1, and all were devoid of
introns similar to AtMTP1. Brassica nigra and B. campestris
MTP1 showed 97% and 95% similarity to the B. juncea
MTP1 sequence, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of
plant MTP1 sequences revealed that all Brassica MTP1
sequences fall into a monophyletic clade, with MTP1 from
B. juncea being equally related to MTP1 from both its parents [see Additional file 1]. Isolation of the DNA sequence
5' of BjMTP1 (see below) revealed that the next gene
upstream of BjMTP1 is 88% similar to the A. thaliana gene
locus At2g46790. At2g46790 is the next upstream gene to
AtMTP1 in A. thaliana. Such results show that synteny is
conserved within the region of MTP1 between B.juncea
and A.thaliana, and provides further strong evidence that

the MTP sequence identified in B. juncea is the B. juncea
homologue of AtMTP1.

Transcriptional activation of BjMTP1 by various metal
ions
Total RNA was isolated from dark grown seven-day-old B.
juncea seedlings which had been treated with either 5 µM
Cd2+, 25 µM Ni2+ or 75 µM Zn2+ for 48 h, treatments that
also produced maximal GUS activity in transgenic plants
expressing a GUS report gene (see below). These three
metals were chosen for this study based on the fact that
the hyper accumulators that are known to have constitutively elevated MTP1 expression hyperaccumulator Cd, Ni
or Zn. BjMTP1 mRNA were quantified using real time
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and normalized to
BjACTIN2 as an internal control. Steady-state levels of
BjMTP1 mRNA were found to be increased after exposure
of seedlings to Cd2+ or Ni2+ when compared to the level of
expression in the untreated control plants (Figure 1). Cd2+
and Ni2+ treatment caused a 5.9 and 8.8 fold increase in
BjMTP1 transcript levels, respectively, compared to
untreated control seedlings. Conversely, Zn2+ treated seedlings showed only a minor 1.6-fold increase in BjMTP1
mRNA.
Analysis of the transcriptional competency of the BjMTP1
promoter region
A 983 bp DNA fragment, originating upstream of the
BjMTP1 translational start site, was constructed as a transcriptional fusion with the GUSPlus reporter gene
[p(1.0)BjMTP1::GUSPlus]. Five-day-old dark grown seedlings stably transformed with p(1.0)BjMTP1::GUSPlus

Fold induction

Isolation and characterization of BjMTP1 promoter
A two-step genome walking technique was used to isolate
DNA 5' of the B. juncea MTP1 translational start site. As a
first step a 1,561 bp PCR product was amplified from the
DraI genomic DNA library and cloned. To isolate additional upstream sequence further genome walking was
performed using the PvuII genomic DNA library giving a
new 1,721 bp PCR product. Sequence analysis of this
1,721 bp DNA fragment indicated it contains not only the
remaining sequence 5' of BjMTP1 but also partial
sequence of the next gene upstream of BjMTP1 which
showed 88% similarity to the A. thaliana gene locus
At2g46790 (unknown protein). The 1,561 bp and 1,721
bp DNA fragments were compared and a contiguous
1,786 bp fragment determined. The complete 5' upstream
region (1,786 bp), as well as the 1,561 bp fragment, were
amplified from the B. juncea genomic DNA and the PCR
products used for all further analysis. A 983 bp DNA fragment 5' of BjMTP1 translational start site was predicted to
contain the majority of the regulatory elements within the
complete 1,786 bp upstream region, and was therefore
also amplified and used for further experiments.

Zn2+ for 48 h and GUS activity measured (Figure 2). GUS
activity was observed to peak at 25 µM Ni2+, 5 µM Cd2+
and 75 µM Zn2+, with increases in GUS activity of 3.0, 2.3
and 1.3-fold, respectively (Figure 2A–C). The metal concentrations used in this assay spanned a range from moderately to severally toxic, with the highest concentrations
of each metal causing complete loss of turger in the seedlings. To assess the level of toxicity at the end of this 48 h
assay rates of K+ leakage from the seedlings were measured. All metal treatments caused an increase in K+ leakage
peaking at 10 µM Cd2+, and 100 µM Ni2+ and Zn2+, after
which leakage rates dropped and this was associated with
a lose of both seedling turger and GUS activity (Figure 2A–
C). Histochemical GUS staining of both Cd2+ and Ni2+
treated seedlings demonstrated that the GUS protein
product of the p(1.0)BjMTP1::GUSPlus construct is localized mainly in the roots, showing strong expression at the
root-shoot transition zone (Figure 2D). In the untreated
transgenic seedlings, there was no observable GUS staining (Figure 2D).

transferred to medium of the same composition with the
addition of 50 µM Ni2+. Root and shoot samples were
taken over a 96 h time course and both Ni2+ accumulation
and GUS activity measured. Ni2+ accumulated in both

accumulating Ni2+ at approximately 10 times the rate of
the shoots (Figure 3A). In root samples, GUS enzyme
activity increased linearly as the Ni2+ exposure time
increased, with a 3.2 fold increase in GUS activity after 48
h Ni2+ treatment compared to basal expression (0 h), or to
untransformed control plants (Figure 3B). In shoots, the
overall GUS activity was less than in the roots. Interestingly, in shoots GUS activity only transiently increased
after 24 h exposure, compared to untransformed plants,
after which GUS activity decreased to levels observed at 0
h exposure (Figure 3B), even though Ni2+ accumulation in
shoots continued (Figure 3A). Similar results for both root
and shoot expression were also obtained with plants stably transformed with p(1.0)BjMTP1::EYFP (yellow fluorescent

were transferred to nutrient solution lacking Ni2+. After a
further 48 h recovery GUS activity in roots was observed
to return to that observed at 0 h exposure (Figure 3B). His-

Similar mRFP1 expression was also obtained when plants
were exposed to 5 µM Cd2+ for 48 h and allowed to
recover from Cd2+ exposure for a further 48 h. mRFP1
accumulated rapidly in roots after Cd2+ exposure to levels
equivalent to expression driven by pCaMV35S (Figure
4C). Removal of plants from the Cd2+ containing nutrient
solution caused a rapid drop in mRFP1 accumulation,
with mRFP1 levels returning to those observed prior to
Cd2+ exposure, after 48 h recovery (Figure 4C). Again, all
three-promoter sizes gave similar responses. Cd2+ treatment also produced a transient accumulation of mRFP1
in shoots after 24 h exposure (Figure 4D), as observed
during Ni2+ exposure (Figure 4B). Unlike Ni2+ and Cd2+
exposure, Zn2+ treatment produced no significant alteration in mRFP1 accumulation in either root or shoot tissue
(Figure. 4E &4F). Elemental analysis of the nutrient solutions during the Ni2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ experiments confirmed that concentrations of Ni2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ did not
vary significantly in the solution during the course of the
experiments (data not shown).

ments was assessed after construction and transformation
of B. juncea with transcriptional fusions with the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1) as a reporter gene.
Hydroponically grown four-week-old B. juncea plants
transformed with the mRFP1 reporter constructs were
exposed to either 5 µM Cd2+, 50 µM Ni2+ or 50 µM Zn2+ in
aerated 0.1× Hoaglands solution. Root and shoot samples
were collected over a 96 h time-course and mRFP1 expression quantified using a luminescence spectrometer. As a
control for metal related effects on the in vivo stability of
mRFP1 pCaMV35S:: mRFP1 transformed plants were also
generated and treated in a similar manner. In roots isolated from Ni2+ treated plants, mRFP1 accumulation
increased linearly with time of Ni2+ exposure, and the
kinetics of mRFP1 accumulation were equivalent regardless of the size of the promoter construct used to drive
mRFP1 expression (Figure 4A). All three promoter constructs produced higher mRFP1 accumulation after 48 h
Ni2+ exposure than observed with the CaMV35S promoter. Plants were removed from the Ni2+ containing
medium after 48 h exposure and allowed to recover for a
further 48 h. During this recovery period, mRFP1 accumulation decreased linearly with time in a similar manner
regardless of the size of the promoter region (Figure 4A).
In leaves from Ni2+ exposed plants, all three promoter
constructs drove a similar transient increase in mRFP1
accumulation that peaked at 24 h Ni2+ treatment, after
which they declined at a similar rate to the response
observed for the promoter GUS construct. mRFP1 expression in plants transformed with pCaMV35S::mRFP1 was
constant at all time points and tissues after Ni2+ exposure.

Response of the 983 bp promoter element to other abiotic

The 983 bp promoter region, which was found to be sufficient for expression in response to Cd2+ and Ni2+, was
also tested for its ability to activate transcription when
seedlings were exposed to other abiotic stresses including
cold, heat, NaCl and H2O2. Five-day-old B. juncea seedlings stably transformed with p (1.0) BjMTP1::GUSPlus
were exposed to a cold (4°C) or heat (37°C) shock, and
also 100 mM NaCl, or H2O2 (5 µM, 10 µM, 100 µM 500
µM and 1 mM) after which GUS activity was assayed.
There were no significant increases in GUS activity compared to the untreated seedlings for any of the treatments
(Table 1).

p(1.0)BjMTP1::GUSPlus were incubated at 4°C for 4 h (cold shock), 37°
C for 2 h (heat shock),100 mM NaCl (24 h) and 50 µM H2O2 (24 h)
and GUS activity measured. Data represents the average (± SD) of
three independent replicate samples.

Putative regulatory elements in the BjMTP1 promoter
region
A search for putative regulatory DNA elements within the
983 bp promoter region of BjMTP1 was performed using
the PLACE [18] and PlantCARE databases [19] (Figure 5).
DNA regulatory motifs such as the CCAAT boxes, ABRE
(Abscisic Acid Response Element), bZIP, G box, and several pathogen responsive elements such as W box, EIRE,
SEBF motif, GCC box, G box coupler and MYB core elements were found. However, no known metal regulatory
elements such as MREs which are known to mediate Zn2+
and Cd2+ specific transcriptional activation of metallothionine genes in mammals were found [20-22]. Considering that AtMTP1 appears not to be regulated by Cd2+
[4] and BjMTP1 is (Figure 1, 2, 3, 4), we compared the 983
bp BjMTP1 promoter region with a similar region of the
A. thaliana AtMTP1 sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site (35715 bp to 36698 bp of A. thaliana chromosome 2 clone F19D11). Even though both promoter
regions had many known regulatory elements in common, namely bZIP, G box, W box, EIRE box and MYB core
element, the BjMTP1 promoter region also has several
unique regulatory elements, namely ABRE and pathogen
related SEBF motif, GCC box and G box coupler elements
(Figure 5). The core sequence of the metal regulatory element [MRE-TGCRCNC [22]] found in mammals
(mouse), is present in the full 1786 bp upstream region of
BjMTP1 with a single base pair difference (TGCACTG).
However, because this motif is not present in the 983 bp
promoter region sufficient for Cd2+ and Ni2+ regulation
(Figure 2, 3, 4), this MRE is unlikely to play a role in the
Cd2+ and Ni2+ transcriptional regulation of BjMTP1.

strong root expression of GUS and mRFP1 in response to
Cd2+ or Ni2+ treatment (Figure 2, 3, 4). However, in order
to help understand the function of BjMTP1, it is also
important to identify which root tissues are expressing
BjMTP1 during the response to Cd2+ or Ni2+ exposure. Sections from the main root and intact lateral roots of fourweek-old B. juncea plants expressing mRFP1 in response to
Ni2+ were analyzed by epifluorescence and light microscope (Figure 6). Sections were taken from the top of the
main root as well as 1.5 cm from the root tip, and the morphology of the roots examined (Figure. 6A &6B). The
main root has clearly undergone secondary growth. The
epidermis found in the primary roots has been replaced in
4-week-old roots by periderm produced by the cork cambium. Within the periderm lies the pericycle, and the cambial zone which gives rise to the secondary phloem and
secondary xylem. The secondary xylem parenchyma, produced by vascular cambium, was observed surrounding
the secondary xylem vessels. The presence of diarch xylem
at the center of the root section is a characteristic of the
Brassicaceae family (personal communication G. Myer,
South Dakota State University). Sections taken 1.5 cm
from the tip of the main root were observed to have simi-

lar root architecture to sections taken from the top of the
root. After exposure to Ni2+ mRFP1 fluorescence was
observed to be specifically localized in the secondary
xylem parenchyma tissues that surround the secondary
xylem (Figure. 6C &6D). Fluorescence from mRFP1 was
also present in the periderm (Figure. 6C) but no significant fluorescence was observed in other root tissues. In
the lateral roots, mRFP1 fluorescence was clearly evident
in the vascular region (Figure. 6E and 6F). After Ni2+ exposure no fluorescence was observed in roots from plants
identified as null segregants for the reporter construct
even after longer (6 s) exposures, compared to the shorter
(100 ms) exposure for Ni2+-treated transgenic plants [see
Additional file 2]. Cd2+ treated roots gave an equivalent
expression pattern to that of Ni2+ treated plants [see Additional file 2]. In both Ni2+ and Cd2+ treated roots there was
no difference in the pattern of mRFP1 accumulation
between sections taken from the top of the main root and
its tip. Furthermore, mRFP1 expression was localized in
the secondary xylem parenchyma tissues when expressed
from the 983, 1,561 or 1,786 bp promoter regions. The
strong accumulation of mRFP1 observed in the vascular
tissue of intact lateral roots (Figure. 6E &6F) is also consistent with the secondary xylem parenchyma localization
observed in the root cross-sections. Cross-sections of roots
prepared from Ni2+ exposed plants transformed with the
GUSplus reporter gene also revealed strong GUS expression in the secondary xylem parenchyma surrounding the
secondary xylem (Figure. 6G), similar to that observed for
mRFP1 expression (Figure. 6C &6D). Secondary xylem
parenchyma localization was also observed in plants
expressing a EYFP reporter driven by the 983 bp promoter
region [see Additional file 2].

Discussion
Here we establish that mRNA levels of BjMTP1 in B. juncea
are transcriptionally regulated in response to Cd2+ and
Ni2+, with maximal expression in the root xylem parenchyma cells. We identify a 983 bp DNA fragment, within
the total 1,786 bp DNA sequence upstream of the BjMTP1
translational start site, which is sufficient for this transcriptional regulation, which appears specific to stress
induced by Cd2+ and Ni2+. BjMTP1 promoter activity in
response to Ni2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ was assessed at concentrations that span a similar range of toxicities from mild to
serve. Over these similar ranges of metal-induced stress
only Ni2+ and Cd2+ were observed to elicit a transcriptional response from the BjMTP1 promoter, with Zn2+
induced stress having no significant effect. Other forms of
abiotic stress including cold, heat or NaCl also produced
no significant transcriptional response. Transcriptional
activation of BjMTP1 promoter by Cd2+ and Ni2+ is also
not an indirect response to oxidative stress, since this promoter region is not activated by direct exposure to H2O2.

Our results are consistent with the observation in A. thaliana that the homologue AtMTP1 is also not regulated by
Zn2+ [2-4,8]. However, our observation that BjMTP1
expression is transcriptionally regulated by Cd2+ and Ni2+
is not consistent with that observed in A. thaliana, where
AtMTP1 mRNA levels are unaffected by Cd2+ [4]. Our
results suggests that rather than being a house-keeping
gene involved in Zn2+ homeostasis as has been suggested
in A. thaliana, in B. juncea BjMTP1 may be involved in the
dynamic regulation of Zn homeostasis as part of the
plant's response to Cd2+ and Ni2+ induced stress. We
emphasize that our data does not suggest that the function
of BjMTP1 is to transport Cd2+ or Ni2+, for which we have
no evidence. However, increased expression of BjMTP1
under Cd2+ or Ni2+ stress may be required to adjust Zn
homeostasis as a response to the stress imposed by exposure to Cd2+ or Ni2+. This is supported by our observation
that expression of BjMTP1 promoter is dynamically regu-

lated in response to these metals, rapidly increasing after
exposure to Cd2+ and Ni2+, and rapidly returning back to
basal levels after these metals are removed from the
growth medium.
Though expression of the BjMTP1 promoter in response
to Cd2+ and Ni2+ is highest in roots, expression was also
observed in the vascular tissue of leaves, anthers and in
the stigma. Expression of BjMTP1 in these tissues suggests
that the BjMTP1 protein may also be involved in the
plants response to Cd2+ and Ni2+ stress in leaves and inflorescences. Though transcriptional activation of the 983 bp
promoter region in roots by Cd2+ or Ni2+ occurs nearly in
a linear fashion with time of exposure and accumulation,
shoot activation appears transient. After 24 h of metal
exposure transcription of BjMTP1 reaches a maximum
and then declines to baseline expression after 48 h. Such
transient expression is intriguing considering that over the
same time frame Ni2+ accumulates linearly in shoots. The
different expression patterns of BjMTP1 promoter in roots
and shoots imply that this protein plays different roles in
the plant's coordinated response to Cd2+ and Ni2+ exposure, though what these roles are remain unclear at this
time.
In five-day-old seedlings of B. juncea expression of
BjMTP1 promoter in response to Cd2+ and Ni2+ occurs
throughout the seedlings, though is especially localized to
the root and shoot-root transition zone. Though the reasons for stronger expression BjMTP1 promoter in the
shoot-root transition zone are not known, this type of
expression pattern has been observed previously for several proteins, including naphthylphthalmic acid (NPA)
associated amino peptidases, glutathione S-transferase
ATGSTF2, the auxin transporter PIN2, and PGP4 an ABC
type transporter [23-26].
When compared to A. thaliana, the unique elements
present in the BjMTP1 promoter region, including ABRE,
SEBF motif, GCC box and G box coupler elements all have
known functions in ABA signaling [27] or pathogen
related stress [28-30]. However, none of these promoter
elements have been established to play a role in signaling
Cd2+ or Ni2+ stress. The elements responsible for regulation of BjMTP1 expression in response to Cd2+ and Ni2+
remain to be identified. This study is the first to identify
transcriptional regulation and tissue localization of
BjMTP1. However, further work is needed to understand
the functional role of BjMTP1 in B. juncea's response to
Ni2+ and Cd2+.

Conclusion
Here we conclude that a 983 bp DNA fragment upstream
of the BjMTP1 translational start site is sufficient for the
specific activation by Ni2+ and Cd2+ of BjMTP1 expression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/32

primarily in roots. Activation of expression by both metals
in roots is primarily localized to the xylem parenchyma
cells. This study is the first to identify specific Ni2+ and
Cd2+ transcriptional regulation and tissue localization of
BjMTP1 and supports the conclusion that BjMTP1 is
involved in the response of B. juncea to Ni2+ and Cd2+
exposure.

Methods
Plant material
Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) seeds (accession no.
426308) were obtained from the North central regional
plant introduction station (Ames, IA) Brassica juncea seeds
(30 seeds) were germinated and grown in 800 mL of continuously aerated distilled water as described in [16].
Seedlings were maintained in the dark at 21°C for 5 days,
and the water changed on every third day. Brassica juncea
plants were also grown hydroponically in 8 L of aerated
0.1× Hoagland's medium [31]., changed weekly, for four
weeks with 16 h light (150 µmol m -2 s-1) at 25° C. All
transgenic plants used in the study were homozygous for
the transgene.
Cloning of MTP1 genomic DNA
Genomic DNA was isolated from 10-day-old B. juncea, B.
nigra and B. campestris seedlings using a DNeasy plant
mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Taking advantage of the
fact that AtMTP1 contains no introns, we isolated full
length BjMTP1 cDNA by PCR using 5'-ATGGAGTCTTCAAGTCCCCA3'(forward
primer)
and
5'TAGAGCGCTCGATTTGTAT-3' (reverse primer) primers
based on the AtMTP1 sequences. After obtaining genomic
sequences 5' of BjMTP1 by genome walking (see below)
BjMTP1, BnMTP1 and BcMTP1 genomic DNAs were reamplified using forward primer 5'- ATGGCGTATTCAAGCCCCCAACG- 3' and reverse primer 5'GCTCTAGAGCGCTCGATTTGTATGG -3' designed based
on the sequence of BjMTP1. Conditions used in all the
PCR reactions are as follows: initial denaturation 94°C
followed by 30 cycles of 94° C 30 sec, 55° C 40 sec, 72°
C 1 min and 30 sec and final extension at 72° C for 10
min. PCR products was cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector system and sequenced using Big dye terminator v 3.0
method (Applied Biosystems Foster city, CA) with universal M13 primers.
Analysis of BjMTP1 mRNA expression in five day old
seedlings
For metal treatment five-day-old dark grown seedlings
were transferred to distilled water containing 25 µM Ni2+,
75 µM Zn2+ or 5 µM Cd2+ and incubated for a further 48 h
in the dark with aeration. After metal treatment seedlings
were washed in distilled water before proceeding to further analysis. Three independent replicate samples were
used for all analyses. Metal concentrations were chosen

based on the concentrations that produced the maximal
increase in GUS activity in transgenic B. juncea containing
a BjMTP1 promoter::GUS construct (see below).
Total RNA from metal exposed seedlings was isolated
using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using
the DNase digestion step to reduce DNA contamination.
cDNA was reverse transcribed using 4 µg of total RNA and
200 U Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
CA) primed with 100 ng of random hexamers (Invitrogen
life technologies, Carbsbad, CA), and the cDNA diluted to
2.6 ngµL-1. Real time quantitative PCR was done as previously described [32]. BjACTIN2 was used as a normalization control for the relative quantification of transcript
levels. Since the B. juncea ACTIN2 gene sequence was not
available A. thaliana ACTIN2 primers (forward primer-5'AAGATCTGGCATCACACTTTC- 3', reverse primer-5'TAGTCAACAGCAACAAAGGAG- 3') were used to amplify
a 529 bp homolog from B. juncea. For qRT-PCR primers
were designed to generate ~100 bp products using Primer
Express v. 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). Primers used for qRT-PCR were as follows:
BjACTIN2 forward primer-5'-GAGGATGGCATGTGGAAGAGA- 3', reverse primer- 5' -GTGCTGGATTCTGGTGATGGT3',
BjMTP1
forward
primer5'TGCGGCTTCTCAGATCTCAA- 3' and reverse primer-5'TGCGCATGGAGGCATTG- 3'. Quantitative RT- PCR was
performed on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA, USA), following
the manufacturers recommendations, and optimized
primer concentrations were selected based on denaturing
curve analysis and the fewest cycles needed to cross the
critical threshold (Ct). Four reactions were done per biological sample and three independent replicate samples
per treatment were used. SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) was used to detect cDNA amplification. Data was analyzed using the SDS software (Applied
Biosystems version 1.0), following the method of Livak
and Schmittgen [33]. Ct values were determined based on
efficiency of amplification. The mean Ct values were normalized against the corresponding BjACTIN2 Ct values
and calculated as (Ct BjMTP1- Ct BjACTIN2). The relative
expression of BjMTP1 was calculated as fold induction
from untreated seedlings using the 2-∆∆Ct method (∆∆Ct =
(CtBjMTP1-CtBjACTIN2) metal treated – (CtBjMTP1 - CtBJACTIN2)
untreated [33]). The data is presented as fold change in
BjMTP1 gene expression (normalized to BjACTIN2) relative to the untreated control seedlings. For untreated control samples 2-∆∆Ct is one since ∆∆Ct is zero. The final
standard error was estimated by evaluating the 2-∆∆Ct term
using ∆∆Ct plus standard deviation and ∆∆Ct minus the
standard deviation [33].

BjMTP1 promoter::report gene construction
For the isolation of the 5' sequence upstream of the
BjMTP1 translational start site we used a Universal
Genome Walker kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. First round of DNA
fragment amplification used BjMTP1 gene specific primers,
GSP1
5'-GAAGAAAGCACGACAAGTCTGGCAAGTTTA-3'
and
GSP2
-5'CGTGCTTTCTTCAACGGCTTTGCTGC3'
(nested),
located (+) 49 to (+) 78 bp and (+) 3 to (+) 31 bp relative
to the translational start site. For second round amplification primers were 5'-CTGCTAGCTTCTTCCTGCAATCATAT-3' and 5'-ACCTGTAGTAATCAACCTCAGTTACC-3
(nested) located (-) 1302 to (-) 1328 bp and (-)1337 to () 1357 bp relative to translational start site. PCR amplified
products were cloned into either pGEM T-Easy vector system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) or PCR-XLTOPO vector (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carbsbad,
CA). Cloned constructs were transformed into chemically
competent E. coli Top10 F- cells (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carbsbad, CA). Positive clones were sequenced
using Big dye terminator v 3.0 method (Applied Biosystems Foster city, CA) with universal M13 primers. DNA
sequences were analyzed by BlastN [34] and known regulatory elements identified using PLACE [18] and PlantCARE [19]. Putative eukaryotic promoter analysis was
done using BGDP, a neural network eukaryotic promoter
prediction program [35]. BjMTP1 promoter sequence has
been submitted to Genbank (#EF128447).

The GUSPlus gene was PCR amplified from pCambia
1305.1 binary vector using high fidelity Platinum TAQ
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen life technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) and gene specific primers complementary to the
GUSPlus gene. The sense and antisense primers contained
engineered EcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively. The GUSPlus primers used were: GUSPlus-BamHI-5'-CGGGATCCCATGGTAGATCTGAGGGTAAATTTCTAGT- 3', GUSPlus
EcoRI -5'-CGGAATTCTCACACGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGCTAGC- 3'. PCR products were cloned into pGEM TEasy vector. The cloned PCR products were chemically
transformed into E. coli DH5α, positive clones digested
with BamHI and EcoRI and the released cDNAs cloned
into the CaMV35S cassette-pUC19 [36] using the same
restriction enzyme sites. The insertion of the cDNA product in the correct orientation was confirmed by PCR using
promoter specific and 35S PolyA tail specific primers (5'ATAAGAATGCGGCGATATCGATATCGATCTGGATTTTAGTA-3'), and further confirmed by sequencing. Using
unique EcoRV sites the entire promoter cassettes were
cloned into pGreen 0229 binary vector containing the bar
gene as a selectable marker. mRFP1 [37] was directly isolated from the pRSET B vector and cloned into CaMV35S
cassette using BamHI-EcoRI sites.

Based on the previously identified sequence information,
different sizes of BjMTP1 promoter regions were PCR
amplified using high fidelity platinum Taq DNA polymerase with 5' PstI- 3' BamHI promoter specific primers. The
primers used were Bj 983 bp 5' PstI 5'-AACTGCAGAGTTTCCATTTTTGTTTTCGTGCTAAATAA-3', Bj1561 bp 5'
PstI-5'-AACTGCAGTGCACTGATGAAGTTCCGGATGAAGAGGAA-3', Bj 1786 bp 5' PstI-5'-AACTGCAGACAGACAAAACCAGTTTCTTCAGTCCGGGA-3' and Bj rev
BamHI-5'-CGGGATCCTCTGAAAAGAAAAAAATCAGAGAAAGTTCA-3'. The PCR amplified BjMTP1 promoter
regions were cloned into PCR-XL-TOPO vector. Positive
clones containing PCR-XL-TOPO: BjMTP1 promoter
regions were digested with PstI and BamHI and the
released DNA cloned into pGreen 0229 containing specific reporter gene cassettes outlined above, after removing the CaMV35S promoter from the vector by PstIBamHI digestion. All the cloned promoter regions (983
bp, 1,561 bp and 1,786 bp) contained the respective 5'
UTR of the BjMTP1 gene and all the constructs contained
only the start codon from their respective reporter genes.
The ligated constructs were transformed into E. coli
DH5α. Positive clones were identified by PCR using a
combination of promoter specific and reporter gene specific primers and further confirmed by sequencing. All the
pGreen constructs were mixed with pSoup plasmid DNA
and transformed into electro competent disarmed Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101. Positive clones were
selected by colony PCR.
Plant transformation and regeneration
Transgenic B. juncea plants were obtained by tissue culture
based on a previously established protocol (personal
communication Thomas Leustek, Rutgers University).
Briefly, petioles were excised from cotyledons of five-dayold in vitro grown seedlings on agar solidified half strength
MS medium [38] and cultured in MS medium with 3 %
(w/v) sucrose, 2.5 g L-1 Gelrite, 2 mg L -1 6-benzylaminopurine, and 0.1 mg L-1 naphthalene acetic acid under a 16
hour photoperiod (100 µmol m -2 s -1) at 25°C for 2 days.
Petioles were transformed with A. tumefaciens GV3101
harboring pGreen 0229 containing BjMTP1 promoter
reporter gene constructs.Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain
GV3101 carrying the pGreen vectors were grown for 48 h
in 30 mL liquid YEP medium containing 1 g L-1 yeast
extract, 5 g L-1 beef extract, 5 g L-1 bacto-peptone, 5 g L-1
sucrose, 0.5 g L-1 MgSO4.7H2O and 100 mg L-1 kanamycin
in a 28°C shaker at 250 rpm until the culture reached an
OD600 of 0.7. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation
and the bacterial pellet resuspended in 30 mL MS liquid
medium. Petioles were incubated with the A. tumefaciens
suspension for 20 min, blotted dry using sterile filter
paper and transferred to freshly prepared tobacco (BY2
cell line) feeder layer plates. After 48 h incubation in the
dark, petioles were rinsed in medium containing MS salt,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/32

3% (w/v) sucrose, and 500 mg L-1 carbencillin for 40 min.
The petioles were cultured on MS medium containing 2
mg L-1 TDZ and 0.1 mg L-1 IAA with 500 mg L-1 carbenicillin for three to four weeks under 16 h photoperiod (100
µmol m -2 s -1). Roots were induced from regenerated
shoots in solid MS medium containing 2 mg L-1 indole-3butyric acid. Plantlets were later transferred to soil for further growth. Putative transformants were selected based
on their ability to grow in regeneration medium containing 3 mg L-1 glufosinate ammonium (active ingredient of
Basta). Transformants were also analyzed for the presence
of the introduced DNA constructs using PCR. T2 and T3
homozygous lines were selected by spraying BASTA (8 mg
L-1) on 15-day old plants with fully expanded first leaves
(total of 4 applications on every third day), and further
confirmed by PCR.
Analysis of BjMTP1 promoter activity
For analysis of metal regulated promoter activity five-dayold dark grown seedlings were treated with various concentrations of Ni2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ in distilled water for 48
h in the dark. For heat shock similar seedlings were incubated at 37°C for 2 h as described in [39]. Cold shock was
given at 4°C for 4 h following the method of [40]. For salt
treatment seedlings were treated with 100 mM NaCl as
described in [41] for 24 h in the dark with aeration. Seedlings were also exposed to H2O2 at 5 µM, 10 µM, 50 µM,
100 µM, 500 µM and 1 mM H2O2 for 24 h, changing solutions every 12 h. For metal treatment in mature B. juncea
four-week-old hydroponically grown plants were transferred to aerated 0.1 × Hoagland's solution containing 50
µM Ni2+, 50 µM Zn2+ or 5 µM Cd2+. To maintain a constant Cd2+concentration throughout the experiment the
hydroponic media was replaced at 12 h intervals. Because
of the higher initial concentration of Ni2+ and Zn2+ their
concentrations were found to not significantly change
during the experiment, as analyzed by ICP-MS (data not
shown). For recovery experiments plants were transferred
to aerated 0.1 × Hoagland's solution lacking either Ni2+,
Cd2+ or elevated Zn2+. Root and shoot samples were also
analyzed for Ni2+ accumulation by ICP-MS. Three independent replicate samples were used for each analysis. For
total GUS activity tissue samples were homogenized in
liquid nitrogen and suspended in 200 µL of extraction
buffer (50 mM NaHPO4 pH 7.0, 2 mM DTT, 10 mM Na2
EDTA, 0.1 % (w/v) sodium lauryl sarcosine and 0.1 % (v/
v) Triton X- 100; [42]) and the soluble protein fraction
collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Quantitative
fluorometric analysis of GUS enzymatic activity was carried out according to [42]. Fluorescence was measured
using a luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer model #
LS 55, Life and Analytical Sciences Boston, MA) after 60
min incubation with the GUS substrate. Each assay was
performed using three independent replicate samples.
Total protein content was determined using a BCA protein

assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). GUS activity data is expressed as nmoles of 4-methylumbelliferone(MU)min-1 mg-1 of extracted protein. Histochemical
GUS analysis of B. juncea tissues was performed based on
a standard protocol [43]. GUS localization was analyzed
using an Olympus Vanox light microscope (Olympus
America Inc. Melville, NY). For photography a SPOT-RT
digital camera (Diagnostic instruments Sterling Heights,
MI) attached to the microscope was used. For quantitative
fluorometric assay of mRFP1 in tissue samples 100 mg
fresh weight of tissue was homogenized in liquid nitrogen
and suspended in 200 µL of the PBS buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mM DTT, and the soluble protein fraction collected
after centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The relative mRFP1
emission (607 nm) in the samples was measured using a
luminescence spectrometer (model # LS 55 PerkinElmer
Life and Analytical Sciences Boston, MA) after excitation
at 584 nm. Each assay was performed using three independent replicate samples. For epifluorescence microscopy tissues were immediately incubated in PBS buffer
and hand sections prepared for localization of mRFP1
expression. Epifluorescence was observed using Nikon E
800 compound microscope equipped with Rhodamine –
Texas red (exciter λ 560 ± 20, dichroic λ Q 585 LP and
emitter λ 610 LP) filter. For photography SPOT-RT digital
camera attached to the microscope was used.
Metal Toxicity Measurements
Metal toxicity measurements were done using K+ leakage
in five-day-old seedlings containing p(1.0)BjMTP1::GUSPlus, following a method adapted from [44]. After metal
treatment seedlings (n = 5) were removed and placed in
10 mL of distilled water for 60 min, the solution filtered
through a 0.2 µm filter and K+ measured using ICP-MS.
Untreated seedlings were used as a control. Seedlings used
for K+ efflux were dried at 68°C for 48 h and K+ leakage
expressed on a dry weigh basis.
Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectroscopy
Plant tissue sample were washed once in 18 MΩ, dried
overnight at 90°C weighed and digested in concentrated
HNO3 acid (OmniTrace, EM) at 110°C for 4 h. Ni, Cd and
Zn were quantified in the samples using an ICP-MS (Elan
DRCe, PerkinElmer) following our published methods
[45]. K concentration in K+-leakage assays were measured
directly in the assay solution using ICP-MS (Elan DRCe,
PerkinElmer).
