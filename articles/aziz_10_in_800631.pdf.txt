Background
Pathogenic bacteria incessantly evolve mechanisms to
resist their host’s innate immunity. One such mechanism is molecular camouflage: the modification of bacterial surface molecules to make them unrecognizable by
the host’s immune system or resistant to its effector

molecules. Recently, a peptidoglycan deacetylase (PgdA)
was discovered in Streptococcus pneumoniae that renders bacterial peptidoglycan resistant to human lysozyme, thus preventing host-mediated cell wall damage
[1-3]. In addition, polysaccharide deacetylases with different substrate specificities were identified in other

Figure 1 ConSurf [7,8] analysis of peptidoglycan and polysaccharide deacetylases of gram-positive cocci. The analysis involves the surface
mapping of aligned amino acid sequences to the three-dimensional structure of S. pneumoniae PgdA (Protein Data Bank ID 2c1g). Highly
conserved residues are shown in red (some are labeled for reference). These residues, conserved among the aligned proteins, are located within
one region of the enzyme, surrounding the acetyl-binding groove.

gram-positive bacteria and shown to contribute to virulence (e.g., IcaB of Staphylococcus epidermidis [4] and
Pdi or Streptococcus iniae [5]).

Materials and methods
In this study, genomes of streptococci and other representative gram-positive cocci were screened for the presence of functional homologs of PgdA, the prototypic
pneumococcal peptidoglycan deacetylase. Subsequently,
amino acid sequences of homologous proteins were
aligned[6] and mapped to the three-dimensional structure of PgdA (Protein Data Bank ID: 2c1g). The ConSurf tool[7,8] was used for surface mapping of the
phylogenetic information calculated from the multiple
sequence alignments.

Results
Primary screening identified at least one intact pgdA
orthologous gene in every sequenced pathogenic streptococcal species and other paralogous polysaccharide
deacetylases. Multiple sequence alignment of PgdA
homologs proteins, phylogenetic analysis, and chromosomal context analysis suggest that these proteins are
under host selective pressure. All PgdA orthologs share
a conserved Pfam protein domain (PF01522), and 40
amino acid residues are 100% identical, but non-randomly distributed in beta-sheets in the C-terminal half
of each streptococcal PgdA. ConSurf structural conservation analysis revealed that highly conserved residues
in PgdA orthologs and paralogs surround the enzyme’s
acetyl-binding groove (Figure 1).
Conclusion
Taken together, these data suggest the conservation of
PgdA in pathogenic streptococci, the presence of PgdA
orthologs and paralogs in gram-positive cocci, and the
high conservation of amino acid residues surrounding
the active site of these enzymes. These residues may be
tested as potential targets for the rational design of
novel, immune-assisted antibacterial agents.
