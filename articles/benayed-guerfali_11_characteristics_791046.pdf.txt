Abstract
Backgroud: EBV-associated Gastric Carcinoma (EBVaGC) has a distinct clinical features and its prevalence is variable
worldwide.
Results: To determine the prevalence of EBVaGC in Tunisia, EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) expression was
assessed in 81 gastric carcinoma (GC) specimens. The nuclear EBER expression was detected in 12 out of 81 GC
cases (14.81%) and concordance between the score range of EBER staining and the number of EBV DNA copies as
estimate by QPCR is observed. On the other hand, we found that EBVaGC strongly correlated with age at
diagnosis, and weakly with tumor differentiation and venous invasion.
Furthermore, the EBVaGC specimens were subjected to determine the EBV DNA polymorphisms. Our results show
a unique genetic profile of the EBV strains regarding the A and D types, the F prototype, the retention of XhoI
restriction site and the 30 bp del-LMP1 variant. According to our previous studies on nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), we suggested that EBV strains associated to GC and NPC shared some similarities in Tunisian patients.
Conclusion: The prevalence of EBVaGC is of 14.81% in the southern Tunisia and that common EBV strain are
associated with both NPC and GC which are likely to differ from Asian strains. Our findings support therefore a
certain geographical distribution of EBV strains which is not restricted to EBV-associated malignancies.

Background
Gastric carcinoma (GC) is the second leading cause of
cancer death worldwide [1]. The incidence of GC varies
from one geographic region to another, suggesting that
genetic and environmental factors including Helicobacter pylori infection are considered to contribute to gastric carcinogenesis [2,3]. In southern Tunisia, the annual
incidence of GC varies from 2.6 to 4.8/100 000 persons
[4]. In the few past years, many reports have explored
the association between Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection and GC [5-9]. The EBV-associated GC (EBVaGC)
has been evidenced by the presence of uniform expression of EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) in GC cells

[10], the detection of monoclonal EBV episomes in GC
cells [11] and the increase of serum antibodies against
viral capsid antigen [12]. The incidence of EBVaGC varies widely from 2 to 18% as reported by previous studies
[13-20]. Moreover, the clinical features of EBVaGC
include male predominance, relatively younger age and
location in the proximal stomach [9,21]. The EBVaGC
shows a lower rate of lymph-node involvement and has
a relatively favourable prognosis compared to EBV-negative one [22].
In EBVaGC, infection of tumor cells is characterized
by a type I pattern of latency, in which the expression of
viral latent genes is restricted to Epstein-Barr nuclear
antigen (EBNA)-1, EBER, latent membrane protein
LMP-2A and transcripts from the BamHI A rightward
frame (BARF)-0 and -1 [11,23]. Since the EBV products
of type I latent infection have been demonstrated to be

involved in EBV-mediated tumorogenesis, it was suggested that the oncogenic process in EBVaGC could be
driven by different mechanisms from those of conventional GC. Subsequently, EBVaGC malignancy could be
considered as a different entity among GC which
requires greater attention to improve patient care.
The present study was conducted with the aim to
determine the prevalence of EBVaGC in southern Tunisia and subsequently to analyze specific EBV polymorphisms in the tumor isolates.

Materials and methods
Patient’s characteristics

A total of 81 primary gastric carcinomas were collected,
between January 1999 and December 2009 from patients
who underwent radical surgical resection at the Department of Digestive Surgery of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital (Sfax, Tunisia). All patients gave informed
consent prior to specimen collection according to institutional guidelines. None of the patients had pre-operative or post-operative chemotherapy. Clinicopathological parameters such as gender, age, anatomical
site, histological type, pathological stage, tumor size and
venous invasion were evaluated by reviewing medical
charts and pathological records. At the time of surgery,
the age of patients ranged from 18 to 94 years (mean:
59.58 years). The anatomical site of tumor was determined according to the predominant location of the
lesion as cardia (n = 8), body (n = 22), and antrum (n =
48). The histological subtypes were classified according
to the criteria of Lauren [24] as intestinal type (n = 47)
and diffuse type (n = 34) but also of World Health
Organization as poorly differentiated (n = 43), moderately differentiated (n = 26) and well-differentiated (n =
9). The clinical stage of the disease was determined
according to the tumor, node and metastasis (TNM)
classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer [25]. Our cohort contains 9 patients at stage I or II
and 47 patients at stage III or IV.
In-situ hybridization

EBV was identified by the expression of EBV-encoded
small RNA (EBER). Briefly, in situ hybridization (ISH)
assay was performed on 3 μm paraffin-block sections
with EBV oligonucleotide probes complementary to the
EBER-1 and -2 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (PNA ISH detection kit, Dako Cytomation). The
hybridization signals were visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and positive nuclear signal was recognized
as dark brown nuclear staining under light microscopy.
As positive control, section from a known EBER-positive
NPC tissue was used. Staining was scored from 1 to 3
according to the percentage of stained cell nuclei in tissue sections. Score 3 was attributed when positive signal

was observed in more than 75%, score 2 in 75 to 50%
and score 1 in less than 50% of cells.
DNA extraction

DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin
embedded tissues. After tumor identification on hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides, tumoral areas were scraped
from 40 μm thick paraffin sections. The collected materials were de-waxed by washing in xylene and rinsed in
ethanol. Dried tissues were digested with proteinase K
in presence of SDS at 55°C overnight, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction as described previously [26].
The quantity of DNA was checked by spectrophotometer and stored at -20°C for further use.
PCR- RFLP and Sequencing

Five regions of the EBV genome were targeted for polymorphism analysis by PCR, RFLP or sequencing. The
polymorphisms studied encompass the A or B type in
the EBNA-3C gene, the C or D type in the BamHI-W1/
I1 region, the prototype F or f variant in the BamHI-F
region, the loss of an XhoI site in the first exon of
BNLF1gene (XhoI-loss variant) and the 30 bp deletion
in the third exon of the same gene (30 bp del-LMP1
variant). Genotyping was performed on DNA from GC
patients EBV-positive and as control, we analyze 10
DNA samples from nasopharyngeal mucosa positive
for EBV.
PCR amplification was performed on 200 ng DNA in
a final reaction mixture of 50 μl containing 0.2 μM of
each primer, 200 μM of dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1X PCR
buffer and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas).
The primer sequences and the size of PCR products are
shown in Table 1.
The C/D and F/f typing is based on the BamHI digestion
of each PCR product. The enzymatic reactions were carried
out in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl of PCR product, 1X digestion buffer and 10 units of BamHI enzyme
(Fermentas). After overnight incubation at 37°C, products
were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining, under UV illumination. The same
conditions described above were assessed to identify the
XhoI site in the first exon of BNLF1gene. DNA from B95.8
(GenBank accession No.V01555) and C666-1 cell line
(GenBank accession No. ABV54173) were used as control
for EBV types and variants. The C666-1 cell line derived
from a Chinese NPC that harbours A/C types, f variant,
XhoI-loss variant and 30 bp del-LMP1 variant.
DNA sequencing was performed on the purified PCR
products of the third exon of BNLF1 gene using the SV
gel Purification kit (Promega). Cycle sequencing was
performed using the ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. All sequences were

then compared with the EBV sequences of B95.8 (GenBank accession No.V01555), Chinese NPCs (Cao cells
[27], C666-1 cells (GenBank accession No. ABV54173)
and NPC10 biopsy [28] and Tunisian NPC specimens
(CV4, CV5, and CV6 [29]).
Real time quantitative PCR

Q-PCR assay targeting the BamHI-W region of the EBV
genome was performed on the 12 EBV-positive specimens
displaying nuclear staining and 6 EBV negative specimens.
Reactions were carried out on an iCycler iQ™ Real-time
PCR system (BioRad), using primers flanking the BamHIW region of the EBV genome and TaqMan probe as
described previously [30]. Aliquot of 1 μg DNA was used
for amplification in a total reaction volume of 25 μl containing 300 nM of each primer, 25 nM of TaqMan probe,
1X PCR buffer, 2mM MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP and
1 unit of GoTaq Hot Start polymerase (Promega). The
standard curve was prepared using serial 10-fold dilutions
of the recombinant plasmid pGEMT/BamHI-W. Samples
were run in duplicate and the results averaged to calculate
EBV viral load expressed in copies per reaction.
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 13.0 statistical software program for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). P-value of less than 0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.

Results
Prevalence of EBVaGC and association with clinicopathological characteristics

Eighty one specimens of GC were tested for EBV positivity using the EBER in situ hybridization. The

frequency of EBVaGC was 14.8% (12 of 81) in which
the EBER positive signal was restricted to the nuclei of
carcinoma cells (Figure 1). The EBVaGC specimens
have a variable percentage of stained tumor cells
showing more than 75% in six cases (score 3), between
50 and 75% in three cases and less than 50% in the
three remaining cases. The EBVaGC cases were associated with age at diagnosis (P = 0.009, Table 2). Indeed,
9 out of the 12 patients with EBVaGC were aged
between 45 to 60 years old. In addition, a trend toward
association was observed with tumor differentiation and
venous invasion as the statically significant value was
not reached (P = 0.07 and P = 0.09 respectively, Table
2).
Quantitative assessment of EBV in GC

Q-PCR assay was performed on 18 gastric carcinoma
specimens; among them 12 displayed EBER positivity
restricted to cells nuclei and 6 were negative.
The viral DNA copy number was estimated by the
absolute quantification method using serial dilution of
recombinant plasmid DNA (pGEMT/BamHI-W), as
external standard. Standard curve was established by
plotting the starting plasmid copy number against the
threshold cycle (Ct), showing a linear quantification
over a range from 106 to 10 copies per reaction.
Representative examples are shown on Figure 2 where
cases GC10 and GC3 (Ct = 15 and 22 respectively) display strong EBER nuclear staining whereas GC8 (Ct =
30) exhibits a weak EBER expression (Figure 2). The QPCR data is in concordance with EBER in situ hybridization result. Indeed, the 6 specimens with intense EBER
staining (score 3+), showed high EBV DNA copy number
whereas cases with weak EBER expression (score 1+) corresponded to low viral DNA copy (Table 3).

Genotyping of EBVaGC strains

To further investigate the EBVaGC in our 12 Tunisian
specimens, we have examined the genetic profile of EBV
strains determining different types and variants. A
unique profile in all studied specimens is observed (Figure 3). It was characterized by the A/D types, prototype
F, retention of XhoI restriction site and 30 bp del-LMP1

variant. We note that the A and B types shaping two
different EBV strains were found in one case of
EBVaGC specimens (Figure 3).
The EBV DNA analysis was also performed by partial
sequencing on the third exon of the BNLF1 gene encoding amino acids 328 to 376 of the LMP1 protein. In
order to confirm the 30 bp deletion encoding amino
acids 343 to 352 of the LMP1 protein, sequence alignment revealed seven amino-acids changes compared to
the reference strain B95.8. It was constantly found at
codons Q334R, L338S and S366A in all EBVaGC specimens. The remaining amino acids substitutions, however, were especially found in one or two EBVaGC
specimens: H358L and L359V (GC2), P360H (GC9-10)
and G365R (GC6). Regarding our previous data on
Tunisian NPC specimens, we found similar results
about the three constant amino-acids substitutions. In
addition, the EBV strains harbouring S366A substitution
appear more associated to Tunisian specimens when
compared to those defined in China (Figure 4).
In healthy EBV carriers, polymorphism analysis
showed also the A and D types, prototype F and XhoI
+ variant, as similar to identify in EBVaGC specimens (data not shown).

Discussion
In the present study, 81 cases of GC from patients of
the south region of Tunisia were investigated for the
presence of EBV and the prevalence of EBVaGC was
14.8% (12 out of 81). It was well known that the prevalence of EBVaGC varies widely from one geographical
region to another and the highest frequency was noted
in Germany (18%) whereas the lowest one (3.9%) was
detected in Peru [13-20,31].
The EBER in situ hybridization was the most reliable
method reported in the literature to detect latent EBV
in GC. In fact, all the above mentioned studies were
conducted following this method, including our study.
The variable proportions of nuclear tumor cells that
express EBER showing in our study were also deduced
by Truong et al., who suggest to be related with EBV
infection occurs in oncogenic process of EBVaGC [32].
However, further investigations must be conducted to
clarify this observation.
In addition, we showed that the heterogeneous data of
EBER expression could be correlated with the number
of EBV DNA copies as estimated by Q-PCR supporting
that this method is reliable as reported previously [33].
With regards to the clinico-pathological features of
EBVaGC, strong association with age at diagnosis was
observed (P = 0.009, Table 3). In fact, the EBVaGC was
more frequently found in the group of patients aged
between 45 and 60 years old, which is in line with previous studies [19,34]. No other statistical association was

found, except a tendency with tumor differentiation and
venous invasion (P = 0.075 and P = 0.09 respectively).
Previous reports have indicated that EBVaGC were
frequent in male, proximal stomach and tumors of
diffuse type [9,14,16,35-39].Recently, in a large metaanalyse, Carmago et al., confirms these associations
in addition to the age at diagnosis [38]. In our study,
we didn’t find difference in the distribution of EBV in
male compared to female patients, in proximal vs
distal stomach and in diffuse vs intestinal histotype.
These variations between data could be explained by
the contribution of local risk factors in the pathogenesis of EBV and also by the size and charasteristics of
the cohort.
Polymorphism analysis of the 12 EBVaGC cases show
exclusively the type D, prototype F, XhoI-retention and
the 30 bp del-LMP1 variant. Concerning the polymorphism of the EBNA-3C gene, we found the A type
in all EBVaGC cases and a combination of types A and
B was found in only one case. These findings are in
agreement with recent study conducted on four
EBVaGC cases from the central region of Tunisia [34].
The predominance of type A and prototype F was also
shown in previous reports independently to the geographic origin of EBVaGC as in southern China [35],
southern Japan [40], and Latin American countries [41].

BamHI-W1/I1 region. DNA fragments were digested with BamHI giving two bands of 139 and 67 bp (type D) for GC2 to GC6 (lane 2 to 6) or

fragment of 153 and 246 bp respectively. Case GC6 shows dual infection with both types A and B viruses. B95.8 is a type A virus that was used
as a control (lane 1). D: XhoI polymorphism in exon 1 of the BNLF1 gene. PCR product was digested by XhoI to yield two bands of 343 bp and
154 bp in XhoI+ variant for GC2 to GC6 (lane 2 to 6). C666-1 cell line is a positive of loss-XhoI variant (lane 1).

Interestingly, the variant-f was especially described in
NPC associated EBV strains of southern Asia [42]. In
this area, a predominance of C type and loss-XhoI variant was observed in patients with EBVaGC or NPC

[35,40], in contrast to our present finding and previous
data on Tunisian NPC patients [29,43].
To better define the genotype of EBVaGC strains
and compare them with those associated with the

NPC, we carried out the partial sequencing of exon 3
of the BNLF1 gene and compared them to the prototype B95-8 and others published sequences from Asian
and Tunisian NPC EBV strains [29,43]. The Q334R,
L338S and L338P were found in all our EBV isolates
and were already reported in EBV strains associated to
NPC originating from China or Tunisia [29,44]. However, the S366A is specific to EBV isolates associated
with Tunisian NPC and GC.. Indeed, and based on the
previous report of Edwards et al., [44]describing seven
phylogenetically distinct strains of LMP1, we can propose that Tunisian isolates constitute a supplementary group with a specific signature (T366A) but this
hypothesis needs confirmation by sequencing of the
entire BNLF1 gene in these isolates. According to this
date, we suggest that polymorphism in the BNLF1
gene constitute an additional argument in line with
the others EBV polymorphisms (D type, prototype F
and XhoI+) supporting the dissimilarity of EBV
strains between the two geographic regions.
On the other hand, we have described previously others
del-LMP1 variants (69 bp and 81 bp deletion spanning
codons 334-353 and 345-371, respectively) in Tunisian
NPC patients [29,43]. These variants were not found and
only the 30 bp del-LMP1 variant was identified in all
EBVaGC cases as already reported by Chen et al., in a
large study conducted on Chinese GC patients [35].
Our polymorphism analysis of EBV isolates in
healthy carriers revealed an identical genotype to
those of EBVaGC and NPC suggesting that common
strains are geographically distributed but not associated with a specific malignancy. In fact, the development of EBV associated malignancies could be
correlated to variation in potential immune recognition in distinct populations and individuals, as proposed by Edwards et al, [44].

Conclusion
The prevalence of EBVaGC in patients from southern
Tunisia is 14.8% which is in range with reported data.
The EBVaGC was predominantly found in the group of
patients aged from 45 to 60 years old and that EBV
DNA level reflect the EBER status in gastric carcinoma.
Furthermore, EBV strains associated to Tunisian
patients with GC or NPC share some similarities suggesting that probably the same EBV strain are associated
with both tumors. Altogether, our findings support the
different geographical distribution of EBV strains, but
not their restriction to an associated malignancy.
