hybridization among chinese hares (genus lepus)
revealed by analyses of multiple mitochondrial
and nuclear DNA loci

Abstract
Background: Interspecific hybridization may lead to the introgression of genes and genomes across species
barriers and contribute to a reticulate evolutionary pattern and thus taxonomic uncertainties. Since several previous
studies have demonstrated that introgressive hybridization has occurred among some species within Lepus,
therefore it is possible that introgressive hybridization events also occur among Chinese Lepus species and
contribute to the current taxonomic confusion.
Results: Data from four mtDNA genes, from 116 individuals, and one nuclear gene, from 119 individuals, provides
the first evidence of frequent introgression events via historical and recent interspecific hybridizations among six
Chinese Lepus species. Remarkably, the mtDNA of L. mandshuricus was completely replaced by mtDNA from L.
timidus and L. sinensis. Analysis of the nuclear DNA sequence revealed a high proportion of heterozygous
genotypes containing alleles from two divergent clades and that several haplotypes were shared among species,
suggesting repeated and recent introgression. Furthermore, results from the present analyses suggest that Chinese
hares belong to eight species.
Conclusion: This study provides a framework for understanding the patterns of speciation and the taxonomy of
this clade. The existence of morphological intermediates and atypical mitochondrial gene genealogies resulting
from frequent hybridization events likely contribute to the current taxonomic confusion of Chinese hares. The
present study also demonstrated that nuclear gene sequence could offer a powerful complementary data set with
mtDNA in tracing a complete evolutionary history of recently diverged species.

Background
The genus Lepus (the jackrabbit and hares; order Lagomorpha) is widespread in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North
and Central America. The number of Lepus species currently recognized ranges from 24 to 32 [1-4]. In China,
hares (Lepus) are distributed from the Qinghai-Tibetan
Plateau to near sea level, and from the mainland to the
island of Hainan. To date, the evolutionary history of Chinese hares (Lagomorpha: Lepus) is poorly defined, mainly
due to uncertain taxonomic classification [2,3,5-7].

Many taxonomic schemes based on morphology have
been proposed for Chinese hares and classifying them into
various numbers of species. The earliest studies divided
extant Chinese hares into seven species: L. capensis (Cape
hare), L. sinensis (Chinese hare), L. oiostolus (Woolly hare),
L. mandshuricus (Manchurian hare), L. timidus (Mountain
hare), L. yarkandensis (Yarkand hare) and L. hainanus
(Hainan hare) [8-12]. Subsequent analyses, incorporating a
large number of morphometric features (e.g., body measurements and skull characters) conducted by Luo [13],
assigned Chinese hares into nine species by adding 2 species: L. melainus (Manchurian black hare) and L. comus
(Yunnan hare). Several recent classifications, however,
have reignited the debate. Hoffmann & Smith [3] divided
L. capensis into two species: L. tibetanus and L. tolai, and

placed L. melainus into L. mandshuricus. Pan et al. [7]
also did not support the specific status of L. melainus, and
assigned L. tibetanus within L. tolai (corresponding to
L. capensis). Wu et al. [14], based on four mitochondrial
genes, also suggested that L. mandshuricus and L. melainus should be a single species, but rejected the specific status of L. capensis. Liu et al. [15], using skull characters and
nuclear gene sequences, supported the synonymy of
L. melainus and L. mandshuricus. Hence, taxonomic classifications within Chinese hares remain uncertain and
necessitate further analyses that include additional taxa
and discrete sequence data.
Hybridization among wild mammalian species may lead
to the introgression of genes and genomes across the species barrier yielding a reticulate evolutionary pattern (evolution characterized by genetic exchange among different
evolutionary lineages) among these species and thus taxonomic uncertainties. As reviewed by Nosil [16], speciation
with gene flow could be common; however, the impact of
hybridization on the speciation process in animals remains
poorly defined. Studies have revealed that introgressive
hybridization often leads to the complete replacement of
mtDNA on a regional scale [17-22] or even throughout a
species’ distribution [23]. Such replacements appear to be
more common than previously appreciated and can affect
the origin and adaptation of organisms [24].
If hybridization occurs between recently diverged species, then morphological intermediates between these
species may be produced thus contributing to the taxonomic confusion. Such a phenomenon seems to occur
within the genus Lepus. Several previous studies have
demonstrated that introgressive hybridization has
occurred among some species within Lepus. Thulin et al.
[25] and Thulin & Tegelström [26,27] demonstrated the
unidirectional introgression of L. timidus mtDNA into
L. europaeus that was introduced into Sweden during the
19th century. Morphological intermediates between the
two species, believed to be hybrids, have also been
observed since the introduction of L. europaeus [28]. In
addition, hybrids between L. timidus females and L. europaeus males are easily acquired in captivity [29] and the
F1 hybrids show intermediate characters [30]. Furthermore, Alves et al. [31] and Melo-Ferreira et al. [17,32]
described an ancient mtDNA introgression of L. timidus,
which is now extinct from Iberia, into L. granatensis and
L. europaeus in the Iberian Peninsula. A reverse direction
of mtDNA introgression from L. europaeus into L. timidus was also reported in the Alps by Zachos et al. [33]
and in Russia by Thulin et al. [34]. n ear gene sequenceszation and evolution.
In view of these findings, it is possible that introgressive
hybridization events may also occur between Chinese
Lepus species, most of which overlap geographically with
other species of this genus [3,7,13]. If introgression

Page 2 of 14

among Lepus species does indeed occur it may contribute
to the current taxonomic confusion of Chinese hares
[21,35].
The transfer of genes and genomes across the species
barrier can provide novel genetic material for natural selection to work upon and, thus, may change the evolutionary
direction of one or both of the intermixing taxa [36-46].
Previous studies, however, have revealed that there was a
lack of nuclear DNA introgression in hares from Iberia
and Sweden. Alves [47] used 14 autosomal protein loci to
assay the genetic variability in L. granatensis populations
from Iberia and detected no significant differentiation
between the populations with introgressed L. timidus
mtDNA and non-introgressed populations. Similar results
were also obtained from a microsatellite analysis [48,49].
Based on SNP analyses of 10 autosomal, two X-linked and
one Y-linked loci, Melo-Ferreira et al. [50] suggested that
autosomal introgression appeared to be mostly sporadic or
undetectable and that sex-chromosome introgression was
completely absent in hare species of Iberia. Alves et al. [51]
and Roca et al. [52] attributed the lack of nuclear introgression to recurrent crossing of hybrid females with males
of the invading species, coupled with male hybrid sterility
or inviability (Haldane’s rule). This pattern of crossing
could eventually lead to the replacement of one nuclear
genome within a few generations. This inference was also
supported by the results of Thulin et al. [53]. By analyzing
microsatellites, Thulin et al. [53] detected a small number
of specimens with genotypes consistent with those of F1
hybrids in Sweden. From this observation it was hypothesized that the transferred nuclear genes from L. timidus
had disappeared from the L. europaeus populations during
the 50 generations since the introduction and initial hybridization. In view of these reports, if introgression among
Chinese Lepus species does indeed occur, what then is the
genomic legacy of the introgressed nuclear genes and genomes? At one extreme, they may disappear over subsequent generations. At the other extreme, some hybrid
genotypes in the Chinese populations may actually possess
elevated fitnesses thus leading to continued introgression
and the possibility of the fixation of introgressed nuclear
DNA, and eventually to the formation of novel hybrid
lineages (i.e. hybrid species).
In the present study, four mtDNA genes and one
nuclear DNA locus from 124 Chinese hare individuals
collected at 54 localities in China were analyzed in order
to test for the possibility of introgressive hybridization
and to help clarify the taxonomy of Chinese hares.

and control region (D-loop; 589 bp), were obtained successfully from 116 Chinese hare individuals, with eight
museum skin samples failing to yield full-length
sequences due to the poor quality of the isolated DNA.
The mtDNA genes appear to be of mitochondrial origin,
rather than nuclear copies of mtDNA-like pseudogenes,
as indicated by the fact that the amino acid sequences
of the Cyt b, COX I and ND4 genes did not possess
premature stop codons or frameshifting insertions/deletions. In addition, the phylogenetic analyses based on
separate mtDNA fragments were generally concordant
(data not shown).
The sequence characteristics of the four mtDNA fragments and one nuclear gene, Stem cell factor (MGF),
are summarized in Table 1. As seen from Table 1,
a total of 201 sequences from 119 samples with a
length of 593 base pairs were aligned at the MGF locus.
Full-length sequences could not be obtained from five
museum skin samples. A total of 72 haplotypes were
defined from the 58 polymorphic sites, 44 of which
were potentially phylogenetically informative.
Phylogenetic inference from MtDNA

The best fitting model for the Bayesian analysis using the
combined mtDNA data was “GTR+I+G” with the following parameter settings: Base = (0.2968, 0.2771, 0.1192,
0.3069), Nst = 6, Rmat = (3.2812, 75.0100, 6.1253, 2.5585,
57.7249, 1.0000), Rates = gamma Shape = 1.0115, and
Pinvar = 0.5638. Neighbour-joining (NJ) and Bayesian
analyses of the combined mtDNA dataset yielded identical tree topologies (Figure. 1). The Chinese Lepus species
included eight lineages and were grouped into five major
clades. Sequence divergence (uncorrected pairwise distance; p-distance) among the eight mtDNA lineages
based on the separate mtDNA fragments are presented
in Additional file 1 (2.2-8.5% in Cyt b, 2.6-8.6% in COX I,
3.2-11.1% in ND4 and 5.9-15.3% in the control region).
As seen from Figure 1, L. hainanus branched first, followed by the sister-grouping of L. comus and L. oiostolus.
In another portion of the phylogeny, L. sinensis was most
basal, L. timidus and L. capensis are closely related, and

L. yarkandensis and a portion of the L. capensis individuals, which are defined here as L. capensis-2, grouped
together. The support for the monophyly of these eight
lineages was 1.00 for Bayesian posterior probability (PP)
and 93%-100% for NJ bootstrap sampling (BS). Support
for relationships among the five clades was 0.98-1.00 for
PP and 59%-93% for BS.
As illustrated in Figure 1, sequences from L. hainanus,
L. comus, L. oiostolus, L. sinensis and L. yarkandensis
showed species-specific monophyly;. however, this was
not the case for L. capensis, L. timidus and L. mandshuricus. The sequences of L. capensis were mainly
divided into two lineages. Besides the lineage that
included the majority of L. capensis sequences, five
sequences of L. capensis from Xinjiang Province of
China formed a separate mtDNA clade (L.capensis-2)
(1.00 for PP, 100% for BS), which was a sister clade to
L. yarkandensis. In addition, another eight sequences of
L. capensis were placed within two other lineages: three
(CA14, CA15 and CA35) in a L. timidus lineage (1.00
for PP, 93% for BS), and five (CA9, CA11-CA13 and
CA36) in a L. sinensis lineage (1.00 for PP, 100% for
BS). Similarly, the sequences of L. timidus were also
divided into two lineages: one included the majority of
the L. timidus sequences, and the other included two
sequences of L. timidus (T10 and T11) from Inner
Mongolia Province of China that grouped within the
L. sinensis lineage. Remarkably, we found that among
the fourteen L. mandshuricus sequences, nine were
placed within the L. timidus lineage and the remaining
five grouped within the L. sinensis lineage.
Phylogenetic inference from nuclear gene

The recombination test with the nuclear gene MGF
gene data failed to detect any signal for recombination.
The NJ tree for the nuclear gene MGF, based on the
analyses of 72 haplotypes from the 119 individuals, is
presented in Figure 2. The Bayesian inference (BI) analysis yielded a result similar to that of the NJ analysis.
The MGF gene tree in Figure 2 divided the Chinese
Lepus species into six lineages (L. hainanus, L. comus,

L. oiostolus, L. yarkandensis, L. timidus and L. mandshuricus) and two complexes (Group A and Group B).
The haplotypes from L. hainanus, L. comus, L. oiostolus,
L. yarkandensis, L. timidus and L. mandshuricus formed
their own species-specific clades. Exceptions to this phylogenetic signal were one L. capensis haplotype (Hap31)
that was included within the L. oiostolus clade, one
L. mandshuricus haplotype (Hap38) that was included
within the L. timidus clade, one L. capensis-2 haplotype
(Hap14) that fell within the L. yarkandensis clade and
one L. yarkandensis haplotype (Hap13) that was shared
with L. capensis-2.
The majority of the L. sinensis and L. capeneis haplotypes were admixed and fell within either Group A or

Group B (Figure 2). Group A includes 14 haplotypes, of
which five were from L. capensis, three (Hap6, 17, 19)
were from L. capensis-2, and Hap 4, 5, 7 were from
L. yarkandensis, L. sinensis and L. timidus, respectively.
For the three remaining haplotypes, Hap15 and Hap21
were shared by L. capensis, L. capensis-2 and L. timidus,
and Hap3 was shared by L. capensis and L. sinensis. Fourteen of the 19 haplotypes in Group B were from L. capensis. In addition, one L. timidus haplotype (Hap65), two
L. sinensis haplotypes (Hap62, 63) and two haplotypes
(Hap49, 53) shared between L. sinensis and L. capeneis
were also grouped into Group B. One L. yarkandensis
haplotype (Hap 4) was grouped into Group A and Hap13
was shared between L. capensis-2 and L. yarkandensis,

Liu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:223
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/223

suggesting a recent hybridization event between L. yarkandensis and a lineage in Group A. The disjunct geographical distributions of L. yarkandensis and L. sinensis
(Figure 3) led to the definition of Group A as the
“L. capensis group” and Group B as the “L. sinensis
group” (Figure 2).
Conflicts between the mitochondrial and nuclear gene
trees

Three major differences were demonstrated between the
mtDNA and nuclear gene trees: (i) no species-specific
mtDNA lineage was identified for L. mandshuricus. All
the mtDNA sequences of L. mandshuricus were identified
as belonging to either L. timidus or L. sinensis; however,
almost all of the MGF sequences from L. mandshuricus
clustered together within a single clade; (ii) a new monophyletic lineage, L. capensis-2, was identified in the

Page 6 of 14

mtDNA analysis, but the MGF haplotypes of L. capensis-2
were divided into two portions (the L. yarkandensis clade
and the L. capensis group); and (iii) the mtDNA analysis
suggested that the introgression among Chinese Lepus
species was likely unidirectional, while, in contrast, the
MGF data indicated the occurrence of bidirectional introgression among these species. For example, from the
mtDNA analysis, four L. capensis sequences were grouped
with L. sinensis, suggesting the unidirectional introgression
of mtDNA from L. sinensis into L. capensis; however, the
MGF tree identified one haplotype (Hap3) which was
nested in the L. capensis group and two haplotypes
(Hap49, 53) which were nested in the L. sinensis group
as sharing haplotypes between L. capensis and L. sinensis,
consistent with the predicted pattern for bidirectional
introgression. In addition, the fact that nine L. capensis
and two L. sinensis individuals were identified as

heterozygotes at the MGF locus, with alleles belonging to
the L. capensis and L. sinensis groups, further supports the
hypothesis of bidirectional introgression (Additional
file 2). Details about the discrepancy between the mitochondrial and nuclear genes are summarized in Additional
file 2.
Dating the Divergence Times

The Bayesian tree used for divergence time estimation is
presented in Additional file 3. In contrast to the mtDNA
tree shown in Figure 1, the mtDNA tree in Additional
file 3 included only representative sequences from each
major lineage, and excluded sequences that demonstrated
only a few base pair differences. The speciation time of
Chinese hares was estimated at 3.116 MYA (± 0.731
MYA, Additional file 3). The estimated times of introgressive hybridization events are presented in Figure 1.

Discussion
Introgressive hybridization among Chinese Lepus species

As seen from the analyses of mtDNA and nuclear DNA
sequences of Chinese hares, most of the phylogenetic conflicts between the mtDNA and nuclear DNA gene trees
suggest multiple episodes of introgression. Alternatively,
incomplete lineage sorting of the nuclear gene may also
result in the observed “mixing” of the nuclear gene haplotypes; however, most of the samples with the discrepancy
between the mitochondrial and nuclear genotypes have
congruence between their morphology and nuclear genotype except for some L. capensis and L. sinensis individuals
(Additional file 2). Although some of the L. capensis and
L. sinensis individuals have incongruence between their
morphology and nuclear genotype, the “L. capensis group”
and the “L. sinensis group” is divergent enough to distinguish each other (Figure 2), therefore, the nuclear MGF
gene is informative enough to distinguish Chinese hare
species and the observed “mixing” of nuclear gene haplotypes likely is due to introgressive hybridization rather
than incomplete lineage sorting. In addition, the observation that a large number of the heterozygous genotypes
have alleles from divergent clades (Additional file 2) is also
inconsistent with the alternative hypothesis of incomplete
lineage sorting. The evidence suggests that introgression
has occurred between seven pairs of the hare species
examined here.
L. sinensis × L. capensis, L. sinensis (♀) × L. mandshuricus
(♂), L. sinensis × L. timidus

Five L. capensis individuals (CA9, CA11- CA13 and
CA36) were placed within the L. sinensis lineage on the
mtDNA tree (Figure 1). These results likely reflect
recent introgression of L. sinensis mtDNA into L. capensis; however, results from the nuclear gene analysis suggested bidirectional and recent introgression between

Page 7 of 14

these species, as evidenced by the observation that the
MGF haplotypes from L. capensis and L. sinensis were
admixed and fell within two distantly related groups.
Furthermore, one haplotype (Hap3) that nested in the
L. capensis group and two haplotypes (Hap49, 53) that
nested in the L. sinensis group were shared between
L. capensis and L. sinensis (Figure 2). In addition, ten
L. capensis individuals (CA1, CA2, CA10, CA17-CA19,
CA21, CA22, CA29 and CA31) and two L. sinensis individuals (S2 and S3) were identified as heterozygotes at
the MGF locus for two alleles from L. capensis and
L. sinensis (Additional file 2). The available data, however, cannot eliminate the possibility that some of the
heterozygotes were produced by ancient hybridization
events.
Five individuals (M8, M10, M12, M13 and M18) of
L. mandshuricus were grouped into the L. sinensis lineage
on the mtDNA tree (Figure 1), while their MGF haplotypes fell within the L. mandshuricus clade (Figure 2).
This can be explained by a unidirectional mtDNA introgression from L. sinensis into L. mandshuricus. In addition, two individuals of L. mandshuricus (M10 and M12)
have low sequence divergence relative to the L. sinensis
individuals, thus supporting a recent age for the hybridization events. The divergence time estimation indicated
that the remaining three L. mandshuricus individuals
(M8, M13 and MA18) shared a most recent ancestor
with the L. sinensis samples at ca. 0.414 MYA (± 0.133
MYA) (Figure 1). This would suggest that the mitochondrial genome of L. sinensis introgressed into L. mandshuricus no later than 0.414MYA. Our estimate of the
time of introgression may be biased somewhat if additional extant lineages were not sampled, or if there have
been extinction events. Indeed, such a bias has been
inferred in the case of Lepidiolamprologus [54]. However,
in the present study three ancient hybridization events,
involving five species (Figure 1; also see below), were
detected. This strongly supports the hypothesis of ancient
hybridization and not solely recent introgression events.
Two individuals of L. timidus, T10 and T11, nested
within the L. sinensis clade on the mtDNA tree (Figure 1),
while their MGF haplotypes grouped within the L. timidus
clade (Figure 2), once again suggesting mtDNA introgression (in this case, from L. sinensis into L. timidus). In addition, the detection of one L. timidus haplotype (Hap65)
within the L. sinensis group on the MGF gene tree (Figure
2) was consistent with the occurrence of nuclear
DNA introgression from L. timidus into L. sinensis. Taken
together, the mtDNA and nuclear DNA analyses supported
reciprocal introgression between L. timidus and L. sinensis.
An alternative explanation would be that the introgressive
hybridization of L. sinensis × L. capensis, L. sinensis (♀) × L.
mandshuricus (♂), and L. sinensis (♀) ×L. timidus (♂)
resulted from an initial hybridization between L. sinensis

Liu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:223
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/223

and L. capensis, L. mandshuricus or L. timidus, followed by
a second hybridization among L. capensis, L. mandshuricus
and L. timidus. Supporting this latter hypothesis was the
inference of hybridization between L. timidus and L. mandshuricus as well as L. timidus and L. capensis (see below).
L. timidus (♀) × L. mandshuricus (♂), L. timidus (♀) ×
L. capensis (♂)

Alves et al. [51] suggested that mtDNA introgression
from L. timidus might occur in several other regions in
addition to Iberia and our results confirm this hypothesis.
In the L. timidus mtDNA lineage, nine L. mandshuricus
individuals (M1-M4, M7, M9, M11, M14 and M19) and
three L. capensis individuals (CA14, CA15 and CA35)
were included (Figure 1). The MGF haplotypes of the
nine L. mandshuricus individuals were grouped with the
other L. mandshuricus haplotypes except for Hap38,
which is nested within the L. timidus clade. The nuclear
sequences of the three L. capensis individuals were placed
in either the L. capensis group (CA15) or the L. sinensis
group (CA35) (Additional file 2). In addition, one L. timidus haplotype (Hap7) was placed into the L. capensis
group and two haplotypes (Hap15 and Hap21) were
shared with L. capensis on the MGF gene tree (Figure 2).
Our results thus suggest that the L. mandshuricus and
L. capensis individuals likely reflect the capture of L. timidus mitochondrial genomes via several hybridization
events between females of L. timidus and males of
L. mandshuricus or L. capensis. Furthermore, the nuclear
DNA analysis indicated that the hybridization events
between L. timidus and L. mandshuricus or L. capensis
were recent and a second hybridization event likely
occurred between L. capensis and L. sinensis as well. An
additional nine Cyt b sequences of L. mandshuricus
accessed from Genbank (accession numbers: AY650894AY650899, AJ279423, DQ793162, DQ793163) were also
grouped into the L. timidus lineage on our Cyt b tree
(data not show), further supporting the inference of
mtDNA introgression from L. timidus into L. mandshuricus. Finally, one L. timidus Cyt b sequence (accession
number: AY745108) collected from GenBank was
grouped within the L. capensis lineage in the Cyt b phylogeny (data not show), suggesting the introgression of
mtDNA from L. capensis into L. timidus. The L. capensis
individual, CA35, shared a most recent common ancestor
with L. timidus samples at 0.976 MYA (± 0.284 MYA)
(Figure 1), indicating that the hybridization between
L. timidus and L. capensis took place at about this point
in time.
L. yarkandensis (♀) × L. capensis(♂), L. capensis ×
L. oiostolus

Several observations suggest the role of recent hybridization between L. capensis and L. yarkandensis. These

Page 8 of 14

observations include: one MGF haplotype (Hap4) of
L. yarkandensis nested within the L. capensis group; one
MGF haplotype (Hap13) of L. yarkandensis shared with
L. capensis-2 (Figure 2); and two MGF alleles of four
L. yarkandensis individuals (Y7, Y10, Y14, Y15) were
grouped into either the L. yarkandensis and L. capensis
groups (Additional file 2).
The newly identified L. capensis-2 lineage might have
originated through ancient hybridization between female
L. yarkandensis and male L. capensis at ca 0.988 MYA
(± 0.285 MYA) (Figure 1; also see below). Interestingly,
one L. capensis haplotype (Hap31) was grouped into the
L. oiostolus clade (Figure 2). This may reflect a recent
hybridization event between L. capensis and L. oiostolus.
In addition, hybridization between L. oiostolus and
L. capensis was also evidenced by the fact that one L. oiostolus Cyt b sequence (accession number: AJ279427) from
GenBank was nested within the L. capensis lineage (data
not shown).
The possible forces driving the introgressive hybridization
among Chinese Lepus species

Compared with introgression reported previously for
other species complexes [18,21-23,54,55], especially
within other Lepus species [17,25-27,31,32,50], Chinese
hares demonstrated a previously unreported level of
complexity. First, most of the previous studies within
the genus Lepus reported only the presence of mtDNA
introgression of L. timidus, in which unidirectional
mtDNA introgression events from L. timidus into populations of L. europaeus in Sweden [25-27] and into
L. granatensis and L. europaeus in Iberian Peninsula
[17,31,32] were inferred, with the identification of
nuclear introgression lacking or infrequent [48,50,53].
Similar scenarios have also been posited for several
other species clades [18,22,23,54-56]. Second, although
contemporaneous introgression has been reported for
several non-hare species [21,57,58], most of these cases
of introgression involve at the most two or three species. In comparison, the present study demonstrated
that introgression among Chinese Lepus species has
most likely been a continuous and recent process involving multiple waves of hybridization among six species.
Our results also suggest that introgression has
occurred in multiple directions, involving both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. The mtDNA of L. mandshuricus was replaced entirely by that of L. timidus and
L. sinensis. Although several previous studies have provided convincing evidence for complete local or even
range-wide replacement of mtDNA following hybridization in insects, fishes and reptilia [18,23,55,59], such
observations are infrequent for mammals. The hybridization events among Chinese hares are possibly driven
by species abundance asymmetries, mating preferences,

Liu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:223
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/223

range expansion and low divergence between Lepus
species.
In the studies of Thulin & Tegelström [27], Hubbs [60]
and Wirtz [61], they suggested that the females of a rare
species (e.g. L. timidus) would generally hybridize with
the males of a common species (e.g. L. europaeus). In the
present study, the hybridization between females of
L. timidus (rare species) and males of L. capensis (common species), and between females of L. timidus (rare
species) and males of L. mandshuricus (common species)
are congruent with their conclusion. However, the hybridization between females of L. sinensis (common species)
and males of L. capensis (common species) is inconsistent with this hypothesis. In addition, Thulin & Tegelström [27] and Grant & Grant [62] indicated that
unidirectional hybridization would usually occur between
the females of smaller species (e.g. L. timidus) and the
males of larger-bodied species (e.g. L. europaeus). Among
Chinese hares, hybridization between females of L. sinensis (smaller species) and males of L. capensis (larger species), L. timidus (larger species) or L. mandshuricus
(larger species) support this hypothesis. In contrast, the
hybridizations between female L. timidus (larger species)
and male L. capensis (smaller species) or L. mandshuricus
(smaller species) are inconsistent with this hypothesis.
Species abundance and body size, though, might have
been different in ancestral populations. The present
study indicates that at least some of the hybridization
events are recent, therefore, the forces driving the hybridization among Chinese Lepus species may include species abundance asymmetries and mating preferences.
The hybridizations among Chinese Lepus species might
be a consequence of range expansion caused by the Pleistocene glaciations. Melo-Ferreira et al. [32] estimated the
timing of mtDNA introgression from L. timidus into
L. granatensis in Iberia at 33 000-35 000 years and suggested that it might have been favored by the climatic fluctuation during the Pleistocene glacial phenomena. Our
latest study also strongly indicates that one of the Chinese
Lepus species (Lepus yarkandensis) has undergone
repeated population reductions and expansions during the
Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods, respectively
[63]. These population size fluctuations may have contributed to the extensive gene flow among Lepus yarkandensis
populations. Similarly, the alternation of glacial and interglacial periods during the Pleistocene likely contributed to
the conditions necessary for of the overlapping ranges of
different Chinese hare species, resulting in the observed
introgressive hybridization. Morgan et al. [59] and MeloFerreira et al. [32] drew similar inferences for both mosquitoes in Southeast Asia and European hares, respectively. Further support for the effect of glaciation comes
from the estimation of some of the introgression events

Page 9 of 14

among the Chinese hare lineages as occurring during the
Pleistocene (i.e. 0.414-0.988 MYA). Simulation studies
have also suggested that range expansions could lead to
asymmetric introgression from the resident species toward
the invading species [64-66].
In addition to the above factors, the widespread and
complex patterns of reticulate evolutionary events among
the Chinese Lepus lineages may also reflect the generally
low levels of interspecific genetic differentiation. Previous
studies have suggested that Lepus experienced rapid radiation [67,68]. The lack of chromosomal structural changes
supports such a model of relatively recent, and rapid,
diversification in this clade [69,70]. Low levels of genetic
diversification between species could result in relatively
fertile F1 hybrids providing a bridge for further hybridization and thus introgression. Alternatively, low levels of
genetic diversification between species may indicate that
speciation processes of some Chinese Lepus species are
not complete and there have been continuous gene flow
among them. For example, the admixture of MGF gene
between L. sinensis and L. capensis could be the consequence of an incomplete reproductive isolation between
the two species. Further definition of the introgressive system characterizing Chinese Lepus species should provide a
clearer resolution of the evolutionary factors that have
resulted in this reticulate complex.
Taxonomic classification of Chinese hares

Based on the mtDNA and nuclear gene sequence analyses,
the present study not only suggests that introgressive
hybridization among Chinese Lepus species contributed to
the current taxonomic confusion, but also provides
insights into the previously obscure taxonomic classification of Chinese hares. Our mtDNA and nuclear DNA analyses supported the specific status of eight hare species,
including L. hainanus, L. comus, L. oiostolus, L. yarkandensis, L. timidus, L. mandshuricus, L. capensis and L. sinensis.
This finding is consistent with the morphological taxonomy of Pan et al. [7]. The division of L. capensis into two
species (L. tibetanus and L. tolai), as suggested by Hoffmann & Smith [3], was not favored in the present study.
In the mtDNA analysis of L. mandshuricus, nine specimens were found to harbor L. timidus mtDNA haplotypes
and three specimens contained L. sinensis mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting the absence of a diagnostic L. mandshuricus mtDNA lineage (Figure 1); however, the nuclear gene
(MGF) analysis supported the monophyly of L. mandshuricus, which is consistent with its specific status (Figure 2).
Furthermore, Liu et al. [15], using skull characters and
nuclear gene sequences, also supported the specific status
of L. mandshuricus, therefore, the discrepancy between
the mtDNA and nuclear gene trees is most likely due to
mtDNA introgression from L. timidus and L. sinensis into

Liu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:223
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/223

L. mandshuricus. This finding reflects the importance of
including nuclear markers for systematic studies of hares
[71-73].
On the mtDNA tree, L. capensis and L. timidus formed
sister taxa and have the lowest Cyt b sequence divergence
(2.2%) among the species analyzed in this study (Figure 1,
Additional file 1). The Cyt b sequence divergence of 7.6%
between L. capensis and L. sinensis (Additional file 1), and
the presence of L. capensis group and L. sinensis group on
nuclear gene tree (Figure 2) supported the specific status
of L. capensis and L. sinensis. As we discussed above, our
analyses led to the inference that L. timidus and L. sinensis
mitochondrial genomes had introgressed into L. capensis
and that frequent nuclear DNA introgression had
occurred between L. capensis and L. sinensis. These observations are inconsistent with those of Wu et al. [14], who
concluded that L. capensis either does not exist in China
as a unique taxon or has been replaced by L. timidus. In
contrast, our data suggest the occurrence of continuous
introgression from L. timidus into L. capensis.
In the present study, our mtDNA tree identified a new
mtDNA lineage that might represent a previously unidentified hare species from Xinjiang Province. This is evidenced by the fact that the newly identified mtDNA
lineage (L. capensis-2) was closely related to L. yarkandensis on the mtDNA tree (Figure 1) and the Cyt b sequence
divergence (2.5%) between L. capensis-2 and L. yarkandensis is higher than that (2.2%) found between L. capensis
and L. timidus (Additional file 1). This finding is consistent with the inference of Wu et al. [14] that there might
be two or more new hare species in this area of China;
however, the MGF haplotypes of the L. capensis-2 samples
were divided into two different groups: (i) two (Hap13 and
Hap 14) were nested in the L. yarkandensis clade, with
one (Hap13) shared with L. yarkandensis; (ii) five (Hap6,
15, 17, 19, 21) fell into the L. capensis group, with two
(Hap15 and Hap21) shared with L. capensis (Figure 2). In
addition, the individuals of L. capensis-2 and L. capensis
have no significant morphological differences, therefore,
the alternative hypothesis, that this newly identified
mtDNA lineage may reflect ancient mtDNA introgression
from L. yarkandensis into L. capensis, seems more likely.

Conclusions
This study has revealed the first evidence of complex,
ancient and recent introgressive hybridization among Chinese Lepus species thus providing a framework for understanding the patterns of speciation and the taxonomy of
this clade. Frequent introgressive hybridization involving
L. timidus L. oiostolus, L. sinensis, L. yarkandensis,
L. capensis and L. mandshuricus were detected. Both unidirectional mtDNA introgression and bidirectional nuclear
DNA introgression were inferred. In contrast to the

Page 10 of 14

previously reported introgression events within the genus
Lepus, some of the mtDNA introgression events among
Chinese Lepus species were estimated to be relatively
ancient. We hypothesized that asymmetries in species
abundance, mating preferences, range expansion and low
levels of genetic divergence between Lepus species may
have been causal for this reticulate evolutionary process.
The existence of morphological intermediates and atypical
mtDNA genealogies resulting from this reticulation might
have contributed to the current taxonomic confusion
among Chinese Lepus species. Our analyses supported the
classification of Chinese Lepus into eight species. The present study also demonstrated that nuclear DNA could
offer a powerful complement to the use of mtDNA genes
for tracing the evolutionary history of recently diverged
species. Future studies incorporating broader taxonomic
sampling and unlinked genetic markers should provide
additional resolution of the reticulate evolutionary patterns
and systematic relationships among Chinese hares.

Methods
Specimen collection

To avoid the impact of seasonal effect on the pelage
color variations, a total of 124 Chinese hares were collected in winter from 54 localities in China (Additional
file 4 and Figure 3). The taxonomic status of some Chinese hare species reflects a longstanding debate
[2,3,5-7]. We adopted mainly the classification scheme
of Luo [13] for this study, but assigned L. melainus into
L. mandshuricus, therefore, there are eight putative Chinese Lepus species in our samples. As described by Luo
[13], L. capensis and L. sinensis have significant differentiation in tail length; L. capensis has the longest tail
length (80-125 mm) among Chinese Lepus species while
L. sinensis has the shortest (30-60 mm). The winter
pelage of L. mandshuricus samples examined here was
entirely black, except for the ventral surfaces; this is a
unique character for L. mandshuricus. In contrast, only
L. timidus has a white winter pelage making the identification of animals belonging to this species similarly
straightforward. L. yarkandensis has a smaller body size
than L. capensis as evidenced by their average body
weight (L. yarkandensis: 1635 g; L. capensis: 1987 g). In
addition, a large, black speckle on the dorsal surface of
the tail allows the identification of L. capensis individuals. All of the samples examined in the present analysis were collected from their typical distributional areas
(Figure 3), further supporting the assignment of samples
to various species. Samples with unavailable or uncertain
morphological information were excluded from the present study. All collection was performed following animal use protocols approved by the Kunming Institute of
Zoology Animal Care Committee.

DNA extraction and PCR amplification

Total genomic DNA was extracted using a modified
phenol/chloroform method [74,75]. For hair and skin specimens, total genomic DNA was extracted with the Chelex100 method [75-77]. We designed hare-specific primers
from the published sequences of lagomorph species, and
those that we sequenced to amplify four mtDNA fragments
(Cyt b, COX I, ND4 and D-loop) from 124 individuals
(Additional file 5). Due to its better phylogenetic performance demonstrated in the Leporidae study of Matthee
et al. [78], one nuclear DNA fragment (MGF) was also
amplified from 124 individuals using primers from Matthee
et al. [78,79]. The primers are situated in the MGF exon
regions, and the faster evolving intron sequence was amplified. Interestingly, high proportion of heterozygotes was
found at the MGF locus.
Amplified PCR products were purified and sequenced in
both directions with an ABI PRISM 3730 DNA sequencer.
Homology of the acquired sequences was assessed by
BLAST searching [80] of GenBank. Direct sequencing of
the PCR products from the nuclear gene allowed the identification of heterozygous genotypes. Products from heterozygous individuals were cloned into the PMD18-T
vector (Takara, China) and transformed into an ultracompetent E.coli cell line (Takara, China). Six clones per ligation reaction were sequenced in both directions to identify
the heterozygous positions. Since the same DNA samples
were used to amplify both the mtDNA and nuclear gene
fragments, and the sequencing of mtDNA fragments did
have any signal of admixture, thus we could rule out contamination as a cause of the heterozygosity at the nuclear
locus. The mtDNA and nuclear gene sequences obtained
in the present study have been deposited into GenBank
with the following accession numbers: ND4 (HM232860 HM232975); Cyt b (HM232976 - HM233091); COX I
(HM233092 - HM233207); D-loop (HM233208 HM233323) and MGF (HM233559 - HM233732).
Sequence data analysis

Sequences were aligned using Clustal X1.81 [81] and
refined by visual inspection. Prior to phylogenetic analysis
of nuclear sequence recombination tests were conducted
by using Sawyer’s method [82] with the program GENECONV [83]. The default parameters were used except that
the mismatch penalties varied from small (gscale = 1) to
infinite (gscale = 0).
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the NJ
method in MEGA 4 [84] and BI method as implemented
in MrBayes v3.0b4 [85] for the separate and combined
mtDNA datasets and the nuclear DNA dataset. In the NJ
analysis, gaps or missing data were excluded. Nodal supports were assessed using BS with 1000 replicates. The
evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method. Prior to BI analysis,

Page 11 of 14

the program Modeltest 3.7 was used to identify the optimal model of DNA substitution [86]. The best-fit model
was selected according to the Akaike information criterion
(AIC) [87]. Bayesian analysis began with random starting
trees and ran for 5 × 106 generations, with the Markov
chains sampled every 100 generations. We checked the
average standard deviation of split frequencies for parameter convergence in the BI analysis. In our BI analysis,
the average standard deviation of split frequencies was
close to 0.007 when the run ended. The first 1.25 × 106
generations were excluded as burn-in. The analysis was
conducted twice to ensure that the Bayesian analyses were
not trapped in local optima [88,89]. The remaining trees
from both analyses were used to create a majority rule
consensus tree where the percent of samples recovering
the same clade represented the PP value of that clade.
Molecular clock test and divergence time estimation

The hypothesis of a molecular clock was examined for
the combined mtDNA data set using the relative-rate
test [90] with the program PHYLTEST [91]. Rate constancy was rejected at the 5% level, so we employed the
relaxed Bayesian methods to estimate divergence times
[92,93]. First, in the PAMLv3.14 package [94], we used
BASEML to create the maximum likelihood output files
needed for the MULTIDIVERGENCE package developed by Thorne et al. [92] and Kishino et al. [95]. Next,
we used PAML2MODELINF to write “model files”
needed to estimate the variance-covariance matrix for
the four mtDNA fragments independently. The variance-covariance matrix estimation was performed using
ESTBRANCHES. Finally, the output files from ESTBRANCHES were employed in MULTIDIVTIME to
estimate the prior and posterior distributions of the
divergence dates. Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses
involved an initial burn-in (250,000 cycles), after which
the Markov chain was sampled every 100th cycle a total
of 20,000 times. Multiple independent runs were performed for the same data and prior distributions, but
with different starting points to ensure stationarity. Two
calibration points were used for estimating divergence
time: (i) a literature-based divergence time between
L. comus and L. oiostolus (1.83 ± 0.669MYA) [14]; (ii)
the earliest fossil record of L. timidus collected from the
Middle Pleistocene (0.75MYA) [96,97].
