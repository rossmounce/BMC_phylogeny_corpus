Validation of reference genes for quantitative
RT-qPCR studies of gene expression in Atlantic
cod (Gadus morhua l.) during temperature stress
Ingrid A Aursnes1, Anne L Rishovd1, Hans E Karlsen2 and Tor Gjøen1*

Abstract
Background: One important physiological response to environmental stress in animals is change in gene
expression. To obtain reliable data from gene expression studies using RT-qPCR it is important to evaluate a set of
possible reference genes as normalizers for expression. The expression of these candidate genes should be
analyzed in the relevant tissues during normal and stressed situations. To find suitable reference genes it was
crucial that the genes were stably expressed also during a situation of physiological stress. For poikilotermic
animals like cod, changes in temperature are normal, but if the changes are faster than physiological
compensation, the animals respond with typical stress responses. It has previously been shown that Atlantic cod
show stress responses when elevation of water temperature is faster than 1 degree/day, for this reason we chose
hyperthermia as stress agent for this experiment.
Findings: We here describe the expression of eight candidate reference genes from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua l.)
and their stability during thermal stress (temperature elevation of one degree C/day for 5 days). The genes
investigated were: Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha, ef1a; 18s ribosomal RNA; 18s, Ubiquitin conjugate protein;
ubiq, cytoskeletal beta-actin; actb, major histcompatibility complex I; MHC-I light chain, beta-2 -microglobulin; b2m,
cytoskeletal alpha-tubulin; tba1c, acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein; rplp1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
g6pd. Their expression were analyzed in 6 tissues (liver, head kidney, intestine, spleen, heart and gills) from cods
exposed to elevated temperature and compared to a control group. Although there were variations between
tissues with respect to reference gene stability, four transcripts were more consistent than the others: ubiq, ef1a,
18s and rplp1. We therefore used these to analyze the expression of stress related genes (heat shock proteins)
induced during hyperthermia. We found that both transcripts were significantly upregulated in several tissues in
fish exposed to increased temperature.
Conclusion: This is the first study comparing reference genes for RT-qPCR analyses of expression during
hyperthermia in Atlantic cod. ef1a, 18s, rplp1 and ubiq transcripts were found to be well suited as reference genes
during these experimental conditions.

Findings
A good reference gene should be expressed in detectable
amounts without too much variation between tissues.
We have investigated the expression stability of eight
genes, commonly used as reference genes, for internal
control in experiments. Five of these genes (Eukaryotic
elongation factor 1 alpha, ef1a; 18s ribosomal RNA; 18s,

Acidic ribosomal proteins are conserved phosphoproteins
involved in the translation process and may therefore be
co-regulated with ef1a [2]. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) is a cytosolic enzyme that takes part in
the pentose phosphate pathway. In this selection of genes
it is possible that some co-regulation may occur, and it is
important to keep this in mind when evaluating the geNorm results. The stress response induced by hyperthermia was confirmed by expression analysis of two heat
shock proteins, HSP70 and HSP90AA.

Materials and methods
Atlantic cod (size 300-500 g) were obtained from fish
traps in the Oslofjord and kept in 0.3 m 3 tanks with
running seawater. The animals were divided in two
experimental groups containing five wild fishes in each
group. The fish in the heat stress group were kept in a
pool of water in which the temperature was elevated
with 1 degree each day, during a period of 5 days. The
starting temperature was 11°C and after five days of
heating the water temperature was 17°C. The fish in the
control group were kept in a similar tank with stable
temperature to minimize the differences in general
stress from animal housing.
Fish were killed after 5 days and tissue samples were
taken from heart, spleen, head kidney, small intestine,
gills and liver and put directly into RNA-later and frozen (-20°C) until further analysis. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the
Norwegian Animal Welfare Act of 1977, and the Regulation of Animal Experimentation of 1996.
RNA extraction

The tissue samples were mixed with beads and homogenized by a rapid vibration in a Precellys 24 (Bertin
Technologies, France). Total RNA were extracted from
the tissue samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit with on
column RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). The protocol
was according to the manufacturer. Duplicates of cDNA
were made from 2 ug total RNA using High Capacity
RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix, 4 × 96-Well Plate (ABI)
and after the manufacturer’s protocol.
Genes and primers

Atlantic cod ESTs representing the genes to be analyzed
(see Table 1) were obtained by tblastn searching the
respective protein sequences from the TIGR zebrafish
(Danio rerio) [3] against Genbank [4] or Codgene [5].
The chosen target genes were heat shock protein 70
(hsp70) and heat shock protein 90 alpha (hsp90).
Primer design

Primers (Table 1) were designed using the Roche Diagnostics primer design software and synthesized by

Page 2 of 8

InVitrogen (Carlsbad, USA). Primer efficiencies(E) were
calculated from 10-fold dilution series to make standard
curves from with E was calculated according to the formula E = 10-1/slope . The specificity of the primer sets
used was confirmed by the presence of a single band of
correct size on gel electrophoresis in addition to the
presence of a single peak in the dissociation curve
analysis.
RT-qPCR

RT-qPCR was performed in duplicates in 96-well plates
on Lightcycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics). SYBR Green
Master Mix with cDNA made from 2 ug RNA and
diluted 1:50 before added to the PCR reaction, except
for 18s which were used in a 1:1000 dilution. Crossing
point values (Cp) values were obtained from the RTqPCR instrument by employing the second derivative
maximum method of LightCycler480 (Roche Diagnostics). The general guidelines for RT-qPCR experiments
called “MIQE [6].
Analyzes reference genes

A number of mathematical models have been developed
to strengthen the normalization with reference genes.
Examples of these are geNorm [7], Normfinder [8] and
Bestkeeper [9]. GeNorm is restricted to reference gene
analysis and eliminates the worst gene in a set of genes
according to their expression stability. GeNorm perform
a pair-wise variation of each combination of the genes
and the highest expression stability gives the lowest M
value. The least stable gene is eliminated until the two
most stable genes remains. Instead of analyzing the
whole data set, Normfinder focuses on the expression
variations both between treatment groups and inside
one group, in a model-based approach of mixed linear
effect modeling. And finally, Bestkeeper analyze the
variability of the dataset and also compare all genes
against each other in pair-wise correlations, and also
pair-wise correlation against the Bestkeeper index. Bestkeeper also have the ability to do a target gene analysis.
The Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) [10]
was used to compare the hepatic expression of two target genes (hsp70 and hsp90) in the two groups relative
to each of the reference genes.

Results
Figure 1A and 1B show box plots of raw Cp values displaying mean and 95% confidence intervals of the 8 candidate genes across all tissues in both control (A) and
thermal stress group (B). The transcripts with lowest
variation in control were ef1a, ubiq and 18s (range 3, 8
for all 3). The other transcripts all had a Cp range
above 5. In the stress group, 18s, ubiq and actb were the
only 3 genes with Cp-range below 5. 18s and ubiq were

GeNorm

When expression levels in tissues were analyzed separately
in both treatment groups, the genes in the control group
in general displayed higher stability (M) compared to the
stress group. The results from analyzing data from all tissues revealed that ubiq was most stable in both control
and stress group (Figure 2A and 2B, Table 2). In addition,
ubiq was ranked as the best reference gene in at least one
of the treatment groups in all tissues analyzed. The results
from all individual tissues are summarized in Table 2.
Genorm also calculates the pair wise variation between
two sequential normalization factors (reference genes)
NFn and NFn+1, reflecting the effect of including more
than 2 reference genes in the normalization. High NFn
/NF n+1 value mean a significant effect of including an
additional gene in the calculations. Additional file 1 shows
these ratios for inclusion of additional genes were lower
for control (Panel A) than for the stress group (Panel B).
In the control group 2 reference genes were sufficient
(V2/3 < 0.15) whereas in the stress group a more reliable
normalization will be obtained by inclusion of more reference genes, as expected. For practical purposes, 3 reference genes will normally be sufficient [7].

As can be seen from Table 4 all reference genes investigated were positively correlated to each other and
the highest correlations were found between rplp1/

g6pd (r = 0,981) and ef1a/g6pd (r = 0,929). This
method therefore ranked the reference genes somewhat different than geNorm and Normfinder, but
rplp1 and ubiq were still among the four best suited
reference genes.

Stability ranking of individual reference genes in different tissues from Atlantic cod under control (stable temperature) or stress situation (temperature increase of
1?C/day for 5 days) conditions.

Expression of heat shock proteins

The packages use different algorithms to determine the
most stable reference genes. The selection of genes for
further use is therefore a result of choosing the genes
that overall got the highest ranking by all software
packages. Four genes that were ranked high in stability
by all three tools were ef1a, rplp1, 18s and ubiq.
To confirm that the fishes in the heat stress group
actually experienced a stress reaction we analyzed the
expression of two of the heat shock proteins (obtained
from cod sequence databases). Alignment of the translated HSP70 sequence from which primers were constructed with similar proteins from human and other
fishes (Additional file 2 and 3) revealed similarity to
heat inducible HSP70’s from other fishes [11]. The cod
sequence grouped together with inducible HSP70’s from
several fish species and not with the cognate (constitutive) human HSPA8 protein [12]. In a similar fashion
we aligned the cod HSP90 sequence with fish and
human homologs and made a phylogenetic tree by

maximum likelihood method as for HSP70 sequences
(Additional file 4 and 5). Cod HSP90 grouped together
with other inducible fish HSP90AA’s, and not with the
constitutive HSP90AB proteins [13]. The effect of
hyperthermia on these transcripts was then analyzed by
RT-qPCR using the each of the investigated reference
genes as normalizers. Figure 4 shows that the two heat
shock genes were induced relative to all normalizers,
except b2m, the most unstable reference gene in liver,
according to the Normfinder analysis (Table 3), indicating that this transcript was induced even more by
hyperthermia.

Discussion
Previous studies on hyperthermia in cod have shown
that both acute and long term exposure to elevated temperatures induce stress responses in cod [14,15] including changes in gene expression [15]. Olsvik et al has
investigated suitable reference genes for wild populations of Atlantic cod with focus on gene stability in fish
living in contaminated areas. Using geNorm and Normfinder they found that ubiq (ubiquitin) and rplp1 (called
arp in their article) was the most suitable reference
genes for wild populations [1,16]. Similarly, during ontogeny in cod larva, ubiq (ubiquitin) was also found to be
the most stable reference gene [16]. Optimally, genes
from different biological pathways should be selected to
minimize the effects of genes co-regulation [6]. The
reference genes used in this trial were chosen on the

basis of sequence availability for the cod genome and
previous studies in cod [1] and other species [17-20]. If
the genes chosen are included in the same biological
pathway this may interfere with the analysis. This is
because the software performs pair wise comparisons
of gene expression across the various samples.
Co-expressed genes will therefore most probably have
similar expression patterns. If the genes are co-regulated
in the same pathway geNorm tend to assign good score
because it uses a pair wise comparison approach. This is
important to keep in mind when interpreting the results.
In this situation a model-based evaluation like Normfinder would be a better choice.
When comparing the results from geNorm, Normfinder and Bestkeeper, rplp1 and ubiq were the genes
ranked with the highest expression stability by all the
three methods. These results are in line with previously
tested reference genes from Atlantic cod [1]. In six tissues from four different populations of cod, ef1a, rplp1
and ubiq (in addition to three ribosomal proteins) were
found to be the most stable reference genes. The poor
performance of the widely used actb and g6pd is in line
with studies in other fish species [17,20,21].
However, it is important to take into consideration that
reference genes that are stable in one species under one
type of stress may be induced or repressed in other species
during the same conditions [20]. Both hsp70 and hsp90
were induced relative to the most stable reference genes
identified in this study. Although hyperthermia induced
expression of hsp70 has been shown in many species
[22,23], it has also previously been demonstrated that a
rise in temperature of 1°C/day from 11 to 16.5°C does not
increase western blot detectable hsp70 in Atlantic cod
[24]. The reason for this discrepancy between protein and
mRNA from two comparable studies is uncertain, but
there are at least 2 isoforms of hsp70 where one is constitutive and one is stress induced [25].

Conclusions
This is the first study that evaluates a suitable set of
reference genes during hyperthermia in Atlantic Cod.
From different types of software analyses at least 2-3
reference genes should be used and the most suitable
reference genes under these experimental conditions
were 18s, ef1a, rplp1 and ubiq.
