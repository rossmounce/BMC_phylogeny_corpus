Abstract
Background: DNA polymerase γ(Pol-γ) has been shown to be essential for maintenance of the
mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in the petite-positive budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Budding yeast cells lacking mitochondria exhibit a slow-growing or petite-colony phenotype. Petite
strains fail to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. However, it is not clear whether the Polγ is required for mtDNA maintenance in the petite-negative fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe.
Results: We show that disruption of the nuclear gene pog1+ that encodes Pol-γ is sufficient to
deplete mtDNA in S. pombe. Cells bearing pog1∆ allele require substantial growth periods to form
petite colonies. Mitotracker assays indicate that pog1∆ cells are defective in mitochondrial function
and EM analyses suggest that pog1∆ cells lack normal mitochondrial structures. Depletion of
mtDNA in pog1∆ cells is evident from quantitative real-time PCR assays. Genome-wide expression
profiles of pog1∆ and other mtDNA-less cells reveal that many genes involved in response to
stimulus, energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds, cellular carbohydrate metabolism,
and energy reserve metabolism are induced. Conversely, many genes encoding proteins involved
in amino acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation are repressed.
Conclusion: By showing that Pol-γ is essential for mtDNA maintenance and disruption of pog1+
alters the genome-wide expression profiles, we demonstrated that cells lacking mtDNA exhibit
adaptive nuclear gene expression responses in the petite-negative S. pombe.

Background
Mitochondria are essential organelles that generate ATP
through the respiratory chain to provide energy for many
biochemical reactions and cellular processes in eukaryotic
cells. Mitochondria are one of the organelles that contain
its own genetic material, the mitochondrial genome

(mtDNA). It is thought that mitochondria evolved over
millions of years after originating from bacteria that had
invaded eukaryotic cells. It is thus not surprising that Polγ has a lineage similar to prokaryotic DNA polymerase A
in E. coli [1,2]. A nuclear-DNA encoded gene of the catalytic subunit of Pol γ (POLG1 in human and MIP1 in SacPage 1 of 11

charomyces cerevisiae) has been shown to be essential for
mtDNA stability [3,4].

albicans, is very similar to those in mammalian systems
(Figure 1A).

The mitochondrial genomes in many mammalian systems are small when compared to their corresponding
nuclear genomes. Human mtDNA, for example, is only
~16.6 kb in length and rodent mtDNA is ~16.3 kb [5-9].
Mutations in either human mtDNA or POLG1 have been
implicated in a number of diseases such as Leigh's syndrome, Alpers syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia [10]. In S.
cerevisiae, the size of mtDNA is relatively large, ~85.8 kb in
size. Cells depleted of mtDNA (ρ°) have been isolated
through the treatment with ethidium bromide which
results in the formation of tiny or petite colonies in S. cerevisiae [11]. The petite mutants fail to grow on media containing non-fermentable carbon sources owing to a lack of
mitochondrial functions. Petites are not readily isolated
from wild type Schizosaccharomyces pombe using ethidium
bromide treatment [12]. However, some unidentified
nuclear mutations have facilitated the isolation of cells
depleted of mtDNA [13]. The isolated petites exhibited
severely retarded growth phenotypes that impeded further
genetic analyses of these petite strains.

To investigate the function of the Pol-γ, we performed
gene deletion analysis using a PCR-mediated approach
[15]. Diploid transformants that formed colonies on
plates without uracil supplement were isolated for further
validation of gene disruption. The genotype of diploid
pog1+/pog1∆ strains was validated by PCR-assays using
sequence-specific primers (Data not shown). To further
examine whether pog1+ is essential for viability, we performed tetrad dissection analysis. Of ~15 asci/tetrads dissected on YES plates, all tetrads displayed a 2:2
segregation of normal growing spores versus non-growing
spores after growth at 30°C for ~5 days, except for 1 tetrad
in which one of the wild type spores was implanted deep
into the agar and thus impeded its normal growth (figure
1B and 1C). This result indicates that pog1+ is essential for
vegetative growth. Consistent with this, spores that
formed normal-sized colonies were unable to grow on
uracil-dropout plates (Data not shown). PCR assays con-

In this study, we show that the nuclear gene pog1+ (we designate the Pol-γ-encoding gene as pog1+, because the mip1+
designation used in S. cerevisiae has already been used for
a gene encoding a WD repeat protein in S. pombe) is essential for mtDNA maintenance. Significantly, cells bearing a
pog1∆ allele are capable of forming petite colonies after
extended incubation times under optimal growth conditions. The pog1∆ cells display multiple defects such as
non-uptake of mitotracker dyes, impaired mitochondrial
structures, and depletion of mtDNA. Genome-wide
expression profiling of mtDNA-less cells reveals that
many genes encoding proteins involved in response to
stimulus, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy reserve
metabolism are induced. On the other hand, many genes
encoding proteins involved in amino acid metabolism
and oxidative phosphorylation are repressed. The result
indicates an adaptive expression response in petite-negative mtDNA-less S. pombe strains.

Results

DNA polymerase γ is important to support normal growth
in S. pombe
We extracted protein sequences of the DNA polymerase γ
(SPCC24B10.22, designated as pog1+ for Pol-γ) using the
S. pombe genome in the public database [14]. BLAST analysis of the S. pombe Pol-γ revealed its homolog in various
other species such as Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Mus
musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Candida albicans, and S.
cerevisiae. Phylogenic analysis based on protein sequences
showed that S. pombe Pol-γ, like these in S. cerevisiae or C.

firmed that those spores possessed a wild type allele of
pog1+, but not a deletion allele (Data not shown). However, after extended incubation terms, we found the pog1∆

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/323

spores were able to form petite colonies (Figure 1D). This
result indicates that Pol-γ is not essential for viability, but
is important for normal growth rate in S. pombe.
Cells bearing a pog1∆ allele exhibit multiple growth
phenotypes
To investigate phenotypes of the pog1∆ strain, the mutant
cells were subjected to DAPI and aniline staining to visualize DNA and cell wall, respectively. Wild type cells were
cylindrical shaped ~4–5 µm in diameter and ~12–14 µm
in length (Figure 2A). The pog1∆ strain were typically
dumbbell shaped (Figure 2A, see number 1 and 2), had
abnormally thick septa (Figure 2A, see number 2 and 3),
multiple septa (Figure 2A, see number 2) and anucleate
cells (Figure 2A, see number 3). The multiple phenotypes
of the pog1∆ strain are consistent with the notion that
mitochondria are "power plants" that generate energy to
support many biochemical reactions and cellular processes.

We next investigated the Pol-γ subcellular localization in
wild type cells. For this reason, we constructed a strain
bearing a sole copy of pog1+-GFP that exhibited no abnormal growth phenotypes, suggesting that C-terminus tagging of Pol-γ does not affect its biological function. The
GFP-tagged Pol-γ showed the subcellular localization
resembling to that of mitochondria previously reported
[16,17] (Figure 2B).

Functional mitochondria are capable of mitotracker
uptake, a mitochondrion-selective fluorescent dye [18].
To test whether mitochondria were defective in pog1∆
cells, we stained the cells with mitotracker fluorescent
dyes. As shown in Figure 2C, mitotracker fluorescent dyes
aggregated to outline the functional mitochondrial structures in wild type cells. On the other hand, pog1∆ cells
failed to show any fluorescent dye uptake, indicating that
mitochondria are not functional in pog1∆ cells (Figure
2C). Cells with mitochondrial defects would fail to grow
in media containing only non-fermentable carbon
sources such as ethanol or glycerol [13]. To examine the
growth ability of the pog1∆ strain on non-fermentable carbon sources, serial dilution of wild type and pog1∆ cultures were inoculated on plates containing either
fermentable carbon source (i.e., glucose) or non-fermentable carbon source (i.e., glycerol). Both wild type
and pog1∆ cells were capable of growing on glucose
medium, although pog1∆ cells grew substantially slower
than wild type cells (Figure 2D). On the other hand, pog1∆
cells failed to grow on plates containing glycerol, consistent with the conclusion that mitochondria are not functional in pog1∆ cells (Figure 2D).
To investigate whether the mitochondrial malfunction in
pog1∆ cells was associated with disrupted mitochondrial

structures, we thus performed electron microscopic (EM)
analysis. EM images clearly showed the nuclear structure
in wild type and pog1∆ strains (Figure 2E). However, normal mitochondrial structures were only apparent in wild
type cells, but not pog1∆, suggesting that the mitochondrial architecture had been disrupted (Figure 2E). These
results indicate that disruption of Pol-γ is sufficient to
abolish normal mitochondrial structure and consequently mitochondrial function.

than that of the nuclear DNA, opposite to those in wild
type cells (Figure 3A). Therefore, the copy number of
mtDNA was ~1/284 (or 2-8.2)-fold less than that of the

Mitochondrial DNA is depleted in pog1∆ cells
To investigate the role of Pol-γ in maintaining the copy
number of mtDNA, we performed real-time quantitative
PCR (qPCR) using the Syber Green assay on whole DNA
extracted from various strains. Due to different efficiencies
of primer pairs in qPCR assay, the identical concentration
of template DNA could give rise to different Ct-values
(threshold cycle) from different primer pairs. For adequate estimation of the copy number of the samples, multiple pairs of primers specific to either mtDNA or nuclear
genome were utilized in the Syber Green assays. The
median of the Ct values from ~40 primer pairs specific to
mtDNA was used to approximate the copy number of
mtDNA. On the other hand, the median Ct value of ~60
primer pairs specific to nuclear DNA was used to estimate
the copy number of the nuclear DNA. The higher the copy
number of the sample, the sooner accumulated product
would be detected in the real-time qPCR assay as a significant increase in fluorescence, and the lower the Ct value.

In wild type cells, the median Ct value for the mtDNA and
nuclear DNA was 15.0 and 21.6, respectively, using the
Syber Green assay (Figure 3A, left panel). That is, the
median Ct value of mtDNA was 6.6-cycles less than that
of the nuclear DNA. For easy comparison, 6.6-cycles difference could be converted into ~96.6 (equivalent to 26.6)fold difference. In other words, the copy number of
mtDNA was ~96.6-fold higher than that of nuclear DNA
in wild type cells (Figure 3A, right panel). This result indicates that there are ~100 copies of mtDNA in a haploid
G1-phase cell (a G1-cell would contain 1 copy of nuclear
DNA). Given that the cell-cycle length was mostly occupied by G2-phase (a haploid G2-cell would contain two
copies of nuclear DNA) under optimal growth conditions
in S. pombe [19], an active growing S. pombe cell would
thus contain ~100–200 copies.
We next investigated the copy number of mtDNA in pog1∆
cells. A majority of pog1∆ cells were found to possess 2CDNA contents, as seen in wild type cells (Data not
shown), suggesting no changes in nuclear DNA profiles.
According to the real-time qPCR assay, the median Ct
value of mtDNA and nuclear DNA was found to be 29.8
and 21.6, respectively, in pog1∆ cells (Figure 3B). That is
to say, the median Ct value of mtDNA was 8.2-cycles more

nuclear DNA in pog1∆ cells (Figure 3B). Approximately
150–300 pog1∆ cells would share one copy of mtDNA.
This result indicates that mtDNA was dramatically
depleted in pog1∆ cells.

to all three strains, the union of 142 genes appeared to be
significantly enriched in the down-regulated genes of
individual mtDNA-less strains when the threshold was
reduced to 2-fold differences (Data not shown). These

It has been reported that no mtDNA could be detected by
Southern blot analysis in ptp2-1 and ptp1-1 cells [13]. We
thus applied both strains as negative control for the Syber
Green assay. As shown in Figure 3C and 3D, the median
Ct value of mtDNA was much higher than that of nuclear
DNA in either ptp2-1 or ptp1-1 strains, indicating that the
Syber Green assay is adequate for determination of
mtDNA and nuclear DNA copy numbers. Based on the
assay, it was estimated that ~25–50 ptp2-1 or ptp1-1 cells
would share one copy of mtDNA, suggesting that mtDNA
was depleted in ptp mutant cells.
Differentially expressed genes in the pog1∆ strain
Whole-genome expression profiling of mutant strains is a
useful approach to assess genetic phenotypes of various
strains [20]. To investigate differential expressions in
mtDNA-less cells, we performed expression profile analysis in pog1∆, ptp1-1, and ptp2-1 cells using the S. pombe
genome-wide DNA microarray [19]. To this end, total
RNA extracted from various strains was reverse transcribed
in presence of cyanine dye Cy5-coupled dUTP. Cy5labeled cDNA was subjected to microarray hybridized
against a Cy3-labeled common reference cDNA (wild type
cells). For reproducibility at least 3 independent assays
were performed.

Expression profiles of mtDNA-less strains were compared
with the wild type self-self hybridizations for identification of differentially expressed genes using SAM analysis
[21]. As a result, approximately 161, 154, and 163 genes
whose expression levels showed to be up-regulated for 3fold or more in pog1∆, ptp1-1, and ptp2-1, respectively (Figure 4A). Approximately 87 up-regulated genes [for the
complete list of genes, see Additional File 1] were common in pog1∆, ptp1-1, and ptp2-1 strain, suggesting a universal pattern of expression responses in the mtDNA-less
cells. The 87 up-regulated genes showed to significantly
enrich for genes involved in response to various stimuli
and stress factors (GO:6950; GO:9408; GO:9628;
GO:42221; and GO:50896), carbohydrate metabolism
(GO:5975; GO:5984; GO:5991; GO:6112; and
GO:44262), catabolism and biosynthesis (GO:5992;
GO:16052; GO:44275; and GO:46351), and others
(GO:15980 and GO:43086) (p-value < 0.001) (Figure
4C).
Approximately 55, 47, and 94 genes were found to be
down-regulated for at least 3-fold or more in pog1∆, ptp11, and ptp2-1, respectively, compared to those in wild type
cells (Figure 4B). Although only ~10 genes were common

142 down-regulated genes [for the complete list of genes,
see Additional File 1] were found to enrich those involved
in amino acids and protein metabolism and biosynthesis

GO:8652; GO:9081; GO:9082; GO:9097; GO:9309;

GO:6122; and GO:42773) (p-value < 8.5× 10-7) (Figure
4D).
Comparison of expression profiles of cells depleted of
mtDNA in S. cerevisiae [22,23] and human Namalwa cell
lines [24] yielded a common theme that genes encoding
enzymes involved in glycolytic pathways and stress
response pathways are induced in ρ° cells, suggesting an
evolutionarily conserved transcriptional response mechanism to the depletion of mitochondrial function (Figure
4E).
Repression of genes involved in energy generation in
pog1∆ cells
Enzymes involved in TCA cycle and cellular respiration
are required to function in mitochondria. Many of these
enzymes are encoded by nuclear DNA. Only a few subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and ATPase complexes are encoded by the mtDNA in S. pombe, for
example, cox1, cox2, cox3, atp6, atp8, and atp9 [25]. To
investigate whether nuclear genes encoding respiratory
proteins were expressed in pog1∆, ptp1-1 and ptp2-1 cells,
we extracted expression profiles of these genes from the
genome-wide profiles. For this reason, steady-state levels
of 16 transcripts encoding enzymes involved in the TCA
cycle were first extracted and compared with those of ρ°
cells in S. cerevisiae based on the study by Epstein et al.
[23] (Figure 5A). The degree of expression level alterations
in S pombe mtDNA-less pog1∆, ptp1-1, and ptp2-1 strains
was more dramatic than those found in ρ° cells of S. cerevisiae (Figure 5A). Significantly, expression levels of
enzymes in part of the TCA cycle such as isocitrate dehydrogenase subunits Idh1p and Idh2p were elevated in all
S. pombe mtDNA-less strains. The levels of citrate synthase
Cit1p, aconitate hydratase Aco1p and Aco2p were elevated only in pog1∆ cells, but reduced in ptp1-1 or ptp2-1
cells. Conversely, levels of succinate-CoA ligase subunits
Lsc1p and Lsc2p, succinate dehydrogenase subunits Sdh14p, and isocitrate dehydrogenase were reduced in all three
S. pombe mtDNA-less strains (Figure 5A and 5B). The
result indicates that not all genes encoding enzymes
involved in TCA cycle are down-regulated in the mtDNAless strain.

We subsequently examined expression profiles of genes
encoding cytochrome c reductase and oxidase complexes.
As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, expression levels of transcripts function in both reductase and oxidase were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/323

repressed in pog1∆, ptp1-1, and ptp2-1 cells, except for the
levels of cqr7+ in ptp2-1, consistent with a lack of mitochondrial function. In addition, expression levels of ATP
synthase complexes were also repressed (Figure 5E). These
results suggested that genes encoding proteins involved in
energy generation in mitochondria were largely repressed
in cells depleted of mtDNA.

Discussion
The fission yeast S. pombe is known as the petite-negative
that can not tolerate the lost of mtDNA, in contrast to the
budding yeast S. cerevisiae [12]. However, some nuclear
mutations are known to allow growth of mtDNA-less S.
pombe cells [13]. In this study, we show that an evolutionarily conserved Pol-γ is essential for maintenance of
mtDNA in S. pombe. Spores bearing a pog1∆ allele form
petite colonies after extended incubation terms (Figure
1D and 1E). We have further shown that pog1∆ cells
exhibit multiple growth phenotypes (Figure 2) and are
depleted of mtDNA, similar to the ptp mutants (Figure 3).
Thus, the petite-negative S. pombe mtDNA-less cells do not
cease to grow on medium containing fermentable carbon
courses, although the growth is substantially slow and
exhibit severe growth phenotypes.
We show that pog1∆ cells depleted of mtDNA possess no
normal mitochondrial structures when compared with
cells containing mtDNA in EM analyses (Figure 2E). This
result suggests that mtDNA is required for maintaining
normal mitochondrial structures in S. pombe. Mitochondrial respiratory complexes including cytochrome c oxidase and ATPase are encoded by both nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes [26,27]. In S. pombe, mtDNA
encodes at least 3 subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase
(COX) complex and 3 subunits of the ATPase complex
[25]. Our result suggests that without these COX and
ATPase subunits cells fail to assemble membranes with
mitochondrial potential. Consistent with this, pog1∆ cells
fail to uptake mitochondria-specific dye or mitotracker
due to a lack of mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure
2C).
We show that, on average, each haploid cell contains
~100–200 copies of mtDNA based on the real-time qPCR
analysis (Figure 3A). This is consistent with the observation of number of mitochondria-specific GFP foci
reported by Matsuyama et al. [17] and in this study (Figure 2B). In pog1∆ cells, the mtDNA drops to ~1/300–1/
150 copies per cell. Similarly, the mtDNA in ptp1-1 or
ptp2-1 cells also drops to ~1/50–1/25 copies per cell (Figure 3C and 3D). The result supports the notion that these
strains are depleted of mtDNA. Residues detected by
mtDNA-specific primers in the real-time qPCR assay are
probably represented the non-specific products; or other
nuclear DNA polymerases in S. pombe could inefficiently

rescue the lack of Pol-γ by replicating mtDNA in pog1∆
cells. Alternatively, pog1∆ spores may carry over the
mtDNA from the diploid mother cells during sproulation.
The mtDNA copy number is substantially diluted during
the growth of pog1∆ cells. However, it is not clear why the
ptp mutant strains display higher mtDNA background
than the pog1∆ (Figure 3B–D).
Genome-wide expression profiling of mtDNA-less cells
revealed that the nuclear genes encoding carbohydrate
metabolism and response to stimulus are induced by at
least 3-fold. This result suggests that cells with impaired
mitochondrial function attempt to maintain their growth
competence potential (Figure 4E). In addition, cells lacking mtDNA appear to undergo extensive oxidative metabolism, consistent with the notion that respiratory
deficiency induces peroxisome biogenesis [22,23]. On the
other hand, genes encoding proteins involved in amino
acids metabolism and energy production are down-regulated. This result suggested that mtDNA-less cells are
adapted for slow growth and repress genes that are
involved in mitochondrial function. Indeed, the majority
of the nuclear genes encoding enzymes involved in TCA
cycle and almost all genes involved in cytochrome c
reductase and oxidase complexes are repressed (Figure 5),
similar to those seen in ρ° cells in S. cerevisiae.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that Pol-γ is essential for mtDNA
maintenance. Cells bearing a pog1∆ allele are viable but
grow substantially slower in the petite-negative S. pombe.
Expression profiling of pog1∆ and other mtDNA-less
mutant cells indicates that genes involved in glycolytic
pathways and stress response are induced, common to
budding yeast and human cell line systems [22-24]. Taken
together, we propose that a common theme of adaptive
expression responses to the disruption of mtDNA occur in
both petite-positive (eg., S. cerevisiae) and petite-negative
(eg., S. pombe) cells.

pJH1000 (pBlueScript containing a HindIII fragment harboring ura4+). YJL1001 colonies bearing heterozygous
allele of pog1∆ ::ura4+/pog1+ were selected on uracil-drop
plates. Tetrads arising from sporulation of YJL1001 were
dissected on a MSM system dissection microscope (Singer
Instruments, UK) and one of the ura4+ spores collected as
labeled YJL1002. Primers (SPCC24B10.22_A, 5'-ACATTTAACTGTTTATACTTGC-3'; SPCC24B10.22_B, 5'-AGAGCAGGTGATAAGTATTGAA-3'; SPCC24B10.22_C, 5'TCTAACAAAGTCCCCATACC-3'; SPCC24B10.22_D, 5'GATCCGTTCTGTTTCTATATGT-3') were used in PCR
assays for validation of pog1∆ ::ura4+ alleles. PCR fragments that were synthesized by primer pairs
(SPCC24B10.22_TAF,

sole copy of pog1+-GFP.
Microscopic and FACS analyses
Fluorescence microscopy
Cells were fixed by adding one tenth volume of concentrated formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min and
washed with PBS. DNA and cells walls were stained with
4'-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Aniline blue
(Sigma-Aldrich) respectively, for fluorescence microscopic analysis (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), respectively.

Methods
Strains and media
S. pombe strains YJL1000 (h-/h+ade6-M210/ade6-M216
leu1-32/leu1-32 ura4-D18/ura4-D18), YJL1001 (h-/
h+pog1+/pog1∆ ::ura4+ade6-M210/ade6-M216 leu1-32/leu132 ura4-D18/ura4-D18), YJL1002 (h-pog1∆ ::ura4+ade6leu1-32 ura4-D18), YJL1003 (h-pog1+-GFP::ura4+leu1-32
ura4-D18), YJL1004 (h-leu1-32 ura4-D18), YJL1005 (hleu1-32); PHP14 (h-ade6-M216 leu1-32 ptp1-1), and PHP4
(h-ade6-M210 ptp2-1) were used in this study. Standard
fission yeast growth media YES and EMM were used [28].
To test growth ability on non-fermentable carbon source,
glycerol medium (glycerol replaces glucose in EMM
medium) was used. Cultures were grown at 28–30°C
unless otherwise mentioned.

Electron microscopy
Briefly, cells were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde contained in
0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM
CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5% sucrose for 1 hr at 25°C
with gentle agitation; spheroplasted; embedded in 2%
ultra low temperature agarose (prepared in water);
cooled; and subsequently cut into small pieces (<1 mm3)
[29]. The cells were then post-fixed in 1% OsO4/1%
potassium ferrocyanide contained in 0.1 M cacodylate/5
mM CaCl2 buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. The blocks were washed thoroughly four times with
ddH2O, 10 min total; transferred to 1% thiocarbohydrazide at room temperature for 3 min; washed in ddH2O
(four times, 1 min each); and transferred to 1% OsO4/1%

(pH 7.4) for an additional 3 min at room temp. The cells
were then washed four times with ddH2O (15 min total),
en bloc stained in Kellenberger's uranyl acetate for 2 h to
overnight, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol,
and subsequently embedded in Spurr resin. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Jung Reichert ultramicrotome and
examined with a transmission electron microscope
(JEM1010, JEOL) at 100 kV.
Tetrad dissection microscopy
Approximately 15 tetrads were dissected with a tetrad dissection MSM System microscope (Singer Instrument Inc.,
UK) on YES plates, incubated at 30°C. Colonies were replica-plated onto uracil-dropout plates for determination
of pog1∆ ::ura4+ or ura4-D18 markers.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses
To measure DNA content, cells were quickly spun out and
resuspended in ice-cold 70% ethanol and digested with
RNase A (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in 50 mM sodium
citrate overnight, and briefly washed with PBS. DNA was
stained with propidium iodine (Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence intensities of individual cells were measured by flow
cytometry using a BD FACScan (DB Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ).
MitoTracker assay
To determine functional mitochondrion, vegetative
growth cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000
rpm for 5 min at 4°C and washed with water. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in solution containing
100 nM MitoTracker (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.
Before examining under a fluorescence microscope (Leica,
Wetzlar, Germany), the stained cells were washed with
water for at least three times.
Isolation of nucleic acids
DNA extraction
10-ml culture was centrifuged at 2500–3000 rpm for 2
min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1-ml distilled
water and transferred into a 2-ml eppendorf tube. The
tube was then subjected to a brief centrifugation for 30 sec
at 12 Krpm in a microcentrifuge. The cells were resuspended in 0.5-ml sorbitol buffer (1.2 M sorbitol/0.1 M
EDTA) containing Zymolyase (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The spheroplasts were collected
by centrifugation at 14 Krpm for 5 min and resuspended
in 0.5-ml TES buffer (50 mM Tris/500 mM EDTA/100 mM
NaCl, pH 8.0). 50 µl of both 10% SDS and 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) were added into
the spheroplasts and incubated at 65°C for 30 min with
gentle mixing in a thermomixer (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 500–600 rpm. The tube was transferred

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/323

onto ice. 200-ml 5 M KCl was later added into the tube,
the contents mixed, and the sample incubated on ice for
additional 30 min. Bulky proteins were removed by centrifugation at 14 Krpm for 30 min at 4°C. DNA was
washed with 80% cold ethanol and air dried. Resuspended DNA was subjected to DNase-free RNase (Roche)
treatment and then extraction with phenol and chloroform and ethanol-precipitation. Resuspended DNA was
quantified using a NanoDrop UV photo-spectrometer
(NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted using acid phenol and treated
with RNase-free DNase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) for 20
min at room temperature. For RT-qPCR analysis, the RNA
was subsequently used as template to synthesize cDNA
using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA)
with poly-d(T)20 primers according to manufacturer's
guide. cDNA was cleaned by extraction with phenol and
precipitation using ethanol. Then RNA pellet was resuspended in DEPC-treated distilled water and quantified.
Real-time qPCR analysis
Aliquots of ~20-ng total DNA were added to each well in
a 96-well plate containing Syber Green master mix
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Triplicate PCR
reactions for each gene-specific primer pairs [for a list of
primer sequences, see Additional File 2] were carried out
according to manufacturer's instruction using a quantitative real-time PCR machine (ABI PRISM® Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems) with an analytic
software SDS2.2 (Applied Biosystems). In brief, it was
programmed for 1 cycle at 95°C for 10 min, followed by
40 cycles at 95°C for 10 min and 60°C for 1 min. An additional cycle of 15 sec at 95°C, 60°C, and 95°C each was
used to monitor the dissociation dynamics of PCR products. Standardized cycle threshold (Ct) of each PCR reaction was collected if the dissociation curve indicated no
multiple products.
Microarray fabrication and hybridization
50-mer oligonucleotides (Proligo Biochemie GmbH,
Hamburg, Germany) at a normalized concentration of 40
nM each in 96-well plates were mixed with equal volumes
of 0.3× SSC buffer and transferred to 384-well plates using
a BioMed FX liquid handling robot (Beckman Coulter
Inc., Fullerton, CA). The oligonucleotides were subsequently spotted onto poly-Lysine coated glass slides at
random positions using a spotting machine (GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA). Spotted slides were post-processed as described previously [19] before hybridization
with fluorescent dye-labeled cDNA.

Approximately 20 µg of total RNA were used to synthesize
cDNA in presence of fluorescent dye Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP

using a reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Labeled
cDNA was cleaned by washing on a microcon-YM30 column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Equal amounts of Cy3and Cy5-labeled cDNA was pooled and co-hybridized to
a microarray slide using a EasyHyb buffer (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) in a hybridization chamber (GeneMachines)
or a MAUI® mixer (BioMicro Systems, Salt Lake City, UT)
at 42°C overnight. The slide was subsequently washed in
a series of buffers containing various concentration of SSC
(2× – 0.2×) with or without 1% SDS and dried by centrifugation before scanning.
Microarray data acquisition and processing
Microarray slides were scanned using a GenePix scanner
(Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at wavelengths 635
and 532 µm with a resolution of 10 µm controlled by
GenePix Pro4 softwares (Axon Instruments). GPR (GenePix Result) files were generated and globally normalized
based on a median of ratios by GenePix Pro. Ratios (i.e.,
median of ratios) and absolute intensity (i.e., median of
absolute intensity) of each spot were collected only if the
absolute intensity of spots (in either channel) was 2-fold
or higher than the background to ensure good data quality.
Intensity normalization
Intensity normalization assumed that the average absolute intensity Cy3 of individual features in an array is a
constant C, for a series of microarray hybridizations with
a common reference (labeled with Cy3-dye). Each array is
related to this constant C by a factor k,

 n
 
i.e. C = k   ∑ Cy 3i  / n  , where C is set to 2500 (arbi 
  i =1
 

trary unit) for convenience, i is an individual feature on an
array, and n is a total number of available features (n ≤
9858). To remove outliers during determining factor k for
an array, selected features in factor k estimation were only
those whose log-intensity (log10Cy3) are within the 2σ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/323

for each individual array to remove intensity-dependent
dye-bias. An MA-plot is used to facilitate detecting intensity-dependent patterns in the log ratio, where M =
1
log2(Ratio) and A = log10 (Cy 3 ⋅ Cy 5) . The Lowess
2
smoother, implemented in the statistical software package
R [33], locally normalizes M in an A-dependent manner
log2(Ratio') = log2(Ratio) - L(A), where L(A) is the Lowess
fit to the MA-plot. The user defined parameters f (fraction
of data used for smoothing at each point), nsteps (number
of iterations used in Lowess fit) are 0.5 and 3, respectively.
Statistical analyses
We applied Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM,
version 1.21) [21] to analyze the differential expression of
genes by comparing expression profiles of pog1∆, ptp1-1,
or ptp2-1 with the wild type. At least 3 independently
repeated microarray hybridizations were performed for
reproducibility.

The completed microarray datasets are submitted to GEO
databases (accession number GSE5941).

does not change ratio of individual features. However, it
