Abstract
Consensus-Degenerate Hybrid Oligonucleotide Primer (CODEHOP) PCR primers derived from
amino acid sequence motifs which are highly conserved between members of a protein family have
proven to be highly effective in the identification and characterization of distantly related family
members. Here, the use of the CODEHOP strategy to identify novel viruses and obtain sequence
information for phylogenetic characterization, gene structure determination and genome analysis
is reviewed. While this review describes techniques for the identification of members of the
herpesvirus family of DNA viruses, the same methodology and approach is applicable to other virus
families.

Introduction
Only a very small fraction of the vast number of viral species belonging to the different virus families have been
identified and characterized to date. The majority of these
uncharacterized viral species are found in host organisms
which have not been targeted in biomedical, plant or animal research. However, recent reports have noted an
increase in the occurrence of viral diseases, not only in
humans, but in animals and plants as well. While some of
this rise may reflect more effective surveillance techniques, disease outbreaks caused by novel cross-species
infections and/or subsequent virus recombination events
have occurred [1]. Therefore, the development of tools for
the detection of viruses, the characterization of their
genomes and the study of their evolution, becomes
important, not only for basic scientific study, but also for
the protection of public health and the well-being of the
plant and animal life that surrounds us.

We have developed a novel technology to identify and
characterize distantly related gene sequences based on
consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers
(CODEHOPs)[2]. CODEHOPs are designed from amino
acid sequence motifs that are highly conserved within
members of a gene family, and are used in PCR amplification to identify unknown related family members. We
have developed and implemented a computer program
that is accessible over the World Wide Web to facilitate the
design of CODEHOPs from a set of related protein
sequences [3]. This site is linked to the Block Maker multiple sequence alignment site [4] on the BLOCKS WWW
server [5] hosted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center, Seattle, WA.
We have utilized the CODEHOP technique to develop
novel assays to detect previously unknown viral species by
targeting sequence motifs within stable housekeeping
genes that are evolutionarily conserved between different
members of virus families. Using CODEHOPs derived

from conserved motifs within retroviral reverse transcriptases, we have previously identifed a diverse family of
retroviral elements in the human genome [2], as well as a
novel endogenous pig retrovirus [6], and a new retrovirus
in Talapoin monkeys [7]. We have also developed assays
to detect unknown herpesviruses by targeting conserved
motifs within herpesvirus DNA polymerases. Using this
approach, we have identified fourteen previously
unknown DNA polymerase sequences from members of
the alpha, beta and gamma subfamilies of herpesviruses
[8], and have discovered three homologs of the Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus in macaques [9,10]. We
have also used the CODEHOP technique to clone and
characterize the entire DNA polymerase gene from these
new viruses [10] and to obtain sequences for larger
regions of viral genomes containing multiple genes, targeting the divergent locus B of macaque rhadinoviruses
[11]. The sequence information obtained from the amplified gene and genomic fragments from these studies has
allowed informative phylogenetic characterization of the
new viral species, and has provided critical information
regarding the gene structure and genetic content of these
unknown viral genomes.

In this review, the CODEHOP methodology and its utilization in the identification and characterization of novel
viral genomes using the herpesvirus family as an example
is described. Published CODEHOP assays that we have
previously used to identify new herpesviruses are discussed and the latest refined assays and their utility are
provided. The use of the CODEHOP methodology for the
analysis of larger regions of viral genomes is presented
along with the general application of this technology for
the identification of viral species and their genes in other
virus families. Finally, the software and Web site that we
have developed to derive CODEHOP PCR primers from
blocks of multiply aligned protein sequences are
described.

CODEHOP Methodology
General CODEHOP Design and PCR Strategy
CODEHOPs are derived from highly conserved amino
acid sequence motifs present in multiple alignments of
related proteins from a targeted gene family. Each CODEHOP consists of a pool of primers where each primer contains one of the possible coding sequences across a 3–4
amino acid motif at the 3' end (degenerate core) (Figure
1A) [2]. Each primer also contains a longer sequence
derived from a consensus of the possible coding
sequences 5' to the core motif (consensus clamp). Thus,
each primer has a different 3' sequence coding for the
amino acid motif and the same 5' consensus sequence.
Hybridization of the 3' degenerate core with the target
DNA template is stabilized by the 5' consensus clamp during the initial PCR amplification reaction (Figure 1B).

consensus sequence derived from the most frequently used
codons for 5 upstream amino acids within the motif. (B)

between primer (arrow) and template or amplified PCR
product. The overall degeneracy of the 3' degenerate core is
the product of the degeneracies at each nucleotide position
so that the fraction of primers with sequences identical to
the targeted template across the degenerate core = 1/degeneracy.

Hybridization of primers to PCR products during subsequent amplification cycles is driven by interactions
through the 5' consensus clamp.

targeted gene family using computer programs such as the
Clustal W multiple alignment program [12]. Optimal
blocks contain 3–4 highly conserved amino acids with
restricted codon multiplicity from which the 3' degenerate
core is derived; the presence of serines, arginines and
leucines are not favored due to the presence of six possible
codons for each amino acid. In addition, optimal blocks
contain 5 or more conserved amino acids from which the
5' consensus clamp is derived. These blocks of conserved
amino acid sequences should be situated in close enough
proximity to allow efficient PCR amplification between
blocks yet distant enough to flank a region of significant
sequence information.
We have developed web-based software to predict CODEHOP PCR primers from blocks of conserved amino acid
sequences [2,13]. Multiple related protein sequences from

the targeted gene family are provided to the Block Maker
program [4] at the BLOCKs WWW server [5] which produces a set of conserved sequence blocks obtained from a
multiple sequence alignment. The sequence block output
is linked directly to the CODEHOP design software [3]
which predicts and scores possible CODEHOP PCR primers. The different CODEHOP PCR primers discussed in
this review were either designed manually or with the
CODEHOP software, and are listed in Table 1.
CODEHOP PCR Amplification, Product Cloning and
Sequence Analysis
CODEHOP PCR amplification has been performed using
classical and touch-down approaches with a hot-start initiation [2]. More recently, thermal gradient PCR amplification has been used to empirically determine optimal
annealing and amplification conditions for the pool of

primers [11]. Different buffers, salt concentrations, and
enzymes have been employed with varying success due to
differences in DNA template preparation and the
unknown nature of the targeted sequence. PCR products
are either sequenced directly or after TA-cloning.

In this review, sequences were compared by BLAST analysis [14] and multiple alignment using Clustal W [12]. Phylogenetic analysis of the multiply aligned sequences was
performed using protein distance and neighbor-joining
analysis implemented in the Phylip analysis package [15].
Bootstrap analysis was also performed with 100 replicates
and a consensus phylogenetic tree was determined. For
the phylogenetic analysis, positions in the multiple alignment containing gaps due to insertions or deletions
within the sequence blocks were eliminated.

The "TGV-IYG" CODEHOP assay to detect
novel herpesviruses
The Herpesviridae was chosen as a target virus family to
develop assays to detect and characterize new viral members. All members of the herpesvirus family contain a
DNA polymerase within their genome which is highly
conserved across the different family members. Multiple
alignment of different herpesvirus polymerase sequences
revealed blocks of conserved amino acids corresponding
to many of the functionally important motifs [16], see Figure 2A. We have developed and refined PCR strategies
using CODEHOP PCR primers derived from these conserved sequence blocks to detect novel herpesviruses and
characterize their genomes.
Initially, we manually designed a set of nested PCR primers from four of the conserved DNA polymerase blocks
(indicated as black boxes in Figure 2A) which could be
used to identify new viral polymerases and detect the
existence of previously unknown or uncharacterized herpesviruses [8]. The primers, "TGV", "IYG", "DFA" and
"KG1" (Table 1), and the blocks of multiply aligned
sequences from which the primers were derived are
shown in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively (letters in the
primer name refer to conserved amino acids in the
sequence motif). Although these primers were alternately
referred to as either "consensus" primers or "degenerate"
primers within the original publication, all except DFA
were designed using the general CODEHOP strategy [2].
In the "TGV-IYG" herpesvirus assay, the "DFA" sense
primer was used in an initial PCR amplification with the
"KG1" anti-sense primer (Figure 2B). An additional sense
primer "ILK" located downstream of the "DFA" motif was
also added to the initial amplification reaction [8]. The
product from this amplification was used as template in a
nested amplification reaction using the "TGV" sense
primer and the "IYG" anti-sense primer (Figure 2B). This
final PCR product was sequenced to obtain the ~165–180

bp region of the DNA polymerase gene located between
the two motifs "TGV" and "IYG". The distance between
the two motifs was variable between viral species due to
small sequence insertions or deletions.
We have shown the utility of this CODEHOP PCR primer
strategy by identifying and characterizing14 previously
unknown DNA polymerase sequences from members of
the alpha, beta and gamma subfamilies of herpesviruses
[8]. Since this original publication, more than 21 additional "TGV-IYG" DNA polymerase sequences from previously uncharacterized herpesviruses have been obtained
by other investigators using this CODEHOP primer strategy (see Additional File 1; "TGV-IYG" assay). In some
cases, PCR amplification was performed with modified
deoxyinosine-substituted primers [17].
Comparison of the amino acid sequences encoded within
the "TGV-IYG" region has allowed phylogenetic comparison of the different herpesvirus species from which these
sequences were obtained. Figure 7 shows a phylogenetic
tree resulting from the analysis of the sequences obtained

from 34 different herpesvirus species identified using the
"TGV-IYG" CODEHOP strategy and the corresponding
sequences of six representative human herpesviruses.
Although the number of amino acid comparisons within
this region is limited, ie. only 53 amino acids, preliminary
assignment of many of the herpesvirus species to one of
the three herpesvirus subfamilies has been possible (Figure 7 and Additional File 1). Values from the bootstrap
analysis using 100 replicates are indicated for each branch

point. While some of the branch points were not well
defined due to the limited amount of sequence data, as
indicated by boostrap values less than 50, many groupings were well supported. The analysis shows clearly the
grouping of different viral species from evolutionarily
related hosts. This is consistent with previous studies
which have shown extensive cospeciation of viral species
and their host lineages [18].

block determined by BlockMaker. The CODEHOP algorithm was unable to determine a 5' consensus clamp giving the required
Tm due to the small size of the block. Therefore, three additional amino acid positions (in italics) were added to the C' terminal side of the block in (A) and (B) to allow visual inspection of the sequences to manually determine an additional 8 bp of the
5' consensus clamp which are underlined. The nucleotide sequences, relative positions and encoded amino acid sequences for
the manually designed CODEHOPs, "IYG" and "GDTD1B" are also shown (see Table 1 for the exact nucleotide sequences of
these anti-sense strand primers). The degeneracy of the primer pools is indicated in parentheses and the highlighted residues
are discussed in the text. The CODEHOP primers, YGDTB, IYG and GDTD1B are all derived from the antisense DNA strand
and are shown below the codons for the sense strand.

Limiting degeneracy to increase sensitivity
While the "TVG-IYG" herpesvirus assay demonstrated the
ability to detect disparate herpesvirus species in high titer

virus cultures in vitro, the detection of limiting amounts of
virus in tissue samples in vivo was problematic. This was
especially true in sections obtained from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue blocks which contained small
amounts of degraded DNA. The degeneracy of the primer

the CODEHOP algorithm is presented (in bold and boxed) and the other amino acids found at each position are aligned vertically above the consensus amino acid. The sequences of the coding strand and complementary strand corresponding to the
"KGVDB" CODEHOP predicted by the CODEHOP software is indicated. The nucleotide sequences, relative positions and

amplifying low copy numbers of DNA templates found in
virus infected tissues in vivo, especially in formalin-fixed
tissue. As the degeneracy increases, the concentration of
the primer or primers that will participate in the desired
amplification reaction decreases and can become suboptimal. Conversely, the vast excess of primers not participating in the amplification of the targeted gene can cause
non-specific amplification which can, in turn, inhibit or
mask the amplification of the desired target.
As indicated in Table 1, the degeneracy of the primers utilized in the "TVG-IYG" assay ranged from 48–1024. This
level of degeneracy was driven by the number of nucleotide possibilities encoding the targeted amino acids at
each position as well as by the number of amino acid
positions allowed to be degenerate. Figure 5A shows the
DFA/DFAS/QAHN sequence block produced by Block
Maker from multiple alignments of 11 different herpesvi-

rus polymerase sequences. Figure 5C shows the consensus
amino acids at each position, as determined by the
CODEHOP algorithm, which are boxed and bolded with
the alternate amino acids positioned above. The original
primer manually derived from this motif, "DFA" is, in
fact, completely degenerate, with multiple codons provided for each amino acid position, except the ultimate
proline (P) residue, yielding a pool of 512 different primers [8]. Because the performance of this primer was consistently suboptimal in samples with limiting template,
the overall structure and degeneracy of the primer was
altered by designing a PCR primer "DFASA" from the
same sequence motif using the CODEHOP methodology.
This primer had an 11 bp 5' consensus region and a 3'
degenerate core containing multiple codons at 5 amino
acid positions resulting in a pool of 256 different primers
(Figure 5C). The "DFASA" primer was successfully used to
amplify extremely low amounts of viral DNA in a back-

Phylogenetic analysis of DNA polymerase sequences from different herpesvirus species identified with the
"TGV-IYG" CODEHOP assay The phylogeny of DNA polymerase sequences (~53 amino acids in length) from thirty-six
herpesviruses identified using the "TGV-IYG" assay (see Tables 2 and 3) and the corresponding sequences of six representative
human herpesviruses (boxed) was determined using the neighbor joining method (Neighbor) applied to pairwise sequence distances (ProtDist) using the Phylip suite of programs [15]. Bootstrap scores (Seqboot) from 100 replicates are indicated and the

formalin-fixed tissue in the discovery of the macaque
homolog of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus,
called retroperitoneal fibromatosis herpesvirus (RFHV)
[9]. Subsequent estimates of virus copy number using
real-time quantitative PCR indicated a level of RFHV DNA
in the available samples that was 1/100–1/1000 of a single copy cellular gene (unpublished observations). The
"DFASA" primer has been successfully used to identify a
number of novel alpha-, beta- and gammaherpesviruses

in a wide variety of host organisms (see Additional File 1:
"DFASA-GDTD1B assay").
Due to the presence of a highly conserved leucine (L) at
block position 7 within the "DFAS" motif (Figure 5)
which significantly increased the degeneracy of the primer
pool with its six possible codons, an additional CODEHOP was designed from the "QAHN" motif immediately
downstream of "DFAS" to further decrease degeneracy.
The "QAHNA" primer had an 11 bp 5'consensus region

and a 3' degenerate core containing multiple codons at 4
amino acid positions resulting in a pool of 48 different
primers (Figure 5C). This CODEHOP has been successfully used to identify several primate rhadinoviruses
related to KSHV in tissue samples with limiting amount of
viral DNA [10,19], see also Additional File 1.
Primer bias and specificity
The primers developed for the "TGV-IYG" assay were
designed to amplify polymerase fragments from herpesviruses of all three subfamilies based on conserved motifs
within the known sequences. However, very few sequence
motifs were absolutely conserved between the most
divergent herpesviruses. For example, the catfish ictalurid
herpesvirus (IHV) lacked the "KGV" motif from which the
initial "KGV" primer was derived (Figure 6). Furthermore,
numerous sequence differences were present in the IHV
DNA polymerase within the DFAS/QAHN motif which

was otherwise highly conserved in other herpesvirus species (highlighted residues in Fig. 5B). Because of these differences, the IHV sequence was excluded from the primer
design of the "DFA", "DFASA" and "QAHNA" PCR primers. As shown in Figure 5C, the "DFA" and "DFASA" primers have mismatches with the IHV sequence at the alanine
(A) and leucine (L) codons (Block positions 5 and 7,
respectively; Figure 5B) and the "QAHNA" primer mismatches at three codon positions (Block positions 13–15;
Figure 5B), all within the 3' degenerate cores. Figure 8
shows the presence of nucleotide mismatches with the
IHV sequence throughout the different primers (black
highlighting). Thus, the lack of the "KGV" motif and
sequence differences in the "DFA" primer strongly biased
the "TGV-IYG" assay against IHV-like herpesvirus
sequences. In order to identify IHV-like herpesviruses,
new primers would have to incorporate these sequence
differences.

Virology Journal 2005, 2:20

The "DFA" and "DFASA" primer pools were originally
designed using only the alanine (A) codon at block position 5 in the "DFAS" motif and did not include the
glutamine (Q) codon found in that position of the motif
in HHV6 and HHV7, "DFQS" (highlighted, Figure 5A, B).
The nucleotide mismatches in this region are shown in
Figure 8. While the "DFA" and "DFASA" primers are
biased by design against HHV6 and HHV7, they have
been used successfully to detect betaherpesviruses related
to HHV6 and HHV7 [8]. This suggests that mismatches
13–14 nucleotides from the 3' end of the primer, do not
have major affects on the utility of the primers, especially
when viral template is not limiting.
More significant bias against HHV6- and HHV7-like herpesviruses was present in the "TGV" primer used in conjunction with the "IYG" primer in the secondary nested
PCR reaction in the "TGV-IYG" assay (see Figure 2B). The
"TGV" primer contains the partial valine (V) codon "GT"
at its 3' end (Block position 11; Figure 3C). Since both
HHV6 and HHV7 contain alanine (A) (codon = GCN) at
this position (highlighted in Fig. 3A, B), the "TGV" primer
would mismatch at the 3' terminal nucleotide with both
HHV6- and HHV7-like sequences. This mismatch occurs
at the 3' end of the "TGV" primer and is predicted to significantly impair polymerase extension. To remove this
bias, the "TGV" primer was redesigned as the "VYGA"
primer removing the 3' terminal "GT" of the valine codon
and the terminal degenerate position of the glycine (G)
codon. The "TGV" primer contained an additional bias
against amplification of HHV6-like sequences due to the
use of only the phenylalanine (F) codons (TTY) (Block
position 8) at a position encoding valine (V) in both
HHV6 and HHV7 (highlighted in Figure 3A and 3B). To
remove this bias, "VYGA" was designed to include both
the valine (V) and (F) codons at this position. The total
degeneracy of the "TGV" and "VYGA" primer pools
remained the same, with 256 different primers, due to the
loss of the degenerate codon position in the glycine, block
position 10 in "TGV" and the gain of the degenerate
codon positions in the valine, block position 8 in
"VYGA".
The subsequent cloning and sequence analysis of new herpesvirus DNA polymerases from the rhadinoviruses, rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV) and alcelaphine herpesvirus 1
(AlHV1) [20,21], revealed mismatches with the
downstream "IYG" primer of the "TVG-IYG" herpesvirus
assay. The "IYG" primer (a reverse orientation primer)
includes the codons (ATH) for isoleucine (I) at its 3' end
(Block position 1; Figure 4C). Both RRV and AH1 contain
a valine (V) codon (GTN) at this position (highlighted in
Figure 4A). Thus, "IYG" is biased against RRV-like or AH1like rhadinoviruses due to a T-C mismatch at the 3' end of
the primer. To eliminate this bias, the "IYG" primer was

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/20

redesigned as "GDTD1B" to remove the isoleucine position within the 3' degenerate core (Figure 4C) and, in
addition, the length of the 5' consensus clamp was
increased.
Decrease in size of the amplification products
Because typical tissue samples especially paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissue contain degraded DNA with
sizes averaging near 300–500 bp in length, we decided to
decrease the maximal amplification product size of the
herpesvirus assay. The initial amplification product of the
"TGV-IYG" assay (DFA-KG1) was ~800 bp (Fig. 2B). To
reduce the initial amplification product size, a heminested PCR assay was developed in which the newly
designed downstream anti-sense primer "GDTD1B" targeting the highly conserved "YGDT" motif was used in a
primary PCR amplification with the new upstream primer
"DFASA". This amplification yields an approximate 500
bp PCR product (Figure 2B). This initial PCR product is
then used as template in a secondary PCR amplification
using the nested primer "VYGA" with the downstream
anti-sense primer "GDTD1B". This amplification yields a
PCR product of approximately 200 bp (see Figure 2B).
These modifications produce amplification products close
to the average size of degraded DNA present in fixed
tissue.

The "DFASA/QAHNA-GDTD1B" herpesvirus
assay: a refinement of the "TGV-IYG" assay
We have developed a refined herpesvirus assay using the
optimized DNA polymerase CODEHOP PCR primers,
discussed above. This assay was designed to use only three
CODEHOPs in a hemi-nested PCR assay in which
"DFASA" and "GDTD1B" are used in an initial PCR amplification (Figure 2B). The product from that amplification
is used as template in a secondary amplification with
"VYGA" and the original anti-sense primer "GDTD1B". A
variation of this assay uses the "QAHNA" to replace
"DFASA". Thus, the amplification of novel polymerase
sequences required the conservation of only three motifs,
rather than five in the original "TGV-IYG" assay. Using
these assays, we have identified three novel homologs of
the newly characterized human herpesvirus, KSHV, in two
species of macaques [9] (see Table 1, RFHVMn, RFHVMm
and MneRV2). Phylogenetic analysis of the molecular
sequences obtained from these studies provided strong
evidence for the existence of two distinct lineages of γ2
rhadinoviruses related to KSHV, called rhadinovirus-1
(RV1) and rhadinovirus-2 (RV2) (Figure 9) [10].
Subsequent studies by others using this assay, have identified the presence of additional members of these two lineages in other Old World primates, including African
green monkeys [19], mandrills [22], chimpanzees [23,24]
and gorillas [24] (see Additional File 1). This data predicts
the existence of another human herpesvirus closely

length) from 25 different herpesvirus species identified using either the "DFA-IYG", "DFASA-GDTD1B", or QAHNA-GDTD1B

related to KSHV belonging to the RV-2 lineage of rhadinoviruses [10].
The utility of the "DFASA/QAHNA-GDTD1B" assays has
been demonstrated by these and other studies in which
more than 19 novel herpesviruses from the alpha, beta
and gamma subfamilies of a wide variety of host species

have been identified and molecularly characterized using
CODEHOPs (Tables 2 and 3). Comparison of the amino
acid sequences encoded between the "DFAS" and "IYG/
GDTD" motifs has allowed the phylogenetic comparison
of the different herpesvirus species from which these
sequences were obtained. Figure 9 shows a phylogenetic
tree resulting from the analysis of the sequences obtained

and abbreviations are usually derived from the original publications although some have been modified to conform to a three letter code
derived from the first letter of the genus and the first two letters of the species, ie. Macaca mulatta = Mmu. This was necessary due to the number of
different viral species and hosts which could not be distinguished with a two letter code.

from the "DFA-IYG", and "DFASA/QAHNA-GDTD1B"
assays and the corresponding sequences of six representative human herpesviruses. Multiple sequence alignments
of the viral sequences were performed and the positions
containing gaps were eliminated, leaving 142 amino acid
positions for comparison. These sequences were analyzed
using protein distances and neighbor-joining analysis
implemented in the Phylip analysis package [15]. As
shown in Figure 9, most of the different viral species could
be unambiguously included within either of the three herpesvirus subfamilies as indicated by the high bootstrap
scores obtained for most of the branch points. However,
the positioning of the branch points for certain viral species could not be reliably determined using the available
sequence information. Such uncertainty has been seen in
similar analysis of specific herpesvirus species using much
larger data sets [18]. The results obtained using the 142
amino acid comparisons confirmed and extended the
phylogenic relationships predicted from the "TVG-IYG"
results derived from only 53 amino acid comparisons.
Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships predicted by
the different CODEHOP assays have been subsequently

confirmed when substantially more sequence information was obtained from the new viral species, see [10,11].
The phylogenetic relationships shown in Figure 9 are consistent with the findings that extensive cospeciation of
viral species and their host lineages has occurred during
evolution [18]. The wide variety of different herpesvirus
species identified using the CODEHOPs assays targeting
the DNA polymerase gene, as shown in Figures 7 and 9,
indicate the wide applicability of the CODEHOPs assays
to detect herpesviruses from disparate host lineages.

The "SLYP1A-GDTD1B" herpesvirus assay: a
general herpesvirus detection assay
We designed additional primers from the DFAS/QAHN
sequence motif using the CODEHOP strategy to develop
further assays to detect new herpesviruses. The primer
"SLYP1A" was one such primer designed to eliminate bias
in the 3' degenerate core of "DFA" and "DFASA" primers
against HHV6 and HHV7, described above. The "SLYP1A"
primer overlaps the "DFA" and "DFASA" primers and
extends further downstream in a region very well
conserved across the different herpesvirus species includ-

ing HHV6 and HHV7 (Block positions 8–12; Figure 5C)
[10]. Primer design across this region was based on the
similarities in the first two positions for the codons for
isoleucine (I) – (ATA, ATC, ATT) and methionine (M) –
(ATG). These two amino acids are conserved in two
positions within this sequence block in all herpesvirus
species, including IHV (Block positions 11,12; Figure 5)
and provide the penultimate and ultimate 3' codons for
the primer. Also, the SLYP1A primer was designed with
only one of the two codon types utilized for serine (S) –
(AGY) to minimize degeneracy in the 3' degenerate core
(Block position 10; Figure 5C). Serine at this position
(Block position 10; Figure 8) is encoded by AGY-type

codons in all herpesvirus species, except for CMV-like herpesviruses which use TCN-type codons and EHV2 which
contains a codon for threonine. A second related primer,
SLYP2A was also designed from this region with an identical sequence except that the other serine codons (TCN)
were used in the third position. Although this primer was
biased for CMV-like sequences, we have successfully
amplified KSHV which contains an AGT codon (unpublished results).
We have previously used "SLYP1A" and "GDTD1B" to
identify a new herpesvirus related to RRV, called Macaca
nemestrina rhadinovirus-2 (MneRV2) in spleen tissue [10].

Amino acid sequence comparision of two rhesus macaque EBV homologs detected using the "SLYP1AGDTD1B" CODEHOP assay Positions with identity to human EBV are shown as a (.), and unidentified flanking regions or
inserted gaps are indicated as (-). Numbering is from the human EBV DNA polymerase sequence. M. mulatta-1 and M. mulatta2 sequences are listed in Table 1 as MmuLCV1 and MmuLCV2. The Macaca fascicularis, African green monkey (Chlorocebus
aethiops) and baboon (Papio hamadryas) EBV-like sequences were published in [33] but not deposited in Genbank. The marmoset EBV-like sequence was deposited in Genbank as a AF291653 [34].

We subsequently used this assay to screen for herpesviruses in lymphomas from two rhesus macaques, L758 and
881, from the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center.
DNA was kindly provided by LS Levy. Strong PCR products were obtained in primary amplification reactions and
were cloned and sequenced. The lymphoma from rhesus
881 yielded clones containing a single sequence which
was highly related to human EBV. From the lymphoma
from rhesus L758, we obtained two distinct EBV-like
sequences, one which was identical to the first lymphoma
sequence and the other one which contained 10 nucleotide differences across the 475 bp fragment (98% identity). Analysis of the encoded amino acids revealed 3
amino acid differences (98% identity) between the two
rhesus EBV-like sequences (MmuLCV1 and MmuLCV2)
(Figure 10). These sequences clustered closely with
human EBV in the γ1 branch of the phylogenetic tree
shown in Figure 9. The identification of DNA polymerases
from two types of EBV-like lymphocryptoviruses corroborates previous reports of the existence of two closely
related lymphocryptoviruses in rhesus macaques [25]
identified by sequence comparision of two distinct EBNA2 genes. This is similar to the situation in humans where
two different EBV species, EBV1 and EBV2 have been identified [26].

Using the CODEHOP strategy to determine the
complete sequence of novel viral genes
The CODEHOP assays described above targeted a
restricted region of one gene and only provided limited
sequence information. We have also used CODEHOPs to
obtain the complete sequence of targeted genes and iden-

tify flanking genes within the unknown viral genome. To
obtain the complete sequences of the DNA polymerase
genes of the newly identified herpesvirus species of
macaques, RFHVMn and RFHVMm, we designed CODEHOP PCR primers from additional conserved sequence
blocks within the DNA polymerase (Figure 11 and Table
4). The new DNA polymerase-derived CODEHOP PCR
primers, "CVNVA" and "YFDKB" were used in conjunction with gene specific primers derived from within the
sequence of the original CODEHOP PCR product
"DFASA-GDTD1B to obtain overlapping PCR products
across the majority of the DNA polymerase gene [10]. In
all gammaherpesviruses, the DNA polymerase gene (ORF
9) is flanked upstream by ORF 8, the glycoprotein B, the
most highly conserved glycoprotein in herpesviruses and
downstream by ORF 10, a gene conserved within the gammaherpesviruses with unknown function (Figure 11).
CODEHOPs were designed from conserved sequence
blocks present in ORF 8 – "FREYA" and "GGMA" and in
ORF 10 "GDWE2B" (Table 4). Using a combination of
gene-specific primers obtained from the DNA polymerase
sequence obtained above and the new CODEHOPs
derived from flanking regions, overlapping PCR products
spanning 331 bp of the glycoprotein B genes, 3,039 bp of
the DNA polymerase genes, and 27 bp of the ORF 10 gene
homolog were obtained for RFHVMn and RFHVMm [10].

Using the CODEHOP strategy to characterize
genomic regions within novel viral genomes
Often the linear order of genes within the genomes of
related viruses is maintained. Thus, the spacing and orientation of specific genes can be predicted in the genomes of

utilized to obtain sequences within conserved genes

primers derived from these sequences can then used in
long-range PCR to obtain the sequence of the entire

genomic region between the flanking genes. We have utilized this approach to clone and characterize a portion of
the divergent locus B of the genome of the macaque rhadinovirus, RFHVMn [11]. Divergent locus B was identified
in KSHV and other rhadinoviruses and contains a number

of viral homologs of cellular genes that have been captured during virus evolution [27]. Part of the divergent
locus B of KSHV extends upstream of the ORF 9 DNA
polymerase gene to a viral homolog of the thymidylate
synthase (TS) gene situated approximately 4 kb away (Figure 12A). TS is a cellular gene and a non-functional pseudogene is present in humans. Viral TS homologs are well
conserved and are found in several herpesvirus species,
including KSHV, VZV, EHV2, HVS and AtHV3. To characterize the putative divergent locus B between the DNA
polymerase and TS genes of RFHVMn, we targeted the TS
gene for PCR amplification using the CODEHOP
approach.
Two conserved blocks of amino acids within the TS gene
family containing 10 and 11 identical amino acids were
chosen as candidates for CODEHOP design. The 10
amino acid "RHFG" upstream motif (Fig. 13) is completely conserved between the viral sequences, the human
sequence and the human TS pseudogene. The 11 amino
acid "DMGL" downstream motif (Fig. 13) while completely conserved between the viral and human sequences
is not present in the cellular TS pseudogene (data not
shown). Since the two motifs in the cellular TS gene are
separated from each other by a large intron, CODEHOP
PCR amplification of DNA containing a mixture of viral

and cellular DNA should only produce a virus-specific
~280 bp PCR product (Fig. 12B).
The design of the "DMGLB" CODEHOP from the conserved "DMGL" motif is shown in Figure 14. This primer
was designed before the CODEHOP prediction program
was available. Because RFHVMn is closely related to the
gammaherpesvirus, KSHV, the "DMGLB" CODEHOP was
biased towards gammaherpesviruses, in particular KSHVlike herpesviruses, in order to target the RFHV genomes.
In Figure 14, the nucleotide sequences encoding the
"DMGL" motif from the TS genes of KSHV, HVS and
EHV2 were multiply aligned with the encoded amino acid
sequence. Because "DMGL" was the downstream motif,
the "DMGLB" CODEHOP was designed to be antisense,
however, the complementary sequence of the primer is
shown to identify codons (Figure 14). Thus, the degenerate core of the CODEHOP spans the codons for the aspartic acid (D), methionine (M), glycine (G), and leucine (L)
of the motif, and is indicated in lower case letters in Figure
14B. The degenerate core provides all possibilities of the
codons for these four conserved amino acids and thus has
no bias. However, the nucleotides within the consensus
region, shown in capitol letters, were chosen at each
codon position to be similar to the sequence of KSHV
(highlighted in Figure 14A), thus biasing the primer
towards KSHV-like sequences.
The TS targeted CODEHOPs "DMGLB" and "RHFGA"
(see Table 5) were used in PCR amplification reactions
with DNA isolated from retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF)
tumor tissue of a pig-tailed macaque, Macaca nemestrina,
as described previously [10]. A PCR product of the
predicted size (280 bp) was obtained and cloned and
sequenced, see Fig. 12B. The sequence was 68% identical
to the KSHV TS sequence and 64% identical to the TS
sequence of RRV, a more distantly related gammaherpesvirus. A TS-specific primer, TSR1LR, derived from this
sequence and a DNA polymerase-specific primer,
PolF1LR, were chosen to amplify the region between the
DNA polymerase and TS genes of RFHV (Table 5 and Figure 12B). Long range PCR amplification produced a PCR
product of ~4.1 kb which was sequenced. The linear order
and sequence of 5 novel genes present in the diverse
region B of the RFHVMn virus was obtained (Figure 12C).
Although region B of RFHV lacked a homolog of KSHV
ORF 11, homologs of all the other KSHV genes in this
region were present and in the same order within the
genome [10].

Alignment of CODEHOPs with the nucleotide sequences of the "DMGL" motif in several herpesvirus TS
genes. A) Nucleotide sequences encoding the "DMGL" motif in several rhadinoviruses. B) Complementary sequences of
CODEHOP PCR primers derived from the "DMGL" motif. The sequence of the complementary strand of the primer is shown
to identify the coding sequence. The actual PCR primer is the complement of the sequence. DMGLB was biased towards
KSHV-like sequences by using the codons from the KSHV TS gene in the 5' clamp region of the primer with KSHV-specific
nucleotides highlighted (3' region of the complementary coding strand shown). DMGLXB was predicted from the amino acid
sequence block of the conserved "DMGL" motif using the CODEHOP software and utilizes the most common human codons
for the amino acids in the 5' clamp region, and is unbiased in design. The underlined sequence in the 5' clamp region can form a
stem-loop structure, shown in C. The CODEHOP PCR primer, DMGLX1B, is a revised version of DMGLXB to eliminate base
pairing in the stem-loop structure by changing the highlighted cytosine (C) in Fig. 13-C. to an adenosine (A), boxed in Fig. 13-B.

been discussed in detail. However, CODEHOP-mediated
PCR can also be used to target conserved genes from other
virus families. A general flowchart detailing the specific
steps involved in the CODEHOP procedure to identify
novel viral genes is shown in Figure 15. This procedure is
based on the CODEHOP prediction software that we have
previously developed and made accessible over the internet as part of the BLOCKS database [2]. An example of this
procedure is provided below where CODEHOP PCR
primers targeting the "DMGL" motif of herpesvirus TS
genes (introduced above) are designed using the webbased software.

Using the web-based software to design CODEHOP PCR
primers to a conserved viral gene
The amino acid sequences of the TS genes from five herpesviruses were obtained using BLAST analysis of the
NCBI protein database with the KSHV TS sequence as
probe. The TS sequences from KSHV, VZV, EHV2, HVS
and AtHV3 (Figure 16) were provided as input to ClustalW [28] and a multiple alignment was obtained. As
shown in Figure 13, several regions of highly conserved
sequences were present in the TS sequence alignment, and
the positions of the "RHFG" and "DMGL" motifs targeted
above are indicated. In order to predict CODEHOP PCR
primers, the sequences of the TS genes were provided as
input to the BlockMaker program of the Blocks Database
[4] and a series of conserved sequence blocks were

region was elongated by increasing the temperature
setting from the default 60°C to 70°C. The primers predicted from the complement of Block_E were examined in
order to obtain a primer from the complementary strand
which could be used in conjunction with the upstream TS
primer RHFGA, described above. The underlined primer
targeting the "DMGL" motif was chosen and named
DMGLXB (Figure 18) and was compared with the manually designed DMGLB primer in Figure 14. Whereas
"DMGLB" was purposefully biased by using the KSHV
sequences in the 5' consensus clamp, the "DMGLXB" is
"unbiased" in design with the 5' consensus sequence
derived from the most frequently used codons in the
human genome. The DMGLXB sequence was examined
for potential stem loop structures that could compromise
the function of the primer. As shown in Figure 14, a puta-

tive stem-loop structure was identified which is indicated
by the underlined nucleotides in Figure 14B and 14C. To
destablize this structure, the proline codon within the
"DMGLGVP" motif was changed from the computer predicted "CCC", the most frequently used codon in
humans, to "CCA", another common human codon, as
shown in Figure 14. This yielded a revised CODEHOP,
called "DMGLX1B" (shown as the complementary
sequence in Figures 14B and 14C), in which the stemloop structure was destabilized by substituting an A for
the highlighted C in Figure 14C. The DMGLX1B antisense
primer could then be used in combination with the
RHFGA sense primer to amplify unknown TS genes.

The predicted consensus amino acid sequence is shown and the DMGL motif is underlined in bold. The complementary strand

polymerase sequences using the Web-based CODEHOP
software are shown in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6. The VYG1A
primer designed from the conserved VYG motif shown in
Figure 3 is aligned with the original manually designed
"TGV" and "VYGA" primers. The computer-predicted
"YGDTB" primer designed from the conserved GDTD
motif is aligned with the original "IYG" and "GDTD1B"
primers (Figure 4). In the prediction of this primer, the
conserved sequence block identified by BlockMaker from
the sequences shown in Figure 4A, extended only from
amino acid position 1 – 10, which was the limit of the
conserved sequence block determined by BlockMaker.
The CODEHOP software indicated the necessity to add
additional nucleotides to the 5' end of the "YGDTB"
primer to obtain the minimal length for the 5' consensus
region of the primer. As such, the amino acid sequences of
block positions 11–13 were obtained manually and compared in order to derive the eight terminal nucleotides for
"YGDTB" (overlined in Figure 4C).

Conclusion
In this review, the utility of CODEHOP-mediated PCR for
the identification of novel viruses and the characterization
of new viral genes and genomic regions is presented.
While the focus of this study was on the herpesvirus family, other virus families can be easily targeted using analogous approaches. We have previously developed
successful CODEHOP assays targeting the reverse tran-

scriptase genes of retroviruses and lentiviruses [2,6].
Recently, the CODEHOP strategy has been used to
develop assays to detect novel papillomaviruses targeting
the highly conserved L1 protein [30]. With the CODEHOP strategy, molecular sequence data can be readily
obtained for comprehensive virus phylogenies and tracing
of evolutionary pathways. Furthermore, comparison of
multiple representatives of homologous viral proteins can
be of importance for understanding the protein structure
and function and provided insight into virus-host
relationships.
