Abstract
Background: The causal mechanisms of differential disease progression in HIV-1 infected children remain poorly
defined, and much of the accumulated knowledge comes from studies of subtype B infected individuals. The applicability
of such findings to other subtypes, such as subtype C, remains to be substantiated. In this study, we longitudinally
characterized the evolution of the Env V1–V5 region from seven subtype C HIV-1 perinatally infected children with
different clinical outcomes. We investigated the possible influence of viral genotype and humoral immune response on
disease progression in infants.
Results: Genetic analyses revealed that rapid progressors (infants that died in the first year of life) received and
maintained a genetically homogeneous viral population throughout the disease course. In contrast, slow progressors
(infants that remained clinically asymptomatic for up to four years) also exhibited low levels variation initially, but attained
higher levels of diversity over time. Genetic assessment of variation, as indicated by dN/dS, showed that particular regions
of Env undergo selective changes. Nevertheless, the magnitude and distribution of these changes did not segregate slow
and rapid progressors. Longitudinal trends in Env V1–V5 length and the number of potential N-glycosylation sites varied
among patients but also failed to discriminate between fast and slow progressors. Viral isolates from rapid progressors
and slow progressors displayed no significant growth properties differences in vitro. The neutralizing activity in maternal
and infant baseline plasma also varied in its effectiveness against the initial virus from the infants but did not differentiate
rapid from slow progressors. Quantification of the neutralization susceptibility of the initial infant viral isolates to
maternal baseline plasma indicated that both sensitive and resistant viruses were transmitted, irrespective of disease
course. We showed that humoral immunity, whether passively acquired or developed de novo in the infected children,
varied but was not predictive of disease progression.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that neither genetic variation in env, or initial maternal neutralizing activity, or the level
of passively acquired neutralizing antibody, or the level of the de novo neutralization response appear to be linked to
differences in disease progression in subtype C HIV-1 infected children.

Background
Mother to child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the primary mode of
pediatric HIV-1 infection [1] in sub-Saharan Africa. In this
region, HIV-1 subtype C accounts for approximately 50%
of infections. Pediatric HIV-1 disease progression has
been most intensively studied for subtype B virus infections where it was found to be bimodal, with 15 to 20 %
of untreated infants progressing rapidly to AIDS and
death by 4 years of age [2], whereas the remaining 80%
progress more slowly [3,4]. The applicability of such findings to other subtypes remains to be substantiated.
HIV-1 disease progression in adults is a complex interplay
between viral factors, host genetics, and host immune
response [5] where all contribute to disease progression
[5-20]. The survival time for HIV-1 infected children is
shorter, on average, than that of infected adults [21], and
could be explained by a number of factors including:
immaturity of their immune system [21], failure to
acquire passive immunity from the mother, timing of
transmission [2,22,23] or maternal HIV-1 RNA levels
[24,25]. Other factors, such as viral replication rate, syncytium-induction, CD4+ T-cell depletion, and thymic infection have been shown to associate with early onset of
pediatric AIDS [25-28]. As in adults, the emergence of X4
variants in infected children has been associated with disease progression [27-29], but this is unlikely to be a causal
factor since most rapidly progressing children harbor
viruses of the R5 phenotype [21]. Moreover, shared HLA
class I alleles between mother and infant was shown to
influence clinical outcome [30]. Humoral immunity has
been suggested to play a role in the disease for both adults
and children, but the function of neutralizing antibody
responses in delaying disease progression or preventing
HIV-1 infection, especially in children, has not been fully
established [5,19,20,31-33].
The determinants of many of the above biological properties map to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) or
associate with Env receptor binding, tropism-definition,
cytopathicity determinants or neutralization susceptibility [34-43], although other HIV-1 genes related to HIV-1
pathogenesis were also described [11,44-50]. Studies on
HIV-1 Env from both infected adults and children have
indicated that viral populations exhibiting high rates of
non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions and high antigen diversity usually associate with broad immune reactivity, slow CD4+ T cell decline, and slow rates of disease
progression [33,51-54]. However, others have shown a
correlation between higher sequence diversity and a more
rapid disease onset [28,32]. Despite various associations
with viral and host parameters, the mechanisms behind
differential disease progression in HIV-1 infected children
remain poorly defined.

As an extension of our efforts to better understand the
characteristics of perinatally transmitted subtype C HIV-1
and to clarify the relationship between viral evolution,
humoral immune responses and disease outcome in
infected children [33], we analyzed the evolution of the
env V1–V5 region from seven perinatally infected children
with different disease courses. We also performed a longitudinal assessment of the infant neutralizing antibody
responses against autologous primary viral isolates from
various time points during disease progression. This study
was designed to investigate the possible influence of
genetic properties of subtype C envelope glycoproteins
and humoral immune response on disease progression in
infants.

Results
Characteristics of seven HIV-1 infected children
The subjects analyzed in this study were part of a mother/
infant cohort followed for HIV-1 infection. Children were
designated as rapid or slow progressors according to clinical assessment of outcome and time of survival. Infants
1449, 2669, 2873, and 2617 were considered rapid progressors since they died within the first year of life, due to
apparent HIV-related complications. Slow progressors
(infants 1984, 1084 and 1690) were followed for more
than four years, and remained clinically asymptomatic for
the duration of the study (Table 1). All children were antiretroviral naïve throughout the study.

HIV-1 isolation was unsuccessful from all baseline (birth)
samples and all infants were HIV PCR negative at birth,
suggesting that they were infected either intrapartum or
postpartum. HIV-1 env sequences were amplified from
infant PBMC at different postpartum timepoints, as indicated in Table 1. Because the amount of sample from
these children was limited, priority was given to virus isolation in lieu of PCR when necessary (e.g., infant 1084,
viral isolation was positive by 4 month and the first PCR
was performed 6 month after birth). A portion of the env
gene from V1–V5 was amplified by PCR, cloned, and
sequenced in order to longitudinally characterize Env
genetic diversification and evolution.
Env sequence analyses
We sequenced a total of 711 infant clones (23 – 48
sequences per timepoint) derived from PBMC genomic
DNA. When all sequences were aligned and included in a
single phylogenetic analysis, sequences from each
mother-infant pair formed a monophyletic group, indicating that maternal and infant sequences were epidemiologically linked (data not shown). Viral subtype
determinations showed that all cases were subtype C in
Env, except for mother-infant-pair 1449 which was a subtype A/C recombinant.

Months after birth (M); number of sequences per time point (N); number of unique haplotypes (H); mean number of pairwise amino acid differences
as percentage (AA %); mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences as percentage (DNA %); ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS)
rate of substitution (dN/dS); number of putative N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) in Env V1–V5 region as median (min-max) and Env V1–V5
length in codons (V1V5 length) as median (min-max)

In all infants, the initial viral populations contained a
reduced repertoire of env sequence variants when compared to the maternal population. These samples exhibited a large fraction of unique haplotypes, but with low
nucleotide diversity, as would be expected in populations
increasing in effective size from a limited set of founders
(Table 1). Haplotype diversity (H/N in Table 1), an index
of the number and relative frequency of unique
sequences, ranged between 0.9 and 1.0, its maximum
value, but average genetic distances within each sample
remained low throughout the study (DNA % in Table 1).
Mean genetic distance (DNA% in Table 1) were lower at
the earliest time points, where they ranged from 0.3 to
1.2%, while for the latest, mean genetic distances ranged
from 0.5 to 4.9 %. Representative phylogenetic analyses
from a rapid progressor (1449) and a slow progressor
(1984) are shown in Figure 1. Results from the different
phylogenetic analyses for each mother-infant-pair were
congruent among themselves, despite differences in the
methods or weighting schemes used. In all cases, the

results suggest that infections were established by highly
homogeneous populations, with little phylogenetic structure among early sequences. In the case of fast-progressors, the diversity observed in different longitudinal
samples taken from the infant was low relative to the
mother, as indicated by the shorter branches leading to
infant sequences when compared to the mother. A similar
pattern can be observed for the earlier sequences of slowprogressors. Later time-point samples display longer
branches in the phylogeny, as mutations accumulate and
infant Env sequence diversity increases. It is important to
note that trees from rapid and slow progressor were indistinguishable when analyses were restricted to sequences
collected within 12 months after birth.
Similar patterns of variation were observed at the amino
acid level, although levels of polymorphism were higher
relative to variation at the nucleotide level. Mean amino
acid differences (AA% in Table 1) within the initial populations ranged from 0.6 to 2.4 % for the earliest samples,

and from 1.0 to 8.9% for the later time-point samples.
Mean genetic distance (DNA % in Table 1) within contemporaneous sequences were lower in rapid progressors
than in slow progressors (Table 1), but this difference was
not statistically significant. There was a trend towards
increased levels of genetic diversity as time progressed,
with some refractory periods. Accordingly, we observed
the highest levels of genetic diversity (DNA% in Table 1)
in samples collected at the latest time points in slow progressors (Table 1, 48- month samples from infants 1084,
1690 and 1984). However, the rates of change in genetic
diversity and genetic divergence were similar for all
patients (data not shown), although sample sizes precluded statistical tests of this observation.

Positive Darwinian selection is indicated when the estimated ratio of non-synonymous changes to synonymous
changes (dN/dS) >1. We observed high dN/dS values for
the env gene (Table 1), suggesting that positive selection
was occurring in the infant env genes. The values ranged
from 0.41 to 1.37, with a mean of 0.78 (Table 1). The significance of this finding is that higher dN/dS values have
been linked to longer survival, and presumably, a higher
dN/dS value is a consequence of a stronger and/or broader
immune response [20,55]. In the three slow progressor
infants there was at least one time point where the dN/dS
> 1; whereas a dN/dS > 1 was detected in only one of the
rapid progressor infants (1449), but it is possible that this
is a function of the duration of infection. Indeed, while we

Retrovirology 2006, 3:73

observed a higher level of non-synonymous substitutions
in slow progressors (mean = 0.89) versus rapid progressors (mean = 0.78), this difference was not statistically significant.
To temporally and positionally visualize where non-synonymous changes occurred relative to 'constant' and 'variable' domains, as defined in subtype B, we compared the
infant amino acid sequences to an alignment of HIV-1
HXB2 and the solved SIV glycoprotein structure by Chen
et al. [56]. One representative infant from each group is
shown in Figure 2. For clarity and ease of comparison to
the rapid progressor infant 1449, we have separated the
early time points from the complete analysis of slow progressor infant 1984. Inspection of the variation from both
rapid and slow progressors revealed several common
regions of the env sequence with high levels of non-synonymous variation and indicated that the C2 domain was
the least variable, whereas the most variable areas were the
V1–V2 loop, the 3' end of the C2 region, the V3 loop, the
5' end of C3, and the variable loops V4 and V5 (Figure 2).
In addition, the variable loops V1–V2, V4 and V5 concentrated most of the indels observed. Comparison of 1449
and 1984 at similar time points (Figure 2, top and middle
panels), revealed changes located in corresponding
regions (e.g. V4 and V5), but there were also changes
unique to either 1449 or 1984 (e.g. the 5' end of V1–V2 in
1449). Unfortunately, this study is not able to establish
whether the unique mutations observed in 1449 are associated with rapid disease progression. There is also an
accumulation of non-synonymous changes with time,
particularly evident in 1984 where changes at many positions are cumulative, implying continued selection operating on positions over an extended time period (Figure 2,
middle and lower panels). Whether this indicates immunological pressure or functional constraints for fitness
remains to be determined. In contrast, for 1449 (Figure 2,
top panel), a number of changes appear at only one timepoint with no previous evidence of selection at that position.
Taken together, the higher diversity associated with later
time points, in combination with the observed accumulation of amino acid substitutions in putatively exposed
regions of the glycoprotein indicate that selective pressures, including humoral immunity, may be playing a
substantial role in driving Env evolution.
V1–V5 length and putative glycosylation sites
The number of putative N-linked glycosylation sites
(PNGS) and Env domain length have been hypothesized
to modulate HIV-1 sensitivity to neutralization and to
impact likelihood of transmission [57,58]. According to
this hypothesis, shorter variants with fewer PNGS are
expected in the earlier time-points, they have higher trans-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/73

mission fitness as the immune response of the recipient is
still not developed; longer V1–V5 forms with more PNGS
are expected to evolve at later time-points in response to
increased and prolonged immune pressure. Longitudinal
data including range and median values for Env V1–V5
length and PNGS are presented in Table 1, and the trend
in median values in Figure 3. Rapid progressors exhibit a
large range in both PNGS and V1–V5 length, with minor
longitudinal changes during a period of up to 8 months
postpartum. The number of PNGS is positively correlated
with sequence length in these cases. Slow progressors
show a tendency to increase (1984 and 1084) or decrease
(1690) the number of PNGS with time, but the range of
variation falls within the range observed for fast progressors (Figure 3, top panel). The same pattern is observed
for longitudinal variation in V1–V5 length (Figure 3, bottom panel). Overall, no clear trend was observed as would
be suggested by the predictions [57,58], and the values for
these parameters did not differ between fast and slow progressors.
Co-receptor usage and cell tropism
Since co-receptor usage switches to an X4-utilization phenotype with disease progression in some adults and children, we evaluated co-receptor usage and phenotype of
viral isolates from the two groups. We found that all viral
isolates exclusively used CCR5 as a co-receptor (Table 1),
exhibited macrophage-tropism, and did not infect T cell
lines or form syncytia in vitro. The only exception was the
48-month isolate from infant 1690. For 1690, R5 coreceptor tropism was maintained until 42 months; after
this time, the viral isolate exhibited dual X4/R5 co-receptor usage (Table 1), and infected both macrophages and
MT-2 T lymphoblasts, where it formed syncytia (data not
shown). To date, this is the only X4-utilizing virus isolated
from our cohort, implying that while X4-utilizing subtype
C HIV-1 can develop in patients, such development is
uncommon and disease pathogenesis is not dependent on
such phenotypic switches. To test whether the characterized subtype C Env sequences possessed co-receptor usage
properties consistent with those defined for the virus isolated by co-culture, we generated Env chimeras by introducing the subtype C V1–V5 region into a subtype B NL43 Env expression vector. The chimeric Env constructs were
then used to make pseudoviruses for evaluation of coreceptor usage in Ghost cell lines that express different coreceptors. All chimeras tested exhibited CCR5 tropism
and lacked appreciable X4 tropism (data not shown).
These findings are consistent with those obtained from
experiments using primary isolates.
Neutralization capacity of the baseline mother and infant
plasma for the first infant viral isolate
Since maternal anti-HIV antibodies are transmitted from
mother to infant, it is possible that they play a role in the

selection of transmitted viruses and affect the disease
course in the child. Therefore, we evaluated maternal and
infant neutralizing antibody (Nab) titer at birth against
the first infant viral isolate. The level of Nab was determined from the rapid (infants 1449, 2669 and 2873) and
slow progressors (infants 1084 and 1984), as well as one
slow progressor (infant 1157) described previously [33].
For rapid progressors, the first viral isolation was 2
months after birth, whereas the first viral isolates in the
slow progressors are from 4 months (1084 infant) or 6
months (infant1157 and 1984). Our results (Table 2)
indicate that the level of infant baseline Nab against
infant first viral isolates was lower than the maternal baseline, implying that only a subset of the maternal neutralizing antibody was acquired by their infants. Comparison
of the baseline Nab level between the corresponding
mother and infant from each pair indicated that there is a
direct correlation between the level of maternal Nab and
the level of Nab passively transferred to their infants.
Mothers with the low baseline Nab transferred the least

Nab to their infants. But the level of Nab in either the
maternal or the infant baseline plasma failed to differentiate rapid and slow progressors. For example, 88% neutralization by maternal baseline plasma was observed in
one rapid (1449) and one slow (1157) progressor, respectively; whereas, in other cases, maternal baseline plasma
from both rapid and slow progressors failed to effectively
neutralize the earliest infant virus (infant 2873 vs.1984).
Similarly, the neutralization capacity of the infants'
plasma at birth against their first viral isolates does not
differentiate the two groups. For example, both 2873
(rapid) and 1984 (slow) lack detectable Nab for their first
viral isolates at birth.
Longitudinal humoral immune responses of infected
children
To further characterize the infant antibody responses, we
quantified neutralization by autologous sera from various
timepoints for the first and last viral isolates from both
groups. The neutralization profiles of two representatives
from each group are shown in Figure 4. For the rapid progressors (1449 and 2669), we observed variability in the
baseline neutralizing antibody activities acquired from
the mother (Figure 4A). In 1449, the initial activity against
the earliest virus (78% neutralization) declined, prior to
the initiation of a de novo infant humoral immune
response near the time of the first virus isolation, which
rose thereafter. Whereas, in 2669, the maternal transfer
was less effective (only 45 % neutralization), but the
infant de novo neutralizing response was evident by two
months since the neutralization was higher than baseline.
The de novo development and maintenance of effective
neutralization against the 2-month viral isolates appeared
early in both cases and increased in activity until the end
of follow-up (Figure 4A). In contrast, neutralizing antibodies against the late viral isolates (8 months for 1449; 6

months for 2669) were lower in magnitude and decreased
throughout the disease course (Figure 4A).
Similarly, the autologous plasma neutralization of slow
progressor infant early (4 or 6-month) and late (48month) viral isolates was evaluated, and two representatives (1984 and 1084) are shown in Figure 4B. In the slow
progressor 1084, a substantial amount of Nab was
detected at birth, but decayed to zero by six months. Subsequently, the child developed an effective neutralizing
response against both the earliest virus and the contemporaneous (12 and 48-month) viruses. In contrast, slow progressor 1984 received no detectable Nab from the mother,
but mounted an effective neutralizing response by 6
months whose magnitude was directly correlated with the
timepoint of virus isolation, with 6-month virus being
more effectively neutralized than 12 and 48-month
viruses. It is apparent that in slow progressors there are
infants who passively acquired neutralizing activity
(1084), while others (1984) did not. Therefore, it is
unlikely that rapid progression is due to receipt of lower
maternal Nab, or that slow progression is due to acquisition of high level of maternal Nab or the development of
a higher or more durable de novo humoral response.
Replication of viral isolates from both rapid and slow
progressors
In order to determine whether there are differences in the
rates of replication among the viral isolates from rapid
and slow progressors, the replication of the first viral isolates (slow progressor only) and last viral isolates (all 7
infected children) in PBMC was determined (Figure 5).
The titer (TCID50/ml) of the last viral isolates from all
rapid progressors (4, 6 or 8-month after birth) displayed
steady increase after 5 or 9 days incubation and peaked by
9 (infant 2669 and 2873), 13 (infant 2617) or 17 (infant
1449) days (Figure 5A). For slow progressors, the first viral
isolates (6-month for 1984, 4-month for 1084) displayed
similar replication kinetics compared to the rapid progressors. However, when comparing the first and last viral isolates from the slow progressors, the late viruses (48month for infants1984, 1084 and 1690) showed a slightly
more rapid replication kinetics than the early viruses, with
a peak value by 13 days, while the late viruses peaked by
9 days (Figure 5B).

Discussion
Longitudinal changes in viral genetic variation, immune
responses, and disease progression have rarely been investigated in HIV-1 subtype C infected children. We have previously characterized the evolution of the Env C2-V4
region of subtype C HIV-1 and the humoral immune
response from one infected infant. In the present study,
we expanded our study by correlating the changes of the
Env longitudinally with disease outcome, in seven chil-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/73

dren, divided into two groups based on rapid or slow disease progression. In addition, with these two groups, we
were able to examine the contribution of Env length and
glycosylation in disease progression, and the role of
humoral immunity, both passively acquired and developed de novo, to clinical outcomes.
Phylogenetic analyses show that maternal and infant
viruses were epidemiologically linked in each of the seven
pairs, and support the concept that selective transmission
occurred [33,59-61]. Rapid progressors, those who died in
the first 12 months, received and maintained a genetically
homogeneous viral population throughout the short disease course. Slow progressors initially also exhibited low
levels of variation, but attained higher levels of diversity
over time. These findings are consistent with previous
studies that showed higher genetic diversity associated
with slow disease progression in children [33,53,54].
In both groups of children, a large number of unique, but
closely related haplotypes were sampled, matching predictions for a population that was exponentially growing
in size from a homogeneous starting point. Estimates of
dN/dS can be used to determine whether selective pressure, in addition to expanding population size, played a
role in the diversification of the infant viral populations.
Our data show that dN/dS values were high in all 7 individuals, exceeding 1.0 in 7 of 24 populations sampled.
Values of dN/dS greater than 1.0 provide evidence of positive Dawinian selection [62].
One of the primary selective pressures acting on Env is
neutralizing antibody. The earliest infant Nab responses
are largely due to passive transfer from the mother. Passively acquired maternal immunity can play a critical role
in protecting infants from infections; however, the specific contribution of maternal or passively-acquired neutralizing antibodies in limiting HIV-1 transmission or
disease progression in children is not well understood.
Our observations indicate that the neutralizing activity in
maternal and infant baseline plasma varied in its effectiveness for the initial infant virus but did not differentiate
rapid from slow progressors. Since our assays for Nab
activity relied on co-cultured virus, and selection during
co-culture may bias the results away from the main phenotype of virus in the original population, the lack of difference between groups should be taken as a tentative
result. Nevertheless, consistent with other findings
[33,63,64], all children developed de novo neutralizing
responses within the first 6 months post-infection regardless of the disease course. But our results show that even
when children develop effective de novo neutralization
responses, they may still progress rapidly (Figure 4A). In
contrast, we also observed children who failed to mount
high neutralizing responses to later virus, yet have

Infant plasma collection (months postpartum)
Contemporaneous and non-contemporaneous plasma neutralization activity against infant viral isolates was determined in
Figure cells
TZM-bl 4
Contemporaneous and non-contemporaneous plasma neutralization activity against infant viral isolates was determined in
TZM-bl cells. Panel A shows the results of the test plasma against infant 2 and 6 or 8-month viral isolates from two rapid progressors (1449 and 2669). Panel B shows the results of the test plasma against infant 4 or 6, 12 and 48-month viral isolates
from two slow progressors (1984 and 1084). The test plasma was diluted to 1:20. Virus production in the supernatants was
monitored by luciferase activity at 2 days post infection. Luciferase activity in the control wells containing no plasma was
defined as 100%, and the neutralization capacity of the test plasma was calculated relative to this value.

remained clinically asymptomatic throughout the study
(Figure 4B). These findings indicate that the development
of effective neutralizing responses in children fails to protect them from disease progression, but surprisingly, failure to develop effective responses is not predictive of rapid
progression. Moreover, there is no association between
the replication kinetics and disease progression, since
viral isolates isolated from similar time points (4–8
month) from both rapid and slow progressors replicated
with similar pattern (Figure 5A and 5B), even though the
late viruses from slow progressors replicated slightly faster
than early viruses from the same hosts (Figure 5B). Similarly, our study did not reveal any differences in cytopathicity of the viruses from either progressors or non-

progressors from different time points, suggesting a lack
of correlation between viral cytopathicity and disease progression among the viruses that were analyzed.
The genotypic and phenotypic parameters leading to preferential transmission of particular virus variants from
donor to recipient remain unclear. In heterosexual transmission between discordant couples, it was found that
subtype C viruses with shorter V1–V4 regions and fewer
putative glycans were preferentially transmitted and were
neutralization sensitive [57,58]. In addition, another
study of heterosexually acquired subtype A viruses suggested that transmitted viruses have shorter V1–V2 length
and few N-linked glycosylation sites [65]. An extension of

Replication of viral isolates from rapid and slow progressors
Replication of viral isolates from rapid and slow progressors
in PBMC. Panel A shows the replication properties of the last
viral isolates (4-month for 2873, 6-month for 2617 and 2669,
8-month for 1449) from four rapid progressors. Panel B
shows the replication properties of the first (6-month for
1984, 4-month for 1084) and last viral isolates (48-month for
1984, 1084 and 1690) from slow progressors. The laboratory
viral strain SF 128A was used as control. Each 2000 TCID50
viral inoculum was added to 2 × 107 PHA stimulated PBMC
from a pool of two HIV-1 seronegative blood donors. Virus
titer (TCID50/ml) was measured by infections of TZM-bl cells
by viruses harvested from days 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21.

these findings is that evolution in the newly infected individual would lead to longer and more glycosylated Env
proteins with time. These patterns have not been confirmed in subtype B sexual transmission [65-67]. The genotypic and phenotypic parameters leading to preferential
transmission of particular virus variants were also evaluated in mother to child transmission. An investigation of
subtype A mother to child transmission has revealed that
the transmitted viruses were more resistant to neutralization by maternal plasma although the viruses harbored
fewer putative glycosylation sites [64]. In our study, we
have observed that both neutralization sensitive and
resistant viruses were transmitted to both slow and rapid
progressors. It is worth noting that contrasting results
between sexual transmission and vertical transmission
studies could be due to fundamental differences between
these processes, since vertical transmission occurs in the
presence of neutralizing antibodies, but in sexual trans-

It has been hypothesized that the extensive glycosylation
of the HIV-1 Env shields the protein from immunological
recognition, or conversely, targets recognition to less functionally constrained domains where hypervariability can
be tolerated [68]. Interestingly, neither pattern was confirmed with later viruses in our infant samples, suggesting
that lengthening of the V1–V5 domain and acquisition of
glycosylation sites were not always a component of glycoprotein evolution in newly infected individuals (Figure 3
and Table 1). Only in one case (infant 1084), a pattern
consistent with this hypothesis was obtained, with
increasing V1–V5 length and number of PNGS (Figures
3). Collectively, our results highlight the necessity to
refine our understanding of the relationships between
viral genotype, viral phenotype and different routes of
transmission. Our observations and those of others also
stress the need to further explore genetic and immunologic correlates of mother to child transmission in non-B
subtypes.
Comparison of the rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions has been used as an index of selective
pressure exerted by the immune system [20,55,69]. There
are reports that higher dN/dS ratios are linked with longterm survival [20,55]; however, we found that the highest
dN/dS value was estimated for envelopes from a rapid
progressor child at the final timepoint prior to death
(Table 1, 8-month sample from infant 1449). In addition,
dN/dS values were highly variable in both groups and not
statistically different. Despite the variation in dN/dS values, the estimates were high in all cases, suggesting that
natural selection is a strong determinant of the diversification and evolution in the Env glycoprotein. Further evidence of this selective pressure comes from the
observation that amino acid replacements are not evenly
distributed in the protein sequence, but occur in 'hotspots' in particular domains (Figure 2). We can predict
two broad mechanistic explanations for these changes; (1)
they modulate glycoprotein function thus enhancing viral
fitness (currently under investigation), (2) they modulate
immune recognition of the viral glycoprotein by altering
epitopes. Despite differences in timing of sampling, or in
ultimate disease outcome, some hot spots are shared
among all children, and no hot spot differentiates the
rapid from the slow progressors. One example of these
common hot-spots is the region in C3 just carboxy-terminal to the V3 loop. Structurally this domain corresponds
to alpha helix 2 from the alignment of HXBC2 to the
intact SIV atomic structure [56]. This sequence, which is
perpetually changing, is located on the silent face of the
trimeric structure as determined for subtype B. The clustering of polymorphisms as well as the differential binding

Retrovirology 2006, 3:73

of antibodies from subtype B versus C infected individuals
to this region points to this as a good candidate for a subtype C neutralizing epitope.
Genetic assessment of variation, as indicated by dN/dS,
shows that the protein is undergoing selective changes in
a non-random fashion. Nevertheless, the magnitude and
distribution of these changes do not segregate slow and
rapid progressors. In addition, the apparent clustering of
positively selected residues in particular regions of the
subtype C glycoprotein that are normally not subject to
high levels of mutation in subtype B implies significant
structural differences between the glycoprotein of the two
subtypes.
The sole parameter that discriminates rapid and slow progressors appears to be time to death. We found that neither genetic variation in env, nor maternal neutralizing
activity at parturition, nor the level of passively acquired
neutralizing antibody, nor the level of the de novo neutralization response was linked to differences in disease progression in the children studied. However, characteristics
of the transmitted viruses other than Nab and the genetic
make up of viral populations could be linked to disease
progression. Such factors might include, but are not limited to, the fitness of the transmitted viruses, binding
affinity to CD4 and/or co-receptors, and cell mediated
immunity. The potential role of these factors in predicting
disease outcome in subtype C HIV-1 infected children will
be the focus of further investigations.

Conclusion
In this study, we examined the evolution of Env V1–V5
region from seven subtype C HIV-1 perinatally infected
children with different clinical outcomes. In addition, the
humoral immune responses of the infected children during disease progression were also evaluated. Our findings
demonstrate that neither the level of maternal baseline
neutralizing antibody nor the portion passively transferred to the infant is predictive of disease outcome.
Inspection of the neutralization susceptibility to maternal
baseline plasma indicated that both neutralization sensitive and resistant viruses were transmitted to the infected
children with different disease courses. Moreover, we
showed that the development of effective de novo neutralization response in infected children did not differentiate
rapid from slow progressors. Genetic analysis of Env V1–
V5 region could not segregate rapid and slow progressors,
suggesting that time to death may be the parameter that
discriminates rapid and slow progressors.

Patients and methods
Patient population and sample collection
Seven mother/infants pairs 1449, 2669, 2873, 2617,
1984, 1084 and 1690 were recruited into the study.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/73

Venous blood was obtained from the mother before delivery and from the infant within 24 hours of birth. Followup blood specimens were obtained at 2, 4, and 6 or 8
months (for rapid progressors) and at regular intervals
through 48 months (for slow progressors). The baseline
HIV-1 serological status of the mother was determined by
two rapid assays, Capillus (Cambridge Biotech, Ireland)
and Determine (Abbott laboratories, USA). Positive serological results were confirmed by immunofluorescence
assay (IFA), as previously described [70]. HIV-1 infection
in the infants was detected by sequential viral isolation
from the infants' peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), as previously described [33], and by PCR of the
HIV-1 provirus env gene from genomic DNA. The first
timepoint for positive PCR from each infant is indicated
in Table 1.
Cell tropism and chemokine co-receptor usage
The syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing
(NSI) phenotype was determined by infecting MT-2 cells
as described [33]. Virus was scored as 'SI' if syncytia and
increasing level of p24 antigen were observed within a 10day period and as 'NSI' if syncytia failed to form within
that time. To further define the viral tropism, viral replication was assessed in primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and in the MT-2 T-cell line, as described
[33].

Co-receptor usage was defined using Ghost cell lines that
express specific co-receptors (Ghost-CXCR4 cells
[CXCR4], Ghost-CCR5 cells [CCR5] and Ghost-CCR3
cells [CCR3])(NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent
Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH from Dr. Vineet
KewalRamani and Dr. Dan Littman) with standard procedures as recommended by the supplier. Uninfected control produced only one to two GFP-expressing cells per
well. HIV-1 strains NL4-3 and SF128A were used as positive controls for CXCR4 and CCR5 utilization, respectively.
Virus neutralization assay
Virus sensitivity to neutralization by maternal or infant
plasma-derived antibody (1:20 dilution of plasma) was
determined by infections of TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS
Research and Reference Reagent Program catalog no.
8129, TZM-bl) as described [33].
Viral replication assay
Two thousand TCID50 (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose) of
the viral isolates from early or late time points were added
to a T-25 flask containing 2 × 107 PHA-stimulated PBMC
from a pool of two HIV-1 seronegative blood donors. The
subtype B laboratory isolate SF 128A [71] was used as a
control. After incubation at 37°C for 6 hours, cells were
washed 3 times with PBS and replenished with fresh

medium. All infected cultures were sampled and supplemented with fresh culture medium at days 1, 5, 9, 13, 17
and 21-postinfection. Virus titer (TCID50/ml) was measured by infection of TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Research and
Reference Reagent Program catalog no. 8129, TZM-bl).
Polymerase chain reaction, gene cloning, sequencing and
subtype identification
Genomic DNA was purified from uncultured patient
PBMC using the Puregene kit (Gentra Systems). Primers
used for amplification of the subtype C env gene were
designed based on a reference alignment of all HIV-1 subtypes obtained from the Los Alamos Sequence Database.
Nested PCR was used to amplify a 1100 bp fragment spanning the V1–V5 region of the env gene from samples collected at birth through 48 months. In order to minimize
the PCR bias, Env V1–V5 region were amplified in duplicates in the first-round PCR of each maternal and infant
sample. First-round PCR products were combined and
used as template in a second-round PCR. Primers used in
the first round PCR were: forward primer EnvF1: 5'-GATGCATGAGGATATAATCAGTTTATGGGA (corresponding
to position 6533 to 6562 of HIV-1 HXB2 strain), reverse
primer EnvR1: 5'-ATTGATGCT GCGCCCATAGTGCT
(position 7828 – 7806). Internal primers used in the second round PCR were EnvF2: 5'-AGTTTATGGGACCAAAGCCTAAAGCCATGT (position 6552 to 6581) and
EnvR2:
5'-ACTGCTCTTTTTTCTCTCTCCACCACTCT
(position 7762 to 7734). First and second round PCR
were carried out at 94°C for 2 min; 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C
for 1 min, 68°C for 1 min for 35 cycles; 68°C for 7 min
using a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler. Amplified fragments
were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and
sequenced in both directions with dideoxy terminators
(ABI BigDye Kit). The V1–V5 region of the env gene was
analyzed.
Sequence analyses
Subtype affiliation was determined by comparing patient
env sequences to a reference panel from the HIV database.
Maximum likelihood (ML), Minimum-Evolution (ME)
and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analyses were
done to visualize how viral populations within patients
change with time. Maximum likelihood searches were
conducted in Treefinder [72] using an independent model
of nucleotide substitution for each codon position
(GTR+Γ). Minimum-Evolution and Neighbor-joining
analyses were performed in MEGA [73] using the Kimura
2 parameter nucleotide substitution model to estimate
genetic distances. Support for the nodes in ME and NJ was
evaluated by running 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates.

For each infant, samples were grouped according to the
time of collection, and analyzed independently. To keep a
consistent set of sites in the analyses, positions where

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/73

putative insertions or deletions were inserted for alignment purposes in any timepoint were excluded from population level comparisons. Variation in the pattern of
genetic diversity for each time-point was explored using
MEGA3.1 [73], DNAsp ver 4.10 [74] and Datamonkey
[75]. The number and location of putative N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) was estimated using N-GlycoSite
from the Los Alamos National Laboratory database.
Within each infant, temporal changes in viral diversity
and viral divergence from the earliest population were calculated. Viral diversity estimates correlate with the effective population size of viral populations and were
estimated based on the average number nucleotide differences between sequences, whereas viral divergence was
calculated as the average genetic distance relative to the
earliest population collected.
The overall dN/dS (non-synonymous changes relative to
synonymous changes) values for each contemporaneous
data set were calculated using Datamonkey [75], and used
to estimate the relative strength of natural selection in
each set of sequences. In addition, the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions observed per
site in infant Env (V1–V5) domains was calculated by
Datamonkey, and the distribution of non-synonymous
substitutions along the sequence was plotted to identify
regions that accumulate most variations ('hot spots').
These regions were mapped on the structural predictions
from Chen et al. [56] using their alignment of the SIV Env
structure with HIV.
