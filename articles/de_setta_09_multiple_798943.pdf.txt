Abstract
Background: The Zaprionus genus shares evolutionary features with the melanogaster subgroup,
such as space and time of origin. Although little information about the transposable element
content in the Zaprionus genus had been accumulated, some of their elements appear to be more
closely related with those of the melanogaster subgroup, indicating that these two groups of species
were involved in horizontal transfer events during their evolution. Among these elements, the
Gypsy and the Micropia retroelements were chosen for screening in seven species of the two
Zaprionus subgenera, Anaprionus and Zaprionus.
Results: Screening allowed the identification of diverse Gypsy and Micropia retroelements only in
species of the Zaprionus subgenus, showing that they are transcriptionally active in the sampled
species. The sequences of each retroelement were closely related to those of the melanogaster
species subgroup, and the most parsimonious hypothesis would be that 15 horizontal transfer
events shaped their evolution. The Gypsy retroelement of the melanogaster subgroup probably
invaded the Zaprionus genomes about 11 MYA. In contrast, the Micropia retroelement may have
been introduced into the Zaprionus subgenus and the melanogaster subgroup from an unknown
donor more recently (~3 MYA).
Conclusion: Gypsy and Micropia of Zaprionus and melanogaster species share similar evolutionary
patterns. The sharing of evolutionary, ecological and ethological features probably allowed these
species to pass through a permissive period of transposable element invasion, explaining the
proposed waves of horizontal transfers.

Background
The Zaprionus genus (Diptera, Drosophilidae) is composed by two subgenera (Anaprionus s.s. and Zaprionus
s.s.) which seem to be originated in Asia about 14 MYA

[1]. The Anaprionus subgenus has first diversified in the
Oriental biogeographic region, being relatively less studied. However, the Zaprionus subgenus ancestor(s) originated during the Middle to Early Miocene in Oriental

regions before diversifying in Tropical Africa, sharing
space and time with the best studied drosophilid species,
the melanogaster subgroup [1,2]. Due to its evolutionary
history, ecological and morphological diversity, the Zaprionus genus seems to be a good model for comparative
studies with the melanogaster subgroup. Although the phylogenetic relationships within the Zaprionus genus had
been recently proposed [1], its taxonomic positioning in
the Drosophilidae family remains a matter for discussion.
Currently, most reports agree that Zaprionus belongs to the
Drosophila genus, and that it would be more closely
related to Drosophila than to Sophophora subgenera [3-10],
to which the species of the melanogaster subgroup belong
(Figure 1). Hence, Zaprionus and melanogaster species
would share a last common ancestor at least as old as the
divergence of the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera,
i.e., between 35 and 60 MYA [5,11].
While the melanogaster species subgroup - mainly the two
sibling species D. melanogaster and D. simulans - presents
the most well known dipteran mobilomes, knowledge
about the transposable elements (TEs) content of the Zaprionus species is scant. Only seven TE families have been
identified in all Zaprionus genus. The elements 412 of Z.
tuberculatus, 731 of Z. ornatus, Bari-1 of Z. tuberculatus and,
Mariner of 12 Zaprionus species could only be detected by
Southern blot hybridization using probes derived from D.
melanogaster [12-17]. Furthermore, partial sequences were
produced for Gypsy of Z. indianus, Copia of Z. tuberculatus,
Mariner of Z. tuberculatus and Z. verruca, and Rover of Z.

indianus [17-20]. Interestingly, evolutionary analyses
demonstrated that four of these seven TEs of Zaprionus are
highly related to those the melanogaster subgroup, sharing
their common ancestor more recently than the species
ones. Gypsy, Copia, Mariner and Rover were therefore proposed to have been horizontally transferred between species of the Zaprionus subgenus and the melanogaster
subgroup of the genus Drosophila [15-18,20,21]. Horizontal transfer (HT) of TEs has been inferred when three criteria are met: (a) high sequence conservation between TE
sequences of distantly related species; (b) incongruence
between TE and host phylogenies and, (c) discontinuous
distribution of a TE across a species group. Additionally,
requirements like geographic, temporal and ecological
overlapping and, exclusion of alternative hypothesis as
ancestral polymorphism promoting differential subfamily fixation and high selective constraints over the
sequences need to be considered [22].
In a previous study, we have performed a search of D. melanogaster TEs in the American continent invasive species
Z. indianus by Dot blot methodology, aiming to broaden
our understanding of TE occurrence in species of the Zaprionus genus [23]. All the 10 TEs analyzed were present in
the Z. indianus genome, but only five had strong hybridization signals with the probes that were used: Roo/B104,
Doc, MDG-1, Micropia and Gypsy. Among them, we
selected Gypsy and Micropia retroelements to expand our
evolutionary analyses in the Zaprionus genus. This choice
was due to the evidence of the close relationship of these

Z. indianus elements with others already described in the
literature, inferred by the strong hybridization signals
using heterologous probes, the easy amplification with
the primers available in the literature and the proposition
of a Gypsy HT of between Z. indianus and D. simulans [18].
Gypsy and Micropia are classified as Ty3/Gypsy elements
because of their gene arrangement in the pol coding region
- Reverse transcriptase/RNAseH/Integrase [24]. Ty3/Gypsy
retroelements, which are similar to vertebrate retroviruses
in both sequence and genomic structure, are broadly distributed among eukaryotes [25]. They differ from vertebrate retroviruses mainly because they do not have an env
gene necessary to complete the infectious cycle [24]. Gypsy
is an exception to the typical Ty3/Gypsy structure because
an active env is present, potentially capable of maintaining
infectivity [26]. Hence, Gypsy was classified as an Errantivirus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) [27].
The Micropia retroelement had already been studied in D.
melanogaster, and several species of the repleta and the cardini groups of the subgenus Drosophila [28-30]. Evolutionary analyses showed the existence of at least two Micropia
families that have ~30% divergence in DNA sequence
[29]. The first family, present in the repleta group, comprises two subfamilies than were differentiated by nucleotide divergence and antisense RNA expression. The
repleta species group seems to have transmitted one of its
elements to the D. cardini group through HT [30]. The second family is represented by the D. melanogaster element
that also transcribes antisense RNAs responsible for control of its expression [31]. The data suggest that the
Micropia retroelement is an ancient component of Drosophila genomes [29].
In contrast to Micropia, the Gypsy retroelement has been
analyzed in the 12 Drosophila genomes [32], and individual sequences from several Drosophilidae species are
available, such as the virilis and repleta groups of subgenus
Drosophila; the willistoni and melanogaster groups of the
subgenus Sophophora; and the Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis and the Z. indianus species [18,32-34]. Two Gypsy
families have been identified, one exclusive to D. willistoni
and the other widely distributed among Drosophilidae
species [18]. The latter is divided into 10 subfamilies,
seven of which have been implicated in HT events, demonstrating that inheritance of the Gypsy retroelement is
complex [18,32]. HT events involving Gypsy could have
been facilitated by the presence of env, assumed to confer
autonomous infectivity on the retroelement, thereby
allowing it to cross species barriers [18,32,35]. Specifically
in the melanogaster species subgroup, two Gypsy subfamilies have been identified, and seven HTs have been
proposed among melanogaster species subgroups, or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/279

between one species of that subgroup and S. latifasciaeformis and Z. indianus [18,32]. These inter-genera HTs are
assumed to have occurred because synonymous sites of
Gypsy env gene are three to five times more highly conserved than those of host genes in species that diverged
longer than 40 MYA [18].
We have now surveyed the Gypsy and Micropia retroelements in seven species of the Zaprionus genus, comprising
one species of the Anaprionus subgenus and six of the Zaprionus subgenus. Our objective was to investigate the distribution and evolutionary history of these two elements
in this scarcely studied genus by comparing their
sequences with those of the 12 Drosophila genomes and
other sequences available in the nucleotide database. The
results show that the Zaprionus Gypsy and Micropia retroelements are present and transcriptionally active only in
the subgenus Zaprionus, to which they were introduced by
more than one horizontal transfer event from different
donor species.

Results
Distribution of Gypsy and Micropia in the genus
Zaprionus
In an attempt to search for the presence of Gypsy and
Micropia retroelements in seven species of the Zaprionus
genus (Table 1), PCR reactions using primers that amplify
Gypsy env and Micropia RNAseH sequences were carried
out (see Materials and Methods). This revealed the presence of these elements in the six species of the Zaprionus
subgenus, but not in Z. multistriatus (Anaprionus subgenus). Three clones of each Gypsy and Micropia PCR fragments were sequenced and used in the evolutionary
analyses. Additionally, RT-PCR reactions and Southern
blot hybridization showed that all Zaprionus subgenus
species analyzed harbor a few transcriptionally active
insertions of Gypsy and Micropia elements, varying from
one (Z. gabonicus) to seven (Z. indianus and Z. davidi)
insertions for Gypsy, and from two (Z. tuberculatus and Z.
africanus) to seven (Z. indianus) for Micropia [Additional
files 1 and 2].
Evolutionary analyses of the Gypsy retroelement
To infer the evolutionary history of Gypsy retroelement in
the Zaprionus subgenus, we carried out genomic searches
for Zaprionus homologous sequences in the 12 Drosophila
genomes and the GenBank database. The in silico search
retrieved genomic sequences only from the melanogaster
subgroup, indicating that the other seven Drosophila
genomes (D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D.
willistoni, D. mojavensis, D. virilis and D. grimshawi) do not
harbor Gypsy sequences closely related to those of the subgenus Zaprionus. Eight sequences were identified in D.
melanogaster, nine in D. simulans, 19 in D. sechellia, six in
D. yakuba, and 13 in D. erecta [Additional file 3]. A BLAST-

only D. melanogaster genome presents putatively fulllength insertions [Additional file 4].
Inferring phylogenetic relationships and divergence
The phylogenetic relationships inferred using the Maximum Parsimony (MP), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and
Neighbor-joining (NJ) methods of phylogenetic reconstruction produced similar patterns with identical main
branches. The analyses were performed with three
sequences of each Zaprionus species and 52 sequences of
species from the melanogaster subgroup. The S. latifasciaeformis and D. willistoni Gypsy sequences available in the
GenBank database were included in these reconstructions
because of their respectively closer and more distant evolutionary relationships to those of the melanogaster subgroup [18]. Figure 2 shows the tree reconstructed by ML
analysis. The sequences of the genus Zaprionus, the melanogaster species subgroup and S. latifasciaeformis were
grouped together in three clades that were not congruent
with the species phylogeny. Clade 1 (bootstrap 97%) contains sequences of D. melanogaster, D. erecta, D. simulans
and only one sequence of the genus Zaprionus, Z.
tuberculatus1. Clade 2 (bootstrap 84%) includes Z. tuberculatus, Z. camerounensis, S. latifasciaeformis, D. melanogaster, D. erecta and all sequences of D. yakuba, except D.
yakubaA6, which branches outside the 3 clades. The
reported clustering of D. erecta and S. latifasciaeformis has
been explained as an HT event [31]. Finally, clade 3 comprises the Gypsy sequences of Z. davidi, Z. indianus and the
two cryptic species, Z. gabonicus and Z. africanus, as well as

sequences of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and all
sequences of D. sechellia, with no bootstrap support. Additionally, a tree was reconstructed using the Zaprionus
sequences, the genomic sequences of melanogaster subgroup, and Gypsy sequences of 17 other Drosophila species
(from the guarani, cardini, pallidipennis, tripunctata, repleta,
anulimana and flavopilosa groups of the subgenus Drosophila and D. busckii [18]). A similar topology of the Figure 2 was obtained, with all Zaprionus sequences
clustering together with melanogaster elements in the same
clade distribution, which reinforces the close relationship
between Zaprionus and melanogaster Gypsy sequences (data
not shown).
Distance analysis shows that the sequences within the
three clades have relatively low divergence levels, with
mean values of 0.063, 0.070 and 0.042 within clades 1, 2
and 3, respectively (Table 2 and Additional file 5). The
distances of the Zaprionus vs melanogaster species within
each group are similar to the mean values just cited. The
mean distances between the clades show that clade 2 is
closer to clade 3 than to clade 1, with mean values of
0.119 (clade 2 vs clade 3), 0.239 (clade 1 vs clade 2) and
0.241 (clade 1 vs clade 3). The Drosophila Gypsy sequences,
which vary up to 20% in nucleotide composition, were
previously classified into 10 subfamilies [18,32]. Among
them, the sequences of Z. indianus and the melanogaster
species subgroup were included in two different subfamilies. The addition of 18 sequences belonging to six
Zaprionus species allowed us to confirm this proposition.

from 2 and 3 (0.24) indicate that it corresponds to one of
those subfamilies previously proposed, hereafter called
subfamily 1 (S1). On the other hand, a divergence of
0.119 between clades 2 and 3 led us to classify them as
variants 1 and 2 (V1 and V2) of another subfamily (S2)
that may correspond with the second subfamily already
described due to its species composition.
Testing the HT hypothesis
Three hypotheses could explain the high levels of conservation among Gypsy sequences within each clade (0.040.07) and the phylogenetic inconsistencies compared to
the species tree: (a) high selective constraints conserving
the sequences; (b) ancestral polymorphism promoting
differential subfamily fixation in the species; and (c) the
occurrence of HT. To test whether (a) can best explain the
estimated conservation, the ratio of non-synonymous
divergence per synonymous divergence (dN:dS) within
the clades were compared to those of the Gpdh nuclear
gene, offering a comparative measurement of the selective
constraints. Although active elements might suffer selective pressure to maintain their coding sequences, Gpdh
would be expected to be even more restricted because it
plays an essential role in glycerophospholipid metabolism in Drosophila. If it is assumed that synonymous substitutions are under almost strictly neutral evolution,
dN:dS = 1, dN:dS <1 and dN:dS >1 will represent neutral
evolution, purifying selection and positive Darwinian
selection, respectively. The analyses indicate that the
mean Gypsy dN:dS ratios ranged from 0.153 to 1.002,
while the mean Gpdh values did not exceed 0.041 (Table

3, and Additional file 6). These ratios suggest that,
although dN:dS <1, purifying selection over the Gypsy env
sequences is relaxed (dN:dS mean = 0.395) compared to
the host gene. Also, a Z-test for the Gypsy env region indicates neutrality for most of the pairwise comparisons
(62%) within the clades [Additional file 7]. Hence, high
selective constraints do not explain the incongruities
observed intra-clades. On the other hand, the neutrality
hypothesis was refuted for all pairwise comparisons
between the clades, indicating that purifying selection
could plays a role in the conservation of the env coding
sequence among the Gypsy subfamilies. In that case, natural selection could act at the genomic level, conserving the
TE genes, since elements that transpose most efficiently,
or at the highest rate are most likely to survive and propagate [36].
In the absence of intra-clade selective constraints, the
comparisons between the dS values of the TE and a host
gene permit evaluation of the hypothesis of ancestral polymorphism within subfamilies. If the Gypsy retroelement
is evolving vertically and the incongruence in the phylogeny are due to differential subfamily distribution in the
analyzed species, the dS pairwise comparisons between
the TE and the host gene would be expected to be equivalent. But, if the dS of TE is lower than the dS of host gene
under similar or higher levels of selective constraints and
in the absence of strong codon usage bias, HT events can
be inferred. Using this approach, the dS of Gypsy and
Gpdh gene, as well as the Codon Bias Index (CBI) were
compared for one clone representing each species of Zap-

rionus and the best Blastn subject of the genomic
sequences in each clade. Codon usage bias is a factor that
may be responsible for low dS values for TE sequences,
since there is a negative correlation between codon usage
bias and dS values [20]. The Codon Bias Index (CBI) indicates that the Gypsy and Gpdh sequences did not suffer
high codon bias, although the mean value of 0.602 for
Gpdh suggests that the small difference in magnitude of
dS between Gpdh and Gypsy ought to be taken cautiously
in inferring HT, since the variation in the Gpdh dS distance could reflect codon usage. Hence, comparisons
between Gypsy and Gpdh dS were used to infer HT only if
the dS values of Gypsy were at least twice as low as those
of Gpdh. The Gypsy dS values between Zaprionus and
melanogaster species ranged from 3 (Z. tuberculatus2 vs
D. melanogaster5 and D. erecta3) to 20 times (D.
melanogaster7 vs Z. davidi2) lower than those of Gpdh
(Figure 3). On the other hand, comparisons of dS between
the Zaprionus species within each clade gave Gypsy dS
values approximately equal or higher than Gpdh dS,

excepting for Z. davidi2 vs Z. indianus1 and Z. africanus1
which presented dS of Gypsy slightly lower than the host
gene ones. These results may indicate that the Gypsy retroelement evolved mainly by vertical transmission within
the Zaprionus subgenus, but there may have been HT
events between the Zaprionus and the melanogaster species what could reject the hypothesis of ancestral polymorphism within the clades.
Phylogenetic relationships of the Micropia retroelement
In order to evaluate the evolutionary history of Micropia,
the same approaches of phylogeny and divergence estimations used for Gypsy were applied. Sequences homologous
to the Zaprionus species were also identified only in species of the melanogaster subgroup, except for D. erecta, the
unique species of the melanogaster subgroup for which no
significant matches were obtained. D. sechellia had the
most hits (22), followed by D. simulans (six), D. yakuba
(four) and D. melanogaster (three) [Additional file 3].

Inferring phylogenetic relationships and divergence
The MP, NJ and ML reconstructions of the Micropia
sequences from the Zaprionus subgenus, the genomic
sequences from the melanogaster subgroup and the GenBank sequences of the repleta group had similar topologies. As for Gypsy, only ML reconstruction is given (Figure
4). The tree exhibits several incongruences according to
species phylogeny, such as grouping species in the Zaprionus genus together with those of the melanogaster subgroup. The sequences of the Micropia family of the repleta
group were clustered outside a well-supported branch that
harbors all sequences of the Zaprionus subgenus and the

melanogaster species subgroup, constituted by two clades.
Clade 1, with low support (48%), grouped the D.
sechelliaA20 sequence with three internal clades, corresponding to the Z. camerounensis sequences (bootstrap
98%), D. yakuba (no support) and the sequences of Z. davidi, Z. indianus, Z. africanus and Z. gabonicus (bootstrap
75%). This last clade did not give a clear internal speciesspecific clustering. Clade 2 grouped sequences of the melanogaster subgroup (from D. melanogaster, D. simulans and
D. sechellia) together with Z. tuberculatus in 76% of the
replications. Despite the clustering of all melanogaster
sequences in clade 2, the support was not high (52%). The
mean divergence within clade 1 was much lower (0.009)
than in clade 2 (0.051) or between them (0.074) [Additional file 9]. Analyzing the species groups separately, the

Phylogenetic relationships between Micropia retroelements

number mentioned in the text. The branch support was calculated using bootstrap test (1000 replications). Numbers next to

mean divergence of the Zaprionus sequences was 0.033; it
was 0.047 within the melanogaster species subgroup, and
0.073 between the Zaprionus and the melanogaster
sequences (Table 2). The phylogenetic tree and distance
estimates <20% indicate that Micropia in the Zaprionus
and melanogaster species belong to the same subfamily.
Testing the HT hypothesis
Evaluation of the selective constraints showed that the
mean dN:dS values of the Micropia sequences were 14-58
times higher than those of Gpdh (Table 3 and [Additional
file 10]). Between the Zaprionus and melanogaster
sequences, for example, the values were 0.524 and 0.009

for Micropia and Gpdh, respectively. In addition, the Z-test
failed to reject the neutrality hypothesis in ~80% of the
pairwise comparisons [Additional file 11]. These results
refute the hypothesis that the high similarity between the
Micropia sequences of Zaprionus and melanogaster is due to
high selective constraints conserving their nucleotide
sequences.
To evaluate the ancestral polymorphism hypothesis for
Micropia, the dS values of Micropia RNAseH and Gpdh
sequences were compared between the sequences of Zaprionus and melanogaster species in each clade (Figure 5). All
the dS distances for the Micropia were lower than those for

the Gpdh. For instance, the dS between Z. tuberculatus and
the melanogaster subgroup sequences in clade 1 were from
61 (vs D. simulans) to 76 (vs D. sechellia) times lower than
that those for the Gpdh. Those for the D. yakubaA1
sequence were from 18 (vs Z. indianus1) to 31 (vs Z.
camerounensis1) times lower. In addition, dS was zero in
some comparisons, e.g. those among the Z. camerounensis,

Z. davidi, Z. africanus and Z. gabonicus sequences of clade
1. The high conservation in the synonymous sites of the
RNAseH sequences favors the hypothesis that their low
divergence is due to recent acquisitions of Micropia in the
Zaprionus and melanogaster genomes, and that HT has
shaped its evolution, as already proposed for the Gypsy retroelement.

Network trees corroborate the inference of HT
Network reconstructions were used as an additional
approach to test the hypothesis that HT has shaped the
evolution of Gypsy and Micropia in Zaprionus and melanogaster species. Since TE sequences can be considered as
populations of sequences that share a common ancestor,
this type of phylogeny lets one propose possible donors
and receptors species, and to reconstruct the TE dispersion
routes by the proposition of the ancestral nodes.

The Gypsy network indicated three clusters of sequences
(Figure 6a), which correspond to the S1 subfamily and the
two variants of the S2 subfamily (S2V1 and S2V2). Moreover, the S1 subfamily was closer to S2V2 than to S2V1,
which indicates that S2V1 diversified from S2V2. The
presence of median vectors - that correspond to a hypothetical (in theory ancestral) or unsampled sequences connecting the Zaprionus and melanogaster sequences suggests that the HT events occurred in the ancestors of the
sequences sampled, indicating that the lateral transmissions were not recent. The network tree allowed us to see
a possible HT not clearly showed by the traditional phylogeny, but evident from the dS comparisons. The Z.
davidi2 sequence is the ancestral node of the Z. africanus1
sequence (Figure 6b), suggesting a single HT event from Z.
davidi to Z. africanus. The network reconstruction also let
the D. yakubaA6 sequence be included as a S2V2 member.
Network reconstruction for Micropia clustered the
sequences of D. yakuba, D. melanogaster, Z. camerounensis,
Z. davidi, Z. indianus and Z. africanus with central median
vectors, suggesting that high sequence conservation was
not due to HTs involving the species analyzed, but probably one or more donor species not sampled (Figure 6c).
The D. melanogasterA3 sequence connects the median vectors with a large cluster that harbors D. sechellia, D. simulans and D. melanogaster sequences, which in turn links a
median branch to the Z. tuberculatus sequences. This
arrangement indicates at least two more recent transfers,
one from D. melanogaster to D. simulans and/or D. sechellia
or even to the ancestor of those sister species (corroborated by the low dS values), and a second from any of
these species to Z. tuberculatus. In addition, the branch of
the D. sechelliaA20 sequence with a median vector that
links the Z. camerounensis, Z. davidi, Z. indianus and Z. africanus sequences suggest an additional HT involving the
ancestor of D. sechellia. However, the absence of geographic sharing between D. sechellia and Zaprionus species
means that this proposal should be viewed cautiously. An
alternative explanation could be a high rate of evolution
of the D. sechelliaA20 sequence, followed by random convergent evolution.

HT inference and estimation of the divergence time
between TE sequences
To reinforce the HT hypothesis, the divergence times of
both retroelements were calculated using the molecular
clock (see Material and Methods). The divergence estimates for Gypsy sequences showed that the HTs may have
started around 11.2 MYA (Table 4). Regarding the S1 subfamily, two HTs can be proposed. The first may have
occurred from a D. melanogaster/D. simulans ancestor to Z.
tuberculatus about 3.8-8.8 MYA, prior to the time of D.
melanogaster/D. simulans splitting (2-3 MYA [2]). This
event was followed by a transfer between D. melanogaster
and D. erecta (up to 3.1 MYA), species that share a common ancestor at 8-15 MYA [2]. Although an alternative
hypothesis of HT between D. simulans and D. erecta can be
formulated on the basis of the phylogeny branching, the
greater difference in dS comparisons between the pair D.
erecta/D. melanogaster than the pair D. erecta/D. simulans
(Figure 3) reinforces the first hypothesis.

The Gypsy S2V1 sequences seem to have been involved at
least in four HT events. We suggest that D. erecta was the
donor of S2V1 in a more ancient transfer to Z. tuberculatus
(occurred about 5.2-11.2 MYA), followed by introduction
into the Z. camerounensis/Z. davidi ancestor (1.2-6 MYA),
and lately into D. yakuba (2.5-3.8 MYA) and D. melanogaster (2.5-3.9 MYA). The transfer to Z. camerounensis/Z.
davidi probably occurred in their ancestor, because these
species diverged around 2.2 MYA [1], but the hypothesis
of two independent HTs cannot be disregarded. The
donor status of D. erecta was based on their basal positioning in the network, the repeated clustering to all the
other species of this variant in the phylogeny, the divergence times between D. erecta and D. melanogaster/D.
yakuba (8-15 MYA [2]).
The S2V2 variant is probably involved in one HT event
that happened around 0.6-10.3 MYA. It could have
occurred between the ancestor of the modern sequences
of D. melanogaster/D. simulans/D. sechellia and the indianus/davidi complexes. Alternatively, the HT could have
happened in each complex separately, since the davidi
complex diverged about 0.8 MYA [1]. The HT between the
D. melanogaster/D. simulans/D. sechellia ancestor and the
indianus complex ancestor is a broader scenario than the
HT proposed between Z. indianus and D. simulans [18],
exemplifying the importance of analyzing as many species
as possible before inferring horizontal transfers [22].
Finally, the time of divergence also corroborates the HT
from Z. davidi to Z. africanus S2V2 sequences, as seen in
the network tree, which probably occurred ~1.9 MYA,
subsequent to the divergence of these species (2.6 to 4.1
MYA [1]).

Comparing the divergence times between the Micropia retroelement of the Zaprionus and melanogaster sequences
with those of Gypsy, the HTs of Micropia might have started
more recently than those of Gypsy (Micropia HTs: 3.2 MYA,
Gypsy HTs: 11.2 MYA). The invariance of the synonymous
sites between several pairwise comparisons [Additional
file 8] makes it difficult to date these events, but the highest dS levels indicate that, of the species we have analyzed,
D. yakuba and the indianus complex species were the first
to be invaded by Micropia. So, the evolutionary analyses
lead to the inference that Micropia diverged after the splitting of their species hosts, suggesting that at least an
unknown species might have transferred Micropia
sequences independently in five HTs to D. melanogaster,
D. yakuba (2.3-3.2 MYA), Z. camerounensis, Z. davidi and
the indianus complex (up to 1.6 MYA). Species of neither
the repleta nor the cardini species group are good candidates, since they harbor Micropia retrotransposons of a different family [29,30]. Hence, the probable donor(s)
might have been a non-studied species. Based mainly on
the network tree, two other HT events can be proposed. D.
melanogaster may have been the donor of Micropia to the
D. simulans and D. sechellia, or even to their ancestor.
However, introgression cannot be excluded in this case. In
turn, one of these three species might have been involved
in the transmission of Micropia to Z. tuberculatus, about
0.8-1.5 MYA.

Discussion
This survey of the Gypsy and Micropia in seven species of
Zaprionus indicates that they are widely distributed and

transcriptionally active only in species of subgenus Zaprionus. Additionally, the evolutionary analyses demonstrate
that these two retroelements are closely related to those of
the melanogaster species subgroup, and that their histories
might have been repeatedly marked by events of interand intra-subgenus HTs. Several pieces of evidence have
shown that the phenomenon of HT is frequent in eukaryotes [22,37-39]. It is important to note that the HTs proposed here were assumed only when the species involved
in the event shared geographic, temporal and ecological
environments, and when three separate pieces of evidence
suggested their occurrence: (i) lower dS values between
the TE sequences than the Gpdh sequences, (ii) incongruence between host and TE phylogenies, and (iii) last common ancestor of TE more recent than that of the species.
The studies of Micropia and Gypsy in subgenus Zaprionus
species highlight the HT events as an alternative evolutionary mechanism of the retroelements evolution.
Among the HTs inferred for Gypsy, four events seemed to
involve the Zaprionus and melanogaster species, three
involved only the melanogaster group species, and only
one the Zaprionus species. For the Micropia retrotransposon, seven HTs were suggested: five between unknown
donor(s) and the Zaprionus or the melanogaster species,
one among the melanogaster species, and one between the
Zaprionus and the melanogaster species. The 15 HTs we
have proposed probably occurred during two different
waves of invasions. First, the Gypsy retroelement of the
melanogaster subgroup had been introduced in the Zaprionus subgenus ~11 MYA. After that (~3 MYA), a second HT

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:279

wave involving the Micropia retroelement may have introduced it into both the Zaprionus subgenus and melanogaster subgroup from an unknown donor. After the
introduction, the TEs could have been prone to transposition and re-introduction in other related species. For
example, Z. davidi has donated their Gypsy sequence to Z.
africanus after had received it from an ancestor of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. sechellia.
According to the TE evolutionary cycle, the TE history
could start from HT events, followed by the initial transpositional burst in the new host, and then the accumulation of defective copies along with host-directed
epigenetic silencing [40]. The last step could lead to the
loss of mobility and, finally, to molecular erosion by random mutations. The high frequency of HTs, combined
with the transcriptional activity and low insertion numbers of Gypsy and Micropia retroelements in the Zaprionus
species subgenus indicates that these elements remain at
the first or second steps of the evolutionary life history of
the TEs, i.e. the invasion or the genomic spread period. A
question that arises is whether these elements have been
transferred in similar ways. HTs of Gypsy are easier to
explain, since the active Gypsy env can enable its dispersion and expansion of the genomic territory, but this
mechanism does not to apply to Micropia, which lacks env.
Nevertheless, retroelements could have been transferred
concomitantly with retrovirus infections, even Gypsy; or
parasitic infestations, as for example by intracellular Wolbachia bacteria or mites [22]. Moreover, our data allowed
us to propose there were HT of Gypsy and Micropia among
sister species such as D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D.
sechellia, although introgression could not be ruled out.
Another concern is the evolutionary process of fixation of
the TEs after the horizontal introduction. These elements
could share similar mechanisms of regulation, which
would permit them escaping from selective forces and
allow fixation after invasion. Control of Drosophila retroelement mobilization depends on the transcription rate,
which is directly related to the presence of specific regulatory proteins [41-45] and the rate of RNA degradation,
mediated by RNAi systems [46]. However, genetic information about the species of the genus Zaprionus is scarce.
Further, studies of the Zaprionus genes involved in controlling mobilization could lead to hypotheses about the
mechanisms that allow highly related sequences to be
shared in the Zaprionus and melanogaster species genomes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/279

groups could have received the Micropia retroelement
from one or more unknown donor species. After the initial introduction, these species could share their elements.
Since the Zaprionus genus and the melanogaster subgroup
seem to share the same age of origin and diversification in
tropical Africa, as well as ecological features, our data suggest that they passed through a permissive period of transposable element invasion during the diversification
period.

Methods
Fly stocks and DNA extraction
All the strains of the Zaprionus species that were used are
listed in Table 1, being derived from a single female
selected randomly from a mass culture kindly provided by
Drs Jean David and Amir Yassin from LEGS, CNRS,
France. The D. melanogaster Canton-S strain was used as
positive control for the molecular analyses. Genomic
DNA was extracted from 10 individuals of each strain
using the phenol-chloroform method [47].
PCR reactions, cloning and sequencing
Primers 2813 (5' TTA ACT CCT AGA GTT CAT CGC TGG
3') and 2814 (5' CAT GTA CCT GGT TAA CTA CTG ACC
3') were used to amplify the equivalent 386 bp fragment
of the D. hydei Micropia retroelement located in a highly
conserved region of the RNAseH domain, between nucleotides 2813 and 3198 [31]. The Gypsy retroelement fragment was obtained using primers GYP3S2F (5' AAA GGC
GAY TTG GTT GAC ACT CC 3') and GYP3S2R (5' CAR
GTG GCT RGG TTG RGT GTG 3') and corresponds to a
485 bp sequence located in the 6491-6511 region of env
(ORF 3) in the D. melanogaster Gypsy element [18]. Both
PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl,
using 200 ng of genomic DNA, 0.4 μM of each primer,
160 μM of each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 U Taq Platinum
polymerase (Invitrogen) in 1× PCR buffer. The Gypsy
cycling parameters used for amplification have been
described previously [18]. The Micropia PCR cycling
parameters were: 94°C for 3 min for initial denaturation,
40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 1 min, and 72°C for
1 min, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 10
min. The fragments obtained were purified directly from
the PCR product, using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band
Purification Kit (GE Healthcare), and cloned with the
TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Three randomly chosen clones were automatically sequenced in an ABI PRISM
3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems/Hitashi)
using the primer pair T7 and M13R.

Conclusion
Our survey suggests that Zaprionus species have experienced waves of retroelement invasions, particularly during the last 7 million years. Species of the melanogaster
subgroup might have donated their Gypsy sequences to
species of the Zaprionus subgenus, and these two species

method and genomic DNA was eliminated from the samples by RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA pool was generated from the total RNAs using random primers and a
High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems)
under low stringency conditions (37°C). The PCR reaction conditions and cycling parameters were the same as
those used for genomic DNA amplification of both retroelements. To test genomic DNA contamination in the
total RNA and cDNA quality Gpdh constitutive gene
amplifications were performed using the total RNA extract
treated with DNAse and the cDNA pool as templates,
respectively. The control PCR reactions were carried out
using 200 ng of total cDNA, 0.1 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 μM
of the primers ZapGPDHF (5' GTT CGG CAA TTG AAC
CAA TG 3') and ZapGPDHR (5' AGA GAG TCC GTG TGC
ATG TG 3'), 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 U Taq Platinum polymerase (Invitrogen) in 1× PCR buffer. The cycling parameters
were: 94°C for 2 min for initial denaturation, 35 cycles of
94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, and
an additional extension step at 72°C for 10 min. The Gpdh
primers were designed based on the Z. tuberculatus Gpdh
(Glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase) gene ORF1
(L37039) and amplify a 337 bp sequence in this
sequence.
Phylogenetic analyses
Zaprionus subgenus sequences were manipulated into
BioEdit [48] and aligned with Clustal W 1.81 [49]. The
most divergent clones (>25%) were selected as queries for
a search in the 12 Drosophila genomes using the flybase
BLASTn tool http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/blast/ and the
genome database released on October 17th, 2008. The
queries selected were Z. tuberculatus1, Z. tuberculatus2 and
Z. gabonicus1 for Gypsy, and Z. tuberculatus2 and Z.
africanus1 for Micropia. The structure of the genomic
sequences were predicted using the BLAST 2 sequences
and ORF Finder programs. In order to obtain only highly
related and non-disrupted sequences the searches were
performed with stringent parameters (e-values > e-50 and
80% coverage). Redundant genomic sequences (100%
identical) were not included in the phylogenetic analyses
in order to minimize polytomies.

Multiple alignments of the Zaprionus and the genomic
sequences were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships, using the maximum likelihood (ML), neighborjoining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods, as
implemented in PhyML 3.0, MEGA 4.1 and PAUP
v.4.0b10 [50-52], respectively. Branch support was calculated by bootstrap analysis consisting of 1000 replicates
[53]. In the NJ and ML analyses, maximum composite
likelihood (MCL) and HKY85 distances were used to estimate the divergence matrices and reconstructed trees,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/279

respectively [54,55]. A heuristic search algorithm was used
for MP reconstruction. The sequences obtained were registered in the GenBank database (Table 1). Gypsy
sequences of S. latifaciaeformis (AF548144, AF548153 and
AF548152) and D. willistoni (AF548159, AF548176 and
AF548143), and Micropia sequences of D. buzzatii
(AY522351), D. hydei (AY519123), D. paranaensis
(AY519124), D. mercatorum (AY519125), D. seriema
(AY522346), D. gouveai (AY522353), D. antonietae
(AY522345), D. serido (AY522344), D. spenceri
(AY522347) and D. koepferae (AY522352) from GenBank,
were also used in the phylogenetic reconstruction.
Selection tests for Gypsy, Micropia and host gene
The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), non-synonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN), the Codon Based Z-test and dN:dS
ratios were estimated for the Zaprionus and melanogaster
sequences using the Nei-Gojobori distance with the Jukes
and Cantor correction, as implemented in MEGA 4.1 [51].
The Gypsy sequences D. sechelliaA6/B14/B15, D. yakubaA6
and D. erectaA2/A6/B9, and the Micropia sequences D.
simulansA3/A6, D. sechelliaA9/A18/A20 and D. yakubaA3,
were excluded from those alignments because of the presence of indels (>2 bp) disrupting the open reading frames.
Point (1 bp) alignment gaps were deleted prior to estimation of dN and dS. The codon bias index (CBI, [56]) was
estimated for each sequence using the DnaSP 4.50 program [57], where zero indicates no bias and 1 maximum
bias. Sequences of exon 4 of Gpdh in Zaprionus and melanogaster subgroup species (FJ705445 to FJ705450,
L37039, NM_057218, XM_002078253, XM_002089126,
XM_001968825 and D. sechellia genomic sequence:
scaffold_5/4016995-4017372) were used to compare the
dS values of the Gypsy and Micropia sequences.
Estimations of divergence time for Gypsy and Micropia
The time of divergence of Gypsy and Micropia retrotransposons was estimated according to the molecular clock
equation r = k/2T, where r is the evolutionary rate (0.011
per site per MY, according to synonymous sites rate for
genes with low codon bias in Drosophila [11]), k is the dS
pairwise divergence, and T is the divergence time between
species.

The median-joining network trees were obtained using all
sequences studied in the conventional phylogenies. The
reconstructions were performed using DNA Aligment
1.3.0.1 and NETWORK 4.5.1.0 software [58], available at
the Fluxus Technology Ltd. website. 'MP calculation' was
applied for post-processing the networks, the characters
were equally weighted, and the other median-joining
parameters followed the software default.
