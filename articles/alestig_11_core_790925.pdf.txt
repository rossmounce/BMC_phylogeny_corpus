Abstract
Background: Patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 respond poorly to standard treatment with
50% or less achieving sustained virologic response. Predicting outcome is essential and could help avoid
unnecessary treatment and reduce health cost. Recently, an association of amino acid substitutions in the core
region and treatment outcome was observed in Japanese patients. In the present study, the impact of these
mutations on response kinetics and treatment outcome was explored in Caucasian patients.
Methods: The core region of HCV pre-treatment samples obtained from 50 patients treated with peginterferon/
ribavirin in a previous Swedish clinical trial with genotype 1 infection were sequenced. The alleles at rs12979860, a
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), were assessed in order to identify any co-association with this strong
response predictor.
Results: No association between treatment response and substitutions of core residue 91 was found. In contrast,
substitutions of core residue 70 were observed in 6/21 (29%) non-responders, but only in one of 29 responders (p =
0.03), and were more common in subgenotype 1b (R70Q in 6 of 13 strains) than in 1a (R70P in 1 of 37 strains, p =
0.004). The rs12979860 SNP upstream of the IL28B gene was overall the strongest response predictor (p = 0.0001).
Core 70 substitutions were associated with poorer response kinetics in patients carrying the CT genotype at
rs12979860.
Conclusions: The results indicate that substitutions of core residue 70 are related to treatment response in
Caucasian patients with HCV-1b infection, but are of less importance than IL28B polymorphism.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of
cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer affecting approximately 170 million persons worldwide [1]. Combination
therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV), given for 24 to 72 weeks, may eradicate the
infection and stop progression of liver damage [2-4], but
many patients do not achieve sustained virologic
response (SVR). For this reason, and in light of high

costs and frequent side effects, it is important to identify
factors that can predict the likelihood of response.
Several host factors such as age, stage of liver fibrosis,
body mass index (BMI), liver steatosis, insulin resistance
and ethnicity, as well as viral genotype influence the
treatment outcome [5]. While the impact on outcome
by genotype is undisputed, with 80% of patients with
genotype 2 or 3 achieving SVR as compared with 50%
for genotype 1, the importance of subtypes [6], regional
variability or mutations are controversial. In 1995 it was
reported from Japan that mutations in a part of the
NS5A region were associated with treatment response
in genotype 1b patients. The association between

mutations in this segment of NS5A, denoted the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR) [7] was verified in subsequent Japanese, but not in European studies
[8-10].
Several reports have described that Japanese patients
carrying HCV strains with a substitution of amino acids
70 (R70Q) and 91 (L91M) respond less well to treatment [11-13], and it was suggested that pre- and ontreatment analysis of core region polymorphism may be
useful for predicting SVR in individual patients [14].
However, the occurrence of core 70 and 91 substitutions
has not been corroborated in European strains.
In addition to well-known host factors like age and
liver fibrosis, it was recently revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of the interferon
l3-encoding IL28B gene may predict which patients
achieve SVR after the completion of peg-IFN/ribavirin
therapy [15,16]. This observation may be relevant for
investigations of how core variation influences treatment
response in different populations of patients with hepatitis C, firstly because the distribution of IL28B SNP genotypes differ between ethnic groups [15,17] and secondly
because SNP differences may bias the results.
In this study, serum samples were drawn from 50
patients infected with HCV genotype 1a or 1b prior to
treatment with peginterferon-alpha2a and ribavirin for
sequencing of the core region and part of NS5A (including
ISDR). The outcome of treatment was related to the core
substitutions as well as to IL28B variation.

Methods
Samples

Pre-treatment serum samples from patients who were
treated with peginterferon-alpha2a and ribavirin for
chronic infection with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 in a
previous study [18] were investigated. Fifty out of the 53
patients in the study were included in the present study.
Two patients were excluded because serum samples
were lacking, and one patient was excluded because
sequencing revealed genotype 6e. The characteristics of
the patients are shown in Table 1. The regional ethics
committee in Gothenburg approved the study protocol,
and a written informed consent was obtained from each
patient.

subjected to nested PCR using the following primers: outer
forward AAGGCCTTGTGGTACTGCCTG (274F), outer
reverse ATGTACCCCATGAGGTCGGC (oka186R), inner
forward GGAGGTCTCGTAGACCGTGCA (318F) and
inner reverse GACCTTACCCAARTTMCGCGACCTA
(709R).
Strains of genotype 1b were also amplified using primers outer forward GTCACAACTCCCATGCGAGC
(6843F) and outer reverse AGCTCCGCCAAGGCAGAA
(7412R), and in a second round using inner forward
TTCCATGCTCACCGACCC (6887F) and inner reverse
AATGGGCACCCGTGTACCAC (7319R), in order to
sequence the ISDR (nt 6905-7299). Cycle sequencing
was performed with 318F and 709R for the core region
and with 6887F and 7319R for the ISDR. The sequences
were read by an ABI 3100 Avant instrument (Applied
Biosystems). The Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation)
and MacVector (MacVector Inc., Cambridge, UK) software were used for editing and phylogenetic analysis.
The genotype of the sequences was established by comparison with GenBank sequences representative for all
HCV genotypes.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms

Alleles of rs12979860 were assessed by first running a
two-step PCR (15 s at 95°C; 60 s at 60°C) on an ABI
7300 instrument using primers rs12979860_F, GTGCCT
GTCGTGTACTGAACCA and rs12979860_R, AGCGC
GGAGTGCAATTCA and the Taqman MGB-probes
rs12979860-C_P, FAM-CCTGGTTCGCGCCTT-MGB
and rs12979860-T_P, VIC-CCTGGTTCACGCCT-MGB
(SNP position underlined). Allelic discrimination was
obtained by post-PCR read of fluorescence intensity
from each of the fluorophores.
Statistical analysis

Statistical significance was evaluated by Fisher’s exact
test for group correlations, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, student’s t-test, logistic or linear regression analysis, as appropriate, using the SPSS software
package (version 18, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The nucleotide sequences will be available in GenBank
with the accession numbers HQ729711 to HQ729773.

HCV genotyping and sequencing

Results
Baseline characteristics

The genotype 1 subtype was assessed by phylogenetic analysis of the core region. The HCV-1b classification (13
patients) was further supported by sequencing of NS5A
region. For sequencing, nucleic acid extraction was performed on 200 µl of patient serum using a MagNA Pure
LC Instrument (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Complementary DNA was created with random
primers. The core region (nucleotide, nt, 340 - 682) was

Table 2 shows the baseline status of patients achieving
and not achieving SVR. The mean age of all patients
was 46.7 years. There was no significant difference in
age of patients achieving SVR compared to those who
did not (45.2 vs. 48.8 years, p = 0.09). Baseline HCV
RNA below 5.6 log IU/mL was significantly associated
with SVR. Neither subgenotype (1a vs. 1b) nor gender
was associated with SVR.

Subgenotypes, core mutations and treatment response

The virologic response was not associated with substitutions at residue 91. However, a poor response was associated with substitutions of core residue 70: One of the
7 patients (14%) with substitutions at residue 70 (six
subtype 1b strains with Q70 and one subtype 1a strain
with P70) achieved SVR, as compared with 28 of 43
patients (65%) carrying strains with R70 (p = 0.03).
Substitutions of core residues 70 and 91 were closely
linked to subgenotype 1b: Six (5 non-SVR) of 13 genotype 1b strains had Q70, while only one of 37 subgenotype 1a strain had a substitution (P70) at this site (p =
0.0007). Similarly, all 1a strains had cysteine at residue
91, while in 1b 9 had methionine and 4 had leucine (p <
0.0001). This association between core variability and
genotype was further explored by analysis of 3313
sequences from the HCV Database Project (http://hcv.
lanl.gov/), showing a predominance (≥93%) of R70 in
genotypes 1a, 2, 3 and 4, and high rates of Q70 in 1b, 5
and 6 (Table 3). In the 13 patients carrying subtype 1b

A total of 3317 sequences found on 31 of March 2010 in the The Hepatitis C
Virus (HCV) Database Project (http://hcv.lanl.gov/) were analysed. Values less

strains, the correlation was strong: 7 of 8 responders
had arginine (R70) and 5 non-responders had glutamine
(Q70) at residue 70 (p = 0.005). In contrast, in the 37
patients with 1a infection, all the 21 patients with SVR
carried HCV with R70, while 15 of the 16 non-SVR carried strains with R70.
Phylogenetic analysis of NS5A and ISDR substitutions

In order to find out if the variability at positions 70 and
91 was linked to subgroups of HCV-1b phylogenetic
analysis of NS5A was performed, including the 13
strains from the present study as well as database
sequences. The different core 70/91 variants were found
in many sub-branches of the tree without clustering,
indicating that they are not the result of a few historical
mutations but evolve continuously (data not shown).
One substitution within ISDR (as compared with the
HCV-J reference sequence) was observed in 9 of the 13
subgenotype 1b strains (7 H2218R, 2 H2218N), and 2
substitutions (H2219Y and D2225E) were seen in one
strain. There was no association between ISDR substitution and treatment response.
IL28B SNP

The rs12979860 T allele frequency was 40% as compared with 46% in 163 health subjects without HCV
infection. The CC genotype, which has been associated
with better treatment response in several previous studies, was identified in 18 patients, and 16 of them (89%)
were achieved SVR. The unfavourable SNP genotype
(TT) was found in 8 patients and none of them was
responder. The remaining 24 patients were CT heterozygous, 13 (54%) of them achieved SVR. In an attempt
to explore whether core variation might have an impact
on response irrespective of rs12979860, the viral kinetics
in patients carrying the CT SNP genotype and different
HCV core variants was compared. As shown in Figure 1

Figure 1 HCV RNA declines during treatment in 24 patients

the HCV RNA level after 4 and 8 weeks were significantly lower in the patients with CTrs12979860 carrying
HCV with core R70 as compared with those with Q70
or P70. This impact also tended to influence the SVR
rate which was higher (p = 0.06) in patients with R70
(67%; 12/18) than in those with Q70 and P70 (17%; 1/6).
Discussion

Substitutions of core amino acids 70 and 91 have been
associated with outcome of peginterferon/ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C in Japanese patients
infected with subgenotype 1b [11,19,20]. The result
from the present study indicates that core variability
may influence the treatment response also in Caucasian
patients in Europe. However, only variation at residue
70 (but not residue 91) was associated with treatment
response, and the impact was restricted to subgenotype
1b: Out of 13 patients with subgenotype 1b all the 5
non-SVR patients had Q70, while 7 of the 8 with SVR
had R70. In contrast, 36 out of 37 patients (21 SVR, 16
non-SVR) with subgenotype 1a infection carried strains
with R70. A similar lack of impact by core mutations in
subgenotype 1a was recently reported by others [21].
The mechanism for the potential impact on treatment
response is unknown, and it is possible that the variation at residue 70 is only indirectly linked to response.
This seems to be supported by the fact that the typical
core 70 amino acid differs between genotypes without
any observed impact on response rates. Thus, the R70
variant, which has been associated with SVR in patients

Page 5 of 7

carrying HCV-1b strains, was observed in 98% of 1a
sequences from GenBank (Table 3). Conversely, Q70,
which seems to be associated with non-SVR in patients
carrying subgenotype HCV-1b, is the predominant variant in genotypes 5 and 6, despite the fact that patients
carrying these genotypes respond as well or better than
patients infected with genotype 1a [22]. One study did
not find any association of specific core amino acids in
genotype 6f [23], and possibly the association of the C70
mutation to SVR is restricted to genotype 1b. These
observations do not exclude a direct effect of core residue 70 on treatment response, because glutamine at
position 70 might influence conformation and function
of the core protein differently in HCV-1b than in HCV1a or other genotypes. Indeed, a previous study has
described that subgenotype 1a and 1b show different
patterns of associations between genetic diversity and
response to treatment [21]. Possibly, such differences
may contribute to explain the reportedly higher SVR
rate in patients with 1b than in those with 1a [24].
In order to find out if the core 70 or 91 variants might
be linked to the phylogeny HCV-1b, core sequences
from the 9 patients included in this study and 100 randomly chosen database sequences were compared by
phylogenetic tree analysis. No clustering with respect to
aa setup at aa 70 or 91 was observed, indicating that the
evolution of Q70 is a sporadic but rather frequent event
in HCV-1b.
Several previous reports from Japan have shown that
substitutions in the ISDR in the NS5A region are associated with treatment response in patients infected with
HCV-1b. In this study we found no impact of ISDR
variability on response in patients carrying HCV-1b, but
considering that only 13 patients were investigated, such
an association might be missed.
The main focus of the present study was not the
importance of the recently identified single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) upstream the IL28B gene. However, because this variability might influence the interpretation of core variability, the rs12979860 SNP
was analysed. The results show that this SNP has a
strong impact on treatment response, as 16 out of 18
patients with CC as opposed to no patients with TT at
rs12979860 achieved SVR. This strong impact of IL28B
variability might bias the effect of HCV-core variability
on SVR, or the strong host factor may overshadow an
effect of the viral factor. The risk for such an effect is
probably lower in Japan where most patients carry the
favourable CC genotype at rs12979860, than in Caucasian populations where also the CT and TT IL28B genotypes are frequent. However, we did not find any
significant association between rs12979860 and core aa
70 and an impact of core variation at residue 70 on
response was observed also within the group that

carried CT at rs12979860: the decline in HCV RNA was
steeper in patients infected with HCV with R70 as compared with Q70. This finding indicates that the effect of
core variability is not solely dependent of IL28B, and
that HCV core analysis might be clinically relevant, primarily in patients with the CTrs12979860 genotype. Multivariate analysis was not performed, as the number of
samples in the study is low, with the risk of generating
false positive results in the subgroups.
Conclusions

In conclusion, the results support that substitutions at
position 70 but not at position 91 in the core protein of
HCV-1b are associated with treatment response in Caucasian patients with chronic hepatitis C. The observation
needs to be confirmed in studies with larger number of
patients with HCV-1b infection taking ethnicity and
IL28B polymorphisms into consideration.
