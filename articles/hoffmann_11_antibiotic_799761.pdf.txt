Antibiotic resistance in primary care in Austria - a
systematic review of scientific and grey literature
Kathryn Hoffmann1*, Gernot Wagner1, Petra Apfalter2 and Manfred Maier1

Abstract
Background: Antibiotic resistance is an increasing challenge for health care services worldwide. While up to 90%
of antibiotics are being prescribed in the outpatient sector recommendations for the treatment of communityacquired infections are usually based on resistance findings from hospitalized patients. In context of the EU-project
called “APRES - the appropriateness of prescribing antibiotic in primary health care in Europe with respect to
antibiotic resistance” it was our aim to gain detailed information about the resistance data from Austria in both the
scientific and the grey literature.
Methods: A systematic review was performed including scientific and grey literature published between 2000 and
2010. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined and the review process followed published recommendations.
Results: Seventeen scientific articles and 23 grey literature documents could be found. In contrast to the grey
literature, the scientific publications describe only a small part of the resistance situation in the primary health care
sector in Austria. Merely half of these publications contain data from the ambulatory sector exclusively but these
data are older than ten years, are very heterogeneous concerning the observed time period, the number and
origin of the isolates and the kind of bacteria analysed. The grey literature yields more comprehensive and up-todate information of the content of interest. These sources are available in German only and are not easily
accessible. The resistance situation described in the grey literature can be summarized as rather stable over the last
two years. For Escherichia coli e.g. the highest antibiotic resistance rates can be seen with fluorochiniolones (19%)
and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (27%).
Conclusion: Comprehensive and up-to-date antibiotic resistance data of different pathogens isolated from the
community level in Austria are presented. They could be found mainly in the grey literature, only few are
published in peer-reviewed journals. The grey literature, therefore, is a very valuable source of relevant information.
It could be speculated that the situation of published literature is similar in other countries as well.
Keywords: Antibiotic resistance, primary health care, Austria, systematic literature review, grey literature

Background
The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (AR)
is one of the major challenges for the healthcare systems
worldwide. Antibiotic resistant infections are associated
with a 1.3 to 2-fold increase in mortality compared to
antibiotic susceptible infections [1]. If antibiotics
become ineffective, infectious diseases will lead to an
increase in morbidity and eventually premature mortality [2-4]. Moreover, AR imposes enormous health

expenditure from higher treatment costs and longer
hospital stays [5-10]. In addition, the development of
new generations of antibiotic drugs is stalling [11].
Therefore, restrictive and appropriate use of antibiotics
is even more needed to ensure the availability of effective treatment of bacterial infections. While up to 90%
of antibiotics are being prescribed to patients in the outpatient sector existing information on the antibiotic
resistance pattern is, with exceptions, based on samples
from hospitalized patients [12]. Excessive use of antibiotics by humans, mainly due to antibiotic overtreatment
of viral infections and in livestock breeding has led to a
large output of resistant bacteria into the environment,

where resistant bacteria and resistance genes can disseminate [13,14]. And indeed, the highest bacterial resistances rate was found where antibiotics are used most
[12].
Two European initiatives provide valuable information
on the topic “antibiotic resistance” in Austria: EARS-Net
(formerly EARSS, European Antimicrobial Resistance
Surveillance System) [15] and ESAC (European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption) [16]. EARS-Net e.
g. performs a continuous surveillance of antimicrobial
susceptibility on the basis of laboratory analyses of invasive, blood-culture derived isolates from hospitalized
patients. However, the antibiotic resistance pattern of
the microbial flora of hospitalized patients differs from
that seen in the community and, in addition, the resistance pattern of bacteria in routine primary health care
is usually only tested after initial treatment failure [17].
Guidelines for prescribing antibiotics to patients at a
community level should, therefore, be based on empirical and up to date evidence about antibiotic resistance
of bacteria circulating in the community. Ideally, continuous surveillance of resistance patterns and antibiotic
consumption in the outpatient setting should be carried
out to detect changes.
In the year 2010 an EU-project called “APRES - the
appropriateness of prescribing antibiotics in primary
health care in Europe with respect to antibiotic resistance” started in nine European countries including
Austria. One aim of this cross-sectional project is a systematic analysis of antibiotic resistance pattern of two
key-bacteria at the community level. The analysis should
be the basis for specific regional and national recommendations concerning the antibiotic prescribing behaviour of physicians in primary health care.
In the context of this EU-study we have undertaken a
systematic literature review of all scientific papers and
also of grey and non-English literature concerning the
resistance pattern for the primary care sector in Austria
in order to summarize existing facts and knowledge. It
was our aim to assess strengths and weaknesses of the
resistance situation at the community level described for
Austria and to identify the sources and origin of the
data published.

Methods
Study selection

A systematic literature review was performed of all
available literature published between the 1st of January
2000 and the 31st January 2011. For the review process
we followed the recommendations of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta- Analyses) statement [18] as it is described in the
additional file 1. Three necessary inclusion criteria for
the relevant literature were defined: First, the content

has to deal with antibiotic resistance. Second, the resistance data have to be sampled in the ambulatory or
community sector in humans and third, in Austria. We
searched the scientific literature as well as the grey
literature.
All types of indexed scientific literature were included.
The bacteria included were Streptococcus pyogenes,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,
Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae for the
respiratory tract, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis,
Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus saphrophyticus for the
urinary tract and Staphylococcus aureus. Literature containing resistance data from the hospital setting only
and the literature not describing the origin either from
hospital or primary care setting of the samples were
excluded. The language of the literature included was
English and German.
For the specification of the “grey” literature we used
the definition of the Luxembourg Convention on Grey
Literature: “Grey literature is that which is produced on
all levels of government, academics, business, and industry in print and electronic formats but which is not controlled by commercial publishers.” [19] Essentially, grey
literature includes documents that have not been formally published in a peer-reviewed indexed format.
The literature search via electronic searches as well as
the review process was carried out by two researchers
(KH and GW) for the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Disagreement within the review process was resolved by
discussion with the fourth author (MM).
Search strategy

The literature search was performed during the period
from April 1, 2010 until March 29, 2011.
For the scientific literature the databases and search
engines PubMed, Medline and Embase were used.
Search terms were the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms “primary health care” OR “ambulatory care”
AND “drug Resistance, Bacterial” AND “Austria” which
were combined with the search terms “antibiotic resistance” OR “antimicrobial resistance”, “primary care” OR
“outpatient” OR “general practice” OR “community”, in
different combinations. According to the terms in English we used the corresponding German terms “Antibiotika”,
“Resistenzen”,
“Allgemeinmedizin”,
“niedergelassener Bereich” and “Österreich”. Additionally, manual searches of the references of relevant articles including reviews were performed.
The search strategy for the grey literature was conducted via the search engines Google (http://www.google.at) and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.at); in
addition a systematic search on websites of institutions
and organizations dealing with the sampling and determination of bacteria like regional laboratories for

Hoffmann et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:330
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/330

infectious diseases, reference centres or organizations
that are responsible for public health like the Ministry
of Health and linked facilities was performed. The
search terms used were the same as for the scientific
literature.
The exclusion process for the scientific literature was
a three step process. The first step was the rejection of
the duplicates, followed by the exclusion due to screening the title and abstract of papers identified; in the
third step the papers were excluded by reading the full
text of the papers, each of which was independently
reviewed for eligibility. The exclusion process for the
grey literature was performed as a three step process
too by reading the “Google” title of the link and the
short description first, followed by reading the full text
of the relevant literature.
Finally, we allocated the literature that met all inclusion criteria into a “high quality” group (reports, government documents, recommendations of Austrian
Societies, publications not published in an indexed journal) with respect to the method section described in this
literature and a “low quality group” (interviews, official
invitations, meeting notes) as recommended by Dobbins
et al [20]. Only the “high quality” grey literature was
included into this review.
Data extraction

The outcome data extracted were: Numbers and characteristics of the included studies, bacteria types described,
sampling location in Austria and general antibiotic resistance findings. Further, the sources of the data were
documented.

Results
After the rejection of the duplicate papers a total of 82
potential scientific papers were identified of which 9
were excluded on the basis of the year published and 40
were excluded after reading the abstract and title.
Further 16 papers were excluded after reading the full
text. Most of the papers were excluded because the
reported incidence of resistance data was exclusively
from the hospital sector in Austria (EARS-Net) or other
countries than Austria. Seventeen papers were included
into the final review. Figure 1 shows the “PRISMA Flow
Diagram” for the scientific literature results [18]. The
grey literature search strategy yielded e.g. 3,840 potential
relevant links on March, 29 2011 by using the combination of the search terms “Antibiotikaresistenzen” AND
“Österreich” AND “niedergelassener Bereich” in Google.
at. After the three step review procedure 23 high quality
publications remained of which 21 are resistance reports
(19 regional reports from different years published
between 2002 and 2011 and two national reports of the
years 2008 and 2009). Most of the excluded literature

enunciated treatment recommendations of infectious
diseases for the ambulatory sector by referencing to data
from the hospital sector.
Table 1 summarizes the basic characteristics and
selected resistance findings of the final 17 scientific
papers. Nine [21-29] out of the 17 scientific papers
describe the resistance pattern of certain bacteria for the
ambulatory sector only by referencing to four data
sources, the Alexander-Project [22,27], the PROTEKT
(Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin) surveillance
study [21,23,25], the ECO-SENS (International Survey of
the Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Urinary Pathogens)
project [24,26,29] and the ARESC (Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiological Survey on Cystitis) study [28].
Eight of these nine publications describe the resistance
situation in Austria before the year 2001. The reported
resistance patterns of the analysed bacteria in the other
publications are based on isolates from both the hospital
and the outpatient sector in different proportions.
Six articles show the resistance pattern of E. coli,
ESBL-producing E. coli and other bacteria related to
community-acquired uncomplicated urinary tract infections [24,26,28-31], eight the resistance pattern of the
bacteria included for community-acquired respiratory
tract infections [21-23,25,27,32-34], further two are dealing with the MRSA situation in Austria [35,36] and one
article is a “letter to the editor” with an overview of
multiple bacteria [37]. No overall conclusion of the current resistance situation in the ambulatory sector in

Austria can be gathered out of these different studies
due to the differences in sampling settings, inclusion
and exclusion criteria of the study population, time periods, bacteria analysed and the methodology used. Moreover, the determination of the resistance rates in Austria
was conducted using the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute) standard. Within this standard there
has been a change in the antimicrobial MIC breakpoint
in 2008 which means that most data before and after
2008 are not comparable [38].
Tables 2 and 3 summarize the basic characteristics
and selected resistance findings of the 23 high quality
grey literature documents of which only the isolates
from the primary health care sector included into the
reports are described. The resistance findings included
are contained in several reports and their updates
since the year 2008 separately for the ambulatory and
the hospital sector. The key-bacteria analysed for the
urinary and respiratory tract are the same among the
reports. The Austrian resistance reports (AURES) of
the years 2008 and 2009 e.g. include the chapter
“Resistance report for selected non-invasive microbial
pathogens” which summarize the data from the ambulatory sector of several large microbiology laboratories
from all over Austria; a change in the resistance pattern of the bacteria included can be observed in certain regions over several years (table 3). While the
change in the CLSI standard in 2008 has to be considered for these resistance reports as well the overall
resistance situation in the primary care sector in Austria for e.g. E. coli is summarized as following: “The
percentage of the ESBL-producing E. coli is with 6%
stable over the last two years in the primary care sector. The highest antibiotic resistance rates for E. coli
and ESBL-producing E. coli can be seen with fluorochinolones (19%/85%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(27%/82%).”[39]
All resistance reports included are published in German only and on special websites.

Discussion
This review provides the most comprehensive and up to
date information on the pattern of AR at the community level in Austria. This has been achieved by a thorough search of both the scientific and grey literature.
Our analysis shows that the seventeen scientific publications included describe only a small part of the resistance situation in the primary health care sector in
Austria (table 1). Half of these publications contain data
from the ambulatory sector only but are older than ten
years. Moreover, the included scientific literature is very
heterogeneous concerning the observed time period, the
number and origin of the isolates and the kind of bacteria analysed.

Page 6 of 13

In contrast, the grey literature yields more substantial
information on the content of interest (tables 2 and 3).
Mainly the “resistance reports” (Resistenzberichte) contain comprehensive and up-to-date resistance data from
the ambulatory level. Since 2008, the AURES report in
particular is the only source which provides comprehensive, structured and nationwide data on a yearly basis
from isolates obtained exclusively at the primary care
sector. The resistance situation described can be summarized as rather stable over the last two years. A comparison of the resistance situations can be drawn on a
regional and on a national level (table 3). This literature
is at the moment the best available source of ambulatory
resistance data; however, the data are not covering all
regions of Austria. Further, the reports are available in
German only, are accessible on certain specific websites
only and are not published in indexed journals. Therefore, it is nearly impossible for someone who cannot
speak German or is not familiar with the website
address to find a comprehensive source of information
about the current resistance situation in the primary
health care sector in Austria. Moreover, the methodology for the determination of resistance differs between
Austrian counties and European countries which, hopefully, will improve due to the EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) efforts to
harmonize the MIC breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria in Europe [40]. This could
be an obstacle for comparative studies which are based
on systematic literature searches from different countries or for finding adequate sources to describe the status quo in Austria. Unfortunately, the results from the
promising international studies (Alexander project and
PROTEKT study)[41] of the years 1999 and 2000 that
dealt with the resistance pattern of bacteria responsible
for community-acquired infections of the respiratory
tract have not been translated into regular national or
international surveillance systems.
In contrast, comprehensive and current antibiotic
resistance data from the hospital sector or outpatient
antibiotic consumption data in Austria are easy to find
in the scientific literature due to the longstanding partnership of Austria with the EARS-Net and ESAC network. These standardized data were collected
nationwide and published regularly [42,43]. This could
be the reason that, at the moment, all recommendations
available for the treatment of community-acquired infectious diseases for the primary health care sector still are
based on resistance data derived from the hospital sector [44]. Examples are the brochure of the Austrian
Antibiotic Stewardship Group (ABS) for the ambulatory
sector or the latest expert consensus of the Austrian
Society of Infectious Diseases concerning Antibiotic
treatment in primary health care [45,46]. It should be

n/a: Resistance data of isolates from primary care alone not available

mentioned that first steps towards a resistance-register
for non-invasive isolates from the primary health care
sector in Austria are already under way. The collection
and reporting of non-invasive isolates and their resistances in the regional and the national resistance reports
in a structured and systematic way could be the starting
point. Also the ABS group is advancing this issue
[47,48].
The strengths of this review are its focus on the outpatient setting in Austria and its comprehensiveness by
the inclusion of both the scientific and the grey literature. In fact, for our purpose the data contained in the
grey literature prove very valuable in achieving our aim
of comprehensiveness and reduces publication and
selection bias. It could be speculated that the situation
of published literature is similar in other countries as
well. However, recent studies have examined the impact
of the inclusion of the grey literature in systematic
reviews to describe the status quo of a situation in more
detail [49-51]. Especially, since a Cochrane update was

published in 2004 to highlight the importance of widespread literature search strategies for public health interventions including the grey literature for systematic
reviews [52] the number of reviews which include grey
literature is growing constantly in many health related
sectors [53-60].
The limitations of this literature review are the reliance on previously published research results. Even
more difficult is the reliance on the grey literature
found due to the non hierarchic search results with the
search engine Google. Moreover, in this review we compared the scientific and the grey literature and draw
conclusions on their comprehensiveness and on the
public health relevance of their content. Since the scientific papers were independently peer-reviewed and the
grey literature was published by organizations without
that review process this may affect the methodological
quality and therefore, the scientific level of evidence. In
addition, it is not possible to directly compare the resistance data described in the scientific and grey literature:

Hoffmann et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:330
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/330

in the scientific literature the resistance data are mainly
analysed for specific diseases like e.g. uncomplicated
urinary tract infections in a defined group of patients, in
the grey literature the resistance data reported are the
result of all isolates analysed for one specific bacterium
regardless of a given disease.

Conclusion
In this review, comprehensive and up-to-date antibiotic
resistance data of different pathogens, isolated from the
primary care level in Austria, are presented. They could
be found mainly in the grey literature, only few are published in peer-reviewed journals. The grey literature,
therefore, is a very valuable source of relevant information and might reveal possibilities for further research.
Based on these findings we recommend collecting and
publishing also the non-invasive resistance findings on a
regular basis in indexed journals like it is done in the
EARS-Net and ESAC network.
