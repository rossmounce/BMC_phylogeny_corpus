Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) has become an important measure in the diagnosis and
monitoring of HCV infection treatment. In the United States (U.S.) HCV GT 1 is reported as the most common
infecting GT among chronically infected patients. In Europe, however, recent studies have suggested that the
epidemiology of HCV GTs is changing.
Methods: We assessed HCV GT distribution in 460 patients from three HCV-infected high risk populations in San
Francisco, and examined patterns by birth cohort to assess temporal trends. Multiple logistic regression was used
to assess factors independently associated with GT 1 infection compared to other GTs (2, 3, and 4).
Results: Overall, GT 1 was predominant (72.4%), however younger injection drug users (IDU) had a lower
proportion of GT 1 infections (54.7%) compared to older IDU and HIV-infected patients (80.5% and 76.6%,
respectively). Analysis by birth cohort showed increasing proportions of non-GT 1 infections associated with year of
birth: birth before 1970 was independently associated with higher adjusted odds of GT 1: AOR 2.03 (95% CI: 1.23,
3.34). African-Americans as compared to whites also had higher adjusted odds of GT 1 infection (AOR: 3.37; 95% CI:
1.89, 5.99).
Conclusions: Although, HCV GT 1 remains the most prevalent GT, especially among older groups, changes in GT
distribution could have significant implications for how HCV might be controlled on a population level and treated
on an individual level.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV), first identified in 1990, is a single strand RNA virus in the family Flaviviridae. It is
prone to high rates of genetic mutation, resulting in
evolution to divergent forms and six major genotypes
[1]. Each genotype (GT) is further divided into subtypes,
based on genetic sequence variability. There are notable
clinical differences in responsiveness to interferon-based
therapy for treatment of chronic infection by GT, with
GTs 1 and 4 being less responsive and requiring longer

exposure time to treatment than types 2 and 3 [2-5].
GT has been associated with different patterns in HCV
viremia during interferon treatment [6], and antiviral
resistance [7,8]. Although some clinical conditions have
been noted to differ by HCV GT, including insulin resistance [9], HIV and HIV disease progression [10], little is
known regarding how different HCV GTs differ in virulence or pathogenicity [11]. African Americans infected
with GT 1 are significantly less likely to respond to
HCV treatment than Asian and Caucasian patients with
GT 1 [12,13]. Patients infected with GT 1 who carry a
genetic variant allele near IL28B gene are more likely to
respond to combination therapy (pegylated interferonalpha-2a or -2b and ribavirin) [14] and clear spontaneously [15]. As this polymorphism varies by race [14],

it partially explains differences in these outcomes.
Finally, GT heterogeneity may hinder the development
of a vaccine [16].
In the U.S. HCV GT 1 has been the most common
infecting subtype; over 70% of patients with chronic
infection are GT 1 [17-19]. In Europe, however, recent
studies have reported more variation in the extent and
diversity of HCV GTs, and have shown associations
between HCV GT and risk exposure, age, and clinical
group [20-24]. In the U.S., race/ethnicity have been
found to be independently associated with GT in the
NHANES general population sample [19] and in other
samples [18], but none have examined temporal changes
in circulating infecting GTs.
The objective of this study was to examine the distribution of prevalent HCV GTs in various high risk populations in San Francisco by birth cohort and other
demographic factors.

Methods
We examined data from three prospective cohort studies in San Francisco, California, U.S. In total, 460
chronically HCV infected persons were included from
the following studies, all with IDU exposure: 1) The
“Urban Health Study” (UHS), a prospective serial crosssectional study of IDU recruited from San Francisco
neighborhoods with high prevalence of IDU[25]; 2) The
UFO Study, a prospective cohort study on the incidence
of HCV infection in young (<30 years) street-recruited
IDU[26]. 3) The “Study of the Consequences of the Protease Inhibitor Era” (SCOPE) Study, a prospective,
observational study of HIV positive patients[27]. Subjects included in this study were recruited over varying
intervals during a twenty-year time period between 1987
and 2007 (Table 1). HCV GT was assessed in the participants with incident HCV infection in the UFO Study
and the UHS using stored sera specimens from blood
samples taken at the visit of first HCV detection (antiHCV or HCV RNA). In the SCOPE study HCV GT was
determined from stored samples of prevalent infection
obtained at first or second study visit (if not available
from the first study visit).
In all studies anti-HCV and HCV viremia were assessing using Ortho EIA 3.0, with confirmation by RIBA
3.0, Chiron, Corp, and a discriminatory HCV transcription-mediated amplification (dHCV TMA) assay component of the Procleix HIV-1/HCV assay (Novartis
Diagnostics, Emeryville, CA, USA), respectively. HCV
GT was determined by the LiPA Line Probe Assay
(Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Indeterminate
GTs and co-infected cases were not included in the final
analysis of the study.
We assessed differences between the study groups and
between GT 1 versus other GTs with respect to

sociodemographic and clinical variables using standard
methods. Differences in proportions were compared
using Pearson Chi-Square tests. Differences in variables
with continuous data were assessed by comparing medians and distributions using the Kruskal-Wallis test. We
examined HCV GT distribution by birth cohort to
assess trends by 10-year birth intervals using the Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test for trend. Multiple logistic
regression was used to assess factors independently
associated with GT 1 infection compared to other GTs
(2, 3, and 4); adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated. Models were constructed in an iterative backwards stepwise manner. All
variables with a p-value <= 0.05 at the bivariate level
were entered into the model and removed one by one.
Variables with a p-value of <= 0.10 were retained in the
final model. All analyses were conducted using SPSS for
Windows statistical software package (version 13).
All of the research from participating studies in this
project was conducted under protocols reviewed and
approved by the University of California San Francisco
Human Subjects Research Committee, and conformed
to the Helsinki Declaration and local regulations. All
study subjects gave informed consent for participation.

Results
Of the 460 persons included, 202 (43.9%) were from the
UHS; 128 (27.8%) from UFO; and 130 (28.3%) from the
SCOPE studies. Table 1 shows participant characteristics
by study. There were significant differences in age, race/
ethnicity and educational background between the three
groups, and males comprised the majority (69.4%) in all.
GT 1 was predominant (72.4%) overall, however between
groups the distribution of GTs was significantly different.
Young IDU (the UFO Study) had the lowest proportion of
GT 1 infections (54.7%) compared to older IDU (UHS)
and HIV-infected patients (SCOPE) who had 80.5% and
76.6%, respectively. Analysis by birth cohort also showed
significant differences (see Figure 1). The more recent
birth cohorts had increasing proportions of non-GT 1
infections compared to less recent birth cohorts, and
young IDU specifically had more GT 3 infections compared to others (Table 1). Table 2 shows the bivariate and
multivariate results of variables associated with GT 1
infection compared to GTs 2, 3, and 4 (non-GT 1) infection. Factors independently associated with prevalent
infection with HCV GT 1 included birth cohort and race/
ethnicity. Patients born before 1970 had higher adjusted
odds of GT 1 infection compared to those born more
recently: AOR 2.03 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.34); age and study
group were not included in the final model due to colinearity with birth cohort. African-Americans compared to
Caucasian patients were more likely to have GT 1: AOR
3.37 (95% CI: 1.89, 5.99).

Discussion
These results suggest that in San Francisco, within the
ongoing HCV epidemic, the epidemiology of infecting
HCV viruses has changed over time. Among younger
IDU, who are also more likely to have more recent

infection, non-GT 1 is increasingly prevalent. Historically, few studies have been published describing GTs in
San Francisco patients. In 1999, Gish et al, [28]
described GTs (using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis) in 186 patients with chronic HCV

data are consistent with the suggestion that type 1 GTs
were more prevalent in San Francisco IDU in the 1990’s.
In Europe, Simmonds et al [29] showed an association
between HCV GT and age, and attributed it primarily to
risk exposure differences. In Germany, Schroter et al
[24] also showed increases in GTs 3a in younger groups,
including IDU and non-IDU, leading these authors to
hypothesize that the introduction of new subtypes in a
high risk group may rapidly impact lower risk groups.
Others have shown differences in HCV GT distribution
by route of exposure, with GT 3a associated with injection exposures, and GT 1b associated with acquisition
through blood transfusion [21,22,30,31]. In a multicentre
study of HCV infection in 183 HIV-infected IDU
sampled between 1984 and 2001, Van Asten et al [32],
using phylogenetic analyses, found that subtypes 3a and
1a were most prevalent (38.3%, and 36%, respectively)
and extensively dispersed throughout the countries.
The relative differences in HCV GT seen in these San
Francisco patients may be due to various factors, including temporal changes in the dominant circulating virus,
or potentially separate epidemics marked by differential
social mixing. All three populations were sampled in
San Francisco and were at high risk of HCV due to parenteral exposure, but younger patients had significantly
lower odds of being infected with GT 1. African-Americans represented 62% of older IDU, only 1.9% of
younger IDU, and 41.6% of HIV co-infected patients,
but controlling for birth year and other factors, still had

41%; 1b, 35%), 13% were type 2 (2a, 3%; 2b, 10%) and
11% were type 3a. In that sample, HCV GT was not
associated with age, gender, ethnic origin, or presumptive mode of transmission. In two small groups (n = 8
each) of chronically HCV infected, active and former
IDU recruited from two urban San Francisco Hospitals,
75% of active IDU (median age 47 years) and all of the
former IDU (median age 49) were type 1. As patients in
these studies were more heterogeneous with respect to
routes of exposure, and were likely to have been
infected some years before clinical assessment, these

significantly higher odds of subtype 1 HCV infection
compared to Caucasian patients. This differential GT
distribution by racial group may be due to various factors including temporal, social (mixing), differential
access to prevention, and/or possibly genetic explanations. The prevalence of IDU has decreased among
younger age groups and among African-American populations in the U.S.[33], and drug injector networks and
associated risks may influence the spread of HCV GTs
[34,35] as seen with other diseases [36]. Risk groups, in
particular IDU compared to non-IDU populations, may
have differential access to prevention methods by age,
race or other factors that might result in differences in
HCV transmission patterns or detection [37-39]. The
genetic polymorphism recently associated with treatment and spontaneous clearance of HCV [14,40] occurs
with less frequency in African populations, and may
account for some of the relative differences seen in
HCV GTs prevalence in African Americans and possibly
other racial/ethnic groups [19].
To our knowledge no studies have examined GT distribution patterns over several age groups (or by birth
cohort) and risk group. In Spain, Serra et al (40), found
that GTs varied by risk group: IDU were less likely to
be infected with GT 1b and more likely to be infected
with GTs 1a and 3, compared to transfusion recipients
and blood donors, and GT prevalence varied over time
in all groups [41]. Our results are also consistent with
others who have shown that African-Americans are
more likely to be infected with HCV GT 1 [18,19]. Significantly, a very recent report analyzing over 22,000
samples from HCV infected patients at a national reference laboratory in the U.S., found that patients infected
with GT 3 were significantly younger (P<0.0001) than
those with non-GT 3 (1, 2, or 4). the frequency of HCV
GT 3 ranged from just 4.3% in subjects over age 70 to
20.6% in those age 21 to 30 [42]. Our results are consistent with these new findings, and among the first to
suggest that the relative prevalence of GT 3 may be
increasing as younger groups are more likely to have
been recently infected.
This study has some limitations that should be
acknowledged. Genotyping was performed by reverse
hybridization, and viruses were not sequenced; misclassification could have occurred [43]. Patients may also be
infected with multiple GTs, especially IDU who have
frequent opportunities for exposure [44], and the assay
would have only identified the dominant virus [45]. The
groups here are selected from studies of high risk populations in San Francisco, so results may not be generalizable to other risk groups. Finally, two groups (UHS and
SCOPE) predominantly represent chronically infected
patients, and samples were genotyped only if HCV RNA
was present. If there is differential spontaneous

Page 5 of 7

clearance in association with HCV GT [26], these results
would not reflect the circulating infecting GTs in
acutely infected patients, but only those in chronically
infected groups.

Conclusions
IDU are the population most at risk for HCV in the U.S.
and younger IDU are most likely to present with more
recently acquired infection. Although GT 1 remains the
most prevalent GT, especially among older groups,
changes in GT distribution coupled with changes in the
demography of injection drug use [33] could have
important implications for the HCV epidemic. From a
public health perspective, these findings might have significant implications for how blood borne virus infections could be controlled on a population level and how
they are treated on an individual level.
