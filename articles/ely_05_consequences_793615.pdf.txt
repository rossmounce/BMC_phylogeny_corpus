Abstract
Background: Yellowfin and skipjack tuna are globally distributed in the world's tropical and subtropical oceans. Since little, if any, migration of these fishes occurs between the Atlantic and IndoPacific Oceans, one might expect to see genetic differences between sub-populations in these
ocean basins. However, yellowfin and skipjack tuna have extremely large population sizes. Thus,
the rate of genetic drift should be slower than that observed for other tunas.
Results: Low levels of genetic differentiation were observed between Atlantic and Pacific samples
of yellowfin tuna. In contrast, no genetic differentiation was observed between Atlantic and Pacific
samples of skipjack tuna.
Conclusion: Much lower levels of genetic differentiation were found among sub-populations of
yellowfin tuna compared to those observed for other large tunas, probably due to the large
population size of yellowfin tuna. Since skipjack tuna appear to have even larger population sizes, it
is not surprising that no genetic differentiation was detected between Atlantic and Pacific samples
of these fish.

Background
The yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, has a global distribution in tropical and sub-tropical oceans. Annual catches
of yellowfin tuna have averaged 1.2 million metric tons
since 1998 with sizes ranging from 5 to 20 kg [1]. If the
average size of a harvested fish is 10 kg, then the harvest

of 1.3 million metric tons in 2002 represents approximately 130 million individual fish.
In an earlier study, Scoles and Graves [2] were unable to
find evidence of genetic differentiation between small
samples of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) from the
Atlantic (n = 20) and Pacific Oceans (n = 100) using an

RFLP analysis of whole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
Subsequently, Ward et al. [3] found significant differentiation at the GPI-A* allozyme locus but only weak evidence for genetic differentiation with an RFLP analysis of
whole mtDNA. In the whole mtDNA study, much larger
sample sizes were employed to increase the sensitivity of
the mtDNA assay, but only two restriction enzymes were
used and consequently, only a few restriction sites were
analyzed. The GPI-A* data were consistent with earlier
studies that demonstrated genetic differentiation between
Eastern and Western Pacific samples [4,5].

samples were detected with either type of data. Information contained in the CR-I reveals very different demographic histories for yellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna.
However, very large long-term female effective population
sizes (Ne) were estimated for both species, which may
explain the observed levels of inter-oceanic genetic
partitioning.

Results

After the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, the potential contact between Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations
was limited to the waters around southern Africa. It
appears that this separation of the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans resulted in significant genetic drift for many large
pelagic fishes since these subpopulations are now genetically differentiated. Examples include bigeye tuna [12,13],
albacore [14,15], swordfish [16,17], blue marlin [18] and
sailfish [19]. In addition, even more pronounced differentiation produced species pairs of Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas and the Atlantic white marlin and the Pacific
striped marlin [19-22].

Control region nucleotide sequence analysis
A total of 333 bp of the nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was determined
for 148 yellowfin tuna (Table 1 and GenBank accession
numbers AY899520 – AY899681). For the pooled sample
of yellowfin tuna, 110 variable sites defined 130 haplotypes (h = 0.997) and a nucleotide diversity (π) of 3.5%.
Diversity indices for each locality sampled were also high,
although values of π and h were slightly lower for the NW
Atlantic yellowfin sample where five haplotypes were
repeated twice. For skipjack tuna, a total of 394 bp was
determined for 115 individuals (Table 2 and GenBank
accession numbers AY899405 – AY899519). In the
pooled skipjack tuna sample, there were 157 variable sites
defining 111 haplotypes, resulting in a very high value of
haplotypic diversity (h = 0.999). Nucleotide diversity (π =
8.4%) was more than twice as high in skipjack tuna as in
yellowfin tuna. All of the sampling localities of skipjack
tuna had very high diversity values (π >7.7%; h > 0.998).
For both species, the high haplotypic diversity values are
consistent with the observed large census population sizes
(Nc). Phylogenetic analyses resulted in very different trees
for each species. The CR-I gene-tree topology of skipjack
tuna is much larger and better structured than the yellowfin tuna phylogeny, and contains multiple branches with
high bootstrap proportion support (Figure 1). However,
there is no obvious phylogeographic association in either
species, with CR-I lineages from different basins scattered
throughout the phylogenetic trees. As a consequence, in
both yellowfin tuna (Table 3) and skipjack tuna (Table 4),
the majority of the genetic variation corresponds to differences between individuals within populations, and only a
minor fraction of the variation corresponds to differences
among-groups. Thus, in both species, the control region
sequences provide no evidence of genetic differentiation
between Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sub-populations.

To measure the degree of genetic differentiation between
the Atlantic and Pacific sub-populations of either yellowfin or skipjack tuna, we examined the hypervariable control region I (CR-I) and a segment of a coding region gene
of the respective mitochondrial DNAs. Genetic differences
were observed between the Atlantic and Pacific yellowfin
tuna samples with PCR-RFLP data of the ATCO gene
region, but not with CR-I sequence data. In contrast, no
differences between the Atlantic and Pacific skipjack tuna

RFLP analysis of the mitochondrial ATCO gene region
We hypothesized that the high mutation rate of the control region might have resulted in homoplasy and high
levels of haplotypic diversity that masked the actual
genetic divergence of Atlantic and Pacific mtDNAs in
these species. Analysis of a gene that has a lower mutation
rate than that of the control region has been used to reveal
genetic divergence in bigeye tuna [13]. Therefore, we performed a nucleotide sequence analysis on the yellowfin

Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) are found in tropical
and warm temperate waters of the world's oceans. They
are present in the three major oceans in large numbers
and comprise approximately 40% of the annual catch of
the world's tunas. Annual catches are on the order of 2
million metric tons or approximately 670 million individuals per year [1]. Despite their huge numbers, the skipjack
tuna are not as well studied as most members of the genus
Thunnus. Tagging studies have demonstrated limited seasonal movements, but not much transoceanic movement.
Thus, they probably do not spawn at discrete locations
[6].
In the Pacific, genetic studies using isozymes have demonstrated an East-West cline in a serum esterase allele [7-9].
Fujino et al. [10] also demonstrated differences in esterase
allele frequencies in samples from the Atlantic, Indian,
and Pacific Oceans. However, small samples of Atlantic (n
= 7) and Pacific (n = 9) skipjack appeared identical when
mtDNA was examined [11].

mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytB) gene by Terol et al.
[25]. Since one of these sites could not be assayed with
restriction enzymes, we determined the nucleotide
sequence of this portion of the cytB gene for each DNA in
the Atlantic and Pacific skipjack tuna samples. Little additional variation was observed, and allele frequencies were
similar in the two samples (Table 7). When the haplotype
distributions were compared, all of the variation occurred
within samples. Thus, there is no evidence for genetic
differentiation between the Atlantic and Pacific sub-populations of skipjack tuna.
Demographic history and effective population size
The unimodal mismatch distribution for the pooled sample of yellowfin tuna (Figure 2) and a significant Tajima D
test (Table 1) both suggest the historical expansion of this
population. In sharp contrast, the skipjack mismatch distribution is bimodal (Figure 2) and the neutrality test is
not significant (Table 2), suggesting that the effective size
of the skipjack population has been large and stable for a
long period. In fact, the value of θ0 suggests that the
number of females in the skipjack population was
originally large (Ne0 = 320,000) whereas the effective
number of yellowfin tuna females prior to expansion was
small (Ne0 = 823). However, the values of θ1 suggest large
long-term numbers of effective female breeders (Ne1) of
about 98 million for skipjack tuna and about 10 million
for yellowfin tuna.

tributions were compared, the differences were found to
be significant with 7% of the variation occurring between
samples (Table 6). Thus, low levels of genetic differentiation have occurred between the two yellowfin sub-populations. When the haplotypes were mapped to a
neighbour-joining tree of the control region sequences,
the mutations affecting the restriction sites were clustered,
suggesting that each mutation had occurred once prior to
separation of the two sub-populations (data not shown).
This result is consistent with a slower rate of mutation in
the ATCO gene region compared to that of the control
region.
Similar experiments were performed with the skipjack
tuna samples. Two variable sites had been observed in the

Compared to other scombroid species with cosmopolitan
distributions, we found substantially less genetic differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific sub-populations of
yellowfin tuna and no inter-oceanic genetic differentiation of skipjack tuna. For instance, in bigeye tuna, there
are two highly divergent mtDNA clades, one is
cosmopolitan and the other is endemic to the Atlantic
[12,13]. This asymmetric distribution of Atlantic and
Pacific clades has been observed in other large pelagic
fishes as well, including swordfish [16,17], blue marlin
[18], and sailfish [19,26]. Similarly, the striped marlin
(Pacific) and white marlin (Atlantic) and the Atlantic
bluefin tuna and the Pacific bluefin tuna are considered to
be pairs of sister species [19-21,26]. Thus, significant differentiation has occurred between the Atlantic and Pacific
populations of many large pelagic species. Why are skipjack and yellowfin tuna populations different? One possibility is that in contrast to other large pelagic species,
sufficient gene flow occurs to prevent inter-oceanic
genetic differentiation. However, this explanation is contrary to the distribution patterns of tunas and billfish
[27,28]. For instance, bigeye tuna has a distribution of
catches that would suggest a population continuum from
the Indian Ocean to South Atlantic waters along the east
and west coasts of Africa. However, bigeye samples show

a marked inter-oceanic differentiation [12,13]. In the
Indian Ocean, the presence of skipjack and yellowfin tuna
south of 20° S, is confined to the warm waters associated
with the Agulhas currents. Seasonal movements do occur
around the Cape of Good Hope via the Agulhas current,
but it appears that the migrant tuna and other pelagic species return to the Indian Ocean as the seasons change
[13,29]. In fact, the distribution patterns of these two species in the South Atlantic along the African coast of are
remarkably similar to both blue marlin and sailfish, two
species that show a pronounced differentiation between
Indo-Pacific and Atlantic populations. It should be noted,
however, that the presence of "Pacific" mitochondrial
DNA clades in Atlantic subpopulations of many tuna species indicates that inter-oceanic migration has occurred in
the past. However, contemporary levels of inter-oceanic
genetic differentiation for these species indicate that current levels of gene flow are absent or severely reduced.
Thus, current distribution patterns of skipjack tuna and
yellowfin tuna are not consistent with substantial levels of
inter-oceanic gene flow. Certainly, there is no evidence to
suggest that gene flow is occurring or has occurred at levels
higher in these two species than in any of the other pelagic
species where interoceanic differentiation has been
demonstrated.
An alternative explanation to account for the lack of interoceanic differentiation in skipjack tuna and yellowfin
tuna, is that the time since population expansion began
has not been sufficient to allow for the populations to
become differentiated. Assuming the very conservative
mutation rate for CR-I of 4.9% per million years, a generation time 3.5 years, and the tau value 8.52, expansion of
yellowfin tuna occurred about 522 Ky ago. By comparison, the estimated time for genetic differentiation of the
Atlantic and Pacific populations of swordfish and of the
Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas, using the same mutation rate, is very similar (450–470 Ky), and an even
shorter time (170 Ky) is sufficient to explain the substan-

tial genetic differentiation between the Atlantic and Mediterranean swordfish populations [30]. Thus, time since
expansion cannot explain the absence of inter-oceanic differentiation in these species. Therefore, we propose that
much larger effective population sizes are the primary
factor responsible for the similarity of the Atlantic and
Pacific sub-populations of skipjack and yellowfin tuna.
Among large pelagic species, the female effective population size can be estimated from the demographic estimates obtained from the CR-I sequences of Atlantic
bluefin tuna and swordfish. Assuming a mutation rate of
4.9% per million years and a generation time of 6 years,
the female Ne estimates are 900,000 for bluefin tuna and
800,000 for swordfish [30]. Effective population sizes
have not been estimated for other species of tunas, but
annual harvest data are generally used as a proxy for abundance since the commercial harvest of large fish has
become quite efficient throughout the world's oceans and
harvest restrictions have only incremental impact on the
total harvest of any species. Furthermore, haplotypic
diversities of tuna mitochondrial DNAs are approximately
99% in all tuna species [12,31], suggesting that female
reproductive variance is small. Accordingly, census population size can be expected to be proportional to effective
population size in tuna species. The estimated number of
skipjack and yellowfin caught in the year 2002 is 670 million and 130 million, respectively (Table 8). The catch of
all other tunas was 24 million individuals or less. Thus,
the abundance of skipjack tuna is approximately 5 times
that of yellowfin, and more than 300 times that of Atlantic
bluefin tuna and swordfish. These estimates of abundance
from fisheries data appear to correspond well with the
estimated female Nef values. The observed correspondence
does not take into consideration dramatic changes in
abundance of some of these species over the last 20 years,
nor sex ratio differences, or the age distribution of the
catch (e.g., number of mature females). However, the
comparison supports the hypothesis that skipjack tuna
and yellowfin tuna, which are the two most abundant species, also have the largest effective population sizes, and
the lowest amounts of genetic partitioning compared to
other scombroid fishes.
Bigeye tuna, and bluefin tuna have much greater levels of
genetic differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific subpopulations when mitochondrial DNA control region
sequences are compared [12,31]. However, their
population sizes are 6 and 15 times lower than that of yellowfin and 30 and 75 times lower than that of skipjack,
respectively. Furthermore, since bluefin tuna are a more
temperate species, their effective population sizes may
have been significantly lower than those observed in
recent times whenever the northern hemisphere experienced glacial maxima. Thus, the relative differentiation of

Page 7 of 9

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:19

the Atlantic and Pacific subpopulations is consistent with
the demographics of these species of tuna.
One exception to the patterns described above is albacore
tuna. The distribution of albacore tuna mitochondrial
DNAs does not appear to fit the patterns described above
for the other temperate tuna species. Albacore abundance
is similar to that of bigeye tuna and both species have two
mtDNA clades. However, in albacore the two clades are
not as well differentiated nor do they display the phylogeographic association observed for the bigeye tuna clades
[12]. Instead, the bimodal mismatch distribution of pairwise differences in albacore mtDNA is concordant with
very large long-term effective population sizes in contrast
to the contemporary population size.

The demographic history contained in the mtDNA CR-I
sequence data was inferred using two approaches. First,
the null hypothesis of neutrality may be rejected when a
population has experienced population expansion [43].
Accordingly, Tajima's D test of neutrality [43,44] and its
significance levels were estimated using DnaSP 4.00 [45]
based on 1000 simulated re-samplings replicates. Alternatively, a population that has experienced a rapid expansion in the recent past shows smooth wave-like mismatch
distribution [46,47]. Thus, mismatch distribution analyses, under the assumption of selective neutrality, were also
used to evaluate possible historical events of population
growth and decline [47,48]. Past demographic parameters, including τ [49], θ0 and θ1 and their probabilities [47]
were estimated in ARLEQUIN taking into account the heterogeneity of mutation rates [35].

Conclusion
Much lower levels of genetic differentiation were found
among sub-populations of yellowfin tuna compared to
those observed for other large tunas, probably due to the
large population size of yellowfin tuna. Since skipjack
tuna appear to have even larger population sizes than yellowfin tuna, it is not surprising that no genetic
differentiation was observed between Atlantic and Pacific
samples of these fish.

Methods
Samples of yellowfin tuna were obtained from the eastern
Pacific Ocean (near the equator at 110° W; n = 41), the
Indian Ocean (n = 63), the Gulf of Mexico and the East
Coast of Florida (n = 38) and the Gulf of Guinea (n =
100). Samples of skipjack tuna were obtained from the
Northwest Atlantic (n = 31), off the coast of Brazil (n =
19), the eastern Pacific Ocean (n = 43), and the south
Pacific near the Solomon Islands (n = 37). DNA isolation,
mitochondrial DNA D-loop region amplification, and
nucleotide sequence analyses have been described previously [12,32]. The number of segregating sites (S) was
estimated with MEGA. Values of haplotypic diversity (h)
[33], nucleotide diversity (π) [34] and the mean number
of pairwise differences (K) were computed in ARLEQUIN
ver. 2.0 [35]. Mitochondrial DNA haplotype phylogenies
were estimated using neighbour-joining analyses [36]
with Tamura-Nei distances (α = 0.5)) in MEGA [37]. The
pair-deletion option was used when missing data, insertions, or deletions were present. Maximum-Parsimony
(MP) [38,39] was carried using heuristic searches with the
default options in PAUP* 4.0b10 [40]. Statistical support
for the nodes was estimated with 1000 non-parametric
bootstrap replicates [41]. All trees were rooted at midpoint. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) [42] were
performed to estimate the partitioning of genetic variation
in regional hierarchical arrangements using ARLEQUIN.

For the analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene,
a 650 bp fragment of the skipjack tuna cytochrome b gene
was amplified using primers CB3 (GGCAAATAGGAARTATCATTC) and GLUDG (TGACTTGAARAACCAYCGTTG) [50]. Alleles were identified by determining the
nucleotide sequence of the amplified fragment. For yellowfin tuna, the ATCO gene region was amplified using
primers H9342 (GCCATATCGTAGCCCTTTTTG) and
L8562 (CTTCGACCAATTTATGAGCCC) [24]. The amplified fragments were digested with either DdeI or
HpyCH4III and the digestion products were resolved by
electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel.
