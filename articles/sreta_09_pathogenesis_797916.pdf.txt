Abstract
Background: The objective of this study is to investigate the pathogenesis of swine influenza virus
(SIV) subtype H1N1 and H3N2 (Thai isolates) in 22-day-old SPF pigs.
Results: The study found that all pigs in the infected groups developed typical signs of flu-like
symptoms on 1–4 days post- infection (dpi). The H1N1-infected pigs had greater lung lesion scores
than those of the H3N2-infected pigs. Histopathological lesions related to swine influenza-induced
lesions consisting of epithelial cells damage, airway plugging and peribronchial and perivascular
mononuclear cell infiltration were present in both infected groups. Immunofluorescence and
immunohistochemistry using nucleoprotein specific monoclonal antibodies revealed positive
staining cells in lung sections of both infected groups at 2 and 4 dpi. Virus shedding was detected
at 2 dpi from both infected groups as demonstrated by RT-PCR and virus isolation.
Conclusion: The results demonstrated that both SIV subtypes were able to induce flu-like
symptoms and lung lesions in weanling pigs. However the severity of the diseases with regards to
lung lesions both gross and microscopic lesions was greater in the H1N1-infected pigs. Based on
phylogenetic analysis, haemagglutinin gene of subtype H1N1 from Thailand clustered with the
classical H1 SIV sequences and neuraminidase gene clustered with virus of avian origin, whereas,
both genes of H3N2 subtype clustered with H3N2 human-like SIV from the 1970s.

Background
Swine influenza is an acute, highly contagious, respiratory
disease caused by type A influenza virus infection. Currently, 16 haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes are identified. Three main subtypes
currently circulating in the pig population are classical
swine influenza virus (SIV) and reassortant viruses of
H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 [1]. However, pigs can also be
infected with other subtypes of influenza A viruses. Pig

plays a substantially important role in the ecology of
influenza A virus [2] since they can act as a 'mixing vessel'.
When co-infections among human, avian or swine influenza viruses occur within a specific host, any new subtype
can be produced by antigenic reassortment [3].
Normally, SIV infects the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract producing clinical signs consisting of cough,
fever, lethargy and anorexia. SIV-associated gross lung

lesions observed in pigs are characterized by multifocal
well-demarcated purplish-red lesions in the cranioventral
areas of lung lobes known as a checker-board lung. SIVinduced microscopic lesions consist of epithelial disruption and attenuation in the bronchioles with later found
hyperplastic proliferation and bronchiolitis obliterans.
Mild to moderate peribronchiolar and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration occurs at nearly all levels of the airways. Viral antigen can be detected in epithelial cells of
airways by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining [4].
In Thailand, H1N1 SIV was the first subtype isolated from
pigs with an influenza-like symptom in 1990 [5]. Currently, both H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes are commonly
found among the pig population in the country according
to serological studies and virus isolation [6]. Subsequently, in 2005 a new subtype H1N2 was isolated from
pigs in Saraburi province [6]. Wang et al. [7] reported that
the H1 HA antigen was more resistant to natural cleavage
into its two subunits (HA1 and HA2 subunits) than H3
HA antigen. It is possible that H3 virus could easily bind
to the specific receptors resulting in better ability to infect
cells than H1 virus. Moreover, human H3N2 virus could
induce higher antibody response than that of H1N1 virus
as revealed by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titers [8].
In addition, Van Reeth et al. [9] demonstrated that pigs
infected with a European H3N2 virus induced higher HI
titers compared to a European H1N1 virus.
In Thailand, pathogenesis of SIV subtype H1N1 and
H3N2 infection in swine has never been studied. Since
different subtypes of the influenza type A viruses isolated
from pigs are found to cause different pathogenic levels in
pigs, the objective of this study is to investigate the pathogenesis of SIV (Thai isolates) subtype H1N1 (A/swine/
Thailand/HF6/05) and H3N2 (A/swine/Thailand/S1/05)
in weanling SPF pigs. Genetic characterization of the HA
gene of both studied viruses were also performed in this
report.

gross lung lesions are shown in Table 1. The lung lesions
were severe the most at 2 dpi, especially in the H1N1infected pigs. The lungs of all control pigs had no macroscopic lesions at all necropsied dates.
Microscopic lung lesions in both infected groups showed
a thin layer bronchiolar lining of attenuated epithelium.
Subsequently, necrosis and sloughing off of the epithelial
cells with loose lymphocytes infiltrating around the bronchiole was evident. The microscopic lung lesions were
scored 2, 1 and 0 in both infected groups at 2, 4 and 12
dpi, respectively. The lungs of all control pigs had no
microscopic lesion scores at any necropsied date.
SIV antigen was observed in the lung tissues by both IFA
and IHC (Table 1). IFA using nucleoprotein specific monoclonal antibodies was done at the necropsied dates
revealing positive apple-green color in the nuclei of the
alveolar, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells in all
infected pigs as early as 2 dpi. Later, IHC also demonstrated strong positive dark brown staining in the nuclei of
those lung cells similar to the IFA which were correlated
well with the lung lesions. However, IHC positive staining
cells were also found in macrophages located mainly in
the lung lesion at the cranioventral areas (Figure 1).
Virus isolation
There were no differences in the virus titers in both experimental SIV-infected groups. The virus titers at 2 dpi were
between 102 – 103 TCID50/ml either from lung tissues or
from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in both
infected groups. There was no virus titre at 4 or 12 dpi neither from lung nor from BALF in both infected groups or
in the control pigs at any necropsied date (data not
shown).
RT-PCR
RT-PCR using specific primers for the matrix protein gene
to confirm the presence of SIV in the nasal swabs revealed
positive results only between 2–4 dpi in the H1N1-

Results
Clinical evaluation
All pigs in the SIV infected groups showed clinical respiratory signs such as nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing and
conjunctivitis by 1–4 dpi with mean clinical scores from
1.5 to 2.0. However, there were no significant differences
between the infected groups. The negative control group
showed no clinical respiratory signs. All studied pigs had
no fever (≤ 40°C).
Pathological evaluation
At necropsy, lung macroscopic lesions characterized by
dark plum-colored, consolidated areas on lung lobes were
observed in both-infected pigs. Grossly, the lung lesions
were seen mostly in the cranioventral areas. Percentages of

group. SIV genetic material was not found in the nasal
swabs or the sera of the negative control pigs.
Haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay
Sera from pigs in the control group had no antibody titres (≤
1:10 HI titre) to either H1N1 or H3N2 subtypes at all collected dates. Sera from pigs in the H3N2-infected group had
no antibody titres (≤ 1:10 HI titre) to the H1N1 subtype.
Similarly, sera from pigs in the H1N1-infected group had no
antibody titres (≤ 1:10 HI titre) to the H3N2 subtype. H3N2infected pigs had 1:40 HI titre at 4 and 12 dpi to the H3N2
subtype. Interestingly, H1N1-infected group had the HI titre
(1:160 HI titre) to the H1N1 subtype at 12 dpi.
Pathogenic bacterial culture and identification
Pathogenic bacterial culture yielded negative results from
the tracheal swabs and lung tissues in all groups at 2, 4

and 12 dpi. In addition, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae were
not found by PCR tested from lung tissues in all pigs.
DNA Sequencing and Phylogenetic analysis
The nucleotide sequences in this study contained 1700 bp
(36–1736) HA gene of H1N1, 1686 bp (37–1723) HA
gene of H3N2 and 1409 bp NA gene of both subtypes
from the selected Thai isolates. The HA and NA gene
nucleotide sequences of the Thai isolates of both subtypes
from Chonburi province in this study were analyzed by
BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program
available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ demonstrating that both HA and NA sequences of the H1N1
virus had the highest homology to A/swine/Chonburi/
05CB1/2005 (H1N1) and the H3N2 virus had the highest
homology to A/swine/Chonburi/05CB2/2005 (H3N2)
(Table 2). Geographic influence definitely played a major
role in those studied viruses.

* Percent homology of nucleotide sequence from BLAST analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene from the selected
isolates revealed that nucleotide sequences of H1 viruses
had three major clusters, classical swine, avian and
human influenza virus (Figure 2) and nucleotide
sequences of H3 viruses had four major clusters, European, American and Asian swine, avian and human influenza viruses (Figure 3). Phylogenetic analysis of the NA
gene from the selected isolates revealed that nucleotide
sequences of N1 viruses contained three clusters, American swine (classical swine), Human, and European swine
and avian influenza virus as shown in Figure 4. The nucleotide sequences of N2 viruses from the selected isolates
had three clusters, American and Asian swine, European
swine and human and avian influenza virus as shown in
Figure 5. The results showed that the nucleotide sequences
of the HA [GenBank:FJ688266] gene of A/Thailand/HF6/
05 (H1N1) belonged to the classical swine H1 lineage and
the NA [GenBank:FJ688267] gene belonged to avian N1
lineage, and both HA [GenBank:FJ688268] and NA [GenBank:FJ688269] genes of A/Thailand/S1/05 (H3N2)
belonged to the human H3N2 lineage.

Discussion
The results demonstrated that both SIV subtypes (Thai
isolates) were able to induce the flu-like symptoms and
lesions compatible with viral pneumonia in the cranioventral areas and were able to cause broncho-interstitial
pneumonia similar to previous reports [4,10-12]. The pig
lung is certainly the major site of swine influenza virus
replication [1] since we did not find any viraemic pig or
SIV antigen detection outside the lung tissue at any day of
infection. IHC and RT-PCR seemed to be more sensitive
than the virus isolation. The course of infection was limited to less than a week in both SIV-infected groups as SIV
antigen detection was found positive only at 2–4 dpi. The
SIV antigen was found in the nuclei of the bronchial and
bronchiolar epithelial cells, pneumocytes and pulmonary
macrophages with similar levels in both SIV-infected

groups indicating no differences between the two subtypes in the viral protein production or replication. It
should be noted that both studied Thai isolates of both
subtypes replicated only in the respiratory tract of pigs and
shed the virus in the nasal secretions similar to other SIV.
The clinical respiratory signs and lung pathology in swine
influenza-infected pigs are commonly induced by the proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-1 α and
β, and IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and the
amount of viral load in the lung tissue [13]. Our results
showed that pigs in both SIV-infected groups showed
more severe clinical respiratory signs and had higher body
temperature compared to the control pigs. Although,
none of the studied pigs had fever, pigs in both SIVinfected groups had slight elevated body temperature.
However, cytokines responsible for those clinical signs
and lesions were not done in this study.
It is generally believed that there is no cross-protection
between H1N1 and H3N2 viruses [9]. The HI test between
H1N1 and H3N2-infected groups had no cross HI antibody reaction in this study. Commonly, infection with
H3N2 viruses induces higher HI titers than those of H1N1
infection [9,14]. Wang et al. [7] found that the cleavage
site of HA antigen of H3 virus (A/Panama/2007/99) was
cleaved easier than that of H1 virus (A/New Caledonia/
20/99) in transiently transfected 293T cells possibly making the H3 viruses more immunogenic. Similarly, a
recombinant vaccine study in elderly humans using A/
Panama/2007/99 (H3N2), A/New Caledonia/20/99
(H1N1) or influenza virus type B as virus sources showed
that H3N2 virus induced significant higher HI titres than
that of H1N1 virus [15]. In contrast, the H1N1-infected
pigs in this study induced higher HI titres than that of the
H3N2-infected pigs at 12 dpi. Similarly, Kitikoon et al.
[14] showed that HI titre of the H1N1-infected pigs at 7
dpi was higher than that of the H3N2-infected pigs. However, the HI titres at 14 and 21 dpi in the H3N2 virus-

infected pigs were higher in that study. Different viruses
used in the studies may yield different results due to the
origin of those isolates. Interestingly, the antigenic site of
the H1N1 used in this study contained the changed in the
amino acid sequence of haemagglutinin which may result
in increased immunogenicity and induced more severe
clinical diseases. However, the antigenic site of the H3N2
virus used in this study had no amino acid changes. In

addition, we did not have the HI results after 12 dpi in our
study.
Recently, genetic analysis of the HA gene of Thai SIV [16]
showed that the recent Thai H1N1 virus belonged to the
classical swine H1N1 lineage and had the highest homology to the human isolate A/Thailand/271/05(H1N1). The
H3N2 subtype belonged to the human H3N2 lineage and

showed highest homology to the H3N2 human influenza
virus from the 1970s A/Bilthoven/2600/75(H3N2) [16].
Similarly, in our study nucleotide sequences of both HA
and NA genes of A/Thailand/HF6/05(H1N1) also
belonged to the classical swine H1N1 lineage and A/Thailand/S1/05(H3N2) belonged to the human H3N2 lineage. Since those viruses were isolated from the same
province and in the same year, geographic distribution
could be an explanation for the similarity of those viruses.
Interestingly, both viruses in this study were isolated from
the same farm in August 2005. We did not find any
genetic shift in those viruses or any reassortant virus such
as H1N2 subtype occurring in the farm (unpublished
data). Whole genome sequencing of all 8 genes is needed
to be evaluated in both viruses. It is possible that the new
reassortant virus might occur in Thailand since both studied viruses were isolated from the same farm. However,
our results showed that the Thai SIV subtypes, H1N1 and
H3N2, are still circulating in the pig population in Thailand since the first report in 1990. Our studied viruses
were able to induce flu-like lesions in weanling pigs. Surveillance and molecular investigation of SIV in the country should be done continuously to prevent the future
emerging or re-emerging influenza A virus in pigs population.

Veterinary Science Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol No. 55/2549). The animals were housed at the BSL2
animal facility of the National Institute of Animal Health,
Bangkok, Thailand throughout the experiment. Fifteen 22day-old crossbred SPF pigs serologically negative for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV),
Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and
SIV were obtained from a commercial farm and assigned to
3 different groups. The infected groups contained six pigs
each and were intratracheally inoculated with H1N1 and
H3N2 viruses (5 ml of 107 TCID50/ml) in group 1 and 2,
respectively. Group 3 served as a negative control group
containing three pigs which were mockedly infected with 5
ml of media (minimal essential medium (MEM)). Two pigs
from the infected groups and one pig from the control
group were necropsied at 2, 4 and 12 days post-infection
(dpi). Nasal swabs were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and
12 dpi. Following collection, nasal swabs were immediately placed in the infected MEM with 5% BSA, 300 U/ml
penicillin, 300 μg/ml streptomycin and 1–2 μg/ml trypsin)
and stored at -80°C for evaluation of virus shedding. At
each necropsy, sera were collected for assessing antibody
response, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected for virus isolation and tissue samples from all organs
were collected for microscopic lesion detection. In addition, tracheal swabs were tested for bacterial culture and
identification.

Conclusion
The results of this study may assist in the prevention and
control of SIV infection in Thailand, especially for H1N1
and H3N2 subtypes. Based on the percentages of cranioventral pneumonic lesion and times of virus shedding, the
H1N1 virus might play a major role in respiratory diseases
in weanling pigs in that farm. More works are needed in
the co-infection model with other respiratory pathogens
and in the prevention and control of the SIV-related diseases in Thailand. In this study, investigations on virus
transmissibility between sentinel animals housing
together with infected animals were not performed.
Therefore, whether these Thai H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes
will be transmitted efficiently in the field situation
requires further experimental and epidemiologic studies.

Methods
Viruses
Swine influenza virus subtype H1N1 (A/swine/Thailand/
HF6/05) and H3N2 (A/swine/Thailand/S1/05) were isolated from weanling pigs with respiratory signs in the
same farm in Chonburi province in 2005. The viruses
were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs for 3 passages and the virus concentration (107 TCID50/ml) was
evaluated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells
and stored at -80°C until used.

Experimental DesignAnimal usage and handling protocols
were approved by Chulalongkorn University-Faculty of

Clinical evaluation
Pigs were evaluated daily for respiratory disease symptoms including coughing, sneezing, tachypnea, dyspnea,
nasal discharge and conjunctivitis. Pigs were observed and
scored for the respiratory signs (ranged from 0 to 5) as
previously described [12]. Rectal temperature was also
measured daily. Fever was recorded when the rectal temperature ≥ 40°C.
Pathological evaluation
At necropsy, significant macroscopic lesions of all organs
and percentage of lung lesions were recorded. Tissue samples from all lung lobes were collected and immediately
identified for the presence of SIV-antigen by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-influenza A nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody (HB654404 B.V. EUROPEAN
VETERINARY LABORATORY, the Netherlands).

Tissue samples from all organs were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered-formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin
as described previously [4]. Sections were cut approximately 4–6 μm thick for histopathological and immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests using anti-influenza A
nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody as previously
described [17]. Microscopic lesions were scored as previously described [18] and the scores were ranged from 0 to
3; 0 = normal bronchioles, 1 = mild bronchiolitis, 2 =
moderate bronchiolitis, 3 = severe bronchiolitis.

Virus isolation
SIV was isolated from nasal swabs, sera, BALF and lung tissues according to Kitikoon et al. [12] and the titres
(TCID50/ml) were calculated according to Reed and
Muench [19]. Briefly, ten-fold serial dilutions of the nasal
swab solution were inoculated onto MDCK cells and incubated until the cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed for at
least 3 cell culture passages. Virus was identified by influenza A virus-specific staining. Prior to staining, cells were
fixed with 4% phosphate-buffered formalin and washed
with 0.5% Tween-20 in PBS (washing solution). Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-influenza A nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody diluted
1:1,000 in the washing solution containing 1% BSA
(diluting solution). After washing, the cells were incubated 1 h with the rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated
horseradish peroxidase (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria,
California) diluted 1:400 with the diluting solution. The
color was developed using a chromogen aminoethyl carbazole substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri). Each procedure contained mock-infected negative control cells and
positive control cells infected with a known-titreed virus.
RT-PCR
Sera and nasal swabs were performed to evaluate viraemia
and virus shedding using M-gene specific RT-PCR as previously described [10]. Viral RNAs were extracted using
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) from
200 μl volume of each nasal swabs and sera. The RT-PCR
was performed using Promega One step RT-PCR
(Promega, USA) containing a specially formulated
enzyme blend for both reverse transcription and PCR. The
forward and reward primers were 5' TGA TCT TCT TGA
AAA TTT GCA G 3'and 5' TGT TGA CAA AAT GAC CAT CG
3', respectively [20]. The expected amplicon size is 276 bp.
The RT-PCR was run at 94°C for 3 min for reverse transcription followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for
30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for
45 s and ended with a final extension step at 72°C for 7
min. The amplified PCR products were analyzed on a
1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay
Sera were evaluated for the HI antibody titres to both of
the SIV subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2 using 0.5% chicken
erythrocytes for haemagglutination. All sera were
absorbed with Trypsin-Heat-Periodate to reduce nonspecific inhibitors before HI testing [3]. Virus antigens utilized in the HI assays were the challenge viruses, H1N1
(A/swine/Thailand/HF6/05) and H3N2 (A/swine/Thailand/S1/05).
DNA Sequencing
Full-length HA and NA genes of the studied subtype
H1N1 and H3N2 were amplified using universal and spe-

cific primers [21,22] with some modifications. The RTPCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, purified by NucleoSpin Extract II (MachereyNagel, Düren, Germany) and cloned into pGEMT Easy
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Plasmids containing the
viral genes were purified by NucleoSpin Plasmid (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) and sequenced by using
synthetic oligonucleotides. Sequence data were edited and
analyzed using Bioedit software. The phylogenetic trees
were conducted in MEGA4 [23] using neighbor-joining
method with 1000 times bootstrapping replicates [24].
