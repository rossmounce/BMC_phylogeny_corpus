Abstract
Background: The stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXC
chemokine receptor-4 (SDF-1/CXCR4) signal has been shown
to be important in various immunological reactions. Recent
studies have suggested that CXCR4 is expressed in certain
cancer cells and that they use this chemokine receptor
efficiently for metastasis formation.
Method: The expression of CXCR4 was evaluated by
immunohistochemical study in 79 surgically resected invasive
ductal carcinomas, and the relation between the staining
pattern and clinicopathological features was examined.
Results: CXCR4 was diffusely and homogeneously expressed
in 59 cancers, which were further divided into 28 highexpression and 31 low-expression cancers by their staining
intensity. The other 20 cancers showed heterogeneous
immunoreactivity in tumor tissue, which was defined as focal

type. In comparison with the diffuse type, focal type tumors
showed significantly more extensive lymph node metastasis,
because the number and extent of metastatic nodes were
larger in the focal than the diffuse type. In the diffuse type, the
rate of node-positive cases did not show a difference in
staining intensity. However, high-CXCR4 tumors showed more
extensive nodal metastasis in comparison with low-expression
tumors. In contrast, the expression pattern of CXCR4 did not
have a significant correlation with hematogeneous metastasis.
The overall survival of these patients tended to be better in the
diffuse type than in the focal type, although the difference was
not statistically significant.
Conclusion: The expression pattern of CXCR4 was significantly
correlated with the degree of lymph node metastasis in breast
cancers. Our data suggest that CXCR4 might be particularly
important in facilitating metastasis through the lymphatic system.

Keywords: CXCR4, chemokine, breast cancer, immunohistochemistry, SDF-1

Introduction
The chemokines, a family of 8–10 kDa chemotactic
cytokines, possess a wide range of biological activities,
including the regulation of leukocyte trafficking, the modulation of hematopoietic cell proliferation and adhesion to
extracellular matrix molecules [1]. Stromal cell-derived
factor-1 (SDF-1) belongs to the CXC chemokine family
and has potent chemotactic activity for lymphocytes [2].
CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CCR4) is the only physiological receptor for SDF-1, and has also been shown to be a
co-receptor used by HIV in infecting CD4 lymphocytes
[3,4]. It is well known that peripheral blood lymphocytes
preferentially localize to peripheral lymphoid tissues, such
as lymph nodes; this is called the homing phenomenon.
144

Hematopoietic stem cells also ‘home’ to bone during fetal
life and during marrow transplantation [5]. In this context,
the SDF-1/CXCR4 signal has been shown to be a critical
molecular determinant for these events [6,7].
Muller and colleagues have examined the expression of
chemokines and their receptors in breast cancer tissue,
and explored the possibility that metastatic breast cancer
cells were responsive to stimulation by chemokines [8].
They showed that CXCR4 is highly expressed in malignant breast cancer but not in normal breast tissue, and the
ligand SDF-1 was highly expressed in bone marrow, lung
and lymph nodes, where breast cancer cells metastasize
preferentially. Moreover, they demonstrated that neutraliza-

tion with a specific monoclonal antibody against CXCR4
effectively inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer cells
to the lung or lymph nodes in mice. Similar studies have
shown that metastasis to bone marrow in neuroblastoma
[9], prostate cancer [10], and rhabdomyosarcoma [11] is,
at least in part, dependent on the SDF-1/CXCR4
pathway. Because cancer cells often share phenotypic
characteristics with hematopoetic stem cells, it is supposed that various cancers might use the SDF-1/CXCR4
pathway during their spread to other tissues [12,13].
However, the immunostaining pattern of CXCR4 in various
cancer tissues has not been well documented, although
the receptor has been shown to be highly expressed in
human brain tissue [14,15] and colonic epithelial cells
[16]. In this study we therefore examined the expression of
CXCR4 protein in surgically resected human ductal carcinomas by immunohistochemical staining, and analyzed
whether the expression pattern of this chemokine receptor
is correlated with metastatic potential and is predictive of
clinical outcome in these patients.

Materials and methods
Immunohistochemical staining

Seventy-nine invasive ductal carcinomas, which were surgically resected in the Department of Surgery, The University of Tokyo, from 1990 to 1996, were included in this
study. In all cases, ipsilateral axillar lymph node dissection
was performed. Two serial sections 3 µm thick, of tissue
fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin, were
made from a representative block of each cancer. The first
section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the
second was used for immunostaining for CXCR4. For
immunostaining, paraffin-embedded sections were placed
on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides, and air-dried at room
temperature. Deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were
heated in a microwave oven for 20 minutes in citrate buffer
to retrieve antigenic activity, then cooled for 60 minutes at
room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
inhibited by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in
methanol for 20 minutes at room temperature.
After non-specific reactions had been blocked with 10%
normal rabbit serum, the sections were first incubated with
a murine anti-human CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (BD
Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 1 hour at a dilution of
1:400. The sections were then incubated with biotinylated
rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin for 30 minutes and next
with streptavidin–peroxidase complex for 15 minutes.
Careful rinses were performed with several changes of
phosphate-buffered saline between each stage of the procedure. The color was developed with diaminobenzidine.
The sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin
and mounted. Negative controls were performed by
replacing the primary antibody with phosphate-buffered
saline.

Evaluation and statistical analysis

The immunostained specimens were evaluated by two different observers (MK and SK) without knowledge of the
clinicopathological features. In cases of diffuse type
tumors, if both investigators agreed that the staining intensity of cancer cells was clearly more than that of interstitial
infiltrates, the tumor was categorized as high-expression;
other tumors were categorized as low-expression. All statistical analyses were performed with the SAS program.
The association of staining patterns with clinicopathological features was assessed with the χ2 test and the
unpaired Student t-test. The survival rates were calculated
with the Kaplan–Meier method and P was determined by
log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered significant in all
statistical analyses.

Results
In all 79 specimens of breast cancers, normal glands were
not significantly stained, whereas interstitial infiltrates were
weakly stained with the monoclonal antibody against
CXCR4. In contrast, in all cases, at least some carcinoma
cells clearly showed positive staining in the cytoplasm,
nuclei, nucleoli, and membrane, although the staining
pattern and intensity differed between tumors (Fig. 1).
These 79 cases were divided into two groups according
to their staining pattern. In 59 (75%) cases, almost all carcinoma cells were homogeneously stained by anti-CXCR4
monoclonal antibody, and these were categorized as
diffuse type. Diffuse type tumors were further classified
into two groups according to their staining intensity in the
cytoplasm: 28 cases had high expression of CXCR4 and
31 had low expression. The other 20 (25%) tumors
showed heterogeneous staining for CXCR4 and could not
be separated by their staining intensity. Positive cells were
segregated in focal areas of the cancers or the staining
intensity varied between individual carcinoma cells,
whereas some carcinoma cells totally lacked expression of
CXCR4. These cases were all included in the focal type.
The relation between the staining patterns and clinicopathological factors is shown in Tables 1 and 2. The percentage of large tumors was relatively high in the focal
type, although the difference was not statistically significant. There were no differences in pathological type, histological grade, or estrogen receptor expression between
focal type and diffuse type tumors (Table 1). In tumors
with focal type expression of CXCR4, lymph node metastases were observed in 12 cases (60%), which tended to
be high in comparison with the diffuse type, although the
difference was not statistically significant. However, in the
12 node-positive tumors, 9 cases (75%) showed involvement of apical axillar lymph nodes (level III) or more distant
nodes, and the rate was significantly higher than in the
diffuse type (Table 3). Accordingly, the number of
metastatic nodes in the focal type was also significantly
greater than in the diffuse type (Table 3).

Figure 1

Staining patterns of breast cancers with monoclonal antibody against CXCR4. Tumors consist of carcinoma cells with different immunoreactivities,
defined as focal type (A, D). (A) Carcinoma cells located at the upper left area were positively stained, whereas cells in lower right area were
negative. (D) Each cell shows a different immunoreactivity for CXCR4; the arrow and arrowhead indicate representative positive and negative
carcinoma cells, respectively. In other cases, most carcinoma cells are diffusely and homogeneously stained, but the staining intensity differs
between the high (B, E) and low (C, F) expression groups. Original magnifications: ×40 (A–C); ×200 (D–F). Scale bars, 20 µm.

In the diffuse type, lymph node metastasis was observed
in 13 of 28 cases with high expression of CXCR4 and in
13 of 31 cases with low expression (Table 2). As shown in
Table 3, in the 13 node-positive tumors with high expression of CXCR4, the metastases were confined within N1
in 5 cases (38%), and 8 cases (62%) were associated
with N2 or more distant lymphatic metastasis, whereas
only 1 case (7.7%) showed lymphatic metastasis in N2 or
a wider area in tumors with low expression of CXCR4. In
addition, the number of metastatic nodes was significantly
greater in high expression than in low expression of
CXCR4. Therefore, among the three groups, focal type
tumors were associated with the highest number of
metastatic nodes, and the expression level of CXCR4
showed a positive correlation with the number of metastatic nodes in the diffuse type.
In contrast with lymphatic spread, venous invasion and
distant metastasis did not show a significant difference
between the focal and diffuse types, or between high and
low expression levels of CXCR4 in the diffuse type
(Tables 1 and 2). However, the cases that showed metastasis in more than two organs tended to be higher in the
focal type. Multiple metastasis was observed in 5 cases
(25%) in the focal type, and in 3 cases (11%) and 1 case
(3.2%) in the diffuse high-expression and low-expression
types, respectively.

The prognosis of patients is shown in Figure 2. In accordance with the rate of multiple metastasis, both the survival and disease-free survival rates tended to be lower in
the focal type, although the difference was not statistically
significant.

Discussion
The role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signal system has been
investigated mainly in the field of immunology, such as
hematopoiesis, lymphocyte homing, or HIV infection.
Muller and colleagues showed clearly that breast cancer
cells express CXCR4 highly, and functional blockade of
this receptor leads to the inhibition of metastasis to bone
marrow and lymph nodes (8). Their results strongly suggested the importance of chemokine signals in breast
cancer metastasis, and encouraged us to examine the
relationship between the protein expression level of
CXCR4 and the clinical features of various breast
cancers.
Initially, we proposed that most of the breast cancers
would contain carcinoma cells with various degrees of
expression of CXCR4 at the protein level and that cancer
cells with a high expression of CXCR4 would have high
metastatic potential. However, in this study we found that
most breast cancer cells expressed the CXCR4 protein
diffusely at equal levels, and heterogeneity was rarely
observed in immunohistochemical staining. In contrast,

Overall survival (A) and disease-free survival (B) were examined in patients with each CXCR4 expression pattern. P determined by log-rank tests
was 0.56 for overall survival and 0.58 for disease-free survival.

20 tumors showed heterogeneous, focal, staining for
CXCR4, which was clearly distinguished from other cases
with diffuse staining for CXCR4. In most immunoreactive
carcinoma cells, the nuclei, nucleoli, nuclear membrane,
and cytoplasm are positively stained. The localization of
CXCR4 in nuclei has not yet been described. Although
the function of this molecule in nuclei needs to be examined, this finding raises a possibility that CXCR4 might
have other unknown roles in cancer cells.
Previous studies have shown that CXCR4 is expressed in
various cancer cell lines [8,17–21], whereas the immunohistochemical characterization of CXCR4 has been
reported only in pancreas cancers in the study by Koshiba
and colleagues [22]. They described that CXCR4 was positively stained in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of pancreatic cancer cells, but not in normal pancreatic tissue, and
interstitial infiltrates showed weak staining [22]. In their
study, the expression level of CXCR4 did not show a significant relation to the clinicopathological features of those
pancreatic cancers, although they classified the tumors only
by the intensity of immunoreactive cells and did not evaluate
the staining patterns. In contrast, our results clearly indicate
that tumors with focal staining have a higher potential for
lymph node metastasis than diffuse type tumors. Although
the exact reason is not clear, one speculation is that the
focal expression of CXCR4 might reflect increased heterogeneity in comparison with diffuse type tumors, which might
be related to increased malignant potential.

R148

In our results, there was no difference in the rate of nodepositive cases between tumors with high and low expression of CXCR4. However, tumors with high expression of
CXCR4 showed more extensive lymphatic spread than
those with low expression of CXCR4, because the range
and number of metastatic nodes were significantly larger

in cases of high expression of CXCR4 than in those with
low expression. This suggests that the movement of tumor
cells from metastatic nodes to secondary lymph nodes
might be more dependent on the expression level of
CXCR4. SDF-1, the ligand for CXCR4, has been shown
to be abundantly expressed in lymph nodes, and is considered to be important for lymphocyte homing [23,24].
Therefore, when tumor cells metastasize to sentinel lymph
nodes, they are liable to be subjected to considerably
higher concentrations of SDF-1 than those staying in the
primary site of breast tissue, which might stimulate
chemokinesis of tumor cells. In this context, it might be
reasonable that tumor cells with high expression of
CXCR4 exhibit more extensive lymphatic spread than
those with low expression.
Previous experimental studies have suggested that
hematogenous metastasis to the lung or bone marrow is
partly dependent on CXCR4 in various cancers [8–11].
However, in the present study we could not detect a positive correlation between the expression pattern of CXCR4
and distant metastasis or patient survival. It is not yet clear
why CXCR4 expression is related only to lymph node
metastasis but not to distant metastasis in this study,
because SDF-1 is phylogenetically a primitive chemokine
and widely expressed in various organs as well as lymph
nodes. Among the sequential steps in the metastatic
process, the growth of disseminated cancer cells in
metastatic sites is supposed to be the most inefficient
step for cancer cells and a key regulator of overall
metastatic ability [25]. The regulation of CXCR4 expression in cancer cells in metastatic sites might therefore be
important for the development of metastasis formation.
A recent study by Helbig and colleagues has suggested
that NF-κB is a potent inducer of cell-surface CXCR4

Available online http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/5/5/R144

expression and thus has a critical role in metastasis in
breast cancer cell lines [26]. Because various inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumour necrosis
factor, and interleukin-8 are potent inducers of NF-κB, the
presence of these cytokines in secondary sites might be
crucial for cell survival through SDF-1–CXCR4 signaling.
Because these cytokines are produced mainly by immune
cells, regional lymph nodes are supposed to express the
cytokines more efficiently and abundantly than other
organs against the invasion of cancer cells. Carcinoma
cells arrested in lymph node tissues therefore seem to
upregulate the CXCR4 molecule easily through the activation of NF-κB, which might facilitate the development of
clinical metastasis and cause the discrepancy between
nodal and distant metastasis. More studies with a larger
number of cases are necessary to determine the exact role
of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signal in the development of distant
metastasis of breast cancer.

Acknowledgement

In summary, we examined the protein expression of
CXCR4 in breast cancers and found that the expression
pattern of this chemokine receptor had a significant correlation with the degree of lymph node metastasis, especially with the potential to metastasize from initially
involved lymph nodes to secondary nodes. The molecular
mechanisms of lymph node metastasis have not been satisfactorily examined, probably because there is insufficient information about the anatomy and physiology of the
human lymphatic system. In particular, little is known
about the mechanisms that mediate metastasis from
already metastatic nodes to adjacent lymph nodes.
However, the number of involved nodes has been shown
to have a profound influence on postoperative outcome in
various cancer patients [27–32]. This suggests that
lymph node metastasis, as long as it is localized to a few
local lymph nodes, can be safely controlled by surgery
alone, whereas once tumor cells have passed the first-line
defense lymph nodes they can easily spread to the whole
body. From this point of view, analysis of the detailed
mechanisms of metastasis from ‘sentinel nodes’ to
‘distant nodes’ might have significant clinical importance.
CXCR4 is supposed to be one of the important factors
facilitating the wide spread of tumor cells through the
lymphatic system.

Conclusion
In breast cancers, the expression pattern of CXCR4
showed a significant correlation with the degree of lymphatic spread but not with hematogenous metastasis. Our
results suggest the possibility that CXCR4 is involved in
the lymphatic spread of breast cancers. In particular,
CXCR4 might be important in facilitating metastasis from
‘sentinel’ to more distant lymph nodes.
