Conservation of ParaHox genes' function in
patterning of the digestive tract of the marine
gastropod Gibbula varia
Research article

Leyli Samadi* and Gerhard Steiner

Abstract
Background: Presence of all three ParaHox genes has been described in deuterostomes and lophotrochozoans, but to
date one of these three genes, Xlox has not been reported from any ecdysozoan taxa and both Xlox and Gsx are absent
in nematodes. There is evidence that the ParaHox genes were ancestrally a single chromosomal cluster. Colinear
expression of the ParaHox genes in anterior, middle, and posterior tissues of several species studied so far suggest that
these genes may be responsible for axial patterning of the digestive tract. So far, there are no data on expression of
these genes in molluscs.
Results: We isolated the complete coding sequences of the three Gibbula varia ParaHox genes, and then tested their
expression in larval and postlarval development. In Gibbula varia, the ParaHox genes participate in patterning of the
digestive tract and are expressed in some cells of the neuroectoderm. The expression of these genes coincides with
the gradual formation of the gut in the larva. Gva-Gsx patterns potential neural precursors of cerebral ganglia as well as
of the apical sensory organ. During larval development this gene is involved in the formation of the mouth and during
postlarval development it is expressed in the precursor cells involved in secretion of the radula, the odontoblasts. GvaXolx and Gva-Cdx are involved in gut patterning in the middle and posterior parts of digestive tract, respectively. Both
genes are expressed in some ventral neuroectodermal cells; however the expression of Gva-Cdx fades in later larval
stages while the expression of Gva-Xolx in these cells persists.
Conclusions: In Gibbula varia the ParaHox genes are expressed during anterior-posterior patterning of the digestive
system. This colinearity is not easy to spot during early larval stages because the differentiated endothelial cells within
the yolk permanently migrate to their destinations in the gut. After torsion, Gsx patterns the mouth and foregut, Xlox
the midgut gland or digestive gland, and Cdx the hindgut. ParaHox genes of Gibbula are also expressed during
specification of cerebral and ventral neuroectodermal cells. Our results provide additional support for the ancestral
complexity of Gsx expression and its ancestral role in mouth patterning in protostomes, which was secondarily lost or
simplified in some species.
Background
The three ParaHox genes, Gsx, Xlox, and Cdx, were first
described as a gene cluster in the invertebrate chordate
Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus) by the elegant work
of Brooke et al. 1998 [1]. ParaHox and Hox genes are
believed to have evolved from a single ancient proto-Hox
cluster composed of two to four genes prior to the divergence of cnidarians and bilaterians. Thus, they are con* Correspondence: leili.samadi@univie.ac.at

sidered evolutionary sister (or paralogue) clusters [1-7].
Vectorial expression of the ParaHox genes in anterior,
middle, and posterior tissues of amphioxus and its distinct similarities to vertebrate ParaHox gene expression
suggest that these genes may be responsible for axial patterning of the digestive tract [1,3].
Expression of ParaHox genes in deuterostomes

ParaHox gene expression and genomic organisation have
been studied extensively in deuterostomes. In Vertebrates, Gsh1 and Gsh2 genes are restricted to the central
nervous system (CNS) [8-13]. Vertebrate Xlox is

expressed both in CNS and the developing gut [14-20].
Cdx1 to Cdx4 genes of vertebrates are involved in posterior patterning, since they are expressed in posterior
parts of CNS and gut [21-24]. Within invertebrate deuterostomes, apart from amphioxus, expression of ParaHox genes has been traced in the ascidian, Ciona
intestinalis, the echinoderm, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and in a starfish, Archaster typicus [25-29]. In invertebrate deuterostomes, Gsx is expressed more anteriorly
and only in the nervous system, while Xlox and Cdx are
expressed within the gut primordium with Xlox anterior
to Cdx [25-28]. In the sea star, however, the Aty-Xlox
expression is found in the archenteron as well as in ectodermal cells near the vegetal region of early and mid-gastrula stages [29]. This expression pattern is very different
from those of Xlox homologues in other deuterostomes.
Expression of ParaHox genes in ecdysozoans

In ecdysozoans, Gsx expression has been documented in
the insects Drosophila and Tribolium [30,31]. Insect Gsx
(called ind) is expressed along a pair of medio-lateral neural columns and promotes neural precursor formation in
the medial and intermediate columns of the CNS [30,31].
The central ParaHox gene, Xlox, is lost in all insect
genomes sequenced to date. Caudal has been known as a
posterior patterning gene in several arthropods during
segmentation [32-42]. Cdx is also a posterior patterning
gene in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, this
gene is called pal-1 and patterns the precursor cells of
alae and rays in the posterior of the worm [43]. Gsx and
Xlox orthologs are absent in the nematode [44].
Expression of ParaHox genes in lophotrochozoans

Within Lophotrochozoa, expression of the full complement of ParaHox genes has been described in the polychaetes Capitella teleta, Nereis virens, and Platynereis
dumerilii [45-48]. In Capitella, Gsx is not expressed in
the gut but in some neuroectoderm cells of the anterior
brain [45]. This is very different from the expression of
Gsx in the nereid polychaetes, Nereis virens and Platynereis dumerilii [46,48]. Nereid Gsx is first expressed in
symmetrical bilateral domains in the dorso-medial episphere of the trochophore [46,48]. Later this gene is
expressed during formation of the midgut and the posterior foregut in both nereids [46,48]. Xlox is expressed
throughout the midgut in the polychaete Capitella [45].
This is also true for the Xlox genes, named Lox3 in the
leeches Helobdella triserialis and Hirudo medicinalis
[49,50]. Expression of Xlox is not reported in the nervous
system of these annelids [45,49,50]. Nereid Xlox is also
expressed in the midgut, but in contrast to Capitella and
the leeches its expression is additionally detected in the
CNS [46,48]. As in arthropods, Cdx is a posterior patterning gene in the annelids. However in Platynereis,

Page 2 of 15

Nereis, Tubifex, and Capitella there are both anterior and
posterior expression domains of Cdx [45-48,51]. Capitella Cdx is expressed in the cerebral ganglia, Nvi-Cdx
expression is detectable in the ventral nervous system,
while Pdu-Cdx is not detected in the nervous system [4548]. Expression of Cdx is also detected in more posterior
parts of the gut [45-48]. Moreover, Cdx is expressed in
the posterior ectodermal cells that form the pygidium
epidermis of both nereids [46-48]. Additionally, Cdx
expression can be traced in mesodermal cells in Capitella, Tubifex, and Platynereis [45,47,48,51].
Little is known of ParaHox genes in other Lophotrochozoa than annelids [52-55]. The only available data are
on the Cdx gene expression during the early development
of the marine limpet, Patella vulgata [53]. Pvu-Cdx is
expressed at the onset of gastrulation in the ectodermal
cells at the posterior edge of the blastopore and in the
paired mesentoblasts [53]. During trochophore larval
stage, PvuCdx is expressed in the posterior neurectoderm
of the larva, as well as in part of the mesoderm [53].
Within Mollusca, a full complement of ParaHox genes
has been shown for the chiton Nuttallochiton mirandus
and the scallop Pecten maximus [54,55]. However the
information is limited to partial homeobox sequences,
whereas expression patterns of Gsx and Xlox or chromosomal organisation of ParaHox genes have not been
reported yet in any mollusc species.
Ancestral role of ParaHox genes

Holland (2001) elaborated the hypothesis of the ancestral
role of ParaHox genes proposed by the original work of
Brooke et al. 1998 [1,3]. Holland's hypothesis proposes
that the three ParaHox genes originated from the Proto
Hox gene cluster and pattern anterior, middle and posterior gut regions in a colinear manner in basal animals [3].
According to this hypothesis, a link of Gsx and anterior
gut development existed in basal animals. However, Gsx
is not expressed in the anterior gut of deuterostomes.
This is explained by the loss of the primary mouth and
formation of a secondary mouth in deuterostomes [3].
Aim

Gastropoda is undoubtedly the most successful taxon of
the Mollusca, embracing more than 80% of all mollusc
species [56]. The vetigastropod Gibbula varia L. is a shallow subtidal top shell snail with encapsulated development. The lecithotrophic larval development is
completed within the eggs. The juveniles leave the gelatinous egg masses only after metamorphosis. In order to
elucidate the function of the ParaHox genes in molluscs
and to gain broader insights into the evolution of the
ParaHox genes in the Lophotrochozoa, we describe the
sequences as well as expression patterns for all three
ParaHox orthologues by whole mount in situ hybridiza-

tion from embryonic through juvenile stages in the top
shell Gibbula varia. This is the first report of expression
patterns of the full ParaHox complement in a mollusc.

Results
Gibbula varia life history

Gibbula varia is a dioecious species. The eggs fertilized
via copulation are laid in gelatinous egg masses (additional file 1, Figure S1A, S1B, S1C). Development of the
embryos and larvae takes place inside the egg capsule and
takes about four days. The main stages of G. varia development are presented in Table 1. Epibolic gastrulation
occurs by the micromeres rapidly spreading downwards
and enclosing the macromeres. The blastopore, being
wide at first, gradually becomes constricted at 10 to 12
hours post fertilization (hpf ), when the trochoblasts start
to become ciliated. At 16 hpf, the prototroch is clearly
visible as a circular ciliary band, separating the trochophore larva's episphere from the hyposphere (additional file 1, Figure S1D). There is no sign of apical cilia
(apical tuft) at any stage in the development of the trochophore, although the pretrochal cells were observed to
be smaller than those of the posttrochal region (additional file 1, Figure S1D). By this stage the blastopore
gradually moves to a position just below the prototroch,
forming the stomodeum. Simultaneously, the shell-gland
invagination appears as a thin patch of cells gradually
spreading over the dorsal region of the larva (additional
file 1, Figure S1D). At 18 hpf, the late trochophore larva
comprises a prototroch, the shell field surrounded by the
mantle edge, and a pedal rudiment (additional file 1, Figure S1E). The late trochophore (24 hpf ) turns into an
encapsulated pretorsional veliger larva by differentiation
of the prototroch to a distinct velum (additional file 1,

Page 3 of 15

Figure S1F). The mantle fold and mantle cavity become
visible mid-ventrally on the posterior surface of the pedal
rudiment (additional file 1, Figure S1E, S1G). At 36 hpf,
the pretorsional veliger has a velum, an apical organ
marked by apical cilia (apical tuft), a mouth opening, and
a pedal rudiment with the operculum anlage (additional
file 1, Figure S1H). The first 90° of torsion take place
between 36-48 hpf, presumably by contraction of the larval retractor (shell) muscle. This results in a 90° displacement of the mantle cavity to the right side, and, when
viewed from the front, the foot and velum are rotated
anti-clockwise in relation to the protoconch. The remaining part of torsion is completed within one day while the
velum gradually becomes reduced in size and splits ventrally (additional file 1, Figure S1I). At 60 hpf, the operculum appears in the posttorsional veliger larva (additional
file 1, Figure S1I). The radula and cephalic eyes appear
about three days after fertilization. As the eyes form, the
cephalic tentacles begin to appear as outgrowths of the
prevelar surface. The juvenile hatches on the fourth day
of development (about 96 hpf ) and after that mineralization of the shell begins. The animals become sexually
mature after 11-12 months.
Development of gut in G. varia

The development of the digestive tract starts with the
development of the stomodeum (future mouth opening)
in the trochophore (additional file 1, Figure S1E). The
mouth opens during the pretorsional veliger stage (additional file 1, Figure S1H, S1J) whereas the anus opens in
the late posttorsional stage at the site of a few ciliated
cells (anal markers). The development of the digestive
tract is very similar to that described in G. cineraria and
Haliotis tuberculata [57,58]. The digestive gland begins

Brief description of main features

Early Trochophore Larva (12 hpf)

The pretrochal cells are smaller than the posttrochal cells; prototroch starts to form by
cilliation of trochoblasts; shell gland starts to evaginate; foot rudiment and stomodaeum
are not completely formed.

Late Trochophore Larva (18-24 hpf)

The larva comprises a prototroch, shell field surrounded by mantle edge, a pedal
rudiment, and stomodaeum.

Pretorsional veliger larva (36-48 hpf)

The mantle and mantle cavity form. The larva has a velum, apical organ marked by apical
cilia, mouth opening, and pedal rudiment with anlage of operculum.

Post-torsional veliger larva (60 hpf)

The mantle lies over the back of the head and the velum gradually splits ventrally, the
operculum apears.

Metamorphotic (competence) stage (72 hpf)

Eye rudiments and cephalic tentacles begin to form in the prevelar area. The anlage of the
radula becomes visible.

Encapsulated juvenile

Velum is completely lost; eyes and cerebral tentacles are formed.

Hatchling (96 hpf)

The encapsulated juvenile hatches and shell mineralization begins.

to differentiate on the left side of the veliger just before
torsion sets in [57,58]. The gut develops from differentiated endodermal cells initially scattered within the yolk in
the pretorsional veliger. They later migrate to the yolk
boundaries to form the definitive midgut in the posttorsional veliger [57,58]. Later, the hindgut develops from
actively dividing cells of the digestive gland migrating to
their final positions in the intestine [57,58]. The competent larva's digestive system comprises a mouth opening
and a bipartite oesophagus (the anterior part immediately
behind the buccal cavity is not effected by torsion, the
mid oesophagus includes a portion affected by the torsion), a stomach with the digestive gland, the hindgut
leading to the anus that opens into the mantle cavity over
the back of the head (additional file 1, Figure S2A and
S2B). The radula anlage is a ventral differentiation of the
foregut where mesenchym cells aggregate. The radula
teeth become visible in the competent larva at the distal
end of the radula sheath (additional file 1, Figure S2A and
S2B).
ParaHox gene sequences

The entire coding sequences for all three G. varia ParaHox genes were isolated by a combination of 3' and 5'
rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE, see Methods).
3' and 5' RACE together yielded a complete cDNA of 885
bp with the complete open reading frame (ORF) of 519
bp (172 amino acids) for Gva-Gsx, a complete cDNA of
1739 bp with complete ORF of 1002 bp (333 amino acids)
for Gva-Xlox, and a complete cDNA of 1466 bp with
complete ORF of 976 bp (325 amino acids) for Gva-Cdx.
Alignments of each G. varia ParaHox amino acid
sequence to orthologs of other species are shown in additional file 2, Figure S3, S4, and S5. Beside the homeobox
which is the main region of conservation between ParaHox genes, further conserved domains are the N-terminal domain in Gsx, and the hexapeptide motifs just
upstream of the homeodomains in both Xlox and Cdx
(Additional file 2, Figure S3, S4, and S5). The classification of the G. varia ParaHox genes into their orthology
groups is apparent from phylogenetic analyses (Figure 1).
The species names and accession number of the genes
used in phylogenetic analysis are provided in additional
file 2. Although the phylogenetic analysis clearly assigns
the Gibbula paraHox genes to the Gsx, Xlox and Cdx
classes with high support values, the internal grouping
remains unclear.
ParaHox gene expression in the trochophore larva

We did not detect Gva-ParaHox transcripts by wholemount in situ hybridization (WMISH) in developmental
stages before the trochophore stage. A scanning electron
micrograph (SEM) of a late trochophore larva (18-24 hpf )
is shown in Figure 2A.

Page 4 of 15

The expression pattern of Gva-Gsx is rather dynamic.
The first signs of transcripts of Gva-Gsx are already
detected at 12 hpf in early trochophore larvae, when a
pair of intensive, bilateral expression domains appears in
the dorso-medial episphere (Figure 2B). When viewed
from the anterior, each pair of expression domains
appears to be composed of 4-5 Gva-Gsx-positive cells,
presumably in the area of future cerebral ganglia (Figure
2C). This pattern of expression continues in 18 hpf trochophores (Figure 2D and 2E). Here, the pattern of
expression becomes considerably more complex. In addition to the paired expression domains in the dorsomedial episphere, Gva-Gsx transcripts can now be
detected in a pair of cells at the tip of the developing apical sensory organ (Figure 2D and 2E). These two GvaGsx-positive cells at the tip of the apical organ do not
bear any cilia or apical tuft in the trochophore stage of G.
varia (Figure 2F). The expression of Gva-Gsx in the apical
sensory organ is restricted to two groups consisting of
three sensory cells (Figure 2G). Beside the expression in
prospective neural or sensory tissues, Gva-Gsx transcripts are also detected around the stomodeum where
they appear for the first time in trochophore 18 hpf in
two intensely stained bilateral semicircular clusters
located anteriorly at the sides of the mouth and a less
intensely stained semicircular domain at the posterior
part of the mouth (Figure 2D and 2H). Figures 2H and 2I
show the trochophore stomodaeum and Gva-Gsx expression around it at 18 hpf. About 24 hpf, Gva-Gsx is
expressed in a complete circle around the stomodeum
(Figure 2J) and in three episphere domains: a pair of adjacent cells at the tip of the apical sensory organ, and two
pairs of cell groups dorsolaterally marking presumptive
sites of future cephalic neuroectodermal differentiation
(Figure 2K).
Gva-Xlox transcription begins later than Gva-Gsx
expression. No expression is detectable until 24 hpf when
Gva-Xlox transcripts appear in a group of cells located
ventrally in the hyposphere and in a pair of symmetrical
expression domains in the medio-ventral episphere of the
trochophore larva (Figure 2L and 2M). These symmetrical expression areas are located ventrally of the more
intensely stained Gva-Gsx expression domains in the
pretrochal area. Gva-Xlox is also expressed in the hyposphere in 8-9 cells forming a semicircle around the anal
marker (Figures 2N and 2O). These weakly stained GvaXlox-positive cells are probably part of ventral neuroectoderm.
Gva-Cdx transcripts are first detected in the early trochophore larva (12 hpf ). It is expressed at 12 and 18 hpf
in two domains in the ventral vegetal plate: one in an area
of presumptive posterior neuroectoderm, the other in a
bilateral pair of cells in the interior of the larva (Figure 2P

and 2Q). Using Patella vulgata as a reference, the latter
expression of Pvu-Cdx probably marks the left and right
primary mesentoblasts (green arrows in Figure 2P and
2Q). Gva-Cdx-positive neuroectodermal cells are first
observed as a patch of cells expressing this gene in varying intensities (Figure 2P). Gradually they migrate to the
boundary of the expression area (Figure 2Q) so that they
from a circle of Gva-Cdx-expressing cells around the anal
marker at 24 hpf (Figure 2R and 2S). The expression of
Gva-Cdx around the anal marker at 24 hpf partly overlaps
with the expression of Gva-Xlox in the ventral area at this
stage, which is visible as a semicircle located ventrally
around the anal marker (Figure 2N and 2R).
ParaHox gene expression in the pretorsional veliger larva

The transcripts of all three Gva-ParaHox genes are
detected almost simultaneously in the visceral mass area
of the pretorsional veliger larva prior to torsion (36-48
hpf ), on the left side of the larva where the digestive gland
is forming (Figure 3). At this stage, the velum forms a
complete circle and a pair of apical tufts is observed in the
velar area (Figures 3A, B, and 3C). In addition to the apical tufts, there are "sensory cups" in the velar area. These
are ciliated pockets embedded within the apical ganglion
(Figure 3B). The expression of Gva-Gsx observed in the
area of the mouth opening and of the apical organ of the
late trochophore larva (Figure 2J and 2K) is retained in
the pretorsional veliger (Figure 3D). Gva-Gsx transcripts
are also detected in the ventral part of the forming digestive gland in the left side of the visceral mass (Figure 3D
and 3E). Gva-Gsx-positive signals are further detected in
the area of the mouth opening (Figure 3E) and in five cells
in the area of the apical organ (Figure 3D), the two apical
tuft cells (Figure 3F), and the sensory cup cells (compare
Figures 3B and 3D). Similar to Gva-Gsx, Gva-Xlox is
expressed in the left side of the pretorsional veliger in the
forming digestive gland (Figure 3G). The expression area
of Gva-Xlox is located in the ventral part of the digestive
gland, more dorsally but partly overlapping Gva-Gsx
expression (Figure 3G and 3H). The expression pattern of
Gva-Xlox detected on the ventral side of the episphere of
the late trochophore larva (Figure 2L and 2M red arrow
heads) is lost in the pretorsional veliger stage (Figure 3G
and 3I). Additionally, five ectodermally derived GvaXlox-positive cells appear on the right side of the larva
prior to torsion (Figure 3I). Similar to the trochophore
stage (Figure 2M and 2O), these ectodermal cells form an
incomplete circle and are presumably linked to the ventral nervous system (Figure 3J). Gva-Cad is expressed
weakly in the whole area of the nascent digestive gland of
the pretorsional veliger larva (Figure 3K). The intensity of
expression is stronger in a few cells in the dorsal area of
the visceral mass in the left side of the larva (Figure 3K
and 3L).

Expression of ParaHox genes in veliger and competent
larvae

After torsion (60 hpf ), the velum reduces in size with a
ventral split, and the mantle expands over the back of the
head (Figure 4A). As the digestive tract continues to
develop in the posttorsional veliger larva, expression patterns of Gva-ParaHox become more elaborated. At this
stage, Gva-Gsx expression in the ventral part of the digestive gland and in the area of the mouth opening persists
(Figure 4B and 4C). Sections reveal Gva-Gsx-positive
cells at the ventral border of the area of yolk-filled cells
(Figure 4D). Gva-Gsx transcripts are further apparent as
paired domains beneath the apical organ where the formation of the cerebral ganglia commences (Figures 4C
and 4D). At about three days post fertilization, expression
of Gva-Gsx fades in the digestive gland. Instead, the gene
is now expressed in the foregut around the area of the
radula anlage (Figure 4E and 4F). At metamorphosis,
when the apical sensory organ starts to dissociate, GvaGsx continues to be expressed in the area of the cerebral
ganglia (Figure 4F). Gva-Xlox expression persists on the
left side of the visceral mass from the pretorsional to the
posttorsional stages (Figure 4G and 4H). Sections
through the left side of the larva reveal that these GvaXlox-positive cells are part of the developing digestive
gland (Figure 4J). Six or seven ectodermally-derived GvaXlox-positive cells are located in the ventral part of the
visceral mass (Figure 4G, H, and 4I). Gva-Cdx is mainly
expressed in the newly formed hindgut and rectum, and
weakly in the digestive gland (Figures 4K and 4L).
Post-larval ParaHox gene expression

Serial section in situ hybridizations were used to trace the
expression pattern of all three Gva-ParaHox in the hatchling (about four days after fertilization). No positive signals for Gva-Xlox and Gva-Cad transcripts are detected
at this stage. Gva-Gsx is the only ParaHox gene that is
expressed in the most posterior part of the radula sac
during postlarval development (Figure 5). The juvenile
hatchling has a complete radula with the radula sheath,
buccal musculature, and radula bolsters (also called
odontoblastic cartilages, Figure 5A). The posterior end of
the radula sac forms the odontoblastic cushion which
consists of a single-layered epithelium arranged in a
semicircle and protruding into the sac's lumen. The epithelial cells are produced by two separated dorsolateral
mitotic centres at the end of the sac (Figure 5B). Mitotic
activity is scattered over the posterior area of odontoblastic cushions where the cells are small and undifferentiated. Towards the anterior of the cushions, the cells
gradually elongate and form the tall odontoblastic epithelial cells (Figure 5B). Gva-Gsx transcripts are mainly
detected in the paired odontoblastic cushions at the base
of the radula (Figure 5C; the weak signal observed in the
pedal area seems to be unspecific). Gva-Gsx is expressed

halves of the odontoblastic cushion (Figure 5D and 5E).
The intensity of expression of Gva-Gsx diminishes gradually from posterior to anterior, i.e. from the undifferentiated cells to fully differentiated epithelial odontoblasts
(Figure 5E).

Discussion
Is ParaHox gene expression colinear during patterning of
gut?

It has been proposed that the origin of the three germ layered animals, the Bilateria, is associated with the innovation of several gene clusters of the ANTP family, with the
Hox-cluster genes participating mainly in patterning of
the neuroectoderm, the NK-cluster genes in formation of

the mesodermal layers, and ParaHox in colinear regionalisation of the endoderm [1,3]. Of the animals studied to
date, the chromosomal linkage of ParaHox genes has
been shown only in amphioxus, mouse, and human [1,3].
The ParaHox genes are not linked in teleost fishes, the
ascidian or the sea urchin [27,28,59]. The only description of the expression patterns of all three ParaHox genes
for lophotrochozoans in relation to their genomic organi-

sation is for the polychaete P. dumerilii [48]. Here, Gsx
and Xlox are clustered and Cdx is separated, without
clear evidence of colinear expression.
We were unable to detect clear colinear expression of
ParaHox genes in Gibbula prior to torsion. If present, it is
obscured by the permanent migration of cells from the
digestive gland to their final positions in the gut, and by
torsion processes. After torsion, however, a spatially

colinear expression of ParaHox genes is obvious in the
digestive system, with Gva-Gsx patterning the mouth
opening and radula anlage, Gva-Xlox expressed in the
midgut, and Gva-Cdx in the hindgut (Figure 4 and 6).
Therefore, our results support Holland's hypothesis that
ParaHox genes are involved in gut regionalization along
the anterior-posterior body axis in protostomes [3].
There also seems to be a temporal colinearity in expression of ParaHox genes in the gradual formation of the
digestive system. In the trochophore larva, development
of the digestive system begins with the formation of the
stomodeum involving Gva-Gsx expression only (Figure
6). Gva-Xlox and Gva-Cdx are expressed at later stages in
the more posterior parts of the gut. When the patterning
of the gut is completed in the hatchling, expressions of
Gva-Xlox and Gva-Cdx cease while Gva-Gsx continues to
be involved in the patterning of the radula (Figure 6).
During postlarval development, Gva-Gsx is expressed in
the paired odontoblastic cushions of Gibbula (Figure 5).
The gradient of Gva-Gsx expression from posterior to
anterior in the odontoblastic cushions suggests that this
gene is associated with mitotic features of these cells and
their ability to divide and replace the odontoblasts, rather
than direct involvement in secretion of radula teeth.

Expression of ParaHox genes in cephalic neural and
neurosensory cells

Gastropod larvae are well provisioned with multicellular
sensory structures, but only the apical sensory organ is
typically present in both plankton-feeding and nonplankton-feeding veligers [60]. This suggests that information detected by the apical sensory organ is important
during the entire larval stage, regardless of the length of
larval life or capacity for feeding. Moreover, the apical
sensory organ disappears at metamorphosis in species

Figure 6 Summary of Gva-ParaHox expression during development of G. varia. Note that the colour codes on this figure correspond
to the same colours as arrows on the Figure 2-4.

Samadi and Steiner BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/74

where this has been studied [61]. Therefore the apical
sensory organ has functions restricted to the larval stage.
During larval development in Gibbula, Gva-Gsx exhibits
a complex pattern of expression in potential cephalic
neural cells and in the apical organ. This pattern shows
distinct similarity to Pdu-Gsx expression in the trochophore stage in which Pdu-Gsx expression is detectable in flask-shaped sensory-neurosecretory cells in the
medial forebrain [48]. Prior to torsion, the Gva-Gsx pattern is spotted in the paired apical tufts and several neurosecretory cells or sensory cups of the apical organ
(Figure 3 and 6). This gene also appears to be involved in
the formation of parts of the cerebral ganglia from the
apical sensory organ in competent larvae. This compares
well to the polychaetes Capitella, Nereis, and Platynereis,
where Gsx is expressed in the cerebral ganglia [45,46,48].
Our results may lend further support to the theory of
complex ancestral expression of Gsx that was secondarily
simplified in several lineages. In addition to Gva-Gsx
expression in the dorsal episphere of the trochophore,
Gva-Xlox is detected in a pair of expression domains
located more ventrally. It is possible that these cells contribute to neural cells of future cerebral ganglia. However
this pattern of expression is transient and is lost in later
developmental stages.
Possible expression of ParaHox genes in the trunk
neuroectoderm

Expression of ParaHox genes in ventral or dorsal neuroectoderm has been demonstrated in several species.
Within Lophotrochozoa Capl-Cdx is expressed in posterior neuroectodermal cells in the polychaete Capitella. In
Platynereis, Pdu-Gsx is expressed in a central part of the
larval ventral neuroectoderm in which somatic serotonergic neurons are identified [45,48]. Nereis is the only
species studied so far in which all three ParaHox genes
are known to be involved in patterning of the trunk neuroectoderm [46]. In Gibbula, Gva-Xlox and Gva-Cdx are
expressed around the anal marker in the trochophore larvae. It has been shown that these cells express SoxB in the
prospective neuroectoderm of the trunk in Patella [62].
Therefore, it is likely that these cells expressing Gva-Xlox
and Gva-Cdx contribute to the trunk neuroectoderm.
Temporary expression of Gva-Cdx in ventral neuroectoderm earlier during development, and expression of GvaXlox in overlapping regions at a later stage (Figure 6), may
suggest that Gva-Cdx contributes to patterning of ventral
neuroectoderm upstream of Gva-Xlox.
Hypothetical ancestral ParaHox gene expression

Comparative analyses across the animal kingdom show
conservation of ParaHox gene expression domains in distinct tissues. Comparing Platynereis ParaHox gene
expression to that of the orthologues in deuterostomes

Page 11 of 15

and ecdysozoans, Hui et al. 2009 confirmed Holland's
hypothesis about the ancestral role of ParaHox genes,
suggesting that the pattern of Gsx expression in the protostome-deuterostome ancestor was complex, with Gsx
domains in several structures of the nervous system, and
was secondarily reduced to small patches of expression in
the anterior CNS in several lineages [48]. Holland's model
further suggests that Gsx was expressed in the mouth
region of the last bilaterian ancestor [3]. Lack of Gsx
expression in the anterior gut of deuterostomes is
explained by loss of the primary mouth and evolution of a
new secondary mouth [3]. If this be the case, protostomes
should maintain Gsx expression in anterior gut structures. Capitella results do not support such a model since
CapI-Gsx expression is limited to a restricted region of
the forming brain. The expression of Nvi-Gsh, Pdu-Gsx,
and Gva-Gsx described here provides further support to
the ancestral mouth patterning role of Gsx [46,48].
Xlox is expressed during midgut development in annelids [45,46,48-50]. Pdu-Xlox and Nvi-Xlox are also
expressed in the nervous system. In Gibbula, Gva-Xlox
pattern is detected in the digestive gland and ventral neuroectoderm, and expression in potential cephalic nerve
cells is transient. Therefore, our results provide additional
support that the expression of Xlox may reflect an ancestral function in central regions of the gut as well as a role
in the nervous system. If this hypothesis is true, however,
it would once more imply secondary simplification and
loss of neural Xlox expression in several lineages [45].
However, the possibility that ancestral Xlox expression
was simple and has become more complicated in different lineages cannot be ruled out since Xlox is expressed in
ventral neuroectoderm in Nereis and Gibbula, in addition
to cerebral ganglia, but is lacking in all other protostomes
studied to date [46].
Cdx shows a complex, dynamic pattern of expression in
cells of the ectoderm, endoderm and possibly mesoderm,
extending to extremely anterior regions in all annelids
studied so far [45-48,51]. This anterior expression of Cdx
was also recently described in the acoel flatworm, Convolutriloba longifissura [63]. ClCdx is expressed in the commissures posterior to the statocyst, following the paths of
nerve tracks and extending anteriorly. ClCdx is also
expressed in an area surrounding the eyes, forming direct
connections to the brain commissure [63]. Cdx anterior
expression seems to be the case in the limpet Patella as
well, in which the gene is expressed in posterior ectoderm
during gastrulation. The posterior ectodermal expression
starts to fade in the trochophore, while expression
extends anteriorly in the shape of an incomplete equatorial ring of ectodermal cells that corresponds to some
cells of the prototroch [53]. Later in the young free swimming trochophore, Pvu-Cdx expression in the prototroch
disappears. The gene is also transiently expressed in the

Samadi and Steiner BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/74

stomodeum [53]. Gva-Cdx expression differs from that of
Pvu-Cdx by being absent during gastrulation. In addition,
we did not detect any sign of Gva-Cdx expression in the
trochophore prototroch or stomodeum. In contrast, the
detection of Cdx in mesentoblasts and in ectodermal cells
situated on the posterior most part of the ventral side of
the trochophore is a common feature in Gibbula and
Patella. These are some of the cells that also express
SoxB, a neurectodermal marker [62]. Therefore, Cdx
seems to pattern the ventral neuroectoderm as well as
mesentoblasts in gastropods. Anterior expression of Cdx
was not observed during the larval development of Gibbula at any stage. This can be either interpreted as secondary loss of the anterior function of Cdx in Gibbula, or
as a gain of function for this gene in several tissues in
other species. The first possibility has been favoured
since it can be explained by the separation of the gene
from the cluster [48]. Nonetheless, variety in the pattern
of expression of Cdx in different animals can serve as
another example for the plasticity of gene expression during evolution. Whether the expression of the ParaHox
genes in nervous systems is related to their function in
the gut, i.e. innervation of different parts of the gut and/
or to feeding behaviour, awaits future research. Gene
function experiments, therefore, would be desirable to
give us better understanding of how these genes are
employed.

Conclusions
The expression of ParaHox genes during anterior-posterior development of the digestive system (with Gsx patterning the mouth and foregut, Xlox patterning the
midgut or digestive gland, and Cdx patterning the
hindgut) suggests that these genes are involved in anterior-posterior specification of the G. varia gut. Our
results support Holland's hypothesis that ParaHox genes
are involved in gut regionalization and offer further support to the ancestral mouth patterning role of Gsx in protostomes. All three ParaHox genes of G. varia are
involved in patterning of the nervous system. Gva-Gsx
and Gva-Xlox are expressed in neural precursors of cerebral ganglia, the expression domain of these two genes
does not coincide in the episphere and fades away in the
case of Gva-Xlox in later larval stages. Additionally, GvaGsx patterns the neurosensory cells of the apical organ.
Gva-Xlox and Gva-Cdx pattern the ventral neuroectoderm with Cdx possibly acting upstream of Xlox. During
postlarval development, Gva-Gsx transcripts are
detected in the precursor cells of odontoblasts at the base
of the radula sac. This is probably a molluscan novelty
related to radula evolution. Further research in other
molluscan classes and use of experimental tools, e.g.
RNAi, are required to improve our understanding of gene

functions and enable a sound reconstruction of their
ancestral role.

Methods
Snail culturing

The adults of Gibbula varia (L.) were collected in Crete,
Greece and cultured in 150-200 liter aquariums in artificial sea water at 22°C (salinity 28°). Copulation was
induced by lowering the salinity a few degrees by adding
fresh water to the aquariums at 17°C (personal observation of Achim Meyer, The Johannes Gutenberg University
of Mainz).
Cloning of ParaHox genes

DNA extraction was performed using the PeqGOLD Tissue DNA kit (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH, Polling,
Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Homeobox fragments of ParaHox genes were obtained by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA
using Hox degenerate primers described previously
[64,65]. These primers produce PCR amplification products that are mixtures of different fragments containing
homeobox. The PCR fragments were purified using peqGOLD MicroSpin Cycle-Pure Kit (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH, Polling, Austria). Purified PCR products were
cloned with the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen
GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). In total 255 clones were
sequenced and all eleven Hox genes (Samadi and Steiner,
unpublished data) and the three ParaHox genes were
recovered. RNA was extracted from blastula and gastrula
stages, trochophore, veliger, and competent larvae, and
encapsulated juveniles using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN
Vertriebs GmbH, Vienna, Austria). The cDNA from each
developmental stage was synthesized using SuperScript®
III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe,
Germany). The homeobox fragments were used to design
primers for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE).
The RACE was performed with modifications according
to Schramm et al. 2000 [66]. For further details on RACE
protocol see supplementary data of [67]. The RACE
products were cloned by the Topo-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and sequenced using
a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and run on an ABI
3130xl DNA analyser automated capillary sequencer.
Orthology assignment and phylogenetic analyses

The initial orthology of the ParaHox genes was tested by
searching against GenBank non-redundant protein databases using the BlastX algorithm. The genes were named
Gva-Gsx, Gva-Xlox, and Gva-Cdx and deposited in GenBank under accession numbers HM136802, HM136803,
HM136804, respectively. Orthology assignment of the
genes was made based on phylogenetic analysis. The phy-

Samadi and Steiner BMC Developmental Biology 2010, 10:74
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/10/74

logenetic analyses were carried out using amino acid
sequences. We compiled a ParaHox gene alignment
including representatives of bilaterians. Sequences were
aligned using the program ClustalX v.2.0.10. First the
homeobox region was aligned, then, using the homeobox
as an anchor, the flanking regions were aligned and subsequent trimming carried out manually. Bayesian inference on amino acid data using MrBayes version 3.1.1 was
applied for orthology analysis, with 2 × 4 Markov chains
under the Jones amino acid substitution model [68].
Chains were run for five million generations with a sampling frequency of 1000 generations and the burnin set to
5000 generations.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization

The Maxiscript T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase kit
(Ambion, Austin, USA) was used to synthesize the sense
and anti-sense probes that were labelled by the Dig RNA
labelling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Vienna,
Austria). WMISH was performed with few modifications
after Lespinet et al. 2002 [69]. DIG-labelled riboprobes
were detected colourimetrically with NBT/BCIP substrates. The details of modifications can be found in [67].
For WMISH, embryos were mounted in 70% glycerol and
the expression patterns were documented. For serial-sectioned in situ hybridization, embryos were embedded in
Epoxy resin after in situ hybridization according to the
standard protocols, and sectioned with a microtome at a
thickness of 2 μm. Sections were stained with Eosin using
standard histological protocols.
Scanning-electron microscopy

Larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M
saline phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, washed three times for 15 min in
PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide (NaN3), postfixed in
osmium tetroxide (1% in distilled water for 2 h at room
temperature), followed by three washes in distilled water,
and dehydrated in a graded ethanol/acetone series. Drying was performed either by critical point dryer or chemical drying with HMDS (Hexamethyldisilazane). After
drying, the samples were mounted on scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) stubs, sputter-coated with gold, and
observed with a LEO 1430VP scanning electron microscope.
