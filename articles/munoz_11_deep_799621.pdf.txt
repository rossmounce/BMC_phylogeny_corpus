Deep mitochondrial divergence within a
Heliconius butterfly species is not explained by
cryptic speciation or endosymbiotic bacteria
Astrid G Muñoz1*, Simon W Baxter2, Mauricio Linares1,3 and Chris D Jiggins2

Abstract
Background: Cryptic population structure can be an indicator of incipient speciation or historical processes. We
investigated a previously documented deep break in the mitochondrial haplotypes of Heliconius erato chestertonii
to explore the possibility of cryptic speciation, and also the possible presence of endosymbiont bacteria that might
drive mitochondrial population structure.
Results: Among a sample of 315 individuals from 16 populations of western Colombia, two principal mtDNA
clades were detected with 2.15% divergence and we confirmed this structure was weakly associated with
geography. The first mtDNA clade included 87% of individuals from northern populations and was the sister group
of H. erato members of Andes western, while the second clade contained most individuals from southern
populations (78%), which shared haplotypes with an Ecuadorian race of H. erato. In contrast, analysis using AFLP
markers showed H. e. chestertonii to be a genetically homogeneous species with no association between
mitochondrial divergence and AFLP structure. The lack of congruence between molecular markers suggests that
cryptic speciation is not a plausible explanation for the deep mitochondrial divergence in H. e chestertonii. We also
carried out the first tests for the presence of endosymbiontic bacteria in Heliconius, and identified two distinct
lineages of Wolbachia within H. e. chestertonii. However, neither of the principal mitochondrial clades of H. e.
chestertonii was directly associated with the patterns of infection.
Conclusions: We conclude that historical demographic processes are the most likely explanation for the high
mitochondrial differentiation in H. e. chestertonii, perhaps due to gene flow between Cauca valley H. e. chestertonii
and west Pacific slope populations of H. erato.

Background
Sequences derived from the mitochondrial genome are
commonly used both in species delimitation and historical phylogeography. For example, deep divergence in
mitochondrial DNA sequences (mtDNA) between
related individuals is often taken as evidence for the
existence of cryptic species [1-4]. The discovery of cryptic species-level variation has important implications for
characterising biodiversity and for studies of speciation.
Nonetheless, it is now well recognised that inference of
evolutionary processes and species boundaries from

mitochondrial sequences alone can be problematic [5,6].
For example, similar patterns of divergence can be due
to host-parasite interactions, whereby selection leads different molecular markers to show different histories [7].
Mitochondrial lineages may also be retained through
admixture between divergent species or populations [8],
or perhaps due to unusual population structures [9,10].
Indeed, in diverse tropical radiations, mtDNA ‘barcoding’ may perform rather poorly as a species identification tool [6]. It is therefore of general interest to pursue
individual cases of deep mtDNA divergence in order to
determine how often such divergence is indeed an indicator of cryptic species-level variation.
Heliconius butterflies are an excellent ecological and
genetic system for studying speciation. These unpalatable butterflies are recognized for their diversity of wing

color patterns associated with mimicry [11,12]. The classical example of this adaptive radiation occurs between
the comimetic species H. erato and H. melpomene.
These butterflies co-occur in Central and South America and show convergent changes in their color pattern.
They are represented by more than 20 different geographic forms which are considered subspecies [13].
Neutral molecular markers show geographic structure
among subspecies of H. erato and H. melpomene, and
most named races fall within a particular geographic
clade [13-16]. However, in H. erato two forms: H. e.
hydara and H. e. chestertonii are polyphyletic in the
mitochondrial phylogeny [13,16]. Individuals of H. e.
chestertonii fall into two distinct mtDNA clades that
show over 2% divergence, with no clear biogeographic
explanation [17]. H. e. chestertonii is found in the western Colombian Andes on disturbed, dry habitats and
forms a hybrid zone with the geographically closest subspecies: H. e. venus. Although H. e. chestertonii is a
member of the erato clade, it has an unusual wing color
pattern compared with the characteristic red/yellow/
black pattern of H. erato. H. e. chestertonii has an iridescent and melanic forewing while the hindwing displays a
broad yellow band. The co-mimic for this wing color
pattern is H. cydno weymeri f. gustavi, a member of the
H. melpomene clade.
Rapid evolution in the early stages of the speciation
process is expected to lead to incongruence between
morphological and molecular markers [14,18,19]. However, in H. e. chestertonii the deep divergence in the
mitochondrial haplotypes is not readily explained
through ancestral polymorphism or hybridization. Such
mtDNA division has not been observed in any other
Heliconius taxon to date. One possible explanation
might be that structure is due to the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria [19-21]. Wolbachia are intracellular
bacteria and infect numerous species of arthropods and
nematodes [22]. Interactions between these microorganisms and their eukaryotic hosts often has consequences
for host reproduction, leading in some cases to breaks
between populations or species [23,24]. Wolbachia are
inherited maternally, so their evolutionary fate is tightly
linked to that of the mitochondrion [25]. Furthermore,
hybridization between H. e. chestertonii and its nearby
relative, H. e. venus, produces partially infertile eggs
[26]. Hybrid sterility of this form can also be generated
by endosymbionts where parental populations are
infected by different strains.
However, an alternative hypothesis for the mtDNA
break within the continuous distribution of H. e. chestertonii is cryptic reproductive isolation, unrelated to endosymbionts. Given the emphasis on wing color pattern in
Heliconius speciation, a potential case of cryptic speciation would be of considerable interest. To investigate

Page 2 of 11

these possibilities we first extend previous mtDNA sampling to better document the distribution of mtDNA
lineages. In order to test for cryptic speciation, we have
then complemented these data with nuclear Amplified
Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP) markers, to
provide a comparison with nuclear biparentally inherited
markers. Finally, we have tested for a variety of endosymbiotic bacteria to investigate whether mtDNA structure could be a result of patterns of infection among
populations.

Results
Mitochondrial relationships

Our expanded sampling of mitochondrial sequences confirms the deep divergence within H. e. chestertonii, with a
similar topology obtained with either Bayesian or parsimony analyses (Figure 1). As expected, both taxa studied
here are members of the E1 clade, containing H. erato
species from Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and west
Ecuador [16]. H. e. venus forms a monophyletic group
together with some members of H. e. hydara, while individuals of H. e. chestertonii showed a complex relationship with other subspecies and is a polyphyletic taxon.
Three principal clades are observed. The first primarily
includes individuals collected in populations north of the
hybrid zone in Calima River Valley (Figure 1). These haplotypes form a sister group to the other subspecies of the
western clade E1: H. e. petiverana, H. e venus and H. e.
hydara (Figure 1). The second principal clade includes
the west Ecuadorean race H. e. cyrbia and primarily individuals of H. e. chestertonii collected in southern populations (Figure 1). The third clade, with only three
northern individuals, is sister to all races of H. erato in
the western E1 clade and south clade of H. e. chestertonii.
The different clades involving members of H. e. chestertonii has strong bootstrap support (100%) and a high posterior probability (1) (Figure 1). A haplotype network
analysis revealed the same relationships among populations (Additional file 1). Three main star-like species/
geographical clusters, H. e. venus, H. e. chestertonii-North
and H. e. chestertonii-South. A topology test showed that
monophyly of H. e. chestertonii could be strongly rejected
(P <0.0001 Shimodaira-Hasegawa test).
Genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within
populations, showed that H. e. chestertonii is more polymorphic than H. e. venus (θ W = 0.01 and θ W = 0.003
respectively, Table 1). We then subdivided H. e. chestertonii to compare polymorphism within (1) northern and
southern populations and (2) the two principal clades
obtained in the phylogenetic tree. The northern and
southern populations had similar levels of DNA polymorphism (θ W = 0.01 and 0.009 respectively) with no
fixed difference between groups and 35 shared mutations
(Table 1). Nonetheless, the comparison between clades

showed 17 fixed differences and just three shared mutations (Table 1). The Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA) showed that the maximum variability is within
populations (63.65%) and only 18.22% of the total variability was due to geography, and a further 18.13% explained
by species (groups in the AMOVA). When the species
were analyzed separately, we found higher genetic structure among localities of H. e. chestertonii than between H.
e. venus populations (FST = 0.2775, P < 0.01; FST = 0.1197,
P > 0.5; Additional file 2).
AFLP Analysis

Of the 327 loci examined, we found that 318 were polymorphic, representing 97% of loci. Genetic diversity statistics estimated from AFLP data showed that
populations are differentiated within and among species
(Additional file 3, P <0.001). Both H. e. venus and H. e.
chestertonii had values of genetic diversity of 27.6%,
while the hybrid zone populations (Calima River Valley)
were more diverse than in any allopatric locality (H. e.
chestertonii (CV) = 29% and H. e. venus (CV) = 30%).
The AFLP-based bayesian population assignment test
identified two clusters which correspond to H. e. chestertonii and H. e. venus (Figure 2a, L = -20596.26). We
compared the mean likelihood values for all runs with

the statistic ΔK and confirmed that K = 2 is the best
estimate for this data. Additionally, the PCA analysis
gave a consistent result, with 56% of the variance in the
data explained by differences between species (Additional file 4). In addition, all the populations used in this
study showed significant genetic structure for AFLP
markers (Figure 3 and Additional file 2). The AMOVA
showed that 48% of the total variation in the AFLPs was
explained within populations and the 42% among
groups, which correspond to species in our analysis.
When we excluded H. e. venus and repeated the
AMOVA grouping data for northern and southern
populations of H. e. chestertonii, only 9% of the variation
was accounted for by geography. In order to test for
congruent differentiation between AFLP and mtDNA
markers, we ran a Structure analysis using only those
individuals with data for mtDNA and assuming K = 3
(putatively representing H. e. venus and the two H. e.
chestertonii clades). This analysis showed no evidence
for any population structure associated with the mtDNA
clades (Figure 2b).
Interactions with endosymbionts

PCR analysis of 307 wild caught H. e. chestertonii did
not identify any positive results for Ricketsia and Spiroplasma infection. All screens were run with a positive

clade-A (Table 2). The presence of this endosymbiont is
almost exclusive to H. e. chestertonii, with just one
female H. e. venus from the hybrid zone infected. Most
of these butterflies were collected in northern populations of H. e. chestertonii (85%). However not all individuals of the same population were infected and some
localities did not show the presence of Wolbachia.

Discussion
It is generally accepted that genetic differentiation
between subpopulations can lead to the formation of
new reproductively isolated species over time [27]. Phylogeographic analysis can be useful in identifying both
cryptic species and incipient subpopulations on the way
to becoming new species [2,3]. The analysis of this cryptic population structure can show how genetic, behavioral and ecological processes have acted during the
earliest stages of speciation [27]. Studies that include
independent sources of evidence, such as morphological
comparisons, reproductive biology and phylogenetics,
are necessary to understand the history of diverging
lineages and to resolve species identification [28].
In this study, we first confirmed the unusual degree of
mitochondrial divergence within H. e. chestertonii. Our
analysis was based on a broad sampling of H. e. chestertonii which enabled the confirmation of two principal
groups of mitochondrial haplotypes (Figure 1 and Additional file 1). Our broader sampling showed that these
clades are not completely associated with the geographic
distribution of the populations, as had been suspected
previously (Figure 2b) [17]. The principal haplotype

technical PCR error, although we cannot completely
rule out the presence of a divergent strain of one of
these bacterial taxa. In contrast, 7% of individuals
screened (10 females/11males) were infected with Wolbachia. There are two major clades within Wolbachia,
both of which are known to infect insects. Interestingly,
the sequences derived from our samples fell into both

groups (Figure 1 and Additional file 1) were on average
2.15% divergent, similar to that estimated in previous
studies [13,15,17]. This is considerably more divergent
than within any other race of H. erato, apart from the
trans-Andean biogeographic break which occurs within
the distribution of the race H. e. hydara as described
above. However, here there is no clear biogeographic
context for this population structure. Nonetheless, the
haplotypes do show some geographic structure, with
87% of northern individuals being Clade 1 and 78% of
southern individuals Clade 2.
Cryptic speciation

If cryptic speciation was occurring, whereby two species
are considered as one based on wing pattern morphology, we would expect the mtDNA haplotypes to be
associated with a detectable level of genetic differentiation at nuclear markers. Such cryptic species have been
identified in a diversity of organisms such as bryophytes,
fungi, elasmobranches and arthropods [1,4,27,29-32].
Within Heliconius, a case of cryptic speciation has been
recently discovered in two closely related species: H.
timareta and H. melpomene [33]. However, in H. e. chestertonii we have found that despite deep divergence in
mtDNA between two principal clades (2.15%), the AFLP
analysis shows H. e. chestertonii to be a genetically
homogeneous species (Figure 2).
Endosymbionts infection

Discordance between maternally inherited genetic markers and those transmitted biparentally, can often be
explained by the spread of endosymbionts such as Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Rickettsia, Arsenophonus, Cardinium, and others [34-37]. In most of the cases, these
parasites are transmitted together with the mitochondrial genome through the egg cytoplasm, so associations
over time can be detected when the mitochondrial genome is analyzed [38]. Some of these endosymbiont
microorganisms can lead to reproductive alterations in
their arthropod hosts and will lead to divergence
between populations [19,39]. This is the first published
study in which the presence of endosymbionts is tested
in Heliconius, and we have identified two distinct
lineages of Wolbachia within H. e. chestertonii. However,
neither of the principal mitochondrial clades of H. e.
chestertonii is directly associated with the infection
(Table 2). We did not find evidence of presence of other
endosymbionts in populations of H. e. chestertonii. We
should add a caveat to our results, which is that our
PCR assay might not have detected all possible infected
individuals. Indeed, the stage of development of the host
can lead to over or underestimates of the real density of
Wolbachia within populations [22]. This study was limited to adult butterflies, and future analysis might

Page 6 of 11

include other stages such as egg, larvae and pupae.
Nonetheless, the density of Wolbachia estimated within
H. e. chestertonii populations (7%) would be considered
“very low” according to a recent classification [40]. In
the future it would be interesting to further investigate
the phenotypic effects of this infection. It is also of
course possible that another endosymbiont is present,
which was not sampled with the PCR assays described
here. However, for the moment there is no evidence
that the mitochondrial structure in H. e. chestertonii is a
result of endosymbiont infection. In summary, we have
provided no evidence that mtDNA structure in H. e.
chestertonii is due to either cryptic speciation or endosymbiotic bacteria. This leaves historical processes
within the species as the most likely cause for the
pattern.
Historical processes

Climatic changes during glacial and interglacial periods
can lead to contractions, expansions and fragmentations
of populations [41-44]. The 2% divergence between
lineages within H. e. chestertonii suggests divergence
within approximately the last million years. Even without such vicariance, isolation by distance can lead to
genetic structure within species. Intriguingly, recent
work on H. cydno has shown that this species similarly
has a marked genetic break in the center of its Cauca
Valley range (Arias and Salazar, pers. comm.). In both
species, southern Cauca populations are more closely
related to subspecies on the Pacific coast than those in
the North. A plausible scenario is that the Cauca Valley
has been subject to a double colonization first from the
central Andean valleys and subsequently from the Pacific populations in the west. Nonetheless, we are not
aware of any geological evidence that would support
this hypothesis.

Conclusions
Our genetic analysis shows that northern and southern
populations of H. e. chestertonii are genetically differentiated, but with only frequency differences in mtDNA
clades, and no corresponding genetic structure at
nuclear markers, despite the deep divergence (2.15%)
between the two principal mtDNA clades. Our results
support the assertion that mtDNA evidence alone
should be used with caution in delimiting species
boundaries. In this case, divergent haplotype groups
within populations could not be explained by either
cryptic speciation or endosymbiont infections.
Methods
Butterflies collections

Between 1997 and 2008, 315 specimens of Heliconius
erato chestertonii and H. e. venus were collected at 15

Muñoz et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:358

different localities throughout southwest Colombia and
one locality in Panama (Figure 1, Table 3). These two
members of H. erato form a bimodal hybrid zone mantained by strong premating isolation in one of these
Colombian localities [17,26]. The body of each butterfly
was separated from the wings and preserved in DMSO
96% at -80°C, while wings were kept in glassine envelopes. Tissue and wings are stored in the Instituto de
Genética, Universidad de los Andes, Colombia or in
CDJs laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK (Table 3).
DNA Butterflies extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from one-third of thorax
or the end of the abdomen using DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s tissueextraction protocol. The thorax extractions were used
for mitochondrial and AFLPs analysis and abdomen
extractions for endosymbiont assays (Table 3).
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial
markers

At least six individuals of each population, three of each
sex when possible (Table 3), were used to amplify a
total of 1551 bp of a mitochondrial region, which covered the subunits I and II of Cytocrome Oxidase (CO
I_II) and leucine-tRNA. We used published primers and
PCR conditions from Beltran et al. 2002 for our amplifications. Subsequently, all the PCR products were purified for sequencing with Exonuclease I and Shrimp
Alkaline Phosphatase enzymes (Fermentas) and sent to

Macrogen Sequencing Service (Macrogen, Korea).
Sequence editing was performed using Geneious Ver.
5.4 [45]. Sequences were aligned using Clustal W Ver.
2.0 [46] and checked for reading-frame errors in protein-coding regions with MacClade Ver. 4.08 [47].
Sequences were deposited in GenBank (Access numbers:
JF912810-JF912880). To complement our analysis, we
included publicly available sequences of H. erato
[13,16,17] and sequences of H. hecalesia and H. clysonimus were used as outgroups (GenBank access numbers
in Additional file 5). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using two different approaches: Maximum-Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI).
Maximum-parsimony (MP) methods were implemented in PAUP 4.0b8 [48], using a heuristic search
and tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping option. A majority rule consensus tree was computed whenever multiple equally parsimonious trees
were obtained. Parsimony bootstrap support values
were estimated through 1000 bootstrap replicates. A
Bayesian analysis was conducted with GTR + I + G
nucleotide substitution model, which was the best-fit
model obtained in JModel Test Ver. 0.1.1 [49] based
on a Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test (HLRT). Bayesian inference (BI) was carried out using four simultaneous chains for ten million generations of Markov
Chain Montecarlo (MCMC), sampling every 100 generations. The consensus tree and posterior probability
of the nodes was estimated with Mr Bayes Ver. 3.1
[50,51].

Topology test and population genetics analysis

The Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) log-likelihood test, as
implemented in PAUP 4.0b8 [48,52], was used to test
the monophyly of H. e. chestertonii. To test this a priori
hypothesis, BI analysis was first performed using the
same parameters as described earlier but this time by
enforcing the monophyly of the complex as a topological constraint. The SH test was then used to compare
trees obtained from both constrained and unconstrained
analysis.
We described DNA polymorphism in populations of
H. e. chestertonii and H. e. venus (Table 1) with DnaSP
Ver. 5.10.01 [53]. The measures employed were: 1)
number of segregating sites (S), 2) number of haplotypes
(h), 3) average pairwise number of differences between
sequences (k) and genetic diversity (θ). An analysis of
molecular variance (AMOVA) and F ST values were
obtained in ARLEQUIN Ver. 3.5 to determine genetic
structure between populations from mtDNA markers
[54]. To investigate relationships between populations a
haplotype network was constructed using NETWORK
Ver. 4.5.1.6 [55].
AFLPs, cluster analysis and genetic distance

Genomic DNA from 185 individuals from all the populations, was used for DNA fingerprinting with AFLP
markers (Table 3). The DNA quality was quantified by
spectrophotometry and only samples with an A260/
A280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0 were used. For AFLP
generation, we applied the general method of Vos et al.
[56] with minor modifications. The AFLP ® Core
Reagent Kit (Invitrogen) was used for the digestion of
125 ng of DNA for samples with EcoRI and MseI
restriction endonucleases and the ligation with EcoRI/
MseI adaptors, following the manufacturers protocol.
The best primer combinations (high variation and fragments between 50 to 400 bp) for pre- and selective
amplifications were selected by comparing the final
sequencing of eight different primer mixtures for 48
individuals (Additional file 6). Sixteen samples chosen at
random were run in duplicate during the screening process to ensure reproducibility of selected markers. As
result, primers carrying a single selective nucleotide at
the 3-end: EcoRI+A (5-GAC TGC GTA CCA ATT CA3) and MseI+C (5-GAT GAG TCC TGA GTA AC-3)
were chosen for the pre-amplification cycle. The conditions in this first PCR were: denaturation at 94°C for
60s, followed by 20 cycles with denaturation at 94°C for
30s, annealing at 56°C for 60s and extension at 72°C for
120s. Subsequently, selective amplifications were performed using four pairs of primers that contained three
selective bases and EcoRI primers were labelled with the
fluorescent dyes: EcoRI (FAM)+ACA/MseI+CGT, EcoRI
(VIC)+ACC/MseI+CGT, EcoRI (PET)+ACT/MseI+CGT

Page 8 of 11

and EcoRI (NED)+ACG/MseI+CAC. For these amplifications we applied a touchdown PCR of 12 cycles with
denaturation at 94°C for 30s, an annealing temperature
with 0.7°C stepwise reduction from 65°C to 56°C for 60s
and extension at 72°C for 120s, after which 23 additional
cycles were run with fixed annealing temperature of 56°
C for 30s. AFLP reaction products were labelled with an
internal size standard (GeneScan™-500 LIZ™) and run
on an ABI 3730 automated DNA sequencer (Applied
Biosystems). Fragment data were collected and analysed
with GeneMapper Ver. 4.0 (Applied Biosystems). All
bands were visually confirmed and only unambiguous
loci between 50 and 400 bp were included in the analysis. Each individual genotype was manually assessed. A
binary data matrix of presence (1) or absence (0) of
bands of each size by sample was generated.
We used the presence/absence matrix of AFLP fragments to differentiate all individuals and populations
using a Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in
the program Structure Ver. 2.3.3 [57,58]. The number of
clusters (K) was determined by comparing the likelihood
ratios for K values between 1 and 6. Previous runs
including more than 6 clusters were done and the likelihood values were lower and are not shown in this analysis. Each likelihood value was estimated with runs that
involved a burn-in of between 104 and 107 MCMC generations with 10 interactions. An admixture model
under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
was implemented in the runs. The best number of clusters was confirmed with the ad hoc statistic ΔK [59].
Additionally we implemented a principal component
analysis (PCA) using the software Genetix Ver. 4.05.
[60] to confirm the results and variation of our data.
Measures of heterozygosity and variation were estimated
with AFLP-SURV Ver.1.0 [61] and with an AMOVA in
Arlequin [54].
Determination of the presence of endosymbionts

A total of 301 individuals (at least 10 from each population), were used to search for the presence of endosymbionts (Table 2 and 3). We used PCR to test for the
presence of Wolbachia, Ricketsia and Spiroplasma in H.
e. chestertonii and H. e. venus. Where the presence of
Wolbachia was detected, additional PCR was carried out
to determine the Wolbachia clade (A or B). Amplifications were carried out with specific primers that amplified the wsp gene of Wolbachia (A and B-clade) and
16S rDNA for the other two bacteria (Table 4). We
designed three novel specific primers from our Heliconius wsp gene sequences in addition to those proposed
by Zhou et al. 1998 (Table 4). Different combinations of
these primers allowed us to determine the presence of
Wolbachia (diagnostic combination: H81F/H691R), Wolbachia A-clade (H308F/H691R) and Wolbachia B-clade
