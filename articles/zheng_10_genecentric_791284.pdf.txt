Gene-centric association analysis for the
correlation between the guanine-cytosine
content levels and temperature range
conditions of prokaryotic species

Abstract
Background: The environment has been playing an instrumental role in shaping and maintaining the
morphological, physiological and biochemical diversities of prokaryotes. It has been debatable whether the wholegenome Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content levels of prokaryotic organisms are correlated with their optimal growth
temperatures. Since the GC content is variable within a genome, we here focus on the correlation between the
genic GC content levels and the temperature range conditions of prokaryotic organisms.
Results: The GC content levels in the coding regions of four genes were consistently identified as correlated with
the temperature range condition when the association analysis was applied to (i) the 722 mesophilic and 93
thermophilic/hyperthermophilic organisms regardless of their phylogeny, oxygen requirement, salinity, or habitat
conditions, and (ii) partial lists of organisms when organisms with certain phylogeny, oxygen requirement, salinity
or habitat conditions were excluded. These four genes are K01251 (adenosylhomocysteinase), K03724 (DNA repair
and recombination proteins), K07588 (LAO/AO transport system kinase), and K09122 (hypothetical protein).
To further validate the identified correlation relationships, we examined to what extent the temperature range condition of an organism can be predicted based on the GC content levels in the coding regions of the selected
genes. The 84.52% accuracy for the complete genomes, the 84.09% accuracy for the in-progress genomes, and
82.70% accuracy for the metagenomes, especially when being compared to the 50% accuracy rendered by random
guessing, suggested that the temperature range condition of a prokaryotic organism can generally be predicted
based on the GC content levels of the selected genomic regions.
Conclusions: The results rendered by various statistical tests and prediction tests indicated that the GC content
levels of the coding/non-coding regions of certain genes are highly likely to be correlated with the temperature
range conditions of prokaryotic organisms. Therefore, it is promising to carry out “reverse ecology” and to
complete the ecological characterizations of prokaryotic organisms, i.e., to infer their temperature range conditions
based on the GC content levels of certain genomic regions.

Background
There are countless ways in which prokaryotes influence
our daily life. For example, they mediate the chemical
cycles that convert key elements of life into biologically
accessible forms; they make certain nutrients/metals/
vitamins available to their biological hosts; and they can
also be used to breakdown hydrocarbons and treat
crude oil leakages. On the other hand, the environment
has undoubtedly left footprints on the morphological,
physiological and biochemical diversities of prokaryotes
during the evolution. The close interactions between
prokaryotes and the environment, especially driven by
horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination,
have made prokaryotes the most genetically diverse
superkingdoms of life [1].
Temperature is one of the elements characterizing the
ecological contexts of prokaryotic organisms. The
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
Microbial Genome Project Database (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi) uses five terms to categorize the temperature range an organism grows at,
where cryophilic refers to -30° to -2°C, psychrophilic
refers to -1° to +10°C, mesophilic refers to +11° to +45°
C, thermophilic refers to +46 to +75°C, hyperthermophilic refers to above +75°C, and organisms that live at
ranges that overlap with more than one category are
labeled as the one corresponding to the largest overlap.
It has been reported that temperature can possibly influence the ecological, physiological and genomic properties of a prokaryotic organism in multiple aspects. For
instance, at the population-level, temperature was
shown to have caused compositional and functional
shifts in microbial communities [2]; at the cellular level,
temperature was shown to have a significant effect on a
variety of growth parameters (e.g., optical density, viable
cell numbers, and cell dry mass) [3], structure and ion
permeability of cell membranes [4], affinity for substrates (e.g., glycerol and nitrate) [5,6], circadian
rhythms [7], and virulence functions [8]; and, at the
molecular level, temperature was shown to be correlated
with the nucleotide content, codon usage and amino
acid composition [9-12], structure/function/stability of
proteins [13,14], topological properties of metabolic networks [15], expression of certain genes (e.g., heat-and
cold-shock response genes) [16-18], etc.
Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content is one of the genomic
traits that have been hypothesized to be correlated with
the temperature condition of an organism. Since the GC
pair is bound by three hydrogen bonds while the adenine-thymine (AT) pair is bound by two hydrogen bonds,
it has long been expected that organisms growing at
higher temperature would have a higher proportion of
GC than AT pairs. However, it remains ambiguous

whether the whole-genome GC content level of an organism is correlated with its temperature condition. Analysis
on 368 bacterial species seemed to have confirmed the
existence of the positive correlation between the wholegenome GC content level and the optimal growth temperature of prokaryotes [19]. However, later analysis indicated that the sample size, presence of outliers, as well as
some other factors that may affect whole-genome GC
content levels (e.g., mutational bias, genome size, oxygen
requirement, nitrogen utilization, habitat, salinity and
alkalinity) could potentially introduce bias towards the
association analysis and lead to questionable conclusions
[20-22]. Actually, organisms living at high temperature
have mechanisms other than increasing GC content, such
as thermophile-specific enzymes (e.g., reverse gyrase) [23]
or certain dinucleotides that may contribute to thermostability [24], to maintain the double stranded structure
of the DNA.
It is worthy of notice that the GC content can be substantially variable within the same genome. For instance,
the GC content in coding regions is often higher than
that of the whole genome [25]. And, if a DNA fragment
is obtained via a recent horizontal gene transfer event,
its GC content tends to exhibit different variation patterns from the native parts of the genome. Despite the
lack of obvious correlation between the whole-genome
GC content level and the optimal growth temperature,
studies have shown that the GC content levels of certain
genes (e.g., ribosomal and transfer RNA genes) are significantly correlated with the optimal growth temperatures [26]. Also, as shown in Fig. 1, the non-coding
region surrounding the gene menB (naphthoate
synthase) can be drastically different for mesophilic and
thermophilic/hyperthermophilic organisms. Inspired by
these preliminary investigations, we here focus on the
correlation relationships between the genic GC content
levels and the temperature range conditions of prokaryotic organisms.

Data sets
Genomes

Among the 895 complete prokaryotic genomes available
from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/, July 2009
release), 829 genomes are accompanied with characterizations of temperature range conditions in NCBI’s
Microbial Genome Project Database (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi). The temperature range
of a prokaryotic organism is characterized by one of
the five terms – cryophilic, psychrophilic, mesophilic,
thermophilic and hyperthermophilic; however, the
organisms are unevenly distributed under these five
temperature range conditions, with the majority falling

into the category mesophilic (Table 1). To maximally
take advantage of the provided information regarding
organisms’ temperature range conditions as well as to
obtain statistically significant results, we excluded the
cryophilic and psychrophilic categories from further
analysis, merged 57 thermophilic and 36 hyperthermophilic organisms into the same category (labeled as

thermo/hyperthermo-philic), and then focused on the
722 mesophilic versus 93 thermo/hyperthermo-philic
organisms.

KEGG Orthology (KO) IDs, and a total number of 6,026
KO groups are being covered. We considered genes
with the same KO IDs as orthologous, so that they can
be used to estimate the distribution of the GC content
level surrounding each gene (corresponding to a unique
KO ID) in various genomes. For each gene, we obtained
the GC content levels of both the coding and surrounding non-coding regions, where the non-coding region
starts from the end of the previous gene till the start of
the next gene with the coding region of the current
gene being excluded. As the coding and non-coding
regions were treated independently, we used genomic
region to refer to either of them in the rest of the paper.

Methods
Our association analysis consisted of two steps – statistical tests and prediction tests. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical tests were first carried out to identify
those genomic regions of which the distribution patterns
of the GC content levels are different for organisms of
different temperature range conditions but are irrelevant
to the phylogenetic distribution of the organisms or the
distribution of other environmental factors. The support
vector machine (SVM)-based prediction tests were then
carried out to determine whether the temperature range
condition of a prokaryotic organism can be inferred
from the GC content levels of the genomic regions
selected via the statistical tests.
Statistical tests
KS tests on the complete list of organisms

The GC content estimates for each genomic region can
be organized into two groups – one consisting of those
obtained from the 722 mesophilic organisms and the
other consisting of those obtained from the 93 thermo/
hyperthermo-philic organisms. The KS test was conducted to determine whether these GC content levels
are distributed differently for these two groups of organisms of different temperature range conditions. Specifically, the GC content of a genomic region was
considered as potentially correlated with the temperature range condition if its corresponding p-value was
less than 0.001. In order to increase the stability of the
identified correlation relationships, we also adopted the
bootstrap strategy [27] to repeatedly perform the KS test
on 90% of the randomly selected mesophilic organisms
versus all the thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms for
200 iterations. Those genomic regions that were consistently selected in all the 200 KS tests, denoted as {gcomplete}, were then taken for further analysis.
KS tests on partial lists of organisms with each individual
phylum being excluded in turn

The distribution of the mesophilic organisms in various
phylogenetic groups are different from that of the

Page 4 of 10

thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms. Observe from
Fig. 2 that mesophilic organisms mainly fall into the
Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla;
whereas, thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms mainly
fall into the Crenarchaeota, Firmicutes and Euryarchaeota phyla. This may prompt one to ask whether the
difference in the phylogenetic distributions of these
organisms also contributes to the difference in the distributions of the GC content levels of the genomic
regions in {gcomplete}.
To examine whether the distribution of the GC content level is correlated with the phylogenetic origin of
an organism and whether the temperature range condition and the phylogenetic origin are coupled in being
correlated with the distribution of GC content levels, we
should ideally perform the multi-variate ANOVA [28]
or chi-square test [29]. However, the multi-variate
ANOVA assumes that all sample populations under different conditions are normally distributed and have
equal variance, which is not necessarily satisfied for our
small data set. The chi-square test requires that predictor variables are categorical, which is not satisfied in our
case since the predictor variable, the GC content level,
is continuous. We therefore turned to the approach of
leaving an individual phylum out and performing the KS
test on the remaining organisms. The KS test on the
partial list of organisms was performed 26 times with
one phylum being excluded for each time. The genomic
regions in {gcomplete} that were also selected when a phylum was excluded, {g –phylum}, can be viewed as correlated with the temperature range condition but
irrelevant to the distribution of the phylum being
excluded. And, the genomic regions that were shared by
all {g–phylum}’s can then be viewed as correlated with the
temperature range condition but irrelevant to the distribution in any phylum.
KS tests on partial lists of organisms with particular oxygen
requirement, habitat or salinity conditions being excluded

Various physiological features, including the gram stain,
shape, arrangement, endospores, motility, salinity, oxygen requirement, habitat, organisms that the prokaryote
is pathogenic in, and the related disease, are together
with the temperature range conditions provided in
NCBI’s Microbial Genome Project Database for each
prokaryotic genome. Besides the temperature range condition, we were also interested in the features regarding
the salinity, oxygen requirement, and habitat, because (i)
these features characterize the basic environment that
an organism prefers to or has been found to live in, and
(ii) these features can be specified by using controlled
vocabularies.
Observe from Table 1 that the distribution of the
mesophilic organisms under various oxygen requirement, habitat and salinity conditions is different than

that of the thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms. To
investigate the possible interactions among different
environmental factors in their being correlated with the
GC content levels, we adopted similar strategy as for the
phylogenetic factors, i.e., to exclude organisms of a particular oxygen requirement/salinity/habitat condition
and then conduct the KS tests on the remaining organisms. This procedure was repeated for all the oxygen
requirement, salinity, and habitat conditions. The genomic regions in {gcomplete} that were also selected when a
particular environmental condition was excluded is

factor
denoted as g −condition , and can be considered as correlated with the temperature range condition but irrelevant to the distribution in the environmental condition

Statistical tests on the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD)

The reported association analysis on the genomic and
environmental traits might be prone to the annotation
errors at both the genomic and environmental sides.
At the genomic side, since the annotations in the
KEGG database involve both computation-based and
manual curation [30], our estimates for the GC content levels in the coding/non-coding regions based on
the KO annotations can be trusted. At the environmental side, however, there may exist errors in the
NCBI’s Microbial Genome Project Database. For
instance, it has been shown that the oxygen requirement annotations and/or habitat annotations of some
prokaryotic organisms are problematic [31,32]. To
examine to what extent the error in the environmental
annotations may have affected our association analysis,
we used the environmental annotations provided by

the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) [33] and performed similar statistical tests. The GOLD database
characterizes the ecological context of each organisms
in 17 aspects, including the temperature range, oxygen
requirement, salinity and habitat conditions. However,
these two databases are not always consistent. For
instance, the salinity condition of the species Rhodobacter sphaeroides KD131 is annotated as halophilic in
the GOLD database but non-halophilic in the NCBI’s
Microbial Genome Project Database; and the habitat
condition of the species Candidatus Methanoregula
boonei is annotated as fresh water in the GOLD database but terrestrial in the NCBI’s Microbial Genome
Project Database. A systematic comparison of the
environmental annotations of the two databases
revealed that ~11.51% of the organisms have different
temperature range annotations, ~15.6% of the organisms have different oxygen requirement annotations
(see Fig. 3), and for the salinity and habitat conditions
different vocabularies are adopted. By using the environmental annotations in the GOLD database, we performed all the above-mentioned KS tests, including
those based on the complete list of the genomes as
well as those based on the partial lists of the genomes
with certain phylogenetic/oxygen requirement/habitat/
salinity categories being excluded.
Prediction tests

From the statistical point of view, the significance of the
correlation relationships between the temperature range
condition and the GC content levels of the selected
genomic regions can be measured by the p-values
derived from the KS tests. On the other hand, if the
temperature range condition of an organism is predictable based on the GC content levels in the selected
genomic regions, then the correlation relationships
between the two traits can be further justified.

Figure 3 Comparisons of environmental annotations in the NCBI and GOLD databases for the 895 complete prokaryotic genomes. For
temperature range, the number of annotated organisms for three dominant conditions (mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic) are
shown in blue, green and brown, respectively. For oxygen requirement, the number of annotated organisms for three dominant conditions
(aerobic, anaerobic and facultative) are shown in blue, green and brown, respectively.

For the prediction test, each organism was represented
by a feature vector consisting of the GC content levels
of the selected genomic regions. A cross validation procedure [34] was applied to estimate the prediction accuracy. That is, the collection of the mesophilic genomes
and the collection of the thermo/hyperthermo-philic
genomes were each randomly partitioned into two portions. The portions with 10% of the genomes from both
collections were used for testing to estimate the classification accuracy, while the other portions with 90% of
the genomes were used for building a SVM-based classifier. This partition-training-and-testing procedure was
repeated for 500 times to obtain the average prediction
accuracy. The estimate for the prediction accuracy was
benchmarked against the prediction accuracy rendered
by random guessing. To facilitate such comparisons, we
enforced that for each cross validation experiment the
same number of organisms (93 vs. 93) for both temperature range conditions were used so that the accuracy
rate rendered by random guessing is 50%. Note that the
500 repeats of the cross validation procedure could
allow us to sample a variety of combinations of mesophilic organisms so that the estimate of the prediction
accuracy was unbiased to particular sub-collections of
mesophilic organisms.
To test the generalizability of the identified correlation
relationships, we also applied the SVM-based classifier
to predicting the temperature range conditions of 17
mesophilic and 17 thermo/hyperthermo-philic in-progress genomes in NCBI’s Microbial Genome Project
Database (see Table S-2 of the supplementary material),
as well as 29 mesophilic and 29 thermo/hyperthermophilic metagenomes in the Integrated Microbial

Genomes (IMG/M) system [35] (see Table S-4 of the
supplementary material). The prediction accuracy for
these in-progress genomes and metagenomes was averaged cross the 500 SVM classifiers, each of which was
derived from the training phase of the above-mentioned
cross validation procedure.

Results and discussion
We here discuss the results of the statistical and prediction tests.
Genes selected based on the complete list of organisms,
{gcomplete}

A collection of 413 genomic regions (including the coding and non-coding regions of 80 genes, the coding
regions of 197 genes, and the non-coding regions of 56
genes) were consistently detected in all the 200 bootstrap KS tests and were included into {gcomplete}. To find
out the biological implications underlying these 413
genomic regions, we performed enrichment analysis to
determine which KEGG pathways are over-represented
by the pertinent genes of these genomic regions. The
enrichment factor of a KEGG pathway is defined as the
ratio of the percentage of the genes involved in this
pathway among the genes in {gcomplete} to the percentage
of the genes involved in the same pathway among all
the genes being considered. And, a KEGG pathway was
considered to be enriched if its enrichment factor is
greater than 1. Here we summarize the KEGG pathways
with the 10 largest enrichment factors in Table 2.
It can been seem from Table 2 that one of the most
enriched KEGG pathways is cell motility. It has been
reported that the temperature affects bacterial

movements in both chemotaxis (ko02030) and flagellar
assembly (ko02040). For instance, flagella synthesis in
Escherichia coli, Proteus sp. and Salmonella sp. are all
inhibited at higher incubation temperature [36]. And, as
for chemotaxis behavior, most motors of a motile bacterial cell spin exclusively clockwise at very low temperatures so that the cell tumbles more frequently; and,
when the environment temperature is incremented,
the cell usually show some increase in average translational velocity [37,38]. Note that styrene degradation
(ko00643), ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis
(ko00130), and streptomycin biosynthesis (ko00521) are
also among the top 10 enriched KEGG pathways, suggesting that these pathways are also subject to thermal
influence. In accordance with these computation-based
findings are the following biological experiment-based
findings that are documented in various publications: (i)
An increase of the temperature from 32°C to 40°C effectively decreases the styrene degradation rate of Rhodococcus pyridinovorans PYJ-1 to ~66% of the optimum
value [39]. (ii) Ubiquinone-8 formation in Escherichia
coliK-12 strain AB 2847 was greatly affected by temperature variations – the rate of converting 2-octaprenyl
phenol to ubiquinone-8 reached the maximum at 32°C,
while virtually no reaction at all occurred at a temperature of 0°C [40]. And, (iii) Production of streptomycin
in Streptomyces griseus ATCC 12475 was suppressed at
elevated growth temperature, and even failed at 34°C or
above [41]. These findings demonstrated that our computation-based analysis on the correlation between
genomic and ecological traits may guide experimental
investigations on the mechanisms of prokaryotic organisms adapting to environmental changes.
When based on the GC content levels of the genomic
regions in {gcomplete}, the prediction accuracy, averaged
over the 500 cross-validation experiments, was 92.45%
for the complete genomes, and was 92.05% for the inprogress genomes. Note that both of the accuracy rates
were significantly higher than the 50% accuracy yielded
by random guessing.

Genomic regions shared by all experiments
on the partial lists of organisms

There were four genomic regions in {gcomplete } consistently selected during all the KS tests on the partial lists
of organisms with particular phylogenetic/oxygen
requirement/habitat/salinity categories being excluded.
Table 3 summarizes the mean and standard deviation of
the GC content level in each of these four genomic
regions for mesophilic as well as thermo/hyperthermophilic organisms. Observe that the GC content levels in
these four regions tend to be higher in mesophilic than
thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms, which confirms
the hypothesis that prokaryotic organisms living in high
temperature range conditions do not necessarily rely on
high GC contents to cope with their environment
[23,24].
These four genomic regions correspond to the coding
regions of K01251 (adenosylhomocysteinase), K03724
(DNA repair and recombination proteins), K07588 (LAO/
AO transport system kinase), and K09122 (hypothetical
protein), and are interpreted as temperature-correlated
but irrelevant to the distribution in various oxygen
requirement, salinity, habitat and phylogenetic groups.
Some of these computation-based findings can be further
supported by experiment-based findings. For instance,
K01251 reflects a common adaptation mechanism at high
temperatures, because all the residues forming the network of aromatic and hydrophobic contacts and the residues potentially involved in cofactor binding are fairly
well conserved among the hyperthermophilic but not in
the mesophilic organisms [42]. Hyperthermophilic organisms may require DNA damage repair (K03724) to be
unusually effective to cope with the destabilization of the
DNA at high temperatures [43]. And, micro-array experiments on the Escherichia coli strains (record GDS1848)
that had been entrained in the high temperature conditions (41.5°C degrees) also showed that the expressions of
K03724 (lhr) and K07588 (argK) were significantly different than those of the wild strain that lives at 37°C
degrees [44,45].

The phylogenetic trees of these four genes were built
by using ClustalW2 [46] and Phylip [47], and are shown
in the supplementary material. Based on these trees, we
calculated the evolutionary distances between organisms
of the same temperature range (intra-temperature) and
the evolutionary distances between organisms of different temperature range conditions (inter-temperature).
On average, the inter-temperature distances are 1.12,
2.29, 1.54, and 2.13; and, the intra-temperature distances
are 0.79, 1.80, 1.16 and 1.48 for K01251, K03724,
K07588, K0912, respectively. Therefore, in terms of the
evolutionary trajectories of these four genes, organisms
of the same temperature range conditions are closer to
each other than they are to organisms of different temperature range conditions. When comparing the number
of neighboring species with the same temperature range
conditions in the phylogenetic trees built from the
four genes against that based on the 16S rRNA genes
(Table 4), we did not observe statistically significant differences, indicating that phylogenetically close species
tend to inhabit the same temperature range conditions.
When based on these four genomic regions, the prediction accuracy, averaged on the 500 cross-validation
experiments, was 84.52% for the complete genomes
(84.46% for mesophiles, 85.09% for thermo/hyperthermophiles), 84.09% for the in-progress genomes (83.05% for
mesophiles, 85.13% for thermo/hyperthermo-philes), and
82.70% for the metagenomes (79.31% for mesophiles,
86.21% for thermo/hyperthermo-philes), respectively, all
of which were much higher than the 50% accuracy rendered by random guessing. It should be noted that with
less than 1% of the elements in {gcomplete} as the features,

the prediction accuracy only degraded 8.6% when compared to that rendered by the entire {gcomplete}, suggesting
that these four genomic regions are predominantly correlated with the temperature range condition.
Association analysis based on the environmental
annotations in GOLD

When the KS tests were conducted on the mesophilic
vs. thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms based on the
temperature range annotations in the GOLD database,
eight genomic regions were consistently selected out of
the tests on the complete list of organisms and on the
partial lists of organisms with particular phylogenetic/
oxygen requirement/habitat/salinity categories being
excluded. These genomic regions include the coding
regions of K01251 (adenosylhomocysteinase), K03724
(DNA repair and recombination proteins), K07588
(LAO/AO transport system kinase), K08289 (purine
metabolism), and K09122 (hypothetical protein), and the
non-coding regions of K00261 (glutamate dehydrogenase), K03809 (Trp repressor binding protein), and
K07008 (currently unclassified). Note that the coding
regions of K01251, K03724, K07588 and K09122 were
the genomic regions consistently selected when the KS
tests were based on the temperature range annotations
in the NCBI’s Microbial Genome Project Database. That
is, despite the 11.51% inconsistency in the temperature
range annotations in the NCBI and GOLD databases,
the four genomic regions were always identified as to
possess GC content levels that are correlated with the
temperature range conditions, suggesting their robustness to the possible annotation errors in the databases.

Genomes whose temperature range conditions were
consistently mis-classified

There were six genomes whose temperature range conditions were consistently mis-classified (in at least 80%
of the cross validation experiments that they were used
for testing), whether the prediction was based on the
entire {gcomplete} or just the four genomic regions. The
optimal growth temperature and the temperature range
conditions of these six genomes are summarized in
Table S-3 of the supplementary material. This result
may prompt us to re-check the current temperature
range condition annotations of the NCBI’s Microbial
Genome Project Database. For example, we did find evidence to support our prediction for Deinococcus geothermalis DSM 11300 and did observe inconsistent
annotations in the NCBI database for the temperature
range conditions of Methanococcus aeolicus Nankai-3
and Exiguobacterium sp.AT1b.Deinococcus geothermalis
DSM 11300 is labeled as mesophilic in the NCBI’s
Microbial Genome Project Database, but is actually
thermophilic with an optimum growth temperature of
about 45°C to 50°C [48]. Methanococcus aeolicus
Nankai-3 grows at temperatures between 20-55°C [49],
and Exiguobacterium sp. AT1b grows at temperatures
between 15-55°C [50]. The growth temperatures of both
Methanococcus aeolicus Nankai-3 and Exiguobacterium
sp. AT1b cross the boundaries of NCBI’s definition for
mesophilic and thermophilic organisms and overlap
more with the mesophilic category. However, Methanococcus aeolicus Nankai-3 is labeled as mesophilic while
Exiguobacterium sp. AT1b is labeled as thermophilic in
the NCBI’s Microbial Genome Project Database. These
examples suggest that the correlation relationships
between certain genomic and ecological traits of prokaryotic genomes can potentially facilitate “reverse ecology”
[51], i.e., to fill/refine the environmental annotations of
prokaryotic organisms based on their genomic features.

Conclusions
We have investigated the correlation relationships
between the GC content levels in the coding and surrounding non-coding regions of individual genes and
the temperature range conditions of prokaryotic organisms based on the statistical tests and prediction tests.
Through the KS tests conducted on all the mesophilic
and thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms, we have
identified 413 genomic regions (277 coding and 136
non-coding regions) whose GC content levels show different distribution patterns for organisms under different temperature range conditions and that can be
considered as potentially correlated with the temperature range condition. When these 413 genomic regions
were used to predict the temperature range condition of
an organism, the prediction accuracy can reach 92.45%

Page 9 of 10

for the complete genomes and 92.05% for the inprogress genomes. Four of these 413 genomic regions
corresponding to the coding regions of K01251 (adenosylhomocysteinase), K03724 (DNA repair and recombination proteins), K07588 (LAO/AO transport system
kinase), and K09122 (hypothetical protein) were consistently selected when the KS tests were conducted on
partial lists of organisms with particular phylogenetic/
oxygen requirement/habitat/salinity conditions being
excluded and/or when the environmental annotations in
the NCBI’s Microbial Genome Project Database or in
the GOLD database were used. When these four genomic regions were used to predict the temperature range
condition of an organism, the prediction accuracy
reached 84.52% for the complete genomes, 84.09% for
the in-progress genomes, and 82.70% for the metagenomes. Considering that they only account for less than
1% of all the 413 genomic regions potentially correlated
with the temperature range condition but can to a great
extent retain the prediction accuracy, we may interpret
these four genomic regions as the core of the temperature range-correlated. Our results have also demonstrated that the correlation relationships between the
genomic and ecological traits can potentially facilitate
reverse ecology.
