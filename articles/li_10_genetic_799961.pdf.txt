41 genomes

Abstract
Background: Mitochondria are a valuable resource for studying the evolutionary process and deducing phylogeny.
A few mitochondria genomes have been sequenced, but a comprehensive picture of the domestication event for
silkworm mitochondria remains to be established. In this study, we integrate the extant data, and perform a whole
genome resequencing of Japanese wild silkworm to obtain breakthrough results in silkworm mitochondrial (mt)
population, and finally use these to deduce a more comprehensive phylogeny of the Bombycidae.
Results: We identified 347 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mt genome, but found no past
recombination event to have occurred in the silkworm progenitor. A phylogeny inferred from these whole
genome SNPs resulted in a well-classified tree, confirming that the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, most
recently diverged from the Chinese wild silkworm, rather than from the Japanese wild silkworm. We showed that
the population sizes of the domesticated and Chinese wild silkworms both experience neither expansion nor
contraction. We also discovered that one mt gene, named cytochrome b, shows a strong signal of positive
selection in the domesticated clade. This gene is related to energy metabolism, and may have played an important
role during silkworm domestication.
Conclusions: We present a comparative analysis on 41 mt genomes of B. mori and B. mandarina from China and
Japan. With these, we obtain a much clearer picture of the evolution history of the silkworm. The data and
analyses presented here aid our understanding of the silkworm in general, and provide a crucial insight into
silkworm phylogeny.

Background
Mitochondria have a genetic system which is different
and distinct from the nuclear genome. They have a rapid
tempo of nucleotide substitution and present a special
form of maternal inheritance [1]. The domesticated silkworm, B. mori, is the model organism of Lepidoptera,
which has been producing industrial silk for humans over
a period of more than 5,000 years [2]. It embraces more
than 1,000 inbred strains worldwide [3], and has recently
been serving as a bioreactor [4]. There are two major
populations of B. mandarina: notably the Chinese, with a

Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China

haploid chromosome number of 28 (equal to those of
B. mori), and the Japanese, with a haploid chromosome
number of 27. They have different geographic distributions [3]. In 2006 Arunkumar et al. [5] analyzed six complete mt genomes to construct the phylogeny for the
Bombycidae family, and although the concurrence of
their methods found the Chinese B. mandarina to be the
progenitor species of B. mori, some of their methods (ML
phylogeny) also tentatively proposed that Chinese and
Japanese B. mandarina share a clade, belonging to a single, monophyletic group on the phylogenic tree, distinct
from B. mori. Based on the same data, Pan et al. [6] concurred with the consensus of Arunkumar et al., that the
Japanese B. mandarina is a more distant taxon from the
domesticated silkworm than the Chinese B. mandarina.

A clearer picture for the Bombycidae phylogeny in
confirmation of this became desirable. Here, we take
advantage of 41 mt genomes (covering both wild silkworm groups and the domesticated silkworms) to again
infer the ancestor of B. mori, and arrive at compelling
evidence confirming the conclusions of that the apparent progenitor of B. mori is the Chinese B. mandarina,
in confirmation of both Arunkumar et al and Pan et al.
The domesticated silkworm has evolved to be completely dependent on humans for survival, and many
domestication-related genes have been found to be
selected for, when comparing the domesticated silkworm with the Chinese wild silkworm, accounting for
2.9% of the genome-wide genes [7]. This remarkable
footprint by selection effect implied a potential selection
imprint left in the silkworm mt genome. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that variants in mt genome were often subjected to selection [8-10]. With
availability of genome-wide resequencing data from 40
silkworms, here we have the opportunity to make
numerous comparisons and to investigate the phylogeny
of silkworm mitochondria, in order to study whether
the silkworm mt population has experienced any expansion or contraction, and to detect the selection effect
shaping on the mt genome.

Methods
Whole genome resequencing of Japanese wild silkworm

The pupa of a single individual of Japanese wild silkworm was used to extract genomic DNA, based on a
standard protocol for genomic DNA extraction. We followed the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina) to prepare DNA library. Briefly, we made it by following the
workflow on Illumina Genome Analyzer II system: cluster generation, template hybridization, isothermal amplification, linearization, blocking, and denaturization and
hybridization of the sequencing primers. Then the Illumina base-calling pipeline (SolexaPipeline-0.3) was
applied to get sequences from the fluorescent images.
Short read data have been deposited in the NCBI Short
Read Archive under the accession number SRA009886.
Public data availability

Through NCBI Short Read Archive http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Traces/home/ with accession number
SRA009208, we downloaded all of the 40 silkworm resequencing data (see Table 1), including 29 domesticated
silkworms and 11 Chinese wild ones, detailed information of which can be found elsewhere [7], the silkworm
nuclear reference genome sequence was derived from
the SilkDB [11] (http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb/ or
http://silkworm.genomics.org.cn/). From GenBank
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ we obtained three mt genome sequences (accession numbers AB070264,

Page 2 of 10

AY301620, and NC_003395) and their annotations,
which were serving as references. We used these reference genomes in all of our consensus assembly below.
AB070264 represents the strain C108, which served as
the domesticated population reference. AY301620 was
used as the Chinese wild mitochondria reference, which
is from Ankang in Shanxi Province of China [6].
NC_003395 is a Japanese wild individual from Tsukuba,
Ibaraki, Japan [12], and we map our resequencing data
(Japanese wild silkworm) onto it. Mt genome sequence
of Antheraea pernyi (NC_004622) and Eriogyna pyretorum (NC_012727) were also downloaded to be applied
as outgroup when reconstructing phylogeny.
Reads alignment and consensus assembly

Although we only included the mt genome sequence in
the analysis, we prefer to map raw short reads onto the
whole genome [including nuclear DNA sequence and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence], in order to
make alignment more reliable. Due to the fact that
three sorts of resequencing data of silkworm have been
in hand - which are the domesticated group, the
Chinese wild population, and the Japanese wild population - there must be three different references to be
used by program SOAP v1.09 [13]. So we built three different reference genomes which are the silkworm
nuclear reference genome sequence with C108 mtDNA
sequence, with Chinese wild mtDNA sequence and with
Japanese wild mtDNA sequence. The mapping results
showed that Chinese wild silkworms have a higher mismatch rate than the domesticated ones (see Table 1),
which suggests a high sequence diversity in Chinese
wild group, even in the intraspecific comparison
between Chinese wild variety Ankang and the Chinese
wild reference (which is also from Ankang in Shanxi
Province of China). Followed by SOAPsnp [14], which
based on Bayesian theory, we calculate the posterior
probability of each possible genotype at every genome
position, from the alignment results for each sample.
Then the consensus was structured by the highest probability. 41 consensus sequences have been put into the
Genbank under accession number GU966591GU966631.
SNP detection and experimental validation

We used SOAPsnp [14] to call SNPs for each variety.
After setting
-u -r 0.01 -m,
six steps were used to filter out the unreliable variants:
1) we set Q20 quality cutoff; 2) two unique reads were
allowed at least; 3) the SNPs had to be at least 5 bp
away from each other; 4) the approximate copy number
of flanking sequences had to be no more than 2; 5) P
value of the rank sum test had to be no less than 0.05;

6) the number of unique mapped reads had to be
greater than or equal to half of the number of total
mapped reads.
To evaluate our SNP calling strategy, we randomly
selected 50 sites for PCR-Sanger dideoxy sequencing
validation using the AB 3730XL. After manually checking all the intensity trace files, we found that all the
sites were confirmed by the PCR-sequencing results.

Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) measure calculation

To measure LD level in the silkworm mt population, we
used the normalized measure of allelic association estimate D’ [15], which can not be easily influenced by rare
alleles examined [16]. We set the parameters in the software Haploview [17] as follows:
-maxdistance 200-dprime-minGeno 0.6minMAF 0.1-hwcutoff 0.001. Then spot chart was

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/81

plotted with R scripts which drew averaged D’ against
pairwise marker distance.
Phylogeny reconstruction

Five silkworm mt sequences (with accession number
AB070264, AY301620, NC_003395, NC_004622, and
NC_012727) were firstly aligned using MUSCLE v3.7
[18] with default settings, adjusting coordinates for the
three resequencing groups. From this, we got 46 mt
genomes, after integrating these five sequences and 41
consensus that we have, to perform phylogenetic reconstruction following MEGA v4 [19] by using NeighbourJoining method and Mrbayes v3.1.2 [20] under the Bayesian theory. In Mrbayes, we chose the GTR+gamma+I
model, and set the chain length to 50,000,000 (1 sample/1000 generations) and burned in the first 10,000
samples. Almost identical results were obtained in two
independent runs. The quality of being dependable of
the NJ trees was bootstrapped with 1000 replicate estimates. To evaluate the confidence level in the tree selection, we applied statistical tests with CONSEL [21]. The
site-wise likelihood file is derived from PhyML calculatation [22].
Tests of effective population size

First, using the SNP information of each group, we
inferred the mt sequence mismatch distributions for
domesticated group and Chinese wild group, where a
ragged distribution implies the stable population size,
and where a bell-shaped pattern is often related to
population growth [23,24]. Further, Tajima’s D and Fu
and Li’s D tests for population size were also performed
with DnaSP v5 [25].
Neutrality tests

It became clear to us that, during the domestication
process of the silkworm, 354 genes in the nuclear genome bear a strong human selection footprint [7]. The
mt genome may therefore also experience selective pressure. In order to examine mtDNA protein evolution, we
compare the rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous
mutation within and between species in each gene. If
these ratios differ significantly, they provide evidence of
selection pressure [26]. We then applied Williams’ correction to calculate the G statistic [27]. Moreover, we
also preformed the two likelihood ratio tests (LRTs),
based on widely used branch-site models from PAML
4.2 [28], to detect any positive selection.

Results
Determining mapping strategy and mapping summary

Before applying the strategy of mapping raw reads onto
different references, first round mapping was initiated,
which only took a single mt genome C108 as a reference

Page 4 of 10

to be mapped. After SNP calling, there was an obvious
separation among these three groups in phylogeny analysis (data not shown). This impressed us that we should
use different reference datasets based on silkworm classification as a reference for each group, so that we can
get more realistic genetic variation. Before we clearly
acknowledge the separation among these three populations, it is essential to perform these alignments. Here,
we just take the mt sequence into consideration; however, we must introduce the nuclear DNA sequence,
because there are some similar regions between the mt
sequence and nuclear genome. A sequencing read would
have more than one hit mapped to the whole genome
(the mt genome plus the nuclear genome), while it
would be with unique hits to the mt sequence when we
excluded the nuclear DNA sequence. The latter, exclusive mt genome situation would interrupt meaningful
SNP detection [14].
After aligning short reads onto the reference genome
by using the SOAP alignment program [13], we
obtained a 2319.56 fold effective depth for all the 41
varieties and each ranged from 8.99 to 165.42 fold. The
minimal depth 8.99 fold covering 93.71% of the mt genome (see Table 1) suggests that there was sufficient content to detect the variation. Though this fluctuation in
depth was apparent, we found there was no significant
difference [Mann Whitney U (MWU), P = 0.36] when
one takes the depth between domesticated silkworms
and wild ones into comparison.
Mitochondria diversity and the higher polymorphism
level in wild silkworm

We then used SOAPsnp package [14], which checks the
read quality and mapping positions to detect SNPs. Filtered by the criteria described in Method Section, we
identified 88 SNPs when taking 29 domesticated mt
sequences as a whole, 231 SNPs in Chinese wild population, and 46 SNPs in Japanese wild group (Table 2). We
totally identified 347 SNPs for our 41 samples in brief.
The randomly chosen subset of the SNPs was sequenced
with PCR, and we found they are all consistent with the
genotype calling. The polymorphism level (θ π ) of mt

sequence among Chinese wild population (6.20 × 10-3
nucleotide differences per site) is more than six times
that among domesticated varieties (1.14 × 10-3) (Table
2), the relative larger reduction in polymorphism is
most likely caused by inbreeding or population bottlenecking. Similar phenomenon was revealed in the
nuclear DNA analyses [7]. However, the Japanese wild
population, which only distributes in Japan and Korea
[3], has a moderate sequence diversity (2.02 × 10-3), suggesting that it has a small effective population size compared to Chinese wild silkworm. This conclusion must
be tempered somewhat by the low Japanese sample
number.

It is a point of frequent contention whether the mt genome undergoes recombination or not [29]. We used D’,

shown to be less sensitive to the effects of the allele frequency variation [30] than others measures, to assess
the linkage disequilibrium (LD) rates in the domesticated silkworm and Chinese wild silkworm varieties, and
to check whether silkworm mt genome has experienced
recombination. No marker in the domesticated group
passed all the thresholds set by Haploview, but 146 out
of 231 markers have passed all criteria in the Chinese
wild group, which could be applied to analyze the allelic
association. Of the 10,585 pairs of the 146 polymorphic
sites, 8,301 showed the maximum LD rate (|D’| = 1)
(Figure 1). High proportion (78.4%) result suggested no
evidence for the recombination in the silkworm mt
genome.
Furthermore, there was also no correlation between
genome distance and |D’|, and distribution of site pairs
with |D’| < 1 were randomly distributed with physical

distance (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r = 5.31 ×
10-3; P = 0.80). Although this is the first investigation
for silkworm mitochondria recombination, there seems
to be only limited occurrence, making it unnecessary to
consider its effect on population structure or evolution.
Phylogenetic analysis

To quantify population structure, we used all the SNPs
identified, and all the specific sites among groups, to
reconstruct an accurate illustration of population history, which could distinguish the ancestor from which
the domesticated silkworm was most recently bifurcated.
Both Bayesian and Neighbour-joining methods were
used to confirm the topology accuracy of the estimated
phylogenetic tree, and similar results were obtained
using different approaches. So, we only show here the
Bayesian tree in Figure 2A and Figure 2B. Although
some efforts have been made to elucidate the phylogeny
of silkworms based on mtDNA sequence [5,6], here, it is
also essential to perform a genome-wide analysis which
includes more individual sequences, and which would
get more comprehensive picture of silkworm clade.
Using the mt genome sequences of Antheraea pernyi
and Eriogyna pyretorum as the outgroup, we can see
clearly and conclusively that the domesticated silkworm
is closer to the Chinese wild silkworm than to the Japanese wild silkworm. Also, the high bootstrap values in
topology provide compelling evidence that domesticated
silkworm mtDNA was more recently bifurcated from
the Chinese wild group, rather than from the Japanese
wild group.
To evaluate the level of confidence in tree selection,
we test whether alternative placements of Japanese wild
silkworm among the Bombycidae could be accepted on
basis of the approximately unbiased (AU) test and the
weighted Shimodaira-Hasegawa (WSH) test [31]. With
our dataset, they reject all the alternative scenarios
(P < 1 × 10-6). As mentioned in the Method section, the
reference of the domesticated and Chinese wild group is
from C108 and Ankang, respectively, but another individual from these two lines did not cluster together with
its references (Figure 2A and Figure 2B). This result
suggests the intraspecific mtDNA sequence diversity
would be higher than the interspecific diversity.
Stable population size in domesticated and Chinese wild
population

Previous studies have deduced that the domesticated
silkworm effective population maintained a stable size
posterior to the domestication event [7]. The frequency
distribution of pairwise differences for domesticated and
Chinese wild group all showed ragged pattern (Figure
3), indicating their effective population sizes remain
constant [23,32]. Based on the number of segregating

Page 6 of 10

sites and the nucleotide diversity, we further performed
Tajima’s D [33] and Fu and Li’s D [34] tests. They both
show no indication of population expansion or contraction in the two groups (Tajima’s Dwild = -0.41308, P >
0.10; Fu and Li’s D wild = -0.33548, P > 0.10; Tajima’s
Ddomesticated = -1.65367, P > 0.05; Fu and Li’s Ddomesticated = -2.19707, P > 0.05).
Positive selection detection

There is no recombination event in the Chinese wild silkworm mitochondria, and the population size of domesticated silkworm and Chinese wild silkworms both remain
stable. So it is reasonable to infer selection forces shaping
mtDNA by using McDonald-Kreitman test for each gene.
The result showed the cytochrome b (cytb) gene had a
significant (P = 1.8 × 10 -3 ) deviation from neutrality
(Table 3), indicating it has been effected by positive selection posterior to silkworm domestication [26].
We also looked for positive selection using branch-site
likelihood ratio tests for this gene, showing significant
difference (P = 0.014) between the foreground and background. These two kinds of independent tests both
show statistical power in this scenario, so we can believe
the cytb gene is important to the domesticated silkworm, which will be elucidated in the discussion.

Discussion
The silkworm is the best-characterized model for biochemical, genetic, and genomic studies of the order
Lepidoptera, and for insect domestication. Here we
report a full-scale genome-wide mitochondrial map,
which includes all the major silkworm classes in Bombycidae, and unveils - at a single base-pair resolution - the
distinction between the two wild silkworm subgroups.
This map will provide a valuable resource for further
study on silkworm mitochondria evolution, and will
accelerate the research of functional identification
among silkworm genes.
We estimated θπ values for SNPs in mitochondria and
found they were 1.14 × 10-3 and 6.20 × 10-3 in B. mori
and B. mandarina, respectively, and we also know that
θπ values in the nuclear genome were 1.36 × 10 -2 and
1.53 × 10-2 in B. mori and B. mandarina, respectively
[7]. The relatively larger polymorphism level increase in
nuclear genome is mainly due to the background transposable element content [35] and rapid decay of LD [7].
The pattern in humans, whose mutation rate is 2.8 ×
10-3 [36] and 0.8 × 10-3 [37] in our mt and nuclear genomes, respectively, provides an interesting contrast to
that of the silkworm. But compared to Drosophila simulans, we found a similar phenomenon of a nuclear genome mutation rate (1.8 × 10-2) [38] being higher than
the mitochondrial rate (1.1 × 10-3 ) [8]. This indicated
that the insect nuclear genome could tolerate more

We also reconstructed a Neighbour-joining tree in Mega, using the same consensus sequence. The support values (with 1000 bootstrap
replicates) are listed following the posterior probabilities. Except for the outgroup Antheraea pernyi and Eriogyna pyretorum, as well as the
domesticated group, each sample is represented by a combination of symbols representing respective silkworm groups (filled circles for Chinese
wild group and boxes for Japanese wild group), sample names and sample IDs (“W01” to “W12”, “WildAnKang-ref” for the reference genome of
Chinese wild group, “WildJapan-ref “ for the reference genome of Japanese wild group). The detailed information for samples could be found in
Table 1. (B) More fine scale phylogeny for the domesticated silkworm using Mrbayes. For the tree has a very short branch length, only topology
was shown in this picture. The posterior probabilities are listed at each node. Each sample is represented by sample names and sample IDs
(“D01” to “D29”, “C108-ref” for the reference genome of domesticated group).

alteration, and the differential of effective population
size between nuclear genome and mt genome would be
more distinct in the insect. Although the diversity of
mitochondria was smaller than that of the nuclear, the
difference between the domesticated silkworms and the
wild silkworms was apparent, which suggested they had
exclusive genetic background, and local inbreeding had
produced more effect on the domesticated population.
In recent years, scientists have only used limited samples or partial genome datasets to infer the phylogenic
relationship amongst silkworm clades. The main features
of these analyses have been on the basis of incomplete
genetic information. Although it is possible for them to
reach the conclusion that the true ancestor of the domesticated silkworm is the Chinese wild group, representatives of several basal lineages remain missing. Here,
taking advantage of 46 complete mt genomes, we can
confidently verify the consensus phylogeny of Arunkumar et al and Pan et al that B. mori was domesticated
from the Chinese B. mandarina. Both the AU test and
WSH test also provided further support on this argument. We also endeavored to study the major genetic
characteristics left by silkworm domestication process,
such as the different level of polymorphisms within each
group, and the selection force shaping on the mt genome.
In the mitochondrion of eukaryotes and in aerobic prokaryotes, the cytb protein is a component of respiratory
chain complex III, and is related to electron transfer.
Mutation in the site 318 of human cytb gene causes
severe deficiency in the respiratory chain enzyme involving in patient exercise intolerance [39]. In silkworms,
previous studies also showed that nine midgut-enriched
genes related to energy metabolism under selection play
a critical role in food digestion and nutrient absorption
[7]. The identification of cytb gene indicates that mt
genes probably contribute equally to energy metabolism
process, and is important to the domesticated silkworm.
This is the first time we sort out a gene under positive
selection in silkworm mtDNA, and it may provide a new
insight into the silkworm mtDNA evolution process.
The constant population size inference for B. mori and
B. mandarina in China indicated that the Chinese wild

silkworm led diverse and distinct lifestyles in the wild
mulberry, and the domesticated silkworm retained and
conserved their abundant interspecific polymorphism.
These results would pave the way for breeding strategies
later.
B. mori is not only well adapted to human handling,
but is wholly dependent on humans for survival, in addition to being well differentiated trait-wise from its wild
cousin. This makes silkworm domestication a distinctive
event in agricultural history, deserving the same attention as domestication of livestock and crop plants; especially as it took place in a different geographical region
(Asia vs. the Fertile Crescent) [40], and in a distinctly
different culture from the earliest known, and better studied domestication events.

Conclusions
Based on whole genome comparative analysis, with
41 silkworm mitochondrion and 5 other available mt
genome sequences, we identified 347 SNPs in the silkworm mt genome. Using this data, we infer that the
silkworm mt genome did not undergo recombination,
and find it very strongly implied that the Chinese
B. mandarina is the most recent ancestor of domesticated B. mori, in confirmation of the conclusions of
Arunkumar et al and Pan et al. It is found that, after
silkworm domestication and group divergence, the
effective population sizes in both groups remained
constant, and that identifiable genes underwent powerful selection pressures in B. mori.
These comprehensive overviews will provide new
insight into the evolution of the silkworm. It is believed
that the silkworm domestication event is of comparative
significance equal to the concurrent domestication
events of crop plants and animal livestock, during the
same time period of human history.
