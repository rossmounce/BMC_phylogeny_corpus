Abstract
Background: Sexual reproduction is a core biological function that is conserved throughout
eukaryotic evolution, yet breeding systems are extremely variable. Genome-wide comparative
studies can be effectively used to identify genes and regulatory patterns that are constrained to
preserve core functions from those that may help to account for the diversity of animal
reproductive strategies. We use a custom microarray to investigate gene expression in males and
two reproductive stages of females in the crustacean Daphnia pulex. Most Daphnia species
reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis, alternating between sexual and clonal reproduction. Both
sex determination and the switch in their mode of reproduction is environmentally induced, making
Daphnia an interesting comparative system for the study of sex-biased and reproductive genes.
Results: Patterns of gene expression in females and males reveal that 50% of assayed transcripts
show some degree of sex-bias. Female-biased transcription is enriched for translation, metabolic
and regulatory genes associated with development. Male-biased expression is enriched for cuticle
and protease function. Comparison with well studied arthropods such as Drosophila melanogaster
and Anopheles gambiae suggests that female-biased patterns tend to be conserved, whereas malebiased genes are evolving faster in D. pulex. These findings are based on the proportion of femalebiased, male-biased, and unbiased genes that share sequence similarity with proteins in other animal
genomes.
Conclusion: Some transcriptional differences between males and females appear to be conserved
across Arthropoda, including the rapid evolution of male-biased genes which is observed in insects
and now in a crustacean. Yet, novel patterns of male-biased gene expression are also uncovered.
This study is an important first step towards a detailed understanding of the genetic basis and
evolution of parthenogenesis, environmental sex determination, and adaptation to aquatic
environments.

Background
Differences between males and females have fascinated
biologists and stimulated research for many years, yet
detailed molecular explorations of sexually dimorphic

phenotypes are available for only a few organisms (cf. [15]). Among the insects, sex-biased gene expression is particularly well studied in Drosophila [6-13]. This research
reveals that a large proportion of the transcriptome is sexPage 1 of 14

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:464

biased [2,10,12], and that most of these differences can be
ascribed to divergence in the germ line [6,11]. Furthermore, sex is a much stronger determinant of transcript levels than an animal's ontogeny [7], age, or genotype [10].
These studies also find that, overall, male-biased genes are
evolving more rapidly than female-biased genes
[9,13,14], providing evidence that males experience
stronger positive selection than females [8,12]. In addition, male genes are under-represented on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster [15]. To date, the generality of
these findings for arthropods is not clear. Recent studies of
Anopheles gambiae [3,16] report that a large proportion of
gene expression is sex-biased and shows similar functional patterns to the female-biased gene set in flies. For
example, females of both insects tend to express genes
involved in ribosome function, translation initiation, and
DNA replication at a higher level than males [16]. However, genes expressed at a two-fold or greater difference in
Drosophila tend to be male-biased [11]. In contrast, 71%
of highly biased genes are enriched in Anopheles females
[16]. Further comparative experimental work is required
to better understand the evolution of sex-biased gene
expression.
Genome sequencing projects serve to underscore both the
unity of eukaryotic organization as well as its amazing
diversity. Functional characterization of genomes demonstrates that significant portions of gene inventories are
preserved, which accounts for many of the core biological
attributes defining large classes of organisms. In practice,
comparative data from closely related species are a useful
resource to ascribe tentative functions to conserved
genomic elements, as studies of insects have begun to
demonstrate [17,18]. Yet, investigations that include species from the other major lineages of arthropods (chelicerates and crustaceans) are equally important to discern
insect-specific and arthropod-specific differences, and to
infer ancestral versus derived conditions. Crustaceans are
an amazingly varied group encompassing over 38,000
known species [19], and constitute a significant portion of
animal communities in aquatic environments. Amongst
crustaceans, the "water flea" Daphnia is arguably the best
studied and has traditionally been an important model
for ecology, population genetics, evolutionary biology,
and toxicology [20]. Although these studies have focused
on a variety of aspects of Daphnia biology, including phylogeography, functional morphology, physiology and life
history evolution, genomic investigations have begun
only recently [21]. A few large-scale studies of gene expression patterns in Daphnia have been published [22,23], but
molecular studies have mostly been confined to a limited
number of allozymes, sequence-tagged sites (STS), or
genes [24,25]. Interest in crustacean biology per se, as well
as their phylogenetic position as an outgroup to other well

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/464

studied arthropods (Drosophila, Apis, Anopheles), emphasize the relevance of Daphnia in comparative genomic
studies.
Several features of Daphnia biology make them an interesting subject of investigation in comparative functional
genomics. Females typically reproduce by apomixis (parthenogenesis), depositing multiple embryos into a dorsal
brood pouch that develop and hatch within about 48
hours [26]. Adverse environmental conditions such as
crowding, lowered temperature or food scarcity can
induce either male production (males are genetic copies
of their mothers), or haploid gametes that are fertilized
and overwinter in a state of diapause. Male production is
known to be under the control of endocrine factors during
oocyte maturation, and can be induced by juvenile hormone analogs such as the insecticides pyriproxyfen and
fenoxycarb [27]. The ability to produce either males or
haploid (sexual) eggs has been lost independently in multiple lineages of Daphnia, suggesting a simple genetic
mechanism. In D. pulex, current data support the existence
of a dominant allele conferring obligate asexuality in
females but not in males [28], which has been spreading
into North America from the northeast to the midwest
[29]. As a step towards understanding these processes at a
molecular level, here we specifically address the question
of conservation of gene expression patterns and protein
evolution in sex-biased genes.
We report here on gene expression profiles of D. pulex, an
emerging model for functional genomics, by measuring
transcription levels in males and females at two stages of
development using a custom cDNA microarray. We compare the gene expression profiles of D. melanogaster to
those of D. pulex to discover conserved elements of sexspecific transcriptional regulation. Analysis of the patterns
associated with sex-bias also reveals a conserved trend in
male-biased genes to be evolving faster than femalebiased.

Results
Profiling sex- and parthenogenesis- biased gene expression
Our study represents the first description of global patterns of sex-biased transcription in a crustacean species,
and we analyzed our results using two major approaches.
First, we compared our male and female profiles to each
other and to published studies of other arthropods using
annotated gene ontology functions and processes. Secondly, we used an evolutionary approach to assess patterns of sequence conservation and sex bias. Furthermore
we tested mature females carrying their first brood as well
as juvenile females, whose ovaries are beginning the
reproductive cycle, in order to examine embryogenesis as
well as oogenesis.

Examining patterns of gene expression in females (either
juvenile or mature) compared to males reveals that the
majority of array elements show some degree of sexbiased gene expression (Fig. 1). We tested mature females
carrying their first brood as well as juvenile females,
whose ovaries are beginning the reproductive cycle, to
examine embryogenesis as well as oogenesis. Analysis of
microarray data indicated that the arrays and the hybridizations are of high quality, characterized by excellent
reproducibility between experiments, good dynamic
range and low noise. After normalization, the intraslide
correlation between duplicate spots was greater than 0.99,
and the interslide correlation was greater than 0.94. The
coefficient of variation (CV) for spots combined across
arrays ranged from 0.003–0.50, with a mean (± S.D.) of
0.04 ± 0.047 (n = 3,673), indicating a negligible effect of
spot intensity on variation. The high reproducibility of the
experiments allowed the detection of statistically significant differences of approximately 1.25-fold (Fig. 1, Additional file 1).
We used the number of array elements and assembled
sequences, fully described in reference [30], to estimate
the number of unique genes differentially expressed in
each comparison (Table 1). When data from the male-

mature female and male-juvenile female experiments
were pooled, a total of 81% (1,270) of genes shows statistically significant sex-biased gene expression with an estimated false discovery rate of 5% (Table 1). With a more
conservative threshold of both at least a two-fold difference and statistical significance, a total of 45% (698) of
genes, corresponding to 1,355 array elements, showed
sex-biased gene expression (Table 1). This overall pattern
is consistent with previous studies of other arthropods
[2,3,12]. Additionally, there were almost three times as
many male enriched genes compared to female enriched
genes (957 versus 313, Table 1). However, at a two-fold or
greater expression difference the proportion of malebiased transcription declined substantially (431 male
biased and 267 female biased).
In addition, we used real-time reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) to validate the microarray results for five
selected genes, and found concordance for the direction of
differential expression in each case, including a non-differentially expressed transcript (Fig. 2). For example, for
our element 01031D01, expression levels measured by
microarray were 85 for males, 45 for juvenile females, and
65 for pregnant females (relative fluorescence intensity).
When measured by RT-PCR, this gene was expressed at 54,
10, and 18 relative fluorescence units for males, juvenile
females, and pregnant females, respectively. Our results
thus show a compression of ratios in microarray results
compared to RT-PCR, similar to other published comparisons [31,32].
A closer examination revealed important differences
between the patterns of sex-biased gene expression in
juvenile and mature females. At the gross level, both
males and mature females displayed a paucity of highly
differentially expressed genes relative to juvenile females.
Mature females expressed 21% of genes and juvenile
females expressed 23% of genes at a two-fold or lower
level relative to males (Table 1). By comparison, at a twofold or higher level, males expressed 15% of genes more
highly than mature females but only 0.6% of genes more
highly than juvenile females. It is important to note that
the arrayed cDNA libraries were made from mixed cultures comprised predominantly of females, and consequently are expected to under-represent male-specific and
strongly male-biased genes. As males are a common reference, this indicates that a significant number of genes
were also differentially expressed in juvenile females relative to mature females.
To verify, we used a linear model to quantitatively analyze
differences between pregnant and juvenile females. The
method implemented in limma [33] creates normalized
intensity values for each target, which allowed comparisons to be made between groups, even when they were

not directly compared. In effect, males served as a reference in this analysis. Using this approach, and by comparing male replicates to each other as a control, we
identified genes differentially expressed between juvenile
and pregnant females (Fig. 3A). As expected, the malemale comparison showed only two differentially
expressed elements (Fig. 3B), while there were 604 differentially expressed genes between females, with 363 more
highly expressed in mature females and 241 more highly
expressed in juvenile females. At a two-fold difference
threshold, mature females exhibited a substantially lower
proportion (1.2%, 19 genes) compared to juveniles (12%,
190 genes, Table 1).
To examine the distribution of differentially expressed
genes in the two comparisons of males and females, we
compared transcripts differing by two-fold or greater
between males and juveniles on the Y-axis and males and
mature females on the X-axis of a scatterplot (Fig. 4). In
this plot, negative ratios are female-enriched and positive
ratios are male-enriched, so the lower left quadrant contains female-enriched and the upper right male-enriched
genes. There are three important points illustrated by Figure 4. First, it is clear how few genes are relatively depleted
in juvenile females, especially those enriched in males.
This is illustrated by the small number of blue diamonds
above the X-axis compared to below. Second, differences
between juvenile and mature females, which are depicted
as black triangles above and below the line of unity (Fig.
4), are quite substantial but also asymmetric. Juvenileenriched genes are predominantly in the quadrants to the
right of the Y-axis and are much more numerous than

mature-enriched transcripts (Table1). Third, differences
between mature females and males display a more even
distribution, as shown by the clusters of red squares in Figure 4. There are more genes that are highly femaleenriched, consistent with a smaller number of male-specific or highly male enriched transcripts present in the
arrayed cDNA libraries.
Functional categories of differentially expressed genes
The role of homology in inferring putative function for
unknown gene sequences is well established and is the
basis for annotation using a structured vocabulary such as
the popular gene ontology, or GO [34,35]. One reason for
this popularity is the ability to statistically test associations between GO annotations and gene expression measurements, although unfortunately no ontological or
methodological approach can be considered optimal [3638]. To investigate whether differentially expressed genes
have a non-random representation of functional categories with respect to each other, we analyzed the occurrences of GO terms in each of the classes of differentially
expressed genes (using assembled sequences only, so
redundant sequences were not counted twice). We
extracted the GO terms of the best Blast match in the
GenBank NR database, and analyzed the relative frequency of differentially expressed genes to the reference
set of all data using Fisher's exact test implemented in
Blast2GO [39].

Female-biased genes are significantly enriched for a variety of GO categories involving protein metabolism, especially synthetic pathways relating to ribosome function

and translation elongation (Fig. 5A). Other enriched categories identified macromolecule metabolism and primary
metabolism, including both anabolic and catabolic functions. Organelle function and synthesis are also represented by multiple categories (Fig. 5A). Male-enriched D.
pulex genes on our array correspond to 30 over-represented GO categories, compared to 38 for females (Fig
5B). Male-enriched GO terms generally related to either
cuticle metabolism or serine peptidases, which are
thought to have roles in cellular signalling and defence as
well as digestion. Cuticle metabolism includes functional
categories such as carbohydrate binding, polysaccharide
metabolism, and structural constituent of cuticle functions (Fig. 5B).
Analysis of GO term enrichment in juvenile compared to
mature females reveals differences that can be ascribed to
embryogenesis. Specifically, while juvenile females show
a paucity of categories enriched vs. mature females,
mature females are enriched for a number of GO terms
(5C, 5D). Over-represented GO terms in juvenile females
include lytic vacuole, lysosome, vacuole, structural mole-

cule activity, carbohydrate metabolism, and structural
constituent of cuticle (Fig. 5C). Both males and juvenile
females, which are approximately half the size of mature
females, are significantly enriched for exoskeletal-associated gene function. This enrichment may be a simple consequence of larger surface area/volume ratios, which
presumably require a higher concentration of cuticular
proteins per unit mass. For mature females, enriched GO
categories include those related to DNA packaging as well
as transcription (Fig. 5D). Other GO terms are associated
with amino acid metabolism and organelle function. In
addition, various types of regulation are associated with
mature females, including regulation of nucleic acid
metabolism, primary metabolism, transcription, and
physiological process.
GO term comparisons between males and mature females
further illustrate important differences related to embryogenesis. Juvenile-enriched categories represent a subset of
the female-enriched vs. male comparison (not shown). In
contrast, mature-enriched GO terms include some categories not seen in other comparisons (Fig. 5E). For instance,
many terms associated with purine nucleotide functions
are overrepresented, such as GTPase activity and purine
binding. Another set of terms involves microtubule func-

tion, such as microtubule binding and polymerization,
and to transcriptional regulation (Fig. 5E).
Conservation of sex-biased gene expression
At the transcriptome level, many genes show conserved
patterns of expression, which can be useful for inferring
gene function [40,41]. For example, many genes show
sex-biased patterns of expression conserved between D.
melanogaster and A. gambiae [16]. We are interested in how
sex-specific gene expression patterns in D. pulex compare
to the arthropod D. melanogaster. Using an expectation
value (e-value) threshold of 1 × 10-08 in a Blast search of
our D. pulex sequences against the D. melanogaster translations (release 4.1), we retrieved 315 identifiable
homologs. From this list, we found 150 genes significantly differentially expressed in our experiments, and
with comparable male-female expression data in D. melanogaster: those of Arbeitman et al. [2], Parisi et al. [11], and
Ranz et al. [12]. These genes display e-values with a normal distribution, and a large percentage had very strong
homology. When ratio values for the D. pulex female/male
comparison are plotted against the ratios for D. melanogaster (Fig. 6), several trends are apparent. Of the 150
comparisons, there are 40 differences in sign, or 73%
agreement in the direction of differential expression. Lin-

Recent studies have found that the evolution of protein
coding sequence is correlated with gene expression patterns [40,42,43]. A striking example is found in the rapid
evolution of male-biased genes in D. melanogaster
[12,13,42]. We asked whether D. pulex genes with femaleor male-biased gene expression are more or less likely to
be conserved than non-sex biased genes. We used a tblastx
search of the GenBank NR database to assign genes into 3
categories: strong homologs (bit score > 100), weak
homologs (bit score of 50–100) or no homology (bit
score < 50). We further binned these genes according to
their expression pattern as female-biased, male-biased,
and unbiased (Fig. 7). Among these sequences, 112
female-biased genes have strong homologs compared to
89 in males. In contrast, there are 210 male-biased genes
with no blast homolog but only 52 in females. Furthermore, a far greater proportion of female-biased genes have
strong homologs than male-biased genes (60% vs. 23%),
while a greater proportion of genes with no identifiable
homolog are male-biased than female-biased (53% vs.
28%). These data indicate a greater degree of conservation
of female-biased compared to male-biased genes in our
set of D. pulex sequences.
Rapid evolution of male-biased genes may be due to
either relaxation of selective pressure, or to increased positive selection favoring sequence divergence. One prediction of the former hypothesis is increased codon usage
bias in slowly evolving genes [44], which could cause a
spurious correlation between transcription and rate of
evolution. To test this idea, we used correspondence analysis [45] to analyze codon usage statistics for male-biased,
female-biased, and unbiased genes, using a conservative
cutoff of four-fold difference for biased genes. We found
no difference in codon usage bias between these classes as
measured by frequency of optimal codons (Fop), codon
bias index (CBI), codon adaptation index (CAI), or relative synonymous codon usage either at a four-fold cutoff,
or at a more relaxed two-fold cutoff (data not shown).
Additionally, correlations between third position GC content and Fop (r2 = 0.47; p < 0.05) or CBI (r2 = 0.56; p <
0.01) indicate GC content is likely to be causing major

trends in codon usage among these genes [46]. These
observations show that for the genes in our data set, selection on codon usage is not a cause of the relationship
between protein evolution and expression bias.

Discussion
Gene expression analysis of males and females
Sexual reproduction is a core biological function and
recent genome-wide studies of sexual dimorphism and
gametogenesis in model metazoans have revealed several
recurring patterns. (i) A very large proportion of the transcriptome shows some level of sex-biased gene expression
[4,5,11]. (ii) The most profound sex-biased gene expression is found in the germ line [1,4,6,11]. (iii) Sex-biased
genes are non-randomly distributed among sex-chromosomes and autosomes [15,47]. (iv) Male-biased genes
show accelerated patterns of evolution [9,13]. Two features of D. pulex make it particularly interesting for a comparative study of sex-biased and reproductive genes. First,
D. pulex are cyclically parthenogenetic, alternating sexual

and asexual rounds of reproduction. Second, sex determination is environmentally induced, as males are genetically identical to their mothers (sexual reproduction
results in female offspring). Thus in D. pulex, we expect to
find the patterns of sex-biased gene expression common
to the arthropods overlaid with changes associated with
parthenogenetic oogenesis and environmental sex determination.
As a first step in understanding the genetic basis of the D.
pulex reproductive system, we profiled the expression of
genes differentially expressed in males compared to parthenogenetically reproducing females. Daphnia oogenesis
proceeds with a clutch of oocytes undergoing development in the ovaries, while embryos develop in the brood
chamber [26]. Shortly after molting, which releases young
from the brood chamber, newly vitellogenic eggs from the
ovary are deposited into the brood chamber. In the intervening intermolt period, embryonic development and
vitellogenesis proceed in the brood chamber and ovary,

bution from embryos. Of the functional annotations of
embryo-associated genes, the most prominent are related
to DNA metabolism and transcription, and to microtubule function. It is interesting that in other arthropod
male-female comparisons, microtubule function is maleenriched, presumably due to spermatic function [11]. It is
not clear why Daphnia embryos are so highly enriched for
this ubiquitous protein. Future studies of gene expression
across the life cycle of D. pulex should shed light on specific embryonic genes and pathways, and provide useful
insights into comparative developmental genomics of
arthropods.

pulex genes show significant differential expression between
males and females. Numbers of genes with significant homology include 27 from e-08 to e-10; 21 from e-11 to e-20; 54 from

respectively. Thus, females reproducing parthenogenetically contain both developing egg chambers as well as
developing embryos. In contrast, juvenile females generally contain pre-vitellogenic oocytes but no embryos [26].
Therefore, we compared males to both juvenile females
and females carrying embryos in order to partition the
embryonic component from the two female types, while
simultaneously ensuring a comparison with reproductively capable females.
Males used in these experiments were treated identically
and showed no systematic differences in the two experiments, so the low level of two-fold differential expression
in the male-juvenile female comparisons must reflect a
higher level of transcript present in juvenile vs. mature
females. The paucity of highly differentially expressed
genes in males vs. juvenile females is likely due in part to
having few male-specific transcripts on the arrays. Gene
expression due to oogenesis, occurring in both juvenile
and mature females, and embryogenesis, which occurs
only in mature females, also shows an important contri-

Patterns of sequence conservation and sex-biased gene
expression in D. pulex are broadly similar to those seen in
comparable studies of Anopheles gambiae and D. melanogaster. In particular, we found a high proportion
(roughly 50%) of sex-biased expression among genes on
our array, similar to other reports [3,7,12,16], with large
numbers of both male- and female-biased genes. It is
interesting that, in spite of potential bias toward discovering female-enriched genes on our arrays due to the nature
of the arrayed cDNA library, we found a large number of
genes to be male-biased. Functional categories overrepresented in males were associated with cuticle metabolism
and protease function, which contrasts to the situation
seen in adult mosquitoes [16]. We speculate that
increased cuticle metabolism in males and juvenile
females is a result of allometry (mature females being
roughly double the size), although we cannot rule out the
possibility of differences in cuticular composition or
structure. Higher expression of proteases in males also differs from A. gambiae, in which female transcripts were
enriched for genes associated with blood feeding, such as
salivary gland proteins [16]. In mice, immune-related
gene expression is also lower in testes than ovaries,
although the reason for this difference is unknown [5].
Some proteases with higher expression in D. pulex males
are homologous to digestive enzymes, but there are also
clear examples of homologs of defence response proteins,
as well as non-proteolytic members of these signaling
pathways. It is not clear whether male Daphnia have a
greater need for protease activity for defence, immune signaling, or metabolism. Finally, although males have
higher mass-specific metabolism than females [48],
females rather than males are enriched for energy metabolism-annotated GO categories.
Some of the biological processes overrepresented in
female D. pulex are similar to those in other arthropods,
such as translation elongation, ribosomal function, and
DNA packaging. In comparing conserved sex-biased genes
in D. pulex and D. melanogaster, we found 31 male-biased,
86 female-biased and 32 genes with opposite bias. These
differences are on the same order as differences found in

Their results demonstrate an accelerated rate of evolution
for male-biased genes, and that these genes are more often
subject to positive selection [13]. It is clear that for genes
in our data set, selection on codon usage is not driving differences in evolutionary rates, nor is it causing a spurious
correlation between bias and rate. However, it is possible
that our data set was too small to detect codon usage differences.

comparing D. melanogaster to D. simulans [12], where 20%
of the genes studied had changed sex-biased expression
between species. In marked contrast, Hahn and Lanzaro
[16] found only 4 orthologs that had sex-biased expression in both Anopheles and Drosophila. Discrepancy
between this finding and our study probably reflects the
two-fold cutoff used in the Anopheles study [16], and difficulty in assigning orthologs to rapidly evolving malebiased genes. However, it is clear that proteins involved in
translation and DNA packaging are female-biased in
expression among flies, mosquitoes and Daphnia.
We found a difference in the degree of conservation
between female and male-biased genes, similar to studies
showing that female-biased genes tend to be better conserved than male-biased genes [9,14]. Data from population genetic studies indicate an increase in positive
selection on male biased genes, which also have a significantly lower level of codon bias than female-biased genes.
These findings were recently extended by Zhang and colleagues [13], who analyzed polymorphism levels for sexbiased and unbiased genes in several Drosophila species.

Future studies should focus on examining differences in
population polymorphism and species divergence, for
example in the nonsynonymous/synonymous polymorphism ratio in biased genes between populations of D.
pulex and D. magna, a congener for which cDNA data are
accumulating rapidly. This comparison would distinguish
between relaxed selective constraints or increased positive
selection on male genes. The ability to control for chromosomal effects makes a useful comparison to chromosomally-determined systems, in distinguishing whether
linkage or some other mechanism is responsible. Another
central question is whether male-biased genes are mutationally degenerating in non-male producing obligate
asexual lines, and we identify candidate genes for such
research. Finally, comparing parthenogenetic reproduction to sexual reproduction in this species should also
yield interesting candidates for molecular evolutionary
studies, and provide clues as to the mechanisms involved
in these processes. The public release of the assembled D.
pulex genome, combined with genetic mapping studies
[49], should provide insight into the roles of recombination rate, chromosomal context, demographic history,
and selection on shaping sequence divergence in sexbiased genes.

Conclusion
In this study, we analyze patterns of gene expression differences in D. pulex males, juvenile females, and pregnant
females. We find patterns of sex-specific and pregnancyspecific expression across a substantial proportion of
genes. Results suggest that patterns of female-biased
expression are similar to those reported for D. melanogaster and A. gambiae, indicating conserved functional
requirements across arthropods. Specifically, females
express transcripts relating to protein metabolism, primary metabolism, and organelle function at a higher level
than do males. Embryonic gene expression is enriched for
processes related to DNA metabolism, transcription, and
microtubule function. Male-biased transcription is overrepresented with cuticle and protease functions, in contrast to other arthropods. We also find that male-biased
genes are less likely to have identifiable homologs in
sequence databases, consistent with faster evolution of
male-biased genes.

Methods
Microarray Construction
We constructed the first D. pulex microarray. The arrays
were printed with 3,602 PCR amplified cDNA clone
inserts and 240 positive and negative controls, corresponding to 787 clusters of nuclear-derived genes as
described [30]. cDNA libraries were constructed as
described elsewhere [30]. The printed array elements were
from a mixture of anonymous clones and clones with single pass 5' EST sequence reads. Fabrication of microarrays
was conducted concurrently with EST sequencing, and we
have sequenced 1,546 high-quality clones on the array to
date. A detailed description of this platform has been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus at NCBI under
the accession number GPL4349, series GSE5908. Not all
of the arrayed clones were sequenced, and many genes
were represented by multiple clones. Therefore, we define
redundancy on the array as the proportion of unique
sequences among our clones. Given approximately 57%
redundancy among the sequenced clones [30], we estimate that the array contains 1,560 distinct D. pulex genes.
From each library, 384 samples were PCR amplified from
plasmid purified using the PerfectPrep kit (Eppendorf)
and sequenced using BigDye (ABI; v.2) on an ABI 3730
sequencer. These samples served as a random sample for
quality control in further analysis. Remaining samples
(3,168 in all) were PCR amplified from colony picks of
transformed bacterial cells. Template was generated by
growing colonies in 1.2 ml of 2× YT and 0.005% chloramphenicol in 96-deepwell plates for 24 hours at 37°C.
Reactions were run in 100 μl containing: 1× Taq buffer
(Eppendorf), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM primers (Fwd. 5'GTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTAG 3' and Rev. 5'AAACAGCTATGACCATGTTCAC 3'), 5 U Taq (Eppendorf), and 5 μl fresh bacterial growth or 2 μl purified plasmid. Quality of PCR amplifications was verified by gel
electrophoresis and number and size of bands was
recorded using Kodak's 1D imaging software (v.3.6). Concentration of samples was determined by 96-well microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices SpectraMax
190) and adjusted to 50–200 ng/μl for printing.

A Genemachines Omnigrid 100 was used to print the D.
pulex cDNA on GapsII aminosilane slides (Corning). The
cDNA was printed in 3× SSC and 1.5 M Betaine buffer and
deposited with Stealth Micro-Spotting Pins (Telechem) at
20°C and 65% humidity. The cDNA was fixed to the
microarray slides by baking at 85°C for 3 hours. Slides
were processed by agitating in 0.2 % SDS for 5 min. and
in HPLC-grade water, 5 min at 21°C., followed by 2 min.
in 95°C water, rinsing briefly in ice-cold 100% isopropanol, and centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min. Five types of
negative controls were printed, including printing buffer,
failed PCR reaction with template DNA but no primers,
ORFs from Arabidopsis and lambda phage, and bacterial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/464

PCR spikes (Ambion). Positive controls of D. pulex genes
were printed next to printing buffer to assure no carryover,
and included cytochrome c (subunits I, II, and III), cytochrome b, actin, and ferritin.
Animal Culturing and Experimental Design
Daphnia were reared in lake water at 20°C and a 10:14
light/dark cycle at a density of approximately 1 individual
per 5 ml. Animals were fed Scenedesmus algae at approximately 0.1 mg ml-1 each day. Twenty animals of a single
clone were exposed to 400 nM methyl farnesoate in methanol (60 μl L-1) to induce male production, while another
20 individuals were given a sham control of methanol and
produced female offspring. Progeny were raised under
conditions described above in eight beakers each for
males and females, with about 25 individuals per beaker
and inspected by microscopy to verify healthy appearance
and correct sex. After six days, beakers containing juvenile
females were sacrificed. After eight days, males and the
remaining females (now carrying embryos in their brood
pouches) were harvested as well. Total RNA was isolated
using Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen),
including a DNase treatment performed on-column.
Quality of total RNA preparations was assayed by spectrophotometry and electrophoresis through denaturing agarose gels.

Four biological replicates of juvenile females and adult
females were compared to eight biological replicates of
males. Two samples of each female replicate were labeled
with red and two with green dye, and no technical replicates were performed. Eight total hybridizations were
therefore performed.
Microarray Hybridization, Analysis, and Validation
Isolated total RNA (15 μg) was reverse-transcribed into
first-strand cDNA using the SuperScriptIII indirect labeling kit (Invitrogen), and coupled to Alexa dyes 555 and
647 (Invitrogen). Incorporation was assessed by spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis followed by image
quantitation on a Typhoon phosphorimager (Molecular
Dynamics). Results showed good incorporation of fluor,
a size range of cDNA into the 1 kb range, and negligible
amounts of unincorporated dye. Equal masses of cDNA
from males and females were combined in a 1:3 volume
with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1%
SDS, 10 μg calf thymus DNA) and denatured at 90°C for
4 min, quick chilled, and injected into a Lucidea Slidepro
automated hybridization chamber (Amersham) containing a microarray slide pre-hybridized according to manufacturer's instructions. Following overnight hybridization,
slides were washed twice at 60°C in 2× SSC + 0.2% SDS
(15 min), once in 0.2× SSC + 0.2% SDS (10 min), once in
0.1× SSC (10 min) and once in 0.05× SSC (10 min). Slides
were dipped briefly in 100% isopropanol, centrifuged 5

min at 500 × g to dry, and scanned using an Axon 4200B
scanner.
Data were extracted using GenePix software (version 5.1)
and imported into Bioconductor for normalization and
analysis [50]. Data were compared using multiple methods, including several Bioconductor packages. Data were
normalized using OLIN [51] or limma [33] and differential expression was assessed with limma and EBarrays
[52]. Array elements are defined as differentially expressed
in our analyses if they have a p-value less than 0.05 with a
false discovery rate correction using the program linear
models for microarrays (Limma) [33] implemented in
Bioconductor [50].
We compared analyses using OLIN for normalization and
EBarrays for differential expression, or using limma for
both. Briefly, we examined assumptions of the analytical
models using constant coefficient of variation and quartile-quartile plots, which showed reasonably good fits.
However, certain contrasts in EBarrays were not as well fit
as others for our experimental dataset, so we used the linear model framework. We performed normalizations
using print-tip loess normalization with no background
subtraction after genes < 2 S.D. above median background
were filtered out. Gene ontology category assignment and
analysis was performed using the program Blast2GO [39],
with input data consisting of assembled sequences called
as differentially expressed by Limma using a 5% false-discovery rate. Codon statistics were generated using correspondence analysis [46] as implemented in the program
codonW [45]. For these analyses, significantly differentially expressed genes were binned as biased if the malefemale difference in both juvenile and mature comparisons was greater than 4-fold (arithmetic scale).
For clarity, we describe gene expression patterns in terms
of (i) the number of array elements (to distinguish from
spots, which are printed in duplicate), (ii) the number of
sequenced, non-redundant genes (which we also call
"assembled" sequences) and (iii) the estimated number of
unique genes represented by those elements.
Quantitative PCR assays were performed with the SuperScript III Real-time PCR kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocol for 2-step amplification, using
BioRad's I-cycler. Briefly, DNase-treated total RNA (200
ng) was reverse transcribed in 20 μl and amplified in
duplicate samples from two separate RNA preparations.
Reactions consisted of 200 μM dNTPs, 3 μM gene-specific
primers, 1 μM fluorescein, and 2 U Taq. A standard curve
was constructed using cDNA as template, and reactions
were subjected to melt-curve analysis after amplification,
which revealed a single band in each case. Reaction products were also subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in
