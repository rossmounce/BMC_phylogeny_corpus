Abstract
Background: Rotavirus (RV), is a member of the Reoviridae family and an important etiological
agent of acute viral gastroenteritis in the young. Rotaviruses have a wide host range infecting a
broad range of animal species, however little is known about rotavirus infection in exotic animals.
In this paper we report the first characterisation of a RV strain from a giraffe calf.
Results: This report describes the identification and detailed molecular characterisation of a
rotavirus strain detected from a 14-day-old Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), presenting with acute
diarrhea. The RV strain detected from the giraffe was characterized molecularly as G10P[11].
Detailed sequence analysis of VP4 and VP7 revealed significant identity at the amino acid sequence
level to Bovine RV (BoRV).
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the need for continuous surveillance of RV strains in various
animal populations, which will facilitate the identification of rotavirus hosts not previously reported.
Furthermore, extending typical epidemiology studies to a broader host range will contribute to the
timely identification of new emerging strain types.

Background
Rotavirus (RV), a member of the Reoviridae family is one
of the major etiological agents of acute viral gastroenteritis
in the young of a large number of animal species including cattle, pigs, horses, rabbits, mice, dogs, cats, birds and
exotic animal species such as addax, saiga, white-tailed
gnu, grizzly bear, and red kangaroo [1,2]. In the develop-

ing world rotavirus infection in humans is associated with
approximately 600,000 deaths per annum in those under
5 years [3]. In contrast, in the developed world RV infection is responsible for a significant economic burden
being linked with 30–60% of diarrhea related hospitilisations reported [4].

RV particles are non-enveloped, icosahedral particles
approximately 70 nm in diameter. The RV genome is composed of 11 double stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments,
which code for 6 structural (VP1 through 4, 6 and 7) and
6 non-structural (NSP1 through NSP6) proteins. Seven
classified RV groups (A-G) are recognized, based on the
antigenic variability of their inner capsid protein, VP6.
VP4 and VP7 (the outer capsid proteins) possess epitopes
that elicit neutralizing antibody responses and in turn
determine RV serotypes. Estes [5] developed a dual classification system by defining VP7-specific serotypes, termed
G-types (glycoprotein) and VP4 specific serotypes termed
P-types (protease sensitive protein). Genotypic classification of all RV strains is now based on this system. Based
on the comparative analysis of these genes, currently there
are 15 VP7 genotypes (G-types 1 through 15) and 27 VP4
genotypes (P-types [1-27]) recognized among human and
animal group A rotavirus. To date, six P-types (P6[1],
P7[5], P8[11], P11[14], P[17] and P[21]) and 8 G-types
(G1, G3, G5, G6, G7, G8, G10 and G15) have been
reported among bovine RV-group A [6-15].
Rotaviruses are intestinal pathogens that are transmitted
by the faecal-oral route. In bovine animals, onset of disease is rapid and the clinical signs include depression,
anorexia, diarrhea and dehydration. Large numbers of
viral particles are excreted in the feces of infected animals
over a period of 2 to 10 days. In temperate climates, disease is more prevalent during cooler months. In human
and bovine populations, rotavirus transmission is most
frequent during the winter and early spring months [16].
In previous studies it has been suggested that RV exist as
mixed populations of reassortants, and this reassortment
is responsible for the diversity observed between rotavirus
strains. Animal RVs are often regarded as a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human RV, due to the segmented genome structures. Co-surveillance of both
animal and human RV strains is essential to gain a better
understanding of the epidemiology of strains in circulation and to facilitate the timely identification of new
emerging variants [17].
In this study, we report on the characterisation of a RV
strain detected from a giraffe admitted to the University
Veterinary Hospital with acute diarrhea. Sequence analysis revealed a significant homology to bovine RV.

Methods
Clinical and pathological assessment
An orphaned Rothschild giraffe from Dublin Zoological
Gardens was presented to the University Veterinary Hospital at 14 days of age with a history failure of passive
transfer of immunity, anorexia, dehydration, hypoglycemia, acidosis and persistent profuse watery diarrhea. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/4/46

animal was treated on admission with intravenous fluid
therapy, antimicrobials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The giraffe calf died 4 days post-treatment. A
post-mortem examination primarily revealed a severe
abomasitis and enteritis. No significant pathogenic organisms were isolated on bacteriological culture of the spleen,
rumen or abomasum presumably as a consequence of
intensive antimicrobial therapy. A faecal specimen was
sent to our laboratory for further investigation.
Preliminary testing of the faecal specimen obtained (by
Transmission Electron Microscopy) revealed the specimen
to be positive for RV infection. Husbandry issues were
considered to assess the potential route of RV infection.
Interestingly, the calf had not been in contact with any
other ruminants' prior to admission to the University Veterinary Hospital. However indirect contact with other animals could not be out ruled. Other issues for
consideration were the movements of the keepers
between different animal enclosures, the feeding equipment used and the apparatus used to clean the housing
areas.
Transmission electron microscopy (T-EM)
Transmission electron micrographs captured the appearance of negatively stained RV observed in the giraffe faecal
sample. Faecal samples were prepared by mixing with 2%
(w/v) methylamine tungstate negative stain on a 3.05 mm
grid and allowed to stand at room temperature for 4 min.
The specimen was examined using electron-optical magnification up to × 40, 000 range.
Extraction of viral dsRNA
A faecal specimen from the 14-day old giraffe was sent to
our laboratory for analysis. Initially this sample was
diluted in phosphate buffered saline solution (1× PBS).
Rotavirus dsRNA was purified from the faecal specimen
using a standard phenol/chloroform protocol with ethanol precipitation [18]. Briefly, 320 μl of the faecal suspension above was combined with 40 μl 10% (w/v) SDS and
40 μl 10% (w/v) proteinase K and incubated for 90 min at
37°C. The suspension was extracted once with phenol/
chloroform (5:1) followed by one extraction in chloroform alone. RNA in the aqueous phase was removed to a
clean eppendorf tube and precipitated with two volumes
of ethanol and then stored at -20°C overnight. Purified
dsRNA was recovered by centrifugation (1, 000 × g for 30
min) and the pellet containing the viral nucleic acid was
suspended in 100 μl diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)
treated water. Purified dsRNA was stored at -80°C until
required.
SDS-PAGE
dsRNA segments were separated by electrophoresis in 8%
(w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels, 1.5 mm thick with a 7.3

cm path length. Electrophoresis was performed using a
discontinuous buffer system based on a modification previously described by Laemmli for 80 min at a constant
voltage of 110 V [19].
The presence of viral dsRNA in the faecal sample was confirmed following staining with a DNA Silver Staining Kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham
Biosciences, UK).
Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
A one-step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed. Purified viral genomic
dsRNA (3 μl, containing approx. 50 ng) was added to 3.5
μl DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), and
denatured by heating for 5 min at 94°C. The tubes were
placed immediately on ice to prevent re-annealing of
dsRNA. RT-PCR was performed according to the modified
methods described by Gentsch et al., [20] and Gouvea et
al., [21] (Table 1) using 30 thermal cycles at 94°C for 1
min, 55°C; for 2 min, 72°C for 2 min followed by 10 min
incubation at 72°C.

Briefly, denatured dsRNA was added to a reaction mixture
consisting of 10 μl 5 × reaction buffer (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA), 8 μl of a deoxyonucleoside triphosphate mixture (consisting of 1.25 mM of each dNTP) (Promega), 3
μl 25 mM MgCl2 (Promega), 0.1 μl reverse transcriptase
from avian myeloblastosis virus (5 U/μl) (Promega), 0.5
μl Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/μl) (Promega,) and 1 μl of
each selected primer pair (20 pM) as detailed in Table 1.
VP4 and VP7 amplification reactions produced DNA
amplicons of ~880 and 1,062 bp respectively.
Multiplex semi-nested PCR
A semi-nested, multiplex PCR reaction was performed
using primers targeting the genotype-specific regions of
the VP4 and VP7 genes [20-24].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/4/46

G-type determination
Two μl (of a 1:100 dilution of the first round PCR product) was used as the template from the second round of
amplification along with 10 μl of 5 × reaction buffer, 6 μl
25 mM MgCl2, 2 μl dNTP (1.25 mM final concentration),
0.5 μl DNA Taq polymerase (5 U/μl), 1 μl of the 5'-common forward primer (20 pM) and 1 μl each of primers
specific for bovine G-types (G5, G6, G8, G10 and G11) as
reported previously by Gouvea et al., [22,23]. Amplification was performed using modified conditions described
by Falcone et al., [24]. Briefly, the thermal profile consisted of a 2 min incubation step at 94°C, followed by 30
PCR cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 42°C for 30 sec and 72°C
for 45 sec and a final extension period for 7 min at 72°C.
P-type determination
Second round amplifications were carried out using Con2
and Con3 consensus primers and three different sub-typing primers (Table 1), as previously described by Gouvea
et al., [21].

First and second round amplicons were resolved in a 1.5%
(w/v) molecular biology grade agarose gel, stained with
0.1 mg/ml ethidium bromide and viewed under ultraviolet light.
DNA Sequencing and phylogenetics analysis
Amplified DNA fragments were purified using a QIAGEN
PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and
sequenced in both directions. Nucleotide sequences were
assembled and analysed by DNAStar software (Lasergene,
Madison, WI). All sequences were compared against those
available in the current GenBank database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html. Sequence
data from the giraffe samples were entered in the GenBank database under the following Accession numbers
[GenBank: EU548032 and GenBank: EU548033].

Separate alignments for the Giraffe VP7 and partial length
VP4 amino acid sequences were performed. The alignments were imported into Mega4 and neighbour-joining
trees were calculated with Poisson correction, deleting all
sites where a gap appeared in any sequence. Statistical
confidence was established by carrying out 1000 bootstrap replicates and branches were collapsed unless supported by 80% of the bootstraps [25-28].

Results
Preliminary characterisation of the giraffe faecal specimen
The presence of RV in the faecal specimen obtained from
the 14-day old giraffe was assessed initially by T-EM. Clusters of negatively stained RV particles with an average
diameter of 70 nm were observed (Fig. 1) in the electron
micrographs. These particles were similar in shape when
compared to those RV of human and bovine origin (data
not shown).

RV in the faecal specimen was confirmed after purification
and subsequent analysis of the dsRNA banding profile in
a SDS-PAGE gel. The electropherotype obtained was compared against several unrelated RV strains obtained from
other animal and human sources (Fig. 2). The profile for
Giraffe rotavirus (GirRV) (Fig. 2, lane 7), displayed the
typical group A rotavirus dsRNA genome banding pattern
(consisting of a 4, 2, 3, 2 arrangement) characteristic of
the 'long' RNA electropherotype pattern.

specific consensus primers, located at the beginning (1–
21 nt) and end (1,062–1,036 nt) of this gene. In a seminested PCR, using a set of internal specific primers, the Gtype was determined as G10 (Fig. 3, lane 9).
Similarly, partial gene 4 sequence was amplified and subsequently genotyped using primers for the detection of
widely distributed bovine P-types. These data identified a
P[11] genotype (Fig. 4, lane 6).

The identification of the corresponding G- and P-types
were established by RT-PCR on the purified dsRNA from
the giraffe sample (using primers listed in Table 1). The
complete VP7 gene was amplified using a pair of broadly

The genotypes for giraffe rotavirus (GirRV) detected in the
faecal specimen were classified as G10P[11].
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences derived
from VP4 and VP7 genes was undertaken, using a set of
similar genes selected from the current databases, for
comparison purposes. Comparisons with the VP4 and
VP7 sequence from the giraffe sample revealed closest
similarities to bovine RV sequences. Alignment studies
(data not shown) showed a 98% identity at the amino
acid sequence level between giraffe and bovine species.

The full length VP7 amino acid sequence was analysed
and compared to 15 well-established G-genotypes previously published. GirRV was most similar to a bovine G10
gene [Accession number GenBank: X57852] (Fig. 5 and
Table 2).
Comparison of the partial VP4 amino acid sequence of
GirRV with 27 P-genotypes previously reported for group
A rotaviruses revealed the closest branching relationship
to the bovine P[11] type, [Accession number GenBank:
D13394] (Fig. 6 and Table 3).

[28] and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data
were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion
option). There were a total of 293 positions in the final dataset. The Giraffe sequence is identified with the arrow as
shown in the figure.

Discussion
In this report we describe the identification and subsequent molecular characterisation of a RV strain detected
from a 14-day old Rothschild giraffe with acute diarrhea.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection
of RV in a giraffe. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the
GirRV strain was closely related to bovine RV strains.
There is limited information on the prevalence of RV in
zoo environments and exotic species. In 1978, Eugster
and colleagues described the clinical and laboratory findings of an outbreak of pneumoenteric disease in a zoo
nursery [29]. This was the first study of its kind to report a
RV-associated infection in zoo animals. More recent studies identified RV in a variety of exotic species in their natural habitats and zoo nurseries [30-33]. Petric and
colleagues [30] identified a wide range of animals that
were sero-positive for RV in zoo environments. In Peru,
Rivera et al., [31] examined sera from alpacas (Lama pacos)

for antibodies to 8 viruses known to infect other domestic
animals. On the basis of these data and additional supporting clinical information Rivera et al. concluded that
RV infects alpacas. Puntel et al. [32] reported a serological
survey that investigated for a variety of viruses in llamas
on Argentinean farms. Samples taken in this study were
tested for antibodies against viruses known to infect cattle
(including bovine rotavirus). Results showed that 87.69%
of llamas tested positive for bovine RV antibodies. More
recently Parreno et al., [34] reported the G- and P-types of
two RV strains isolated from newborn guanacos (Lama
guanicoe) that presented with acute diarrhoea in Argentina. Group A RV with a G8 genotype was identified. Phylogenetic analysis of these RV strains, showed a close
relationship to other G8 bovine RV previously reported in
Japan, the USA and Switzerland. The P-types identified in
this study, included the common P[1] and an unusual
P[14] type, related to human and goat P[14] strains. This
was the first report of a G8P[14] strain in Argentina [34].
In our study, we employed RT-PCR based genotyping
methods to successfully identify the G- and P-type associated with the RV strain from the giraffe fecal specimen.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the GirRV possessed a
'long' electropherotype pattern, typical of the majority of
RV strains from human and animal sources. The VP7 and
VP4 genes were sequenced and compared to a selection of
the corresponding genes of human and bovine origin.
Sequence comparisons showed a close genetic similarity
to RV strains reported previously in bovine animals.

shown in the figure.

Epidemiological studies of rotavirus infections are
increasingly revealing a diversity of strains co-circulating
in the human and animal populations worldwide. This
strain diversity may be due to two mechanisms – the accumulation of point mutations (genetic drift), which generates genetic lineages and leads to the emergence of
antibody escape mutants, and genetic shift, operating
through gene reassortment arising from dual infection of
a single cell [34].
Rotavirus G10P[11] strains, are commonly found in cattle
and have frequently been associated with asymptomatic
neonatal infections in India [35]. Indeed G10P[11] has
also been detected in a minority of bovines in Ireland
[36]. Therefore, studying the distribution of rotavirus G-

and P-types among various animal species is important to
improve our understanding of RV epidemiology and the
mechanisms by which these viruses evolve, cross the species barriers, exchange genes during reassortment, and
mutate via the accumulation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and/or other genetic rearrangements.

Conclusion

References

This is the first study to report the molecular characterization of rotavirus in a giraffe calf. These data underpins the
necessity for continuous surveillance of rotavirus in animal and human populations to improve and extend our
understanding of potential zoonotic links.
