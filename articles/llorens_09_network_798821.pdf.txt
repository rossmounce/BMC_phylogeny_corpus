Abstract
Background: Sequencing projects have allowed diverse retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons from different
eukaryotic organisms to be characterized. It is known that retroviruses and other retro-transcribing viruses evolve from
LTR retrotransposons and that this whole system clusters into five families: Ty3/Gypsy, Retroviridae, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao and
Caulimoviridae. Phylogenetic analyses usually show that these split into multiple distinct lineages but what is yet to be
understood is how deep evolution occurred in this system.
Results: We combined phylogenetic and graph analyses to investigate the history of LTR retroelements both as a tree
and as a network. We used 268 non-redundant LTR retroelements, many of them introduced for the first time in this
work, to elucidate all possible LTR retroelement phylogenetic patterns. These were superimposed over the tree of
eukaryotes to investigate the dynamics of the system, at distinct evolutionary times. Next, we investigated phenotypic
features such as duplication and variability of amino acid motifs, and several differences in genomic ORF organization.
Using this information we characterized eight reticulate evolution markers to construct phenotypic network models.
Conclusion: The evolutionary history of LTR retroelements can be traced as a time-evolving network that depends on
phylogenetic patterns, epigenetic host-factors and phenotypic plasticity. The Ty1/Copia and the Ty3/Gypsy families
represent the oldest patterns in this network that we found mimics eukaryotic macroevolution. The emergence of the
Bel/Pao, Retroviridae and Caulimoviridae families in this network can be related with distinct inflations of the Ty3/Gypsy
family, at distinct evolutionary times. This suggests that Ty3/Gypsy ancestors diversified much more than their Ty1/Copia
counterparts, at distinct geological eras. Consistent with the principle of preferential attachment, the connectivities
among phenotypic markers, taken as network-represented combinations, are power-law distributed. This evidences an
inflationary mode of evolution where the system diversity; 1) expands continuously alternating vertical and gradual
processes of phylogenetic divergence with episodes of modular, saltatory and reticulate evolution; 2) is governed by the
intrinsic capability of distinct LTR retroelement host-communities to self-organize their phenotypes according to
emergent laws characteristic of complex systems.

Background
Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are abundant selfish
components of living organisms that have helped sculpt
the complexity and size of their host genomes over the
course of evolution [1]. In particular, retroelements (retrotransposons and retroviruses) constitute a widespread
super-family of MGEs that are reverse-transcribed into a
double-stranded DNA copy for insertion into their host
genomes. Retroelements can be divided into four major
systems: the long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements; the
tyrosine recombinase (YR) retroelements; the non-LTR
retroelements; and the Penelope retrotransposons (for a
review, see [2]). Our study is about LTR retroelements.
These encompass the broad panoply of LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses circulating among plants, fungi
and animals and can be classified into four major groups
or families: the Ty3/Gypsy, the Retroviridae, the Ty1/Copia
and the Bel/Pao families (see [2]). LTR retroelements share
ancestry not only with other retroelement systems, but
also with diverse host genes and with a variety of viruses
[2]. The most obvious examples of viruses evolutionarily
related to LTR retroelements are plant caulimoviruses
(Caulimoviridae). These are circular double-stranded DNA
pararetroviruses that replicate in plants via a RNA intermediate evolved from LTR retroelements [3]. Although
caulimoviruses do not have LTRs, they have been
included in this work because their study is essential for
understanding the deep history of LTR retroelements. For
simplicity's sake, we will use the term "LTR retroelement
system" throughout the rest of this paper to refer collectively to all families investigated, including caulimoviruses.
An important aim of the post-genomic era is to classify all
MGEs and viruses inhabiting (or circulating in) living
organisms to understand their role not only as pathogenic
agents but also as vectors of evolution. Regarding LTR retroelements, phylogenetic analyses usually show how families split into multiple distinct lineages (clades and
genera), but it is yet unclear how deep evolution occurred
in this system. The traditional notion in the origin and
evolution of the distinct families is monophyletic, but
such an assumption has been challenged by increasing
evidence suggesting that natural evolution can proceed by
gradual and vertical means, but also through distinct
modular, saltatory, and reticulate events [3-14]. In general, phylogenetic analyses accumulate systematic and
sampling errors when attempts are made to force natural
evolution into a tree-like mode. In the words of WF
Doolittle [15] - molecular phylogeneticists will have
failed to find the true tree, not because their methods are
inadequate or because they have chosen the wrong genes,
but because the history of life cannot properly be represented as a tree. Our research is consistent with this perception. In a previous study [16] we discovered a network

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

of relationships between Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR
retroelements on the basis of gag and pol polyproteins.
Our results suggested a scenario of polyphyly, whereby we
proposed three Ty3/Gypsy ancestors in the deep evolutionary history of the Retroviridae (that is the three kings
hypothesis). Later [17], we found that on the basis of clan
AA of aspartic proteases [18], this network extends not
only to the Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao and Caulimoviridae families
but also to other host peptidases, described in both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes (on this topic, see also
[19,20]). This triggered our interest in investigating the
natural history of LTR retroelements, not only as a tree but
also as a network system. In this regard, network biology
is an emerging field of graph theory that does not provide
all the answers to all evolutionary questions, but that
offers an appropriate framework for the study of complex
systems (for more information on this topic, see [21-24]).
Taking this into primary consideration, we performed
(and present in this paper) a comprehensive study investigating not only the phylogenetic diversity of LTR retroelements, but also their evolutionary dynamics beyond
phylogenetic trees. In particular, we will show how
eukaryotic LTR retroelements are not only a phylogenetic
system but also a self-organized system of scale-free characteristics, as observed in all complex networks of major
scientific and social interest.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic patterns of LTR retroelements based on pol
LTR retroelements known to date can be classified into
four major families, namely Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao
and Retroviridae [2]. These share ancestry with the Caulimoviridae [3] through two common polyproteins, gag and
pol. Gag usually contains three protein domains called
matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC). Analyses based on this polyprotein are rarely reported because
it evolves rapidly. In contrast, pol consists of four protein
domains termed protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT),
ribonuclease H (RH), and integrase (INT). RT shows a
robust phylogenetic signal and it is commonly used for
inferring the evolutionary history of LTR retroelements
(see [2]). The RT evolutionary history comprises multiple
distinct phylogenetic patterns and is further supported by
other phylogenies inferred on the basis of RH [8], INT
[4,25] and PR [17]. However, increasing evidence suggests
that this history is accurate only with respect to the clustering of OTUs into lineages (clades and genera) because
evolution of transposable elements is in most cases modular (see [5]). Indeed, in attempts to investigate the deep
history of LTR retroelements, the internal tree topology
usually accumulates systematic errors and shows various
important discrepancies depending on the pol protein
domain evaluated. Upon this, in a previous approach [26]
we found that when LTR retroelement phylogenies are
inferred from the concatenation of two or more protein

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

domains, the statistical power of the analysis is increased
and diverse (but not all) single-gene discrepancies are corrected. This strategy enables taxonomy levels to be
assigned to the different OTUs evaluated and provides an
accurate perspective on the multiple distinct phylogenetic
patterns of each family. With this aim, we used an alignment concatenation of the PR, RT, RH and INT pol protein domains to infer the phylogeny of each family using
the Neighbor Joining (NJ) method of phylogenetic reconstruction [27]. A description of each family follows (for
more details about sequences and lineages, see Additional
file 1 or the section "Sequences" in Methods).
Ty3/Gypsy
These elements constitute a family of retroviruses and LTR
retrotransposons widely distributed among the genomes
of plants, fungi and animals. According to the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),
Ty3/Gypsy elements were originally classified into two
major genera called Metaviridae and Errantiviridae (see
[2]). For some time, this classification has been an important reference in LTR retroelement taxonomy, but it is now
considered inconclusive by many authors because
sequencing projects have revealed new lineages, updating
the original perspective. As shown in Figure 1A, the
inferred phylogeny of Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements reveals
two large branches. The first branch (in red) encompasses
all chromodomain-INT-containing LTR retrotransposons
[4], usually called chromoviruses [28]. This branch
includes at least two well-supported clusters of LTR retrotransposons, here named "Plants" and "Fungi/Vertebrates". The cluster of plant chromoviruses splits into six
clades detailed in the figure, while that of fungi and vertebrates consists of seven clades. This includes a new clade,
which we call V-clade, based on the name suggested by
Oliver Piskurek (in personal communication) to describe
Amn-like [29] and Sushi-like chromoviruses of vertebrates,
collectively. The chromoviral branch includes other divergent fungal elements, which have unclear classification.
The second Ty3/Gypsy branch (in black), referred to as
Branch 2, encompasses the remaining lineages of nonchromoviral Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons and plant
and animal retroviruses.
Ty1/Copia
This is a family of retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons
abundantly represented in the genomes of plants, fungi
and animals. The present ICTV classification [30] of the
Ty1/Copia into three genera - Pseudovirus, Hemivirus and
Sirevirus - has limitations identical to those of Ty3/Gypsy
LTR retroelements. It was important for understanding
the original family but it is not conclusive for managing
the currently-available diversity of the Ty1/Copia family.
As shown in Figure 1B, the inferred phylogeny of Ty1/
Copia LTR retroelements based on pol reveals two major

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

branches, respectively depicted in red and black. The first
branch, which we call Branch 1, is supported by bootstrap
and encompasses the original Pseudovirus genus (see
[31]) together with a clade called GalEA [32], specifically
found in marine bilaterians and all CoDi-like LTR retrotransposons described in diatoms. The wide variety of
CoDi-like elements splits into four clades that we simply
name A, B, C and D. One of the most exciting aspects of
CoDi-like elements is that the different elements belonging to clade A encode INTs carrying a putative chromodomain at their C-terminus (see Additional File 2, AF2A).
The second Ty1/Copia branch encompasses the remaining
lineages of LTR retrotransposons and potential retroviruses, including the previously described Copia-like hemiviruses and sireviruses.
Bel/Pao
These constitute a family of LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses that have been described to date only in metazoan genomes. According to the ICTV classification,
members of the Bel/Pao family are called semotiviruses
(see [2]). A later study [33] showed that the Bel/Pao family
can be divided into five clades called Pao, Sinbad, Bel, Tas
and Suzu. Taking a step forward, we show in Figure 2A that
on the basis of the inferred pol phylogeny, these five can
be collected into three branches that we have numbered 1,
2 and 3. Branch 1 (in red) encompasses two clades - Tas
and Bel - of LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses found
in the genomes of cnidarians and protostomes; Branch 2
(in black) includes the Pao and Sinbad clades of LTR retrotransposons described in protostomes and deuterostomes; Branch 3 (in blue) consists of a single clade called
Suzu, which includes only LTR retrotransposons that have
so far been described exclusively in vertebrates.
Caulimoviridae
These comprise a retro-transcribing family of viruses that,
in a yet unclear saltatory event, evolved from LTR retroelements to DNA pararetroviruses (see also [3,13]). As
shown in Figure 2B, the inferred pol phylogeny of caulimoviruses reveals four branches, which we term "classes"
following a viral systematic similar to that of Retroviridae
retroviruses (discussed below). The four caulimovirus
classes may be divided into six lineages - Caulimo-, Soymo, Cavemo-, Tungro-, Badna- and Petuvirus - according to the
genera proposed by ICTV [34] and further corroborated
by [3]. Class 1 (in red) includes two genera - Caulimovirus
and Soymovirus; Class 2 (in black) consists of two other
genera - Tungrovirus and Badnavirus - and it is the most
abundant branch of Caulimoviridae elements; Class 3 (in
blue) represents the genus Cavemovirus. The phylogeny
also includes the Petunia Vein Clearing Virus (PVCV),
which constitutes the genus Petuvirus. This element falls
close to Class 1 but occupies the deepest position in the
phylogeny (Class 4 in green).

Retroviridae
These are a family of retroviruses restricted to vertebrate
animals. These retroviruses originally received attention
when infectious representatives were characterized in
humans. However, it is now known that any LTR retrotransposon capable of recruiting a third ORF envelope
gene (env) is potentially capable of becoming a retrovirus
(env is the most basic difference between LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses). Consistent with ICTV [34], the
inferred phylogeny of Retroviridae based on pol shows
seven genera - Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, Epsilon-, Spumaretroviridae and Lentiviridae - that together with ERV-L
elements we divide into three classes, 1, 2 and 3 (according to [16,35] and references therein). As shown in Figure
2C, Class 1 comprises gamma- and epsilonretroviruses;
Class 2 includes lentiviruses, delta-, alpha- and betaretroviruses; and Class 3 encompasses spumaretroviruses and
ERV-L elements. This analysis includes an element called
Snakehead retrovirus (SnRV) [36], which has unclear classification; but the common LTR retroelement phylogeny
(shown in Additional file 1) places this sequence within
Class 1. Finally, the analysis also shows a Spumaretroviridae-like element that we found in genome of Danio rerio
and that we call Danio rerio Foamy Virus Type 1 (DrFV-1).
This is a complex retrovirus displaying the typical gag and
pol ORFs of LTR retroelements and three additional ORFs
that show no similarity to any sequence currently known
(including env). DrFV-1 is taxonomically important
because; 1) it is unclear if it is a true retrovirus carrying a
highly divergent env plus two accessory or additional
genes or a LTR retrotransposon just carrying three additional genes; 2) its presence in Danio rerio suggests that
spumaretroviruses are more widely distributed than previously thought. In Additional file 2 AF2B, we show diverse
sequence comparisons using gag and pol ORFs of DrFV-1
as queries against the search of taxonomic HMMs available at the Gypsy Database (GyDB) [26]. These show that
DrFV-1 is a spumaretrovirus, but also an intermediate
sequence among the Retroviridae and other LTR retroelement families.
What does the post-genomic era suggest about LTR
retroelement macroevolution?
Phylogenetic analyses help to classify the diversity of LTR
retroelements by assigning taxonomy levels to each family. For evaluating the whole system, Additional file 1
shows the inferred phylogeny of the 268 LTR retroelements investigated based on pol using the NJ method of
phylogenetic reconstruction. This tree reports a trichotomy that separates the five evaluated families into three
major clusters - Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao and Ty3/Gypsy-Caulimoviridae-Retroviridae (TCR). The latter suggests an ancestral
node common to three families that probably corresponds to the Ty3/Gypsy family in light of its wide distribution. While this evidences an evolutionary history

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

mainly driven by gradual means, LTR retroelement trees
often show branching variations in the internal topology,
due to diverse reticulate processes. These may be due to;
A) the different rates of evolution among the distinct retroelement protein domains (i.e. modularity [4,5]); B) the
incidence of natural mechanisms such as gene recruitment [37], genome rearrangement [6,7] and recombination [8-10]; C) horizontal transfer, caulimoviruses and
exogenous retroviruses (and more rarely, endogenous retroviruses and many LTR retrotransposons) usually spread
via infection or by horizontal means [11,12,14]; D) saltatory evolution, caulimoviruses are DNA viruses evolved
from LTR retroelements (see [3,13]). These processes support an alternative scenario more appropriately described
as a network than as a tree (see the phylogenetic networks
shown in Additional file 2 AF2C). In this regard, in a previous study [16] we explored the Ty3/Gypsy origins of Retroviridae retroviruses comparing the Ty3/Gypsy family with
the three Retroviridae classes 1, 2 and 3. We found a network whereby Ty3/Gypsy lineages of plants and fungi, such
as Tat and Athila elements and chromoviruses, can be
related to the Retroviridae Class 1. In turn, other Ty3/Gypsy
lineages of insects, such as Micropia/Mdg3 clade and errantiviruses, can be related to Classes 2 and 3. In light of this
polyphyletic scenario we proposed the three kings
hypothesis [16], according to which the three Retroviridae
classes can potentially be tracing three Ty3/Gypsy ancestors, emerged at different evolutionary times (see, Additional file 2 AF2C). Therefore, while we can accept that the
Retroviridae evolved from the Ty3/Gypsy family, the way in
which their distinct lineages appeared or can be related
with the Ty3/Gypsy family, is probably not monophyletic.
This perspective stimulated our interest in evaluating the
evolutionary dynamics of the five LTR retroelement families as a whole system. Upon this, sequencing projects
continuously reveal multiple distinct communities of LTR
retroelements overlapping in the genome of a single
eukaryotic host (see [28,38-40]). It is well known that
eukaryotes usually transmit their retroelement communities via germ lines (i.e. by vertical means), except in the
case of exogenous retroviruses and caulimoviruses which
spread horizontally although only within the boundaries
of the same biological supergroup. In other words, the
host distribution of the distinct LTR retroelement communities is fairly vertically at the phylum level. Taking this
into account, we superimposed the phylogenetic patterns
of the LTR retroelement system over the tree of eukaryotes
to investigate their macroevolutionary history, at distinct
evolutionary times (Figure 3). Although we assume five
major supergroups of eukaryotic hosts (Excavata,
Rhizaria, Archeoplastida, Chromalveolata and Unikonta,
according to [41]) no information about LTR retroelements in Excavata and Rhizaria has been published yet (as
far as we know). Therefore, the framework depicted in Figure 3 focuses only on the host distributions of LTR retroe-

Evolutionary history of LTR retroelements superimposed over the tree of eukaryotes. The tree of Ty3/Gypsy LTR
retroelements is depicted in blue; that of Ty1/Copia elements in yellow; Bel/Pao in black; Retroviridae in violet; and Caulimoviridae
in green. This set of trees together defines a natural network constrained by the tree of eukaryotes. The figure includes information about diverse reticulate events in the evolutionary history of LTR retroelements. The framework has been divided into
three major transitions to elucidate the natural histories of the distinct LTR retroelement communities on the basis of the
most likely ages of their hosts, calibrated by previous molecular estimations. The first transition is emphasized in light grey, the
second in light red, and the third in light blue.

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

lements described in Archeoplastida, Chromalveolata and
Unikonta. These were divided in three major transitions
by assuming times of emergence, according to the age and
macroevolution patterns of their hosts, calibrated by prior
molecular estimations and the fossil record. There follows
a discussion of the three transitions based on their most
parsimonious interpretation.
The first transition traces the most likely root of the LTR
retroelement system and covers a long episode in the history of life. This is approximately 1,950-2,170 Millions
years ago (Mya) between the Archean and the Proterozoic.
The transition runs from the earliest eubacterial fossils
and the first unicellular algae to the segregation of eukaryotes into the major supergroups (3,500-1,330 Mya [4247]). According to this framework, the root of the LTR retroelement system is dichotomous as it consists of two
families - Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy -, which segregated into
two separate phylogenetic patterns. This is probably
because of the genomic rearrangement of int that differentiates these two. Subsequently, Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses
acquired a GPY/F module and a chromodomain. The
wide distribution of Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses, not only in
algae but also in land plants, amoebae, fungi and animals
and chromalveolates, suggests that these constitute the
oldest branch of Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons. In Figure 1, we distinguished two branches in regards of the Ty1/
copia family. Branch 2 spreads among algae, plants, fungi
and animals and Branch 1 among fungi, diatoms and
marine animals. Also, a prior study [48] describes a Ty1/
Copia taxon close to the GalEA clade (Ty1/Copia Branch 1)
in red algae, suggesting that the two Ty1/Copia branches
probably co-existed with Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses before
the split between plants and unikonts (1,550 Mya according to molecular estimations [46,47]). These estimations
are older than the earliest predictions of the fossil record
(1330-720 Mya [43-45]), but the absence of fossil evidence for the early history of plants, fungi and animals
might be because these were probably small or microscopic soft-bodied organisms. Another interesting aspect
of this transition is that it seems to link the root of the LTR
retroelement system with the evolutionary history of
other retroelements. The similarity in both sequence and
gag-RT-RH genomic architecture between LTR- and YR retrotransposons suggests an ancient gag-pol form, from
which these two systems evolved, probably diverging
from other retroelement systems. The segregation of LTRand YR retroelements seems delineated by several
genomic differences. YR retroelements captured a tyrosine
recombinase (yr) gene (see [49]), while LTR retroelements
recruited an int gene (probably from DNA transposons
[50]) and a clan AA pr gene from the host genome [20].
Particularly, the history of clan AA gives additional support to the notion arguing that the history of life diversity
is a network of networks, at distinct levels of complexity.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

This enzyme family spreads in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes and can be divided into two major structural
forms; 1) the single-domain ORF typically found in LTR
retroelements and several host genes [17,20]; and 2) the
two-domain pepsin monomers of eukaryotes classified as
the Family A1 at MEROPS [18]. It is commonly assumed
that the ancestral clan AA form is the single domain ORF
and that pepsins evolved from this form by gene duplication [51]. While this is supported by the wide distribution
of the single domain ORF in proteobacteria [17,20] a
recent issue has potentially extended the putative origin of
pepsins (until now restricted to eukaryotes) by describing
homologues in oceanic and plant symbiotic bacteria [19].
This finding re-opens debate about the origin of clan AA
but it is, in a way or another, consistent with a major idea;
certain genetic units (retroelements and viruses included)
of eukaryotes may have evolved from the recombination
and assembling of minor genetic elements during the
prokaryotic-eukaryotic transition, as proposed in [52,53].
The second transition covers approximately 1,000 million
years in the history of life. It should be dated at the segregation of early eukaryotes into their major supergroups
(1,330-380 Mya based on [43-45,54]). The transition
spans the interval from the Proterozoic to the Devonian
Period within the Phanerozoic, during which all major
groups of eukaryotes underwent dramatic diversification
including key events such as the divergence between primitive animal phyla (e.g. Porifera, Cnidaria, Ctenophora)
and higher phyla; the origin of Eumetazoa (1300-940
Mya [54,55]; the Cambrian explosion 540-500 Mya [56]);
the rise of vertebrates [57]; the emergence of land plants
(probably back to the Ordovician or even the Cambrian
Period [58,59]); the origin of plant-fungal interactions
[60]; and the divergence between arthropods and priapulids [61]. During this transition, the Ty1/Copia and
Ty3/Gypsy radiated a variety of lineages, and the Bel/Pao
and the Retroviridae families emerged in eukaryotes. To
date, there has been no conclusive evidence of Ty1/Copia
sibling lineages shared by plants and fungi, but Ty3/Gypsy
phylogenies show two clusters of fungal and plant chromoviruses that are closely related to each other (see Figure
1). Chromoviruses are thus putative markers of ancient
interactions between plants and fungi. Interestingly, while
chromoviruses spread among vertebrates, they disappear
from the genomic record of cnidarians, mollusks, protostomes and basal deuterostomes (according to current
data). In contrast, what we find in these organisms are
traces of Ty3/Gypsy Branch 2. We can therefore assume that
Ty3/Gypsy Branch 2 elements inhabited bilaterian
genomes before the split into protostomes and deuterostomes (761-531 Mya according to [54,62]). Granted this
assumption, the oldest Ty3/Gypsy lineage in metazoans is
probably Mag cluster that spreads among cnidarians, protostomes and deuterostomes. Returning to the chromovi-

ruses, it is unclear whether they were driven to extinction
in protostomes, echinoderms and urochordates or were
horizontally transmitted from plants or fungi to vertebrates. Horizontal transmission seems to be the simplest
explanation in view of the strong similarity between Vclade and fungal chromoviruses, but if so, the event is at
least as ancient as the split of Osteichthyes into actinopterygians and sarcopterygians. This is because V-clade is
present in fishes such as Danio rerio but also in amphibians and amniotes (see also [29,63]). Note that stem
osteichthyan occurs in the fossil record in Upper Silurian
times, 421 Mya [64], and the oldest unequivocal actinopterygians come from the Lochkovian (410-415 Mya [65]).
Moreover, the fossil record indicates that the split between
the Actinopterygii and the Sarcopterygii could have taken
place between 421 and 416 Mya [62] (consistent with
phylogenomic analyses based on expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) [66]). The Ty1/Copia family is also spread among
the genomes of cnidarians, arthropods and deuterostomes, but to our knowledge there is no current evidence
of Ty1/Copia elements in platyhelminthes and nematodes.
Based on the current availability of data, this suggests that
Ty3/Gypsy ancestors diversified much more than their Ty1/
Copia counterparts during the history of metazoans. The
wide distribution of Bel/Pao LTR retroelements among
metazoans and their absence from fungi and plants additionally suggests that their origin antedates the split
between primitive animals and higher eumetazoans
(1300-380 Mya according to [43-45,54]). Bel/Pao LTR retroelements are spread among cnidarians, protostomes
and deuterostomes and can be related to Ty3/Gypsy and
Retroviridae elements in view of the same int order and the
presence of a GPY/F module at the C-terminus of INT (see
Additional file 2 AF2D). This supports the notion that LTR
retrotransposons capable of becoming metazoan retroviruses (Ty3/Gypsy Branch 2, and Bel/Pao and Retroviridae
LTR retroelements) might have emerged before the bilateria split into protostomes and deuterostomes (761-531
Mya according to [54,62]). In regards of Retroviridae retroviruses, Figure 3 shows that the distribution of Retroviridae
Class 1 overlaps with that of V-clade chromoviruses in
Danio rerio (and probably in Salmonidae species [67]),
amphibians and sauropsids ([29]). This suggests that the
first true Retroviridae taxa probably appeared in the history
of vertebrates before the Osteichthyes split into the actinopterygians and the sarcopterygians. The presence of
DrFV-1 in Danio rerio suggests that Retroviridae Class 3
might be as old as Class 1. However, the remaining spumaretroviruses known so far are restricted to synapsids
(see [68]). Further analyses are thus required to clarify
whether spumaretroviruses also inhabit (or circulate in)
the genomes of other fishes, amphibians and sauropsids,
to calibrate the origin of Retroviridae Class 3.
The third transition covers the period from 330 million
years (from the Paleozoic Era) to the present. This is con-

comitant with diverse events such as the origin of the first
gymnosperms (360-248 Mya [59,69]); the split of amniotes into sauropsids and synapsids (330.4-312.3 Mya
[62]); the massive radiation of winged insects (380-325
Mya [70]); and the emergence of flowering plants (130-90
Mya [59,71]). These evolutionary events generated new
levels of complexity and new ecosystems that probably
activated massive radiations of retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons, as well as the emergence of caulimoviruses.
Evaluating information of amniotes, we find that the Ty3/
Gypsy and the Retroviridae distributions overlap in the
genomes of sauropsids, but there is no evidence of functional Ty3/Gypsy elements (nor Ty1/Copia and Bel/Pao) in
mammals where the Retroviridae are in turn widely distributed. Despite this, mammalian genomes preserve traces of
ancient Ty3/Gypsy inhabitants, which are not pseudogenic
relics but neo-functionalized host genes evolved from LTR
retrotransposons (see, [25,72]). This suggests that Ty3/
Gypsy LTR retroelements were co-opted by synapsid hosts
(mammals and their extinct relatives) and that their
extinction as selfish MGEs allowed the three Retroviridae
classes to spread in these organisms (see also [73]). The
two largest Retroviridae distributions in amniotes correspond to gamma- and betaretroviruses (see ICTV, online
[74]). An important characteristic of Retroviridae retroviruses is that almost but not quite all of them carry additional genes. Briefly, gammaretroviruses (Class 1) display
the simplest retrovirus organization, typical of Ty3/Gypsy
and Bel/Pao retroviruses; betaretroviruses usually carry
one additional gene plus a DUTPase similar to that of various fungal chromoviruses [75]; the remaining genera in
classes 2 and 3 show diverse additional genes, which are
preserved depending on the lineage (for more information, see [26]). This suggests that gammaretroviruses are
probably molecular fossils still preserving the ancient gagpol-env structure of Ty3/Gypsy retroviruses, and that the
acquisition of additional genes by the remaining Retroviridae genera was an important step in their evolution. As
suggested by Katzourakis et al. [68]; "retrovirus accessory
genes and mammalian mechanisms of innate immunity
will be best understood when considered as the join products of macroevolutionary conflicts played out over a geological scale". When evaluating the known genomes of
gymnosperms and angiosperms, we find massive radiations of Athila/Tat-like Ty3/Gypsy retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons overlapping with their chromoviral
counterparts and with several Ty1/Copia lineages (see [7679]). The ancestors of Athila/Tat (i.e. all potential the Ty3/
Gypsy retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons of plants)
might have thus emerged before the divergence of conifers
and angiosperms (360-248 Mya [59,69]). The most likely
age of these lineages is concomitant with the appearance
of Retroviridae Class 1 gammaretroviruses in amniotes
(consistent with the three kings hypothesis). A similar
perspective is shown by currently available genomic information on winged insects such as flies, mosquitoes and

others. In these organisms we find multiple distinct lineages of Ty1/Copia, Ty3/Gypsy and Bel/Pao LTR retroelements [39]. In view of the emergence of winged insects
(380-325 Mya [70]), these LTR retroelements most probably emerged simultaneously with those of Retroviridae
classes 2 and 3 in amniotes (again consistent with the
three kings hypothesis). Interestingly, caulimoviruses can
also be related with Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements on the
basis of the gag-pol region and they show (like the Retroviridae) diverse additional genes, which are necessary for
their viral life cycle and transmission (see [3,74]). However, this does not relate caulimoviruses with Retroviridae
retroviruses, as their distinct additional genes cannot be
related through function or though similarity. In fact,
prior trends relate caulimoviruses to other virus systems
based on the common share of the movement protein
[13], indicating that the most likely origin of caulimoviruses, was chimeric (an hybrid between Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons and other RNA viruses). It is not yet clear
whether the ancestors of caulimoviruses were inhabitants
of plants or insects, but their most likely origin was at least
simultaneous with the emergence of flowering plants
(130-90 Mya [59,71]). This third transition also covers the
Ty1/Copia LTR retroelements called CoDi-like described in
diatoms (origins of diatoms dated 164-166 Mya according to [80]). The existence of a Ty1/Copia lineage -CoDi-A
- showing INTs with chromodomain makes of CoDi-like
elements an interesting case study that merits further
attention.
It is too early to draw more specific conclusions, but we
think that CoDi-A elements might have captured their
chromodomain independently from Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses. Note that this feature is a ubiquitous component of
many eukaryotic proteins and that no chromodomain has
been to date detected in other Ty1/Copia elements. This
finding is however important in the topic as prior to the
present study the status of chromovirus was thought to be
restricted to diverse Ty3/Gypsy lineages.
Mapping reticulate (network) evolution patterns
In the former section we presented an evolutionary framework showing how the history of the LTR retroelement
diversity is shaped not only by phylogenetic patterns but
also by epigenetic host factors. It is important to stress that
no Retroviridae and Bel/Pao element has been described in
the genomes of plants and fungi, and no caulimoviruses
have been detected to replicate within animal cells or in
their genomes (they act only as vectors). On the more
diverse and widely-distributed families such as Ty3/Gypsy
and Ty1/Copia we have an identical perspective. The lineages of these two families described in plants have moreor-less counterparts in fungi and animals but do not
inhabit the animal and fungal genomes, and vice versa.
The simplest interpretation of this hierarchy is that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

eukaryotes impose natural barriers to the distribution of
LTR retrotransposons, retroviruses and caulimoviruses.
This lends support to the idea of an inflationary mode of
evolution, whereby we think that the various diversity
explosions of eukaryotes induced massive LTR retroelement radiations, as well as the emergence of a network of
LTR retroelements. This network co-evolves with the
eukaryotic complexity. The first traces of this network are
defined by the original genomic reorganization that segregated the Ty3/Gypsy and Ty1/Copia families into two different phylogenetic patterns. While these two diversified into
multiple distinct lineages, our results suggest that the
appearance of the Bel/Pao, Retroviridae and Caulimoviridae
families in this network can be related with distinct inflations of the Ty3/Gypsy family, at different evolutionary
times. This led us to speculate with the idea that Ty3/Gypsy
LTR retroelements were more successful than their original Ty1/Copia counterparts during evolution, because
their phenotypic plasticity is higher than that of Ty1/Copia
LTR retroelements. This might have allowed the Ty3/Gypsy
family to explore new adaptive strategies during its diversification from which not only lineages, but also families,
evolved at distinct geological eras. Following this idea, it
is reasonable to assume that the intrinsic evolution of LTR
retroelements imprints diversity patterns into a variety of
functional retroelement features that derive in the emergence and fixation of molecular phenotypes associated to
ancient processes of divergence and convergence. Upon
this, in a previous issue we described the existence of a
network of relationships between Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements (discussed in the former section).
This network resides not only in sequence similarity and
host distributions but also in the duplication-diversification-loss of three molecular features. These are the
number of Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys (CCHC) zinc finger arrays [81] at NC; the sequence flap motif of PR [82];
and the GPY/F motif of the INT module with an identical
name [4]. As shown in Figure 4A, the number of CCHC
arrays in NC varies depending on the Ty3/Gypsy lineage
and the Retroviridae class (links in red), and both the flap
and the GPY/F motifs delineate multiple variant motifs
based on sequence polymorphisms preserved similarly
(links in black and blue, respectively). These features are
lineage-specific markers, suggesting a network scenario of
poly- or paraphyly, since they occur not only in Retroviridae retroviruses of vertebrates but also in all Ty3/Gypsy LTR
retrotransposons and retroviruses of plants, fungi and
other animals. We have also noted that with respect to the
PR marker, we surveyed the diversity of clan AA PRs in a
subsequent issue [17]. In that work, we constructed a collection of HMMs as well as a major PR consensus template
based on six amino acid patterns and found that not only
Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae PRs, but also all other PRs,
show specific motifs in sequence pattern 3 of this template. This extended the Ty3/Gypsy-Retroviridae network to

Figure markers of reticulate evolution
Intrinsic 4
Intrinsic markers of reticulate evolution. A) In a previous paper [16] we described a network between diverse Ty3/GypsyRetroviridae lineages based on similarity, host distributions, and variability of three evolutionary markers. These are the CCHC
array in NC (network in red); the sequence motif (namely, pattern 3) defining the structural flap of PR (in black); and the GPY/
F motif in the C-terminus of INT (in blue). In view of this network, we performed a deep characterization of these and other
markers found not only in the Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae families but also in the Bel/Pao, Caulimoviridae and Ty1/Copia families. As
shown in the figure we considered: B) the number of CCHC arrays in NC; C) all possible variants of pattern 3 in PR; D) the
variants of the ILG motif in PR; E) the presence-absence and ORF position of int; F) all possible variants of the GPY/F motif in
INT; G) the presence-absence of the chromodomain in INT; H) the presence-absence of env; I) the presence-absence of additional genes. The figure includes an idealized retroelement genomic reference noting the usual position of each marker.

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

all other LTR retroelements, but only based on PR. From
that point onwards, our aim was to investigate all possible
markers, not limited to the Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
families but including all other LTR retroelement families.
In this particular, we identified eight features that can be
classified as gene features (GFs) or as polymorphic amino
acid motifs (PAMs). Additional file 3 AF3A provides a
detailed "sequence-to-sequence" summary of all these
markers and their distinct states, which are also illustrated
in Figure 4. A description follows.
Figure 4B shows the CCHC array in NC, which is involved
in virion assembly, RNA packaging, reverse transcription
and integration processes [83]. This feature is a PAM with
six states; zero, one, two or three CCHC arrays (detailed
using sequence logos). Arrays based on two and three
motifs vary with respect to the size of the sequence
between motifs and zero arrays have no logos representation.
Figure 4C describes PR pattern 3 (i.e. the potential or real
flap of PR), which confers specificity on the enzyme by
carrying important substrate-binding functions [82]. We
distinguished 20 states in this PAM including loss of the
motif. Nineteen of these were grouped into four major
variants: GANG, GIGG, TIHG and LPIV. This follows the
nomenclature introduced in [17] and applies an ad hoc
criterion of classification. That is, in its major consensus
form, the GANG variant, encompasses a variety of motifs
related by the predominance of an alanine (or a hydrophobic residue) and an aspartate/asparagine at the second
and third positions, respectively. The TIHG variant
describes the consensus for diverse motifs that show a
threonine at the first position, followed by an isoleucine
(or a hydrophobic residue) at the second position and a
histidine at the third (or vice versa). The GIGG variant
encompasses all sequence motifs with an isoleucine (or
another hydrophobic residue) at the second position followed by two glycines. The LPIV variant describes an atypical motif found in only a few Ty1/Copia PRs. Finally, all
motifs for which we were unable to resolve a consensus
state were combined into a single state considering the
loss of the motif. This classification updates the characterization performed in [17] for Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao and caulimoviral PRs and revises various Ty3/Gypsy motifs resolved
in [17].
Figure 4D shows the ILG motif located at the C-terminus
of PR. This is one of the most well-preserved features of
clan AA PRs [84], and, in the proteinase fold, corresponds
with the structural loop that interacts with the catalytic
motif (see [17]). On this PAM, we distinguished three
states (plus the motif loss) detailed through sequence
logos. These are the LLS motif found in Ty1/Copia PRs, the
ILG motif predominant in all other PRs, and a PWL-like

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

motif preserved by spumaretroviral PRs. Again, motifs for
which we resolved no consensus were collected into a single state describing the motif as lost.
Figure 4E details the int gene position, on the basis of
diverse positional rearrangements in the retroelement
genome or its loss. This GF presents five states; first, downstream of pr, as in all known Ty1/Copia element genomes
(see [7]) and Gmr-1 Ty3/Gypsy elements [6]; second,
downstream to rh as usually found in Bel/Pao and Retroviridae LTR retroelements, and almost but not all Ty3/
Gypsy LTR retroelements; third, truncated and in reverse
frame, as in the REM1 Ty3/Gypsy chromovirus, which only
preserves the GPY/F module and the chromodomain [85];
fourth, gene loss, as in almost all caulimovirus species
except PVCV [86], which shows an INT in direct frame and
upstream of gag (this is the fifth state).
Figure 4F describes the GPY/F motif of the module with
the same name [4]. The role of the GPY/F module is not
yet understood but it is located at the C-terminal end of
INT. This trait coordinates the integration of the retroelement into the host genome [87,88]. In regard to the GPY/
F motif, we distinguish 13 states. 11 of these have been
detailed through sequence logos, and were divided into
five variants following a criterion similar to that used for
pattern 3 of PR. The GPY/F variants are called GPx, KP/LT,
GGw, GDY/F and GxV/I. The GPx variant includes motifs
in which a glycine and a proline predominate at the third
and fourth positions, respectively. The KP/LT variant collects motifs in which lysine and threonine respectively
predominate in the third and fifth positions, while the
fourth position is proline or isoleucine/leucine. The GGw
variant represents a state based on these three residues.
The GDY/F variant encompasses motifs with glycine and
aspartate/glutamate (or relatives) at the third and fourth
positions, respectively. The GxV/I variant comprises, three
motifs commonly based on six residues and usually showing glycine and isoleucine-valine at the fourth and six
positions. The two other states considered are motif loss
plus the absence of the whole module (as in Ty1/Copia
INTs and caulimoviruses, which have no INT). This
description improves the previous evaluation in [16],
which was based only on Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae INTs.
In this update we include the GPY/F module we found in
Bel/Pao INTs (see Additional file 2, AF2D) and revise the
previous motif of the Mag-like GPY/F module.
Figure 4G illustrates the chromodomain (i.e. the chromatin organization modifier). The chromodomain is a small
protein module involved in chromatin re-modeling and
regulation of gene expression (see also [89]), it is found in
a variety of host proteins but also at the C-terminus of INT
coded by almost all Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses and CoDi-A
Ty1/Copia LTR retrotransposons (see Additional File 2,

Page 12 of 31

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

AF2A). A previous study showed that Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses probably use this feature for chromatin integration
[90]. We consider two states, presence and absence, for
this GF.
Figure 4H corresponds to env, which potentially confers
the capacity to become a retrovirus and is thus necessary
for transferring retroviruses cell-to-cell. This is another GF
in which we consider the presence or absence of the feature.
Figure 4I considers the additional (accessory) genes of
many but not all LTR retroelements. These play a variety
of roles in the life cycle and transmission of Retroviridae
and Caulimoviridae viruses. It is now known that several
Ty3/Gypsy elements belonging to the Tat clade and
another clade of fungal chromoviruses are also carriers of
additional genes (see [31,75]). In this case, we consider
the presence or absence of one or more additional genes
as a GF.
The above described markers find functional arguments of
reticulate evolution in the fact that lineages of distinct
families can share not only a marker, but also distinct
states of such a marker (for a more exhaustive detail, see
Additional file 3). Certainly, the differential preservation
of GFs normally derives from ancient processes of gene
recruitment, recombination and genomic rearrangement.
PAMs have a more intriguing interpretation, as their distinct states could be potentially tracing divergence, convergence, or just random evolution (mutational
saturation). In regard to the ILG motif at PR, the LLS and
ILG variants make an important taxonomical differentiation between Ty1/Copia PRs and the remaining PRs associated to ancient processes of divergence between Ty1/Copia
and Ty3/Gypsy ancestors (with a very few exceptions all
Ty1/Copia PRs preserve the LLS motif). To evaluate the
three other PAMs, we designed a bipartite multigraph
model (a graph based on two types of nodes) contemplating three networks analyses that relate the distinct
genomic communities of LTR retroelements in eukaryotes
with; A) number of CCHC arrays; B) PR pattern 3; C)
GPY/F motif. As shown in Additional file 3 AF3B, these
networks reveal how the distinct LTR retroelement communities of eukaryotes usually preserve particular PAM
states depending on their host distributions. Subsequently, we designed a bipartite multigraph model that
contemplates three other networks (Additional file 3,
AF3C) relating the three PAMs with the distinct phylogenetic patterns of the LTR retroelement system. This second
model illustrates how the multiple distinct states of each
PAM are usually redundant among the distinct LTR retroelement families but lineage-specific within them. Certainly, the distribution of PAMs observed in the two
discussed graph models cannot be explained as the result

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

of a random association, as the incidence of edges over
every PAM node in a random network is approximately
the average between distribution edges and nodes [22].
PAMs are thus powerful indicators of divergence, within
and among families but we do not dismiss convergent
processes in this interpretation because the distinct PAM
variants collect motifs and not all sequences belonging to
a lineage, in which a variant is predominant, are necessarily carriers of such a variant. This reveals a high degree of
phenotypic plasticity whereby evolution is capable of continuously developing, maintaining and recycling functional mechanisms. In other words, whether because of
divergence or convergence, it is thus reasonable that PAM
variations derive from the fact that the diversity of LTR retroelements is in continuous expansion, not only among
families but also within families. We can thus assume that
the history of LTR retroelements depends not only on
phylogenetic patterns and epigenetic factors, but also on
the phenotypic plasticity of LTR retroelements that enables them to adapt these phylogenetic patterns under any
epigenetic change of the host environment. This means
that the multiple distinct LTR retroelement phenotypes
we have investigated are not arbitrary and as a consequence they are limited by the system as a whole. If such
an intrinsic feature is in part responsible, to an observable
extent, for the complexity of the system, this could result
in self-organized, scale-free characteristics.
Indeed, one of the most important properties of scale-free
networks is that the connections between nodes are distributed following a power law. Such a property derives
from two facts; 1) real-world networks evolve over time
and expand by addition of new nodes; 2) new nodes preferentially attach to nodes that are highly connected
(according to [22,24]). This directly results in the smallworld phenomenon in which most nodes can be reached
from any other in a small number of steps (the threshold
is often regarded to be six). Taking this into primary consideration, we aimed to investigate the connectivity
between complex phenotypic identities, within and
between families. With this aim we combined the eight
markers shown in Figure 4 into marker combinations
(MCs) to construct a network model based on phenotypic
neighbors. In total, we constructed 268 MCs (summarized
in Additional file 3 AF3A), one for each LTR retroelement
taxon. However, MCs determine phenotypic identities,
which can be common to two or more lineages. This
means that the number of MCs can be reduced to 76
(detailed in Additional file 3, AF3D), free of redundant
combinations. By comparing MCs and detecting common
subsets of features, we can trace neighbor relationships,
which are shortcuts between lineages of different families.
For example, several Ty3/Gypsy errantiviruses and Retroviridae spumaretroviruses share the following phenotype "gag with zero CCHC arrays, plus TIHG PR plus INT after

Page 13 of 31

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

RH with GPY/F module carrying a KPT motif"- but differ
in the state of the ILG motif and the presence or absence
of additional genes. Errantiviruses and spumaretroviruses
are related by their MCs by paths of length 2, two steps or
trait changes. Following this strategy we constructed the
global network of phenotypic neighbors (Figure 5) connecting all MCs, represented by 76 nodes (in white). Single changes are represented by red links, which attach two

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

MCs if they share 7 of the 8 MC features. This produces
seven single-node MCs with no links and seven additional
components of connected neighbors (detailed in boxes).
We then added 2 links and 1 intermediate node among
the MCs of components that share 6 of the 8 MC features
(in blue). Next, we added 3 links and 2 nodes (in green)
to relate those MCs that share 5 of the 8 MC features (for
more details, see Additional file AF3E). Connections

Phenotypic neighbors' network. Constructed using the 76 non-redundant MCs (white circles) summarized in Additional
file AF3D and 75 intermediates (blue and green dots), as nodes. Each MC is detailed in brackets and accompanied by the names
of the lineages that display or share such a phenotypic combination. MCs attach to other MCs on the basis of their phenotypic
proximity in single steps. Those sharing 7 of the 8 MC features are connected by a red link. This assumption derives in seven
MCs with no links and seven components of phenotypic neighbors, distanced by a single step (in boxes). Components were
joined by assuming intermediate phenotypic combinations representing the number of steps needed to relate MCs of distinct
components separated by two or three changes. In blue, we join MCs in one component that share 6 of the 8 features with the
remaining components. Similarly, in green, we relate MCs sharing 5 of the 8 features. For simplicity's sake, links among MCs of
the same initial connected component are not traced as these already have one-step neighbors (for more details, see Additional file AF3E).

Page 14 of 31

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

between MCs in the same component are omitted. In our
model, these would be redundant because any MC that
can be reached through two or three red links can also be
reachable through a blue or a green path, respectively. In
doing so, all the initial components are connected in a
global network that can be navigated under the relation
"one link one change". Intermediate blue and green nodes
(inserted between MCs separated by two and three
changes, respectively), can be considered as combinations
potentially describing lineages not yet characterized or
extinguished forms, so that the model allows the evaluation of not only reticulate processes but also putative evolutionary gaps in the history of LTR retroelements. For
instance, one can navigate the Ty1/Copia family through
single changes, except to all CoDi-A and two sirevirus
MCs. These combinations need two changes to reach
other Ty1/Copia phenotypes as they differ in the presence
of a chromodomain at INT (in the case of the CoDi-A
combinations), or in the duplication or triplication of the
CCHC array (in the case of the large C-terminus of sirevirus gags). For example, in the CoDi-A case an intermediate
node represents any putative sequence halfway between
the conventional Ty1/Copia and their CoDi-A counterparts
(for instance a CoDi-A element without chromodomain),
etc.
The network model of phenotypic neighbors supports the
idea of shortcuts (phenotypic proximity) between the Ty3/
Gypsy and Ty1/Copia families. Some Ty3/Gypsy combinations are as close to other Ty3/Gypsy as to Ty1/Copia phenotypes due to; 1) the presence of a chromodomain in
CoDi-A elements; 2) the Ty1/Copia-like INT ORF order of
the Ty3/Gypsy lineage called Gmr1. Another interesting
aspect of this network is that it shows multiple distinct
identities (MCs sharing the eight markers) and links
among different Retroviridae and Ty3/Gypsy combinations,
and among the latter and distinct Bel/Pao combinations.
The proximity of these three families in terms of phenotypes and ORF organization, suggests that the Ty3/Gypsy
family diversified much more than the Ty1/Copia family,
during the course of evolution. Interestingly, the analysis
supports the notion of a poly- or paraphyletic relationship
between diverse Ty3/Gypsy phenotypes and those of Retroviridae retroviruses (in agreement with the three kings
hypothesis). Similarly, distinct caulimoviral combinations link to each other via a single step but need three
steps to connect with other phenotypes (because of differences as diverse as the absence of INT, GPY/F module,
env, chromodomain, etc). Almost all the caulimovirus
links observed in the network correspond with the
changes needed to reach diverse Ty3/Gypsy combinations.
Finally, the model of phenotypic neighbors is consistent
with the principle of preferential attachment; the high
connectivity of a few Ty3/Gypsy phenotypes permits the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

navigation of the whole network step-by-step and from
one family into another. Statistical evaluation of the network topology reveals that the connectivities between
nodes are power-law distributed (see Additional file
AF3E) confirming that the network is free-scale. This type
of distribution cannot be explained as the result of a
purely random process, as the edge distribution in a random network follows a Poisson distribution with a characteristic value, which is the number of edges divided by
the number of nodes (for more details about random networks, see [22]). Moreover, the inference of mean shortest
path (the average of the shortest distances between pairs
of nodes) gives a value of 5.61 indicating that the network
has also small-world characteristics. This is because the
model is composed of phenotypic components characterized by the presence of shortcuts between almost any pair
of combinations. In fact, the network is constituted by
nodes which, in most cases, describe MCs common to two
or more lineages. Consequently, if we trace as many links
between a pair of nodes as lineages share each represented
MC, we can observe that the clustering coefficient follows
a power-law (see Additional file AF3E), as typically
observed in hierarchical networks (see [22]). The emergence of this hierarchy reinforces the idea that the phenotypic combinations with high connectivity are widely
distributed in the system, probably because they represent
the most adaptive strategies in the phylogenetic history of
LTR retroelements. This fact is not trivial and merits further attention, as it shows that phenotypic plasticity displays both structure and distribution. This structure is
determined by properties that do not depend only on
phylogenetic phenotype per se or by epigenetic effect of
host evolution, but by the capability of the system to selforganize according to emergent laws characteristics of real
complex systems.

Conclusion
The evolutionary history of LTR retroelements can be
traced as a time-evolving network that depends on phylogenetic patterns, epigenetic host-factors and phenotypic
plasticity. The Ty1/Copia and the Ty3/Gypsy families represent the oldest patterns in this network that we found
mimics eukaryotic macroevolution. The emergence of the
Bel/Pao, Retroviridae and Caulimoviridae families in this
network can be related with distinct inflations of the Ty3/
Gypsy family, at distinct evolutionary times. This suggests
that Ty3/Gypsy ancestors diversified much more than their
Ty1/Copia counterparts, at distinct geological eras. Consistent with the principle of preferential attachment, the
connectivities among phenotypic markers, taken as network-represented combinations, are power-law distributed. This evidences an inflationary mode of evolution
where the system diversity; 1) expands continuously alternating vertical and gradual processes of phylogenetic
divergence with episodes of modular, saltatory and reticu-

late evolution; 2) is governed by the intrinsic capability of
distinct LTR retroelement host-communities to self-organize their phenotypes according to emergent laws characteristic of complex systems.

Methods
We used distinct Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements classified at GyDB [26] and diverse protein
sequences of known Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao and Caulimoviridae
elements as queries to search online against the nonredundant database at NCBI [91]. The programs tBLASTn
and BLASTp [92] were used for these searches. We collected the outputs involving non-redundant sequences
with their available full-length genomes and built a database of 268 non-redundant LTR retroelements. Additional
File 1 shows the inferred NJ tree of these sequences providing detailed information about the names, taxonomy,
hosts and Genbank accessions of all taxa. Of this set, 28
sequences (summarized in Table 1) correspond to new
sequences retrieved from diverse sequencing projects at
NCBI.
The most conserved parts (cores) of the PR, RT, RH and
INT protein domains encoded by the investigated

sequences were used to perform four multiple alignments,
one for each domain, using Clustal X 2.09 [93]. Alignments were manually refined using GeneDoc [94] in
shade mode assuming the following groups of amino acid
similarity: [T, S - small nucleophile amino acids], [K, R, H
- basic amino acids], [D, E, N, Q - acidic amino acids and
relative amides], and [L, I, V, M, A, G, P, F, Y, W - hydrophobic amino acids]. Next, alignments were concatenated
into a single pol alignment using the "Join Alignments"
server [95]. For methodological reasons, pol alignment
presents the INT domain of all Ty1/Copia elements and
those of REM1 and Gmr-1 Ty3/Gypsy elements after RH, as
in the remaining sequences aligned. Using a similar criterion, caulimoviruses are represented with a gap covering
the entire INT region in this alignment. Pol alignment is
available in various formats within the GyDB collection
[96] in the section "Pol" in box "Multiple alignments" at
[97].
Pol alignment was used to infer the phylogenetic reconstruction analysis shown in Additional File 1. Subsequently, this alignment was divided into five subalignments, one for each retroelement family. We then rerefined each family's alignment using GeneDoc and

inferred five phylogenies, shown in Figures 1 and 2. All
phylogenetic reconstruction analyses employed MEGA
4.1 [98] and the NJ method with 100 bootstrap replicates
under the following conditions: uniform rates among
sites and pairwise deletion of gaps. Additionally, we constructed phylogenetic networks based on pol using SplitsTree 4.10 [21]. Details on the methodology used are
available in Additional file 2 AF2C.
We investigated diverse phenotypic features such as duplication and variability of amino acid motifs or several gene
features that imply different genomic organizations.
These were classified as PAMs or as GFs, respectively. We
constructed alignments based on the following PAMs: 1)
CCHC array at NC; 2) PR pattern 3 motif; 3) PR ILG motif;
4) INT-like GPY/F motif. For the CCHC array, we created
a sequence database with all motifs found at the C-terminus of gag. As described in Figure 4, we found five different CCHC array motifs in this database (plus the motif
lost), which was subsequently divided in five sub-databases one for each state, these were used as inputs to perform five multiple alignments. For the three other PAMs,
we used GeneDoc to select and to split (as alignments)
each trait from pol alignment. By position (gaps
included), PR pattern 3 lies between positions 60-70 of
pol alignment; PR ILG motif between positions 200-203;
and GPY/F motif between positions 1568-1574. Next,
each PAM alignment was divided into a number of subalignments (one for each PAM state as described in Figure
4), which were used as inputs to CheckAlign [99] to construct sequence logos [100]. Conditions used for constructing logos were those previously described in [16,17].
All PAM alignments are available in various formats
within the GyDB collection [96], in box "Polymorphic
amino acid motifs" at [97]. As GFs we considered the following features: 1) presence/absence or ORF position of
four genomic features; 2) INT ORF organization; 3) presence/absence of chromodomain at the C-terminus of INT;
4) env; 5) additional genes. Information of these features
was retrieved from Genbank accessions or by comparing
the sequences with the HMM search at GyDB. Finally, the
eight markers were combined in a single MC as follows:

MC = (m1i , m2 i , m3i , m4 i , m5i , m6 i , m7 i , m8 i )
where "mx" is one of the eight markers and "i" the state of
"mx".
An exhaustive summary of all markers, their states and the
distinct MCs is available in Additional file 3, Sections
AF3A.

ferent scenarios. Bipartite networks are multigraphs in
which nodes can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, P
and Q, so that each edge in E joins one node in P with one
node in Q. These were constructed following steps 1 and
2 or steps 1 and 3 summarized in Additional file 4 using
Mathematica 7.0 [101].
Finally, MCs' information was used to construct an undirected multigraph model to investigate the global network
structure of the system, based of the phenotypic proximity
of the distinct MCs, in single steps. Undirected multigraphs are graphs in which the same pair of nodes may be
linked by more than one edge and where the order of the
nodes is not relevant. This model was constructed following steps 1, 4a and 4b summarized in Additional file 4
using Mathematica 7.0 [101]. We calculated the degree
distribution P(k), the average clustering coefficient C(k)
and the mean shortest path of this graph using Mathematica 7.0 and the steps 5a and 5b summarized in Additional
file 4. The degree distribution is the probability that a
node in the network has a degree of value k (represented
in the horizontal axis). This parameter represents the relative amount of hubs (highly connected nodes) in the network. The clustering coefficient is the proportion of edges
connecting a node of degree k that form triplets. In short,
this parameter is the probability that subsets of distance 2
nodes form highly connected clusters. The mean shortest
path is the average of all the shortest distances between
pairs of nodes.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Eugene V. Koonin (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
USA)
Reviewer comments
A comprehensive study on the evolutionary dynamics of
LTR retroelements, using several network methods in conjunction with standard, alignment-based phylogenies. I
generally agree with the authors that phylogenetic trees
are not suited to fully describe the modular evolution of
mobile elements such as retroelements, so I think the use
of all these network analyses and representations is welcome. The conclusion on the existence of "big bang-like"
transitions in the evolution of retroelements (if I understood the authors' meaning rightly) is very appealing. The
details on evolution of specific groups of retroelements
will be of interest to researchers in the field.
Authors' response
We thank this referee for his positive evaluation. Yes, our
results suggest inflationary mode of evolution in the evolutionary history of LTR retroelements. This gives support
to the idea of that LTR retroelement evolution does not
proceeds as a tree but rather a network. The history of LTR
retroelements can be traced as network that evolves alternating gradual and vertical means, with diverse episodes
of modular, saltational, and reticulate evolution. Our
study gives additional support to; 1) the notion arguing
that the history of life not as a tree but as a network of networks; 2) the existence of "big bang" patterns in the evolution of biological systems as modeled by this reviewer in
prior studies [52,53] (see also our answer to Reviewer 3).
Reviewer comments
Despite my overall positive impression of this manuscript, I do perceive several problems at different levels:

1. The repeated and emphatic mention of "adaptive
landscape", "functional landscapes", "landscapes of
functional strategies" etc in this article does not refer
to fitness landscape as a mathematical concept or even
a concrete image but rather as a very general metaphor. Along the same lines, the discussion of the
power laws and how these apply to evolutionary networks, I think, needs to be more careful and concrete
(or just dropped altogether as it adds precious little to
our understanding of the evolution of retroelements,
or any other class of genetic elements). I think the
manuscript would benefit from toning down this rhet-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

oric that has the potential confuse the general audience and to annoy the experts.
2. I do not think that the authors' representation of
eukaryotic phylogeny is up to date. In particular, the
notion of "crown group" is, I believe, obsolete, and
should be abandoned. Neither is it appropriate to
speak of a "three-way split" between animals, fungi,
and plants. We know for a fact now that animals and
fungi are sister groups. The appropriate representation
of eukaryotic phylogeny at this time is a star of 5
supergroups (see Keeling et al. The tree of eukaryotes.
Trends Ecol Evol. 2005 Dec;20(12):670-6). Actually,
the representation of the eukaryotic phylogeny in Figure 4 (very appealing figure, indeed) seems to adhere
to the supergroup concept and is unobjectionable to
me but the text needs to be brought in sync with this.
3. I think the article would be more complete if the
authors at least touched upon the prokaryotic roots of
the modules that comprise the eukaryotic retroelements, for instance, the origin of protease of these elements from a distinct family of bacterial aspartic
proteases (Krylov DM, Koonin EV. Curr Biol. 2001
Aug 7;11(15):R584-7).
Authors' response
1) To avoid excess in both manuscript size and topics, we
have removed terms such as "adaptive landscape", "functional landscapes", and "landscapes of functional strategies" from the final manuscript version (see also our
response to reviewer 2). However, in our humble opinion
the underlying relationship between these terms and the
notion of "fitness landscape" merits further attention as it
may be not just metaphoric. That is, we noted that the distinct markers and their states evidence variability of
diverse functional features of LTR retroelements. This variability gives universality to the network and represents
functional phenotypes, which at the molecular level, offer
taxonomical differentiation. Note that one can distinguish a retrovirus from a retrotransposon based on the
presence or absence of an env gene, or can differentiate at
least two distinct strategies of integration based on the
presence or absence of a chromodomain module at INT
[87], etc. It is thus reasonable that, if the features we
describe enclose phylogenetically relevant taxonomic
states, these suggest variations over function probably
related with retroelement speciation. An interesting discussion is if "homoplasy" (convergence) represents a better explanation than "ancestral homology" (ancient
divergence) of such universality. The acquisition of GFs
seems independent as the original acquisition of such
functions is not by inheritance from a common ancestor.
This implies that the acquisition of a new mechanism is

Page 18 of 31

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

potentially capable to give selective advantage to the original ancestral lineage that captured the feature. Regarding
PAMs, the similarity of their distinct states, the hostdependent hierarchy of these states, and the synchrony
among particular states of distinct PAMs, suggest that the
diversity of the system expands continuously, within and
between families. Taking the Retroviridae as an example,
one can see that this family can be divided into a number
of genera collected in three classes. With a few exceptions,
we found that the distinct elements classified in each class
show the same markers states. If we now take Class 1 and
within it the genus gammaretrovirus, we will find that
each gammaretrovirus sequence has a particular marker
combination. We originally described this observation as
"functional landscape", as the relationship between this
and fitness landscape derives from the fact that markers
are lineage-specific and can be constituted in phenotypic
combinations. Hence, is there is a phenotypic combination that is representative for gammaretroviruses, that is
probably because such a combination is the most "adaptive" phenotypic combination for gammaretroviruses. If
so, any variation of the usual combination might be representing functional variations in the fitness of a gammaretrovirus, and this can be tested by both empirical and
computational methods. On the other hand, the redundancy of marker states observed between certain families
is clear evidence of reticulate (network) evolution. This is
not trivial regarding the discussion of power laws properties in the diversity distribution of LTR retroelements. Bigbang means can be related with power-law patterns (this
is a universal property of real world networks). Taking this
into primary consideration, we have rewritten the manuscript and improved several analyses to clarify this context.
2) Done, we removed expressions such as "crown eukaryotes" or "three way split" from the current manuscript version, updated Figure 4 (which in the final manuscript
version is Figure 3) and rewritten the related text following the line traced by this reviewer and by reviewer 2.
3) Done, the new manuscript version includes and discusses the clan AA topic at the prokaryotic-eukaryotic
transition.

Reviewer comments
The present version of the manuscript requires substantial
revisions. It is really difficult to read, both because its lack
of focus and the impressive number of typos it contains
(too numerous to be listed here!). The English also needs
to be significantly improved: the manuscript simply cannot be published as it is. It is a draft. Although there are
some interesting ideas in this work (the use of a non-treelike framework to discuss complex evolutionary scenarios

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

about mobile elements evolution), I do not feel its conclusions are solid enough or at least convincingly presented here.
Authors' response
The research has been significantly improved and the
manuscript has been carefully re-written to make the language accessible to any reader. We hope that this expert
will now find the new manuscript robust and straightforward.
Reviewer comments
Certainly, the polyphyly of Retroviridae into the Ty3/
Gypsy bio-distribution is clearly showed. It has been
extensively studied by the authors through the definition
of polymorphic amino acids markers (PAMs), i.e. some
key molecular characteristics used to classify mobile elements. Although I agree that Retroviridae origin is likely
polyphyletic based on these criteria, I did not find that
this fact proved the Three Kings Hypothesis (according to
which Retroviridae of classes I, II and III trace to three Ty3/
Gypsy sources that emerged at different times during evolution, before the split between Protostomes and Deuterostomes). In particular, I wonder whether the various
mobile elements discussed here can not recombine with
each other regularly enough, to the point that attempting
any temporal polarization of their evolutionary history
becomes impossible. To test that, I strongly encourage the
authors to perform one more analysis that would value
their research. They should use their PAMs to reconstruct
a global network including Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
elements altogether. Such a network (improving over the
fairly abstract figure 3) would display all the connections
between these mobile elements and it would thus help
deciding whether Retroviridae emerged from relatively
well isolated Ty3/Gypsy lineages (or whether this is
impossible to tell) and whether these Retroviridae can be
suspected of subsequent recombinations (or not). This
network reconstruction could be achieved by different
means, either through the recoding of the PAMs features
in a matrix of characters or by realizing a Splitstree analysis (for instance) of the whole alignments of Ty3/Gypsy
and Retroviridae sequences. That way, it would become
obvious whether their phylogenetic history is too complex
to be told or follows the Three Kings hypothesis. Subsequently, the taxonomical context in which the different
elements of this eukaryotic LTR retroelements network are
found could be superimposed to it, thus allowing the
identification of potential correlations between the taxonomic distribution and the recombination/emergence
events in Retroviridae and other LTR retroelements evolution.
Authors' response
Done, the new manuscript version includes phylogenetic
analyses and (as this expert recommended) network analPage 19 of 31

yses. In particular, we have inferred the evolutionary history of the five groups addressed in the previous study.
The phylogenetic inference is an important component of
the manuscript. While the evolutionary history of these
families has been fully addressed by prior research based
on the RT, there is no previous study considering the LTR
retroelement system as a whole, based on pol. This was
important to elucidate the distinct markers and perform
network analyses. With this aim, we used the tool SplitsTree to analyze the evolutionary history of LTR retroelements as a phylogenetic network. Then we superimposed
the phylogeny of LTR retroelements over their distributions. The former figure 3 has been removed from this version and its information is redundant over Figures 6 and
7. These two are bipartite multigraphs addressing the
same topic but in a more elegant way. From that point on,
it is important to clarify that the main objective of the
manuscript was not to test the three kings hypothesis but
to provide new insights on the network mechanisms ruling in the evolutionary history of LTR retroelements. In
this issue, the three kings hypothesis is a set of starting
conditions to activated our attention to the possibility of
a network history. In fact, while in the present paper we
have tested such a hypothesis in diverse manners following the reviewer's indications, it was addressed and published in a prior paper [16]. On the other hand, we
assumed various mechanisms of evolution including
recombination but we did not try to test them. This is
because their existence is well supported by prior publications investigating recent evolutionary patterns. We two
interesting examples of recombinant histories in the
potential Athila retroviruses of plants [9] and the HIV-like
Retroviridae retroviruses [10] of mammals, whereby new
forms emerge from the recombination of subtypes. Most
ancient cases are difficult to test probably because LTR retroelements can recombine with each other regularly
enough, to the point that attempting any ancient temporal polarization of their evolutionary history becomes a
daunting task. Testing reticulate events between distant
counterparts is extremely difficult because of 1) the different rates of evolution of the distinct genomic regions of
the retroelement taxa; 2) the wide divergence between
sequences accumulated during evolution; 3) extrinsic
constraints; 4) conflicting signals, etc. For instance, based
on the RT and RH the Retroviridae are more similar to each
other than to any Ty3/Gypsy lineage but the PR and the gag
polyprotein show different perspectives.
Reviewer comments
The authors could also discuss whether the variation of
their Diversity Index H may be biased and partly due to an
unequal taxonomical samplings between Deuterostomes,
Protostomes, Viridiplantae and Fungi's mobile elements.
In particular, they could establish whether the increase in
diversity of mobile elements in Opisthokonts is signifi-

cant. Presently however, the proposition that "many of
these events [at least three independent radiations of
mobile elements] are coincident with the major biological
transitions and changes in molecular and cellular complexity of eukaryotes ", although seducing, does not seem
fully justified by the material and analyses presented here.
(In my view, this same criticism also holds true for the
presumed "ancient radiation of mobile genetic elements
that is as old as the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes" evoked - yet not tested- by the authors). To summarize, to justify that the big bang model better fits the data
than the tree model, the manuscript should be more
focused on Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae evolution and
should better value the PAMs description and their analysis.
Authors' response
The diversity Index H analysis has been removed and substituted by network and relative frequency analyses. In
particular, the notion of inflationary means of evolution
is shown in figures 4-9. On the other hand, the set of
sequences - 268 - used in this study is non-redundant and
covers the most representative lineages of each family in
plants, fungi, animals, and unicellular organisms. There is
no bias in this study because it includes the non-redundant diversity of LTR retroelements to date known as well
as a number of new sequences introduced in this study
(summarized in Table 1). This means that we not only
focus on all known lineages of LTR retroelements but also
on new sequences and lineages addressed in this study
(see, Figures 1 and 2). The three biological transitions
were calibrated according to the most likely age of the LTR
retroelement host as phyla. This has been conducted taking into primary consideration previous studies with a
focus on molecular estimations and the fossil record. The
transitions cover: 1) from the earlier eubacterial fossils
and the first traces of unicellular algae eukaryotes until the
segregation of crown eukaryotes into plants, fungi and
animals: 2) From the split of plants, animals and fungi to
the Cambrian explosion, the rise of vertebrates, the emergence of land plants, etc; 3) the origin of the gymnosperms; the split of amniotes into reptiles and mammals,
the massive radiation of winged insects; and the emergence of flowering plants. The perspective of an ancient
radiation of LTR retroelements is supported by the wide
distributions of all LTR retroelement families and their
differential distribution in eukaryotes. Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses and the Ty1/Copia family are both widely distributed in the genomes of not only red and green algae but
also in plants, fungi and animals. This derives in the common assumption these two are the most ancient LTR retroelement patterns in eukaryotes (see [7,63]). A similar
criterion applies in the relationship between distribution
and age of the remaining LTR retroelement families. We
think that figure 4 is the test asked by this referee, as it is a

Reviewer comments
Editorial changes to be considered:

The background section is very complex (with lots of
information) and it is simply impossible to understand
(for a non specialist) without a figure. This section needs
extensive rewriting to clarify how the PAMs are defined
and their nature. Interestingly, such a figure almost exists
in the manuscript - it is figure 1-, and it should be introduced much earlier than page 8 (if possible by mapping
on it the classes I, II, and III).
Authors' response
The whole manuscript has been completely rewritten and
restructured. It includes a background section more accessible to any reader in broad terms. Much of the information mentioned by the expert has conveniently been
moved to corresponding subsections under 'Results and
discussion' and complemented by an improved version of
Figure 1, although now it is Figure 3. The current manuscript is conducted appropriately to reach and understand
the background of this figure.
Reviewer's comment to the revised manuscript
Reviewer comments
The paper by Llorens et al. entitled "Mapping the landscaping network principle in explaining the diversity and
evolutionary patterns of eukaryotic LTR retroelements" is
both too long and too complex (and in places hard to
understand). It requires significant revisions. This manuscript should be:

1. shortened
2. clarified
To focus on its main original point, the proposition of a
network framework to analyze the evolution of eukaryotic
LTR retroelements and to show that, once a "good" combination of characters is obtained, then the LTR element
mostly evolve within a lineage.
Authors' response
The final manuscript has been improved and reduced in
size (we have removed 13 pages of the last version) to
make it shorter and clearer than the former version as suggested by this reviewer.
Reviewer comments
To this end;

a) all the section entitled " Phylogenetic patterns of LTR
retroelements based on pol" (p.3-11) could be signifi-

cantly shortened (eventually removed or introduced as
Supp. Mat). According to the authors, this part does not
provide any really new perspective on the issue (cf. p.11),
and truly the core argument of their paper does not start
before p. 11 anyway
b) the text from "Under this scenario, " (p. 12) to 'in turn
evolving in a tree-like fashion" (p.13), if summarizing ref.
19 can be removed.
c) almost all their figures, but figures 4 and 5, can be
removed. Most of the networks presented here are too
complex, in particular those with two kinds of nodes. It is
not pedagogical. What the authors should do is reconstructing networks with one type of nodes (for instance
the taxa) and connect them when two nodes (two taxa)
share a common property (out of the 8 characteristics
listed by them to define an LTR element). Alternatively,
they could connect such nodes when they share a given
combination of characteristics. This could be the only figure of their paper, and it would make their point. If they
want to provide more in depth information, they could
color the edges and the nodes of this single network
according to various criteria (taxonomy, number of copies
in taxa...) thus mapping any additional information they
think is relevant.
d) there are many sentences, starting by the title, that are
impossible to understand and should be rewritten. Sentences like:
- "Here new strategies emerged passively and overlapped with prior strategies until configuring a complex network, whereby retroelement lineages co-opted
the most adaptive landscape, depending on their
molecular dynamics and host distribution. " (p.2)
- "Here, it is important to emphasize that the three
kings hypothesis does not intend to establish a direct
relation between these lineages but that argues three
Ty3/Gypsy ancestors in the evolutionary history of the
Retroviridae common ancient poly- or paraphyletic
scenario of diversity yet to be understood. » (p. 18)
- "At the LTR retroelement level, the functional landscape of a LTR retroelement taxon can vary, or be more
or less successful, if it gains or looses a marker or if a
marker in this taxon evolves from one state into
another." (p.24)
- "Thus, new strategies emerged passively in the LTR
retroelement system and overlapped prior strategies
until configuring a network, whereby retroelement
lineages co-opted the most adaptive landscape,
depending on their molecular dynamics and host distribution. That is "the landscaping network principle"

in explaining the diversity and evolutionary patterns
of eukaryotic LTR retroelements. » (p.26) should be
clarified or removed from the paper.
e) The notion of "landscape" is confusing and poorly
explained. The analogy may fit or it may not. But the use
of the word deserves more careful, direct, efficient explanations. The same criticism applies for the notion of
"functional strategies". What does it mean? This lack of
clarity entails that the notion of "landscaping network
principle" is almost impossible to understand.
Authors' response
a) Phylogenetic analyses were performed in order to follow the line traced by reviewer 3. It would be conflictive if
we remove such information. We have however reduced
the text as much as possible, according to the criticisms of
this reviewer, and particular care was taken in the process.
In addition, it is important to highlight that the perspective that remains unchanged since 1998 (page 11) is the
knowledge over the deep evolutionary history (the ancestral evolutionary relationships among families) and that
phylogenetic reconstruction analyses cannot convincingly
resolve this part of the LTR retroelement history. Actually,
this is the foundational topic in this manuscript. Phylogenetic inference is essential as it is the most robust method
to classify the OTU diversity into families and lineages.
Our study makes an important update over prior knowledge of LTR retroelement diversity (and taxonomy). This
is covered in the section entitled "Phylogenetic patterns of
LTR retroelements based on pol", where we investigate the
diversity patterns of all families and provide diverse and
previously unpublished results.

b) Done in the manuscript.
c) Indeed, there are many methods to construct network
models. Those we applied are well documented in graph
theory, the area of mathematics that deals with the mathematical foundations of networks. Bipartite multigraphs
(those with two types of nodes) are not complex; in fact,
one of their properties is their simplicity. What is complex
(because of its diversity) is the analyzed LTR retroelement
system. Bipartite multigraphs are appropriate to evaluate
the history of LTR retroelements based on two or more
independent features, as this history does not depend
only on a single feature. In this case, we considered markers (node 1), host distributions (node 2), and taxa or lineages (links). The obtained results can be quantitatively
and qualitatively interpreted because the density of each
set of links gives a clear vision of the frequency distribution of each PAM state under two independent scenarios.
However, to simplify the final manuscript version
(according to the general comment of this reviewer, "the
manuscript is too long and too complex") bipartite mult-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

igraphs have been removed from results and are now provided within Additional file 3. On the other hand, we
tested various graph methods. Constructing networks
using the distinct taxa as nodes and the distinct states of a
single maker as links only offers information regarding
such a marker. By itself this kind of model is not very
informative unless it integrates phylogenetic information.
Note, for instance, that should we join "skipper" with
"maggy" and "CoDi 7.1", based on a CCHC marker state,
we have nothing in particular except that these sequences
share that feature. For this reason it is important to resolve
the multiple phylogenetic patterns. Constructing networks using taxa as nodes and using all markers as edges
gives an impressive number of edges among all nodes.
This results in a complete graph because the distinct markers have states, which are common not to two retroelements but to a number of them. Moreover, a systemic
shortcoming with this model is that, in most cases, multiple distinct links among sequences within lineages mask
other relationships which are a priori more interesting
(e.g. those based on distinct families). In contrast, we
found markers of reticulate evolution, which allowed us
to overcome the mentioned obstacle. The most interesting
aspect of these markers is their universality. Using combinations of markers we have phenotypes associated to phylogenetic identities. This allows a better interpretation of
the network evolutionary dynamics, etc. Taking this into
primary consideration and recognizing the contribution
of this reviewer to the paper, we agree with him that the
work needs a more explicative network framework
addressing the main original point. This point is close to
the feeling of this expert as noted in his phrase; "the proposition of a network framework to analyze the evolution
of eukaryotic LTR retroelements and to show that, once a
"good" combination of characters is obtained, then the
LTR element mostly evolve within a lineage". With this
aim we have rewritten the manuscript and revised,
improved, and adapted undirected graphs to make them
more comprehensible in the line traced by this reviewer.
d) The sentences addressed have been revised and restructured in order to better convey their intended meaning.
e) We have changed the term "functional landscape" by
other terms such as "marker combination" and/or "phenotypic combination" (see also our response to Reviewer
1, in regard to a similar question). For the same reason, we
have changed the title of the manuscript to a more appropriate one.
Reviewer minor comments
The authors should be more careful in interpreting
"absence" if sequences from incomplete genomes are considered in their analyses. The possibility of an undersampling of the LTR retroelements should be discussed.

Authors' response
The study contemplates all currently known Caulimoviridae and Retroviridae genera considered at ICTV, plus a new
spumaretrovirus sequence we introduce for the first time
in this article. We also consider a number of Ty3/Gypsy,
Ty1/Copia and Bel/Pao LTR retroelements. This not only
covers all commonly known lineages but also extends
knowledge on the phylogenetic diversity of these families
(we describe new sequences and new lineages). Another
question is if such a sample is a good approximation of
the true diversity of LTR retroelements in eukaryotes.
Upon this, the study evaluates a number ofnon-redundant Retroviridae retroviruses ranging from distinct fishes,
amphibians and sauropsids to mammals. We equally consider a number of Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia and Bel/Pao LTR
retroelements retrieved from the genomes of distinct protists, plants, algae, fungi, amoebas, plathyelminthes, nematodes, cnidarians, crustaceans, winged and non-winged
insects, echinoderms, urochordates and vertebrates. We
believe that this gives sufficient information to extrapolate
conclusions and perspectives over both LTR retroelement
evolution and macroevolution, even if some of the used
host genomes are incomplete to date. We have shown that
plants have particular lineages of LTR retroelements, and
so do fungi, protostomes and deuterostomes, etc. Indeed,
if one were to investigate LTR retroelements in the
genome of a new flowering plant, a priori anything might
be found, but what any expert in the topic expects to find
are chromoviruses, Athila/Tat Ty3/Gypsy elements and Ty1/
Copia elements. That is, it is really difficult to think that
one can find a Retroviridae or a Bel/Pao sequence in such
genome. However, should such a rare case happen, the
most probable explanation is first, lab contamination,
and second, a very rare horizontal transfer, an exciting
exception meriting an important publication (despite all,
nothing is impossible). With this manuscript we update
prior perspectives but we are sure that further availability
of data will help to improve and calibrate the introduced
framework. With this, our conclusions are not problematic or biased are just a point in which we recapitulate
prior knowledge, contrast current information, and offer
a new framework for further evaluation (see also our
response to reviewer 3, in regards of the same question).
Another question is the presence of evolutionary gaps due
to the loss of lineages associated to eukaryotic extinctions.
Such a bias is plausible but we think that it is not an
inquisitive obstruction for studying and modeling the
evolution of LTR retroelements or that of their hosts. In
fact, this is another important argument supporting the
idea of using markers combinations instead of taxa. Networks based on combinations are not biased by the sampling or by the number of sequences used for each lineage.
Even more interestingly, they give some clues about putative extinguished forms or extant uncharacterized ones, as
we have illustrated in current Figure 5.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

Reviewer minor comments
The authors indicate that their pol data contained multiple distinct splits, and that these splits can be explained by
different modular, reticulate, and saltational evolutionary
events (p. 11). They could also be due to "mutational saturation", which should be discussed.
Authors' response
We cannot dismiss mutational saturation in diverse traits
of a retroelement genome. However, the sequences used
in this study correspond to coding sequences from which
we extrapolated their most conserved parts (cores) to perform alignments. All these cores show lineage specific
phylogenetic signal. That is, all sequences of all lineages
are more similar to each other than to other sequences, or
in other words, we did not observe multiple substitutions
in these traits that could lead us to think that their signal
is random (mutational saturation). However, the discussion of this possibility is important and has been
addressed in results to make an emphasis in the distribution of PAMs in both phylogeny and host distribution,
which cannot be explained by random patterns.
Reviewer minor comments
The authors should use a better phylogeny of reference
(see Simpson and Roger in Curr. Biol.): their knowledge
of the protist taxonomy is a bit too vague (see for instance
strange notions such as the supposed "three way split of
plants, animals and fungi" (p.15), the odd branching of
diatoms that the authors said are "informally classified as
protists" (p. 18)...)
Authors' response
Done. For simplicity's sake we used reference [41] suggested by Reviewer 1 (see the comments of reviewer 1), as
it is compatible and a bit more recent than the one suggested by this reviewer. In a similar manner, the expression "three way split" has been removed from the
manuscript. Regarding diatoms, as far as we know, they
are considered as chromalveolates. The root of chromalveolates in former Figure 4 (now Figure 3) delineates a star
tree together with the remaining supergroups. That is correct on the basis of the investigated hosts and their LTR
retroelement sequences we classify. Bear in mind that our
study focuses on the evolutionary history of LTR retroelements, not on the most accurate tree of life topology.
Reviewer minor comments
Likewise what are "crown" eukaryotes (p. 15)? Or rather
what eukaryotes are not crown eukaryotes? This notion is
problematic. And so his the notion of reptiles (a grade not
a clade) for a phylogenetic-based interpretation (p.17).
Strictly speaking, sentence like "In tetrapods, for instance,
the Ty3/Gypsy and the Retroviridae distributions overlap
until reptiles, but there is no evidence of functional Ty3/

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

Gypsy elements in other amniotes (neither Ty1/Copia nor
Bel/Pao). " (p.17) are problematic (and meaningless) for
many biologists trained as cladists. (This can be of concern since the authors seem to embrace the cladistic logic
when they reject protists since these taxa are a paraphyletic
group, p. 18).
Authors' response
The manuscript has been amended to offer a commonly
accepted vision. In particular, we removed the terms
"tetrapods" and reptiles from the text and use terms such
as sauropsids or synapsids. In regard to protists we do not
reject them, we just noted that as a group they are not considered monophyletic. We have however adapted Figure 3
according to the most recent trends over the tree of life.
We hope this referee will find the new topology appropriate.
Reviewer minor comments
Are the first trace of unicellular algae really as ancient as
3,500 Mya? (p.14)
Authors' response
The text did not exactly claim this. What we said is that the
first transition covers "from the earlier eubacterial fossils
and the first traces of unicellular algae eukaryotes to the
segregation of crown eukaryotes into plants, fungi and
animals" (this is from 3,500 to 1500-1330 Mya). We have
rewritten the text to clarify this and have changed "crown
eukaryotes" by a more appropriate term.
Reviewer minor comments
Some claims should be slightly toned down, such as "The
distribution of Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses not only in algae
[21,68,69] but also in land plants, amoeba [32], fungi and
animals [20,21] indicate that these constitute the oldest
branch of Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons." (p.14) It does
not "indicate" this, it "suggests" it at best. What if these
elements were moving over large taxonomical distances?
Broad distribution, in presence of lateral transfers, is hard
to interpret as ancient common ancestry. The same comment applies to the sentence "It is thus unclear which of
the two represents the oldest phylogenetic pattern in the
Ty1/Copia family, but the wide distribution of both
branches indicates that the Ty1/Copia family co-existed
with chromoviruses before the segregation of the crown
group into plants, fungi and animals (1,550 Mya according to molecular dates [71,72])" (p.14), and p.19.
Authors' response
Done, the above points have been rewritten with the
required care, and following the reviewer's recommendation. However, it is important to emphasize that, when
evaluating LTR retroelements, broad distribution in presence of lateral processes is not hard to interpret, as these

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

lateral processes happen between organisms of the same
phylum. Caulimoviruses infect plants, retroviruses of
insects normally infect insects, those of vertebrates infect
vertebrates, etc. This means that there are biological barriers imposed to caulimoviruses and retroviruses and that
these barriers have an evolutionary meaning. On the other
hand, it is obvious that while there are some examples of
LTR retrotransposons believed to be horizontally transmitted, the usual means of LTR retrotransposon transmission are germ lines. This is commonly accepted and
indicates that the wide distribution of the LTR retroelement diversity is a sign of deep ancestry. This is so even if
we characterize events of lateral transfer, which usually
only occur among closely related biological species.
Detecting ancient events of lateral transfer is a daunting
task but in certain cases can be mapped with reservations
(note the discussed example of chromoviruses in fungi
and vertebrates addressed in this paper). In one way or
another, this suggests that LTR retroelements can be used
as evolutionary markers of their host evolution.
Reviewer minor comments
I was unable to visualize the figures of network in the

Authors' response
As indicated in methods, these files are not figures. Such
material is provided as Mathematica notebooks, so that
any other author can reproduce our analyses using the
tool "Mathematica". To facilitate visualization and management of this material, the final manuscript version
joins Table 2 and all these notebooks in a mini web-site
provided as Additional file 4 (for more details, see Methods).
Reviewer minor comments
There are additional sentence for which the meaning is
unclear:

"These markers indicate that the diversity patterns of LTR
retroelements are not casually distributed. » p. 2 What
does casually means?
Authors' response
The intended word is "randomly", changed in the manuscript.
Reviewer minor comments
"The model finds support in the phylogeny of LTR retroelements superimposed over their distributions." What distributions? Taxonomical ones?
Authors' response
Distributions refer the distinct host distributions of LTR
retroelements. We have clarified in the manuscript.

Reviewer minor comments
"The evolutionary history of LTR retroelements is not a
tree but a networking system evolving in a tree-like fashion" (p.11) is a bit confusing. It should be improved
somehow. Same thing for "Under the assumption that
functional landscapes have not evolutionary meaning,
what we would expect is no redundancy among them."
(p.23) and "As this number is much closer to the number
of LTR retroelement lineages elucidated than to the
number of LTR retroelement taxa we can conclude that the
landscapes are lineage specific equally to the markers constituting it. " (p. 23)
Authors' response
Again, these points have been rewritten. We hope that the
revised text is now appropriately exposed.

Reviewer minor comments
How can biological transitions be edges on the multigraph network? (p.31)
Authors' response
Transitions constitute links; it is a relationship derived
from the distinct LTR retroelement hosts. Anyway, to clarify understanding of the manuscript, we substituted the
model based on transitions by a more appropriate model
more according to previous points addressed by this
reviewer.
Reviewer's report 3
Emmanuelle Lerat (Université de Lyon, Villeurbanne, France)
Reviewer comments
In this paper, Lloréns and Moya, using the occurrence of
protein markers in different products of retroelement and
retroviridae sequences, have matched the combination of
signatures according to the host species in order to determine the link between elements. This approach is by some
extend similar to other methods consisting of phylogenetic reconstructions based on presence/absence of genes.
The approach is quite interesting and gives a different
view of the classical phylogenetic representations.
Authors' response
We thank this expert for her help and positive feedback on
the background's manuscript. This new manuscript version is a great improvement over the former version. It is
co-authored with three other researchers and includes
more sequences of not only the Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

families but also of the Bel/Pao, Ty1/Copia, and Caulimoviridae families. Based on this material we have performed
more and new analyses following the line traced by this
and the two other referees. We hope this referee will find
this new manuscript version improved and useful.
Reviewer comments
I have however some criticisms upon different points and
speculations made in this paper. The first problem can
seem trivial but I am really concerned by the fact that all
the article is based on another manuscript by the same
authors currently under submission in another journal. It
is completely unusual. Generally journals do not allow
reference to any publication unless it is at least accepted.
What if the other manuscript is never accepted? What if
reviewers point particular problems that would completely change the conclusions concerning the existence of
the protein markers? That would be a complete paradox. I
don't know what is the position of Biology Direct upon
such a problem, and in doubt I will assume the other submitted paper as accepted even if it is absolutely not satisfactory for me.
Authors' response
In this regard, we think that the policy of Biology Direct is
similar to that of other journals (on the basis of our experience with this journal). Our aim when submitting the
first version of this manuscript to Biology Direct was just
in order to have it reviewed in advance, but we were aware
that we should/must wait regarding this publication until
having the first manuscript published (currently available
under the following citation [16]).
Reviewer comments
In the introduction, the authors present the different families of Retroviridae (alpha, beta etc.), and the different
classes I, II, III. I think that a clearer explanation about the
relationship between the two classifications and also
where the Ty3/gypsy are positioned in this system would
greatly help readers that are not familiar with such classification. About classification, a reminder of what contains
the Ty3/gypsy group seems essential (with a table for
example) and would facilitate the comprehension of
some parts in the paper. For example, p5 in introduction,
it is said that GANG architecture of class I is similar to several Ty3/gypsy and that GIGG of class II is similar to Ty3/
gypsy lineages like micropia/mdg3 and others. That
means that we find the signature of the two classes in different members of Ty3/gypsy. Maybe you should use the
term metaviridae to name the global group Ty3/gypsy to
avoid confusion? I would also point out that chromoviruses are classified as members of the Ty3/gypsy group
(Gorinsek et al. 2004). The references of "phyla", "sample", "lineage", "clade" are also confusing. The authors
should homogenize the paper on that point.

Authors' response
The text in the section "Background" referred by this
reviewer has been moved to "Results" where we make a
description of all used evolutionary markers. The new
manuscript version presents new phylogenetic and network analyses. In particular, we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of all families based on the pol
polyprotein (see methods). In this new version, we deal
with a non-redundant set of 268 sequences belonging to
the five aforementioned families, many of which are
introduced for the first time in this manuscript (see Table
1). This new manuscript version also presents and discusses a phylogeny for each family and other based on all
LTR retroelements (provided in Additional file 1). This
will help the readers have a perspective on the multiple
distinct phylogenetic patterns in the LTR retroelement system, which in turn helps in clarifying why the different
markers are lineage-specific within families or redundant
among families. This is the network basis, which as this
referee indicates means that we find two or more states of
the same signature in different lineages of the Ty3/Gypsy
family and all other investigated families. Regarding chromoviruses, in the previous manuscript version we did not
intend to separate this branch from the Ty3/Gypsy family.
We apologize if such a perspective was implied in any
way. In fact, previous to the approach of Gorinsek et al.
cited by the referee and the corresponding author,
together with other researcher (Dr. Marin), described
chromoviruses as Metaviridae Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons [28]. Before, Wright et al. had originally described
chromoviruses as a Ty3/Gypsy class [79] and later, shortly
before Marin and Llorens work, Malik and Eickbush
described the chromodomain at INT of these Ty3/Gypsy
LTR retrotransposons [4]. The contribution of Gorinsek
and Kordis et al. in [63] was important and overdue as
they showed (among other pieces of evidence) that chromoviruses are the most ancient branch of Ty3/Gypsy LTR
retroelements (an important evolutionary perspective
supporting this paper). Anyway, we have rewritten the
manuscript to clarify that chromoviruses are Ty3/Gypsy
LTR retroelements. It is difficult however to refer chromoviruses simply as Metaviridae elements because, as we
show, they constitute the largest phylogenetic branch in
the Ty3/Gypsy family, while the remaining Ty3/Gypsy retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons (including the Errantiviridae) fall in another branch. Of course, chromoviruses
are Metaviridae Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons, but perhaps what the current LTR retroelement classification
needs is more taxonomical levels such as groups, orders,
families, classes, genus, clades, etc. The establishment of
these levels is a daunting task because they should be concomitant with 1) the phylogenetic patterns of each family;
2) the diversity patterns common to all families, which in
turn are polyphyletic. We think that the network shown in
this paper may help in this regard. However, meanwhile

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

the current Metaviridae classification is discussed, we
would appreciate if this kind reviewer would allow us to
simply describe chromoviruses as Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons in order to avoid higher confusions (note for
instance that the Errantiviridae are Ty3/Gypsy elements, but
they are not Metaviridae elements). Finally, the three
classes pointed by the reviewer are specific in the classification of Retroviridae retroviruses. This means that no Ty3/
Gypsy lineage has place (to date) in such a classification
(see [16,35] and references therein). As suggested by this
reviewer, we have rewritten the manuscript to avoid confusion within and between LTR retroelement families and
between these and the eukaryotic taxonomies. We use the
terms "genus" and "class" when referring to retroviruses
and viruses such as Retroviridae and Caulimoviridae according to ICTV and most recent taxonomical approaches (see
[16,35] and references therein); we use the terms "genus"
and "clade" to describe the Ty3/Gypsy, the Bel/Pao and the
Ty1/Copia lineages supported by bootstrap, which are in
agreement to current ICTV classification or are commonly
accepted in the field; and use the term "branch" for
describing (with just descriptive purposes) the deep clustering elucidated in this study regarding the Ty1/Copia, the
Ty3/Gypsy, and the Bel/Pao LTR retroelements. We hope
this expert will find now the topic cleaner and clearer for
any reader and the manuscript straightforward.
Reviewer comments
The material and methods part is not clear. You don't
need to present all the content of the GyDB database as
there is already a publication on it. It would be better to
know exactly what element you have analyzed from
which species.
Authors' response
Done, we have re-written the whole manuscript, but we
took particular care in to remove all references to the
GyDB except when it is strictly necessary (citation, URLs,
etc). The new manuscript version includes an inferred
phylogeny of all sequences used (Additional file 1) with
information of the names, hosts, and Genbank accessions
of all sequences. The file is provided in html format so any
reader can directly access more information and/or the
Genbank accession of each sequence by clicking its name
or acronym in Additional file 1.
Reviewer comments
The authors propose to compute an index variability for
each element based on the different possible combinations of signatures. The results are shown on table 1. It is
probably an interesting way to have a rapid look at the
diversity present in species. The trouble is that the authors
never really refer to this table and they don't either explain
what they are expecting from the values. Especially how
the H value is supposed to vary? I don't really see the point

Page 26 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:41

of computing this index as it is almost not interpreted and
used in the paper.
Authors' response
In the new manuscript version of this work, the index H is
redundant over the set of different network analyses performed and was removed from this particular issue. See
also our response to Reviewer 2. In particular, network
analyses shown in Additional file, 3B-C present similar
perspectives than the previous index H but in turn they are
more informative and presented in a more elegant way.
Reviewer comments
A particular assumption is made concerning the observations of the authors and a theory emitted by E. Koonin
concerning evolution. I think this is a clear over statement.
First of all, the observations made by the authors cannot
be taken as proof that each increase in diversity is coincident with major biological transitions (as stated p22 in
discussion). There are no time scales and too many missing data concerning the representation of species and elements to allow such conclusion. Concerning the adequacy
with the theory of Koonin, this is also quite speculative.
Again, the scales are not the same. Transposable elements
and viruses are known to be able to quickly evolve by gene
acquisition and genome recombination between elements. When a new element is formed it does not mean
that a new host species is born. Even if in some case, the
link between mobile elements and speciation is possible,
I encourage the authors to be more prudent with their
conclusions.
Authors' response
Done, we toned down the speculation and refer only the
Koonin's model where it is strictly necessary. It would be
interesting to highlight that while the scales are different
we describe a similar evolutionary means at the molecular
level. The evolutionary principle is invariant and while
several points of the Koonin's model might be debated
(for instance, are the evolutionary phases of Koonin's
model really fast and lower steps or they are simply transitions?) our study gives support to the notion of an inflationary mode of evolution. This is exactly the perspective
derived from Figure 3, which is an evolutionary map
based on the diversity and distribution of LTR retroelements in eukaryotes. We therefore think that our study
gives support to the commonly assumed notion that
viruses and mobile genetic elements are evolutionary
indicators of the evolutionary history of their hosts and
vice versa. In the previous manuscript, our interpretation
when relating the evolutionary history of LTR retroelement with that of eukaryotes was in order to point the role
of mobile genetic elements as evolutionary vectors in the
evolution of eukaryotes towards the complexity (as suggested in [1] and other studies), not that the origin of a

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

new LTR retroelement lineage will raise to the born of a
new biological species. To clarify this whole framework
we have carefully rewritten the manuscript, where we have
toned down the speculation and aged the different LTR
retroelement host distributions, according to prior molecular estimations and data derived from the fossil record.
We hope this expert will find now this scenario better presented and supported by previous research.
Reviewer comments
The authors propose the hypothesis of the 3 kings as originators of Retroviridae and Ty3/gypsy elements. But they
temper their position in the discussion p26 saying that
there could be more than three classes. They also propose
that adding the endogenous retroviruses could possibly
change this view. The thing I don't understand is why not
having added endogenous retroviruses in this analysis. I
don't think that a particular analysis dedicated to these
elements makes sense. Moreover, I am wondering if the
observed diversity mainly in vertebrates concerning Retroviridae is not biased by different effects like a bias in species sequencing. It seems that the high diversity observed
in deuterostomia is mainly due to the retroviruses. I am
not convinced that there are less diversity in arthropods or
even in plants. You can also imagine that other viruses
have been more successful in plants for example that are
not represented here because they are not member of the
retrovirus classes.
Authors' response
The main focus of this research is the network history of
not only the Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae families but also in
all other LTR retroelements and caulimoviruses. Again, we
apologize for the way we prepared the first manuscript
version, where the Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae families
seemed the main focus of research. The Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae network and the three kings hypothesis were
published in [16]. In this paper these are the starting conditions that activated the study. To clarify this, we have
entitled the manuscript with a more appropriate title.
Regarding the question addressed by this reviewer, the
new manuscript version collects both "Results and Discussion" in a single section. Here, we test the three kings
hypothesis in diverse manners (see also our answer to Referee 2) but the main manuscript focus is the network principle. In fact, the most precise way to investigate the Ty3/
Gypsy and Retroviridae network is by studying it based on
all LTR retroelement families known to date. On the other
hand, the three kings hypothesis does not argue that all
Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements evolve from
three common ancestors but that the three Retroviridae
classes delineate Ty3/Gypsy ancestors in the evolutionary
history of Retroviridae retroviruses. This sounds similar but
it is not the same. The three kings hypothesis neither proposes that Class 1 directly evolves from Athila/Tat ele-

ments, nor Classes 2 and 3 evolve from Micropia/Mdg3
clade and errantiviruses, but that all of them evolve from
a common ancient poly- or paraphyletic scenario with different times of emergence. Our study (in both versions)
includes a number of endogenous Retroviridae retroviruses. In particular, the two Retroviridae genera - gammaretrovirus and betaretrovirus - are rich in both
endogenous and exogenous retroviruses (for more information in this topic see also [35]), so we certainly implement a wide number of Retroviridae endogenous
retroviruses in our study. There is not a significant bias for
the different Retroviridae species used. This can be seen in
Additional file 1 and in Figure 3, which show how the
multiple distinct Retroviridae sequences we evaluate cover
a wide host range, from fishes, amphibians, reptiles and
mammals. The range covered by this framework has sufficient information to perform hypotheses and conclusions
because this is what the post-genomic era suggests at this
point. As this reviewer has interestingly pointed out, the
different gaps in this biological history, which are derived
from bias in the availability of sequenced genomes, will
calibrate this map in the future. However, this is not a bias
inherent in the corpus of available data. Our study is a first
step of current and further research value, and in agreement with previous arguments [38], "surveillance for
emerging diseases should extend to sampling and characterization of the entire panoply of viruses, which are circulating not only in people but also in animals" (and all
other organisms). Obviously, we temper our position
regarding the three kings hypothesis because further
sequencing projects might reveal in the future that the
diversity of Retroviridae retroviruses needs more genera
and taxonomical classes to be explained. However, if this
occurs, it will not be due to a biased hypothesis, but due
to an update based on more and better information. This
will not change the fact that while Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, and
Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements spread in both protostomes
and deuterostomes, the Retroviridae are only distributed
among diverse deuterostomes. This by itself shows that
the diversity of LTR retroelements in deuterostomes is
greater than that of protostomes and plants, even if we
include caulimoviruses of plants (as we have done) in the
study. The known to date genomes of plants and fungi,
show only Ty3/Gypsy and Ty1/Copia elements and it is difficult to think that further sequencing data will change
this scenario. Moreover, this study includes caulimoviruses because of their retroelement-like gag-pol component close in similarity to the Ty3/Gypsy family. While
caulimoviruses stay in a separate system of classification
because they are DNA viruses, their diversity based on
evolutionary markers in their gag-pol component is lower
than that of Retroviridae retroviruses. At this point, it is
important to highlight that this study focuses only on LTR
retroelement s (we included caulimoviruses because they
evolve from this system). However, we do not known if

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/41

plants, fungi, protostomes and deuterostomes are more or
less diverse in other types of RNA or DNA viruses and
mobile genetic elements because the topic addressed in
this study is only the particular system of LTR retroelements and related caulimoviruses.
Reviewer's comment to the revised manuscript
I have read the new manuscript and the responses made
by the authors. They have indeed made a lot of modifications that make the manuscript very interesting and much
more clear than the first version. I don't see any new comments and I think the article can be published.
