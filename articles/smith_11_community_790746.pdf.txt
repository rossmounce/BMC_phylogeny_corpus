Abstract
Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in newborn
neonates. Bacteria are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of NEC but bacterial characterization has only
been done on human faecal samples and experimental animal studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the
microbial composition and the relative number of bacteria in inflamed intestinal tissue surgically removed from
neonates diagnosed with NEC (n = 24). The bacterial populations in the specimens were characterized by laser
capture microdissection and subsequent sequencing combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), using
bacterial rRNA-targeting oligonucleotide probes.
Results: Bacteria were detected in 22 of the 24 specimens, 71% had moderate to high densities of bacteria.
The phyla detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were: Proteobacteria (49.0%), Firmicutes (30.4%),
Actinobacteria (17.1%) and Bacteroidetes (3.6%). A major detected class of the phylum Proteobacteria belonged
to δ-proteobacteria. Surprisingly, Clostridium species were only detected in 4 of the specimens by FISH, but
two of these specimens exhibited histological pneumatosis intestinalis and both specimens had a moderate
to a high density of C. butyricum and C. parputrificum detected by using species specific FISH probes. A 16S
rRNA gene sequence tag similar to Ralstonia species was detected in most of the neonatal tissues and
members of this genus have been reported to be opportunistic pathogens but their role in NEC has still to
be clarified.
Conclusion: In this study, in situ identification and community analysis of bacteria found in tissue specimens from
neonates with NEC, were analysed for the first time. Although a large variability of bacteria was found in most of
the analyzed specimens, no single or combination of known potential pathogenic bacteria species was dominating
the samples suggestive NEC as non-infectious syndrome. However there was a significant correlation between the
presence of C. butyricum &C. parputrificum and histological pneumatosis intestinalis. Finally this study emphasizes
the possibility to examine the microbial composition directly on excised human tissues to avoid biases from faecal
samples or culturing.

Background
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acute inflammatory disease that affect the intestinal tract of neonates
[1]. It remains one of the most common gastrointestinal
emergencies in newborn neonates [2]. Onset of NEC
occurs within the first three months of life and neonates
who are of low birth weight and under 28 week gestation are the most susceptible [3]. The ileum and the
proximal colon are the frequently affected although any
segments of the gastrointestinal tract can be involved
[4]. The course of NEC is multifactorial and the most
important elements is prematurity, enteral feeding, bacterial colonization and an inappropriate pro-inflammatory response [5]. It is believed that immaturities of
these functions due to age predispose the premature
infant to intestinal injury and inappropriate responses to
injury.
The bacterial role in NEC still needs to be clarified.
Suggestions such as an imbalance of the gastrointestinal
microbiota, overgrowth of potential pathogenic bacteria,
and ischemia causing mucosal lesions that gives the bacteria systemic access have been followed but so far no
specific pathogens have been identified. Correlation of
NEC with bacteria has been suggested by analysing faecal samples, however, this analysis of faecal samples is
often far from the affected site and may not be representative [5-11]. The use of formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissue samples give an opportunity to investigate a unique stock of archival disease-specific material.
The method is challenged to access the limited and fragmented bacterial DNA present in the tissue. To characterize the bacterial population in the formalin-fixed
NEC tissue laser-capture-micro-dissection (LCM) combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),
using a bacteria ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-targeting

oligonucleotide probe, was used [12]. The bacterial 16S
rRNA gene was PCR amplified and sequenced by pyrosequencing. The bacterial distribution was verified and
visualized within the lumen and mucus of the intestinal
tissues with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with
group and species specific probes targeting individual
microbial cells (Table 1). The aim of this study was to
investigate the microbial composition and the relative
number of bacteria in affected intestinal tissue samples
surgically removed from neonates diagnosed with NEC
and to relate this with the patient data such as antibiotic
treatment.

Result
Twenty-four neonates with different gestational age
were enrolled in this study because they all had intestinal tissues surgically removed. Sections from the small
intestine were removed in 15 neonates, from both the
small intestine and the large intestine for 6 neonates,
and only from the large intestine in 3 neonates. Eight of
the 24 neonates died but there was no correlation
between NEC-score and death. All data have been
described in Table 2, but in summary three neonates
were full-term; two of these had heart disease and one
foeto-maternal bleeding. Three neonates were small for
gestation. Nine neonates had pneumatosis intestinalis
and 11 neonates had free air in the stomach as observed
by x-ray. For 21 of the neonates information regarding
enteral feeding was available. Mothers’ breast milk or
bank milk was introduced between day 1 and day 5, and
supported with either 5% or 10% glucose. If the neonate
was not able to reach the level of enteral feeding after
day 5, support by paraenteral nutrition was initiated;
median 8 day SD 8.9 (n = 13). All neonates were treated
with antibiotics for different time spans before the

surgery (Table 3). The standard treatment for children
<7 days was i.v. injection of ampicillin, gentamicin and
metronidazole; standard treatment for children >7 days
was i.v. injection of cefuroxim, gentamicin and metronidazole. The antibiotic treatment will influence the general bacterial colonization but to the best of our
knowledge there is no study about how it influences the
bacterial composition and load of the NEC affected
intestinal tissues in humans.
Detection of bacteria in tissue samples by fluorescent in
situ hybridization (FISH)

Bacteria were detected in 22 of the 24 examined specimens, and of these 71% had a moderate to a high density of bacteria (Table 3). In 17 (70%) of the 24
specimens Enterobacterieceae were detected by a group
specific FISH probe (Figure 1a) and a significant correlation was seen between this hybridization and the general
bacterial probe based on the scoring system (p = 0.02).

In 4 specimens Clostridium species were detected by
using a mixed Clostridium spp. probe targeting C. perfringens, C. difficile, C. butyricum and C. paraputrificum.
Two of those specimens were by histological examinations observed to exhibit pneumatosis intestinalis and a
significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found with the
presence of the Clostridium spp even though the sample
numbers are very small. In these two specimens C.
butyricum and C. parputrificum were detected in high
densities (Figure 1c), C. perfringens was detected in one
of the specimens (figure 1d) whereas C. difficile was not
detected in any of the slides. Nevertheless, no correlation was found between diagnosed neonates with pneumatosis intestinalis by x-rays and the specimens
colonised with Clostridium spp. Finally, there was no
correlation between the presence of bacteria by FISH
and NEC score, type of nutrition, antibiotic usage, or
death.
Characterisation of bacterial composition in tissues
removed surgically from neonates with NEC

Eight neonates were selected for further characterisation
of the bacteria located in the lumen and mucus layer of
the inflamed tissues. Four of these neonates had
received antibiotics for less than two days while the
other four neonates had received antibiotics more than
10 days. A 16S rRNA gene library from each specimen
was constructed. The individual tags (N = 364) were
assigned to the closest mono-Phylogenetic group in
order to obtain a Phylogenetic classification. In total, 41
consensus tags were identified (Table 4). The frequencies of 16S rRNA gene sequences from all specimens
were grouped according to their overall phylogeny and
the phyla were Proteobacteria (49.0%), Firmicutes
(30.4%), Actinobacteria (17.1%) and Bacteroidetes (3.6%)
(Figure 2). δ-proteobacteria was the major detected class
of the phylum Proteobacteria. The Shannon diversity
index was calculated based on the total library cloning
sequences for each neonate (Figure 3). The Shannon
diversity index revealed two distinct groups. The neonates p3, p6, p17 and p24 clustered together with a low
Shannon diversity index and were dominated by more
than 50% of one genera of either Escherichia spp. or
Enterococcus spp. In neonate p8, p20, p22 and p27, multiple bacterial genera were present with no single genus
contributing with more than 30% of total bacteria
(Figure 3). The differences in diversity could not be
explained or correlated to clinical characteristics like
NEC score, number of days with antibiotics, time of surgery, or gestational age.
The bacteria associated with the tissue in the individually neonates have the potential to reveal bacterial
pathogens related to the pathogenesis of NEC. In the δproteobacteria group Escherichia/Shigella genera

dominated with a frequency of 45% out of all δ-proteobacteria and were present in 5 of the 8 neonates with
an average frequency of 24% (±36%). The Enterobacteriaceae group consisted of virtually one tag but it was
similar to genera of Citrobacter, Enterobacter (Klebsiella) and Erwinia and was detected in 4 of the neonates. The taxonomic class Clostridia contained 10
different tags belonging to a variety of different genera
(Table 4), the two most prominent being Clostridium
and Anaerococcus detected in four and three neonates,
respectively. A tag matching the potential pathogen
Finegoldia was found twice in two different neonates.
One of the specimen characterised histologically exhibiting pneumatosis intestinalis was also observed to
include the genus Clostridium. The most prevalent tag
belonged to Ralstonia being present in 7 out of 8 neonates, with an average of 9% (±5%). R. detusculanense,
R. pickettii and R. insidiosa were revealed with more
than 99% similarity (Figure 4).

Discussion
The establishment of the microbiota early in life and the
symbiosis with the human gastrointestinal tract has
important consequences for human health and physiology. The interactions can have beneficial nutritional,
immunological, and developmental effect or even pathogenic effects for the host [13-16]. In this study the bacterial composition has been characterised for the first
time directly on tissue samples from neonates with fulminate NEC. The specimens were collected from a single neonatal hospital unit with a consistent treatment
and a similar environment over a period of 6 years.
Even though, the study is naturally limited in number of
patients this is the first description done in situ and not
on surrogates in the form of faecal samples or experimental animals. FISH combined with laser capture
microdissection ensured that only bacterial DNA from
lumen and mucus was sampled and that no contaminations from the surrounding material or environment

could occur. Furthermore, cloning and pyrosequencing
used here has previously been shown to be efficient for
the characterization of the intestinal microbiota [17-19].
The presence of bacterial colonization in the small
intestine and large intestine was documented and visualized by a general bacterial FISH probe and this method
has previously been used to reveal bacterial spatial distribution in the intestine of experimentally colonised
animals [20,21]. In general, tissues with disease were
heavily colonised by bacteria but we could not correlate
the bacterial colonisation to NEC-score, days with

antibiotics or type of antibiotics nor type of nutrition.
This colonization might be because of resistance to or
wrong choice of antibiotics or because the antibiotics do
not reaches the bacteria because of stop of blood supply.
It has recently been shown that antibiotics do not clear
gut microbiota in neonates but reduce the diversity of
bacterial species [22]. We were therefore interested in
finding which bacterial groups that colonized the surgical removed tissues.
The dominance of Proteobacteria could explain the

Figure 3 Overview and diversity of the bacterial composition by clone library analysis. a) Shannon’s diversity index on phylum level
divided the NEC infants in two groups. This difference could not be explained by antibiotic treatments or the severity of the necrotizing
enterocolitis b) The bacterial 16S rRNA gene composition from each of the eight necrotic intestinal tissue samples. Bacterial groups whose
abundance were more than 10% in any sample are shown as bars. Enterococcus and Escherichia spp. were the most abundant in the samples
with a low Shannon diversity index where Ralstonia sp. was the most frequent group of species in the samples with a high Shannon index.

of the antibiotic treatments that all neonates received in
this study. From the 16S rRNA gene library the δ-proteobacteria was dominated by Escherichia-like organisms
and to a lesser extent with Enterobacteria. It has previously been described by Wang et al. [18] that δ-proteobacteria dominated the bacterial composition in
faecal samples from neonates with NEC but they also
found a lower Shannon diversity for NEC patients compared to the control group [18]. This could have been
due to the antibiotic treatments. In this study there was
no difference in the bacterial composition or Shannon
diversity index after long term antibiotic administration
(>10 days) compared to less than two days of antibiotic
treatments. Furthermore, no difference in bacterial composition was found regardless of the type of antibiotics
used for treatment, in contrast to the antibiotic selection
seen by Gewolb et al. [23]. In general, a very high variation was observed in the bacterial composition of the
specimens as well as different diversity indexes and if it
had been possible to analyse more samples it would perhaps had been possible to correlate the different variables with the colonization. The colonization of the
preterm intestine could have been speculated to be very
homogeneous since the neonates were at the same hospital unit (environment) even though Palmer et al., [17]
showed that the composition and temporal patterns of
the microbial communities in stool samples from term
babies varied widely from baby to baby for their first
year of life. However the composition of the intestinal
microbiota in healthy pre- or term neonates present in
the small intestine is not yet known due to the lack of
samples [17,18,24,25].
Previous studies based on culture techniques have
focused on single organisms as predisposing for NEC
[7,26,27]. Clostridium spp. and especially C. perfringens
due to the fermentation of carbonhydrate substrates to
hydrogen gas has been suspected [3,6,9]. Very few neonates were colonised with Clostridium spp. in this study
but there was a significant correlation between a positive
signal from the probes for Clostridium spp and pneumatosis intestinalis as verified by histopathology. It was
specified that this Clostridium colonization was due to
C. butyricum and C. parputrificum. A previous study
has shown that these two lactose fermenting clostridium
species can induce cecal NEC-like lesions in a gnotobiotic quail model and these lesions may be linked to
short-chain fatty acid production [28]. There was no
correlation with pneumatosis intestinalis found by X-ray
and Clostridium spp. and maybe pneumatosis intestinalis
described on X-ray is different from the pneumatosis
intestinalis described on tissue surgically removed. It
seems therefore like C. butyricum and C. parputrificum
are responsible for pneumatosis intestinalis when verified by histopathology, but because of the low frequency

Page 8 of 12

of Clostridium spp in our samples we believe that the
pneumatosis intestinalis is a secondary effect of NEC
and that these Clostridia are not the primary pathogens
of NEC.
Ralstonia and Propionibacteria were detected in most
of the specimens where laser capture microdissection
was used. Ralstonia spp. is a new genus including former members of Burkholderia spp. (Burkholderia picketti and Burkholderia solanacearum). Burkholderia spp.
has been described in children suffering of NEC [29]
and Ralstonia picketti has been reported to be a persistent Gram-negative nosocomial infectious organism
[30]. R. picketti can cause harmful infections and is
mainly considered as an opportunistic pathogen of little
clinical significance but R. pickettii isolates have been
reported to be resistant or had decreased susceptibility
to aminopenicillins, ureidopenicillins, restricted-spectrum cephalosporins, ceftazidime, and aztreonam [31].
The major conditions associated with R. picketti infection are bacteraemia/septicaemia and respiratory infections/pneumonia. The bacteria has been isolated from
patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and cystic fibrosis from multiple sides including sputum, blood, wound
infections, urine, ear swabs and nose swabs, and cerebrospinal fluid [30,32,33]. Diversity in an ecosystem is
important in establishing and preventing dominance by
a single pathogenic species. In the samples with Ralstonia spp. there were a relatively high diversity of different
bacteria and if Ralstonia had had a primary effect we
would expect a higher dominance of Ralstonia and a
lower bacterial diversity. Therefore, we cannot conclude
from this study whether Ralstonia has any effects, on
the development of NEC and further studies have to
elucidate this or/and if Ralstonia sp. was present because
of a higher resistance to the antibiotic treatment.
Propionibacterium spp. have previously been described
in faecal specimens [17,34]. The presence of this genus
has been reported to be the second largest on the adult
body and predominant in sebaceous sites [35]; it has
probably been found in neonates’ small intestine
because of skin contact between the mother and the
neonate. The reason why it has not been found in
higher densities in many other gastrointestinal studies of
the microbiota is a general underestimation of Actinobacteria created by the choice of primers and a dilution
effect in faeces [17].

Conclusion
This study emphasized the possibility to examine the
microbial composition directly on excised human tissues
to avoid biases from faecal samples or culturing.
Although a large variability of bacteria was found in
most of the analyzed specimens, no single or combination of known potential pathogenic bacterial species was

Smith et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/73

dominating the samples suggestive NEC as non-infectious syndrome. However there was a general high presence of Proteobacteria and Ralstonia sp. which may be
due to the antibiotic treatment that all neonates received
in this study and a significant correlation between the
finding of C. butyricum &C. paraputrificum and the few
histological pneumatosis intestinalis found in this study.

Methods
Patient characteristics and sample collection

The study was done retrospectively on neonates with
NEC hospitalised from January 2001 to December 2005.
All neonates were hospitalised at a single level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Rigshospitalet,
Copenhagen, Denmark. All neonates had surgical intervention and samples of removed tissue were formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded at the Department of
Pathology, Rigshospitalet. The study was subjected to
ethical review and approved by the Ethical Committee
for Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, Denmark (KF 01
268923). Patient’s records were reviewed in order to
characterise the clinical findings, disease progression
and clinical outcome. The data gathered from each
infant were: gestational age, weight at birth, onset of
symptoms, feeding prior to onset of NEC, antibiotic
usage prior to operation of NEC, and outcome.
NEC disease evaluation (NEC-score)

Unfortunately, there is no standard pathological characterization of NEC. We decided to characterize the tissue
macroscopic from the characterization made by the
pathology that originally looked at the tissue and histologically after haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. All
histologically samples were independently evaluated by
two trained pathologists; at the Department of Pathology, Rigshospitalet and at The National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark.
Macroscopic evaluation

Perforation was noted not scored, hemorrhagic mucosa
+/- necrotic areas, score 5, pneumatosis intestinal score
5. Amount of tissue <10 cm score 1, 10-30 cm score 2,
>30 cm score 3.
Histology evaluation

The formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples were
sectioned 3 μm, mounted on slides and stained with
HE. The HE slides were graded as follows: (A) Necroses
volving; a) luminal epithelia, b) whole mucosa, c) submucosa, d) tunica muscularis; (B) Vascularity; a)
oedema, b) bleeding, c) micro-thrombing, d) haemosiderine, (C) Inflammation; a) unspecific (granulocytes), b)
eosinophils, c) vasculitis, d) pseudomembranes, e) granulation tissue, f) granulomas, g) granulomas, h) fibrosis,
i) atrophy 1)mucosa 2) all other layers; e) and f) was not
included in the score but used to graduate the tissue in

acute or chronic NEC. (D) Various, 1) ganglion cells 2)
non-ganglion cells. All histopathological characteristics
were scored one except (D) that was used to distinguish
NEC from Hirschsprung’s disease. The NEC-score score
is the addition of the macroscopic evaluation and the
histology evaluation
Bacterial detection by 16S rRNA in situ Hybridization on
Formalin-Fixed Tissue Sections

Paraffin was removed of the tissue sections with xylene
and dehydrated in 96% ethanol for 30 min. All specimens were hybridized with both a general bacterial
probe EUB338 and with selective probes. Probes were
synthesized at Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany) and described in Table 1. Two probes (S-S-C.
paraputri-181 and S-S-C. butyricum-663) were designed
in ARB http://www.arb-silva.de in this study. The probes
were approved for their specificity to closest bacterial
type strains by an in silico probe search in RDP release
10 http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/, and experimental verified
for signal intensities and specificity by FISH targeting
pure culture of C. butyricum CCUG4217T; C. paraputrificum CCUG32755T; C. difficile ATTC17857 and C. perfringens NCTC8449 injected into a piece of pig lung
treated as the rest of the tissue samples.
Hybridization was done in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (100 nM Tris, pH 7.2. 0.9 M NaCl, 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulphate) added 100 ng of probe at 45°C for 16
h in a humidified chamber. Slides were washed in 100
ml of preheated (37°C) hybridization buffer for 15 min
and subsequently in 10 ml of preheated (37°C) washing
solution (100 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 0.9 M NaCl) for 15 min.
Slides were rinsed in water and air-dried. All slides were
scored as follows: 0) no or low density of bacteria, 1)
moderate density of bacteria, 2) high density of bacteria.
NEC tissues used for Laser Capture Micro dissection

Eight intestinal tissue samples were included. The
microdissection was performed on tissues excised from
4 neonates that were treated with antibiotics less than 2
days and from 4 neonates treated with antibiotics 10
days or more before surgery. Three μm sections of the
tissues were cut (knife was changed between cuts) and
mounted on the 0.17-mm PALM ® POL-membrane
slides (P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies AG, Bernried,
Germany) and kept at 4°C until use. The slides were
hybridized with bacterial probes as previously described.
Laser Capture Microdissection

A PALM Robot-Microbeam system (P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies AG) consisting of an Axivert 200 M
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)
equipped for fluorescence with a 100-W Hg lamp, a
40x/1.30 oil Fluar objective (Carl Zeiss), filter set XF53

Smith et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/73

(Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT, USA) and the PALM
RoboSoftware version 1.2 (P.A.L.M Microlaser Technologies AG) was used. Bacteria were visualized by FISH
using the general bacterial probe EUB338 and dissected
from both the intestinal lumen and mucus of the surgical tissue by the cutting and catapulting function,
RoboLPC as previous described [12]. The micro-dissected area from the lumen and mucus associated tissues were never in contact with any external
contaminators because the micro-dissected area is cut
by a laser and “transported” to the tube by a photonic
force and against gravity as described by Carl Zeiss AG,
Deutschland http://www.zeiss.de/. The risk for external
contaminators is therefore minimal.
The catapulting material was collected in the cap of a
200 μl Thermo-Tube (ABgene, Epsom, UK) containing
20 μl proteinase K buffer. The microdissected material
was digested in proteinase K buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulphate, 1 U proteinase K) at 55°C for 72 h.
Subsequently, the proteinase K was inactivated at 95°C
for 15 min. Two μl of solution were subsequently used
as template for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Clone library and sequencing of intestinal bacteria

The primers Bact64f and Bact109r1 (Eurofins MWG
Operon ) were used for 16S rRNA gene amplification of
the hyper variable region V1 from the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (Table 1). PCRs (always including a non
template control) were done in 20 μl volumes containing
1 × PCR buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4) and 50 mM
KCl], 200 μM dNTP, 500 nM each primer, 3.3 mM MgCl,
and 1 U of Pfu DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA), which creates blunt end fragments. The
thermal profiles were as follows: an initial denaturation
step at 94°C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for
30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and a final elongation step at 72°C
for 5 min. The amplicons were purified by using phenol/
chloroform (P/C, pH 8.0), and the DNA was precipitated
with 2.5 M ammonium acetate in ethanol. After two
washes with 80% (v/v) ethanol, the DNA pellet was dried
and resuspended in 10 μl, 0.2 μl filtrated, double-distilled
water. Following the manufacturer’s descriptions the cloning was done by using a Zero blunt TOPO cloning kit
(Invitrogen Corporation). Fifty to hundred colonies from
each cloning were picked and sequenced by pyrosequencing. A PYROMark Q96 ID was used to short DNA
sequencing of the approximately 40-60 bp clone insert
using the recommended protocol (Biotage AB, Uppsala,
Sweden) as described previously using the primer PyroBact64f [19]. The sequences (tags) were imported into the
software BioNumerics 4.61 and manually checked, aligned
and filtered for high quality sequences. Sanger sequencing
with an Applied Biosystem 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Foster

Page 10 of 12

City, CA, USA) was used to check consensus tags for the
pyrosequencing accuracy. The Sequence match analysis
tool in the Ribosomal database project 10 http://rdp.cme.
msu.edu/ was used to assign the Phylogenetic position of
each consensus tag. The search criteria were for both type
and non-type strains, both environmental (uncultured)
sequences and isolates, near-full-length sequences (>1200
bases) of good quality. If there was a consensus at the
genus level the tag was assigned this taxonomic classification. If no such consensus was found, the classification
proceeded up one level to family and again if no taxonomic affiliation could be assigned the tag continued to be
proceeded up the tree as described by Huse et al., [36]. In
some cases it was not possible to assign a domain and
these sequences might represent new novel organisms or
the sequences might be biased, in these cases the tags
were excluded from the dataset. In total 364 sequences
were finally included in the alignment.
The phylogenetic analysis was done by downloading
16S rRNA gene sequences longer than 1,200 base pair
from the RDP database of the Ralstonia type strains
http://rdp.cme.msu.edu. The RDP alignment was used
and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the
Ward algorithm in the software Bionumerics. Burkholderia cepacia (GenBank accession no. AF097530) was
used as an out-group.
Statistics

The statistical analysis was done in two steps: First, the
association between one predictor at a time and the
NEC score was analysed by robust least squares methodology adjusting for gestational age. This is equivalent
to a normal linear GEE modal with working independence correlation structure on child level. For each predictor the estimated change in expected NEC score is
reported with Wald 95% confidence limits in parentheses. The overall association between the predictor and
the NEC score is evaluated by a robust score-test.
Second, we formulate a normal linear GEE model
including gestational age and all predictors with a robust
score-test p-value below 0.1 in the above analyse. This
multivariable model is then reduced by backwards elimination using 0.05 as a cut-off level.
All analyses were performed using PROC GENMOD
in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
