Abstract
Background: The Beijing genotype of M. tuberculosis is a virulent strain that is disseminating worldwide and has a
strong association with drug resistance. In the Western Cape of South Africa, epidemiological studies have
identified the R220 cluster of the Beijing genotype as a major contributor to a recent outbreak of drug-resistant
tuberculosis. Although the outbreak is considered to be due to clonal transmission, the relationship among drug
resistant isolates has not yet been established.
Results: To better understand the evolution of drug resistance among these strains, 14 drug-resistant clinical
isolates of the Beijing genotype were sequenced by whole-genome sequencing, including eight from R220 and six
from a more ancestral Beijing cluster, R86, for comparison. While each cluster shares a distinct resistance mutation
for isoniazid, mapping of other drug-resistance mutations onto a phylogenetic tree constructed from single
nucleotide polymorphisms shows that resistance mutations to many drugs have arisen multiple times
independently within each cluster of isolates. Thus, drug resistance among these isolates appears to be acquired,
not clonally derived. This observation suggests that, although the Beijing genotype as a whole might have
selective advantages enabling its rapid dissemination, the XDR isolates are relatively less fit and do not propagate
well. Although it has been hypothesized that the increased frequency of drug resistance in some Beijing lineages
might be caused by a mutator phenotype, no significant shift in synonymous substitution patterns is observed in
the genomes.
Conclusion: While MDR-TB is spreading by transmission in the Western Cape, our data suggests that further drug
resistance (i.e. XDR-TB) at this stage is acquired.

Background
The Beijing genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a
virulent strain that originated out of East Asia [1] and
has disseminated around the world [2,3]. It is a member
of principle genetic group 1 [4], bearing the markers
KatG 463Leu and GyrA 95Thr, and is characterized by
a spoligotype 000000000003771. Isolates of the Beijing
strain have been associated with decreased survival
times in mice [5-7] and in the rabbit meningitis model
[8], and increased growth rates in human macrophages
[9,10]. Some patients infected with Beijing genotype

show increased radiographic cavitation [11,12] and
experience more treatment failures, independent of differences in drug resistance [13]. One potential explanation for the increased virulence is the production of
phenolglycolipid (PGL), a surface antigen that
suppresses the Th1 response [14]. PGL is produced in
Beijing strains, but is not produced by members of the
other principle genetic groups (2 and 3), such as
M. tuberculosis H37Rv, because the polyketide synthase
pks15/1 has a frameshift mutation splitting it into two
separate open reading frames (ORFs) [15].
The Beijing genotype is strongly associated with drug
resistance [16], including multi-drug resistance (MDRTB) and extensive-drug resistance (XDR-TB). One
of the first outbreaks of MDR-TB, which occurred in

New York City in the early 1990’s, was found to be a clonal
expansion of a variant of the W-Beijing strain [17,18]. The
Beijing strain was also associated with an outbreak in
Azerbaijan prisons, where nearly all TB infections were
Beijing, and >50% were MDR [19]. The Beijing genotype
has been reported to account for 34% of the XDR cases
across South Africa [20]. Similar findings of increased
association of drug resistance with strains of the Beijing
genotype have been reported in India [21], Russia [22],
Korea [23], Vietnam [24], Japan [25], and Germany [26]. In
a large-scale study that included both civilians and prison
inmates in Russia, 67% of the TB infections were Beijing,
but the frequency of resistance to drugs like isoniazid,
rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol was nearly twice
as high among Beijing as non-Beijing isolates [11]. Although
these studies were performed in different populations using
varying methodologies, taken together, they support the
general view that infections with the Beijing strain are more
likely to be drug resistant than other strains of TB.
Currently, the Beijing strain constitutes a significant
component of a major outbreak of TB in the Western
Cape of South Africa, where it represents 36.5% of the
drug-resistant cases (in a sample between 2005 and
2006 [27]). The proportion of the Beijing genotype
among drug-resistant cases is inflated relative to
the overall proportion of Beijing strains among drugsusceptible TB cases in the region, which was estimated
at 21.9% in Cape Town (between 1993 and 2004) [28].
In another study of TB cases in the Western Cape
region between 2001 and 2002, 28% of drug-resistant
cases were of the Beijing genotype, whereas 17% of
cases overall were Beijing [29]. Epidemiological studies
suggest that the Beijing genotype is highly transmissible
(based on geographical clustering of individual strains
within households and communities [30]), leading to a
hypothesis that drug resistance is spreading clonally
through the region. However, the clonal expansion
hypothesis contrasts with most TB outbreaks, which are
often found to be constituted of a mixture of genotypes
[31]. In fact, drug resistant mutations often incur a relative fitness cost, making it more difficult for them to
compete [32]. van der Spuy et al. [28] found that the
increase in Beijing strains in Cape Town was primarily
due to drug-susceptible strains. Over a 12-year period,
the number of drug-susceptible Beijing isolates increased
exponentially with a doubling time of ~4 years, whereas
the frequency of most other genotypes, including drugresistant Beijing isolates, remained relatively constant.
This observation was taken to suggest that the success
of the Beijing strain is due overall to increased virulence
rather than transmissibility [28], and that drug-resistant
strains of Beijing were less fit that drug-susceptible Beijing strains. Thus the association of Beijing with drug-

Page 2 of 14

resistance could be a side-effect due to the increased
overall success of this strain.
The Beijing genotype family can be divided into seven
lineages, progressing from “ancestral” (sublineage 1) to
“modern” (sublineage 7). These distinctions are based
on comparison of IS6110 insertion sites, regions of deletion, and other markers [33]. Sublineage 7 is most prevalent in the Western Cape (72.6% in Cape Town
between 1993 and 2004), which, discounting founder
effects, is interpreted to mean that it has higher fitness
[33]. Some studies have suggested that different lineages
have different propensities to develop drug resistance.
For example, Mokrousov et al. [34] found that ancestral
lineages in China had a higher frequency of resistance
to rifampicin and pyrazinamide. However, these findings
were contradicted by a larger study of Beijing isolates in
South Africa that found no statistically significant difference in drug resistance among the seven lineages [33].
One particular sub-group of the Beijing family has
recently been identified, cluster R220 (based on IS6110
RFLP banding patterns), that is overrepresented among
drug-resistant isolates in the Western Cape of South
Africa [27]. R220 is a member of sublineage 6, representing a modern Beijing variant. R220 constituted over
75% of isolates of the Beijing clade in 2005-2006 in the
Western Cape, and accounted for 42% of the increase in
drug-resistant cases since 2001 [27]. R220 was also
found to be prevalent among children infected with
drug-resistant TB in the region [35]. Cluster R220
strains share the same c-15t inhA promoter mutation
responsible for resistance to isoniazid and many isolates
(nearly 75%) also have the Ser531Leu (TTG) rpoB conferring rifampicin resistance, suggesting that it has
evolved into a distinct MDR clone. If it were a distinct
clone, this might imply that it has acquired compensatory mutations that enable it to tolerate the fitness cost
associated with drug resistance mutations or enhance its
transmissibility in the population.
Although R220 is a well-defined cluster in terms of
spoligotyping and IS6110 RFLP fingerprinting, these are
still coarse-grained methods of genotyping and do not
guarantee that the drug-resistant isolates in this cluster
are clonally derived. In order to get a more fine-grained
picture of the R220 cluster, we performed whole-genome sequencing on eight drug-resistant isolates of R220
from various locations in the Western Cape of South
Africa. For comparison, we also sequenced HN878, a
drug-susceptible isolate from the US, and six drugresistant isolates of the R86 cluster, which is part of the
more ancestral sublineage 1. Using these whole-genome
sequences, we reconstruct a phylogenetic tree and map
drug-resistance mutations on them to examine the
hypothesis of clonality.

Methods
Selection of Strains for Sequencing

M. tuberculosis HN878 was obtained from the NIH TB
Vaccine Testing and Research Materials Laboratory at
Colorado State University. Fourteen additional drugresistant strains of the Beijing genotype were selected
for whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis.
The isolates were sampled from a database maintained
at the DST/NRF Centre, Stellenbosch University, representing drug resistant TB cases from a variety of hospitals in the Western Cape, South Africa (see Table 1).
The samples were all selected to be isoniazid-resistant,
and were chosen to span a range of degrees of drug
resistance, including cases that are mono-resistant (isoniazid), MDR (isoniazid and rifampicin), pre-XDR
(MDR plus resistance to either a fluoroquinolone or an
aminoglycoside), and XDR. No other biases (e.g. age,
gender, HIV status) were applied in the sampling. All 14
isolates have the Beijing spoligotype, 00000000003771.
Six of the isolates investigated in this study are from
sublineage 1, representing the atypical Beijing genotype
(ancestral, family F31). IS6110-RFLP analyses have classified these strains as being members of cluster R86.
The remaining 8 isolates are from cluster R220 in sublineage 6, which represents “typical” Beijing genotype
strains (more recently evolved). The IS6110 RFLP patterns used for determining cluster membership of these
isolates are shown in Figure 1.
Drug-Susceptibility Testing

Drug susceptibility testing for isoniazid (0.2 μg/ml),
rifampin (1 μg/ml), ethambutol (7.5 μg/ml), ethionamide
(20 μg/ml), amikacin (30 μg/ml) and ofloxacin (2 μg/ml)
was performed using the indirect proportion method on

Middlebrook’s medium [36]. Additional drug susceptibility testing was done using the proportion method on
Middelbrook’s 7H10 medium containing ofloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin at the critical concentration of 2 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml,
respectively.
DNA Preparation and Sequencing Reaction

Sequencing of the genomes of 15 Beijing strains of M.
tuberculosis was carried out on an Illumina Genome
Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.). In this study, Illumina
Paired-End sequencing method (PE) was used. The
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-lysozyme
method was used for extraction and purification of
genomic DNA [37]. Suitable genomic DNA samples for
the GAII were prepared as described on the sample preparation protocol (Illumina). 2-3 μg of genomic DNA

was used for sample preparation. Genomic DNA was
sheared by a nebulizer to generate DNA fragments for
the Illumina Paried-End Sequencing method. The specific oligonucleotides (Illumina adapters) designed for PE
sequencing were ligated to both ends of DNA fragments
with the TA cloning method. Adapter-ligated DNA fragments of length 350-400 bp were isolated from a 2%
agarose gel (Certified low-range Ultra Agarose, BIORAD) by using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN).
Then the fragments were amplified by PCR reaction to
generate the DNA library (15-30 ng/μl). The median
size of the library was estimated by examining the 2%
agarose gel image. The molarity of the DNA library was
estimated as described in the sample preparation protocol (Illumina). The DNA libraries (5 picomoles each),
including the jX174 control (bacteriophage DNA), were
loaded on the flow cell for the cluster generation and
sequencing. 79 cycles of images were collected, representing two 36-bp reads (paired ends) plus 7 bases
representing id tags for multiplexing. The images were
analyzed using version 1.4 of the GAPipeline software
supplied by Illumina, producing files with 10-20 million
pairs of 36 bp reads for each genome.
Sequence Determination and Bioinformatics

The reads were analyzed by comparative genome assembly to determine the complete sequence of each genome
using custom software developed in our lab. The reads
were first mapped (aligned) against the genome of
H37Rv as a reference sequence. The mapping of each
read was accomplished by ungapped alignment to the
reference genome (including the reverse complement
strand), allowing at most two mismatches out of 36
nucleotides. Initially, the reads that were pair-mates
were mapped independently; subsequently, locations of
reads for which the paired-end did not match within
300 bp were discarded. The mapped reads were used to
assemble a list of the nucleotides observed at each position within the reference genome contributed by all the
reads that overlapped it. Base calls were made by a maximum likelihood calculation, computed as the product
of the probabilities for each base at each position using
uncertainties estimated during image analysis. Sites
where apparent differences were observed were subjected to local contig-building, in order to determine
whether the difference was due to a nucleotide substitution or a small insertion or deletion.
For each genome, a list of verified differences was prepared and used to modify the reference genome to produce an intermediate (’edited’) genome. Then the
process was repeated by re-mapping the reads against
the edited genome, and re-calling nucleotides at each
position. For any sites that still had zero coverage, the
base from the reference strain was used. This primarily

Page 4 of 14

included regions with exceptionally high GC-content
(80-90%).
Large-scale deletions were identified by analyzing
paired-end data for reads whose paired-end maps an
unusually long distance away (i.e. >300 bp, compared to
average read length of ~200). Large-scale insertions
were determined by building contigs that spanned fragments, neither of whose paired ends mapped into the
H37Rv genome. These ~200 bp fragments were then
assembled into larger contigs using Newbler (software
from Roche, inc.), localized in the genome using pairedend information, and identified by performing BLAST
searches on the NCBI website.
Virtual spoligotyping was performed by aligning (without gaps) all the reads obtained for each strain against
each of the 43 spacer sequences (26-bp oligos) from the
direct repeats (DR) regions [38]. The number of matching reads for each spacer was counted, considering both
forward and reverse-complement sequences, and accepting up to 1 nucleotide mismatch. Spacers with 0
matches were interpreted as missing.
Whole-genome alignments of the Beijing sequences to
other mycobacterial strains were generated using MUMMER version 3.20 [39] to identify maximal stretches of
perfectly matching regions, selecting optimal order-preserving assignments of matches between the genomes
based on the longest increasing subsequence algorithm
[40], and then using in-house sequence-alignment tools
to determine alignments of the intervening regions with
mismatches and/or gaps.
The complete genome sequences for M. tuberculosis
strains HN878, R1207 (representative of R86 cluster),
and X122 (representative of R220 cluster) have been
deposited in GenBank with accession numbers
ADNF01000000, ADNH01000000, and ADNG01000000,
respectively.

Results
Whole-Genome Sequencing

In order to establish a complete genome sequence to
use as a reference for sequencing of other members of
the Beijing strain family, HN878 was chosen as a representative strain and the genome was sequenced using
Solexa sequencing technology. HN878 is a fully drugsusceptible member of the modern (typical) W-Beijing
family which was isolated in Houston, TX as part of a
TB outbreak in the 1990’s, and has been used as a reference strain in multiple studies to characterize virulence
and other properties of the Beijing strain [5,7,8]. HN878
was sequenced in paired-end mode using 36 bp reads.
Mapping of reads to unique spacer sequences in the
direct-repeats (DR) region confirms that HN878 has the
characteristic 000000000003771 spoligotype associated
with the Beijing strain family. The genome sequence of

Ioerger et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:670
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/670

M. tuberculosis H37Rv (NCBI accession: NC_000962)
was used as a reference sequence for comparative
assembly of the HN878 genome. The mean depth of
coverage was 70.8x, and 98.4% of the genome was covered by at least one read. The remaining uncovered
regions are primarily associated with the family of PGRS
genes, and are likely due to inefficient sequencing of
GC-rich regions. In HN878, 91.5% of sites with zero
coverage (60,454/66,065) were located in PGRS genes.
Among 1546 SNPs relative to H37Rv, 1296 occur in
protein-coding regions. Only 1063 of 3989 genes contain
a polymorphism of any type, and the remaining 73% of
the genes in the genome are identical with the sequence
in H37Rv. 75 genes contain frameshift mutations (see
Additional file 1, Table S1). No mutations typically associated with drug resistance were found in the following
genes, consistent with the pan-susceptible phenotype of
this clinical isolate: inhA, katG, ethA, gyrA, iniABC,
kasA, ndh, rpoB, rpsL, rrs, pncA, and embB. HN878 has
the katG R643L and gyrA S95T alleles, confirming its
membership in principle genetic group 1 [4]. Further
details on SNPs and indels in HN878 (Table S2) relative
to H37Rv, including IS6110 transpositions (Table S3)
are described in the Additional file 1.
Then the genomes of the 14 Beijing clinical isolates
from South Africa were sequenced in paired-end mode,
using HN878 as a reference sequence (Table 2). The
coverage ranged between 29x and 98x, and the completion was 98.5-99.4%.
There was a high concordance of IS6110 insertion
sites between R220 strains and HN878 (see Figure 2).
Of the 21 insertion sites in HN878, four are absent in
R220, although an additional four novel insertion sites
are present in this cluster (see Additional file 1, Table
S4). Similar to HN878, R220 has a single insertion in
the NTF region, grouping it with HN878 in the modern
sublineage of Beijing strains [34]. The R220 strains lack
the RD150 deletion characteristic of sublineage 7
[33,41], having Rv1671-Rv1674 intact and placing them
in sublineage 6. The six R86 strains were all found to
have the Beijing spoligotype and a common set of 14
IS6110 insertion sites (Additional file 1, Table S5),
including one insertion in the dnaA-dnaN region. However, only 6 of these sites were shared with HN878. The
R86 strains do not have any insertion in the NTF region
(~3.48 Mb), classifying them as “ancestral” or “atypical”
Beijing lineages [34].
Table 2 shows that the number of SNPs and indels was
lower between the R220 strains and HN878 compared to
the R86 strains, suggesting they are more closely related
to HN878. The number of SNPs and indels compared to
HN878 were 665-799 and 49-61, respectively, for the
cluster R86 strains, and 267-392 and 35-54, respectively,
for the cluster R220 strains.

*The number of SNPs and indels are assessed relative to HN878.

The clinical isolates in the R220 cluster are fairly
homogeneous at the genomic level. Among 1573 polymorphic sites between the R220 strains and H37Rv
(SNPs not involving PPE genes, PGRS genes, or repetitive elements), 1234 differences (78.4%) were shared
among HN878 and all 8 R220 strains. Some of these differences from H37Rv might be shared with other strain
families like LAM. There were 113 sites (7.2%) where
the R220 strains shared a difference from H37Rv but
HN878 did not, and there were 91 sites (5.8%) where
HN878 differed from H37Rv but the R220 strains did
not. Each of the strains except one had a small number
of unique SNPs (1-12).
R86 strains are found to have a set of SNPs compared
to H37Rv that only partially overlaps with the SNPs in
HN878. Out of a selected set of 1885 SNPs, 1126
(59.7%) were found to be common among HN878 and
all six R86 strains relative to H37Rv, HN878 has 297
(15.8%) unique SNPs, and the R86 strains have 256
(13.6%) shared SNPs not in HN878. Thus, while both

HN878 and the R86 share many polymorphisms presumably acquired in a common ancestor of the Beijing
family, they have each diverged significantly, reflecting
the difference in their lineages (sublineage 1 for R86
versus sublineage 6 for HN878).
When SNPs at synonymous sites are categorized into
specific base-pair substitutions, the majority of replacements (~60%) are found to be G:C to A:T transversions
(68/112 in the R86 cluster, and 75/126 in the R220 cluster) (Figure 3). However, a similar bias is observed
among synonymous SNPs in CDC1551 or F11 (186/374
combined) when compared to H37Rv (c2 = 7.36 < 11.07
for the distribution of SNPs in the R220 cluster versus
those in CDC1551/F11, which means the difference in
substitution patterns is not significant at the p = 0.05
confidence level, df = 5), suggesting that the effect is not
due to a Beijing-specific shift in the types of mutation.
Drug-Resistance Mutations

Among the Beijing clinical isolates from South Africa,
well-known polymorphisms are observed that correlate
with drug resistance patterns. Drug-resistance polymorphisms for the 14 clinical isolates are shown in
Table 3. All of the Beijing isolates from the Western
Cape, South Africa included in this study are isoniazidresistant, whereas HN878 is susceptible. All six R86
strains have the S315T mutation in katG, explaining the
isoniazid resistance, and suggesting it was acquired prior
to divergence of this cluster. X156 and X85 also have
the c-15t inhA promoter mutation, and R1207, X132,
and X28 have c-17t in the inhA promoter. inhA promoter mutations are generally considered to confer a
lower-level of resistance to isoniazid (2-4 fold) as well as
high-level cross-resistance to ethionamide [42]. All 6
strains also have the mutation A381P in ethA, a

prodrug-activator, which has been suggested to also
confer high-level resistance to ethionamide [43]. The
polymorphisms in the R220 genome sequences are also
largely consistent with the reported drug-susceptibility
profiles, with the exception of ethionamide sensitivity in
isolates X122, X189, and X29 (Table 4). This may relate
to anomalies in drug susceptibility testing, as all R220
isolates have the c-15t inhA promoter mutation, which
should cause ethionamide resistance [43]. In contrast to
the cluster R86 isolates, the R220 isolates show no
mutations in katG. Strains R1909 and X189 also have
mutation Ile194Thr in the coding region of inhA, which
occurs in the active site of the enoyl-ACP reductase and
interferes with binding of INH-NAD and ETH-NAD
adducts [44,45].
Rifampicin resistance is explained in three R86 strains
(R1207, X132, and X28) by the D435V mutation in
rpoB, while the other three R86 strains (R1746, X156,
and X85) have S450L (equivalent to amino acids 516
and 531 in the conventional rpoB numbering based on
E. coli). Both mutations are known to confer resistance
to rifampicin [46]. S450L (TCG->TTG) is the most frequently observed mutation in cultures selected on rifampicin in vitro, implying lowest fitness cost [32]. D435V
(GAC->GTC) is much less common in vitro (~1%) [47],
but is frequently observed clinically [46,47]. Four of the
five R220 isolates that are rifampicin-resistant (R1909,
X122, X189, and R1505) have a mutation in rpoB (either
S450L or H445Y). However, isolate X29 (rifampicinresistant) does not have any mutations in rpoB, and
conversely, isolate R1842 (rifampicin-sensitive) has
S450L in rpoB, which in turn may reflect laboratory
error. The H445Y mutation is less frequent among clinical isolates, but also occurs in the rifampicin binding
site in RNA polymerase.
Resistance to aminoglycosides can result from a variety of polymorphisms, generally related to the small
subunit of the ribosome. Mutations that confer resistance to streptomycin and similar compounds are
usually found in the 500-bp or 900-bp region of rrs, the
16S rRNA, or in rpsL, one of the ribosomal proteins
[48]. All six R86 strains have the a514c mutation in rrs,
conferring streptomycin resistance. X28 and X156
showed streptomycin resistance in drug-susceptibility
testing; data on the other four strains was not available.
Kanamycin binds a different site on the ribosome and
shows cross-resistance with amikacin and capreomycin
[49]. The most common mutation associated with kanamycin resistance is a1401g in rrs [50]. All R86 strains
except isolate R1746 have the a1401g mutation in rrs.
Four of the six strains were kanamycin-resistant (the
other two were not tested). The capreomycin sensitivity
of isolate X85 is inconsistent with the kanamycin/amikacin resistance, and might be an anomaly in drug-

susceptibility testing. In the R220 cluster, isolates X189
and X29 are resistant to kanamycin and amikacin, and
both strains show the expected a1401g mutation in rrs,
whereas X122 (amikacin-sensitive) does not. R1842 has
rrs c517t and X122 has K43R in ribosomal protein rpsL,
each of which should confer streptomycin resistance,
though this was not tested.
Resistance to fluoroquinolones is typically caused by
mutations in gyrA [51]. Isolates X28 and X85 were
reported to be ofloxacin-resistant, and X132 and X156
were reported to be ofloxacin-sensitive (data for R1207
and R1746 was not available). Three different amino
acid mutations were observed in gyrA among these six
strains: D94H in isolate R1207, D94N in X28, and D94G
in X85. The SNPs in isolates X28 and X85 explain their
ofloxacin resistance, and the fact that X132 and X156
have wild-type gyrA sequences is consistent with their
ofloxacin sensitivity. The ofloxacin resistance of isolates
X122 and X189 can be explained by mutations in D94
in gyrA. Isolate X29, which is sensitive to oflaxacin, has
a wild-type gyrA sequence.
All six R86 strains have the mutation M306I in embB,
commonly associated with resistance to ethambutol
[52], although all six strains were reported to be sensitive to ethambutol by drug-susceptibility testing. It is
well known that drug-susceptibility testing underreports ethambutol resistance [53]. Note that, while all
6 strains have a mutation from Met to Ile, they use different codons; ‘ATA’ (for R1207, X132, and X28) and
‘ATC’ (for R1746, X156, and X85). Many of the R220
strains have a mutation in Met306 in embB, either to

Val or Ile, although most of the strains tested sensitive
to ethambutol as well.
Although resistance to pyrazinamide was not tested,
10 of the 14 strains showed mutations in pncA (pyrazinamidase). One R86 isolate (X29) has a frameshift mutation of 8 bp in pncA, while another (X189) had a large
deletion of 881 bp knocking out the entire coding
region, along with the adjacent gene, Rv2044c. Strain
R1909 has mutation D8N, and strain X122 has Y103*
(truncation mutation). All six R220 strains show mutations in pncA: three strains have a frameshift mutation
(+c in codon 172), and three have amino acid substitution (C14R). Multiple mutations, including frameshifts,
throughout pncA are associated with resistance to pyrazinamide [54-56].
Non-clonal Acquisition of Drug-Resistance Mutations

In order to better understand the origins of drug resistance among the Beijing strains, a phylogenetic tree was
constructed to identify their evolutionary relationships.
Subsequently, drug resistance mutations were mapped
onto the tree to determine whether the patterns of drug
resistance (associations between strains) could be
explained by the same topology (i.e. inheritance).
A master set of 727 polymorphic sites (SNPs only) with
good depth of coverage (≥10x, i.e. sites covered by at
least 10 reads) across all sequenced strains was selected.
A subset of 704 sites was produced by removing those
involved in drug resistance (e.g. inhA, katG, gyrA, rpoB,
pncA, rrs, embB). The 704 sites were used to construct a
maximum parsimony tree using dnapars in PHYLIP

3.66 [57]. Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic relationship
with representative branch lengths, clearly showing the
tight clustering of the two groups, cluster R86 (X85,
X156, R1746, X132, X28, R1207) and the R220 cluster
(R1441, R1505, R1390, X29, R1842, X189, R1909, X122),
indicating that both groups have evolved independently
from a common ancestor.
The number of SNPs differentiating the strains within
each cluster is small but non-zero. Since the relationships are difficult to see in Figure 4a, the phylogeny was
re-drawn as a cladogram (without meaningful branch
lengths) in Figure 4b, and each branch is labeled with
the number of SNPs associated with it. The observation
that cluster R86 isolates share 236 SNPs while the R220
isolates share 303 unique SNPs suggests that these two
clusters are largely clonal, and that isolates within the
clusters are differentiated from one another by a limited
number of SNPs. For example, the similarity between
X29 and R1842 is supported by two unique SNPs:
Q219P in Rv2571c and V16V in proW. The SNPs associated with each branch point are listed in Additional
file 1, Table S7. It is also interesting to note that some
individual isolates have continued to diverge, for example isolate R1746 has accumulated 12 unique polymorphisms. These differentiating SNPs likely represent

Page 8 of 14

recent evolutionary events. According to this phylogeny,
HN878 is more closely related to the R220 cluster (sharing 195 SNPs, compared to 0 shared with the R86 cluster, using H37Rv as the outgroup), but is distinguished
from the R220 members by a further 195 unique differences (108 + 87). It is important to note that these polymorphisms do not necessarily imply anything about the
overall population structure, due to the non-random
nature of the sample. Nonetheless, they represent the
diversity and inter-relationships among the 14 clinical
isolates sequenced.
When mutations related to drug resistance were projected onto this phylogeny, the patterns were frequently
found to disagree with the phylogeny above. The most
parsimonious explanation for this observation is that
mutations conferring resistance to a given drug have
arisen multiple times independently within both the
R220 and R86 clusters. Figure 5 shows the pattern of
mutations in gyrA conferring fluoroquinolone resistance.
In these 14 Beijing strains, mutations in Asp94 appear
to have arisen 6 times independently, each associated
with a unique isolate (i.e. they were not clustered in the
cladogram). In fact, Asp94 is mutated to 4 different
amino acids (Gly: X85, X122, Asn: X28, His: R1207, Ala:

X29, R1842, X189), again supporting the uniqueness of
these events.
Mutations in rpoB related to rifampicin resistance are
shown in Figure 6. In the R86 cluster, the six isolates
divide into two groups: three isolates with the S450L
mutation, and three with the D435V mutation. Similarly,
the S450L mutation also explains the rifampicin resistance in a group of five isolates of the R220 cluster,
clearly demonstrating that each cluster has acquired
rifampicin resistance independently. It is important to
note that three of the eight R220 isolates did not bear
the S450L mutation. Although many R220 isolates have
the S450L polymorphism [58], as of 2006 only 73% of
R220 isolates were RIF-resistant [27], indicating that this
polymorphism had not yet achieved fixation in the
population, and thus the population structure has not
yet been taken over by a distinct MDR clone. Of the
three R220 isolates without the S450L mutation, two
had wild-type rpoB sequences and were RIF-susceptible,

Page 9 of 14

and the third had a distinct RIF-resistance mutation:
H445Y.
With respect to isoniazid resistance, Figure 7 shows
that the c-15t inhA promoter mutation arose independently in both the R220 and R86 clusters. Whereas the
c-15t mutation is found in all 8 strains of R220, it is
only found in 2 of the 6 strains in the R85 cluster. However, the g-17t promoter mutation occurs in three other
strains in the R86 cluster. The c-15t and g-17t inhA
promoter mutations in the R86 cluster both occurred in
the context of the katG S315T mutation, which occurs
on an earlier branch and is found in all the strains of
the R86 cluster. Simultaneous mutations in katG and
the inhA promoter are frequently observed in clinical
isolates [42], although it is unexpected that the inhA
promoter mutations, which confer lower-level resistance
to isoniazid, apparently occurred second. In contrast,
the Ile194Thr mutation in inhA in isolates X189 and
R1909 appears to have been acquired subsequent to the
c-15t inhA promoter mutation common to the R220
strains, probably conferring higher-level resistance.

Figure 7 Mutations in inhA and katG related to isoniazid

When the mutations in rrs and rpsL are mapped onto
the phylogeny of the Beijing isolates (Figure 8), it is
found that the R86 strains all shared mutation a516g in
rrs, suggesting that streptomycin resistance arose in a
common ancestor. The rrs a1401g mutation, responsible
for kanamycin resistance, was observed in 5 of the
6 cluster R86 isolates, but not in isolate R1746. Therefore, it most likely has arisen twice within this cluster
(unless there was a reversion to wild-type in R1746). In
the R220 cluster, mutations (and most likely aminoglycoside resistance) were less prevalent. Isolate R1842 has
a unique c517t rrs mutation that presumably also causes
streptomycin resistance, and X122 is the only strain that
has the K43R mutation in rpsL.
Finally, among the 14 Beijing isolates (both clusters),
there appear to be six distinct mutations of Met306 in
embB (Figure 9).

Discussion
Our data suggests that extensive drug-resistance
(beyond MDR) among Beijing strains in the Western

Cape of South Africa is evolving and spreading adaptively rather than by clonal expansion. The phylogenetic
analysis suggests that MDR drug resistance is being
transmitted clonally, as demonstrated by the observation
that isolates in the R220 cluster share the same c-15t
inhA promoter mutation, and isolates in the R86 cluster
share the same KatG S315T mutation. Similarly, many
of the strains share the RpoB S450L mutation (though
acquired separately in each cluster). This is consistent
with the view that MDR-TB in the Western Cape is
spreading by transmission [27]. However, mutations in
other drug-resistance-related genes are highly homoplaseous, showing that the XDR mutations are not clonally
related, even within these tightly defined clusters. For
example, among the eight R220 strains sequenced, fluoroquinolone resistance was acquired three times independently, ethambutol resistance was acquired four times
independently, and resistance to aminoglycosides was
acquired four times independently.
The repeated acquisition of drug resistance mutations
in these strains suggests that XDR isolates are less fit
and do not propagate or compete well among the circulating population of Beijing variants. If there were one
well-adapted XDR clone that had perhaps acquired
compensatory mutations, then it would presumably
result in identical drug-resistance mutations being

transmitted through the population, which is not the
case. This is consistent with the findings of van der
Spuy [28], who found that, although Beijing strains as a
whole were more prevalent and hence presumably more
fit than other TB genotypes, drug resistant strains were
not the predominant contributor to the rise of Beijing in
the Cape Town region (but rather drug-susceptible isolates), probably due to increased fitness cost associated
with drug-resistance mutations. Thus, although the Beijing strain as a whole appears to be more transmissible
than other strains of TB, accounting for its success and
world-wide dissemination, this does not appear to
directly explain the spread of XDR drug-resistance
among Beijing strains, as isolates in the region display
varying drug-resistance mutations and hence do not
represent the transmission of an identical clone. Diversity of resistance mutations among Beijing strains has
also been observed in Japan [25] and Russia [22], again
indicating independent acquisition.
This pattern mimics what has been observed for the
LCC strains (’Low Copy Clade,’ so-called because they

Page 11 of 14

have only 5 copies of the IS6110 insertion sequence),
which are also prevalent in South Africa [59], although
LCC strains are not of the Beijing genotype, but instead
are in principle genetic group 2. Cluster analysis of drug
resistance mutations in LCC isolates showed that they
could not all be explained by a single sequence of acquisition, suggesting they arose multiple times independently [60]. However, previous studies have examined
phylogenetic relationships using only a limited set of
markers, including the drug-resistance mutations themselves, whereas our study is the first to use a genomewide catalog of SNPs to assess relationships among
strains independent of the drug-resistance mutations.
The repeated development of XDR drug resistance
among Beijing strains of tuberculosis in the Western
Cape region differs from other outbreaks of drugresistant TB, such as in New York City in the 1990’s
[17,18], as well as in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa more
recently [61,62]. Each outbreak occurred in a defined
geographical setting and was demonstrated to be due to
transmission of clones with identical drug-resistance
markers. In contrast, our findings suggest that XDR
drug resistance in the Beijing strains in the Western
Cape is not spreading clonally, but continues to be
acquired independently in different strains. The drugresistant TB outbreak in the Western Cape of South
Africa covers a wider geographical region (spanning
hundreds of miles). Thus the strains we analyzed are
more distantly related, although they share a common
ancestor, which is in turn reflected by the number of
SNPs differentiating the respective isolates. The wide
distribution of these strains demonstrates how failure to
contain an initial drug resistant strain leads to both
spread and acquisition of additional resistance markers
under the right conditions, thereby emphasizing the
need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of drug resistance.
There are a number of possible explanations for the
increased association of drug resistance with the Beijing
strain [34,63]. One hypothesis is that the Beijing strain
is more adaptive, allowing it to acquire mutations more
rapidly, which are then selected through the application
of chemotherapy. It has been hypothesized that the
apparent adaptiveness of the Beijing strain could be due
to mutations in DNA repair genes mutT2 and mutT4
which might produce a hypermutator phenotype [64].
However, these mutations appear only in the most
recent lineages, and are not found in the more ancestral
lineages, including lineage 1, of which cluster R86 is a
member. So it could not explain the extensive homoplasy of drug resistance among all these isolates.
Furthermore, a comparison of the types of substitutions
in the genomes of R220 isolates versus R86 isolates
shows that the profiles are nearly identical (Figure 3),
suggesting that there have not been functional changes

Ioerger et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:670
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/670

to specific DNA repair genes or mechanisms, which
might have been reflected in a bias of the substitution
patterns [65,66]. No evidence has yet been found for
hypermutation among clinical isolates, and the in vitro
rpoB mutation rate (1.1 × 10-8) has been found to be in
line with non-Beijing strains [67].
The primary limitation of our study is related to the
selection of clinical isolates for sequencing. While all
were of the Beijing genotype, the strains chosen for
sequencing were selected to span a range of drug resistance from mono-resistant (all were resistant to INH) to
XDR. While no sampling bias (in terms of age, gender,
etc.) was intentionally applied, and the samples were isolated from patients in a variety of hospitals throughout
the Western Cape region, it could be the case that our
conclusions are specific to the small number of strains
sequenced, or their shared resistance to isoniazid, and
might not generalize to the broader TB epidemic within
the region, or to outbreaks of drug-resistance and/or the
Beijing strain of M. tuberculosis in other geographic
locations around the world. Furthermore, no drugsusceptible strains from the Western Cape were
sequenced, making the evolutionary relationships to the
broader population of strains endemic to the region
speculative. Finally, incidence of HIV is high the
Western Cape region, and this could be an additional
complicating factor that could influence the acquisition of
drug resistance in these strains, as suggested in [68], but
our study did not control for HIV status of the patients.

Conclusions
Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of
genetic differences among clinical isolates of the Beijing
genotype from the Western Cape of South Africa suggests that, while MDR-TB is spreading by transmission
in the region, additional drug resistance mutations are
being acquired independently, and hence the spread of
extensive drug resistance (XDR) appears to be non-clonal. The successful dissemination of these drug-resistant
Beijing genotypes in South Africa should be a major
concern for the National Tuberculosis Control Program,
as the current strategy is unable to curb the spread of
these strains [27]. Failure to contain (diagnose and treat)
these strains has led to the evolution of XDR-TB
through further acquisition of resistance markers.
