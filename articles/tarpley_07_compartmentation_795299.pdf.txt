Abstract
Background: The sucrose that accumulates in the culm of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)
and other large tropical andropogonoid grasses can be of commercial value, and can buffer
assimilate supply during development. Previous study conducted with intact plants showed that
sucrose can be radially transferred to the intracellular compartment of mature ripening sorghum
internode without being hydrolysed. In this study, culm-infused radiolabelled sucrose was traced
between cellular compartments and among related metabolites to determine if the compartmental
path of sucrose during radial transfer in culm tissue was symplasmic or included an apoplasmic step.
This transfer path was evaluated for elongating and ripening culm tissue of intact plants of two
semidwarf grain sorghums. The metabolic path in elongating internode tissue was also evaluated.
Results: On the day after culm infusion of the tracer sucrose, the specific radioactivity of sucrose
recovered from the intracellular compartment of growing axillary-branch tissue was greater (nearly
twice) than that in the free space, indicating that sucrose was preferentially transferred through
symplasmic routes. In contrast, the sucrose specific radioactivity in the intracellular compartment
of the mature (ripening) culm tissue was probably less (about 3/4's) than that in free space indicating
that sucrose was preferentially transferred through routes that included an apoplasmic step. In
growing internodes of the axillary branch of sorghum, the tritium label initially provided in the
fructose moiety of sucrose molecules was largely (81%) recovered in the fructose moiety,
indicating that a large portion of sucrose molecules is not hydrolysed and resynthesized during
radial transfer.
Conclusion: During radial transfer of sucrose in ripening internodes of intact sorghum plants,
much of the sucrose is transferred intact (without hydrolysis and resynthesis) and primarily through
a path that includes an apoplasmic step. In contrast, much of the sucrose is transferred through a
symplasmic path in growing internode (axillary branch) tissue. These results contrast with the
probable symplasmic path in mature culm of the closely related species, sugarcane. Phylogenetic
variability exists in the compartmental path of radial transfer of sucrose in culms of the
andropogonoid grasses.

Background
The Andropogoneae tribe of grasses includes a number of
large tropical grasses, several of which are widely cultivated for either their grain (sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)
Moench] and maize [Zea mays L.]) or for the sucrose accumulated in the culm (sugarcane [Saccharum officinarum L.]
and sorghum). The examined species contain sucrose in
the culms. This sucrose can support grain filling in some
circumstances by buffering the supply of photoassimilate.
This study contributes to improved understanding of
processes of sucrose accumulation in sorghum culm. Our
first objective investigated whether radial transfer of
sucrose from phloem to the storage compartment of ripening culm (elongated internode during sucrose accumulation) included an apoplasmic step. Second, we
evaluated the metabolic path of sucrose, including the
extent of sucrose hydrolysis, during this radial transfer
within a growing culm (axillary branch). These results
complement those of a previous study [1] that indicated
much of the sucrose is not hydrolyzed during radial transfer in ripening culm.
Sorghum is closely related to sugarcane [2]; members of
both species are capable of accumulating large amounts of
sucrose in the culms. Similarities exist between the two
species with respect to the processes of sucrose accumulation in ripening internodes. For both, a low level of
sucrose degradative activity, especially acid invertase activity relative to sucrose synthetic activity, is a prerequisite
for sucrose accumulation [3-6]. A large proportion of the
sucrose is neither degraded nor synthesized during radial
transfer in ripening sorghum internodes [1]. Sucrose can
also be transferred intact in sugarcane internodes [7,8],
but sucrose synthetic activity further promotes the sucrose
accumulation [5].
The radial transfer of sucrose follows a symplasmic path
in sugarcane [9,10] based on evidence from selective
movement of compartmental tracer dyes and of lignification and suberization situated to prevent apoplasmic
movement of sucrose between the vascular bundles and
parenchyma in the ripening sugarcane internodes. Other
evidence for systematic blockage of plasmodesmata suggests that an apoplasmic step might be necessary in radial
transfer in sugarcane [11].
In internodes of mature sorghum culm, the sucrose moves
along its metabolic path during radial transfer without
requiring hydrolysis. This conclusion is based on several
points of evidence. The extractable activities of the sucrose
degradative enzymes, invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) and sucrose
synthase (EC 2.4.1.13), decline to low levels prior to the
period of extensive sucrose accumulation in diverse sorghums representing a range of culm sucrose-accumulating
potential [3,12,13]. This was confirmed in the case of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/33

sucrose synthase by a concurrent decline in the levels of
transcript for the sucrose-synthase gene [3]. In addition,
sucrose is found at much higher concentration than either
glucose or fructose in both the free space and the intracellular compartment of culms during storage [14]. Lastly,
sucrose recovered from the intracellular compartment of a
distant part of culm after infusion of asymmetrically
labelled sucrose did not possess much randomization of
label. Extensive randomization of label would be
expected if the sucrose had been hydrolyzed and resynthesized [1]. In the same study, the sucrose appeared to preferentially move in a cellular path that included an
apoplasmic step. This preliminary conclusion was based
on a higher sucrose specific radioactivity being present in
the free space relative to the intracellular compartment of
the sampled culm tissue. Endogenous sucrose would
dilute the radioactive sucrose, thus a higher sucrose radioactivity indicates a preferential or prior movement
through that compartment. The radial transfer processes
of sucrose into intracellular storage in the culms of sorghum delimit the processes of remobilisation from culm
to grain, thus identifying the sucrose-accumulation processes also helps refine targets for improving or stabilizing
sorghum grain yield.
As sorghum internode elongation nears completion,
sucrose accumulates in the culm tissue [12]. The rate of
accumulation in culm internodes often increases near
anthesis, which is typically a period of low demand in
reproductive sinks of uniculm sorghum types selected and
managed for grain production [15]. Sucrose accumulated
in culm tissue during anthesis can be remobilized to
reproductive sinks if photoassimilate export from source
leaves is low relative to reproductive sink demand [15,16].
Conversely, sucrose accumulates in mature internodes as
grain filling is completed before new axillary branches
develop from upper nodes of many of the non-senescent,
tropically adapted sorghums [17]. The emergence of axillary branches after grain filling is complete offers an
opportunity to compare, simultaneously, the processes of
sucrose radial transfer from phloem to the intracellular
storage/utilization sites in mature internodes of the main
culm and in elongating internodes of rapidly growing
branches. The cellular and metabolic paths of sucrose during radial transfer between phloem and the intracellular
compartment in growing sorghum internodes have not
been studied in intact plants, but would be expected to be
symplasmic and without extensive sucrose hydrolysis
based on comparison with other growing plant tissues
[18].
The primary objective of this study was to determine if
radial transfer of sucrose between phloem and the intracellular compartment in ripening internodes of sorghum
included passage through an apoplasmic step. Radiola-

belled sucrose was introduced into culms of two sorghum
cultivars; the sucrose recovered from unperturbed tissue
for analysis; and the sucrose specific radioactivity compared between apoplasmic (free space) and the intracellular compartment. Because endogenous sucrose dilutes
radiolabelled sucrose, the comparative dilution of sucrose
specific radioactivity is indicative of the compartmental
path during radial transfer.
A secondary objective was to compare the radial path of
sucrose from phloem to intracellular compartment of
growing axillary-branch tissue with that of the ripening
internode tissue. A previous study indicated much of the
sucrose was not hydrolyzed and resynthesized during
radial transfer in ripening sorghum internode, but the
metabolic path in elongating internode tissue was not
examined. Asymmetrically labelled 3H-sucrose (label in
the fructose moiety only) was infused into culms, sucrose
recovered from the intracellular compartment of unperturbed branch tissue was analyzed, and the distribution of
3H-label between the two hexose moieties of sucrose was
quantified. An extensive amount of redistribution of label
between the moieties would indicate that extensive
hydrolysis and resynthesis of sucrose occurred during the
radial transfer, whereas little redistribution of radiolabel
in the recovered sucrose molecules would indicate that little hydrolysis and resynthesis had occurred.

Results
No gradient of radiolabel from tracer sucrose along the
length of the sampled internode
Radiolabel content was similar among sampling locations
of ripening internode tissue. These locations were opposite and below the infusion point. The uniform radiolabel
content among the locations indicated neither tissue damage nor simple diffusion through culm tissue could
explain the movement of radiolabeled sucrose into the
sampled portion of internode. Instead, the lack of a gradient in the radiolabel along the length of the sampled portion of the internode is consistent with delivery of the
radiolabelled sucrose through phloem to the sampled
portion of the internode. Similar results were obtained in
previous studies [1,19,20], and the delivery of the radiotracer through normal distribution routes (i.e., phloem)
was a basic assumption of the methodology used in this
study. The lack of variation of radiolabel content among
sampling locations indicated the 24 samples analyzed in
the present study provided an unbiased representation of
a) internode location, b) cultivar, c) developmental stage,
and d) intracellular compartment.
Sucrose and hexose-sugar contents of intracellular and
free-space compartments
Culm soluble sugars were located largely within the intracellular compartment of both ripening and elongating

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/33

internodes. The mean percentage of soluble sugars in the
intracellular compartment was 83% for ripening internodes of the main culm and 89% for elongating internodes of axillary branches (Fig. 1). The volumes of the
intracellular compartment and free space were not determined, which made it necessary to compare relative contents rather than concentrations of sugar. Total solublesugar (glucose + fructose + sucrose) contents, normalized
on a tissue dry weight basis, were greater in both compartments of the ripening-culm tissue than in respective compartments of the elongating-internode tissue (results not
shown). A more striking difference was the greater ratio of
sucrose to hexose (glucose + fructose) sugar (> 1) for both
compartments of the ripening-culm tissue than for respective compartments of elongating-internode tissue (< 1)
(Fig. 1).

specific radioactivity of intracellular and freespace compartments
The ratio of the 14C-sucrose specific-radioactivity in intracellular compared to free-space compartments (sucrose
specific-radioactivity ratio) was calculated to determine,
in part, the path of sucrose during transfer between
phloem and intracellular compartments. The 14C-sucrose
specific radioactivity is the 14C-radioactivity recovered as
sucrose from a compartment divided by sucrose content
of the same compartment. As infused radiolabelled
sucrose moves throughout the plant, the sucrose specific
radioactivity decreases due to dilution from the endogenous sucrose. A relatively high sucrose specific-radioac-

tivity ratio would indicate the radial path of the sucrose is
primarily intracellular (symplasmic). A ratio greater than
1 (1.96 Â± 0.42 [95% c.i.]) in elongating internodes of axillary branches (Fig. 2) indicated sucrose is preferentially
moved into the intracellular compartment through symplasmic routes.
In the ripening internode of the main culm, the sucrose
specific-radioactivity ratio was less than in the elongating
internode and probably less than 1 (0.77 Â± 0.41 [95%
c.i.]) (Fig. 2). The preferential path of sucrose radial transfer of ripening internodes is likely to include an apoplasmic step. Similar results of a previous study [1] indicated
the path in the ripening internode included an apoplasmic step. In combination, the results from the two studies
provide strong evidence that the preferential route in the
ripening stem includes an apoplasmic step.
Radioactivity distribution between hexose moieties of
sucrose recovered from intracellular compartment of
elongating internodes
Pearson's correlation analysis was used to compare the
sucrose specific-radioactivity ratio between 14C- and 3Hsucrose that were infused simultaneously and sampled
from elongating internodes of the axillary tillers. The correlation coefficient was 0.988. The strong positive correlation indicated both 14C- and 3H-sucrose were
quantitatively similarly transported into the intracellular
compartment of elongating internodes of sorghum. These

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/33

results suggest that isotope discrimination during radial
transfer of sucrose had little influence on the redistribution of 3H-label between the hexose moieties of sucrose as
an indicator of the metabolic path of the sucrose.
Upon introduction into the plants, the 3H-sucrose contained all of the 3H-label in the fructose moiety. If the
sucrose was hydrolyzed (inverted) and resynthesized
along the route to the intracellular storage compartment,
3H-label would be redistributed between the two hexose
moieties of the resynthesized sucrose because of the
omnipresence and activity of phosphoglucoisomerase
(EC 5.3.1.9) [1]. The equal distribution of 14C-label
between the two hexose moieties of 14C-sucrose provided
an unchanging reference for the distribution of radioactivity between hexose moieties. The 14C-radioactivity recovered in sucrose of the intracellular compartment of the
axillary-branch tissue remained equally distributed
between the two hexose moieties (Fig. 3) as observed previously for ripening sorghum internodes [1] (Fig. 3). In
contrast, the 3H-label in the recovered sucrose remained
in the fructose moiety (81%) of elongating internodes
(Fig. 3). This same result was observed for ripening sorghum internodes in the previous study [1] (Fig. 3).
Assuming a Poisson distribution, a large portion (52% Â±
33% [95% c.i.]) of the fructose moiety of sucrose was not
exposed to hydrolysis (i.e., sucrose cleavage, hexose phosphorylation, isomerization of hexose phosphates, and
sucrose resynthesis) during radial transfer of sucrose in
the elongating internodes of the growing axillarybranches of intact sorghum plants [7].

Soluble sugar within the intracellular compartment of the
internodal tissue
The larger sucrose to hexose-sugar ratio observed in ripening internode tissue relative to elongating internode tissue
(Fig. 1) is consistent with variation in soluble-sugar composition during maturation of sorghum culms [1,3,12].
Previous studies indicated the increase in sucrose relative
to hexose sugar is preceded by a decline in sucrose-degradative activity during the transition from internode elongation to the ripening phase [3,12]. The high content of
soluble sugars in the intracellular compartment of internodes of axillary branches and the ripening internodes
(Fig. 1) is substantiated in previous reports [1,3]. When
plant tissues contain high levels of osmoticum, including
soluble sugars, the osmoticum concentrations of the free
space and intracellular compartment are fairly comparable [18]. In the present study, the higher content of soluble sugars in the intracellular compartment reflects, in
part, the greater volume compared to free space.

The relatively high ratio of glucose to fructose in the intracellular compartment of the axillary branch is probably a

large portion of sucrose is transferred intact (Fig. 3) without hydrolysis or resynthesis. In ripening internodes of
sorghum, the preferential route of sucrose during radial
transfer includes passage through an apoplasmic compartment (Fig. 2). Yet, a large portion of the sucrose is
transferred intact (Fig. 3).

result of greater consumption of fructose. The procedures
for sugar analysis were modified from ones known to prevent artifactually high fructose levels in plant tissue
extracts [21]. The starch levels in sorghum internodes are
typically quite low [3], so do not sequester enough glucose to explain the high ratio as due to high glucose influx.
In asparagus stem, a greater consumption of fructose was
related to increased capacity for glycolytic flux in the stem
[22]. However, the transition from a high glucose to fructose ratio as noted in immature grape berries to one near
unity in mature grape berries was associated with a breakdown of cell integrity during ripening resulting in a loss of
the spatial separation of substrate and enzyme (invertase)
[23]. In mature sugarcane internode, the fructose is
thought to be maintained at low levels due to high fructose phosphorylating activity [24].
Apoplasmic step in path of radial transfer of sucrose in
ripening internode
In the growing axillary branch of sorghum, the preferential route of sucrose during radial transfer from phloem to

The symplasmic transfer of the intact sucrose to the growing internodes of the axillary branch is consistent with
expectations for paths in growing plant organs [25]. There
is no obvious advantage for an apoplasmic step within the
steep concentration gradient between phloem and growing cells and tissue. The sucrose moves into growing cells
and has a relatively short half-life before being degraded
and used for various purposes [26]. The utilization of
sucrose in the cell maintains a concentration gradient
allowing more sucrose to enter into the intracellular storage compartment via diffusion, bulk flow, or regulated
plasmodesmatal conductance [26].
The presence of an apoplasmic step during radial transfer
of sucrose in ripening internodes of sorghum is consistent
with expectations for plant organs after the transition
from growth to accumulation of large amounts of osmoticum [18]. The apoplasmic step can enable regulation of
cellular uptake of sucrose at the membrane-transporter
level. However, the route in the ripening internode in sorghum differs from that in sugarcane, a closely related species, which appears to involve symplasmic transfer [9].
A positive association between the extent of competition
between parenchymal uptake and phloem uptake of
sucrose and the sucrose concentrating ability of sorghum
internodal tissue from different genotypes and developmental stages [19], in combination with evidence for
radial transfer of sucrose intact [1] and through an apoplasmic compartment, suggests a possible role for a
sucrose transporter in the plasmalemma or tonoplast
membrane as part of a mechanism regulating sucrose
accumulation in sorghum culm, but no direct evidence
exists in support of this. Furthermore, there is no evidence
to rule out a role for hexose transport from the apoplasm,
but under the conditions of the present study this would
be a secondary role. In sugarcane, the ShSUT1 sucrose
transporter is localized in parenchyma tissue surrounding
the stem vascular bundles [10] where it might be involved
in sucrose efflux to the apoplasm or in return of apoplasmic sucrose to the symplasm. In the latter case, the sucrose
transporter might be acting in conjunction with the lignified, suberized cell walls surrounding the vascular bundles to provide both a biochemical and a physical barrier
against backflow of sucrose into the vascular system [27].
Evidence exists for uptake of sucrose intact [7,8] into sugarcane internode tissue, and also for hexose uptake into

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:33

suspension cells derived from sugarcane culm parenchyma tissue [28]. Hexose transporters have been identified in sugarcane internodes with expression in the
vascular bundle [29] and in the surrounding parenchyma
cells [27]. The mechanisms for tonoplast uptake of
sucrose in sugarcane internode are not clear [27]. The
expression patterns of sugar transporters in sugarcane
culm do not exclude any of the suggested cellular or metabolic paths of sucrose during radial transfer.
Although the transcriptome has been analyzed for various
sorghum tissues, developmental stages and environmental conditions (e.g. [30]), the objectives of these studies
have not included the provision of information to help
define the mechanisms of sucrose accumulation in ripening sorghum internode [31]. A number of putative sugar
transporters have been identified via transcriptomic studies in sugarcane [29,31,32]. These, but especially the
ShSUT1, have potential as probes for examining the
expression patterns in sorghum internodes and providing
insight into the mechanisms of sucrose accumulation in
sorghum culm.
Sucrose synthetic metabolism in ripening internodes of
sugarcane might be sufficient to balance sucrose degradative activity remaining during the transition from internode elongation to ripening [5]. If the sucrose synthetic
metabolism of sugarcane does have this effect of increasing the sink strength of the ripening internode relative to
that of sorghum, then it might allow an earlier and greater
accumulation of sucrose. On the other hand, it could also
diminish the ability to remobilize sucrose from the ripening culm tissue.
Intact transfer of sucrose from phloem to intracellular
compartments
Observations of radial transfer of asymmetrically labeled
(3H) sucrose to the elongating internodes of sorghum
axillary branches indicate that there is no requirement for
hydrolysis and resynthesis of sucrose. Similarly, a substantial portion of sucrose is transported intact between
phloem and intracellular compartments within ripening
sorghum culm internodes. The transport of intact sucrose
agrees with recent models from sorghum [1] and sugarcane [7], which do not include a path involving invertase
action that cleaves sucrose prior to hexose phosphorylation, isomerization of hexose phosphates, and sucrose
resynthesis during sucrose uptake into the intracellular
compartment. The isomerization of the hexose phosphates due to phosphoglucoisomerase action is usually
rapid and easily reversible. The unchanged asymmetry of
3H-label between hexose moieties of sucrose transported
to elongating internodes in the present study indicates
inversion of sucrose and isomerization of hexoses is not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/33

necessary for radial transfer of sucrose between phloem
and intracellular compartments.
Previous studies to determine the metabolic path of
sucrose have often involved application of the tracer
sucrose to slices of culm tissue (stem disks). The initial
efforts supporting the inversion model, which hypothesized sucrose hydrolysis and resynthesis [33], involved
incubation or washing of the tissue slices for extended
periods in solution lacking osmoticum before sucrose
uptake was quantified. The steep concentration gradient
between wash solutions and culm tissue could have
increased cell turgor and induced invertase activity. The
invertase activity would enable sucrose hydrolysis prior to
sucrose accumulation in cells within disks [34]. The interpretation of observations of sucrose uptake in stem disks
(portions of culm cross-sections) from solution presents
additional challenges. Sectioning and suspension of disks
in solution can interrupt or bypass normal anatomical
flow of sucrose from phloem to the intracellular compartment. Rapid depletion of the sucrose pool of sieve elements and companion cells could result due to
interruption of normal routes of replenishment [35]. In
more recent studies, tissue slices from ripening sugarcane
internodes were incubated in osmotically buffered solution to avoid the steep turgor gradients during washing in
early studies. Uptake of asymmetrically labeled sucrose
from the osmotically buffered solutions provided preliminary evidence that sucrose was not necessarily cleaved
and resynthesized in route to storage in cells [7,8]. These
more recent studies of sucrose uptake warned against
uncritical acceptance of the inversion model, but the
inherent limitations of experiments using excised disks in
solution equivocated arguments against the inversion
model, and also could not determine the compartmental
path of the sucrose during radial transfer. The results from
intact sorghum internodes in the present study show that
the inversion model is not universally valid for the andropogonoid grasses.
Evidence that a substantial portion of the sucrose is transferred intact from the phloem to the storage compartment
in sorghum culm does not rule out the possibility that
sucrose can also be inverted in the apoplasmic space followed by cellular uptake of the hexose sugars. Evidence
for such uptake exists in sugarcane internode cells [28].
The ratios of these two sucrose metabolic paths during
radial transfer in sorghum internode under various conditions has not been studied.
Nature of sink strength during sucrose accumulation in
ripening sorghum internode
'In planta' and molecular studies similarly indicate
sucrose metabolism is not necessary for sucrose storage in
ripening sorghum internodes. Extractable activities of

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:33

sucrose-degrading enzymes decline to low levels in internodes prior to sucrose accumulation [3,12]. The decline
includes repression of activity at the pretranslational level
[3]. Yet, relatively low levels of sucrose degradation do not
imply that the ripening sorghum internode is a passive
sink. A previous culm infusion study performed on sorghum [19] showed that the gradient in radiolabel content
directly below the infusion site was related to potential
sink strength. Cellular uptake in internode tissue was
greater in a sweet-stemmed than a grain-type cultivar. In
addition, competition between phloem removal and
intracellular storage of provided sucrose was greater for
the sweet-stemmed cultivar. The preceding decline in
activities of the sucrose-degrading enzymes, however, did
not relate to potential sink strength. The results from the
present study indicate radial transfer of intact sucrose in
ripening internodes is compatible with a mechanism of
sucrose accumulation that includes regulation of cellular
uptake. The mechanism in sorghum internodes regulating
sucrose accumulation and remobilization is likely to lie in
the combination of regulation of cellular uptake of
sucrose at the membrane transporter level, passive resistance to back-flow of the sucrose due to distance between
some storage cells and phloem, and/or regulation of flow
through the plasmodesmata. These possibilities were not
addressed in this study.

Conclusion
In the growing axillary branch of sorghum, the preferential cellular path of sucrose during radial transfer from
phloem to the intracellular compartment is symplasmic,
and much of the sucrose is transferred intact. In the
mature ripening internode, the compartmental path preferentially includes an apoplasmic step, and much of the
sucrose is transferred intact. Phylogenetic variation in the
extent to which an apoplasmic step is involved in the
radial transfer of sucrose in culms of the large tropical
grasses of the Andropogoneae needs to be defined, instead
of extrapolating sugarcane-based models of accumulation
to other species. The presented method of introducing
tracer sucrose into intact plants via culm infusion avoids
difficulties in interpretation of results obtained through
use of tissue slices.

Methods
Plant material and culture
Plants of two semidwarf grain sorghum types (Tx430 and
ATx631 X RTx436) were grown in research field plots
using typical production practices at the Texas A&M University Research Farm in Burleson County, Texas, USA.
The plants were healthy at the time of treatment.
Culm infusion
Infusion of radiolabeled sucrose into internodes of intact
plants was used to trace radial paths of transport between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/33

phloem and intracellular compartments. The culm infusion of sucrose solution was achieved for six plants of each
cultivar during a developmental period in which at least
one axillary branch (an axillary branch develops from an
upper node, typically no earlier than late grain-filling of
the main panicle) was at or nearing anthesis. At this developmental stage, the upper internodes of the axillary
branch are still elongating, but internodes on the main
culm are fully elongated. The sites for infusion on the
main culm were about ten internodes above soil level,
which avoided short basal internodes close to root sinks.
In addition, infusion sites were separated by about three
internodes from sink effects of the developing panicle and
axillary branches. Because of these compromises, the infusion internode was also chosen for analysis of mature
culm tissue. Previous study had demonstrated that the
portion of an elongated sorghum internode below and
opposite the infusion site is not subject to injury due to
the infusion. Sampling to avoid injured tissue avoided diffusion or mass flow of radiolabeled sucrose between the
infusion site and sampled tissue [19]. The spread of necrosis resulting from culm infusion in maize was no farther
than 1 cm from the infusion cavity [28]. The wound
response due to infusion of sweet sorghum extended no
farther than 15 to 30 mm from the infusion cavity based
on the ratio of radiolabel from the infused sucrose appearing in aqueous-ethanol insoluble relative to aqueous-ethanol soluble fractions of tissue extracts [19]. The mature
culm samples were obtained at distances ranging from 40
to 70 mm from the infusion cavity. The samples from axillary branches were much farther from the infusion site,
typically one to three internodes plus some portion of the
branch distant.
The infusion into the selected culm internode was performed over a 1-h period in mid-afternoon as described in
Tarpley et al. (1996) [1]. The general method of culm
infusion used in the study was described by Boyle et al.
[36]. A cork borer was used to drill a cylindrical hole
(about 0.2 mL in capacity) partway into an upper portion
of an internode. The cavity was then plugged with a serum
sleeve stopper. After creating the cavity and before plugging it, the cavity was immediately filled with unlabeled
sucrose solution to limit the amount of air introduced
into the tissue while working the stopper into place. A
small reservoir fed solution through tubing to a hypodermic needle that was inserted through the stopper into the
cavity. About 400 ÂµL was infused through tubing: first,
100 ÂµL as unlabeled solution to make sure uptake was
occurring; next, 100 ÂµL containing labeled sucrose; and
finally, 200 ÂµL as a rinse with unlabeled solution. Complete introduction of label into culm was achieved for
every plant. After infusion of the 204 mM (68 g L-1)
sucrose solution containing 148 kBq (4 ÂµCi) [U-14C]sucrose (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, California, USA) and

296 kBq (8 ÂµCi) [fructose-1-3H(N)]-sucrose (Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri, USA), the needle feeding the cavity was removed.
Plants were infused several hours before the end of the
light period, and harvested about 24 hours later. The culm
infusion procedure was used to introduce the labeled
sucrose into the normal plant distribution routes, thus
time needed to be allowed for the labeled sucrose to be
distributed throughout the plant. A 15-h period had
allowed a good distribution of label throughout the plant
in a previous study [19], while 24 h had also proved practical in another study [1]. The 24-h interval was used here
to allow the distribution to take advantage of a full diurnal cycle and approach steady state. A distribution
approaching steady state was desired when examining the
compartmental path of the sucrose during radial transfer.
After 24 h, tissue was sampled from a) mature culm below
and opposite the site of infusion (to avoid sucrose introduced into xylem or transferred directly through culm tissue), and b) internodal portions of an axillary branch
which was at or prior to anthesis. The harvested plant
material was bagged and stored on ice about one hour
until processed.
Differential extraction of free-space and intracellular
compartment
Once samples were brought to the laboratory, the infused
internode was sliced longitudinally into quarters. The
quarter opposite the site of infusion was sliced into 3-mm
sections with a razor blade. The razor blade was previously wiped with ethanol to remove oils. The resulting tissue sections were pooled in groups of two according to
distance below the height equivalent to that of the site of
infusion. When sampling the axillary branches, the middle portion of the internode was similarly quartered and
sliced, with a sufficient number of the slices taken to
approximate the tissue amount of the mature-culm samples.

The soluble sugars were differentially extracted from freespace and intracellular compartments of each group of
sections through the following procedure [7]. First, sugars
were extracted from the free space. Each group (typically
about 80-mg dry weight) was rinsed with 4-mL buffer (25
mM MES [2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid], pH
5.5, 250 mM mannitol, 1 mM CaCl2) for 2 minutes at
room temperature to remove free-space solutes. Rinses
were repeated with fresh buffer: once for 6 minutes and
once for 22 minutes. During these latter rinses, humidified air was bubbled through the solution [7]. At the completion of a rinse, solutions were plunged directly into icecold methanol (12 mL of pooled rinses and 36-mL methanol to make final 75% [v/v] [18.5 M] solution). Intracellular-compartment soluble sugars were removed by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/33

agitation of remaining tissue for 30 minutes at 65Â°C in
15-mL 75% methanol. This step was repeated once with
fresh aqueous (75%) methanol. These extracts were
pooled on ice. Subsamples were removed for long-term
storage at -20Â°C.
Radiolabel concentrations of soluble sugars
Free-space and intracellular-compartment extracts were
treated identically during analyses.

Samples in 75% methanol were treated with 10- to 15-mg
activated charcoal (Sigma C-5385) per mL to remove substances that might interfere with enzymatic analyses
[21,37]. The slurry was stirred, and then allowed to settle
overnight at -20Â°C. This process was repeated once before
removing solution away from the settled charcoal. Methanol in solution was then evaporated off at 60Â°C.
The total radioactivity in each sample was determined by
counting an aliquot using liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Beckman Instruments, Irvine, California, USA;
Model LS7500). The calculations for determining the relative contributions of 3H and 14C with automatic quench
correction were confirmed using simultaneous equations
[38].
The aqueous solutions remaining after evaporation of
methanol were brought to 9-mM K-acetate, pH 5.5, and
final concentrations of 4.3 EU glucose oxidase (EC
1.1.3.4) (Sigma G-6891) per mL and at least 545 EU catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) (Sigma C-30) per mL, where EU (enzymatic unit) is defined as 1 Âµmol substrate converted per
minute under the assay conditions used by the supplier.
After 60 minutes at 37Â°C, 0.5 meq of the acetate form of
Amberlite IRA-68 (Sigma), a weak anion exchanger, was
added per mL. Samples were agitated at room temperature
for two hours, and liquid removed off of the settled resin
to be saved for additional analyses. An aliquot was
counted to determine the radioactivity removed as enzymatically converted glucose and possibly as other anions.
The water content of the remaining resin slurry was determined by oven-drying [14]. This step was necessary to be
able to calculate the total volume from which the aliquot
was removed for counting.
Fructose was the next sugar to be selectively removed from
solution. The solution was brought to 5.5-mM Bis-Tris
(bis [2-hydroxyethyl]imino-tris [hydroxymethyl]-methane; 2-bis [2-hydroxyethyl]-amino-2-[hydroxymethyl]1,3-propanediol), pH 6.8. A hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) reaction was performed [14] in this buffer to completely convert fructose to a phosphate form for removal by strong
anion exchange resin [14]. After this, solution was
removed off of the resin and saved for additional analyses.
An aliquot was counted to determine radioactivity

removed to the resin as enzymatically converted fructose.
The water content of the remaining resin slurry was again
determined.
Water can become tritiated due to a solvent-exchange side
reaction of phosphoglucoisomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) [39] or
through complete oxidation of tritiated carbohydrates. An
activated charcoal:powdered cellulose spin column was
devised for rapid and quantitative removal of water from
sucrose in multiple small samples [20]. A 1:1 (w/w) mixture of Darco G-60 activated charcoal (Aldrich Chemical
Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, catalog no. 24,227-6)
and Sulka-Floc powdered cellulose (James River Corp.,
Hackensack, New Jersey, USA, SW-40 grade) was made.
The column was prepared by pouring 400 mg of the mixture into a 5-mL disposable hypodermic syringe barrel. A
glass microfiber disk was used to hold the powder in
place. Before use, the column was washed by spin elutions: several times with 1-ml additions of water, several
times with 75% methanol, and several more times with
water. A spin was 1800 g for 1 minute at room temperature. The 1-mL aliquot of sample was applied, the column
spun, and the first eluate collected. Four elutions, each of
1-mL water, then five elutions, each of 1-mL 80% methanol, followed. All 3H2O eluted in the first three eluates
(mean = 99.8%; 95% c.i. = 97.1 â 102.5%); sucrose was
recovered in the aqueous-methanol eluates (mean =
94.1%; 95% c.i. = 93.5 â 94.7%). Separation was complete (0.4% 14C in H2O eluates; 95% c.i. = -0.02 â 1.0%).
Sucrose was recovered in 80% methanol. To concentrate
the solution as well as to move sucrose into aqueous solution for enzymatic analysis, methanol was evaporated off
at 60Â°C. An aliquot was removed for counting to determine remaining radioactivity. The sucrose was then
cleaved by addition of invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) (United
States Biochemical Co., Cleveland, Ohio, USA; catalog no.
17676) at 2.9 EU per mL final concentration. The invertase supplemented the addition of buffered glucose oxidase and catalase that was otherwise identical to that
described earlier for the enzymatic conversion of glucose.
This reaction was allowed 90 minutes at 37Â°C. Other
steps for determining radioactivity in the hexose moieties
of sucrose were identical to those described earlier for
determining amounts in glucose and fructose.
Concentrations of specific soluble sugars
Glucose, fructose, and sucrose contents of the aqueous
solution remaining after the initial evaporation of methanol were determined. These assays, which relied upon
coupled-enzyme methods for stoichiometric production
of NADH, were further coupled to allow stoichiometric
reduction of INT (iodonitrotetrazolium violet). The
absorbance of reduced INT product was read at 492 nm.
The assays were performed in microtiter plates according

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/33

to Hendrix [40], but with the modifications supplied by
Tarpley et al. [14]. These modifications include the addition of albumin and detergent to help stabilize the
chromophore in homemade reaction solutions.
Statistical methods
The nature of the data suggested that a presentation of
95% confidence intervals (c.i.) about the mean was sufficient for interpretation. Confidence intervals are based on
untransformed data. Transformations to account for proportional data and for non-normality did not alter any
conclusions.

Randomization of label distribution between the two hexose moieties of sucrose was modeled as a Poisson process
because the chance of an individual hexose molecule
being involved in a particular catalysis event was rare [41].
