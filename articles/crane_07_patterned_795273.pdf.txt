Abstract
Background: Microsatellites (repeated subsequences based on motifs of one to six nucleotides)
are widely used as codominant genetic markers because of their frequent polymorphism and
relative selective neutrality. Minisatellites are repeats of motifs having seven or more nucleotides.
The large number of EST sequences now available in public databases offers an opportunity to
compare microsatellite and minisatellite properties and evaluate their evolution over a broad range
of plant taxa.
Results: Repeated motifs from one to 250 nucleotides long were identified in 6793306 expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) from 88 genera of vascular plants, using a custom data-processing pipeline that
allowed limited variation among repeats. The pipeline processed trimmed but otherwise unfiltered
sequence and output nonredundant loci of at least 15 nucleotides, with degree of polymorphism
and PCR primers wherever possible. Motifs that were an integral multiple of three in length were
more abundant and richer in G/C than other motifs. From 80 to 85% of minisatellite motifs
represented repeats within proteins, up to the 228-nucleotide repeat of ubiquitin, but not all of
these repeats preserved reading frame. The remaining 15 to 20% of minisatellite motifs were
associated with transcribed repetitive elements, e.g., retrotransposons. Relative microsatellite
motif frequencies did not correlate tightly to phylogenetic relationship. Evolution of increased
microsatellite and EST GC content was evident within the grasses. Microsatellites were less
frequent in the transcriptome of genera with large genomes, but there was no evidence for greater
dilution of the transcriptome with transposable element transcripts in these genera.
Conclusion: The relatively low correlation of microsatellite spectrum to phylogeny suggests that
repeat loci evolve more rapidly than the surrounding sequence, although tissue specificity of the
different EST libraries is a complicating factor. In-frame motifs are more abundant and higher in GC
than frame-shifting motifs, but most EST minisatellite loci appear to represent repeats in translated
sequence, regardless of whether reading frame is preserved. Motifs of four to six nucleotides are
as polymorphic in EST collections as the commonly used motifs of two and three nucleotides, and
they can be exploited as genetic markers with little additional effort.

Background
Microsatellites have been defined as tandem direct repeats

of motifs (subsequences) of one to six bases [1], and minisatellites as tandem direct repeats of longer motifs. Adja-

cent repeats comprise a microsatellite locus, which may be
simple if there is only one motif, or compound, if there
are two or more adjacent blocks of repeated motifs separated by less than some maximum gap of nonrepeated
sequence [2]. Microsatellites have been classified as perfect, having no variation among the repeated motifs
within the locus, or imperfect, with less than some tolerated percentage (e.g., 10%) of deviant nucleotides over
the entire locus. The minimum microsatellite locus has
spanned 12 to 20 bases in a number of studies [3-7],
although polymorphism has been found to be higher in
those at least 20 nucleotides long [8].
Microsatellites are frequently polymorphic within populations or species, and therefore have been widely used as
markers in genetic mapping, fingerprinting, and population genetics. New alleles are thought to arise facilely by
replication slippage or unequal crossing over at meiosis
[9], or by gene conversion [10,11]. To some extent, the
same usefulness and evolutionary mechanisms apply to
minisatellites. Until relatively recently, the software tools
for identifying short, tandemly repeated subsequences
have been directed at microsatellites [12-15], although
one tool, the Tandem Repeats Finder [16], can currently
detect repeated subsequences of any motif length less
than 2000 nucleotides. Meanwhile, studies of longer
repetitive elements have concentrated on sequences of a
few hundred to a few thousand base pairs, e.g., transposable elements, that (with the exception of 5S and 18S-28S
ribosomal RNA genes) are generally dispersed in the
genome and do not form large tandem arrays with varying
copy number. Repetitive subsequences between these
length classes remain less analyzed.
Collections of ESTs (expressed sequence tags derived by
reverse transcription of messenger RNA) have proven valuable as sources of microsatellite markers. In part, this is
because there are many distinct EST sequences in databases [17], microsatellites occur preferentially in nonrepetitive DNA [18] (but see [19] for a contrasting view),
and because most EST sequence represents expressed
genes that occur singly or in small families in the genome.
It also accords with the relatively conserved nature of
expressed sequence in relation to the chaotic melange of
rapidly evolving repetitive sequences that comprise the
bulk of plant genomes [20]; therefore, microsatellite
markers derived from the ESTs of one species are likely to
be useful in related species [3]. The diminished transferability of microsatellite markers among more distantly
related species raises the question of the rate at which such
sequences and their flanking sequences evolve, and
whether the distribution of microsatellite types carries any
phylogenetic information.

Before I was aware of the capacity of Tandem Repeats
Finder [16] to identify repeats of minisatellite motifs, I
wrote a generic repeat finder in C and several Perl scripts
to identify distinct microsatellite loci, group sufficiently
close loci into compound loci, condense the collection of
microsatellite-bearing sequences to a nonredundant EST
set by means of phrap [21], identify likely polymorphisms
within the collection, and select plausible PCR primers
with primer3 [22]. The resulting pipeline processes any
FASTA-formatted sequence collection, which can be
highly redundant, and outputs a list of relatively nonredundant microsatellite loci with position, motif, degree of
observed polymorphism in the collection, and primers.
The findings of this pipeline are here reported and statistically characterized for 88 genera of vascular plants, each
represented by a collection of at least 3000 EST sequences
in GenBank as of 15 October 2005. Also reported are the
results of a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of
the motif frequencies, to express the similarity of these
motif frequencies among genera and to relate similarity in
microsatellite spectrum to more conventional, broadly
based measures of their phylogeny. These findings can be
used to test the hypotheses that repeated subsequences are
subject to natural selection and that their evolution
reflects the evolution of their host genomes.

Results
Scope
This study used a custom pipeline to identify repeated
subsequences from 1 to 250 bases long in 6793306
sequences and 3681160063 nucleotides from 88 genera
of vascular plants. The phrap step reduced the total
number of nucleotides to 836433533 in the nonredundant set, for a 77.3% reduction of total sequence length.
The genera ranged from Selaginella to members of the
Poaceae and Asteraceae, and gymnosperms, Poaceae, and
Solanaceae were comparatively well represented, with at
least five genera each. The analysis was repeated three
times for each genus, allowing for zero, one, or two singlenucleotide mismatches over all copies of the motif in the
repeat locus. In this way, the analysis considered perfect
microsatellites, and imperfect microsatellites with a 10%
tolerance at minimum locus lengths of 15 and 20 nucleotides. Microsatellites are reported as simple, if they occur
in isolation, and compound, if they occur within five
bases of another microsatellite. All frequencies are
reported from nonredundant sequence as recognized by
phrap within the pipeline.
Frequency by motif length
Figure 1 shows on a log scale the abundance of microsatellites and minisatellites per megabase in relation to motif
length for zero, one, or two allowed mismatched nucleotides. Major shifts in abundance of short motifs reflect the
differing threshold values for a minimal microsatellite as

relatively little from the frequencies expected from random sequence. Because of the longer minimum locus
length with two mismatches, the observed frequency of
motifs from 10 through 12 nucleotides was close to the
expectation with random sequence. The expected frequencies lacked the observed peaks for motif lengths that were
integral multiples of 3 and were many orders of magnitude lower than the observed frequencies for motifs
longer than 20 nucleotides.

the number of allowed mismatches varies. Above decamer
motifs there appear periodic peaks wherever the motif
length modulus three is zero, i.e., where the minisatellite
cannot change the reading frame of the message. This pattern holds even though the abundance of loci with two
allowed mismatches falls short of that for zero or one
allowed mismatch. The pattern breaks down for motifs
longer than 150 bases, largely because the distribution by
length becomes discontinuous. These zero values (actually negative infinities) appear at 0.001 in Figure 1. The
peak at 228 bases was real and appeared in 13 genera,
including dicots, monocots, and a gymnosperm. All 27
instances were related to one another at the peptide level,
at a maximum e-value of 7e-21 in a mutual tblastx search.
A tblastx of an instance from Triticum aestivum revealed no
relationship to repetitive elements in RepBase [23], but
blastn versus GenBank hit numerous ubiquitin sequences
at 1e-69.
The observed motif-length frequencies were compared to
those expected from Equations 1 and 2 (given in Materials
and Methods) for the pooled sequences of 12 taxonomically divergent genera: Aquilegia, Brassica, Citrus, Euphorbia, Festuca, Gossypium, Helianthus, Ipomoea, Lotus,
Mesembryanthemum, Nicotiana, and Prunus. These genera
had relatively large EST collections that were still small
enough to be processed by phrap without subdivision. As
shown in Supplementary Table 1 (see Additional File 1),
for most motif lengths the observed repeat frequencies
greatly exceeded those expected with random sequence
having the same length distribution. Overall, the observed
excess was greatest with zero allowed mismatches and
least with two. With one allowed mismatch, the observed
frequencies of motifs of eight to 11 nucleotides differed

Frequency by motif type
Supplementary Table 2 (see Additional File 2) presents
per-megabase frequencies of all 501 canonical single-base
through six-base motifs in perfect microsatellites for all 88
genera. Its sister tables, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 (see
Additional Files 3 and 4), respectively present the same
data for microsatellites with one or two allowed mismatches within the microsatellite locus. These frequencies
are itemized for simple, compound, and total loci, and for
the fraction of simple loci to simple plus compound loci,
as listed in the "Type" column of each table and defined
fully in the Abbreviations. The "Type" column of Supplementary Tables 2, 3, and 4 also designates lines for the
repeat count and frequency of polymorphism for each
canonical motif, itemized for simple loci and submotifs in
compound loci, as coded in the Abbreviations. All submotifs within a compound locus were counted as polymorphic if any one of them was, since polymorphism was
scored by locus. In Supplementary Tables 2, 3, and 4, the
third column is the mean frequency of the respective
motif and quantity over all 88 genera. Table 1 combines
these mean frequencies over the six length classes to provide a collective view of behavior in regard to motif
length.

Table 1 shows that trinucleotides are the most abundant
motif in simple perfect microsatellites, followed consecutively by dinucleotides, hexanucleotides, pentanucleotides, mononucleotides, and tetranucleotides. In
contrast, tetranucleotide motifs are the most common in
compound perfect microsatellites, followed by trinucleotides, pentanucleotides, hexanucleotides, dinucleotides,
and mononucleotides. The total frequency is dominated
by the compound microsatellites and follows the same
ranking. The fraction of simple to total perfect microsatellites is highest for mononucleotide and trinucleotide
motifs, followed by dinucleotides, hexanucleotides, pentanucleotides, and tetranucleotides. The mean repeat
count in simple and compound microsatellites was highest for mononucleotide motifs and decreased with
increasing motif length, as expected from the minimum
length thresholds necessary to complete a locus of at least
15 nucleotides. The mean repeat count was also higher in
simple than in compound microsatellites for the same
motif, also as expected from the threshold lengths to

declare a microsatellite. Hexanucleotide motifs were the
most likely to be polymorphic in simple microsatellites;
tetranucleotide, trinucleotide, pentanucleotide, dinucleotide, and mononucleotide motifs were consecutively less
likely to be polymorphic. In compound microsatellites,
polymorphism was most likely in hexanucleotide motifs,
then trinucleotide, pentanucleotide, tetranucleotide,
dinucleotide, and mononucleotide motifs, and the frequencies were lower than in simple microsatellites. Overall, perfect simple microsatellites were significantly more
polymorphic than perfect compound microsatellites by
0.176 to 0.137 (p = 1.03e-13 in a paired t-test).
Increased microsatellite frequencies were expected with
one allowed mismatch, because the minimum locus size
was 15 nucleotides as in perfect microsatellites. The
observed increase ranged from 1.1 to 2.4-fold for simple
microsatellites, being greatest for pentanucleotide motifs
and least for dinucleotide motifs. For compound microsatellites, the increase was from 1.2 to 14.7-fold, except for
a 72% reduction for tetranucleotide motifs, which possibly were being recognized at other motif lengths. Again,
the increase was greatest for pentanucleotide motifs.
Allowing a mismatch also changed the ranking of frequencies by motif length; with one mismatch, the ranking
ran trinucleotides, pentanucleotides, dinucleotides,
mononucleotides, hexanucleotides, and tetranucleotides

in simple microsatellites, and pentanucleotides, hexanucleotides, trinucleotides, tetranucleotides, dinucleotides,
and mononucleotides in compound microsatellites. The
frequencies of total microsatellites were ranked in the
same order as the frequencies of compound microsatellites. The ratio of simple to total microsatellites increased
with one mismatch for dinucleotide, trinucleotide, and
tetranucleotide motifs, and decreased with mononucleotide, pentanucleotide, and hexanucleotide motifs. The
decrease for hexanucleotides was nearly 90%. The ratio
was highest for trinucleotide motifs, then mononucleotide, dinucleotide, tetranucleotide, hexanucleotide, and
pentanucleotide motifs. Allowing one mismatch did not
greatly change the mean repeat count per locus for simple
microsatellites, which again tracked the minimum length
criteria for different motif lengths. Allowing a single mismatch did increase the mean repeat count for motifs of
four or fewer nucleotides in compound microsatellites. A
single mismatch had little effect on the fraction of polymorphic loci, although this fraction increased about
0.015 for motifs of four or fewer nucleotides in compound microsatellites, and trinucleotides replaced hexanucleotides as the class with highest polymorphism in
compound microsatellites.
Allowing two mismatches and increasing the minimum
locus length from 15 to 20 nucleotides reduced the fre-

quencies of both simple and compound microsatellites
up to 150-fold from their values with one mismatch, and
reversed their relationship so that simples were 83%
(dinucleotides) to 93% (pentanucleotides) of the total. In
simple microsatellites, trinucleotide motifs were most
abundant, then dinucleotide, hexanucleotide, pentanucleotide, mononucleotide, and tetranucleotide. The ranking was the same for compound and total microsatellites,
except that mononucleotide motifs ranked ahead of pentanucleotide motifs. In accordance with the greater length
criteria for a minimal microsatellite with two mismatches,
the repeat counts were higher for all motif lengths for
both simple and compound microsatellites, and fell with
increasing motif length. In simple microsatellites, hexanucleotide motifs were the most likely to be polymorphic,
then tetranucleotides, pentanucleotides, trinucleotides,
dinucleotides, and mononucleotides. In compound loci,
the order was trinucleotides, pentanucleotides, tetranucleotides, dinucleotides, hexanucleotides, and mononucleotides. Mononucleotide motifs were least likely to be
polymorphic in simple and compound loci over all three
numbers of allowed mismatches.
Mean frequencies of eight microsatellite characteristics
appear in the third column of Supplementary Tables 2, 3,
and 4 (see Additional Files 2, 3, and 4). These frequencies
were ranked in descending order within motif length
classes to produce Supplementary Tables 5, 6, and 7 (see
Additional Files 5, 6, and 7), respectively for zero, one, or
two allowed mismatches. Supplementary Tables 8, 9, and
10 (see Additional Files 8, 9, and 10) list in descending
order the numbers of genera for which each motif was top
ranked, again respectively for zero, one, or two allowed
mismatches. Every canonical motif appears in these
tables, but 16 hexanucleotide motifs were less than
0.0005 in total frequency with two allowed mismatches:
AAACGT, AACGTT, AACTAT, AACTCT, AAGCGT,
AAGCTT, AAGTAT, ACCGGT, ACCTAT, ACGCGT, ACGTAG, ACGTAT, AGCGCT, AGGCCT, ATATCG, and
ATGCGC.
There was a single clearly most abundant motif for mononucleotides (A), dinucleotides (AG), and trinucleotides
(AAG). The most abundant motifs in tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide, and hexanucleotide microsatellites were
AAAG, AAAAG, AAAAAG, or motifs with A and two or
three Gs, but these were relatively less abundant than the
top-ranked loci with shorter motifs. PolyA motifs ending
in a single T or C were also abundant overall, but other
runs of a single letter were not particularly common.
Motif rankings diverged between simple and compound
loci with increasing motif length. Simple loci were typically from 5 to 20% of all loci with zero or one mismatch,
but at least 80% of loci were simple with two allowed mismatches.

Correlations among microsatellite properties
Table 2 gives rank correlation coefficients (Spearman's
rho, calculated using R [24]) for seven types of comparisons at each mismatch level and motif length from three
through six. The comparisons are designated according to
the same codes as the "Type" column in Supplementary
Table 2. The null hypothesis was no correlation at all.
Although R could not calculate exact p-values in the presence of ties in rank, it did produce approximate p-values
that were accepted for the determination of significance.
These p-values for the combined motif lengths usually
tracked the p-values for hexanucleotide motifs, which
contributed 350 out of the combined 501 data values.
Motif frequency was strongly, positively correlated
between compound and simple loci, although the correlation weakened for hexanucleotide motifs. Repeat count
was less strongly correlated between compound and simple loci, although the correlation was highly significant
for hexanucleotide and collective repeats, and for tetranucleotide motifs with one or two mismatches. Polymorphism was uncorrelated between simple and compound
loci with zero or two mismatches; the correlations with
one mismatch were low to moderate, but mostly significant. Repeat count was not significantly correlated to frequency of simple loci, except in hexanucleotide motifs
and the collective motifs that they dominated. Repeat
count was more correlated to frequency for compound
loci, where pentanucleotides also reached significant values with one or two mismatches. Polymorphism was significantly correlated to repeat count in simple and
compound loci with hexanucleotide motifs and collectively, but not for shorter motifs, and the correlations for
trinucleotide motifs were mostly somewhat negative.

Values of the eight traits defined in the Abbreviations are
listed versus motif length and GC content for perfect microsatellites in Table 3, for one mismatch in Table 4, and
for two mismatches in Table 5. Monoclinal trends with
respect to GC content were uncommon; examples include
repeat count in simple trinucleotide loci, which declined
with increasing GC over all three mismatch levels, and
total frequency in tetranucleotide loci with zero or one
mismatches. A simple peak or dip sometimes was
observed, e.g., the total frequency of hexanucleotide loci
with 2/3 GC was minimal with zero mismatches, and the
polymorphism of simple pentanucleotide loci with 3/5
GC was maximal with zero or one mismatch. More generally, there were two peaks or dips in the pattern. The patterns were fitted to a quadratic model of the form y = a +
bx + cx2, using function glm() in R, to produce Supplementary Table 11 (see Additional File 11). The significance of coefficients in this table is based on t-values, and
151 of the 288 reported coefficients differed significantly
from zero at p <= 0.05. There were 54 coefficients that
were significant at p <= 0.01, and 50 more that were sig-

The GC content of microsatellites was correlated with GC
content of the entire transcriptome of each genus, but the
correlation diminished for short motifs with two mismatches, where the recognized microsatellite loci were
longer. Over all perfect microsatellites, Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.960; with one allowed mismatch, it
was 0.984; and for two mismatches, it was 0.971. The
respective values for loci or subloci based on two- to sixbase motifs were 0.953, 0.978, and 0.865, for zero, one, or
two allowed mismatches. Microsatellite GC content outpaced increases in transcriptome GC content; the GC content of microsatellites in GC-rich transcriptomes exceeded
the transcriptome's GC content, and the GC content of
microsatellites in GC-poor transcriptomes fell short of the
transcriptome's GC content. For perfect microsatellites,
the regression slopes of microsatellite to whole-transcriptomic GC content (y = a + bx by glm in R) were 2.06 for
two- through six-base motifs, and 1.96 for all motifs.
These slopes respectively became 1.85 and 1.71 for one
mismatch, and 2.54 and 1.79 for two mismatches. All of
these values differed from zero at p-values less than 1e-16,
as did all their intercepts. Fitting a quadratic model (y = a
+ bx + cx2) gave positive intercepts that did not differ significantly from zero, negative b that did not differ significantly from zero, and positive c between 1.72 and 4.54
that was not significant for short motifs with two mismatches, or significant at 0.082 for all motifs in perfect
microsatellites, down to 0.005 for short motifs with a single allowed mismatch. The significant values of c were
between 1.72 and 2.61.
The GC content of microsatellites and minisatellites did
not vary in proportion to motif length between 1 and 250
bases; the regression coefficients for a linear model (y = a
+ bx) were 6.26e-5, 3.13e-5, and 4.25e-5 for zero, one, or
two mismatches, none of which differed significantly
from zero. However, the slope between 1 and 90 base
pairs was significantly negative at p < 0.0005 for motif
lengths integrally divisible by 3 in all three mismatch
classes. Also, GC content spiked at integral multiples of

three (Fig. 2) for motif lengths up to 90. Motifs that frameshifted their message had a significantly lower GC content
that those that preserved the reading frame, at p-values
less than 6e-12 in t-tests, regardless of mismatch level.
Motifs that shifted their reading frame by one nucleotide
did not differ significantly in GC content from those that
shifted their reading frame by two nucleotides.
Comparative microsatellite frequencies among taxa
Top ranking was well distributed among genera for the
149 dinucleotide through pentanucleotide motifs. For
perfect microsatellites, 42 genera ranked first in frequency
of at least one motif. For one allowed mismatching
nucleotide, 26 genera ranked first, and for two allowed
mismatching nucleotides, 50 genera ranked first. In contrast, one genus, Pisum, ranked last (0) for 69 of these
motifs, in accordance with its smallest nonredundant
sample size of 1076 nonredundant sequences.

Similarity was tested by mean Euclidean distance within
groups of related genera for total frequency in simple plus
compound loci, repeat count in simple loci, and frequency of polymorphism in simple loci. This mean distance was compared to the distribution of 20000 mean
distances in groups of the same size for the same character
and number of allowed mismatches, drawn at random
without replacement from the set of all 88 genera. The distance is based on the 499 canonical dinucleotide through
hexanucleotide motifs; A and C were excluded, because
either can appear spuriously in low-resolution sequence,
and A can represent untrimmed polyA tails, especially any
polyA trapped in chimeric clones. The results appear in

nificant at p <= 0.001. The coefficients were particularly
likely to be significant for pentanucleotide motifs with a
single mismatch and for intercepts in general. The coefficients of the linear and quadratic terms were more likely
to be significant for abundance than for the other traits,
and usually the linear coefficient was negative and the
quadratic coefficient was positive for abundance. The relative abundance of simple and compound loci did not
respond much to GC content, and neither did the repeat
count at any number of mismatches. Polymorphism frequently had a significantly negative quadratic coefficient,
especially with zero or one mismatch in pentanucleotide
and hexanucleotide motifs, meaning that the GC-rich
motifs were overall less polymorphic.

Tables 6, 7, and 8 for 18 groups ranging in diversity from
the grass subfamilies Pooideae and Panicoideae to the three
included non-seed plants. Genera were significantly close
together for total frequency in the conifers, Solanaceae,
and Asteraceae, at all three allowed numbers of mismatches. Otherwise, total motif frequencies for genera
within the indicated families and orders were not significantly closer than expected by chance. Also, there were no
significant differences of observed mean distances from
random expectation for repeat count in these three tables.
Mean distances for polymorphism were significantly close
only for the three lower vascular plants with zero or two
mismatches, meaning that their average degree of polymorphism for each motif was significantly similar.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/173

A second measure of intergeneric similarity is mean rank
difference in particular motif frequencies, which is presented respectively for zero, one, and two mismatches in
Supplementary Tables 12, 13, and 14 (see Additional Files
12, 13, and 14). Here the null hypothesis is that the frequency of the given motif for the same number of genera
was drawn at random from the entire set of 88 genera. The
three tables present only those motifs with a 0.01 or lower
probability of being ranked as they were by chance. Since
only the 149 canonical motifs of two through five nucleotides were used, about 1.5 motifs are expected to be significant at p <= 0.01 for each group. With zero allowed
mismatches, four of 18 natural groupings (Malphigiales,
Lamiales, Asparagales, and "other monocots") did not
exceed two significant motifs, versus two groups (Malphi-

nine groups ("lower vascular plants", "other gymnosperms", Caryophyllales, Rosaceae, Malphigiales, Lamiales, Asteraceae, Asparagales, and "other monocots") with
two allowed mismatches. There were fewest similarly
ranked motifs within families and orders when two mismatches were allowed, and most when one mismatch was
allowed. In part, rank consistency of a family or order
depended on its values versus the mean for all 88 genera;
families with very high or very low frequencies were more
likely to exhibit a consistent ranking among the sampled
genera. Since GC-rich motifs were especially abundant in
Poaceae, the Poaceae had numerous GC-rich motifs that
ranked more consistently than expected by chance. However, the Solanaceae ranked tightly for 5 to 16 motifs in
spite of their low to middling frequencies. The Asteraceae,
which like the Solanaceae exhibited a significantly low
mean Euclidean distance among its genera, did not cohere
as well in rankings, even though it had 52% of its rankings

Phylogenetic analysis of microsatellite frequencies
The program contml (continuous character maximum
likelihood) in phylip 3.65 [25] used the 149 canonical
two-base through five-base motif frequencies to construct
three maximum-likelihood trees (Figs. 3, 4, and 5), one
per level of allowed mismatches, that provide a convenient basis to consider intergeneric similarities. Each maximum-likelihood tree was the most likely tree to result
from 300 trials with different input orders of the genera
and global branch rearrangements of the initially formed
tree. While it is not probable that a globally most likely
tree was ever found, the greatest log-likelihoods were similar among runs within each number of allowed mismatches. However, the maximum found natural-loglikelihood differed greatly among the number of allowed
mismatches (-25793.86 with none, -33852.89 with one,

and -6671.66 with two), as did the mean Euclidean distance among all 88 genera (189.34 with none, 326.85
with one, and 55.18 with two). The mean Euclidean distances for total frequency within groups of related genera,
as recognized in Tables 6 and 8, were significantly lower
(p < 1e-06) when two mismatches were allowed. The
longer motifs appeared to be more uniform among all
vascular plants, and the recognized sequences were more
random with two allowed mismatches. However, it is difficult to conclude from the likelihoods or mean distances
that any one level of mismatches produced a more realistic phylogeny than did the others.

among their members for dinucleotide through hexanucleotide motifs appears after the taxonomic groupings in
Tables 6, 7, and 8. The mean rank differences among their
members for dinucleotide through pentanucleotide

mentary Tables 12, 13, and 14 specify the motifs that most
likely determined the placement of the group members in
their respective maximum likelihood trees.
The most prominent clade in all three trees consisted of 11
to 13 out of 15 total genera of grasses (Poaceae), although
Cynodon and one to three other genera fell outside of it in
each case. Within the grass clade, members of the subfamilies Pooideae and Panicoideae freely interdigitated,
although Lolium consistently associated with Festuca, and
four genera of the pooid tribe Triticeae grouped together
for perfect microsatellites. This clade exhibited increasing
GC content distally, which is evident from the generally
higher ranking of individual GC-rich motifs for the distal
group 15 over group 16 in Supplementary Table 12, group
12 over group 13 in Supplementary Table 13, and group
14 over group 15 in Supplementary Table 14. This
increased ranking was coordinated over many motifs and
could reflect a general response to GC content of the transcriptome.
Another durable grouping included Allium and most of
the gymnosperms (groups 2 and 3 in Supplementary
Table 12, groups 1 and 2 in Supplementary Table 13),
which ranked low for various motifs. The ferns Adiantum
and Ceratopteris also ranked low for their most consistent
motifs. Glycine, Populus, and Vitis grouped together in all
three mismatch levels, with high rankings for AAAAT,
AAAT, AAAC, and similar motifs with runs of A. Citrus,
Poncirus, and Mimulus also clustered together at each mismatch level; Tamarix associated with these three with zero
or two allowed mismatches, and Lycoris associated with
these three with zero or one mismatch. Acorus, Ananas,
and Eucalyptus associated for zero or two mismatches, but
went to separate branches with one mismatch. Thellungiella grouped with Brassica with zero mismatches, Arabidopsis with two mismatches, and neither with one
mismatch. The main message of Supplementary Tables
12, 13, and 14, is that there are few prominent groups that
remain consistent over numbers of mismatches or minimum locus length. In particular, the Solanaceae, which

cluster close together in terms of Euclidean distance, did
not cluster in any of the trees, except that Solanum grouped
with Lycopersicon with zero or two allowed mismatches.
Similarly, the Asteraceae resided in four groups for perfect
microsatellites, two groups for one allowed mismatch,
and five groups for two allowed mismatches, even though
their genera were significantly close together by Euclidean
distance. Furthermore, there was no particular correlation
of GC-content or GC-rich motif frequencies to higher
taxa. Apart from the Poaceae, the microsatellites of monocots were not particularly GC-rich, and one monocot
(Lycoris) had the second most AT-rich microsatellites of all
88 genera for zero or one allowed mismatch, even though
its EST collection ranked 21st in AT content for zero mismatches.
Microsatellite frequency in relation to genome size
The total per-megabase frequency of perfect microsatellites was inversely correlated with genome size. This was
evident anecdotally from the lowest ranking genera in
microsatellite frequency (Table 9), all of which (where
known) exceeded the median 2c value of 2.56 pg for EST
sequence donors in the 78 genera where DNA content was
available [26-28]. The negative correlation was also evident by linear regression of microsatellite frequency
against 1c DNA content over these same genera. When all
78 genera were considered together, the regression slope
was -21.77 loci per picogram of 1c DNA content (p =
0.036), whereas without the Poaceae the slope was -20.43
(p = 0.008). The correlation was not significant within the
Poaceae, although the slope was still negative (-10.71, p =
0.90), because Zea has a smaller genome and a lower microsatellite frequency than the pooid genera Triticum, Hordeum, Secale, Avena, Festuca, and Lolium. Nevertheless, Zea
has arguably the largest monoploid genome in the panicoid grasses, and it has likely expanded recently during its
evolution, apart from its doubled chromosome number
[29]. However, this negative correlation almost disappeared when gymnosperms were excluded from the sample (slope = -6.44, p = 0.69), indicating a more direct
relationship to phylogeny than to genome size per se.

When total perfect microsatellite frequencies were itemized by motif length and regressed versus 1c DNA content
over all 78 available genera, the resulting slopes were significantly negative for dinucleotide (-5.04, p = 0.00096)
and trinucleotide (-7.62, p = 0.0064) motifs, but not for
tetranucleotide motifs (-2.88, p = 0.42). Within the
Poaceae, the slopes were negative but not significantly so
(p > 0.30), and without the Poaceae, the slopes became
even more significant for di- and trinucleotide motifs, and
remained nonsignificant (p = 0.37) for tetranucleotide
motifs. Finally, without the gymnosperms, the slopes
were negative but not significant for all three motif
lengths.
To test the possibility that the transcriptomes of these
large-genomed genera are being diluted by transcription
of transposable elements, which might be more abundant
in large genomes, the phrap-generated singlets and contigs of Allium, Picea, Pinus, Arabidopsis, Glycine, and Oryza,
were subjected to tblastx versus RepBase 3.11 at a cut-off
e-value of 1e-10. The respective 2c values of these genera
are 33.5, 40.4, 44.2, 0.32, 1.14, and 1.00 pg [26,28], when
tetraploidy is accounted for in Glycine. The percentage of
sequences matching repetitive elements was 16.9 in
Oryza, 3.9 in Allium and Glycine, 3.5 in Pinus, 2.8 in Picea,
and 2.7 in Arabidopsis, which did not fit the expectation
that the three large genomes would have the three highest
percentages.
Sources of long motifs
There are three interesting sources of repeated long motifs:
repeated domains in proteins, tandem repeats in transcribed repetitive elements such as retrotransposons, and
exon repetition resulting from mRNA editing. Several tactics were tried to quantify these sources. The first was to
tblastx the 18374 repeated motifs of 30 or more nucleotides, derived from all 88 genera, against RepBase 3.11.
These hits were frequent (0.298 of the sequences hit at an
e-value less than 1, and the mean was 7.57 matched
amino acids per hit) but unimpressive, mostly with e-values greater than 0.01. This was because the motifs were
generally short and incompletely matched, representing a
nonconservative subsequence in the repetitive element.
This led to the second tactic, Monte Carlo simulation of
sequences that matched the real repeated motifs in length,
followed by tblastx against RepBase. The simulation took
independent account of codon usage in each genus
(which will be presented elsewhere), and 0.252 of the
simulated motifs hit at an e-value less than 1, with a mean
of 7.85 matched amino acids per hit. Although these are
close to the observed values for the real motifs, a onesided, paired-data t-test gave t = 4.742 for hits per query
and t = -2.952 for identical amino acids per hit, both of
which were significant at p = 0.002 with 261 degrees of
freedom (88 genera, 3 allowed mismatches, and two com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/173

binations that gave no long motifs). Thus there were significantly more hits in the real data, but the hits were
shorter than in the simulation, and hits to random
sequence could account for about 85 percent of the
observed frequency.
The third tactic was tblastx of the whole sequences that
contained the long motifs against RepBase. Because of the
longer query sequences, the cutoff e-value was decreased
to 0.01, but still 8850 sequences hit out of 18374 distinct
long-motif-bearing sequences. Furthermore, there were a
few close matches to repetitive elements: 3211 (0.175 of
the total) hit at 1e-10, 644 (0.035 of the total) hit at 1e20, 141 (0.008) hit at 1e-30, 38 (0.002) hit at 1e-60, and
the closest hit was to a CINFUL2A_I element at 1e-144. At
an e-value of 1e-10, the most frequently hit elements were
ENSPM4_OS (1012 hits out of 3211 total), ENSPM7_OS
(198 hits), MERMITE18D (633 hits), TREP60 (424 hits),
SZ-6IN (225 hits), MUDRN3_OS (67 hits),
XILON1_ZM_LTR (64 hits), and CACTA-L (59 hits). There
were 20 hits to CINFUL2A_I at 1e-10, and 14 of them
were closer than 1e-60. Other slowly evolving elements
that were hit at 1e-60 or less included HUCK1-LTR_ZM (7
hits) and ZEON1_ZM (3 hits). Thus tblastx of the whole
sequences also suggests that 15 to 20% of the long motifs
are direct repeats within transcribed repetitive elements.
High copy numbers of long motifs were particularly well
represented in Populus, Pinus, Lycopersicon, Solanum, and
Helianthus. Many of the longest repeats were reported as
parts of compound microsatellites having several submotifs of equal length. Two examples of such loci are presented in Fig. 6. Both examples were imperfect simple
repeats of a long motif, with more mismatches over
repeats than were allowed in this study. The appearance of
a compound locus resulted from the interruption of the
locus by more than two mismatches, often resulting in the
same repeated subsequence being recognized in more
than one frame at different positions within the locus.
With blastx unfiltered for low-complexity sequence (-F F),
the first sequence in Fig. 6 (CF446675.1 from Allium cepa)
hits a number of cell-wall or membrane proteins from vascular plants and algae. In containing domains of proline,
serine, and lysine, it is similar to CAA84230, an extensin
from maize pollen, although the closest matches (1e-61)
are to algal pherophorin proteins. The second sequence,
BE430767.1 from Triticum aestivum, is a high-molecularweight glutenin; the closest blastx hits are around 1e-80.
In a blastx search of all 77 sequences from all 88 genera
with at least six copies of a motif of at least 18 nucleotides,
63 sequences hit proteins in GenBank's nr database at evalues less than 1e-08. However, 30 of the hits were to the
same entry, XP_344805.1, a putative protein from rat.
These 30 sequences, which contained a 23-mer that was

repeated up to 31 times in Populus euphratica (GenBank
accession AJ770915.1), came from P. euphratica, Populus
tremula x Populus tremuloides, Lycopersicon esculentum, Helianthus argophyllus, and Pinus taeda. The persistent redundancy suggests that the sequences represent a small
multigene family that is widely distributed in
angiosperms and gymnosperms.

Discussion
The 77% reduction of total sequence length from redundant to nonredundant datasets in this study compares to
an 85% reduction in number of ESTs from redundant to
nonredundant datasets in [3]. Since the current study
attempted to conserve deviant repeat loci as much as possible, it is likely that limited redundancy remains in the
repeat loci reported here. This residual redundancy could
distort the repeat frequencies somewhat from their values
in the coding genomic sequence. There is a conflict
between the goals of mining every microsatellite from an
EST collection, and accurately extracting the motif frequencies from the coding sequence.
The slowest step of the pipeline is phrap, followed by the
initial repeat finder. The run time of the phrap step is
strongly influenced by the amount and pattern of redundancy within the dataset. The run time of the repeat finder
increases quadratically with the number of motif lengths
sought and linearly with the length of examined
sequence; this time is small for motifs of less than 10
nucleotides. Although the repeat finder's algorithm is not
particularly efficient, it is effective, and larger datasets can
be divided and run in parallel.
The decision to allow the independent reporting of short
and long repeats from the same subsequence, so that
embedded classical microsatellites would not be overlooked in longer repetitive sequences, inflated the
reported count of motifs that are part of very long motifs,
probably by several percent.
The necessity to repeat phrap on large datasets probably
merges distinct but similar sequences excessively, leading
to a loss of microsatellites but also a canceling loss of
"nonredundant" sequence to host them. The effect is not
consistent, but it might be responsible for the low
reported microsatellite frequencies in Zea.
Low-quality sequence was not completely excluded from
the analysis. Particularly bothersome are relatively short
tracts of low-quality sequence within otherwise accurate
sequence, since these can appear as tracts of a single
nucleotide and inflate the count of microsatellite motifs
like AAAC, AAAG, and AAAT. Any rules-based removal of
such subsequences would likely also remove legitimate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/173

instances of motifs that contain runs of a single nucleotide.
The observed satellite frequencies exceed those expected
by chance in random sequence at every motif length and
mismatch level, but the difference was least (and probably
not significant) for eight- through 11-base motifs with
one or two allowed mismatches. A more realistic model of
random codon order, taking into account the observed
codon preference of the sequences, probably would yield
higher expected repeat frequencies. Such a model could
provide testable predictions of relative motif frequencies
to be expected in random sequence, that could be compared to the ranking of observed frequencies.
The low microsatellite frequency in Allium and conifers,
which have very large diploid genomes with 2c > 20 pg,
runs counter to the intuitive expectation that large
genomes should have more and longer microsatellites
[30]. However, studies in a grasshopper [30], fungi [31],
and vertebrates [32] have demonstrated that the frequency and length of genomic microsatellite loci are not
correlated to 2c DNA content. The loss of significantly
negative correlation upon excluding gymnosperms
accords with a relationship to phylogeny more than to
genome size in itself, and thus plants probably resemble
animals in their relationship of microsatellite frequency
to genome size. An open question is how much the transcriptome is diluted by the individually infrequent transcription of a multitude of microsatellite-poor repetitive
elements in large genomes. The tblastx results for six genera here indicate no correlation of transposable-element
transcription to genome size. Instead, the transposable
elements of Oryza might only be better known and more
represented in RepBase than the rest, even though full
genomic sequence is available for both Oryza and Arabidopsis.
Polymorphism is as frequent for pentanucleotide and
hexanucleotide motifs as it is for the classical di- and trinucleotide microsatellites, although the repeat counts are
lower. Such loci ought to be considered as potential
genetic markers.
The pipeline offers primers to amplify most of the
detected repeats, but the success of amplification depends
upon the nonredundancy of the primer sequences in the
genome, the distribution of primers among exons, and
the success of phrap in reconstructing consensus EST
sequences. The EST sequences provide little information
about primer redundancy in the genome, since they do
not include nontranscribed sequence, which comprises
most of the genome, and since many genes belong to multigene families of varying size and complexity. The mature
sequences also do not provide the locations of splice sites,

Page 18 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:173

and amplification will fail if a suggested primer straddles
a splice site or if suggested primers are separated by too
large an intron. Finally, there is always a chance that
phrap has misassembled similar sequences, such that a
primer pair suggested from a contig has no identical spacing or even identity in the genome.
Contamination of the EST databases with ribosomal RNA
seems to be minimal, or the length of individual rRNA
genes exceeds the 250-base cutoff used in this study. The
amount of contamination with untranscribed genomic
sequence remains unknown in these collections.
Microsatellite sequences often evolve faster than the taxa
that bear them, although closest relatives usually retain
similar microsatellite frequencies. This holds not only for
frequency but also for polymorphism and especially
mean repeat count, and it is consistent with the limited
transferability of microsatellites among less related species. Repeated subsequences are probably subject to natural selection, like almost anything else that is transcribed.
Several other studies have reported motif frequencies
from individual genera that were analyzed here. Supplementary Table 15 (see Additional File 15) presents frequencies of di- and trinucleotide motifs in perfect, simple
microsatellite loci reported elsewhere from 16 genera,
along with the minimum lengths of the loci, for comparison with the results reported here. A few reports provided
only the most abundant motifs, or reported the same
canonical motif as two or more variants that were
summed for the table. Wherever all four dinucleotide
motifs were given, the reported frequency ranking
matched that observed here, except in Citrus, where the
minimum dinucleotide locus was only 12 nucleotides.
The relative frequencies of trinucleotide motifs differed
more among genera and between studies, because of differences in sample size and the handling of EST redundancy. This affects mostly the lower-ranking motifs. In
some cases, not all of the possible motifs were reported,
and possibly they had not been searched for. It is not clear
what happened with Pinus, which does not accord with
the current results or with the frequencies in the related
genus Picea. Overall, the dinucleotide motifs rank as AG,
AT, AC, and CG, but conifers, Gossypium, and Ipomoea rank
AT, AG, AC, and CG. The present study more consistently
ranks AAT and ACT last or close to last than do the cited
reports, and it uniformly ranks CCG first in the Poaceae.
Kantety et al. [3] also reported frequencies by motif length
in Triticum, Hordeum, Oryza, Sorghum, and Zea, using minimum locus lengths of 18 nucleotides for dinucleotide
and trinucleotide motifs and 20 nucleotides for tetranucleotide motifs. Motifs of two, three, or four nucleotides

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/173

respectively represented 19, 72, and 9 percent of the total,
in modest contrast to 15, 70, and 15 percent here.
Cardle et al. [17] used respective minimum lengths of 15,
16, and 20 nucleotides for mononucleotide, tetranucleotide, and pentanucleotide motifs in Arabidopsis. They
found A to exceed C by about 10 to 1, versus an excess of
only 2:1 here, which probably reflects the strategy used
here to eliminate polyA tails from the EST collections.
They found very few tetranucleotide motifs in ESTs; AAAC
was the most common. Here, tetranucleotide motifs were
about 30% as common as dinucleotide motifs. AAAG was
nearly twice as common as AAAC, and the next ranked
motifs were ACAT, AAAT, AGAT, AATG, and ACCC, with
21 of 33 canonical motifs represented at least once. They
found no pentanucleotide motifs in the EST sequences,
whereas here such motifs were 20% as common as trinucleotide motifs and represented 66 of the 102 possible
canonical motifs, both because of the much larger sample
size and the shorter minimum microsatellite locus. In
marked contrast to the present study, they found very few
compound microsatellite loci, probably because they
used the full-length criteria for all members of compound
loci.
Han et al. [33] used minimum locus lengths of 10, 12, 16,
20, and 24 nucleotides respectively for motifs of two,
three, four, five, and six bases in Gossypium ESTs. They
reported respective relative frequencies of 30, 59.1, 6.4,
1.8, and 2.7%, versus 14.6, 35.6, 7.4, 17.8, and 14.4%
here, where the minimum locus length was shorter for the
longer motifs.
From 15 to 20% of the longer instances represent repeated
subsequence in repetitive elements, such as transposons.
Most or all of the rest can be attributed to repeated subsequences within genes, such as those that encode cell-wall
or seed-storage proteins. O'Dushlaine et al. [34] found
that about six percent of human proteins manifest tandem-repeat polymorphisms. The repeated subsequences
do not necessarily preserve reading frame, although there
is a substantial excess of those that do. Repeats that disrupt reading frame have been invoked in the evolution of
nine types of unstructured proteins in animals [35],
including the C-terminal domain of eukaryotic RNA
polymerase II. O'Dushlaine et al. [34] suggest that up to
one percent of human protein unigenes contain frameshifting repeats, and that such proteins tend to be
involved in protein-protein interactions. The present
study could not substantiate any examples of exon repetition arising upon RNA splicing, even though specific
instances of exon repetition and exon scrambling have
been demonstrated to result from intermolecular RNA
splicing in human beings [36] and five other animal species [37]. Also, the mean GC content is higher for motifs

Page 19 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:173

that retain reading frame, and this accords with a higher
GC content within coding sequence than elsewhere.
Inukai [38] investigated minisatellite loci in 5.3 megabases of genomic sequence in Oryza sativa. The loci had at
least three copies of a motif at least 10 nucleotides long.
Based on blast searches within the sampled genomic
sequence, 183 loci were considered multilocus, i.e., occurring within similar sequence at dispersed positions in the
genome, and 37 were single-locus. The loci were ascribed
to transposable elements if their flanking sequence met
criteria for long-terminal repeats, inverted repeats, or target-site duplication, or if they matched database entries
for rice transposable elements. Of the 41 single-locus minisatellites, eight (19.5%) were embedded in transposable
elements, comparable to the 15 to 20% of minisatellites
estimated to belong to repetitive elements in the current
study. While all 183 of Inukai's multilocus minisatellites
belonged to transposable elements, it is unlikely that
these elements were transcribed at a significant frequency,
so one would not expect them to dominate the minisatellites within the transcriptome. The En/Spm family of class
II transposable elements was one of the most common
sources of minisatellites in Inukai's study, and it was the
leading repetitive-element source of minisatellites in the
current study. Also, minisatellite GC content in his study
behaved the same as in the current study, exceeding the
GC content of the flanking sequence when that GC content was high, and falling short when that GC content was
low.
Tissue specificity is a generally underestimated source of
microsatellite frequency variation in EST collections. Bilgen et al. [39] demonstrated this for ESTs drawn from 11
different tissues or developmental stages in Arabidopsis
thaliana, where the relative frequency of the leading dinucleotide motif, AG, varied from 31.6% in seedlings to
55.5% in developing seeds. The current study did not try
to select subsets of EST collections on the basis of annotation, so it cannot comment on the degree to which the
phylogenetic analysis of motif frequencies was perturbed
by tissue representation in the collections. It is potentially
quite significant. Also, transcriptional slippage is a potential source of spurious microsatellite alleles in cDNA
libraries [34], but the measured frequency of such slippage is only about 0.02% of all mRNA molecules in ubiquitin-B and amyloid precursor protein in human [40].
Therefore, transcription slippage has likely occurred at
some very low frequency in the founding mRNA of the
EST datasets examined here.
Finally, microsatellites stand in the eye of the beholder,
i.e., the threshold criteria for patterned sequence are
rather arbitrary and there is a continuum from perfect
microsatellites to random sequence. Although a mini-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/173

mum locus length of 15 nucleotides is appropriate for
short microsatellite motifs, a minimum of 20 or more is
less likely to pick up randomly occurring doublings of
longer motifs. Between 10 and 20% of patternedsequence loci are polymorphic within EST collections for
motif lengths from two to six nucleotides, suggesting that
the longer motifs should also be sought out and used
wherever di- and tri-nucleotide motifs are used now. Frequently the polymorphism results from indels in the
flanking sequence, in addition to or instead of variation in
repeat count in the microsatellite itself. Patterned
sequence appears to be subject to natural selection and to
evolve more rapidly than the transcriptome at large.

Methods
Data source
DNA sequences were extracted from gbest flat files in GenBank release 150, dated 15 October 2005 [41]. For each
accession, the genus was recognized as the third word
(tract of non-whitespace text) in the line that contained
the string "ORGANISM". Sequences were counted by
genus, and sequences were written to separate flat files for
all 88 genera that were represented by at least 3000
sequences.
Removal of vector and low-quality sequence
Each genus was processed independently. Its sequence file
was first searched for vector sequences by blastn [42]
against UniVec [43]. A Perl 5.8 script then removed the
vector-matching subsequences, except for the telomeric
repeats of YAC vectors. A second Perl script trimmed off
tracts of at least 10 consecutive A's or T's within the first 60
nucleotides from either end of the vector-trimmed
sequences, plus any sequence distal to these tracts.
Recognition and processing of repeated motifs
A generic repeat finder, written in C, searched for repeated
motifs from 1 to 250 nucleotides long in the trimmed
sequences, without regard for redundancy in the motif. A
Perl script then recognized motifs that were multiples of
shorter motifs, and purged the list of repeats to retain only
the shorter motifs. This script allowed the recognition of
overlapping motifs provided that one was sufficiently
longer than the other, and was not a multiple of it. In this
way, classical microsatellites were sometimes recognized
within longer minisatellites. Another Perl script then
identified all instances where different blocks of repeats
occurred within five nucleotides of one another, thereby
comprising a compound locus. From this script emerged
the list of all simple and compound sites of patterned
sequence within the set of ESTs. To eliminate duplicate
and nearly duplicate sequences, phrap [21] was applied to
only the sequences that contained patterned sequence.
Phrap produced a list of singlets and a list of contigs. The
contigs were parsed for the longest contributing sequence

Page 20 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:173

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/173

that contained patterned sequence at a particular position
in the contig, where position was a window of nine
nucleotides centered at the midpoint of a patterned
sequence. Therefore, primers were always chosen from a
real sequence, even if the contig was misassembled. The
singlets and chosen contig-contributors were output as a
list of motifs, positions, and host-sequence identities. This
list, and the sequences that it specified, were reformatted
for input to primer3 [22], which returned wherever possible six pairs of primers per locus. The primers were chosen
to position the microsatellite locus off center in the
expected amplification product, closest to a specifiable
ratio of short-side length to long-side length. This
improved the chances of successful verification on agarose
gels when a motif-specific third primer is included.
Finally, the chosen primers were compared to all the
sequences in the nonredundant set resulting from phrap,
counting matches to indicate the likely frequency of the
amplified sequence in the genome.

Repeat frequency in random sequence
The observed microsatellite frequency was compared to
that expected by chance in random sequences of the same
length as the observed sequences. If the bases occur at
equal frequency (0.25), the expected frequency of tandem
repeats of length m with k mismatching nucleotides in a
sequence of length n is:

The phrap program could not successfully process large
datasets, even under its manyreads option, because it
exhausted system memory. In these cases, the vectorpolyA-trimmed input file was split up so that no piece had
more than about 150000 sequences, and the entire pipeline ran independently on the pieces. A Perl script then
identified the contributing sequences for each piece, and
the pipeline was rerun on only these contributing
sequences. For the largest datasets, e.g., Triticum and Zea,
it was necessary to undertake this strategy twice, so as to
maintain datasets of manageable size throughout the
processing.

whose sum for k = 0, 1, and 2 is approximately the
expected frequency of triple tandem repeats with two
allowed mismatches. The sum is a bit in excess because
two mismatches in the second repeat disqualify the repeat
block as a triple tandem repeat. The comparison for double tandem repeats was done for motif lengths where the
minimum locus contained two repeats, i.e., where the
motif was at least eight nucleotides long. Below that, the
triple tandem repeats formula was used for motifs from
five through seven nucleotides long. The expected ratio of
double to triple repeats is approximately 4m.

Statistical analysis
Other Perl scripts extracted canonical motifs from the
pipeline's output and tabulated repeat counts, GC content, frequency of polymorphism, and so on. The canonical form of a motif was the lexicographically least form
obtained upon all possible rotations of the motif and its
reverse complement. Thus TCA reduced to ATC, and TC
reduced to AG. The results were grouped by canonical
motif, even though the different contributing motifs
might have independent biological functions that depend
upon reading frame. Statistical significance was tested by
empirical distributions of 20000 to 50000 randomly
drawn samples of the same size, wherever a parametric
distribution was unavailable, as in the case of mean Euclidean distances among genera or mean motif rankings.

Microsatellite frequency per megabase was estimated by
dividing counts of post-phrap loci by numbers of nucleotides in non-redundant trimmed sequences, which were
obtained by using phrap independently on all the
trimmed sequences. As above, the larger datasets required
division and reprocessing of subsets through phrap.

F = (n - 2m +1) * 4-m * 3k * m!/(k! * (m - k)!)

(1)

The sum of F for k = 0, 1, and 2 gives the expected frequency of tandem repeats given two allowed mismatches,
and the sum of such sums over all sequence lengths in the
EST collection gives the expected frequency of repeats of
motif length m. Similarly, the expected frequency of triple
tandem repeats is
F = (n - 3m + 1) * 4-2m * 3k * (2m)!/(k! * (2m - k)!),
(2)

Detection of repetitive elements
To test the possibility that repeated motifs were part of
repetitive sequences, particularly retrotransposons that
were being transcribed at individually low but collectively
substantial frequency, motifs of at least 30 bases were subjected to tblastx [42] against RepBase 3.11 [23]. Also subjected to tblastx against RepBase was a parallel set of
synthetic sequences, constructed at random to the same
lengths as the real motifs in accordance with codon usage
in each genus. This synthetic set relied on random deviates
uniformly distributed in [0,1), produced by the Mersenne
Twister generator [44] as function runif() in R [24]. This
set allowed an appraisal of the biological significance of
hits of the real repeated motifs to various repetitive elements. Also, the real sequences that contained 30-base or
longer repeated motifs were subjected to tblastx against
RepBase, to identify long but diffuse hits that might have
arisen from the rapid evolution of repetitive elements.
