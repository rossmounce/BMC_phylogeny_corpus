Turbot reovirus (SMReV) genome encoding a
FAST protein with a non-AUG start site
Fei Ke, Li-Bo He, Chao Pei and Qi-Ya Zhang*

Abstract
Background: A virus was isolated from diseased turbot Scophthalmus maximus in China. Biophysical and
biochemical assays, electron microscopy, and genome electrophoresis revealed that the virus belonged to the
genus Aquareovirus, and was named Scophthalmus maximus reovirus (SMReV). To the best of our knowledge, no
complete sequence of an aquareovirus from marine fish has been determined. Therefore, the complete
characterization and analysis of the genome of this novel aquareovirus will facilitate further understanding of the
taxonomic distribution of aquareovirus species and the molecular mechanism of its pathogenesis.
Results: The full-length genome sequences of SMReV were determined. It comprises eleven dsRNA segments
covering 24,042 base pairs and has the largest S4 genome segment in the sequenced aquareoviruses. Sequence
analysis showed that all of the segments contained six conserved nucleotides at the 5’ end and five conserved
nucleotides at the 3’ end (5’-GUUUUA —— UCAUC-3’). The encoded amino acid sequences share the highest
sequence identities with the respective proteins of aquareoviruses in species group Aquareovirus A. Phylogenetic
analysis based on the major outer capsid protein VP7 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were performed.
Members in Aquareovirus were clustered in two groups, one from fresh water fish and the other from marine fish.
Furthermore, a fusion associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein NS22, which is translated from a non-AUG
start site, was identified in the S7 segment.
Conclusions: This study has provided the complete genome sequence of a novel isolated aquareovirus from
marine fish. Amino acids comparison and phylogenetic analysis suggested that SMReV was a new aquareovirus in
the species group Aquareovirus A. Phylogenetic analysis among aquareoviruses revealed that VP7 could be used as
a reference to divide the aquareovirus from hosts in fresh water or marine. In addition, a FAST protein with a nonAUG start site was identified, which partially contributed to the cytopathic effect caused by the virus infection.
These results provide new insights into the virus-host and virus-environment interactions.

Background
Aquareoviruses have been isolated from a wide variety
of aquatic animals [1,2]. These viruses represent a great
threat to the aquaculture industry in China and East
Asia. As a genus of the family Reoviridae, viruses in
Aquareovirus have eleven-segmented dsRNA genomes.
The virus particles are icosahedral in symmetry and
have a double-layered capsid. Aquareoviruses have been
divided into seven species (aquareovirus A to G, AQRVA to G) according to RNA-RNA blot hybridization or
sequence comparison [3,4]. There are three aquareoviruses that have complete sequence information: Grass

carp reovirus (GCRV, species AQRV-C), Golden shiner
reovirus (GSRV, species AQRV-C), and American grass
carp reovirus (AGCRV, species AQRV-G) [4-6]. In addition, nearly complete sequence data was available for
Chum salmon reovirus (CHSRV, species AQRV-A)
except for segment 4. Additionally, some other aquareoviruses have sequence information for parts of the genome segments. However, sequence and molecular data
seems to be insufficient for comparing species in
Orthoreovirus, which was considered as the most related
genus with Aquareovirus [6].
The family Reoviridae contains fifteen genera of reoviruses with 9, 10, 11 or 12 dsRNA genome segments
[4]. Members in Orthoreovirus (except MRV) and Aquareovirus make up the fusogenic reovirus, whose infection

causes cell-cell fusion and the formation of a syncytium
[7,8]. Up to now, the nonstructural fusion associated
small transmembrane (FAST) proteins represent the
only known nonstructural viral proteins that induce
cell-cell fusion; however, they are not directly related to
virus entry or exit. A number of FAST proteins have
been identified in orthoreovirus and aquareovirus species, and the protein topology, structural motifs, and
some key amino acids have also been identified [9-12].
Thus, the identification of new FAST proteins would
help to the further elucidate their functions.
The only reported aquareovirus in China was grass
carp reovirus (GCRV), which was isolated from freshwater grass carp. Recently, a Scophthalmus maximus
reovirus (SMReV) was isolated and identified from a diseased turbot. It is the first isolated aquareovirus from a
marine fish in China. The complete genome sequence of
SMReV was determined and compared with other reoviruses. Sequence and functional analysis also identified
a FAST protein that utilized a non-AUG translation
start site.

Electron microscopy observations showed that the
negatively stained virions had the typical morphology of
aquareoviruses, including an inner nucleocapsid surrounded by double-layered capsids, and were about 7080 nm in diameter (Figure 1B). The biophysical and biochemical properties of SMReV included resistance to
heat, acid (PH 3.0), and alkaline (PH11.0) treatment.
Treatment with chloroform or 5-iodo-2’-deoxyuridine
(IUdR, Sigma) did not affect the viral infectivity.
The SMReV genomes were purified and analyzed by 1%
agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 1C, the
genome segments were separated into 10 distinct bands,
with segments 1 and 2 comigrating. Comparison with the
genome of GCRV-873 showed that migration of SMReV
genome segments was different from those of GCRV.
The complete sequences of segments 1-11 of SMReV
were obtained and have been deposited in GenBank
under accession numbers HM989930-HM989940. The
lengths of SMReV genome segments ranged from 784
(S11) to 3947 (S1) bp, with a total of 24042 bp (Table 1).

Pathology, morphology, and the genome of SMReV

SMReV could cause a cytopathic effect (CPE) in Grass
carp fins (GCF) and in Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE)
cell lines after 4-5 days incubation. The optimal temperature was 20°C. The CPE contained several separate
plaques in which syncytia formed (Figure 1A).

Negatively stained virions. The bars represent 100 nm. (C) Purified
genomic dsRNA of SMReV was analyzed by 1% agarose gel
electrophoresis. Genomic dsRNA of GCRV-873 was used as control.

As shown in Table 1, the lengths of SMReV non-coding
regions ranged from 12 to 28 nucleotides at the 5’ end
and ranged from 27 to 162 nucleotides at the 3’ end.
The S4 genome segment had a non-coding region as
long as 162 nucleotides at the 3’ end, which was longer
than the corresponding segment any other aquareoviruses so far sequenced.
Conserved terminal nucleotide sequences have been
considered as a feature in reovirus classification. Comparison of the genome sequences of SMReV showed
that all of the segments had conserved terminal
sequences. The conserved nucleotides 5’-GUUUUAU/G/
A -3’ were present at the 5’ ends in all the positive
strands of each segment and 5’-U/AU/AUCAUC-3’ was
present at the 3’ end. They were very similar to those of
CHSRV (AQRV-A) (5’-GUUUUAU / G -3’ at 5’ end and
5’-U/AU/AUCAUC-3’ at 3’ end) and AGCRV (AQRV-G)
(5’-GUUUUAU/A-3’ at 5’ end and U/A/C U/AUCAUC-3’
at 3’ end) (Table 2). However, there were some differences between SMReV and species in AQRV-C (GCRV873 and GSRV, 5’-GUUAUUU/G-3’ at 5’ end and 5’-U/
A UCAUC-3’ at 3’ end). Interestingly, a newly isolated
aquareovirus from grass carp showed a distinct terminal
sequence at 5’ end (GCRV HZ08, 5’-GUAAUU-3’) [13].
Conserved terminal sequences could be used in genome
assembly and packaging as “sorting” signals [14].
Moreover, the first and last nucleotides of each segment in all aquareoviruses were complementary (G-C).
Potential imperfect inverted repeats were also predicted
in the sequences adjacent to each termini of the SMReV
positive-sense strand (Figure 2). It had been reported
that complementary sequences in the 5’ and 3’ NCR

Figure 2 Potentially imperfect inverted repeats at terminal
nucleotide sequences of positive-sense RNA of SMReV genome
segments.

The S2 genome segment of SMReV was predicted to
encode the core protein VP2, which is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The catalytic domain of
RdRp was identified between amino acids 550 and 798
in VP2 by motifscan (ExPASy proteomics server). Previous research had identified five important motifs,
motif A, B, C, D and E, in RdRp [16]. Motif A
(DXXXXD, 591-596), motif B (SG, 648-649), and motif
C (GDD, 739-741) were found in the predicted catalytic
domain of SMReV VP2. Amino acid alignments revealed
that these motifs are also conserved in the RdRp proteins of Aquareovirus and Orthoreovirus species. Moreover, a hydrophobic region was identified in the Cterminus of SMReV VP2 that could be motif E of RdRp.
The S3 genome segment of SMReV was predicted to
encode the core protein VP3, which functions as a helicase and NTPase. A zinc finger C2H2 domain was identified in the SMReV VP3 at amino acid positions 113136, which is known to bind RNA. As revealed by CryoEM analysis, amino acids Glu502, Ser503, Thr504, and
Thr505 are involved in RNA transcription in GCRV
[17]. Amino acid alignments showed that the four
amino acids were conserved in MRV, GCRV, GSRV,
and AGCRV. However, the corresponding amino acids
were Glu, Thr, Thr, and Thr in SMReV and CHSRV.
The S4 genome segment was predicted to encode the
nonstructural protein NS88. This segment was larger
than its homologs in other Aquareovirus species. The
high percentage of G+C in the 5’ portion and the complicated secondary structure of the genomic RNA made

Page 4 of 13

it difficult to determine the complete sequence of this
segment. In this study, reverse transcriptase that was
stable at 65°C was used in 5’ RACE to clone the 5’ part
of S4 genome segment. It was anticipated that NS88
was necessary to form viral inclusion bodies during
virus infection, in which the virus genome replication
and virion morphogenesis occurs. There were two coils
(amino acid residues positions 587-635 and 700-762) in
NS88, as predicted by Coils program. Sequence analysis
also revealed that the corresponding NS88 proteins in
Aquareovirus species all contained the two coils regions,
and conserved histidine and cysteine.
The S5 genome segment was predicted to encode the
minor core protein VP4, which is thought to be a
nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase as a putative
cofactor of VP2. Amino acid sequence alignments
showed two conserved lysine residues (positions 409
and 413) in SMReV VP4, which were also conserved in
MRV, ARV, and Aquareovirus species except CHSRV.
The S6 genome segment was predicted to encode the
outer capsid protein VP5. An autolytic cleavage site was
predicted to be located between amino acid residues
Asn42 and Pro43. In addition, a myristoylation consensus sequence, which is essential for the autolytic cleavage, was located in the N-terminus of VP5. Sequence
alignment revealed that the N-terminal sequence of VP5
in aquareovirus species was highly conserved.
The S8 genome segment of SMReV was predicted to
encode the core protein VP6. VP6 has an amino acids
sequence identity of about 20% with the s2 protein of
MRV species (Table 2). Secondary structure predictions
revealed that a large number of b-sheets and turns
existed in the N-terminal portion (75% of the protein)
of SMReV VP6, which are characteristics of s2/sA proteins in MRV and ARV species [18,19]. However, there
were some differences in the C-terminal regions
between SMReV VP6 and MRV s2, as revealed by
hydrophobic analysis. Most of the amino acid residues
in the C-terminal regions of VP6 are hydrophobic; however, they are hydrophilic in s2.
The S9 genome segment of SMReV was predicted to
encode the nonstructural protein NS38. NS38 is thought
to be involved in the formation of viral inclusion bodies
with NS88. The amino acids sequence identity between
NS38 and MRV sNS is lower than 20%, but they show
a high similarity in secondary structure and in their
hydrophobicity.
The S10 genome segment of SMReV was predicted to
encode the major outer capsid protein VP7. As the
major outer capsid protein, VP7 had the most variability
among aquareovirus species groups.
The S11 genome segment of SMReV was predicted to
encode the nonstructural protein NS25. No equivalent
proteins of NS25 were found in reovirus species other

Ke et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:323
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/323

than aquareoviruses by BLAST analysis. An immunofluorescense assay showed that NS25 is distributed in
the cytoplasm during SMReV infection (data not
shown).
Genome segment S7 encodes a FAST protein

Initial ORF analysis by EditSeq in DNASTAR software
showed that SMReV genome segment S7 contained only
one ORF, which started from an AUG codon at nucleotide 489. However, except for CHSRV, the S7 segment
in aquareoviruses usually contains more than one ORF.
To determine the ORFs contained by SMReV S7, different recombinant plasmids that contained all or part of
the S7 segment cDNA were constructed and expressed
in fish cell lines. When the entire S7 segment cDNA
was expressed, cultured fish cells formed syncytia in
which the nucleus aggregated (Figure 3A-a). However,
the expression of cDNA (489-1325, NS32) did not cause
cell-cell fusion (Figure 3A-b). Cells expressing cDNA (1613) formed syncytia (Figure 3A-c). This indicated that
the 5’ part of the SMReV S7 segment encoded a protein
that could cause cell-cell fusion and was translated from
a non-AUG translation start site. Furthermore, expression of S7 cDNA (12-613) and cDNA (14-613) could
induce cell-cell fusion (Figure 3B), but no cell-cell fusion
occurred when cDNAs (15-613) and (19-613) were
expressed. In addition, a point mutation at nucleotide
15 ( 14 AUC 16 to ACC) did not influence the ability to
form syncytia. However, syncytium formation was
ablated by a point mutation at nucleotide 18 (17CUG19
to CCG) (Figure 3B). Considering the consensus
sequence (RNNAUGG) of the non-AUG start site [20]
and the sequence (14AUCCUGG20) near the nucleotide
position 17 of S7 segment, it can be concluded that
SMReV S7 segment encoded a protein from a CUG
translation start site. This ORF starts from a CUG
codon at nucleotides 17-19 and is terminated by UGA
at nucleotides 611-613.
Thus, the S7 genome segment of SMReV contained
more than one ORF. The first ORF encoded the FAST
protein NS22 and the second ORF was predicted to
encode a nonstructural protein, NS32.
Fusogenic proteins in SMReV and GCRV

In addition to NS22 of SMReV, the NS16 protein
encoded by the first ORF (nucleotides positions 14-454)
of the S7 genome segment of GCRV-873 was also identified here as a FAST protein. In vitro expression of NS16
in fish cells induced syncytium formation (Figure 3C-d).
Expression of NS16-EGFP recombinant protein also
induced syncytium formation, while NS16-EGFP was distributed in the fused cells (Figure 3C-e). Hydrophobic
analysis by ProtScale (ExPASy Proteomics Server)
revealed that NS22 and NS16 had a similar hydropathy

Page 5 of 13

profile (Figure 4A). However, there were some differences in the motifs contained in NS22 and NS16. A myristoylation consensus sequence (MGXXXS) was found in
the N-terminus of NS22, but, surprisingly, no myristoylation site was predicted to exist in NS16. It had been
reported that N-terminal myristoylation was necessary
for the fusion activity of reptilian reovirus (RRV) p14
protein [11]. NS22 and NS16 were both predicted to contain a transmembrane domain (TM, positions 35-57 for
NS22 and 37-60 for NS16) by TMpred [21]. Following
the TM domain, there are regions that contain a stretch
of basic amino acid residues (PB) in both proteins (positions 61-68 and 82-95 for NS22 and 63-78 for NS16).
The polybasic regions are thought to support the translocation of the N-terminal domain (34 amino acids for
NS22 and 36 amino acids for NS16) into face the extracellular environment [11]. Besides the TM domain,
another hydrophobic region, the hydrophobic patch
(PH), was predicted to exist in the C-terminal fragment
of both proteins (positions 140-150 for NS22 and 113119 for NS16). Moreover, there are two regions that are
rich in arginine, proline, and histidine (RPH) in NS22
(Figure 4B). However, there are three RPH domains in
the FAST protein of ASRV-2009 [12], despite its high
sequence similarity with SMReV NS22.
Comparison with other reovirus species and phylogenetic
analysis

Comparison of the electropherotype of SMReV in agarose gel electrophoresis with those reported from other
aquareoviruses [22] revealed that the electropherotype
of SMReV was similar to the members in AQRV-A.
Interestingly, it was different to the electropherotype of
TRV, which was isolated from turbot in Spain [23].
The genome sequence and deduced amino acids were
compared to the sequences available from other aquareoviruses. SMReV had a larger M4 genome (2640 bp)
segment than other sequenced aquareoviruses (GCRV/
GSRV, 2320 bp; AGCRV, 2293 bp). Overall identity
values between SMReV and other aquareoviruses homologous proteins ranged from 13% to 94%. The highest
identity was between SMReV and species in AQRV-A,
for example, CHSRV, which ranged from 76.2% to
92.8%. However, the CHSRV genome sequence information lacked the complete M4 segment (Table 2).
The genes and proteins of SMReV were compared with
their homologs from reovirus species other than aquareoviruses. The results showed that SMReV had a high similarity with species in Orthoreovirus (MRV and ARV, as
shown in table 2). The highest amino acid sequence identities (40%) between SMReV and Orthoreovirus species
(MRV and ARV) were observed in the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (VP2 in SMReV, l3 or lB in MRV and
ARV species) (Table 2). A phylogenetic tree among

members of fourteen genera of Reoviridae, for whom
sequence information was available, was constructed
based on the RdRp sequences (Figure 5A). The genus
Aquareovirus was clustered more closely with the Orthoreovirus. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 5A, several
genus groups that have different genome segments numbers and hosts have a relatively close evolutionary

relationship. For example, members from the genus Cardoreovirus and Seadornavirus were closely clustered.
Members from the genus Cypovirus and Dinovernavirus
were also closely clustered. In addition, there were two
subfamilies in Reoviridae: Spinareovirinae and Sedoreovirinae. Members in Spinareovirinae are turreted reoviruses, which have turrets situated on the virus core

reoviruses. Two large species groups also existed in the
present phylogenetic analysis. On the left side of Figure

As the viral major outer capsid protein, VP7 is the
most variable protein in aquareoviruses. A phylogenetic
tree was constructed with VP7 amino acid sequences in
aquareoviruses. It showed that SMReV was most related
to viruses in AQRV-A (SBRV, striped bass reovirus;
ASRV; CHSRV; TFRV, threadfin reovirus) (Figure 5B).
Interestingly, the viruses from hosts that had a seawater
life history were closely related (above the broken line in
Figure 5B), and were different from those whose hosts
lived in fresh water (below the broken line in Figure 5B).

Discussion
Putative functions of proteins revealed by motif
comparison

It has been reported that the four conserved amino
acids (two lysines and two histidines) in VP1 are essential amino acids for the guanylyltransferase activity of
the homologous proteins in MRV, ARV (avian orthoreovirus), and GCRV [24-26]. Several functional domains
were also identified in GCRV VP1 by CryoEM analysis,
such as the GTPase domain, the methyltransferase
domain, and the immunoglobulin domain [17].
The two lysine residues in VP4 are essential for
ATPase activity in homologous protein μA of ARV [27].
By comparison with the proteins from MRV and ARV,
VP4 was thought to be a nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase and a putative cofactor of VP2.
The autolytic cleavage site, Asn42 and Pro43, which
allowed the protein to be cleaved during virus infection
to produce an N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal
fragment [28], was identified as SMReV VP5. Previous
research reported that VP5 and VP7 formed heterodimers to form the outer capsid in GCRV [29]. In the early
stage of infection, the outer capsid is proteolytically
cleaved and disassembled to form the infectious subviral
particles (ISVPs), which have enhanced infectivity [30].
Viral inclusions, or viral factories, are formed in the
cytoplasm during reovirus infection. It has been reported
that MRV nonstructural proteins μNS and sNS form
viral inclusion bodies in vivo and in vitro [31,32]. Based
on sequence comparisons, it was anticipated that SMReV
NS88 had a function in forming viral inclusions along
with NS38. The two coils structure in NS88 was thought
to be essential for viral inclusions formation. Conserved
histidines and cysteines between the two coil regions are

Page 9 of 13

also important for inclusion formation in MRV and ARV
[33,34]. In addition, the N-terminal amino acid residues
in NS38 were predicted to form an alpha-helix, which
could be important for nucleoprotein complex formation
in the sNS protein [35].
Moreover, the second ORF of S7 segment in MRV
encodes the sC protein, which is a structural protein
and is involved in cell attachment [36]. However, the
protein corresponding to sC in Aquareovirus species is
a nonstructural protein [29].
FAST proteins of aquareoviruses with different translation
start sites

Sequence and structural analysis agreed with the previous
report that there were two types of FAST proteins in
aquareoviruses [12]. One type comprises the NS16 proteins encoded by GCRV, GSRV (AQRV-C), and AGCRV
(AQRV-G). The other type comprises the NS22 proteins
encoded by SMReV and ASRV-2009 (AQRV-A). The
FAST proteins of SMReV and ASRV-2009 use a noncanonical translation start site. There are some differences
in the motifs in the two types of FAST proteins (Figure
4B). Racine et al. reported that NS16 could be a homolog
of the reptilian orthoreovirus (RRV) p14 FAST protein.
However, p14 contains an N-terminal myristoylation site
that is essential for fusion activity [11]. Sequence analysis
found no N-terminal myristoylation site in NS16. This
indicated that NS16 could not be a homolog of RRV p14.
The sequence comparison also showed that the motif and
structural arrangements of NS16 were more similar with
ARV p10 FAST protein [9]. Further analysis of the functions of each motif could facilitate the understanding of
the mechanisms involved in syncytium formation and the
evolution of FAST proteins.
Non-AUG translation start codons have been reported
in many organisms, including viruses [20,37], such as the
Sendai virus [38] and the Moloney murine leukemia virus
(MoMuLV) [39]. Recently, a CUG start codon was identified in ASRV-2009, which was utilized for translating a
FAST protein [12]. The non-canonical start site (CUG in
SMReV and ASRV-2009) used in FAST proteins could
be a strategy by which the translation efficiency is regulated. Inefficient expression of FAST proteins could
reduce the rate of cell-cell fusion and facilitate the production of viral progeny. In addition, the start codon of
the FAST protein of GCRV (NS16) is AUG; however, the
nucleotide sequence around this AUG site (ACCAUGC)
did not accord with the Kozak consensus sequence (G/
ANNAUGG). This also indicated that NS16 could be
translated with relatively low efficiency.
Taxonomic status of SMReV and evolution analysis

Aquareoviruses have been divided into seven Aquareovirus
species groups (AQRV-A to AQRV-G) [3,4]. The division

Ke et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:323
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/323

of the different Aquareovirus species groups was based on
electropherotype, serological comparison, the ability to
reassort during mixed infections, conserved terminal
sequences, and RNA sequence analyses. Genome electrophoresis, and gene and protein comparison revealed that
SMReV could be a member of species group AQRV-A.
Interestingly, turbot reovirus (TRV), which was isolated
from Spain, was classified in species group AQRV-E by
RNA-RNA hybridization [23].
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the evolution of
VP7 was affected by selective pressure from the host
organisms. Evolution of aquareoviruses was closely
related to the environment in which the host organisms
lived. The family Reoviridae contains a large number of
members that infect vertebrates, invertebrates, plants,
and fungi. Members in Aquareovirus and Orthoreovirus
have a common evolutionary origin with those from
Mycoreovirus and Coltivirus, Cypovirus, and Dinovernavirus. It is interesting that viruses from vertebrates and
fungi have a common ancestor. These genera comprise
viruses that have genome segments ranging from 9 to
12. It has been speculated that reoviruses diverged from
a common ancestor may have gained or lost a genome
segment that was required or not in different hosts during the course of evolution [40]. In this case, the S11
segment in Aquareovirus species that has no equivalent
in Orthoreovirus may be involved in virus-host interactions. Moreover, the model of genetic “jump”, which
involves changes in the number of genome segments,
has been reported between the rotaviruses and the seadornaviruses, and between the aquareoviruses and the
coltiviruses [4,41]. This model involves a process in
which a single segment undergoes duplication and deletion to generate two separate segments. In this case, the
S7 segment of aquareoviruses corresponds to segments
9 and 12 of coltiviruses.

Conclusions
In summary, the present study provided the complete
genome sequence of a newly isolated turbot reovirus
from China. It is the first complete sequence of an
aquareovirus from marine fish. Amino acids comparison
and phylogenetic analysis suggested that SMReV is a
new aquareovirus in the species group Aquareovirus A.
Phylogenetic relationships among aquareoviruses
revealed that VP7 could be used as a reference to divide
the aquareovirus from freshwater hosts from those from
marine hosts. Based on the complete genome sequence,
a FAST protein with a non-AUG start site was identified, which partially contributed to the cytopathic effect
caused by viral infection. These results provide new
insights into the virus-host or virus-environment
interactions.

Methods
Original viral isolate preparation

Diseased cultured turbot Scophthalmus maximus were
sampled from a fish farm in Shandong province of
northern China. The original viral isolate was prepared
from tissues (liver, kidney, and spleen) of these fish as
described previously [42]. Briefly, tissues were cut into
pieces and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) containing antibiotics (penicillin, 100 IU ml-1 ;
streptomycin, 100 IU ml -1 ). Extracts were filtered
through a 45 um filter membrane and stored at -80°C as
the original viral isolate for cell infections.
Cell culture and virus infection

Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE), Flounder embryo (FE),
Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC), and GCF cell
lines, were used for viral isolation and sensitivity tests.
Tissue lysates acquired above were inoculated into confluent monolayers of these cells in 199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 15°C, 20°C or
25°C.
Grass carp reovirus 873 (GCRV-873) used in this
study was maintained in our laboratory [43]. Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney (CIK) cells were used for GCRV873 propagation at 25°C.
Biophysical and biochemical property detection

The optimal temperature for virus propagation was
assayed by infection of monolayers of GCF cell cultures
at 15°C, 20°C, or 25°C. Heat stability was measured by
incubating the virus suspension at 56°C or 60°C for 30
min, or 60 min and then the titer was determined.
Chloroform and 5-iodo-2’-deoxyuridine sensitivity was
determined as described previously [44].
Virus isolation and purification

Infected GCF cells were harvested at five days post
infection and centrifuged at 8, 000 g for 30 min at 4°C.
The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 32, 000
rpm (Beckman rotor SW41) for 90 min. The virus pellet
was resuspended in 1.5 ml 0.1 M Tris-Cl (PH 8.6) and
further purified by discontinuous sucrose (20%30%, 40%,
50%, and 60%, w/v) gradient centrifugation at 30, 000
rpm for 60 min. The virus particle band was collected
and sucrose was removed by centrifugation at 32, 000
rpm for 90 min in 0.1 M Tris-Cl (PH 8.6). The resulting
pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml 0.1 M Tris-Cl (PH 8.6)
and stored at -20°C until use.
Electron microscopy

Purified virus particles were negatively stained with 2%
(w/v) uranylacetate and then examined with transmission electron microscopy (JEM-1230).

Virus dsRNA preparation and cloning

Virus dsRNA was extracted from purified virus particles
using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Synthesis of cDNA from SMReV dsRNA
was carried out using the single-primer amplification technique [45,46]. Briefly, an oligodeoxyribonucleotide primer,
TC1 (5’ PO4-CCCGCCATCCTCACTTAGACT-NH2 3’)
was ligated to both of the 3’ ends of the dsRNA segments
using T4 RNA ligase (Takara). dsRNA was denatured at
94°C for 5 min in the presence of 15% DMSO before
being cooled rapidly on ice. cDNA synthesis was then carried out in a cDNA reaction using M-MLV (Promega).
RNA was then removed by adding NaOH and the cDNA
was annealed at 65°C overnight. After purification through
a Sephacryl S-400 spin column (Promega), the cDNA was
amplified by PCR using the primer TC2 (5’ AGTCTAAGTGAGGATGGCGGG 3’) with following cycles: 2
min elongation at 72°C; 94°C for 5 min; followed by 32
cycles of amplification (94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C
for 3 min).
To clone the 5’ parts of the S4 segment, cDNA was
synthesized using a primer designed from the partial
sequence obtained above, as described previously [47].
Reverse transcription was carried out using ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resulting
cDNA was purified and poly (C) tailed by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT, Takara). First round
PCR was performed using primers designed above and
5’ AP. The second round PCR was carried out using
internal primers and 5’ UP (see additional file 1).
Sequencing and sequence analysis

PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and all
visible bands were purified and cloned into the pMD18T vector (Takara). The positive clones were sequenced.
Aquareoviruses and other reoviruses sequences were
obtained from the GenBank (NCBI). The accession
numbers were collected in additional file 2. Nucleotide
sequences and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed using the EditSeq program (DNASTAR, USA).
Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using the
Clustal × 1.83 program. Sequence identities were calculated using the Clusta W method in the MegAlign program. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the Poisson correction models with
1000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA 4.0 [48]. Hydrophobicity plots of proteins were predicted using ProtScale
(ExPASy) with the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm [49].
The coils program [50] was employed to predict coiled
regions in SMReV protein.
Plasmid construction

Genome segment S7 of SMReV was amplified from
cDNAs obtained above using primers S7-F/R. The PCR

Page 11 of 13

products were digested with EcoR I and Xho I, and then
ligated into vector pcDNA3.1(+) that had been digested
with the same enzymes, which resulted in the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-S7. To generate recombinant
plasmids that contained truncations or mutations in the
5’ portions of SMReV S7 segment, PCR primers that
used pcDNA3.1-S7 as a template were designed and
appear in Additional file 1. PCR products were cut and
ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) vector with corresponding
enzymes. NS32 of SMReV was also cloned into
pcDNA3.1(+) using the same methods and primers
NS32-F/S7-R.
To generate recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-NS16
and pEGFP-NS16, GCRV genomic dsRNA was used as
template for RT-PCR. dsRNA of GCRV was reverse
transcribed using the method described above. cDNA
products were used in a PCR reaction to amplify NS16
using primers NS16-F/R or N3-NS16-F/R (Additional
file 1), respectively. PCR products were cut and ligated
into pcDNA3.1(+) or pEGFP-N3 with corresponding
restriction enzymes.
All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Transfection and cell staining

CIK cells were seeded into 24-well or 6-well cell culture
plates using 199 medium containing 5% of FBS for 24 h
before transfection. Cells were transfected with plasmids
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, U.S.A.) following
the manufacturer’s protocol.
Transfected cells were incubated 24 h at 25°C and
then fixed and stained with Hoechst 33342 as described
previously [51]. All samples were examined under a
Leica DM IRB fluorescence microscope.
Nucleotide sequence accession number

sequences reported here are: HM989930-HM989940.
