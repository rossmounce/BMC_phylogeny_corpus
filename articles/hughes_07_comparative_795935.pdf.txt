Abstract
Background: The diversity of parasites attacking a host varies substantially among different host
species. Understanding the factors that explain these patterns of parasite diversity is critical to
identifying the ecological principles underlying biodiversity. Seabirds (Charadriiformes,
Pelecaniformes and Procellariiformes) and their ectoparasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) are ideal
model groups in which to study correlates of parasite species richness. We evaluated the relative
importance of morphological (body size, body weight, wingspan, bill length), life-history (longevity,
clutch size), ecological (population size, geographical range) and behavioural (diving versus nondiving) variables as predictors of louse diversity on 413 seabird hosts species. Diversity was
measured at the level of louse suborder, genus, and species, and uneven sampling of hosts was
controlled for using literature citations as a proxy for sampling effort.
Results: The only variable consistently correlated with louse diversity was host population size
and to a lesser extent geographic range. Other variables such as clutch size, longevity,
morphological and behavioural variables including body mass showed inconsistent patterns
dependent on the method of analysis.
Conclusion: The comparative analysis presented herein is (to our knowledge) the first to test
correlates of parasite species richness in seabirds. We believe that the comparative data and
phylogeny provide a valuable framework for testing future evolutionary hypotheses relating to the
diversity and distribution of parasites on seabirds.

Background
Avian ectoparasitic lice have a widespread geographic and
host distribution, making them excellent models for
exploring the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of
host-parasite associations. However, little is known about
which host factors influence avian louse diversity. Comparative studies on correlates of parasite species richness
have mainly focused on mammals [1-3] and have
revealed host range size, body mass and diet as factors
influencing parasite species richness [4]. Other studies
have also found support for an effect of host basal meta-

bolic rate [5], geographic latitude [6] and population density [2]. Species richness of avian parasites is also known
to co-vary with host body size, range size, habitat, phylogeny, latitude and immune defences [7,8]. However, work
specific to ectoparasites showed that tropical birds have a
similar louse diversity to temperate species and did not
find a correlation between louse species richness and any
of the 13 host variables examined (e.g., host body size,
density, geographic range, microhabitat use, standard
dimensions of bill, foot and toenail morphology, etc)
after controlling for sampling effort and phylogeny [9].

Additionally, patterns of correlation vary between the two
lice suborders. Møller and Rózsa [10] showed that host
immune response does influence lice diversity in the
amblyceran lice, which feed on skin and blood, but not in
ischnoceran lice, which live on feathers and feed on keratin.
The studies on avian lice have been mainly focused on
land birds and altricial species (passerines, woodpeckers,
owls, etc). In this paper we focus on seabirds and a broad
range of host morphological characters, life history traits,
and extrinsic factors such as geographic range. The seabird-louse system offers some unique opportunities, as
there are three distinct clades of "seabirds": the Procellariiformes (albatrosses and petrels), Pelecaniformes (gannets, boobies, cormorants, shags, pelicans and frigate
birds), and the Charadriiformes (gulls, skuas, auks and
their allies); and these birds are host to both suborders of
lice (Ischnocera and Amblycera). The presence of these
"ecological replicates" [11] permits stronger tests of
hypotheses concerning correlates of parasite diversification, because we have multiple lineages available for testing. In view of the disparate phylogenetic histories of the
Ischnocera and Amblycera, and clear ecological differences between these two suborders [10,12], louse diversity was measured with the suborders separated, and
combined (total lice species richness). Classical taxonomic practice assumed a high degree of host specificity
[13], although some described lice are believed to infect
hosts from various avian families on multiple continents.
Thus, we used a fourth measure of richness, i.e. genera
richness, to partly resolve the problem of overestimating
taxonomic richness due to the uncertainty of morpho-species. Indeed, recent molecular analyses of Dennyus lice
based primarily on mitochondrial sequences have
revealed a wealth of genetic diversity among parasite lineages that is not always apparent in their morphology
[14,15]. Including parasite phylodiversity would provide
a more objective means of measuring parasite richness
[16] but this method would entail a substantial reduction
in our sample size due to insufficient phylogenetic sampling of the Phthiraptera and thus was not included in this
study. We collected data to determine whether our four
measures of lice richness (Amblyceran richness,
Ischnoceran richness, total lice species richness, lice genera richness) were influenced by the following sets of factors.
Host morphology and mass
While the plumage of a host bird seems like a uniform
environment, it is actually a series of interconnected
microhabitats partitioned by the different feather types
present on the wings, back, head, and rump. Different
species of lice are morphologically and behaviourally
adapted to exploiting these niches on their host [17],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/227

hence several species of lice may coexist on the same host
species. As larger-bodied hosts represent a larger surface
area and probably offer more niches for colonization
[8,18], the diversity of lice is expected to increase with
host body mass. Similarly, longer wings and larger bodies
are expected to provide a larger number of niches for lice
to colonize. The differential ability of birds to preen or
groom various parts of their bodies also exerts a major
selection pressure on louse which may affect their diversity on a host. One study has shown a correlation between
the fine structure of the bill tip and louse abundance [9].
Since preening by the bill tip plays a major role in avian
defense against lice [19], measures of bill morphology
may also co-vary with measures of louse richness in birds.
Birds with shorter bills are likely to be more able to preen
than larger billed species like the pelican and therefore
likely to have a lower lice species diversity.
Life history
Longer-lived hosts could harbour greater parasite diversity
because they encounter more parasite species during their
lifetimes [20,21] and host species with lower mortality
could also increase the ability of parasites to become
established on a host population [22]. Small clutch sizes
are also predicted to reduce parasite prevalence and limit
parasite establishment. Indeed, investigators have argued
that species that live in conditions with increased abundance of ectoparasites should evolve reduced clutch size
[23,24]. This is likely to be the case for hosts infested with
lice (generation time of approximately 21 days for wing
lice [25]), whereas ectoparasites with long generation
times are likely to favour increased clutch size [24,26,27].
Total population size and geographic range
Interspecific and intraspecific interactions generate a network through which parasites spread within or between
species [28]. Factors that increase the parasite's reproductive success, such as host population density, rates of
among-host contact, and encounter rates with parasites,
should correlate positively with parasite species richness.
Recent studies have confirmed host density as a significant
predictor of parasite richness in mammals [29], and similar results may be expected with total host population size
[2] as the size of the parasite community may be influenced through island biogeographic effects (larger populations corresponding to larger island habitats). A larger
host population would increase the chances of colonization and would provide more resources for exploitation
by the colonizing parasite. The geographic range of a host
may also influence patterns of parasite species richness if
the risk of being colonised by a louse varies among geographical locations, or if a host is exposed to a wider diversity of habitats at the population and species level. A host
species with a larger geographical range may occupy more
different habitats, or come into contact with a larger

number of other species, leading to higher parasite species
richness [30-32]. Additionally, a larger geographical range
may indicate that a species has a larger number of host
individuals, increasing the likelihood that more parasites
become established [33].
Bird behaviour
Host behaviour may also play a role in determining the
parasite richness. For example, Felsõ and Rózsa [34]
showed that lice genera richness was significantly lower in
diving birds in contrast to non-diving birds. They put forward three hypotheses to explain these differences: (1) the
louse richness is affected by the presence of water, (2) the
plumage of diving and non-diving birds differ and (3) the
preen-oil may differ between the two diving behaviours.
These findings will be further tested with our dataset.
Other behavioural observations such as time spent preening and nesting density may also affect the ectoparasite
richness, unfortunately these types of behavioural observations are either rarely reported in the literature or inconsistently measured between species.
Host diversification
A number of studies have shown that at least some seabirds and their lice do cospeciate [13,35,36]. This coevolutionary interaction between lice and their hosts could
have increased the diversity of lice as a result of specialization onto their diversifying hosts. However, despite the
presumed importance of the role of coevolutionary interactions in diversification, the evidence is limited
[3,11,37]. In this study, we test whether the seabird diversification and lice diversity are correlated and the extent to
which louse diversity varies across the three seabird
orders.

To summarise the predictions, we expect more parasites
on large long-lived and non-diving birds with short bills,
large clutch sizes, large geographical ranges and large population sizes. These predictions are likely to co-vary. Additionally, we predict that there will be more parasites on

more diverse groups of hosts. By focusing on three clades
of seabirds and including multiple predictor variables, we
can attempt to distinguish among confounding or correlated factors. Moreover, studying both Ischnocera and
Amblycera together and separately may reveal the differences in patterns specific to one group as well as patterns
applicable to all lice. However, if cospeciation is prevalent, host phylogeny is likely to be at least as important as
host ecology in determining the composition of the parasite community, because the parasite community of a host
species has likely been inherited from its ancestor, hence
we also incorporated phylogenetic information in our
analyses by using independent contrasts.

Results
Lice diversity on seabirds
The variables used for the analyses and information on
sample size are summarised in Table 1, (see also Addtional Files 1, 3 and 3). Population size was normally distributed according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov one
sample test (D = 0.0611, p-value = n.s.) and geographic
range was left-skewed (D = 0.2662, p-value < 0.01). A
total of 440 different lice species from 37 genera were
found on the 413 bird species. The distribution of parasites was highly aggregated, with most birds having 2 or
fewer parasites and a few hosts having 10 or more parasitic lice. As expected we found a strong correlation
between the sampling effort to which each bird species
was studied and the number of parasitic lice species
recorded, and this was true for both species (t412 = 5.8, P <
0.001) and genera richness (t412 = 8.2, P < 0.0001) using
Google Scholar citations, however, when using Zoological
Record citations, the association was not significant. Zoological Record citations were affected by a number of outliers so this measure of sampling effort was excluded from
further analyses.

We found that the average number of lice (Ischnocera and
Amblycera combined) in the three different bird orders
was significantly different (F410,2= 18.49, P < 0.01)

before and after controlling for sampling effort using
Google Scholar. The Procellariformes had significantly
higher average taxonomic richness than the Pelecaniformes (t164 = -6.83, P < 0.0001) and the Charadriiformes (t148 = -6.04, P < 0.0001) when controlling for
sampling. When comparing the Ischnocera diversity (0–
10 Ischnocera per host) on the three bird orders, we found
a significant difference (F410,2 = 6.17, P < 0.001, Fig 1A)
with significantly more Ischnocera on Charadriiformes
than Pelecaniformes and more Ischnocera on Procellariiformes than Charadriiformes. After controlling for sampling effort, there was still a significant difference in the
average number of lice between the three bird orders
(F410,2 = 23.95, P < 0.001, Fig 1C). In the Amblycera suborder (0–3 amblyceran lice per host) there was also a significant difference in the parasite species richness between
the orders (F410,2 = 4.59, P = 0.01 Fig 1B and F410,2 =
17.57, P < 0.0001 after controlling for sampling effort, Fig
1D).
Seabird phylogeny and phylogenetic patterning of
variables
In the PAUP ratchet analysis, 283 out of 2000 trees had
the shortest length of 30618 (CI = 0.185, RI = 0.602, RC =
0.111). The majority rule consensus of these trees was
congruent with the family and subfamily level relationships of molecular studies of shorebirds (Charadriiformes) [38-40] except for the Stercorarini which is sister
to the Alcinae in Thomas et al. [40], whereas here they
form paraphyletic groups. The Pelecaniformes do not
form a monophyletic order due to the paraphyly of the
Phaethontidae as previously illustrated in Ericson [39]
and discussed in greater detail in Kennedy and Spencer
[41] and Kennedy et al. [42]. However, unlike the phylogeny of Kennedy and Spencer [41], the Fregatidae are sister
to the Phaethontidae, perhaps as a result of long branch
attraction [42]. The relationships within the Procellariiformes are also mainly congruent with previous studies
[43]. Although the basal relationships are not highly supported by the bootstrap support, we prefer to use a fully
resolved phylogeny for all comparative analyses, which
we selected to be the most congruent with previous phylogenetic studies of seabirds (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, see
also Additional Files 4 and 5). We take one of these phylogenies as a hypothesis open for future testing with additional data and new methods.

Tests of the correlation between parasite diversity and
host phylogeny (λ tests) provided support for measures of
PTR being associated among closely related host taxa.
Prior to performing this test we controlled for sampling
effort by regressing PTR measures on Google Scholar citation hits using a quadratic model (asymptotic); residuals
from this analysis were then used as adjusted measures of
PTR (r-PTR). All measures of r-PTR and of host traits

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/227

showed some degree of phylogenetic patterning (λ > 0,
Table 2). Given the significance of the phylogeny, both
the non-phylogenetic and independent contrasts are
reported. The focused (single predictor variable) tests are
used to determine the sign of the relationship between the
host traits and r-PTR; and to make certain our conclusions
are robust, we focus on the findings where the phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic analyses yield the same result.
As a number of the host traits might be non-independent
or apparent only after controlling for other variables, we
place more weight on the results from multivariate tests
than from the focused tests and in particular multivariate
tests calculated from contrasts.
Morphology
The colinearity test showed that all bird morphological
variables were highly correlated (Table 3) but none of the
life-history or ecological variables correlated highly with
the morphological variables. Therefore, we carried out a
principal component analysis with the morphological
variables. The loadings shown in Table 4 suggest that principal axis 1 (PC1) is inversely related to overall size
because all loadings are similar and negative. Hence, PC1
separates the larger birds from the smaller species. PC2
relates mainly to bill length, and PC3 separates the heavy
birds with small wings to the light birds with large wings.
PC4 principally relates to the body size. The positions of
the different bird species on the four principal component
axes (eigenvalues) were used for calculating the contrasts
and in all multiple regression analyses, these axes all being
independent from each other.

In focused tests (single predictor variables against r-PTR),
residual species richness was not significantly correlated
to body mass in non-phylogenetic analyses and negatively
correlated in phylogenetic tests and so was body size in
contrast to the positive relationship predicted (Table 5).
PC3 (body mass/wingspan) did enter the multiple regression model with the highest log likelihood in non-phylogenetic (Table 6) and in phylogenetic analyses (Table 7).
None of the morphological variables are significantly correlated to the residual genus richness in focused tests
(Table 5) although the PC1-4 are present in the top three
non-phylogenetic multiple regression models (Table 6)
and PC1 enters the top three phylogenetic multiple regression models (Table 7). The residual Ischnocera richness is
negatively correlated to body mass and body size in
focused tests (Table 5) and PC1, PC3 and PC4 enter the
top non-phylogenetic multiple regression model (Table
6). On the other hand, residual Amblycera richness is significantly correlated to wingspan in non-phylogenetic
focused tests (Table 5) and negatively correlated to body
mass in phylogenetic tests and all 4 PCs enter the nonphylogenetic (Table 6) and phylogenetic multiple regression models (Table 7). This suggests that morphology

might play a more important role in predicting Amblycera
species richness than Ischnocera richness. In general, it
would appear that morphology does not play a consistent
role in predicting the r-PTR and in the cases where body
mass and/or body size do correlate to the r-PTR, the relationship is negative in contrast to our predictions.
Life history
Residual species richness was significantly correlated to
longevity and clutch size in non-phylogenetic focused
tests (Table 5) and in non-phylogenetic multiple regressions (Table 6) but was no longer significantly correlated
when the phylogeny was taken into account (Table 5 and
Table 7). Residual genus richness was significantly correlated to clutch size in non-phylogenetic focused tests
(Table 5) and in both multiple regression tests while longevity was only a significant predictor in multiple regression tests (Table 6 and 7). Clutch size was also

significantly negatively correlated with residual
Ischnocera richness, although clutch size did not enter the
top phylogenetic multiple regression analyses (Table 7).
Whereas longevity was correlated positively to residual
Amblycera richness in non-phylogenetic focused tests
(Table 5). Longevity and clutch size were found in both
multiple regression analyses for residual Amblycera richness (Table 6 and 7). Thus, longevity and clutch size
appear to be predictors for residual genus richness and
residual Amblycera richness but not species richness and
Ischnocera richness. Longevity was positively correlated
with genus richness and Amblycera richness as expected
whereas clutch size was negatively correlated contrary to
our predictions.
Total population size and geographic range
Population size offers the most compelling results as it is
positively correlated to all measures of r-PTR in focused

for all multiple regression analyses except for genus richness when controlling for phylogeny (Table 6 and 7 and
Figure 9). Geographic range is positively correlated in
phylogenetic focused tests (Table 5) but negatively correlated to residual genus richness in the phylogenetic
focused test. Geographic range also appears to be an
important predictor as it is significantly positively correlated to all measures of r-PTR in phylogenetic focused tests
(Table 5) and in all non-phylogenetic multiple regression
models (Table 6). Geographic range is also a predictor of
Ischnocera richness and Amblycera richness in phylogenetic multiple regressions (Table 7).

Diving behaviour
Diving behaviour was a significant predictor of residual
genus richness in phylogenetic focused tests. Significantly
more genera were found on non-diving birds as expected
but this correlation was not significant for any of the other
measures of r-PTR.
Correlation between host diversification and parasite
taxonomic richness
The different measures of r-PTR were not significantly correlated with the evolutionary diversification of seabirds as
determined in MacroCAIC. Thus, parasite diversity (louse
taxa per host species) did not differ between birds from

relatively diverse clades compared to the less diverse
clades. The results were the same for all measures of r-PTR
and for both measures of host diversification (RRD and
PDI, Table 8). These results are also supported by the lack
of significant relationships between bird order and r-PTR
in the multiple regression.

To summarise the results, it would appear that morphological characteristics such as mass, size, wingspan and
bill length play a minor role in predicting the r-PTR and
the patterns observed are inconsistent across the different
measures of r-PTR. Morphological traits may play a greater
role in predicting Amblycera richness than Ischnocera

richness. Longevity and clutch size are predictors in residual Amblycera and genus richness but the results are not
as compelling for Ischnocera and total species richness.
Population size and to a lesser extent geographic range are
the predictors that show the most consistent correlations
to all measures of r-PTR providing the most compelling
support for the role of these two variables as predictors of
parasite richness. Diving behaviour was only correlated in
the phylogenetic test for residual genera richness. And
finally, the diversification of birds was not correlated to
any of the measures of parasite richness.

Discussion
As discussed elsewhere [21,32] differential sampling
effort must be taken into account when investigating parasite community structure. In the present study, correction for variation in the number of citations of
parasitological studies using Google Scholar citations for
each host species provides perhaps the most pragmatic
method of control of potentially confounding effect. The
inclusion of the phylogeny was also critical for testing the
evolutionary hypotheses as demonstrated by the correlation between the phylogeny and the various host traits
and the r-PTR measures.
Bird morphology and mass were not consistently correlated to parasite species richness in our study although
body mass and size did enter into the multivariate regression models for some measures of r-PTR. This contrasts
with a number of previous studies that have recognized
host body size as an important determinant of parasite
richness [4,9,44,45]. Larger-bodied hosts may represent

larger islands for parasites to colonize, suggesting that
more parasites will be found on larger hosts. Indeed, a
number of mammalian studies found strong positive relationships between body mass and parasite species richness [1-3] but other studies on birds also found that host
body size showed no relationship with parasite species
richness [8] leading to the suggestion that the correlation
between host body size and parasite community richness
may vary between certain host groups [8]. Additionally,
the same patterns are not always observed across different
taxonomic groups of parasites, for example, Gregory et al.
[45] found a positive correlation between host weight and
the number of trematode and nematode species, but not
cestodes. We also found slight differences between the
two parasite groups studied (Amblycera and Ischnocera)
with morphology playing a greater role in Amblycera species richness as in a previous study [10]. Thus, the role of
body mass and size as correlates of lice species diversity in
seabirds cannot be entirely dismissed but these variables
do not appear to be as important as in mammals for predicting parasite species richness.
The life-history traits (longevity and clutch size) were
present in the top phylogenetic multiple regressions for
Amblycera richness suggesting that species richness of
Amblycera is more closely correlated to host traits than in
the Ischnocera. The lack of significant morphological and
life history correlates for Ischnocera species richness in the
multiple regression as opposed to the Amblycera seems to
be inherent to the suborder. Neither Møller and Rozsa
[10] nor Clayton and Walther [9] found significant correlates for the Ischnocera species richness. Correlates of spe-

cies diversity in the Ischnocera may be more difficult to
discover than those of amblyceran lice perhaps due to the
differences in feeding behaviour of the two suborders,
although this hypothesis is highly speculative. Amblycera
come into direct contact with their host when feeding on
skin or blood leading to a correlation between the
immune response of birds and Amblycera richness [10]
and perhaps also the correlation we found here with longevity and clutch size. On the other hand, Ischnocera lice
feed on the keratin of feathers, thus indirectly affecting
their host through feather damage. As the feather represents the niche of an Ischnocera louse, perhaps the diversity of Ischnocera lice will change with the diversity of

feather types on a host, although this host trait is unlikely
to vary sufficiently within bird families to detect significant relationships at a species level.
By placing the most confidence on multivariate tests that
take into account the non-independence of variables, the
strongest results emerged from analyses of the effects of
population size with all four measures of taxonomic richness (ischnoceran, amblyceran, overall species richness
and genus richness). Our analyses thus suggest that epidemiological processes operating within a species provide
explanations for broad patterns of parasite biodiversity.
Indeed, hosts with large population sizes may influence

the acquisition of parasite species as they may be more
likely to come into contact with conspecifics and thus
facilitate the spread of the parasite through the population and influence the size of the parasite community
through island biogeographic effects (a larger population
representing a larger island for colonization by the parasite). Moreover, species with greater geographical ranges
also have greater parasite richness and this might be
because they come into contact with a greater number of
habitats and parasite species. Thus, as predicted, species
with larger population sizes and geographical ranges have
more parasites. However, the positive correlation between
geographic range and parasite richness could be a result of
sampling bias that was not controlled for. Indeed, it is
possible that parasite richness is underestimated in nonsocial territorial birds compared to colonial birds as lice
are more aggregated in non-social birds [46] and therefore
the sampling of lice on territorial birds which usually have
larger geographical ranges is likely to be less complete.
Thus, the positive relationship between host geographic
range and parasite richness could either be a true effect of

island biogeography, a sampling bias inadequately controlled for or, most probably, the sum of both.
Diving behaviour also explains parasite richness but only
in the case of genera richness in the phylogenetic test,
these results support a previous study on correlates of parasite richness with diving behaviour [34] but it is interesting to note that the same pattern was not observed for the
other three measures of parasite richness (total species
richness, Amblycera richness and Ischnocera richness).
Using phylodiversity as a measure of parasite richness
would help to determine whether these differences are
caused by the over-estimation of species due to uncertain
morphological taxonomy.
Although most studies on lice have focused on patterns of
cospeciation within small clades of hosts and parasites
and have found strong evidence for cophylogeny
[11,13,35], in this study looking at the broader pattern of
host diversity in relation to parasite diversity, we did not
find a correlation between host diversification and para-

site species richness. Thus, it appears that diversification
of seabird lineages do not provide greater opportunities
for increasing parasite species richness, unlike studies of
host diversification in primates that found a strong positive relationship between parasite richness and host diversification [3]. Further studies on a broader range of birds

and parasites (including microparasites) would be helpful
to gain a better understanding of the relationship between
bird diversification and parasite richness.
Unfortunately, the variables used in this study do not
always explain the variation in parasite richness in phylo-

genetic tests. In particular, the Akaike weights of the multiple regression models in phylogenetic tests is not very
high and can be interpreted as a low probability that the
models for the phylogenetically corrected data is the 'true'
model. This could indicate that we have not included the
variables crucial to understanding the diversity of ectoparasites, i.e. that different ecological processes not included
here affect the ability of different ectoparasites to establish. This could also be caused by the noise in the data as
a result of the indirect measurement of sampling effort
(i.e. citation counts) being used. Nonetheless, the
approach taken in this study provides the best inference
given the data and the set of a priori models. Akaike's general approach allows the best model in the set to be identified, but also allows the rest of the models to be easily
ranked. New or more elaborate hypotheses can be added
in the future and hypotheses with little empirical support
can gradually be dropped from consideration.
A number of issues need to be raised with regards to the
data. Firstly, the species richness measures do not represent parasite communities, as they are the sum of all parasite species found in several host populations; thus, there
may be no single population of host where all parasite
species would co-occur. Studying the parasite species
recorded for different host species in one geographical
location was not possible here due to insufficient information in the literature relating to collection location.
Secondly, the data on parasite richness are unlikely to be
of uniform quality for the different hosts, due mainly to
the diversity of methods used by different investigators.
This effect could not be controlled for in this study, but it
probably would not have much of an impact on the
results. The latter two issues have successfully been taken
into account in a study of Neotropical bird lice [9]. Clayton and Walther [9] sampled using consistent methodologies in a single geographic region and did not find any
correlation between louse species richness and any of the
13 host variables examined (including host body size,
density and geographic range). This could be a result of
controlling for phylogeny and sampling effort or the
small variation in louse species richness (from 0–3 species). Variation in species richness in our study is unlikely
to be a problem for the overall lice species richness (0–13
species), genus richness (0–7) and Ischnocera richness
(0–10) but might have been for the Amblycera richness
(0–3) as it is more difficult to detect correlations involving
variables that show little variation.

Conclusion
Broad patterns of parasite diversity were explained by a
relatively small number of host characteristics, especially
host population size and geographic range and differences
were observed between the two louse suborders. In particular, morphology and life-history are a better predictor of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/227

Amblycera richness than Ischnocera richness. Further
details on bird ecology will allow us to investigate the role
of a larger number of predictor variables. For example, further research is needed to gather data such as local population density, home range and daily journey length,
which could help to account for further variation among
host species. We also need to determine whether parasite
species richness is higher as a result of greater opportunities for host sharing or host shifting among sympatric seabirds. For this we need precise geographical range maps
and measures of overlap. Increased overlap could increase
opportunities for specialist parasites to host shift. Since
many ectoprarasitic lice of birds are highly host specific
[47], the richness of parasite communities may depend
more on which parasite lineages host shift, than on evolutionary changes in host size or habitat. One approach for
resolving this would be to examine variation in the host
specificity for particular lice species using host phylodiversity. A better predictor of parasite species richness remains
to be discovered and it may be that this understanding can
be achieved only by gathering detailed data of lice communities on individual hosts (e.g., wing versus body versus head lice) rather than the much broader analysis using
species richness.

Methods
Taxonomic richness of lice and controlling for sampling
effort
Four different measures of parasite taxonomic richness
(PTR) were compiled from the world checklist of chewing
lice [47] available from BioCorder [48] for 413 bird species (Charadriiformes, Pelecaniformes, Procellariiformes): Ischnoceran species richness, Amblyceran
species richness, overall parasite species richness and genera richness. To control for uneven sampling effort in estimating PTR, we followed previous researchers
[2,10,32,49]. The record of a parasite on a host species
may be missing in the literature either because it does not
occur on that host or because the parasitic fauna of the
host has been insufficiently sampled [32,49]. To determine how well a species had been studied for parasites,
sampling effort was estimated in two ways. First, we
assessed the intensity of parasitological surveys focused
on different bird species using the citation index in the
Web of Science Zoological Records (ZR). The number of
hits on host scientific name mentioned with any of the
terms "parasit*", "pathogen*", "helminth*", "mite*",
"louse", "lice" was used as a measure of sampling effort
(where "*" acts as a truncation sign). Second, we used the
number of hits on host scientific name and "mite OR
mites OR parasite OR parasites OR parasitic OR helminths
OR helminth OR lice OR louse" in Google Scholar (GS),
that does not allow truncation signs. Google Scholar provides all unique citations from books, journals and
reports (different versions of the same reference were not

included in the citation count). The asymptotic model
between the citation index and the PTR (parasite taxonomic richness) is expected to be better than a linear
model. This was tested using the Akaike Information Criterion as a measure of the model fit and only significantly
correlated measures of citation were used in further analyses. Thus, we included sampling effort by calculating the
residual PTR, i.e. regressing the parasite richness on measures of sampling effort, according to the best fit model.
The residual PTR was then used in all further analyses.
Data on bird characteristics
Using existing compilations of data [50-52] as a starting
point, we created a database of comparative data on birds,
which is available (together with details on sources of
data) at [53]. We included the following morphological
variables: body mass, wingspan, body size (bill-tip to tailtip) and bill length. Longevity is one of the key factors that
could influence parasite diversity and was measured as
maximum recorded longevity in months with most of the
data retrieved from Carey and Judge [52] and clutch size
was the average size from the different data sources.
Unfortunately, measures of social contact within and
between species such as local population density are not
easily obtainable for seabirds. Thus, using Bird Life International [54], we gathered estimated global population
size (number of individuals) and estimated geographic
range in square kilometres. Diving behaviour information
was also gathered as a categorical variable from a number
of sources including a previous comparative study [34].
All continuous host characteristics were log-transformed
and checked for collinearity to avoid adding collinear variables into the same model using a conservative cut-off
value (correlation coefficient r = 0.6). We conducted a
principal component analysis on variables that were
strongly correlated and used the eigenvalues of each species on the independent principal component axes for all
multiple regressions. The distribution of the log-transformed population size and geographic range was compared to the normal distribution with the KolmogorovSmirnov test to assess biases in the data.
Comparative methods
Although parasite taxonomic diversity and the measures
of sampling effort might not be shared through common
descent in birds, they may be correlated with other host
characteristics that are inherited (e.g. body size). Thus,
traits for species cannot be considered statistically independent observations because cases of convergent evolution are mixed with cases of similarity due to common
ancestry and thus phylogeny cannot be ignored [55-57].

Thus, we used a phylogeny built from all the available
nucleotide sequences on NCBI extracted on the 30th of
November 2006. A supermatrix of the data was con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/227

structed using TaxMan [58] where the following genes
were concatenated for 407 taxa: 1041 bases of CytB, 695
bases of 12S rRNA, 1551 bases of COX1, 684 bases of
ATPase6, 1047 bases of NADH2 and 2871 bases of RAG1.
We implemented parsimony ratchet searches [59,60]
using PAUP [61] by performing 10 independent Parsimony Ratchet searches of 200 iterations each. Bootstrapping 100 heuristic replicates was used to determine the
level of support for individual nodes.
We assessed whether phylogenetic correction was needed
for our data by calculating Pagel's λ statistic for each measure of PTR and for each host trait using the software program Continuous implemented in BayesTraits [62-64].
The λ statistic tests whether a trait is evolving among species as if the species were independent (λ = 0) by determining if phylogeny correctly predicts patterns of
covariance among species. We used a likelihood ratio test
to compare the maximum likelihood estimate of lambda
for each trait to a lambda estimate of zero, and assumed
phylogenetic patterning when the lambda estimate for a
trait was significantly different to zero.
We calculated statistically independent linear contrasts for
each variable according to the method developed by
Felsenstein [65] using the computer program CAIC [66].
We also performed non-phylogenetic analyses using
actual species values as comparisons of phylogenetic and
non-phylogenetic results can reveal the presence of confounding factors [67]. The analyses were carried out using
log-transformed data and the branch lengths estimated in
PAUP, i.e. assuming a gradual evolution model as implemented by Purvis and Rambaut [66] against the four different measures of parasite richness controlled for
sampling effort (r-PTR). Continuous variables were analysed using crunch and the categorical variable "diving
behaviour" was analysed with brunch.
First, we conducted analyses of all single predictor variables against the PTR controlled for sampling effort using
residuals from the regression of the number of parasites
for each host on the number of citation counts (focused
tests). Contrasts were calculated for the residual PTR and
the log-transformed variables.
Second, we used multiple regression to investigate the
continuous variables that explain variation of r-PTR: the
morphological principal components and life-history and
ecological traits (population size, longevity, clutch size
and geographic range). In phylogenetic tests, the contrasts
were calculated for the r-PTR and principal components
prior to multiple regression analyses. The generalised linear model for the contrasts was forced through the origin.
We fitted models to our data set using 'glm' in R and compared them using AIC rather than using a stepwise tech-

nique which has widely recognized limitations [68]. AIC
is a likelihood-based measure of model fit that accounts
for the number of parameters estimated in a model, (i.e.
models with a large number of parameters are penalized
more heavily than the ones with smaller numbers of
parameters). The model with the lowest AIC has the 'best'
relative fit, given the number of parameters included [69].
We tested a model with all the variables, a model with just
the morphological variables, one with just the life-history
traits (longevity and clutch size), one with just the population and distribution variables (population size and
geographic range), a model with life-history traits, population and distribution variables, a model with all the significant variables form the focused tests and models with
each single predictor variable (8 models) and in non-phylogenetic tests, bird order was also tested as a predictor of
parasite species richness. In order to control for correlations between body mass and other traits, the first principal component (with high body mass loading) was forced
into the models if it had not already been included (11
models). Thus, 26 models for non-phylogenetic data and
25 models for phylogenetic data were tested for each
measure of PTR (see Additional File 3 for the list of models). The plausibility of these competing statistical models
was then assessed using penalized log likelihood criteria
(AIC = -2ln L + 2k, L being the maximum likelihood estimate and k the number of free parameters). The raw AIC
values were then transformed to AIC model weights as in
Burnham [70]. Akaike weight, wi, provides the weight of
evidence in favor of a model i according to:

where Δi = AICi - minAIC.
To test whether there is an association between parasite
species richness and host lineage diversity, we used the
computer program MacroCAIC 1.1.1 [71]. This program
generated phylogenetically independent contrasts for PTR
(controlling for sampling effort) at each node with three
or more descendants and compares this to the number of
host species within the clade represented at each node. We
used the two measures of host phylogenetic diversity
available: the relative rate difference (RRD) calculated as
the natural logarithm of the ratio of the number of species
in sister clades; and, the proportional dominance index
(PDI) calculated as the ratio of the number of species in
one of two clades against the total number of species in
both clades combined [71].
