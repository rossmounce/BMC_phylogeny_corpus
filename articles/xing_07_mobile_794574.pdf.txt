Abstract
Background: Guenons (tribe Cercopithecini) are a species-rich group of primates that have
attracted considerable attention from both primatologists and evolutionary biologists. The
complex speciation pattern has made the elucidation of their relationships a challenging task, and
many questions remain unanswered. SINEs are a class of non-autonomous mobile elements and are
essentially homoplasy-free characters with known ancestral states, making them useful genetic
markers for phylogenetic studies.
Results: We identified 151 novel Alu insertion loci from 11 species of tribe Cercopithecini, and
used these insertions and 17 previously reported loci to infer a phylogenetic tree of the tribe
Cercopithecini. Our results robustly supported the following relationships: (i) Allenopithecus is the
basal lineage within the tribe; (ii) Cercopithecus lhoesti (L'Hoest's monkey) forms a clade with
Chlorocebus aethiops (African green monkey) and Erythrocebus patas (patas monkey), supporting a
single arboreal to terrestrial transition within the tribe; (iii) all of the Cercopithecus except C. lhoesti
form a monophyletic group; and (iv) contrary to the common belief that Miopithecus is one of the
most basal lineages in the tribe, M. talapoin (talapoin) forms a clade with arboreal members of
Cercopithecus, and the terrestrial group (C. lhoesti, Chlorocebus aethiops and E. patas) diverged from
this clade after the divergence of Allenopithecus. Some incongruent loci were found among the
relationships within the arboreal Cercopithecus group. Several factors, including incomplete lineage
sorting, concurrent polymorphism and hybridization between species may have contributed to the
incongruence.
Conclusion: This study presents one of the most robust phylogenetic hypotheses for the tribe
Cercopithecini and demonstrates the advantages of SINE insertions for phylogenetic studies.

Background
Guenons (tribe Cercopithecini) are a species-rich group of
primates with a distribution throughout sub Saharan
Africa. With their diverse morphology, ecology, behavior
and social organizations, guenons have attracted considerable attention from both primatologists and evolutionary biologists [1,2]. In addition, some species in the tribe
(e.g. Chlorocebus aethiops) have been widely used in biomedical studies [3-5]. Based on Groves' classification [6],
the tribe Cercopithecini consists of five genera (Erythrocebus, Chlorocebus, Cercopithecus, Miopithecus and Allenopithecus) comprising 36 species. The evolutionary history
of guenons may include a rapid basal radiation, and it is
very likely that speciation is an ongoing process within the
tribe [1,7]. This complex speciation pattern has made the
elucidation of the species relationships a challenging task,
and many questions remain unanswered about the tribe
composition (e.g. inclusion of Allenopithecus in the tribe),
genera definitions (e.g. whether to consider Chlorocebus as
a separate genus) and in particular, the phylogenetic relationships among genera and species [6,8,9].
To elucidate the phylogeny of tribe Cercopithecini, several
molecular studies have been conducted, and some aspects
of their phylogeny have been inferred with a degree of
confidence [7,10-14]. Nevertheless, two major questions
remain unanswered:
• (i) is genus Cercopithecus paraphyletic and what are the
species relationships within the genus?
• (ii) what is the branching order of the major groups?
Regarding the first question, Cercopithecus was previously
considered to be a monophyletic group [10], but recent
molecular [7,13,14] and karyotype studies [11] support
grouping of the terrestrial taxa, Cercopithecus lhoesti species
group, Chlorocebus and Erythrocebus, into a single lineage.
This topology supports a single arboreal to terrestrial transition within the tribe, and divides the current genus Cercopithecus into a paraphyletic group. For the phylogenetic
relationships among the arboreal members of Cercopithecus, several types of molecular data, including X and Y
chromosome DNA sequences, protein sequences and
karyotypes, recognize a clade containing a cephus species
group and a mitis group. X chromosome DNA and protein
studies also support a neglectus + diana + mona group clade
(see summary in Tosi et al [7]). Nevertheless, a robust phylogenetic hypothesis of lower-level relationships among
arboreal Cercopithecus species is not yet confirmed, as
there is discordant evidence [7,9].
The other major remaining question is the relationships
between the major groups within Cercopithecini. It is
thought that the tribe can be divided into four major

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/5

clades: an arboreal Cercopithecus clade, a terrestrial clade
(C. lhoesti species group, Chlorocebus and Erythrocebus),
Miopithecus and Allenopithecus. Miopithecus and Allenopithecus are usually considered to be the most basal lineages of the tribe [11,15,16]. Although recent studies [7,14]
have provided robust support for the most basal lineage
position of Allenopithecus, the relationships of the other
three major clades (i.e. the arboreal Cercopithecus clade,
the terrestrial clade, and Miopithecus) remain unclear. A set
of molecular markers that are independent of DNA
sequence data may help to resolve these phylogenetic
questions in guenons.
Short interspersed element (SINE) insertions are a class of
retrotransposons that integrate into a genome via an RNA
intermediate [17]. SINE-based phylogenetic systems were
put into practice in the early 1990s [18,19], and certain
unique characteristics make them particularly promising
for evolutionary analyses [20-23]. Briefly, SINEs are usually unidirectional characters, with the absence of the
insertion being the ancestral state. Precise removal of
SINEs is extremely rare after their fixation in the genome,
and is very unlikely to happen in multiple genomes [24].
In addition, SINE-based analysis does not rely directly on
analyzing DNA sequence data, which makes SINEs an
independent complement to traditional DNA-based
molecular studies that focus on sequence substitutions. In
recent years, SINE-based phylogenetic analysis has proven
to be a powerful tool for various levels of phylogenetic
studies, and many controversial phylogenetic relationships that could not be solved using traditional molecular
data have been successfully elucidated [21-23].
Alu elements are the most successful SINEs in primate
genomes in terms of copy number. During primate evolution, Alu elements have proliferated in all primates and
expanded to more than one million copies in the human
genome [25,26]. Several studies have been conducted to
infer primate phylogenetic relationships using Alu elements, including the human, chimpanzee and gorilla trichotomy [27], Old World [28] and New World monkey
phylogeny [29], tarsier affiliation [30], and strepsirrhine
phylogeny [31].
Using a combination of computational data-mining and
PCR-based display methods, we identified 168 Alu insertion loci, which contained a total of 179 Alu insertions
that had integrated into 11 cercopithecine genomes at various times. These insertions were used to construct a
robustly supported phylogenetic hypothesis for the tribe
Cercopithecini. The major relationships are: (i) Allenopithecus is the basal lineage of the tribe; (ii) C. lhoesti
(L'Hoest's monkey) forms a clade with Chlorocebus aethiops (African green monkey) and E. patas (patas monkey),
supporting a single transition to a terrestrial lifestyle; (iii)

all Cercopithecus species except C. lhoesti form a monophyletic group; and (iv) contrary to the usual hypothesis
that Miopithecus is one of the most primitive lineages in
the tribe, our results suggest that the divergence between
the arboreal Cercopithecus group and M. talapoin happened
after the divergence of the terrestrial group.

Results
In total, 168 loci were selected for the phylogenetic analysis. Of these, 144 were identified using PCR display methodology, 7 were collected from available African green
monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) genomic sequences using a
computational data mining approach (see Methods for
details) and 17 loci were selected from a previous study
[28]. All loci were genotyped on a primate panel composed of 12 Old World primate species (Table 1), including 11 species within tribe Cercopithecini, with Pygathrix
nemaeus (red-shanked Douc langur) as the outgroup. Gel
electrophoresis results of five amplifications are shown in
Figure 1. For the potential informative loci (i.e. loci in
which more than one but not all species showed Alu insertion-sized amplicons), all of the PCR amplicons that
appeared to have Alu insertions were sequenced to verify
the presence of the Alu elements.
The sequencing verification recovered 11 loci that contained adjacent independent insertion events (i.e. independent insertions in different species that are within
sufficiently close genomic proximity to be amplified by a
single set of PCR primers; see Discussion for details).
These adjacent independent insertion events were treated
as independent markers in the subsequent analysis. Overall, 179 markers were used for the phylogenetic analysis.
For presence/absence characters in which the absence of
the marker is assumed to be the ancestral state, Dollo parsimony is the most appropriate analysis. Therefore, we

implemented an exhaustive search using Dollo parsimony, designating P. nemaeus as an outgroup taxon. The
analysis indicated that 78 loci were parsimony informative and resulted in two most parsimonious trees; the strict
consensus for these two trees is shown in Figure 2A (219
steps, consistency index = 0.817; homoplasy index =
0.183; retention index = 0.802). A likelihood test for every
branch [32] and 10000 bootstrap replicates were performed. The significance level and the percentage of bootstrap replicates supporting each branch are indicated. A
collapsed version of this tree is shown (Figure 2B), in
which branches that did not garner statistically significant
support based on the likelihood test were collapsed into
polytomies.
The monophyly of the terrestrial group
We identified 10 Alu insertions shared by C. lhoesti, Chlorocebus aethiops and E. patas. This result strongly supported
(p < 0.001) [32] the monophyly of the terrestrial group
and the paraphyly of the previously defined genus Cercopithecus. This result is congruent with the single transition
hypothesis, which states that there was only one transition from an arboreal to terrestrial lifestyle within the
tribe [7,14,33]. Unfortunately, we did not identify enough
informative markers to gain significant support for the
relationships between taxa within the terrestrial group.
The branching order of the major clades
Given the unambiguous clustering of a single terrestrial
clade, our results support the division of the tribe Cercopithecini into four major clades: the arboreal Cercopithecus
species, a terrestrial clade, Miopithecus, and Allenopithecus.
Six Alu insertions were shared by all taxa except A. nigroviridis. This unambiguously placed Allenopithecus as the
basal lineage within the tribe (p < 0.01). Another seven
insertions joined M. talapoin to all arboreal Cercopithecus

species (i.e. C. ascanius, C. cephus, C. petaurista, C. wolfi, C.
diana and C. nictitans). These results suggest that the terrestrial group diverged after Allenopithecus but before the
separation of Miopithecus from the arboreal Cercopithecus
species (p < 0.01). The divergence of Miopithecus and the
monophyly of the six arboreal Cercopithecus species were
supported by nine Alu insertion loci present in all arboreal
taxa but not in Miopithecus (p < 0.01).
The relationships among the arboreal Cercopithecus
species
Of the six arboreal Cercopithecus species we tested, two
clades were well supported. C. ascanius and C. cephus were
clustered together to the exclusion of C. petaurista, based
on four Alu insertions (p < 0.05). The C. ascanius and C.
cephus clade was linked to C. petaurista and C. nictitans by
seven insertions to form a polytomy (p < 0.01). Despite
the relatively strong support for these two nodes, we
should note that there were loci that supported alternative
topologies among the arboreal Cercopithecus species. For
example, when the affiliation of C. diana is considered,
Alu insertions present in C. diana suggested at least four
alternative phylogenetic hypothesis (Figure 3). Two Alu
insertions (TA26 and CD_Yd_40) grouped C. diana with
C. ascanius, C. cephus and C. petaurista, but not C. nictitans.
In contrast, two other Alu elements (CD_Yd_27 and
CN_PY2_53A) were found only in C. diana and C. nictitans. In addition, one marker (CD_PY2_36) supported the
grouping of C. diana, C. nictitans and C. cephus, and one
marker (CD_PY2_41) grouped C. diana, C. wolfi and C.
petaurista together. Owing to this incongruence and the
small number of makers supporting each hypothesis,
none of these hypotheses gained statistically significant
support using the likelihood test.

Another noteworthy result is that a number of Alu insertion loci appeared to be heterozygous in certain species
(e.g. both a filled band and an empty band are present)
(Figures 1B and 1C). Several mechanisms, including
incomplete lineage sorting, concurrent polymorphism
and introgression may have contributed to this finding.

Discussion
The placement of Allenopithecus and Miopithecus
Our results indicate that Allenopithecus is the most basal
lineage of the tribe. A monophyletic terrestrial clade comprising C. lhoesti, E. patas, and Chlorocebus aethiops was the
next to diverge from other guenons after the split of
Allenopithecus, and Miopithecus subsequently diverged
from the rest of arboreal Cercopithecus. This placement of
Miopithecus represents a major difference compared with
other phylogenetic analyses of the Cercopithecini. Despite
the general view that Miopithecus may share some primitive features of the group (e.g. sexual swelling), no studies
to date have provided robust support for a definitive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/5

placement for Miopithecus. For example, in a study using
Y-chromosome DNA data [14], a four-way polytomy for
Allenopithecus; Miopithecus, a terrestrial clade and an arboreal Cercopithecus clade was obtained. Studies using Xchromosome sequences identified Allenopithecus as the
most basal lineage of the tribe, although a three-way polytomy consisting of Miopithecus, the terrestrial clade and
the arboreal Cercopithecus clade persisted [7,14]. Our
results represent the first statistically significant support
for the clustering of Miopithecus with the arboreal Cercopithecus clade.
Phylogenetic relationship of the arboreal Cercopithecus
species
Owing to rapid speciation and the resulting close relationships within the genus Cercopithecus, a detailed lower-level
hypothesis of relationships has been lacking. To date, the
only robustly supported relationships are the separation
of a cephus group + mitis group clade, and a neglectus +
diana + mona group clade [7,14]. In the current study, several relationships within the genus are supported by Alu
insertions that have statistical support. For example, the
clustering of C. ascanius and C. cephus within the cephus
group (represented in this study by C. ascanius; C. cephus
and C. petaurista) is well supported. The close relationship
between the mitis group (represented here by C. nictitans)
and the cephus group is also strongly supported. The diana
group (represented here by C. diana) appears to be basal
within the arboreal Cercopithecus clade. However, this
hypothesis deserves further investigation, owing to the
relatively low level of support for the placement of C.
wolfi. Overall, these results are in good agreement with
previous studies using X and Y chromosome DNA data,
and provide robust independent evidence for the suggested relationships [7,14].
Arboreal to terrestrial lifestyle transition
Our results provide strong support for a single evolutionary transition from arboreality to terrestriality within the
tribe Cercopithecini. The inference of a single transition to
a ground-dwelling lifestyle suggests that such changes in
substrate preference are probably rare in the history of the
primates and therefore may lend greater significance to a
similar change at the beginning of the hominin radiation.
In addition, the guenon transition to a terrestrial lifestyle
is estimated to have occurred at the Miocene/Pliocene
boundary [7]. This is significant because the same time
window brackets the origins of hominin terrestrial bipedalism. Thus, similar factors may have driven early
human ancestors and the terrestrial guenon progenitor to
a largely ground-dwelling way of life.
Incongruent patterns of Alu insertions among lineages
There are three major scenarios in SINE-based phylogenetic analyses that can lead to confounding results: adja-

cent independent insertions, incomplete lineage sorting,
and hybridization between species. Adjacent independent
insertions refer to the scenario that in different species,
different Alu elements are inserted in close genomic proximity and are therefore amplified within the same PCR
amplicon during genotyping. In this study, we sequenced
all informative loci to confirm that the appropriately size
amplicon contained the same Alu insertions, and all loci
containing parallel independent insertions have been
excluded or treated as independent markers (see Results
section). Therefore, the incongruence observed in our current dataset cannot be explained by invoking this explanation.

Miopithecus is inferred with statistically significant support
for the first time. In addition, our observations indicate
that the group of arboreal Cercopithecus species may have
experienced a series of rapid, even simultaneous, speciation events, and thus a number of Alu insertions have
been randomly fixed in different lineages. Hybridization
between different species in the tribe may have also contributed to the complex patterns in our dataset. Owing to
the unidirectional insertion property and extremely low
removal rate of fixed SINE insertions, these markers can
be used to construct phylogenetic hypothesis with high
statistical power and provide evidence independent to
sequence-based molecular phylogenetic studies.

Incomplete lineage sorting is caused by alternative fixation/elimination of ancestral polymorphisms in populations of daughter lineages. Observations of incomplete
lineage sorting can be particularly problematic when
examining taxa that have undergone rapid bursts of speciation [22,34]. It is believed that the tribe Cercopithecini
diverged from tribe Papionini about 11 million years ago
[7,35]. However, owing to the lack of fossil evidence, the
divergence times of subsequent groups are less certain. For
the arboreal Cercopithecus clade, multiple speciation
events may have occurred during a very short period to
create the six species groups, containing the >20 species
we see today [1]. If that is the case, many polymorphic Alu
elements present in the guenon ancestral population have
the potential to remain polymorphic before, during, and
after these speciation events. These insertions were eventually fixed in or lost from the genomes of daughter species, and may have resulted in the incongruent insertion
presence/absence patterns observed.

Methods

Finally, occasional introgressions via hybridization
present yet another hypothesis to explain the incongruent
Alu patterns. The ranges of closely related species within
many guenon species groups often overlap geographically, and many of these species are known to hybridize
with each other. For example, it is known that hybridizations occur between the red-tailed monkey group (cephus
species group) and the blue monkey group (mitis species
group, represented here by C. nictitans) in their contact
zones [36]. These hybridizations may have contributed to
the polytomy of C. ascanius, C. cephus, C. petaurista (the
cephus species group) and C. nictitans (the mitis species
group) in our study. In fact, introgression may even have
introduced certain Alu insertion loci into species other
than the arboreal Cercopithecus clade and provide a plausible explanation for some of the incongruent results in our
study.

Conclusion
Based on 179 Alu insertions, a robust phylogenetic
hypothesis has been constructed and the placement for

Computational data mining
Genomic sequences from Chlorocebus aethiops(African
green monkey) were obtained from the NIH Intramural
Sequencing Center [37], as part of the Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative. The sequences were broken
into 10000-bp fragments and compared with the human
genome (hg18) and the rhesus monkey genome
(rheMac2) using the BLAST-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT)
[38]. Fragments containing insertion/deletions were
extracted and annotated to identify putative lineage-specific Alu insertions using previously reported methods
[39]. In order to allow a focus on the cercopithecine lineage, only Alu elements present in the Chlorocebus aethiops
sequence but absent in the orthologous regions of the rhesus monkey genome were excised along with 1000 bp of
flanking sequence in both directions. Flanking oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of each Alu element were then designed using Primer3 software [40]. The
primers were subsequently screened against the GenBank
NR database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) program [41] to determine if they resided in
unique DNA sequences.
PCR display methodology and PCR genotyping
The Alu element PCR-display methodology and Alu-specific primers described by Xing et al [28] were used for
identifying species-specific Alu insertions. To prevent
ascertainment bias, every cercopithecine species in this
study was subject to this methodology and Alu insertion
loci were identified from all species. Oligonucleotide
primer pairs were initially tested using Chlorocebus aethiops
DNA templates with a temperature gradient PCR (48–
60°C) to determine the most appropriate annealing temperature for further analysis. All loci were screened against
a primate panel that was composed of DNA samples from
12 Old World primate species (Table 1). Because the
quantity of genomic DNA samples for most species is limited, all samples except Chlorocebus aethiops were subjected
to whole genome amplification using the GenomiPhi
genome amplification kit (Amersham, Sunnyvale, CA,

USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The
amplified samples were then purified and divided into
aliquots for locus-specific PCR analysis.
PCR amplification of each locus was performed as
described by Xing et al [28]. The resulting PCR products
were run on 2% agarose gels with 0.25 μg of ethidium
bromide and visualized using ultraviolet fluorescence.
Detailed information for each locus including primer
sequences, annealing temperature, PCR product sizes,
chromosomal locations and amplification results are
available on our website (supplemental table. located
under "Publications") [42].
DNA sequence analysis
For the potentially informative loci, all PCR amplicons
that appeared to have Alu insertions were subjected to
sequence analysis to verify the presence of the Alu elements. Selected taxa from several uninformative loci were
also sequenced to confirm the presence of the Alu elements. Individual PCR products were either directly
sequenced or were cloned and sequenced as described
previously [29]. Sequences for each locus were aligned
against rhesus monkey (when available) or human
orthologous sequence obtained via the BLAT search.
Sequence alignments of these loci are available from our
website (supplemental table. located under "Publications") [42]. The DNA sequences generated for this
project have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers DQ977747-DQ978210).

Phylogenetic analysis
Alu insertion loci were included in phylogenetic analysis
if amplicons were generated in at least seven out of the 11
cercopithecine taxa in our panel, and only 2 distinct
classes of amplicons were obtained (i.e. Alu filled size and
pre-integration or Alu empty size). Any primer pair that
generated multiple paralogous fragments across the panel
was excluded from the analysis.

We implemented an exhaustive search in PAUP* software
(version 4.0b10) [43] using Dollo parsimony and designating the Pygathrix nemaeus as an outgroup taxon. Presence of the insert was coded as "1" and absence of the
insert as "0". If no amplification was observed for a given
locus in any taxon, the character state was coded as
unknown ("?"). For loci containing adjacent independent
insertion events, the independent insertions were treated
as independent markers. In total, 10000 bootstrap replicates were performed on the data. A statistical test for evaluating SINE insertions based on a likelihood model [32]
was also performed to assess the statistical significance of
each branch of the resulting tree.
