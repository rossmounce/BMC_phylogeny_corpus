The genetic organisation of prokaryotic
two-component system signalling pathways
Robert HN Williams, David E Whitworth*

Abstract
Background: Two-component systems (TCSs) are modular and diverse signalling pathways, involving a stimulusresponsive transfer of phosphoryl groups from transmitter to partner receiver domains. TCS gene and domain
organisation are both potentially informative regarding biological function, interaction partnerships and molecular
mechanisms. However, there is currently little understanding of the relationships between domain architecture,
gene organisation and TCS pathway structure.
Results: Here we classify the gene and domain organisation of TCS gene loci from 1405 prokaryotic replicons
(>40,000 TCS proteins). We find that 200 bp is the most appropriate distance cut-off for defining whether two TCS
genes are functionally linked. More than 90% of all TCS gene loci encode just one or two transmitter and/or
receiver domains, however numerous other geometries exist, often with large numbers of encoded TCS domains.
Such information provides insights into the distribution of TCS domains between genes, and within genes. As
expected, the organisation of TCS genes and domains is affected by phylogeny, and plasmid-encoded TCS exhibit
differences in organisation from their chromosomally-encoded counterparts.
Conclusions: We provide here an overview of the genomic and genetic organisation of TCS domains, as a
resource for further research. We also propose novel metrics that build upon TCS gene/domain organisation data
and allow comparisons between genomic complements of TCSs. In particular, ‘percentage orphaned TCS genes’ (or
‘Dissemination’) and ‘percentage of complex loci’ (or ‘Sophistication’) appear to be useful discriminators, and to
reflect mechanistic aspects of TCS organisation not captured by existing metrics.

Background
Two-component systems (TCSs) are abundant and
modular signalling pathways predominantly found in
prokaryotes. The simplest and most common TCSs consist of two proteins, a histidine kinase (HK), and a
response regulator (RR). HKs are typically sensory proteins that contain a conserved transmitter ‘domain’ (T).
Transmitter ‘domains’ are composed of an HATPase
domain wherein resides kinase activity, and a His-containing ‘phosphotransfer’ domain (abbreviated to P
herein, typically a HisKA or Hpt domain). It should be
noted that as they are a combination of two domains,
the functional transmitter unit is not strictly a domain
itself. However ‘transmitter domain’ is a term used commonly in the literature and we adopt that convention
here also, as the transmitter represents a fundamental

functional unit for both mechanistic and bioinformatic
considerations. Upon stimulus perception the transmitter domain autophosphorylates on a conserved histidine
residue within the phosphotransfer sub-domain. The
phosphoryl group is than transferred onto a conserved
aspartate residue in the receiver domain (R) of the partner RR. Phosphorylation of the RR causes a switch in its
behaviour (often mediated by a separate ‘output’
domain) which leads to a cellular response to the initial
stimulus. For an up-to-date series of reviews of TCS
function, see Bourret and Silversmith [1] and associated
articles.
Most prokaryotes possess multiple TCSs, for example
Escherichia coli possesses 62 TCS genes, while Bacillus
subtilis has 70 [2,3]. As all HKs and RRs are homologous, there exists the potential for any HK to signal to
any RR. In reality this does not seem to happen, with
most HK-RR interactions being highly specific [4-7],
however identifying TCS protein partnerships from

genome sequences (and thus delineating signalling pathways) remains a non-trivial task, despite significant computational advances in this area [8-10].
Luckily for researchers, in many cases the genes
encoding a HK-RR pair are found adjacent in the genome, usually within a single operon (and often translationally-coupled). This arrangement allows for the
coordinated expression of the two TCS genes and can
provide robustness to the signalling pathway [11]. When
TCS function requires additional proteins, the cognate
genes are also sometimes found in an operon with the
TCS genes. For example, chemotaxis operons usually
contain several genes that are either required for, or
modulate signalling by the Che TCS, in addition to the
Che TCS genes themselves [11].
Thus contextual information regarding TCS gene
organisation can be very important, providing clues
regarding signalling pathway structure (RR-HK partnerships), and TCS function. However, straightforward analysis is confounded because of the expandable and
modular nature of TCSs. A common example of an
expanded TCS is the phosphorelay, wherein phosphoryl
groups are successively transferred between His-AspHis-Asp amino acid residues. These residues are found
in successive T-R-P-R domains, which are typically
encoded by two or more proteins (eg. T-R-P and R, as
found in TorSR, ArcBA, and EvgSA of E. coli [3], or TR-P-R, as in the sporulation phosphorelay of B. subtilis
[12]). The second phosphorylatable histidine residue of
a phosphorelay can be found in proteins that contain
solely an isolated P domain, and such proteins are
referred to here as phosphotransfer proteins (PP). Examples are also commonplace where ‘accessory’ receiver
domains do not regulate effector activity directly, but
rather modulate signal transduction (see for example
[13-15]). Thus TCS pathway structure is often more elaborate than the basic two-component paradigm, and in
such cases pathway structure cannot usually be inferred
from TCS gene structure.
A further complication regards the genetic organisation
of a TCS. While many TCSs are encoded as a pair of
genes, often the two genes have apparently fused, encoding a ‘hybrid kinase’ which contains both R and T
domains [16]. More complex domain architectures
within TCS proteins are also common and indeed some
TCS loci can be exceedingly complex. For instance, in
the genome of Myxococcus xanthus, there are four TCS
gene loci that each encode contiguous proteins containing at least two T/P domains and at least two R domains
[17,18]. In such cases correlating genetic/domain organisation with signalling pathway structure often requires a
tour de force in molecular analysis [14,19,20].
Clearly it does not necessarily make sense to describe
TCSs purely in terms of the numbers of genes involved,

Page 2 of 12

as each gene may contain one or more TCS domains.
Similarly only describing the domain organisation of a
TCS and ignoring its genetic structure impoverishes
understanding of that TCS. Ideally descriptions of TCSs
would encompass both gene and domain organisation,
and this largely happens in the published literature.
However there is still no systematic nomenclature for
describing TCSs [1], let alone a common categorisation
system. This has led to differing classification criteria in
public resources such as MiST [21,22], P2CS [23,24],
and Michael Galperin’s census of prokaryotic RRs
[25,26], and diverse standards of description in annotated genome sequences [26]. This diversity of TCS
descriptors employed, necessarily confounds intergenome and inter-database analyses.
Ideally a categorisation scheme could be devised,
which would encompass genetic and/or domain organisation as appropriate. Such categorisation would also
facilitate the creation of a series of metrics allowing for
meaningful inter-genomic comparisons [27,28]. At the
moment the most commonly used metric for TCS genes
is the straightforward quantity, the ‘number of TCS
genes per organism’, but more advanced metrics such as
IQ and extro/introvertedness have been proposed
[29,30], based respectively on the number of signal
transduction genes, and the proportion of sensory proteins containing transmembrane helices (a large component of both metrics being TCS genes). TCS genome
metrics might valuably capture information regarding
location and organisation, but would ideally do so at
both gene and domain levels. New metrics could also
provide mechanistic insights, as TCS gene/domain organisation appears intimately linked to mechanism
(reviewed by Whitworth and Cock, [31]).
In this work we investigate the genetic and domain
organisation of the TCS genes from completely
sequenced genomes, and use the resulting information
to develop a categorisation scheme for TCS genes. We
also propose and evaluate a set of possibilities for new
genome metrics, which capture diverse aspects of TCS
organisation.

Methods
Genomic organisation of TCS genes

Data including the identity, features and replicon position of all the TCS genes from complete prokaryotic
genomes (44,008 genes) were obtained from the original
release of P2CS [23,24]. The location of each TCS gene
was given as start and stop nucleotide positions, and the
strand (+ or -) on which the gene was encoded. This
allowed the trivial calculation of the distance between
consecutive TCS genes (upstream and downstream, in
nucleotides), and whether any two consecutive TCS
genes were encoded on the same strand (cis) or not

(trans). For the analyses presented here, TCS genes classified by P2CS as ‘incomplete HKs’ were treated alongside other HKs, while ‘mispredicted TCS proteins’ [24]
were excluded from analysis. TCS genes were thus
either HKs (including hybrid kinases), RRs, or PPs in
this work (Additional File 1).
Domain Architecture of TCS proteins

The domain architecture of each TCS protein was also
obtained from the P2CS database. A list of phosphotransfer signalling domains was manually compiled and
used to define phosphotransfer signalling domains
within each TCS protein - other domains were ignored.
TCS domains were divided into three sets: HATPase
(h), receiver (R) and phosphotransfer (P). A transmitter
domain (T) was defined as an HATPase domain, with
an adjacent phosphotransfer domain (Ph). Isolated h
domains were excluded from further analysis, including
134 genes which contained just a single h domain. All
analyses were performed using custom Biopython scripts
[32] and the resulting dataset was manually curated
(Additional File 2).

Results
The relative location of TCS genes

Initially, the positions of each TCS gene within all genomes were considered, and the relative locations of each
TCS gene were defined (see Materials and Methods).
Within each replicon, the distances between consecutive

TCS genes were determined and whether each pair of
consecutive TCS genes was encoded in cis (on the same
strand), or in trans (on opposite strands and thus either
convergent or divergent).
TCS inter-gene distances were ranked in order of
increasing distance, and plotted against inter-gene distance (Figure 1). The resulting curve for cis-intervals
showed two pseudo-linear regimes. Large numbers of
distances were ~0 bp (~6000, 20.3%), while for distances
larger than ~200 bp, distances increased linearly with
rank. The plot for trans-intervals only exhibited the linear regime of increasing rank with increasing distance.
This regime started at a similar distance (~200 bp) to
that of the cis-intervals, and with a similar gradient
(Figure 1). Across all gene separations, the number of
cis-intervals (29,556) was nearly double that of transintervals (13,086), with the cis:trans ratio increasing
further at smaller distances (>15:1 when considering distances <200 bp). This is easily explained, as many TCS
genes are found encoded in tandem gene pairs [16,33].
Additionally, around a quarter of cis-intervals (22.6%)
were less than 0 bp, suggesting those gene pairs were
overlapping - another well-documented phenomenon in
TCS genes [34,28], and in prokaryotic genomes more
generally [35-37].
Juxtapositioning of TCS genes - defining a cut-off

For both cis-intervals and trans-intervals, at larger distances there appears to be a linear relationship between
rank and distance (Figure 1), implying that in this

Distance (bp)

regime, which also starts at ~200 bp.

Williams and Whitworth BMC Genomics 2010, 11:720
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/720

regime there is an even (random) relationship between
the relative position of TCS genes. However at smaller
distances, the number of TCS genes increased exponentially with decreasing distance, implying non-random
juxtapositioning of TCS genes. The end of the pseudolinear regime lies at distances of ~200 bp for both types
of intervals, implying that if two TCS genes are less
than 200 bp apart, then they function together, whereas
if further than 200 bp apart, then their juxtaposition will
normally have occurred by chance. 200 bp therefore
seems an appropriate cut-off value to define whether
TCS genes are co-located for functional reasons, or
purely by chance. Extrapolation of the linear ‘random’
regime implies that imposing a 200 bp cut-off would
result in a false positive rate of <2.5% for an average
genome - i.e. two TCS genes that are found by chance
within 200 bp of each other but are not signalling partners, would be misinterpreted as paired in under 2.5%
of cases.
An orphan is defined as a TCS gene that is not adjacent to another TCS gene. By undertaking a count of
orphan TCS genes as a function of cut-off distance, it
was found that the number of apparent orphans decayed
linearly with distance if a cut-off of >200 bp was used,
however exponentially increasing numbers of orphans
were identified as the cut-off distance was decreased
below 200 bp.(data not shown). Extrapolation from large
cut-off behaviour, implies that using a 200 bp cut-off
might reduce the apparent size of clusters, but only in
<2.5% of cases.
TCS gene clusters and foci

TCS genes from 1406 replicons (44,008 genes) were
grouped into gene clusters, with a cluster defined as a
set of contiguous TCS genes, none of which are separated by >200 bp. Cluster size (number of genes) was
recorded, with orphans having a cluster size of 1. The
number and order of all TCS genes found in each cluster was also captured. Across all replicons tested, there
were 16,596 orphans, 24,380 paired TCS genes, 2,268
genes in clusters of size three (triads), and 764 genes in
clusters of size four (tetrads) - see Additional File 1.
Functionally inter-dependent TCS proteins are found
to be encoded in trans very rarely, and the juxtapositioning of TCS genes in trans is far less frequent than
juxtapositioning in cis (Figure 1). The effect of ignoring
the adjacency of TCS genes in trans was investigated by
defining a TCS gene ‘focus’ as a series of TCS genes,
none of which are separated by >200 bp, and all of
which are encoded on the same strand (all cis). As can
be seen in Table 1, the numbers of genes encoded in
pairs changed little when considering foci rather than
clusters (1.4% reduction), although with a slight increase
in the number of orphans (6.0%), and a decrease in the

number of triads and tetrads (Table 1), as would be
expected. The overall ratio of genes encoded as orphans,
pairs, triads or tetrads varied little whether considering
clusters or foci (Table 1). All following analyses were
therefore undertaken on TCS gene foci rather than gene
clusters.
TCS gene organisation

The domain composition of each TCS gene focus was
then elucidated as described in Materials and Methods.
After removal of genes encoding HATPase domains
without phosphotransfer domains and manual curation
of genes apparently mis-classified by P2CS, a dataset
was obtained containing 43,426 genes, distributed over
29,962 gene foci (Additional File 2). Genes were classified as HKs (including hybrid kinases), RRs and PPs.
HK and RR genes are ‘evenly’ distributed

Across all genomes interrogated, orphan TCS genes
(17,378) were almost as likely to be HKs as RRs (45.2%
and 51.0% respectively when considering foci), see Table
2, with the remainder being PPs (3.8%). Of TCS gene
pair foci (11850), the vast majority (91.8%) contained a
single HK and a single RR. 94.0% of triads (553 of 588)
contained both HK and RR genes, with a slight preponderance (55.5%) towards those containing two RR and
one HK gene. As TCS genes in our analysis were classified as either HKs, RRs or PPs, 81 different tetrad geometries/organisations were possible (34). However two
of the possible geometries accounted for 58.9% of all
observed tetrads. Those two geometries each contained

two RR and two HK genes, in an alternating order (i.e.
HK,RR,HK,RR and RR,HK,RR,HK). When all tetrads
comprising two HK and two RR genes were considered,
irrespective of order, they accounted for 71.2% of all tetrads, with no other single tetrad geometry accounting
for more than 6.2% of the total (146). It therefore seems
that in many ways (relative numbers, organisation,
ordering), there is a ‘constancy’ regarding HK and RR
gene distribution - i.e. for every RR there is a HK (and
vice-versa) - thus at the genetic level the basic unit of a
TCS is apparently a HK-RR gene pair. This of course
correlates with the mode of action of the typical TCS the direct transfer of phosphoryl groups between paired
HK and RR proteins.
Phosphotransfer protein genes

Consistent with this observation, across all genomes,
RRs and HKs exhibit a remarkably similar distribution
of gene organisations (39.4 ± 1.1% found as orphans,
55.2 ± 1.1% in pairs, and 5.4 ± 0.0% in triads and tetrads). However, the distribution was found to be very
different for PPs, with nearly two-thirds (65.6%) found
as orphans, and only 30.2% in gene pairs (Table 2).
Thus PPs appear to exhibit less ‘constancy’ than HKs or
RRs, being more likely to be found as orphans, and with
a reduced frequency of being found in a partnership.
When they were found in a pair, the partner gene was a
RR in the majority of cases (85.0%). It could be argued
that at the genetic level, if there is a functional unit
involving PP genes, it is a RR-PP unit. This proposition
also seems obvious, as PP genes are predominantly
found within HK-RR-PP-RR phosphorelays, which are
typical HK-RR TCSs expanded by the inclusion of an
RR-PP unit.
The presence of PP genes was also restricted to a
small set of possible triad and tetrad geometries. 37 PP
genes were found in triads, and of those, 30 (81.1%)
were found alongside one RR and one HK gene. Of the
five PP genes found in tetrads, only one was found in a
HK > RR > RR > PP > focus (5’ to 3’) reminiscent of a
phosphorelay, while the remaining four were found in
foci with the geometry HK > RR > PP > HK >, suggesting the encoding of a signalling pathway structure more
complex than that of a standard phosphorelay.
Plasmid-encoded TCS genes

As plasmids are relatively mobile/dispensible genetic elements, the properties of plasmid-encoded TCS genes
(797 genes) were compared to those of the whole genomic dataset (see Additional File 1). Most plasmids
(75.4%) encoded no TCS genes, however on average
there were 1.38 TCS genes per plasmid across all genomes. Twenty plasmids encoded at least 10 TCS genes
each, and 18 of those came from Alphaproteobacterial
or Betaproteobacterial hosts - groups composed largely
of symbiotes and parasites of metazoans.

Page 5 of 12

The chi-squared test was employed to compare the
observed numbers of plasmid-encoded orphans, pairs,
triads and tetrads, with those expected from whole dataset distributions. It was found that the distribution of
plasmid encoded TCS genes was significantly different
from that of the whole genomic dataset (p < 0.0001).
Specifically, there were more orphans than expected
(367 rather than 319), and fewer paired genes (366
rather than the 435 expected), with little difference for
triads and tetrads (48 and 16 respectively observed, 32
and 19 expected). However despite these differences, the
composition of the ‘orphan’ and ‘paired gene’ classes of
plasmids were virtually identical to those of the whole
genomic dataset (HKs and RRs were 46.9% and 50.7% of
the plasmid orphans respectively, while paired RR and
HK genes made up 90.7% of the plasmid paired gene
foci). Therefore despite the relative mobility of plasmids,
they tend to contain fewer paired gene systems, instead
encoding a greater proportion of TCS genes as orphans.
Phylogenetic aspects of TCS gene organisation

127 replicons encoded more than 100 TCS genes each
(Additional File 1). Of those replicons, tetrads accounted
for at most 9.0% of the TCS complement (Rhodopseudomonas palustris, BisA53), while nearly half (58) of the
replicons had no tetrads. Tetrads were particularly
enriched in the Alpha-, Beta-, and Delta- proteobacteria
(16 of the top 20 replicons were from those clades).
Triads were found to comprise up to 15.2% of one replicon (Geobacter lovleyi SZ), and again triads were particularly common in the chromosomes of the Alpha-,
Beta-, and Delta- proteobacteria (14 of the top 20). Only
15 of the 127 replicons had no triads, 11 of which were
from Firmicutes. Conversely, paired genes were most
common in the Firmicutes (13 of the top 20), with the
percentage of TCS genes found in pairs ranging from
82.3% (Clostridium phytofermentans ISDg) to 11..5%
(Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A). A similar
range was found in the percentage of TCS genes found
as orphans, which varied reciprocally with the percentage of paired genes. The percentage of orphan TCS
genes ranged from 85.6% (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A) to 14.5% (Clostridium phytofermentans
ISDg). As expected, it seems there is a significant phylogenetic dimension to the organisation of TCS genes.
TCS domain organisation

As noted above, the distribution and numbers of RR and
HK genes in replicons are very similar. However across
all prokaryotic genomes, there are around four receiver
domains for every three transmitter domains [28]. The
reason for this apparent discrepancy is that a large proportion of HK genes (22.8%) encode proteins with a
receiver domain(s) in addition to transmitter domains such proteins are usually described as hybrid kinases.

Therefore to truly understand/explain the organisation
of TCS genes, it is necessary to take into account the
various combinations of domains found within TCS
genes.
Phosphotransfer signalling domains within each TCS
gene were identified and classified as either transmitter
(T), receiver (R), or phosphotransfer domains (P), see
Materials and Methods for details. This allowed each
TCS gene and focus to be defined as a string of ‘R’, ‘T’,
‘P’ and ‘-’s, where ‘-’ denotes a junction between genes.
Inspection of the resulting manually-curated dataset
(Additional file 2) confirmed that receiver domains are
significantly more numerous than transmitter domains,
both of which outnumber phosphotransfer domain by
around an order of magnitude (27,839 R, 20,408 T and
2,197 P domains).
Domain organisations within TCS proteins

Initially the nature of domain architectures and their frequency within the TCS gene population was investigated
(Tables 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). On average, TCS genes each possess 1.16 TCS domains (Table 5). The majority (86.2%) of
TCS genes encoded single TCS domains, with receiver
domain-only proteins (21,614) more frequent than transmitter domain-only proteins (15,691) and with a relatively
small number of phosphotransfer proteins (1,012). A small
proportion (1.4%) of RRs possessed multiple receiver
domains (Table 6), generally two (301 examples), but
three in 14 cases. Non-hybrid HKs rarely possessed multiple transmitter domains (two of 15704 proteins), however
the proportion of proteins with two transmitter domains
was significantly enriched in hybrid kinases (51 of 4650).
No proteins were found to contain more than two transmitter domains. Hybrid kinases were also enriched for
multiple receiver domains (Table 6), with 1113 of 4650
hybrid kinases possessing 2 or more receiver domains. Of
HKs possessing a single transmitter domain, the majority
encoded no receiver domains (77.3%), however virtually all
HKs with two transmitters possessed receiver domains
(96.2%), presumably to somehow modulate/integrate signalling between the two transmitters.
88.7% of two-domain proteins contained paired receiver and transmitter domains, with a further 7.7%

comprising two receiver domains. Two organisations
were also particularly common in proteins comprising
three TCS domains - 679 proteins (59.8%) had one of
each domain type (TPR), while 392 proteins (34.5%)
possessed two receiver and single transmitter domains.
Three combinations of domains (independent of order)
accounted for 93% of proteins possessing four domains
- 196 proteins were TRRP (57.1%), 86 were TRRR
(25.1%), while 36 were TRPP (10.5%). Proteins possessing more than four TCS domains tended to comprise
multiple Hpt domains upstream of a TR unit (10 of the
20 5-domain proteins were PPPTR, both 6-domain proteins were PPPPTR and both 8-domain proteins were
PPPPPPTR). The only protein encoding 9 TCS domains,
was RRTRRPRTR, being Mmc1_3271 from Magnetococcus sp. MC-1, a magnetotactic Proteobacterium [38].
Proteins containing a phosphotransfer domain either
possessed no other TCS domains (1014 proteins), or
tended to also possess both transmitter and receiver
domains (877 proteins), presumably forming parts of
phosphorelays (Tables 3 and 7). Of the 1046 P-containing proteins which also had receiver and/or transmitter
domains, 1000 (95.6%) had domain complements (independent of order) of either TRRP (196), TRP (679), or
PR (125), which are likely members of typical phosphorelays [39]. Intriguingly, TRP proteins were predominantly orphans, only 30.5% (207) were encoded adjacent
to a single response regulator, which would be required
for the focus to encode an intact phosphorelay. Conversely, 42.3% of TRRP proteins (83) were encoded next to
single RR genes, suggesting that a large proportion of
TRRP proteins may not encode an intact phosphorelay
by themselves.

(13880, 46.3%) encoded a single TCS domain (Table 8),
and of those the majority comprised a single receiver
domain (8,556, 61.6%). Such proteins were nearly twice
as numerous as genes encoding a single transmitter
domain (4,660, 33.6%), with single phosphotransfer
genes being relatively rare (664, 4.8%). A similar number
of foci encoded two TCS domains (13,420). The majority of two-domain foci (10,834, 80.7%) consisted of two
genes, 93.6% of which comprised a classic HK-RR pair.
Of the 2,586 orphan gene, two-domain foci, 2,304
(89.1%) were hybrid kinases, thus constituting an entire
TCS. Considering foci encoding more than two TCS
domains, observed numbers decreased rapidly, as the
number of encoded domains increased (Table 9).

(potentially encoded by an adjacent gene) completing a
phosphorelay. Conversely phosphotransfer domains
within 3-domain foci might be less common because to
retain functionality, they would have to interact with proteins encoded by more distant genes.
For single domain foci, the proportion containing a
transmitter domain is 33.6%, however the percentage of
single domain genes with a transmitter domain is 41.0%.
Presumably this is because non-hybrid HKs will have a
partner RR, and there is a selective pressure towards the
co-location of the two genes. Conversely, the percentage
of proteins encoding a receiver domain is 61.6%, while
the percentage of single domain genes that contain a
receiver domain is only 56.4%. This may suggest there is
a pressure towards the ‘orphanisation’ of some receiverdomain only genes, potentially because they have multiple signalling partners.

Genes or foci, domains or genes?

Plasmid-encoded TCS foci

Is it more sensible to consider TCS organisation at a
focus level, or at a gene level? We could start with the
assumption that the most important factor is the number
of TCS domains at a focus, with the distribution of those
domains between genes being less important. If so, we
would expect that for any number of encoded domains,
the proportion of genes containing T, R or P domains,
would be similar to the proportion of foci containing
those domains (Tables 3 and 4). This is generally the
case, to within 5%, however in some cases there is a great
difference between foci and genes, especially considering
1-domain foci, and foci containing phosphotransfer
domains. For instance, phosphotransfer domains are
found in 34.4% of 3-domain foci, but in 62.2% of 3domain genes. Phosphotransfer domains are similarly
enriched in 4-domain and 5+-domain genes. Presumably,
in a three-domain protein, a phosphotransfer domain
would normally be required to signal to another protein

As described earlier, more than half of all plasmidencoded TCS were found on just 20 plasmids, each of
which encoded more than 10 TCS genes. Across all genomes R, T and P domains are found at frequencies of
55.2%, 40.5% and 4.4% respectively, however in plasmids
the relative frequencies of domains is significantly different (p < 0.001), with 55.2% R, 36.5% T and 8.4% P
domains. Thus for plasmid TCS, it seems that phosphotransfer domains are over-represented, at the expense of
transmitter domains. Assessing the number of domains
encoded at a focus, there were also significant differences between plasmid foci and those of the entire
genomic dataset (p < 0.0001), with 60.0% of foci encoding a single domain (45.4% for the whole dataset), with
a corresponding reduction in the number of paired-gene
foci (89 observed, 132 expected).

Phosphorelays

In a typical phosphorelay, phosphoryl groups are successively transferred between T, R1, P and R2 domains. In
an early review of phosphorelay biology, Appleby et al.,
[39] noted that the constituent domains of some phosphorelays exhibited different patterns of covalent linkages. For instance, some phosphorelays were
distributed over four proteins, while others were composed of three or even two proteins.
In our dataset there were 759 foci that consisted of
four domains, dominated by four domain-combinations
(307 TRPR, 262 TRTR, 136 TRRR and 38 PPTR). Of
the 307 proteins containing TRRP domains, 85 were
encoded as one gene, 210 were distributed over two
genes, 11 were three-gene systems and only one focus
consisted of four genes. Of the 210 two-gene systems,
209 were found as a TRP-R focus, while 9 of the 11 3gene foci had a TR-P-R geometry. Thus for TRPR systems, there is a distinct bias towards two of the possible
8 geometries (T-R-P-R and TRP-R), together accounting
for 95.8% of cases. Conversely for the 262 TRTR foci,
every possible geometry was seen at least 12 times, with
no single geometry accounting for more than 27.1% of
cases (71 instances, T-R-T-R). There were also 241 foci
encoding five domains in the dataset, and nearly half of
these of those (105) have a TRRRP domain combination,
reminiscent of a phosphorelay with an extra receiver
domain. 81 (77.1%) of these were arranged in a two
gene organisation TRRP-R similar to the TRP-R geometry found in 68.1% of TRRP foci.
Metrics of TCS signalling

As can be seen above, the TCS complement of genomes
can be characterised in many ways, and at several levels.
An understanding of the relationships between TCS
foci, genes and domains can help us to infer the functional properties of TCSs from their gene sequence and
context alone. It also enables us to define features of
‘normal’ TCS signalling, and in doing so identify organisms/systems in which TCS signalling is abnormal and
thus interesting/novel. Metrics have already been proposed that allow comparisons between organisms, based
on the abundance and character of signalling genes in a
genome [29,30]. These metrics correlate the number of
signalling genes (including TCS) in a genome with IQ,
and the proportion of sensory proteins lacking transmembrane helices with ‘introvertedness’. Another metric
based on the relative abundance of different families of
signalling proteins (again including TCS), has been
shown to be consistent within phyla, and yet capable of
discrimination between closely-related organisms with
differing signalling capacities [29].
In the following section we describe the rationale
behind a series of potential metrics and evaluate their

Page 8 of 12

ability to discriminate between the TCSs of various
organisms.
Measures of TCS genes/domain numbers

Clearly the ‘number of TCS genes/domains’ is an important measure of prokaryotic adaptability. The number of
TCS regulators is taken into account when calculating
bacterial IQ [29] and in some organisms this will be a
major component of the IQ score. Thus the number of
TCS regulators, whether assessed in genes or domains,
will scale with IQ (although the correlation between IQ
and the number of TCS genes/domains will depend
upon phylogeny).
The ‘percentage of TCS genes on plasmids’ varies quite
widely between organisms, from 0.0% to 56.3% (Sinorhizobium medicae WSM419 and Sinorhizobium meliloti
1021 possess more than 60 plasmid-encoded TCS genes
each). However 87.4% of organisms with TCS genes
have none encoded on plasmids, and those with large
numbers of plasmid-encoded TCS genes are predominantly Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria.(see above). No
organisms outside the Alpha- or Beta-proteobacteria
contained more than 25% plasmid-encoded TCS, further
limiting its use as a potential metric.
The domain/gene organisation of organisms could
potentially form the basis of metrics. The ‘percentage of
orphan TCS genes’ and the ‘percentage of paired TCS genes’
both range from 0 to 100%, and both still range over at
least 67.8% even when only considering replicons with
>100 TCS genes. Of those genomes, Xanthomonas oryzae
pv. oryzae PX099A, exhibited the greatest proportion of
orphaned TCS genes (85.6%, more than 10% greater than
the second highest scoring organism, Anabaena variabilis
ATCC 29413), while only 14.5% of the TCS genes of Clostridium phytofirmans ISDg were orphaned.
The presence of PP genes (and phosphotransfer
domains) is indicative of an expanded TCS, so counts of
the ‘number of PP genes’ was considered as the basis of
a metric. However very few genomes possess multiple
PP genes - only 24 replicons encoded more than 4 PP
genes (Flavobacterium johnsoniae UW101 possessed the
most, with 14), and 52.5% of chromosomes possess no
PP genes, substantively limiting it’s use as a metric.
Even focussing on phosphotransfer domains rather than
PPs does not improve such a measure’s usefulness significantly, as there are only three times more phosphotransfer domains than PP proteins across all genomes.
For similar reasons, ‘average genes/domains per focus’
is of limited use as a discriminatory metric, as only 8.9%
of foci have more than two domains, and only 2.4% of
foci have more than two genes. Indeed as 82.5% of all
TCS foci are either one-gene, one-domain foci, or twogene, two-domain foci, measures of ‘domains per focus’
correlate with the ‘% of paired TCS genes’ and ‘% of
orphan TCS genes’ measures. For example, ‘average

Williams and Whitworth BMC Genomics 2010, 11:720
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/720

number of genes per focus’ is negatively correlated with
‘% of orphan TCS genes’ with R2 = 0.87.
Measures of complexity

Potential metrics described thus far have centred around
various measures of the number of domains/genes per
focus. It is also possible to devise metrics based upon
degrees of complexity within TCS foci. For example one
might assess the number of different TCS gene organisations within a replicon, or the proportion of foci with
>n genes. We compared four such metrics: the number
of different focus organisations or ‘diversity’, the number
of different focus organisations comprised of >2 genes
(’diversity >2’), the number of foci containing >2 genes
(’# >2’), and the percentage of foci containing 2 or more
genes (’% >2’). ‘# >2’, ‘diversity >2’, and ‘diversity’ all
correlated with the ‘number of TCS genes’, with R 2
values of > 0.74. This might have been expected as the
larger the number of TCS genes within a genome, the
greater the number of more complex focus organisations. However ‘% >2’ was found to correlate only
slightly with ‘number of TCS genes’ (R2 = 0.0607 across
all replicons, and R 2 = 0.0922 for replicons with ≥50
TCS genes). Thus it would seem that the ‘% >2’ metric
captures some feature of TCS organisation distinct from
the ‘number of TCS genes’, or the ‘number of genes/
domains per focus’. Applying the ‘% >2’ measure to
replicons encoding 50 or more TCS foci, scores ranged
from 22.8% (Burkholderia phymatum STM815 chromosome 1) to 0%. A significant proportion of replicons
(32.7% of replicons containing ≥50, but only 6.5% of
replicons containing 100 or more TCS genes) possess
no foci of >2 genes, which restricts the metric’s applicability to replicons with large numbers of TCS genes.

Discussion
Assessing the relationship between TCS gene adjacency
and nucleotide distance, led to the proposal that 200 bp
be used as a cut-off for the definition of functionally colocated TCS genes on the same DNA strand. The imposition of such a cut-off gives similar results to manual
analysis of TCS gene structure. For example using a
manual approach [33]Bacillus subtilis has been
described as having 10 orphan TCS genes, and 60 paired
genes, whereas using the automated scheme here, B subtilis apparently encodes 58 paired genes and 12 orphans.
200 bp is a commonly used cut-off for defining likely
operons [40,41], and restricting focus membership to
genes within an operon is a desirable outcome. A cutoff of 200 bp is pessimistic - it will often cause the
separation of genes that would intuitively be assumed to
be co-functioning, reducing the apparent size of TCS
gene foci. However, a pessimistic cut-off reduces the
problem of mis-classifying genes as being co-functional
purely because of the relative proximity of their genes,

Page 9 of 12

which is more of a problem for replicons with higher
densities of TCS genes. Basing classification on a distance cut-off makes the scheme presented here sensitive
to mis-classification of start sites, which is still an
unsolved problem in genomics, however it does avoid
the problem of gene underestimation during annotation.
Other categorisation schemes have used ad hoc sets of
rules for assessing adjacency of TCS genes [22,33]. For
example, the MiST2 database assesses linkage by
restricting analysis to unidirectional gene clusters
(wherein no genes are >200 bp apart) within which
linked TCS genes could be separated from each other
by up to two other genes [22], while Whitworth and
Cock [33] used an arbitrary 5,000 bp cut-off. Both or
these approaches are thus far more optimistic classification schemes than the approach used here and don’t
have the benefit of being based on gene-distance data.
Despite this, our results are similar to those of other
studies. Applying the categorisation scheme to 43,427
TCS genes from the P2CS database (version 1), revealed
that the vast majority of TCS genes are encoded as
either orphans (40.0%) or paired genes (54.6%), while
the MiST database classifies 38% of TCS genes as
orphans [22]. In a recent upgrade to the P2CS database,
the classification scheme defined here has been adopted,
providing free access to gene organisation information
for all TCS in completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes and metagenomes [42].
In addition to noting gross trends of TCS organisation, categorisation of TCS genes allowed analysis of
previously unexplored aspects of TCS gene organisation
from a multi-genomic perspective.
Analysis of the distribution of TCS genes between
chromosomes and plasmids showed that plasmids are
relatively enriched for orphan TCS genes, and that
phosphotransfer domains are over-represented in plasmids at the expense of transmitter domains. The relative
abundance of phosphotransfer domains implies that
plasmid-encoded TCS tend towards the more complex
‘expanded’ types. Plasmid TCS genes also tend to be
orphaned, which suggests that plasmids either tend to
encode more TCS pathways with components distributed around the plasmid, or encode more TCS proteins
that act in combination with, or by modulating the
activity of, chromosomally-encoded TCS. Intriguingly, a
recent study of Rhodococcus equi has suggested that a
plasmid-borne orphan RR required for virulence (Orf8),
is activated by a chromosomally-encoded HK (MprB),
providing evidence that this latter scenario is plausible
[43]. In either case, it is not clear why plasmid-encoded
TCS should be at all different from chromosomallylocated TCS.
Classically, phosphorelays have been described as
TCSs involving phosphotransfer between four successive

Williams and Whitworth BMC Genomics 2010, 11:720
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/720

domains (T > R 1 > P > R 2 ), as described by Appleby
et al., [39]. Such phosphorelays are readily identified in
our datasets. Most 4-domain TCS foci encoding T, R, R
and P domains were found as either a TRPR single gene
(85, 27.7%), or as a TRP-R two-gene focus (209, 67.4%).
Other relatively uncommon domain architectures are
also viable functional units however - for instance a
TR-P-R system (YsrRST) has been recently described in
Yersinia enterocolitica, [44]. A single domain/gene organisation is found for 77.1% (81) of the 105 5-domain
foci containing TRRRP domains (TRRP,R), suggesting
that these foci encode phosphorelays whose activity is
somehow modulated by an extra receiver domain, a suggestion made previously [45]. An example of an experimentally characterised system showing such complexity
is the CbbRRS phosphorelay of Rhodopseudomonas
palustris, which comprises a TR hybrid kinase (CbbSR),
a PR protein (CbbRR1) and a further RR (CbbRR2) [46].
Also abundant in our datasets were loci encoding two
transmitter domains and multiple receiver domains. The
genetic organisation of these loci (often with alternating
receiver and transmitter domains) suggests they might
encode phosphorelays where the function of the Hpt
phosphotransfer domain of classical phosphorelays is
performed by the phophotransfer domain within the
second transmitter domains of the system. Alternatively
such loci may just be the consequence of the coincidental juxta-positioning of two dyad TCSs. However, one
such system that has recently been experimentally characterised is the redCDEF system of M. xanthus [14].
The Red pathway is encoded by a T1-R1R2-T2-R3 focus
and the T 2 domain has been shown to receive phosphoryl groups from the R 1 domain (the T 2 domain
appears incapable of autophosphorylation). In addition,
for the TRT-R phosphorelay TodST of Pseudomonas
putida, the second transmitter domains has been shown
to act as a phosphotransfer domain, while possessing
autokinase activity [47]. It therefore seems likely that
TRTR phosphorelays are nearly as commonplace as
TRPR phosphorelays, although currently less-well
studied experimentally.
As noted by Appleby et al. [39], TCSs display different
covalent linkages between their TCS domains. Cock and
Whitworth [16] investigated the gene/domain relationship for ‘minimal’ TCS foci - those encoding a single
transmitter and receiver domain pair. It was found that
whether the two signalling domains were found as one
or two proteins was dependant on whether the TCS
possessed a transmembrane sensory domain, or a DNAbinding output domain, each of which require particular
sub-cellular localisation for function [16]. Presumably
arguments of co-localisation will affect the distribution
of domains between genes, and the distribution of genes
between foci, for all TCS geometries. The complexity of

Page 10 of 12

addressing such a topic computationally for pathways
more complex than a minimal TCS is daunting though,
and must be left for the future. However exploring the
relationship between domain and gene organisation has
the potential to unveil mechanistic features of TCS signalling/evolution, as it has done for minimal TCS [16].
Hopefully the analysis and datasets presented here open
up this possibility.
Our analysis interrogated the collection of completely
sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Features of TCS gene/
domain organisation are not conserved globally, with
different phyla exhibiting distinct properties, for example Firmicutes tend to encode TCS as pairs and not
orphans, whereas Proteobacteria tended to encode most
of the TCS gene triads and tetrads. The dataset used to
draw our conclusions is biased towards highly
sequenced clades. The impact of such sequencing bias
can be reduced by removing redundancy at an arbitrary
taxonomic level (see for example [26]), but ideally the
analysis presented here would be performed individually
for separate taxa, as depth of sequencing allows. Unfortunately for most taxa there are currently not sufficient
complete genome sequences available to undertake such
analysis at even the order level, nor sufficient data on
lifestyle to allow correlations with life history traits [28].
Nevertheless, assessing the properties of TCS genes
across all genomes is useful, as it provides a context for
the analysis of individual organisms, groups of organisms, and subsets of TCS proteins, for instance CheA
homologues (HKs with a Hpt rather than HisKA phosphoacceptor domain), or an individual family of RRs.
Finally we investigated possible metrics of TCS gene
organisation. Useful metrics are able to distinguish
between a wide variety of organisms, and provide a
measure of an organismal feature that isn’t captured by
other metrics. Some metrics capture phenotypic properties, for example extrovertedness and IQ/adaptability
which reflect lifestyle and ecology [29], while others
reflect mechanistic features of a system/organism, such
as the relative numbers of one-component and
two-component systems [48], providing insights into
evolutionary pressures and molecular mechanisms. In
addition to providing such insights, metrics also allow
rigorous rather than intuitive comparison between
organisms.
Here we propose two metrics that capture information
regarding the genetic organisation of TCSs - the ‘percentage of orphan TCS genes’, and the ‘percentage of TCS
genes in foci of >2 genes’. For ease of reference we have
assigned these metrics the anthropomorphic names ‘Dissemination’ and ‘Sophistication’ respectively. The orders
of organisms ranked by the two metrics are not significantly correlated, nor do they correlate with ranking by
the number of TCS genes (a correlate of IQ). Care

Williams and Whitworth BMC Genomics 2010, 11:720
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/720

needs to be taken when describing the degree of Dissemination and Sophistication of organisms that encode
few TCS genes, as the scores are percentages, and as the
number of TCS genes per replicon drops, the proportion of replicons with no Sophisticated foci increases.
Dissemination is strongly and negatively correlated with
the percentage of paired TCS genes (R 2 = 0.92), and
would also be expected to scale with the related measures of percentage paired/orphan transmitter/receiver
domains.
The distribution of Discrimination scores has a mean
of 44.1% (± 28,1%) when considering all replicons that
encode TCS genes (42.3 ± 13.4% for replicons of ≥100
TCS genes), whereas Sophistication scores average 3.6 ±
7.4% (7.4 ± 4.8% when considering replicons with ≥100
TCS genes).
There appears to be little phylogenetic bias towards
high Dissemination scores - restricting analysis to
organisms with >100 TCS genes, the twenty organisms
with the highest Dissemination scores were 2 Spirochaetes, 11 Proteobacteria, 4 Cyanobacteria, 1 member
of the Euryarchaeota, 1 Planctomycete and 1 member of
the Chloroflexi. The twenty replicons with highest
Sophistication scores included 1 Spirochaete, 1 member
of the Fibrobacteres, 1 member of the Euryarchaeota
and diverse members of the Proteobacteria. Thus Dissemination seems to capture more mechanistic rather
than phylogenetic information, whereas heritage has
more influence on the Sophistication score.
The metrics proposed here don’t consider sequence
similarity or orthology. relationships, and are particularly
sensitive to gene gain/loss (Dissemination) and
gene fusion/fission events (Sophistication). The nonrequirement for sequence similarity data allows metrics to
be calculated for genomes that are the sole examples
within a clade, however superimposing an orthology analysis onto a metrics-based characterisation should provide
information regarding the lability of orthologous systems,
and how their gene/domain organisation has evolved.
Sophistication and Dissemination are direct measures
of gene organisation, and are only indirectly affected by
domain architecture. Metrics based on domain composition tended to be ‘elitist’, as the vast majority of TCS
genes (~90%) contain only 1 domain, and are therefore
of limited usefulness as discriminators. Metrics that
avoid this problem by capturing (for example) the number of foci with >X domains/genes, correlate strongly
with the total number of TCS genes, so are essentially
modified versions of the IQ metric and of little novelty.
How then can the Dissemination and Sophistication
scores be used? Beyond identifying replicons with unusually high or low scores, the next step is to identify factors that correlate with these two metrics. For instance in
an earlier study it was found that the apparent fusion/

Page 11 of 12

fission rates of TCS genes correlated with the presence of
TM helices and DNA-binding domains, and with gene
order [16]. Similarly, analysis of the factors that co-vary
with Dissemination and/or Sophistication should provide
insights into the relationship between gene/focus structure and function (physiological and/or mechanistic).

Conclusions
In this study we have used a rationally-devised scheme
to classify gene and domain architectures of prokaryotic
TCS genes and in doing so, identified general features
of TCS organisation. Our analyses provide a baseline for
comparison with individual organisms, and to such an
end, we have also proposed two new metrics of TCS
organisation that should prove useful in teasing apart
features of TCS organisation and evolution.
