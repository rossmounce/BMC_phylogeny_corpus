1 and 3 encoding two capsid proteins of
Antheraea mylitta cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus

Abstract
Background: Antheraea mylitta cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (AmCPV), a cypovirus of Reoviridae family, infects
Indian non-mulberry silkworm, Antheraea mylitta, and contains 11 segmented double stranded RNA (S1-S11) in its
genome. Some of its genome segments (S2 and S6-S11) have been previously characterized but genome
segments encoding viral capsid have not been characterized.
Results: In this study genome segments 1 (S1) and 3 (S3) of AmCPV were converted to cDNA, cloned and
sequenced. S1 consisted of 3852 nucleotides, with one long ORF of 3735 nucleotides and could encode a protein
of 1245 amino acids with molecular mass of ~141 kDa. Similarly, S3 consisted of 3784 nucleotides having a long
ORF of 3630 nucleotides and could encode a protein of 1210 amino acids with molecular mass of ~137 kDa.
BLAST analysis showed 20-22% homology of S1 and S3 sequence with spike and capsid proteins, respectively, of
other closely related cypoviruses like Bombyx mori CPV (BmCPV), Lymantria dispar CPV (LdCPV), and Dendrolimus
punctatus CPV (DpCPV). The ORFs of S1 and S3 were expressed as 141 kDa and 137 kDa insoluble His-tagged
fusion proteins, respectively, in Escherichia coli M15 cells via pQE-30 vector, purified through Ni-NTA
chromatography and polyclonal antibodies were raised. Immunoblot analysis of purified polyhedra, virion particles
and virus infected mid-gut cells with the raised anti-p137 and anti-p141 antibodies showed specific
immunoreactive bands and suggest that S1 and S3 may code for viral structural proteins. Expression of S1 and S3
ORFs in insect cells via baculovirus recombinants showed to produce viral like particles (VLPs) by transmission
electron microscopy. Immunogold staining showed that S3 encoded proteins self assembled to form viral outer
capsid and VLPs maintained their stability at different pH in presence of S1 encoded protein.
Conclusion: Our results of cloning, sequencing and functional analysis of AmCPV S1 and S3 indicate that S3
encoded viral structural proteins can self assemble to form viral outer capsid and S1 encoded protein remains
associated with it as inner capsid to maintain the stability. Further studies will help to understand the molecular
mechanism of capsid formation during cypovirus replication.

Background
Cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus or CPV of the genus
Cypovirus of Reoviridae family [1,2] infects the midgut
of the wide range of insects belonging to the order
Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera [3,4]. Like
other members of Reoviridae, CPV genome is also
composed of 10 double stranded RNA segments
(dsRNA) (S1-S10) [2]. A small eleventh segment (S11)
has been reported in some cases such as Bombyx mori

CPV (BmCPV) [5] and Trychoplusia ni CPV (TnCPV)
[6]. Each dsRNA segment is composed of a plus
mRNA strand and it’s complementary minus strand in
an end to end base pair configuration except for a protruding 5′ cap on the plus strand. On the basis of electrophoretic migration patterns of the dsRNA segments
in agarose or acrylamide gels, CPVs have been classified into 16 different types [1,7]. CPVs are self competent for transcription, possessing all the enzymes
necessary for mRNA synthesis and processing [8].
BmCPV, the type Cypovirus, has a single layer capsid
made up of 120 copies of the major capsid protein,

VP1, which is decorated with 12 turrets on its icosahedral vertices [9,10]. These hollow turrets are involved
in post-transcriptional processing of viral mRNA and
provide a channel through which newly synthesized 5′
capped viral RNA are released from the capsid into the
cytoplasm of infected cells [10,11]. After translation of
this mRNA into capsid, polymerase and other proteins,
they assembled into viral procapsid within which one
copy of each genome segments plus polarity RNA are
packaged and replicated to form dsRNA. CPV capsids
thus formed can be released as non-occluded virus
particles to directly infect fresh neighboring cells or
occluded in a viral protein matrix called polyhedrin to
form polyhedra [12]. It has been reported that VP1
protein, encoded by genome segment 1 of BmCPV,
can self assemble to form single shelled virus like particles (VLPs) [13,14] and their stability is maintained
by interaction with VP3 and VP4 proteins encoded by
genome segments 3 and 4, respectively [15,16]. Recent
cryo-electron microscopic study has shown the region
of capsid protein directly interacting with viral RNA
indicating the role of capsid in RNA packaging, replication and transcription [17]. Therefore, understanding
the assembly of capsid not only provides insight into
in the virus life cycle but also helps to develop
mechanism for the disruption of virus assembly for
therapeutic application [18]. But besides BmCPV, capsids of other CPVs have not been studied well
although all the genome segments of DpCPV, LdCPV
and TnCPV have been cloned and sequenced [6,19-21].
Antheraea mylitta cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus
(AmCPV) is one of the most widespread pathogens of
Indian non-mulberry silkworm, A. mylitta. CPV-infected
A. myllita larvae develop chronic diarrhea that eventually leads to a condition known as “Grasserie” and
ultimate death [22]. Almost 20-30% larval mortality
occurs annually due to this virus attack [22]. We have
previously characterized the structure of AmCPV by
electron microscopy and its genome by electrophoresis
which reveals that it is similar to that of a type- 4 CPV
and consists of 11 ds RNA molecules [23]. We have also
reported that the genome segments 6, 7, 8 of AmCPV
encode viral structural proteins [24-26], segment 2
encodes viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase [27],
segment 9 encodes a nonstructural protein, NSP38, having RNA binding property [28], segment 10 codes for
polyhedrin [29] and segment 11 does not code for any
protein [26]. But the genome segments encoding viral
capsid proteins have not been characterized. Here, we
report molecular cloning, sequencing and expression of
S1 and S3 of AmCPV in E. Coli via bacterial expression
vector as well as in insect cells using a baculovirus system and show by functional analysis that S3 encoded
protein can self assemble into capsid and S1 encoded

protein remains associated with the capsid to maintain
its stability.

Results and discussion
Genetic analysis of AmCPV S1 and S3

AmCPV S1 and S3 RNA were isolated, converted to
cDNA and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO and the total
nucleotide sequences were determined in both forward
and reverse directions. S1 consisted of 3852 nucleotides
with one long ORF of 3735 nucleotides and could
encode a protein of 1245 amino acids with molecular
mass of ~141 kDa (p141). Thirty four nucleotides
upstream of translation initiation codon (ATG) and 80
nucleotides downstream of translation stop codon
(TGA) were present at untranslated sequences (Genbank accession No: HM230690). Similarly, S3 consisted
of 3784 nucleotides having a long ORF of 3630 nucleotides and could encode a protein of 1210 amino acids
with molecular mass of ~137 kDa (p137). Twenty seven
nucleotides upstream of translation initiation codon
(ATG) and 124 nucleotides downstream of translation
stop codon (TGA) were present as untranslated
sequences (Genbank accession No: HM230691). Cloning
of S1 and S3 was confirmed by northern analysis of
total AmCPV RNA using cloned S1 and S3 cDNA as
probes (data not shown).
BLASTP results showed 22%, 23% and 27% homology
of AmCPVS1 encoded p141 with segment 3 encoded
proteins VP3, VP2 and a hypothetical protein of
BmCPV1, DpCPV1 and LdCPV14, respectively
[13,20,21]. Function of VP3 protein of BmCPV1 is not
exactly known but probably codes for spike protein [13].
Therefore it is suggested that AmCPV S1 may also code
for a minor capsid protein which is probably involved in
spike formation. AmCPV S1 contained seventeen Nlinked glycosylation sites, two cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, twenty casein
kinase II phosphorylation sites, twelve N-myristoylation
sites, fourteen protein kinase C phosphorylation sites
and two tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites. Secondary structure prediction with PHD and GOR4 showed
that 36.54% of the residues are likely to form a-helices,
25.69% would form extended sheets and 37.77% would
form random coils. But their functional significance
remains to be determined.
BLASTP results also showed 20-23% homology of
AmCPV S3 encoded p137 with segment 1 encoded
major capsid protein, VP1, of BmCPV, DpCPV and
LdCPV indicating that AmCPVS3 may code for major
capsid protein of AmCPV. AmCPV S3 contained eight
N-linked glycosylation sites, one cAMP- and cGMPdependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, 14 protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, 19 casein kinase II
phosphorylation sites, 13 N-myristoylation sites and

one prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site. Secondary structure prediction with PHD
and GOR4 showed that 28% of the residues are likely
to form a-helices, 14.9% would form extended sheets
and 57.1% would form random coils. But the correlation between this structure and function remains to be
made. In both the genes the 5′ terminal sequence
AGTAAT and 3’ terminal sequence AGAGC were
found to be the same as the 5′ and 3’ terminal
sequences found in AmCPV genome segments 2, 6, 7,

8 and 10 indicating that the genome structure of this
CPV may follow the same pattern as found in other
CPVs [6,19-21,30].
Phylogenetic analysis of AmCPV S1 and S3 amino acid
sequences with other viruses in the Reoviridae showed its
close relatedness with some members of the cypovirus
such as BmCPV-1, DpCPV and LdCPV (Fig. 1A &1B)
and indicates that all these cypoviruses may have been
originated from a common ancestral insect virus.

Analysis of recombinant AmCPV S1 and S3 encoded
proteins expressed in E. coli and insect cells

AmCPV S1 and S3 were expressed in E. coli M15 cells
as insoluble 141 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 & 4) and 137 kDa
(Fig. 2B, lanes 2 & 3) proteins, respectively. Polyclonal
antibodies were raised in a rabbit against purified p141
and p137, and titered as 10-4 by ELISA.
Sf9 cells infected with S1 and S3 recombinant baculovirus expressed these proteins in soluble form as 141
and 137 kDa, respectively [Fig 3A and 4A (lane 1)].
This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3B
and 4B, lane 1). Expression of predicted same size proteins both in bacteria and insect cells indicate that
although a number of glycosylation sites are present in
both these genes but they are not used for post translational modification. In E. coli M15 cells the expressed
proteins might not fold properly into correct conformation and thus the incorrectly folded protein may
have aggregated to produce insoluble inclusion bodies
but in insect (Sf9) cells via baculovirus expression system due to proper folding soluble proteins are
produced.
To determine function of AmCPV S1 and S3 encoded
proteins, immunoblot analysis was done with the midgut
of uninfected and virus-infected larvae, polyhedra and
virion particles using purified polyclonal anti-p141 and
anti-p137 antibodies. Major immunoreactive bands of
141 kDa and 137 kDa (Fig. 3 &4, lanes 3, 4 and 5) were
observed in infected midgut, purified polyhedra as well
as virus particles, but not in uninfected midgut (lane 2)
indicating that they might code for two viral structural
proteins.

Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM) analysis of virus
like particles

To visualize the formation of virus like particles (VLPs)
in recombinant baculovirus infected Sf9 cells and to
confirm the identity of their protein content, VLPs were
purified from infected cells and immunogold staining of
the particles were performed using rabbit anti-p141 or
anti-p137 antibodies. As shown by TEM analysis (Fig. 5.
A-2, B-2, C-2), native AmCPV, recombinant VLP from
Sf 9 cells infected with AmCPV S3 baculovirus recombinants alone or, Sf9 cells co-infected with AmCPV S1
and S3 baculovirus recombinants were specifically

labeled with rabbit anti-p137 antibody conjugated gold
particles. No gold particle labeling was observed when
anti-p141 antibody was used (data not shown). Also no
VLP formation was observed in cells infected with
AmCPVS1 recombinant baculovirus alone. These results
indicate that AmCPV S3 encoded protein alone has the
ability to self assemble for the formation of single
shelled particle (capsid) without the assistance of any
other structural protein of AmCPV. Similar capsid formation has been reported for BmCPV S1 encoded VP1
protein [14]. No gold particle labeling in VLPs produced
from Sf9 cells co-infected with AmCPV S1 and S3
recombinants using anti-p141 antibody may be due to
presence of S1 encoded protein in the inner side of capsid where antibody can not access or absence of epitope
(exposed outside) specific antibody in the raised polyclonal antibody.
Immunoblot analysis of VLPs

To further confirm the protein content of these VLPs
obtained from recombinant baculovirus infected Sf9
cells, immunoblot analysis was performed using antip137 and anti-p141 antibodies. Immunoblot study using
anti-p137 antibody (Fig. 6B) showed a single major
immunoreactive band at 137 kDa in purified VLPs from
cells infected with AmCPV S3 baculovirus recombinants
(lane 1), purified VLPs from cells co-infected with both
AmCPV S1 and S3 baculovirus recombinants (lane 2),
purified p137 protein (lane 3) and native virion particles
(lane 5). Similar immunoblot study, using anti-p141

antibody showed a single major immunoreactive band at
141 kDa in purified VLPs obtained from cells expressing
both AmCPV S1 and S3 (Fig. 6C, lane 2), purified
recombinant p141 protein (lane 4) and native virion particles (lane 5). Since in SDS-PAGE, after Coomassie blue
staining two bands (137 kDa and 141 kDa) were
observed in purified VLPs from cells co-infected with
both AmCPV S1 and S3 baculovirus recombinants (lane
2), and also in purified native virion particles (lane 5)
and reacted with both anti-p141 and p137 antibodies,
these results indicate that p137 is involved in the formation capsid outer shell and p141 is associated in the
inner side of capsid (VLPs). Three dimensional structure
of BmCPV has shown presence of spike molecules and
transcription enzyme complexes along the icosahedral
five fold axis both inside and outside of the core particles [10,16]. Similar studies are required to understand
the association of AmCPV S1 and S3 encoded proteins
in the viral capsid.
Comparison of stability of native virion and virus like
particles at different pH

Transmission electron microscopic studies of native virions and recombinant VLPs at different pH showed that
VLPs are more stable in alkaline condition rather than
acidic pH (Fig. 7). Most of VLPs maintained their intact
structure at pH-12 whereas totally disintegrated at
below pH-4. At any given pH native virion particles
were found to be more stable than VLPs made up of
p137 or p137 and p141 together (Table 1). But VLPs

composed of both p137 and p141 were found more
stable than VLPs made up of p137 alone. These results
again confirmed that AmCPV S1 encoded 137 kDa protein forms the major outer capsid protein and S3
encoded 141 kDa protein remains associated with it and
plays an important role in maturation of virus particles
by maintaining the stability and integrity of the capsid
protein. Since the stability of native virion is more than
recombinant VLPs it is suggested that similar to
BmCPV [14] in addition to S1 and S3 encoded protein
other virion proteins encoded by other genome segments may also helps in maintaining the stability and
integrity of capsid. Characterization of all the AmCPV

genome segments will help to elucidate the role of other
proteins which may be involved in capsid formation.

Conclusions
AmCPV genome segments 1 and 3 have been cloned
and expressed in insect cells via baculovirus recombinants. Analysis of expressed protein produced in insect
cells by TEM, immunogold and immunoblot analysis
indicates that AmCPV S3 encodes major outer capsid
protein which can self assemble into VLPs whereas
AmCPV S1 codes for an inner minor capsid protein
which may be involved in stabilizing virion structure.
These studies of capsid assembly and formation will

Methods
Silkworm, Virus, Cell lines

The CPV infected Indian non-mulberry silkworms, A.
mylitta, were collected from different tasar farms of
West Bengal and Jharkhand states of India. The Spodoptera frugiperda cell line, Sf9, was procured from Invitrogen, USA and maintained on TNM-FH (Grace Insect
media) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone) and lactalbumin hydrolysate and yeastolate
(Invitrogen) at 27°C.
Purification of polyhedral bodies, isolation of total
genomic RNA and extraction of genome segment S1 and
S3 RNA

Polyhedra were purified from mid guts of infected silkworm larvae by sucrose density gradient centrifugation
according to the method of Hayashi and Bird [31] with
some modification [23]. Genomic RNA was extracted
from the purified polyhedra by the standard guanidinium isothiocyanate method [32] and fractionated in 6%
PAGE. Genome segments 1 and 3 were precisely excised
from gels and were eluted by the crush and soak
method [33].
Molecular cloning and sequencing of genome segment
S1 and S3

S1 and S3 genomic RNA of AmCPV were converted to
cDNA as described by a sequence independent RT
method [34] using two primers (AG1 and AG2). The 3’end of 5′-phosphorylated primer, AG1 (Table 2), was

blocked by NH2 to prevent its concatenation in subsequent dsRNA/DNA ligation reactions. Approximately,
200 ng of purified S1 and S3 RNA segments were taken
and in each case primer AG1 was ligated to both 3’
ends of dsRNA by using T4 RNA ligase for 1 hour at
37°C. The tailed RNA was denatured by heating,
annealed to primer AG2 (Table 2), which is complementary to AG1, and reverse transcribed at 55°C for 50
min by using Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The template RNA from RNA/cDNA hybrid
was removed by digestion with RNaseH and cDNA
strands of both polarities were annealed by incubating
at 65°C for 2 h. The cDNA ends were repaired by incubation with Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline) at 72°C for
20 min and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to make plasmid pCR-XL-TOPO/AmCPVS1 and
pCR-XL-TOPO/AmCPVS3. After transforming in E. coli
TOP 10 cells, plasmids were isolated and characterized
by EcoRI digestion. Recombinant plasmids containing
proper size insert were then sequenced by using Bigdye
terminator in an automated DNA sequencer (ABI,
model 3100) with M13 forward and reverse primers as
well as internal primers designed from deduced
sequences.
Sequence analysis

Genome sequence of AmCPVS1 and S3 were analyzed
by Sequencher program (Gene codes corporation, USA)
and homology search was done using BLAST [35]. Conserved motifs were identified using motif scan program
(http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/egi-bin/motif_scan). The molecular weight of deduced protein, and amino acid compositions were determined using protein calculator
program (http://www.scripps.edu/~edputnam/protealc.

html). Secondary structure was predicted using PHD
and GOR4 programs [36]. To understand the evolutionary relationship between AmCPV and other members of
Reoviridae, the amino acid sequences of AmCPVS1 and
S3 were compared with those of other reoviruses and
cypoviruses, and Phylogenetic trees were generated by
neighbor-joining method with the program MEGA
(http://www.megasoftware.net/index.html) [37]. Tree
drawing was performed with the aid of TREEVIEW program [38].
Expression and purification of AmCPV genome S1 and S3
encoded protein from E. coli

The entire protein coding regions of AmCPVS1 (from
nucleotide 35 to 3769) and S3 (from nucleotide 28 to
3657) cDNA were amplified by PCR from pCR-XLTOPO/AmCPVS1 and pCR-XL-TOPO/AmCPVS3 by
accuzyme DNA polymerase (Bioline) and two sets of
synthetic primers, AGCPV 154F and AGCPV 157R, and
AGCPV145F and AGCPV 146R (Table 2), respectively,
and analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The
amplified PCR products were restriction digested and
cloned into pQE-30 vector. The resulting recombinant
plasmids, pQE-30/AmCPVS1 and pQE-30/AmCPVS3,
were then transformed into E. coli M15 cells and the
colonies were screened following restriction digestion.
For protein expression, the recombinant M15 E. coli
cells were grown in 5 ml LB medium containing 100
μg/ml of ampicillin and 25 μg/ml of kanamycin until
the O.D (at 600 nm) reached to 0.6 at 37°C and induced
with 1 mM IPTG for another 5 hours at the same temperature. Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation,
lysed by boiling with sample loading buffer (60 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% Glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% b-mercaptoethanol and 1 μg/ml bromophenol blue) for 3 min.
and analyzed by SDS-8% PAGE [39]. The molecular
mass of the encoded protein was determined by comparison with standard protein molecular weight markers
using Kodak software 1D, version 3.6.3.
For large scale protein expression recombinant E. coli
M15 containing pQE-30/AmCPVS1 and pQE-30/
AmCPVS3 were grown in 1 L LB medium till OD at
600nm reached to 6.0 and then induced with 1 mM
IPTG for 4 hour. After harvesting bacteria by centrifugation, the insoluble 6× His-tagged AmCPV S1 and S3
encoded fusion proteins were purified from the bacterial
lysate by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen) and eluted from
the Ni-NTA column by buffer containing 250 mM imidazole [24,25]. The amount of the purified protein was
determined by the method of Bradford [40] using BSA
as standard and the purity was checked by SDS-8%
PAGE.

Rabbit immunization and production of polyclonal
antibodies

The Ni-NTA purified S1 and S3 proteins were concentrated using centricon (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After
electro elution of protein bands from SDS-PAGE,
approximately 600 μg of protein was mixed with
Freund’s complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously
at multiple sites in a rabbit [28,41]. Four more booster
doses were given with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant
with the same amount of protein via the same route at
4-week interval. Blood was collected 10 days after the
final booster, serum prepared and the antibody titer was
determined by ELISA [41].
Construction of recombinant baculovirus and expression
of AmCPVS1 and S3 in Sf9 cells

The entire protein coding regions of AmCPVS1 and
AmCPVS3 cDNA were amplified by PCR from pCR-XLTOPO/AmCPV S1 and pCR-XL-TOPO/AmCPVS3 by
accuzyme DNA polymerase (Bioline) using two sets of
synthetic primers, AGCPV 154F and AGCPV 157R, and
AGCPV 145F and AGCPV 146R, respectively, and were
analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR
amplified products were eluted from the gel after
restriction digestion and cloned into pBluebacHis2A
baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen) upstream of
baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. The resulting recombinant baculovirus transfer vectors and BsuI digested
linearized Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrosis
virus or AcMNPV DNA were co-transfected into Sf9
cells using insectin plus according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, log phase grown Sf9 cells
(10 6 ) were seeded in each Petri dish and allowed to
adhere for 1 h before transfection and were washed
twice with serum free medium. These cells were then
co-transfected with 4 μg of pBluebacHis2A/AmCPV S1
or pBluebacHis2A/AmCPV S3 plasmids mixed with 0.5
μg of linearized Bac-N-Blue DNA (Invitrogen) using the
supplied liposome. The transfected cells were incubated
for 72 h at 27°C and culture medium was collected.
After infecting fresh Sf9 cells with this culture supernatant, recombinant baculovirus (blue plaques) were isolated by plaque purification [27]. To produce
recombinant AmCPVS1 or S3 encoded proteins, Sf9
cells were cultured in 1-L spinner flask (2 × 107 cells)
and infected with recombinant baculovirus at an m.o.i
of five. The cells were harvested 72 h post-infection and
washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (137 mM
NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, 2.7 mM HCl, pH 7.3). The
washed cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, [pH-7.5], 1.0 mM EDTA, 10 mM
dithiothreitol [DTT], 2% Triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl,

50% glycerol) containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma), lysed by sonication, centrifuged at 3000 g for
30 min at 4°C to clear the debris and the supernatant
was used to purify proteins by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. In brief, the supernatant was incubated for 1
h on ice with Ni-NTA sepharose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After washing unbound proteins with 10-column volume of lysis buffer, bound
AmCPVS1 or S3 encoded proteins were eluted from the
beads with elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM
NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH-7.5), concentrated by
Centricon (Millipore) and analyzed by SDS-8% PAGE.
Immunoblot analysis of S1 ad S3 encoded proteins

Detection of AmCPVS1 and S3 encoded protein in
infected cells was done by western blot analysis using
polyclonal antibodies raised against bacterially-expressed
p141 or p137 proteins in rabbit. Ni-NTA purified
AmCPVS1 and S3 encoded protein from baculovirus
infected insect cells, the midgut of uninfected and
AmCPV-infected fifth instar larvae, purified polyhedra,
and purified virions were resolved by SDS-8% PAGE.
Following electrophoresis, proteins from the gel were
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Stratagene).
After blocking with 3% BSA, the membranes were
washed with 1× PBS and incubated with 200 times
diluted affinity purified anti-p141 or anti-p137 polyclonal antibodies for 1 h at 20-25°C. After washing with 1×
PBS as above, the membrane was incubated with protein
A-conjugated horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of
1:5000 for 1 h, washed three times with 1× PBS and
color development was done using the HPO color development kit (Bio-Rad).
Isolation of native virus from polyhedral bodies, and virus
like particles from recombinant baculovirus infected Sf 9
cells

Native virus particles were isolated from polyhedral
bodies according to the method Hayashi and Bird [31]
with some modification [23]. In brief, sucrose density
gradient purified polyhedral bodies were lysed by 0.2 M
carbonate buffer (pH 10.2) and neutralized by 0.2N HCl.
After separating the intact polyhedral bodies by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 5 min, the virus particles were
pelleted by centrifugation at 94,500 g for 90 min at 4°C
and finally resuspended in 20 mM PBS, pH-7.3.
Sf 9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses
(expressing either S1 or S3 alone or S1 and S3 together)
were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 10
min after 72 h post infection incubation. After three
washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 , pH7.4),
sonicated and supernatant was collected after

Page 9 of 11

centrifugation at 30,000 g for 5 min. The supernatant
was subjected to a 10-40% sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 94,500 g for 90 min. The band materials
were collected, diluted with PBS and VLPs were pelleted
by centrifugation at 1,50,000 g for 90 min. The pellet
was washed, resuspended in 20 mM PBS, pH-7.3 and
observed by TEM [42].
Immunogold labeling and analysis of virus like particles
by transmission electron microscopy

To confirm the formation of virus like particles by
AmCPV S3 and S1 encoded proteins, immunogold
staining of the particles was performed according to the
method described by Lin [43]. Briefly, after absorption
of virus particles on the carbon coated grids, blocking
was done using 1% BSA in 20 mM PBS. After washing
with 20 mM PBS, affinity purified anti-p137 polyclonal
antibody or anti-p141 polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit was added at a dilution of 1:100, and incubated for
30 min. Then carbon coated grids were washed again
with 20 mM PBS and gold tag anti-rabbit IgG was
added at a dilution of 1:100. The grids were then
washed three times with water and the samples were
stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. A set of controls without gold particle, was also done for the native
virion and recombinant virus like particles (VLPs). After
overnight vacuum drying, samples were examined in a
JEM-2100 HRTEM operating at 200 kV.
Immunoblot analysis of virion like particles

For detecting the presence of AmCPVS1 and S3
encoded proteins in the VLPs produced in insect cells
infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing either
S3 alone, or S1 and S3 together, and in native virions
purified from polyhedra, western blot analysis was done
using anti-p137 and anti-p141 antibodies. In brief, purified virus like particles, Ni-NTA purified protein samples from recombinant baculovirus infected Sf9 cells
and native virions were resolved by SDS-8% PAGE and
the gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Stratagene). Western blot study was performed following the same protocol as described above using 1:200
fold diluted anti-p137 and anti-p141 antibody.
Stability of native virus and recombinant virus like
particles at different pH

To compare the stabilities of VLPs produced in insect
cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing
either S3 alone, or S1 and S3 together, with respect to
native virions, VLPs and density gradient purified native
viral particles were resuspended in 20 mM PBS or 0.2
M NaH2PO4 of different pH ranging from 3 to 12 and
incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After

incubation they were observed in transmission electron
microscopy operating at 50 kV in different microscopic
fields.
