Abstract
Background: Whilst being closely related to the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), S. lividans 66
differs from it in several significant and phenotypically observable ways, including antibiotic production. Previous
comparative gene hybridization studies investigating such differences have used low-density (one probe per gene)
PCR-based spotted arrays. Here we use new experimentally optimised 104,000 × 60-mer probe arrays to
characterize in detail the genomic differences between wild-type S. lividans 66, a derivative industrial strain, TK24,
and S. coelicolor M145.
Results: The high coverage and specificity (detection of three nucleotide differences) of the new microarrays used
has highlighted the macroscopic genomic differences between two S. lividans strains and S. coelicolor. In a series of
case studies we have validated the microarray and have identified subtle changes in genomic structure which
occur in the Asp-activating adenylation domains of CDA non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes which provides
evidence of gene shuffling between these domains. We also identify single nucleotide sequence inter-species
differences which exist in the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster. As the glyoxylate bypass is non-functional in
both S. lividans strains due to the absence of the gene encoding isocitrate lyase it is likely that the ethylmalonylCoA pathway functions as the alternative mechanism for the assimilation of C2 compounds.
Conclusions: This study provides evidence for widespread genetic recombination, rather than it being focussed at
‘hotspots’, suggesting that the previously proposed ‘archipelago model’ of genomic differences between S.
coelicolor and S. lividans is unduly simplistic. The two S. lividans strains investigated differ considerably in genetic
complement, with TK24 lacking 175 more genes than its wild-type parent when compared to S. coelicolor.
Additionally, we confirm the presence of bldB in S. lividans and deduce that S. lividans 66 and TK24, both deficient
in the glyoxylate bypass, possess an alternative metabolic mechanism for the assimilation of C2 compounds. Given
that streptomycetes generally display high genetic instability it is envisaged that these high-density arrays will find
application for rapid assessment of genome content (particularly amplifications/deletions) in mutational studies of
S. coelicolor and related species.

Background
Bacteria of the Gram-positive genus Streptomyces are of
great scientific and economic importance. Streptomycetes are saprophytic, aerobic, soil dwelling bacteria

which undergo complex differentiation to form mycelium, aerial hyphae and spores, and produce a diverse
array of secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics and
bioactive compounds [1]. There are a number of published streptomycete genomes including Streptomyces
griseus [2], Streptomyces avermitilis [3] and Streptomyces
coelicolor [4]. The genomes of the sequenced streptomycetes consist of large (6-12 Mb) linear chromosomes

with high (72-74%) G+C content [4]. The chromosomes
show synteny to each other in the central ‘core’, a region
thought to contain conserved and highly expressed
genes, and also contain two flanking ‘arm’ regions, proposed regions of high horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
with high recombination rates [5,6]. The large sizes of
streptomycete genomes are thought to be related to the
diversity of environmental niches which Streptomyces
encounter.
S. lividans is known to be closely related to S. coelicolor A3(2) and has a virtually identical (99.7%) 16S rDNA
sequence [7,8]. Both species are members of the S. violaceoruber clade in 16S rDNA phylogenetic trees [9-11].
The similarities in basic genomic structure and genetic
organisation of the S. coelicolor and S. lividans chromosomes have long been known [12]. However, it is clear
that many genomic differences are present, e.g. S. lividans 66 possesses a 93 kb “genomic island” in its chromosome, relative to that of S. coelicolor A3(2) [13,14],
and does not contain the same fertility plasmids as S.
coelicolor, A3(2) instead harbouring the plasmids SLP2
[15] and SLP3 [16]. These, and other genetic differences,
are reflected in phenotypic differences. For example,
S. lividans differs from S. coelicolor in that its DNA is
degraded during electrophoresis in buffers containing
traces of ferrous iron. This phenomenon is due to a
DNA phosphorothioate modification conferred by a
cluster of five dnd genes which are only present in the
S.lividans genome in the 93 kb island [13,17-19].
Although, S. lividans exhibits most of the secondary
metabolic capability that S. coelicolor possesses it does
not produce antibiotics to the same extent, for reasons
which are unclear. However, a number of studies have
shown that antibiotic gene clusters can be “awakened”
in S. lividans through the over-expression of regulatory
factors such as AfsS and ActII-ORF4 [20,21].
S. lividans is one of the most commonly used Streptomyces hosts for DNA cloning [22,23] and heterologous
protein production [24,25]. It has several features that
make it a suitable host for efficient recombinant protein
expression, including the absence of a methylationdependent restriction system [26] which recognizes and
degrades methylated DNA isolated from commonly
used Escherichia coli strains [27,28]. Additionally, S. lividans has very low endogenous extracellular proteolytic
activity when compared to other Streptomyces species,
leading to higher product recovery [29]. Moreover, in
comparison with E. coli, S. lividans is a better host for
eukaryotic recombinant protein production because the
recombinant proteins produced in S. lividans tend to
have higher levels of solubility, therefore avoiding the
problem of inclusion body formation.
For streptomycetes for which no genome sequence is
available, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH),

through the use of microarrays, provides a useful tool
for the comparison of genetic content between strains.
While microarrays cannot detect chromosomal rearrangements or single nucleotide polymorphisms, oligonucleotide based microarrays can be hybridized using
stringent conditions which enable the detection of small
numbers of bases changes, and can be a powerful tool
in detecting gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) and gene loss/divergence. A previous comparative study of S. lividans TK21 against S. coelicolor M145
has been conducted by Jayapal and co-workers [30].
However, because spotted PCR product based arrays
were used the findings were limited to identification of
large-scale differences, (PCR product probes being more
tolerant to nucleotide changes compared to oligonucleotide probes) between gene coding regions. In the present
study the genomic differences between the sequenced
S. coelicolor M145 strain, (a prototrophic, plasmid-free
derivative of the wild-type A3(2) strain) and two
S. lividans strains: S. lividans 66 (wild-type), and its
plasmid free derivative strain S. lividans TK24, have
been determined using our novel high-density S. coelicolor microarrays. Our aim was to determine whether
high-resolution CGH could identify small insertions/
deletions (indels). It was anticipated that this study
would serve not only to experimentally validate the
microarray platform, but also shed light on the genotypic differences between the two streptomycete species,
and also between the two strains of S. lividans.

Results and Discussion
Production of high density 104K × 60-mer S. coelicolor
DNA microarray

Due to the high G+C content of S. coelicolor (ca. 72%) it
was necessary to experimentally test specificity of a large
set of probes in order to select a validated subset for
comprehensive coverage of the genome. The resulting
104K microarray comprises almost 104,000 unique 60mers (see Material & Methods) with an average spacing
of 30 nucleotides. The 104K array is designed for CGH,
ChIP-Chip and high resolution transcriptome analysis,
covering all known genes and all intergenic regions;
both strands of the genome are represented for the
latter.
High resolution comparative genomics

The availability of the genome sequence of S. coelicolor
allows the use of post-genomic technologies such as
microarrays to explore the genomic content of other
Streptomyces species. Here we have used the 104K array
to examine the genomic differences between S. coelicolor
M145 and S. lividans 66 and its plasmid free derivative
strain S. lividans TK24 using novel, ink-jet in situ
synthesized (IJISS) high density microarrays. Thus, the

procedure [32] was such that only probes that exhibited
a reduction in signal intensity (and thus represent a
non-binding/absent event) following inclusion of a three
nucleotide mismatch were selected. Therefore, to experimentally verify in a real world experimental situation
whether the apparently missing isolated probes were in
fact genuine absences, or false negatives, and whether
the microarrays were operating according to specification, we selected several regions targeted by these single,
isolated ‘absent’ probes for further analysis.

Analysis of the results obtained using the 104K array
design (see Materials and Methods) indicated the apparent absence/divergence in both S. lividans strains of a
probe-binding sequence corresponding to nucleotides
3560106-3560166 of the S. coelicolor chromosome
(Figure 2), i.e. in the adenylation domain of Module 5
(Asp) of CdaPSI of the calcium dependent antibiotic
(CDA) biosynthetic cluster [33]. Also, significantly,
absence of this probe-binding sequence suggested the

averaged (across dye-swapped biological replicates) normalised log 2 ratios, with M145 genomic DNA as the
common denominator (reference sample), for each
probe can be ordered by the genomic position as it
appears in the annotated S. coelicolor genome sequence.
Consequently, the differences between the two S. lividans strain chromosomes and the S. coelicolor M145
chromosome can be readily observed and compared
(Figure 1A). Furthermore, by importing the data into
GACK (Genome Analysis by Charles Kim), software
built around an algorithm that selects a dynamic cut-off
value based on the shape of the signal ratio distribution
[31], a binary classification of presence/absence could be
applied to generate a list of present/absent probes which
is represented diagrammatically in Figure 1B.
Prima facie, we were confident that regions of difference identified by multiple contiguous probes indeed
represented genuine phenomena and demonstrated the
presence of substantial sequence differences between
S. coelicolor and the S. lividans strains. However, initially
our confidence in the validity of single probe absences
was less. The microarray probe design and validation

However, a close examination of longer sequences of
Modules 4, 5 and 7 indicates that, relative to the S. coelicolor sequences, the three modules of S. lividans are
‘shuffled’ and each S. lividans module contains specific
nucleotides/motifs characteristic of all three S. coelicolor
Asp modules (Additional File 2). This data suggests a
long history of recombination events between these
three Asp modules, although due to the high levels of
similarity between them, identification of cross-over
sites has proved elusive. It is significant that the
sequences encoding the active site residues which determine the specificity of modules 4, 5 & 7 for aspartate
has been conserved [34] even though there has been
recombination within the modules; this is consistent
with the aspartate residues being essential for CDA
activity as they are responsible for the binding of a Ca2+
ion [35,36].

absence of the corresponding sequence present in the
adenylation domain of Module 4 (also an aspartate activating domain) in S. lividans 66, as the sequence in this
region in S. coelicolor is identical to that of Module 5.
In order to verify that this was indeed the case, regions
of the adenylation domains of S. lividans CdaPS Modules 4, 5 & 7 spanning the ‘missing’ probe were amplified by PCR using specific primer pairs whose sequences
are based on the published S. coelicolor M145 genome
sequence (Additional File 1). The sequences of the
cloned PCR products (shown in Figure 2) show that the
sequence of the S. lividans 66 Module 5 and Module 4
differ from the S. coelicolor probe sequence by a three
bp deletion which is flanked by regions containing eleven base mismatches. These results indicate that Modules 4 and 5 of S. lividans 66 contain sequences which
are identical to that of S. lividans 66 and S. coelicolor
Module 7 (another Asp Module) and are different from
S. coelicolor Modules 4 & 5. It is likely that the sequence
differences between the species derive from recombination events between the three Asp modules in S. lividans 66 resulting in the Module 4 & 5 sequences being
replaced by the corresponding sequence from Module 7.

From a preliminary, trial array used in our array testing
and optimization process (see Methods) we identified a
non-binding probe corresponding to positions 55240095524068 of the S. coelicolor chromosome, i.e. a region
located in between genes SCO5082 and SCO5083 of the
actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster, which encode the actII1 transcriptional regulator and actII-2 actinorhodin transporter proteins respectively. Sequence determination of a
PCR product amplified using primers actdelL and actdelR
(Additional File 1) spanning the corresponding region of
the S. lividans 66 chromosome generated the sequence
shown in Additional File 3, which differs from the S. coelicolor probe sequence by seven nucleotides, including three
consecutive nucleotide mismatches. It may be that these
sequence differences, which are located in the divergent
promoter region of SCO5082-3, are at least partly responsible for the differences in actinorhodin production
between S. coelicolor and S. lividans, although it is clear
that other factors are involved in actinorhodin production/regulation [[20,21]; see below].
The above results illustrate the sensitivity of the
experimentally optimised 60-mer probe set in discriminating relatively small differences in nucleotide
sequence.
Establishment of the “region of difference” calling
criterion for gene presence/absence

The above studies demonstrate the high specificity of
our microarray design, indicating that single non-binding probes can represent genuine genomic differences
between strains. In addition to providing detection of
small sequence differences and microdissection of individual gene structure our results provide a macroscopic
overview of genome content in S. lividans.

Log2 signal ratios

In a previous comparative study of S. lividans TK21
against S. coelicolor M145 Jayapal and co-workers [30]
used a 7,579 probe spotted PCR array, where each gene
is targeted by one probe. They used a criterion that
three consecutive probe targeting genes need to be classified as divergent/absent before being assigned as
absent. In analogy to their criterion, our presence/
absence calling criterion is based on a relative loss of
signal from a minimum of three consecutive 60-mer
probes, which define a ‘region of difference’. Figure 3
illustrates how the pattern of probe binding may be
used to characterize ‘regions of difference’. Genes are
classified as ‘absent’ if their annotated translational start
site (as in Streptomyces EMBL Accession No. EMBL:
AL645882.2) is encompassed by a region satisfying the
‘region of difference/absence’ criterion. We believe that
this analysis represents a conservative view of the number of absent/divergent genes, as, for example, it would
assign 3” truncated non-functional genes as present.
This situation is illustrated in Figure 3A: SCO5297 is
not classified as absent/divergent despite it containing a
‘region of difference’ comprising 10 non-binding probes
in both S. lividans strains as its translational start site is
not encompassed within this region. The converse situation also occurs where our calling criterion classifies
genes whose 5’ terminus lies within a “region of difference” as “absent”. For example, we classify SCO6832 (a
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase) as being absent/divergent
in S. lividans TK24. It is clear from the GACK classification of probe absences (see Additional Files 4 and 5)
that SCO6832 is largely intact/present, as of the 18
probes targeting this gene all but three are present/nondivergent, i.e. only the first probe targeting the 5’ terminus and the two probes targeting the 3’ terminus do not
bind. However, significantly, as a run of more than three

Page 5 of 16

consecutive non binding probes, comprising the first
probe within the gene, extends into SCO6832 from
upstream so encompassing the translational start site of
the gene within a ‘region of difference’, the gene is classified as absent/divergent according to the microarray
data. However, the results of our reciprocal BLAST
search (see below) indicated that SCO6832 is present in
S. lividans TK24 and diverges only from the S. coelicolor
gene sequence at the 5’ and 3’ termini in a pattern consistent with that of the microarray probe-binding (see
Additional File 6).
Genes classified as absent/divergent from both S. lividans 66 and TK24, and uniquely from TK24 are given,
respectively, in Additional Files 7, 8 and 9. The criterion
used in this study represents a significant advance in
terms of increase in resolution of interspecies genomic
differences over the previous amplicon-based CGH
study [30]. Furthermore, the present study identifies differences between the intergenic regions of S. coelicolor
and S. lividans which have not been previously
investigated.
From Figure 1 it is apparent that S. lividans 66 shares
the vast majority of its genome with S. coelicolor A3(2).
We have identified 6,138 and 7,885 probe differences
between S. lividans 66 and S. lividans TK24 and S. coelicolor M145, respectively. These include 691 single probe
absences and 179 double probe absences for S. lividans
66 relative to S. coelicolor M145, and 436 single probe
and 114 double probe absences for S. lividans TK24,
relative to S. coelicolor M145, respectively. According to
our calling criterion these probe absences do not contribute towards assigning genes as present/absent. When
our calling criterion was applied to the remaining absent
probes which are present in consecutive runs of three or
more we identify 512 ‘regions of difference’ between

these ‘regions of difference’ across the S. lividans 66 and
TK24 chromosomes is shown schematically in Figure 4
(S. lividans 66, Figure 4A; S. lividans TK24, Figure 4B).
We note that there are ‘regions of difference’ which do
not appear to correlate with absent/divergent protein
coding genes. The absence/divergence of these regions
may however prove to be significant as these regions
may encompass promoter elements and RNA genes,
including, for example at present unidentified/uncharacterized cis- or trans-encoded non-coding RNAs.

the microarray probes, which are designed to be specific
for each gene, give a more accurate indication of presence/absence. In this regard it is worth noting that
many of the genes classed as present/non divergent
according to the reciprocal BLAST results (27 out of

Comparison of the S. lividans TK24 microarray results
with the results of BLAST search

The Broad Institute (USA) are currently in the process
of annotating the sequence of S. lividans TK24 and the
sequence data are available for BLAST search via their
website [37]. As a test of our calling criteria we performed a reciprocal BLAST search (see Methods)
between the S. coelicolor M145 and S. lividans TK24
genes; the results are presented in Figure 5. Both the
microarray and BLAST results find 498 genes to be
absent/divergent in S. lividans TK24 relative to S. coelicolor M145. However, 120 genes are classified as absent/
divergent from the microarray data but are present
according to the BLAST results. One possible explanation for these results may be due to the difference in
discrimination of the techniques employed. For families
of very similar/identical genes the BLAST search may
have identified absent/divergent genes as present

illustrating numbers of absent genes, according to GACK analysis of
the S. lividans TK24 microarray dataset and a reciprocal BLAST
search of the Broad Institute S. lividans TK24 sequence database.

120) are transposase genes which give multiple hits
when ‘BLASTed’ against the S. coelicolor M145 genome;
transposase genes that give smaller numbers of BLAST
hits are comprised within the 498 genes identified as
absent/divergent by both the microarray analysis and
reciprocal BLAST search. An example illustrating the
differences in specificity of the microarray probes and
BLAST search is the case of SCO6833 (an isobutyrylCoA mutase small subunit) which appears from the pattern of microarray probe-binding (see Additional Files 4
&5) to be absent/divergent from S. lividans TK24 but
which the reciprocal BLAST search (see Additional File
6) classifies as present/non divergent.
From the annotated 7,824 protein encoding genes in
the S. coelicolor genome, the BLAST analysis identifies
657 genes as missing and 7,167 as present in S. lividans
TK24. From the array analysis of S. lividans TK24 versus S. coelicolor M145 we identify 619 genes as missing
and 7,205 as present. 120 genes were found to be missing by the array analysis but found to be present by
BLAST, whilst 159 genes were found to be present by
the array analysis but missing by BLAST.
If we classify genes identified as present by the reciprocal BLAST as True Positives (TP) and the number of
genes mis-identified (when compared to the reciprocal
BLAST) by the array classed as False Negatives (FN)
then the sensitivity can be calculated by TP/TP+FN.
Thus the sensitivity of the arrays and calling method is
7047/7047+120: 98%. If we class genes identified as
absent by the reciprocal BLAST as True Negatives (TN)
and the number of genes mis-identified (when compared
to the reciprocal BLAST) by the array classed as False
Positives (FP) then the Specificity can be calculated by
TN/TN+FP. Thus the specificity of the arrays and calling method is 498/498+159: 78%. The overall accuracy
(TN+TP/TN+TP+FN+FP) of the arrays and calling
method for CGH purposes is 96%.
Macroscopic pattern of gene absence/divergence in
S. lividans 66 and TK24 and comparision to S. lividans
TK21 and S. coelicolor M145

Previous studies [30] have categorized regions of difference based on size as either Genomic Islands (GI)
(≥25 kb) or as smaller Genomic Islets (Gi), which although
smaller than 25 kb contain at least three consecutive genes
[30]. The use of this “archipelago” model is understandable given the technical limitations of earlier microarray
technologies and the gene absence/presence calling criterion, which tended to bias the analysis towards identifying
blocks of consecutive absent genes. Analysis of the S. coelicolor M145 genome sequence identified a series of regions
designated as potentially recently laterally acquired [4]
which are broadly consistent with clusters of genes identified by Jayapal and co-workers as absent/divergent.

Page 7 of 16

However, the increased resolution of the genomic differences between the species that the 104K microarray of the
present study affords has allowed us to identify a more
subtle and complicated pattern of differences, so the
‘archipelago’ model approach was not employed in our
study.
It is clear from Figure 4 that the identified ‘regions of
difference’ are not evenly distributed along the S. lividans 66 and TK24 chromosomes. In common with previous studies [4,30] we note that certain regions
containing tRNA genes and integrated copies of the
S. ambofaciens plasmid pSAM2 homologues are hotspots for gene absence/divergence, due to recombinogenic activity. However, our results lead us to propose
that rather than being strictly confined to these isolated
areas, gene deletion/divergence occurs more widely
throughout the S. lividans chromosome than previously
thought. It appears that in both S. lividans strains,
“regions of difference” and single and double absent
probes are distributed throughout the genome, with a
slight tendency to occur in the “core” region (Figures 1
and 4) as previously defined by [4]. Both S. lividans
strains 66 and TK24 possess significant deletions at the
chromosome termini, which is consistent with previous
observations regarding S. lividans TK21 and S. coelicolor
M145, and with other studies reported in the literature
[6,38], reporting that the terminal regions of streptomycete genomes are more prone to deletion, duplication
and recombination events. Evaluation of the % G+C
content of the genes identified as absent/divergent in
the present study indicates that they are unusually A+T
rich, when compared with the entire genome (Figure
6A). Moreover, the codon adaption index (CAI) indicates the absent/divergent genes have a low score and
possess non-optimum codon usage (Figure 6B). Both of
these measures suggest that many of the apparently
absent/divergent genes identified in S. lividans strains
have in fact been recently acquired by S. coelicolor and
our results are consistent with the results of previous
studies in this respect [4,30].
Our results are broadly consistent with the findings
reported by Jayapal et al [30] in that the majority of genes
absent in S. lividans 66 and TK24 are present in the GI’s
and Gi’s of TK21 defined previously. In some cases our
results correlate exactly with previous results, particularly
when considering the smaller genomic islets (Gi’s). For

possesses blocks of absent genes which match Gi-3, Gi-5,
Gi-6 (SCO3980-3998), Gi7 (SCO4060-4066) and Gi-8.
However, there are also significant differences between
our results and those reported previously [30], and in
many cases these correspond to regions where our results
do not provide evidence for the complete absence of large
blocks of genes. Instead, we are able to classify at least one
gene, and in some cases many more, within most of the
GI/Gi’s identified previously [30] as being present, raising
doubt as to the GI/Gi’s boundaries and in some cases the
very existence of a GI/Gi at all. For example, Gi-5 is
reported as an absence of SCO3929-SCO3937 [30]
whereas we find that in both S. lividans TK24 and 66 that
SCO3936 is classed as present. Additionally, Gi-2 was
reported to lack SCO2381-2384 whereas we find that
SCO2381 is present in both TK24 and 66. Moreover, Gi-1
is defined as an absence of SCO0090-0099 [30] whereas in
TK24 we find only SCO0090-0091 and SCO0098 are
absent, and in S. lividans 66 only a single gene SCO0098
is absent. Furthermore, out of the 147 missing genes
(SCO6806-6953) defined as GI-5, we find that TK24 has
131 missing genes, but significantly S. lividans 66 only has
43 missing. Hence, due to the methods employed in this
study we have succeeded in identifying many single genes,
and small blocks of genes, located in between genomic
islands/islets as absent/divergent. For example, we assign
three consecutive secreted protein genes (SCO5013-5015)
and the isolated secreted protein gene SCO5995 as absent
in both S. lividans 66 and TK24. We also assign

Page 8 of 16

SCO3521-3522, encoding an integral membrane protein
and a transcriptional regulator respectively, as absent in
TK24 only.
It is interesting to note that the patterns of gene
absence/divergence relative to S. coelicolor M145 differ
in all three S. lividans strains so far investigated. The
results are summarized in the Venn diagram shown in
Figure 7 and indicate that whilst there appears to be a
core of 370 absent genes common to all three strains
there are also gene differences unique to one particular
strain, or are shared between only two of them. This is
consistent with the fact that although TK21 and TK24
were generated from S. lividans 66 (John Innes Stock
No. 1326) in the same study, they were generated in
parallel [16]. It is likely that although some of the differences between TK21 and the other strains may be due
to differences in the microarray platform employed and
data analysis methodology used, these factors cannot
account for the significant differences identified between
S. lividans 66 and TK24. It appears, prima facie, that
TK21 and TK24 share more similar patterns of gene
loss/divergence than do TK21 and 66, or TK24 and 66.
TK24 and 66 have lost 74 genes relative to S. coelicolor
M145 that were misclassified as present in TK21 from
the previous lower resolution study [30]. Collectively,
TK21 and TK24 lack 230 genes relative to the parent
strain, S. lividans 66 and some of these differences in

M145.

Lewis et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:682
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/682

gene loss might be attributed to the differences in plasmid profiles of the strains. CGH studies do not distinguish between chromosomal genes and those that are
plasmid-located and can only inform as to their presence/absence. This being so it may be that loss of SLP2
from TK21 and TK24 explains some of the 147 absent
genes common to these strains, which are present in
S. lividans 66, and the further loss of SLP3 by TK24 the
additional 28 genes it has lost relative to the other strains.
Furthermore, plasmids may have acquired chromosomal
genes singly or in small blocks during repeated recombination events. It has long been known that SLP2 is able
to mediate chromosomal recombination events [16] and
that the rightmost 15.4 kb of SLP2 is identical to
sequence from the S. lividans chromosome from which it
is thought to have been recently acquired [39,40], probably by recombination occurring between the SLP2 and
chromosomal copies of Tn4811 [41]. It has also been suggested that SLP3 is able to integrate into the S. lividans
chromosome as curing of the plasmid has also resulted in
deletion of chromosomal DNA [42].
Consideration of the absent divergent genes in S. lividans
66 and TK24

The lists of genes which are absent/divergent and are
common to S. lividans 66 and TK24 (444) and are specific to TK24 (175) are listed in Additional Files 7, 8
and 9. Hypothetical genes and pseudogenes account for
approximately 50% of the genetic differences between S.
lividans 66, S. lividans TK24, and S. coelicolor M145. It
is clear from the gene annotations and co-localization
pattern that a number of genes lost are from integrated
plasmids of the pSAM2 family from S. ambofaciens. For
example, genes SCO3250-3260 and SCO5336-5349
represent integrated plasmids similar to pSAM2 from
which the three S. lividans strains have lost genes.
Other classes of genes well represented in the absent/
divergent lists include transposases, and “orphan” membrane proteins, secreted proteins, transcription regulators, unspecified regulator and transporter proteins,
lipoproteins, DNA-binding proteins, and ATP-binding
proteins. Until such time as the precise functions of
these genes are understood we are unable to explain or
predict reasons for phenotypic differences between
S. coelicolor and the S. lividans strains. Therefore, the
main interest of the available datasets lies in the absent/
divergent genes of S. lividans whose functional annotations are sufficiently detailed to be useful in hypothesis/
prediction generation, i.e. mainly the enzymes.
The differences between the genetic complement of
S. lividans TK21 and S. coelicolor M145 have been discussed elsewhere and we do not intend to reiterate the
results of the previous analysis [30] and in view of their
current annotations we are unable to usefully comment on

Page 9 of 16

the significance of the 28 absent/divergent genes specific to
TK24. Of the 55 gene differences found in TK21 but not
found in S. lividans 66 and TK24, only three are enzymes
and only one (SCO0984) possesses useful functional annotation, being a putative 3 hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase.
However, TK21 also differs significantly from the other S.
lividans strains in lacking the C31 phage resistance gene
pglZ (SCO6636), although it and TK24 both lack the C31
phage resistance gene pglY (SCO6635). Both of these genes
are present in S. lividans 66.
The differences in act biosynthesis between S. lividans
and S. coelicolor may be due to absence/divergence of
genes relating to S-adenosylmethionine

Among the more intriguing of the apparently missing
genes in the S. lividans strains are those which are
either involved in the biosynthesis of methionine or are
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases. The indirect involvement of genes possessing
these functions in differentiation and antibiotic production has previously been noted [43]. Elevated concentrations of SAM have been shown to lead to expression of
actII-ORF4 and subsequent overexpression of actinorhodin biosynthesis in S. lividans TK23 [44,45], overexpression of undecylprodiginine in S. coelicolor [46] and
inhibition of sporulation in S. lividans [45]. SAM has
been shown to mediate its effect on sporulation through
induction of bldK expression [47], in addition to other
ABC transporters involved in development [48], and
possibly through modulation of bldA expression [46].
We note that the genes identified as missing in S. lividans 66 and TK24 in the present study include
SCO0985 (metE, encoding methionine synthase) and the
methyltransferase genes SCO0995 (absent in both S. lividans 66 and TK24) and SCO3452 (absent in TK24). It
may be significant that both absent methyltransferase
genes possess sequence similarity to SAM-dependent
methyltransferases. Whilst we do not propose a direct
and precise mechanism by which loss of SCO0985,
SCO0995 and SCO3452 mediate the differences in antibiotic production and differentiation between S. coelicolor and S. lividans the roles we hypothesize for these
genes and their effect on development and secondary
metabolite biosynthesis relate to their effect on SAM
concentration. This hypothesis is consistent with them
playing roles similar to those outlined previously with
regard to mutagenesis of the methionine synthase,
metH, and a SAM dependent methyltransferase,
SCO2525 [43].
Investigation on sequence differences in S.coelicolor and
S. lividans bldB

Although it is instructive to compare the macrosequence differences between the two S. lividans strains,

Lewis et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:682
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/682

and S. coelicolor much of the interest of the present dataset lies in the fine detail afforded by the high density coverage of the genomes, as exemplified above in the case of
the CDA Asp-activating adenylation domains. A further
example of the use of the dataset in microsequence analysis relates to the bldB gene (SCO5723). This gene encodes
a small (98 aa) protein required for morphogenesis, antibiotic production and catabolite control in S. coelicolor
[49]. S. lividans TK21 apparently lacks this gene [30] and
in the present study we find it is classified as absent/divergent in S. lividans 66 and TK24. A bldB homologue has
long been known in S. lividans TK24 [50], its sequence
has been determined (GenBank AF071232) and it is well
known that S. lividans sporulates readily and does not
exhibit the severe bldB deletant mutant phenotype
observed in S. coelicolor mutants [51]. bldB null mutants
have a “bald” phenotype when grown on all carbon
sources and fail to produce aerial hyphae or antibiotics
under any tested conditions [51,52]. In contrast to [30] we
accept that S. lividans does in fact possess bldB and attribute its apparent absence in microarray studies to technical reasons relating to positioning of probe design and the
pattern of sequence similarity between the S. coelicolor
and S. lividans genes across their sequences (see Additional Files 10 &11). It seems that the PCR product used
by Jayapal et al [30] spanning the entire TK21 bldB
sequence was unable to bind to its target. In our microarrays the probes located 5” of bldB and the probe encompassing the 5” terminus (i.e. the start codon) were not
bound in S. lividans 66 or TK24, and of the three remaining probes directly, or partially targeting, bldB on our
microarray three bound successfully to the 3’ terminus of
bldB in S. lividans 66 and two bound successfully to TK24
genomic DNA (as determined by GACK analysis). Thus,
in both S. lividans 66 and TK24 the presence of three consecutive absent probes encompassing the translational
start means that bldB is classed as absent/divergent when
in fact it is present but possesses sequence sufficiently
divergent from the S. coelicolor homologue in the 5”
region to prevent hybridization. When the sequences of
PCR products generated from both S. lividans strains
using primers slbldBUp and slbldBDown (Additional File
1) were determined, both were found to be identical to the
published S. lividans bldB sequence (GenBank: AF071232)
and the TK24 bldB sequence identified by BLAST search
of the Broad Institute database, showing that the bldB
gene is indeed present in both S. lividans strains as well as
in S. coelicolor.
Investigation on metabolic differences between
S. coelicolor and S. lividans and alternative mechanisms in
S. lividans strains

Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) of Genome Scale Metabolic
Reaction Networks (GSMN) has been widely used to

Page 10 of 16

predict metabolic capabilities of microbial strains, metabolic engineering of overproducing strains, prediction of
essential genes and integration of high throughput data
with the literature knowledge on metabolic reactions
[53-55]. Here we have used FBA in combination with
our CGH data to identify system-level differences in global metabolic flux distribution between S. coelicolor and
S. lividans, and have modified the existing S. coelicolor
GSMN accordingly and then tested our predictions
relating to differences in cell physiology and C2 metabolism between the species.
The published GSMN model of Streptomyces coelicolor [54] was the starting point of our studies. The following nine metabolic genes which are included in the
GSMN model were shown to be absent from the S. lividans 66 genome by our CGH: SCO3486, SCO3479,
SCO3473, SCO3494, SCO3474, SCO0982, SCO0983,
SCO0985 & SCO6834. Subsequently, we identified all
reactions, which require products of these genes and
have removed them from the S. coelicolor GSMN model
(Table 1). We checked whether the resulting model is
feasible i.e. whether it reproduces the growth of S. lividans strains on a typical glucose-based minimal medium
and then ran simulations of the maximal flux towards
reactions representing biomass synthesis. This modified
model, referred to here as the S. lividans GSMN, predicted that the metabolic network is capable of biomass
synthesis.
Perhaps the genes most fundamental to core metabolic activities which the present study identifies as
absent in S. lividans are those which encode isocitrate
lyase (SCO0982) and malate synthase (SCO0983), which
are both involved in the glyoxylate bypass mechanism.
This is a key system for the utilisation of compounds,
such as fatty acids or acetate, which enter central

metabolism at the level of acetyl-CoA. This mechanism
involves the condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate
to form citrate, which is isomerized to isocitrate, which can
in turn either be decarboxylated to form a-ketoglutarate in
the TCA cycle or which can be cleaved by isocitrate lyase
(ICL) to yield succinate and glyoxylate. Malate synthase
(MS) is able to condense acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate to generate malate and CoA. Thus ICL and MS, together with
enzymes from the Krebs Cycle, catalyse the net formation
of succinyl-CoA from two molecules of acetyl-CoA. There
is little published evidence for the expression of the glyoxylate bypass enzymes in Streptomyces species and it is well
known that the glyoxylate bypass is not the sole mechanism by which C 2 units may enter Streptomyces central
metabolism [56,57]. Although S. cinnamonensis possesses
ICL and MS genes extracts from cells grown in oil-based
media have been shown not to possess ICL activity [56]
and S. collinus has only been shown to possess ICL activity
when grown in the presence of Tween, but not in acetate
[57]. We note that an isoform of malate synthase
(SCO6243) is present in both S. lividans 66 and TK24 and
that reaction R388 may be catalyzed by this enzyme. However, as both strains lack ICL the strains must necessarily
be deficient in the glyoxylate bypass.
We have used the S. coelicolor and S. lividans models
to make predictions about the growth of both species
on medium comprising palmitate as the sole carbon
source. Simulations of maximal biomass synthesis rate
predicted that S. coelicolor is able, and S. lividans is not
able, to use palmitate as a sole carbon source (maximal
biomass synthesis rate of the S. lividans model was 0).
This contradicted previously published experimental
data indicating that S. lividans TK24 is capable of
growth in media comprising triacylglycerides or oleic
acid as sole carbon source [58,59] in addition to our
own observations which demonstrate that S. lividans 66
and TK24 are capable of growth in minimal media
where the sole carbon sources are Tween 80 or palmitic
acid (data not shown). The apparent non-essentiality of
the glyoxylate bypass enzymes may be explained by the
presence of an alternative metabolic pathway. A number
of possible alternatives for C2 metabolism to the glyoxylate bypass mechanisms have been suggested, although
they have not been fully characterized/confirmed
[56,60]. However, the recently identified ethylmalonylCoA pathway [61,62] is the most likely candidate
mechanism which operates as an alternative to the
glyoxylate shunt in S. lividans; indeed, this pathway has
recently been shown to operate in S. coelicolor (D. A.
Hodgson, personal communication).

Conclusions
The results presented here provide a powerful demonstration of the application of high-density microarrays to

Page 11 of 16

CGH studies. As shown here high-density IJISS arrays
are capable of distinguishing between extremely similar
sequences allowing specific discrimination on the basis
of as few as three nucleotide mismatches.
The results presented here regarding single probe
absences provide evidence for recombination between
the aspartate-specific adenylation domain modules (4, 5
& 7) of the CdaPS genes of the CDA biosynthetic gene
cluster revealing them to be “mosaic” genes, relative to
the corresponding S. coelicolor sequences. We also identify an intergenic sequence divergence from S. coelicolor
in the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster and suggest that this, and/or the differences in the S. lividans
complement of genes involved in SAM biosynthesis, or
SAM-dependent methytransferases, may be involved in
mediating the phenotypic differences in actinorhodin
production between S. coelicolor and S. lividans.
Taking a broader view, the results indicate that the
pattern of genetic differences between S. lividans 66 and
TK24 are different to those of S. coelicolor M145 and
S. lividans TK21. We propose that more widespread
genetic drift and recombination has occurred in S. lividans than the “archipelago model” developed previously,
suggests (which focuses on “hotspots” of genetic
difference).
In a series of case studies we confirm that the pattern
of probe binding to S. lividans genes correlates with
their sequence differences relative to S. coelicolor and
use this to explain the published contradictory results
previously reported for S. lividans bldB.
We have developed a GSMN for S. lividans taking into
account the genetic differences relating to the differences
in central metabolism between S. lividans 66 and S. coelicolor, including the absence of genes encoding the
enzymes of the glyoxylate bypass-isocitrate lyase and
malate synthase. The fact that the GSMN indicated that
both S. lividans strains should not be able to grow on
fatty acids as sole carbon source, so contradicting the literature, suggests an alternative pathway to the glyoxylate
shunt exists in S. lividans and it is likely that the
hypothesized ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway fulfils this role.
It is clear from the case studies presented here regarding bldB and the genes which encode the glyoxylate
bypass enzymes that the microarray data presented here
has enormous potential to explain previously published
observations and inform new hypotheses. We note that
observations published in the previous study [30]
regarding the putative identification of genes involved in
DNA methylation systems of S. lividans have stimulated
and informed further studies into this phenomenon
[26]. We expect that the present, more extensive and
detailed study will do likewise.
Finally, we envisage that these high-density arrays will
find widespread application for rapid assessment of

Lewis et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:682
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/682

genome content in mutational studies of S. coelicolor
and related species. It is well known that streptomycetes
generally display high genetic instability and second-site
mutations can arise frequently in the S. coelicolor genome when conducting targeted mutagenesis studies (our
unpublished observations). The 104K array provides an
efficient tool for comparing a new mutant with its
immediate parent, to allow identification of mutants
that have acquired additional, unwanted, deletions/
duplications (which may be missed by ‘next-generation’
sequencing) and hence exclude them from further study.

Methods
Strains and culture conditions

Strains used were S. lividans 66 SLP2 + SLP3 + corresponding to NRRL Code B-16637 and ICSSB Number
1023 (corresponding to stock number 1326 from the
John Innes Centre collection) [16], S. lividans TK24 (str6, SLP2-, SLP3-) [16] and S. coelicolor A3(2) strain M145
[28]. S. coelicolor and S. lividans cultures for genomic
DNA preparation were grown in YEME plus 34%
sucrose medium supplemented with 0.5% glycine and
grown at 30°C for 72 h until early stationary phase.
DNA was extracted using the Kirby mix procedure [28].

Page 12 of 16

using the Minielute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and
the incorporated Cy3/Cy5-dCTP was quantified with the
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Two different
genomic DNA preparations for both S. coelicolor M145
and S. lividans 66 and one preparation of S. lividans
TK24 were each analysed in a ‘dye-balanced’ experimental design (to remove any dye bias). Labelled gDNA (50
pmol) of each pair of strains was hybridised to the 104K
arrays in a buffer containing 1 M NaCl/50 mM MES,
pH 7/20% formamide/1% Triton X-100 and rotated at
55°C over 60 h. Each glass slide contains 2 × 104K
arrays and thus both Cy3/Cy5 dye orientations for each
genomic DNA sample of each strain pair were hybridized on the same slide. The arrays were then washed
with Wash 1 [6 × standard saline phosphate/EDTA
(0.18 M NaCl/10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4/1 mM EDTA)
(SSPE)/0.005% N-lauryl sarcosine) and Wash 2 (0.06%
SSPE/0.18% polyethylene glycol 200), both for 5 min at
room temperature. Hybridised arrays were scanned
using an Agilent Technologies microarray scanner
(5 μm resolution) and the resultant images analysed
using Agilent Technologies Feature Extraction software
(Version 9.1.3.1) with local background correction.
Microarray data processing

Microarray Design

A S. coelicolor high-density IJISS microarray comprising
almost 104,000 60-mer experimentally assessed probes
was produced and validated for CGH in this study. The
initial rounds of probe design have been described previously [32] where the authors reported the use of a
44,000 60-mer probe array; briefly, a large database of
all possible 60-mer probes based on the S. coelicolor A3
(2) M145 genome (EMBL accession AL645882 version
2) was developed and the best performing probes, validated in terms of hybridisation quality and reduction of
signal with the introduction of mismatches, were
selected to optimise the array sensitivity and specificity.
For the present study 103,695 experimentally validated
probes, were selected to cover both coding and noncoding genomic regions, with an average spacing of 30
nucleotides; the probes were distributed randomly on
the microarray. The S. coelicolor 104K microarrays are
available from Oxford Gene Technology Ltd (UK).
Microarray hybridization and processing

Labelling reactions were performed using the BioPrime
kit (Invitrogen). DNA (0.1-1 μg) was denatured at 94°C
for 3 min in 40 μl including 20 μl 2.5 × random primer
mix and kept on ice. Nucleotide mix, 5 μl (2 mM dATP,
2 mM dGTP, 2 mM dTTP, 0.5 mM dCTP), 3.75 μl Cy3/
Cy5-dCTP (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 μl of Klenow fragment (1.5 units) were added and the reaction was incubated at 37°C overnight. The labelled DNA was purified

All microarray data were imported into R (version 2.5,
R, R Development Core Team) and processed using the
Bioconductor package Limma [63-65] and checked for
spatial effects, of which none were found. By assuming
the null hypothesis that S. lividans strains 66 and TK24
are similar to S. coelicolor M145 the data was transformed to log2 S. lividans/S. coelicolor ratios and normalised using within-array loess normalisation followed
by the between-array scale function; by normalising all
arrays together the data (and thus S. lividans strains)
become directly comparable due to the M145 genome
being present on each array. Probes on each array were
flagged as poor quality if the signals of both channels
were classified as outliers in at least one of the binary
variables (1 for bad, 0 for good) of the Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies, variables: gIsFeatNonUnifOL/rIsFeatNonUnifOL, gIsBGNonUnifOL/
rIsBGNonUnifOL, gIsFeatPopnOL/rIsFeatPopnOL and
gIsBGPopnOL/rIsBGPopnOL). Probes that had at least
two dye balanced values for each S. lividans strain
experiment (i.e. good signals in two of the four arrays
for the 66 vs M145 experiment and both arrays for
TK24 vs M145) were selected for further processing.
Note, where probes had three (non dye-balanced) good
quality signals for the 66 vs M145 experiment one of
the two values for the over-represented dye was selected
randomly. For large intergenic regions the 104K arrays
include complementary probes targeting both DNA
strands to detect the presence of non-coding RNAs, as

Lewis et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:682
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/682

all samples used in this study are DNA, able to hybridise
to both complementary probes, these signals were averaged. In total 97,611 probes targeting unique DNA
regions were used for genomotyping analysis. The
microarray design and data are available from ArrayExpress (Accession numbers, respectively, A-MAXD-28
and E-MAXD-58).
Genomotyping analysis

For each of the 97,611 probes that passed filtering, median log2 ratios (taking the dye swapping into consideration) across biological replicates were calculated,
resulting in one value for S. lividans 66/S. coelicolor
M145 and one value for S. lividans TK24/S. coelicolor
M145. The resultant data was converted into suitable
data inputs (pcl format) for GACK (Charles Kim, Stanford University) and processed using the default settings.
Binary outputs of 0 or 1 were obtained to denote probe
absence, or presence, respectively. “Regions of difference” between S. lividans 66 or TK24 and S. coelicolor
M145 were classified by sets of at least three probes.
Thus, one or more probes with a GACK value of 1 (presence) separate regions of difference. Once all regions of
difference were found absent genes could subsequently
be identified by their annotated translational start
codon; if a gene’s translational start coordinate resides
within an identified region of absence then it too was
deemed as missing/divergent.
Reciprocal BLAST between Streptomyces genomes

S. coelicolor protein-encoding gene nucleotide sequences
were obtained from the EMBL genome file (Accession
No. EMBL:AL645882.2]) in FASTA format. Proteinencoding gene nucleotide sequences for S. lividans
TK24 were obtained from the genes.fasta file downloaded from the BROAD institute [66] on 12/12/2009.
Local BLAST nucleotide databases were created from
the obtained FASTA files and each gene sequence was
blasted against the other database (i.e. S. coelicolor genes
against the S. lividans database and vice versa). A gene
was classed as present if in each of the blast results it
had a sequence match of greater than 60 nt in length
(at least the length of the probes on the array) with
greater than 60% sequence identity and an expected
value less than 0.01. If these criteria were not met then
the gene was classified as absent.
Codon Adaptation Index

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) value, a measure of
synonymous codon usage bias, for each S. coelicolor protein encoding gene was calculated using the CAI tool of
EMBOSS [67] The nucleotide sequences from the

Page 13 of 16

EMBL genome file (accession EMBL: AL645882.2)
in FASTA format and the ‘background’ (genome frequency) codon usage table from the codon usage database [68,69] were used as input to EMBOSS:cai for
calculating bias using default settings.
PCR Analysis

Primer pairs, each specific for a particular region of
S. coelicolor and/or S. lividans DNA sequence (Additional File 1), were obtained from Eurofins-MWGOperon and used in colony PCR. One independently
obtained PCR product for each S. coelicolor MT1110
CdaPS Asp-specific adenylation domain (Modules 4, 5 &
7) and two independently obtained PCR products for
the corresponding sequences of S. lividans 66, were
separated on a 1% agarose/Tris-Acetate-EDTA gel, the
relevant bands excised and the DNA extracted using a
Promega Wizard™ SV Gel & PCR Clean-up system. The
purified DNA was treated with PNK (NEB) and blunt
end-cloned into SmaI cut dephosphorylated pUC18
(Fermentas) using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). The ligation
mix was transformed into competent E. coli JM109 and
insert containing clones were identified by blue/white
selection. Plasmid DNA was prepared from such clones
using Promega Wizard Plus™ minipreps DNA purification system and supplied to Eurofins-MWG-Operon for
BigDye™ (ABI) sequencing using M13 forward (-43) and
reverse (-49) universal primers.
PCR products for S. coelicolor M145 and S. lividans 66
and TK24 bldB were similarly obtained, and treated, to
determine the sequences of the central portions of bldB
in these organisms/strains.
PCR products for a region spanning SCO5082 and
SCO5083 incorporating the intergenic region for S. coelicolor M145 and S. lividans 66 were also similarly
obtained, and treated, to determine their sequences.
All of the S. lividans 66 and TK24 sequences obtained
in the course of this study are identical to those already
publicly available from the S. lividans TK24 genome
sequence [37,66].
Flux Balance Analysis

The genome scale metabolic reaction network of Borodina
et al [54] has been used as an initial model in the investigation of the system-wide metabolic differences of S. coelicolor and S. lividans. The reactions which require
products of the genes, which according to our CGH are
missing in S. lividans were removed from the network.
Subsequently, the model has been refined by incorporation
of additional reactions, which have been experimentally
demonstrated to operate in Streptomyces, but were
omitted from the initial model. The feasibility of growth of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/682

different in silico strains on different media has been simulated by the calculation of the maximal biomass synthesis
rate with Flux Balance Analysis. Details of FBA methodology are described in detail elsewhere [53]. Linear Programming calculations have been done with GLPK library run
from our software, which has been previously used to
model metabolic reaction networks of M. tuberculosis and
S. coelicolor. Models used in this work are available in
SBML format from the ScoFBA website [70]. The ScoFBA
server also allows interactive simulations of these models
via a web-based interface to our software.
