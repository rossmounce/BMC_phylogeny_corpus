Abstract
Phage vB_EcoM_CBA120 (CBA120), isolated against Escherichia coli O157:H7 from a cattle feedlot, is
morphologically very similar to the classic phage ViI of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Until recently, little was
known genetically or physiologically about the ViI-like phages, and none targeting E. coli have been described in
the literature. The genome of CBA120 has been fully sequenced and is highly similar to those of both ViI and the
Shigella phage AG3. The core set of structural and replication-related proteins of CBA120 are homologous to those
from T-even phages, but generally are more closely related to those from T4-like phages of Vibrio, Aeromonas and
cyanobacteria than those of the Enterobacteriaceae. The baseplate and method of adhesion to the host are,
however, very different from those of either T4 or the cyanophages. None of the outer baseplate proteins are
conserved. Instead of T4’s long and short tail fibers, CBA120, like ViI, encodes tail spikes related to those normally
seen on podoviruses. The 158 kb genome, like that of T4, is circularly permuted and terminally redundant, but
unlike T4 CBA120 does not substitute hmdCyt for cytosine in its DNA. However, in contrast to other coliphages,
CBA120 and related coliphages we have isolated cannot incorporate 3H-thymidine (3H-dThd) into their DNA.
Protein sequence comparisons cluster the putative “thymidylate synthase” of CBA120, ViI and AG3 much more
closely with those of Delftia phage W-14, Bacillus subtilis phage SPO1, and Pseudomonas phage YuA, all known to
produce and incorporate hydroxymethyluracil (hmdUra).

Background
In recent years, as concerns about antibiotic resistance
and food safety have escalated, researchers have become
interested in the use of bacteriophages to detect and
combat bacterial contamination of food products [1-6].
Cocktails of obligately lytic phages have been applied to
control such problematic foodborne pathogens as
Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella, Salmonella, Listeria
and Campylobacter, though with mixed success [7-16].
Unfortunately, most of the phages used to date in field
trials have undergone little characterization. A better
understanding of the properties of the individual phages
and of their interactions with the host and each other

during co-infection is important if phage-mediated biocontrol is to be successful.
A number of different phages targeting E. coli have
been isolated and intensely studied but few if any of the
well-characterized ones infect serotype O157:H7. We
have previously described the isolation, characterization,
distribution and inter-relationships between E. coli
O157:H7 and phages isolated from sheep and cattle
yards that efficiently infect this pathogen [12,13,17,18].
The cyclical nature of the E. coli O157:H7 levels seen in
cattle and the inverse correlation between this bacterium and phage levels suggests that endogenous phages
provide a natural control mechanism [12,16,18]. We
have found only three types of phages among the many
isolated against O157:H7 from sheep and from cattle
feedlots: T4-like myoviruses such as CEV1 [13], myoviruses distinct from T4 in morphology and behavior,

present a detailed characterization of vB_EcoM_CBA120, a phage belonging to the second group.

Results
Isolation and Initial Characterization of the CBA Set of
Phages Targeting E. coli O157:H7

The systematic isolation and quantitation of E. coli
O157:H7 and a group of phages targeting this bacterium
from stockyards in the southwest US was described by
Callaway et al., [17] and by Oot et al., [18]. CBA120 is
one of these phages. It is of particular interest since it is
the first phage we have encountered which appears to
be highly specific for E. coli O157:H7, infecting only one
of the 72 ECOR collection strains – ECOR 70 (078:H-)
– in addition to at least 13 out of 17 tested O157:H7
strains. In contrast, the T4-like and T5-like phages we
have isolated from ruminant sources infect most of the
tested O157 isolates, and each of those phages infects at
least eight members of the ECOR collection [12,13].
They each also infect E. coli B and K12, which are not
targeted by CBA120. CBA120 did not plate on any of
107 tested E. coli strains from cows with metritis, while
T4-like CEV1 plated on 9 of them and T5-like CEV2
plated on 7, all but 1 different from each other (unpublished data).
Morphology of Phage CBA120

Phage CBA120 (Figure 1) has an isometric head ~90 nm
in diameter and a contractile tail of ~105 × 17 nm,
which measures ~42 × 23 nm in the contracted state
(arrow D). Tails show transverse striations, a neck, a
tiny collar (arrow A), a baseplate, and terminal spikes
which may unfold into a complex system of fibers
(arrows C, B). Its structure is very similar to that of Salmonella Typhi phage ViI [19,20].
Aerobic and Anaerobic Physiological Studies

CBA120 adsorbs rapidly to E. coli O157:H7 at 37°C.
Aerobic single-step growth experiments, carried out at a
low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Figure 2A), indicate
an eclipse period of ~20 min and a latent period of ~40
min. By 50 min, phage production appears to have largely ceased after generating an average burst of ~440
phage per cell (standard error = 18). All phage have
been released by 80 min after infection. However, when
the infection is carried out at high MOI, the turbidity
(OD 600 nm ) of the culture continues to increase long
after infection, almost tripling before gradual lysis is
initiated at about 90 min, releasing 1000-1300 phage per
cell (Figure 2B). Anaerobically, we observed the same
relatively late gradual lysis beginning by 90 min (Figure
3), with an average of ~100 phage per cell present at 60
min and ~250 phage per cell at 250 min. However, we

acid (bottom). Arrows indicate: A, neck with collar; B, reticular

routinely observed that ~40 min after infection some
phage are abruptly released, as seen by the rapid loss of
the remaining susceptible bacteria, both anaerobically
(Figure 3) and aerobically (data not shown) when there
are sufficient survivors to observe this phenomenon (at
MOIs of 2-5). This difference in lysis time and burst
size between high and low MOI aerobic infections is
reminiscent of the lysis inhibition phenomenon observed
in T4.
Tritium Labeling of Phage DNA

In extensive previous work we found that T5-like phage
CEV2 blocks CBA120 phage production (unpublished
data). To determine whether this blockage involved
degradation of the CBA120 DNA in the co-infected
host, we tried to make a stock of CBA120 labeled with
tritiated thymidine ( 3 H-dThd). Most phages that we
have studied readily incorporate dThd into their DNA,
paralleling phage production, so long as deoxyadenosine
(dAdo) is added to block the cleavage of the thymidine’s

glycosidic bond [21]. In the experiment shown in Figure
4, a culture of exponentially-growing E. coli O157:H7
NCTC 12900 was infected with CBA120 or with T4-like
phage CEV1. Five min post-infection, 2 mL of the
infected culture was transferred to a 10 mL flask containing the 3H-dThd and dAdo. Surprisingly, no label
was incorporated during infection with CBA120,
although a large burst of phage was produced and isotope was incorporated as expected in the controls: an
uninfected culture and one infected with CEV1. Efficient
isotope uptake was also observed for the T5-like CEV2,
while no incorporation was seen with the CBA120-like
phage CBA6 (data not shown). The most likely explanation is that the CBA120 group of phages uses some base
other than dThd, analogous to T4’s substitution of
hydroxymethylcytosine (hmdCyt) for cytosine.
GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF CBA120

The CBA120 genome was found to be 157,304 bp long
and circularly permuted, with a GC content of 44.5%. It
is very similar to the genomes of the classic Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi typing phage ViI [20] and Shigella phage AG3 [22] (Table 1). Whole-genome comparisons, made at both the DNA and the protein level using
Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [23], show a remarkable degree of synteny between the three phages (Figure

5). As determined by reciprocal FASTA comparisons,
147 genes are conserved among all three phages, with
only 17 being unique to the genome of CBA120. No
homologs of virulence factor or lysogeny-associated
genes have been found.
The major difference between the three phages seen in
the ACT depiction of Figure 5 lies, not surprisingly, in
the region of the complex tail spikes and fibers
(CBA120 orfs 210-213, as seen in Figure 6; genes
Vi0I_170c-174c; and AG3 orfs 207, 210 and 212) – the
only region of ViI explored in detail by Pickard et al.,
2010 [20] in their genomic analysis of the seven classic
Vi typing phages which target the Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhi Vi antigen. Though not orthologous,
these four proteins are surprisingly similar in general
structure between CBA120, ViI and AG3, while being
totally different from those of any other group of myoviruses reported to date. Since most of the ViI genome
has not yet been otherwise discussed, we include it with
CBA120 in this detailed genomic analysis.
Core Gene Analysis

Genomic analysis indicates that phages CBA120, ViI and
AG3 carry all but one of the 39 genes which constitute
the T4 superfamily core genome (Figure 6). These core
genes, determined by comparing the genomes of coliphages T4, RB43, and RB49, Aeromonas salmonicida
phage 44RR2.8t, and Prochlorococcus phage P-SSM2, are
by convention given their T4 names, taking advantage
of the extensive studies of T4 in determining their function [24-28]. Twenty one of these core genes encode
proteins involved in capsid and tail formation with most
of the rest related to nucleic acid metabolism and

control of late transcription. The homologies extend
well beyond these core genes; CBA120 shares 69 homologues with Delftia acidovorans phage ФW-14, 59 with
Aeromonas phage Aeh1, 53 with T4, and 50 with cyanophage P-SSM2, but the gene order is very different in
each of these phages.
Transcription and Translation

Phages CBA120, ViI and AG3 all have homologs of
gp55, 33 and 45, which are required for transcription of
the T4 late genes [29], suggesting that the mechanism
for controlling structural-gene transcription is similarly
complex (see Discussion). The T4 late promoter consensus sequence is simply TATAAATA, while in the case
of the T4-like cyanophages, this is NATATAATA [30].
The sequence recognized by the late transcription complex has not yet been identified for the ViI family of
phages. Regulation of early- and middle-mode transcription in CBA120 is much less clear. Based on sequence
similarity to the consensus s 70 promoter, TTGACA
(N15-18) TATAAT, only eight probable promoters were
identified. The genomic layout makes it clear that there
must be many additional promoters functioning early in
infection to direct the transition from host to viral
metabolism. At the translation/RNA level, only orthologs of RNase H have been identified, but this is the
level of regulation least well understood in the T4 family
[27]. CBA120 also encodes tRNAs for Met: (CAU), Asn
(GUU), Ile (GAU) and Ser (GCU), followed by what
appears to be a degenerate tRNA of undetermined specificity. ViI and AG3 have similarly located clusters of a
few tRNAs.

Figure 5 DNA-level ACT alignment of the genomes of phages
ViI (top), CBA120 and AG3. Regions in red represent high DNA
sequence similarity between the genomes.

CBA120 has only two putative homing endonucleases,
encoded by orf 195 (a homolog of T4 segD) and orf
221. The latter is a shortened helix-turn-helix (HN-H)
endonuclease, which overlaps the predicted Met tRNA
and is adjacent to an unusual 2 kb region where no
genes have been identified (Figure 6). Similarly, phages
ViI and AG3 have only 2 or 3 such homing
endonucleases.
DNA Replication and Nucleotide Metabolism

Most nucleotide metabolism genes are homologous to
the corresponding genes in the T-even phages: the Bfamily DNA polymerase and its accessory proteins: a
single-stranded DNA binding protein, sliding clamp and
clamp loader, helicases, primase, exonuclease, and DNA
ligase; the A, B and C subunits of ribonucleotide reductase; dCMP deaminase; and dUTPase/dUDPase.
In addition, we found a putative thymidylate synthase
(TS; orf 073), adjacent to which is an apparent dNMP
kinase (orf 070). In light of the above-noted failure of

CBA120 to incorporate 3 H-dThd into its DNA, the
putative TS of CBA120 was carefully examined. BLAST
analysis against the non-redundant protein databases
shows that this protein is far more similar to the deoxyuridylate hydroxymethyltransferase (dUMP HMase)
seen in phages that have been shown to contain
hmdUra in their DNA rather than dThd (Figure 7). This
includes proteins of Bacillus subtilis phage SPO1 and
Delftia acidovorans phage W-14 [31,32]. In the latter
phage system hmdUra is initially incorporated into viral
DNA and then part is modified into 5-(4-aminobutylaminomethyl)uracil (also called putrescine) [33,34].
Restriction enzyme digest patterns (data not shown)
make it unlikely that CBA120 has a further such
modification.
Membrane Proteins and Potential Lysis Genes

Using TMHMM and Phobius, 12 predicted membranespanning proteins have been identified in CBA120 (indicated in green in Figure 6). Some of these proteins are
highly conserved among T4-like phages, but none of

their specific functions have been identified. No holin or
free lysin-encoding genes have yet been detected in
CBA120, though the clearing of the culture at a specific
time and the apparent presence of a form of lysis inhibition strongly suggest that they exist.
Structural Proteins: Use of ViI Proteomic Analysis

Pickard et al., 2010 [20] carried out a very detailed proteomic analysis for ViI. They identified 41 particle-associated proteins, including the products of 18 previouslyuncharacterized ORFs along with all of the structural
proteins predicted by genomic analysis. All of those particle-associated proteins except for the putative tail
spikes and adjacent fiber have orthologs in CBA120;
these latter four have clear homologs in all three phages,
though with substantial differences between them.
Where the specific functions are unknown for proteins
whose ortholog in ViI were identified as being particleassociated, they have been indicated in turquoise in the
CBA120 genome diagram (Figure 6), while the rest are
shown in dark blue.

many species of Salmonella and wV8 infects E. coli. The rest of the
phages belong to the T4 superfamily, most of them infecting E. coli
and some strains of Shigella. However, KVP40 infects Vibrio

acidovorans, and KP15 infects Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coliphage LZ2
was isolated by Sean Eddy from the Denver zoo and several
segments were sequenced in the Kutter lab, in comparison with
those from a number of other T4-like phages [44].

Baseplate Lysozyme

In addition to the lysozyme responsible for ending the
infection cycle, members of the T4 family generally
encode a second lysozyme, usually related to the first,
embedded in the central portion of key baseplate protein
gp5. This aids penetration of the peptidoglycan layer during the initial infection process. The 537 AA protein
identified in CBA120 as a gp5 homolog lies at genomic
position 46,626-48,239. Its Vi1 ortholog was observed in
Pickard’s proteomic analysis [20]. It does not have the
usual identifiable lysozyme, but a central region was
detected between AA 150 and 282 which contains a putative CHAP domain – a δ-D, L-glutamate-specific amidohydrolase with functions including “peptidoglycan
hydrolase” [35], and belonging to the TIGRO2594 family
of the NLPC_P60 superfamily. Flanking the TIGRO2594
domain are two regions, AA 3-109 and 334-437, that are
also found on either side of the catalytic region in the
bacteriophage T4 gp5. Also, a homolog of the N-terminal
domain of the bacteriophage T4 gp5 region is found
between AA 46 and 109; in T4, this domain has been
identified as interacting with gp27 [25].
Putative Tail Fibers and Spikes

Consistent with their disparate host ranges, the major
differences between the genomes of CBA120, ViI and

Page 6 of 14

AG3 lie in the genes encoding their host-recognition
elements – CBA120 orfs 210-213 (Table 2) – though
there are clear relationships. Orfs 210, 212 and 213
encode spike proteins, as has been discussed for ViI
[20]. The N-terminal 163 amino acids of the tail spikes
encoded by CBA120 orfs 210 and 212 are very similar
to each other and, from amino acid 23 on, to amino
acids 248-490 of the orf 213 tail spike. From that point
on, they diverge markedly. Much of the rest of orfs 210
and 212 show relationships to phage K1F, including its
endosialidase region, and to podovirus EcoDS1 as well
as to AG3 orf 207, while CBA120 orf 213 is more like
AG3 orf 213 over most of its length. The conserved Nterminal segment of the three CBA120 tail spikes is also
closely related (> 80%) to the N-terminal region of the
published tail-spike protein of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium phage Det7, the first myovirus
demonstrated to use a podovirus-like tail spike [36]; the
authors determined that this region is what binds to the
tail, and determined the crystal structure of the rest of
the spike, which looks much like that of phage P22.
(The still-unpublished full sequence of Det7 indicates
that it is also a member of this family (Sherwood Casjens, personal communication)). It is also > 60% related
to the same regions of the ViI 846 aa and 596 aa tail
spikes. The region from aa 103 to 211 of CBA120 orf
210 shows 45% identity with aa 156 to 264 of the tailspike gene of coliphage K1F, and similar strong identities are seen between this region of K1F and the
comparable regions of the gp 212 and 213 tailspikes.
The N-terminal 225-amino acid extension on the spike
encoded by orf 213 appears to be unique to the ViI
group of phages; one possibility is that it is involved in
transferring the signal to contract from that spike to the
myovirus tail structure after the spikes bind. CBA120
orf 211 encodes a putative tail fiber, with its primary

Discussion
Our extensive molecular and physiological knowledge
about the T4 and T5 phage families and the recent
explorations of this new ViI group of phages are proving
important in understanding phage ecology and pertinent
to the construction of cocktails targeting E. coli O157:
H7. The genomic analysis reported here clearly identifies
CBA120, ViI and AG3 as very distant and unusual
members of the T4 superfamily of phages. The Vi typing
phages for S. enterica serovar Typhi were first described
over 70 years ago [37] and morphologically characterized by Ackermann [19]. They were successfully used to
treat typhoid fever in the 1930’s and 1940’s in Los
Angeles and Montreal [38]. However, their physiological
properties were not well explored and their genomes
were only recently sequenced [20]. Phages like ViI have
been reported targeting Rhizobium meliloti [19,39], Acinetobacter [40,41] and Bordetella avium (Ackermann,
unpublished data) but have been little studied. Bacteriophage CBA120 is the first ViI-like phage identified
that targets E. coli, and, with Shigella phage AG3 [22],
the first of this group to be extensively explored both
physiologically and genomically.
E. coli, a facultative aerobe, grows in the intestinal
tracts of warm blooded animals, and phage CBA120,
isolated from the feces of feedlot cattle using E. coli
O157:H7 strain 12900, binds very efficiently and produces large bursts of phage in O157 both aerobically
and anaerobically. Interestingly, at high multiplicity of
infection the phage exhibits lysis inhibition, reported
previously only in T4 and a few close relatives, with a
significant delay in lysis time and a burst size of > 1000.
CBA120 is highly specific for O157 and infects most
O157:H7 strains. Only one other E. coli strain (ECOR
70) has been found that it can infect, and none of the
standard test battery of Salmonella, Shigella and other
pathogenic enteric bacteria routinely used at the USDA
Agricultural Research Center in College Station, Texas
were susceptible.
Relatives of E. coli phage T4 constitute one of the
most ecologically and genomically diverse groups of
phages known [28,30,42] and are major components of
therapeutic cocktails used to target enteric bacteria in
various parts of the world [43,44]. Sequenced members
of the “T4 superfamily” now include phages of enterobacteria, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Delftia, Vibrio, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. They all share at least
33 genes that have resisted major divergence throughout
a long period of evolution and have been used to
develop a useful analytical tool, “core genes” [45,46].

Page 7 of 14

Further groups of their genes are broadly shared within
subsets of these T4-related phages, presumably reflecting adaptations to various ecosystems. All of these core
genes except for gene 34, encoding the proximal arm of
the tail fiber, are present in some form in CBA120, AG3
and ViI, whose structural-protein genes are often more
closely related to those of the T4-like cyanobacterial
phages than to similar phages from enteric sources.
Nearly 70 of their genes are related to genes of D. acidovorans phage W-14 [47] (GenBank accession number
GQ357915.1).
The number and diversity of sequenced T4-related
phages, the extent of conservation in many of the proteins involved, the depth of knowledge of the T4 tail
structure, assembly and infection process [25], and the
very thorough proteomic study of the ViI phage particle
[20] now lay the groundwork for exploring the evolution
of the complex myoviral tail structure. CBA120, AG3,
ViI, W-14 and 16 fully sequenced cyanophages all
show substantial conservation of the proteins of the
neck, tail tube and sheath proteins and most of the proteins found in the central part of the T4 baseplate: gp48,
gp53, gp25 and gp6 [42]. The outer T-even baseplate
proteins - gp7, 8, 9, and 10 – are all missing in the ViI
group. So are all parts of T4’s long tail fibers for reversible adsorption, the short tail fibers involved in irreversible adsorption (gp 11 and 12), and gp29, T4’s “tapemeasure protein”, determining the length of the tail. It
seems likely that some of the new proteins detected in
the proteomic studies of ViI take the place of some of
these missing proteins in the baseplate structure. Likely
candidates include the products of CBA120 orfs 45 and
47, which cluster with the homologues of T4 genes 54
and 48, and of orfs 209, 215 and 216, clustering with
the T4 gp6 homologue and the CBA120 tail spikes.
Of particular interest is comparative analysis of the
central baseplate hub protein gp5, which plays a fundamental role in tail-tube penetration of the peptidoglycan
layer. A lysozyme is embedded in gp5 for both T4 and
CBA120, but the CBA120 lysozyme is of apparent bacterial rather than phage origin and very different from
the one involved in the T4 infection process, which is
related to the lysozyme T4 uses to exit the cell. In the
case of CBA120, no holin or lysis enzyme for ending the
infection cycle has yet been identified. Such enzymes are
highly variable [48].
Host-Cell Recognition Elements

The presumed adhesion elements of CBA120 include
spike-like proteins, related to the tail-spike proteins of
ViI [20] (genes ViOI_170, 171 and 172) and to orfs 207
and 212 of AG3 [22]. The three CBA120 spike proteins
(encoded by orfs210, 212 and 213) are distantly related
to each other, and are very similar in their N-terminal

Kutter et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:430
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/430

regions (Table 2). This N-terminal portion is also very
similar to the corresponding region of the sequenced
and crystallized spike protein of Salmonella phage Det7
[36] and contains a segment related to the endosialidase
in the spike of podovirus K1F [49]. The published crystal structure of the Det7 spike suggests that the N-terminal end is responsible for the interactions between the
tail spikes and the baseplate and/or the fibrous protein
shown to surround the baseplate in ViI [20], while the
C-terminal and central domains form the actual adhesin.
The protein encoded by CBA120 orf 213 is significantly
longer than those encoded by orf 210 and orf 212 (1037
amino acids vs. 771 and 628, respectively); interestingly,
orf 213’s extra amino acids lie at the N-terminus of the
protein, in front of the conserved baseplate-binding
region. The proteomic analysis of ViI indicated that all
three of the tail-spike proteins and the apparent tail
fiber encoded by orf 211 are being incorporated into
phage, though it was not possible to distinguish whether
all are expressed in each infected cell or on each phage
particle. The SP6 group of podoviruses, including Salmonella typhii typing phage ViIV, each encode two tail
spikes that can target two different receptors, though
only in the case of KI-5 are the two receptor targets
known [50]. The modular property of the genes would
be expected to facilitate recombination between tail
spikes, potentially broadening the host range.
CBA120 orf 211, the fourth member of this cluster of
CBA120 genes, encodes a purported tail fiber. Up to aa
254, it is virtually identical to the protein encoded by
ViI_171c and also has substantial similarity to AG3 orf
210. However, beyond that point CBA120 orf 211 is
very different from the other ViI-like phages. It shows
high similarity over the rest of its length only to purported tail-fiber proteins of coliphages phiV10, a podoviral prophage in E. coli O157 (NCBI Reference
Sequence: YP_512279.1) and siphovirus JK06 (isolated in
Israel and reportedly highly specific for E. coli O157)
(YP_277515). In contrast, the rest of the fiber of AG3
encoded by orf 210 is most closely related to the putative tail fiber proteins of Erwinia amylovora phage
Era103 (YP_001039674.1) and of Escherichia myovirus
rv5 (YP_002003543) [16]. AG3 orf 213 seems to encode
a second fiber, rather than a third spike as for CBA120.
It is most closely related to the tail fibers of T7-like
Klebsiella phage K11 (YP_002003830) and Prochlorococcus T4-like myovirus P-SSM2 (YP_214526.1)
CBA120 is by far the most specific phage we have
seen to date with regards to host range. It is also the
first T4-related coliphage that has been reported to use
tail spikes, with their concomitant enzymatic activity, as
well as a tail fiber. The similarity of CBA120’s tail fiber
to those of two very different phages specific for O157
suggests that the fiber also plays an important role in

Page 8 of 14

host-cell recognition. Two other observations appear
relevant in considering the interactions between
CBA120 and E. coli O157. First, the O157 polysaccharide component is one of the few known to be produced
in free form, able to produce a capsule around the cell
(under separate control) that modulates its infectivity as
well as being bound up in the LPS [51,52]. Secondly, the
O157 LPS is one of only three of the coli O antigens
reported to date that is found in some strains of Salmonella as well as in E. coli [53].
These observations support the possibility that the
phage originally developed infecting Salmonella and
migrated relatively recently to E. coli O157, with the
tail-spike enzyme, which had presumably evolved in an
O157 Salmonella strain, particularly useful in dealing
with the E. coli O157 capsule. That, in turn, would help
explain how CBA120 can be so closely related to phage
ViI, with all but 17 genes in common and very similar
in sequence and everything in the same order, as seen
in Figure 5 - an extremely unusual degree of interspecies closeness among these larger phages.
Base Composition

The evidence strongly suggests that, like T4, phage
CBA120 uses a non-canonical base in its DNA; however,
rather than substituting hmdCyt for Cyt, it appears to
substitute hmdUra, or a derivative thereof, for thymidine. As shown here, CBA120 cannot incorporate 3HdThd into its DNA, and its “thymidylate synthase” bears
resemblance to the hmdUra synthases of W-14, YuA
and SPO1 (as do those of ViI and AG3). Also, it makes
a dNMP kinase which is most similar to that for Pseudomonas phage YuA, which is also purported to incorporate hmdUMP into its DNA. Furthermore, the
CBA120 genome is not susceptible to attack by those
restriction enzymes previously shown to be inhibited by
such a substitution (data not shown). It appears likely
that its dUTPase/dUDPase is also a dTTPase/dTDPase
(in parallel with that enzyme in T4 also being a
dCTPase/dCDPase). Otherwise, some of the labeled dT
should get in using the host dTMP kinase even if the
hmdUMP kinase wouldn’t work on dTMP coming from
outside (or from host DNA breakdown).
The ViI-like family seems to be the first group of
enteric phages to make use of hmdUra. It is not yet
clear what advantages this brings besides protection
against some restriction enzymes, but it is possible that
the use of hmdUra also allows this phage family to
infect a wider range of bacterial species. For example
the hmdUra modification may play a significant role in
allowing ViI phage to infect not only S. Typhi but also
other species that possess the Vi capsule, such as some
S. Dublin and S. Typhimurium isolates and Citrobacter
freundii (data not shown). The presence of the new

Kutter et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:430
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/430

hydroxyl group in the major groove is sometimes used
to enable further modifications, such as the protective
glycosylation of the T-even phage DNA and the formation of putrescine in the DNA of FW14 that allows the
packaging of substantially more DNA. The substitution
of hmdCyt for Cyt in the DNA of T4 and its many closely-related phages protects them from degradation by
many restriction enzymes. This substitution also allows
T4 to selectively degrade the cytosine-containing DNA
of its hosts and other phages, initiated by a pair of endonucleases, endo II (which nicks the DNA) and endo IV
(which cleaves the single-stranded DNA opposite the
nicks). Furthermore, T4 has developed a method of
blocking transcription of all cytosine-containing DNA
(as discussed below under gene expression). In B. subtilis phage SPO1, the one genetically well-characterized
phage that uses hmdUra rather than dThd in its DNA,
the middle-mode genes are preferentially transcribed
from DNA that has hmdUra rather than dThd [32].
Whatever the nature and effect of the modification,
we have determined that CBA120 is not protected from
the mechanisms T5-like siphovirus CEV2 uses to take
over the cell; in high-MOI coinfection, CEV2 has a normal burst size and totally suppresses CBA120 (unpublished data). In contrast, the T4-like myovirus CEV1
suppresses CEV2 while itself making a normal burst of
phage [12].

expected to require extensive experimental work, as it
did in T4 [54,55]. In particular, points where the direction of transcription diverges must utilize a still-unidentified promoter in each direction.
CBA120 has a few canonical E. coli s70 promoters, as
also seen in T4. However, their role in phage gene regulation is not clear. T4 rapidly redirects most host RNA
polymerase from about 650 s 70 -dependent to 39 T4specific immediate early promoters. This rapidly turns
off host transcription even in T4 mutants lacking the
Alc protein, which blocks the elongation of transcription
on cytosine-containing DNA [56,57]. T4 also carries in
its capsid a protein, gpalt, which adds an ADP ribose to
one of the two alpha subunits of the RNA polymerase
and may facilitate this transition, but little difference is
seen in its absence. We have been unable to identify
potential early promoters in CBA120 on the basis of
informatics, and as detailed above it has no apparent
homologues of the proteins involved in T4 early and
middle-mode gene regulation. A similar lack of apparent
separate middle-mode transcription signals has been
reported for other distantly T4-related phages, including
vibriophage KVP40 and the cyanophages; it has been
suggested that distance from the promoter and anti-termination may be more involved in regulation of
delayed-early genes there [30].
Lysis and Lysis Inhibition

Gene Expression

The presence of homologs of T4 gp55 and gp33 in the
CBA120 genome suggests that, like T4, late transcriptional control is exerted by producing a new, highly
unusual sigma factor, leading to a total change in promoter recognition when it interacts with the host RNA
polymerase. The T4 gp55 is much smaller than the
host’s s70 and interacts only with the -10 region of the
promoter, not with a -35 region. Instead, it interacts
directly with the host RNA polymerase and the DNA
replicative complex (through the mediation of gp33 and
gp45), which acts as a “moving enhancer”, in the words
of P. Geiduschek, whose laboratory did much of the
work in this area [29]. This effectively links capsid protein production and DNA synthesis.
The situation with regard to early and middle gene
recognition is much more complex. Neither the ViI-like
phages nor the cyanophages have homologs of gpalt or
gpmodA, which, in T4 and many related phages, ADP
ribosylate one (Alt) and later both (ModA) of the alpha
subunits of the host RNA polymerase, modulating early
transcription. They also do not have any MotA, AsiA or
other obvious mechanism of regulating the slightly later
transcription of the genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA replication. Identifying the control
signals and proteins involved in each case can be

As mentioned above, neither the lytic enzyme nor a
holin to let it reach the peptidogycan layer and thus
control lysis timing has of yet been identified for
CBA120, or for ViI or AG3. This is of special interest in
trying to understand the apparent lysis inhibition
observed above in high-MOI infections. For T4, lysis
inhibition has been shown to depend on an interaction
between the holin and a labile periplasmic antiholin,
encoded by the rI gene, which is somehow able to
detect superinfection at any point until just before the
normal time of lysis and delay lysis for several hours
[58-60]. It will be very interesting to see whether the
lysis-inhibition mechanism is related in T4 and CBA120,
even though the proteins involved seem to be very
different.

Conclusion
CBA120 is representative of a newly described group of
phages that appear to be of interest evolutionarily, ecologically and historically. Recently, such phages, related
to Salmonella Typhi phage ViI, have been discovered
infecting a variety of different Enterobacteriaceae. The
major distinguishing feature between them and other
T4-like phages seems to be their strategy in host recognition, with the ViI-like phages employing spikes related
to ones commonly seen in podoviruses, incorporating

Kutter et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:430
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/430

an endoglycosidase into their structure, rather than relying on the long tail fibers seen in the other T4-related
phages. On the other had, the reticular network that
sometimes appears around the baseplate (Figure 1,
arrow B), also seen in ViI, has not been reported in
podoviruses. While many tail elements are well conserved in these and other T4-related phages, the outer
baseplate proteins are very different, with no apparent
homologues of the T4 gp12, responsible for the irreversible final step in host binding and different also from
those of cyanophages. Each of the phages that have
been sequenced to date in this ViI group encodes three
different but related spikes, one of which contains a
225-amino acid N-terminal extension that could possibly transmit information on binding that instigates tail
contraction. It is not yet clear just what role these play
in determining their host ranges, or even whether each
given phage carries all three different spikes.
Another major apparent difference in infection strategy between the three known major groups of T4related phages, carrying the core T4 set of structural
and replication-related genes, lies in their choice of pyrimidine bases. While the cyanophages, other oceanic
phages and a few of the phages infecting enteric bacteria
use the canonical bases cytosine and thymine, it appears
that those ViI-like phages sequenced to date produce
and incorporate hmdUra rather than thymidine, just as
most of the previously-known T4-like phages infecting
enteric bacteria use hmdCyt rather than cytosine in
synthesizing their DNA. It will be very interesting to
compare the consequences of these major strategic
choice differences between T4, the T4-like cyanophages
and these ViI-like phages which all share a substantial
core set of the genes encoding most morphogenetic and
replicative proteins.

Materials and methods
Bacteria and Bacteriophages

Phage CBA120 and CBA6 were isolated from a feedlot
in the southern plains region of the U.S.A., as previously
described [17,18]. Phages CEV1 and CEV2 were isolated
from two different flocks of Texas sheep [12,13]. All
three phage were propagated on E. coli O157:H7 NCTC
12900, which lacks the Shiga-toxin (Stx) genes (Biosafety
level 1; obtained from the American Type Culture Collection: ATCC 700728). Phage stocks were prepared as
per our standard lab method where the host organism,
E. coli O157:H7 NCTC 12900, was grown in tryptic soy
broth (Bacto-TSB, Becton Dickinson Cat.# 214530) to
an OD 600 nm ~0.2 before adding phage to an MOI
~0.01-0.1. The mixtures were then returned to a shaking
water bath (180 rpm) at 37°C. After 90 min a few drops
of chloroform (CHCl3) were added to complete lysis of
the infected cells and the stock was placed in the dark

at room temperature for ~12 h allow any free DNA to
be degraded. The phage culture was centrifuged for 20
min at 5500 × g to remove bacterial debris, followed by
2 h at 15,000 × g to precipitate the phage. The phage
pellets were allowed to slowly resuspend for 24-48 h at
4°C into phage buffer (1 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 mg mL-1
gelatin, 4 mg mL-1, NaCl), yielding a final titer > 1011
PFU mL-1, and stored at 4°C.
Host Range Determination and Efficiency of Plating (EOP)

The host ranges and efficiencies of plating were determined as described [61]. Square plastic plates embossed
with a 6 × 6 grid containing TSA (1% w/v agar) were
overlaid with 4 mL molten top TSA (0.3% w/v agar)
containing 0.3 mL of an exponential culture of the host
strain to be tested. Once dry, 10 μL of each phage stock
(~10 8 PFU mL -1 on strain 12900) was spotted on the
plate and incubated at 37°C overnight. For those testing
positive, a series of dilutions was then spotted in similar
fashion to determine the EOP (phage titer on the strain
being examined/phage titer on NCTC 12900, for
CBA120). Bacterial strains tested included standard lab
strains; the 72-member E. coli collection of reference
(ECOR) from the University of Rochester, NY [62]; a set
of 15 pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 strains from the Federal Disease Investigation Unit (FDIU-Washington State
University); and a group of 107 E. coli strains from cows
with post-partum metritis isolated at The Evergreen
State College by Mike Paros and Tom Denes and at
Cornell University, Ithaca, New York by Rodrigo
Bicalho.
Transmission Electron Microscopy

Phages for electron microscopy were sedimented for 60
min at 25,000 × g using a JA-18.1 fixed angle rotor.
This was followed by two washes in 0.1 M neutral
ammonium acetate under the same conditions. Purified
phages were deposited on carbon-coated copper grids,
stained with 2% (w/v) potassium phosphotungstate (pH
7.0) and examined in a Philips EM 300 electron microscope operated at 60 kV. Magnification was monitored
with T4 phage tails.
High MOI Aerobic and Anaerobic Infections

Both aerobic and anaerobic infections of CBA120 were
carried out in TSB, as previously described [12,13].
Aerobic experiments used shake flasks at 37°C with agitation (180 rpm). Anaerobic experiments were conducted in anoxic TSB in butyl-rubber-sealed serum
bottles under an N2 head space at 37°C with agitation
(180 rpm). All transfers were carried out aseptically
using N2 flushed syringes. Once the culture had reached
OD 600 nm ~0.3 (mid-exponential phase), phage were
added at an MOI of ~5 (in ~1:20 of the culture volume)

Kutter et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:430
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/430

with rapid mixing. Samples were periodically taken until
lysis to determine cell density (OD 600 nm), enumerate
total phage (after immediate treatment with 100 μL
CHCl 3 , PFU mL -1 ), infective centers (PFU mL-1 ) and
bacterial survivors (CFU mL -1 ). Phage samples were
titered in duplicate using our standard double layer
technique aerobically on a lawn of strain 12900. Bacterial survivors were similarly titered on TSA plates.
Single-Step Growth Curve

This method of precisely determining the eclipse time
(until first appearance of mature phage) and latent period (until the start of lysis) was carried out as described
by Carlson (2005) [63]. Infection was carried out aerobically in TSB, as described above, at an MOI of 0.1. Five
min after infection, the culture was diluted in TSB and
102 , 104 ,105 and 106 fold dilutions were further incubated with agitation at 37°C. Samples for infective centers were plated directly out of flasks at the appropriate
dilution, while samples for total phage were taken from
an appropriate flask into tubes with chloroform and
allowed to sit for at least 15 min to let the cells lyse
before further dilution and plating.

H-dThd DNA Labeling

A 2 mL sample of culture was transferred 5 min after
phage infection to a 10 mL flask containing 0.1 mL dAdo
(2 mg mL-1 in H2O) and 0.1 mL dThd stock (100 μg mL1
dThd, 10 μCi mL-1 methyl 3H-dThd) and kept shaking
at 37°C. dAdo is added to allow the dThd to be taken up
by E. coli without being degraded by phosphorylase and
hydrolases, as described by Boyce and Setlow, 1962 [21].
For each sample, 50 μL was transferred to a 1 cm square
of 3 MM filter paper. After 1 min, the disk was dropped
into a beaker of ice cold 10% (v/v) acetic acid (about 5
mL/disk). At least 15 min after the final sampling, the
acetic acid was poured off and the disks washed twice for
15 min with the same volume of 5% (v/v) cold acetic
acid. A final 15 min rinse in 5 mL/disk of ice cold 100%
ethanol was used to wash out the acid and prevent undue
quenching. The disks were dried overnight and counted
in a Packard Tri-carb 2200CA liquid scintillation counter, using 10 mL of Perkin-Elmer CyberGold (Catalogue
# 6013320) as the counting fluid. A “total” sample, dried
without washing, was taken from each flask at the start
and end of the labeling experiment to confirm the
amount of label added.
DNA Isolation for Sequencing

A 1.5 mL aliquot of CBA120 (> 10 12 PFU mL -1 ) in
phage buffer was added to phenol (700 μL) in an Eppendorf tube and microcentrifuged at 13,5000 rpm for 10
min. The supernatant was subjected to a second identical phenol treatment, followed by two similar

Page 11 of 14

extractions with chloroform (700 μL). The DNA was
precipitated with 1.5 × vol 0.3 M sodium acetate-buffered cold ethanol (pH 5.3), pelleted by microcentrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 45 min, and washed in 70% (v/v)
ice-cold ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). An identical procedure was used to extract DNA for restriction
enzyme digests. The DNA was subjected to pyrosequencing (454 technology) at the McGill University and Genome Québec Innovation Centre (Montreal, QC,
Canada).
Genome Annotation

CBA120 was annotated with the aid of a variety of
online tools (http://molbiol-tools.ca; NCBI) and ARTEMIS [64]. The genome was initially subjected to automated annotation using AutoFACT [65] following which
all open reading frames (ORFs) were confirmed using
Kodon total genome and sequence analysis software,
version 2.0 (Applied Maths Inc., Austin, TX. USA).
Annotation was then manually curated as described previously [64] using Artemis software [66] to collect the
data and facilitate annotation. The predicted proteins
were compared again the PFAM database of protein
domain hidden Markov models [67] and investigated for
helix-turn-helix structural motifs. The results of all the
analysis were assembled using Artemis. Genes were
identified from among the predicted coding sequences
(CDSs) based on the presence of ATG, GTG, CTG or
TTG start codons, at least 30 additional codons, and an
upstream sequence resembling the Shine-Dalgarno ribosome-binding site, GGAGGT [68], making corrections
for initially miss-identified start codons. BLASTP was
used to determine similarities in the global database at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Genomic comparisons at
the proteomic level were made using CoreGenes [69,70].
Transmembrane domains were predicted using
TMHMM v2.0 and Phobius [71]. Phage-encoded tRNA
genes were identified with Aragorn, using the default
parameters [72]. A few promoters were identified based
on sequence homology to the consensus E. coli promoter, TTGACA (N15-18 ) TATAAT. The annotated genome sequence was submitted to the NCBI nucleotide
database under accession number JN593240. Genomic
comparisons were carried out using BLASTN and
BLASTX [73]. Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) was
used to visualize pairwise genomic comparisons [23].
The following genome sequences were used in the genomic comparisons with CBA120 phage: phage ViI (accession number: FQ312032) and AG3 (accession number:
FJ373894). Orthologs in the CBA120, ViI and AG3
phages were identified using an all-against-all reciprocal
FASTA comparison of translated DNA with at least 40%
identity over 80% of the length [74].

Tree Construction

Proteins were aligned using the local pair algorithm in
MAFFT with BLOSUM 30 used as the scoring matrix.
The maximum likelihood topology, branch lengths and
bootstraps were obtained with PhyML, where the WAG
+I+GAMMA (8) model of evolution was employed. The
NJ bootstraps where calculated using the Poisson distance between sequences over 100 pseudoreplicates. Parsimony bootstraps correspond to the bipartitions pattern
obtained after 100 pseudoreplicates. In all cases gaps
were treated as unknown states.
