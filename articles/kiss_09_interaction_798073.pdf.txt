Abstract
Background: Third-stage infective larvae (L3) of hookworms are in an obligatory state of
developmental arrest that ends upon entering the definitive host, where they receive a signal that
re-activates development. Recovery from the developmentally arrested dauer stage of
Caenorhabditis elegans is analogous to the resumption of development during hookworm infection.
Insulin-like signaling (ILS) mediates recovery from arrest in C. elegans and activation of hookworm
dauer L3. In C. elegans, phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 in response
to ILS creates binding cites for the 14-3-3 protein Ce-FTT-2, which translocates DAF-16 out of the
nucleus, resulting in resumption of reproductive development.
Results: To determine if hookworm 14-3-3 proteins play a similar role in L3 activation, hookworm
FTT-2 was identified and tested for its ability to interact with A. caninum DAF-16 in vitro. The AcFTT-2 amino acid sequence was 91% identical to the Ce-FTT-2, and was most closely related to
FTT-2 from other nematodes. Ac-FTT-2 was expressed in HEK 293T cells, and was recognized by
an antibody against human 14-3-3β isoform. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations using anti-epitope
tag antibodies indicated that Ac-FTT-2 interacts with Ac-DAF-16 when co-expressed in serumstimulated HEK 293T cells. This interaction requires intact Akt consensus phosphorylation sites at
serine107 and threonine312, but not serine381. Ac-FTT-2 was undetectable by Western blot in
excretory/secretory products from serum-stimulated (activated) L3 or adult A. caninum.
Conclusion: The results indicate that Ac-FTT-2 interacts with DAF-16 in a phosphorylation-site
dependent manner, and suggests that Ac-FTT-2 mediates activation of L3 by binding Ac-DAF-16
during hookworm infection.

Background
Hookworm infection is one of the most common chronic
illnesses in the world, with an estimated 740 million
infections [1]. The developmentally arrested third-stage
infective larvae (L3) of hookworms resume development
in response to a host-specific signal encountered during

invasion. This cue initiates a signaling pathway that
results in expression of genes required for development
and molting to the L4 and subsequent adult stage. This
signaling pathway represents a potential target for intervention in the hookworm life cycle as a means of preventing infection.

When non-feeding arrested L3 of the canine hookworm
Ancylostoma caninum are incubated with serum components in vitro, they resume feeding within 12 hrs [2,3].
While they do not molt in vitro, "activation" by serum
induces the release of molecules associated with infection,
including proteases and activation-associated secretory
proteins (ASPs) [4-7], and differential gene expression [8].
Hookworm L3 activation is mediated by an insulin-like
signaling (ILS) pathway, similar to recovery from the analogous dauer stage of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [9,10]. This dauer stage is morphologically,
behaviorally, and functionally analogous to the hookworm L3, and recovery from it has been proposed as a
model for the hookworm infective process [11,12]. The
molecular biology of dauer recovery is well-defined, and
has provided a useful framework for investigation of the
molecular biology of hookworm infection.
Recovery from dauer in C. elegans is mediated by an insulin-like signaling (ILS) pathway [13]. Replete environmental conditions initiate a signaling cascade through an
insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-like receptor (encoded by
the daf-2 gene), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K,
age-1), and protein kinase B/Akt [14-20]. One of the key
downstream targets of ILS is the forkhead/FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Under dauer-inducing conditions, DAF-16 is located primarily in the nucleus, where it
binds to target genes and mediates entry into and maintenance of dauer [15,21]. ILS during recovery causes the
phosphorylation of DAF-16 by the serine/threonine
kinase Akt [18], thereby creating binding sites for 14-3-3
proteins [22]. Binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated DAF16 results in translocation of DAF-16 from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm, and expression of genes associated with
growth and development [23,24].
The 14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved ~30 kDa acidic
dimeric proteins found in all eukaryotes. They function in
cell signaling, cell cycle regulation, intracellular trafficking, and other process by modulating protein-protein
interactions [22]. Typically organisms contain several isoforms, and homo- or heterodimers bind to phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-containing motifs [25]. All
forms of 14-3-3 share a similar tertiary structure, the
dimer contact residues are highly conserved, and each
monomer is capable of binding a phosphopeptide independently [25]. There are two isoforms of 14-3-3 in C. elegans, ftt-2 and par-5, but only ftt-2 is involved in regulation
of DAF-16. Specific knockdown by RNAi of ftt-2, but not
par-5, caused increased transcription of DAF-16 target
genes [26].
Activation of hookworm L3 requires ILS [13,27], and
recently the ortholog of Ce-DAF-16 was identified from
the hookworms A. caninum and A. ceylanicum and shown
to bind to a conserved DNA binding element [28]. Given

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/21

the conservation of this pathway and the similarity
between L3 activation and dauer recovery, we asked
whether Ac-DAF-16 was regulated by a 14-3-3 protein as
well. We report here that the ortholog of Ce-FTT-2 from A.
caninum interacts with Ac-DAF-16 in vivo, and that this
interaction requires intact Akt phosphorylation sites on
DAF-16. This provides further support for the use of dauer
recovery as a model for larval activation during the hookworm infective process.

Results
Cloning and characterization of Ac-ftt-2
A consensus sequence of a cluster of eight A. caninum
expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences homologous to
14-3-3 proteins was used to design oligonucleotide primers to isolate the complete Ac-ftt-2 cDNA from A. caninum.
Using a hemi-nested strategy, the 5' end was isolated using
the conserved nematode spliced leader sequence [29] as
the forward primer, coupled with two nested gene-specific
reverse primers in successive PCR reactions. The second
reaction produced an amplicon of approximately 600 bp
that contained the SL sequence and overlapped the 5' end
of the A. caninum EST sequence. A similar strategy was
used to isolate the 3' end from an A. caninum cDNA
library. A reverse primer complementary to the flanking
T7 sequence in the vector was used with two nested forward primers to generate an amplicon of approximately
700 bp that contained a poly d(A) tail, and overlapped the
EST and the 5' end sequences. New primers were designed
to amplify the entire coding sequence of A. caninum 14-33 cDNA, which was cloned into pET28 vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands. The fulllength cDNA sequence was deposited in GenBank (accession number FJ842376).

The full-length 14-3-3 cDNA contained the conserved 22
nucleotide nematode SL at the 5' end [30], which was followed by 33 untranslated nucleotides and an ATG codon
encoding the starting methionine at nucleotide 56. The
cDNA is predicted to encode an open reading frame of
249 amino acids, ending with a TAA termination codon at
nucleotide 803, and followed by a 327 bp 3'-untranslated
region. A canonical AATAAT polyadenylation signal [31]
was located 11 bp upstream of the poly (dA) tail (nucleotides 1116 to 1121). The deduced amino acid sequence
has a predicted mass of 28174 Da and a calculated pI of
4.87. The hookworm 14-3-3 lacks a secretory signal peptide [32], and contains a nuclear export signal (LxxxLxL)
[33] at amino acids 223 to 229, consistent with a role in
nuclear transport [34].
A BLASTP search [35] of the non-redundant GenBank
database using the deduced amino acid sequence confirmed that the hookworm protein was a member of the
14-3-3 protein family (Pfam PF00244, Interpro
IPR000308). The best matches were to nematode 14-3-3

proteins, including Caenorhabditis briggsae (score 464, 2e129), C. elegans (score 464, 4e-129). C. brenneri (score
462, 8e-129), and Meloidogyne incognita (score 461, 3e128). While mammals have at least seven closely related
isoforms [22], C. elegans has only two [26]. Alignment
with Ce-FTT-1 (also known as PAR-5) and Ce-FTT-2
amino acid sequences shows that the hookworm 14-3-3 is
more closely related to Ce-FTT-2 (91% identity) than CeFTT-1 (83% identity) (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicates the hookworm 14-3-3 clusters
most closely with FTT-2 isoforms from several other nematodes, including M. incognita and Brugia malayi (Fig. 1B).
Therefore, the hookworm 14-3-3 protein most likely represents the Ce-FTT-2 ortholog, and will be referred to as
Ac-FTT-2.
The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of dimeric proteins that
modulate protein-protein interactions [22]. Phosphorylation of the interacting protein at sequence-specific sites
mediates its interaction with the 14-3-3. Each subunit of
the 14-3-3 dimer can bind to a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine ligand independently [34]. The most highly
conserved region, the peptide-binding pocket, contains
the residues that contact the phosphorylated amino acids.
These residues (Lys51, Arg58, Arg129 and Tyr130) are
completely conserved in Ac-FTT-2 (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal portion of 14-3-3 proteins is required for dimerization, and contains two conserved phosphorylation sites
(Ser59 and Ser65) that are substrates for several kinases in
mammals, including Akt and protein kinase C (PKC) [22].
Phosphorylation of Ser59 converted 14-3-3 dimers to
monomers [36], suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism. However, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) site at
amino acid 186 [22] is absent from both Ac-FTT-2 and CeFTT-2, but is conserved in PAR-5. This further supports the
conclusion that Ac-FTT-2 represents the ortholog of CeFTT-2.
Transfection and immunoprecipitation of Ac-FTT-2 from
HEK 293 cells
Given the high level of conservation in 14-3-3 molecules,
we tested whether an antibody against the human β isoform of 14-3-3 could detect Ac-FTT-2. As shown in Figure
2A, the 14-3-3β antibody recognized a single band in
lysates of both untreated and serum-stimulated (activated) A. caninum L3 by Western blot. Next, we expressed
recombinant Ac-FTT containing a V5 epitope tag in
HEK293 cells. Western blotting of cell lysates indicated
that Ac-FTT-2 was expressed in mammalian cells (Fig. 2B).
An anti-V5 body recognized a single band of the appropriate size in lysates of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1V5/
Ac-ftt-2 plasmid, but not in lysates from cells transfected
with empty vector. The 14-3-3β antibody recognized two
bands in the transfected cells, and a single band in the
mock transfected cells. The lower molecular weight band,
present in both transfected and mock cells, is endogenous

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/21

14-3-3, while the higher molecular weight band is the
expressed FTT-2/V5 fusion protein, which migrates more
slowly in the gel because of the attached epitope tag. This
indicates that recombinant Ac-FTT-2 can be expressed in
mammalian cells, and recognized by an antibody against
the epitope tag and an anti-human 14-3-3 antibody.
Dauer recovery in C. elegans is mediated by 14-3-3
through regulation of DAF-16 subcellular localization
and transcriptional activities [26]. This regulation is
dependent on insulin-like signalling [23]. Because the
resumption of development associated with infection in
hookworms is analogous to dauer recovery [11,37], we
hypothesized that DAF-16 is regulated by 14-3-3 in
response to ILS as in dauer recovery in C. elegans. Previously, we demonstrated that Ac-DAF-16 binds to and
drives transcription from a conserved hookworm DAF-16
DNA binding element in mammalian cells [38]. As hookworms have yet to be transfected with foreign DNA, we
again used mammalian cells to examine interactions
between Ac-FTT-2 and Ac-DAF-16.
We first tested whether we could immunoprecipitate
recombinant V5-tagged Ac-FTT-2 from HEK293 cell
lysates. As shown in Figure 2C, anti-V5 antibody successfully pulled down recombinant A. caninum FTT-2, as
detected by Western blot with HRP-conjugated anti-V5
antibody (lane 3) and with anti-14-3-3β (not shown). AcFTT was not detected in unbound supernatant from the
immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2C, lane 2), nor in control
(empty vector) transfected cell lysate supernatant or
immunoprecipitate (lanes 4 and 5, respectively), indicating that the ant-V5 antibody specifically precipitated the
recombinant Ac-FTT-2.
After confirming that we could express and immunoprecipitate recombinant Ac-FTT, we next tested if Ac-FTT-2
and Ac-DAF-16 interact in vivo. In C. elegans, FTT-2 interacts with and regulates Ce-DAF-16 by excluding it from
the nucleus [26]. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with
equal amounts of plasmid pcDNA3.1V5/Ac-ftt-2, encoding V5-tagged Ac-FTT-2, and plasmid pCMV4FLAG/Acdaf-16 encoding FLAG-tagged A. caninum forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 [38]. After serum treatment for 24
hrs, reciprocal co-IP was performed on cell lysates using
anti-V5 and anti-FLAG antibody resin.
As shown in Figure 3A, anti-FLAG agarose pulled down
both a 64 kDa FLAG-tagged DAF-16 and the V5-tagged
recombinant Ac-FTT-2 from co-transfected cells (lanes 3),
but only recombinant DAF-16 from cells singly transfected
with Ac-daf-16 (lane 1). As expected, anti-FLAG agarose did
not pull down any protein from the Ac-ftt-2 singly transfected cells (lane 2). Conversely, anti-V5 agarose precipitated both proteins from co-transfected cells, but only
recombinant 14-3-3 from cells singly transfected with the

Ac-ftt-2 construct, and nothing from cells expressing recombinant Ac-DAF-16 only (Fig. 3B). This indicates that AcFTT-2 interacts with Ac-DAF-16 in mammalian cell culture,
and suggests that a similar interaction occurs in worms.
Intact phosphorylation sites are required for the FTT-2 –
DAF-16 interaction
Interaction of 14-3-3 with Ce-DAF-16 requires phosphorylation of specific serine or threonine residues by the protein
kinase Akt (Cahill et al., 2001). To determine if the predicted
Akt phosphorylation sites are important for the interaction
of hookworm 14-3-3 and DAF-16, recombinant Ac-DAF-16
proteins with the phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine
were tested for their ability to co-IP recombinant FTT-2 when
co-expressed in HEK293 cells. Anti-FLAG M2 resin co-immunoprecipitated recombinant Ac-FTT-2 and wild type FLAGtagged DAF-16 from cells expressing both proteins (Figure
4). However, mutation of serine107 to alanine (S107A)
completely abolished the interaction with Ac-FTT-2, either
singly or in combination with mutations at the other Akt
phosphorylation sites (S107A:T312A, S107A:S381A, or triple). Mutation of threonine 312 (T312A) alone or in combination with mutations at the other sites also severely
diminished the interaction with FTT-2 However, mutation of
serine 381 (S381A) had no effect on the interaction with 143-3 (Figure 4). These data indicate that serine107 and
threonine312 are essential for the interaction of Ac-DAF-16
with Ac-FTT-2.
Secretion of Ac-FTT-2
Hookworm L3 activated in vitro by incubation with serum
components under host-like conditions release multiple
proteins, including the activation associated secretory
proteins 1 and 2 (ASP-1 and ASP-2) [5,6] and a metalloprotease [4]. Adult worms release molecules associated
with feeding and survival in the host intestine, including
anticoagulants [39], ASPs [40] and protease inhibitors
[41]. To determine if Ac-FTT-2 was secreted, we took
advantage of the cross-reactivity with the anti-human 143-3β antibody to examine ESP from L3 and adult stages by
Western blot. As seen in Figure 5A, 14-3-3β antibody
failed to detect any bands in non-activated, activated L3,
or adult ESP (lanes 1–3), but recognized recombinant AcFTT-2 expressed in HEK293 cells (lane 4). As a control, L3
ESP were probed with ASP-1 antiserum, which detects a
band in activated but not non-activated ESP (Figure 5B,
lanes 1–3) [5]. Furthermore, antiserum against Ac-TMP-1,
known to be released in adult ESP [42], detected Ac-TMP
in the adult ESP (Figure 5B, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that
the ESP contained secreted proteins. These data indicate
that Ac-FTT-2 is not released in detectable amounts by
either activated L3 or adult A. caninum.

Discussion
When hookworm L3 infective stage larvae encounter and
invade a permissive host, developmental pathways are

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/21

initiated by host-specific signals and lead to the maturation of larvae into adult parasites. The molecular details of
this process are unknown, but clues to hookworm developmental processes have been revealed by studies of the
related free-living nematode C. elegans. Specifically, dauer
recovery in C. elegans has been compared to the transition
to parasitism in hookworms [11,37], and they share several conserved pathways and molecules [27,38,43,44].
Despite these similarities, detailed mechanistic knowledge of the molecular biology of the transition to parasitism is difficult to obtain due to the inability of
hookworms to complete their life cycle in vitro. For this
reason, the regulation and function of hookworm molecules must be studied indirectly, using heterologous systems. This and a previous study [38] represent the first
applications of a mammalian cell culture system to investigate hookworm molecular biology. This system will
allow us to investigate molecular mechanisms of hookworm infection for the first time.
Dauer recovery in C. elegans is mediated by ILS signaling
in response to improving environmental conditions [13].
ILS activates the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB, which
in turn phosphorylates the forkhead transcription factor
DAF-16 on multiple serine/threonine residues [18]. Phosphorylation of DAF-16 creates binding sites for the 14-33 family protein FTT-2 and translocates DAF-16 to the
cytoplasm [23,26], thereby allowing a pattern of gene
expression associated with reproductive development.
Previously, we isolated an ortholog of DAF-16 from the
hookworm A. caninum, and demonstrated that it bound
to and drove transcription from a conserved DAF-16 binding element when expressed in mammalian cells [38]. The
similarity between A. caninum and C. elegans ILS and
recovery from dauer arrest led us to hypothesize that ILS
plays a similar role in hookworms. To investigate the regulation of Ac-DAF-16 by 14-3-3, we isolated the FTT-2
ortholog from A. caninum, and co-expressed it with AcDAF-16 in HEK293 cells
Most organisms contain multiple isoforms of 14-3-3,
including seven in mammals, two in Drosophila and yeast,
and 15 in plants [45]. Several isoforms have been identified in platyhelminths of the genera Echinococcus and
Schistosoma [46,47]. To date, no nematodes have been
shown to encode more than two FTT-2 isoforms.
Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the hookworm 14-3-3 was most closely related
to FTT-2 molecules from C. elegans and other nematodes.
Despite 86% sequence identity between 14-3-3 isoforms
FTT-2 and PAR-5 in C. elegans, only FTT-2 affects dauer
recovery. RNAi knockdown of Ce-ftt-2 enhanced dauer
formation at permissive temperatures in dauer constitutive daf-2 mutants, increased nuclear localization of DAF16, and promoted transcription of several DAF-16 target
genes [26]. The high level of sequence conservation of AcPage 5 of 13

FTT-2 with Ce-FTT-2 suggested that this isoform was most
likely to interact with Ac-DAF-16 in hookworms. While
FTT-2 affects dauer formation in C. elegans, PAR-5 also
weakly interacts with Ce-DAF-16, suggesting a possible
role in aspects of DAF-16 function other than those listed
above [26]. Indeed, over-expression of Ce-FTT-2 and PAR5 extend lifespan in a DAF-16-dependent manner, and
both interact with SIR-2.1 and DAF-16 in C. elegans [48].
While our data suggest that Ac-FTT-2 shares similar functions with Ce-FTT-2, we can not rule out a function in
infection for another isoform of 14-3-3 in hookworms.
Once we identified the appropriate 14-3-3 ortholog from
A. caninum, we introduced Ac-ftt-2 cDNA into mammalian expression vectors and expressed epitope tagged
fusion protein in HEK293 cells. The native and recom-

binant hookworm FTT-2 protein expressed in HEK293
cells was recognized by an antibody against the β isoform
of human 14-3-3. The antibody also detected an endogenous 14-3-3 protein in 293 cells, as indicated by the
lower molecular weight band that is also present in cells
transfected with empty vector. This antibody will permit
further investigation of Ac-FTT-2 function in vitro and with
native worm protein.
Ce-DAF-16 has been demonstrated to interact with 14-3-3
previously [26]. To determine if Ac-FTT-2 interacted with
Ac-DAF-16, we co-expressed both proteins in HEK293
cells and performed reciprocal co-IPs using antibodies
against the epitope tags on the recombinant proteins. We
were able to successfully IP both proteins using both antibodies from serum stimulated cells, indicating that FTT-2
interacts with DAF-16.
14-3-3 proteins bind to the specific amino acid sequence
motifs RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP, where pS represents
phosphoserine and X represents any amino acid [25,26].
RXRXXS is the consensus Akt phosphorylation site [23]
and corresponds closely with the 14-3-3 binding
sequence. Mammalian Akt phosphorylates FOXO proteins, the mammalian orthologs of DAF-16, at predicted

Typically, FOXO family proteins have three Akt phosphorylation sites, with sites P1 and P2 flanking the DNA binding domain in the N-terminal half of the molecule, and
site P3 in the C-terminal half. In FOXO-4, as in Ac-DAF16, the P1 and P2 sites are required for interaction with
the 14-3-3 protein [49]. Binding of the 14-3-3 to these
sites is believed to mask the DNA binding domain,
thereby interrupting the FOXO/DAF-16 function. Interestingly, this differs from the FTT-2/DAF-16 interaction in C.
elegans, where the analogous N-terminal P1 site and the Cterminal P3 site are required for interaction [23]. Our
results demonstrate the requirement of Akt phosphorylation sites for 14-3-3/DAF-16 association, and suggest that
Ac-14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated Ac-DAF-16 to mediate
ILS, as occurs in C. elegans. Further investigations are
underway to confirm this hypothesis.
14-3-3 proteins have been reported from a growing
number of helminth parasites. In nematodes, aside from
C. elegans and now A. caninum, the only other well characterized 14-3-3 proteins are from the root-knot nematode
Meloidogyne incognita [50]. Partial sequences from EST
databases have been reported from Strongyloides stercoralis,
Haemonchus contortus [46], and the hookworm of humans
Necator americanus [51]. A 29 kDa protein in ESP from the
adult stage of the ovine stomach worm Teladorsagia circumcincta was identified as a 14-3-3 protein [52]. The
complete descriptive and functional characterization of
these proteins remains to be performed.
More is known about the 14-3-3 proteins of platyhelminths. Multiple isoforms and sub-isoforms have been
identified and characterized in Schistosoma and Echinococcus species [46,47]. In S. mansoni, 14-3-3ε-1 interacts with
the TGF-β Type 1 receptor and enhances TGF-β signaling
[53]. TGF-β signaling is required for dauer formation

(although not recovery) in C. elegans [13,54], and the
TGF-β receptor ligand DAF-7 has been identified from A.
caninum [44]. Also, TGF-β signaling has been implicated
in the reactivation of tissue-arrested A. caninum L3 [55].
Demonstration of a functional role for Ac-FTT-2 in TGF-β
signaling awaits further characterization of this pathway
in hookworms.

development, and therefore might play an important role
in the hookworm infective process. Further investigations
into the role of FTT-2 and DAF-16 in hookworm recovery
will provide insights into the early, critical events of hookworm infection, and possibly novel intervention strategies for the prevention of hookworm disease.

Methods
The 14-3-3 proteins of platyhelminths are associated with
the tegument, or are actively secreted, making them available as targets of the host immune system and therefore
potential vaccine antigens [47,56]. In S. mansoni, all three
isoforms of 14-3-3 are expressed during infection and
induce antibody production by the host [57]. The 14-3-3ζ
isoform has shown some protection against schistosome
challenge infections, eliciting worm reductions ranging
from 25 to 65% [58-61]. The greatest success of a 14-3-3
as an anti-parasite vaccine antigen was in Echinococcus
multilocularis, where vaccination with the 14-3-3ζ isoform
resulted in a 97% reduction in parasite load following
challenge in a mouse [47,62]. Recombinant 14-3-3ζ
reduced nitric oxide production from activated macrophages in vitro [63], and may contribute to the immunosuppressive effect associated with alveolar cyst infection
[47,64].
The FTT-2 ortholog in the root-knot nematode M. incognita is synthesized in the dorsal esophageal gland cell and
present in stylet secretions [50,65]. In this parasite, stylet
secretions play a role in the induction and maintenance of
the feeding site within the plant host [66]. 14-3-3 proteins
in ESP suggest an extra-corporeal function, including
potentially influencing host immune responses [47,64].
Hookworms are known to release abundant ESP from
both activated L3 [4-6] and adult stages [41,42]. Minimally, release of 14-3-3 by a life history stage would be a
prerequisite for a vaccine antigen. However, we could not
demonstrate Ac-FTT-2 in either larval or adult ESP, indicating that unlike some other helminth 14-3-3 proteins,
Ac-FTT-2 is not secreted. Therefore it is unlikely that this
protein interacts with the host immune system. It is more
likely that it is part of endogenous signaling pathways,
including ILS downstream of Akt.

Parasites
The Baltimore strain of A. caninum (U.S. National Parasite
Collection accession 100655.00) was maintained in beagles as described previously [67]. The beagles were housed
and treated according to a protocol approved by the
George Washington University Institutional Care and Use
Committee. Infective L3 were recovered from coproculture by a modified Baermann technique and stored at
room temperature in buffer BU (50 mM Na2HPO4/22
mM KH2PO4/70 mM NaCL, pH 6.8) for up to one month
[68], or snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 C until
lysates were prepared.
In vitro larval activation and collection of excretory/
secretory products
Ancylostoma caninum L3 were activated under host-like
conditions as described previously [6]. Briefly, approximately 5000 decontaminated L3 were incubated at 37C,
5% CO2 for 24 hr in 0.5 ml RPMI1640 tissue culture
medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) and
antibiotics (RPMI-c) in individual wells of 24-well tissue
culture plates. L3 were activated by the addition of 10%
(v/v) of a less than 10 kDa ultrafiltrate of canine serum
and 15 mM S-methyl-glutathione (GSM, Sigma Chemical,
St. Louis, MO) in RPMI-c. Non-activated L3 were incubated with RPMI-c medium alone. The percentage of L3
feeding (or "activated") was determined as described elsewhere [2]

Following incubation, medium containing L3 was transferred to microcentifuge tubes and centrifuged at 13,000
rpm for 5 min. The supernatant containing the excretory/
secretory products (ESP) was collected and concentrated
by ultrafiltration using Centricon YM-10 cartridge (Millipore). The retentate was washed with 0.5 mL PBS, and
concentrated 10-fold for electrophoresis.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we report the identification and cloning of
a 14-3-3 protein family member, Ac-FTT-2, from the
canine hookworm A. caninum. Ac-FTT-2 is most closely
related to Ce-FTT-2, a protein that mediates the effects of
ILS in C. elegans. We demonstrated that Ac-FTT-2 interacts
with the forkhead transcription factor Ac-DAF-16 when
co-expressed in mammalian cells, and that this interaction requires intact Akt phosphorylation sites at serine
107 and threonine 312. Our data suggest that, as in C. elegans dauer recovery, the interaction of Ac-FTT-2 with
phosphorylated Ac-DAF-16 mediates the effects of ILS on

Ac-FTT-2 amplification and cloning
A consensus sequence derived from a cluster of eight
expressed sequence tags encoding an A. caninum 14-3-3
(AC01065) [69] was used to design specific forward and
reverse oligonucleotide primers for PCR. The Ac-ftt-2
cDNA ends were amplified in two separate PCR reactions.
For the 5' end, the reverse primer R2 (5'-AAATTGAGAGCGAGGCCAAGGCG-3'), the forward nematode
spliced leader primer SL (5'-GGTTTAATTACCCAAG TTTGAG-3') and first strand cDNA [70] were incubated in a
PCR reaction for 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 C, 1 min at 57 C,
Page 8 of 13

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:21

and 2 min at 72, followed by a final extension for 4 min
at 72 C.
The 3' end was isolated using a nested strategy from an A.
caninum L3 directional cDNA library constructed in
Lambda ZAP II [71]. The first reaction employed the forward
primer
FTT-F1
(5'-GAACTCGTGTTGAGGGCCAAGC-3') together with a primer complementary
to the T7 promoter site in the vector flanking the 3' end of
the cDNA insert site (5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3').
The primers and 1 μl of cDNA library were incubated in a
PCR reaction of 1 min at 94 C, 1 min at 55 C, and 2 min
at 72 C, and a final extension for 5 min at 72 C. The first
round reaction was diluted 1:10 and used as template in a
second reaction containing the nested forward primer
FTT-F2 (5'-CGAGCTGGAGAGTTATTT CGTCG-3') and
reverse
primer
T7-NEST
(5'-ACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTG-3'), using identical cycling conditions.
Amplicons of approximately 550 bp (5' end) and 900 bp
(3'end) were gel purified, cloned using the pGEM-T Easy
TA cloning kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and the DNA
sequence of both strands determined. The DNA sequences
of the 5' and 3' end clones were aligned and combined to
give the 1165-bp full-length composite sequence of Ac-ftt2, including a 32-bp poly-d(A) tail.
The composite sequence was used to design primers to
amplify and clone the full-length coding sequence. Forward primer FTT-FX (5'-TTAGGATCCATG GCCGAT
AACAAGGATGAACTCG-3') containing a 5'BamHI restriction site (underlined) and FTT-RX (5'-GATCTCGAGGAATCAGATCATA TGGGTTTAATTGGC-3') with a 5' XhoI
restriction site were incubated in a PCR with A. caninum
L3 first strand cDNA for 35 cycles of 95 C for 1 min, 55 C
for 1 min, and 72 C for 2 min, followed by a final 5 min
extension at 72 C. The amplicon was digested for 18 h at
37 C with 20 units each of XhoI and BamHI restriction
enzymes (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA) in BamHI
buffer, gel purified and ligated into pET28a (Novagen,
Gibbstown, NJ) which had been digested with the same
enzymes. The ligation products were transformed into E.
coli DH5α competent cells by standard methods, and the
constructs confirmed by DNA sequencing.
The full length coding sequence of A. caninum 14-3-3
cDNA (Ac-ftt-2) in pET28a was used as a template to
amplify the insert for subcloning into a mammalian
expression vector. Forward primer FTT-FX and reverse
primer FTT-RX2 (5'-ATAACTCGAGAT TGGCAC CCTCTCCTTGC-3') containing a XhoI site were incubated in a PCR
reaction with 12 ng of plasmid DNA for 35 cycles of 95 C
for 1 min, 55 C for 1 min, and 72 C for 2 min, followed
by a 5 min extension at 72 C. An amplicon of approximately 700 bp was purified by Nucleospin column (ClonTech, Palo Alto, CA), and 2.5 μg of the product digested

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/21

with XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes as above. The
gel purified insert was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5/His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
cut with the same enzymes, and the ligation products were
transformed as above. Positive colonies were confirmed
by colony PCR using FX and RX2 primers, and the DNA
sequence of both strands determined. All DNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (Nanodrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells
Growing human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells
were re-suspended in fresh, pre-warmed RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 2 mM
L-glutamine (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 100 IU/mL penicillin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), and evenly distributed
into individual wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate.
Medium was added to a final volume of 2 mL in each well
and the plate was incubated overnight at 37 C, 5% CO2.
The medium from each well was then replaced with fresh
pre-warmed RPMI without disturbing attached cells and
incubated for 2 h at 37 C. The cells were transfected with
4 μg of pcDNA3.1V5/Ac-ftt-2 plasmid DNA or empty
pcDNA3.1V5 vector (mock) using Metafectene (Bionex,
Munich) and incubated at 37°C for 48 h. Following incubation, media were removed and 2 mL of lysis buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM CHAPS, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) were added to each well to lyse
the cells. Cell lysates were vortexed for 1 minute in microcentrifuge tubes, then frozen overnight at -80 C. Samples
were thawed, vortexed again and centrifuged at room temperature for 5 min at 2300 × g. The supernatants were collected and stored at -20 C. Total protein concentrations
were determined by bicinchoninic acid method (Micro
BCA, Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Co-transfections were performed as above with 2 μg each
of pcDNA3.1V5/Ac-ftt-2 and pCMV4FLAG/Ac-daf-16
encoding the A. caninum forkhead transcription factor
DAF-16 [38], or 2 μg each of the expression constructs and
the corresponding empty vector. Cells were incubated
overnight, followed by 20% serum treatment for 24 h,
and lysates prepared.
Western Blot of HEK293 cell extracts
Western blotting with the specific anti-V5 antibody was
used to determine if recombinant Ac-FTT-2 (rFTT-2) was
expressed in HEK293 cells. Samples (16 μg of total protein) of mock and pcDNA3.1-V5-ftt-2 transfected cell
lysates were separated in a 4–20% gradient pre-cast Novex
Tris-glycine SDS polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for 110 min at 22 V by standard

methods [41]. Following transfer, the membrane was
blocked in 15 mL of 5% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) in PBST (0.05% Tween-20) overnight at 4 C. Membranes were
incubated with mouse anti-human 14-3-3β/HRP antibody (Santa Cruz Bioechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)
(1:20,000) or anti-V5/HRP mouse antibody (Invitrogen)
(1:5,000) in 1% NFDM in PBS-T for 2 h at 22 C. After 3 ×
10 min washes in PBS-T and 2 × 10 min washes in distilled water, the membrane was incubated in Enhanced
Chemoluminescence (ECL) solution (Thermo Fisher),
and chemoluminescent immunoreactive bands were
detected by exposure to radiographic film.
Immunoprecipitation of recombinant Ac-FTT from HEK
293 cell lysate
To determine if we could immunoprecipitate hookworm
recombinant Ac-FTT-2, 5 μL of anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) were incubated for 16 h at 4 C with lysates of mock
or Ac-ftt-2 transfected HEK 293 cells in a total volume of
500 μL of PBS-T (0.1% Tween-20). Protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) was pre-cleared with PBS-T and incubated with
the antibody-antigen complexes for 1.5 h at 22 C with
rotation. Following centrifugation for 30 s at 2300 × g, the
supernatant was removed and stored frozen as the
unbound sample, and the agarose complexes washed by
rotation 3 × 5 min with 1 mL PBS-T. The agarose-antibody-antigen complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE
and visualized by Western blot with HRP conjugated αhuman 14-3-3β antibody or α-V5/HRP as described
above.
Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with α-V5 and α-FLAG
using HEK293 cell lysates
HEK293 cells co-transfected with Ac-daf-16 and Ac-ftt-2
were lysed with 200 μL of cold buffer containing 50 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA,
1× Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail II (Calbiochem), and
1× Halt Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). Lysates were
centrifuged at 4 C for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the protein concentration of the supernatants determined by
Micro BCA. Forty μg of anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) was prepared according to manufacturer's
directions, added to ~1 mg of cell lysates, and mixed by
rotation overnight at 4 C. Tubes were centrifuged for 30 s
at 8200 × g and washed 3 times in TBS (50 mM Tris HCl
pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)
complexes were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE
and transferred to PVDF membrane for 7.5 min in an iBlot
apparatus (Invitrogen). Following blocking, the membrane was probed with anti-V5/HRP (1:5000 dilution) at
22 C for 2 h. The membrane was washed 3 times in PBST and 2 times in distilled deionized water (ddH2O), dried,
and incubated with ECL solution as above. Following visualization, the membrane was stripped with Restore
buffer (Pierce) and blocked overnight in 5% NFDM in

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/21

PBS-T at 4 C. The stripped membrane was re-probed with
a specific Ac-DAF-16 polyclonal antiserum (1:20,000
dilution) [38], and visualized as above. The reciprocal coIP was performed as above, using anti-V5 resin (Sigma) to
pull-down protein complexes, and anti-DAF-16/anti-rabbit IgG-HRP and anti-V5/HRP to probe the membranes.
Effect of phosphorylation on Ac-FTT-2 interaction with
Ac-DAF-16
To determine the importance of phosphorylation at the
predicted Akt phosphorylation sites for the interaction
between 14-3-3 and Ac-DAF-16, the serine or threonine
residue at each site was changed to alanine by site-directed
mutagenesis. Using a Quickchange Site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), mutant Ac-DAF-16
plasmids were constructed in which each site was mutated
separately (S107A, T312A, S381A), in pairs (S107A/
T312A; S107A/S381A; T312A/S381A), or at all three
phosphorylation sites (3A). The mutated plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

HEK293 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of
pcDNA3.1V5/Ac-ftt-2 and 2 μg of wild-type or mutant
pCMV4FLAG/Ac-daf-16 as above. Mock cells received 4 μg
of empty pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector. After 24 hrs incubation, the cells were fed with 20% serum and grown overnight. Following cell lysis, co-IPs were performed using
anti-FLAG agarose, separated by electrophoresis, and visualized by Western blot with anti-V5/HRP antibody as
above. After stripping, the gel was re-probed with DAF-16
antiserum to visualize Ac-DAF-16.
Preparation of lysates from frozen A. caninum L3 larvae
Ancylostoma caninum L3 were activated by incubating with
canine serum fractions and S-methylglutathione as
described above [6]. Approximately 100,000 frozen nonactivated and activated L3 A. caninum larvae were ground
to fine powder with a sterile mortar and pestle pre-chilled
with liquid N2. The powder was added to 500 μL of cold
PBS plus 1% EDTA, 1% Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail,
and 1% Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail II and mixed by
inversion. The lysates were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 6
min at 4 C. Aliquots of the supernatants were removed to
determine protein concentration by Micro BCA, and the
remaining supernatants were stored at -20 C until needed.
Secretion of Ac-FTT-2
To determine if Ac-FTT-2 was secreted during L3 activation, excretory/secretory products (ESP) from 6000 nonactivated and activated L3 were collected as described previously [6]. Adult A. caninum ESP, recombinant tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteases (Ac-TMP-1), and anti-TMP1 antisera were gifts of Dr. Bin Zhan. Adult ESP were collected following overnight incubation of adult worms in
vitro. Lysates (20 μg) of HEK293 cells expressing recom-

binant Ac-FTT-2, 80 ng of recombinant ASP-1 [5], and 130
ng of recombinant TMP-1 [42] were included as positive
controls. Samples were separated at 140 V, 40 mA for 1.5
h in a 4–20% gradient pre-cast Novex Tris-glycine SDS
polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen), and transferred to PVDF
membrane for 7.5 min in an iBlot apparatus (Invitrogen).
Blots were incubated with ASP-1 antiserum (1:4000),
TMP-1 antiserum (1:5000), or 14-3-3β antibody
(1:20,000), respectively, and visualized using ECL Plus as
described above.
Sequence Analysis
Dideoxy DNA sequencing using the ABI BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v3.1 was performed by
the Nevada Genomics Center [72], and the reactions run on
an ABI3730 DNA Analyzer. Sequence analysis was performed using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor version
5.0.9 [73], and multiple alignments performed using CLUSTAL W at Swiss EMBnet [74]. Neighbor-joining trees were
constructed using MEGA version 3.1 [75]. Homology
searches were done using BLASTP [35,76] at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information [77] and WU-BLAST
Parasite Genome Database Query at the European Bioinformatics Institute [78]. Percentage identity and similarity was
determined using the BLASTP algorithm with the
BLOSUM62 matrix. Conserved motifs were identified by
searching Scansite at MIT [79] using MotifScan software
[80], and nuclear export signals identified by searching the
NetNES 1.1 server [33,81] at the Center for Biological
Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark.
