The WTX/AMER1 gene family: evolution,
signature and function
Agnès Boutet1,2, Glenda Comai1,2, Andreas Schedl1,2*

Abstract
Background: WTX is a novel gene mutated in a proportion of Wilms’ tumors and in patients suffering from
sclerosing bone dysplasia. On the molecular level WTX has been shown to act as an antagonist of canonical Wnt/bcatenin signaling in fish and mammals thus linking it to an essential pathway involved in normal development and
cancer formation. Interestingly, WTX seems to also localize to an intranuclear component called paraspeckles. In spite
of the growing interest of molecular biologists in WTX, little is known about its paralogs and its phylogenetic history.
Results: Using the amino-acid sequence of WTX/AMER1 as a tool for the assignment of orthology and paralogy,
we here identify two novel proteins, AMER2 and AMER3, as “WTX“ related. This Amer gene family is present in all
currently available vertebrate genome sequences, but not invertebrate genomes and is characterized by six
conserved blocks of sequences. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the protoAmer gene originated early in the
vertebrate lineage and was then duplicated due to whole genome duplications (WGD) giving rise to the three
different Amer genes.
Conclusion: Our study represents the first phylogenetic analysis of Amer genes and reveals a new vertebrate
specific gene family that is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of this subphylum. Divergent
and conserved molecular functions of Wtx/Amer1, Amer2 and Amer3 are discussed.

Background
Early 2007, a search for genes deleted in Wilms’ tumors,
a pediatric solid tumor of the kidney led to the identification of the X-linked gene WTX (also called AMER1)
[1]. Using large-scale interactome mapping a second
independent study demonstrated that WTX induces
degradation of b-catenin via the proteasome system,
thus identifying this gene as an important modulator of
this crucial signaling pathway [2]. Wtx/Amer1 also physically interacts with APC [3], a tumor suppressor gene
involved in colorectal cancer [4]. In addition, on the cellular level WTX localizes to subnuclear domains that
have been identified as paraspeckles [5]. Recent analysis
suggests that WTX may also play an important function
during normal development: expression analysis demonstrated a dynamic expression pattern throughout embryogenesis [6] and mutations have been identified in
patients suffering from a range of developmental defects
including osteopathia striata congenita with cranial

sclerosis (OSCS) and cardiac anomalies [7]. To better
characterize the functional and structural properties of
the WTX/AMER1 gene it is essential to understand its
molecular evolution and its phylogenetic history. Duplications are common events during evolution and are
one of the main driving forces for the emergence of new
genes that can lead to the appearance of new gene
families. The aim of the present study was to identify
potential new members of the “WTX/AMER” family,
characterize their phylogenetic relationships and analyze
their evolutionary history.

Results and Discussion
Wtx/Amer1 is the founding member of a novel vertebrate
gene family

Using the WTX/AMER1 sequence as a bait for proteinprotein comparisons in the human genome, FAM123A
(AMER2) and FAM123C (AMER3) were identified as
two genes that share several domains of significant
sequence identity with WTX/AMER1 and are located in
chromosomes 13 and 2 respectively. Amer2 and Amer3
were also present in mouse mapping to chromosomes

14 and 1 respectively. Alignment of the mouse and
human sequences highlighted the presence of six highly
conserved blocks that we named B1 to B6 (Figure 1 and
additional file 1, Figure SM1). The mouse and human
AMER proteins are encoded by a single exon although
5’ untranslated sequences map to additional exons
(additional file 1, Figure SM1). In the case of WTX/
AMER1 additional splicing within the coding exon can
result in alternative protein variants [7]. These spliced
forms are detected after transient transfection of mouse
Wtx/Amer1 in human cells, but not in mouse embryos
from E9.5 to E14.5 dpc (Figure 2). Sequencing of RTPCR products from the embryonic samples indicated
the presence of a shorter transcript than expected for
Amer2 (Figure 2). This result showed that splicing leads
to an in-frame deletion of amino acids within the

Page 2 of 7

N-terminal region of Amer2. The existence of two variants for human AMER2 had already been reported by
Grohmann et al. (2007) [3] after in silico analysis. Alignment of the spliced form of Amer2 with the full-length
transcript revealed a splice site donor with an AG-GT
core sequence which is universally found at the exon/
intron junction. Sequence analysis localized this splice
site donor just after the conserved domain B2 (see
Figure 1). By contrast, Amer3 does not seem to undergo
splicing, as we detected only one long transcript by
RT-PCR both in mouse embryos and in transiently
transfected cells with mouse Amer3 (Figure 2).
To further investigate the evolutionary origin and phylogenetic distribution of the Amer genes, we extended
the in silico searches to other available genomic databases. We could identify orthologs of Wtx/Amer1,

internal splicing sites (donor and acceptor), the phospholipid binding activity and the b-catenin binding region. Note that B2 partially overlaps
with the NLS in human WTX/AMER1. In contrast, only the splicing acceptor is located in a conserved domain (B3). The conserved consensus
sequences of domain B1 to B6 are depicted in Figure SM1 B (additional file 1).

Figure 2 Alternative splicing of Amer transcripts. RT-PCR of the N-terminus of Amer transcripts performed from E9.5 to E14.5 mouse embryos
and HEK293T cells transfected with Wtx/Amer1 (HEK-A1), Amer2 (HEK-A2) or Amer3 (HEK-A3). Two RNA products are detectable by RT-PCR after
transfection of HEK293T cells with mouse Wtx/Amer1 as previously reported [5] (right gel in the Wtx/Amer1 box). By contrast, a single band
corresponding to the full-length transcript is detected in mouse embryos suggesting that regulation of splicing may be cell type dependent (left
gel). For Amer2, only one transcript is detected endogenously in mouse embryos and after transfection of HEK293T cells. Nucleotide sequence
analysis revealed a 357-bp (119 amino acids) deletion and indicated that Amer2 mRNA is produced by alternative splicing in the 5’ end of exon
1. For Amer3, a single band corresponding to the full-length transcript is detected either in mouse embryos or after transfection of HEK293T
cells. Results have been obtained with three different primer pairs for each Amer gene. RT: RNA samples incubated with reverse transcriptase;
control: RNA samples incubated without reverse transcriptase as a DNA contamination control.

Amer2 and Amer3 in primates (i.e. Pan troglodyte), and
all other studied mammals (i.e. Canis familiaris), including the most basal therian groups, xenarthra (i.e. Dasypus novemcinctus), marsupials (i.e. Monodelphis
domestica) and monotremes (i.e. Ornithorhynchus anatinus). The three Amer genes were also present in other
tetrapod species such as birds (i.e. Gallus gallus), amphibians (i.e. Xenopus tropicalis) and in actinopterygians (i.
e. the teleost fish Danio rerio) (for a complete list of
orthologs see additional file 2; Table S1). We were
unable to find any ortholog in cyclostome genomes such
as the lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), but this is probably due to the fact that this genome has not yet been
completely sequenced and assembled.
In stark contrast to their presence in apparently all
vertebrates, no Amer genes could be identified in the
genomes of model invertebrates including flies or nematodes and other protostomes such as mollusks (Lottia
gigantea) and annelids (Capitella capitata). A similar
situation already exists for other Wnt signaling components such as the Dkk family, which was believed to be
vertebrate specific [8]. More recently, however, Dkk
genes have been described in the diploblastic hydra and
sea anemone [9]. It has, therefore, been postulated that
gene families are missing in model protostomes due to
the fast evolutionary rates and rampant gene loss in
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes [10].
To test whether a similar situation may exist for the
Amer gene family, we searched for Amer orthologs in a
wide range of metazoans, from the most basal (cnidarians and placozoans) to the vertebrates’ closest relatives.
No hits in any of the analyzed genomes could be
detected, not even in non-vertebrate chordates (i.e.

Branchiostoma floridae, Ciona intestinalis) and other
non-vertebrate deuterostomes such as sea urchin
(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) despite the low occurrence of gene loss in some of these species [11].
Although we cannot rule out the possibility that Amerrelated genes are present in some of these species, but
have diverged beyond recognition, our data strongly
suggest that this gene family is vertebrate specific. While
the six conserved blocks of sequences found in the
human and mouse proteins are present in all the vertebrate orthologs (Figure 1 and additional file 1, Figure
SM1), PROSITE analysis did not identify protein
domains of known function (additional file 1, Figure
SM2). Taken together, our data support the common
origin of the three genes, which seemed to have arisen
at the time of the origin of vertebrates.
Phylogenetic relationship of Wtx/Amer1, Amer2 and
Amer3

To analyze in more detail the evolutionary history of the
Amer gene family we constructed a phylogenetic tree
using the protein sequences identified above. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Wtx/Amer1, Amer2 and
Amer3 form three independent groups in each class of
vertebrate species from fish to placental mammals
(Figure 3A). Among the three genes Wtx/Amer1 and
Amer2 show a higher extent of sequence similarity (see
similarity percentage Figure 3B). In all the species analyzed, the three genes are located on three different
chromosomes suggesting that they evolved by genome
duplications rather than tandem duplication events
(additional file 1, Figure SM3). If Wtx/Amer1, Amer2
and Amer3 genes arise from a common ancestor, one

should expect to find them in the vicinity of a common
gene family. Schematic representation of chromosomal
locations for each gene is given in Figure SM3 (additional file 1). The following genes were found in syntenic position with Wtx/Amer1, Amer2 and Amer3:
MTMR6/8 (myotubulin related protein 6/8) and ARHGEF4/9 (cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) 4/9). In Drosophila the ortholog for both

Page 4 of 7

MTMR6 and MTMR8, is the gene (CG3530) located on
chromosome 2R. Similarly, the ortholog for ARHGEF4
and ARHGEF9 is RhoGEF3, a gene located on the Drosophila chromosome 3L (additional file 1, Figure SM3).
At those two putative syntenic regions, we could not
find any gene with significant level of sequence conservation to the Amer gene family. More precisely none of
the six conserved sequence blocks could be found in the
genes neighbouring CG3530 or RhoGEF3. The fact that
ARHGEF4/9 is a neighbour of both Wtx/Amer1 and
Amer3 and that MTMR6/8 neighbours both Wtx/Amer1
and Amer2 suggested that the ancestors of these two
gene families (ARHGEF and MTMR) were located close
to each other early in the vertebrate lineage (additional
file 1, Figure SM4). This suggests a loss of paralogs after
or between the two rounds of complete duplication in
vertebrates (additional file 1, Figure SM4). Based on our
analysis, we propose an evolutionary model (additional
file 1, Figure SM4) that is consistent with the two
rounds of complete genome duplication in vertebrates
[12]. In our model, a putative Amer4 gene may have
been lost after duplication and the presence of a “protoAmer” at the basis of the vertebrate lineage would
represent the ancestral vertebrate condition preceding
the gene split into Amer1/2 and Amer3/4 (additional file
1, Figure SM4). Surprisingly, the ortholog distribution of
Wtx/Amer1, Amer2 and Amer3 in teleosts does not
reflect the additional round of genome duplication that
occurred in these species (Figure 3A). A secondary loss
of the duplicated genes can explain the present situation. Analysis of the degree of identical residues between
human and zebrafish Amer gene products shows that it
is relatively conserved (additional file 3, Figure SM5). In
addition, residues showing a high degree of similarity
after multiple alignment of Amer proteins from human
and zebrafish correspond to the specific conserved
domains found in Amer proteins (Block B1 to B6,
Figure 1; additional file 1, Figure SM1).
The radial phylogenetic tree (additional file 3, Figure
SM6) confirmed the subdivision of the three genes into
three different groups.
Divergent and conserved molecular functions of
Wtx/Amer1 genes

As noted by François Jacob in 1977, it is at the molecular level that the tinkering aspect of evolution becomes
most apparent [13]. Even when gene families evolve by
duplication, their members can undergo significant
changes leading to structural and functional diversity.
According to this view, the protoAmer gene may have
encoded a short protein to which the highly divergent
C-terminal half of WTX/AMER1 and AMER3 might
have been added at a later time point during evolution
(Figure 1). This C-terminal part of the WTX/AMER1

Boutet et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:280
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/280

protein is of importance as it has been demonstrated to
be involved in the degradation of the Wnt signaling
pathway effector b-catenin [2]. According to the primary
structure we expect that Amer2 and Amer3 are unable
to inhibit b-catenin activity. Indeed, Amer2 failed to
counteract b-catenin activation in an in vitro reporter
system (Figure 4). While Wtx/Amer1 and Amer3 are
both long proteins, their C terminal half lacks significant
sequence identity and our phylogenetic analysis places
the two genes into two different groups (see radial phylogenetic tree and cladogramme). Functional experiments revealed that Amer3 was also unable to decrease
b-catenin dependent gene activation (Figure 4). Taken
together these data indicate that Wtx/Amer1 might have
been co-opted to interact with b-catenin. While addition
of the b-catenin interaction domain to Wtx/Amer1
seems to be the most likely scenario, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of a functional loss of this
capability in Amer2 and 3 proteins. In contrast, the
function of the Amer gene family as proteins that recruit
APC to the membrane might be conserved, as both
WTX/AMER1 and AMER2 possess sequences that allow
the molecular interaction with APC (Figure 1; [3]). The
APC interacting domains overlap four of the six conserved blocks (Figure 1) indicating that AMER3 might
also be involved in APC shuttling. If so, it seems that
the ability to recruit APC is one of the ancestral functions of the Amer family.

Conclusion
In this study we reported the first phylogenetic analysis
of the Amer gene family and identify Amer3 as a novel
family member. The common ancestry of the three
Amer genes is supported by the presence of six conserved sequence blocks in all the orthologs, as well as
the syntenic conservation with NTMR and ARHGEF
paralogs in their three genomic loci. The absence of any
sequence similarity to Amer genes in invertebrate genomes and the presence of three Amer paralogs in all
studied vertebrate species strongly support the hypothesis that these genes are novel inventions that originated
early in vertebrate evolution. Additional functional studies using animal models misexpressing Amer2 and
Amer3 or knock out alleles will be required to determine their exact function in embryogenesis. Given the
importance of Wtx/Amer1 in normal development and
its involvement in human pathologies, it is tempting to
speculate that mutations in Amer2 and Amer3 may also
underlie developmental disorders.
Methods
Database search and sequence queries

Search for Amer homologous proteins in vertebrates
was made through the NCBI and Ensembl (http://www.
ensembl.org; release 56, september 2009) protein databases (see the complete list in additional file 2; Table
S1). In silico proteins were obtained using GenomeScan
software (http://genes.mit.edu/genomescan.html). In
order to find potential orthologs in invertebrate

together with a luciferase reporter gene (TOP-flash) into HEK293T cells are shown. The TOP-FLASH construct is designed to measure
transcriptional activation mediated by b-catenin. As previously reported, WTX/AMER1 acts as a negative regulator of b-catenin activity. In
contrast, AMER2 and AMER3 do not interfere with b-catenin dependent activation of the TOP-flash reporter gene. Luciferase values were
normalized to b-galactosidase. Data are the average of two independent experiments ± SEM. *p ≤ 0.01.

genomes, mouse Wtx/Amer1, Amer2 and Amer3 were
blasted against the amphioxus (http://genome.jgi-psf.
org/Brafl1/Brafl1.home.html), the sea urchin (http://
www.spbase.org/SpBase/) the sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis, http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Nemve1/
Nemve1.home.html), annelid (Lottia gigantea, http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/Lotgi1/Lotgi1.home.html), mollusk
(Capitella capitata, http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Capca1/

genomes using tblastn under unrestrictive conditions
(e-value = 100). No hits were found. The absence of
Wtx/Amer1 from the Drosophila genome has been previously reported [1].
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Amino acid sequences of Wtx/Amer1, Amer2, Amer3
were aligned using Clustal W [14] and manually corrected with BioEdit [14,15]. Bayesian Inference trees
were performed using MrBayes 3.1.2 [16,17] with the
model recommended by ProTest 1.4 [18] under the
Akaike information and the Bayesian information criterions. We used the JTT + I + G model for both trees.
Convergence was reached when the value for the standard deviation of split frequencies stayed below 0.01.
Burn-in was determined by plotting parameters across
all runs for both analysis: all trees prior to convergence
were discarded and consensus trees were calculated for
the remaining trees. We used one MrBayes run of
1,000,000 generations and 453,000 generation burn-in
for the tree presented in Figure 3A and one MrBayes
run of 2,000,000 generations and 1,893,000 generation
burn-in for the tree presented in Figure SM6 (additional
file 3). The trees were viewed and edited with the
TreeExplorer programme in MEGA 4.0 [19]. Maximum
likelihood analysis was conducted using RAxML version
7.0.3 [20] using a JTT model of evolution, 1000 bootstrap replicates and the rapid bootstrapping algorithm.
The phylogenetic tree obtained using ML is consistent
with the one obtained by Bayesian inference (data not
shown). Alignment files used to calculate the phylogenetic trees are presented in Figure SM7 and SM8 (additional file 4 and 5 respectively).
Plasmids

The plasmid expressing human b-catenin was kindly
provided by Jurgen Behrens (University of Erlangen,
Germany). The TOP-FLASH and FOP-FLASH luciferase
reporter constructs have been described previously [21].
Briefly, the TOP-FLASH construct is designed to measure transcriptional activation mediated by b-catenin
and FOP-FLASH is the mutated counterpart of the

Page 6 of 7

TOP-FLASH plasmid. Mouse Wtx/Amer1, Amer2 and
Amer3 expression plasmids were obtained by PCR
amplification of the coding sequence from BAC constructs (bMQ-277D5 for Wtx/Amer1, bMQ-344G22 for
Amer2 and bMQ-123E19 for Amer3) (Geneservice,
Cambridge, UK)) and insertion into the pAcGFP1-C1
plasmid (Clontech). All constructs were verified by
DNA sequencing.
Detection of Wtx/Amer1 and Amer2 variants by RT-PCR

Total RNA from E9.5 to E14.5 dpc mouse embryos or
Wtx/Amer1, Amer2 or Amer3 transfected HEK293T
cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
and RNA purification was performed using the RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen) and Rnase-free DNAse digestion
(Qiagen). cDNA were synthesized from 1 μg of RNA
using the MMLV reverse transcriptase system and
random hexamers (Invitrogen). All PCR assays were
performed using the GoTaq® Green Mix for PCR (Promega). Amplification of the N-terminus of Wtx/
Amer1, Amer2 and Amer3 was performed using three
different pairs of primers for each gene. Primer
sequences used in Figure 2 are as follows: Wtx/Amer1,
foward: tgaggcaacagaaggacca, reverse: tggagagtcaacaggatgaagctgttcaa; Amer2, foward: atggactcgcattgtgagtgcg,
reverse: cgagctcccatctgcaaa; Amer3, foward: gaggagaggaaagaccttcatc, reverse: tcccagaacttgttgaagtctg. The
other primer pairs used in this assay are available on
demand. Briefly, all forward primers were located in
the non-coding exon 1 or at the 5’ end of exon 2 and
all reverse primers just downstream of the internal
splicing acceptor. PCR products were sequenced (SeqLAB, Sequence Laboratories, Göttingen, Germany) to
check the specificity of Amer variants.
Reporter assay

HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, in a 5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected
with the TOP-FLASH reporter or its mutated counterpart (FOP-FLASH) and b-catenin with either Wtx/
Amer1, Amer2 and Amer3 expression plasmids (200 ng
each). Cells were also co-transfected with 50 ng of CMV
(cytomegalovirus)-b-galactosidase as an internal control.
Transient transfection of expression plasmids was performed with Fugene according to manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). After 36 h, luciferase activity was
measured according to the Luciferase Assay System
(Promega) and data were normalized to b-galactosidase
activity and plotted. Luciferase activities obtained after
transfection with the FOP-FLASH construct are not
shown as they were close to zero for each condition.
