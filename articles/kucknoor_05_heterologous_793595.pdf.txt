Abstract
Background: Trichomonosis, caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, is the number one, nonviral sexually
transmitted infection that has adverse consequences for the health of women and children. The
interaction of T. vaginalis with vaginal epithelial cells (VECs), a step preparatory to infection, is
mediated in part by the prominent surface protein AP65. The bovine trichomonad, Tritrichomonas
foetus, adheres poorly to human VECs. Thus, we established a transfection system for heterologous
expression of the T. vaginalis AP65 in T. foetus, as an alternative approach to confirm adhesin
function for this virulence factor.
Results: In this study, we show stable transfection and expression of the T. vaginalis ap65 gene in
T. foetus from an episomal pBS-ap65-neo plasmid. Expression of the gene and protein was confirmed
by RT-PCR and immunoblots, respectively. AP65 in transformed T. foetus bound to host cells.
Specific mAbs revealed episomally-expressed AP65 targeted to the parasite surface and
hydrogenosome organelles. Importantly, surface-expression of AP65 in T. foetus paralleled
increased levels of adherence of transfected bovine trichomonads to human VECs.
Conclusion: The T. vaginalis AP65 adhesin was stably expressed in T. foetus, and the data obtained
using this heterologous system strongly supports the role of AP65 as a prominent adhesin for T.
vaginalis. In addition, the heterologous expression in T. foetus of a T. vaginalis gene offers an
important, new approach for confirming and characterizing virulence factors.

Background
The colonization of the urogenital tract of humans by the
protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for
trichomonosis [1], the most prevalent, non-viral sexually
transmitted infection worldwide. Despite an estimated 8
million new cases per year in the United States alone [2],
this health disparities disease [3] remains poorly studied.
T. vaginalis infection is associated with adverse health consequences to both men and women, including infertility
[4,5], atypical pelvic inflammatory disease [6], and

increased HIV transmission [7,8]. Trichomonosis is also
associated with preterm birth, low birth weight infants
[9], predisposition to development of cervical neoplasia
[10] in women and non-gonococcal urethritis [11] and
chronic prostatitis [12] in men. T. vaginalis adherence to
host VECs, a step preparatory to infection [13], is complex
and involves four surface protein adhesins. Three adhesins studied to date at the molecular level share identity
with metabolic enzymes of the hydrogenosome organelle
[14,15]. Thus, the proteins exhibit functional diversity

based on cellular location. AP65 is a prominent T. vaginalis adhesin that is targeted both to the surface and hydrogenosomes, and this compartmentalization is in part
modulated by iron [15]. Further, the surface placement of
AP65 is increased upon contact with host cells [15].
Recently, silencing of ap65 gene expression in T. vaginalis
with antisense reinforced the role of AP65 as a major
adhesion [16].
The related Tritrichomonas foetus is a causal agent of bovine
fetal wastage [17,18]. Adherence by T. foetus to bovine
VECs appears equally complex as that seen for T. vaginalis
except that in this case, adherence involves glycoconjugates [19,20]. Interestingly, the interaction between T. foetus organisms and VECs is both cell- and species-specific
[21,22]. For example, T. foetus attaches to bovine VECs,
MDCK and HeLa epithelial cells, which have been used
previously for studies on the host-parasite interaction.
However, the bovine trichomonads have low background
levels of adherence to human VECs. This may suggest that
the phylogenetically-related T. vaginalis and T. foetus trichomonads differ in mechanisms of host parasitism and
cytopathogenicity. We hypothesized that, given the different mechanisms of host VEC adherence by T. foetus and T.
vaginalis, the heterologous expression in T. foetus of the T.
vaginalis AP65 could be an alternative approach to confirm the function of AP65 as an adhesin.
Importantly, no cross-hybridization and immuno-crossreactivity with ap65 and mAbs to AP65, respectively, were
evident in T. foetus. We now show the stable expression in
T. foetus of a single copy of the T. vaginalis ap65 gene
encoding an ~65-kDa protein [23]. The stable transfectants expressed functional AP65 on the T. foetus surface.
These findings importantly illustrate the utility of a stable
transfection system for heterologus expression in T. foetus
of T. vaginalis virulence genes.

Results
Low levels of adherence to immortalized human MS-74
VECs and lack of ap65 by T. foetus
We wanted to perform comparative binding experiments
between T. vaginalis and T. foetus to epithelial cells used in
adherence assays [15]. Given the fact that T. foetus exhibits
host tissue- and cell-specificity [24], it was not surprising
to find the lower levels of adherence by T. foetus to HeLa
epithelial cells and immortalized human MS-74 VECs. As
shown in representative experiment in Figure 1, at best
only 40% levels of adherence were seen for T. foetus compared to T. vaginalis.

We next wanted to know if T. foetus had mRNA that
hybridized to ap65 used as a probe. As shown in Figure 1B,
no RNA band was detected by Northern analysis for T. foetus (lane labeled Tf). In contrast, a band of ~2-kb was read-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/5

ily hybridized by total RNA of T. vaginalis. MR100, the
drug-resistant T. vaginalis that is unable to adhere to host
cells as shown recently also had no detectable ap65 transcript, as a control [15]. The equivalent amounts of rRNA
bands seen in Figure 1C illustrate that similar amounts of
RNA were added to the lanes used in the Northern blots
(Figure 1B).
Episomal expression in T. foetus of ap65
The expression plasmid pBS-ap65-neo contains the neomycin (neo) gene, and as done recently, the transfectants
were selected for Geneticin resistance at 100µg/ml [16]. As
shown in Figure 2A, the presence of plasmid in transfectants was verified by PCR amplification of the neo coding
region. A band of 750-bp was detected in the transfectants
corresponding to pBS-ap65-neo (lane3) and pBS-neo (lane
4). Not unexpectedly, no PCR products were obtained
using T. vaginalis (lane 1) and T. foetus (lane 2).

We then checked for the episomal gene expression by
means of RT-PCR. The PCR products following reverse
transcription were separated on 1% agarose gels. Figure
2B confirms the presence of an ap65 band corresponding
to 580-bp amplified from the transfectants with pBSap65-neo (lane 3), confirming the expression of ap65 from
the plasmid. The same band is also seen in T. vaginalis
(lane 1). As an internal control in these experiments, the
common band of 650-bp seen in all lanes corresponds to
the a-tubulin gene. This control was important to show the
similar amounts of RNA used for RT-PCR in all samples.
These results demonstrate that the episomal plasmid with
the T. vaginalis ap65 gene is successfully expressed in transfected T. foetus.
T. vaginalis AP65 and AP65-HA are expressed in T.
foetus, and episomal AP65 has function
We next wanted to confirm that the episomal ap65 transcript seen in Figure 2 was translated. A 65-kDa band was
readily detected by mAb 12G4 to AP65 in immunoblots
of extracts of total proteins from T. foetus transfected with
pBS neo-ap65 (Figure 3A, lane 2), and the protein had the
same size as AP65 detected in total protein blots of T. vaginalis (lane 4). There were no detectable bands in either
wild type T. foetus (lane 1) or T. foetus transfected with the
control plasmid (lane 3). This result also confirms that the
12G4 mAb did not cross-react with any protein in blots of
T. foetus.

Importantly, we further tested for the ability of episomal
AP65 in T. foetus to bind to host cells using a ligand assay
[15,25]. Figure 3B (lane 4) shows a typical result of a ligand assay using T. vaginalis, and mAb 12G4 used as a
probe detected AP65 on blots of proteins that bound MS74 VECs that were solubilized for electrophoresis and
blotting. Likewise, AP65 from transfected parasites bound

Adherence levels of T. vaginalis (open bars) were normalized to 100% for comparative purposes. (B) Northern analysis to
detect ap65 mRNA amounts was performed using 10 µg of total RNA per lane separated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels
and transferred to Hybond-P membranes. The blot was probed with DIG-labelled ap65, which hybridized to an ~2-kb ap65
transcript in T. vaginalis, as before [16]. No similar signal was detected in T. foetus and the drug resistant MR100 T. vaginalis used
as a negative control [15]. (C) Ethidium bromide (EtBr)-stained RNA gel showing the rRNA bands. Equal loading of RNA in all
the lanes is evident by similar amounts of the rRNA bands, which served as internal controls for the Northern blot in part B.

of the a-tubulin gene used as an internal control.

was detected in wt T. foetus (lane 1) and T. foetus transfected with the control plasmid (lane 3).

in T. foetus transfectants localized to the surface membranes. Fractions enriched for membranes and hydrogenosome organelles were obtained by differential
centrifugation, and the fractions were used for monitoring
the presence of AP65 using a ligand assay. Figure 4A illustrates AP65 detected by mAb 12G4 in blots of total proteins from membranes and hydrogenosomes of T.
vaginalis (lanes 2 and 5) and T. foetus transfected with the
pBS-ap65-neo plasmid (lanes 3 and 6). As above, no bands
were visualized on blots with total proteins of wild type T.
foetus (lanes 1 and 4). We then used these fractions to perform a ligand assay, and as seen in Figure. 4B, both membrane and hydrogenosome fractions of T. vaginalis (lanes
2 and 5) and transfected T. foetus (lanes 3 and 6) had AP65
that bound to MS-74 VECs. Wild type T. foetus had no protein detected by mAb from the ligand assay (lanes 1 and
4).

There were no detectable protein bands for wild-type T.
foetus (lane 1) and T. foetus transfected with control plasmid (lane 3) handled identically in the ligand assay. These
results show the ability of T. foetus transfectants to stably
express functional AP65. Further, the lack of any
immuno-crossreactivity with mAb is consistent with the
absence of transcript (Figure 1B) and illustrates the
absence of an AP65-like protein reactive with mAbs in T.
foetus.
AP65 expressed in T. foetus is compartmentalized to the
surface and hydrogenosomes
Next, we performed cell membrane fractionation experiments to determine whether episomally-expressed AP65

Immunofluorescence detects AP65 in transfectants on the
surface and in hydrogenosomes
It was then important to examine the possible placement
and accessibility of episomal AP65 on the surface of T. foetus. Figure 5 presents immunofluorescence data with T.
vaginalis showing mAb 12G4 detecting surface AP65 (A4)
and mAb F11 reacting with hydrogenosomal AP65 (decarboxylating malic enzyme) (B4), data consistent with that
shown in a recent report by us [16]. Importantly, as with
the fractionation experiments performed above, mAb
12G4 detected AP65 on the surface of non-permeabilized
transfected T. foetus (Figure 5A2), and mAb F11 was reactive with AP65 within hydrogenosomes of permeabilized
trichomonads (Figure 5B2). The absence of any fluorescence for wild type T. foetus (A1 and B1) and T. foetus with
control plasmid (A3 and B3) reinforced the specific binding of mAbs with episomal AP65 and reaffirmed results
from Figures 3 and 4 above. The brightfield pictures are
included to show the integrity of the trichomonads in the
fluorescence experiments. These data further confirm that
episomal AP65 is sorted both to the parasite surface and
to hydrogenosome organelles, suggesting that the
trafficking signals are present within the AP65 open reading frame and that T. foetus also possesses the protein
compartmentalization machinery similar to that of T.
vaginalis.
Episomal expression of fusion AP65-HA and sorting to the
parasite surface
Having established surface AP65 on transfected T. foetus,
we next wanted to confirm surface placement using a different protein construct that would be detected by a distinct mAb. We, therefore, expressed the AP65-HA fusion
protein, and immunoblot of total proteins of transfected
T. foetus shows a band detected by the anti-HA mAb (Figure 6A, lane 5). As expected, the mAb 12G4 to AP65
detected a protein band in blots of total proteins of T. vag-

and F11 for hydrogenosome fluorescence shown recently to detect the protein in respective compartments (Garcia et al.,

recently (Garcia et al., 2003). No evidence of fluorescence was seen for wild type T. foetus (Tf) and for T. foetus transfected
with control plasmid (Tf-pBS-neo). Control hybridoma supernatant lacking anti-AP65 mAb was unreactive with trichomonads.

through 3) and anti-HA mAb (lanes 4 through 6). AP65 was readily detected by 12G4 in blots of T. vaginalis (lane 1) and T. foetus transfected with pBS-ap65-HA-neo (lane 2) but not T. foetus with control plasmid (lane 3). The anti-HA mAb detected the
AP65-HA protein only in T. foetus transfected with pBS-ap65-HA-neo (lane 5). No protein was detectable by anti-HA mAb in
blots of control T. vaginalis (lane 4) and T. foetus with the pBS-neo plasmid (lane 6). As an additional negative control for all
immunoblots, no protein was detected in the absence of primary antibody or using control hybridoma supernatant. (B) Fluorescence is visualized using anti-HA mAb only in the T. foetus organisms transfected with the pBS-ap65-HA-neo plasmid but not
the pBS-neo plasmid. Not unexpectedly, no fluorescence was seen using anti-HA mAb with T. foetus and with the use of control
hybridoma supernatant lacking mAb to AP65. Finally, no fluorescence with anti-HA mAb was obtained using T. vaginalis organisms under identical experimental conditions.

inalis (lane 1) and the pBS-ap65-HA-neo transfected T. foetus (lane 2). The Mr of the fusion protein was higher than
AP65, as expected. Also, no bands were apparent with any
mAbs in T. foetus with control pBS-neo plasmid (lanes 3
and 6).
Finally, as shown in Figure 6B, immunofluorescence
microscopy gave a positive reaction with anti-HA mAb
with AP65-HA protein on the surface using non-permeabilized and in hydrogenosomes with permeabilized transfected (Tf-pBS-ap65-neo) trichomonads. The T. foetus
transfected with the control plasmid (Tf-pBS-neo) was
unreactive with anti-HA mAb and gave results identical to
those shown for the wild type T. foetus. Finally, in data not
shown, no fluorescence with anti-HA mAb was obtained
using T. vaginalis organisms as controls under identical
experimental conditions. These data using a different
mAb to the fusion protein construct independently demonstrated the surface placement of episomal AP65 and
AP65-HA on T. foetus.
Episomally-expressed AP65 in T. foetus is related to
enhanced adherence to VECs
Finally, we wanted to perform a functional adherence
assay to determine if episomal, surface-expressed and host
cell-binding AP65 on T. foetus, as shown collectively
above, would enhance adherence of parasites to immortalized human MS-74 VECs. Figure 7 presents representative data showing that transfected parasites with pBSap65-neo were 40% more adherent to VECs when compared to the background level of adherence of wild type T.
foetus (Tf). T. foetus with control plasmid gave lower
adherence levels equal to wild type parasites (not shown).
Importantly, the enhanced adherence was inhibited by 36
% in the presence of rabbit polyclonal anti-AP65 IgG antibody (striped bar), indicating specific AP65-mediated
adherence, as before for T. vaginalis [15,16]. Control normal rabbit serum IgG did not inhibit adherence of the
pBS-ap65-neo transfected T. foetus (shaded bar). Levels of
adherence were compared with those of T. vaginalis (Tv)
and normalized to 100%.

Discussion
We have shown that trichomonads possess surface adhesins with functional diversity [26]. The adhesins are also
enzymes in hydrogenosome organelles involved in energy
generation. Although complex and multifactorial, the
process of T. vaginalis adherence to human VECs is mediated in part by AP65, the surface protein that plays a major
role in adherence [15,16]. In this study, we established the
utility of the T. foetus bovine trichomonad as a heterologous expression model system. We feel that among the
noteworthy findings of this report are the following: 1)
We show the stable episomal expression of the T. vaginalis
prominent ap65 gene (Figure 2). 2) The transcript is trans-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/5

lated to form functional AP65 adhesin (Figure 3). 3) Episomal AP65 and fusion AP65-HA are compartmentalized
to the surface and hydrogenosomes and are accessible to
recognition by specific anti-AP65 and anti-HA mAbs (Figures 4 through 6). 4) AP65 on transfected T. foetus
increased adherence to VECs compared to parasites transfected with control plasmid (Figure 7), and the enhanced
binding was reduced with anti-AP65 antibodies, showing
specific AP65 mediated VEC attachment.
The stable expression of T. vaginalis AP65 in transfected T.
foetus allowed us to characterize via cell fractionation
experiments the cellular location of the episomal protein.
Remarkably, AP65 fractionated to the plasma membrane
and hydrogenosomes (Figure 4). This fractionation data
was reaffirmed by fluorescence experiments (Figure 5),
and the ability to detect both surface AP65 and surface
AP65-HA using distinct mAbs provides strong evidence
for the trafficking of T. vaginalis proteins to distinct cellular compartments in the bovine trichomonad. These
results indicate that machinery for recognition of the surface and organelle targeting sequences is similar among
these phylogenetically-related trichomonad species.
Importantly, the expression of AP65-HA now will permit
future subclone analysis for identification of the protein
region within AP65 directing surface channeling.
That surface AP65 on transfected T. foetus elevated levels
of adherence to human VECs (Figure 7) is significant
because human VECs are not the natural host cell for T.
foetus [27,28]. The net increase in binding levels above T.
foetus wild type controls were specific, as evidenced by the
fact that anti-AP65 IgG reduced adherence to original control values. It is not inconceivable that the experimental
conditions used here would not increase adherence by
transfected T. foetus to those seen by T. vaginalis. One possible explanation is the fact that efficient and optimal
adherence to VECs requires at least three additional
adhesins, something that has been experimentally verified
[15,16]. Alternatively, the copy number of episomal AP65
on T. foetus may not be optimal for production of
amounts of adhesin needed for elevated adherence levels.
Such a difference in copy number between AP65 on T.
vaginalis and T. foetus (Fig. 3) may not be obvious based
solely on fluorescence intensity, as this is not quantitative.
In this regard, it may be that the equivalent protein of T.
foetus decarboxylating malic enzyme is also surface
expressed thereby interfering with sequestration of sufficient molecules of episomal AP65 for adherence. The
future availability of specific antibodies to the T. foetus
decarboxylating malic enzyme will be useful for testing
this possibility. It is noteworthy that the ap65 gene and
mAbs to AP65 did not cross-hybridize and immunoreact,
respectively, with the equivalent decarboxylating malic
enzyme gene and protein known to reside in hydrogeno-

T. foetus transfected with pBS-ap65-neo (Tf-pBS-ap65-neo) displays enhanced levels of adherence to immortalized human MS-74 VECs compared to T. foetus (Tf) parasites. The percent level of adherence was adjusted with that

somes of T. foetus [29,30]. These data also now indicate
that there is significant nucleotide and amino acid
sequence divergence between T. vaginalis and T. foetus in
these equivalent genes and proteins. Importantly, except
for the N-terminal sequence submitted to the GenBank
(Accession number AAK55143.1), to our knowledge the
entire decarboxylating malic enzyme gene of T. foetus has
not been characterized [31]. Finally, not all episomal, surface-expressed AP65 molecules may be in the proper orientation to have adhesive function. Nonetheless, the
significant increase in adherence attributable to episomal
AP65 by transfected T. foetus once again underscores the
role of AP65 in adherence by T. vaginalis.

This paper now provides evidence for the functional
expression of a heterologous virulence factor in a related
trichomonad species. This ability to express T. vaginalis or
other foreign proteins using T. foetus as a model is particularly noteworthy, especially if an identical and/or equivalent virulence factor and property are not detectable
within the bovine trichomonad. We feel that this
approach is innovative and represents a significant
advance for understanding the contribution of specific T.
vaginalis virulence factors to overall mechanisms of trichomonal pathogenesis.

Methods
Parasite and cell cultures
Trichomonas vaginalis isolate T016 and Tritrichomonas foetus (02–97) were grown in Trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated horse serum [32]. Immortalized human MS74 VECs were grown as detailed recently by us [15,16] in
D-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
VECs were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Plasmid construction
The plasmid pBS-ap65-neo was constructed by cloning the
coding region of AP65-3 in pBS-FdHAHA-neo (forward
primer 5' GTCCAGCATATGATGCTCGCATCTTCA GTC-3'
and reverse primer 5'-GTCCACGGTACCTTAGTAGAGTTGCTCGTATTC-3'). The parent plasmid pBS-FdHAHA-neo
[33] was used by us recently [16]. The parent plasmid was
partially digested and the 1.7-kb ap65-3 gene was cloned
into the NdeI and Asp718 sites giving rise to pBS-ap65-neo.
In order to generate AP65 with the HA tag, the stop codon
of AP65 was mutated and cloned into pBS-FdHAHA-neo
resulting in pBS-ap65-HA-neo. The new plasmids were
confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid DNA for transfection
was purified using maxi prep columns (Qiagen, Inc.,
Valencia, CA).
Stable transfection and selection for G418 resistance
Transfection of T. foetus cells was carried out by electroporation [34]. Parasites at early logarithmic phase of growth
were used for transfection. Briefly, 4 × 107 parasites were
centrifuged at 1,800 rpm at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in 400 µl fresh TYM before transferring into a 4mm gap cuvette (BTX®, Genetronics, Inc., San Diego, CA)
with 25 µg of plasmid DNA. Electroporation was performed at 320 V, 1000 microfarads and 725 ohms using
the ECM 630 Electro cell manipulator (BTX®). Following
the pulse, cells were placed on ice for 10 min and transferred into two T25 flasks with 50 ml of fresh TYM-serum
medium. The cells were grown free of drug for 24 h followed by the addition of Geneticin (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at 100 µg ml-1. Single cells were
cloned using soft-agar plates [35]. The DNA was isolated
from single cell cultures using DNAZol (Invitrogen) and
further purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. The
presence of plasmid in single cell clones was confirmed by
PCR amplification of the neo gene. The sense 5' GATCGGTACCATGATTGATTGAACA AGATGGATTG-3', and antisense
5'-CTTTAGACCAAGTTCGTGTCAGAAGAACT
CGTCAAG-3' primers were used in the PCR reaction.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed
using SuperScript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 20 µl. One µl of the reverse

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/5

transcribed cDNA was used as template for the PCR
amplification. The ap65 primer sequences used for amplifications were ap65-sense 5'-CAGTCAGTCGACCAGTTAGATATGGGTACAGAC-3'
and
ap65-antisense
5'GTGACAGGATCCCGCTCGCAGTTAGCGCATGTAG-3'.
The α-tubulin gene primers were sense 5'-ACTCTGCTGCCTCGAGCACGGTATC-3' and antisense 5'-GAAATGACTGGTGCATAAGAGC-3'. The common annealing
temperature for the primers of both genes allowed for the
ap65 and α-tubulin primers to be included in the same
PCR reaction.
Immunoblot detection of episomally-expressed AP65
Total protein from parasites was obtained as before using
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation [36] and separated on sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) [37] prior to blotting onto
Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Pisscataway, NJ) for immunoblot detection with mAb
12G4 to AP65 and anti-HA mAb. The mAbs and epitope
reactivity were described recently [15]. Following blot
reactivity with the mAbs, the bands were visualized by the
chemiluminescence assay using horseradish peroxidase as
the color developer (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
Sub-cellular fractionation
The hydrogenosomes were isolated as recently detailed
[15]. Briefly, 1 × 108 trichomonads were homogenized in
buffer (250 mM sucrose, 20 mM KCL, 10 mM KH2PO4, 5
mM MgCl2 and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The homogenate was centrifuged to sediment nuclei and costae at
1,500 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then
transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for
10 min. The sediment was then washed once more with
homogenization buffer and was highly enriched for
hydrogenosomes, which was confirmed biochemically as
recently described [16]. The sediment was resuspended in
the buffer and stored at -70°C. Membrane isolation was
also carried out as described recently [38]. T. foetus (1 ×
108) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), sonicated, and subjected to low-speed centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was further fractionated by sequential differential
centrifugations of 1,500 × g, 10,000 × g, and 100,000 × g
for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was used for protein
analysis.
Ligand assay to determine the amounts of adhesins on the
surface
The ligand assay to detect adhesins that bind to host cell
surfaces was carried out as before [25]. Briefly, after fixation of the MS-74 VECs with glutaraldehyde, 106 epithelial cells were incubated with a trichomonal detergent
extract derived from 2 × 107 solubilized parasites. After
incubation, cells were vigorously washed to remove

unbound and loosely-associated trichomonad proteins.
Cells were boiled in electrophoresis dissolving buffer to
elute the proteins bound to the MS-74 VEC followed by
SDS-PAGE. The gels were further stained with Coomassie
Brilliant blue for visualization, and duplicate gels were
blotted onto Hybond-P membranes for immunoblot
analysis using the mAbs as probes.

lation vials and radioactivity was measured. The assay was
performed with quadruplicate samples.

Immunoprecipitation studies
AP65 from the membranes and hydrogenosomes derived
from the fractionation experiments was immunoprecipitated using mAb DM116 [15]. A standard immunoprecipitation protocol was used [39]. Briefly, the fractions (0.5
mg) prepared as mentioned above, were mixed with 5.0
µg of mAb DM116 for 4 h at 4°C. The extract and mAb
were mixed on a rotating platform for 3 h with Protein ASepharose beads. The beads were washed three times with
PBS, and samples were eluted by boiling for 10 min in
SDS dissolving buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analyses and ligand assays
were performed as described above.

Immunofluorescence detection of AP65 on the surface
Immunofluorescence of AP65 on the surface and in
hydrogenosomes of trichomonads was carried out using a
modification of a recently-described procedure [15].
Briefly, 1 × 106 logarithmic-phase organisms were washed
twice with cold PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde
for 10 min at RT. Fixed cells were washed in PBS and permeabilized with 1% NP-40 for 45 min at RT. Trichomonads were then blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h at RT prior to
incubation for an additional 1 h at RT with hybridoma
supernatants of mAb 12G4 (1:100) and anti-HA mAb F11
(1:1000). Parasites were washed with PBS and incubated
for 1 h at 37°C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:100. Finally, parasites were washed twice with PBS and observed under
1000× magnification using the Olympus BX41
microscope.
Adherence assay
Immortalized human MS-74 VECs [40] were used for the
adherence assay as recently described [15]. Briefly, 2 × 104
MS-74 VECs were seeded onto individual wells of 96-well
Costar flat bottom plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and
grown for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal
bovine serum (FBS). VECs were then washed twice with a
medium mixture of DMEM:TYM (2:1; v/v) without
serum. Trichomonads were labeled with [3H] thymidine
for 18 h, washed three times with DMEM-TYM and resuspended. Then, 4 × 105 tritium-labeled parasites were
added to the individual wells of the 96-well plate with a
confluent MS-74 VEC monolayer and incubated for 30
min at 37°C. Cells were then washed thoroughly with the
DMEM-TYM. Individual wells were placed in mini-scintil-
