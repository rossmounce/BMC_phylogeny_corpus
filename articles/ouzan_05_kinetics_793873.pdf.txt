Abstract
Background: Pegylated interferon given for 24 or 48 weeks constitutes the most effective initial
therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. It has been shown that viral load at week 2 appears
the best time for predicting response to treatment. The objectives of this study were to assess
whether the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA viral decline is predictive of sustained virological
response (SVR) and to determine the best time for predicting complete response in our cohort of
naïve patients treated with pegylated interferon alpha-2a (Peg-IFN alpha-2a) and ribavirin.
Results: Twenty patients treated with Peg-IFN alpha-2a and ribavirin for 48 weeks were studied.
Six months after the end of treatment, a SVR (negative HCV RNA measured by PCR six months
after the end of therapy) was obtained in 9 patients. Samples were obtained before and at week 2,
4, 8, and 12. At the end of week 2, viral load decreased more than 1.39 log in 8 out of the 9 patients
with SVR and in 1 out of the 11 other patients. When we considered the viral load reduction from
baseline to each week of treatment, week 2 appeared to be the best point time for predicting SVR,
with a sensitivity of 91% (95%CI: 59;99), a specificity of 89% (52;98), a positive predictive value of
91% (59;99) and a negative predictive value of 89% (57;98).
Conclusion: During treatment with Peg-IFN alpha-2a plus ribavirin in genotype 1 patients, when
the main objective of the treatment is viral eradication, viral kinetics showed that week 2 appeared
to be the best time point for predicting SVR. Our results must be further confirmed on a larger
cohort.

Background
Interferon alpha plus ribavirin and more recently
pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) given for 24 or 48 weeks
constitutes the most effective initial therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C [1-4]. In relapsers, we have

previously shown that viral load decline at week 2 appears
the best time for predicting the response to treatment [5].
Understanding the kinetics and dynamics of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) has greatly improved the understanding of the life

cycle of these viruses and their response to therapy [6].
Studies of the kinetics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) after initiation of IFN monotherapy have revealed that IFN alpha2b causes a rapid dose-dependent reduction in HCV RNA
levels within 24 to 48 hours. Mathematical calculations
revealed that HCV has a serum half-life of 3 hours and a
viral production rate of 1.0 × 1012 virions/day [2,7]. This
rapid decline appears to be a strong predictor of response
to treatment [8,9]. After this rapid decline, there is a
slower phase of viral decline that varies widely among
patients and is attributed to the death rate of infected
hepatocytes. The rate of decline of the second phase,
which is probably mediated by immune clearance of
infected hepatocytes, appears as the strongest viral kinetic
predictor of early viral clearance. Mathematical modelling
of viral dynamics revealed that turnover rates of pre-treatment viral production and clearance were high and that in
vivo half-lives were a few hours for free HCV virions and
1–70 days for productively infected cells [10]. Infected cell
death rate, which determines the second phase decline, is
also predictive of response to treatment [11].
In the present study, viral kinetics during Peg-IFN alpha2a plus ribavirin treatment were determined at week 2, 4,
8, and 12 of treatment in 20 patients after a first course of
48 weeks of Peg-IFN alpha-2a plus ribavirin. Our objec-

tives were to assess: 1) whether the HCV RNA viral decline
is predictive of a sustained virological response (SVR); and
2) the best time for predicting complete response in our
cohort of patients.

Results
Epidemiological data for each patient are shown in Table
1. The mean age was (Mean ± SE) 50 ± 11 years and 70%
of patients were men. According to Metavir fibrosis staging, 7 patients were staged F0F1 (absent-minimal fibrosis)
and 13 were F2-F4 (significant fibrosis to cirrhosis) with
one case of cirrhosis (F4).
The difference in logarithmic values of viral load was calculated between the different times: Baseline – Week 2,
Baseline – Week 4, Baseline – Week 8, Baseline – Week 12.
When we considered the reduction of the viral load (in
log10) from baseline to each of the first weeks of treatment, week 2 point time tend to be better than other time
points for predicting SVR, with an area under receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.72;0.99), a sensitivity of 91% (59;99), a
specificity of 89% (52;98), a positive predictive value
(PPV) of 91% (59;99) and a negative predictive value
(NPV) of 89% (57;98) (P non-significant) (Table 2). Viral
load decline in the patients with SVR and without SVR is

The ROC curve method was used to determine the best cut-off that corresponds to the higher rate of sensitivity and specificity of predictions at
week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12. The accuracy of the test is measured by the area under the ROC curve. This area measures the
discrimination, that is, the ability of the test to correctly classify patients with SVR and those without SVR. The analysis shows that the best results
are obtained for week 2 viral drop, with a viral drop threshold of 1.39, an area under curve of 0.93, and a sensitivity, a specificity, a PPV, and a NPV
rate of respectively 91%, 89%, 91%, and 89%. (P was non-significant for all areas under ROC curves comparisons.)

shown in Figure 1. Patients with unfavourable virological
response had a slight viral load decline of 3 log during the
first 8 weeks of treatment. Patients with SVR had the same
viral load decline (3 log) in only four weeks of treatment.
At the end of week 2, a viral load drop of more than 1.39
log was observed in 8 out of the 9 patients with SVR and
in only 1 out of the 11 other patients.

Other studies have reported the same observation at week
2 [18-20], whereas Zeuzem et al. reported that the absence
of a 3 log10 viral decline after one month of therapy is
associated with an absence of SVR [2]. The low number of
patients included in our study can lead to confusing biases
on the predictive values; therefore, our results must be
confirmed on a larger cohort.

Discussion

Nine out of the 11 non-responders failed to have SVR after
having early virological response (EVR) at week 12 (NPV
of 100% and PPV of 50%). These results are in the same
range as those of recent studies, which showed that failure
to achieve EVR at week 12 of therapy is highly predictive
of the absence of therapy (97%–100% negative predictive
value), whereas the predictive value of achieving SVR after
EVR at week 12 is not so strong (PPV = 65%) [3,21,22].

Viral load measurements provide an indication of viral
replication, thereby serving as a valuable tool for guiding
the initiation of therapy and subsequent changes. The earliest time to estimate the viral decline that may be predictive of SVR is not clearly defined. Many studies have
reported the viral dynamics during the 24–48 hours after
treatment initiation [12-17] and have shown that interferon resistance seems to be a dose related phenomenon,
rather than an intrinsic characteristic of the virus. Based
on pivotal trials in large multicenter studies, positive and
negative predictions of SVR using viral load kinetics have
been established and now serve as recommendations on
antiviral therapy management both by American and by
European international consensus conferences. The ability for predicting either a positive or a negative therapeutic
response is of an obvious benefit either to clinicians or to
patients. Positive predictive evidence early in the course of
treatment could be used for reinforcing the importance of
compliance in ensuring a successful outcome. Conversely,
negative predictive capability would allow clinicians to
discontinue therapy early during treatment, which would
save health care resources and, even more important,
could prevent drug-related adverse events [1-3].
In the present study, when we considered the median
reduction of the viral load (in log10) from baseline to
week 2, 4, 8, and 12 of treatment, week 2 point time tend
to be better than other time points for predicting SVR,
with a PPV of 91% and a NPV of 89% and a very good sensitivity and specificity (despite a non-significant P-value).

Methods introduced for analysing HIV dynamics in vivo
can be modified to give insights into the HCV dynamics,
the mechanisms of action of interferon as well as the consequences of varying dosages of interferon [14]. The high
turnover rates of HCV explain the rapid generation of viral
diversity and the opportunity for viral escape from host
immune surveillance and antiviral therapy. Ideally, interferon alpha serum levels should provide constant pressure
on the virus and should prevent viral rebound, thereby
avoiding continued viral replication and minimising the
potential of emergence of drug-resistant quasi-species
[23].

Conclusion
When the main objective of the treatment is viral eradication, the study of viral kinetics during the first twelve
weeks of Peg-IFN alpha-2a plus ribavirin treatment
showed that week 2 tend to be the best time point for predicting sustained virological response. The early identification of patients with no SVR may lead for proposing an
interruption of therapy for avoiding side effects and additional costs, or an early change of therapy [24]. This obser-

weeks in patients with (SVR) and without (Non-SVR) sustained response to Peg-IFN alpha-2a + ribavirin. The viral
load detection limit of the quantitative assay was 615 UI/ml
(3.5 Log).

Blood was collected in plasma preparation tubes (Becton
Dickinson) that were centrifuged directly after collection
in order to minimize RNA breakdown [26]. Viral load was
assessed using a quantitative bDNA assay (Versant™ 3.0
superscript, Roche, Puteaux, France) with a detection limit
of 615 IU/ml (3,200 copies ml). The sensitivity and linearity of the assay were validated for all the genotypes [27].
Genotypes were determined by sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 5' non-coding of the genome [28].
There were 8 genotype 1A and 8 genotype 1B patients,
and, in 4 cases, genotype 1 subtype was undetermined.
Statistical analysis
The ROC curve method was used to determine the best
cut-off between week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12 viral
load measurements, by comparing the areas under the
ROC curves. The Hanley-McNeil test was used for testing
the statistical significance of the difference between the
areas under ROC curves. The significant (alpha) level was
set at 5%.

vation, after being validated on a larger cohort of
genotype 1 patients, should have an impact in clinical
routine in order to optimise antiviral therapy [25].

Authors' contributions

Patients
A total of 20 consecutive patients were prospectively
enrolled after a first course of combination (Peg-IFN
alpha-2a plus ribavirin) and just before starting interferon
and ribavirin therapy for chronic HCV infection, at the
Hepatology and Gastroenterology Department of the
Arnault Tzanck Institute (St Laurent du Var, France). All
patients tested positive for HCV RNA. All other causes of
chronic hepatitis were excluded by appropriate serological
testing and liver histology. All patients were treated with
ribavirin 1 g once a week, orally, plus Peg-IFN alfa-2a (180
µg subcutaneous injection once a week) for 48 weeks.
Written consent was obtained from each patient, and the
study was approved by the local Ethics Committee in
accordance with the 1975 declaration of Helsinki. Those
patients were all genotype 1. Virological response was
assessed by a qualitative HCV RNA assay with a lower sensitivity of 50 IU/ml (HCV Amplicor 2.0 Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). According to the qualitative HCV
RNA results, patients were defined as virologic sustained
responders (HCV RNA negative 6 months after the end of
therapy) or as non-responders. SVR was obtained in 9 out
of 20 patients. All patients had liver biopsy assessment
according to Metavir histological staging.
