Abstract
Background: We performed an environmental study of viruses infecting the symbiotic single-celled algae of
Paramecium bursaria (Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus, PBCV) in Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan. The viruses
detected were all Chlorella variabilis virus (CvV = NC64A virus). One of them, designated CvV-BW1, was subjected to
further characterization.
Results: CvV-BW1 formed small plaques and had a linear DNA genome of 370 kb, as judged by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis. Restriction analysis indicated that CvV-BW1 DNA belongs to group H, one of the most resistant
groups among CvV DNAs. Based on a phylogenetic tree constructed using the dnapol gene, CvV was classified into
two clades, A and B. CvV-BW1 belonged to clade B, in contrast to all previously identified virus strains of group H
that belonged to clade A.
Conclusions: We conclude that CvV-BW1 composes a distinct species within C. variabilis virus.

Background
Chlorella virus that infects Chlorella-like algae symbiotic
with coelenterate Hydra viridis was first discovered in
1981 and designated HVCV (Hydra viridis Chlorella
virus) [1]. Subsequently, another Chlorella virus that
infects Chlorella-like algae symbiotic with ciliate Paramecium bursaria was described (Paramecium bursaria
Chlorella virus [PBCV]) [2]. Studies on HVCV and
PBCV have revealed strong host-parasite relationships
[[3] and references therein]: HVCVs do not infect P.
bursaria symbionts, whereas PBCVs do not infect hydra
symbionts; PBCVs collected in the United States infect
algal strain NC64A (representative of U.S. P. bursaria
symbionts) and other U.S. P. bursaria symbionts, but
they do not infect algal strain Pbi (representative of German P. bursaria symbionts) or other European P. bursaria symbionts; PBCVs collected in Europe infect
European P. bursaria symbionts but do not infect U.S.

P. bursaria symbionts (Fig. 1). Later, another group of
viruses that infect Chlorella-like algae symbiotic with
heliozoon, Acanthocystis turfacea was described [4].
Chlorella viruses studied to date, therefore, can be
divided into four categories: HVCV, NC64A virus, Pbi
virus, and ATCV (Acanthocystis turfacea Chlorella
virus). Furthermore, none of the Chlorella viruses infect
free-living green algae, and NC64A viruses exhibit a
degree of diversification with regard to, for example,
plaque size, hyaluronan productivity, and DNA methylation level. Note that viruses attack isolated (or released)
algae but not algae inhabiting their hosts (i.e., hydra or
paramecium).
Recent taxonomic studies on P. bursaria symbionts indicated that the algal group “American” containing strain
NC64A and the algal group “European” containing strain
Pbi are genetically distinct from each other, as well as
from any known free-living algae and other symbiotic
algal species [5]. Consequently, each group has been given
a distinct species name, Chlorella variabilis (“American”)
and Micractinium reisseri (“European”) [6]. Due to the
defects in taxonomy of the host algae, circular virus names

Yogo. For four sites at Lake Biwa, sampling was carried
out almost every month to observe seasonal variations
in the virus populations. Water samples were centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min, and then virus concentrated waters were filtrated through nitrocellulose
membrane (pore size, 0.45 μm). Whether cultures contained the viruses was determined by mixing with
C. variabilis F36-ZK or M. reisseri SW1-ZK liquid cultures on 48-well microplates. The titers (PFU mL-1) of
virus-containing cultures were determined by serial
dilution.

bursaria Chlorella [PBCV], and Acanthocystis turfacea
Chlorella virus [ATCV]) and strange names based on host
strains (i.e., NC64A virus and Pbi virus) have been used.
In this report, viruses infecting C. variabilis and M. reisseri
are referred to as C. variabilis virus (CvV) and M. reisseri
virus (MrV), respectively (Fig. 1).
Chlorella variabilis F36-ZK isolated from Japanese
P. bursaria [7] and M. reisseri SW1-ZK isolated from
German P. bursaria [8] are lesser-known hosts in PBCV
studies, although they are well researched strains in phylogenetic studies [9,10]. We carried out a screen for
viruses from Lake Biwa and adjacent water environments using C. variabilis F36-ZK and M. reisseri SW1ZK as hosts. Here, we present the results of the environmental study and the results of a biological study of one
strain, CvV-BW1, obtained in the environmental study.

Methods
Algal strains and culture conditions

Chlorella variabilis F36-ZK (NIES-2540) and NC64A
(ATCC 50258) were cultured in C liquid medium [11]
with 200 mg L-1 arginine, while M. reisseri SW1-ZK was
cultured in C liquid medium with 1 g L-1 casamino acid.
They were maintained under fluorescent illumination
(16 L:8 D, 50 μmol photons m-2 s-1) at 25°C.

We followed a previously described plaque assay procedure [12] using C medium with 5 g L -1 glucose and
200 mg L -1 serine (CGS) in place of modified Bold’s
basal medium (MBBM). Plaques were observed after
3 days of cultivation. Single plaques were picked up and
transferred to fresh algal lawn plates. Single virus strains
were established by repeating this procedure several
times.
Electric microscopic observation

Chlorella variabilis was incubated for 2 h (25°C) after
adding cultured virus, then fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde
and subsequently with 0.5% osmic acid. Resin-embedded
specimens were cut into ultrathin sections, stained with
3% uranyl acetate, and then observed under an electron
microscope at an acceleration voltage of 75 kV.
Another culture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for
5 min, and the resulting supernatant was dropped onto
Veco H-200 mesh (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA), stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and
then observed at 75 kV.
SDS-PAGE analysis

Chlorella variabilis-CvV-BW1 culture mixture was first
centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove algal
debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 37,000 ×
g for 1 h to precipitate virus particles. Urea was added
to the precipitate at a final concentration of 4 M. After
incubation at 45°C for 1.5 h, the mixture was
centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 10 min to remove the precipitate. The supernatant was subjected to standard
SDS-PAGE analysis; 4.5% and 7.5% polyacrylamide gels
were used for condensation and separation, respectively.
Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of
200 V using a tank buffer consisting of 0.1% SDS,
192 mM glycine, and 25 mM Tris.

Detection of viruses

N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and amino acid
sequence homology search

Water samples were collected from eight sites at Lake
Biwa (the largest lake in Japan) and the adjacent Lake

After SDS-PAGE, proteins in the polyacrylamide gels
were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride

membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,
USA) using a Horizeblot apparatus (Atto, Tokyo, Japan)
at a constant current of 0.8 mA cm -2 for 1 h. After
staining the membrane with 0.1% Ponceau solution,
bands of interest were cut out and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing using a PPSQ-21/23 peptide
sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan); in the present
study, 15 N-terminal amino acids were examined. Using
the obtained 15 amino acid sequence, a homology
search was carried out using NCBI protein-protein
BLAST http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

An equal volume of 1.4% InCert Agarose (45°C; BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) was added to a suspension
of Chlorella virus, and the mixture was poured into a
mold and solidified by cooling at room temperature.
An agar block was removed from the mold, soaked in
cell wall-dissolving solution (1 mg mL-1 proteinase K,
1% lauroyl sarcosinate, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and
incubated at 50°C for 16 h. The mixture was discarded, and fresh mixture was supplied and incubated
at 50°C for 24 h. After incubation at 4°C for 2 days in
TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing
0.1 mM EDTA), the gel block was subjected to PFGE
using 1% Seakem GTG agarose (Bio-Rad) and a
CHEF-DRIII system (Bio-Rad). Tank buffer (89 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM EDTA and
89 mM boric acid) was used. Electrophoresis was performed at 14°C. Other conditions were as follows:
switching time, 22 to 50 s; total time, 24 h; voltage,
6.6 V cm -1 . Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes
(Bio-Rad) and l DNA ladder (Bio-Rad) were used as
size markers.
Extraction of CvV-BW1 DNA

Five units of DNase I was added to the virus particles
(precipitate) described above. The resultant precipitate
was suspended, and the suspension was incubated at
37°C for 1 h. Proteinase K to at a final concentration of
1 mg mL-1, EDTA to 0.1 M, and SDS to 0.5% were then
added to the suspension. After incubation at 60°C for
1 h, the mixture was subjected to the standard phenol
extraction procedure [13].
Digestion of CvV-BW1 DNA with restriction enzymes

Restriction enzymes were purchased from Takara Bio
(Otsu, Japan) and/or Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan).
Restriction enzymes were used under the conditions
recommended by the manufacturers.
HPLC analysis of methylated nucleotides

CvV-BW1 DNA was mixed with Nuclease P1 (GC Analysis Standard Kit; Yamasa, Choshi, Japan). The mixture

Page 3 of 10

was incubated at 50°C for 1 h. After digestion, the mixture was subjected to HPLC using a column of ODSYMC PACK AQ-312 (6.0 mm in inner diameter and
150 mm in length) (YMC, Kyoto, Japan). HPLC conditions and peak assignment were adopted from Kowalak
et al. [14] and Ushida et al. [15].
Hyaluronan labeling

Hyaluronan labeling was performed according to a
modification of the technique reported by Graves et al.
[16] and Cohen et al. [17]. Chlorella variabilis F36-ZK
was incubated for 2 h (25°C) after adding viruses, of
which 200 μL was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min.
Cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Centrifugation
and PBS wash were repeated three times. Then, cells
were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 20 μL of biotinylated hyaluronic acid binding protein (bHABP, 0.5 mg
mL -1 ; Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan). Centrifugation and
PBS wash were repeated three times, followed by incubation with 50 mL of CY3-conjugated streptavidin (1.8
mg mL -1 ; ENCO, Petach Tikva, Israel) for 30 min at
37°C. Centrifugation and PBS wash were repeated
three times, and then cells were observed under a
fluorescence microscope with excitation at 510 to 550
nm.
DNA polymerase gene analyses

The DNA polymerase gene (dnapol) region was
amplified using the forward primer M37dpo0310F (5′CAA TGG TGC AAT TCG TGT TC-3′) and reverse
primer M37dpo2390R (5′-GTG AAT TTT TCC ATG
GGA TAC TC-3′). These primers were designed with
reference to three longer determined sequences of
PBCV-1 (M86836), NY-2A (M86837), and CVK2
(AB011500). A standard three-step PCR protocol was
carried out (annealing temperature of 55°C) using
Takara Ex Taq (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer’s directions. The PCR product was confirmed
by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, and then sequenced
directly.
The obtained sequence was compared to those of
Chlorella viruses available in the databases. The alignment was performed with reference to Zhang et al.
[18], and 663 nucleotide positions (Polymerase
Domain, excluding introns) contributed to phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by
the neighbor-joining (NJ) methods of Saito and Nei’s
evolutionary model using Clustal X ver. 2 [19]. The
significance of each node was tested using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Evolutionary divergence between
sequences was estimated using the Jukes-Cantor
method in MEGA4 [20].

Results and discussion
Ecological studies of viruses in Lake Biwa

Using two strains of algae, C. variabilis F36-ZK and M.
reisseri SW1-ZK, we surveyed algae-lytic viruses at nine
sites in Lake Biwa and Lake Yogo, both in Shiga Prefecture, western Honshu, Japan (Fig. 2), between May and
July 2004. At all sites and at nearly all sampling time
points, we detected viruses infecting C. variabilis. None
of the isolated viruses infected M. reisseri in this study,
indicating that all of those obtained were C. variabilis
virus (CvV = NC64A virus).
Since the development of a screening method for virus
sampling [12], both CvV and MrV have been detected
from extensive regions of the world, but MrV has never

been recorded from East Asia [21,22]. In the present
study, we also found CvVs, but not MrV, from the
water of Lake Biwa. Van Etten [21] indicated that the
factors influencing the distribution patterns of these
viruses are probably latitude and altitude. Based on a
series of taxonomic studies on symbiotic algae, the all
P. bursaria collected so far in Japan have been verified
as C. variabilis-harboring type [6]. The absence of MrV
in Lake Biwa is inevitable if no M. reisseri occur in this
lake.
The results of our ecological studies are summarized
in Table 1. The titers of CvVs were mostly between 0.5
and 50 PFU mL -1 . This density level is the same or
slightly lower than those reported in previous studies
[e.g., [23,24]]. Exceptionally high values were recorded
in May (85.3 PFU mL -1 ) and June (171.0 PFU mL -1 )
2004 at Shin-Asahi Windmill Village (site 8). In addition, no clear seasonal changes in population density
were detected, and the population densities were particularly low (< 1.5 PFU mL-1) in high-temperature waters
(around 30°C) in July 2004 at all the sites except ShinAsahi Windmill Village.
Reisser et al. [25] attempted to explain the density of
viruses in natural water environments; the viral density
depends on the P. bursaria population and the probability of its burst (i.e., release of symbiotic algae). In 2003
and 2004, a major outbreak of koi herpes virus (KHV)
occurred in Japan. Populations of koi (common carp) in
Lake Biwa were attacked by the virus from May to June
2004, which caused mass death of the fish. Large numbers of koi carcasses washed ashore onto the coastal
area of a sampling point, Shin-Asahi Windmill Village
(site 8). At this time, shallow water around this point
seemed to be under low-oxygen conditions caused by
decomposition of fish carcasses. We detected the highest
virus concentrations at this sampling point at these
times. In contrast, lower densities of viruses were

common in July 2004 at all sampling points (Table 1).
In general, high temperature and strong light prompt
Paramecium to avoid its translatory movement. Low
oxygen levels may have caused bursting of some P.

We performed plaque-forming assay of the viruses, and
all but one plate revealed plaques 3 to 4 mm in diameter. The exceptional plate, for the sample water from
Ohashi Marina (site 4, May 2004), had smaller plaques
(about 1 mm in diameter) in addition to the normalsized plaques (Fig. 3). Viruses recovered from one of the
smaller plaques formed smaller plaques on reinfection.
By repeating this procedure several times, we concluded
that we had established a pure clone of smaller plaqueforming virus, which we designated CvV-BW1. We subsequently focused our attention on the biological characteristics of CvV-BW1. We used four independent
clones of normal-sized plaque-forming viruses, CvVBW2, -BW3, -BW4, and -BW5, obtained in the same
ecological study. These CvV-BW strains infect C. variabilis NC64A but not M. reisseri. Similar to known CvVs,
CvV-BW1 appeared as polyhedral particles about
150 nm in diameter (Fig. 4).
Protein of CvV-BW1

First, we analyzed the protein composition of CvV-BW1
by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 5, when viral proteins
were not heat-treated (leftmost lane), two major bands,

Compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes
and l DNA ladder, we concluded that the CvV-BW1
DNA is 370 kb in length, assuming that it has a linear
DNA genome. CvV-BW1 DNA was somewhat larger
than those of CvV-BW2, -BW3, and -BW4.
Resistance/susceptibility of CvV-BW1 DNA to restriction
enzymes

Figure 5 SDS-PAGE analysis of CvV-BW1 virion proteins. From
the left, no heat treatment, heat treatment at 60°C, at 70°C, at 80°C,
at 100°C prior to electrophoresis.

CvV has been divided into 16 “species” based on the
restriction enzyme digestion patterns and various other
characteristics [3]. We attempted to cut the DNA of
CvV-BW strains using six widely used restriction
enzymes: HindIII, BamHI, EcoRI, MssI, SfiI, and SwaI
(Fig. 7). The results indicated that CvV-BW1 DNA was
much more resistant to cleavage than the DNAs of
other BW strains. That is, CvV-BW1 DNA was cut only
by MssI and SwaI, while CvV-BW2, -BW3, and -BW5
DNAs were effectively cut by all six enzymes tested.
DNAs of CvV-BW2 and -BW5 showed the same band
pattern, indicating that they are clones of a single
species.

designated X and Y, were observed. Judging from the
intensity, the proteins in these bands accounted for 80%
of the total viral proteins. By increasing the temperature
of the heat treatment to 70°C, band X faded, whereas
the intensity of band Y increased. With further increases
in temperature, band Y faded, whereas the intensity of
band Z increased; with heat treatment at 100°C, only
band Z was observed. The sizes of proteins in bands X,
Y, and Z were estimated to be 370 kDa, 105 kDa, and
50 kDa, respectively, compared to size markers. To
identify proteins of these bands, we performed an Nterminal amino acid sequence analysis. Although we did
not obtain meaningful results for protein of band X,
presumably due to an insufficient amount of protein, we
obtained the same sequence, AGGLSQLVAYGAQDV,
for the proteins recovered from bands Y and Z. The
obtained N-terminal amino acid sequence was completely identical to those of the major capsid proteins of all
PVCVs (NA46A virus and Pbi virus) reported to date.
Therefore, we concluded that CvV-BW1 has a major
capsid protein of 50 kDa. We thus contended that band
Y represent dimmer of the 50 kDa major capsid protein.
The assignment of protein of band Z remained to be
established. In addition, CvV-BW1 showed at least nine
distinct bands, which showed no changes in electrophoretic mobility according to heat treatment conditions. Further studies are required to characterize the
proteins corresponding to these bands.
Size of CvV-BW1 DNA

To estimate the size of CvV-BW1 DNA, we carried out
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis as described in the
Methods section. The results are shown in Fig. 6.

Figure 7 Restriction enzyme digestion of CvV-BW virion genomes.

An additional 18 restriction enzymes were tested for
CvV-BW1 DNA; 11 of the enzymes did not effectively
cut CvV-BW1 DNA (Fig. 8). The enzymes that did not
effectively cut CvV-BW1 DNA are listed in Table 2
(Enzymes I), while those that cut CvV-BW1 DNA are
shown in Table 3 (Enzymes II). Van Etten et al. [3] classified CvV DNAs into 11 restriction groups (A to K)
based on the effects of 13 restriction enzymes. Although
the enzymes they used were not identical to those
applied here, some were common to the two studies.
Judging from the cleavage patterns with the common

enzymes, we concluded that CvV-BW1 DNA belongs to
group H, which is characterized by resistance to EcoRI
but susceptibility to BglII.
Analysis of the enzymes of I and II indicated that the
AT/GC ratio of the recognition sequences was quite different between them; enzymes I were rich (almost 65%)
in GC, whereas enzymes II were rich (75%) in AT. This
result can be rationalized in two ways: CvV-BW1 DNA
is rich in AT and poor in GC or CvV-BW1 DNA is
highly modified at G and/or C. Nucleotide sequence
analysis of clones in the CvV-BW1 genome library did
not reveal any evidence that CvV-BW1 DNA was ATrich; according to our preliminary genome analysis, the
GC content of CvV-BW1 is in the vicinity of 41.3%.

highly conserved within the viral family Phycodnaviridae
[28,29]. Therefore, we attempted to amplify a homolog
from CvV-BW1 via PCR using sequences that are common to nearly all strains, with PBCV-1, NY-2A, and
CVK2 as primers (Fig. 10). The amplification fragment
of 2060 bp obtained by PCR was then sequenced
(AB572585). Multiple alignment with the known PBCV
dnapol sequences indicated that this 2060-bp fragment
contained an intron of 86 bp. Introns of the same length
are present in dnapol of AR-158, NY-2A, NY-2B, and
NYs-1 [18]. In the phylogenetic tree constructed from
the exon regions of dnapol, CvV was found to be
divided into two clades, A and B, with a minimum

Therefore, we suspected that CvV-BW1 DNA would
have a high incidence of G and/or C modification. To
confirm this speculation, we examined the frequencies
of modified nucleotides in CvV-BW1 DNA; the results
revealed 33.2% 5 mC relative to 5 mC+C and 31.0% 6
mA relative to 6 mA+A.
Production of hyaluronan by CvV-BW1

The best characterized CvV, PBCV-1, encodes hyaluronan synthase (HAS), which functions in the production
of hyaluronan, a polysaccharide covering the outside of
the algal cell wall [26]. Graves et al. [16] showed that
some CvVs produce hyaluronan during infection,
although others do not [27]. Therefore, we examined
whether CvV-BW1 produces hyaluronan. Algal cells
showed strong fluorescence 120 min after infection of
CvV-BW1 (stronger than those infected by CvV-BW3)
using the streptavidin-biotin system, indicating the production of hyaluronan by CvV-BW1 (Fig. 9).
DNA polymerase gene phylogeny of CvV-BW1

The DNA polymerase genes, dnapol, of viruses appear
to have evolved from a common ancestral gene, and are

distance of 0.237 between these clades. As shown in Fig.
10, all CvVs with the 86-bp intron belonged to the same
group that included CvV-BW1 affiliated to clade B,
while all CvVs affiliated to clade A possessed an intron
of 101 bp in their dnapol genes.
Identity of CvV-BW1

Van Etten et al. [3] reported that three viral strains, CA4A, XZ-4A, and XZ-5C, belong to restriction group H.
Note that these strains all form small plaques (1 mm in
diameter) and are rich in methylated nucleotides (40%
to 45% 5 mC among C+5 mC, and 20% to 30% 6 mA
among A+6 mA). As presented above, CvV-BW1 shares
these properties. However, all the strains belonged to
dnapol clade A (101-bp intron group) (Fig. 10). Members of dnapol clade B (86-bp intron group) differ from
CvV-BW1 in some respects. NY-2A belongs to restriction group I, NYs-1 belongs to group F, and NY-2B
belongs to group G. Although the restriction group of
AR158 has not been determined, AR158 does not
encode HAS [30]. Taken together, these findings indicate that CvV-BW1 does not belong to any of the 16
CvV “species” defined to date.

Conclusions
We detected C. variabilis virus (NC64A virus) but not
M. reisseri virus (Pbi virus) in the water of Lake Biwa,
Japan. The highest virus density was recorded in water
under low-oxygen conditions, whereas lower virus densities were commonly found in the seasons when the lake
waters reached up to around 30°C. These results suggest
that viral density is affected by the population density of
P. bursaria and its burst ratio.
The viral strain CvV-BW1 found in Lake Biwa was
examined in detail with regard to plaque size, electron
microscopic features, protein composition, genome size,
restriction enzyme digestion, level of DNA methylation,
production of hyaluronan, and phylogeny of the DNA
polymerase gene. Taken together, all of these observations indicate that CvV-BW1 is likely to be a new species of C. variabilis virus.
