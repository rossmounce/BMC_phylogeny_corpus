Abstract
Background: Tight junctions are an intercellular adhesion complex of epithelial and endothelial
cells, and form a paracellular barrier that restricts the diffusion of solutes on the basis of size and
charge. Tight junctions are formed by multiprotein complexes containing cytosolic and
transmembrane proteins. How these components work together to form functional tight junctions
is still not well understood and will require a complete understanding of the molecular composition
of the junction.
Results: Here we identify a new transmembrane component of tight junctions: MarvelD3, a fourspan transmembrane protein. Its predicted transmembrane helices form a Marvel (MAL and related
proteins for vesicle traffic and membrane link) domain, a structural motif originally discovered in
proteins involved in membrane apposition and fusion events, such as the tight junction proteins
occludin and tricellulin. In mammals, MarvelD3 is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms.
Both isoforms exhibit a broad tissue distribution and are expressed by different types of epithelial
as well as endothelial cells. MarvelD3 co-localises with occludin at tight junctions in intestinal and
corneal epithelial cells. RNA interference experiments in Caco-2 cells indicate that normal
MarvelD3 expression is not required for the formation of functional tight junctions but depletion
results in monolayers with increased transepithelial electrical resistance.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that MarvelD3 is a third member of the tight junction-associated
occludin family of transmembrane proteins. Similar to occludin, normal expression of MarvelD3 is
not essential for the formation of functional tight junctions. However, MarvelD3 functions as a
determinant of epithelial paracellular permeability properties.

Background
Tight junctions comprise the most apical of the junctional
structures in epithelial cells and form a diffusion barrier
allowing for the regulated movement of ions and solutes
through the paracellular pathway [1]. Paracellular transport is driven by concentration gradients and is size- and

ion-selective; however, the molecular mechanisms that
permit selective paracellular diffusion are only partially
understood. Tight junctions also participate in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity and in various
signalling pathways controlling gene expression, cell differentiation and proliferation. Their ability to perform

such an array of functions is largely attributable to the
diverse protein complement from which they are composed.
There are two main classes of transmembrane proteins
found at the tight junction: the four- and the single-span
transmembrane proteins [2-4]. While both classes have
been implicated in the adhesive properties of the tight
junction, only the four-pass transmembrane proteins â€“
namely claudins, occludin and tricellulin â€“ have so far
been directly linked to the barrier properties of the junction. The single-span proteins (e.g., JAMs, Crb3) as well as
Bves, a protein with three transmembrane domains, serve
different types of regulatory and signalling functions during differentiation, junction assembly, and transmigration of leukocytes [5-9].
Claudins are believed to be the main structural component of the tight junction strands [10,11]. They are
thought to form regulated aqueous pores or channels that
enable the passive diffusion of charged molecules through
the paracellular space [12-14]. Claudin expression and
activity are hence thought to be major determinants of
paracellular ion conductance. As altered expression of various claudins has been linked to carcinogenesis and cell
migration, claudins may also modulate subcellular signalling mechanisms and possess non-junctional functions in
the regulation of integrin function [15-24].
A distinct group of tight junction-associated proteins is
represented by occludin and tricellulin, both also components of intramembrane strands [25-27]. Based on functional studies in tissue culture cell lines, animal models, as
well as inherited human diseases, it seems that occludin
and tricellulin possess regulatory roles in junction function, and, at least in the case of occludin, participate in signalling pathways regulated by tight junctions [27-40].
Whereas experiments with tissue culture cells suggest that
tricellulin directly contributes to the junctional structure,
no such evidence has been reported for occludin [27,39].
Nevertheless, it has recently been demonstrated that
occludin depletion results in a redistribution of tricellulin,
suggesting that the latter protein may be able to compensate for some functions of the former in occludin knockdown cells [41]. It is thus important to determine whether
there are other members of the occludin family at tight
junctions.
The four transmembrane helix architecture of both occludin and tricellulin represents a Marvel domain (MAL and
related proteins for vesicle traffic and membrane link)
[42]. While the prevalence and significance of the Marvel
domain is not yet clear, its identification in proteins of the
MAL, physin, gyrin and occludin families has lead to putative roles in cholesterol-rich membrane apposition and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/10/95

fusion events to be proposed. Whether all Marvel domain
proteins are indeed associated in such membrane apposition events, however, is not clear. The bioinformatics
analysis by Sanchez-Pulido and colleagues not only identified Marvel domain-containing proteins of known functions, but also proteins that had previously not been
analysed such as Marvel domain-containing protein 2,
which was later named tricellulin, and Marvel domaincontaining protein 3 (MarvelD3), a protein that has not
yet been studied [42].
In this study, we identify MarvelD3, a four-pass transmembrane protein of about 40 kDa, as a novel integral
membrane component of the epithelial cell tight junctions. MarvelD3 co-localises with the tight junction protein occludin but not with the adherens junction marker
E-cadherin. Functional analysis suggests that depletion of
MarvelD3 does not interfere with the formation of functional tight junctions but results in increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), suggesting that MarvelD3 is
a determinant of paracellular ion permeability.

Results
Expression of MarvelD3 in epithelial and endothelial cells
Bioinformatics analysis revealed the existence of two
human MarvelD3 isoforms: isoform 1 contains 410
amino acids [Genbank: NM_001017967] and isoform 2
401 amino acids [Genbank: NM_052858] (Fig. 1A). A
membrane topology analysis with Phobius http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/phobius/ and TMpred http://
www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html confirmed that both isoforms are predicted to contain four
transmembrane domains and to expose their N- and Cterminal domains to the cytosol. The two isoforms represent splice variants and share the predicted N-terminal
cytoplasmic domain of 198 amino acids, but differ in
their C-terminal halves that contain the transmembrane
domains. Both MarvelD3 isoforms are predicted to possess only short C-terminal cytoplasmic domains (30aa
isoform1; 18aa isoform 2) with no apparent similarities
to the comparatively long cytoplasmic domains of tricellulin and occludin that contain their ZO-1 binding sites
[38,43].

Database searches revealed that MarvelD3 is expressed in
chicken, Xenopus and various mammalian species, but
not in any invertebrates, suggesting that it is expressed by
vertebrates only (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Alternatively
spliced isoforms were only found in mammalian species.
In contrast, the chicken genome contains two distinct
MarvelD3 genes, variant A and B, that reside on different
chromosomes. Variant A is more similar to mammalian
isoform 2. Although variant B is more similar to isoform
1 than 2, the two chicken proteins show a similar degree
of conservation with mammalian isoform 1. It thus seems

MarvelD3 sequences were retrieved from Genbank and aligned using ClustalW (see Fig. 1 for a selection of the alignments). Indicated are all
Genbank accession numbers. The scores reflect percent identity. For mammals, the two alternatively spliced isoforms were used. Two different
MarvelD3 genes, variants A and B, exist in chicken. Only variant A was found in X. laevis and zebrafish.

that mammalian isoform 2 and the variant A gene found
in birds, fish and amphibians represent the MarvelD3
form common to all vertebrates.
We first generated an antibody against a peptide of the Nterminal cytoplasmic domain to analyse MarvelD3
expression. Expression was analysed in two epithelial cell
lines derived from different types of epithelia: Caco-2, a
human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, and an immortalised human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE) [7,44]. Total
cell extracts were generated from control cells as well as
cells transfected with control siRNAs or a pool of four siRNAs targeting MarvelD3. All four targeted sequences are
part of the common exon encoding the N-terminal cyto-

plasmic domain; hence, mRNAs encoding both isoforms
should become degraded.
Fig. 2A shows that the antibody recognised a band of
about 40 kD in both cell lines as expected. The band
became weaker with increasing concentrations of
MarvelD3 siRNA, indicating that the band indeed corresponded to MarvelD3. Deconvolution of the MarvelD3
siRNA pool revealed that siRNAs 14 and 16 were the most
effective of the four sequences and were hence used for the
subsequent functional analysis (Fig. 2B). Transfection of
cDNAs encoding the two isoforms resulted in strong
bands of the same molecular weight in immunoblots with
the anti-MarvelD3 antibody, further supporting its specif-

all samples were exposed for the same period of time).
Further immunoblotting experiments revealed MarvelD3
protein expression in additional cell lines derived from
prostate and mammary gland (not shown). These observations indicate that MarvelD3 is expressed in different
epithelial cell types.
The MarvelD3 antibody was found to recognise only
human MarvelD3 and recognises both isoforms; hence,
we used reverse transcription PCR to determine expression of MarvelD3 isoforms in different cultured epithelial

and endothelial cell lines, as well as different tissues. Fig.
3A shows that both isoforms are widely expressed by different epithelial and endothelial cells. Similarly, most
tested adult mouse tissues expressed both isoforms (Fig
3B). Both MarvelD3 isoforms are thus widely expressed
and are found in different types of epithelial and endothelial cells. Nevertheless, apparent differences in isoform
expression profiles were detected as, for example, both
liver and the hepatocyte-derived cell line HepG2 only
expressed isoform 1.

Localisation of MarvelD3
We next used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to
determine the localisation of MarvelD3 in epithelial cells.
As our antibody only recognises the human protein, we
used Caco-2 and HCE cells for the localisation experiments as they form well-developed junctional complexes
and are derived from two different types of epithelia. Confluent cultures of the two cell lines were fixed and processed for double immunofluorescence using the rabbit
anti-MarvelD3 antibody and a mouse monoclonal antibody against occludin. The samples were first analyzed by
epifluorescence microscopy.

Fig. 4 shows that the anti-MarvelD3 antibody stained cellcell contacts in Caco-2 (Fig. 4A) and HCE (Fig. 4B) cells.
There was also some cytoplasmic and nuclear staining.
However, the junctional staining was specific as it disappeared when MarvelD3 was depleted by RNA interference
(see below). In both cell lines, MarvelD3 and occludin colocalised, suggesting that MarvelD3 is a component of the
apical junctional complex.
We next transfected cDNAs encoding the two isoforms
into Caco-2 and MDCK cells to confirm the localisation
observed for the endogenous protein. Fig. 4C shows that
both isoforms were enriched at cell-cell contacts, supporting the staining observed for endogenous protein in panel
A. Control MDCK cells did not reveal any staining for
MarvelD3, possibly due to the species difference as the
antibody was made against a sequence of the human protein that shows little conservation in the canine protein.
Expression of N-terminally HA-tagged MarvelD3 isoforms
in Caco-2 cells also resulted in staining of cell-cell contacts
with anti-HA and anti-MarvelD3 antibodies (Fig. 4D).
These data indicate that both isoforms of MarvelD3 localise to cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells.
We next used confocal microscopy to analyse the expression of MarvelD3 in more detail. Fig. 5A and 5B show that
MarvelD3 and occludin co-localised at cell junctions in
Caco-2 (Fig. 5A) and HCE cells (Fig. 5B) and in the same
focal plane (note that the staining patterns of the two proteins enter and leave the focal plane at the same sites). In
contrast, MarvelD3 and the adherens junction marker Ecadherin localised in different focal planes (Fig. 5C). The
concentration of MarvelD3 at the apical end of the lateral
membrane together with occludin, apical to the lateral Ecadherin staining, was also observed in z-projections
reconstituted from serial z line scans (Fig. 5D and 5E).
These data thus demonstrate that MarvelD3 co-localises
with occludin, but not E-cadherin, at the junctional complex, indicating specific association with tight junctions.

Functional characterisation of MarvelD3 at the tight
junction
To begin to address a functional role of MarvelD3 at the
tight junction, we used siRNA to deplete MarvelD3 and
looked for the effects this had on the localisation and
expression levels of other protein constituents of the apical junctional complex. Efficient knockdown of MarvelD3
was achieved with a pool of siRNAs as well as the two
individual siRNAs identified above (Fig. 6A). Depletion of
MarvelD3 on immunoblots was mirrored by the absence
of junctional staining by immunofluorescence (Fig. 6B),
indicating that knockdown of MarvelD3 was sufficient to
efficiently deplete the junctional pools of MarvelD3.

We next tested whether depletion of MarvelD3 affected
expression levels of other junctional proteins. Expression
of the tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-1, GEFH1, ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3, and the adherens junction
proteins E-cadherin and β-catenin remained unchanged
(Fig. 6C). We were not able to detect tricellulin using an
available commercial antibody. Similarly, immunofluorescence analysis did not reveal any effects of MarvelD3
depletion on the distribution of other junctional proteins
(Fig. 6D: shown is occludin). Although we cannot exclude
minor alterations based on these data, depletion of
MarvelD3 does not seem to affect the overall distribution
of major junctional components.

Caco-2 cells grown on filters (A, C, D, E) and HCE (B) cells
grown on coverslips were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence with the indicated antibodies. The samples
were then analyzed by confocal microscopy. Panels A, B, and
C are xy sections, and D and E are reconstitutions of serial z
line scans. In panels A and C, two sections from different
samples are shown that were both taken at the interface
between the tight and adherens junctions to facilitate comparison between the two different labels in each specimen.
Note, occludin and MarvelD3 tightly follow each other in and
out of the focal plane. Bars, 10 μm.

An important function of tight junctions is the generation
of a tight seal between neighbouring cells of the monolayer, which restricts the movement of ions and solutes
through the paracellular pathway [1]. To determine
whether or not MarvelD3 plays a role in the assembly of
the barrier or in the regulation of ion permeability, we
compared the TER of monolayers formed by control
Caco-2 cells with those formed by Caco-2 cells depleted of
MarvelD3. To follow assembly and monolayer formation
of the junction, cells were seeded first on plastic for transfection of the siRNA. 24 hours after transfection, the cells
were re-plated onto permeable supports either in normal
tissue culture medium (direct plating) or at low Ca2+ concentrations, which are insufficient to support junction formation. Junction assembly was then initiated 24 hours
after plating by switching the cells to normal Ca2+ concentrations (Ca2+ switch) [45], by which time depletion had
already occurred. The monolayers were followed for a further 48 hours by measuring TER and then analysed for
protein expression and paracellular tracer permeability.
Fig. 7A shows that MarvelD3 was still efficiently depleted
at the end of the incubation period. Similarly, no effects
on monolayer morphology and localisation of junctional
proteins were observed (Fig. 7B: shown are occludin and
ZO-1). TER measurements revealed that formation of

functional tight junctions still occurred at similar kinetics
as in control cells (Fig. 8A). However, MarvelD3 depleted
cells reached higher resistance values. Determination of
tracer permeability using 4 kD and 70 kD fluorescent dextrans did not suggest any defects in barrier formation or
significant alterations in tracer diffusion (Fig. 8B). Cells
that were directly plated in normal medium, and were
hence 24 hours longer in normal Ca2+ medium, also
formed functional tight junctions and reached stable TER
values by the end of the incubation time (Fig. 8C and 8D).
As the Ca2+switch cells, directly plated MarvelD3 depleted
cells had reached 25% higher electrical resistance values
than control cells.
Taken together, these results indicate that MarvelD3
depletion does not affect the formation of functional tight
junctions, but that MarvelD3 levels are a determinant of
paracellular ion conductivity.

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that MarvelD3, a four-pass
transmembrane protein, co-localises with the tight junction protein occludin, apical to the adherens junction protein E-cadherin, indicating that MarvelD3 is a third tight
junction-associated Marvel domain protein. A functional
analysis using RNA interference-mediated depletion indicates that MarvelD3 is not essential for junction assembly
and the formation of a functional paracellular diffusion
barrier, but the observed increase in TER in depleted cells
indicates that MarvelD3 is a determinant of paracellular
ion permeability.
Our data demonstrate that MarvelD3 associates with the
junctional complex of intestinal and corneal epithelial
cells, and its expression was detected in multiple mouse

tissues and cultured epithelial and endothelial cell lines.
MarvelD3 thus seems to be a widely expressed protein and
hence likely to be a component of tight junctions with different functional properties.
MarvelD3 is expressed as two isoforms and both were
recruited to the cell periphery in transfected cells in a manner similar to the endogenous protein, suggesting that
both isoforms associate with junctions. Our attempts to
generate isoform-specific antibodies, which are required
to study endogenously expressed isoforms at the protein
level, have so far failed. Based on reverse transcription
PCR results, however, both isoforms seem to be widely
expressed. An aim of future studies will be to differentiate
between MarvelD3 isoforms at the protein level and to
determine whether there are any isoform-specific differences in expression, localisation and/or function, as has
been suggested for occludin [46,47].
Occludin and tricellulin not only localise to tight junctions, but have been shown to associate with the junctional intramembrane strands observed in freeze fracture
replicas [27,48]. It will thus be important to determine
whether MarvelD3 also associates with these structures
and whether the Marvel domain, which is found in all
three proteins, is important for strand association [42].
The Marvel domain is found in proteins such as MAL that
are thought to associate with cholesterol-rich microdomains in cell membranes [42]. As occludin has previously
also been shown to associate with cholesterol-rich microdomains [49], it is possible that Marvel domain proteins
affect tight junctions via such membrane microdomains.
At present, however, the precise role of cholesterol in tight
junctions is not clear [50-52].

as indicated. The amount of dextran diffused to the basolateral side of the monolayer was normalised against the average value
obtained from control cells. Shown are averages ± 1SD of quadruplicate samples of a typical experiment. The indicated p values
were obtained with a t-test comparing knockdown with control values; in panel A, the p values refer to the final TER values.

in panel B obtained for single siRNA transfections were neither statistically significant nor did they reflect a trend observed in
other experiments. However, final TER values were elevated in both culture conditions in all performed experiments.

Given the membrane morphology of the tight junction in
which the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane becomes
closely apposed to that of an adjacent cell, proteins with
potential properties to influence close membrane/membrane contacts, such as Marvel domain proteins, may
prove of significant interest in understanding the structure
and function of tight junctions. Tricellulin has been suggested to play a structural role in tricellular corners, which
would be compatible with a role in forming and/or stabilising membrane/membrane contacts [27,39]. Surprisingly, however, the analysis of patients carrying tricellulin
mutations has so far only revealed defects in the cochlea
and not other organs [38]. In the case of occludin, depletion and knockout experiments as well as expression studies with dominant mutations have thus far not suggested
a role in tight junction structure [28,34,37,53]. However,
it has recently been reported that depletion of occludin
results in a more even distribution of tricellulin along the
entire junctional length [41]. Hence, different Marvel
domain proteins may be able to compensate for each
other. With this in mind, it will be important to design
approaches to study Marvel domain proteins as a whole
and to elucidate a function for the Marvel domain itself.
Depletion of MarvelD3 in Caco-2 cells resulted in an
increase in TER but did not affect permeability to fluorescent dextran tracers. Since occludin overexpression was
previously observed to increase TER [28], we wondered
whether the increased TER observed in the present study
could be attributable to elevated levels of occludin expression. Immunoblotting cell lysates from MarvelD3 knockdown cells however showed occludin levels, as well as
levels of ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3, to be unchanged. Neither
did we observe any significant changes in the distribution
of these proteins by immunofluorescence. However, at
this point it cannot be excluded that more subtle changes
in occludin distribution might have caused the increase in
TER. Occludin knockdown has been shown to reduce
expression levels of claudins 1 and 7 and increase levels of
claudins 3 and 4 in MDCK cells [37]. Given the importance of claudin family members for paracellular ion permeability [12-14], it is possible that MarvelD3 depletion
affected claudin expression or function; though we have
not been able to detect differences in claudin-1 expression. However, it is possible that other claudins are
affected or that claudin activity is regulated by MarvelD3.
MarvelD3 shows distant structural similarity to occludin.
Occludin and tricellulin are located in tandem on human
chromosome 5 and it has been speculated that they may
have arisen from gene duplication during phylogenetic
evolution [27]. In contrast, MarvelD3 is located on chromosome 16 but is also expressed by all vertebrates,
including birds, fish, amphibians and mammals. In contrast to occludin and tricellulin, all known isoforms and
variants of MarvelD3 have short C-terminal cytoplasmic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/10/95

domains that are also distinct from each other. It is therefore unlikely that they are able to interact with ZO-1 as
those of occludin and tricellulin do [38,43]. In contrast,
the N-terminal domain of MarvelD3, which is shared by
both isoforms, is long in comparison to that of occludin.
Intriguingly, the N-terminal domain of MarvelD3 is not as
well conserved as the rest of the protein; however, it contains regions that are better conserved than others, which
might be of functional relevance. In the case of occludin,
this domain is thought to have a regulatory function and
interacts with a ubiquitin ligase [32,54]. As the N-terminal
domains of tight junction-associated Marvel domain proteins are distinct in length and structure, they might provide structural links to different types of junctional
regulatory mechanisms.

Conclusions
Our experiments identify MarvelD3 as a novel member of
the occludin family, a subgroup of the Marvel domain
proteins. MarvelD3 is expressed as two isoforms that
show a broad tissue distribution. Similarly to occludin,
normal MarvelD3 expression is not essential for tight
junction formation. Nevertheless, knockdown of
MarvelD3 affects the paracellular barrier properties of
tight junctions by mechanisms that still have to be identified. Tight junctions and occludin have not only been
linked to epithelial barrier functions but also to the signalling mechanisms that guide epithelial proliferation and
differentiation [33,55,56]. Hence future studies will not
only have to address the precise roles of MarvelD3 and
other family members in tight junction structure and permeability properties, but also in the regulation of the subcellular signalling mechanisms that guide epithelial
proliferation, differentiation and tissue formation.

Methods
Cell culture
Caco-2, HCE, MDCK, HaCaT, HepG2 cells were grown in
DMEM (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) with 10% (HCE, MDCK,
HaCaT, HepG2) or 20% (Caco-2) foetal bovine serum
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) [7,57,58]. PNT-1a and PNT2-c2
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with glutamine and 10% foetal bovine serum,
ARPE-19 cells in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Nutrient
Mixture F12 containing 10% foetal bovine serum and Lglutamine, hCMEC/D3 in EGM-2 medium (Cambrex BioScience, Wokingham, UK), and HCEC-B4G12 in human
Endothelial-SFM containing 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK). All cell lines were grown in the presence of
penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Antibodies
A rabbit anti-MarvelD3 antibody was generated against a
peptide with the sequence CAPDRGPRRDTHRDAG and
was affinity purified using the same peptide coupled to

epoxy-activated sepharose beads. Antibodies against the
following proteins were as previously described or were
from commercial sources: ZO-1, -2, -3 and GEF-H1 [59];
α-tubulin [60]; β-catenin (Sigma Aldrich and Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); occludin, tricellulin and claudin-1 (Invitrogen); and E-cadherin (BD Biosciences); HA-epitope
[61].
Immunofluorescence
Caco-2 or HCE cells were grown on glass coverslips or filters, as specified, for at least 3 days and then processed for
immunofluorescence as described [28,53]. Briefly, cells
were either fixed directly in methanol or first extracted on
ice with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 minute and then fixed in
methanol at -20°C for 10 minutes. Cells were rehydrated
in PBS for 5 minutes and blocked for 15 minutes with
0.5% BSA in PBS (PBS-BSA). Coverslips were incubated
with primary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature,
washed three times with PBS-BSA and incubated with secondary antibody and Hoechst nuclear stain for 1 hour at
room temperature. Filters were incubated in primary antibody overnight at room temperature in a moist atmosphere, washed three times with PBS-BSA and incubated in
secondary antibody with Hoechst for 1.5 hours at room
temperature. Coverslips and filters were then washed two
times with PBS-BSA and once with PBS before being
mounted onto glass microscope slides with ProLong Gold
mounting medium (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). Images
were acquired using a Leica Image capture epifluorescent
microscope and a Zeiss LSM510UV confocal microscope
with 63× oil immersion lenses. Brightness and contrast
were adjusted with Adobe Photoshop CS4 software.
cDNAs
cDNAs coding for full length untagged MarvelD3 isoforms were generated by PCR from reverse transcribed
Caco-2 total RNA and from an EST clone obtained form
Geneservice Source BioScience plc. The PCR fragments
were cloned into pcDNA4-TOmychisB expression vector
either as untagged versions or with a N-terminal HA-tag.
The resulting cDNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into Caco-2 and MDCK
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and analysed
after 48 hours.
siRNAs
For knockdown studies, Caco-2 and HCE cells were transfected with individual or a pool of siRNAs (MD3psiRNA). The following MarvelD3-specific siRNAs were
used (5' to 3' direction): siRNA13, GCGCAGGTGAACACGGAGT;
siRNA14,
GAGAGGAGGTGGAATATTA; siRNA15, CCGGAGAGAGACCAGGAGA;
siRNA16, GCCGCAGACCCGAAAGTGA. All four target
sequences are found in the N-terminus common to both
isoforms of MarvelD3 (Thermo Scientific, Dharmacon).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/10/95

Used were On-Target plus siRNAs along with control OnTarget plus siRNAs from the same provider. For transfections, Interferin transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Expression was then analysed between two
and four days after transfection. Efficient knockdown was
achieved with a total final siRNA concentration of 100
nM.
Immunoblotting
Whole cell lysates were collected by adding SDS sample
buffer (3% SDS, 15% glycerol, 0.0015% bromophenol
blue, 0.25 M Tris HCl containing 150 mM DTT and 6 M
Urea) to samples pre-washed once in PBS. The samples
were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and
were then homogenised through a 25G needle before
analysis by SDS-PAGE. MarvelD3 protein levels were
detected with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham, Corp. Arlington
Heights, IL). All other protein levels were detected using
an Odyssey detector and IRDye-680- and IRDye-800CWconjugated donkey anti-rabbit and donkey anti-mouse
secondary antibodies (LI-COR).
Reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated from tissues and cultured cells
using standard procedures [62,63]. Reverse transcription
was performed at 45°C using AMV reverse transcriptase
(Promega Corp, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) for 1 hour. A
sample of HUVEC cDNA generated from total RNA was
kindly provided by Jay Stone (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK). The indicated cDNAs were then
amplified by PCR using FastStart Taq polymerase (Roche
Diagnostics Ltd.) and an annealing temperature of 63°C.
The following primers were used (5' to 3' direction):
human MarvelD3 AAAAATCTAGATCAAAGAG TTCCAGACCACAG and AAAAATCTAGATTAAAATTCAAACATTTCTGCTGG
for
reverse
transcription,
and
AAAAAGCTAGCAAATACTTGTGCACTGGGAGAG,

amplification; mouse MarvelD3 CACAAATGCAGATACTTGTGCACAGG,
CTAAAACTCAAGCATTTCTGTGGGC, TTAGAGCGTCCCGGACCACAGGTA; GAPDH
(human and mouse) ATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGAC and
ATGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTT.
Paracellular permeability and TER measurements
Caco-2 cells were transfected with control, pool or individual siRNAs against MarvelD3 in six well plates. The day
after transfection, cells were trypsinised and plated at confluent density on Transwell filters (Corning Inc., Corning,
NY) in quadruplicates, either in low calcium medium, for
Ca2+ switch, or directly into complete DMEM. After 24

hours, the medium was changed for fresh complete
DMEM and cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes
before starting to measure TER. TER was recorded every 2
hours for the first 12 hours, then at 24, 36 and 48 hours
by applying an AC square wave current of ± 20 μA at 12.5
Hz with a silver electrode and measuring the voltage
deflection elicited with a silver/silver-chloride electrode
using an EVOM (World Precision Instruments), as previously described [28]. To measure paracellular flux, 1
hours before the experiment, medium was replaced with
1000 μl complete DMEM on the basolateral side and 250
μl on the apical side and the cells returned to 37°C. Tracer
solution containing 4 kD FITC-dextran and 70 kD Rhodamine-B-dextran was added to the apical side and incubated at 37°C for 4 hours [64]. 200 μl samples were
collected from the basolateral side and fluorescence was
determined using a microplate reader. Fluorescence of the
apical solutions was used to determine total values.
