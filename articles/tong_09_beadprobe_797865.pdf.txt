Abstract
Background: Short and long interspersed elements (SINEs and LINEs, respectively), two types of
retroposons, are active in shaping the architecture of genomes and powerful tools for studies of
phylogeny and population biology. Here we developed special protocol to apply biotin-streptavidin
bead system into isolation of interspersed repeated sequences rapidly and efficiently, in which
SINEs and LINEs were captured directly from digested genomic DNA by hybridization to beadprobe complex in solution instead of traditional strategy including genomic library construction and
screening.
Results: A new couple of SINEs and LINEs that shared an almost identical 3'tail was isolated and
characterized in silver carp and bighead carp of two closely related species. These SINEs (34
members), designated HAmo SINE family, were little divergent in sequence and flanked by obvious
TSD indicated that HAmo SINE was very young family. The copy numbers of this family was
estimated to 2 × 105 and 1.7 × 105 per haploid genome by Real-Time qPCR, respectively. The
LINEs, identified as the homologs of LINE2 in other fishes, had a conserved primary sequence and
secondary structures of the 3'tail region that was almost identical to that of HAmo SINE. These
evidences suggest that HAmo SINEs are active and amplified recently utilizing the enzymatic
machinery for retroposition of HAmoL2 through the recognition of higher-order structures of the
conserved 42-tail region. We analyzed the possible structures of HAmo SINE that lead to
successful amplification in genome and then deduced that HAmo SINE, SmaI SINE and FokI SINE
that were similar in sequence each other, were probably generated independently and created by
LINE family within the same lineage of a LINE phylogeny in the genomes of different hosts.
Conclusion: The presented results show the advantage of the novel method for retroposons
isolation and a pair of young SINE family and its partner LINE family in two carp fishes, which
strengthened the hypotheses containing the slippage model for initiation of reverse transcription,
retropositional parasitism of SINEs on LINEs, the formation of the stem loop structure in 3'tail
region of some SINEs and LINEs and the mechanism of template switching in generating new SINE
family.

Background
SINE and LINE are interspersed nucleotide repeats distributed widely in eukaryotic genomes and occupy a substantial fraction of genome. For example, Alu and LINE1
constitute more than 13% and 20% of human genome,
respectively [1]. They proliferate and replicate themselves
through a "copy and paste" mechanism called retroposition involving transcription of their genomic copies followed by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate
and resulting cDNAs reintegration at a new location into
the genome host [2-5]. Therefore, SINE and LINE,
together with processed pseudogenes, are classified as retrotransposons [6].
Many biologists are interested and make great effort to
isolate and characterize many retroposons (LINE and
SINE) in various organisms, because it is an indispensable
step for addressing the question that how they originate
and evolve as well as their functioning and impact on the
evolution of eukaryotic genomes. So far, over 100 LINE
and nearly 100 SINE families have been described to date
in various eukaryotic genomes [7]. Moreover, retroposons
insertions have proven to be nearly perfect tools for studies of phylogeny and population biology [8,9] and have
been successfully used to resolve phylogenetic relationships among various groups of different taxonomic rank
[10-15]. Especially so far SINEs appear to have gained
novel functions, acting for example as enhancers or silencers that regulate the expression of preexisting functional
genes [16-18].
Currently methods allowing for isolation of SINE and
LINE from an unknown genome mostly depend on construction of genomic library and subsequently screening
by colony hybridization method using probe specific to
particular region of repeated elements. Here we propose
and describe a new strategy and method used to isolate
SINEs and LINEs rapidly, in which library construction
and screening is completely eliminated. This method is
based on hybridization capture of repetitive elements
from digested genomic DNA in solution using biotinylated oligonucleotide probes which have been preattached to streptavidin magnetic beads. Subsequently,
the captured probe-target DNA fragment complex immobilized on the magnetic beads were selected and separated
from other non-complementary fragments by magnetic
separation, then released and amplified by adapter
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), finally the PCR products enriched for SINE and LINE were cloned directly into
T-vector for sequencing. The whole procedure was completed within only about a week.
LINEs are approximately 4–7 kilobase pair (kbp) in length
and encode an endonuclease (EN) and a reverse transcriptase (RT), both of which are required for LINE retrotransposition [19]. Luan et al.[20] proposed the "target-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/83

primed reverse transcription" (TPRT) as the mechanism of
LINE retrotransposition, in which the LINE EN creates a
nick in the DNA of the host genome and the RT synthesizes cDNA in situ using a 3' OH of the DNA generated by
the nick as a primer. In contrast, SINEs are relatively short
(about 100–500 bp) and non-autonomous retroposons
without ORFs and so lack the machinery to replicate
themselves. It is suggested that SINE has recruited the
enzymatic machinery for retroposition from the corresponding LINE through the common "tail"sequence
[19,20], based on the observation that the sequences of
many couple of SINE and LINE pairs isolated from many
organisms were similar in their 3'end regions [21-24].
This scenario is supported by recent experiments of retrotransposition assay of eel UnaL2 and human LINE1.
UnaL2 can strictly recognize a specific sequence at their
3'tail and mobilize transcript that has the 3' tail of
UnaSINE1 [25,26], whereas Human LINE L1 can mobilize human SINE Alu via the poly A tail (no such 3'endspecific region) at the 3'end [27,28].
The template switch during TPRT was proposed as possible mechanism to explain the formation of chimeric retrotranscripts from a full copy of U6 small nuclear RNA
fused to the 3'terminus of L1 [29-31] and the observation
that several SINE families have a common 5' half
sequence but different 3'tails [32,33]. So maybe the process of how SINE acquired the tail of partner LINE also
resulted from the template switch between LINE and
other RNA of SINE-to-be during TPRT [21,29,34].
The two closely related species of East Asian cyprinids, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp
(Aristichthys nobilis), are believed to have origined recently
[35]. In the present paper, we successfully use magneticbead based system to isolate SINE and LINE in this two
species by developing special protocol. The data show that
the designated HAmoSINE family was successfully proliferated recently through borrowing the enzymatic machinery of partner LINEs for retrotransposition in the two
genomes. After comparison and detail analysis, we
deduced that the HAmo SINE, SmaI SINE and FokI SINE
that are similar in sequence with each other, were probably generated independently through the switch template
between the LINE2 and RNA of SINE-to-be in respective
genome because of an existence of no-similar central
region between them. At last, the advantages of this new
method and possibility of combining with other protocols are provided.

Methods
DNA extraction
All species DNA was isolated from ethanol-fixed tissues
(fins or muscle) by incubation with proteinase K followed
by phenol/chloroform extraction [36].

Preliminary PCR to detect and identify SINE
AB-PCR was performed in silver carp and bighead carp as
described elsewhere [37]. The reaction mixture (100 μl)
contained 10 ng of genomic DNA and two 12-nucleotide
primers ("A": 5'-TRGCTCAGTGGT-3', "B":5'-GGRATYGAACYC-3') specific to A and B boxes of RNA pol III promoter consensus, respectively. After 27 PCR cycles (95°C,
1 min; 34°C, 1 min; 72°C, 30s), the amplified ~55 bp
DNA fragments were isolated by electrophoresis in 5%
agarose gel.

Inverse PCR was carried out in silver carp as with modification of the method described elsewhere [38]. A pair of
inverse primers: primer IF, primer IR (Figure 1, Additional
file 1) was designed according to consensus sequence of
AB-PCR fragments in silver carp and bighead carp. In
brief, HaeIII-digested genomic DNA fragments were selfcircularized in a final concentration of 5 ng/μl in a 100 μl
ligation reaction. Inverse PCR (94°C, 1 min; 52°C, 1 min;
72°C, 2 min) was carried out using the 100 ng of above
circularized DNA as template. The resulting smear fragments were cloned and sequenced.
A pair of primers (primer ItF, primer ItR, Figure 1) corresponding to internal region of SINE was used to detect
many individual SINE copies. The PCR was run in a total
volume of 20 μl including 200 ng DNA template with 25
cycles of 95°C 40s, 62°C 40s, 72°C 40s. Nine clones were
selected randomly and sequenced. The clone Hmo41_It
was used as probe to conduct the next retroposons enrichment strategy.
Retroposons Enrichment Strategy
A. Preparation of genomic pool
1) Digestion of genomic DNA
Approximately 40 mg of genomic DNA was completely
digested with HaeIII (20 U/μl, Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) overnight in a total volume of 100 μl. The fragmented DNA were subsequently separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose. Fragments ranging from 700–
2000 bp were purified from the gel using gel extraction kit
(Omega) and finally suspended in 40 μl of H2O.
2) Ligation of adapters
The adapter oligoA (5 P'-GGCAGGATCCACTGAATTCGC3') and oligoB (5'-AGCGAATTCAGTGGATCCTGCC-3')
were annealed by heating an equal volume of 10 μM oligonucleotides for 3 min at 95°C, 2 min at 65°C, 2 min at
45°C, 1 min at 25°C, conserved at 4°C. The annealed
product is a double-stranded linker of which one end is
blunt while the other has a 3' A overhang. Additionally,
the oligoA was phosphorylated at the 5' base during manufacturing. Excess of annealed linkers were ligated to
above 40 μl of prepared HaeIII-fragmented DNA (approximate 4 μg) in a 100 μl reaction containing 2 μM doublestranded linkers, l× ligase buffer, 20 units T4 DNA ligase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/83

(Fermentas, MBI), 10 μl 50% PEG4000. The reaction proceeded overnight at 22°C, and then purified through
Takara column and resuspend in 150 μl H2O.
3) PCR enrichment
Set up 20 PCR reactions with 28 μL ddH2O, 4.0 μL 10 mM
dNTP's, 5 μL 10× PCR Buffer, 10 μL of the 2 μM oligo B
primer and 0.5 μL of Taq each. Then add 1 μL of the linker
ligation product to each PCR tube. The PCR reaction profile began with a 5 min 72°C filling in the nick between
each linker and size fraction fragment left by the ligation
step, then followed by 12 cycles of 95°C for 45s, 55°C for
45s, 72°C for 1 min 50 s. A 10 min extension step concluded the reaction. Then the total 20 tube PCR products
were purified using 3–4 columns column in order not to
overload the columns and finally resuspended in 150 μL
H2O. The reason for doing the 16–24 separate PCR reaction at only 12 cycles is to maintain the complexity of the
linker ligation mixture. Otherwise, a lot of identical clones
would produce in the end. Before being used, the pool
must be heat-denatured at 95°C for 10 min to make target
single-strand DNA accessible to probe.
B. Preparation of bead-probe complex
1) Probe biotinylation
Plasmid Hmo41_It corresponding to an internal region
(18–144 bp) of an individual SINE was used as template
to be biotinylated. In order to label one biotin at one terminus of the DNA fragment, we used the primers (primer
ItF, ItR) with only primer ItF biotinylated to perform PCR.
At last, the double strand PCR DNA with one strand biotinylated was purified in 100 μL H2O. Before bound to
beads, the double strand biotinylated probe must be
denatured at 95°C for 10 min.
2) Probe bound to beads
Following the manufacturer's recommendation, 200 μL of
Streptavidin Magnetic Particles (10 mg/ml, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was collected by removing the storage
buffer then washed three times with 300 μL binding
buffer TEN100 (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM
NaCl, pH 7.5) for 5 min. Each time remove the supernatant using magnetic particle concentrator.

Above 100 μL denatured probe is added to beads of 300
μL binding buffer TEN100, then incubate for 30 min at
room temperature to specifically bind the biotinylated
strand, then removed supernatant containing non-biotinylated DNA strands followed by washing two times for 5
min with TEN100, then the preparation of the single
strand probe-beads complex is accomplished.
C. Capture of target sequences
1) Hybridization
The beads were washed once with 200 μL of hybridization
buffer (5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 5 min, then 150 μL of

buffer (10 × SSC 0.2% SDS, preheated to 55°C) and 150
μL above denatured genomic pool were added to resuspend the beads followed by hybridization in 55°C for 2
hours, then non-complementary sequences were removed
by washing successively with 400 μL TEN1000 (10 mM
Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1000 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) three
times for 5 min; 400 μL buffer (0.2*SSC,0.1%SDS) three
time for 5 min; 400 μL TEN1000 for 10 min, all these
washing are conducted at room temperature, finally target
DNA were release from the beads by elution at 95°C for 5
min in 50 μL H2O.
2) Adapter PCR
Set up separate 4 PCR reactions with 14 μL ddH2O, 2.0 μL
10 mM dNTPs, 2.5 μL 10× PCR Buffer, 5 μL of the 2 μM
Er1Bh1Blunt primer and 0.5 μL of Taq polymerase each.
Then add 1 μL of the linker ligation product to each PCR
tube. The PCR reaction profile began with a 5 min 94°C
then followed by 15 cycles of 95°C for 45s, 55°C for 45s,
72°C for 1 min 50 s. A 10 min extension step concluded
the reaction. Then the total 4 tube PCR products were
purified for cloning.
3) Cloning and Positive detection
The enriched PCR products were ligated directly into Tvector (Takara) using T4 DNA ligase, taking advantage of
the 3'A overhangs often produced by Taq polymerase.
Colony PCR amplification were performed directly on
many single bacterial colony to determine the size of individual inserts, then select at random and sequence many
clones in which inserted fragments were longer than 700
bp.
Quantification of HAmo SINE copy number in two
genomes using Quantitative Real Time-PCR
Plasmid Hmo41_It corresponding to one individual copy
of HAmo SINE and Genomic DNA of silver carp and bighead carp were prepared as standard and sample for RealTime PCR, respectively. Then, concentration of them were
measured using spectrophotometer and five-fold serial
dilutions of them were prepared respectively as templates
to perform Real-Time PCR in a PCR machine (Bio-Rad,
Chromo4) one time. All Real-Time PCR reactions was performed with 40 cycles at 95°C 40s, 62°C 40s, 72°C 40s
including Primer ItF and ItR (300 nM final concentration)
and SYBR GREEN in a final volume of 25 μL. At last, a
melting curve analysis was done after the amplification
phase. The standard curve and data analysis were carried
out in the software MJ Opticon Monitor 3.1.
Characterization of HAmo LINE family
To determine the 5' upstream sequence from a breakpoint
at the HaeIII site of the HAmo LINE, we employed the
method of genomic DNA walking in which TAIL-PCR
(thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR) was conducted
using one arbitrary degenerate prime provided by kit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/83

(Takara) and special primer designed according to the
consensus of HaeIII-fragmented LINEs. The whole PCR
processes are conducted according to manufacture's
instruction and the last PCR products were cloned and
sequenced.

Results
Preliminary PCR to detect and identify SINE
AB-PCR was amplified with very small amount of
genomic DNA as a template and two oligonucleotides
specific to boxes A and B of the promoter of RNA polymerase III as primers as described elsewhere [37]. Among
many AB-PCR clones, we obtained some high similar
sequences in two closely related species, silver carp and
bighead carp, respectively (Figure 1A). The similar but not
identical AB-PCR sequences and intact A box and B box,
together with its reasonable sequence similarity to certain
tRNAs (see below) indicated that they may have been
amplified from different SINE copies of one same SINE
family in the above two species.

To amplify the regions flanking AB-PCR fragment and test
whether the above AB-PCR fragments belong to a part of
a certain SINEs as we expected, a pair of primer: primer IvF
and IvR which face in opposite orientations and correspond to consensus sequences of AB-PCR was designed to
perform inverse PCR in silver carp (Figure 1A, Additional
file 1). The whole procedure including recovery of origin
sequence is shown schematically and described in Additional file 1. 7 of the recovered original sequences of
inverse PCR shared a high similar region possessing characteristic features of typical SINEs, including LINE2related region followed by short tandem repeats
(TAAATG), but they differed in their flanking regions
which indicate they may represent different retroposon
locus (Figure 1B). These significant evidences implied that
the shared region may be SINE and provided us a preliminary window to see the full structure of SINE.
In order to get the probe specific to the SINE for the next
new non-library retroposons enrichment method, we
designed a pair of primer (primer ItF, primer ItR) corresponding to the internal region of SINE to detect many
individual SINE copies (Figure 1C). Nine clones selected
by random show little sequence divergence indicate that
this SINE family may be a young family. At last we
selected plasmid Hmo41_It to be biotinylated as probe
for the non-library enrichment strategy.
Non-library Retroposons Enrichment Strategy
The Non-library Retroposons Enrichment Strategy has
been conducted using plasmid Hmo41_It corresponding
to the internal region of an individual SINE copy as probe
to directly capture the HaeIII-fragmented genomic DNA
containing the SINE sequence in solution. The whole procedure was schemed in Figure 2 and described in the MatePage 5 of 15

rials and Methods section. The entire isolation procedure
can be completed in about a week. Every important phase
can be monitored by the electrophoresis (Figure 3). At
last, captured specific DNA fragments were cloned and
sequenced and most of them were 700–1100 bp in length
(Figure 3). In this case, the efficiency of the non-library
strategy reaches nearly 60% by calculating the ratio of
unique positive clones (Additional file 2). Finally, 51 and
29 SINE loci are determined in silver carp and bighead
carp, respectively. Simultaneously, 28 LINE elements
(HaeIII-fragmented LINEs and 5' truncated LINEs) were
isolated in the final products, because the probe contained an about 40 bp tail region shared by SINE and
LINE.
Identification of young SINE family in silver carp and
bighead carp
Using the above non-library enrichment method, we isolated and characterized a new SINE family containing 21
and 13 members from silver carp and bighead carp,
respectively. We designated it HAmo SINE family for combining Hmo (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and Amo (Aristichthys mobilis). The consensus sequence of HAmo SINE is
150 bp in length and identical in the two species, which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/83

has typical structure of SINEs: a tRNALys-related promoter
region at their 5'-end, a unique central family-specific
region and an end with LINE2-derived 3'-terminus preceding the short tandem repeats TAAATG (Figure 4, 5).
We cannot find enough diagnostic nucleotides to divide
them into subfamily, and only clone 65 in silver carp and
clone 599 in bighead carp shared a common A9 insertion
in the tRNA-unrelated region. Almost all members in silver carp (except clone1093 with uncompleted 5'
sequence) and 7 out of 13 members in bighead carp are
flanked by obvious TSD (target site duplications), which
are thought to have been produced during retrotransposition. The small sequence divergence among the members
of HAmo SINE and SD show that this SINE family seems
to be very young and proliferated very recently
The HAmo SINE 5' End is derived from tRNA
BlastN homology search revealed that the tRNA-related
region of the HAmo family was most similar to tRNALys in
Rabbit (83%, not counting the acceptor stem)[39] and
showed equal similarity (80%) to tRNALys in Rat, chicken,
mouse, Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. When compared the predicted secondary structure

Figure 3 phases monitored by Gel electrophoresis in the retroposons enrichment strategy in silver carp (A) and bighead carp
(B)
Important
Important phases monitored by Gel electrophoresis in the retroposons enrichment strategy in silver carp (A)
and bighead carp (B). 1. Step Digestion of genomic DNA. HaeIII can cleave the genomic DNA and generate size fragments
evenly (< 4 Kb). 2. Step PCR enrichment. 30 cycles of step PCR enrichment detected the size range of PCR-enriched HaeIII-fragmented DNA, and finally, after being optimized, only 12 cycles of the PCR enrichment was conducted for maintaining the complexity of DNA molecules. The enriched HaeIII-fragmented pool was manly ranging from 500–2000 bp. 3. Step Adapter PCR. 30
cycles of Adapter PCR detected the size of captured target fragments cloning into vector, and finally, after being optimized, only
15 cycles was done to keep the complexity of DNA molecules.

between the tRNA-derived region of HAmo family and
Rabbit tRNALys (Figure 6), we found a feature that they
have no homology in the acceptor stem region, which also
happened to tRNALys-derived SmaI family [40]. However,
the significant homology in secondary structures and the
numbers of nucleotides in the stem and loop structures
suggested that the tRNALys species was the most likely candidate for the origin of HAmo SINEs. The obvious conservation of secondary structure in tRNA-related regions
including conserved A and B boxes of the split promoter
in HAmo SINE manifested their functional importance
for transcription by polymerase III.
Characterization of partner LINE family of HAmo SINE in
silver carp and bighead carp
Many isolated clones contain a region only matched to 3'
tail of HAmo SINE probe (plasmid Hmo41_It) in the
genomes of silver carp and bighead carp when isolating
HAmo SINE. After Blast search and alignment of these
sequences of clones, we characterize them as 5'HaeIII fragmented and 5' truncated LINEs, which are homologs
of CR1-2_DR in zebrafish. We designated these LINEs as
HAmo LINE, since possibly they encode RTase responsible for retrotransposition of HAmo SINE through recognition of the common 3'tail conserved in nucleotide
sequences and secondary structure (see next).

In order to determine the 5' upstream sequence from a
breakpoint at the HaeIII site of these LINEs, we employed

the genomic DNA walking method to determine many
sequences of clones containing 5'-truncated partial LINE
(see Additional file 3). At last, a consensus sequence of
1296 bp was deduced, corresponding to partial ORF that
encode RTase and 3' UTR. The predicted partial amino
acid sequences encoded by HAmo LINE are 72% identical
to that of CR1-2_DR and homologous to that of other
LINE2 (Figure 7).
Eickbush's group divided all identified LINEs into 11 distinct clades based on an extended sequence alignment of
their RT domains [41]. Recently a novel L2 clade is well
separated from the CR1 clade which is widely distributed
in eukaryotic genomes such as vertebrates, echinoderms
and insects [24,42]. When HAmo LINE sequence was
added into analysis, the phylogenetic tree shows that
HAmo LINE was most close to zebrafish CR1-2_DR and
constituted a monophyletic group with zebrafish CR12_DR, salmon SalL2 and eel UnaL2 in the L2 clade of
LINEs (Figure 8) [43-45]. So HAmo LINE are homolog of
other L2 in various distantly related species that diverged
over 300 million years ago [24].
The common tail conserved in primary and secondary
structures between HAmo SINE and HAmo LINE
HAmo SINE have an approximately 42-bp-long conserved
3'-tail which are almost identical to HAmo LINE and also
high similar to other SINE family and their paternal LINE
families (see next, Figure 9, Figure 10). There is only one

base different in this region between HAmo SINE and
HAmo LINE, suggesting that the conserved 3'tail of HAmo
SINE, which is important for the process of SINE retrotransposition, is derived from HAmo LINE in the same
genomes of silver carp and bighead carp.

and HAmo LINE share a hairpin region with a GGAUA
loop which is thought to be a recognition domain for the
LINE RT in UnaL2 [26,46]. So the clear and significant
homolog in the 3'-tail between HAmo SINE and their
partner HAmo LINE in primary and secondary structures

suggested the HAmo SINE may borrow the enzymatic
machinery of HAmo LINE to proliferate in the same
genome through the conserved 3' -tail.
Interestingly, short tandem repeats (TAAATG) of variable
numbers are observed in the 3'terminus of the tail in both
HAmo SINE and HAmo LINE. Most of copies have more
than one repetition of the repeat in the tail, which is probably required for the slippage reaction during reverse transcription initiation [25].

genomic DNA (sample) and plasmid Hmo41_It (standard) in Real-Time PCR. The results are summarized in
Additional file 4. We used a serial of diluted genomic
DNA as tested samples to perform PCR reaction, the final
estimations of copy numbers using different concentrated
genomic DNA template are very close, suggesting that the
result of experiment are stable and efficient. At last, average copy numbers of HAmo SINE in haploid genome of
silver carp and bighead carp were estimated to 2.22 × 105
and 1.37 × 105, respectively. Considering the possibility of
mismatch between primers with more divergent HAmo
SINE sequences, so the results of qRT-PCR were minimal
estimates of HAmo SINE copy numbers in the two
genomes of silver carp and bighead carp.

Discussion
Possible structures of HAmo SINE leading to successful
proliferation
The analysis of HAmo SINE shows that it was very young
and proliferated recently to estimated about 2 × 105 and
1.7 × 105 copy numbers in the haploid genome of silver
carp and bighead carp, respectively. In fact, most of the
SINE loci isolated in this work are species-specific or even
not fixed among fish populations when we detected the
presence or absence of SINE insertions using flanking

primers (our group, unpublished data). So HAmo SINE
are highly efficient and successfully proliferated recently
in the genome and it maybe owe to its overall structure
and internal structure as described below.
Firstly, HAmo SINE keep the overall secondary structure
and conserved A and B box in the tRNA-related region,
which ensures the RNA III recognition and transcriptional
activity of SINEs. More importantly, the irregularity of the
acceptor stem, as same as SmaI family, seems to help to
escape recognition by tRNA-processing or RNA-modifying
enzymes and therefore prevent the RNA from being
cleaved by the 3'-endonuclease.
Secondly, HAmo SINE share the almost identical 3'tail
with HAmo LINE2 in primary sequence and secondary
structures, which keep them to well utilize the LINE2
enzymatic machinery. Their shared same stem-loop
region is thought to function as a recognition site for the
UnaL2 protein (UnaL2p) when this region is transcribed
in the RNA [46].
Moreover, more than one repetition of the short tandem
repeat TAAATG appeared in most copies, which are
revealed to be necessary for successful retrotransposition

by mutational analyses in the experiments on other LINEs
of the L2 clade and the initiation of reverse transcription
of UnaL2 RNA in UnaL2 [25,28].
Thirdly, RNA structure of the HAmo SINE is obviously
composed of three parts: tRNA-related region, a familyspecific region and LINE2-related region (Figure 10), that
correspond to there parts of secondary structure of its
RNA: the cloverleaf structure (the 5'domain), an unstructured region, the extended stem-loop (the 3'domain).
This characteristic domain composition is experimentally
probed in salmon SmaI SINE RNA and seems to have
guaranteed successful and continuous amplification of
SINEs in eukaryotic genomes during evolution. From this
view, HAmo SINE may reveal some internal structures of
SINE that may lead to its successful retrotransposition and
proliferation.
Three similar but independently derived SINE families
When using HAmo SINE as query to tBlastN search, it
shows unexpected high similarity to other two SINE families in salmon: SmaI family (77%) and FokI family
(71%), both are young SINE families and have a limited
distribution in several specific species belonging to the
family Salmonidae [47]. The two SINE families shared a
common tail and parasitized SalL2 in salmon genome
[24]. After detailed comparison of the consensus
sequences of them and their respective partner LINE families (Figure 10)[48,49], we found that HAmo SINE is similar in tRNA-related region (1–76 bp) and LINE-related

region (107–150 bp) with SmaI family and FokI family.
But the existence of a central region (76–107 bp) which
showed no similarity with each other and are specific to
each family make us deduce that they are probably independently generated and evolved in respective evolutionary lineage other than horizontal transfer.
As noted in the Introduction section, the template switch
during TPRT was proposed to explain how SINE acquired
the tail from corresponding LINE. In this process, a short
cDNA would first be generated by copying the 3'terminal
LINE RNA sequence, and then RT landing pad will jump
to another RNA parent of the SINE-to-be carrying an internal pol III promoter [34]. So the above-mentioned tRNALys derived SINE may be born through template switch
between respective LINE and ancestor RNA of SINE-to-be
containing tRNA-derived region and family-specific
region in respective genome of three fishes. Coincidently,
the three young families are all derived from tRNALys or
structurally related to tRNALys (Figure 6)[50]. Moreover,
their parental LINE (HAmoL2 and Sal L2) of the above
mentioned three SINE families are homologous and share
a common tail.
In fact, tRNALys is the most common source of SINEs
[7,24,51]. The possible reason is that maybe the ancestor
tRNALys SINE RNA had special selective advantage in the
above generation process or been preferentially transcripted and retrotransposed after generation among the
population of RNA of SINE -to be.

Phylogenetic relationships between HAmo LINEs
and other LINE families belonging to L2 clade. Analysis was performed using partial RTase of HAmo LINE and full
length RTase of other LINEs. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (with programs in
the MEGA4 package [44]). Numbers above the branches
indicate the bootstrap values per 1000 replications and provide an indication of the statistical significance of the nodes.
Related references of used LINEs are as follows: UnaL2 [26];

(AAD19348); CR1-2_DR, CR1-1_DR, CR1-3_DR, CR14_DR, CR1-1_AG, CR1-1a_AG were obtained from Repbase[43]

So this finding suggested that the three similar but distantly related young SINE families were generated independently and created by LINE families within the same
lineage of a LINE phylogeny in the genomes of different
hosts.
Some aspects about the new retroposons enrichment
strategy
Magnetic Bead-based isolation system has been widely
used for the separation of several specific targets like cells,
proteins, microsatellites and so on. However, our work is
the first report about application of this system for isolation of SINEs and LINEs from fish genomes by developing
new special protocol. The results demonstrate that this
protocol is technically straightforward and permits the
isolation of a large number of SINE and LINE from
unknown genome in less time consumption and less cost
and effort than is required to execute traditional protocol
involving rounds of filter hybridization.

In general, if all steps work, the procedure takes only
about a week from tissue to several hundred positive
clones. Additionally, the purchase of the reagents needed
for building and screening one library by traditional protocol will supply sufficient reagents for ten or more librar-

ies applied by enrichment protocol. Moreover, the
protocol can be easily controlled and handled since it
requires little specialized equipment platform or technical
expertise, May be the PCR and cloning be the most difficult step.
Our method, relying on solution hybridization, could
greatly facilitate and speed up the interaction between
probe and target DNA and result in better hybridization
efficiencies in comparison with fixed solid supports
[52,53]. Moreover, this method can be useful in the case
of low copy number SINEs and LINEs since at last only a
population of sequences enriched for specific retroposons
is cloned. Generally the frequency of positive clones can
reach 50–90% if conditions were optimized [54]. So it
shows great advantage when usually a great number of retroposon insertions need be isolated as temporal landmarks of evolution for estimations of phylogeny.
Most steps in the protocol presented here can be readily
modified to suit different experimental backgrounds and
knowledge about SINE and LINE and can easily combine
with other protocols. Okada's group successfully isolated
many SINE families from many organisms by using the in
vitro transcript of total genomic DNA as the probes utilizing the properties that SINEs are redundant in the genome
and transcribed by RNA polymerase III [55,56]. While
Kramerov's group prefered to use AB-PCR product containing a 30–40 bp sequence located between boxes A and

Comparison
Comparison of HAmo SINE and two other tRNAlys-derived SINE families: SmaI and FokI family [47-49]. We
divided the HAmo SINE into three parts that show different similarity with other two SINEs, respectively. The tRNA-derived

they were generated independently. The tail regions of these SINEs and their partner LINEs tail are compared. When most of

B of SINE as a probe [37,57]. All these specific probes
including known SINE sequence (this paper) can be biotinylated to join into this enrichment strategy.
But it is noted that there are many principles that should
be kept in mind. Firstly, correct restriction enzyme should
be selected to generate appropriate size fragments evenly
and its recognized sites should not exist in the targeted
repeat elements. In our work, although we isolated SINEs
and LINEs simultaneously at one isolation reaction, we
only obtained the HaeIII-fragmented partial LINEs
because of the existed HaeIII site in full-size LINEs. Secondly, the amplification cycles of step PCR enrichment and
adapter PCR (see Methods) should be optimized to generate a smear of the PCR products without specific bands. In
this case, 15 and 12 of cycles were done in the two steps
respectively to keep the complexity of DNA molecules for
preventing the generation of a lot of identical clones at
last. Moreover, the selectivity and specificity can be

adjusted by altering specific probe and the stringency conditions (temperature and salinity of washing buffer).
Thirdly, there are several methods for labeling one biotin
at one terminus of the DNA fragment such as PCR method
with one of the two primers biotinylated (this paper),
end-labeling using terminal transferase, ligation reaction
with a biotinylated adaptor [58] or direct generated by
company service. No matter which method to be used, it
is important to label only one biotin molecule at one terminus of the DNA fragment, otherwise magnetic beads
will crosslink and clot through DNA bridges, which may
result in poor reaction kinetics between beads and target
molecules. In addition, isolation of large size of DNA fragments may be limited by beads binding ability and cloning efficiency of large fragments into T-vector. However,
our procedures mainly base on PCR and hence could be
use to track the progress of the entire process from step to
step by gel electrophoresis.

Conclusion
The young HAmo SINE family and its partner HAmo
LINE2 family shared a common 3'tail region in two carp
fishes, indicated the retropositional parasitism of HAmo
SINEs on HAmo LINEs and strengthened already proposed hypotheses including the formation of the stem
loop structure in 3'tail region of some SINEs and LINEs
and the mechanism of template switching in generating
new SINE family. The finding of repeat sequences in the 3'
tail of the HAmo SINEs strengthened the slippage model
for initiation of reverse transcription. The obtained results
show that the developed new protocol for isolation of
SINE and LINE are advantages and technically straightforward. The characterization of new SINE and LINE pair is
also beneficial to the future study about the molecular systematics of cyprinid fish.
