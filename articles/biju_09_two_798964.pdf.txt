Abstract
Background: Bufonidae are a large family of toads with a subcosmopolitan distribution. Recent
molecular phylogenetic analyses have revealed a radiation of toads (Adenominae) with distinct adult
and larval ecomorphs on the Southern parts of the Indian subcontinent. The Indian torrential
species "Ansonia" ornata has a basal position in this clade and does not group with South-East Asian
Ansonia. Additionally, the nested position of "Bufo" koynayensis and an undescribed sister species,
and their distinct ecologies including a non-typical egg-laying strategy within bufonids, support the
recognition of a second distinct genus. In this paper we describe two new genera and one new
species from the Adenominae clade.
Findings: Ansonia ornata Günther, 1876 "1875" is transferred to Ghatophryne gen. nov., a genus
of torrentially adapted toads that are endemic to the Western Ghats of India. On the basis of close
morphological resemblance and distribution, Ansonia rubigina Pillai and Pattabiraman, 1981 is
provisionally transferred to this new genus. The Western Ghats endemic toad Bufo koynayensis
Soman, 1963 is transferred to a new genus Xanthophryne gen. nov. Based on molecular and
morphological evidence, we additionally describe a new species, Xanthophryne tigerinus sp. nov.,
from Amboli in the Western Ghats.
Conclusion: The descriptions and subsequent taxonomic changes we propose result in three
genera of bufonids recognised as being endemic to the Western Ghats (Ghatophryne gen. nov.,
Xanthophryne gen. nov. and Pedostibes), and one to Sri Lanka (Adenomus). The spatial
distribution, and arrangement of these lineages at the base of Adenominae diversification, reflects
their Early Neogene isolation in the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka hotspot.

Introduction
Bufonidae are a family of toads with over 500 extant species distributed on most continents. Current opinions on
bufonid taxonomy are very divergent, and range from the
recognition of multiple genera [1], to favouring a subcosmopolitan genus Bufo with plenty of subgenera [2].
Although the phylogenetic relationships of bufonids have
been studied intensively [1,3,4], the evolutionary position
of species on the Indian subcontinent had remained
unclear. However, recent molecular phylogenetic analyses
revealed that these toads belong to a radiation containing
distinct ecomorphs in adult and/or larval forms [5]. The
early diversification of this clade, for which the name Adenominae is available [6], has been reconstructed as occurring on the Southern parts of the Indian subcontinent.
Early diversification of Adenominae, timed at the early
Miocene, led to several endemic lineages ("Ansonia"
ornata, Pedostibes tuberculosus, the "Bufo" koynayensis group
and Adenomus) [5] and to the origin of the more widespread Duttaphrynus clade. The unexpected evolutionary
position of "Ansonia" ornata and "Bufo" koynayensis (see
abstract) requires recognition of two new genera to
accommodate these Western Ghats endemic species and
their relatives.

SVL 29.2 mm, collected from Kurichiyarmala,
11°35'N, 75°58'E, Wayanad, Kerala.

The original description of this species was based on nine
syntypes (BMNH 1947.2.20.65-1947.2.20.73) collected
in "Bramagherries" (= Brahmagiri Hills, Coorg) by R. H.
Beddome. We hereby designate one of them, BMNH
1947.2.20.66 (ex BMNH 74.4.29.945), an adult male,
SVL 29.0, as lectotype of this nominal taxon.

Methods
Collection of amphibian specimens was made during
fieldtrips in the Western Ghats between 1997 and 2002.
Specimens were preserved in 5% formaldehyde for 2 days,
and subsequently transferred to 70% ethanol. Measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 mm, using a digital
slide-caliper or a binocular microscope with a micrometer
ocular. The description (all measurements in mm) of the
types follows terminology used elsewhere [7]. To comply
with regulations of the International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature we have deposited copies of this article at
the following publicly accessible libraries: Bombay Natural History Society, Mumbai, India (BNHS); Koninklijk
Belgisch Instituut voor Natuurwetenschappen, Brussels,
Belgium (KBIN); Natural History Museum, London, UK
(BMNH); American Museum of Natural History, New
York, USA (AMNH); Museum National d'Histoire
Naturelle, Paris, France (MNHN); Russian Academy of
Sciences, Moscow, Russia (RAS).

Descriptions
1. Ghatophryne gen. nov. (Figure 1)
Etymology
The generic epithet is derived from the words 'Ghats' and
'phryne'. The former is the Sanskrit word for 'steps' and
refers to the Western Ghats mountain range, where this
genus is endemic, while 'phryne' means toad in Greek.
Type species
Ansonia ornata Günther, "1876" 1875, by original designation.

Diagnosis and comparison
Ghatophryne can be distinguished from other bufonid
genera by the combination of the following characters:
small-sized adults (male SVL 26.9-30.1, N = 5; female
35.0, N = 1); dorsum reddish brown, ventrum dark
brownish black with prominent yellowish-orange spots;
head without cranial ridge, lack of parotoid glands; fingers
free, toes medium webbed; skin on dorsum with sparsely
granular projections especially on anterior half of the
body; eggs non-pigmented, tadpoles with a suctorial disk,
adapted to mountain streams throughout the life cycle
(SD Biju, personal observations). Ghatophryne can be
characterized in a phylogenetic framework as the most
inclusive clade that contains Ansonia ornata Günther,
"1876" 1875, but not Bufo melanostictus Schneider, 1799
and Ansonia hanitschi Inger, 1960 [5].

Ghatophryne is morphologically very similar to species of
Ansonia, but is endemic to the southern part of the Western Ghats, while Ansonia is known only from South-East
Asia (Sumatra, Borneo and Philippines).
Contents
Ghatophryne ornata (Günther, "1876" 1875) comb.
nov., Ghatophryne rubigina (Pillai and Pattabiraman,

Diagnosis and comparison
Xanthophryne can be distinguished from other bufonid
genera by the combination of the following characters:
small-sized adults (male SVL 26.5-32.9, N = 12; female
SVL 33.3-35.3, N = 3) having light brown dorsum with a
suffusion of dull chrome-yellow; head with discontinuous and weak canthal and preorbital ridges on the anterior part, flanks and sides of the abdomen have chromeyellow patches, or sometimes 2-4 continuous bands; tympanum indistinct, rather weak parotoid glands; toes and
fingers without webbing, tips rounded; eggs in clutches.
Xanthophryne can be characterized in a phylogenetic
framework as the most inclusive clade that contains Bufo
koynayensis Soman, 1963 but not Bufo melanostictus
Schneider, 1799 and Bufo kelaartii Günther, 1858.
Contents
Xanthophryne koynayensis (Soman, 1963) comb. nov. (Figure 2) and Xanthophryne tigerinus sp. nov. (Figure 3A)
Distribution
Xanthophryne has only been reported from the northern
part of the Western Ghats of India.
3. Xanthophryne tigerinus sp. nov.(Figure 3A-E)
Etymology
The species epithet tigerinus is attributed to this species
due to similarity in the species colour pattern to the prominent lateral stripes in Tigers (Panthera tigris).

sonal observation). The eggs are laid in temporary puddles on laterite rocks (Figure 4).

Secondary sexual characteristics
Male (BNHS 5175) has nuptial spines on the prepollex;
Ovary of single female specimen ((BNHS 4207) had 59
pigmented eggs, 1.2 ± 0.3 mm in diameter.

Notes
Bufo koynayensis Soman, 1963 was described twice based
on the same type series but bearing different numbers.
Soman first described Bufo koynayensis, without designating any type other than mentioning, "was collected in
good numbers" [9]. Almost 40 years later, specimen ZSI
A.1784 was recognized as the holotype of Bufo koynayensis
Soman, 1963 [10]. This specimen was examined and is
badly damaged (SDB, personal observation). The samples
collected by Soman were utilized to describe Bufo sulphureus (holotype, BNHS 377 and 26 paratypes including
5 males, 11 females and 10 juveniles) [11], which as a
consequence is a junior synonym of Bufo koynayensis. As
described in the original description, the type series of
Bufo sulphureus were deposited in the British Museum of
Natural History, the Indian Museum and the Bombay

Variation
Measurements of eight type specimens are given in Table
1. During the breeding season, both male and female
toads have a bright yellow dorsum with light yellow and
light blue lateral stripes. Outside the breeding season,
they have a light brownish grey dorsum with light yellow
lateral stripes.
Distribution and natural history
Xanthophryne tigerinus sp. nov. is known only from the
type locality Amboli. The type series was collected from
the ground near disturbed evergreen forest patches during
a rainy evening after 19:00 h. Amplexus is axillary. Egg
clutches contain 30-35 eggs per clutch (N = 4; VG, perTable 1: Measurements of the two Xanthophryne gen. nov. species

Ghatophryne gen. nov. and Xanthophryne gen. nov. are both
endemic to the Western Ghats of India. Together with the
arboreal toad genus Pedostibes (Western Ghats endemic;
species from South-East Asia belong to another clade) and
the genus Adenomus (Sri Lanka endemic), they form the
oldest lineages in the Adenominae clade. The recognition
of each of these lineages as distinct genera highlights their
early diversification on the southern parts of the Indian
subcontinent [5].
