Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial porins, or voltage-dependent anion-selective channels (VDAC) allow
the passage of small molecules across the mitochondrial outer membrane, and are involved in
complex interactions regulating organellar and cellular metabolism. Numerous organisms possess
multiple porin isoforms, and initial studies indicated an intriguing evolutionary history for these
proteins and the genes that encode them.
Results: In this work, the wealth of recent sequence information was used to perform a
comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary history of mitochondrial porins. Fungal porin sequences
were well represented, and newly-released sequences from stramenopiles, alveolates, and seed and
flowering plants were analyzed. A combination of Neighbour-Joining and Bayesian methods was
used to determine phylogenetic relationships among the proteins. The aligned sequences were also
used to reassess the validity of previously described eukaryotic porin motifs and to search for
signature sequences characteristic of VDACs from plants, animals and fungi. Secondary structure
predictions were performed on the aligned VDAC primary sequences and were used to evaluate
the sites of intron insertion in a representative set of the corresponding VDAC genes.
Conclusion: Our phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that paralogs have appeared several times
during the evolution of VDACs from the plants, metazoans, and even the fungi, suggesting that
there are no "ancient" paralogs within the gene family. Sequence motifs characteristic of the
members of the crown groups of organisms were identified. Secondary structure predictions
suggest a common 16 β-strand framework for the transmembrane arrangement of all porin
isoforms. The GLK (and homologous or analogous motifs) and the eukaryotic porin motifs in the
four representative Chordates tend to be in exons that appear to have changed little during the
evolution of these metazoans. In fact there is phase correlation among the introns in these genes.
Finally, our preliminary data support the notion that introns usually do not interrupt structural
protein motifs, namely the predicted β-strands. These observations concur with the concept of
exon shuffling, wherein exons encode structural modules of proteins and the loss and gain of
introns and the shuffling of exons via recombination events contribute to the complexity of modern
day proteomes.

Background
Mitochondrial porins were first identified in paramecia, as
proteins capable of forming voltage-dependent, anionselective channels (VDAC) when inserted in artificial
"black lipid" bilayers [1]. Proteins that formed pores with
very similar characteristics were subsequently identified in
mitochondria from fungi, plants, metazoans and invertebrates (See Table 1 for references), initially suggesting that
mitochondria harbour a single form of porin. All of these
proteins were of similar size (28–36 kDa) and formed
anion-selective pores with conductances of about 4 nanoSeimens (nS) in artificial bilayers. Application of voltage,
in the order of 50 mV, across the membrane converted the
pores to a partially closed (1–2 nS), cation-selective state
(voltage-dependent gating, reviewed by [2]). The biological relevance of the gating process is not clear, but it presumably reflects common types of voltage-sensitive
interactions among segments of the proteins that contribute to both pore size and ion selectivity.
The similar functional characteristics of mitochondrial
porins suggest a common structure. These proteins presumably traverse the outer membrane as a series of βstrands that form a β-barrel, in a manner reminiscent of
bacterial porins (Fig. 1; reviewed by [2-4]). A β-barrel pore
was initially predicted from primary sequence analysis,
which revealed the absence of potential membrane-spanning helices [5,6]. This observation has held for all mitochondrial porins known to date, and has been supported
by biophysical analyses that reveal high β-strand content
in liposome-embedded or detergent-solubilized porins
[7-10]. Numerous approaches, including secondary structure predictions [11,12], and characterization of modified
porins [13,14] or deletion variants [9,15,16] in artificial
bilayers have led to predictions of porin topology, but a
precise structural model has remained elusive (reviewed
in [4]). Presumably there is a great deal of flexibility in the
sequences that can comprise the β-strands of the barrel, as
the primary sequence identity among porins from different species is low.
Porins are the most abundant proteins in the mitochondrial outer membrane (for example see [17]). The obvious
function for these molecules is the exchange of ions and
small molecules, including NADH [18], and ATP [19],
across the mitochondrial outer membrane (reviewed by
[20]). Regulated transport of these key metabolites has
been proposed to control mitochondrial and therefore
cellular energy transactions. Further studies have implicated porins in more complex roles, driven by interactions
of VDAC with mitochondrial (for examples see [21,22])
and cytosolic (see [23-26]) proteins, and perhaps components of the cytoskeleton [27,28]. Given its general importance to cell biology, it is not surprising that links between
disease and VDAC have been documented. One of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/31

most intriguing roles of porin is its participation in the
initiation of apoptosis. VDAC, the ADP/ATP carrier of the
inner membrane, and cyclophilin D comprise the large
permeability transition pore (PTP, [29,30]). Interactions
of VDAC with pro and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family including Bax [31-33], Bid [34], and Bcl-XL [35]
have been proposed to regulate cytochrome c release via
different mechanisms involving VDAC opening [31,32] or
closure (reviewed in [36]). Finally, cytochrome c release
from porin-containing vesicles lacking Bcl-family proteins
has been demonstrated, suggesting that porin oligomerization can be responsible for PTP formation [37]. Regardless of the precise mechanism(s) of PTP regulation, it is
clear that mitochondrial porin is engaged in complex
interactions driving many facets of cell function.
This complex picture of porin function has been complicated in the last ten years by the identification of multiple
porin isoforms in many cell types. Heins et al. [38] first
isolated two porins from potato mitochondria (POM34
and POM36), both of which form pores in black lipid
bilayers. In Saccharomyces, a genetic screen revealed a second isoform that, in high copy number, complemented a
strain in which the known VDAC gene, POR1 was disrupted [39]. Advances in molecular techniques, and the
accumulation of large amounts of sequence data from
genome sequence projects and expressed sequence tag
(EST) libraries, have led to an abundance of information
regarding porin isoforms (see [Additional File 1], Table 1
and references therein]. The number of porin variants
ranges from a single isoform in fungi such as Neurospora,
to perhaps five in Lotus japonicus [40], although in this
case some of the gene sequences were obtained from a
cDNA library and therefore may represent different alleles
at the same locus. In the few cases where they have been
performed, electrophysiological analyses and complementation of the yeast ∆por1 strain (see Table 1) have
revealed that each organism expresses at least one porin
isoform with the characteristics of the originally described
VDAC; this functional conservation is even more striking
given the relatively low levels of primary sequence conservation (see below). In contrast, some porin variants are
not capable of forming characteristic channels. Specialization of porin function is suggested by developmental regulation or tissue-specific differential expression of human
[41], mouse [42] and plant [43,44] porin isoforms. Further evidence comes from cell lines and knock-out mice
lacking porin isoforms singly or in combination [45].
Generally, the genes encoding porin isoforms are located
on different chromosomes (for example, in mice [46]. An
exception is Drosophila spp., where they are arranged in
tandem repeats [47]. The evolutionary history of some of
these multiple forms has been evaluated through phylogenetic analyses of the primary sequences of mitochondrial

Overview of the predicted transmembrane arrangement of the Neurospora mitochondrial porin across the mitochondrial outer
membrane. The model takes into account several secondary structure predictions, and experimental probing of the structure
in artificial bilayers through the use of point mutations [14], deletions [9, 15, 16], and site-specific biotinylation [13], as
described in [16]. The predicted N-terminal α-helix is represented by a cylinder, and putative β-strands by zig-zag lines, and
loops and β-turns by curved arrows. The arrowheads point in the direction of the C-terminus of the protein.

porins. These studies utilized the relatively low number of
porin sequences available (< 60) and were focussed on
animals [48] or plants [40,44]. It was revealed that porins
from plants, animals and fungi form distinct groups that
mirror the 16S rRNA phylogeny of these organisms [44].
Three clades were observed in vertebrates; each corresponding to the VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3 groupings
described for mammals [48]. Five porin subfamilies were
identified in plants [40], some in only monocots or
dicots, and others were represented in both groups.

whose universality has already been questioned [40], and
to search for signature sequences characteristic of VDACs
from plants, animals and fungi. Finally, secondary structure predictions were performed on the aligned VDAC primary sequences, revealing a remarkable conservation in βstrand forming regions in spite of low sequence similarity
in these segments. These structural predictions were used
to evaluate the sites of intron insertion in a representative
set of the corresponding VDAC genes.

Results and Discussion
The goal of this work is to use the large amounts of
genome sequence data currently available to perform a
comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary history of
mitochondrial porins. In particular, more fungal porin
sequences, which were under-represented in previously
published phylogenetic analyses, were utilized. In total,
244 VDAC protein sequences, including newly-released
sequences from stramenopiles, alveolates, and seed and
flowering plants were analyzed. A combination of Neighbour-Joining and Bayesian methods was used to determine phylogenetic relationships among the proteins. The
aligned sequences were also used to reassess the validity of
the eukaryotic porin signature motif (Prosite PS00558),

Phylogenetic history of eukaryotic porins
Phylogenetic trees were obtained based on analysis of the
aligned data set and subsets thereof with NJ and Bayesian
algorithms. The phylogenetic estimates presented in Figs.
2 and 3 and [Additional File 2] were analyzed with NJ and
Figs. 2 and 3 also include the results obtained with Bayesian analysis. The aligned data set was built on the smaller
sets used by others [40,44,48] and includes VDACs from
three eukaryotic crown groups (Plants, Animals, Fungi)
and from the Stramenopiles. The latter included only five
taxa (representing the Oomycota) and the use of Phytophthora sojae porin sequences as outgroups in our analysis is
in part justified as the emergence of the Stramenopiles is

viewed as a basal event to the evolution of the plants,
metazoans and fungi [49]. A single representative of the
Charophyta and two from the Rhodophyta were also used
[see Additional File 1].
The VDAC amino acid sequences from members of the
three crown groups formed monophyletic groupings and
the branching patterns suggest that the animal and fungal
porins are derived from a common ancestor. All methods
of analysis yielded phylogenetic trees that were essentially
congruent with each other. Essentially the evolution of the
VDAC sequences follows the expected pattern for a highly
conserved sequence, as the positions of the crown group
taxa within the tree correspond in part to the expected
phyletic positions based on rDNA sequences, which suggests that fungi and the metazoans share a common
ancestor [49]. Our results place the stramenopile VDACs
as outliers to the three main clades. The salient features of
each group and subgroups within them are discussed
below.
Plant mitochondrial porins: Angiosperms, Eudicots
Among the Eudicots, mitochondrial porins appear to have
a rather complex evolutionary history. Based on the available data, there are potentially up to five paralogs for
some members of this group of flowering plants, including Glycine max and Lotus japonicus. In cases where whole
genome data are unavailable, it is not clear whether these
represent allelic variants or different loci. Functional data
have not been obtained for many of these isoforms, but in
Lotus japonicus, all five forms are expressed throughout the
plant, with only slight differences in expression levels in
the tissues tested [40].

Many eudicot VDACs can be derived from one node (Fig.
2, node 1); thereafter the phylogenetic tree suggests that
several gene duplications have occurred, giving rise to
some of the recent eudicot VDAC paralogs. The current
annotation for plant VDACs is very confusing and needs
to be addressed in future efforts. Knowing the evolutionary history of the various VDACs, combined with the completion of more plant genome projects in the near future
should facilitate this goal.
Plant mitochondrial porins: Angiosperms, Monocots
Within the monocots grouped by node 2 (Fig. 2), three
clades can be recognized that suggest that at least three
VDAC paralogs have evolved. The three monocot VDAC
paralogs can be derived from a node that received 100%
Bayesian posterior probability support and 89% bootstrap support in NJ analysis, suggesting these three paralogs have a common ancestor.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/31

Plant mitochondrial porins: Gymnosperms
Basal to node 3 (Fig. 2) that joins the monocot and eudicot VDACs described above, a branch emerges that unites
VDACs from the Gymnosperms (Seed Plants, node 4, Fig.
2). Although there were only a limited number of
sequences available, there is an indication that more than
one form of mitochondrial porin is present within some
members (Welwitschia mirabilis, and Pinus conifera), suggesting that VDAC paralogs also evolved within this group
of plants.
A clade composed of both seed and flowering plant porins
Attached to a node (Fig. 2, node 5) that is "basal" to the
Angiosperm and Gymnosperm VDACs described above is
a clade that includes mitochondrial porins from both
monocots and eudicots, and the one available example of
a seed plant VDAC. This clade could represent the most
ancient forms of VDAC that were present in the common
ancestor that gave rise to the seed and flowering plants.
Again within this clade there appears to be evidence of
paralogs, as more than one form of VDAC from Arabidopsis thaliana, Lotus sp., Glycine max, Medicago sp., and
Lycospersion sp. are grouped within this cluster. This clade
includes two groupings (nodes 6 and 7) that accommodate the latter paralogs. Also potentially allied to each of
these two groupings are monocot sequences. The Pinus
conifera porin sequence appears to be situated between the
two groupings.

Overall within the land plants examined, VDAC paralogs
appear to have evolved numerous times independently
within different plant lineages. But ultimately one node
appears to unite all the land plant porin sequences. Green
algal sequences (Chlorophyta), and a Desmid sequence
(Charophyta) are basal to the land plant node.
Metazoan mitochondrial porins
The evolution of metazoan VDAC genes (see node 8, Fig.
3) has already been addressed by Saccone et al. [48] and
others. Essentially within the Chordates, the porin gene
family consists of three genes (VDAC 1, 2, and 3) and
these appear to be a classic example of a set of paralogous
genes. Isoforms in the VDAC1 and VDAC2 clades are
more closely related to each other than to those in the
VDAC3 group [48]. For the basal branching members of
the Phylum Chordata: tunicates (Molgula tectiformis) and
the Urochordata (Ciona intestinalis), only one porin gene
could be identified [see Additional File 1]. Thus, the Chordate porin paralogs probably evolved within the vertebrate lineage. In general, in the large data set (244 VDAC
sequences), nodes basal to VDAC1 and VDAC2 vertebrate
porin clades are poorly resolved (i.e. poor statistical support) and sequences representing the VDAC3 clade are
placed next to sequences representing the amphioxus
Branchiostoma floridae (Class Cephalochordata) and Lym-

Evolutionary history of eukaryotic porin sequences – stramenopiles and plants
Evolutionary history of eukaryotic porin sequences – stramenopiles and plants. The phylogenetic tree, continued in Figure 3, is
based on NJ and Bayesian analysis of 141 VDAC sequences. Stramenopile sequences were used as the out group. Levels of
confidence of the nodes are only provided if support is above 66%. The numbers are based on posterior probability values generated by Bayesian analysis and on bootstrap analysis in combination with NJ analysis (italics). The presence of the GLK (G) and
Eukaryotic porin motifs (E) are indicated towards the right of the phylogenetic tree. Note among the plants the GLK domain
appears as the STK (S) motif; an X indicates the absence of the motif. Lower case g designates a G-any-K or G-any-R, where
"any" refers to any other amino acid. The lower case s indicates S-any-K or S-any-R. The minus (-) indicates that the sequence
was incomplete and thus the GLK and eukaryotic porin motifs could not be identified. Nodes designated by a number (1–10)
are discussed within the text. Underlined accession numbers are those of VDACs that do not contain the signature motif identified in this study.

naea stagnalis (Pond Snail). In both data sets (141 and
244), the vertebrate VDAC3 clade appears to contain the
earliest branching porin sequences. For Petromyzon marinus (parasitic marine lamprey) one of the oldest known
taxa of living vertebrates (Hyperoartia), evidence for more
than one porin gene was not recovered, although the
entire genome sequence is not yet available.
Overall the species groupings were consistent with the
current model of Metazoan evolution [50], with the echinoderms [Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea
urchin)], cnidarians/hydrozoans [Hydra magnipapillata
(fresh water polyp)], and members of the mollusk phylum, Argopecten irradians and Spisula solidissima (i.e. surf
clam and scallop respectively) appearing basal to the vertebrate lineage of VDAC paralogs (Fig. 3 and [Additional
File 2]). Although the branches placing members of the
Phylum Mollusca received only poor statistical support
[Additional File 2], one has to be cautious as the mollusk
sequences were retrieved from EST data bases and may
contain errors.
Among the invertebrates, as reported by Saccone et al.
[48], and Graham and Craigen [47] only one VDAC gene
could be recovered. However, within the Phylum Arthropoda, Drosophila melanogaster appears to have at least four
porin genes ([Additional File 2], see nodes 1 and 2), of
which one set might represent co-orthologs (see node 2),
the result of a lineage specific duplication event (see [47]).
However, a porin gene from D. pseudoobscura is derived
from the same node that includes a potential set of coorthologs ([Additional File 2], see node 2) and these D.
pseudoobscura VDACs could represent inparalogs [51]. The
two species of Drosophila (melanogaster and pseudoobscura)
appear to have VDACs with the phylogenetic pattern
expected for true paralogs; one paralog was then tandemly
duplicated twice in D. melanogaster and once in D. pseudoobscura.
Fungal mitochondrial porins
Within the mycota the porin sequence phylogeny (node
9, Fig. 3) follows the expected pattern, with the Chytrid
sequence being the basal member of this group, the Ascomycota and Basdiomycota sequences forming monophyletic groupings and the ascomycetous yeast branching
early within the ascomycete lineage. With respect to gene
duplication events, it appears that among the Saccharomycetales a lineage is present that displays the presence of
paralogs (node 10, Fig. 3, and node 3 [Additional File 2]).
Candida glabrata, and the Saccharomyces spp. appear to
have at least two forms of the VDAC gene. The putative
VDAC2 of C. glabrata is highly degenerate and is not
present in the cluster of Saccharomyces VDAC2 sequences.
It is of interest that we could not detect paralogs for the
other yeast-like fungi, including Eremothecium gossypii, for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/31

which the entire genome has been sequenced. Recent
genomic work on S. cerevisiae and allied species suggest
that these organisms experienced genome duplication
events during their evolution [52]. It is interesting to speculate that the appearance of VDAC paralogs coincides
with this genome duplication event, and that for some
unknown reason both copies of the porin gene were
maintained.
Phylogenetic history of porin paralogs
One question we tried to address in this analysis was the
origin of VDAC paralogs. Did VDAC gene duplications
arise early in the evolution of the eukaryotes or did gene
duplications occur independently in different evolutionary lineages? If the first scenario applies it would suggest
that VDAC duplication events in part paralleled the
requirement for more specialized forms of VDACs as
eukaryotes evolved into more complex multicellular or
multi-tissue forms. Examples of such "ancient paralogs"
are the genes for elongation factors involved in translation
[53], and to a lesser extent the globin gene paralogs of the
metazoans [54]. Alternatively, VDAC paralogs may have
evolved independently in the different eukaryotic lineages.

Paralogs can arise through gene duplication, which in
turn can be result of genome duplication events (polyploidy), segmental chromosome duplication as a result of
unequal crossover events, or gene duplication events as a
result of "retrotransposition" events. Recent comparative
genomic analysis suggest that all of the above have
occurred during the evolution of the eukaryotic crown
groups, and several examples are revealed by the analysis
of VDAC genes. For example, the presence of two versions
of VDAC in Saccharomyces, but not other Saccharomycetales
fungi such as Kluyveromyces lactis (Fig. 3), is in agreement
with the genome duplication that is postulated for Saccharomyces [52]. Segmental duplication is seen in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, and appears to have led to
highly divergent forms of VDAC [47]. Evidence for retrotransposition has not been seen; in the limited data set
available, paralogs both lacking and containing introns
have not been identified (see following discussion of
VDAC gene structure).
Paralogs and orthologs can have different evolutionary
fates. Specialization of porin function is suggested by
developmental regulation or tissue-specific differential
expression of human [41], mouse [42] and plant [43,44]
porin isoforms. Further evidence comes from cell lines
and knock-out mice lacking porin isoforms singly or in
combination. For example, embryonic stem cell lines
lacking any one of VDAC1, VDAC2 or VDAC3 display a
30% reduction in oxygen consumption, but only in the
∆VDAC3 cells is cytochrome oxidase activity at normal

levels [45]. VDAC3-/- mice appear normal, but are malesterile due to sperm immobility, indicating a specific role
for this isoform in mammalian reproduction [55]. In contrast, lack of VDAC1 is associated with in utero lethality,
but interestingly, the surviving VDAC1-/- offspring appear
normal [56].

highly conserved within the major phylogenetic groups,
and as discussed below may contain the best candidates
for eukaryotic porin signature motifs. An intermembranespace location for the N-terminal α-helix has been established through several experimental approaches [57,58].
In all cases, the remainder of the protein is predicted to be
rich in β-strand, in agreement with existing models of
porin structure (reviewed in [2-4,13,16,59]). Nineteen
regions with β-strand propensity are predicted in the
majority of porin sequences, these are numbered 1–19 in
Fig. 4 and for simplicity will be referred to as β1, β2 etc.
for the subsequent discussion. Remarkably, each of these
regions corresponds to an aligned segment in the multiple
sequence analysis, although the spacing between individual putative β-strands varies between the major phylogenetic groups (Fig. 4).

Secondary structure predictions
Although the precise transmembrane topology of mitochondrial porin from any source is not known, secondary
structural predictions are useful in determining whether
there have been constraints on sequence features, and
therefore likely the structure of mitochondrial porins during their evolution. To this end, SSPRO was used to predict the secondary structure porin sequences aligned by
PRALINE (see Methods). These predictions revealed
remarkably similar patterns for all of the porins in this
study. As shown in Fig. 4, a segment usually located less
than 10 residues from the amino-terminus is the only
region of the protein predicted to have α-helical character.
The primary sequences of these putative α-helices are

Predicted secondary structure elements in VDAC from the crown groups of plants, animals, and fungi
Predicted secondary structure elements in VDAC from the crown groups of plants, animals, and fungi. Predictions were made
as described in Methods. For each summary diagram, the putative N-terminal α-helix is indicated by a hatched bar labelled "N"
on the left, subsequent β-strands are indicated by filled rectangles, and the intervening loops are shown as thin lines. According
to the model in Fig. 1, the N-terminal helix resides in the intermembrane space, and the subsequent loops and turns alternate
between exposure to the cytosol and to the intermembrane space. β-strands with weak support are indicated in grey. The
lower panel shows the model for Neurospora crassa VDAC structure derived in [16]. Structural elements are as described for
the plant, animal and fungal models, except that the checkerboard region indicates a C-terminal segment that is exposed to the
cytosol rather than forming the 19thβ-strand (see text for discussion). Below the model of N. crassa VDAC structure, rectangles indicate segments, that when absent in porin variants, create molecules that form pores of wild-type conductivity (open),
or inefficiently form pores that are either unstable or of reduced conductivity (filled) in artificial membranes. The position of
the GLK sequence and the eukaryotic porin signature motif (PS00558) are also noted. Vertical lines connect regions of homology and the curved arrow indicates the discrepancy for the placement of β8 between previous models (see [4]) and the current predictions.

(reviewed in [4]), but have not been experimentally
tested. In the alignment of all sequences (see [Additional
Files 3 and 4]), the region including β8 is not predicted to
form a β-strand. However, when the plant or fungal
sequences are aligned alone, a 6-residue β-strand is predicted in some sequences (residues 114–119 of O. sativa
VDAC1, and 122–129 of N. crassa porin); in others this βstrand region is shorter (3–5 amino acid residues; for
example see Fig. 5). A stretch of six residues is the minimum proposed to be sufficient for the β-strands in bacterial porins to span the thickness of a lipid bilayer [60]. In
the animal sequences, β8 (residues 125–132 in Homo sapiens VDAC1) also contains sequence with α-helical propensity and therefore is unlikely to form a β-strand.
Furthermore, this region contains a cysteine residue,
which is absent from all β-strands in bacterial porins [60].
Therefore, if all porins have a common structure, the
region including putative β8 may not form a β-strand.
Another weak prediction is β11, which also has α-helical
propensity in some of the sequences from all three groups.
If these two putative β-strands are "disregarded", to maintain an even number of β-strands needed to complete the
barrel [60], one other β-strand must be omitted. As discussed previously [4,16], although most algorithms predict a β-strand at the C-terminus of the protein, deletion
analysis [15] suggests that this is not the case (see Fig. 4).
Therefore, these data support a common, 16-strand pore
structure, in which the interstrand loops and turns vary in
size. However, it cannot be ruled out that porins from different organisms fold into barrels with different numbers
of β-strands. In spite of the uncertainty in the number of
predicted strands, the large data set examined strongly
supports a common structural framework, in which the
positions and lengths of the putative β-strands and the αhelix are extremely well conserved across all phyla investigated, and among all isoforms in a given organism.
In spite of the predicted structural similarities, there is a
great deal of variation in the amino acid sequences that
make up the putative strands and the intervening regions.
To demonstrate this sequence diversity, VDAC sequences
from one representative of the animals (Homo sapiens
VDAC1), the fungi (Neurospora crassa), the plants (Oryza
sativa VDAC1) and the stramenopiles (Phytophthora
sojae) were aligned (Fig. 5). Considering identical and
chemically similar residues, there are at most three positions that are related in three β-strands among all four
sequences (β7, β11, β13), and in several strands there are
no positions consistently occupied by chemically similar
residues (β8, β14, β17).
Signature Motifs for Eukaryotic Porins
The Prosite database carries one "signature" motif for
eukaryotic porins (PS00558); this motif was derived from
30 animal, plant and fungal porins, including members of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/31

all major VDAC classes in these groups. To determine the
universality of this motif, the current collection of porin
sequences were analyzed. Of the 236 plant, animal and
fungal sequences in the present analysis, 28 lack the complete C-terminal segment where this motif is found. The
signature motif is not found in 92 of the remaining 208
sequences, indicating that it is not universal (Figs. 2 and
3), as noted by Wandrey et al. [40]. In particular, the motif
is not detected in several animal sequences, such as
zebrafish (DrerAAH654), nor in the limited number of
stramenopile sequences available (Fig. 2).
The eukaryotic porin signature motif also contains the
"VKAKV" sequence noted by Smith et al. [61] to be present
in all VDAC sequences available at the time of their analysis. In our database, these residues were present in the
following percentages of sequences: V (48.3), K (60.4), A
(75.6), K (59.1), V (53.6). When complementary replacements are included, these numbers rise to V (81.6), K
(70.5), A (84.5), K (98.7), V (85.7). This sequence resides
in putative β16 (Fig. 5) and both lysine residues (K234
and K236) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae VDAC1 are required
for membrane assembly of this protein [61]. The lack of
strict conservation of these residues suggests that other
features of this region also may contribute to membrane
targeting or assembly.
Analysis of the aligned regions encompassing the eukaryotic signature motif did not reveal a motif common to all
eukaryotic porins; this finding is not surprising given the
low degree of sequence identity across the spectrum of
sequences analyzed herein. Use of the PRATT algorithms
([62,63]) suggested that the N-terminal regions of the
proteins contain sequences suitable for pattern analysis.
Manual comparisons of the amino-terminal regions of the
protein sequences visualized in GeneDoc [64] did reveal
motifs common to most members of the largest phylogenetic groups: plants, fungi and animals (Fig. 5, Table 2).
The limited number of stramenopile, charophyte and rhodophyte sequences did not allow identification of
sequence patterns unique to this subgroup.
The fungi represent one of the smaller groups in terms of
numbers of representative sequences [38], but the diversity in the group made it the most difficult in terms of
identifying a consistent motif. The final sequence motif
(Table 2) contains conserved residues in the N-terminal αhelix, and is anchored with a short conserved sequence
around 50 residues away, which is part of the fourth putative β-strand. The only fungal VDAC sequence that did not
contain this motif was that of Botryotinia fuckeliana.
Updated sequence information may resolve this issue, as
the B. fuckeliana VDAC sequence was derived from EST
data. This fungal VDAC motif was somewhat more effec-

Alignment of representative porin sequences
Alignment of representative porin sequences. Amino acid sequences from a plant (O. sativa VDAC1, Osat1,CAB82853), an animal (H. sapiens VDAC1, Hsap1, NP_003365), a fungus (N. crassa, Ncra, XP_323644) and a stramenopile (P. sojae, Psoj,
C_1010023) were aligned using PRALINE, as described in Methods. Residues in grey background are predicted to reside in βstrands, overlined sequences in α-helical regions, and identical (|) and conserved (:) residues between adjacent pairs of
sequences are indicated. Chemically-similar residues in all four representative sequences are shown in bold. The GLK motif
(residues 87–89 of Osat1) and the existing eukaryotic porin motif (PS00558, residues 216–238 of Osat1) are indicated by dotted underlining. The VKAKV sequence (residues 224–228 of Osat1) is part of PS00558. Note that this motif is not found in the
P. sojae VDAC sequence. Motifs, derived in this work, that are characteristic for plants (7–48 of Osat1), animals (4–18 of
Hsap1) and fungi (1–16 and 68–74, separated by any 48–52 residues, Ncra) are underlined. A unique motif for the stramenopiles could not be discerned from the data available.

tive at identifying putative VDAC sequences in the public
databases than the eukaryotic signature motif (Table 2).
The N-terminal animal VDAC motif derived in this work
(Table 2) occurs once in each of 76 of the 80 animal
VDAC sequences that had a complete N-terminal
sequence in our database. Four sequences could not be
accommodated without greatly reducing the specificity of
the pattern, that of Schistosoma japonicum, and Drosophila
melanogaster AAF53019 and AAF53018 and the ortholog
from D. pseudoobscura (Dp-22; [47]). These Drosophila
sequences diverge significantly from those of all porins in
this study [see Additional File 2] and possess long N-terminal extensions [65,47]. The animal VDAC motif detects
81 sequences in the public databases, including seven
spliceoforms. The position from the N-terminus of the
protein was allowed to vary between 0 and 30 residues, to
allow detection of human VDAC2 (P45880), in which the
motif begins 24 residues from the predicted N-terminus.
The plant VDAC motif derived from this study (Table 2)
was identified in all but eleven of the plant sequences
used. All of the latter VDACs have related sequences in the
N-terminal region, but their inclusion led to a consensus
sequence with significantly reduced specificity. Both
VDAC sequences from the green algae Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii lack the motif described above. Within the land
plants, it is absent from a small group of sequences
located within a cluster of sequences united by node 2
(Fig. 2). Two closely related sequences within the cluster
unified by node 5 (Fig. 2) also lack the motif. Three additional sequences shown in [Additional File 2] also lack the
plant-derived VDAC motif, namely those derived from
ESTs from a club moss Selaginella moellendorffii, and from
Pinus taeda (gi|49625878), and from genomic DNA of
Sorghum bicolor (TC94332). The plant motif is not contained within the VDAC sequences from organisms of the
deeper branches of the tree: the red algae (Galdieria sulphuraria and Cyanidioschyzon merolae), and the Desmid
Chlosterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale. The plant
VDAC motif detected 43 sequences in the public databases, and anchoring to the N-terminus was not necessary
to maintain specificity.
Another highly conserved sequence in VDAC is the glycine-leucine-lysine (GLK) motif, which was initially suggested to be an ATP binding site [66]; replacement of the
lysine residue with glutamate leads to porins that retain
ATP binding [10], but are cation-selective, rather than
anion selective in artificial bilayers [10,14].
The GLK sequence is present in the majority of sequences
in the current survey (Table 2; Figs. 2 and 3). Variations
containing chemically similar residues are also found (Gany-R, G-any-K, where "any" is any amino acid). In the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/31

fungi and animals, the VDAC sequences lacking this motif
are scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, and there
is no apparent link between the presence of this motif and
the eukaryotic signature sequence. In the plants there are
two clusters of VDAC sequences in which GLK is replaced
by a version of STK (Fig. 2, node 5). Also of note, all of the
organisms that contain an STK-bearing isoform also have
one with a GLK motif, suggesting perhaps a separation of
function in the two types of isoforms.
VDAC 2.1 (STK) and VDAC 3.1 (no GLK or STK) isoforms
from Lotus japonicus are able to complement a ∆por1
(VDAC1-less) strain of yeast (Table 1). In contrast, VDAC
1.3 does not complement in yeast, in spite of the fact that
it possesses both a GLK and a eukaryotic signature motif
(PS00558). However, further species or tissue-specific
roles for these isoforms remain untested in plants, as does
the pore-forming ability of these proteins. Taken together,
the data suggest that the STK motif was either derived by
a neutral event, or has been selected for as it was involved
in a newly acquired, specialized function.
In terms of nucleotide differences in the corresponding
coding sequences, the Arabidopsis isoforms provide an
interesting example, as there is one with each of motif:
GLK (AAM62480), GLR (NP_186777), STK (NP_201551)
and SAK (NP_200557). Two transitions differentiate the
AGG arginine codon in GLR from the AAA lysine codon in
GLK. The SAK and STK containing two isoforms are found
in the "ancient" cluster described by node 5. The STK
sequence is encoded by TCC GCT AAA, while TCA ACA
AAA encodes SAK. The SAK coding sequence differs from
that encoding GLK (GGA CTG AAA) by three transversions and two transitions, while the difference between
the STK and GLK sequences is five transversions and a
transition – in both cases the lysine codon AAA is
unchanged.
Comparison of VDAC gene structures across a selection of
species
Given the shared predicted structural and primary
sequence elements in mitochondrial porins, it was of
interest to expand the initial analysis of porin genes (for
example [67,68,47]). Therefore, twelve representative animal, plant, and fungal VDAC genes (including paralogs)
were examined for the number of introns present, intron
phasing, and the position of introns with respect to functional and structural motifs (Figs. 6, 7, 8). While this dataset is not large enough to derive statistically sound
conclusions, many general trends were noted. The comparative VDAC gene maps show that the vertebrate VDAC
open reading frames usually consist of 8 exons and 7
introns, a pattern also observed within the sea urchin
(Strongylocentrolus purpuratus) VDAC gene. The C. elegans
VDAC gene has 4 introns and the Drosophila melanogaster

Page 13 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:31

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/31

paralogs contain 2 introns. Thus, the number of introns
appears to decrease and the introns get shorter as one goes
from the vertebrates/echinoderms/nematodes to the
arthropods. The plant VDAC paralogs examined typically
had 4 to 5 short introns.

The 42-residue plant motif begins near residue six and
includes the predicted α-helix. In contrast to the animal
VDAC sequences, the coding region for the α-helix is disrupted by one or two introns. For the remainder of the
plant motif, the coding region contains a single intron.

In general, introns were longest within the mammalian
sequences sampled and shorter in the invertebrate, plant
and fungal taxa (Figs. 6 and 7). This contrasts with the
shorter exons noted within the chordate sequences, as
exemplified by the human, rat, zebra fish and bird (Gallus
gallus) VDAC genes in which exons range in size from 30
bp (human VDAC2) to 225 bps. There is a general trend
among the vertebrate and echinoderm VDACs that, relative to the internal exons, the 5' terminal exons 1 and 2 are
very short (30 to 75 bps), as are the 3' terminal exons 7
and 8 (55 and 93 bp, respectively). However, the echinoderm is an exception, with a relatively longer exon 7 (210
bp). In the chordates, exons 5 and 6 appear to be quite
ancient as their size is conserved from zebra fish to
humans.

The fungal motif also begins about six residues from the
N-terminus of the protein and the N-terminal portion of
the motif (see above) spans 14–18 residues. In both fungal sequences in Fig. 7, this portion of the motif is
encoded by exons 1 and 2. The C-terminal part of the
motif is encoded by sequence including the junction
between exons 2 and 3 in C. neoformans, and entirely by
exon 4 in N. crassa. In the sequences examined, the entire
coding sequence for the GLK motif is within a single exon.
The coding sequence for the eukaryotic porin signature
motif (PS00558) is split by an intron in all of the animal
and fungal sequences in Fig. 8, except in Drosophila, while
it is encoded by a single exon in the plant sequences.

Lawen et al. (2005) noted that the intron/exon junctions
in human VDAC paralogs are conserved [69], i.e. a given
intron disrupts the same position in a codon and therefore phase correlation exists. This correlation is also
observed for the majority of introns in the chordate
sequences examined (Fig. 6); the only exception is a single
intron in rat VDAC2. Similar phase correlation was seen
for the Drosophila isoforms (Fig. 6), and the plant
sequences examined (Fig. 7). Intron phase correlation is
viewed as evidence of non-random insertion of an intron
and thus interpreted by some as the presence of an ancient
intron [70]. Introns in phase 0 are viewed as old by some
authors [71], as they do not disrupt a codon.

Intron location with respect to functional and structural
motifs of VDAC
A more detailed examination of the position of introns
with respect to the position of protein domains/or modules, such as the β-strands that are important components
of the VDAC structure, showed that these modules appear
to correlate with the position of introns. The introns in
general do not interrupt β-strand modules or the GLK and
eukaryotic porin motifs (Fig. 8). This observation is most
pronounced in the vertebrate, sea urchin, Drosophila and
plant VDAC genes; for example, there appears to be an
intron conserved between β6 and β7 and between β11
and β12. In the metazoans, other introns are frequently
located between the coding sequences for the N-terminal
α-helix and the first β-strand module, between β1 and β2,
and between β16 and β17.

The fungal VDAC genes examined either lack introns (S.
cerevisiae VDAC1 and VDAC2, U. maydis, data not shown)
or show a bias towards phase 0 introns; overall we noted
among the fungal VDAC paralogs displayed in Fig. 7 seven
phase 0 introns and one phase 1 intron. The plant VDACs
appear to have more phase 0 introns with a ratio of 20:7:7
for phase 0, 1 and 2 introns respectively. In contrast, there
are 32 phase 0, 24 phase 1, and 22 phase 2 introns in vertebrate VDAC paralogs; thus there is not a strong bias
towards any one category of intron. In contrast to this general trend, the C. elegans and Arthropod porin gene
sequences appear to be devoid of phase 0 introns and the
ratio of phase 1 to phase 2 introns is 2 to 13.

Conclusion

The coding sequences for the sequence motifs discussed
above are also conserved with respect to exonic location
(Fig. 8). In the animal sequences presented, the N-terminal motif is encoded by sequence within the first exon; the
only exceptions are VDAC2 in H. sapiens and R. norvegicus.

Our phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that paralogs
have appeared several times during the evolution of
VDACs from the plants, metazoans, and even the fungi,
suggesting that there are no "ancient" paralogs within this
gene family. Secondary structure predictions are compatible with a common 16 β-strand framework for porin

Within the plant VDAC genes examined again there was a
bias towards introns being located between β-strand modules (see Fig. 8). Introns were located between the coding
sequences for β1 and β2, β4 and β5, β6 and β7, and β12
and β13. There is generally an intron within the coding
region for the N-terminal α-helix as well. The limited data
for C. elegans and the fungal VDAC genes did not allow
conclusions to be made; as more complete sequences
become available a more detailed examination of these
groups of organisms can be carried out.

Comparison of animal mitochondrial porin gene structures
Comparison of animal mitochondrial porin gene structures. The exonic and intronic regions of mitochondrial porin open reading frames were mapped for a variety of organisms. The gene structure for all species was retrieved from the NCBI genome
database using BLASTN or map viewer programs to analyze the ORF of each porin cDNA. Data were derived from the
sequences described in the legend to Figure 8. Only regions of the gene containing ORFs are shown; chromosome number is
indicated beside the species in Roman numerals and plus (+) or minus (-) strand reading frames are indicated beside chromosome number. Where multiple spliceoforms exist, as for human VDAC2, the form not listed as a splice variant was used.
Lengths of exons in bp are indicated inside the boxes representing the exons; the numbers of the corresponding amino acid
residues are indicated below the boxes. Lines indicate introns, the sizes of which are indicated in kb above the line; the intron
phase (0, 1, or 2) is indicated directly above the intron size. Phase 0 introns do not interrupt codons, whereas phase 1 and
phase 2 introns are positioned after the first and second nucleotides of the codon, respectively. The positions of the coding
sequence for the GLK (diamonds) and the eukaryotic porin (circles) motifs are shown above the intron/exon map. Filled and
open symbols indicate matches and imperfect matches to these motifs, respectively.

arrangement across the outer membrane. The eventual
acquisition of detailed secondary structural information
through x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies will allow proper
assessment of the models developed in this study. This
work also revealed sequence motifs characteristic of the
members of the crown groups of organisms. The GLK
(and homologous or analogous motifs) and the eukaryotic porin motifs in the Chordates tend to be in exons that
appear to have changed little during the evolution of these
metazoans. Further sequence data will allow further
refinement of these motifs, and data from organisms such
as stramenopiles, will allow more complete analysis of
this poorly-represented group. Finally, intriguing connections between intron location and predicted structural features were observed. Our data support the notion that
introns usually do not interrupt structural protein motifs,
namely the predicted β-strands in this case. Among the
metazoans two conserved porin sequence motifs (GLK
motif and the "eukaryotic porin signature motif") are confined to potentially "old" exons, as suggested by the fact
that these exons tend to be flanked by introns that usually
are in the same phase (phase correlation). These observations concur with the concept of exon shuffling, wherein
exons encode structural modules of proteins and that
throughout the evolution the loss and gain of introns and
the shuffling of exons via recombination events contributes towards the complexity of modern day proteomes
[70,72]. The relevance of these observations will be come
clearer as more genomic sequences and structural data
become available for mitochondrial porins and other βbarrel, membrane spanning proteins.

Methods
Database searches for porin sequences
A variety of databases were searched in order to obtain
VDAC sequences. Using a variety of different porin
sequences as queries, GenBank was searched via blastp
and tblastx against previously published VDAC sequences
from related organisms. Porin sequences were also
extracted from the genome sites listed in [Additional File
1]. Additional genome sequences were accessed via
Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences [73],
Broad Institute Fungal Genome Initiative [74] and The
Institute for Genomic Research [75,76].

Over 280 potential/putative VDAC homologs were recovered from various databases. We also examined "chloroplast VDAC-like sequences", putative VDAC sequences
from the slime molds, the causative agents of malarial diseases and microsporidia. However, for these we could not
generate reliable alignments, with the exception of a plastid porin from Zea mays (TC249611). In particular, the
putative VDAC sequences obtained from obligately intracellular parasites and the amitochondriate microsporidia

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/31

appear to have evolved too quickly to yield meaningful
comparisons. This is not surprising as these VDAC
sequences likely have degenerated in these organisms or
may have acquired or been co-opted for a new function.
Thus, these VDAC-like sequences were excluded from our
phylogenetic analysis.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Sequences were aligned with the Clustal-X program [77]
and manually refined with an alignment editor program
(GeneDoc v2.5.010; [64]). The alignment was also refined
with the online PRALINE multiple sequence alignment
program [78,79] and this program was utilized for its secondary structure prediction capabilities [80]. The final
data set comprised a total of 244 sequences [Additional
File 3] and consisted of 372 nonambiguously aligned
positions [Additional File 4]. A second data set was generated from the original alignment by extracting 141
sequences that represented the major groupings observed
in the analysis of the larger data set. The smaller alignment
was used in the Bayesian analysis that was very time consuming.

Phylogenetic trees based on Neighbor-Joining (NJ) were
generated for the large (n = 244) and smaller data set (n =
141) using programs PROTDIST [JTT setting [81] and
NEIGHBOR (NJ setting); these programs are contained
within PHYLIP (Version 3.63, [82]). Bootstrap replicates
(1000) were generated with SEQBOOT (PHYLIP) and
evaluated with NJ analysis in combination with the CONSENSE program (PHYLIP) for obtaining a majority rule
consensus tree.
Bayesian analysis was performed with the MRBAYES (version 3.1) program [83]. The necessary NEXUS file format
for the alignment (input) file was generated with the file
conversion option available within the DAMBE program
[84]. The settings for MRBAYES were as follows: amino
acid substitution model: mixed, gamma distribution with
4 gamma rate parameters. The Bayesian inference of phylogenies was initiated from a random starting tree and
four chains were run simultaneously for 2 000 000 generations, with trees sampled every 100 generations. The first
25% of trees generated were discarded ("burn-in") and
the remaining trees were used to compute the posterior
probability values.
The phylogenetic trees and dendrogram presented were
drawn with the TreeView program [85] using the PHYLIP
or MRBAYES tree outfiles, and annotations were added to
the figures with the aid of Corel Draw (Corel Corporation
Limited).

Secondary structure predictions
Secondary structure predictions were obtained using all
plant, animal and fungal sequences aligned with PRALINE in individual groups, and as a whole set. Predictions
were performed using Version 2 of SSPRO [86] following
multiple alignment. Similar results (data not shown) were
obtained with YASPIN [87]; some predicted β-strands
were one or two residues longer in the YASPIN predictions, but otherwise their locations were the same. Based
on analysis by EVA [88], the SSPRO algorithm results in a
lower level of "confused" α and β-strand predictions than
does YASPIN (BAD 3.0 vs 6.3), while the latter program
generates higher percentages of correctly predicted strands
compared to observed strands (QE%E60 72% for YASPIN
vs 61% for SSPRO).

sequences. The phylogenetic tree is based on a NJ majority rule consensus
tree constructed by analysing 1000 bootstrap replicates. Levels of confidence for nodes are only given if bootstrap support exceeded 70%. The
chordate VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3 groupings are indicated; the
dashed portion of the line encompassing the VDAC3 group indicates putative VDAC3 molecules. Yeast VDAC1 and VDAC2 groupings are also
shown. The putative VDAC2 of C. glabrata is highly diverged from the
other yeast VDAC2s, but has been labelled VDAC2 as a strong candidate
