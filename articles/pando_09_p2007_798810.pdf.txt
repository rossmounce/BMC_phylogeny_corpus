The objective is to estimate HIV incidence and characterize subtypes among recently diagnosed individuals from
different at-risk populations (men who have sex with men
(MSM); female and male drug users (FDUs and MDUs);
female, male and transvestite sex workers (FSWs, MSWs
and TSWs)) and pregnant women (PW) from Argentina in
the context of a Global Fund Project (Sub-project N°112).

PW, respectively. HIV incidence estimates by STARHS
were 6.36, 1.62, 2.73, 6.08, 11.31, 0.62 and 0.05 per 100
person-years for MSM, MDUs, FDUs, MSWs, TSWs, FSWs
and PW, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
122 (61.6%) samples were subtype B, 74 (37.4%) were
inter-subtype BF recombinants and 2 (1.0%) were subtype C. In all groups, men had higher prevalence of subtype B.

Methods

Conclusion

From October 2006 to September 2008, HIV prevalence
surveys were conducted among MSM, FDUs, MDUs,
FSWs, MSWs, TSWs and PW. Volunteers older than 18
years old without previous HIV positive diagnosis were
interviewed and tested for HIV. HIV positive samples were
analyzed by the Serological Testing Algorithms for Recent
HIV Seroconversion (STARHS) to estimate incidence. By
partial RT-PCR and sequencing of HIV pol gene HIV subtype was determined.

Given the high HIV prevalence and incidence found in
this study, it is imperative to have a well documented
molecular profile of the epidemics in these groups. The
high incidences observed in most of them make them
suitable for considering them as potential volunteers in
vaccine trials.

Background

Results
A total of 12,200 volunteers were recruited in the crosssectional HIV prevalence surveys. HIV prevalence between
self-reported HIV negative or unknown status was 10.4%
(161/1549), 5.1% (24/473), 2.9% (7/241), 10.8% (12/
111), 33.9% (38/112), 1.9% (21/1112) and 0.12% (10/
8570) for MSM, MDUs, FDUs, MSWs, TSWs, FSWs and
