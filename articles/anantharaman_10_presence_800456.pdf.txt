Thg1-type 3'- 5'nucleic acid polymerases and the
origin of the GGDEF and CRISPR polymerase
domains
Discovery notes

Abstract
Background: Almost all known nucleic acid polymerases catalyze 5'-3' polymerization by mediating the attack on an
incoming nucleotide 5' triphosphate by the 3'OH from the growing polynucleotide chain in a template dependent or
independent manner. The only known exception to this rule is the Thg1 RNA polymerase that catalyzes 3'-5'
polymerization in vitro and also in vivo as a part of the maturation process of histidinyl tRNA. While the initial reaction
catalyzed by Thg1 has been compared to adenylation catalyzed by the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, the evolutionary
relationships of Thg1 and the actual nature of the polymerase reaction catalyzed by it remain unclear.
Results: Using sensitive profile-profile comparison and structure prediction methods we show that the catalytic
domain Thg1 contains a RRM (ferredoxin) fold palm domain, just like the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,
reverse transcriptases, family A and B DNA polymerases, adenylyl cyclases, diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF domain) and
the predicted polymerase of the CRISPR system. We show just as in these polymerases, Thg1 possesses an active site
with three acidic residues that chelate Mg++ cations. Based on this we predict that Thg1 catalyzes polymerization
similarly to the 5'-3' polymerases, but uses the incoming 3' OH to attack the 5' triphosphate generated at the end of the
elongating polynucleotide. In addition we identify a distinct set of residues unique to Thg1 that we predict as
comprising a second active site, which catalyzes the initial adenylation reaction to prime 3'-5' polymerization. Based on
contextual information from conserved gene neighborhoods we show that Thg1 might function in conjunction with a
polynucleotide kinase that generates an initial 5' phosphate substrate for it at the end of a RNA molecule. In addition to
histidinyl tRNA maturation, Thg1 might have other RNA repair roles in representatives from all the three
superkingdoms of life as well as certain large DNA viruses. We also present evidence that among the polymerase-like
domains Thg1 is most closely related to the catalytic domains of the GGDEF and CRISPR polymerase proteins.
Conclusion: Based on this relationship and the phyletic patterns of these enzymes we infer that the Thg1 protein is
likely to represent an archaeo-eukaryotic branch of the same clade of proteins that gave rise to the mobile CRISPR
polymerases and in bacteria spawned the GGDEF domains. Thg1 is likely to be close to the ancestral version of this
family of enzymes that might have played a role in RNA repair in the last universal common ancestor.

Findings
Nucleic acid polymerase activity has emerged independently in at least four structurally unrelated folds, namely
the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) fold (also known as

ferredoxin fold in the SCOP database), the double ψ-beta
barrel, the polβ-like and TOPRIM folds [1-3]. Yet, all of
these polymerases are only known to catalyze 5'-3' chain
elongation by adding a nucleotide phosphate derived
from a 5' nucleotide triphosphate substrate to the 3' OH
of the prior nucleotide. This reaction might occur in a
nucleic acid template-dependent or template-indepen-

dent manner based on the polymerase in question. However, in the past few years a notable exception to this has
emerged in form of the histidinyl tRNA guanylyl transferase (Thg1), which is highly conserved in eukaryotes,
and also found in several archaea and more sporadically
in bacteria [4]. This enzyme was originally characterized
as synthesizing the guanine nucleotide at the -1 position
of the histidinyl tRNA (HtRNA). HtRNA is distinct from
all other tRNAs in possessing a unique extension of G-1
at the 5' end that is complementary to the position 73 at
the 3' end, just upstream of the terminal CCA triplet. In
most bacteria, the G-1 is genomically encoded and left in
place due to exceptional processing by the RNAse P
ribozyme [5]. However, in eukaryotes and several archaea
this G-1 is added by the Thg1 [4]. In eukaryotes the reaction proceeds in a template-independent fashion, as the
position 73 nucleotide in HtRNA is an adenine. However,
the archaeal HtRNA possesses a cytosine and the
archaeal Thg1 elongates the 5' end in a template-dependent manner [6]. Furthermore, this 3'-5' template-dependent polymerization has also been demonstrated for the
yeast enzyme when supplied with the appropriate cytosine-containing templates [7]. The Thg1 polymerization
reaction has been shown to be processive in terms of
being able to add further nucleotides in the 3'-5' direction, if appropriate templates are supplied. Accordingly, it
has been proposed that this polymerase activity is likely
to have been the ancestral activity of the Thg1 enzymes
across the superkingdoms of life [6].
In the case of the template-independent ligation of G-1
the reaction proceeds via an initial adenylation of the 5'
phosphate by Thg1 resulting in a 5' App overhang [7].
This is then attacked by the 3'OH of GTP to release an
AMP and add G at the -1 position. A similar ligation reaction can occur in the absence of ATP if the 5'end of the
tRNA substrate contains a preexisting triphosphate terminal [4]. In the processive template-dependent polymerization reaction Thg1 uses the terminal 5' triphosphate
generated by addition of the initial nucleotide to add further nucleotides via attack of this triphosphate by the
3'OH of the incoming nucleotide. Initially, the first step in
the template independent addition of G-1 catalyzed by
Thg1 was compared to the adenylation reactions catalyzed by the tRNA synthetases that result in release of
AMP [7]. However, the template-dependent polymerization reaction closely resembles the conventional polymerization reaction, except that the driving energy is
supplied by the nucleotide triphosphate anchored to the
5' end of the polynucleotide rather than from the free incoming nucleotide as seen in conventional 5'-3' polymerization reactions. While site-directed mutagenesis has
identified residues important for catalysis by Thg1, to
date no relationship has been shown to any other known
catalytic domain [8].

We were interested in the unusual catalytic properties
of Thg1 and were intrigued by its mysterious evolutionary affinities. As a part of our effort to understand the
origins of nucleic acid polymerization, we investigated
Thg1 using sensitive sequence-profile methods and
showed that it belongs to the RRM-fold nucleic acid polymerase palm domains. Furthermore, we show that it is
most closely related to the catalytic domains of the diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF) and CRISPR system polymerases and provides new information regarding the
origin and functions of these domains.
Identification of a diguanylate cyclase-like catalytic domain
in the Thg1 polymerases

To investigate the affinities of the Thg1 polymerase, we
initiated sequence profile searches using the PSI-BLAST
program [9] with several representative Thg1 proteins as
seed sequences. In parallel we also initiated iterative hidden Markov model searches with the Jackhmmer program (For detailed Material and Methods refer to
Additional File 1). These searches recovered sequences of
Thg1 orthologs from diverse organisms belonging to the
three superkingdoms of life. Additionally, at convergence
in PSI-BLAST searches of the non-redundant/NR database, we also observed hits to GGDEF domains from different signaling proteins with marginal e-values. For
example, a search initiated with Pyrobaculum aerophilum
Thg1 recovered GGDEF proteins from Hahella chejuensis (gi: 83644929 e = .053 and Thermosipho africanus (gi:
217076806, e = .06). Although, these hits had only marginal significance, they perfectly aligned with the three
principal acidic catalytic residues of the diguanylate
cyclases/GGDEF domain (Fig. 1). Similarly, in a search
with the JACKHMMER program using Pyrobaculum
aerophilum Thg1 as a query against the NR database we
recovered GGDEF domains (e.g. Thermosipho africanus;
gi: 217076806) with conditional e-values as low as 6.1 ×
10-5. We then predicted secondary structure using the
Jpred program [10] with an alignment including all complete Thg1 sequences in the NR database and compared
it to the crystal structure of the GGDEF domain (PDB:
3ign). The predicted secondary structure of Thg1 showed
a conserved core of 4 strands and two helices (Fig. 1, 2)
with absolutely conserved acidic residues at the end of
the first strand and between strands 2 and 3 which form a
hairpin. The location of these conserved residues in Thg1
with respect to the secondary structure corresponded
precisely to the arrangement of the three acidic catalytic
residues in the structure of the GGDEF domain. To further test this potential relationship, we used a HMM
derived from the multiple alignment of the Thg1 proteins
in profile-profile searches against two libraries of HMMs
with the HHpred program [11]: 1) HMMs derived from
the alignments in the PFAM database and 2) HMMs

Figure 1 Multiple alignment of Thg1 catalytic domain with other RRM-fold polymerase domains. A. Multiple sequence alignment of the Thg1
catalytic domain was constructed using Kalign after parsing high-scoring pairs from PSI-BLAST search results. The alignment with the other RRM-fold
polymerase plam domains was constructed based on the PSI-BLAST search results, pairwise alignments produced by the profile-profile searches with
the HHpred program against the Thg1 catalytic domain, and DALI searches with the X-ray structures shown in the alignment (PDB codes). The secondary structure from the crystal structures is shown above the alignment with E representing a strand and H a helix. The 90% consensus shown below the alignment was derived for the Thg1 catalytic domains alone using the following amino acid classes: hydrophobic (h: ALICVMYFW, yellow
shading); small (s: ACDGNPSTV, green); polar (p: CDEHKNQRST, blue) and its charged subset (c: DEHKR, pink), and big (b: FILMQRWYEK; grey shading).
The limits of the domains are indicated by the residue positions, on each end of the sequence. The numbers within the alignment are non-conserved
inserts that have not been shown. The sequences are denoted by their gene name followed by the species abbreviation and GenBank Identifier (gi).
The active site residues are marked with a blue box. The mutated residues that affected Thg1 activity are shown below the alignment with orange
circles. B. Multiple Alignment of the C terminal extension of the Thg1 domain. The multiple alignments of the C terminal extension of the Thg1 domain
was constructed as described above. The abbreviations and legends are also as above.

derived from searches seeded with representatives of
structures in the PDB database. Both searches recovered
the GGDEF domain as the best hit with significant p-values (p = 10-7-10-6). Additional profile-profile searches
with an in-house group of profiles, which includes
domains not properly represented in PFAM, recovered
the catalytic domain of the polymerases of the CRISPR
system [12]. This strongly suggested that the core conserved domain in Thg1 indeed adopts a GGDEF-like fold
and is likely to contain a similar active site configuration
with three acidic residues.

Thg1 shares a unified active site and likely catalytic
mechanism with other RRM-fold polymerase palm domains

The identification of a GGDEF-like catalytic domain in
the Thg1 polymerases connects them to one of the largest
group of nucleic acids polymerases, namely those that
share a RRM-fold palm domain. The core group of these
enzymes includes: 1) RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
of positive strand RNA viruses and their derivatives (viral
RdRP); 2) reverse transcriptases (RT); 3) DNA polymerase family B, including the archaeo-eukaryotic replicative enzymes; 4) the DinB-like DNA-repair

Figure 2 Catalytic mechanism, topology of catalytic domain and contextual inference of Thg1 function. A. Contextual Network of Thg1 domain with the blue edges indicating architectural contexts and the dotted red edges indicate predicted gene neighborhood contexts in prokaryotes.
B. Examples of conserved gene neighborhoods of the prokaryotic Thg1 genes. The arrows indicate genes in an operon in the 5'-3' direction. The gene
name Thg1 gene and organism from which the representative gene neighborhood has been extracted is shown below each representation. C. Simplified catalytic schemes for the GGDEF and RNA polymerase enzymes are shown along with Thg1 to illustrate the reaction differences. The Thg1 reaction scheme also includes the predicted reaction for the polynucleotide kinase (PNK) present in conserved gene neighborhoods with Thg1.
Standard names are used for all enzymes. The "...n" is a placeholder for a polynucleotide chain. D. The topology of the Thg1 catalytic domain is shown
as cartoon based on structure prediction and alignment with known RRM-fold polymerase palm domain structures. The conserved residues predicted
to be required for catalysis are shown. The C terminal extension is also shown in the colored box. We predict that this extension will be able fold on
the rest of the protein to be in proximity with the catalytic site and substrate. E. A phylogenetic tree of the Thg1 proteins was derived using the seed
alignment similar to that shown in Fig. 1 with the FastTree program. Only the major phyletic groups supported with bootstrap values greater than
85% are shown. The thickness of a given branch is approximately proportional to the number of proteins contained within it.

polymerases; 5) DNA polymerase family A; 6) the phage
T7-type DNA polymerases; 7) the phage T7-type DNAdependent RNA polymerases; 8) the TV-polymerase
family; 9) the CRISPR-system polymerases; 10) GGDEF
domains; 11) nucleotide cyclases (cAMP and cGMP generating enzymes) [1,12]. The catalytic domains of all
these enzymes are based on a RRM-like fold with 4
strands and 2 helices that forms a structure termed the
palm domain. Furthermore, all the above enzymes are
unified by a common set of acidic active site residues that
are present at the end of strand 1 (nearly always an aspartate) and in the hairpin between strand 2 and 3 (usually a
dyad of acidic residues; a single acidic residue in the

nucleotide cyclases; Fig. 1) [12]. These residues together
coordinate two Mg2+ ions that are central to the catalytic
mechanism of these enzymes. A common mechanism is
deployed irrespective of whether an enzyme of this family
catalyzes elongation of a polynucleotide chain or nucleotide cyclization (Fig. 2). The Mg2+ ions direct the 3'OH
of the nucleotide to attack the 5' triphosphate either on
the same nucleotide (cNMP generation) or a second
nucleotide (polymerization and cyclic diguanylate generation). A comparison of the Thg1 catalytic core with that
of the palm domain from the above enzymes shows that it
shares with the GGDEF, CRISPR, viral RdRP and RT the
configuration of the active site at the hairpin, i.e. two

acidic residues preceded by a small residue (Fig. 1). Consistent with the recovery of the GGDEF and CRISPR
polymerase domains in searches with Thg1, they specifically share the absence of an insert between the strand 1
and helix 1 that is typical of all the other nucleic acid
polymerases (Fig. 1). Thus, they are likely to share a closer
common ancestor to the exclusion of other polymerase
palm domains.
These observations suggest that 3'-5' polymerization
catalyzed by the Thg1 polymerase domains is likely to
depend on a Mg2+-dependent catalytic mechanism as in
case of the other polymerase palm domains (Fig 2). However, in the case of Thg1, the 3' OH of the incoming
nucleotide is directed by the cations to attack the 5'
triphosphate present at the end of the elongating chain.
Thus, in a sense this reaction is equivalent to one of the
two nucleotide ligations performed by the GGDEF
domain in the synthesis of cyclic diguanylate (Fig. 2). Further, like many of the CRISPR polymerases, Thg1 contains a highly conserved positively charged residue 2
positions upstream of the predicted catalytic aspartate in
the first strand of the palm domain. Based on its location
it is conceivable that it plays a role in interacting with the
negatively charged 5' triphosphate at the end of the elongating chain. The Thg1 palm domains also possess a
region of conservation at the N-terminus of strand 4 (typically DxR) that is absent in other palm domains. Based
on its position it is predicted to flank the acidic residue
on strand 1 on the side opposite to the Mg2+ chelating
site. It is conceivable that these residues unique to Thg1
play an important role in the initial adenylation reaction
required to prime polymerization. Consistent with our
proposals, a subset of the above-discussed residues that
were targeted in the site-directed mutagenesis study of
yeast Thg1 resulted in inactive enzymes (Fig. 1) [8]. Most
nucleic acid polymerases contain an insert (e.g. a helixturn-helix domain) between strand 1 and helix 1 of the
palm domain, which forms a module called the "fingers"
(Fig. 1) [1]. The fingers might play a key role in holding
the nucleic acid template; however, it appears to be
absent in the Thg1 polymerases, just as in several CRISPR
polymerases [12]. In contrast, Thg1 polymerases contain
an additional region of conservation C-terminal to the
core palm domain that appears to form a distinct module
comprised of 5 helices and two strands. This region is
characterized by several well-conserved charged residues
(Fig. 1). In particular a basic residue found towards the
end of the first helix of this unit might contribute to the
Thg1-specific active site along with the above-described
DxR motif (Fig. 2). Some of these were targeted in the
mutagenesis study of yeast Thg1 and resulted in enzymes
with significantly reduced catalytically activity [8]. Hence,
we posit that this C-terminal module of Thg1 is likely to
form a helical bundle that functions equivalently to the

fingers of the other nucleic acid polymerases, probably in
interacting with the template HtRNA (Fig. 2).
Contextual information throws additional light on the
functions of the Thg1 polymerases

The 3'-5' polymerization activity of Thg1, along with the
presence of a genomically encoded -1 position in archaea
and bacteria, raises questions regarding the actual function of this enzyme in these organisms. To investigate
their potential functions we resorted to contextual information provided in the form of domain architectures and
gene neighborhoods, which has proven to be a powerful
tool in dissecting functions of uncharacterized proteins
[13]. In terms of domain architectures, majority of the
Thg1 proteins are standalone versions. The Thg1 proteins from seed plants display a duplication of the catalytic domain. While both copies are predicted to be
catalytically active, only the C-terminal one retains the
DxR signature at the beginning of strand 4, suggesting a
possible separation of the initial adenylating and subsequent polymerization reactions between the two
domains. In both bacteria and archaea we found Thg1 to
be encoded in distinct gene-neighborhoods that are conserved across phylogenetically distinct lineages (Fig. 2). In
bacteria the most persistent association is with a P-loop
kinase of the polynucleotide kinase family [14]. Additionally, a subset of these predicted operons include a gene
encoding a MACRO domain protein [15,16]. Furthermore, some bacterial gene neighborhoods also show an
association between Thg1 and genes encoding a RNA
ligase (Fig. 2, Additional File 1). The strong association
with the polynucleotide kinase is functionally relevant
because this enzyme is known to phosphorylate the 5'
OH of RNA - thus, it can generate the phosphorylated 5'
terminus, which is the substrate for all experimentally
characterized versions of the Thg1 family. We also
observed that, in a contextual network prepared from
domain architectures operonic associations and physical
interactions, Thg1 occupies a position comparable to two
other structurally unrelated but catalytically similar
nucleotidyltransferase domains (Fig. 2), namely the CCAadding enzyme/poly A polymerase and the RNA ligase.
Like Thg1, the RNA ligase uses a 5' phosphate produced as a result of RNA repair by the polynucleotide
kinase as a substrate to mediate ligation of two polynucleotide chains (e.g. in tRNA splicing) [17]. MACRO domain
proteins also function in RNA-splicing reactions and
have been implicated in binding ADP-ribose and in
hydrolyzing the 1'' phosphate of ADP-ribose-1''-phosphate (Appr1p) generated during splicing [15,16]. Hence,
it is possible that the MACRO domain enzymes encoded
by a subset of these predicted operons might hydrolyze or
bind the App formed at the 5' end of the RNA and thereby
regulate the activity of Thg1. In archaea the only persis-

Anantharaman et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:43
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/43

tent genomic association that we recovered was with a
gene encoding a protein with a PRC barrel domain. We
had previously shown that the PRC barrel is a potential
RNA-binding domain [18]; in this case it could function
as a substrate-binding partner of the Thg1 protein. In
conclusion these associations strongly support a RNArelated function for Thg1 in all the three superkingdoms
of life. Further, the specific association with enzymes
such as polynucleotide kinase, the MACRO domain and
RNA ligase suggests that Thg1 might have a previously
unappreciated role in tRNA repair and splicing. Hence, it
is possible that its 3'-5' polymerase activity has a significant role in repair of small RNAs, including tRNAs by
probably by catalyzing 3'-5' RNA polymerization or by
catalyzing RNA ligation via generation of a 5' App.

Evolutionary considerations and general
conclusions
While representatives of the Thg1 family are present in
all the three superkingdoms of life, they are far more
prevalent in eukaryotes and archaea than in bacteria.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Thg1 proteins fall
into two major clusters separated by an internal long
branch (Fig. 2, Additional File 1). The first of these clusters is almost entirely comprised of eukaryotic proteins
with the deepest split being that of Trichomonas vaginalis, which is believed to be an early-branching eukaryote.
Further, within the eukaryotes, monophyletic lineages
such as animals, plants, apicomplexans and ciliates can be
discerned suggesting that Thg1 was present in the common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes (Fig. 2). The second
cluster is dominated by archaeal Thg1 orthologs, with
representatives from euryarchaea, crenarchaea and
korarchaea, suggesting that Thg1 was present in the
ancestral archaeon. Nested within this group are several
bacterial versions distributed along with different
archaeal groups (Fig.2, Additional File 1). A few bacterial
versions also appear to have been independently transferred to eukaryotes such as slime molds and Naegleria
(Additional File 1). In particular slime molds possess multiple copies of Thg1, of both the eukaryotic and bacterial
type that are all predicted to be catalytically active
enzymes. This is unusual as Thg1 is typically present in a
single copy per genome, reflective of its specific role in
HtRNA maturation. Likewise in seed plants there appear
to be multiple copies of the eukaryote-type enzyme with
two tandem Thg1 modules. In these cases it possible that
the Thg1 paralogs have acquired additional RNA repair
functions. Two large DNA viruses, the mimivirus and the
caudovirus 201varphi2-1 which infects Pseudomonas
chlororaphis, also possess their own copies of the Thg1
protein - it is unclear if these viruses needed a dedicated
HtRNA maturation enzyme or else use it in an alternative
RNA repair mechanism aimed against host defenses.

Together, the phyletic distribution and phylogenetic picture suggests that Thg1 originated in the common ancestor of the archaeo-eukaryotic lineage, with more than one
lateral transfer from archaea to different bacterial lineages.
The above finding that Thg1 is specifically related to
the GGDEF and CRISPR polymerases raises interesting
evolutionary and functional issues in light of its inferred
point of origin. The GGDEF domains are found in all
major bacterial lineages and are inferred to have been
present in the common ancestor of the bacterial lineage
[19], functioning specifically as a cyclic-diguanylate-generating signaling enzyme. In contrast to most other signaling domains of bacterial provenance, the GGDEF
domain is surprisingly entirely absent in eukaryotes [19].
Similarly, conventional GGDEF domains involved in signaling are also absent in archaea, though we observed a
small family of archaeal relatives of the GGDEF domain
typified by MK0296 from Methanopyrus kandleri (Fig. 1).
These are predicted to be active enzymes as they retain
the three acidic catalytic residues in the RRM-fold palm,
but are unlikely to be signaling proteins as they lack associations with any of the typical signaling domains that are
always seen in conventional bacterial diguanylate cyclase
proteins. We hence postulated that the cyclic diguanylate
could be potentially toxic in the archaeo-eukaryotic lineage, perhaps due to interference with a key polymerase
active site [19]. The CRISPR polymerase domains are
highly mobile along with rest of the CRISPR system,
though their predominance in archaea might suggest an
initial origin in that lineage [12,20,21]. Thus, most parsimoniously the last universal common ancestor (LUCA)
already possessed a distinct version of the RRM-fold
palm domain that was the common ancestor of the Thg1,
GGDEF and CRISPR polymerase catalytic domains. This
ancestral version of the palm domain was already distinct
from other RNA and DNA polymerase catalytic domains
of the RRM-like fold (Fig. 1). From this ancestor, in the
bacterial lineage the GGDEF domain arose, whereas the
Thg1 progenitor arose in the archaeo-eukaryotic lineage.
Likewise it appears probable that the CRISPR polymerase
domain emerged early in the archaeal lineage followed by
extensive lateral transfer due to it adaptive role in defense
against selfish elements [20,21]. Interestingly, some versions of the GGDEF are known to bind RNA, rather than
catalyze cyclic diguanylate formation [22]. Furthermore,
recognition of cyclic diguanylate occurs predominantly
via RNA molecules i.e. riboswitches, rather than through
protein domains (unlike what is observed with cyclic
nucleotides like cAMP and cGMP) [19,22].
These findings suggest that the common ancestor of
these three families of enzymes might have primarily
acted on RNA substrates and that the Thg1 polymerase
might represent an activity close to the ancestral state.

Anantharaman et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:43
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/43

Given that certain reconstructions of LUCA posit a notable role for RNA-based genetic material [23], it is possible
that this ancestral enzyme might have had a prominent
role in LUCA as an enzyme that repaired RNA through
its polymerase or nucleotidyltransferase activity. However, with the emergence of DNA-based genetic material,
its descendant Thg1, in the archaeo-eukaryotic lineage,
might have been relegated to a rather subsidiary role in
tRNA maturation. Its descendant in the bacterial lineage
was recycled as a diguanylate cyclase in a signaling context, whereas the polymerase of the CRISPR system
emerged early in archaeal evolution retaining a function
closer to its ancestor. Indeed, incorporation of the
HtRNA G-1 position into the genome might have allowed
Thg1 to be lost in several lineages. These considerations
raise the interesting possibility that some GGDEF
domains might have RNA-specific nucleotidyltransferase
activity and that the CRISPR polymerase, like Thg1, catalyze 3'-5' polymerization. Further investigation of the biochemical predictions presented here might provide novel
insights into the function and evolution of nucleic acid
polymerases.

Response

As indicated above the Thg1 orthologs from seed plants
have a duplication of the Thg1 polymerase domain. The
N-terminal domain lacks the DxR motif associated with
secondary active site. We propose that in this case there
could be a "division of labor" with the N-terminal domain
mediating chain elongation but the C-terminal domain
capable of adenylation as well as polymerization.
2. Do the authors find the N-terminal helical extension
region to the core RRM domain present in most of
Thg1 family proteins? If it is true, do the authors think
there is any potential role for this region in directing
the specificity for 3'-5' polymerization?
Response

Reviewer's Comments

The N-terminal helix is present in all the Thg1 proteins.
It is certainly functionally important because mutation of
a glutamate in this helix reduces activity. However, there
are no absolutely conserved residues suggesting that it is
unlikely to contribute directly to the active site. It could
instead play a role in dimerization.
3.Does the C-terminal HTH-like region of Thg1 have
roles other than contributing to active-site biochemistry, like mediating interactions with nucleic acids or
proteins?

In this manuscript titled "Presence of a classical RRMfold palm domain in Thg1-type 3'- 5'nucleic acid polymerases and the origin of the GGDEF and CRISPR polymerase domains" Anantharaman et al report the
computational discovery of a RRM-fold domain in Thg1
family proteins and its evolutionary relationship to bacterial GGDEF domains and CRISPR polymerases, which are
predominantly found in archaea. The authors also provide detailed descriptions of their catalytic sites and functional contexts based on amino-acid residue
conservations, domain architectures and protein interaction information. Further, the authors discuss the common
evolutionary origins of Thg1, GGDEF and CRISPR polymerase families and propose a biochemical role for the
RRM-fold palm domain in LUCA. The manuscript
reports fascinating findings and would aid future experimental investigations along these lines. I strongly support
the publication of the manuscript in Biology Direct.
Few points to the authors:
1. Do all Thg1 family proteins have secondary catalytic site or is there any exception? If there is one, in
that specific case, can the authors comment on how the
adenylation process would be coupled to 3'-5' polymerization?

It could interact with the nucleic acid template comparable to the "fingers" module of other nucleic acid polymerases. However, beyond this there is no available
evidence that it mediates other interactions.
4.Thg1p of budding yeast seems to form a homodimer
based on protein interaction data from two independent experiments. Would this information be helpful
in providing additional insights into the functional
contexts of Thg1 family?
Response

The seed plant versions contain two distinct Thg1
domains that might show functional differentiation (see
above). This observation, together with evidence from
yeast for homodimerization, suggests that the Thg1 protein is indeed likely to function as a dimer. It remains to
be seen if this dimerization might imply partitioning of
adenylation and polymerization between the two monomers in the functional unit.
5.Thg1p of budding yeast seems to be associated with
Orc2p directly in a complex. Again based on the protein- and genetic- interaction data Thg1 (in budding
yeast) seems to be associated with proteins/genes
involved in DNA replication/repair. Is it possible that
the Thg1 family proteins could function in the context
of DNA replication/repair as well?
Response

This is indeed an intriguing observation - given that Thg1
shows both physical and genetic interactions with Orc2 it
is likely that this association is functionally relevant. Of

Anantharaman et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:43
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/43

the other genetic interactions of Thg1 there are multiple
interactions with genes involved in tRNA- or translationrelated functions such as Hts1: the histidinyl tRNA synthetase which utilizes the HtRNA produced by Thg1 as a
substrate, Trm11: the tRNA methylase which methylates
G10 of tRNAs, and Tma64: a protein with a RNA-binding
Sui1 domain involved in RNA processing. These are consistent with the role of Thg1 in HtRNA maturation. However, in addition to Orc2, Thg1 shows genetic interactions
with other DNA replication related genes such as Pol32: a
winged HTH containing subunit of the DNA polymerase
delta required for replication and error prone repair, and
Mrc1: A regulator of replication and repair. This suggests
that role of Thg1 in DNA replication might indeed be relevant. While there is currently no biochemical evidence
that throws light on this role, it would be of interest to
investigate if its adenylation or polymerization activity
might have a direct role in processes such as priming and
ligation.
6.The authors could indicate catalytic residues explicitly (although mutation data has been mapped) in the
figure 1A. This would greatly aid in comprehending
the relevant parts of the manuscript.
Response

The proposed catalytic residues have been indicated by
means in blue boxes in Fig. 1.

This incisive study from Aravind's shop uses cuttingedge bioinformatics analyses to add yet another colorful
piece to a jigsaw puzzle of the early life origins and evolution. It starts with a relatively obscure albeit mechanistically enigmatic class of Thg1 enzymes involved in
maturation of a single tRNA, tRNAHis. Unexpectedly, it
uncovers relationships of Thg1 with GGDEF-like catalytic
domains, CRISPR system polymerases that are very much
in vogue, and, finally, connects them to a vast class of
RRM-fold palm domain polymerases.
Being a virologist turned cell biologist, I am not in position to comment on the intricacies of the methodology
used to unveil structural, mechanistic and phylogenetic
relationships of Thg1; I simply trust the authors by virtue
of their impressive record. Rather, I would like to emphasize the most intriguing implications of their work. First,
their study suggests likely catalytic mechanisms for both
Thg1 and CRISPR polymerases that are experimentally
testable. Second, it divines the evolutionary scenario for
Thg1, GGDEF domains, and CRISPR polymerases that,
although not immediately testable, proposes a feasible
and broad RNA repair role for their common ancestor.
This possibility, in turn, strengthens the argument for pri-

mordial RNA-based genetic systems allowing for more
faithful RNA replication and larger RNA-based genomes.
In addition, it stimulates further inquiry into extant RNA
repair systems, a relatively young research area that
recently uncovered RNA repair roles for the cellular and
viral AlkB demethylases [1,2].
