Abstract
Background: The snake venom gland is a specialized organ, which synthesizes and secretes the complex and abundant toxin
proteins. Though gene expression in the snake venom gland has been extensively studied, the focus has been on the components
of the venom. As far as the molecular mechanism of toxin secretion and metabolism is concerned, we still knew a little.
Therefore, a fundamental question being arisen is what genes are expressed in the snake venom glands besides many toxin
components?
Results: To examine extensively the transcripts expressed in the venom gland of Deinagkistrodon acutus and unveil the potential
of its products on cellular structure and functional aspects, we generated 8696 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a nonnormalized cDNA library. All ESTs were clustered into 3416 clusters, of which 40.16% of total ESTs belong to recognized toxincoding sequences; 39.85% are similar to cellular transcripts; and 20.00% have no significant similarity to any known sequences.
By analyzing cellular functional transcripts, we found high expression of some venom related genes and gland-specific genes, such
as calglandulin EF-hand protein gene and protein disulfide isomerase gene. The transcripts of creatine kinase and NADH
dehydrogenase were also identified at high level. Moreover, abundant cellular structural proteins similar to mammalian muscle
tissues were also identified. The phylogenetic analysis of two snake venom toxin families of group III metalloproteinase and
serine protease in suborder Colubroidea showed an early single recruitment event in the viperids evolutionary process.
Conclusion: Gene cataloguing and profiling of the venom gland of Deinagkistrodon acutus is an essential requisite to provide
molecular reagents for functional genomic studies needed for elucidating mechanisms of action of toxins and surveying
physiological events taking place in the very specialized secretory tissue. So this study provides a first global view of the genetic
programs for the venom gland of Deinagkistrodon acutus described so far and an insight into molecular mechanism of toxin
secreting.
All sequences data reported in this paper have been submitted into the public database [GenBank: DV556511-DV565206].

Background
Venomous snakes possess one of the most sophisticated
integrated weapons system in the natural world. It has
been hypothesized that the snake venom gland itself
evolved in the mouth region as a consequence of an evolutionary change in the pancreatic trait, and consequently,
some of the toxins should show strong affinities to pancreatic proteins [1]. Recent studies suggested that snake
venom components such as phospholipase A2 have
evolved in an accelerated manner to acquire their diverse
physiological activities [2]. Most studies of snake venom
glands have focused almost exclusively on the components of venom. Therefore, a fundamental question being
arisen is what genes are expressed in the snake venom
glands besides many toxin components? To obtain a more
comprehensive view of function of the venom gland, it is
necessary for us to choose a proper model to study gene
expression and toxin diversity in snake venom gland and
perform comparative research with other species.
Deinagkistrodon acutus (D. acutus) is a specific snake in
Southern China and many toxin components from the
venom gland of D. acutus have been purified and characterized [3-6]. More studies for D. acutus venom gland will
promote the application of toxin in medicine. To our best
knowledge, there is little information about the D. acutus
venom gland at the molecular level. This problem is compounded by the limited number of annotated D. acutus
nucleotide sequences currently deposited in the public
databases (<82). For this reason, D. acutus should be a
good model for use in studying gene expression and organogenesis in snake venom gland. Analysis of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) is an efficient approach for gene discovery, expression profiling [7-9] and development of
resources useful for functional genomics studies. For this
purpose, we decided to adopt the strategy of large scale
sequencing by constructing a cDNA library from the
venom gland of D. acutus. Thus we should be able to find
relevant genes and investigate their function after screening and expressing the target genes.
Knowledge of genes and proteins expressed in the various
venom glands offers a potential resource to guide future
investigations relevant to biology of venom gland and
toxicology. For instance, proteins secreted from the
venom gland of D. acutus represent a subset of candidates
potentially involved in local and systemic effects as pain,
edema, bleeding and muscle necrosis. Moreover, gene cataloguing and profiling of the venom gland of D. acutus is
an essential requisite to provide molecular reagents for
functional genomic studies needed for the elucidation
mechanisms of action of toxins and the discovery of their
antagonists [10]. On the other hand, it will allow the identification of cellular functional transcripts that may represent a general panorama of the physiological events of the

venom glands, surveying gene expression from the very
specialized secretory tissue.

Results and discussion
Overview of ESTs from the venom gland of D. acutus
After discarding the poor-quality sequences, 8696 highquality ESTs were used to analyze gene expression profile
in the venom gland of D. acutus. The mean read length of
ESTs was 398 bp (ranging from 50 bp to 772 bp, Figure 1).
Subsequently, ESTs were clustered into 3416 clusters, of
which 118 clusters (40.16% ESTs) associated with toxin
function has been reported elsewhere [11]. In this report,
we discussed mainly 1184 clusters (39.85% ESTs)
involved in the cellular functional transcripts and other
novel sequences (Figure 2). The distribution of all ESTs
was followed:

(1) Twenty-five clusters consisted of more than 50 ESTs
each, which represented the most abundant transcripts
and encoded known proteins. They constituted 0.73% of
the total clusters (25 of 3416 clusters) including 26.16%
of total ESTs (2275 of 8696 ESTs). Interestingly, half of
the most abundant transcripts were previously reported
metalloproteinase from venom gland of D. acutus [11],
indicating high prevalence. Of these 25 clusters, eight
clusters are known genes that belong to housekeeping
genes and two are toxin secretion related genes (Table 1).
(2) Thirty-nine clusters consisted of 20–49 ESTs each and
represented 1.14% of the total clusters (39 of 3416 clusters) and 13.26% of the total ESTs (1153 of 8696 ESTs).
Of 39 clusters, 13 encoded non-toxin functional proteins,

such as myosin, NADH dehydrogenase subunit, cytochrome oxidase subunit and calmodulin protein. They are
the second most abundant mRNA transcripts in the
venom gland of D. acutus.
(3) Seventy-five clusters contained 10–19 ESTs each, and
represented 2.20% of the total clusters (75 of 3416 clusters) and 11.83% of ESTs (1029 of 8696 ESTs), of which
17 clusters encoded the genes for troponin, ATPase subunits, retrotransposable-like elements and elongation factor 1-alpha, etc. They are considered medium-sized
clusters with relatively low prevalence.
(4) The low abundant 445 clusters consisted of 2–9 ESTs
each and constituted 13.03% of the total clusters (445 of
3416 clusters) and 13.69% of the total ESTs (1425 of
8696 ESTs). They included many toxin coding genes, cellular functional transcripts and partial unknown protein
e.g., jerdonitin, proline dehydrogenase and hypothetical
proteins.
(5) There are 2832 unique ESTs representing 82.9% of the
total clusters (2832 of 3416 clusters) and 32.57% of ESTs
(2832 of 8696 ESTs). The occurrence rate of these clusters
is only once in current sequenced ESTs. They included
cytokine-like molecule, zinc finger proteins, transport
proteins and transcripts without hits to GenBank nonredundant proteins (nr) and nucleic acids databases (nt).
The distribution of these cluster sizes are shown in Figure
3.
The cDNA library constructed is a non-normalized primary library without amplification, so the clone abundance or the cluster size presents the relative mRNA

(1153 of 8696 ESTs), 75 clusters contained 10~19 ESTs

population [12]. About one-third of the total clones are
singletons, and approximately one-fourth of the ESTs fit
in clusters that are comprised of more than 50 ESTs, representing the complexity and specificity of the transcript
population of the venom gland of D. acutus.
ESTs relevant to protein processing
A homologue of Bothrops insularis calglandulin EF-hand
protein family is identified at high abundance (81 ESTs)
in current library (Table 1). Calglandulin EF-hand protein
as a venom gland specific gene has been reported [13]. It
has several conserved Ca2+ motifs and is expressed exclusively in snake venom glands from many species, but not
secreted to the venom. This protein family functions in
the process of exporting toxins out of the cell and into the
venom [14], implying that it plays a fundamental role in
toxin secretion process [15]. In this library, three EF-hand
protein families were found, of which two showed high
identity with Bothrops insularis EF-hand protein family and
another showed homology only with Mus musculus calmodulin. The diversity of EF-hand proteins in the venom
gland of D. acutus may suggest the complexity of toxin
secretion activity. The other high expression gene encodes
the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which was represented by 58 ESTs in the library. The PDI from D. acutus
showed 77.9% of identity with Gallus gallus PDI. The PDI
is a redox protein responsible for disulfide bond assembly
in the endoplasmatic reticulum. We also found a significant frequency difference of cysteine residues between
toxin protein and cellular functional proteins (data not

shown) in the venom gland of D. acutus, suggesting that
the PDI plays a key role in toxin protein folding. Furthermore, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are also identified (15
ESTs) in this library including HSP20, HSP70 and HSP90.
HSPs are chaperon for protein refolding and degeneration, which is possibly important to toxin proteins regeneration. There are many ribosomal proteins found in this
library, which contributes to the high level of protein synthesis events. A large number of ribosomal proteins therefore are needed for the toxins synthesis [16]. Several other
identified transcripts can also shed light on the physiological aspects of the venom gland secretion style. For

instance, various clusters involved in transporter activity
are found, e.g., ion transporters (uni4929105), nucleoside transporters (uni7320865) (see Additional File). All
these suggested that the venom gland of D. acutus is a
highly specialized active organ that plays a central role in
secreting toxins and polypeptides with powerful synthesis
capabilities.
ESTs relevant to structural components and energy supply
There are abundant structural component transcripts
expressed in the venom gland of D. acutus, encoding actin,
troponin, calsequestrin and myosin (Table 1). Interest-

ingly, these cellular structural components from the
venom gland are similar to ones from mammalian muscle
tissue, which may indicate that the structure of the venom
gland cavity is similar to muscle tissue and contributes to
the venom gland contractile activity. Accordingly, it could
be explained that creatine kinase expressed highly in the
venom gland of D. acutus, accounting for 2.49% (217
reads) of all ESTs (Table 1). Because creatine kinase is an
important enzyme regulator of high-energy phosphate
production and utilization within contractile tissues, high
expression of the enzyme is adapted to energy need for
gland contraction. Furthermore, abundant transcripts
expressed in current library also involved in cytochrome
b, cytochrome oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase, which
are also needed to meet energy needs for toxin protein
synthesis and gland contraction.
Enzymes relevant to metabolism pathway
In this library, several enzymes in metabolic pathways
such as glucose metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism were found (Table 2). In energy and
material metabolism, 22 clusters sequences were identified to play a role in glucose metabolism. We also identified that unigene uni4505467 and unigene uni41055552
code for the 5'-nucleotidase, which suggests that D. acutus
may possess a functional pathway for purine metabolism
and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism in the
venom gland. The 5'-nucleotidase participates not only in
purine metabolism but also in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Snake envenomation employs three
well-integrated strategies: prey immobilization via hypotension, prey immobilization via paralysis, and prey
digestion. Purines (adenosine, guanosine and inosine)
constitute the perfect multifunctional toxins, and evidently play a central role in all three envenomation strategies of most advanced snakes [17].
ESTs relevant to other function
Surprisingly, 18 clusters (21 ESTs) encoding for reverse
transcriptase were found in current library. They are similar to reverse transcriptase from teleost LINE family SW1
[18]. At the same time, we identified retrotransposablelike elements in this library (16 ESTs), most of them similar to ORF2 protein from a Platemys spixii retrotransposon
CR1 [19]. So we could expect an intact retrotransposable
structure in the D. acutus genome. This specific retrotransposable element in the D. acutus genome may be adapted
to environmental diversity and prey need.

So far, we still have not determined the complete functional categories of genes expressed in the venom gland of
snake. To give an overview of the major cellular roles, the
number of partial mRNA transcripts represented in each
category is listed (Additional file) based on molecular
function of Gene Ontology [20]. A major proportion (38

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/152

clusters) represent transcripts involved in the binding category, corresponding to 34.86% of genes of molecular
function and 1.33% of total unigenes, respectively. Based
on Gene Ontology function classification, 824 clusters
(3144 ESTs) are assigned into the organizing principle of
molecular function and 1719 clusters (5472 ESTs) of biological process (Figure 4). However, such an analysis only
gave a hint of what the function might be and, in many
cases, extensive biochemical and biological work is necessary to unambiguously identify a gene and its function
[21]. We have presented here an initial analysis of those
relevant to physiological cellular proteins.
ESTs identifying no significant matches to known genes
There are 1553 clusters (54.40%) without significant
homology to any known genes in GenBank. According to
sequences discarding criteria (less than 50 bp), we could
exclude the possibility that too short sequences lead to no
hits. The high abundant novel sequences represent a large
number of unidentified genes, suggesting the complexity
and diversity of genes expressed in the venom gland of D.
acutus. In addition, among those clusters without significant matches to known genes, 11 clusters have matches
with the dbEST database and 344 clusters with the hmmpfam database. Some of those clusters, such as unigene

region
of
disintegrin,
and
unigene
rfstda0_001953.y1.scf for Conotoxin I-superfamily, indicated new toxins among those sequences. The high abundance of these sequences might correspond to the
unknown toxin genes stored in the venom gland of D.
acutus. Further study of these novel genes expressed in this
specialized organ could disclose the mechanism of toxin
secretion and the evolution of the snake venom gland.
Comparative analysis with other snakes venom glands
Although several cDNA libraries from the venomous
gland of a few snakes have been reported and characterized [10,15,22], analysis of transcripts from these cDNA
libraries seldom involve cellular functions as the main
attention was focused on the toxin components. Many
components of toxin in the venom gland have been identified [11], but nerve growth factor (NGF) has not been
identified in this library. In contrast to previous reports
[10,15], we postulate an alternative possibility for not
identifying NGF in this library: one is that the NGF might
express under the specifically physiological conditions,
such as in milking venom gland of D. acutus; another is
that NGF is not a necessary component of toxin of D. acutus. Furthermore, a lot of clusters that may be involved in
many physiological process of venom gland remained to
be deciphered. It is significant to study the gene expression of venom gland of snake on cellular structure and
functional aspects, which will improve the study of some
physiological process such as organogenesis, cell differen-

tiation and protein synthesis. Alternatively, some secreted
membrane proteins may represent antigens of potential
importance to immune control.
Phylogenetic analysis of toxin related genes in D. acutus
Snake venom glands evolved once, at the base of the colubroid radiation, 60–80 million years ago, with extensive
subsequent "evolutionary tinkering" [23,24]. The
advanced snakes (superfamily Colubroidea) make up
>80% of about 2900 species of snake currently described,
and contain all of the known venomous forms [1]. Generally in this library, toxin clusters match sequences from
snake sources in database while the cellular functional
transcripts are identified by its similarity to model organisms such as Gallus gallus, Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus. Of note, although those transcripts of toxin are always
phylogenetically closer from another snake, the average of
similarities over toxins and cellular functional transcripts
has no obvious difference. From the view of evolution, we

postulated that the toxins tend to diverge due to natural
selective pressure to adapt to different environmental conditions (mainly distinct preys). Whereas, most of the cellular components showing similarities with mammalian
proteins, although they are usually phylogenetically distant, correspond to proteins of conserved functions
among vertebrates and thus show higher homology [15].
The origin and evolution of many toxin gene families in
the advanced snakes have been researched extensively
[1,24,25]. Among these toxin gene families, most were
recruited into the advanced snakes before the split of elapids and viperids. However, the phylogenetic analysis of a
few other toxin gene families, such as phospholipase A2
and natriuretic toxins provide a clear evidence of an independent recruitment event. Because of limited toxin gene
sequences in public databases, the origin and evolution of
a number of toxin gene families remain unknown. In this
report, we analyzed the phylogeny of the group III snake

venom metalloproteinase and serine protease. The group
III snake venom metalloproteinase consists of a proprotein, a metalloproteinase, a disintegrin and a cysteine-rich
domain. It inhibits the integrin receptor selectively. Figure
5 described the phylogenetic analysis of this group III
metalloproteinase in Colubroid. The phylogenetic model
of this metalloproteinase is similar to CRISP protein [24],
which was recruited into the advanced snakes before the
split of elapids and viperids. That is the advanced snake
acquired the group III metalloproteinase genes by an early
single recruitment event. Subsequently, this metalloproteinase family evolved independently in elapids and
viperids. We also analyzed the phylogeny of the serine
proteases in suborder Colubroidea and similar results were
shown (Figure 6). But serine protease genes have not been
identified in elapids, which suggested the gene loss events
in the evolutionary process or insufficient sequences
information of elapids.

Conclusion
This study identified and characterized the cellular functional transcripts in the venom gland of D. acutus extensively. Our aim is to develop a catalog of genes transcribed
in this snake venom gland. We hoped to discover as many
toxin and cellular coding genes as possible by constructing five fraction sub-libraries. The venom gland of D. acutus expresses many protein-coding sequences that are too
divergent from those at present in GenBank to provide
identification. Moreover, we found as many unidentified
protein-coding sequences as identified ones. The prevalence distribution also provides a reasonable estimation
of the actual frequency of these sequences in the venom
gland of D. acutus. Furthermore, we have described a
number of recognized molecules previously not known to
be expressed in the venom gland of D. acutus, i.e., dehydrogenase and calglandulin EF-hand protein families.
Though it is of relatively small size, analysis of this set of
ESTs has yielded several kinds of useful information pertaining to the unmilked venom gland of D. acutus. It is,
therefore, likely that the generation of more sequence data
will result in the identification of novel D. acutus genes. In
addition, many ESTs do not have significant database
matches and these open up new avenues of exploration.
This report successfully provides evidence about the function of snake venom gland and a source of reptilian
sequences. Gene cataloguing and profiling of the venom
gland of D. acutus is an essential requisite to provide
molecular reagents for functional genomic studies needed
for elucidating mechanisms of action of toxins and surveying physiological events taking place in the very specialized secretory tissues. So this study provides a first
global view of the genetic programs for the venom gland
of D. acutus described so far and an insight into molecular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/152

mechanism of toxin secreting in the very specialized
organ.

Materials and methods
Library construction
A non-normalized cDNA library was generated from the
venom gland of D. acutus. The D. acutus was captured
from Wuyi Mountain, Fujian Province, China. After killing the snake by cutting the head, the venom glands were
recovered. All tissues were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen. The total RNA was isolated with Trizol Reagent
(Invitrogen) and the mRNA was purified with Oligotex
mRNA Kits (Qiagen). The cDNA synthesized with Superscipt II-RT (Invitrogen) and DNA polymerase I
(Promega), was flanked by EcoR I adaptor (Stratagene)
and treated by Xho I (Stratagene). The double strand
cDNA was extracted by electrophoresis separation with
five fractions (<0.25 kb, 0.25~0.5 kb, 0.5~1 kb, 1~2 kb
and > 2 kb) and then cloned into EcoR I and Xho I
digested pBluescript II vector. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli (DH10B) to amplify the cDNA.
EST sequencing, data processing and bioinformatics
analysis
The cDNA clones were picked randomly. Plasmids were
isolated according to a standard alkaline lysis protocol,
and sequenced with MegaBACE 1000 (Amersham Pharmacia). Base-Calling was performed with PHRED [26],
the cutoff Phred score was 20 [27]. Original sequences
were generated by removing vector and E. coli DNA
sequences using Cross-match [26]. High-quality ESTs
were assembled into contigs using Phrap software [26].
Default settings were used except 40 bp minimum overlap
and 99% identity. To assign annotation to the assembled
ESTs (clusters), these sequences were searched against the
nr (E values < 1e-5) and nt (E values < 1e-10) for homology comparison using BLASTX and BLASTN [28]. Then
those clusters without significant matches to known genes
were compared to the dbEST database by BLAST and pfam
database by hmmpfam [29]. All assembled sequences
having the same annotation were further clustered into a
unique gene. Based on Gene Ontology classification, we
constructed a gene expression profile of the venom gland
of D. acutus. In order to comprehend the role of those
transcripts played in the biochemical process, we assigned
enzyme functions and enzyme commission numbers to
reconstruct anabolic and catabolic pathways through linkage to biochemical pathways in the KEGG database [30].
The phylogenetic analysis of toxin protein families was
conducted by MEGA 3.1 [31].
