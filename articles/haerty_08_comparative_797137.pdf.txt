Abstract
Background: Much of the morphological diversity in eukaryotes results from differential
regulation of gene expression in which transcription factors (TFs) play a central role. The nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model organism for the study of the roles of TFs in
controlling the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression. Using the fully sequenced genomes of
three Caenorhabditid nematode species as well as genome information from additional more
distantly related organisms (fruit fly, mouse, and human) we sought to identify orthologous TFs and
characterized their patterns of evolution.
Results: We identified 988 TF genes in C. elegans, and inferred corresponding sets in C. briggsae
and C. remanei, containing 995 and 1093 TF genes, respectively. Analysis of the three gene sets
revealed 652 3-way reciprocal 'best hit' orthologs (nematode TF set), approximately half of which
are zinc finger (ZF-C2H2 and ZF-C4/NHR types) and HOX family members. Examination of the
TF genes in C. elegans and C. briggsae identified the presence of significant tandem clustering on
chromosome V, the majority of which belong to ZF-C4/NHR family. We also found evidence for
lineage-specific duplications and rapid evolution of many of the TF genes in the two species. A
search of the TFs conserved among nematodes in Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus and Homo
sapiens revealed 150 reciprocal orthologs, many of which are associated with important biological
processes and human diseases. Finally, a comparison of the sequence, gene interactions and
function indicates that nematode TFs conserved across phyla exhibit significantly more interactions
and are enriched in genes with annotated mutant phenotypes compared to those that lack
orthologs in other species.
Conclusion: Our study represents the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of TFs across
three nematode species and other organisms. The findings indicate substantial conservation of
transcription factors even across distant evolutionary lineages and form the basis for future
experiments to examine TF gene function in nematodes and other divergent phyla.

Background
The growing availability of the whole-genome sequences
of eukaryotes has accelerated large-scale functional studies to understand the mechanisms of animal development
and evolution [1-4]. Many of these studies have highlighted the importance of regulatory evolution and the
fundamental role that transcription factors (TFs) play in
this process. Alterations in TF function and regulation are
linked to phenotypic variation [5-7] as well as numerous
pathologies, including cancers [8,9]. Therefore, a detailed
analysis of sequence and function of TFs across animal
phyla will provide important information about their
evolutionary patterns, thereby increasing our ability to
understand the molecular basis of diseases and organismal complexity. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
serves as a powerful model organism to unravel TF function due to the wealth of available resources and the ease
with which it can be reared, maintained, and manipulated
in the laboratory [10]. The completion of its genome
sequence has aided in the design of large-scale experiments that are beginning to elucidate the complexity of
transcriptional regulation and gene interaction networks
in multicelllular eukaryotes [11,12]. The recent releases of
the genome sequence of two other Caenorhabditid species,
C. briggsae [13] and C. remanei [14], provide an excellent
opportunity for genome-wide study of the conservation
and evolution of transcription factors across nematodes.
These three species are estimated to have shared a common ancestor between 20–120 million years ago [13-15]
and while they are morphologically similar, studies have
shown differences in development and behavior [16].
As a first step in facilitating the comparative study of TFs
in nematodes, we have compiled an updated list of putative TF genes in C. elegans and used it to identify orthologs
in C. briggsae and C. remanei. Our results show that twothirds of all C. elegans TF genes have 3-way one-to-one
best reciprocal orthologs in the other two species, whereas
the remaining third are either species-specific paralogs or
too divergent to assign proper orthologous relationships.
We observed that among Caenorhabditid species, although
TF genes have a greater sequence divergence than the non-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/399

TF genes, they exhibit significantly more detectable interspecific orthologs than non-TF genes. We also identified
150 best reciprocal orthologs of the TF genes conserved
among nematodes in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster),
mouse (Mus musculus), and human (Homo sapiens) many
of which are associated with known disorders. We also
examined the relationship between gene function and
interactions, the results of which demonstrate that conserved TF genes exhibit a significantly greater number of
interactions and are more likely to be associated with
mutant phenotypes when compared to those that lack
detectable orthologs. Our findings provide a framework
for future studies of nematode TFs and facilitate the development of resources allowing us to study morphological
and developmental diversity in metazoans.

Results
The C. elegans TF gene set
As a first step in the identification of TFs in Caenorhabditid
species, we generated an updated list of putative C. elegans
TF genes by searching its annotated genome sequence
(Wormbase WS173 release) [17] for gene ontology (GO)
terms associated with transcription factors. This led to the
identification of 1271 putative TF genes (Table 1). Since
our criteria for selecting a TF was the presence of a welldefined DNA binding domain that selectively modulates
gene transcription (for example, bHLH or homeobox), we
manually inspected the above list of putative TFs. This
allowed us to reject 564 genes as false positives since these
encode factors that are associated with the basal transcriptional apparatus (for example, DNA polymerases), chromatin alterations, DNA packaging (histones), as well as
entries that were incorrectly curated in Wormbase (Additional files 1, 2, 3). To the remaining genes (707), we
added 281 TF encoding genes found in published literature and other public database entries that were not identified in our initial search (See Materials and Methods).
The final C. elegans TF set included a total of 988 genes
(Table 2 and additional file 4), of which 917 are shared
with the previously annotated C. elegans TF set (wTF2.0,
934 genes) [18]. The 17 genes in the wTF2.0 set that are
not shared in our updated set either lack a known DNA

present TF set likely results from the availability of annotations published since the compilation of wTF2.0.
Identification of transcription factors in nematodes and
other phyla
We used the newly defined C. elegans TF set to search for
homologs in the fully sequenced genomes of C. briggsae
(CB3 release) and C. remanei (11/29/2005 release)
[17,19,20]. We used InParanoid [21] to identify 713 and
703 best reciprocal hit orthologs in C. briggsae and C.
remanei, respectively (Table 2, see Material and Methods).
To these lists, we added 282 C. briggsae and 390 C. remanei
putative TF genes that were identified through Hidden
Markov Model (HMM)-based searches [22]. Altogether, a
total of 995 and 1093 potential TF encoding genes were
identified in C. briggsae and C. remanei, respectively (Table
2 and additional files 6 and 7). Among the TF orthologs
in the three nematode species, we identified 652 genes
that exhibit a 3-way best reciprocal BLAST orthologous
relationship (hereafter referred to as the nematode TF set)
(Figure 1). The proportion of C. elegans TF genes with
detectable orthologs in C. briggsae (713/995, 71.7%) is
significantly higher compared to the proportion of all
conserved genes between the two species (12858/20621,
62.4%) [13] (χ2 = 7.56, df = 1, p = 6.0 × 10-3), which may
indicate strong selective pressure to maintain these genes.

To examine the evolutionary conservation of the nematode TF set of genes in other phyla, we searched for their
orthologs in the genomes of fruit fly(D. melanogaster),
mouse (M. musculus), and human (H. sapiens). Using
the InParanoid database [23] we identified a total of 150
TFs that exhibit reciprocal orthologous relationships
between three nematode species and are conserved in fly,
mouse, and human (Additional files 4 and 8).
Coding sequence divergence in nematode TF genes
Best-hit reciprocal orthologs could not be identified for
215 TF genes in C. elegans, 211 in C. briggsae, and 310 in
C. remanei (Figure 1 and additional files 4, 6, and 7). It

should be pointed out that C. briggsae and C. remanei TF
genes are based on computational predictions and that
the C. remanei genome has yet to be assembled; hence
while many of the TF genes without detectable orthologs
may have arisen by lineage-specific gene duplication, others could result from incomplete annotation of the C.
briggsae and C. remanei genomes. Therefore, the actual
number of divergent TF genes in these species is likely to
be smaller than the numbers we have estimated. To further study this set of genes in C. briggsae (211), we
searched for their closest homologs in C. elegans. This
revealed 30 genes with weak sequence similarity (BLASTP
E-value > 10-10) suggesting that these most likely represent
candidate C. briggsae-specific TF genes (Additional file 9).
The remaining 181 appear to be species-specific paralogs,
of which 69 are zinc finger-C4/nuclear hormone receptor
(ZF-C4/NHR) family members (see below).

Previous studies in humans and other organisms have
shown that TF genes tend to evolve more rapidly than
non-transcription factor (non-TF) genes [24-26], therefore we performed a similar analysis in nematodes by analyzing their coding sequence divergence and comparing it
to non-TF genes. Due to the large divergence times
between the three species [13,15], the rate of synonymous
substitution per synonymous site (dS) for many genes is

likely to be saturated (dS > 3, Figure 2A). Therefore we
restricted our analysis to the rate of non-synonymous substitution per non-synonymous site (dN), which does not
show such saturation [27]. We found a significantly
higher dN for TF genes conserved among nematodes (652)
when compared to 3-way conserved non-TF gene
orthologs (10,827 genes; Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p <
2.2 × 10-16; Figure 2B), whereas no difference was detected
between TF genes with orthologs in nematodes, fly,
mouse, and human (150) and non-TF genes (KruskalWallis test, p = 0.3498).
Distribution of TF families in C. elegans
We studied the distribution of protein families among C.
elegans TFs based on known DNA binding domains. This
analysis revealed more than 50 distinct families of which
30 were found to contain 5 or more members (Figure 3).
No significant difference was observed in the representation of various families between the C. elegans set and the
set conserved among three nematodes (χ2 = 35.05, df =
30, p = 0.2408), indicating that the distributions of TF
families in these species may be similar. The majority of
genes in C. elegans and nematode TF sets (28.6% and
20.5%, respectively) were found to encode the nuclear
hormone receptors (NHRs), a C4-type sub-family of zinc
finger proteins that play key roles in development and
homeostasis [28]. The NHR genes was previously shown
to have undergone extensive lineage-specific expansion in
C. elegans [29]. Besides NHR, HOX genes that regulate cell
fate specification and embryogenesis [30] are also among
the largest TF families in nematodes (11% of C. elegans TF
genes, and 11.6% of nematode TF genes) (Figure 3A, C).
In contrast, the distribution of TF families among the
divergent C. elegans gene set (215 genes) differs significantly from that observed among the entire C. elegans TF
set (χ2 = 83.91, df = 30, p = 5.33 × 10-7) due to its high proportion of NHR genes (52.6%, Figure 3B). Likewise, the
representation of different families among TF genes with
orthologs in nematodes, fly, mouse, and human also differs from that of the C. elegans TF set (χ2 = 152.27, df = 30,
p = 0, Figure 3D). Interestingly, the single largest conserved family represented among the orthologs in three
different phyla is HOX (17.3%), supporting multiple previous studies indicating the importance of this family
among all metazoans [18,30,31].
Chromosomal distribution of TF genes in C. elegans and
C. briggsae
Studies in C. elegans as well as other organisms have
shown that genes that are co-expressed and/or functionally related are frequently clustered together on chromosomes [32-36]. To investigate whether TF genes in
nematodes exhibit a similar pattern, we plotted the physical locations of C. elegans and C. briggsae TF genes using
non-overlapping windows of 200 kb (the genome of C.

remanei has not yet been assembled and therefore was not
used in this analysis). Figure 4 shows that TF genes in C.
elegans and C. briggsae as well as those that are conserved
among nematodes are non-randomly distributed on chromosomes. A total of 183 C. elegans TF genes were found to
be located in 25 distinct clusters (marked with stars in Figure 4A, Table 3). A similar pattern was observed in C.
briggsae (184 genes in 27 clusters) (Figure 4B and Table 3).

Chromosome V carries highest number of clusters (and
genes) in both species (C. elegans: 97 genes in 10 clusters;
C. briggsae: 64 genes in 7 clusters) (Table 3) that are primarily composed of NHR family members (92% in C. elegans and 84% in C. briggsae, red bars in Figure 4).
The analysis of the chromosomal distribution of TF genes
also revealed that many members of the large TF families,

(31.6% in C. elegans, 47.2% in C. briggsae) (Additional
files 10 and 11) suggesting significant lineage-specific
duplication and expansion of the tandem arrays.
Evolution of the Nuclear Hormone Receptor family in
nematodes
Our findings extend Robinson-Rechavi et al.'s analysis of
the extensive lineage-specific expansion of NHR genes in
C. elegans [29] to the other two Caenorhabditid species
(283, 232, and 256 NHR genes in C. elegans, C. briggsae,
and C. remanei, respectively). The sequence analyses
revealed a total of 134 NHR genes having 3-way bestreciprocal orthologs among the nematode species (Additional files 4, 6, and 7). The remaining NHRs are composed of what appear to be lineage-specific paralogs and
those that have diverged sufficiently in sequence such that
orthologous relationships could no longer be assigned.

We constructed a phylogenetic tree of the nematode NHR
family members (437 genes, see Materials and Methods)
to study their inter– as well as intra-specific relationships.
The most striking feature of the phylogeny is the frequent
presence of several closely related NHRs located tandemly
on the same chromosome (Additional file 12). Such
groupings suggest the presence of extensive tandem duplications, which could explain the mechanism behind the
expansion of the NHR gene family, and perhaps the independent occurrence of some NHR genes in the lineages of
each of these species. In the case of C. elegans NHRs, we
found at least 15 distinct groups on chromosome V
including 7 that are located in one large cluster of the phylogeny (Additional file 12).

such as ZF-C4/NHR, ZF-C2H2, T-box and HOX are
arranged in perfect tandem arrays (defined as having a
contiguous repetition of TF genes) (267 C. elegans genes in
103 arrays, 235 C. briggsae genes in 107 arrays), the largest
of which consists of 8 NHR genes in C. elegans and 6 NHR
genes in C. briggsae (Figure 5 and additional files 10 and
11). Although the majority of such arrays consists of genes
of the same TF family (76.7% in C. elegans and 67.3% in
C. briggsae), less than half of all genes found in such arrays
have best-reciprocal hit orthologs between the two species

The presence of NHRs in chromosomal clusters prompted
us to study their distribution in further detail. We identified a total of 47 tandem arrays composed of contiguous
repetitions of NHR genes in C. elegans, which are found
on all chromosomes with the exception of chromosome
III (Additional file 10). These include 10 arrays that are
comprised of 5 or more genes, all of which are located on
chromosome V. A similar analysis in C. briggsae identified
30 NHR arrays having 6 or fewer genes (Additional file
11). In total, 9 NHR arrays were partially or completely
conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae. One of these
arrays, for instance, consists of 7 genes in C. elegans (nhr136, nhr-153, nhr-154, nhr-206, nhr-207, nhr-208, and nhr209) and the corresponding 4 in C. briggsae (CBG23383/
Cbr-nhr-136, CBG23380/Cbr-nhr-153, CBG23380/Cbr-nhr154 and CBG23379/Cbr-nhr-209). This suggests that either
the array has expanded in C. elegans or perhaps lost 3 of
the genes in C. briggsae. Examination of the C. remanei TFs
revealed the presence of best reciprocal hit orthologs for
all array members found in C. elegans with the exception
of nhr-206 leading us to propose that nhr-207 and nhr-208
were most likely lost in the C. briggsae lineage. This analy-

sis, however, carries a caveat in that the annotations of the
C. briggsae and C. remanei genomes are based on computational predictions and lack experimental validation.
Finally, we found that 7 tandem arrays in C. briggsae are
composed of NHR genes that lack best reciprocal hit
orthologs in C. elegans and C. remanei (Additional file 11).
The largest of these is comprised of 6 NHR genes
(CBG01243,
CBG01244,
CBG01245,
CBG01246,
CBG01247, CBG01248) (Figure 5). These C. briggsae-specific arrays may be caused by lineage-specific expansion
although the possibility of a selective loss of their
orthologs in other species cannot be ruled out.
Comparison of TF gene sequence conservation and
function in C. elegans
We investigated the relationship between sequence conservation and function of TF genes in C. elegans. From a

comprehensive list of 13,647 RNAi phenotypes associated
with 4,351 genes [14], we identified 281 TFs that exhibit
one or more mutant phenotypes (Additional file 13).
These consist of more than half of all TF genes conserved
among nematodes, fly, mouse, and human (52.7%, 79 of
150), over one-third of genes conserved among the three
nematode species (36.5%, 238 of 652), and one-fifth of
the TF genes in C. elegans that did not have identifiable
orthologs in the other nematode species (20%, 43 of
215). We also determined the number of distinct mutant
phenotypes associated with TF genes in each of the above
three groups as well as with non-TF genes. This analysis
revealed that TF genes conserved among nematodes, fly,
mouse, and human are linked to a significantly greater
number of mutant phenotypes in C. elegans when compared to the other sets (4.38 ± 2.31, 3.36 ± 2.09, 2.91 ±
1.82 and 3.19 ± 1.84 phenotypes per gene for TF genes

gans TF genes without detectable orthologs in the other
nematode species and non-TF genes, respectively; KruskalWallis rank sum test, p = 8.58 × 10-3, 1.8 × 10-3, 1.32 × 1015, respectively, after Bonferroni correction). No difference
was found in pairwise comparisons between the other
gene sets (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test p = 1, in all comparisons after Bonferroni correction).
To further analyze the roles of C. elegans TF genes in specific tissues and developmental processes, RNAi phenotypes were sorted into six broad categories: viability
(embryonic and post-embryonic growth and survival),
fertility (germline and germ cells), sex (sex determination
and reproductive system), vulva (vulval cell proliferation
and morphogenesis), body (cuticle, size, and morphology), and behavior (movement and feeding) (Additional
files 13 and 14). Among the six categories, "viability"
ranks highest in terms of the proportion of TF and non-TF
genes (Figure 6). However, it is important to keep in mind
that this may be linked to a greater interest in identifying
transcription factors that are involved in growth and survival of C. elegans. A further sub-classification of this category into "embryonic viability" and "post-embryonic
viability" (based on the phenotype when lethality occurs
in RNAi-treated animals) revealed that among the
"embryonic viability" class TF genes conserved among
nematode species are significantly under-represented
when compared to the non-TFs (χ2 = 7.39, df = 1, p = 6.56
× 10-3) (Figure 6), while no difference was observed
among the datasets for genes affecting post-embryonic
viability (χ2 = 0.77, df = 1, p = 0.38). By contrast, the TF
genes conserved among nematodes, fly, mouse, and
human showed no enrichment for any of these two cate-

respectively). Among other categories, we observed an
over-representation of mutant phenotypes for nematodeconserved as well as nematode-fly-mouse-human-conserved TF gene sets associated with vulval development
(χ2 = 8.24 and 11.75, df = 1, p = 4.1 × 10-3 and 6.08 × 104, respectively) and sex determination and reproductive
system-related processes (χ2 = 9.51 and 8.78, df = 1, p =
2.04 × 10-3 and 3.59 × 10-3, respectively) when compared
to the non-TF gene set.
Phenotypes associated with nematode TF orthologs in fly,
mouse, and human
The above findings that more than half of C. elegans TF
genes conserved across phyla are associated with RNAi
phenotypes prompted us to examine their mutant phenotypes in other organisms. We found that 69 (46%) of TF
genes conserved among nematodes, fly, mouse, and
human are associated with lethal phenotype in fly (Additional file 15). In the case of mouse, out of a total of 81
orthologs for which knock out and mutant phenotypes
are described (see Materials and Methods), 75 (92.6%)
exhibit defects ranging from mild to gross abnormalities,
including lethality (Additional file 15). A similar analysis
in human revealed 35 TF genes linked to various diseases
and genetic disorders (Table 4). In total, 44 (29.3%) TF
genes regulating C. elegans development and behavior are
also essential either in mouse or human or both. These
include 30 genes that control viability in the fruit fly.
Overall, 121 (80.7%) TF genes conserved among nematodes, fly, mouse, and human play important roles in at
least one of these organisms. This is likely an underestimate due to technical limitations of RNAi experiments
(e.g., strains, redundancy of factors or pathways) and that
comparisons between organisms involve different experimental approaches (e.g., RNAi in C elegans and chromosomal mutations in D. melanogaster). Thus, functional
studies of conserved TFs in C. elegans promise to elucidate
mechanisms involved in biological processes conserved
across phyla.
Analysis of TF interaction networks in C. elegans
To further explore the mechanism of transcription factor
function in metazoans, we generated an interaction map
of C. elegans TF genes based on known physical and
genetic interactions [37,38]. The map consists of 1594
interactions involving 277 TF genes and their direct nonTF interactors (Figure 7A and additional file 16). The network appears to be scale free as seen by the presence of
several nodes with high degree of connectivity (such as
lin-35, which shows the highest number of interactions
and is connected to more than one-third of all existing
nodes; 521 of 1340) (Figure 7B). lin-35 is an ortholog of
the human Retinoblastoma (Rb) gene which plays an
important role in cell proliferation [39,40]. Among the

lin-35 interacting genes, 43 (8%) encode TFs, of which 18
have best reciprocal hit orthologs in mouse and human.
Other prominent hubs include pal-1 (conserved among
nematode species), as well as other TF genes with
orthologs in nematodes, fly, mouse, and human: tag-331,
eya-1, and sma-4 (Figure 7B). Each of these genes plays
important role in C. elegans development, and RNAimediated knock-downs cause defects such as slow growth
(pal-1), lethality (pal-1, tag-331), larval arrest (eya-1, tag331), uncoordinated movement (eya-1), and small size
(sma-4) [41-44]. Interestingly, the subnetwork comprising
of the hub gene tag-331 (human ortholog RNF113A) and
its 32 direct interactors appears to be largely isolated. A
closer examination revealed that two-thirds of these 22
genes are conserved in nematodes yet lack best reciprocal
hit orthologs in fly, mouse, or human genomes. The
remaining third includes four genes conserved in nematodes, fly, mouse, and human (zfp-1, R11F4.1, apl-1 and
fcd-2) and whose human homologs are linked to disor-

ders (AF10/MLLT10: leukemia, Glycerol kinase: hyperglycerolemia, APP: Alzheimer's, and FANCD2: Fanconi
anemia). It remains to be determined if the human genes
interact with RNF113A as well as whether RNF113A is
involved in any of these diseases. Among the remaining
hub genes, the eya-1 mammalian orthologs promote
development of tissues and organs [41,45,46] whereas the
sma-4 ortholog SMAD4/DCP4 acts as a tumor suppressor
[47-49].
In addition to analyzing the prominent hubs in the interaction network, we also examined the relationship
between connectivity of TFs, sequence conservation, and
known function. The results revealed a significantly
greater number of interactions among C. elegans TFs that
are conserved in nematodes, fly, mouse, and human, as
compared to those that are not (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum
test, p = 0.0207, after Bonferroni correction). We also
found that TF genes associated with mutant phenotypes in

The interaction network of C. elegans TF genes
The interaction network of C. elegans TF genes. (A) The breakdowns of TF nodes, non-TF nodes and gene interactions
in the network for each of the TF categories. The C. elegans-divergent category refers to TF genes that lack unique reciprocal
orthologs in other nematode species. (B) The network exhibits several high degree nodes, five of which – tag-331, eya-1, lin-35,
sma-4, and pal-1 – are boxed and shown at high magnification on the right (marked by arrows). The node colors mark different
TF genes (red: conserved among nematodes, fly, mouse, and human; yellow: conserved among the three nematode species;
green: C. elegans-divergent). The network was visualized by using Cytoscape [81].

RNAi assays exhibit significantly more interactions when
compared to those that lack a detectable phenotype
(Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p = 0.0069). These results
are consistent with previous studies showing that highly
connected hubs tend to be enriched in essential genes
[50,51].

Discussion
This paper presents the first genome-wide comparative
study of TF genes in nematodes and their orthologs in fly
(D. melanogaster), mouse (M. musculus), and human (H.
sapiens). We took both computational and manual curation approaches to compile sets of TF genes in three
Caenorhabditid species, leading to the identification of 988
genes in C. elegans, 995 in C. briggsae and 1093 in C. remanei. A comparison of these data sets has revealed 652 3-

way best reciprocal orthologs among these species. Furthermore, using currently available genome annotations,
we identified 150 TF gene orthologs shared among nematodes, fly, mouse, and human and shown that according
to mutant phenotypes or associated disorders, many of
these genes are functionally important. It should be noted
that many of the TF genes identified in C. elegans as well
as most of those identified as orthologs, paralogs, and
divergent in the other two nematode species are based
entirely on computational predictions, and thus await
experimental validation. However, the results of our study
suggest the most likely group of candidate genes from
which further experimental tests of TF activity can be
designed. In contrast, the majority of the orthologs identified in the two other phyla are annotated as TF genes

themselves, owing to the extensive experimental validation performed in these organisms.
The sequence comparison of orthologs among nematodes
has revealed that TF genes conserved among the three
nematodes species (652 genes) are evolving more rapidly
than non-TF genes, which is in agreement with earlier
reports from other species in which TF genes have been
shown to be evolving more rapidly than the coding
genome average, and that significantly more TF genes
have been found to be evolving under positive selection
when compared to the rest of the genome [24,25,52,53].
While our observation of a greater number of conserved
orthologs among all three nematode species, coupled to
an accelerated rate of divergence may seem paradoxical, it
may be suggestive of widespread positive selection, and
thus divergence, acting on genes that are otherwise functionally important. Given the wide estimates of the divergence time between the three nematode species
considered in this study, it is unsurprising that the rate of
synonymous substitution (dS) is saturated, and is therefore not amenable for use in analyses that could test the
hypothesis of widespread positive selection among TF
genes. Additional data, such as a large-scale polymorphism analysis among multiple Caenorabditid nematodes
could provide the sensitivity to test for evidence of differential selective pressure affecting specific gene groups.
The analysis of TF families in nematodes has revealed several interesting features, such as the high proportion of
C2H2 and C4/NHR class of zinc-finger family members
relative to the other TF families in all three species (see
Figure 3). It was previously shown that the NHR family
has undergone significant lineage-specific expansion in C.
elegans and C. briggsae [53]. Considering, for example, that
Drosophila and humans carry less than 50 identified NHR
genes (21 and 48, respectively) [54], the presence of more
than 200 genes in Caenorhabditid species is striking.
Although it remains to be seen whether all of these have
important roles to play, studies in C. elegans have shown
that roughly 10% of NHRs mediate diverse processes
including molting (nhr-23, nhr-25, nhr-67), neuronal differentiation (unc-55, fax-1), sex determination (sex-1),
and dauer formation (daf-12) [54]. We found that roughly
half of all NHRs in each of the Caenorhabditid species are
conserved as 3-way best reciprocal orthologs and another
10% exhibit 2-way orthologous relationships with at least
one of the other nematode species. The remaining NHRs
are likely to have arisen from lineage-specific gene duplications, suggesting that this class of TF may have a significant role in many of those differences that make
individual nematode species unique. While the expansion
of the NHR family in nematodes is certainly unusual,
other TF families show interesting lineage-specific features
as well. Previous studies as well as results presented here

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/399

indicate that TF families such as ZF-C2H2, HOX and Tbox have also diverged between the C. elegans and C.
briggsae lineages (see Figure 3B and additional file 9) [31].
Our work demonstrates that TF genes are non-randomly
distributed in the genomes of both C. elegans and C.
briggsae. We found that members of gene families such as
NHR, HOX, and T-box are frequently clustered and
present in tandem arrays. A subset of the rapidly evolving
NHR family of TF genes in C. elegans was previously
shown to be located on chromosome V [53,55,56]. We
have shown not only that C. briggsae exhibits a similar pattern, but also that the majority of the chromosome V
NHRs in both species is tandemly arrayed. Our finding
that many NHRs appear to be lineage-specific paralogs
suggests that gene duplication has played a significant role
in the expansion of this gene family in nematodes. The
phenomenon of gene clustering has been observed not
only in C. elegans, but also in other species such as D. melanogaster and mouse [32-34,55,57], and in some cases
these clusters are composed of genes that are co-expressed
[32,34]. While the precise mechanism of the origin of
such clusters remains to be determined, these may be
caused by small-scale regional translocations and illegitimate recombination events leading to tandem gene duplications [58,59].
Our study has revealed that C. elegans TF genes conserved
across multiple phyla are more likely to be associated with
mutant phenotypes when compared to the remaining TF
and non-TF genes. Likewise, the fly, mouse, and human
orthologs of C. elegans TF genes are enriched in essential
genes when compared to C. elegans TF genes without
detectable orthologs (46%, 50% and 23.3%, respectively).
The analysis of the relationship between gene function
and interactions revealed that TF genes conserved across
phyla exhibit greater number of interactions and mutant
phenotypes when compared to those that are divergent.
Among the TFs with described interactions, lin-35 (human
Rb ortholog) appears to have an exceptionally large
number of interactions. lin-35 is known to interact with
cell cycle-related and chromatin remodeling factors to regulate tissue growth and morphology [60,61]. We found
that among the lin-35 interacting genes, 43 (8%) encode
TFs, of which 18 have best reciprocal hit orthologs in
mouse and human. It is important to keep in mind that
conservation in sequence does not indicate the roles of
orthologous genes in regulating similar biological processes. Instead, it simply means that genes that are evolutionarily conserved are very likely to play important roles
in the development and functioning of the organism. Our
results are also consistent with studies in other organisms
that have found a significant correlation between connectivity, rate of evolution and gene dispensability (according
to lethal or sterile phenotype), even across multiple meta-

zoan phyla. In general, hubs with high degree of connectivity tend to be enriched in essential genes and appear to
evolve relatively slower than genes with lower connectivity [27,50,62-64].

Conclusion
This study describes a genome-wide analysis of TF genes
in three Caenorhabditid nematode species (C. elegans, C.
briggsae and C. remanei) as well as their orthologs in fruit
fly (D. melanogaster), mouse (M. musculus) and human
(H. sapiens). We observed a significantly higher conservation of orthology for the TF genes among Caenorhabditid
species, while also noting that the coding sequence of TF
genes diverges more rapidly than the coding genome average. Finally, the analyses of sequence conservation, gene
interactions, and function revealed that TF set conserved
in nematodes, fly, mouse, and human is significantly
more enriched in essential genes compared to those that
lack orthologs in other phyla. Our findings will serve as a
resource in aiding us to understand transcriptional networks and their conservation and divergence among
metazoa. The compilation of the TF sets also serves as a
stepping-stone in generating various resources such as
knock-out mutants, cDNA and promoter clones, and
reporter gene expressing lines, with the intent of systematically mapping and studying TF function in nematodes. In
parallel with many of ongoing initiatives in C. elegans
these resources will provide foundation for future studies
of the conservation of TF function and interaction across
the breadth of biodiversity.

Methods
C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. remanei TF gene sets
The C. elegans TF-encoding genes were searched using 8
GO terms (Table 1) within WS173 release of Wormbase.
The C. briggsae and C. remanei TFs were identified using
the HMMER [22,65] and InParanoid programs [21]. The
complete genome sequences of each of the three
Caenorhabditid species were downloaded from WormBase
(C. elegans release WS173, C. briggsae release WS173 and
C. remanei release 11/29/2005) [17]. As the C. remanei
predicted peptide dataset is known to contain redundant
copies of genes due to heterozygosity in the sequenced
genome, (E. Schwartz, personal communication) we used
the CD-HIT program (version 2007-0131) [66] in order to
cluster and remove all additional transcripts that had
greater than or equal to 98% sequence similarity to other
transcripts at the protein level. The original dataset of
25,948 transcripts was truncated down to 24,267 nonredundant transcripts that were used in further analysis
[27].

InParanoid was run with default values, using blastall version 2.2.14 with –VT emulation, on all three complete
genome predicted peptide datasets in pairwise compari-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/399

sons. The results were collected and placed into speciesspecific paralogs, 2- and 3-way best-hit reciprocal
ortholog categories using custom PERL scripts. Each category was searched for genes from the C. elegans TF set and
the number of TFs in each category was identified (Additional files 6 and 7). HMM alignment-based searches were
carried out on the C. briggsae and C. remanei predicted
peptides using previously established techniques [22,67].
The HMMER signature files (profiles) of known DNA
binding domains were retrieved from Pfam [68]. In most
cases, a cut-off score of 0.1 was used. If a HMMER predicted TF gene in non-elegans species lacked a homolog in
C. elegans, it was considered false positive and therefore
removed creating the final, conservative datasets that were
used in the study.
The C. elegans orthologs of D. melanogaster, M. musculus
and H. sapiens TFs were retrieved using the data available
on the InParanoid database [23,69].
Identification of the TF gene families
Genes were grouped into different families based on the
presence of known DNA-binding domains according to
the WormBase [14], Pfam [68], and InterPro [70] databases. Only well defined and unambiguous domains that
are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation
were considered. Families with fewer than 5 members
were placed together in a miscellaneous category. The TF
families shown in Figure 3 are as follows. AP2: Activator
protein-2 family; AT hook: AT hook DNA binding motif
(preference to A/T rich region) family; bHLH: basic helixloop-helix family; bZIP: basic leucine zipper family;
CBFB/NF-YA: CCAAT binding factor family; CSD: Cold
shock DNA binding domain family; HMG box: High
mobility group box family; HOX: Homeobox family;
MADF: Myb DNA binding domain family; SAND: DNA

NucP41/75, DEAF-1; SANT: Myb-like DNA binding
domain; SMAD: SMAD (Mothers against decapentaplegic
(MAD) homolog) domain family; T-box: T-box family;
WH: Winged-helix family; WH-FH: Winged-helix and
Forkhead domain family; WH-ETS: Winged-helix and ETS
domain family; ZF-C2H2: C2H2-type zinc finger protein

protein family; ZF-BED: BED-type zinc finger family; ZFC2H2-RING: C2H2 and RING-type zinc finger protein
family; ZF-C4/NHR: C4-type zinc finger/Nuclear hormone receptor family; ZF-CCCH: C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H class
of zinc finger family; ZF-DHHC: DHHC-type zinc finger

C4HC3 zinc-finger-like motif family; ZF-others: zinc finger family members not listed above; ZF-DM: DM (dsx
and mab-3) zinc finger family; ZF, AT hook: AT hook and

ger domain family; Misc: Miscellaneous TF family not
listed above.
Generation of the chromosomal map
The physical locations of C. elegans and C. briggsae TF and
non-TF genes were retrieved from Wormbase (WS173
release) and grouped into non-overlapping windows of
200 kb (similar to the 250 kb used by [33]). A 400 kb window analysis was also performed and the conclusions
remain the same (data not shown). Since many genes are
alternatively spliced, we eliminated transcript-specific
bias by focusing on single open reading frame for each
transcription factor. In the case of C. briggsae, a total of
1329 genes were not assigned to any of the chromosomes
and hence were excluded from the analysis. For simplicity,
we only used the average between the start and end positions as a proxy for the gene position. The significance of
TF clustering on chromosomes was determined by comparing their frequency with the overall frequency of genes
in a given window using a χ2 test [33]. Clusters with p
value less than 0.05 were considered significant.
Phylogenetic analysis of the nematode NHR genes
The predicted C. elegans NHR gene dataset (283 genes)
was used to identify orthologs and paralogs in C. briggsae
and C. remanei using the complete genome INPARANOID
datasets (see above). 204 and 152 potential homologs
were identified in C. briggsae and C. remanei, respectively.
The peptide dataset was aligned using Dialign 2.2 [71]
and then manually inspected. We identified two large
conserved blocks within most predicted peptides and
removed all sequences that did not align within these
blocks. The remaining sequences were then realigned with
Dialign 2.2 and truncated only to retain the two conserved
domains. As per Robinson-Rechavi et al. [29] we chose to
use only ungapped sites and removed first sequences
missing significant portions of the conserved domains
and finally excluded all gapped sites. In the end, we
retained 437 sequences (213 C. elegans, 106 C. briggsae
and 118 C. remanei) for phylogenetic analysis.

The phylogeny was constructed using a maximum likelihood based method as implemented in PhyML [72] using
the JTT substitution model [73] with the default proportion of invariable sites (0.0) and rate heterogeneity
between sites corrected by a gamma law (using the default
gamma parameter of 1.0 and eight rate categories). The
phylogeny was then bootstrapped by generating 1000
randomized datasets using SEQBOOT and assessing the
percentage of consensus trees using CONSENSE, both in
the PHYLIP package [74].
Calculation of TF divergence
DNA sequences from C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. remanei
were aligned according to their protein alignment using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/399

Dialign 2.2 [75] and RevTrans 1.4 [76]. Rates of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and nonsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN)
were estimated using codeml from PAML [77]. Evolutionary rates between TF and non-TF data sets were compared
using a permuted Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test using
10,000 permutations.
Curation of the mutant phenotypes of TFs
The RNAi phenotypes of all known C. elegans genes were
retrieved from Wormbase (WS170 release). A total of
13,648 phenotypes associated with 4,351 genes were analyzed and sorted into 82 different categories (Unc, Dpy,
Vul etc.) (Additional files 13 and 14).

For phenotypes associated with C. elegans TF orthologs in
fly, mouse, and human, we searched Flybase [78], NCBI
OMIM [79], PubMed [80], and other public databases
(http://www.informatics.jax.org, http://www.bio science.org/knockout/alphabet.htm, http://www.dsi.univparis5.fr/genatlas, http://www.genetests.org). Only those
phenotypes that were unambiguous and did not show discrepancy between different published sources were
included. In order to reduced any effect linked to a differential amount of genes annotated as involved in particular mutant phenotypes, all the analyses were performed
within each phenotypic class by comparing the distribution of genes with mutant phenotypes among the different sets (non-TF genes, TF genes, C. elegans TF genes, TF
genes conserved among the three nematode species, and
TF genes with orthologs in nematodes, fly, mouse, and
human).
Construction of TF interaction network
The C. elegans gene network was built using the genetic
and protein-protein interaction data for transcription factors curated by BioGRID (version 2.0.27 release) [37,38].
The network was visualized by using Cytoscape [81].

Phylogenetic tree of NHR genes in Caenorhabditid nematode species.
Colors mark NHR genes in different species (blue: C. elegans, red: C.
briggsae and light green: C. remanei). Tandemly along chromosomes
and phylogenetically clustered genes are indicated by vertical bars. Chromosomes carrying NHR clusters are indicated by roman numerals. The
sub-branch comprised of seven groups of NHR genes on chromosome V has
been marked by a star (*). Scale bar represents 0.5 substitutions per site.
