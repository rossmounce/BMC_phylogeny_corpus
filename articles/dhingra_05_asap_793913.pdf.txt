Abstract
Background: Availability of DNA sequence information is vital for pursuing structural, functional
and comparative genomics studies in plastids. Traditionally, the first step in mining the valuable
information within a chloroplast genome requires sequencing a chloroplast plasmid library or BAC
clones. These activities involve complicated preparatory procedures like chloroplast DNA isolation
or identification of the appropriate BAC clones to be sequenced. Rolling circle amplification (RCA)
is being used currently to amplify the chloroplast genome from purified chloroplast DNA and the
resulting products are sheared and cloned prior to sequencing. Herein we present a universal highthroughput, rapid PCR-based technique to amplify, sequence and assemble plastid genome
sequence from diverse species in a short time and at reasonable cost from total plant DNA, using
the large inverted repeat region from strawberry and peach as proof of concept. The method
exploits the highly conserved coding regions or intergenic regions of plastid genes. Using an
informatics approach, chloroplast DNA sequence information from 5 available eudicot plastomes
was aligned to identify the most conserved regions. Cognate primer pairs were then designed to
generate ~1 – 1.2 kb overlapping amplicons from the inverted repeat region in 14 diverse genera.
Results: 100% coverage of the inverted repeat region was obtained from Arabidopsis, tobacco,
orange, strawberry, peach, lettuce, tomato and Amaranthus. Over 80% coverage was obtained from
distant species, including Ginkgo, loblolly pine and Equisetum. Sequence from the inverted repeat
region of strawberry and peach plastome was obtained, annotated and analyzed. Additionally, a
polymorphic region identified from gel electrophoresis was sequenced from tomato and
Amaranthus. Sequence analysis revealed large deletions in these species relative to tobacco
plastome thus exhibiting the utility of this method for structural and comparative genomics studies.
Conclusion: This simple, inexpensive method now allows immediate access to plastid sequence,
increasing experimental throughput and serving generally as a universal platform for plastid genome
characterization. The method applies well to whole genome studies and speeds assessment of
variability across species, making it a useful tool in plastid structural genomics.

Background
Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) represents an extranuclear
capsule of genetic information, encoding essential structural and enzymatic proteins of the organelle. This satel-

lite genome contains a wealth of information that has
been shaped by speciation, rendering it a rich resource to
trace evolutionary relationships between photosynthetic
taxa [1]. Genetic manipulation of the chloroplast genome

can transform the chloroplast into a bioreactor, allowing
large-scale production of proteins vital to agriculture or
pharmacology [2,3]. Maternal inheritance of plastid
genome in most species ensures gene containment in
genetically modified plants making it an attractive alternative for the integration of foreign genes [4,5].
Genomic and phylogenetic studies and efficient genetic
modification begin with the base material of plastid DNA
sequence. Despite their relatively small size, few plastid
genomes have been fully sequenced, thus limiting comparative genomics studies across the species. Complete
sequence coverage has been resolved for only 13 species
representing model and crop plants, namely, Arabidopsis
thaliana [6], Atropa belladonna [7], Medicago truncatula
(GenBank: NC_003119), Oryza sativa [8], Spinacea oleracea [9], Nicotiana tabacum [10], Triticum aestivum [11],
Lotus corniculatus [12], Zea mays [13], Panax ginseng [14],
Cucumis sativus (GenBank: NC_007144), Glycine max [15]
and Saccharum officinarum [16]. Comparison of a small set
of representative coding or intergenic sequences derived
from a large number of species has been used to perform
phylogenetic studies [17], but there are many unresolved
phylogenetic questions [18]. Use of complete genome
data is another emerging approach in plant phylogenetics
[19]. There are at least three federally-sponsored, multiinstitution endeavors underway to sequence about 200
plastid genomes from plants [20-22].
There are a number of challenges to rapid access to chloroplast DNA sequence from a given species. Typical
sequencing efforts begin with construction of chloroplast
plasmid or other genomic libraries. Construction of such
resources requires isolation of pure plastid DNA, which
may be troublesome in some species. Even shotgun
sequencing to appreciable coverage is considerably expensive and time consuming. From the standpoint of method
and cost, the generation of plastid sequence data is considerable and a potential hindrance to productive data
mining and engineering efforts. One recent report
describes a sophisticated methodology using FACS (fluorescence-assisted cell sorting) and RCA (rolling circle
amplification) for sequencing a plastid genome [23]. The
degree of technological sophistication is inversely proportional to its wider applicability due to the prohibitive
costs associated with it, slowing chloroplast genomics
studies. These large-scale studies are expensive and prohibit testing of additional related species or ecotypes that
may be informative. Additionally, smaller research programs do not necessarily have access to these tools and
techniques. Most importantly some rare and/or difficultto-obtain taxa that are not amenable to large-scale chloroplast DNA extraction can not be analyzed by the existing
methodology. While downstream processing of sequence
information is highly streamlined due to the presence of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/176

freely available tools on the World Wide Web, such as
DOGMA [24,25], the lack of cost-effective innovation in
rapid sequence acquisition has restricted plastid informatics studies.
To address these issues, we exploited the fact that chloroplast genomes are extremely well conserved in size, gene
arrangement, and coding sequence, at least within major
subgroups of the plant kingdom [26,27]. We formulated
the hypothesis that conserved islands of cpDNA sequence
could serve as universal anchors to generate overlapping
PCR products comprised of conserved coding regions, and
adjacent polymorphic intergenic regions. The resulting
amplicons could then be sequenced, assembled, annotated and analyzed. This approach exploits the high
degree of sequence conservation and general synteny
within discrete portions of chloroplast genome. In this
report this powerful technique has been applied to the
large inverted repeat (IR) region of strawberry (Fragaria ×
ananassa) and peach (Prunus persica). The entire ~30 kb
region was amplified from total DNA, sequenced, annotated and submitted to public databases in several days for
a fraction of the cost of traditional or other recently published approaches [28]. To further validate this application, corresponding regions were amplified from a series
of other eudicots and a monocot of agricultural importance as well as two gymnosperms (Pinus and the distant
vascular plant Gingko) and a pteridophyte (Equisetum).
This universal method represents a rapid, inexpensive
means to obtain complete coverage of many higher plant
plastid genome regions, and even substantial coverage
from distant genera. The sequence information generated
form this method can hasten phylogenetic and genomics
studies and also help in identification of regulatory ele-

Results
In order to expand ongoing Rosaceae genomics studies
[29], the original goal of this work was to use existing
informatics resources to devise a PCR-based strategy to
obtain plastid DNA sequence for cultivated strawberry
and peach. This information would assist in identifying
indel (insertion/deletion) polymorphisms or SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that could serve as an
additional tool for phylogenetic analysis [30] and also
allow the design of vectors useful for strawberry plastid
engineering. A schematic explanation of the technique is
shown in Figure 1. If a given primer pair fails to generate
an amplicon in initial PCR trials, the forward primer can
then be paired with the reverse primer from the next
primer pair to obtain coverage of that region. Figure 2
demonstrates proof-of-concept, as universal primer set
derived from the IR of five sequenced eudicots is sufficient
to amplify the corresponding ~30 Kb region in commercial strawberry. The 27 primer pairs generate amplicons
spanning this region. The corresponding PCR products
were sequenced, and the sequence was immediately
deposited to public databases. Here we proceeded from
computational analyses to finished strawberry and peach
IR sequence in one week for <$500.
Since the method proved useful in strawberry and peach,
its applicability across plant species was assessed. Total
genomic DNA was derived from 13 diverse plant species
and subjected to the ASAP protocol using the primers

listed in Table 1 and the conditions stated in Table 2. The
ASAP primer set effectively generated expected amplicons
from all eudicot species tested. Expected results were
obtained in Nicotiana and Arabidopsis. Complete coverage
was obtained with the first round of PCR and the amplicon sizes were consistent with predictions (Table 1).
Comparison of agarose gel electrophoresis profiles from
the IR region revealed clearly discernible amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) in the regions
amplified with primer pairs 11, 17 and 27 (Figure 3). The
profiles for these two species are in complete agreement
with the calculated sizes.
The maize plastid genome lacks the ycf2 open reading
frame in the IR region, therefore primer pairs 3 to 9 failed
to produce any amplicons, as anticipated (Figure 4A).
Similarly, primer pairs 11, 26 and 27 did not produce any
amplicons. Using bl2Seq program the maize IR region
was compared with the associated primers and no significant sequence similarity was found between them. Interestingly, one primer each in primer pairs 1 and 10 had
very low sequence similarity and yet the amplicons were
obtained. Using three rounds of PCR (Table 2) 100% coverage was obtained even in the monocot plastome (Figure
4C), indicating the applicability of eudicot-based primer
designs to this taxonomic group. Absence of amplicons
from primer pair 26 and 27 could be due to the fact that
the primers annealed in the spacer region which could be
unique to the eudicots. The results of the reactions are presented in both Table 3 and Figure 3. Table 3 presents the
conditions required to produce the amplified regions
from individual species, whether the products were

shows the complete array of amplified products corresponding to the amplification conditions presented in
Table 2.
Fragaria and Prunus (Rosaceae)
Complete coverage of the plastid IR region from Fragaria
was obtained after proceeding through three rounds of
ASAP PCR (Table 2) with the 27 pairs of primers (Figure
2). These amplicons were generated using Pfu Turbo DNA
polymerase (Stratagene Inc., Carlsbad, CA) in order to
minimize potential errors generated during PCR reactions. These amplicons were directly sequenced in a 96well format. The sequence was assembled and annotated
as described in Methods.

Interestingly, in Prunus complete coverage was obtained
with Round 2 PCR. Sequence comparison with Fragaria
revealed that Prunus and Fragaria share considerable
sequence similarity in the IR region as expected being
from the same phylogenetic group. This is another demonstration of the utility of this technique where two members of the same taxonomic group were sequenced and
compared in a very short time frame and in a cost-effective
manner.
Other eudicots and identification of a variable region
The ASAP protocol was attempted in other eudicot species
for which plastid genome sequence has not been reported.
In Citrus and Lycopersicon complete coverage was obtained
after Round 1 PCR and for the remaining species almost
99 – 100% coverage was obtained using Round 2 PCR
conditions. Electrophoresis profiles revealed highly discernible AFLPs amongst different plant species. The most
consistently variable region was represented by primer
pair 11. In tobacco this amplicon represents sequences for
orf87/ycf15, orf92, orf115, trnL and orf79. Gel electrophoresis profiles of amplicons generated from this primer
pair revealed a great range of variability across all species
tested (Figure 5A). AFLPs were discernable by gel electrophoresis between two solanaceous species, Nicotiana and
Lycopersicon. Sequencing and alignment of this region
from two members of Solanaceae, tobacco and tomato
revealed a 95% – 98% sequence similarity in the aligning
sequences. Tomato had two deletions in the region coding
for orf92 and ycf15 in tobacco, which reconciles the
smaller amplicon size. On the other extreme is the representative member of Caryophyllaceae, Amaranthus, where
sequencing and subsequent alignments with tobacco
revealed absence of ORFs between ycf2 and orf92 – trnLCAA region (Figure 5B). Thus the ASAP method provides
the advantage of analyzing a large region from a number
of species and identifying a highly variable region at the
same time.

To test the limits of this methodology, the same 27 pairs
of primers were used against total DNA from Pisum sativum, Ginkgo biloba, Pinus taeda and Equisetum hyemale.
These species represent a unique member of Fabaceae
(Pisum – largest deletion resulting in removal of the rRNA
cluster; has only one IR), an ancient and contemporary
gymnosperm, and a pteridophyte. The primer pairs
designed for eudicot plastid genomes were able to amplify
the regions corresponding to primer pairs 14 to 25 in
Pisum. In tobacco these primer pairs amplify the 98494 –
110052 nt region of the IR that includes the rrn operon.
The bl2Seq program was used to determine the sequence
similarity between the 27 primer pairs and the Pisum chloroplast genome sequence (Kindly provided by John Gray,
John Innes Institute, UK). The observed amplicon patterns are consistent with what is anticipated from the
sequence data. Primer pairs that failed to generate an
amplicon do not share a significant sequence similarity
with the Pisum plastid genome sequence (Figure 6). In the
two gymnosperms, similar amplicon patterns were generated from the rrn operon region. Again in the pteridophyte only the primer pairs corresponding to the rrn
operon produced an amplicon. The Equisetum chloroplast
genome does possess ycf2 gene but comparative sequence
analysis with higher plant ycf2 revealed no significant
sequence similarity. Interestingly the amino acid
sequence similarity was almost 94% (data not shown).

Final

Discussion
Chloroplast sequencing efforts of model photosynthetic
organisms have provided a wealth of information detailing structural features and plant phylogeny, as well as a
basis for manipulation of the plastid genome in the interest of bioengineering. Current molecular phylogenetic
studies are carried out using large or complete plastid
genome sequences or small coding or intergenic
sequences and the Amplification, Sequencing, and Annotation of Plastomes (ASAP) method caters to both
approaches. Rapid generation of plastid sequence information is necessary as it can facilitate better design of plastid transformation vectors [15]. One of the factors in
successful engineering of cotton and carrot plastomes was
the use of species-specific flanking sequences in the transformation vectors [31,32].
The simple yet powerful ASAP technique described herein
expands the capacity for any laboratory to dissect the chloroplast genome at the informatics level with a basic set of
available resources. The obvious limitation of ASAP
method is that some plastid genomes have undergone
extensive rearrangements [33]. Therefore, this method
complements other strategies [28] for obtaining plastid
genome sequences and provides a convenient platform
for plastomes that share a considerable level of synteny. A
long range PCR based approach was used earlier to
sequence the Amborella trichopoda plastid genome [34],

requiring nebulization of large amplicons and cloning
prior to sequencing. In contrast, the ASAP method performs the dual task of generating small amplicons for
direct sequencing and the electrophoresis profiles provide
structural genomics information. Direct sequencing of the
PCR products limits incorrect base calls resulting from
amplification or sequencing errors, as large pools of products are sequenced and even early PCR errors will not be
scored incorrectly. In a worst-case scenario a base call at a
given position will be unclear, requiring re-amplification
and re-sequencing of the amplicon. This approach allows
the implementation of non-proofreading, highly processive polymerases that limit costs yet generate substantial
quantities of template for downstream analyses.
ASAP also allows description and characterization of the
frequent islands of high sequence identity present within
the coding regions of sequenced genomes. Using local
identities found within the cpDNA sequences of five
sequenced eudicot plant species, primer pairs were
designed to produce overlapping amplicons that bracket
sequences of plastid genes and the rich sequence variability resident to their adjacent intergenic regions. The ASAP
method was herein shown to generate representative
regions of 10 diverse plant species to almost 100% coverage. Even the rrn region was also amplified from four
divergent genomes studied, such as Pisum, Equisetum,
Pinus and Ginkgo, with expected efficiency. The success of
the method suggests it an excellent first step in the analysis
of any novel plastid genome. The ASAP method may be
the only practical approach for some rare and/or difficultto-obtain taxa that are not amenable to chloroplast DNA
extraction.
One caveat of this technique is that plastid sequences are
not confined to the chloroplast. Plastid DNA sequences
are represented in both mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes, and may serve as templates for the amplicons
generated with the 27 primer pairs. The high copy number
of plastomes in green leaf derived total DNA and long
primers (26 bp each) used in this approach should preferentially amplify chloroplast sequences. Additionally,
nuclear integrated plastid sequences are continuously
shuffled and eliminated [35], making them less likely to
be incorrectly amplified via this approach. However, with
the design of specific primers this technique could be
extended to plastid genomes of distant phylogenetic
groups or mitochondrial genomes in species where high
level of synteny is present.

Conclusion
The ASAP method represents a rapid means to generate a
large amount of plastid genome information from simple
PCR steps to facilitate bioinformatic dissection and functional genomic studies. The products generated spotlight

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/176

AFLPs that serve as low-resolution beacons to report
regions of high diversity, such as the hypervariable Region
11 (Figure 5). These regions may be particularly meaningful for phylogenetic analyses. In this capacity the ASAP
methods may facilitate studies of hypervariable specific
regions of the plastid genome, helping to quickly identify
areas of likely importance, bypassing the necessity to
sequence an entire genome as a first step. The ASAP
method eliminates cloning steps, thus negating the need
to identify and trim plasmid sequences before assembly.
Another powerful facet of the technique is the potential to
generate plastid fragment fingerprint for any species.
AFLPs produced may be immediately comparable to those
produced by other genomes, revealing deviations in otherwise conserved sequence, thus informing of structuralgenomic variation. Even the absence of products in
related species may be extremely informative.
To summarize, the ASAP method has the following
advantages: The method is ideal for laboratories or programs with limited resources interested in obtaining chloroplast DNA sequence information for their particular
research interest. ASAP method may be the only practical
approach to obtain chloroplast DNA sequence from rare
or small plant samples. This method provides a fingerprint of a given chloroplast region, which can be readily
compared amongst different genera and give information
of structural variability even without the sequence information. Another practical application of this approach is
the use of PCR amplicons generated by ASAP method for
construction of chloroplast genome microarrays from a
given plant species.
Specific to this report, the method was used to amplify
and sequence the large IR region from octoploid strawberry and peach. This ~30 kbp region from strawberry was
amplified in 33 PCR reactions and then sequenced. The
PCR fragments were generated in three thermalcycler runs
over two days, and the entire process, from leaf to data on
the server, was performed in under a week for under $500.
With this minimal time and capital investment roughly
25% of the chloroplast genome has been deciphered;
bidirectionally and with complete coverage. The entire
process is now being scaled up to sequence an entire plastid genome within the context of a 96-well plate. In this
system 1.2 to 1.5 kb amplicons may be produced and
sequenced from this standard format. The common format also lends itself to robotic manipulation, and it is
exciting to speculate that a single set of 96 primer pairs
may be matched to a high-throughput robotic amplification and sequencing system to generate plastid DNA
sequence at the rate of a plastid genome per day. It is our
hope that this methodology will hasten study of chloroplast sequences, especially those from unusual organisms
or those not considered worthy of large investment.

Methods
Primer design
The cpDNA sequences of five eudicot plant species
namely Nicotiana tabacum (NC_001879), Arabidopsis thaliana (NC_000932), Atropa belladonna (NC_004561),
Spinacea oleracea (NC_002202) and Panax ginseng
(NC_006290) were aligned using ClustalW [36]. Tobacco
chloroplast genome sequence was used as a reference and
its coding regions were delineated in the aligned
sequences. Highly conserved, putative primer sites were
derived by hand parsing the aligned sequences of the IR B
region. Primer candidates satisfied several criteria. A candidate primer must be resident to the coding region or
conserved intergenic region and primer pairs must be
spaced by ~1.0 to 1.2 kb. The primers must share 95%
sequence identity among the representative plastid
genomes. For universal, large-format application in
simultaneous PCR reactions the primers should maintain
approximately 50% GC content and a Tm of approximately 50°C. Table 1 lists the primer sequences, annealing sites, respective position in tobacco, Arabidopsis and
maize plastid genomes and the expected amplicon sizes.

This set of primers, used to amplify the large IR region in
this manuscript, will be supplied by the authors upon
request.
DNA preparation and primary optimization
Total plant DNA was isolated from fresh leaf tissue using
the Qiagen DNeasy Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA)
according to manufacturer's instructions, except that the
homogenized plant material was mixed in Buffer AP1 for
10 min on a platform vortexer for 10 min and the sample
was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm to remove any
debris at this stage. The supernatant was then incubated at
65°C for 10 min and from this point on the manufacturer's protocol was followed. DNA was isolated from two
plant species namely Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0)
and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). These two species served
as a positive control and a basis for detection of computationally predicted AFLPs. Upon validation of the technique with known genomes, amplification was performed
on several crops of agricultural importance namely, strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa; cv. Strawberry Festival), Sweet
orange (Citrus sinensis), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), peach

(Prunus persica; cv. UF Sun), Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), coleus (Coleus × hybrida), Amaranthus (Amaranthus
hypochondricus). Maize (Zea mays; W22) was tested as a
model monocot. Since it has been sequenced, amplification discrepancies related to insertion/deletion and/or
rearrangement can be anticipated and circumvented. The
technique was also performed on diverse plant species to
test the range of the approach. These species included
Pisum sativum L. (Little Marvel), which does not have an
IR region and has only one copy of the rRNA genes, an
ancient gymnosperm (Ginkgo biloba), a contemporary
gymnosperm loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), along with
horsetail, (Equisetum hyemale), a pteridophyte which represents an ancient plastid genome that would test and

define the limit of the application of the eudicot speciesbased primer designs reported here.
Before performing reactions with the 27 primer pairs that
define the large IR, it was important to establish the
amount of total DNA to use in each reaction. Variability
in amplification may be introduced from several sources,
namely the relative amount of chloroplast DNA to total
DNA ratio and the tendency for inhibitory compounds to
co-purify with DNA templates in total DNA isolation [37].
For instance, the relative cpDNA: total DNA ratio will be
significantly different between Arabidopsis (haploid
genome size ~140 Mbp) and Pinus (haploid genome size
~21658 Mbp), two organisms with massively different

nuclear genome sizes. DNA preparation from some species, such as strawberry, may introduce phenolics or
polysaccharides that could inhibit efficient amplification
during PCR.
To accommodate both of these variables an initial reaction set is performed using the most conserved primers,
those representing the 16 S rrn locus (primer set 19; Table
1). These primers predictably generate a fragment in all
species tested, yet the yield varies considerably based on
the amount of template used in the reaction. For instance,
while coleus was best amplified with 1 ng per reaction,
Equisetum required 10 ng per reaction (data not shown).
The fidelity of the reaction is extremely dependent upon
total isolated DNA concentration and the inherent
cpDNA: nuclear DNA ratio in total DNA. A pilot experiment testing for the production of PCR product over 4–5
orders of magnitude must be performed to optimize conditions for subsequent reactions.
PCR conditions for plastome amplification
Touchdown PCR was utilized to generate PCR amplicons
[38]. The first set of reactions was performed using Round
I conditions, conditions conducive to amplification in the
species for which the primers were designed (Figure 1;
Table 2). This reaction would routinely produce amplicons in 24 out of 27 reactions. Reactions that failed to produce a product were reconstituted from fresh reagents and

template, and PCR is performed using Reaction II conditions (Table 2). Typically this amplification was sufficient
to obtain complete coverage of the large IR in 7 of the 10
species studied (Table 3). Amplicons generated from this
approach will be made feely available upon request.
If Round II conditions failed to produce a PCR product it
could be assumed that sequence differences in the primer
landing site are present or those sites are deleted or rearranged. In this case PCR is performed using each fragment-specific primer and primers from adjacent
fragments that successfully amplified in Round I and/or
Round II. The process is outlined in Figure 1.
Sequencing was performed directly from PCR products in
a 96-well format at the University of Florida ICBR Core
Facility using ET Terminator (Amersham Inc, Schaumburg, IL) as reported earlier [29]. A 5 µl aliquot of PCR
product from a 50 µl reaction was analyzed by gel electrophoresis to verify purity and concentration. PCR products
were treated with ExoSAP to remove primers and nucleotides. Each amplicon was sequenced bidirectionally
using the primers used in initial amplification. Sequencing primers were added at 10 pmol/µl in a 10 µl final reaction volume. Sequences with Phred score of >20 were
used for assembly. Both strands were sequenced for each
fragment thus providing a 2X coverage and, 4X coverage
in the overlapping regions.

Assembly, annotation and dissemination of the sequences
from Fragaria and Prunus
Sequences generated from a primer pair were first aligned
using Blast 2 sequences (bl2seq) available at NCBI website [39,40]. Individual amplicons derived from this process were further assembled using CAP3 [41,42]. The
sequence was then annotated using DOGMA [24,25].
Chloroplast genome sequences from the IR B region of
Fragaria and Prunus were submitted to the GenBank under
accession numbers FACPINVREP (Fa) and PPCPINVREP
(Pp).
