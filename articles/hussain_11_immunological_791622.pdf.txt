Abstract
Background: Hepatitis A virus is an infection of liver; it is hyperendemic in vast areas of the world including India.
In most cases it causes an acute self limited illness but rarely fulminant. There is growing concern about change in
pattern from asymptomatic childhood infection to an increased incidence of symptomatic disease in the adult
population.
Objective: In-depth analysis of immunological, viral quantification and genotype of acute and fulminant hepatitis
A virus.
Methods: Serum samples obtained from 1009 cases of suspected acute viral hepatitis was employed for different
biochemical and serological examination. RNA was extracted from blood serum, reverse transcribed into cDNA and
amplified using nested PCR for viral quantification, sequencing and genotyping. Immunological cell count from
freshly collected whole blood was carried out by fluorescence activated cell sorter.
Results: Fulminant hepatitis A was mostly detected with other hepatic viruses. CD8+ T cells count increases in
fulminant hepatitis to a significantly high level (P = 0.005) compared to normal healthy control. The immunological
helper/suppressor (CD4+/CD8+) ratio of fulminant hepatitis was significantly lower compared to acute cases. The
serologically positive patients were confirmed by RT-PCR and total of 72 (69.2%) were quantified and sequenced.
The average quantitative viral load of fulminant cases was significantly higher (P < 0.05). There was similar
genotypic distribution in both acute and fulminant category, with predominance of genotype IIIA (70%) compared
to IA (30%).
Conclusions: Immunological factors in combination with viral load defines the severity of the fulminant hepatitis
A. Phylogenetic analysis of acute and fulminant hepatitis A confirmed genotypes IIIA as predominant against IA
with no preference of disease severity.
Keywords: acute hepatitis A fulminant hepatitis A, genotype, viral load, RT-PCR

1. Background
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is one of the common causative agents for acute hepatitis worldwide, particularly in
developing countries where 20-25% of clinical hepatitis
is caused by HAV infection [1,2]. Hepatitis A is an
acute infection with generalized symptoms accompanied
by jaundice and it represents mainly a disease of the
pediatric population [3,4]. In children, the infection with

HAV is generally asymptomatic while exposure of nonimmune adolescents and adults may results in severe
clinical disease like fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)
[2,5-7]. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hepatocellular injury in acute hepatitis are poorly understood
[8]. There is general agreement that HAV infection does
not evolve to chronic hepatitis in man and immune
mechanisms have been suspected of playing a major
role in eliminating virus infected liver cells [9,10].
HAV presents a spherical virion with 27 nm, with
7.5 kb linear, positive-sense RNA within the Picornaviridae
family that demonstrates little antigenic variability [11,12].

HAV has been shown to possess a single conserved
immunogenic neutralization site and isolates from different parts of the world belong to a single serotype [12,13].
It is composed of a 5’ non-coding region (NCR), structural protein regions, non-structural protein regions and
a 3’ NCR [14,15]. HAV genome is of positive polarity, i.e.,
viral RNA can directly serve as messenger RNA [16]. The
large open reading frame present in HAV genome can be
divided into three (P1-P3) functional regions. The P1
region encodes capsid polypeptides VP1-VP3 and the
putative VP4. The P2 and P3 regions encode nonstructural proteins which are necessary for virus replication (Figure 1) [17]. The nucleotide sequence comparison
based on the VP1/2A region of the genome has been
used to define seven different genotypes [15]. The seven
genotypes are differentiated into four human clusters
(I-III and VII) and three simian strains (IV-VI) [15]. The
seven genotypes recovered from human and non-human
primates differ from each other at approximately 15 to
25% of base position in the VP1/2A region [15]. The
VP1/2A region is best suited for genotyping due to its
relative variability compared with the VP3 and 5’ nontranslated regions [15]. The nucleotide diversity within
sub-genotypes of HAV (IA, IB, IIIA and IIIB) is less than
7.5% [15]. Most of the human strains cluster in genotype
I, which has been further divided in sub-genotypes IA
and IB. Sub-genotype IIIA had been reported to be the
major HAV genotype in India [18-20]. However, recent
report contradicts earlier findings that revealed sub-genotype IB in western India from samples of sewage treatment plant [19].
HAV is hyperendemic in India and most of the population is infected asymptomatically in early childhood
with lifelong immunity [21]. However, recently due to
altered epidemiology and decreasing endemicity the pattern of acute HAV infection is changing from asymptomatic childhood infection to an increased incidence of
symptomatic disease in the adult population [21-23].
Although HAV is undergoing epidemiological changes
in India, there are very few in-depth characterizations of

all the causative factors related to HAV infection.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to undertake an indepth analysis of immunological, viral quantification and
genotype of acute and fulminant hepatitis A virus.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Patients and blood samples

All those patients attending the medical out patients
department (OPD) of Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi,
with the characteristic symptoms of jaundice, fever, general malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and
right upper quadrant discomfort were enrolled in this
study. This has been approved by the ethical committee
of Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, as directed by the Declaration of Helsinki in 1995. Ten milliliters of blood sample was taken by venipuncture after
informed consent of the patients, while children and
adolescents consent was obtained from their parents
and guardians.
2.2 Diagnosis of acute and fulminant hepatitis A

The clinical onset of an acute viral hepatitis (AVH) A is
defined as the beginning of early symptoms including
fever, general malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and right upper quadrant discomfort. It is mainly
characterized by the onset of jaundice and positive serological test for IgM anti-HAV. Fulminant hepatitis A is
defined as clinical syndrome develops as a result of
severe impairment of hepatic functions or massive
necrosis of hepatocytes in the absence of preexisting
liver disease. Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) patients
were diagnosed by the presence of encephalopathy
within 4 weeks of onset of illness with a prothrombin
time (PT) of less than 40% that of the standardized
value [16,24].
2.3 Epidemiological survey

Each person enrolled in this study gave personal information including general data, such as gender, age,
onset of illness, past history of hepatitis, alcoholism, and

Figure 1 Genomic structure of hepatitis A virus. HAV genome is divided into a 5’ non-coding region (5’NCR), a giant open reading frame,
and a non-coding region (3’NCR). The coding region is subdivided into regions P1, P2 and P3. Adapted from: Totsuka and Moritsugu;

presence of major systemic disease. Those AVH patients
who had positivity for any of IgM anti-HEV, hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg), IgM antibody to hepatitis B
core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and hepatitis C virus antibodies were excluded. Since fulminant hepatitis A is
rare occurrence, we have reported all the FHF cases
including cases with other hepatic viruses (60% in this
study). Patients with a history of recent exposure to
drugs and those who had a heavy alcohol intake were
also excluded from the study. The travel history within
3 months before the onset of illness was carefully
checked and recorded, as incubation period for HAV is
2-8 weeks.
2.4 Serological tests

A total of 1009 AVH and FHF patients were screened for
IgM anti-HAV. In laboratory examination, serum albumin/globulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total
protein and total and direct bilirubin levels were measured.
IgM anti-HAV was detected by enzyme immunoassay
ELISA (HAVAB-MEIA, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To
determine other acute viral hepatitis, sera were also tested
for IgM anti-HEV (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), hepatitis B
surface antigen (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), IgM anti-HBc
(Abbot Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), anti-HCV
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using Kits.
2.5 FACS analysis of T-lymphocyte profile

One milliliter of whole blood was collected from
patients into a vial containing EDTA and was employed
for CD4 + (T helper) and CD8 + (T suppressor) cell
counts within 24 hours of collection using fluorescence
activated cell sorter (FACS) (Becton Dickenson Electronics Laboratory, Mountain View, California). This system quantifies CD4+, CD8+ and CD3+ T lymphocytes as
absolute numbers of lymphocytes per μl (mm 3 ) of
blood, and the CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio. Samples
from healthy controls were also run for cell counts
using the manufacturer’s protocol and reagents.
2.6 HAV RNA detection

RNA was extracted from each test sample, using the
QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany)
and reverse transcribed into cDNA using published primer [25]. The cDNA was then amplified in a nested
PCR targeting VP1/2A region as shown in figure 1[26].
Nested PCR was carried out using primers BR-5b (5’TTG TCTGTC ACA GAA CAA TCAG-3’) as the outer,
sense primer, BR-9b as the outer, anti-sense primer, RJ3c (5’-TCC CAG AGC TCC ATT GAA-3’) as the inner,
sense primer, and Br-6b (5’-AGG AGG TGG AAG CAC
TTC ATT TGA-3’) as the inner, anti-sense primer [25].

Both amplification reactions were performed in a 9600
thermo-cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) set to
run for 2 min at 95°C (denaturation), 1 min at 55°C (primer annealing) and 1 min at 72°C (extension) for
35 cycles, with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.
After electrophoresis in 2% agarose (Research Organics,
Cleveland, OH) and staining with ethidium bromide, a
ultra-violet transilluminator (Gel Doc 1000, Bio-Hercules,
CA) was used to check for the expected, 234 bp band.
2.7 Direct sequencing

The target PCR products within the agarose gel were
purified for sequencing using the perfect prep Gel
Cleanup Kit (Eppendorf, Westbuty, NY), according to
the manufacturer’s specifications, and subjected to 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis in order to ascertain their
purity. Between 10 and 30 ng/μl (3-6 μl) of each DNA
sample was subjected to cycle sequencing using 8 μl of
dye terminator from a DNA sequencing kit (Big Dye
Terminator V.3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction,
Foster City, CA) and 3.2 pmole of specific primer (in a
final reaction volume of 20 μl) in a thermocycler (9600
Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT). This round of amplification was performed according to the manufacturer’s
specifications, using primer BR-5b to amplify the particular DNA strand of interest for further sequencing.
The extension products were subsequently purified from
excess unincorporated dye terminators by ethanol precipitation, according to the manufacturer’s specifications
(ABI Sequencing kit, ABI, Foster City, CA), and subjected to sequence analysis by the ABI Prism 310
Genetic Analyzer (ABI, Foster City, CA).
2.8 Primers, probe and standard for real-time
amplification

Viral RNA was amplified using primers derived from the
most constant region, the 5’ non-coding region (5’NCR)
as shown in figure 1. The primers used were, forward
primer HAV-1 (5’-TTTCCGGAGCCCCTCTTG-3’), as
wild type (M14707) reverse primers HAV-2 (5’-AAA
GGGAAATTTAGCCTATAG CC-3’) and HAV-3 (5’AAAGGGAAAATTTAGCCTATA GCC-3’), and HAVProbe (5’-FAM-ACTTGATACCTCACCGCCGTTTG
CCT-TAMRA-3’) and RNA standard representing the
5’NCR region was constructed according to CostaMattioli et al. [27]. RT-PCR was carried out with a
HAV quantification kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
total volume of the reaction mixture was 25 μl (15 μl of
master mix with 10 μl of the RNA template) in 0.2 ml
tubes. The capillaries were sealed, centrifuged, and
transferred to the Rotor Gene 3000 real-time PCR
machine (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). Reversetranscription was done for 15 min at 50°C followed by

Hussain et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:254
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/254

5 min denaturation at 95°C. The corresponding cDNA’s
were amplified by PCR (20s at 95°C, 30 s at 50°C acquiring FAM, and 20 s at 72°C) over 45 cycles, and an 87 bp
fragment was obtained. The CT values from the clinical
samples were plotted on the standard curve, and the
number of copies was calculated automatically.

recovered finally. Four patients died of hepatic encephalopathy, three due to grade IV hepatic encephalopathy.
These patients were in coma and cannot be aroused.
While patient of hepatic encephalopathy grade III developed drowsy and confused state and died due to complications. The duration of hepatic encephalopathy
among survivors and non-survivors were similar (P >
0.03). Encephalopathy developed within 1-4 weeks of
onset of symptoms, and mean duration between onset
of symptoms and encephalopathy was 6.3 ± 0.3 days.

2.10 Statistical analysis

3.1c Biochemical profile of acute and fulminant hepatitis A

Chi-squared analysis, Fisher’s exact test, Student’s t-test,
Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxin two-sample test,
ANOVA and stepwise backward Cox regression procedure were used in this study. A P value of <0.05 was
considered significant.

Mean haemoglobin (g/dl) was significantly lesser in
acute and fulminant hepatitis A compared to healthy
control, while difference between acute and fulminant
hepatitis A cases was statistically significant (P < 0.035).
Similarly, prothrombin time was higher among fulminant cases compared to acute viral hepatitis A (P <
0.04) as shown in additional file 3. The liver function
profiles of acute and fulminant hepatitis A at different
days of follow up as shown in additional file 4. Liver
function profiles (ALT, AST and ALP) of fulminant
hepatitis A at different days of follow up were significantly higher compared to acute viral hepatitis A. In
acute cases the above values decreased from initial to
final days but not FHF. Total bilirubin was similar (P =
0.55) at initial day, but at 1st week of the onset of jaundice total bilirubin was quite higher (P = 0.002) in the
fulminant category compared to the acute cases. The
rest of the liver function parameters (TB, DB/IB, ALP,
TP, and Alb) were not statistically significant.

3. Results
Total of 1009 acute and fulminant viral hepatitis cases
were screened during the period of 5 years, 556 were
males and 453 females with sex ratio 1.2:1. The mean
age and standard deviation of the patients were 28.2 ±
21.8 years.
3.1a Serological screening of acute and fulminant
hepatitis A

Out of one thousand and nine hundred acute cases, 104
(10.3%) were positive for IgM anti-HAV by commercially available ELISA kit. Out of 104 HAV-IgM positive
cases, 10 (0.96%) developed into fulminant hepatitis A.
Other viral etiologies were detected in 60% of HAV fulminant cases as shown in Table 1.
3.1b Sensorium/hepatic encephalopathy of fulminant
hepatitis A

Fifty percent of the fulminant hepatitis A patients fall
under clinical grade I hepatic encephalopathy. These
patients were restless and had almost uncomplicated
course and recovered completely. One patient in grade
II hepatic encephalopathy was restless and confused but

3.4 Epidemiological profile of acute and fulminant
hepatitis A

The epidemiological characterization of acute and fulminant hepatitis was similar with no significance. Twenty
one patients (33.8%) in the acute category had history of
being exposed to unhealthy surroundings with poor
sanitation facilities compared to 3 (30%) in fulminant
hepatitis A as shown in Table 2. Travel to high endemic
area was also found to be a major cause that leads to

spread of hepatitis A virus. Eight (13%) acute cases and
one (10%) fulminant hepatitis A patient had travel history (P = 0.98).
3.5 Immunological profiles of acute and fulminant
hepatitis A

The lymphocyte sub-population (i.e. CD4+ (helper)/CD8+
(suppressor) ratio of acute and fulminant hepatitis A was
compared with normal healthy control. CD8 + T cells
count increases in fulminant and acute hepatitis cases
compared to normal healthy control, but this increase was
significant only in the first case (P = 0.005 and 0.074). In
acute and fulminant hepatitis cases, CD4+ T cells concentration (cells/microliters) maintained a low level compared
to normal healthy control as shown in Figure 2. In fulminant hepatitis cases helper/suppressor T-lymphocyte ratio
decreased to a significant quantity compared to the ratio
observed among normal control as shown in Figure 3.
CD8+ (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) concentration (cells/
microliters) increases to target the infected (hepatocytes),

while CD4+ T lymphocytes decline, resulting in the helper
suppressor ratio and hence immunity.
3.6 Molecular analysis of serologically positive samples

All IgM anti-HAV positive samples (104) were analyzed
for HAV RNA presence to correlate the time of presentation of the disease with HAV-RNA positivity. Fifty eight
(56%) of AVH cases turned positive for RT-PCR,
reported to OPD at 0-7 days of onset of jaundice. This
includes fulminant hepatic failure following the acute illness. The positivity by RT-PCR in acute and fulminant
was 75% and 100% respectively as shown in Table 3.
HAV RNA detection was higher in fulminant hepatitis
cases compared to that observed among acute cases.
Thirty two patients positive for hepatitis A by ELISA
turned to OPD in 2 nd week of the onset of jaundice.

There was significant difference (P > 0.05) between final

determine the genotype(s).
3.6a Phylogenetic analysis and genotype distribution of
hepatitis A virus

Accommodating large number of sequenced samples
(reference and studied sequences) in one phylogenetic tree
lacks clarity, therefore for most accurate presentation 2
phylogenetic trees have been constructed as shown in
Figure 4 and 5. The genotype of Indian HAV isolates was

Page 6 of 10

derived by neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of hepatitis
A virus sequences based on the VP1/2A region. According
to phylogenetic analysis, acute cases were divided into
genotype IA and IIIA. There was predominance of genotype IIIA with 74% of the total cases sequenced. In fulminant hepatitis A cases, genotype IIIA again was also
prevalent (70%) as shown in Table 4. Between the groups
the genotype was similarly distributed but within the two
groups the prevalence was quite significant.
3.7 Viral load determination among acute and fulminant
hepatitis A

All the patients (acute and fulminant hepatitis A) were
quantified for viral load by real-time polymerase chain

of the fulminant patients was significantly quite higher
compared to the acute viral hepatitis A patients.

4. Discussion
Human hepatitis A, a widespread infectious disease that
is hyperendemic in vast areas of the world, results from
the infection of the liver [3,28]. Humans are thought to
be its principal host and represent a disease of pediatric
population [28]. Importantly, one third of the patients in
present study belong to age group 11-30 years which is
quite different from the earlier findings that pediatric
populations are more prominent [21]. HAV distribution
pattern was in corroboration with earlier findings which
showed male predominance and susceptibility to
HAV infection compared to female population [3,28].

hepatitis A by real time PCR. Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to

Quantitative viral load; AVH vs FHF: P = 0.0000; highly significant.

The present study showed that one third of hepatitis A
patients had insufficient sanitation or poor hygienic conditions with overcrowded population. As reported earlier, low standards of sanitation promote transmission of
the virus, therefore, to avoid any outbreak of this infection in new entrants there is urgent need for proper
sanitation [29,30]. Traveler’s account for 10-13% of the
acute and fulminant hepatitis A in this study, similar to
the earlier reports which estimate an annual infection
rate of 3.5-7.2 per 100 individuals [18,31].
40% of death (non-survivors) and complications were
related among hepatitis A cases presenting histology of
III and IV, what was also demonstrated in other studies
[6,7]. Most of the non-survivors were infected with
other viral etiologies. The survivors of fulminant hepatitis A belong to Grade I and II with no infection with
other viral hepatitis. Prothrombin time (PT) of fulminant hepatitis A cases were significantly prolonged compared to normal controls (P = 0.035). The reason why
fulminant hepatitis A occurs in some patients and not
in other remains unclear. HAV infection rarely has a
fulminant course and is seldom fatal, with an estimated
fatality rate of 0.14 to 2.0 percent [8], which corroborates the findings of the present study. Diagnosis of
hepatitis A were usually made by LFTs and followed at
different interval of time [31,32]. ALT, AST and ALP
levels of fulminant viral hepatitis cases at different days
of follow up was significantly higher compared to acute
hepatitis A. This was similar to earlier findings that aminotransferase levels are sensitive markers of liver
damage, and usually reach peak levels about the time
the patients seek medical attention, although the degree
of elevation does not appear to correlate the outcome
[32-34].
The clearance of viral infection and the disease manifestations are associated with cellular immune response [34].

The relative percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes decline
and CD8+ T lymphocytes increases in the fulminant HAV
cases results in decline of the helper/suppressor ratio. This
decrease of CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio was highly
significant compared to acute cases (P = 0.038). This
shows that low CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are associated
with a variety of conditions in viral infections [35]. These
findings were in corroboration with study carried out on
patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive
cancer revealed a decrease in CD4 cells with a relative
increase in CD8 cell count, leading to a considerable
reduction in the CD4/CD8 cell ratio [36]. Therefore the
present study speculate that fulminant HAV infection may
be triggered by diminished cellular immunity in susceptible patients and increase liver damage and hence fatality
and severity.
The detection rate and mean duration of HAV viremia
was 69.3% and 15 days (range 1-2 months) respectively
[1]. This proves earlier findings that HAV RNA could
be detected on an average 18 days following the onset
of clinical symptoms [32,34]. The average viral load of
fulminant hepatitis was significantly higher compared to
the acute hepatitis A cases in the present study.
Although HAV is not directly cytopathic, viral factor
might be one reason involved in determining the severity of the disease [37]. Seven HAV genotypes have been
defined based on the sequence of the VP1/2A junction
region of a global collection of viruses [15]. HAV isolates reported from India were found to be of genotype
IIIA [15]. However recent study from western India
demonstrated presence of genotype IB [19]. Vaidya et
al., study had limitation due to the collection of HAV
isolates from sewage treatment plant and not directly
from the patients [19]. The current study detected HAV
RNA by using RT-PCR in the sera of patients instead of
feces. The acute hepatitis A genotype (s) distribution
was found to be IA (26%) and IIIA (74%). Similarly, fulminant hepatic genotype distribution was IA (30%) and
IIIA (70%) with no significant difference between these
groups (P = 0.52). Thus, it appears that the prevalence
of HAV genotypes in Northern India is was different
from western India, indicating there could be geographical variations in the prevalence of HAV genotypes
[15,18,19].

5. Conclusions
In summary, results suggest that hepatitis A is a major
public health problem in India. Further, most hepatitis
A cases reported was from poor hygienic surroundings,
which emphasizes the need for improving the public
health measures to prevent epidemics of hepatitis A.
There was relative percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes
decline and CD8+ T lymphocytes increase in the fulminant HAV. This results in decline in helper/suppressor

ratio that might lead to development of a weak antiviral
immune response or diminished cellular immunity to
the viral antigens. Significant increase of viral copies
in fulminant patients defines its role in determining
the severity of the disease. Phylogenetic analysis of
acute and fulminant hepatitis A confirmed genotypes
IIIA as predominant against IA with no preference of
disease severity. Finally, both viral and host factors
should be considered and examined when discussing
the mechanisms responsible for the severity of type
A hepatitis.
