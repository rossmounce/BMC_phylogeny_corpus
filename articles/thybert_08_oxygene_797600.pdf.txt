Abstract
Background: Oxidative stress is a common stress encountered by living organisms and is due to
an imbalance between intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and cellular
antioxidant defence. To defend themselves against ROS/RNS, bacteria possess a subsystem of
detoxification enzymes, which are classified with regard to their substrates. To identify such
enzymes in prokaryotic genomes, different approaches based on similarity, enzyme profiles or
patterns exist. Unfortunately, several problems persist in the annotation, classification and naming
of these enzymes due mainly to some erroneous entries in databases, mistake propagation, absence
of updating and disparity in function description.
Description: In order to improve the current annotation of oxidative stress subsystems, an
innovative platform named OxyGene has been developed. It integrates an original database called
OxyDB, holding thoroughly tested anchor-based signatures associated to subfamilies of oxidative
stress enzymes, and a new anchor-driven annotator, for ab initio detection of ROS/RNS response
genes. All complete Bacterial and Archaeal genomes have been re-annotated, and the results stored
in the OxyGene repository can be interrogated via a Graphical User Interface.
Conclusion: OxyGene enables the exploration and comparative analysis of enzymes belonging to
37 detoxification subclasses in 664 microbial genomes. It proposes a new classification that
improves both the ontology and the annotation of the detoxification subsystems in prokaryotic
whole genomes, while discovering new ORFs and attributing precise function to hypothetical
annotated proteins. OxyGene is freely available at: http://www.umr6026.univ-rennes1.fr/english/

Background
Oxidative stress is a key stress in bacteria, caused by an
imbalance between intracellular oxidant concentration,
cellular antioxidant defence and oxidative alteration of

macromolecules (membrane lipids, proteins and DNA
repair enzymes) [1]. The reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and nitrogen species (RNS) are the principal causes of oxidative stress [2]. They are mainly constituted of the

hydroxyl radical (•OH), the superoxide anion (O2-),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), organic hydroperoxide
(ROOH), peroxynitrite (OONO) and nitric oxide (NO).
ROS and RNS cause damages to proteins [3-5], DNA molecules [6,7], RNA and lipids leading to dysfunctions of the
cellular metabolism [8]. This toxicity of ROS/RNS reveals
the importance of efficient protection subsystems, such as
the detoxification subsystem that gathers enzymes classified with regard to their substrates. Catalases are universal
enzymes found in nearly all-living organisms that degrade
hydrogen peroxide to produce oxygen and water [9-11].
Peroxidases reduce hydrogen or organic peroxides into
water and alcohol moiety. This class of enzymes encompasses a large number of phylogenetically unrelated families such as peroxiredoxins [12,13], rubrerythrins
[14,15], glutathione-peroxidases [16] or haloperoxidases
[17,18]. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) dismute superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen [19-21]. An additional mechanism recently described involves non-heme
iron proteins called superoxide reductases (SOR) [22].
The latter catalyzes the one-electron reduction of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. Finally, RNS-scavenging
enzymes are essentially globins [23,24] and nitric oxide
reductases [25,26].
The increasing number of sequenced prokaryotic
genomes makes it possible to perform comparative
genomic analyses, in order to gain insight in the evolutionary or functional processes of the detoxification subsystem. The fundamental step lies in the identification of
the potentialities of the genome by searching all proteins
implied in this subsystem. Bioinformatic identifications
of genes in a genome are mostly performed by similarity
searches (using tools like FASTA[27] or BLAST[28])
against the full non-redundant protein UniProt databank
[29]. Additional tools have also been used to detect patterns (PROSITE [30,31], BLOCKS [32], SMART [33], PRODOM and CDD [34]) or structures (SCOP, [35,36]), to
classify enzymes (PRIAM [37]) and to assign function
(HAMAP [38]). Unfortunately, several problems persist in
the annotation, classification and naming of these
enzymes. Inconsistent gene function naming can result
from erroneous annotation of closest homolog proteins
in database entries. Classification of proteins of the same
enzymatic class (i.e. catalase) but belonging to different
sub-classes (haem-dependent monofunctional, bifunctional, Mn-dependent, etc.) is difficult using BLAST [28]
and/or FASTA [27] analysis because all these sequences
show significant amino acid similarities around their catalytic residue. Additionally, many unrelated functional
sequences appear to have "significant" similarities [39].
To improve the annotation of ROS/RNS response subsystems and to bypass previous inaccurate computer-assisted
annotations, we have developed a platform named Oxy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/637

Gene and an embedded supervised database (OxyDB)
with a new ontology and unambiguous anchor-based signatures for 37 ROS/RNS detoxification enzymes. The
package is freely available. Here, we describe the design of
OxyGene, and the procedures used to develop the OxyDB
database and validate the ab initio annotations. We also
present the user-friendly OxyGene interface that facilitates
browsing, visualization, downloads and comparisons of
OxyGene ab initio-annotated detoxification subsystems in
the entirely sequenced genomes of 612 Bacteria and 52
Archaea. We illustrate some of the uses of OxyGene, consider the resulting biological insights emerging from its
use and describe possible future developments.

Construction and content
OxyGene annotation operating principles
Annotation by "subsystem"
OxyGene annotates sets of genes that implement the same
oxidative stress response processes such as detoxification
or reduction. Each set is called a "subsystem", following
the definition developed by Overbeek et al. for the SEED
annotation environment [40]. Thus a subsystem is an
assembly of molecular functions that perform the same
biological process, based on new controlled vocabularies
and functional relationships. Each subsystem is assembled by a group of expert curators after mining all available (gene and protein) function assertions resources
(including the literature, databases, and sequence similarity searches). Compared to SEED, the detoxification subsystem defined in OxyGene is more exhaustive than the
SEED subsystem « Protection from Reactive Oxygen Species », which includes 6 functional roles (SodA, SodB,
SodC, HPII, HPI, CCP) while OxyGene proposes 37 functional roles. Moreover, the level of details of each protein
family in OxyGene has been refined by a phylogenetic tree
approach to give a more precise classification than the one
found in SEED.
Ab initio annotation
OxyGene performs an ab initio computational identification and classification of oxidative stress response genes,
as most existing annotation outputs are unsuitable for
data mining: this de novo annotation allowed (1) new loci
to be detected, (2) genes to be relocated in terms of the
coding frame or start codon, (3) new function descriptions to be proposed for previously annotated but hypothetical genes, (4) generic annotations (such a "oxidase")
to be reformulated, and (5) existing inaccurate functional
assertions to be detected.
Comprehensive and non-overlapping classification
Members of a protein class have the same general function
(e.g. catalase or nitric oxide dioxygenase) but often
include one or more subclasses with slightly different
properties, such as substrate specificity. To annotate these

Page 2 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:637

functional differences, each protein class is divided into
subclasses by manually inspecting and subdividing phylogenetic trees. Subdivision criteria are the distance,
domain architecture (number of domains, size and fusion
events) and data from the literature for each protein cluster. In OxyGene, subclasses are identified by OxyDB_IDs
(e.g. OXY.1.1.1.-) that include OxyDB_Tags (e.g.
CAT_MON), description (e.g. catalase monofunctional)
and additional information (see OxyDB database section). See additional file 1 for an example of the classification provided for the catalase class and subclasses.
Annotation using "anchors"
The most common approach to associating a gene unambiguously with a function is "inheritance through homology", estimated using tools like BLAST [28], PSI-BLAST
[28], or HMMER [41]. Although these tools have become
ubiquitous for annotation, they suffer various limitations:
there is no universal e-value cut-off criterion and the outputs can be skewed by the length of sequences. Moreover,
we found that these tools were unable to differentiate
closely related subclasses: using the CAT_SRP catalase
subclass as an input (for both BLAST and PSI-BLAST
tools), other subclasses (CAT_MON and CAT_GAT) were
also recruited with highly significant and overlapping evalues (illustrated in additional file 2). The HMMER
approach gave better results for the catalase family as each
profile specifically recruits each subclass (data not
shown). However, the efficiency of HMMER depends on
the dataset because, in profile-based approaches, all positions of the sequence alignment influence the final score.
This influence may prevent precise discrimination
between two closely related subfamilies, especially when
the sequences are short and the number of specific positions small. This is the case for instance of the truncatedglobin subclasses, wherein the GLB_TRO profile recruits
GLB_TRP sequences (additional file 2). Because the
anchor-based approach is strict, it unambiguously discriminates sequences that have different specific characters (i.e. the motifs), even if this specificity lies upon one
position only.

To avoid cross-recruitment between enzyme or protein
subclasses, OxyGene uses an anchor-driven annotation
process. Each anchor is a "subclass identifier", corresponding to one or several conservation patterns likely to
be responsible for specific functions. As mutations may
result in the loss of biological function, we hypothesize
that important amino acids are highly conserved across
protein (sub)families. This functional and/or structural
conservation is believed to be detectable as significant
conserved residue patterns. Based on this assumption, we
used, for each different ROS/RNS-scavenger subfamilies, a
published set of functional enzymes and highly similar
proteins (obtained by BLAST) to generate a significant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/637

number of representative sequences for each OxyDB.
Using multiple alignments procedures, conserved or substitutive amino acid [42] patterns were chosen, in each set
or subset of proteins, without discriminating between
functional and non-functional regions. Each resulting
anchor is composed of one or several motifs (regular
expressions in PROSITE format), separated by spacers and
organized as Boolean combinations without statistical
scoring.
Supervised and iterative annotation
The anchor-based approach guarantees the absence of
cross-recruitment between subclasses. However, to ensure
that no anchor may falsely detect functionally unrelated
proteins (false positives) or overlook a protein that carries
out the function (false negatives), OxyGene uses an iterative and manually supervised (by human curators) process. Each anchor is exhaustively validated in nonredundant databases (see OxyGene annotator) and revisited every three months on new genomes to confirm the
complete accuracy of OxyGene predictions.
OxyGene Components (Figure 1)
The OxyDB Database
OxyGene integrates an XML database incorporating new
manually extracted information for each ROS/RNS
enzyme and organized into seven fields of data (additional file 3):

1- The name of the subsystem: Although we have currently only implemented the detoxification subsystem,
other subsystems, for example repair and reduction, are
planned for inclusion.
2- The OxyDB nomenclature: This classification conforms to the IUBMB (International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) architecture and contains four
levels: classes that correspond to the enzymatic activity
(e.g. catalase) and three levels for subclass subdivisions
defined using combinations of biological data from the
literature and tree-based functional clustering (for details,
see the classification table on our web page).
3- The OxyDB anchors: These are checked quarterly
against all new (whole, being assembled and incomplete)
genomes; patterns are refined if required.
4- The OxyDB function confidence: This rates the degree
of confidence (DC) for each OxyDB_ID function and can
be described as follows: DC_1 corresponds to experimentally demonstrated and published functions; DC_2 relates
to an indirect function assertion (e.g. mutant, phenotype,
microarrays or translational fusions) and DC_3 is based
on sequence similarity to proteins rated DC_1 or DC_2.

5- The OxyDB chemical reaction(s): This "field" provides
the main chemical reaction(s) catalyzed by each
OxyDB_ID, as described in KEGG [43], SwissProt_Expasy
[44] and MetaCyc [45].

"re-annotated" loci are analysed by human curators and
classified if needed into reannotated (alternative start) or
frameshifted CDS, pseudogenes, and fragments (incomplete coding sequences).

6- The corresponding EC number: This allows each
OxyDB_ID to be linked to the corresponding enzyme
commission number(s) when available.

Human curators verified all the OxyGene predictions
using, for each OxyDB_ID, a systematic all-against-all
NCBI blastp and tblastn verification with non-redundant
(nr) databases for Bacteria (Taxid:2) and Archaea
(Taxid:2157). This procedure constituted a quality control
of the anchors with (i) refinement using detected false
predictions (negative or positive) and (ii) validation of
the motifs and Boolean combinations using incomplete
genomes (Additional file 4).

7- Additional descriptions. These details provide useful
knowledge about each OxyDB_ID functions and publications.
The OxyGene annotator
The OxyGene annotator was developed in C++ and is
embedded in a python script to generate the OxyGene
precompiled data repository (see below). It performs an
ab initio gene identification based on the new manually
supervised OxyDB ontology (see above).

First, the OxyGene annotator identifies each motif that
composes an anchor on six frames of translated DNA
using a motif search tool called WAPAM [46] (Weighted
Automaton Pattern Matching), available at Ouest-Genopole bioinformatics platform GenOuest [47]. All Bacteria
and Archaea in the NCBI comprehensive genome database (at the time of this publication, 664 species) were
parsed. This database is provided by GenOuest and
updated monthly using BioMAJ biological database workflow engine.
All occurrences detected by WAPAM are filtered to satisfy
(i) the inter-motif spacing and Boolean constraints of the
anchor and (ii) the presence of a stop codon and the
potential presence of start codons. At this point, all matching regions have been identified by OxyGene; only comparison with previous annotations needs to be performed.
When perfect matches are found (same frame and stop
position), the annotation start position is kept and its corresponding locus-tag and information are associated to
the match. Sometimes the beginning of an anchor is
found upstream of an annotated start; OxyGene then proposes a re-annotated tag. Loci that do not match any previously annotated genes are tagged as de novo. In the de novo
and re-annotated cases, the longest ORF prediction is proposed. Finally OxyGene associates each locus with an evidence score (annotation score, AS): AS_1 for the
experimentally validated protein defined by comparing
genes found in a database of experimentally validated
proteins [29,48]; AS_2 for proteins without biological evidence; and AS_3 for disrupted regions like frameshifts
(when two separate motifs of the same anchor are found
in two different frames of the same strand), or pseudogenes (one or two stops in frame). The procedure is
repeated iteratively for each OxyDB_ID. All "de novo" and

The OxyGene repository and web services
The OxyGene repository stores the OxyGene annotator
outputs indexed for each complete genome replicon.
These files are XML-encoded (eXtensible Markup Language) and include every detected locus with its
OxyDB_ID, annotation data (start and stop positions,
frame), annotation type (frameshift, de novo etc),
sequences (protein and nucleic), and function and evidence scores. This repository is updated incrementally.

The locally installed OxyGene Graphical User Interface
(GUI) accesses the OxyGene repository through some private web services, implemented in Java 1.5 using the
Apache AXIS 1.4 SOAP (Simple Object Architecture Protocol) library and deployed on the servlet engine Tomcat
5.5.20. The SOAP server provides a framework for
exchanging XML data between the OxyGene repository
and the GUI. The three web services are devoted to (i) initialization query that contacts OxyDB and genome databases, (ii) repertory query that allows a request for a
genome, and (iii) OxyDB_ID query that retrieves all Bacteria or Archaea that contain at least one gene belonging
to the requested OxyDB subclass.

Utility and discussion
The OxyGene Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The OxyGene platform has been developed as a clientserver application. The server is installed at GenOuest BioInformatics platform [47]. The client is a Java application
that needs to be downloaded locally by the users and
which communicates with the server-side databases
(OxyDB, OxyGene repository, Genomes data) through
web-services. The client is platform-independent and runs
with Java Run-time Environment version 5.0 or higher.
The OxyGene GUI was successfully tested on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

The client GUI, written using Java Swing API, is a unique
window with six tabs entitled "Knowledge", "Input",
"Genomes and Genes Tables", "Sequences", "Maps" and

Page 5 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:637

"Localisation" (Figure 2.). The "Knowledge" tab contains
a summary of OxyGene a priori data (list of the available
sequenced genomes, list of the OxyDB_IDs, OxyGene
ontology and maps). The "Input" tab contains the query
interface and supports two types of requests: by
OxyDB_ID or by genome(s). The genomes can be selected
by browsing an alphabetic list, by organism name completion or through a hierarchical taxonomic tree. Query
results are accessible in tables and sequence tabs. The
"Genomes Table" contains, for every 37 enzyme subclasses, the number of paralogs by genome together with
their corresponding annotation confidence for each locus
tag (Figure 2a). The "Genes Table" provide further
detailed information such as locus tag, positions, frame,
gene name and their links to NCBI [49] and KEGG [43].
The tables also discriminate between already annotated
genes, re-annotated genes, de novo loci and also pseudogenes, and fragmented and/or shifted frames. These tables
can be saved into tab-separated text files that are easily
opened by spreadsheet applications. Additionally, nucleic
and protein sequences can be selected and downloaded,
in fasta format, in the "Sequences" tab (Figure 2b). The
OxyGene "Maps" tab (Figure 2c) provides several options
for visualizing and comparing the detoxification pathway
of any sequenced genome on maps built using the
jgraph.jar library [50]. A representation of the genomic
localisation can be viewed, saved and compared in the
"Localisation" tab (Figure 2d) which uses the CGView API
[51]. A complete up-to-date "OxyGene GUI user guide" is
available for download from the OxyGene website.
Improvement of detoxification subsystem annotation
The OxyGene platform proposes a new classification that
improves both the ontology and the annotation of the
detoxification subsystem in whole prokaryotic genomes.
Classification and ontology
For example, by retrieving the original 956 NCBI descriptions of the five OxyGene catalase subclasses, we found 39
different functional assertions (Table 1). Some of these initial descriptions are (i) false (e.g. a DNA mismatch endonuclease and a putative chaperone protein in Burkholderia
pseudomallei, and a phosphopyruvate hydratase in Haemophilus influenzae); (ii) inconsistent with the enzyme function
(e.g. a monofunctional catalase annotated as a putative catalase/peroxidase in Enterococcus faecalis V583) or (iii) incomplete (e.g. HktE in Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida str.
Pm70, YdbD in Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, YdhU in
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42). Such diversity, heterogeneity and in some cases error in initial descriptions are found
for all OxyGene detoxification classes; for example, there are
more than sixty descriptions for the iron-manganese
SOD_FMN.

OxyGene functional assertions satisfy the four core criteria
of the definition of the ontology proposed by Gruber [52]:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/637

(i) Clarity in naming (e.g. CAT_MON is a typical monofunctional catalase); (ii) Coherence: no contradictions
between function and description; (iii) Extendibility: new
classes or subclasses can be added when necessary and (iv)
Minimal ontological commitment: specifying the common term that defines all members of a subclass (e.g.
CAT_MNG includes both spore- and non-spore catalases,
so the term CAT_SPO was discarded).
Detection of mistakes in original annotations
Among the 6534 detoxification enzymes defined by OxyGene, 388 are annotated as "hypothetical protein" in
NCBI files. Such "hypothetical proteins" are found in all
classes with most (40%) in the peroxidase class, the other
classes containing 1 to 14% (see Figure 3a). Regarding
subclasses (Figure 3b), the presence of "hypothetical proteins" in recently described groups (GLB_xxx, [53]) can be
explained; however, their presence in old, well-characterized enzyme subclasses, such as the catalase subclass, is
more surprising [54]. We found that a BlastP analysis,
using a "hypothetical" mis-annotated catalase as input,
recruited other "hypothetical" mis-annotated catalases as
first hits. This demonstrates how the absence of updating
or correction in databases can lead to the propagation of
annotation errors, as discussed by other authors [55,56].

At the scale of single genomes, the improvement in annotation of the detoxification subsystem by OxyGene is in
some cases remarkable. For example, in Vibrio harveyi
ATCC BAA-1116, OxyGene added four new detoxification
proteins (PRX_AHP, PRX_BCP, OHR_LKE and
SOD_CUZ), encoded on both chromosomes, raising the
number of predicted ROS/RNS response genes from 12 to
16. Such omissions are observed in 165 complete
genomes and this may have significant consequences for
biological experiments (e.g. absence of phenotype in a
mutant study) as well as on "in silico" studies (i.e. erroneous conclusions concerning detoxification abilities of
organisms). Therefore, the OxyGene platform appears to
be a powerful tool, and its impact on annotation will
increase with the addition of new oxidative stress-related
subsystems.
New annotations
Two indices may be used to assess the performance of the
OxyGene platform: the specificity (improvements in original annotations, see above) and the sensitivity (discovery
of missed features). Sensitivity is evidenced by the observation that OxyGene identifies 13 "overlooked" loci, all in
intergenic regions (Additional file 5, table A). These new
ORFs range from ca. 100 to 700 aa in length and can be
identified from the presence of functional domains (catalases, superoxide dismutases etc). This high sensitivity is
observed for all OxyDB classes and may be due to the
combination of the ab initio and anchor-driven strategies
used by OxyGene.

NCBI original descriptions of prokaryotic catalases and comparison with the new ontology proposed by OxyGene Numbers stand for ab initio
annotated catalases that were re-classed by OxyGene.

Additionally, OxyGene detected eight alternate translational starts sites (TSS), all predicted upstream from the
originally annotated TSS (Additional file 5, Table B). All
these reassignments of TSS were based on extensive comparative genomic analysis. In all cases, the amino acid
homology could be significantly extended by between 30
and 92 residues. As TSS mis-annotations affect the prediction of protein function, location (signal peptide) and
transcriptional regulation, it is essential to accurately reannotate these loci in OxyGene.

mutation). If confirmed, these OxyGene predictions
would indicate that genes of the detoxification subsystem
are subject to deleterious events.

OxyGene also detected seven new frameshifted genes, ten
pseudogenes and four fragments (not shown). For each of
these cases, it will be necessary to determine whether these
"interruptions" are due to sequencing errors or to muta-

Archaea. The genomes with large numbers of detoxification genes present a high rate of paralogs (up to six
OHR_OHR genes in Burkolderia cenocepacia), suggesting
that no genome needs to contain all OxyDB classes. Of the
nine genomes that do not possess any detoxification
genes, three are endosymbiotic bacteria, but surprisingly
six are free-living organisms (including Lactobacillus and
Brevibacterium). This may suggest that: (i) some ROS/RNS
response genes are still unidentified; (ii) other "satellite"
subsystems (e.g. redox buffering, reduction, protein and
DNA repair, etc.) serve as substitutives; (iii) there are compensatory processes in the environment, possibly involving cooperation between organisms.
In each of the six classes, the predominant subclasses are
CAT_MON,
SOD_FMN,
PRX_BCP,
GLB_HMP,
NOR_NRF and SOR_NLR (Additional file 6). Genomes
that contain only one or two detoxification genes tend to
have a SOD and/or a peroxidase (SOD_FMN and

PRX_BCP are present in 90% and 80% of the genomes,
respectively). All OxyDB subclasses are found in Bacteria,
but Archaea do not seem to use the whole spectrum of
detoxification genes (16 subclasses are absent). Moreover,
some OxyDB subclasses are differently distributed in the
two kingdoms: for instance, the SOR_NLR, RBR_RBR and
PRX_1CY genes, are much more frequent among Archaea
than Bacteria, genomes whereas PRX_AHP, PRX_TPX and
GSH_PRX genes are rare in Archaea but present in many
Bacteria. Although the number of sequenced Archaea is
still small (52 genomes), analyses of these differences will
help determine the respective contributions of phylogeny
inheritance, ecosystem adaptation and/or lifestyle in the
selection pressures on the actors of the detoxification subsystem.

detoxification subsystems to help formulate biological

hypotheses. For example, there are significant differences
between four Rhizobiales (Rhizobium etli, Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae) despite them being closely related
(Figure 5): some subclasses seem to be genus-dependent
(CAT-MON and GLB-HPM in Sinorhizobia, GSH-PRX in
Rhizobia) and others species-dependent (two CAT-MNG
in S. medicae and none in S. meliloti) although the two spe-

cies genomes are very similar (99.7% of identity of ribosomal RNAs [57]). The number of paralogs is also diverse,
with one HPX-HPX in R. etli but more than three paralogs
in the other three genomes.
The OxyGene detoxification maps are also very informative. As an example, the intersection of the four Rhizobiale
maps shows that there are only nine common enzymes,

mainly superoxide dismutase (SOD_FMN, SOD_CUZ)
and peroxidase (PRX_1CY, PRX_BCP, HPX_HPX,
CAT_BFL, OHR_OHR) activities (additional file 7). Both
table and map representations can be completed by comparisons of the gene locations through the OxyGene
CGview-based replicon viewer. Such treatment of S.
meliloti and S. medicae replicons revealed that: (i) the
detoxification genes seem to be randomly distributed and
found on all replicons; (ii) some genomic regions are
well-conserved (same genes, orientation, order, distance
etc) whereas numerous genes are "singles" and in various
locations; (iii) most of the syntenic regions contain the
"core" Rhizobiale detoxification enzymes and (iv) additional loci are not necessarily correlated with additional
replicons (additional file 8).

OxyGene will make a very large contribution towards our
understanding of the overall importance of detoxification
systems.

Conclusion

Programming languages: C++, Python and Java 5

The 21st century is going to be a fruitful period with the
start of the "genome" era. There are currently 3370
projects listed [58]: 813 published, 130 metagenomes,
2637 in progress (1801 Bacteria, 90 Archaea and 936
Eukaryotes). The forthcoming availability of 2500 bacterial genomes raises again the issue of annotation accuracy.
Numerous problems need to be solved: omission of
ORFs, partial or erroneous annotation, mistake propagation, absence of updating and disparity in function ontology. The most problematic consequence is the difficulty
and even impossibility of efficiently exploiting the large
and ever increasing amounts of "genomic" data. Therefore, it is important to design and develop dedicated bioinformatic tools devoted to supervised genomic data
mining.
For this reason, we have developed OxyGene, an innovative platform that allows ab initio annotation and comparative analysis of detoxification subsystems in whole
prokaryotic genomes. The annotation is manually supervised and supported by an iterative anchor-based process.
The OxyGene GUI allows rapid and reliable identification
of all genes encoding detoxification enzymes in complete
genomes (even those that were previously not or misannotated), and then comparison of detoxification subsystems, maps and chromosomal locations. The accuracy
of the predictions is maintained by regular human curator
verifications.
OxyGene is unique. Indeed, no equivalent free software is
currently available, and OxyGene is the first tool dedicated to oxidative stress. These ROS/RNS stresses are frequent in cells and the resulting imbalance between the
generation and elimination of oxidants often leads to cell
damage or death. Paradoxically, oxidative bursts are
described as being essential signals for most prokaryote/
eukaryote interactions. Consequently, we anticipate that

In future development, OxyGene will include additional
oxidative stress-related subsystems and connections with
other metabolic pathways (e.g. on KEGG or METACYC).
An "eukaryotic" version is in development.
