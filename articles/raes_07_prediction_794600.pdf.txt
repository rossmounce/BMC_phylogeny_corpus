important drawbacks. For instance, they have difficulties discriminating between the different ploidy levels of cells [7-9],
and so any technique measuring DNA content does not necessarily measure genome size. In addition, DNA binding of
stains used in the majority of these studies (for example,
DAPI) is not always specific, and important biasing factors
(GC content, permeability, salinity, influence of debris, and so
on) have hardly been compensated for [7,10-12]. Finally,
some estimates have been obtained in studies using cultured
isolates only (for example, se the reports by Christensen [8]
and Torsvik [13] and their groups), which does not reflect the

Because of its direct link with the functional repertoire,
microbial genome size is an important ecologic parameter
that is believed to be closely coupled to the functional complexity and environmental niche of an organism [1-4]. For
more than three decades, numerous studies have provided
estimates of average microbial genome size for various environments, but results vary greatly. Estimates of the average
DNA content per cell (converted to megabases [Mb] for comparison) range from 1.5 to 8.0 Mb for soil and from 1.5 to 9.5
Mb for aquatic environments (see Loferer-Krossbacher and
coworkers [5] and Torsvik [6] for overviews of estimates).
However, the diversity of techniques and parameters used
(for example, sample filtering, DNA staining, and cell counting) greatly hampers the interpretation and comparison of
these results. All currently used methods also have several

We introduce a novel computational approach to predict effective genome size (EGS; a measure
that includes multiple plasmid copies, inserted sequences, and associated phages and viruses) from
short sequencing reads of environmental genomics (or metagenomics) projects. We observe
considerable EGS differences between environments and link this with ecologic complexity as well
as species composition (for instance, the presence of eukaryotes). For example, we estimate EGS
in a complex, organism-dense farm soil sample at about 6.3 megabases (Mb) whereas that of the
bacteria therein is only 4.7 Mb; for bacteria in a nutrient-poor, organism-sparse ocean surface
water sample, EGS is as low as 1.6 Mb. The method also permits evaluation of completion status
and assembly bias in single-genome sequencing projects.

remains a matter of speculation. Recently, however, several
studies have provided unprecedented insights into the microbial DNA content of complete ecosystems using massive random shotgun sequencing of environmental samples [14-16].
Through comparative metagenomics, various aspects of ecologic complexity can now be studied [15,17-20]. Here, we use
these data to study the relationship between environment and
microbial genome size.

Results and discussion
The concept of effective genome size
An assembled, sequenced genome is a nonredundant representation of the naturally occurring amount of base pairs that
a cell supports. It reflects neither actual copy number of
inserted elements and plasmids nor the amount of associated
phages and viruses. However, the total amount of DNA replicated per cell division is what determines the metabolic cost
and what has to be balanced against the full functional spectrum of genes available to a given organism. To estimate the
latter, ecologically more meaningful measure of genome size
(subsequently referred to as 'effective genome size' [EGS]),
we have developed a novel computational approach to predict
EGS directly from raw shotgun sequencing data, thereby
avoiding experimental biases such as are mentioned above.
When applied to metagenomics data, our method measures
the average EGS of organisms living in the sampled
environment.

Deriving a method for EGS prediction
In brief, we use a set of marker genes that typically occur only
once per genome to extrapolate the average genome size from
the density of these genes found in the total set of sequence
reads. Even in complex metagenomics data, the total number
of marker genes should be proportional to the number of
genome equivalents (and thus individuals) present, and the
marker gene density (number of marker genes divided by the
number of sequenced base pairs) should thus be inversely
correlated to the average size of the genomes in the sample.
This approach would also be able to normalize, unlike previous DNA measurements, for intermittent episodes of polyploidy (for example, in the case of fast-growing microbes that
may replicate multiple concurrent copies of their genomes);
in these situations our marker genes themselves are present
in multiple copies and their density does not change.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/1/R10

Previous studies have shown that genes involved in translation, ribosome structure, and biogenesis generally exhibit a
low number of duplicates per genome and their number does
not expand much with genome size [2,21-24], and thus would
constitute suitable marker genes to estimate the number of
individuals in a sample, irrespective of genome size. However, when applying orthologous group (OG) categories for
identifying such genes, we still observed a slight positive correlation between genome size and the number of translationrelated genes (Figure 1a). Therefore, we selected a universally
occurring set of marker genes (largely overlapping with the
ones used by Ciccarelli and coworkers [25]) that only very
rarely occur as duplicates, such that the total marker gene
count remains constant with increasing genome size (Figure
1a; also see Materials and methods, below). The selected
marker genes (most of them, but not all involved in translation) can be considered to be both essential for cellular life
and very ancient; they evolve at a slow rate and are members
of basal cellular processes, exhibiting little variation across
phyla.
To identify the relationship between the density (count per
megabase [Mb]) of the combined set of these selected markers and genome size, we calibrated our method on simulated
shotgun reads from 154 completely sequenced bacterial and
archaeal genomes (see Materials and methods, below).
Indeed, although the relationship between the true number of
occurrences of each marker gene and the number of individuals (and thus the relationship between their density and
average genome size) is simple, the relationship between the
number of BLAST-observable instances of a combined set of
marker genes in incomplete environmental shotgun data and
the number of individuals is not so straightforward. In addition, the length of sequencing reads can seriously influence
the likelihood of successfully detecting a marker gene using
BLAST (data not shown). Therefore, we performed a threedimensional calibration relating marker gene density x, read
length L, and genome size (Figure 1b; see Materials and methods, below), resulting in the following relationship:

EGS =

a + b × L−c (with a = 21.2, b = 4230, and c = 0.733)
x

This relation can be used to predict genome size (in Mb) from
the two other parameters x and L. This formula indeed shows

Method validation on real shotgun data and detection
of sequencing artifacts
To confirm that the simulated data represent a valid approximation of real sequencing reads, we measured the prediction
error on publicly available sets of microbial whole-genome
raw shotgun sequencing reads (Figure 2). (Note that only 32
such datasets were present in NCBI's trace archives at the
time of analysis; a larger training set of whole-genome
sequencing reads should allow further improvement of the
method.) The analysis of this prediction error on 'real' reads
revealed a systematic shift of predicted versus known genome
sizes by 15.9%, most likely reflecting unequal representation
of certain genomic regions in sequencing libraries ('cloning
bias' due to library preparation, toxicity, restriction site
biases, and other factors). After correction for this bias (which
leads to an adjustment of the values for a and b in Eqn 1 [see
Materials and methods, below]), the median error on real
shotgun data is as low as about 7.8% (SD 14.4%; Figure 2; also
see Materials and methods, below). The two outliers with
larger errors can be linked to anomalies in the deposited
reads, caused by contamination (Wolbachia) or collapsing of
repeated insert sequences (Dehalococcoides; Figure 2). The
latter example illustrates that the EGS predicted by our
method does not just reflect the principal, nonredundant
chromosome, but indeed it also considers the actual copy
number of inserted elements and plasmids. The importance

Because these cases indicate that our approach can identify
assembly artifacts or incomplete cloning material, we applied
the method to unfinished genome sequencing projects that
have not recently been updated and might have had a problematic project history (Additional data file 4). Our method
appears to yield plausible results on the whole, as in the
majority of cases our predictions stay within the error ranges
of previous estimates based on, for example, pulse-field gel
electrophoresis. In a few cases our method reveals a larger
genome size than was initially anticipated, which might
explain problems in achieving sufficient sequence coverage
(such as for the Chloroflexus aurantiacus genome); here, our
predictions can provide guidance as to the amount of
sequence data needed for genome completion. This is
expected to be particularly useful in sequencing projects that

Because marker genes are equally present in all species, our
method should work well on complex, mixed samples (a theoretical proof can be found in the Additional data file 1). We
further support this by performing simulations mixing species and read lengths. For mixtures, the contribution of each
species should weighted by the fraction (in numbers of
genomes) it takes up in the sample. For example, for a mixture of two species of 4 Mb (90% of genomes) and 12 Mb (10%
of genomes), we should get EGS = 0.9 × 4 Mb + 0.1 × 12 Mb.
Our simulations show that this is indeed this case (see Materials and methods, below; Additional data file 1; and Additional data file 3).

of this additional genomic repertoire ('mobilome' [26]) is not
to be underestimated. For example, a 20% variation in chromosome length was described for different isolates of
Escherichia coli [27].

the inverse relationship between EGS and marker gene density, but corrected by a read-length-dependent factor following a power law. An analysis of sources and magnitudes of
errors in predicted genome sizes showed that inaccuracies
stem mostly from finite sequencing depth, from uncertainties
associated with identification of marker gene sequences using
BLAST, and from residual biological variation in genomic
marker gene count (see Additional data file 1). The error contribution from finite depth is small when more than about
four times the average genome size was sequenced (Additional data file 2; this is the case in the environmental shotgun-sequenced samples currently available). On the whole,
the median unsigned prediction error on the simulated shotgun data was 5.3% (standard deviation [SD] 8.7%), largely
independent of genome size and read length (Additional data
file 2).

NCBI's trace archive (see Additional data file 9 for a list). The majority of
predictions have an error estimate <20%, with a median value of about 9%.
There are, however, two exceptions in which the error is significantly
larger. The first is the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster.
The marker OG density in the simulated reads is considerably higher than
in the real shotgun data, leading to a 70% difference in predicted genome
size. After further investigation of the raw reads, we noticed that this
difference was caused by an important contamination of the dataset by
reads originating from the organism's host, Drosophila, that were filtered
out during the assembly of the genome but that are still present in the
shotgun data available at the trace archive. The second exception is the
genome of the PCE-dechlorination bacterium Dehalococcoides ethenogenes.
Also here, the marker OG density in the shotgun data is lower than in the
simulated dataset. Mapping of the publicly available reads to the genome
sequence showed a peak of read density in a region that was identified to
be an integrated element that is believed to exist in variable copy numbers
in different individuals but was only included once in the published genome
sequence [51]. OG, orthologous group.

Measurements of the EGS in the samples shows that the soil
sample has the largest EGS, together with two of the Sargasso
Sea samples of large cell size fractions, whereas the other Sargasso Sea samples have very low EGS estimates (Table 1). In
order to test whether these values reflect functional complex-

refereed research

Having established methods for measuring EGS, we applied
them to 12 publicly available environmental sequence data
sets: five communities that were sampled without particle
size filtering (a soil community, an acidophilic underground
biofilm ['acid mine drainage'], and three deep sea whale carcass scavenger communities ['whale falls'] [14,15]), and also
seven Sargasso Sea water samples of different cell size fractions. (For the latter, sea water was pumped through two consecutive filters: a first 'prefilter' to remove larger organisms
and debris, and a second 'collection filter' for sampling.
Therefore, each Sargasso Sea sample should be interpreted
with the corresponding organismal size range in mind
[16,31].)

The acid mine drainage dataset derived from a biofilm at pH
0.83 [14] provides a first large-scale glimpse of genomic properties of free-living extremophiles. When only considering the
bacterial EGS for the acid mine drainage sample, our results
show an increase of 50% compared with the overall measure
(3.2 Mb versus 2.1 Mb; Table 1 and Figure 3). This might be
explained by the presence of small genome archaea (Ferroplasma acidarmanus fer1 and Ferroplasma type II), which
(as estimated by BLAST-based phylotyping; data not shown)
appear to dominate the deposited reads. Indeed, the calculated EGS of archaea in this sample (1.8 Mb) is in accordance
with the genome sizes of the two assembled species. Intriguingly, the bacteria-specific EGS in the acid mine drainage
sample (3.2 Mb) is more than twice as large as the average
parasite/symbiont genome size [34] and is thus in conflict
with the proposed theory that genome evolution patterns of
free-living extremophiles are similar to those of intracellular
pathogens or symbionts [35].

deposited research

Measuring effective genome size of real environments
using metagenomics data

The only outlier in these estimates is that of sample 1 (station
13/11), which has a bacterial-specific EGS of 3.4 Mb, which is
about twice as large as all other samples (Table 1). However,
for this sample, contamination with Shewanella and Burkholderia, two terrestrial species, has been proposed [20,33],
which could explain the EGS differences.

reports

In order to better understand these effects, we adapted the
method to measure EGS specifically for only the bacterial or
archaeal fraction of the sample (see Materials and methods,
below). To do this, we divide the number of hits to marker
genes of bacterial/archaeal origin (as determined by the best
BLAST hit in the STRING database [30]) by the number of
hits to any bacterial/archaeal gene. Calibration of this
domain-specific marker gene density on known genomes
shows that, as expected, it scales inversely linear to genome
size. The error is read-length-independent and is not influenced by genome size. Median prediction error for real bacterial shotgun reads is 8.0% (SD 14.6%) for the bacteria-specific
measure (see Additional data file 1 and Additional data files 5
and 6). The archaea-specific measure is associated with a
higher prediction error (see Materials and methods, below)
because of the small number of genomes available for calibration and will improve when more genomes become available
for this domain.

ity of the micro-organisms in the sample or only reflect phylogenetic composition of the samples, we applied our method
of measuring bacterial/archaeal EGS. The comparison of the
latter with the general EGS measure shows that in a number
of the samples analyzed here, the presence of eukaryotes
indeed has an important effect on the estimated EGS. For
example, the value for soil is reduced by about 25% when
eukaryotes are excluded. However, the most drastic differences are seen in the Sargasso Sea samples 5 and 6 (the two
largest cell size fractions), which are reduced by more than
75% and 50%, respectively, now causing all Sargasso size fractions to become statistically indistinguishable and converge
to an average bacteria-specific EGS of 1.6 Mb (sample 1
excluded [see below]; Table 1 and Figure 3). In addition, the
fact that the samples originate from four different sampling
sites in the Sargasso Sea (stations 11/13, 3, 13, and S) and were
taken at different time points [16] suggests that microenvironmental differences are not influencing genome size or,
alternatively, that there are very little differences in the bacterial populations of these sites. Indeed, water currents can
allow for a rapid and continuous homogenization of communities, and previous studies showed very little variation in GC
content between samples with similar filtering treatment
[32], arguing for the latter explanation.

reviews

In complex environmental samples, the proportion of eukaryotic DNA present may have a large impact on EGS measurements. Because of their disproportionally larger genome size,
even a minor fraction of eukaryotes in the sample could
inflate EGS. Thus, the relationship between organism complexity, EGS, and environment becomes difficult to interpret,
even though eukaryotes are a valid part of an environmental
sample and a higher proportion of eukaryotes should go hand
in hand with a higher degree of complexity.

gives a correct general EGS of bacteria living in this environment. When considering only the bacterial fraction, we can
hence compare these samples with the other (unfiltered)
samples in order to investigate the influence of environmental factors on genome size. Our results show that soil bacterial
EGS is significantly larger than that of the pooled noncontaminated Sargasso Sea samples (P = 5.5 × 10-6, after correction for multiple comparisons) and marginally significantly
larger than acid mine drainage (P = 0.04) and the pooled
whale falls (P = 0.053). Although the genomes of fully
sequenced soil dwellers were already noted to have a tendency to be larger than others [1,21], we provide here - for the
first time - conclusive evidence for this hypothesis based on
an unbiased sampling of thousands of soil bacteria. Soil is a
very challenging environment for two reasons: the high
organism density, leading to strong competition for nutrients
as well as complex communication and cooperation strategies; and the highly variable living conditions (for example,
seasons and weather) [36]. Therefore, a broad functional repertoire is needed in order to survive competition and adapt to
ever-changing conditions. Together with the fact that only
about 50% of the predicted soil genes have a match in current
protein databases, our results imply a wide variety of novel
functions and processes in soil, potentially including biotechnologically relevant ones such as defense (antibiotics), biosynthesis, and biodegradation.
The EGS of the Sargasso Sea samples is significantly smaller
than that of all other samples. The explanation could lie in the
lower organism density in Sargasso surface waters (about
three orders of magnitude smaller than soil [16,37]), which
would allow organisms to shed the functional repertoire presumably needed for survival in densely populated, substratebound habitats, or alternatively 'genome streamlining' to
optimize replication under limiting nutrient resources, as was

Conclusion

Detection of marker genes
We used a set of 35 OGs that are widely conserved (present in
most species), rarely occur as duplicate genes in known
genomes, are not subject to horizontal gene transfer, and do
not scale with genome size as marker genes (set largely overlapping with the one used by Ciccarelli and coworkers [25];
Figure 1 and Additional data file 7). Marker gene counts were
carried out using an approach similar to the one described
previously [15], based on comparisons with known proteins.
In brief, DNA sequence reads (or, alternatively, randomly
generated genome fragments) were searched against the
extended database of proteins assigned to OGs in the latest
STRING release (6.3) [30], using BLASTX [44], and an OG
was called present when a hit matching one of its proteins
occurred (with a BLAST score of at least 60 bits). Note that
this procedure is largely independent on varying annotation
qualities across genomes, and avoids biases owing to lower
gene prediction quality on short sequences [17], such as the
reads used in this study.

information

The applications above illustrate the importance of this
parameter (together with the functional and phylogenetic
characterization of samples) in the process of elucidating eco-

interactions

Query sequences were allowed to map to several OGs, provided these overlapped by no more than 50% of the shortest
assignment. BLASTX was run using the BLOSUM62 matrix,
and low-complexity filtering was enabled. Marker gene density x was then defined as the number of matches to reference
genes, divided by the total number of megabases surveyed.

refereed research

In order to avoid potential biases introduced by any uneven
phylogenetic representation within the reference set of
known proteins, all BLASTX matches exceeding an overall
protein identity of 50% were discarded. This latter step is
needed to avoid artefacts introduced by the occasional organism in the sample that happens to be closely related to a
known organism in the BLAST database. For such an organism, even marker genes contained only partially on a read can
be detectable by BLAST because of their high sequence identity to known genes. In contrast, most environmental genes
have low sequence identity to known genes, and so fragmented marker genes often escape detection. Thus, without
the above threshold, marker gene counts would be higher for
well known organisms, biasing the results. (Note that the
threshold does not select against well known organisms
either; their genes will still generate hits with other organisms
in the database, with identities below 50%, and will thus be
counted like any other environmental marker gene.)

deposited research

Furthermore, an accurate estimate of average genome sizes
for different environments is paramount for other
approaches to elucidating the totality of ecosystem composition and functioning. For example, widely used techniques
such as DNA reassociation kinetics help one to understand
ecosystem species composition and biodiversity as a whole
[37,41], but they require knowledge of the average genome
size to translate genetic diversity into species diversity. Even
environmental cell counts (used for various applications)
heavily depend on the selection of a reference species with a
genome size comparable with the sampled ecosystem average
[42]. For the analysis of metagenomics data, the average
genome size allows one to calculate early in a pipeline the
amount of sequencing necessary for completion of the most
dominant species [15], and is needed for the deduction of
community structures from assembly data [43]. Currently,
our method is limited to predicting only the average EGS,
without describing the distribution of genome sizes within the
sample. However, improvements in phylogenetic separation
of metagenomic sequences should allow the adaptation of our
method to predict genome size distributions in the future.

Materials and methods

reports

Using a novel computational approach, we have shown how
EGS can be directly determined from raw sequencing reads,
either for single species or entire organismal communities.
EGS can be reliably estimated for complex environments as a
whole, but also for bacterial or archaeal subcommunities in a
sample. Applying this method to diverse environmental datasets, we could establish a relationship between genome size
and environment, suggesting a clear correlation between
environmental complexity and the diversity of the cellular
repertoire that is required to cope with various external challenges. Because EGS directly reflects the functional diversity
of a community, it will not only serve as a useful ecologic
parameter but might also play a role in the search for novel
biologic activities.

system properties from metagenomics data. The EGS, as predicted here, is thus applicable to a broad range of questions
and techniques ranging from genomics via population genetics to ecology.

reviews

As expected, acid mine drainage and whalefall EGS estimates
are in between both extremes, in accordance with their
densely populated substrate-bound lifestyle, but under relatively stable environmental conditions [14,15].

seen for Pelagibacter ubique [34], a member of the SAR11
clade, and Prochlorococcus [38-40], which dominates oceanic surface waters. Our estimated EGS is consistent with the
genome sizes of these organisms (1.3 Mb for Pelagibacter and
1.6 Mb for the Prochlorococcus high-light-adapted ecotype
[34,39]) and the previously reported low GC content of Sargasso sequences [32], as GC content scales with genome size
[1].

Calibrating marker gene density with genome size, and
genome size prediction
To determine the relationship between the occurrence of
marker genes and genome size, we used fully sequenced
genomes for calibration. We simulated the widely used whole
genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing process by randomly
extracting 'reads' of variable read length from 154 previously
completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes (EBI
Genome Reviews release 17). In total, 50 genomes were randomly chosen per read length bin (300, 400, 500, 600, 700,
800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200 base pairs [bp]), and reads were
sampled until 3× coverage was achieved (see Additional data
file 8 for a list of genomes). We did not distinguish between
plasmid and chromosomal DNA (each DNA fragment of a
completely sequenced genome was equally likely to be
considered).
We determined the occurrences of marker genes among these
'reads' as described above. On these counts, we based a threedimensional calibration, relating known genome size to the
parameters read length and marker gene density. Because the
total number of marker genes per genome does not vary with
genome size, we expect that genome size increases proportionally to the inverse marker gene density 1/x at any given
read length L: EGS = c(L)/x, where c(L) is a read-lengthdependent calibration factor. The exact form of c(L) is determined not only by the read-length dependence of the probability of sequencing a portion of a marker gene, but also by the
probability of identifying a read as a marker gene. Because the
latter depends on sequence features of individual marker
genes, it is not easily possible to specify the analytical form of
c(L) a priori. Based on manual comparison of a variety of possible functional forms, we found that c(L) is well approximated by a power law, c(L) = a + b × L-c. This is indeed the
best (R2 = 0.97) 'simple' three-parameter formula relating
genome size to marker gene density and read length, as confirmed using the TableCurve3D v.4.0 package; a 'simple'
equation is defined here as a three parameter equation consisting of a constant and two coefficients that multiply a function of x or L. This resulted in the prediction formula:

EGS =

a + b × L−c
x

(1)

We estimated the parameters of this formula with a nonlinear
least-squares fit, as implemented with the nls function in the
R programming environment [45]. First, we randomly
selected half of the species in the simulated data. Their complete sets of simulation results (marker gene densities x at
specified read lengths L), together with the known genome
sizes z, were used as calibration data (the remaining data were
later used for detailed error estimation; see Additional data
file 1 and Additional data file 2). Parameters a, b, and c were
chosen such as to minimize the weighted sum of squares ([a
+ b × L-c]/x - z)2/z. This led to the parameter estimates a =
21.2, b = 4230, and c = 0.733.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/1/R10

Because Eqn 1 is linear in the inverse marker gene density x-1,
it can be directly applied to mixtures of genomes, which was
supported by our simulations. In the case of species mixtures,
the estimated mean EGS is the number of megabases per
genome present in the sample (effective genome sizes of different species are weighted by their genome count, not by
their contribution to the number of sequenced base pairs).
Because Eqn 1 is further approximately linear in the inverse
read length L-1, it can also be applied to sequence datasets
with mixed read lengths. (For a full discussion and simulation
of EGS prediction in mixtures, see Additional data file 1 and
Additional data file 3).
So far, calibration was based on simulated reads from fully
sequenced genomes, ignoring potential biases introduced, for
instance, by cloning. To test our predictions on actual
sequencing data, we downloaded and analyzed shotgun data
of completed genomes from the NCBI and Ensembl trace
repositories [46,47], excluding those projects for which
sequencing coverage was low (<1.5×; Additional data file 9).
In order to ensure consistency we applied a uniform quality
clipping method to all 32 datasets, rather than using the
provided coordinates of each sequencing centre (phred quality cut-off score of 15, using a perl script kindly provided by
Jarrod Chapman [JGI]; clipped reads with fewer then 100
nucleotides remaining were discarded). We found that Eqn 1
overestimates genome size on average by 15.9%. This reflects
a strong bias against the marker genes, probably resulting
from the fact that these 35 OGs were chosen for their strongly
conserved single-copy distribution across genomes, and
hence introduction of additional genes into the cloning vector
is often lethal. Removal of this bias by an additional scaling
factor (excluding the outliers Wolbachia and Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195, as discussed in the main text) results
in the new parameter values a = 18.26 and b = 3650 for Eqn 1.

Species mixture simulations
In order to generate species mixtures, we first randomly
picked 60 out of the entire list of completely sequenced cellular genomes, and simulated WGS sequencing for all 60
genomes using read-length bins from 600 to 900, as
described above. We then generated 1,000 simulated metagenomes, by repeating the following procedure 1,000 times.
First, a random number i of species were picked (with 1 <i ≤
60). Second, for each of the i species, its contributing nucleotides ni was randomized, using the following condition
regarding the total number of nucleotides in the
metagenome:

Third, a readlength was randomly picked from the available

generated (total sequence about 40 Escherichia coli K12 sized

interactions

For EGS estimation restricted to only the bacteria in the sample, we calculate a domain-specific marker gene density xbacteria, by dividing the number of hits to marker gene OGs (n) by
the number of hits to any OG (ntotal), with the limitation that
an OG mapping is only counted if the best BLAST hit of that
read region to STRING is a bacterial protein. In this way, only
reads of bacterial origin are considered. Because marker gene
density is now estimated per read rather than per base pair,
this measure requires a new calibration analogous to the one
described above. Again, we found Eqn 1 to be the best fitting
simple formula for simulated data (R2 = 0.93), with parameter estimates a = 0.0389, b = 0.81, and c = 0.78 from a
weighted fit to a training dataset consisting of data for half of
the included genomes.

The same data were used as in the report by Foerstner and
coworkers [32], with the exception of the Sargasso Sea data,
where now all samples were used. Reads were trimmed as
described above. Additional data file 10 gives an overview of
sequence data after trimming.

First, a species S was randomly picked from the pool of completely sequenced genomes. Second, a random number j of
read lengths (with 1 <j ≤ 4) were picked. Third, a 'large'
metagenome was randomly generated (total sequence about
40 Escherichia coli K12 sized genomes), consisting only of
species S (with genome size s). Fourth, genome size is predicted, as described in the main text (Eqn 1). Fifth, errors e
are calculated using the following equation:

Before comparing bacterial EGS estimates across environments, we first confirmed that there were no significant differences among the three whalefall samples and among the
six Sargasso Sea samples (excluding sample 1), by calculating
a z score and P value (Additional data file 1; all pairwise raw P
> 0.05). We then pooled all whalefall samples, and separately
all Sargasso Sea samples, to reduce the total number of comparisons to be made. Statistical significance of differences in
EGS was then estimated by calculating z score and P value in
all remaining pairwise comparisons, and correcting the
resulting raw P values for multiple comparisons [48].

files 5 and 6). Comparison with real reads, as above, revealed
an average bias of 5.2%, which lead to adjusted parameter values of a = 0.0370 and b = 0.770. After correction, we found an
unsigned median error of 8.0% (SD 14.6%). An analogous
procedure was also performed to estimate EGS restricted to
archaeal genomes in the sample. However, currently only
very few archaea are fully sequenced, and hence there was
insufficient data for a full fit and error estimation. To allow at
least an approximate analysis of the archaeal fraction in the
acid mine drainage sequences (see below), we obtained a
rough measure by scaling Eqn 1 with the bacterial parameter
set to fit simulated data from the available fully sequenced
archaea. This resulted in the parameter estimates a = 0.045,
b = 2.91, and c = 0.78 for archaea (R2 = 0.87). Median
unsigned error on the simulated data was 14.7% and the SD
was 15.8%.
