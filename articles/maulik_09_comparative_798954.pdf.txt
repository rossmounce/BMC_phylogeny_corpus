Abstract
Background: The PolyGalacturonase-Inhibiting Proteins (PGIP) of plant cell wall limit the invasion of
phytopathogenic organisms by interacting with the enzyme PolyGalacturonase (PG) they secrete to
degrade pectin present in the cell walls. PGIPs from different or same plant differ in their inhibitory activity
towards the same PG. PGIP2 from Phaseolus vulgaris (Pv) inhibits the PG from Fusarium moniliforme (Fm)
although PGIP1, another member of the multigene family from the same plant sharing 99% sequence
similarity, cannot. Interestingly, PGIP3 from Glycine max (Gm) which is a homologue of PGIP2 is capable of
inhibiting the same PG although the extent of similarity is lower and is 88%. It therefore appears that
subtle changes in the sequence of plant PGIPs give rise to different specificity for inhibiting pathogenic PGs
and there exists no direct dependence of function on the extent of sequence similarity.
Results: Structural information for any PGIP-PG complex being absent, we resorted to molecular
modelling to gain insight into the mechanism of recognition and discrimination of PGs by PGIPs.
We have built homology models of PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 using the crystal structure of PvPGIP2
(1OGQ) as template. These PGIPs were then docked individually to FmPG to elucidate the
characteristics of their interactions. The mode of binding for PvPGIP1 to FmPG considerably differs
from the mode observed for PvPGIP2-FmPG complex, regardless of the high sequence similarity the
two PGIPs share. Both PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 despite being relatively less similar, interact with
residues of FmPG that are known from mutational studies to constitute the active site of the
enzyme. PvPGIP1 tends to interact with residues not located at the active site of FmPG. Looking
into the electrostatic potential surface for individual PGIPs, it was evident that a portion of the
interacting surface for PvPGIP1 differs from the corresponding region of PvPGIP2 or GmPGIP3.
Conclusion: van der Waals and eletrostatic interactions play an active role in PGIPs for proper
recognition and discrimination of PGs. Docking studies reveal that PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 interact
with the residues constituting the active site of FmPG with implications that the proteins bind/block
FmPG at its active site and thereby inhibit the enzyme.

Background
Plants are under constant threat of infections caused by
pathogens that range from viruses, bacteria, fungi to
nematodes and insects. The efficacy of plant defense
depends on its ability to recognize a pathogen and mount
the appropriate defense response. Plants often employ
cell surface and intracellular receptors to detect a
pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and
trigger immune response against the invader. PolyGalacturonase-Inhibiting Protein (PGIP) is one among the
pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins that is found at the
cell surface of plant cells. It binds and inhibits the enzyme
PolyGalacturonase (PG) from the invading pathogen
which could be fungus, insect or bacterium, thus
preventing its colonization in the host cell and hence
the progress of the disease [1,2]. PolyGalacturonases (PG)
are a class of pectinolytic enzyme secreted by the
pathogen at the early stages of infection to depolymerize
homogalacturonan (HGA), the main component of
pectin in the plant cell wall [3]. HGA is the 1, 4 linked
alpha-D-galactosyluronic acid polymer found in the plant
cell which forms the first line of barrier and thereby plays
a critical role in controlling pathogen invasion [4-7].
The interaction of the plant protein PGIP with the fungal
or insect PG limits the destructive potential of the PG
and leads to the accumulation of elicitor active oligogalacturonides as shown by in vitro studies [8]. Hence
PGIP seems to exert a dual role during fungal attack. It
limits pathogen penetration and tissue colonization by
inhibiting PG activity, this in turn, favours the accumulation of oligogalacturonides, which activate a prompt
defense response [9].
PGIPs belong to the Leucine-rich Repeat (LRR) super
family of proteins [10] containing tandem repeats of a
20-30 amino acid stretch of the extracytoplasmic type
with a consensus that bear a conserved part
[LxxLxLxxNxL or LxxLxLxxCxxL (L = I, L, V, F; N = N, T,
S, C; C = C, S; x = any amino acid)] and a variable part
[11,12]. The LRR-fold (Figure 1) which is believed to be
specialized in protein-protein interaction is quite extensively used for the immune functions and for the
recognition of non-self molecules by plants. The crystal
structure of the only PGIP (PGIP2 from Phaseolus
vulgaris) as well as the first LRR protein belonging to
the plant-specific subfamily [13] ([ILVF]xx[ILVF]xx[ILVF]
x[ILVF]xx[NTSC]x[ILVF] [TS]GxIPxx[ILVF]Gx) reveals a
typical curved and elongated shape. Eight b strands (with
one long b strand, B1, at the N-terminal end) comprise
the inner concave face of the curved surface. On the
opposite side of the b sheet, there are nine 310 helices
that are almost parallel to the b sheet. The concave
surface is known to bear residues necessary for binding
and recognition specificity in this class of protein [14].

Figure 1
Ribbon representation of Crystal structure of
PvPGIP2 (1OGQ). The protein is composed of tandemly
repeating units called LRRs. The N-terminal and C-terminal
cysteine-rich domains are shown in green. Three structural
elements characterize this fold. The b-sheet B1 occupies the
concave face of the scaffold (blue), a regular array of 310
helices characterizes the convex face (red), and a second
non-regular b-sheet (B2; cyan) is found between the two
faces.

PGIPs function as very specific inhibitors [15]. PGIP
from a particular plant that is able to inhibit the PG from
a certain pathogen might not be able to inhibit PGs from
other pathogens. Besides, for cases when a PGIP is able
to inhibit PGs from different pathogens, the percent
inhibition differs. Thus in plants, small gene families
encode PGIP isoforms that differ in affinity and

specificity for PGs secreted by different pathogens [1].
Recognition specificity results from a few variations in
the amino acid sequence of the PGIPs [16]. Plants
successfully defend themselves from the attack of a wide
range of PGs from pathogenic microorganisms through
the role played by protein-protein interaction involving
these PGIP proteins.
Significant contributions have been made with experimental studies on the different isoforms of PGIP from a
variety of plants. It has been seen that the overexpression
of two PGIP genes, Atpgip1 and Atpgip2 genes from
Arabidopsis thaliana limits the colonization by B. cinerea
and also reduces the disease symptoms [17]. In
transgenic tomato and grapevine plants, a significant
increase of PG-inhibitory activity and a decrease in
susceptibility to B. cinerea have been observed. Plant
resistance have been successfully enhanced by the
overexpression of pear PGIP in tomato [18] and Vitis
vinifera [19], and also bean PGIP in tobacco [20].
Accumulation of information on several of the properties exhibited by PGIPs have generated an interest in
exploiting them as tools for enhancing plant resistance.
In this regard, PGIPs of bean plant (Phaseolus vulgaris)
needs special mention.
Bean PGIPs are encoded by a family of genes [21], the
products of which are PvPGIP1, PvPGIP2, PvPGIP3 and
PvPGIP4. All of these show distinct regulation and
specificity exhibiting different inhibitory capabilities
against the PGs of Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Stenocarpella maydis, Fusarium moniliforme and
Aspergillus niger [21]. The four mature products of the
pgip genes have a very high extent of sequence similarity
differing between 8 to 81 amino acids. Phylogenetic
analysis indicates that Pvpgip1-Pvpgip2 groups with
Gmpgip3 of soybean (Glycine max), a species of the
Phaseoleae tribe close to bean, which suggests that these
two genes are probably closer to the ancestral gene than
are Pvpgip3 and Pvpgip4 [7]. Interestingly, although
PGIP1 and PGIP2 from Phaseolus vulgaris share 99%
sequence similarity, PvPGIP2 has been reported to
inhibit PG from Fusarium moniliforme (Fm) while
PvPGIP1 does not [16]. Strikingly, GmPGIP3 of soybean
(Glycine max), shares a much lesser similarity of 88%
with PvPGIP2 and yet has the ability to inhibit FmPG
with an inhibition kinetics similar to that of PvPGIP2
[22]. It is thus evident that the ability of PGIP molecules
to defend plants against infection is not buried in the
extent of similarity shared between the sequences alone.
Probable implications could be the presence of key
structural features important for the necessary proteinprotein interaction that need to be conserved to preserve
the function.

It would be interesting to study the molecular interaction
of different PGIPs sharing different range of sequence
variation, with the same PG molecule to elucidate the
relation between the extent of sequence similarity and
the corresponding ability/inability to inhibit PG. Three
PGIPs, PvPGIP1 and PvPGIP2 from Phaseolus vulgaris and
GmPGIP3 from Glycine max have been chosen for this
purpose keeping in mind that they share a high level of
sequence similarity and yet show distinct difference in
their function as expressed through their ability/inability
to inhibit the same PG from Fusarium moniliforme
(FmPG). In this study, homology models of two PGIP
molecules namely PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 have been
built using the crystal structure of PvPGIP2 as the
template. The crystal structure of FmPG being available,
the three PGIPs have been subsequently docked to
FmPG. In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying
and the strategy undertaken by the plants in utilizing the
different isoforms of PGIP, a comparative study of the
interaction between these three pairs namely PvPGIP1
and FmPG, PvPGIP2 and FmPG and GmPGIP3 and FmPG
have been accomplished. A comparison of the binding
modes, the interacting residues and the electrostatic
potential surface along the interface of the PGIP-PG
complex have been investigated. Change in intermolecular distances, hydrogen bond formation and electrostatic surface potential upon in silico mutation of
PvPGIP2 have also been explored.

Results and discussion
Sequence analysis
Domain search
Domain search using Pfam [23] discloses that the three
PGIP molecules (two from P. vulgaris and one from G.
max) studied here share identical domain architecture
consisting of one LRR_NT2 (a domain found specifically
at the N terminal ends of leucine-rich repeat proteins) at
the N-terminal end and nine leucine-rich repeats (R1R9) (Figure 2). Out of the nine LRRs, four have been
identified as plant-specific (PS) LRRs (R3-R5, R9) using
EMBOSS [24] with the pattern [ILVF]xx[ILVF]xx[ILVF]x
[ILVF]xx[NTSC]x[ILVF] [TS]GxIPxx[ILVF]Gx.
Pairwise alignment
Pairwise alignment carried out in order to identify
similarities between the PGIP molecules at the sequence
level, shows only eight varying residue positions
between PvPGIP1 and PvPGIP2 (shown by the vertical
bars in Figure 2A) and 34 varying positions between
PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 (shown in Figure 2C). Four out
of the eight variations between PvPGIP1 and PvPGIP2
fall in the repeat regions and the rest reside in the nonLRR (intervening region between two repeats) region of

Figure 2
Domain architecture (DA) of the three PGIP molecules. A, B & C show the DA of PvPGIP1, PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3
respectively. Domains in all the three proteins are arranged as one LRR_NT2 domain followed by nine leucine-rich repeats
(R1-R9). The domains are shown by rectangular boxes. Out of the nine LRRs, four have been marked as plant-specific (PS)
LRRs (R3-R5, R9). The vertical bars in A and C denote the sequence variations with PvPGIP2 and the numbers stand for the
residue number. The types of vertical bars change with the position of the varying residue, an information obtained from the
multiple sequence alignments shown in Figure 3. Plain vertical bars stand for changes that are found in the LRR_NT2 region,
the black and grey bars signify residue positions belonging to the conserved region and the variable region of LRRs respectively,
while the hatched bars are for those in the non-LRR region.

the proteins. Two (R5 and R9) out of the four PS-LRRs
and the first (R1) and the sixth (R6) repeat harbour these
four variations mentioned above. The 34 variations
between PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 on the other hand, are
divided amongst all domains including LRRNT_2 and all
the plant specific LRRs (Figure 2C).

Distribution of the variations in the domains
Out of the 34 residues that differ in GmPGIP3 from
PvPGIP2 only two changes (Position 297 and 311 in
Figure 1) are common with the 8 differing residues
between PvPGIP1 and PvPGIP2 leaving the rest 32
variations to be at unique positions. 27 out of these 34
fall in the LRR regions and 2 in the LRRNT_2 region
leaving altogether 5 positions to remain scattered in the
intervening non-LRR regions. The sequence variation
that fall in the LRR region in PvPGIP1(4) and GmPGIP3
(27) with PvPGIP2 could be distributed amongst the
conserved portion of the repeat or the variable portion of
it. It becomes an important task to determine this, as
there are positions in the repeats where sequence

variation is accepted without an associated change in
structure. To account for the distribution of these
variations with respect to different regions in the repeats,
we constructed individual multiple sequence alignments.
Figure 3 shows the multiple sequence alignment of nine
repeats each from PvPGIP1, PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3. The
conserved region of the repeats are marked by the
conserved pattern of LRRs (written below each alignment) while the rest of the repeat signify its variable
region. Considering an insertion of a residue (G) in R2
for PvPGIP1 and PvPGIP2 and an insertion of P in R2 of
GmPGIP3 at another position, the variations (marked by
black rectangles for those between PvPGIP2 and PvPGIP1
and grey rectangles for those between PvPGIP2 and
GmPGIP3) can be rightly explained to be concentrated in
positions (mostly X or variable region) where the motif
itself has the provision for changes. The details of the
distribution of the variations (8 for PvPGIP1 and 34 for
GmPGIP3) in the LRR (conserved (c) and variable (v)
region) and the non-LRR regions with reference to the
residue type is tabulated in the Additional file 1.
Depending on whether the variation is in the conserved

are either an allowed variant of the conserved position
(L or C or N) or is any amino acid in the X position of the
conserved region or is an amino acid belonging to
the variable region of the repeat (grey bars). One
exception is the variation in the conserved position N of
R1 in PvPGIP1 (Figure 3A) where the replacing amino
acid H is not an allowed variant. Regarding the variations
in the non-LRR region, Additional file 1 points out that
whereas PvPGIP1 and PvPGIP2 share 50% of the changes
in this region, GmPGIP3 and PvPGIP2 show only 15% of
it. This could probably indicate specific regions of
importance in PGIPs for the introduction of variation
for recognition of different enzymes from pathogens.
Modelling
The crystal structure of PvPGIP2 (1OGQ) being available
and also since PvPGIP1 and PvPGIP2 as well as PvPGIP2
and GmPGIP3 share high percentage of sequence
similarity, homology models of PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3
were built using PvPGIP2 as template. One model each
for PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 were selected using PROCHECK [25]. In each case, the model that was chosen
supported the following criteria:

(i) more number of residues in the core region
(ii) no residues in the disallowed region
These models of PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 were solvated in
water and were subjected to energy minimization
followed by molecular dynamics simulation of 1 ns.
A similar scheme of equilibration was taken up for the
crystal structure of PvPGIP2. RMSD of the equilibrated
structures of PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 were calculated
with respect to the equilibrated structure of PvPGIP2 and
was found to be 1.45Ã and 1.66Ã respectively.

nine repeats of the PGIP molecules. A, B and C show

or variable part of the repeat or in the non-LRR region,
black, grey and hatched vertical bars are respectively used
in Figure 2A and 2C. In both these proteins (PvPGIP1 and
GmPGIP3 that share a similarity of 87%), most of the
changes that fall in the LRR region (black bars in Figure 2)

Docking
We used GRAMM-X [26] for docking three pairs of
proteins in order to unveil the mode of interaction
within and across each pair. This docking program
executes a rigid-body search using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) correlation with simplified geometry employing
shape complementarity and hydrophobicity in the
scoring function. In this study we have used GRAMM-X
as a protein-protein docking program as it extends the
GRAMM Fast Fourier Transformation methodology by
applying smoothed Lennard-Jones potential, refinement
stage and knowledge-based scoring, thus giving rise to
best surface match. The output of GRAMM-X is a PDB
file containing the structures of ten models ranked as the
most probable prediction candidate, according to the
scoring function used. The cell-wall degrading enzyme
PG, from the fungus Fusarium moniliforme was common

in all the pairs and the other three molecules include
PvPGIP1, PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3. The crystal structure of
FmPG (1HG8) used in this study had also been solvated
in water and was then subjected to energy minimization
followed by molecular dynamics (MD) of 1 ns.
Docking studies of FmPG-PvPGIP2
It has been reported that since PvPGIP2 inhibits FmPG,
hence one would expect PvPGIP2 to interact with PG by
blocking the active site and/or the substrate binding cleft
of the fungal enzyme. We obtained top scoring ten
docked complexes of PvPGIP2-FmPG from GRAMM-X.
One model in the exact expected orientation was selected
on the basis of the existing experimental studies (see
below). In the docked complex (Figure 4A), PvPGIP2 has
covered the active site cleft by hindering the substrate
binding site of FmPG. This is evident from the change
in Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) (shown in
Table 1) for the residues Asp-167, Asp-188, Asp-189,
Arg-243, and Lys-245 of FmPG that are known to be
located inside the deep cleft and form the putative active
site [27]. Functional studies confirm the involvement of
these residues in the enzymatic reaction mechanism
and or binding to the substrate which is in agreement
with the reported mode of competitive inhibition with
FmPG [27].

In this model structure, the residues of PvPGIP2 that is
known to be functionally important, have shown
considerable change in SASA (Table 1), indicating that
they play a key role in interaction. Four residues [V
(152), S(178), Q(224) and H(271)] out of five that
were identified by Leckie et al. [16] as interacting
residues of PvPGIP2 are expected to reside in the
interacting surface of PvPGIP2 in the PvPGIP2-FmPG
complex, inferred on the basis of the considerable
change in SASA (Table 1).

Figure 4
Docked complexes of PGIP (ribbon representation in
blue) and FmPG (space-filling representation in red).
A and C show how PvPGIP2 (blue) and GmPGIP3 (blue)
respectively, hinder the substrate binding site and block the
active site cleft of FmPG (red). The only model of the
PvPGIP1-FmPG complex where PvPGIP1 (blue) docks near
the active site of FmPG (red) although not blocking it unlike
the other two complexes, is shown in B. The marked area
shown by the yellow ellipse in B indicates the portion of
FmPG that PvPGIP1 has been unable to block.

Docking studies of FmPG-PvPGIP1
Out of the ten potential candidates for models of
PvPGIP1-FmPG complex obtained from GRAMM-X,
only in one model PvPGIP1 docked to the same face of
FmPG as was found in the model for the complex of
PvPGIP2-FmPG (Figure 4B). In the rest of the nine
models, the PGIP molecule docked to a different face of
FmPG indicating a gross inability of these models of
PvPGIP1 to block either the substrate binding site or the
active site of FmPG. In the selected model, whereas the
portion marked with the yellow ellipse is evidently seen
to be blocked in the other two complexes, the same is
not the case with PvPGIP1. This is in complete agreement
with the experimental observation of PvPGIP1 being
incapable of inhibiting the PG from Fusarium moniliforme. This model in which FmPG docks to PvPGIP1 at

the face similar to the one in PvPGIP2 (Figure 4B) of the
PvPGIP2-FmPG complex, is considered for further
studies to confirm the inability of the protein in
inhibition towards the enzyme.
Docking studies of FmPG-GmPGIP3
It has been reported that GmPGIP3 possesses an
inhibiting activity towards the PG of Fusarium moniliforme like PvPGIP2. No mutational studies being
available for GmPGIP3, the docked structure of the
GmPGIP3-FmPG complex was therefore selected from
the top scoring ten models reported by GRAMM-X using
the knowledge obtained from experimental studies
carried out for PvPGIP2. In the selected model of the
complex (Figure 4C), GmPGIP3 has blocked the active
site cleft of FmPG. The docked model therefore is in
agreement with the experimental observation of the

ability of GmPGIP3 in inhibiting the enzymatic activity
of FmPG. The important residues V(152), S(178), Q
(224) and H(271) of GmPGIP3 that are also present in
PvPGIP2 show considerable decrease in solvent accessible surface area (Table 1) indicating their active
involvement in protein-protein interaction, an identical
observation that holds true for PvPGIP2. Thus like
PvPGIP2, GmPGIP3 too blocks the active site cleft and
hinders the substrate binding site of FmPG bearing a
similar mode of competitive inhibition.
Comparative study of protein-protein interactions in
the three complexes
Ionic interactions
We have used PIC [28] for comparison of interactions
recognized in the three complexes. Ionic interaction that
is believed to play an important role in protein-protein

interactions were studied for the three complexes namely
PvPGIP2-FmPG, PvPGIP1-FmPG and GmPGIP3-FmPG.
Table 2 shows that whereas this kind of interaction plays
a vital role both in PvPGIP2-FmPG and GmPGIP3-FmPG
complexes, it is not so for the PvPGIP1-FmPG complex.
Electrostatic surface potential of individual PGIPs
and the complexes
Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) package [29]
was used to generate the electrostatic surface potential
for each of PvPGIP1, PvPGIP2, GmPGIP3 and FmPG, as
shown in Figure 5A, B, C and 5D respectively. It is
evidently clear that the electrostatic surface potential for
PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 (Figure 5B &5C) show similarity
along the surface at the concave face which is the site for
interaction with FmPG. PvPGIP1 shows a distinctly
different potential surface at a region in this face, even
though it bears very few variations at the sequence level
when compared to PvPGIP2.

Figure 6 shows the electrostatic potential surface and the
mode of binding for the three complexes namely
PvPGIP1-FmPG (Figure 6A), PvPGIP2-FmPG (Figure 6B)
and GmPGIP3-FmPG (Figure 6C). The potential surface
of the complex in PvPGIP1-FmPG is undoubtedly
dissimilar from the other two complexes and so is the
mode of binding. Interestingly, the mode of binding of
GmPGIP3 with FmPG very much resembles that of
PvPGIP2 and FmPG although the sequence variation
between the two PGIPs is significant.
In silico mutation of PvPGIP2 and
PvPGIP2-FmPG complex
PvPGIP2 was mutated at six positions, with the amino
acid present in PvPGIP1 at that position, using WHAT IF
[30]. Electrostatic surface potential was generated for all
the six mutated PvPGIP2 molecules. The surface drawn
with the Q224K mutation showed considerable change
from the wild type protein (Additional file 2). The other
single mutations did not show much of a significant

change in the electrostatic surface potential. It may be
mentioned that when these mutated PvPGIP2 molecules
were docked to FmPG, none of the complexes showed
any resemblance to the conformation found for the
PvPGIP1-FmPG complex, shown in Figure 6A.
When in the PvPGIP2-FmPG complex, Q (224) of
PvPGIP2 was mutated to K, using WHAT IF, the resultant
complex showed quite a few of the following deviations
from the complex with the wild type protein. Hard
sphere contact distances [31] between heavy atoms
revealed an existence of steric clash between the NÎ¶ of
Q224K of the mutated PvPGIP2 and CÎµ of K(300) of
FmPG. Whereas the contact distance between the atoms

obtained from PIC results. Even the ionic interaction
that prevails in the wild type complex of PvPGIP2-FmPG
vanishes with this single mutation. The in silico mutation
study, confirms the importance of the Q(224) residue
which has been experimentally found to give rise to a
70% reduction in the inhibition ability of the protein
upon single mutation. The study also suggests probable
reasons like a different electrostatic potential surface,
steric clash or lack of hydrogen bonds that might explain
why PvPGIP1 with only eight residues has a different
mode of binding to FmPG.

should be more than 2.52 Ã, the distance in the complex
with mutation was 2.47 Ã. The complex bearing the
mutation also showed the absence of the predicted
hydrogen bond involving Q(224) of PvPGIP2 as

The above in silico study clearly portrays how a single
mutation in PvPGIP2 results in disallowed hard sphere
contact distances between the two protein molecules
thus indicating the importance of van der Waals
interaction in plant defense. Q at the 224th position
which is also involved in forming hydrogen bonds, plays
a substantial role in this interaction. Since GRAMM-X
shows that the mode of binding of PvPGIP1 with FmPG
is different from PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 and further
more since GRAMM-X has a major involvement of
smoothed Lennard-Jones potential in scoring, we infer
that the discrimination in recognition has a significant
contribution from van der Waals interaction. Role of van
der Waals forces have already been shown to be
important in offering stability to several protein-ligand
and in some cases DNA-ligand complexes prevailing in
biological systems. Molecular Dynamics studies have
shown van der Waals interaction to play a vital role in
groove binding of the repressor fragment of a bacteriophage to its operator oligonucleotide [32]. In a study
with proteins, it has been shown that the mouse major
urinary protein (MUP) and its ligand show a binding
thermodynamics that is dominated by dispersion interactions [33]. The involvement of the van der Waals forces
in plant defense although not in specific recognition has
also been reported. Many plants respond to pathogenic
attack by producing defense proteins that bind to chitin,
a polysaccharide present in the cell wall of the invading
fungus or exoskeleton of infecting insects. NMR studies
show the involvement of van der Waals interactions
between the methyl acetamide group of the GlcNAc unit
and a hydrophobic patch of the plant protein [34].
Studies on the characteristics of the sugar-binding sites in
plant and animal lectin show van der Waals interaction
and hydrogen bonds to contribute significantly. Selectivity for different sugars result from hydrogen bonds
and unwanted recognition is prevented by steric exclusion [35]. Here in the case of plant defense through
PGIP, the influence of van der Waals interaction therefore does not seem to be atypical.
In the present study, we have failed to address pertinent
components like the change in the binding free energy

change (ÎÎG) between the wild type and the mutated
PGIPs. In order to obtain experimentally relevant information concerning the thermodynamic properties of binding,
we wish to work in future, with advanced simulation
methods such as free energy perturbation or thermodynamic integration to assess the binding free energy changes
upon mutation of the important residues in PGIP.

Conclusion
It has been noted from our study on sequence analysis
that 50% of the sequence variation between PvPGIP1
and PvPGIP2 fall in the non-LRR region whereas only
15% of the variation in GmPGIP3 with PvPGIP2 fall in
the non-LRR region. This observation suggests specific
regions in PGIPs favourable for the introduction of
variation in recognition of the pathogen molecules.
Structural studies involving docking techniques suggest
the mode of binding of the fungal enzyme FmPG by
PGIP2 from Phaseolus vulgaris to be similar to that of its
homologue PGIP3 from Glycine max. In each case of
binding, the active site of the enzyme from Fusarium
moniliforme is being blocked by the PGIP molecule,
supporting the experimentally observed phenomenon of
these PGIP molecules being able to inhibit the fungal
enzyme upon invasion. PGIP1 from the same plant
Phaseolus vulgaris which is incapable of inhibiting FmPG,
binds to FmPG in an evidently different mode, although
PvPGIP1 and PvPGIP2 share a higher degree of sequence
similarity compared to PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3. Electrostatic surface potential reveals considerable difference in
the interacting surface of PvPGIP1 when compared to
PvPGIP2 or GmPGIP3. Thus, electrostatic and van der
Waals interactions may play a significant role in PGIPs
for proper recognition and discrimination of PGs.

Method
Sequence analysis
The sequences of the three PGIPs, namely PvPGIP1,
PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 were retrieved from NCBI. We
used the Pfam domain search program [23] to determine
the domain architecture of these proteins. The plant
specific Leucine-rich Repeats (PS_LRR) in the proteins
were identified by the program PATMATDB of EMBOSS
[24] using the pattern [ILVF]xx[ILVF]xx[ILVF]x [ILVF]xx
[NTSC]x [ILVF] [TS]GxIPxx[ILVF]Gx as a regular expression. Pairwise alignments, one between PvPGIP1 and
PvPGIP2 and another between GmPGIP3 and PvPGIP2
were carried out by the program NEEDLE of EMBOSS.
All the nine repeats identified by Pfam were aligned by
CLUSTALW [36] for the three proteins, individually.
Modelling
Homology models of PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 were
generated using MODELLER 9v4 [37] by satisfying the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S19

spatial restraints, based on the homology they share with
the protein PvPGIP2 (PDB Id: 1OGQ). The best model
was selected using PROCHECK [25] based on steric
correctness. Energy minimization was performed for all
the structures that were involved in our studies, with the
help of GROMACS 3.3.3 [38,39].
The four protein molecules namely, the models of
PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 and the crystal structure of
PvPGIP2 and the fungal enzyme FmPG (PDB Id: 1HG8)
were embedded in a box of simple point charge water
molecules with 1 nm separation between the box
boundary and the solute. Energy minimization of
solvent with the solute fixed was carried out with 500
steps of steepest descent followed by 2000 steps of
conjugate gradient algorithm. After that the constraint on
the solute was released and energy minimization of the
whole system was carried out again with 500 steps of
steepest descent followed by 2000 steps of conjugate
gradient algorithm. The resulting structures were subjected to 1 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
in GROMACS at 300 K. For all the simulations
GROMOS96 43a1 force field was used.
The model structures of PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 have
been deposited to PMDB Protein Model Database http://
mi.caspur.it/PMDB/ with the PMDB identifier of
PM0075783 and PM0075784 respectively.

Docking studies
We have used GRAMM-X Protein Docking Web Server
v.1.2.0 [26] for docking the three PGIP molecules to PG
taken one at a time. The output PDB file that GRAMM-X
produces contains 10 models ranked as the most
probable prediction candidates according to the scoring
function used by the program. The PGIPs acted as
receptors while the PG acted as ligand in this study of
protein-protein interaction. To select a model out of the
ten top scoring docked complexes that GRAMM-X
reported, we studied the associated change in Solvent
Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of the amino acid
residues in the individual molecules and when they are
in the complex. We used the g_sas program in
GROMACS to estimate the change in SASA for the
individual residues of the proteins.

Mutation prediction studies
We have used mutation prediction tool [40] of the
WHAT IF [30] web interface to mutate Q (224) of
PvPGIP2 to K in the PvPGIP2-FmPG complex. The same
mutation (Q224K) and five others that differ in
PvPGIP1 were carried out on PvPGIP2 by using the
same server.

Electrostatic surface potential
Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) is a software
package for the numerical solution of the PoissonBoltzmann equation (PBE), one of the most popular
continuum models for describing electrostatic interactions between molecular solutes in salty, aqueous media.
The colour coded electrostatic surface potential was
drawn using the APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann
Solver) package [29] within PYMOL 0.99rc6 [41] for the
three PGIP molecules, the PG molecule and the three
complexes. Electrostatic surface potential was also
generated for a model where a single mutation was
carried out on PvPGIP2 (Q224K) by WHAT IF [30,40]
using the APBS package [29].
