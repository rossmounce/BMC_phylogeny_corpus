Abstract
Background: The xylem-inhabiting bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is the causal agent of Pierce's disease (PD) in
vineyards and citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) in orange trees. Both of these economically-devastating diseases are
caused by distinct strains of this complex group of microorganisms, which has motivated researchers to conduct
extensive genomic sequencing projects with Xf strains. This sequence information, along with other molecular tools, have
been used to estimate the evolutionary history of the group and provide clues to understand the capacity of Xf to infect
different hosts, causing a variety of symptoms. Nonetheless, although significant amounts of information have been
generated from Xf strains, a large proportion of these efforts has concentrated on the study of North American strains,
limiting our understanding about the genomic composition of South American strains – which is particularly important
for CVC-associated strains.
Results: This paper describes the first genome-wide comparison among South American Xf strains, involving 6 distinct
citrus-associated bacteria. Comparative analyses performed through a microarray-based approach allowed identification
and characterization of large mobile genetic elements that seem to be exclusive to South American strains. Moreover, a
large-scale sequencing effort, based on Suppressive Subtraction Hybridization (SSH), identified 290 new ORFs,
distributed in 135 Groups of Orthologous Elements, throughout the genomes of these bacteria.
Conclusion: Results from microarray-based comparisons provide further evidence concerning activity of horizontally
transferred elements, reinforcing their importance as major mediators in the evolution of Xf. Moreover, the microarraybased genomic profiles showed similarity between Xf strains 9a5c and Fb7, which is unexpected, given the geographical
and chronological differences associated with the isolation of these microorganisms. The newly identified ORFs, obtained
by SSH, represent an approximately 10% increase in our current knowledge of the South American Xf gene pool and
include new putative virulence factors, as well as novel potential markers for strain identification. Surprisingly, this list of
novel elements include sequences previously believed to be unique to North American strains, pointing to the necessity
of revising the list of specific markers that may be used for identification of distinct Xf strains.

Background
The xylem-inhabiting bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf)
[1,2] has emerged, during the past decades, as an important phytopathogen, specially due to its implication with
the development of Pierce's disease (PD) in North American vineyards and citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC),
which affects orange trees in South America. PD was first
detected in Southern California in 1884, when it
destroyed approximately 40,000 acres of grapes in Anaheim, CA, during a 5-year outbreak of the disease
(reviewed in [3]). After this devastating experience, PD
remained as a minor concern to the West Coast viticulture
for decades until the mid-1990s, when a new insect species, the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) Homalodisca
vitripennis was accidentally introduced into Southern California and begun spreading northward. This leafhopper,
which can serve as a vector to Xf, has the capacity to feed
in more than 70 different plant species and survive winter
temperatures dropping as low as 20°F [4]. Moreover,
unlike other Xf-carrying insects associated with PD in California, GWSS has a much broader flight range (up to a
quarter mile), posing a very serious threat to the wine
industry from Southern and Central California [5].
Indeed, since the first identification of GWSS in the California vineyards, programs aimed at controlling the dissemination of this insect as a strategy to prevent PD
outbreaks have involved more than US$ 160 million of
direct investments [6].
Citrus variegated chlorosis, on the other hand, was originally identified in Brazil in 1987, during an outbreak that
affected orange orchards distributed along the Northern
and Northwestern regions of State of São Paulo [7], one of
the most important areas of citrus production in this
country, which turns out to be one of the world's leading
producers of concentrated orange juice (reviewed in [8]).
Since its initial observation, the disease incidence
increased by graft propagation of Xf-infected budwood
and by the action of many different sharpshooter vectors,
becoming widely distributed across all citrus-growing
regions in the country, where it is held responsible for
damages that may reach US$ 280 – 320 million per year
[9] (see also [10] for recent statistics about CVC in Brazil).
Different Xf strains have also been obtained from alternative host plants across the Americas and, in many cases,
there seems to be a direct correlation between Xf infection
and the development of diseases [11]. Thus, Xf strains are
also believed to be responsible for phony peach disease
(PP), alfalfa dwarf disease, periwinkle wilt and leaf scorch
diseases in plum, elm, maple, oak, sycamore and coffee
[12,13]. Up to now, none of these diseases has demonstrated to be as economically damaging as either PD or
CVC. Nonetheless, Xf is already considered a major agronomical concern in the American continent, given the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/474

economic losses already experienced by both citrus and
winegrape industries, as well as the widespread distribution of Xf strains in so many economically important
crops. Thus, this microorganism has been the subject of
increasing attention by many research programs after the
mid 1990's [14] and, as a consequence of these efforts,
one Xf strain (9a5c), associated with CVC in Brazil, turned
out to be the first plant bacterium to have its complete
genome sequenced and annotated [15]. Moreover, the
existence of different disease symptoms, observed in a
wide range of plant hosts [16] and associated with genetically distinct Xf strains, has led researchers to hypothesize
that total genome comparisons among these bacteria
could help to uncover information regarding genes
involved in the interaction with specific hosts and disease
development [17]. Thus, sequencing efforts have been
extended to other Xf strains and subsequently, the
genomes of two other strains (Ann-1 and Dixon),
obtained from oleander and almond trees had their
genomes partially sequenced and annotated [18]. Finally,
a fourth strain, Temecula-1, isolated from grapevines and
responsible for PD in California has also been sequenced
to completion [19]. Thus, Xf is one of the best models
available to conduct functional and comparative genomic
studies.
Genomic sequences from these Xf strains have been submitted to extensive in silico evaluations, allowing the formulation of virtual metabolomes that provided a
comprehensive view of the major biochemical processes
that occur in these microorganisms [15]. Additional information regarding the functionality of different gene products and pathogenicity mechanisms in Xf have also been
obtained by the evaluation of differential gene expression
through microarray hybridization approaches and by the
generation of gene-knockout mutants [20,21], while
genomic comparisons conducted with these four strains
allowed the identification and categorization of genomewide DNA variations, as well as their influence on strain
functional divergence [22]. Multiple alignment of chromosomal sequences identified SNPs and INDELs that
could be used to estimate the relative similarity between
the strains and the rates of genome evolution, which seem
to be different for each individual strain [22]. All unique
genes have been catalogued and, since their sequences
could represent strain-specific markers, primer pairs were
designed against these ORFs to assist in PCR-based detection of these four Xf strains in the wild [22,23].
The genomic information also established a solid base for
the development of epidemiological and phylogenetic
studies within the Xf group, providing evidence that the
bacterial species X. fastidiosa, originally characterized from
25 strains (obtained from 10 different hosts), constitute a
significantly complex group of plant-associated bacteria

[14]. In spite of sharing a considerable amount of both
phenotypic and genotypic similarities, as well as an overall 85% DNA sequence identity, as measured from DNA
homology studies [2], X. fastidiosa strains and strains have
been shown to display significant biological variability,
which was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses involving
sequence comparison of seven chromosomal genes (spanning almost 10 Kb of DNA sequence), sequencing of the
ribosomal intergenic spacer (ITS), serological classification and microarray analyses of their genomic profiles
[14,24-27].
However, all these studies involved a relatively small
number of South American Xf strains, hampering a more
conclusive evaluation about the biogeographical distribution, phylogenetic history, evolution and taxonomic relationships among this group of strains, which have not
been as thoroughly studied as the North American strains.
A similar situation is verified when Xf strains are analyzed
and compared at the genomic level, since three North
American strains have been submitted to genomic
sequencing, as opposed to only one South American
strain. Thus, it is possible that the relative lack of sequence
information from other South American strains may have
introduced biases to some of the conclusions drawn from
recent genomic studies within the group. This situation
prompted us to conduct a comprehensive genomic survey
involving a total of 6 South American Xf strains, all
obtained from infected orange trees [28]. We employed a
microarray-based approach to compare the genomic profiles of these bacteria with Xf strain 9a5c and Suppressive
Subtraction Hybridization (SSH) to identify new genes
present exclusively in the genomes of these microorganisms. The results obtained from such analyses represent
the first genome-wide evaluation regarding genome structure and composition from CVC-associated bacteria, providing additional information about the characteristics of
the South American Xf gene pool and its relationship with
what has been found in North American strains.

Results
Genomic comparisons among Xf-CVC strains through
microarray hybridization analysis
Microarray hybridization has been widely used to undertake genomic comparisons involving a great number of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/474

microorganisms [29] and previous work from our group
has established precise criteria to employ this methodology to the study of Xf strains, with the aid of an Xf 9a5c
biochip [30]. Thus, we performed similar microarraybased comparisons with 6 different Xf strains obtained
from citrus plants (Table 1). Four of these Xf strains (56a,
9.12c, 187b, and 36f) were obtained from CVC-affected
trees and are representatives of the most prevalent Xf haplotypes found in sweet orange orchards across the state of
São Paulo, while Xf strain Cv21 was obtained from a nonsymptomatic tree from the same region [28]. Xf strain
Fb7, on the other hand, was obtained from a sweet orange
tree that displayed symptoms of "Pecosita", a disease similar to CVC that occurs in some citrus-growing regions of
Argentina [31]. The genomic profiles obtained for these 6
strains are depicted in Figure 1, which displays a linear
representation of the Xf strain 9a5c chromosome (from
ORF Xf0001 to Xf2782), followed by ORFs present in
pXf51, the large 51 kb chromosome present in Xf strain
9a5c (from ORF Xfa0001 to Xfa0064). Surprisingly, these
results showed that, contrary to what had been observed
during our former comparisons [26], most genomic differences within the citrus strains are not associated with
deleted ORFs, but with elements that are present in greater
copy number in the tested strains, when compared to Xf
strain 9a5c (see Table 2, and Additional File 1). Nonetheless, we were able to confirm the same distribution pattern
observed before, since most duplicated ORFs are not scattered throughout the genome, but grouped within mobile
genetic elements, such as prophages, Genomic Islands
(GIs) and putative Genomic Islands (pGIs) previously
observed in the genome of Xf strain 9a5c [26].
Details regarding differences in ORF composition,
detected by the microarray hybridizations with all Xf
strains analyzed in this study, can be found in Additional
File 1. As expected, each strain presents a unique genomic
profile, which can be used to characterize all individual
strains with high fidelity, as inferred from the high bootstrap values obtained from the cluster analysis shown in
Figure 1. Interestingly, the Argentine strain, Fb7, seems to
be extremely similar to Xf strain 9a5c, as the genomic differences detected between these two strains are restricted
to a small number of deleted ORFs, distributed along the
main chromosome and plasmid pXf51. All other strains

Chromosomal ORFs are linearly represented, from ORF

5.1 (from ORF Xfa0001 to Xfa0065). ORFs present in the
genome of each tested strain are represented in grey, while
missing ORFs are represented in black. ORFs present in
greater copy number in the genomes of the tested strains are
represented in white [see 26]. The genomic profiles were
used to construct a hierarchical grouping of the strains and
the robustness of the branching profile was verified by bootstrap analysis, using TMEV (the number next to each branch
represents the bootstrap values for 100 permutations). The
location of Genomic Islands (GIs) and putative Genomic
Islands (pGIs) in the genome of Xf strain 9a5c are also shown

display significantly different profiles, characterized not
only by deletions, but also by duplicated ORFs. A strong
similarity is observed in the profiles obtained for Xf
strains 56a and 9.12c, characterized by scattered duplication of ORFs from GI2, and by what seems to be complete
duplications of GI1 and GI5. Several ORFs from prophage
XfP4 and GI4 are also missing in these two strains. Xf
strain Cv21 presents a genomic profile that closely resembles Xf strains 56a and 9.12c, except for the lack of duplications involving ORFs within GI2. Xf strain 36f, on the
other hand, displays another type of profile, in which no
deletions have been detected along the structures of XfP4
and GI4 and the duplicated ORFs scattered across GI1 and
GI5 seem to indicate that duplication of these elements is
not complete. Finally, Xf strain 187b displays the most
divergent genomic profile, characterized by a very large
number of duplicated ORFs and mobile elements. Once
again, duplications seem to span practically the entire
structure of GI1, GI5 and even GI2. Moreover, several
other duplicated regions seem to occur throughout the
genome of Xf strain 187b, pointing to the possible existence of other mobile genetic elements in Xf. Interestingly,
at least three of these regions seem to map within elements that had been previously identified as putative
Genomic Islands (pGIs) [26].
The two largest Xf GIs (GI1 and GI2), which were found
to be deleted in North American strains are present in all
citrus strains analyzed herein and GI1 seems to be completely duplicated in at least four of the tested Xf strains
(187b, 56a, 9.12c and Cv21), as well as in two previously
analyzed citrus Xf strains, X1-B14 and SJ [26], indicating
that this element seems to display intense transpositional
activity among representatives of the Xf group. Interestingly, GI1 seems to be specific to strains obtained from citrus and coffee trees from South America and may
represent a sinapomorphy for the South American Xf
strains [26]. GI5, which is also duplicated in other Xf
strains (56a and 9.12c), displays a region that is similar to
the VapE-containing region of GI1, resembling the situation observed with the Vap elements from the pathogenic
bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus (see below [32]).
Identification of new ORFs in the Xf-CVC gene pool of
citrus-associated Xf strains through Suppressive
Subtraction Hybridization (SSH)
Since the Xf biochip used in the experiments described
above was based on the genome of Xf strain 9a5c, the
hybridization experiments can only provide information
regarding genes that are present in this strain. Thus, to
gather information concerning additional ORFs present
in the gene pool of citrus-associated strains, we employed
Suppressive Subtraction Hybridization (SSH), using DNA
from Xf strain 9a5c as a driver, against DNA from all 6
strains, as described in Methods. Thus, a total of 18 SSH

libraries have been constructed (using three different
restriction enzymes for each strain) and approximately
9,000 clones have been obtained and sequenced from
these libraries (Table 3).
For each of the 6 strains, the sequenced clones have been
trimmed, in order to exclude vector sequences and poor
quality regions (Phred < 20), and aligned with the aid of
CAP3, generating 1,063 contigs, which contained 6,712
sequences overall. These contigs span 217.1 Kb of Xf
sequences, which is equivalent to approximately 7.7% of
the genome of Xf strain 9a5c (Table 4). We chose to conduct further analyses only with contigs composed by at
least 6 different individual sequences and showed size
variation from 400 to 4,500 bp. Thus, a total of 2,534
sequenced clones were excluded from further studies,
since they either remained as singlets or grouped into
small contigs, composed by a limited number of reads (2
in most cases), resulting in poor quality consensus
sequences. Next, the contigs were filtered against the
genome of Xf strain 9a5c with the aid of the software
cross_match [33], allowing the identification of stretches
of DNA that were exclusive to the tested strains. Sequencing of approximately 9,000 SSH clones has allowed the
identification of 111.53 Kb of DNA sequences that are not
present in the genome of Xf strain 9a5c (which represents
~4.1 % of total genome size). The rate at which novel
sequences were identified, as a function of sequenced SSH
clones, has been evaluated as described in Methods, and
judging by the inclination of the curve shown in Figure 2,
a significant proportion of the novel sequences present in
the analyzed genomes is likely to have been identified in
this study. These newly identified sequences were analyzed with GeneMark [34], to search for individual elements present in their structure, allowing the

identification of 290 new ORFs, scattered throughout the
genomes of the 6 strains analyzed herein (see GenBank
accession numbers ER935541 to ER935830). This represents an increment of approximately 10.2% in the
number of ORFs currently known to belong to the gene
pool of citrus-associated Xf [15].
However, comparative analyses among these 290 newly
identified ORFs has shown that a large proportion of these
elements (228 ORFs) seemed to belong to different
groups of orthologous proteins, present in the genomes of
two or more tested strains. Thus, to reduce the redundancy of this dataset, the predicted protein sequences
from these 290 ORFs have been submitted to cluster analysis, as described in Methods, resulting in 135 Groups of
Orthologous Elements (GOEs), which are more likely to
represent the actual number of new functional genes identified in the gene pool of the tested Xf strains (see Additional File 2). Analyses of similarity against the GenBank
have then been performed with Blastx, using the consensus sequences from each GOE as input, which allowed the
assignment of putative functions for each of these newly
identified elements. Their distribution into the different
functional categories originally described by Simpson and
co-workers is shown in Figure 3[15]. Surprisingly, a relatively small proportion of such sequences has been identified as "no hit" (only 23, which is equivalent to ~17% of
the newly identified GOEs). Another large fraction of elements (37) has been identified as conserved hypothetical
proteins (~28% of the total), displaying high similarity to
ORFs of unknown function, previously identified in the
genomes of other microorganisms – particularly in other
Xf strains (see below). Putative functions could be attributed to 75 newly identified GOEs (~55%) and the majority of them (50) are directly associated with mobile
genetic elements, since we identified 2 new phage structural proteins, 8 recombinases/integrases, 14 elements
involved with plasmid replication/stabilization and 26
elements that are homologous to conjugation factors
belonging to the TraA/TraB/Cag/Vir families, originally
described in Agrobacterium tumafasciens [35]. The remaining 25 GOEs, (18.5%) encode proteins that are involved
with several metabolic processes of the cell, including a
group of six new potential virulence factors, which had
not been originally identified in the genome of Xf strain
9a5c. These include two homologues for the transcription
factor AbrB (GOEs #17 and #43 in Additional File 1), a

The Blastx analyses also confirmed that the sequences
from all 135 elements described above could not be
found in the genome of Xf strain 9a5c. Surprisingly, however, these analyses showed that a large proportion of
these sequences (67.5%) has already been identified in Xf
strains from North America – particularly in the case of Xf
Ann-1, isolated from oleander (Figure 4). As shown in
Additional File 3, the consensus sequences from 67 GOEs,
showed high similarity to ORFs originally described in Xf
strain Ann-1, encoding both hypothetical proteins and
proteins with assigned functions. Sixteen GOEs showed

effectiveness of the SSH sequencing approach to continually
identify novel sequences in the genomes of the Xf strains in
this study, increasing numbers of SSH sequences were submitted to clustering analyses with Phred/CAP3 and the consensus sequences obtained through this analysis were filtered
against the genomic sequence of Xf strain 9a5c. The number
of novel nucleotides identified through this approach was
plotted as a function of sequenced SSH clones. The inclination of the curve indicates that the SSH approach is still capable of identifying novel sequences in the genomes of the
tested strains, although it is likely that most such sequences
have already been obtained.

high similarity with elements identified in the genome of
Xf strain Dixon (isolated from almond trees) and eight
were most similar to sequences found in Xf strain Temecula-1 (isolated from grapevines). Such an overlap with
genes from the North American Xf gene pool was unexpected and suggests that the list of unique ORFs, recently
proposed by Doddapaneni and coworkers [22], as potential targets for strain-specific detection of North American
Xf strains in the wild must be revised [36]. As shown in
Table 5, approximately 27.7% of the ORFs, previously
believed to be unique to Xf strain Ann-1 (23 out of 83)
and 5.5% of the ORFs, previously believed to be unique to
Xf strain Dixon (3 out of 54) have also been found in the
citrus-associated strains analyzed in this study. On the
other hand, since the consensus sequences from 23 GOEs
returned "no hit" when compared to the NCBI databases,
these elements might prove useful as targets for PCRbased detection of citrus-associated Xf strains (Figure 3).

analyzed strains [22]. Thus, Xf strain 9a5c (as well as other
South American strains) may have evolved from an ancestral bacterium, carrying a Temecula-1-like genome,
through incorporation of a series of horizontally transferred elements, such as prophages, GIs and plasmids
[26]. This possibility is reinforced by the microarray-based
comparisons undertaken in this study with the citrusassociated strains, since they provide further evidence for
intense transpositional activity of mobile elements during
the evolution of this subgroup of Xf.

Identification of the microorganisms carrying the closest
homologue for each of the 135 Groups of Orthologous Elements (GOEs) that have been identified in the genomes of
the tested strains through SSH analysis. These sequences
were obtained after alignment of sequenced SSH clones from
each strain. The consensus sequences for each contig have
been filtered against the genome of Xf strain 9a5c and the
remaining sequences were analyzed with Genemark to identify new ORFs. The sequences from such ORFs have been
clustered and the resulting contig consensuses (or singlet
sequences) have been submitted to Blastx analyses against
the GenBank. The most significant Blast hit was considered
for this analysis.

Altogether, the consensus sequences from only 21 GOEs
showed similarity to genes identified in microorganisms
that do not belong to the Xf group (Figure 4). Interestingly, one third of these elements (7) seem to be homologous to ORFs identified in the genome of
Verminephrobacter eiseniae, a soil-inhabiting bacterium
that infects nematodes [37], while the remaining ones
show high similarity to genes found in a great number of
microorganisms, such as E. coli, Geobacter metalireducens, Salmonella enterica, Solibacter usitatus, Xanthomonas sp., Burkholderia sp., Chlorobium tepidum,
among others.

Discussion
Results obtained from several lines of research, developed
during the past decade, have turned the phytobacterium
Xylella fastidiosa into a unique model of study in the fields
of both phytopathology and genomics. First of all, this is
due to the fact that several diseases, associated with many
distinct bacterial strains have been characterized and
some of these diseases are responsible for significant economic losses. Moreover, a significant amount of genomic
information has been obtained for four different strains of
this microorganism, allowing the development of both
functional and comparative genomic analyses within the
group. Comparisons performed with the four sequenced
Xf genomes led Doddapaneni and coworkers to suggest
that the Tenecula-1 strain genome is the one that most
likely resembles the ancestral Xf genome, since it has
undergone the fewest genetic changes among the four

So far, most comparative studies among South American
Xf strains have essentially involved Brazilian strains from
both citrus and coffee trees. In general, the available data
supports the idea that CVC-associated bacteria found in
Brazil have evolved directly from Xf strains that cause coffee leaf scorch (CLS), since CVC-associated Xf strains have
been shown to induce CLS symptoms when experimentally inoculated into coffee trees [38]. Moreover, it is
widely known that most areas in which citrus orchards are
presently cultivated used to be dedicated to coffee plantations and there have been reports of CVC vectors feeding
on coffee trees [39]. Nonetheless, the exact origin of CVCrelated Xf strains is still a matter of speculation, since very
little research has been performed on Pecosita-related Xf
strains. The origin of this subgroup of Xf is an important
piece of information regarding the evolutionary history of
citrus-associated Xf strains, specially considering that
Pecosita has been known to occur in Argentina before the
first descriptions of CVC in Brazil (reviewed in [31]).
Thus, the present study shows the first genomic-scale
comparative evaluation involving a Pecosita-related Xf
strain (Fb7). It is interesting to verify from these data that,
while Xf strain Fb7 (isolated in 2000) appears to be very
similar to Xf strain 9a5c (isolated back in 1987 [7]), significant genomic differences have been observed when
these strains are compared to Xf-CVC bacteria isolated in
more recent years, specially regarding the activity of horizontally transferred elements. Although it is tempting to
speculate from this data that the evolutionary rates among
CVC- and Pecosita-related strains might differ, it is clear
that further phylogenetic and biogeographical studies
have yet to be performed in order to shed more light into
our knowledge regarding the evolutionary history of the
South American Xf strains, as well as their corresponding
diseases. An attempt to verify the evolutionary relationships between Xf strains 9a5c, Fb7 and the other Xf strains
has been performed by sequencing the 16S-23S rDNA
spacer region of these bacteria, but since no strain-specific
mutations have been found in this sequence, such analysis turned out to be inconclusive (data not shown).
As mentioned before, the fact that the overall genomic
information obtained for X. fastidiosa has been mostly

described by Doddapaneni and coworkers [22].

based on sequence information derived from North
American strains, was likely to have biased to some of the
conclusions obtained so far, specially considering the evolutionary complexity of these bacteria, which have been
shown to carry an extremely large and active flexible gene
pool [26]. As expected, the SSH experiments described in
this work, which constitute the first attempt to undertake
a large-scale survey of the genomic composition of South
American Xf strains, showed that a total of 26 ORFs, originally identified as unique to the North American strains
also seem to be present in the citrus strains from South
America [22]. Among these ORFs, 23 had been proposed
to be exclusive to Xf strain Ann-1 and 3 were supposed to
be present only in the genome of Xf strain Dixon. Thus,
sequencing of SSH clones from citrus-associated Xf strains
resulted in a reduction of approximately 19% in the list of
unique genes that could be used as markers for North
American strains (this number increases to ~27.7% if we
consider only the list of genes believed to be unique to Xf
strain Ann-1) [22,36]. These findings reinforce the importance of gathering more information regarding the
genomic composition of South American strains – including strains isolated from other hosts, such as coffee, to

help in understanding the evolutionary history of the Xf
group and assist in the development of tools for specific
identification of pathovars [40] and other variants.
At this point, it is not clear whether the increasing overlap
between elements found in South and North American
strains are a result of ancestry, or represent lateral transfer
events among strains [41]. Although the geographical separation of South and North American strains presents a
clear barrier to lateral gene transfer events, the evolutionary history of the Xf genome has been shown to be
extremely dynamic, highly influenced by the activity of
transpositional elements from its large flexible gene pool
[26,42]. In fact, direct evidence for the occurrence of
genetic exchange between Xf strains from the two continents has already been reported after analysis of one Xf
strain, obtained from plum trees in South America [43].
Regardless of its geographical origin, the genomic profile
obtained for this strain clearly indicated that it descended
from North American strains and was likely to have been
accidentally introduced into the South American continent via infected plant material. However, this strain carried practically all genes from pXf 51, a large plasmid

Page 8 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:474

found exclusively in South American Xf strains, which was
likely acquired by conjugation events with South American strains [26].
Thus, given the fact that Xf strains are known to infect
more than 100 plant species – many of which are commercial crops that are constantly shipped to foreign countries [13] (see also [44]), it is not unlikely to assume that
other contamination events might have taken place,
allowing the introduction of North American strains into
the South American territory, and vice versa. Further conjugation events, for instance, might have introduced genes
that were specific to the North American strains into the
gene pool of South American strains, which could have
been facilitated by the presence of such a large set of transposable elements in the Xf genome and the fact that multiple strains have been shown to coexist in the same host
– both in the case of infected plants, as well as insect vectors [45,46].
The dynamics of Xf genome evolution can also be
deduced through evaluation of other mobile elements,
particularly in the case of GI1, which seems to be absent
from the North American strains, but present in one or
more copy numbers in South American strains, as shown
in Figure 1. Among all mobile elements identified in Xf,
GI1 is the one that best fulfills the definition of a Genomic
Island, since it displays a higher GC content, altered
codon bias, insertion at the 3'end of a tRNA gene (tRNA
N) and the presence, at one end, of ORFs that display high
similarity to a heterodimeric integrase found in association with an insertion element from Helicobacter pylori
(ORFs Xf0535 and Xf0536) [47,48]. More interestingly,
GI1 may be significant for the evolution of the Xf group,
since all studies undertaken so far, involving a total of 10
different South American strains, obtained from both citrus and coffee, indicate that this element may represent a
genomic sinapomorphy for the South American Xf strains
[26]. At this point, it is not possible to determine if elements present in GI1 play any role(s) in mediating adaptation of South American Xf strains to their specific hosts,
nor if they participate in the process plant infection and
colonization. Nonetheless, this element carries a series of
ORFs whose products are potentially involved with host
adaptation and pathogenicity, resembling the structure of
Pathogenicity Islands (PAIs) observed in other bacteria
[49]. For instance, GI1 carries a unique fimbrillin gene,
represented by ORF Xf0487. Fimbrillins are components
of bacterial type I fimbriae, which are directly implicated
in the process of attachment to different types of substrates and biofilm formation [50]. Novel fimbriae, composed by distinct fimbrillin genes, are believed to be
important virulence determinants, allowing colonization
of specific hosts and differentiation of virulent clonal
groups of pathogenic bacteria, as in the case of E. coli

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/474

strains, in which new fimbrillin isomorphs are also associated with horizontally transferred elements [51]. Interestingly, Xf strains that display specificity to different host
and vector species also display a variable number of fimbrilling homologues scattered throughout their genomes
[15,18,19].
GI1 has also been shown to carry toxin-associated genes,
such as ORF Xf0513, which encodes a hemolysin-like protein, which is implicated in cytotoxic reactions associated
with many pathogenic bacteria [52], and ORF Xf 0486,
involved in the synthesis of the LPS fraction of Gram-negative bacteria that mediates adverse reactions in both
human and animal hosts during infection by pathogenic
bacteria [53]. In the case of phytobacteria, the O-antigen
portion of LPS has been shown to display a strain-specific
pattern, which is believed to play a major role in host recognition during the plant colonization process [54].
Finally, GI1 also carries ORF Xf0506, which encodes the
virulence-associated factor vapE from Dichelobacter nodosus, the causative agent of ovine footrot disease. In this
bacterium, the vap genes are present in a family of Pathogenicity Islands called the Vap elements [32]. Interestingly, up to 3 different Vap elements, varying in length
and ORF composition, have been mapped throughout the
genome of D. nodosus and although their exact function(s)
are still unknown, their presence has been clearly shown
to be associated with the virulence phenotype in this bacterium [32]. Curiously, as mentioned above, the vapEcontaining region of GI1 is also duplicated in Xf strain
9a5c, as a part of GI5, resembling the organization of Vap
elements in D. nodosus.
As mentioned above, additional virulence factors have
now been identified in the genome of citrus-associated
strains through the SSH experiments. One of these elements encodes a new form of pilin, associated with type
IV fimbriae, whose twitching motility mechanism has
been shown to be of capital importance to host colonization in Xf [55]. This finding reinforces the importance of
fimbriae for the evolutionary divergence of Xf strains.
Transcriptional regulators, such as the abrB activator have
also been found through the SSH experiments. This transcription factor is responsible for controlling several
genes, specifically activated at the end of bacterial exponential growth phase in Bacillus subtilis, and has been
shown to be implicated with biofilm formation in this
bacterium [56]. Interestingly, biofilm formation is
believed to be an important virulence factor in Xf during
the development of both CVC and PD, since growth in
biofilm is likely to participate in the process of bacterial
adherence to the xylem vessels, contribute to xylem occlusion and increase bacterial survival against the oxidative
burst mediated by infected plant tissues [57,58]. Two different homologues of the abrB gene have been found in 4

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:474

out of the 6 analyzed Xf strains (56a, 9.12c, Fb7 and
187b), while the new pilin gene has been found only in Xf
strain 9.12c. Two other potential virulence factors found
in the Xf-CVC gene pool seem to belong to the CysE/LacA/
LpxA/NodL family of acetyltransferases, which are characterized by multiple repeats of the sequence [LIV]-G-X(4)
[59]. In both cases, the highest similarities found for these
newly identified acetyltransferases are with genes lpxA and
lpxD from the North American strains Ann-1 and Temecula-1 [18,19], which are involved in synthesis and modification of the O-antigen fraction of Gram-negative
bacteria LPS. As mentioned above, the strain-specific
structure of the O-antigen has been show to be an important mediator in plant colonization by symbiotic bacteria,
especially in the case of nodule formation during Rhizobium-legume interactions [59]. Finally, the genomes of Xf
strains 187b and 9.12c seem to carry a copy of the gene
that encodes the Zonula Occludens Toxin (Zot), also found
in Xf strain Ann-1. zot-like genes have been found in association with several bacterial pathogens, such as Xanthomonas, Vibrio and Stenotrophomonas, among others [60]
and are likely to be laterally transferred among microorganisms through the action of filamentous phages [61].
This toxin has been originally described as an important
virulence factor in Vibrio cholerae, and seems to be responsible for the development of severe cases of diarrhea
caused by V. cholerae strains that do not carry the cholera
toxin gene ctxA. The activity of Zot as an enterotoxin
seems to be associated to its capacity to interfere with tight
junctions of the gastrointestinal epithelium, altering its
permeability to water and other substances [61,62].
Nonetheless, regardless of its recognized importance as a
virulence factor in animal or human infections, there is no
direct evidence that Zot plays any role(s) during plant colonization and/or pathogenicity, although this gene has
also been found in the genome of Xanthomonas campestris,
the causative agent of black rot disease, characterized by
hyper-hydration of infected plant tissues, associated with
wet edged lesions, which may be a result of Zot activity
[63].

Conclusion
The experiments described in the present study represent
the first attempt to conduct microarray-based genomic
comparisons and a large-scale survey of genes present in
the genomes of South American Xf strains. The results
from the microarray-based comparison provide further
evidence concerning the intense transpositional activity of
several horizontally transferred elements and reinforce
previous studies regarding the importance of lateral gene
transfer as a major mediator in the evolution of this
important group of phytopathogens. Moreover, comparison of the microarray-based genomic profiles showed
similarity between Xf strains 9a5c and Fb7, which is unexpected, given the geographical and chronological differ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/474

ences associated with the isolation of these
microorganisms. It is clear that a more comprehensive
evaluation of both coffee- and Pecosita-related strains is
necessary before we can fully understand the evolutionary
history of South American Xf strains and their associated
diseases.
The characterization of approximately 9,000 SSH clones,
from six representatives of citrus haplotypes, have now
provided a more comprehensive view of the size and composition of the Xf-CVC gene pool, allowing us to identify
290 new ORFs – a number that represents an ~10.2%
increase in our current knowledge of the South American
Xf gene pool. These results allowed identification of new
putative virulence factors, as well as novel potential markers for strain identification within this subgroup of phytopathogens by molecular-based approaches. Moreover,
several sequences previously believed to be unique markers for North American strains have now been found in
the genomes of these South American strains [22]. These
new data point to the necessity of revising the molecular
markers currently accepted as potential targets for identification of distinct Xf strains in the wild [22]. Finally, by
evaluating the rate at which novel sequences have been
identified through the SSH approach, we conclude that
the complete composition of the South American Xf gene
pool can still be stretched, specially if this type of analysis
is further extended to strains obtained from alternative
hosts, such as coffee, which is known to harbor many different Xf strains throughout the South American territory
[64].

Methods
Strains, growth conditions and DNA extraction
All Xf strains used in this work (Table 1) have been isolated by our research group and are deposited at the culture collection of the Centro APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira.
Those interested in obtaining samples of these strains
and/or more specific information should contact HDCF
helvecio@centrodecitricultura.br. Four Xf strains (9.12c,
56a, 187b, and 36f) have been previously described and
are representatives of the most prevalent Xf-CVC haplotypes found out of 360 strains obtained from the northwestern, central, western, and southern regions of the
State of São Paulo [28]. Xf strain Cv21 was obtained in
February 2001 from a non-symptomatic sweet orange tree
(C. sinensis) in the city of Colina, SP. The tree was grafted
onto a Poncirus trifoliate rootstock and was present within
a highly CVC-infected orchard. Xf strain Fb7 was isolated
in October, 2000, from a ten-year-old sweet orange tree
(C. sinensis cv. Valencia) grafted onto a Poncirus trifoliate
rootstock in the province of Corrientes, Argentina. The
tree had several branches carrying leaves that displayed
typical Pecosita symptoms [65].

For strain isolation, 3–5-mm-diameter branches were collected, surface disinfected, cut in the middle and the internal ends were squeezed with a pair of pliers. The sap was
blotted onto BCYE agar plates [66] and incubated at 28°C
for 15 to 20 days. Isolated colonies were selected using a
stereo-microscope, streaked onto fresh BCYE agar plates,
and incubated at 28°C for 7 days. Identification of X. fastidiosa was carried out based on fastidious in vitro growth,
white color of colonies, and PCR assays using primers specific to CVC-causing strains of X. fastidiosa [16]. All strains
were have been maintained at -80°C. For this work, the
bacteria were recovered on PW agar medium [67] and the
plates maintained for 10 days at 28°C. The colonies were
transferred once to new plates containing the same
medium, grown for 20 days and harvested for DNA extraction using the protocol developed by Wilson [68].
Microarray fabrication
Xf microarrays have been constructed as previously
described [26,30]. Briefly, representative sequences from
approximately 2200 ORFs from the Xf strain 9a5c genome
(> 90% coverage) were PCR amplified, purified and spotted onto CMT-GAPS silane-coated slides (Corning), using
an Affymetrix 427 arrayer, according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
DNA labeling and hybridization conditions
Labeling reactions and purification were performed as
described in Nunes and coworkers [26]. Arrays were
hybridized overnight (42°C) in a GeneTac Hybridization
Station (Genomic Solutions, Inc – Ann Arbor, MI), in 6 ×
SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.25 mg/ml sheared salmon
sperm DNA, 0.5% SDS and 2 μg of each labeled DNA
sample. After hybridization, slides were washed twice
(42°C) in 0.5 × SSC, 0.01% SDS, followed by two washes
in 0.06 × SSC, 0.01% SDS and two final washes in 0.06 ×
SSC. All washing steps consisted of 1 minute of flow, followed by 5 minutes of incubation. Slides were then dried
and submitted to fluorescence detection.
Image acquisition and analysis
Hybridized arrays were scanned in an Affymetrix 418
Array Scanner and images were analyzed with Affymetrix
Jaguar v 2.0 [69]. Quality control of the hybridized spots
was automatically performed by the software, based on
spot morphology and local signal-to-background ratio,
using the Easy Threshold and Variable Circle Size Algorithms [69]. In all experiments, reliable hybridization signals were obtained for more than 90% of the arrayed
probes (see [30]). Normalization between the intensities
in the two channels was achieved with the Jaguar Control
Spots option, using a list of 30 control ORFs that shared
sequence identity in the genomes of Xf strains 9a5c and
Temecula-1. For each pair of strains, two independent
hybridizations were performed. Since each microarray

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/474

carried 2 copies of the arrayed genes, these hybridizations
resulted in a total of 4 measurements for each probe in the
microarray. These data were consolidated into a GATC
database with Affymetrix MicroDB v.2.0 and the averages
from all six readings were submitted to scatter plot visualization with Affymetrix Data Mining Tool v.2.0. Statistical
validation of fold change variations was performed with
the aid of the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)
method proposed by Tusher and coworkers [70]. Spots
that showed a Reference/Test ratio < 1:2 were considered
to be present in greater copy number in the test over the
reference strain, as proposed by Smoot and coworkers
[71], while spots that showed an average Reference/Test
ratio > 5:1 were considered to be missing in the test strain.
The application of these criteria in a direct sequence comparison between Xf strains 9a5c and Temecula-1, which
have been completely sequenced, provided an estimated
error rate below 0.3% [30]. Raw and normalized data
from all microarray hybridizations, as well as the microarray complete annotation file have been submitted (in
MIAME-compliant format) to NCBI's Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) and can be assessed through Series
number GSE 8493.
Genome comparisons were viewed and compared using
TIGR Multi-Experiment Viewer (TMEV), v.4.0 [72]. For
the visualization of comparative profiles from each analyzed strain, we applied the method proposed by Smoot
and coworkers [71], where ORFs shared by the reference
and each test strain were labeled 0, while ORFs exclusive
to the reference strain, or present in greater copy number
in the test over the reference strain were labeled 1 and -1,
respectively.
Suppressive Subtraction Hybridization
Suppressive subtraction hybridization was performed
essentially as described by Agron and coworkers [73].
Briefly, 4 μg of both tester and driver DNA were individually digested with the different restriction endonucleases
chosen for this study, in a 200 μL reaction for approximately 16 hs. Next, the reactions were terminated by the
addition of 1 μL 0.5 M EDTA, heated to 65°C for 30 minutes and the DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform and
concentrated to 10 μL ddH2O, after ethanol precipitation.
Two small samples of each digested tester DNA (120 ng)
were ligated to their specific adaptors 1 and 2 (see [73]),
in two separate ligation reactions. Each ligation was performed in a 10-μL final volume, containing 1 μL (200
units) of T4 DNA ligase and 1 μL of 10× ligation buffer
(New England BioLabs), at 16°C for 16 hs. The first step
of the subtraction hybridization was then performed, mixing 12 ng of each adaptor-ligated tester DNA to 600 ng of
digested driver DNA, in a 5 μL reaction volume, containing 250 mM Hepes (pH8.3), 2.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA.
These mixtures were denatured by incubation at 98°C for

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:474

1.5 min and transferred to 65°C for 1.5 hs. For the second
step of the SSH reaction, the two mixtures derived from
the first step were mixed and 600 ng of digested driver
DNA were added to the solution. The mixture was again
denatured by incubation at 98°C for 1.5 min and incubated at 65°C for 14 hs. The resulting solution was
diluted in 200 μL of Dilution Buffer (50 mM NaCl, 5 mM
Hepes, pH 8.3, 0.2 mM EDTA) and incubated at 65°C for
10 more minutes, to eliminate non-specific hybridizations. One microliter (1 μL) from this final reaction was
PCR amplified with the P01 initiator [73], in a 50 μL reaction, using the reagents from the Advantage 2 Polymerase
Mix kit (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The cycling profile for the PCR reactions
included 25 cycles at: 95°C for 30 seconds, 66°C for 30
seconds and 72°C for 1.5 min. The final reaction was then
diluted 20 times in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 and a 1-μL
aliquot of this mixture was submitted to a second PCR
reaction with initiators NP01 and NP02 (20 μM each)
[73]. The reaction mixture was essentially as described
above, but the cycling profile included only 10 cycles at:
95°C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for
1.5 min. Finally, 3-μL aliquots from each SSH reaction
were ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega), according
to the manufacturer's instructions and this was used to
transform competent E. coli cells, in order to generate the
SSH libraries. Using 3 different restriction nucleases for
the analysis of each strain, a total of 9,246 clones were isolated from 18 SSH libraries (Table 3).
DNA sequencing and analysis
All SSH clones were selected and submitted to automated
DNA sequencing using an ABI 3100 DNA analyzer,
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Further analyses were performed for each individual strain separately.
Thus, sequences from each group of strain-specific SSH
libraries were trimmed, in order to exclude vector
sequences and poor quality regions (Phred < 20), and
aligned with the aid of CAP3 [74]. Sequences that
remained as singlets, or resulted in small contigs with
poor quality consensus sequences (Phred < 40) were
excluded from further analyses. The consensus sequences
from the remaining contigs were filtered against the
genome of Xf strain 9a5c with the aid of the software
cross_match [33], allowing the identification of stretches
of DNA that were exclusive to the tested strains. The
cross_match parameters used to filter both vector and Xf
strain 9a5c sequences were minmatch = 15 and minscore
= 20. These newly identified sequences were analyzed
with GeneMark, [34] to search for new individual ORFs
present in their structure. The sequences from all newly
identified ORFs were submitted to GenBank and can be
accessed through numbers ER935541 to ER935830.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/474

Since some of these ORFs could be present in the genome
of more than one tested strain, the redundancy of the
dataset was reduced, submitting the predicted aminoacid
sequences from all identified ORFs to a clusterization
analysis with the aid of Blast_Clust [75] and ClustalW
[76], using a Perl script specially developed for this purpose [77]. This allowed the distribution of the 290 ORFs
originally identified by GeneMark into 135 Groups of
Orthologous Elements (GOEs). Analyses of similarity
against the GenBank have next been performed with
Blastx, using the consensus sequences from each GOE as
input, allowing the assignment of putative functions for
each of these newly identified elements, as well as their
distribution into the different functional categories originally described by Simpson and coworkers [15].
The rate at which novel nucleotides could be identified in
the SSH clones was determined by submitting subsets of
SSH sequences to analysis with PhedPhrap/CAP3/
cross_match (9a5c), as described above. After processing
each subset, the number of novel nucleotides identified in
the resulting sequence was determined by counting the
nucleotides in the assembled contigs. Each sequence subset was built choosing random sequences within the
whole set of Xf SSH sequences. A Perl script was developed
for such purpose [77].

Authors' contributions
VSS and FBR carried out the microarray analyses, SSH and
sequencing experiments. CSS and DCDR were responsible
for sequence alignment and other bioinformatics analyses. AAS, HDCF and MAM were responsible for helping in
conceiving the study, as well as Xf strain selection, maintenance and DNA extraction. LRN and RCO were responsible for conceiving the project, as well as most data
interpretation, general coordination of the study and final
manuscript elaboration. All authors read and approved
the final manuscript.
